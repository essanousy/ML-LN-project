In the past, Zuo Mo had not chased after power. He did not have great ambitions, it was enough to have enough power to live well. But right now, he had an almost absurd desire for power. It was clear that both the matter of healing A Gui or investigating his birth, success would be based on one foundation, strength, great strength!</p><br/><p>Everyday, he was immersed in cultivation as though he did not know exhaustion. He was waiting for Shu Long and the others to arrive. If his investigation was right, Nether Spring Jie wasn\u2019t a place that he could go to alone.</p><br/><p>Ten Crow Celestial Apparatus.</p><br/><p>The physique ranked third in the general level and as expected, it had its unique traits. Wei was familiar with all kinds of mo physiques and this allowed Zuo Mo\u2019s cultivation to be extremely focused. In a few short days, Zuo Mo\u2019s strength had shot forward and he finally had a comprehensive understanding of the Ten Crow Celestial Apparatus.</p><br/><p>The name Ten Crow Celestial Apparatus, alluded to the ten suns on different areas of his body. They looked more like carefully carved tattoos, and not mo matrixes.</p><br/><p>The most eye-catching was the sun matrix at the center of Zuo Mo\u2019s forehead. The perfect circle was made of complex and beautiful patterns. There was a jagged zig-zagging pattern on the circumference of each deep dark gold sun, representing rays of light.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo\u2019s face was not handsome, but when the sun script symbol appeared there, it added a hint of mysteriousness and nobility.</p><br/><p>Ten Crow Celestial Apparatus, each sun represented a source of power. He needed to accumulate power and activate each sun. Each sun contained a transformation. Ten suns, meant ten transformations.</p><br/><p>According to Wei, mo that cultivated Ten Crow Celestial Apparatus were rare, and rarer were those that comprehended all ten transformations.</p><br/><p>Ten Crow Celestial Apparatus, each transformation was extremely powerful and domineering. What was even more frightening was that the power of Ten Crow Celestial Apparatus would be used with finesse and technique, and was not just the application of brute force.</p><br/><p>But what was most famous about the Ten Crow Celestial Apparatus was not the ten transformations, but that it had the title of best domain in general level, [Ten Crow Celestial Domain]!</p><br/><p>Hearing this, Zuo Mo hungered for it. It was a pity that Wei didn\u2019t know how to comprehend [Ten Crow Celestial Domain].</p><br/><p>[Domain] was a type of power that was accessible to only those yuanying xiuzhe, general mo, and Rahula yao. Ding Zhen\u2019s [Lantern Fire Buddhist Domain] was an example, and Wei Sheng had been able to grasp the beginnings of [Domain] while he was in jindan. Wei Sheng\u2019s talents were astounding.</p><br/><p>Having seen Ding Zhen\u2019s [Lantern Fire Buddhist Domain], Zuo Mo yearned for [Domain].</p><br/><p>However, Wei did not speak more about how to comprehend [Domain]. That was something far beyond where Zuo Mo was.</p><br/><p>Even though Zuo Mo had obtained Ten Crow Celestial Apparatus due to having a precious treasure in his body, he still lacked comprehension. With his body now in a balanced state, having had a breakthrough in his mo physique, ling power, and consciousness. It was the two powers to first have breakthroughs that were now holding him back. Zuo Mo worked on processing the shen power in his right hand, and then turned it into ling power and spiritual consciousness. He used this method to also strengthen his Ten Crow Celestial Apparatus.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo had originally assumed that this stabilization would take a long time. Unexpectedly, he only needed ten days to raise his ling power to yuanying levels, and his consciousness to yao mansion.</p><br/><p>One factor was the abundance of shen power. The increase in the power whirlpool in Zuo Mo\u2019s right hand was still accelerating, and the amount of shen power he draw everyday increased. While overjoyed, Zuo Mo was also slightly worried. Based on this speed, the shen power being produced every day would soon surpass the amount he could process.</p><br/><p>The other factor was that while his Ten Crow Celestial Apparatus was not very stable, it was at the general level, and higher than both jindan and yin spirit. But Zuo Mo had forcefully crossed the boundary between levels by relying on treasures and his understanding of the power was completely different than others at the level.</p><br/><p>All paths of power led to the same destination. Even though the mo physique was different compared to ling power and spirit consciousness, there were many places Zuo Mo could study and copy.</p><br/><p>Pu Yao and Wei were not shocked by Zuo Mo entering yuanying. In their eyes, this was natural. However, Pu Yao was slightly excited now that Zuo Mo\u2019s consciousness formed the yao mansion.</p><br/><p>Yao that formed their yao mansion were called Rahula yao and could be counted in the ranks of experts in the yao world.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo\u2019s talent in yao arts was actually very good, but compared to the even more amazing mo physique, it was slightly lacking. Leaving Pu Yao to feel that although Zuo Mo was his student, Wei had taken the glory. Now that Zuo Mo had formed his yao mansion, it meant that he could pass more yao arts to Zuo Mo.</p><br/><p>Also, Archaic Wasteland Sacrificial Art was more suited to Rahula yao!</p><br/><p>However, Pu Yao did not say this. He was busy doing some other things.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>Some strange messages appeared in the corners of Ten Finger Prison.</p><br/><p>The messages were worded strangely and the sentences incomprehensible. They were also posted in remote places that were not attention-catching. But if those with intentions searched, they would find to their shock that there were similar messages at every level of Ten Finger Prison.</p><br/><p>\u201cWill this work?\u201d Wei asked Pu Yao.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t know.\u201d Pu Yao\u2019s bloody pupil was deep. \u201cIt has been too long. I don\u2019t know if they still remember, let\u2019s just try.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how many of Master\u2019s supporters still remain,\u201d Wei said calmly, \u201cI have sent out the blood summons.\u201d</p><br/><p>Pu Yao\u2019s eyes flashed with a reckless light, a cold smirk at the corner of his mouth. \u201cNo matter how powerful time is, it will leave some remnants behind.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou plan on having A Zuo inherit all of this?\u201d Wei looked at Pu Yao.</p><br/><p>Pu Yao shook his head. \u201cHe may not be willing to inherit.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOur thoughts are the same.\u201d Wei nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, he needs power.\u201d Pu Yao\u2019s robes moved despite the lack of wind, his voice became deep. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t understand himself, and we cannot truly understand him. His enemies most likely are far more powerful than even he imagines, he only has one path.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei suddenly gave a small smile. \u201cVery similar to how we were.\u201d</p><br/><p>Pu Yao\u2019s memories were stirred by this, a reminiscing expression in his bloody pupil. He quickly calmed down. \u201cAlso, it will not be unprofitable for them to follow him. Families that stood guard for thousands of years and did not give up should return to glory!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei sighed. \u201cI do not know how many still remain.\u201d</p><br/><p>Pu Yao also became silent. He also did not know.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo suddenly stopped his cultivation. He detected someone was approaching. His body turned towards the people approaching and stood between them and A Gui, shielding A Gui behind him.</p><br/><p>Two figures appeared like ghosts nearby.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s you!\u201d Zuo Mo\u2019s gaze focused and he was shocked inside.</p><br/><p>In the night, Ceng Lian\u2019er\u2019s exquisite and beautiful features looked more mysterious. Her black opal like eyes held an indescribable light. There was also a woman standing next to her. Looking at her attire, it should be Ceng Lian\u2019er\u2019s maid.</p><br/><p>She stopped at a distance of five zhang from Zuo Mo.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are going to Nether Spring Jie?\u201d the serene voice drifted over with the wind.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo who had not lowered his guard suddenly focused his gaze. He asked in a deep voice, \u201cHow do you know?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is Shattered Stone Jie.\u201d Ceng Lian\u2019er did not pay attention to Zuo Mo\u2019s wariness.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo understood. Most likely, his search for Reverse Shadow Spirit Silkgrass had caught Ceng Yi\u2019s attention. This outrageously beautiful woman in front of him gave him a great sense of danger. Even though a part of his breakthrough was owed to this person, and the other\u2019s silver shen power had been one of the main causes of his breakthrough.</p><br/><p>But he could not get the measure of this woman\u2019s power or intentions.</p><br/><p>\u201cI cultivate moon shen power.\u201d Ceng Lian\u2019er\u2019s seductive face became slightly dazed. She raised her face, and the moon above her head brightened slightly. A ray of moonlight fell on her face, illuminating her delicate features.</p><br/><p>The long eyelashes, the warm lips, the flawless face, under the illumination of the moon, it seemed to shake the soul.</p><br/><p>\u201cMoon shen power?\u201d Zuo Mo finally understood why the other\u2019s shen power would have power resonance with his shen power.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will go with you to Nether Spring Jie,\u201d Ceng Lian\u2019er said serenely.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll go with me to Nether Spring Jie?\u201d Zuo Mo heard this and stopped for a long time before he reacted. He felt it was humorous. \u201cHaha, what are you saying? You are going with me to Nether Spring JIe? Haha.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Ceng Lian\u2019er looked at Zuo Mo with her calm eyes.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo heard the determination in the other\u2019s voice and his humor receded. He frowned. \u201cThis joke isn\u2019t funny, I\u2019m not familiar with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ceng Lian\u2019er\u2019s voice was extremely pleasing to hear. \u201cBecause you cultivate sun shen power, and I cultivate moon shen power.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t understand.\u201d Zuo Mo shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf we cultivate together, our shen power will grow even more quickly,\u201d Ceng Lian\u2019er explained.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo finally understood. \u201cYou mean power resonance?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is also called paired cultivation,\u201d Ceng Lian\u2019er said lightly, \u201cit is very beneficial to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo was not persuaded. \u201cI do not need it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause of your right hand?\u201d A hint of mirth rose in Ceng Lian\u2019er\u2019s pupils.</p><br/><p>However, Zuo Mo did not find it funny. His heart shook. The other\u2019s familiarity with his secrets surpassed his expectations\u2026 to even know about the whirlpool of shen power in his hand.</p><br/><p>This woman \u2026 \u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cI do not have any malicious intentions. The whirlpool in your right hand is growing, and you can only absorb a small amount. When it reaches a certain level, you will lose control of it.\u201d</p><br/><p>She stared at Zuo Mo and said, \u201cPaired cultivation can solve this problem.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo spread his hands. \u201cWhy should I believe you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause when your shen power awakened me, it left an imprint on my body. If you die, I cannot live,\u201d Ceng Lian\u2019er said as though it was nothing. \u201cIf I die, your shen power will also crumble.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHa! You are a good liar!\u201d Zuo Mo laughed coldly.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe paired cultivation\u2026 when it began it decided our fate. If I channel shen power, you will be able to feel it.\u201d As she spoke, the moonlight around Ceng Lian\u2019er brightened.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo\u2019s expression changed drastically. His shen power was moving against his will!</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is the power resonance you speak of. If you channel shen power, my shen power would also resonate.\u201d Ceng Lian\u2019ers words burrowed into Zuo Mo\u2019s ear.</p><br/><p>Damn it!</p><br/><p>\u201cI think that it is much safer to follow you, so that I do not die mysteriously one day without knowing the cause.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ceng Lian\u2019er didn\u2019t look at Zuo Mo as she slowly walked to his side. She sat down, and her maid knelt down next to her. In a blink, a little wooden table appeared, an exquisite tea set, a small stove, and she started to boil tea.</p><br/><p>Sea of consciousness.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo urgently asked Pu Yao and Wei, \u201cThis woman is truthful?\u201d</p><br/><p>The one that explained was Wei. \u201cIt is true, the paired cultivators in the ancient era usually lived and died together!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cScrew live and die together!\u201d Zuo Mo swore with a terrible expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cActually, this isn\u2019t a bad thing \u2026 \u2026\u201d Before Wei finished, Zuo Mo angrily turned and left the sea of consciousness.</p><br/><p>\u201cMoon shen power?\u201d Pu Yao was thoughtful.</p><br/><p>Translator Ramblings: I really want a prequel with Pu Yao and Wei. They have such interesting lives. Is Pu Yao from one of the major clans, which I don\u2019t think he is, or was he a \u201ccommoner\u201d that was seriously talented and made his own way up to become a sky yao and essentially the battle general of the yaomo? What was Wei\u2019s clan like? How many masters did he go through with the gravestone?</p><br/><p>Also, the chapter title is a nice pun. It can be interpreted two ways. One is \u2018screw \u201clive and die together\u201d and the other would be \u201cscrew, live and die together.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Why are you entering Wu Kong Mountain? What do you want to do?\u201d Wei Sheng said in a heavy voice, his Splitting Rainbow sword was ready to attack. This person of unknown origins had snuck into Wu Kong Mountain. He had accidentally discovered him. The other\u2019s cultivation was slightly above him. He had just come out of the sword formation. After fighting for a long time and having just broken through into ningmai, his mentality was at the highest level. His perception was more sensitive than it ever had been. If this was before, he definitely wouldn\u2019t have detected the other person. The other was so strong, he was in awe!</p><br/><p>He had pursued the other for three hundred kilometers and had almost lost them a few times. What he had given him an even worse feeling was the other person seemed to have had not used his full power.</p><br/><p>Wei Sheng\u2019s personality was courageous. Even though he knew the other was strong, he didn\u2019t have any thoughts to retreat. The desire for battle rose in his eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard that Young Master Wei had caused a natural apparition when entering zhuji, the sword energy reaching to the skies. Seeing you today, you really have lived up to your reputation. After entering the sword cave, Young Master seems to have learned a lot. Your sect\u2019s [Void Sword] finally has been uncovered. It really is auspicious.\u201d The white-clothed male\u2019s voice was warm and gentle, like a clear spring. Paired with his extremely handsome appearance, he appeared to be a graceful and learned young man, someone that people would have a hard time finding dislike for.</p><br/><p>Wei Sheng was even more wary. Other than the sect\u2019s disciple, no one else knew that he had entered the sword cave. This person was so clear about the sword cave. If previously, he hadn\u2019t been certain if the other had deliberately snuck into Wu Kong Mountain, he was now certain that this person had been secretly gathering information about the sect, and had malicious aims.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you are not willing to give your name, there is nothing to say,\u201d His tiger-like eyes brightened, and he shouted. The air around him moved, yet there was no wind, and slowly started to circle around him. The Splitting Rainbow sword appeared his hand, pointed at the white-clad male.</p><br/><p>The white-clad male found his surroundings darken as though he was situated in a void.</p><br/><p>An empty and murderous nothingness.</p><br/><p>An abnormal light flashed through the white-clothed male\u2019s eyes as he praised, \u201cYoung Master Wei is as talented as expected. [Void Sword] will definitely be spectacular in Young Master\u2019s hands!\u201d</p><br/><p>As he spoke, the figure of the white-clothed male that was standing still slowly faded. When he said the last word, his figure vanished at the same time, only leaving behind his voice.</p><br/><p>Shock finally came into Wei Sheng\u2019s eyes!</p><br/><p>His consciousness repeatedly scanned the surroundings. There were no traces. The other had left. Under the lock of his sword essence, he had disappeared into thin air! He made a thoughtful sound, stepped on the Splitting Rainbow sword, turned into a red light and flew in the direction of Wu Kong Sword Sect.</p><br/><p>When his figure disappeared on the horizon, on the spot the white-clothed male had disappeared, a figure slowly appeared.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it him?\u201d He gazed at the sky as he said to himself.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>Sky Moon House was the best dwelling in Dong Fu. It was halfway up the mountain, constructed on top of a ling vein. There were forty seven suites in total, all with the necessary talismans. The ling energy inside the rooms was extremely thick. The xiuzhe that passed through enjoyed resting at this place, but its price was extremely high. Ten pieces of third-grade jingshi per day. Zuo Mo might have earned a fair bit each day, but if he had to live in Sky Moon House, he would barely manage to pay the rent for each day, much less any other service.</p><br/><p>Sky Moon House, which was usually half-filled, was entirely filled today. The rent each day jumped from ten pieces of third-grade jingshi to fifty pieces of third-grade jingshi. Even so, there were no vacancies. All the experts that came from different parts of Sky Moon Jie were living here.</p><br/><p>The alcohol of Sky Moon House was Old Wang Alcohol. The ling food came from Master Shao\u2019s Food Pavilion.</p><br/><p>The Star Pavilion, the gathering place of Sky Moon House, had numerous day stones and broken crystals embedded in the ceiling, creating a roof of stars. In the rooms inside the Star Pavilion, the Serene Blue Ivy climbed all over the place, the blue fluorescence adding hints of mystery.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Chao is really lucky!\u201d Beside the stone table, a person couldn\u2019t help stating.</p><br/><p>The people seats were all attendees of the competition. Each person\u2019s face was full of envy. Without a doubt, Chao An had been the luckiest in his draw of all of them.</p><br/><p>Chao An was smug inside, but said, \u201cI\u2019m actually envious of everyone else. You can all have a good fight. For me, even if I won, I won\u2019t be praised,\u201d He came from Fort Chao, cultivated the extremely obscure Fiery Polaris Hammer, extremely strong and exquisite.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Chao is getting an advantage and playing humble,\u201d One of the other people smiled and said, \u201cAsk anyone else here, who doesn\u2019t want to switch with Brother Chao? Reputation is intangible, but the prize is real.\u201d</p><br/><p>The people seated all agreed.</p><br/><p>Chao An could only beg for forgiveness. In the end, only after he promised to pay for the meal did the others stop.</p><br/><p>In the little pavilion covered with light gauze, the figures of two people could be barely made out from the outside. If the gauze was lifted, anyone would instantly see it was the pick to win the competition, Gu Rong Ping, and opposite, him was a silent person wearing a black gauze veil.</p><br/><p>\u201cI had wanted to find a quiet place. But I didn\u2019t expect to see these kind of people,\u201d Gu Rong Ping frowned, and said discontentedly. His eyes landed on the black gauze of the person sitting opposite him, his voice warm as he said, \u201cI hadn\u2019t thought I would encounter Shimei here. I had thought it would take another five years before seeing Shimei here.\u201d</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t disguise the heart. No one would have guessed the person wearing the black hat, mysterious and strong xiuzhe called Su was actually female.</p><br/><p>Her glowing wrist reached out and picked up the ling tea in front of her. Gently lifting the corner of the black guaze, the moist and red lips touched the white and glowing porcelain cup. Gu Rong Ping\u2019s eyes instantly turned as hot as fire.</p><br/><p>\u201cShimei will even refuse to let me see your visage?\u201d Gu Rong Ping gazed at Su, and said sedately. But the excitement in his tone naturally spilled out.</p><br/><p>\u201cShixiong\u2019s heart has become disordered,\u201d Su said gently, the black gauze not rippling at all, \u201cIf the heart is disordered, where is the Heart Lake Sword?\u201d</p><br/><p>Gu Rong Ping\u2019s eyes flashed angrily. He didn\u2019t continue, and suddenly closed his eyes. A while later, he opened them, his eyes clear, \u201cShimei is correct. After the Sword Test Conference ends, where is Shimei planning to go?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cForge a sword.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Surprise came onto Gu Rong Ping\u2019s eyes, \u201cShimei found some cold magnets?\u201d</p><br/><p>Su\u2019s peaceful voice finally showed some emotion, \u201cEn, it\u2019s already been cut. Four pieces.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCongratulations Shimei!\u201d Gu Rong Ping\u2019s heart was even more fretful. If Shimei went to forge a sword, she probably won\u2019t come out in five years. His heart suddenly moved, \u201cIf this brother hasn\u2019t remembered it wrong, if the cold magnet is made into a sword, it has to first be made into a sword billet. But this processing\u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already found someone,\u201d Su\u2019s voice returned to its usual faintness, \u201cNo need for Shixiong to worry.\u201d</p><br/><p>At this time, Chao An\u2019s table erupted in laughter again.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, need to prepare for the match soon!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, only Brother Chao can slack off.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA zhuji guy. If Brother Chao uses more than three moves, this one will disdain you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t we make a wager? Wager on how many moves it will take Brother Chao to finish.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is good. I bet three moves!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI wager one!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay okay. Be generous and stop mocking me,\u201d Chao An bowed, \u201cI just said it. Look, even if I win, I won\u2019t get any benefits.\u201d</p><br/><p>The people jeered again.</p><br/><p>Gu Rong Ping had just hit a soft nail with Shimei and was angry. Hearing the crow chat, he was even more furious. A cold light flashed through his eyes. He was young, of extraordinary cultivation, and famed. He was usually favored in the sect. No one usually dared to be so outrageous in front of him. His face was instantly dark.</p><br/><p>He had just thought of standing up to teach this crowd a lesson when his eyes blurred. At some unknown time, Shimei had stood up.</p><br/><p>What did she want to do?</p><br/><p>\u201cI bet ten moves,\u201d Behind the light gauze, Su said faintly as she faced Chao An and the others. Her voice was not loud, but easily passed through the light gauze. This light gauze had isolation formations but they were not effective right now.</p><br/><p>The table instantly became silent. Chao An\u2019s face was frighteningly dark.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho, sir, are you? Please give a name,\u201d Chao An smiled insincerely as he raised his hands in a greeting. Being slapped in front of his friends, could Chao An tolerate it? Because there were isolation formations on the light gauze, they could only see that there were two people inside. However, they could not see or hear their appearance or the content of their words.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou do not have to know who I am. Bet, or no bet?\u201d Su said, unaffected.</p><br/><p>Gu Rong Ping was slightly surprised. Shimei was cold and indifferent. No one could be more clear about that than he was. She should not be interested in this kind of matter! But she was now wagering for someone else, this\u2026 \u2026</p><br/><p>What relationship did Shimei have with that person? Light rose in Gu Rong Ping\u2019s eyes, his expression was slightly interested.</p><br/><p>In front of so many people, if he didn\u2019t accept this bet, then Chao An\u2019s reputation would really sweep the floor. Couldn\u2019t defeat a zhuji with ten moves? The other was clearly trying to humiliate him!</p><br/><p>Chao An was extremely angry, but his voice was steady as he said, \u201cSince Sire has said it, then this one will accept it. What to bet?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnything,\u201d A faint voice came out of the light gauze pavilion.</p><br/><p>Chao An became even more certain the other was mocking him. A cold smile came out of his face. He took out a jade bottle and opened the stopper. Ling energy and a fragrant medicinal smell instantly spread in the air.</p><br/><p>The people in the surroundings felt their minds jump. Some that understood lingdan became restless.</p><br/><p>\u201cThird-grade Intense Fire Dan. There are thirty six of them,\u201d Intense Fire Dan was a lingdan that was a specialty of Fort Chao. The fire it contained was extremely domineering. It was a famous fire-type lingdan in Sky Moon Jie.</p><br/><p>An item flew out of the pavilion. Chao An\u2019s eyes focused and caught it.</p><br/><p>\u201cDying Flowing Moon, third-grade.\u201d</p><br/><p>The people seated couldn\u2019t keep still, and stood up, each one stretching their necks to look at the crystal bottle in Chao An\u2019s hands. The crystal bottle was clear and flawless. The bottle itself was not cheap. Inside the crystal bottle, there was a fingernail sized ball of faint misty fluid.</p><br/><p>Dying Flowing Moon. Supposedly, every ten years, there would be an extremely bright mid-autumn moon. Dying Flowing Moon was made from the moon light of that night. It was extremely valuable and rare!</p><br/><p>Just this little bottle of Dying Flowing Moon, its value far surpassed Chao An\u2019s Intense Fire Dan.</p><br/><p>Chao An\u2019s face was black.</p><br/><p>Translator Ramblings: I had the hardest time translating Dying Flowing Moon (the Chinese is ). There\u2019s a lot in this chapter. There is a mysterious person that Wei Sheng confronts. We get to see Zuo Mo\u2019s first opponent, Chao An, and one of Zuo Mo\u2019s former customers, Su. She\u2019s shown up twice before. Gu Rong Ping likes her~~~</p><br/>\n</div>"}

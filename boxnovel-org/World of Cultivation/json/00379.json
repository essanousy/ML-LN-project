Only things like souls could enter the Ten Finger Prison, money could not be taken in. But the method of transactions inside Ten Finger Prison had developed over the years, and everyone had naturally found a method.</p><br/><p>There were merchants that specialized in this kind of business.</p><br/><p>One only needed to go to these merchants to buy a type of soul that had a special soul imprint with money. In the Ten Finger Prison, these souls with special yao art imprints were akin to money. Only wealthy merchants could be involved in this kind of business. The souls that were used as money were seed souls born from special yao trees. The seed souls each merchant family used were different, and the spiritual imprint on the seed souls could effectively stop fraud.</p><br/><p>Some old businesses had a good reputation in this field.</p><br/><p>What Hong was hired to collect was this kind of seed soul.</p><br/><p>The little girl was a daring one. In the beginning, she had been scared to due Zuo Mo\u2019s reputation but she quickly became excited. When she saw the endless stream of people registering, she became even more excited.</p><br/><p>Cang Ze looked at the packed mass of registrants. His vision blackened and he almost fainted. When he saw the major yao channels with their logos, his scalp prickled and his consciousness almost shattered. No, he hopelessly shouted in silence from the bottom of his heart!</p><br/><p>Looking over it all, all the yao channels that he had heard of were present and there were even many he had not heard of.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is a bit too many!\u201d the black smoke yao said weakly. He swallowed. The amount of registrants far surpassed his expectations. A hint of regret formed. They had played it too big this time \u2026 \u2026</p><br/><p>The orange-haired yao wasn\u2019t nervous at all. He was very motivated, laughing with his hands on his hips. \u201cHa ha ha ha, this is fated to be the day that I become famous! I will quickly surpass you, Brother, feel the great pressure! Do not be nervous, I\u2019m very loyal, but I won\u2019t let you off!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo did not hear the orange-haired yao\u2019s words at all. There was only a jingshi ocean in his eyes, vast and rippling with an attractive light.</p><br/><p>Ooh ooh ooh, it was enchanting!</p><br/><p>By Zuo Mo\u2019s side, Nan Yue was slightly excited. She balled her fists, and made a resolution. She had to make money for Daren!</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>\u201cWho could have thought of it? Who could have thought of it? Just after Feng Xin Zi reconstructed the third prison, just as everyone is maintaining their silence due to their previous scorn of the Genius Alliance, Xiao Mo Ge made a move no one expected. This matter has been deflected dramatically into a new direction.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo matter how powerful the Genius Alliance is, Miss Ji Li Yu, and Mister Qinghua Zang Shui have all tripped when facing Xiao Mo Ge, and this blemish cannot be erased. At this time, people finally remember that the Genius Alliance has their eyes at the top of their heads did not get their face back from Xiao Mo Ge! Of course, maybe Miss Ji Li Yu and Mister Qinghua Zang Shui cannot represent the Genius Alliance.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf the two sides are facing off, then Xiao Mo Ge\u2019s move this time is shockingly sharp!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>Wearing a deep blue mask was covered with silver flower patterns and filled with a strange presence. At this moment, the eyes behind the mask were filled with coldness. Murderous intent flashed across the eyes, sharp as a blade\u2019s edge, but that pair of amber eyes quickly became calm like a deep lake.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Mo Ge \u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>A slow and light sigh sounded behind the mask like tendrils of smoke and did not dissipate for a long time.</p><br/><p>Her steps were slow, her upper body not moving at all as though she was sliding on ice. Her appearance was unspeakably elegant and ethereal.</p><br/><p>She glanced at the registration area that was tightly packed before turning to look at the completely transformed prison battlefield.</p><br/><p>\u201cHm!\u201d A light sound came from behind the mask. There was a thread of surprise in her eyes. Formations! Xiao Mo Ge was actually skilled in formations. She noted it down inside. After studying outside the prison battlefield for a few moment, she turned and walked towards the registration spot.</p><br/><p>Wherever she passed, the crowd seemed to be moved aside by an invisible hand and created a passageway.</p><br/><p>Some yao with fiery tempers turned and prepared to swear. When they saw the dark blue mask, their expressions changed, and the words that had reached their mouths were swallowed back down. Anything that could be brought into the Ten Finger Prison were treasures! On this yao\u2019s face was a soul mask. It was an extremely rare treasure. Those that possessed such a great treasure, if they were not rich, they were powerful!</p><br/><p>And when they saw the streaming figure of the masked female yao, their hearts jumped! They recognized power!</p><br/><p>Just like this, the masked female yao did not encounter any resistance and walked directly in front of Hong.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou want to register?\u201d Hong also noticed this unusual female yao and raised her head to ask.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d It was possible to hear from the voice coming from behind the mask, that this was a female yao. She threw out a seed soul.</p><br/><p>Hong took it and was slightly surprised. \u201cTwo hundred thousand! You want to make a direct challenge?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it not possible?\u201d the masked female yao asked.</p><br/><p>Pausing, Hong nodded hurriedly. \u201cPossible, possible.\u201d Then she shouted towards the inside of the formation, \u201cDaren, there is a person who is challenging you directly.\u201d</p><br/><p>After shouting, she said to the female yao, \u201cYou can go in. Don\u2019t worry, the formation will not attack you.\u201d</p><br/><p>The masked female yao walked steadily inside the prison battlefield. She did not seem to fear those strangely changing formations at all.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>\u201cFormations! Xiao Mo Ge actually knows formations?\u201d Su Wei turned his face with astonishment. \u201cThis guy does have some skills. I remember you\u2019ve always had an interest in formations. You didn\u2019t come to such a low-level place like the first prison just for this? And pulling me along as well. Bro, I\u2019m very busy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Jue Zi shook his head. \u201cI have only found out today that he knows formations. This guy is very strange.\u201d He said with deep meaning, \u201cHe can control this prison.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Su Wei\u2019s eyes widened suddenly. \u201cThat\u2019s impossible!\u201d</p><br/><p>He knew what controlling a prison meant.</p><br/><p>\u201cLook at the prison battlefield.\u201d Ming Jue Zi pointed at the completely transformed prison battlefield. \u201cThis place has completely changed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean anything.\u201d Su Wei did not believe it. His head shook like a rattle drum. \u201cHe reconstructed this prison and naturally has the home advantage. This degree of transformation does not prove anything.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Jue Zi did not argue. \u201cYou\u2019ll understand later.\u201d</p><br/><p>He thought back to the recording yao arts that he had been studying in recent days. He had bought them for a high price from a little yao called Jin Zhen. Jin Zhen had been involved in attacking Xiao Mo Ge that day, and the recording yao art recorded everything he had encountered that day.</p><br/><p>The deep and cryptic yao art problems on each pillar of the dazzling cage of light astonished him.</p><br/><p>He knew that Su Wei and the others didn\u2019t even have any attentions to look at a little yao that was muddling through the first prison. Previously, Su Wei had mocked him for wasting time on such a little personage, but as he studied more, the shock and puzzlement in Ming Jue Zi\u2019s heart accumulated.</p><br/><p>There were too many places that he could not understand and think through.</p><br/><p>He had read through a large amount of information to find something similar to the high-level yao arts that the two followers of Xiao Mo Ge had used that day. This discovery instantly attracted his attention, because these high level yao arts that were possibly a match were both lost a long time ago.</p><br/><p>He also researched the background of Xiao Mo Ge\u2019s two followers. What was worth celebrating was that while Xiao Mo Ge\u2019s origins were unknown, it was not hard to find the origins of the two followers.</p><br/><p>The male yao was from the Grey Clan, a clan that had declined. The female yao came from the South Sky Wisteria Clan, a yao clan that was almost extinct. The intelligent Ming Jue Zi quickly found something worthy of deep thought.</p><br/><p>Both the Grey Clan and the South Sky Arrow Clan were yao clans that could be traced back to three thousand years ago. The reason that the high level yao arts of the two clans were lost were strangely the same, they were lost in the great war three thousand years ago.</p><br/><p>The formations in front of him \u2026 \u2026 looked like a xiuzhe\u2019s seal formations.</p><br/><p>These unusual traces caused Xiao Mo Ge to become even more mysterious.</p><br/><p>But he did not tell any of this to Su Wei. There was too much speculations. He also believed that Xiao Mo Ge would shock Su Wei greatly.</p><br/><p>Su Wei was also wondering inside. Even though Ming Jue Zi did not focus on what he should be doing some of the time, but his intuition far surpassed normal yao. Did this Xiao Mo Ge really have something strange about him?</p><br/><p>Just at this time, he saw a familiar figure walking towards the prison battlefield from the corner of his eyes. His expression instantly became strange.</p><br/><p>\u201cYu Zi Zhou has come as well! Is this person going to go up?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Jue Zi saw that figure and stilled.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>\u201cBig Sis, you really aren\u2019t going to send someone?\u201d Ji Cheng suppressed the impulse to laugh and asked Ji Li Yu seriously.</p><br/><p>Ji Li Yu lightly snorted. \u201cSuch a small person, is he worthy of my attention?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe besmirched our Ji Family\u2019s reputation. How can we let him off?\u201d Ji Cheng pretended to be indignant as he said.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet him off?\u201d Ji Li Yu giggled. \u201cHe will quickly get a taste of trouble.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ji Cheng hurriedly asked. \u201cDoes Sis have some insider information?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou want to know?\u201d Ji Li Yu raised her eyelids.</p><br/><p>\u201cWant to know, want to know!\u201d Ji Cheng nodded rapidly. He was very curious. He had originally thought that Old Sis\u2019 was going to send an expert to teach this guy a lesson. The Ji Family did not lack for experts. Who would have expected that Old Sis\u2019 had ordered the clansmen not to go make trouble for Xiao Mo Ge.</p><br/><p>If he hadn\u2019t seen Old Sis\u2019 look as though she wanted to eat Xiao Mo Ge raw, he would have thought that Old Sis\u2019 was interested in Xiao Mo Ge.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m thirsty. Get me some Heart Moistening Fruits,\u201d Ji Li Yu casually said.</p><br/><p>\u201cI knew it. It\u2019s like this every time,\u201d Ji Cheng muttered. He obediently went to get the Heart Moistening Fruits and put them in front of Old Sis.</p><br/><p>Ji Li Yu opened a Heart Moistening Fruit. The glistening and tender flesh of the fruit and her long and white fingers formed a beautiful picture.</p><br/><p>\u201cYu Ji Zhou has pursued me for so many years. How can he let go of such a chance as this?\u201d Taking a small bite of the Heart Moistening Fruit, Ji Li Yu\u2019s expression was like a child eating candy in secret. \u201cEven though I do not like him, he is a good subordinate.\u201d</p><br/><p>Translator Ramblings: A lot of people really want Zuo Mo to get defeated. This upcoming bunch of chapters is going to be interesting. Ming Jue Zi probably isn\u2019t the only one that has the knowledge but he is so interested in \u201cXiao Mo Ge\u201d while the other people occupy themselves with \u201chigher\u201d pursuits.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

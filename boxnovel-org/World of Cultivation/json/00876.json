When they had parted, Shi\u2019s body had been split apart from the middle with one half being multi-colored. Yet right now, his body was like jade and released astounding vibrations. Only that shrivelled face was still familiar.</p><br/><p>Shi seemed even more powerful.</p><br/><p>But for some reason, Zuo Mo had a bad feeling. The stronger the person was, the greater their control over their power, and they would not easily leak their power outside. Shi seemed to be a fiercely burning flame. While hot, it gave Zuo Mo the feeling that it could not be maintained.</p><br/><p>When Zuo Mo\u2019s gaze accidentally swept across Shi\u2019s legs, he stilled. There was nothing under Shi\u2019s knees.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo stilled and stammered out a question. \u201cShi, your body \u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>In Zuo Mo\u2019s mind, Shi could do anything. No one was stronger than Shi, not even the Chief Elder of Tian Huan. How could someone so peerlessly strong become like this.</p><br/><p>Shi saw Zuo Mo and showed a smile. This caused his grey-white face to look strange and terrifying. \u201cI have lived long enough.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut \u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo opened his mouth but didn\u2019t know what to say. He suddenly realized that after spending ten thousand years in the Sealed Extinction Battlefield, was Shi\u2019s life about to reach an end?</p><br/><p>It had been more than ten years since they first met at the Battlefield of Sealed Extinction. The sun crystal seed that Shi had given him back then had saved his life many times. The sun crystal seed was the reason that he had achieved his cultivation.</p><br/><p>He remembered when they parted, Shi said he was going to find his homeland.</p><br/><p>As though he saw Zuo Mo\u2019s pain, gentleness flashed through Shi\u2019s eyes. He said with a smile, \u201cEven the strongest cannot withstand the march of time. I have lived longer than those of my era, there is nothing I am dissatisfied by, you do not need to be sad for me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo was silent. A moment later, he raised his head. \u201cShi, did you find your homeland?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is my homeland,\u201d Shi said with a laugh.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo stilled. \u201cAh, this is your homeland?\u201d Moments later, he suddenly realized and his expression froze on his face. He stammered out, \u201cYou you you \u2026 \u2026 are the Nether King?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shi saw Zuo Mo\u2019s shocked expression and laughed. \u201cIs this very strange?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo lost the ability to speak. He had never thought that Shi was the Nether King! But when he recovered from his shock, he felt that it was normal. To be able to silently unite the Nether Realm in such a short amount of time, Zuo Mo felt that no one other than Shi would have managed to accomplish it.</p><br/><p>Shi was very happy at shocking Zuo Mo so much. He examined Zuo Mo and said with surprise, \u201cYou have progressed very quickly, already god-level. Oh, you are wounded?\u201d</p><br/><p>After he said those last words, Shi\u2019s brow furrowed. \u201cIs there someone so strong right now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo narrated the matter with the Chief Elder of Tian Huan in detail. Shi listened and nodded as he said, \u201cNo wonder, your luck is good. Do not worry, this place is suited for healing. I can see that you have already some understanding of this. The true meaning of nether is not death, but life. This is the shen methodology I cultivated in the past. In my hands, it has been refined and perfected. Take a look. It will be of help to your recovery. However, there is no need to cultivate it. The nether shen power and your sun shen power will conflict.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then he swept a look across the shen wood coffins and said, \u201cYour luck is really good to find the Ten Thousand Life Shen wood! I can help you wake them up.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Zuo Mo was overjoyed. He widened his eyes. \u201cYou can awaken them?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cActually, you have already started on the right path,\u201d Shi explained. \u201cHowever, your comprehension is shallow. If you want to wake them, you will need ten years if you study the shen methodology I give you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTen years \u2026 \u2026\u201d Zuo Mo faltered and hurriedly said, \u201cThen you do it!\u201d</p><br/><p>Shi\u2019s gaze was burning and with a hint of mirth. Then his expression became serious. \u201cThen you have to promise me some things.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAs long as I can accomplish them, anything!\u201d Zuo Mo patted his chest. Actually, even if Shi did not help him and needed his help, he would do it.</p><br/><p>Shi said, \u201cWhen your wounds heal, you will truly be god-level. While you have just entered god-level, you are now barely acceptable as the successor to my position.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh!\u201d Zuo Mo was dumbstruck. A moment later, he said slowly, \u201cYou mean Nether King?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Shi nodded and said, \u201cI spent so much power to unite them. I do not want them to divide after I die.\u201d</p><br/><p>After saying this, Shi looked wryly at Zuo Mo. \u201cYou have gotten a great bargain. Mo Cloud Sea and the Nether Realm, you have the ability to conquer the world.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo scratched his head. \u201cTheoretically, I did benefit. But, why me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Shi roared with laughter and then said seriously, \u201cThere are several reasons. One, you have the ability, god-level power, and the support of Mo Cloud Sea. You have the ability to establish yourself on the throne. I do not want the Nether Realm to turn into chaos after my death. Secondly, you are not a bad person. Mo Cloud Sea has been good under your rule. You have no bias against the mo, I do not have to worry about that. Third, you have good luck.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo still felt as though he was in a dream. Good fortunate had come too fast and suddenly.</p><br/><p>\u201cPower is meaningless to me. The reason I united the Nether Realm was because this is my homeland,\u201d Shi said coolly.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo\u2019s mind quickly cleared. He said with slight disbelief. \u201cOutside, Eastern Nether Mansion and the Yin Tomb Guards are fighting fiercely. Are you going to sit by and watch?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo kind of happiness comes without experiencing pain,\u201d Shi said coolly. He glanced at Zuo Mo. \u201cI have made arrangements.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo suddenly realized. \u201cI understand. You set this up, you just want to see who is going to meet your expectations, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shi smiled but did not reply. He said, \u201cRecover first. Once you recover, there might be a need for you to appear.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d Zuo Mo felt the same. If he could recover completely, he would be of greater help to Shi.</p><br/><p>He actually had many more things he did not say. Shi\u2019s legs under the kneecap were gradually dissipating as though there was an invisible mouth slowly consuming Shi\u2019s body. Zuo Mo knew that Shi\u2019s life was really at an end. None of this could be stopped.</p><br/><p>Even Zuo Mo who had god-level cultivation felt was terrified at this kind of complete and unstoppable destruction.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo felt extremely distressed.</p><br/><p>While he knew that even the strongest would die one day; while he knew that Shi who had lived for tens of thousands of years was calm and peaceful, and had already seen to everything.</p><br/><p>But why was he still sad? Why was he still feeling pain?</p><br/><p>In his last throes, Shi was probably at the strongest he\u2019d ever been in his life because his life was being burned to the end. Shi did not calmly wait for the arrival of death and chose to burn his remaining lifespan at the end.</p><br/><p>What did Shi want to do?</p><br/><p>He must have some wish he wanted to complete?</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo didn\u2019t know but he could clearly feel that Shi had indescribable and deep feelings for this land.</p><br/><p>Homeland?</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo thought silently. This term was unfamiliar to him.</p><br/><p>But no matter what, he would use all of his power to help Shi complete his last wishes.</p><br/><p>Shi taught Zuo Mo the important points of creating life out of death. Zuo Mo listened carefully. After just a while, Zuo Mo felt he had gained a lot. Shi\u2019s skill in this level was much greater than Zuo Mo. Every one of his words were to the point and Zuo Mo was entranced.</p><br/><p>Shi spoke for three whole days.</p><br/><p>In these three days, Shi\u2019s light grew even brighter, his presence even stronger. He was like a burning flame that no one could look directly at.</p><br/><p>Yet, Shi\u2019s knees had now disappeared.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo forced down his grief as he worked to repair his body.</p><br/><p>The death energy pools had accumulated the pure death energy after countless eons in the death eye. After Shi\u2019s teachings, Zuo Mo quickly found the crux. He quickly found that the vitality that came from the water in the death energy pools was purer than the vitality from the Nether Ghost Yin Heavy Wood.</p><br/><p>His wounds would quickly recover.</p><br/><p>Shi sat on the throne and was in a daze.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you afraid?\u2019 Shi suddenly asked Sand Puppet.</p><br/><p>Sand Puppet rumbled, \u201cNot afraid.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I die, you will also die,\u201d Shi said.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s die,\u201d Sand Puppet said.</p><br/><p>\u201cMetal Ox, how long have you followed me?\u201d Shi turned his face to ask.</p><br/><p>The iron ox tilted his head and thought for a while before saying, \u201cTwelve thousand and forty two years.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMore than ten thousand years, time has passed so quickly,\u201d Shi lamented. He suddenly said, \u201cIf I want you all to live?\u201d</p><br/><p>Five gazes suddenly locked onto him. The temperature in the hall suddenly dropped and the hall was filled with murderousness.</p><br/><p>Shi roared with laughter. \u201cAlright, you will feel life is dull and become bored if you continue to live. Since that\u2019s the case, then let us do something together.\u201d</p><br/><p>The murderousness disappeared.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s come,\u201d Black Mist suddenly said.</p><br/><p>\u201cHave him come in,\u201d Shi said coolly. In this moment, he was the authoritative Nether King.</p><br/><p>The incomer saw Shi and was overcome with excitement, kneeling to the floor. \u201cKing!\u201d</p><br/><p>His voice was choked and filled with excitement. \u201cGreat! Great! King! King is fine! Fine!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStand up,\u201d Shi said coolly.</p><br/><p>He looked at the large man in front of him. This tattooed large man was one of the four nether lords, An Mo who ruled the Western Jail Mansion.</p><br/><p>\u201cAn Mo, you worked hard recently,\u201d Shi said calmly.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis subordinate is not burdened,\u201d An Mo shook his head and said with worry, \u201cKing, Eastern Nether Mansion and the Yin Tomb Guards are fighting intensely. The fatalities on both sides are high. Should we interfere?\u201d</p><br/><p>As he said this, his eyes were bright, and he didn\u2019t look as though he was injured at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cI knew of Jia Man\u2019s ambitions a long time ago,\u201d Shi said coolly. \u201cYou Zhe was also within my expectations. But Hai Xin Bing has disappointed me.\u201d</p><br/><p>An Mo\u2019s heart felt a wave of coldness. He knew that King had announced Jia Man and Hai Xin Bing\u2019s death sentences. As long as King was alive, no one could defeat King, not even the four Nether Lords put together.</p><br/><p>\u201cKing, give the order! All of Western Jail Mansion is sleeping with their weapons by their beds, and can move at any moment,\u201d An MO said loudly.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait a few more days, you will meet the next Nether King.\u201d Shi was unaffected. He then glanced at An Mo. \u201cI hope that you will assist my successor just like you have assisted me.\u201d</p><br/><p>An Mo\u2019s body shook and he exclaimed, \u201cThe next Nether King?\u201d</p><br/><p>Translator Ramblings: The greatest freebie Zuo Mo ever got.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

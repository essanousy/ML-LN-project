Some students were not afraid and did not care. So what if they could not find a job in Xu Ling City? They could travel to other cities. As long as they cultivated good spells, where couldn\u2019t they find a job?</p><br/><p>But not every student had such courage and not every person was willing to run to an unfamiliar city and start a new life.</p><br/><p>The number of people in Turtle Island Cultivation Class had instantly lessened.</p><br/><p>Having been contemplating on how to expand the classes, Zuo Mo was dumbstruck. It had just been a few days, how come it was like this?</p><br/><p>He hurriedly sent Shang Wei Ming to investigate. The businesses thought they were extremely strong and did not disguise anything. Shang Wei Ming quickly came back with news. When Zuo Mo learned it was the Tian Family again, he instantly became angry!</p><br/><p>We haven\u2019t even settled the ambush last time, and you come to challenge us again!</p><br/><p>How can this be tolerated?</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo had planned on letting Pu Yao torment the Tian Family, but now he rolled up his sleeves and decided to act himself!</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo was clueless and couldn\u2019t think of good ways to make money, but if he was thinking about doing devious things, Zuo Mo seemed to be shot up with adrenaline and instantly became excited!</p><br/><p>Ge really isn\u2019t a good person!</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo sighed emotionally and then threw himself into the grand matter of exacting vengeance on the Tian Family. But upon reflection, Zuo Mo felt this was not something bad. With their manpower, expansion of the classes was akin to seeking death. The cultivation classes were much quieter than before but that was only when compared with the explosive in increase in attendance. There were many xiuzhe who did not worry about being blocked out and they were overjoyed at having the free spots in class.</p><br/><p>Even more importantly, the excited Zuo Mo thought of a wondrous idea.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>\u201cIs there something you need?\u201d The person receiving Zuo Mo was a middle-aged man.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, I want to discuss a partnership with your sect,\u201d Zuo Mo said.</p><br/><p>\u201cPartnership?\u201d The middle-aged male\u2019s eyes lit up. Business!</p><br/><p>Earth Sound Sect was a small sect. Their most famous product was the large sound tablet formation that could broadcast across the entire city. The male at the front of the store was their sect leader, Yin Ling Zi.</p><br/><p>If Yin Ling Zi was not clever and creative the Earth Sound Sect would have died out long ago. Through his efforts the sound tablet program [Earth Sound] was produced in an interesting manner, and had a broad audience in Xu Ling City.</p><br/><p>But their present days were not easy. The popularity of their [Earth Sound] program was slowly declining. This caused a great headache for him but he did not have many solutions. Xu Ling City was still a small place, Earth Sound Sect was also a small sect. He could create higher-grade sound tablet formations, but he could not afford it. Also, the expenditure of higher grade sound tablet formations was also astounding.</p><br/><p>Yin Ling Zi instantly became warm and had a smile on his face, \u201cPlease come in, please come in!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo\u2019s group walked into Earth Sound Sect, and Yin Ling Zi carefully took out his last bits of ling tea and brewed it.</p><br/><p>After sitting down and taking a sip of ling tea, Zuo Mo stated his intentions, \u201cI have come this time in the hope we can use the [Earth Sound] program your sect broadcasts to advertise the products of our island.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo problem, no problem!\u201d Yin Ling Zi was overjoyed and still asked out of caution, \u201cWhat cloud island is your island?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo smiled. \u201cWe are Turtle Island!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTurtle Island!\u201d Yin Ling Zi\u2019s expression changed dramatically and thoughts of refusal rose. How could he not know the conflict between Turtle Island and the Tian Family? The Tian Family was the second largest faction in Xu Ling City, ranked under Xu Ling Sect, the depth of its foundation was far bigger than an outsider like Turtle Island!</p><br/><p>If they offended the Tian Family, a little sect like Earth Sound Sect\u2019s days would be at an end.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Your sect will not accept this business?\u201d Zuo Mo smiled thinly at Yin Ling Zi.</p><br/><p>Yin Ling Zi hadn\u2019t spoke when he saw Zuo Mo casually put something on the table. When he saw what it was, Yin Ling Zi\u2019s eyes could not move away.</p><br/><p>Ten pieces of fourth-grade jingshi!</p><br/><p>Yin Ling Zi\u2019s eyes instantly became heated as he stared at the ten pieces of fourth-grade jingshi on the table!</p><br/><p>For Earth Sound Sect, ten pieces of fourth-grade jingshi was about half of their annual income. Yin Ling Zi knew his sect was in dire straits, it was to the point they were almost destitute, and could barely afford to buy food. If they could not create more revenue, they wouldn\u2019t even have the jingshi to maintain the large sound tablet formation.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo heard the sound of Yin Ling Zi swallowing. Without a second word, he took out another ten pieces of fourth-grade jingshi!</p><br/><p>Yin Ling Zi\u2019s breathing became heavy, his eyes instantly filled with blood and his expression slightly vicious.</p><br/><p>Twenty pieces of fourth-grade jingshi!</p><br/><p>\u201cThis will be the thirty percent deposit.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo\u2019s words were like a fatal dagger that easily pierced Yin Ling Zi\u2019s wavering defenses.</p><br/><p>Yin Ling Zi felt his mind suddenly become blank.</p><br/><p>He leapt at the jingshi!</p><br/><p>What Tian Family! They can go to hell!</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>Zhu Zheng\u2019s mood was strange, he had a particular sense of ennui.</p><br/><p>His workmates watched him, each gleeful at his misfortune. Just a few days ago, all of them looked at him with completely different gazes. As one of the members of the first batch of students in the Turtle Island Cultivation Classes, he had had shockingly good luck. When the spot for a cultivation class was being auctioned off at a sky-high prices on the black market. While others could only sit in the alleys and listen, he was sitting in the hall and listening to Teacher Cheng\u2019s husbandry class. That was really a great happiness.</p><br/><p>Yet what he had never expected was the shopkeeper had quickly found him and told him if he continued to attend the Turtle Island Cultivation Class, he would be fired.</p><br/><p>Helpless, he could only leave the cultivation class to keep his work.</p><br/><p>The admiring and jealous gazes of the surrounding people instantly became gleeful.</p><br/><p>Yet what Zhu Zheng had not expected was that the spells and formations that Teacher Cheng spoke about in class would unconsciously creep into his thoughts. Zhu Zhen had attended many cultivation classes before and Teacher Cheng\u2019s skill would be ranked first. He held admiration for Teacher Cheng. Just those high level spells that Teacher Cheng spoke about casually filled him with motivation.</p><br/><p>He seemed to be daydreaming constantly this days and was inattentive with his work. The shopkeeper had scolded him many times over this.</p><br/><p>Why was it like this \u2026 \u2026 Zhu Zhen really felt bad inside. He felt that the Turtle Island Cultivation Class was very good.</p><br/><p>Life had returned to normal. Zhu Zhen knew that the dissatisfaction in in his heart would dissipate with time and be worn down.</p><br/><p>Everyone worked in the same place and due to the work being repetitive and boring, they would have a sound tablet to listen to when they worked. The shopkeeper had seen that it did not distract them so he had not forbidden it.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, the content broadcasted by the sound tablet caused Zhu Zhen to stop what he was doing.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 \u2026 Due to too many students being unable to enter our island\u2019s cultivation class, we feel great regret and also blame ourselves!

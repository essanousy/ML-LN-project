Zuo Mo felt as though his ears were filled with the sound of the horn.</p><br/><p>This moaning horn seemed to have a magical power to reach people\u2019s minds. Zuo Mo\u2019s body uncontrollably trembled and the blood in his body suddenly turned hot.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo jumped in fright!</p><br/><p>As expected from the horn of the first mo king. With his god-level cultivation, he was still unable to withstand its power.</p><br/><p>At this time, the dark gold bead inside Zuo Mo\u2019s body suddenly lit up. Packed sun shen glyphs appeared on the surface of the ball. It was that drop of golden bone marrow that Zuo Mo had extracted from the dark gold femur of the ancient expert. Stimulated by the horn of the first king, it immediately activated! Its power that was mixed with burning sun shen flow quickly spread into Zuo Mo\u2019s limbs.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo\u2019s mind quickly calmed down.</p><br/><p>However, the change just now still frightened Zuo Mo. He found that he was acting far too rash. His body had not recovered. If he encountered danger, there really would not be anyone that could save him.</p><br/><p>He had been too rash!</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo was still full of fear.</p><br/><p>At this time, the light released by the dark golden ball was stopping the horn. Zuo Mo couldn\u2019t resist but examine it.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo had never seen these shen glyphs on the inside the horn. Zuo Mo believed some of the rumors now. The sound of the horn caused the blood inside his body to suddenly heat up. He had the blood of a mo. Did the horn of the first mo king truly possess the ability to use the power of mo blood?</p><br/><p>Even though Zuo Mo was used to seeing all kinds of treasures, he still found it incomprehensible.</p><br/><p>It was common knowledge that the bloodlines of the mo contained great power. This was something that every mo knew. But what really was the power that existed in their blood? No one understood. People only knew that the families that had ancient blood would have greater power in their blood than ordinary people. Also, the purer the blood, the greater the power of the bloodline.</p><br/><p>If there was an item that could directly control or affect the power that existed in the blood, it would be terrifying!</p><br/><p>Thinking back carefully, it seemed as though Pu Yao and Wei didn\u2019t know the location of the King\u2019s Horn.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo suppressed his shock and broke his mind free of the King\u2019s Horn. Even though he now had god-level cultivation, there were still so many things to explore in the world.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo opened his eyes. He lowered his head to examine the horn of the first mo king, and he stilled.</p><br/><p>The horn which had been blackened and dim before was completely changed. There were fine dark red patterns covering the long horn. It was a ancient and mysterious totem character that was as red as blood.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo recognized this character.</p><br/><p>King!</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo seemed to be struck by lightning as he looked dazedly at the completely transformed long horn in his hand.</p><br/><p>What \u2026 \u2026 what was this?</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo thought dazedly for a long time but still did not understand.</p><br/><p>The warm feeling that came from the long horn his hand and the ancient and desolate presence caused it to appear mysterious and magnificent.</p><br/><p>Was \u2026 \u2026 this the true King\u2019s Horn?</p><br/><p>When this thought appeared in Zuo Mo\u2019s mind, he could not expel it. This grand and exquisite long horn, and that bloody red king mark inscribed matched the descriptions of the King\u2019s Horn in the legends.</p><br/><p>There were faint vibrations that came from the dark red horn that seemed to be the sky that looked down on the world.</p><br/><p>King\u2019s Horn!</p><br/><p>This was the real King\u2019s Horn!</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo was overjoyed. For Little Mo Ge, as long as it was a treasure, he liked it. The more valuable and rare a treasure was, the more he liked it. He could not move his hand away from caressing the King\u2019s Horn. This time, he had really profited!</p><br/><p>The King\u2019s Horn. The legendary ultimate treasure that was said to dominate all mo. What was the saying? Oh oh, the symbol of power and might, haha, it was great!</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo was overcome with joy.</p><br/><p>The King\u2019s Horn of the legends was able to led the mo and conquer the world. Zuo Mo thought that it would not be as powerful as the legends said, but it probably was a treasure that could lead an army.</p><br/><p>After some thought, Zuo Mo suppressed his restless heart. He decided to wait for his shen power to recover before he tried.</p><br/><p>Alright, he would recover very soon, Zuo Mo comforted himself.</p><br/><p>His days became peaceful again. On one hand, he used the Nether Ghost Yin Heavy Wood to repair his body. On the other, he forged shen equipment and the pseudo-shen devices for the five ghosts.</p><br/><p>Actually, with the wealth of the five ghosts, shen devices could be forged. However, it was too much for Zuo Mo to forge shen devices, given his injuries and the short time frame. Pseudo-shen devices were much easier.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo did not feel as though he had anything to do with the fighting between Eastern Nether mansion and the Yin Tomb Guards. Yet what he had not expected that he would be affected as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no more Nether Ghost Yin Heavy Wood?\u201d Zuo Mo frowned. The importance of the Nether Ghost Yin Heavy wood did not have to be said. Without it, the time needed to repair his body would increase greatly.</p><br/><p>Little Guard Huo had a distressed expression. \u201cOur business relationships with the outside have been cut off. Eastern Nether Mansion learned that Grandmaster needs Nether Ghost Yin Heavy Wood and they managed to buy it all first. We have used up all of our stores of Nether Ghost Yin Heavy Wood.\u201d</p><br/><p>This change immediately disrupted Zuo Mo\u2019s plan. He asked gravely, \u201cWhat about the substitute materials?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEastern Nether Mansion got ahead of us as well,\u201d Little Guard Huo said in a low voice. \u201cEveryone is preparing for war right now. The number of people going out to harvest has been reduced.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Yin Tomb Guards were greatly lacking compared to Eastern Nether mansion in terms of doing business. While they had been searching to buy all this time, they did not manage to buy much, and Eastern Nether Mansion got ahead of them.</p><br/><p>\u201cI understand.\u201d Zuo Mo nodded.</p><br/><p>Little Guard Huo raised his head and opened his mouth to speak. However, he did not manage to say anything and left dispiritedly.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo\u2019s plan was completely ruined. He had healed to the twenty second level of thirty six levels. There were still fourteen levels to go. In terms of progress, this was fast enough. However, Zuo Mo had thought that he would quickly recover, and hadn\u2019t expected to encounter trouble here.</p><br/><p>Little Guard Huo had not lied. Materials like the Nether ghost Yin Heavy Wood grew in extreme environments. Only experts would be able to harvest them. But right now, with the battle upcoming, the Yin Tomb Guards could not send experts to harvest Nether Ghost Yin Heavy Wood.</p><br/><p>As expected, the road to happiness was a bumpy one!</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo did not feel restless. After wandering the endless void for a decade, he had learned patience.</p><br/><p>The Yin Tomb Ghost Lord could not be relied on. But when he thought about it, the benefits that Zuo Mo had gotten from them surpassed what he had given.</p><br/><p>So even if there was no Nether ghost Yin Heavy Wood, Zuo Mo still did his best to forge shen equipment and pseudo-shen devices for them.</p><br/><p>When the war finally started, Zuo Mo had forged about three hundred sets of shen equipment. This number astounded everyone who learned of it. Three thousand sets of shen equipment. This used up most of the Yin Tomb Guard\u2019s materials. The materials could not keep up with the progress, something like this actually happened.</p><br/><p>The pseudo-shen weapons of the Yin Tomb Five Ghosts were also successfully completed. Zuo Mo had forged five completely different pseudo-shen weapons according to their specialities.</p><br/><p>While ten years had passed, and everyone\u2019s average shen power had risen a level, the number of shen device raiments had not changed greatly, even in the xiuzhe world.</p><br/><p>The xiuzhe world was held back by a lack of materials, and the yaomo were held back by a lack of skilled forgers.</p><br/><p>The yaomo were not stupid. While they did not have top forgers that could forge shen devices, they still did all they could to gather top level materials. They would never sell them. Therefore, materials that could be used to make shen device raiments would never appear on the market.</p><br/><p>This formed a unique situation. The forgers of the xiuzhe world were hampered by a lack of top materials. The yaomo experts held onto their top materials. They were willing to let them rot rather than sell them.</p><br/><p>Five pseudo-shen weapons. In the Nether Realm, they were definitely top level. The power of the Yin Tomb Five Ghosts grew with them.</p><br/><p>Including the Yin Tomb Five Ghosts, the higher ups of the Yin tomb Guard was filled with confidence in this war. They had three thousand sets of shen equipment that was akin to giving wings to a tiger, the Yin Tomb Guard. Also, the five pseudo-shen weapons increased their confidence.</p><br/><p>They were filled with reverence and awe towards Zuo Mo. They had never heard of anyone that could forge three thousand shen equipment of such quickly within one month on their own.</p><br/><p>It was terrifying!</p><br/><p>The existence of a person could change a war!</p><br/><p>Armed to their teeth, the Yin Tomb Guards were filled with hope for the future. The only regret was the Yin Tomb Ghost Lord. His plan to obtain a shen device was ruined due to a lack of materials. At this time, no one was willing to sell top level materials to the Yin Tomb Guards.</p><br/><p>However, what comforted him was Zuo Mo still gifted him a pseudo-shen device in thanks for the dark gold femur.</p><br/><p>After doing all this, Zuo Mo prepared to explore the death eye of the Sea of Ten Thousand Boiling Pools.</p><br/><p>There was not enough Nether ghost Yin Heavy Wood so Zuo Mo thought of another method. Since the Nether Ghost Yin Heavy Wood was useful because the death energy purified the strands of vitality, then he would try and do the same.</p><br/><p>While the effect might be as good as the Nether Ghost Yin Heavy Wood, but sitting around and waiting was not Zuo Mo\u2019s style. Creating life from death was a problem that Zuo Mo had considered for a long time and he had learned some things.</p><br/><p>He wanted to try and see if he could forge life out of death.</p><br/><p>If he could succeed, no longer relying on the Nether Ghost Yin Heavy Good was just one of the benefits. It also meant that his skill in life and death would reach an unprecedented height for him.</p><br/><p>Creating life out of death. He needed to find a land of death. The first that Zuo Mo thought of was the death eye in the Sea of Ten Thousand Boiling Pools.</p><br/><p>There was no place where death energy was greater than there!</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo was a decisive person. After thinking about it, he felt it was plausible and decided to try.</p><br/><p>He arranged for Qing Xiao to keep teaching the Wu Clan Members and to wait for him to return. Qing Xiao was unhappy but accepted it. The pitiful Wu Clan members did not know what they were about to face was the ghastly training arranged by a Qing Xiao while he was in a terrible mood.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo informed the Yin Tomb Ghost Lord. The Yin Tomb Ghost Lord tried to persuade him otherwise, but seeing Zuo Mo\u2019s determination, he did not persist. He agreed to look after Qing Xiao and the wu Clan.</p><br/><p>The Yin Tomb Ghost Lord had no attention to spare for Zuo Mo because the fighting at the front had become intense.</p><br/><p>All of Zuo Mo\u2019s attention was focused on this trip to the death eye. He made sufficient preparations.</p><br/><p>Silly Bird and all the other assistants were present to guard against the danger that had appeared last time. He was pulling the five shen wood coffins himself. The death eye was the place that was best suited for the shen wood coffins to be nourished. He believed that with the density of death energy at the death eye, Eldest Shixiong and the others might wake up earlier.</p><br/><p>Just like this, Zuo Mo dragged the five shen wood coffins and followed his previous path towards the depths of the death eye.</p><br/><p>Translator Ramblings: Ah, poor Zuo Mo. He was wrong.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

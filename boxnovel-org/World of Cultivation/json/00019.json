It is used to ease their absorption of star power during the day by forcing the world to twist, and give them access to energy from the stars.\u201d The one who spoke was the silver clad man. He continued in a grave tone, \u201cOnly when they have no choice would a yaomo do such a thing. It seems the situation of this yaomo isn\u2019t good, it is very possible they are seriously wounded and need star power to recover, so they were forced to twist the world.\u201d</p><br/><p>As he spoke, his voice relaxed and the others relaxed their expressions.</p><br/><p>\u201cA yaomo able to create Stars in Daytime, they definitely are one of the strongest yaomo. They\u2019ve only ever appeared in the war three thousand years ago. I hadn\u2019t thought that there would be such a powerful yaomo hidden away here.\u201d He sighed.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo what if he\u2019s powerful? Isn\u2019t he still going to end up in our hands?\u201d The yellow-robed Taoist said in a screeching voice, \u201cHe he, the heart of a sky yao or black mo, if it is added into the sword, my flying sword would increase quite a few levels!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, the eyes of this yaomo is very rare. It naturally can see through anything.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026 \u2026</p><br/><p>The crowd instantly became excited as though they had already caught that amazing yaomo.</p><br/><p>For xiuzhe, a high level yaomo\u2019s body was a treasure. Almost all the body parts could be used for forging or dan-making and were all rare items. This group had gathered together for this yaomo. A powerful yao who was seriously wounded was a prey that they all coveted.</p><br/><p>Seeing everyone\u2019s mood, the silver-clad man cautioned, \u201cEveryone, we shouldn\u2019t rejoice pre-emptively. Haven\u2019t you realized that there are many other people after it as well?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo what if there are others? Who dares to compete with us?\u201d The yellow-robed cultivator said irritably in a high voice, murderous intent thick in his eyes. Viciousness flashed in the eyes of the other people.</p><br/><p>The silver-clad man said, \u201cEveryone should have seen that ship today. A sixth grade treasure ship, it is a rare talisman. If anyone had taken a close look at the tail of the wing boat, you should have seen their emblem.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhose emblem?\u201d The yellow-robed Taoist said suspiciously. When he saw that winged boat today, even he had been slightly shocked.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Master of Bright Wave Jie.\u201d The silver-clad male said slowly. Everyone instantly became silent as terror made its way across many of their faces.</p><br/><p>The expression of the yellow-robed Taoist also changed slightly but he quickly recovered and shrieked, \u201cDon\u2019t speak nonsense. The Master of Bright Wave Jie had been in seclusion for over sixty years. How could he come to a little place like Sky Moon Jie?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI only saw the emblem. In the past, I had spent some time in Bright Wave Jie and remember the emblem.\u201d The silver-clad male said calmly.</p><br/><p>Seeing the terror on everyone\u2019s faces, he said with a smile, \u201cEveryone, don\u2019t worry too much. The Master of Bright Wave Jie has not involved himself in common affairs for many years. It\u2019s unlikely that he came. Most likely it is his disciple or subordinate.\u201d</p><br/><p>The faces of everyone else relaxed. One of them said, \u201cAs long as it isn\u2019t the Master of Bright Wave Jie, I\u2019m not afraid.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, yes!\u201d The other people agreed.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy would Bright Wave Jie interfere in this matter?\u201d The yellow robed cultivator\u2019s brow furrowed.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder, don\u2019t forget, Sky Moon Jie is under the jurisdiction of Bright Wave Jie. This little brother knows that Stars in Daytime occurred, then it isn\u2019t strange that they would also know.\u201d The silver clad male said.</p><br/><p>Suddenly the faces of the yellow robed Taoist and the silver clad male changed slightly and they yelled simultaneously, \u201cWho!\u201d</p><br/><p>The two rushed outside like a sword. There was nothing outside in the yard. The yellow robed Taoist flew into the sky and scanned the surroundings before returning. He shook his head at the silver clad male. Both of them had serious and solemn expressions, nothing remained of their previous ease.</p><br/><p>The other people all ran out to ask about the situation. By now, the two had resumed their normal expressions. The silver clad male said, \u201cNothing, nothing, just a false alarm.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing this, the people released a breath and conversed as they walked back into the room. The yellow robed Taoist followed last. Before re-entering, he glanced back before following.</p><br/><p>A moment later, in a shadowed corner, a figure silently appeared. It was the white-clothed Lin Qian.</p><br/><p>He revealed a pondering expression before disappearing.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>In the Dong Fu Hall, everyone had gathered together. Tian Song Zi, as the local leader, sat at the head with Yu Bai standing by his side. Below him, six people sat and leisurely drank tea.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis time, we are really troubling you.\u201d The one that spoke was a beautiful matron. Clear eyes, white teeth, and extremely graceful. On her shoulder, there was a little light yellow bird that curiously examined the others.</p><br/><p>\u201cYun Xia[i] xianzi[ii] is too courteous.\u201d Tian Song Zi said with a laugh, \u201cTo have so many fellow experts come to my humble place, this one is very honoured. It is a little place. If there is something that we cannot fulfill well, everyone, please forgive us.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt will be fine.\u201d Everyone raised their hands in a greeting.</p><br/><p>Tian Song Zi\u2019s expression was worried as he continued, \u201cI\u2019m not going to conceal it from everyone. Since the appearance of Stars in Daytime, my heart hasn\u2019t felt steady. I may be inexperienced, but I do know that this isn\u2019t any kind of a good omen. I feel much more secure now that everyone has come today.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to worry.\u201d Yun Xia xianzi comforted, \u201cMaster Yuan is skilled at detecting presences and is very sensitive to yaomo. He will definitely find where the yaomo is hiding.\u201d</p><br/><p>At this point, Master Yuan hurriedly said, \u201cYun Xia xianzi is too complimentary.\u201d</p><br/><p>While respectfully standing to side, Yu Bai was very shocked inside. The people sitting here all had significant cultivation. The one that attracted his attention the most was the little girl who had been sitting with a bowed head at the end. Her age appeared almost the same as his, but her cultivation was indecipherable to him. He who had always been proud of his accomplishments felt uncomfortable inside. There were too many geniuses in this world!</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013</p><br/><p>Pu Yao looked extremely poor.</p><br/><p>He sat on the gravestone, his face was pale and appeared to be exhausted like a flickering lamp. Zuo Mo instantly was scared. The invincible Pu Yao, why was he suddenly in this state?</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo carefully went closer, \u201cPu, what\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><br/><p>Pu Yao opened his eye to look at Zuo Mo. His voice was very calm, and just as confident as usually and asked in exchange, \u201cWhat what?\u201d Zuo Mo noticed that Pu Yao\u2019s alluring crimson blood eye was much fainter than usual, and even his voice seemed weaker.</p><br/><p>But for some reason, when he heard Pu Yao\u2019s confident voice, Zuo Mo felt safe.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it that you don\u2019t have enough jingshi?\u201d Zuo Mo couldn\u2019t help but ask in concern. He didn\u2019t know why he was so concerned about Pu Yao. Logically, the other was a yaomo. The earlier he died the better, but seeing Pu Yao\u2019s state, Zuo Mo couldn\u2019t help but ask in concern.</p><br/><p>Looking at Zuo Mo again, Pu Yao seemed to be surprised by Zuo Mo\u2019s question.</p><br/><p>\u201cWant to help me?\u201d Pu Yao\u2019s eyebrow rose.</p><br/><p>\u201cHm.\u201d Zuo Mo muddled a response noncommittally. He had learned.</p><br/><p>Pu Yao suddenly smiled, \u201cI\u2019ll take you to a place.\u201d</p><br/><p>Pu Yao proceeded to take out a few pieces of jingshi. On the ground, he began to make a seal formation that Zuo Mo had never seen before.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo might have never seen the seal formation, but this jingshi, he was familiar with, wasn\u2019t it\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>He touched his body and his expression changed. This damned renyao, he took my jingshi again! Before he could speak, light suddenly appeared in front of his eyes. He couldn\u2019t help but close his eyes. When he opened his eyes again, he was dumbstruck.</p><br/><p>\u201cPu, where is this?\u201d He stammered his question.</p><br/><p>It was dark and shadowy in front of him. He could feel cold granite under his feet. What was flowing in a nearby stream was fresh red blood. Was this Hell? Zuo Mo forced himself to swallow, his mind tense as he looked at the surroundings.</p><br/><p>Pu Yao groaned in pleasure. He spread out his arms, his face intoxicated, completely void of his previous exhaustion.</p><br/><p>\u201cSword cave.\u201d Pu Yao returned to his lazy state. He stuck out his bright red tongue, his eyes bright as he licked his lips, \u201cThere are many souls here. Such delicious souls!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSword cave?\u201d Zuo Mo blanked. He had lived in Wu Kong Sword Sect for two years and he had heard of the sword cave before. Wasn\u2019t Wei Sheng Shixiong in the sword cave?</p><br/><p>He wasn\u2019t afraid anymore and curiously looked at the surroundings. He asked Pu Yao worriedly, \u201cWei Sheng Shixiong is also in the sword cave. Would he encounter us?\u201d If he encountered Shixiong, he couldn\u2019t even protest his innocence.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis sword cave has eighteen levels.\u201d Pu Yao was full of disdain as he looked at Zuo Mo, \u201cYour Wei Shixiong has already descended to the sixteenth level. If you had half the ability of your shixiong, would I be in this sorry state?\u201d As he spoke, he became angry, \u201cI, a Sky Yao, falling to such a level. So embarrassing!\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing Pu Yao acting like normal, for some reason, Zuo Mo relaxed significantly. He instantly went at it with Pu Yao, sneering, \u201cNone of my business! What Sky Yao, weren\u2019t you wounded by my Shibo? Aren\u2019t you only able to bully the greenhorn zhuji cultivators like me.\u201d He quickly corrected, \u201cWrong, ge was only lianqi at the time! And you dare to speak of it!\u201d</p><br/><p>Pu Yao wasn\u2019t angry and laughed, \u201cThis place is good. There\u2019s a lot of yin energy, and it\u2019s so comfortable! There are even souls. Although they are incomplete souls, but it\u2019s better than nothing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow did you find this place?\u201d Zuo Mo was very curious. This sword cave was kept secret. He had stayed here for two years but didn\u2019t know where it was, yet Pu Yao was able to find it. He had heard that it required two jindan cooperating to open the sword cave. Pu Yao was able to easily enter. This guy still has some ability, Zuo Mo thought.</p><br/><p>Pu Yao said disdainfully, \u201cIn just this tiny Wu Kong Sword Sect I knew after taking a single look.\u201d He then said to Zuo Mo, \u201cIn the future, we will come visit this place occasionally.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCome here?\u201d Zuo Mo\u2019s eyes widened. He shook his head without any hesitation, \u201cNo way, do you know how much jingshi you spent today? Four pieces of third grade jingshi! Four pieces! Do you know how many golden crow pills I need to make to earn four pieces of third grade jingshi? You spent it so easily\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Pu Yao was full of disdain, \u201cThat only shows you are trash. Earning jingshi like you\u2019re giving birth. Meeting such a trash like you\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo didn\u2019t hesitate to interrupt, also full of disdain as he said, \u201cIf you can do it, you go earn it! Aren\u2019t you a Sky yao? What? A Sky yao but you have to extract jingshi from me, like that\u2019s something to be proud of!\u201d As he spoke, it was like the accumulated anger had suddenly erupted, \u201cGe had worked so hard to earn the jingshi with sweat and blood. Good for you, you just swiped it all away without a sound! You\u2019re freeloading\u2026 Ge hasn\u2019t even asked you for rent and you charged me for each lesson. You even started to take jingshi for each experience of sword essence, aren\u2019t you embarrassed??\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo righteously listed Pu Yao\u2019s offences.</p><br/><p>Pu Yao was dumbstruck. The reality proved it. Even the most powerful yaomo, facing the even stronger tongue, they would also become dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>After Zuo Mo ranted for five minutes he then stopped in satisfaction. That felt good!</p><br/><p>After a long while, Pu Yao finally recovered. He tilted his head in thought and said, \u201cAlright then, I\u2019ll teach you a little technique that can earn jingshi.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo\u2019s mind instantly became alert and he went over, \u201cWhat technique?\u201d</p><br/><p>[i]: Yun is cloud, xia is red cloud</p><br/><p>[ii]: immortal, goddess. Misogyny in xianxia \u2013 the titles of females are usually xianzi, while males get daoren, zhenren, etc.</p><br/><p>Translator ramblings: Wasn\u2019t that a good rant? Comedic relief and character progression at the same time. Also, look at how valuable the yaomo are!</p><br/><p>We now have scene breaks (\u2014\u2014). The ellipses are just ellipses and not scene breaks.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Lian\u2019er!\u201d Ceng Yi didn\u2019t even look at the thin mo and the fat mo. Looking at Lian\u2019er, his expression was excited. He stepped forward and grabbed Lian\u2019er\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo\u2019s finger left Lian\u2019er\u2019s brow and her black eyes silently opened. She swept across the soundings, and when she saw A Gui, she paused slightly. When she saw A Gui\u2019s bare feet, she had an expression of realization.</p><br/><p>She had actually seen the scene inside Zuo Mo\u2019s mind. She was also slightly shocked.</p><br/><p>Was it \u2026 \u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cFather!\u201d Her voice was soft and serene.</p><br/><p>\u201cLian\u2019er! You\u2019re alright! You are really alright! This is great!\u201d Ceng Yi was extremely excited, and in his eyes, Zuo Mo was akin to empty air.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe saved me,\u201d Ceng Lian\u2019er said serenely.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh oh oh, I will definitely reward him well! He can have whatever he wants!\u201d Ceng Yi nodded repeatedly. He could not suppress the joy on his face but his gaze did not bear to leave his daughter.</p><br/><p>The fat one and the thin one silently sneaked away. No one paid attention.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo opened his eyes and the first thing he did was search for A Gui.</p><br/><p>When he saw A Gui standing silently at the side a phrase floated up in his mind, \u201cYoung Master, don\u2019t be afraid, I\u2019ll definitely find you\u201d. He couldn\u2019t help but reach out and rub A Gui\u2019s hair.</p><br/><p>\u201cA Gui, you found me.\u201d</p><br/><p>He wanted to smile, but his tears flowed down uncontrollably.</p><br/><p>He thought about how A Gui had been covered in wounds when he had found her. She definitely had been searching for him! He thought about when they were trapped in the Nine Turn Sky Soil Disk, when she had faced the last attack of the Clear Sky Old Forefather, when they had been in the desert walking against the sand and wind as she had carried him, and her panting figure when she carried him through the woods in his memory.</p><br/><p>His vision blurred, and A Gui\u2019s figure also became blurred. This blurred figure and the young and blurry figure in his fragmented memories merged together.</p><br/><p>Did you leave me the Five Element Glass Bead?</p><br/><p>What happened? A Gui, who wounded you so?</p><br/><p>A Gui took a deep breath. He grabbed A Gui\u2019s hand and his expression recovered but there was something else unusual in his gaze.</p><br/><p>The release of the seal on the Five Element Glass Bead meant that he had broken through into jindan.</p><br/><p>Recalling that silver white shen power, he suddenly turned towards Ceng Lian\u2019er. That woman! His pupils contracted, and Ceng Yi!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat just happened?\u201d Zuo Mo asked Pu Yao and Wei.</p><br/><p>Wei said, \u201cIt should be power resonance, a very rare occurrence. It means that the degree of compatibility between your powers is very strong, and are of different orientation.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo knew what power resonance was. This usually occurred when two kinds of powers in perfectly opposite came into contact and was an extremely rare event. The two powers would respond to each other, and this kind of intercourse would greatly aid in the increase of power. No wonder the silver shen power the other had given back didn\u2019t cause him any trouble and helped him make a breakthrough.</p><br/><p>But he cultivated shen power. The only power that could resonant with his shen power was shen power. This meant the other had to also cultivate shen power!</p><br/><p>And it was shen power of the completely opposite orientation!</p><br/><p>\u201cCareful, this woman is dangerous,\u201d Pu Yao warned Zuo Mo.</p><br/><p>Without needing Pu Yao\u2019s reminder, Zuo Mo knew the other was dangerous. Up until now, Zuo Mo had only met three people of this era that cultivated shen power. One was he, another was A Gui, and the last was this Ceng Lian\u2019er.</p><br/><p>He could not get the measure of this woman.</p><br/><p>But he didn\u2019t need to, Zuo Mo thought.</p><br/><p>After the breakthrough, his thoughts of making trouble for Ceng Yi had temporarily faded and the other had helped in his breakthrough.</p><br/><p>What completely occupied Zuo Mo\u2019s mind at the moment was A Gui. The memory fragments sealed in the Five Element Glass Bead had caused him great shock.</p><br/><p>He just wanted to find a place and calm down.</p><br/><p>Without another word, he grabbed A Gui and jumped away. He had heard Ceng Lian\u2019er and Ceng Yi\u2019s conversation. He didn\u2019t need to worry that Ka Zhuo would get in trouble.</p><br/><p>\u201cEn?\u201d Ceng Yi raised his head and was slightly surprised. The power that Zuo Mo showed was out of his expectations.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet them go.\u201d Ceng Lian\u2019er spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll listen to Lian\u2019er! Listen to Lian\u2019er!\u201d Ceng Yi said affectionately and took his gaze away.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do these people want to do? What do they mean by standing there?\u201d a bandit asked in puzzlement.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha! They aren\u2019t able to run! So they are trying to fight back! Just one word from Boss One-eye, and look at this. Not just one hundred people, even if they are one thousand, they will be defeated.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are right, we are using a sword to kill a chicken! I heard the people from Mountain Dragon Corps retelling about their strength and thought there would be a lot of people. One hundred, it isn\u2019t even enough to pick our teeth with!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStop wasting words, just one hundred people, how do we divide them up? We have to be first! There is only one space as a reward!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are right!\u201d</p><br/><p>A bunch of bandits charged at the mountain. Their actions caused a chain response. Seeing this, the other bandits unhesitatingly charged.</p><br/><p>One hundred people in a formation on the mountain couldn\u2019t compare to the three thousand bandits.</p><br/><p>The bandits that charged were like a tsunami, covering the ground and the sky!</p><br/><p>The suppressed fighting spirit in Shu Long\u2019s eyes lost all of its restrains and started to burn.</p><br/><p>\u201cOpen!\u201d</p><br/><p>Black smoke suddenly sprouted out of the one hundred and eight totem pillars.</p><br/><p>The black smoke grew with the wind and in a flash, it covered the entire mountain peak like a enormous black cloud.</p><br/><p>The rushing bandits charged into the black cloud.</p><br/><p>Boom boom boom!</p><br/><p>The roiling black smoke was expelled from the totem pillars. They seemed to change constantly as though they were alive. Suddenly, the black smoke around one totem pillar condensed and formed the shape of a person.</p><br/><p>A figure made from black smoke appeared above the totem pillar.</p><br/><p>[Mo Grinding Disk]!</p><br/><p>If a mo golden battle general saw this combat formation, he would exclaim in shock. [Mo Grinding Disk] was one of the strongest battle formations used to wear down the enemy. It was like a terrifying grinding disk. A battalion that was trapped in it was like a piece of meat thrown into the grinder and would be ground into meat paste.</p><br/><p>There had been innumerable xiuzhe that had died in the [Mo Grinding Disk] in the past. But after that thousand year war, the [Mo Grinding Disk] had been lost and the technique never appeared after.</p><br/><p>Yet at this time, one of the strongest battle formations, [Mo Grinding Disk], appeared on this little mountain, and there was only one hundred people.</p><br/><p>\u201cKill!\u201d</p><br/><p>Inside the thick black smoke, Shu Long\u2019s shout echoed in the air like thunder.</p><br/><p>The battle formation shifted loudly and spun like a grindstone.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo looked silently at A Gui. A Gui sat beside him with a wooden expression.</p><br/><p>When he saw A Gui\u2019s wooden expression, Zuo Mo\u2019s heart hurt. The shen power inside A Gui\u2019s body was too strange, and Zuo Mo couldn\u2019t find traces any of A Gui\u2019s thoughts and memories. Her mind was completely empty.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo remembered that A Gui had seemed most alive when she had been wounded and had no shen power.</p><br/><p>Shen power!</p><br/><p>That intimidating coldness and voice caused Zuo Mo\u2019s heart to hurt.</p><br/><p>\u201cPu, Wei, what solutions do you have?\u201d Zuo Mo asked.</p><br/><p>Pu Yao and Wei were both silent. Zuo Mo knew that this was a hard problem for them. Pu Yao and Wei knew a lot about yao and mo cultivation, but they didn\u2019t know much more than he did about shen power.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt would be good if A Gui could speak,\u201d Zuo Mo murmured to himself. If A Gui could speak, then she could tell him everything.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo knew this was a delusion.</p><br/><p>He forced himself to calm down and think back to every detail in those fragments. He instantly had many discoveries.</p><br/><p>A Gui called him \u201cYoung Master.\u201d This appellation implied many things. He probably did not have an ordinary birth. A Gui had carried him and fled for their lives. There had also been those fragments filled with blood and slaughter. His family had probably encountered trouble.</p><br/><p>Who did it? Why?</p><br/><p>Where had A Gui\u2019s shen power come from? Who had erased his memories and changed his features?</p><br/><p>Countless riddles came at him and almost pressed Zuo Mo to the point of suffocation.</p><br/><p>Calm! He had to be calm!</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo bit down hard on his lips and tried to maintain his calm. But his bulging tendons exposed the storm inside. A Gui\u2019s shen power was the greatest obstacle. This shen power was extremely weird and Zuo Mo could not extract it.</p><br/><p>At this time, Pu Yao suddenly said, \u201cDo you remember the Reverse Shadow Spirit Silkgrass that I once mentioned to you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo stilled and thought for a while with creased brows before he nodded. \u201cI remember, you said the Reverse Shadow Spirit Silkgrass can help me recover the fragments of my memory.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. A Gui\u2019s memories have been damaged, her soul is wounded, and I suspect that the wounds in her soul are related to the shen power that she cultivates. But if you want to know all this, you do not only have A Gui\u2019s memories to repair,\u201d Pu Yao said.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo reacted quickly and his eyes lit up. \u201cYes! There is no need to start with A Gui, we can start with me!\u201d</p><br/><p>The more he thought, the more excited Zuo Mo was. \u201cYes, yes! I should have also experienced those same vents, and there would be shadows left in my mind. If I can recover my memories, I can know all this! I will know what shen power A Gui cultivates, I can think of a way to heal A Gui \u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He had closed himself in trying to find a way through A Gui. He had completely forgotten that he should also know!</p><br/><p>Thinking back to the time that the sect leader had picked him up at Wu Kong Mountain, it was about the same time that was indicated in the memory fragments were sealed in the Five Element Glass Bead.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan the Reverse Shadow Spirit Silkgrass really recover my memories?\u201d Zuo Mo asked urgently.</p><br/><p>Wei spoke and proved that Pu Yao was not boasting. \u201cThis is a grass that grows in the mo realm. As long as there is one piece of the memory, it can completely reflect and trace back your entire memory. You have so many memory fragments now. If we can find Reverse Shadow Spirit Silkgrass, you should be able to get all of your previous memories!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere is Reverse Shadow Spirit Silkgrass?\u201d</p><br/><p>Pu Yao and Wei exchanged a look. Both hesitated.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere is it?\u201d Zuo Mo exploded.</p><br/><p>Wei slowly opened. \u201cSupposedly, there is Reverse Shadow Spirit Silkgrass in Nether Spring Jie of the Ming Realm.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReverse Shadow Spirit Silkgrass \u2026 \u2026 Nether Spring Jie!\u201d Zuo Mo murmured, his gaze determined.</p><br/><p>Editor brag: Totally want to point out I got half of ZM\u2019s past right back in chapter 255. Woot woot!</p><br/><p>Translator Ramblings: If you read back, Pu had suggested the silkgrass as a solution but they didn\u2019t know the location. I also have to admire WanderingGummi\u2019s self-control. He hasn\u2019t asked me for any spoilers yet.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

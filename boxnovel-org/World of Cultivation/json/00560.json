Surprised, she felt interested. The people around her were all young masters, and which one of them wasn\u2019t experienced with women? How long had it been since she had met such a virgin?</p><br/><p>Thinking about when she was a child and about the innocent faces around her that did not have fierce desire and thoughts of consuming her. Back when there was only the innocence of childhood, and they were her playmates.</p><br/><p>But then, everything changed \u2026 \u2026</p><br/><p>A certain soft place in Princess Xia\u2019s heart seemed to be lightly touched.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you afraid of me?\u201d she asked lightly.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo who had just opened his eyes and was preparing to utter a challenge had his words forced back by the other\u2019s soft words.</p><br/><p>His eyes widened. \u201cAfraid of you?\u201d Zuo Mo did not understand why Princess Xia would have such a strange idea. Did Little Mo Ge look like a cowardly person?</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are not afraid of me, why don\u2019t you look at me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Princess Xia\u2019s words caused Zuo Mo\u2019s prepared words of, \u201cCome, let\u2019s have a fight!\u201d to be swallowed back.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo found that he could not keep up with the other\u2019s thoughts. Oh, why couldn\u2019t he look at her?</p><br/><p>He opened his eyes wide and then stared at Princess Xia.</p><br/><p>So beautiful \u2026 \u2026 that \u2026 \u2026 this feeling \u2026 \u2026 why would he think of swallowing \u2026 \u2026</p><br/><p>An illusory spell!</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo shook.</p><br/><p>Princess Xia saw Zuo Mo\u2019s change and couldn\u2019t help but burst into laughter. In that moment, she was very attractive and her smile seemed to light up the room.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo was almost unable to move his eyes away and his breathing rate increased.</p><br/><p>Just \u2026 \u2026 just an illusory spell \u2026 \u2026 you want to defeat Little Mo Ge \u2026 \u2026 but \u2026 \u2026 so powerful \u2026 \u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cCome taste this Night Draw Wine, this is a famous vintage in the mo world, and can rival the Granny Meng Ghost Wine. It is a pity that I only have one bottle. After drinking this, you cannot ask for more from me.\u201d Princess Xia poured wine for Zuo Mo with a smile. Her skin was as white as snow, and as fine as porcelain. Her body was slightly tilted towards Zuo Mo and the deep valley in front of her chest seemed to have an unusual power that caused people to unconsciously sink into it.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo felt a wave of heat rise from his lower half. His mouth was dry and he had a strange feeling.</p><br/><p>Such a powerful illusory spell!</p><br/><p>It was even more powerful that the illusory spells that the paper crane girl had cast in Wu Kong Mountains in the past!</p><br/><p>Was this her attack?</p><br/><p>Determination flashed across Zuo Mo\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>How could a true man not receive the move?</p><br/><p>Without another word, Zuo Mo secretly cast a [Bone-Crushing Obscuring Flash] with his left hand as he picked up the Night Draw Wine with his right hand and drank all of it.</p><br/><p>When the wine entered his throat, Zuo Mo couldn\u2019t help but pause. The taste of this wine was completely different compared to the Granny Meng Ghost Wine. The Granny Meng Ghost Wine was as hot as fire, and burned like a ball of flame when it entered his throat. This Night Draw Wine was cool and light, reaching directly into his mind and making him unspeakably comfortable.</p><br/><p>The taste wasn\u2019t bad?</p><br/><p>The illusory spell hadn\u2019t been broken?</p><br/><p>Princess Xia laughed lightly, \u201cYour rough gulping is suited to drinking the Granny Meng Ghost Wine but not to the Night Draw Wine. Sip, and let the wine swirl around your mouth before slowly swallowing it. Try it, the feeling of the wine will be different.\u201d</p><br/><p>Finishing, Princess Xia picked up the wine cup. Her eyes were slightly closed, and her gentle and seductive red lips contrasted against the snowy white porcelain.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo lost focus slightly.</p><br/><p>But he quickly raised his alertness and focused. He copied princess Xia and took small sips. When the Night Draw Wine swished a few rounds around his mouth, an unique fragrance spread into his body. In this moment, it was as though he was soaking in cool water, so comfortable that he almost groaned.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo comfortable!\u201d Princess Xia closed her eyes and said as though she was talking in her sleep, \u201cWhen I was young, I liked to drink Night Draw Wine the most. Daddy didn\u2019t like me drinking so I sneaked into Daddy\u2019s wine cellar. One time, I accidentally drank too much and fell asleep in the wine cellar. When Daddy caught me with the goods\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>She poked out her tongue like a child that had been caught doing bad things by her parents.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 he sealed the wine cellar. Even now, it hasn\u2019t been re-opened. Now, no one knows that there is a wine cellar there.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI really miss the time when Daddy was here.\u201d</p><br/><p>There seemed to be something flashing through Princess Xia\u2019s eyes. She suddenly raised her face and threw back all of the wine.</p><br/><p>Putting down the wine cup, her cheeks were blushed and her eyes were dazed.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat bad things did you do when you were little?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo could feel the sorrow and longing in Princess Xia\u2019s words. It was like when he thought of the sect leader and the shishu. But it was not something that he could state aloud here. Hearing her question, he shook his head, \u201cIn childhood? I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know?\u201d Princess Xia was surprised by this answer.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy memory was erased and my appearance has been changed, I don\u2019t know anything about my past.\u201d Zuo Mo replied truthfully. Originally, he hadn\u2019t wanted to say it. While this was something that did not have to be kept a secret, he did not want to casually tell other people. However, Princess Xia\u2019s reminiscing seemed sincere to him, so he spoke of it.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh!\u201d princess Xia covered her mouth, her expression shocked. She hadn\u2019t expected it to be such a terrifying answer.</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry!\u201d she said, full of apology.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201d Zuo Mo shook his head unconcernedly. \u201cIn any case, I don\u2019t remember it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is not a bad thing to not remember.\u201d Princess Xia smiled slightly and then poured a cup for Zuo Mo. \u201cSometimes, it is cruel to remember.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo drank the wine all in one gulp. Even though it was better to sip it slowly, he liked drinking it in one gulp better. This made him feel it was very exhilarating. Princess Xia\u2019s words touched him. He thought of the phrase \u201cdo not forget\u201d that frequently appeared in his dreams and a hint of bitterness rose.</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, it is crueler to forget things what one doesn\u2019t want to forget.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo poured a cup for himself and drained it.</p><br/><p>Princess Xia stilled. She almost couldn\u2019t believe that this was something that this innocent youth said. She slowly pondered this and her thoughts wandered. Her mind wandered in this moment.</p><br/><p>Moments later, she smiled brightly and raised her wine cup. \u201cFor this phrase, drink!\u201d</p><br/><p>Then she copied Zuo Mo to drained the cup in one gulp. When she put down the wine cup, her cheeks were flushed red, and her eyes blurred. Her appearance was slightly disheveled and it added even more attractiveness.</p><br/><p>Her eyes moved and it became a flirtatious look. Princess Xia looked at Zuo Mo and said lightly, \u201cI\u2019m very curious what you have come to find me for?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo was slightly tipsy at this time and had long thrown Pu Yao and Wei\u2019s words to the back of his mind. When he heard Princess Xia\u2019s words, he did not avoid it and said directly, \u201cI have come to beg Princess for two people.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhich two people are worth you coming to make a request?\u201d Princess Xia looked wryly at Zuo Mo.</p><br/><p>\u201cTwo of my xiuzhe friends. I heard that Princess Xia saved them so I come to request them from Princess.\u201d Zuo Mo did not avoid Princess Xia\u2019s gaze and said seriously.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiuzhe friends?\u201d Princess Xia was slightly astounded. \u201cI hadn\u2019t thought that you actually had xiuzhe friends. Yes, I had picked two female xiuzhe previously, you have good information sources.\u201d</p><br/><p>The last word carried some flirtatiousness, and the eyes were glimmering.</p><br/><p>\u201cI coincidentally saved another friend,\u201d Zuo Mo said honestly.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you wanted to lure me here?\u201d Princess Xia had amusement on her face when she looked at Zuo Mo.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Zuo Mo docilely admitted.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre these two female xiuzhe very important to you?\u201d Princess Xia asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cVery important,\u201d Zuo Mo nodded and said without hesitation.</p><br/><p>Princess Xia covered her mouth and giggled, \u201cSo you like female xiuzhe. If this news goes public, many female mo\u2019s hearts will be heartbroken.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo choked on the words.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, let\u2019s continue.\u201d A hint of mischievousness flashed through Princess Xia\u2019s eyes. \u201cI can give them to you but I had planned on using them as maids. Now that I give them to you, what benefit can you give me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSpeak!\u201d Zuo Mo\u2019s expression was serious. Even though he was greedy in personality and liked to bargain, he did not have any thought of bargaining on this matter.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan I first think about it? Have you owe me a favor? When I think of something then, I will tell you?\u201d Princess Xia had a sly expression.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo was startled and then he reacted after a moment. He said cautiously, \u201cAfter finding them, I planned to leave Great Peace City.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLeave Great Peace City?\u201d Princess Xia stilled slightly and a hint of disappointment flashed through her eyes. She quickly recovered and said with a smile, \u201cSo you have come especially for them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Zuo Mo nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cI really don\u2019t want to give them to you,\u201d Princess Xia said with a light laugh. \u201cIt is not very easy to find a good person to drinking with.\u201d</p><br/><p>But when she saw Zuo Mo\u2019s nervous expression, she burst into laugher and said to herself, \u201cIt is rare that I am kind, I have to maintain this. Don\u2019t worry, don\u2019t worry, I will give them to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Finishing, she turned and gave orders in a low tone. The middle aged attendant in the corner glanced at Zuo Mo. She did not seem to move but moments later, a servant came in with two other female attendants.</p><br/><p>Xiao Guo! Li Ying Feng!</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo\u2019s eyes suddenly widened. It was hard to control his expression of joy but he suppressed it and did not call out to the two of them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHere, from today onwards, they belong to you,\u201d Princess Xia said to Zuo Mo with a smile.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo hadn\u2019t expected that the matter would proceed so smoothly. Looking at Princess Xia, he gravely bowed. \u201cIf Princess thinks of something you need, please request it as long as I have not left Great Peace City!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Guo\u2019s eyes suddenly widened and became disbelieving. Li Ying Feng looked at Zuo Mo anxiously.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen you will owe me for now.\u201d Princess Xia\u2019s beautiful eyes stared at Zuo Mo as she said with as smile, \u201cI like it best when people owe me. When I think of something, you cannot fail to uphold your word.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNever!\u201d Zuo Mo said seriously.</p><br/><p>\u201cTake your friends and leave, they had significant hardship on the road,\u201d Princess Xia said with a light laugh.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo also desired to return. He raised his folded hands to Princess Xia. \u201cFarewell!\u201d</p><br/><p>He stood with one hand pulling Xiao Guo and the other pulling Li Ying Feng as he prepared to rise into the air.</p><br/><p>Suddenly a bright voice sounded in the sky.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere is Xiao Mo Ge? Nanmen Xue asks for a fight!\u201d</p><br/><p>Princess Xia looked at Zuo Mo\u2019s frozen expression. Her hand covered her mouth as she laughed, \u201cThis is not my fault!\u201d</p><br/><p>A hint of joy flashed imperceptibly through her eyes.</p><br/><p>Translator Ramblings:</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo: That was easier than expected!</p><br/><p>Three seconds again</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo: Not again!</p><br/><p>I think what Fang Xiang tried to do is showcase the way that the races are different. With the xiuzhe, it\u2019s focused on sects, contribution points, your own skill set. With the yao, it is the education system, the interchange of information and with the mo, what he\u2019s trying to so is how warlike they are. There\u2019s more to the mo, but at this time, fighting.</p><br/><p>Also, we are officially 2/3 of the way through the chapters. Thank you for all your comments and likes.

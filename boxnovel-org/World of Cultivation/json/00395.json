The chaotic air turbulence around him instantly stopped and a glowing light flashed and disappeared in his eyes. The skin on his face became extremely smooth, the weathering due to hard days in his past had disappeared. His appearance was not handsome and not exceptional in the campsite but the dhyana serene aura on his body was unique to him.</p><br/><p>It had to be said that the people of the camp were very unique. Wei Sheng\u2019s determination, Gongsun Cha\u2019s insanity and viciousness hidden under bashfulness, Shu Long\u2019s steadiness, Ma Fan\u2019s laziness etc.</p><br/><p>On Zong Ru\u2019s clean forehead was a blood red lotus. Two auras, one holy and one demonic, were merged together, and filled with a soul-shaking power.</p><br/><p>He stood and slowly walked out of the tent.</p><br/><p>\u201cOld Ru!\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing Zong Ru, Lei Peng and Nian Lu first stopped and then were overjoyed. The three of them had once been in a team and had a good relationship. While Zong Ru had undergone his core formation, the two of them had stood guard outside the tent.</p><br/><p>\u201cLei Man! Little Nian Nian!\u201d A sincere smile came onto Zong Ru\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>Nian Lu\u2019s smile froze on his face, and the tendons in his forehead pulsed. Lei Peng laughed instead, and rushed in front of Zong Ru, opening his eyes and giving a hard hug.</p><br/><p>\u201cOld Ru, you did it! Secretly having your core formation! Isn\u2019t this forcing the rest of us to work hard?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lei Peng\u2019s voice was like thunder and exploded next to Zong Ru\u2019s ear. Zong Ru had a slight smile as he patted Lei Peng\u2019s back.</p><br/><p>Nian Lu\u2019s gaze swept across Zong Ru and landed on Zong Ru\u2019s face. His eyes suddenly lit up. \u201cSo core formation can make one more handsome! Excellent! No, no, I have to enter jindan soon! I\u2019m so handsome now, if I\u2019m a jindan, how handsome would I be? It is such a hard question \u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing Nian Lu\u2019s narcissistic and nonsensical words, Zong Ru\u2019s heart felt unspeakably warm.</p><br/><p>The news that Zong Ru had come out made the entire camp erupt.</p><br/><p>The mood of the camp had been extremely heavy these past days. Zong Ru\u2019s re-appearance caused everyone to be filled with joy. Zong Ru was humble and low-key usually. In this time, the people that came to congratulate him was endless. Compared to everyone\u2019s worry when Xie Shan had his core formation, everyone was extremely calm this time.</p><br/><p>When Zong Ru saw Zuo Mo and the others, he hurriedly walked forward. He made a deep bow and said respectfully, \u201cDaren!\u201d</p><br/><p>A smile came onto Zuo Mo\u2019s face and he unhesitatingly went forward to give Zong Ru a hard hug. Just as Zong Ru was very moved, Daren muttered in a small voice next to his ear, \u201cYou have to work hard on the healing techniques of [Attainment Golden Body]. There is so many people in the camp, think how much jingshi we can save when the time comes \u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>\u201cDaren, we cannot sustain this,\u201d the vice commander\u2019s expression was fragile and his voice bitter and burdened.</p><br/><p>Lan\u2019s face was unaffected. \u201cHow many have we lost?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnother two hundred were just killed, three hundred wounded!\u201d</p><br/><p>The vice commander had a terrible expression when he reported the numbers. In the short eight hours since they stepped into the Bloody Sky Metropolis Jie, they had encountered six waves of attack! Up until now, fatalities reached more than one thousand people, more than one-tenth of the entire corps.</p><br/><p>The other\u2019s attacks were extremely fierce and unpredictable. They seemed to be able to move without restriction in Bloody Sky Metropolis Jie. No one knew how they were able to do this. The Blood Sky Metropolis Jie was the battlefield suited for yaomo, yet they were suppressed in this place. But the xiuzhe who attacked them seemed to be unaffected at all and were at great ease.</p><br/><p>How was the other able to do this?</p><br/><p>Lan gazed into the distance and asked, \u201cHow long until we can reach the defensive line?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe other\u2019s attacks have slowed our advancement \u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lan interrupted the vice commander and asked sternly, \u201cHow long?\u201d</p><br/><p>The vice commander\u2019s heart shook. He gritted his teeth and said, \u201cAt this speed, we will only reach the line after ninety six hours.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lan was silent for a moment before he said in a deep voice, \u201cGather the other daren.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d The vice commander heeded the order. Moments later, the nine officers hurried over. Their expressions were all bad.</p><br/><p>In eight short hours, one-tenth of their forces had been killed. This kind of attrition rate made their hearts beat rapidly. Based on this speed, their numbers would be expended before they reached the defensive line.</p><br/><p>Lan\u2019s gaze swept across the nine officers. Their faces were terrible but not panicked. He had personally promoted all nine commanders who had outstanding skills.</p><br/><p>Military positions had very strict requirements. For a regular corps like the Ice Frost Corps, the corps commander must be a gold battle general, and the officers had to be silver battle generals.</p><br/><p>\u201cI need one that is willing to go to his death.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lan did not waste words and directly said it.</p><br/><p>The nine officers all changed expressions. From Daren\u2019s words, they could surmise the state of the situation. Daren\u2019s gaze made them feel there was a blade at their back.</p><br/><p>But \u2026 \u2026</p><br/><p>They hesitated.</p><br/><p>At this time, a youth stood out.</p><br/><p>\u201cDaren, this subordinate is willing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lan\u2019s expressionless face imperceptibly twitched. He looked closely at the youth and his heart couldn\u2019t help but hurt. This youth that had become a silver battle general at the age of twenty had a limitless potential and one of his favored commanders.</p><br/><p>Liang Wei belonged to one of the side branches of the Water Clan. His results in the yao art house had been average until he had turned to study as a battle general, where his results shot up. When he was twenty, he had successfully passed the exam of a silver battle general. Even though he was not eye-catching compared to the little monsters of the yao world, Lan still felt that his future was limitless.</p><br/><p>Liang Wei stood upright, full of bravery.</p><br/><p>Lan could not refuse at this time. He nodded. \u201cI will give you three thousand combat yao. Take up the rear, sweep the flanks of the troop, and stop the attacks.\u201d</p><br/><p>The other officers had complex expressions. From the harassment they had endured in the last eight hours, they could predict just how great the pressure Liang Wei would face.</p><br/><p>Liang Wei calmly accepted and made a bow towards Lan.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I die in combat, Daren, please give some care to my clansmen.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI will!\u201d Lan gravely replied. He turned to the other officers and said in a deep voice, \u201cProceed at full speed! Military law for those that slow down!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d The officers all shook.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>Wei gazed at the development of the battle situation. He felt great shock at the combat capabilities that Gongsun Cha showed.</p><br/><p>The battle had been at a stand still for two whole days.</p><br/><p>Wei saw a rare seriousness on Pu Yao\u2019s face. After interacting for several thousand years, no one could rival his understanding of Pu Yao. When his previous owner had been the corps commander, all of the strategic decisions had come from Pu Yao.</p><br/><p>Pu Yao was forced to such a state by such a young guy!</p><br/><p>If he didn\u2019t see it with his own eyes, he definitely would not believe it.</p><br/><p>From the start of this war chess match, he had watched as the two fought without a moment of inattention. He had sighed in amazement many times throughout. The eye-dazzling fighting had caused him to exclaim. The time rate of war chess was much faster than regular time. The span of two days was equivalent to a whole month inside the match.</p><br/><p>He did not understand battle generals. At every dangerous moment, his heart couldn\u2019t help but jump. He had thought hundreds of time inside, how could they be so devious?</p><br/><p>Even though the advantage of the match was in Pu Yao\u2019s hands, but Wei put more of his attention of Gongsun Cha. Such a young person that was able to resist Pu Yao for so long, his skill definitely was not low!</p><br/><p>Gradually, the balance began to tilt and the Pu Yao\u2019s advantage had grown.</p><br/><p>Pu Yao\u2019s sweeping attacks in the final stages of battle were, in Wei\u2019s view, this guy venting for having lost face.</p><br/><p>As expected, when Pu Yao came out of the war chess, his expression was not good.</p><br/><p>\u201cA very powerful young person.\u201d Wei\u2019s words were slightly pouring salt onto the wound.</p><br/><p>Pu Yao\u2019s expression became even uglier, but he seemed to think of something and his expression instantly recovered. He said proudly, \u201cDon\u2019t give young people too much praise. This is not good for his improvement.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei stilled. He reacted very quickly. \u201cHe is?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy student.\u201d Pu Yao showed a smug and sly smile. \u201cHow about it? Give a review!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei really was stunned this time. \u201cHe is also your student? What about Zuo Mo?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t I have two students?\u201d Pu Yao glanced at Wei, his tone filled with smugness and showiness. \u201cI have good eyes for judging people!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStrong!\u201d Wei\u2019s praise seemed sincere.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course!\u201d Pu Yao was even more smug. \u201cNothing needs to be said of Zuo Mo, that guy is a weirdo that even I don\u2019t understand. Gongsun Cha is born to be a battle general. Ha, a twenty year old gold battle general, he\u2019ll frighten those old guys to death!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGold battle general?\u201d Wei was frightened. He stammered out, \u201cThat little guy is a gold battle general?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei\u2019s display made Pu Yao\u2019s smugness reach a peak. His devious and cunning face seemed to glow at this moment. \u201cDefinitely a gold battle general! I jumped in fright this time when he attacked! If I wasn\u2019t careful, I would have lost. Tsk tsk, a scripture he comprehended himself, twenty year old gold battle general. As expected of one that I taught from the beginning! Most importantly \u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Pu Yao suddenly closed his mouth and did not speak. Wei unconsciously asked, \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHahahaha! He didn\u2019t not just inherit my skills as a battle general, but also my handsome appearance! On this point, Zuo Mo lacks a lot \u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei looked wordlessly at Pu Yao.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>Gongsun Cha\u2019s mood was terrible to the bone.</p><br/><p>He had originally thought that after just having a breakthrough, he could rival the mystery person. Who knew that he had lost again. Even though he knew he could not rival the other, but he disliked failure, extremely disliked it!</p><br/><p>After swallowing the fiend soul beast bead, he had just reached the border of a breakthrough. Just at this time, Zuo Mo had given him a Golden Soul and successfully allowed him to make a breakthrough!</p><br/><p>The strong confidence brought by the breakthrough caused him to unhesitatingly challenge Pu Yao.</p><br/><p>But it still ended in defeat. Thinking about how he had never beat the other once, his mood became even worse!</p><br/><p>The speculation about being bait made him even angrier. With his understanding of Shixiong, even though Shixiong had said it easily that day, he definitely would not give up inside. They would get even. As the battle general, he would undoubtedly play the most crucial part.</p><br/><p>He could not fail!</p><br/><p>Craziness flashed through Gongsun Cha\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>A daring and insane idea quickly formed in his mind.</p><br/><p>Translator Ramblings: Lil\u2019 Miss knows Xiao Mo Ge so well.</p><br/><p>Also, to be clear, Gongsun Cha is a gold battle general but it doesn\u2019t mean that if he fights in \u201creal life\u201d the army he leads will win against another army. As mentioned before, training takes several years until a battalion actually takes form and the strength of Gongsun Cha\u2019s soldiers also matter.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

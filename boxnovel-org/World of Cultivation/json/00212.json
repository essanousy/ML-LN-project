In the thousands of years he lived, he had not encountered something more amusing than this.</p><br/><p>A zhuji xiuzhe who had never studied anything in the area, oh, he was also a butcher, had started to study how to become a battle general. He had never heard of something like this, even during the great war from thousands of years ago.</p><br/><p>He was very familiar with battle generals. In the camp of xiuzhe, without almost any exception, there were two ways that battle generals were trained. The first was a battle general that was specifically nurtured by large sects; and the other were battle generals that underwent countless battles and had gradually comprehended the skills.</p><br/><p>The majority were from the first method. In that thousand year war, almost seventy percent of the famous battle generals in the xiuzhe camp had been from the large sects. They learned all kinds of knowledge from when they were young. Even the spells they learned were specialized to command in battle.</p><br/><p>The second kind was the other thirty percent. In reality, if one considered all battle generals and not only the famous generals, the difference would be larger. Not having been taught from birth and having to climb up step by step from the lowest level, battle generals formed by the second method were all geniuses. The price they paid were much higher than the first kind.</p><br/><p>It looked as though that Gongsun Cha had great hope to become one of those. Yet reality was always cruel. Being of low status and wanting to become a battle general, these individuals had to meet one condition: having great individual power. Disregarding the talent to command, the battle generals that were the second kind had talent in cultivation that was comparable to any other xiuzhe.</p><br/><p>The reason was very simple. If they had no strength, they would not survive through battle. If they couldn\u2019t survive, how could they climb up? Wanting to become a battle general but being of low status, they had to repeatedly climb over mountains of corpses, in order to accumulate fame and experience. Then there would be compliance to his orders.</p><br/><p>No one in little groups of seven or eight would be willing to put their lives in the hands of an individual that could die anytime, much less larger troops.</p><br/><p>This was also why Pu Yao thought that Gongsun Cha hadn\u2019t had a chance. Gongsun Cha was only a butcher, a zhuji butcher. Pu Yao could easily see that Gongsun Cha\u2019s talent in cultivation was very average. Even if he had many lingdan and talismans, he wouldn\u2019t accomplish too much in cultivation.</p><br/><p>But Pu Yao did not immediately dismiss his ability to become a battle general, even if he had to learn on his own. The most important reason was Zuo Mo\u2019s support.</p><br/><p>His talent wasn\u2019t in question. If Gongsun Cha had been in a large sect from birth, and he ultimately became a battle general, Pu Yao would not find it strange. After playing war chess for so many days, Gongsun Cha had improved quickly.</p><br/><p>What really surprised him was that Zuo Mo trusted Gongsun Cha so much!</p><br/><p>Even Pu Yao had to admit that Zuo Mo\u2019s eyes were wondrously accurate. In his mind, Zuo Mo\u2019s talent wasn\u2019t bad, but it definitely wasn\u2019t the best. However, over these two years, even with the stumbling and tripping, Pu Yao found to his shock that Zuo Mo\u2019s progress was far outside of his predictions.</p><br/><p>Part of it was that he had been involved, but the speed of improvement of core disciples from large sects would would rarely reach Zuo Mo\u2019s level, and they would receive more aid than Zuo Mo.</p><br/><p>But Zuo Mo\u2019s physical talent really could not be called great. This was what Pu Yao marveled at.</p><br/><p>As he kept on thinking about it, Pu Yao felt that it was all caused by Zuo Mo\u2019s viewpoint.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo\u2019s viewpoint and mentality were very strange, and very different from normal people. No matter if it was cultivation, battle, or interpersonal relationships. It was easy for others to see him as the classical utilitarian. Clever, greedy, and money-grubbing, but he would sometimes do something that Pu Yao would find stupid and irrational. Yet these idiotic actions would usually produce good results.</p><br/><p>Originally, Pu Yao did not have a good opinion of Gongsun Cha\u2019s prospects, but considering Zuo Mo, he was suddenly filled with interest and anticipation.</p><br/><p>It was so amusing!</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>Compared to Pu Yao\u2019s attitude of idling and watching from the sidelines, Zuo Mo was so busy his feet never touched the ground. He had been nagged by Chun Yu Cheng to the point that he had to build a beast pool. They wouldn\u2019t stay for very long in Little Mountain Jie, but it wouldn\u2019t be too short. If they used the time well, they could produce a few batches of ling beasts. Chun Yu Cheng had been studying for a long time on the date seed ship, and he had many ideas. However, without the beast pool, all ideas were nothing.</p><br/><p>\u201cShixiong, build a beast pool!\u201d Chun Yu Cheng\u2019s words were like a ghost haunting Zuo Mo\u2019s ears constantly.</p><br/><p>After repeated requests , Zuo Mo complied.</p><br/><p>His wealth was large. A beast pool was expensive, but not too expensive. However, the work was not easy. No one could help him, especially when Chun Shidi had a pile of ideas he wanted to suggest. To realize these ideas, he needed to modify the beast pool.</p><br/><p>The modifications meant that the work he had to do increased dramatically, it meant that he needed to reconstruct it. Even more, Chun Yu Cheng Shidi\u2019s ideas would occasionally change. Each time Zuo Mo wanted to slack off, Chun Yu Cheng\u2019s haunting voice would float to him again.</p><br/><p>\u201cShixiong, just change a bit, just change a bit \u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>When the beast pool was finished, it was like there was a pin in Zuo Mo\u2019s behind, he ran away as far as possible.</p><br/><p>When a obedient person started to torture other people, it would make them feel hopeless.</p><br/><p>Chun Yu Cheng Shidi began to work on the beast pool, Gongsun Shidi was working on the group of xiuzhe, and Zuo Mo started to work on himself.</p><br/><p>His studies into formations needed a large amount of time. He also added another job for himself. He found the ling vein, and gathered some of the Black Line mushrooms that ate ling. He was very interested in them.</p><br/><p>Other than that, cultivation was something that could not be missed. His consciousness had shrunk dramatically after setting down the jinzhi. Thinking about the tactic of battle by relying on numbers, he deeply felt that increasing his consciousness was his most important priority at the moment.</p><br/><p>[Embryonic Breathing Spiritual Cultivation] became something he needed to do everyday.</p><br/><p>After his consciousness manifested, his sea of consciousness transformed. The enchanting flames in the sea of consciousness had disappeared. The number of stars in the sky had increased to ten. The sword river still was the same. He had not increased his sword essence.</p><br/><p>Looking at the stars in the sea of consciousness, Zuo Mo suddenly recalled the time that he forged Lil\u2019 Pagoda, and the stardust that the stars had produced which continuously permeated his consciousness.</p><br/><p>In the void above his consciousness, the ten stars hung. Other than the one star that was somewhat bright, the rest were dim. Thinking about the speed that the stars sprayed out stardust, Zuo Mo felt it would take years for the stardust to permeate all of his consciousness.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat is Star Source.\u201d Pu Yao sat on the gravestone and raised his head to look at the ten stars above his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is Star Source?\u201d This question had always been buried in Zuo Mo\u2019s mind. Seeing that Pu Yao seemed to have intentions of explaining today, he played along and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cStar Source is the origin of the spiritual power,\u201d Pu Yao slowly said. \u201cYou can also think of them as the crystals formed from ling power. Don\u2019t you xiuzhe like to talk about how many jing of ling power?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTen star spiritual power?\u201d Zuo Mo asked in response.</p><br/><p>\u201cOr you can see them as the springs that birth spiritual power. Ten stars mean that you have ten springs that can produce spiritual power.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOne time, I saw that these stars could spray out silver star dust. What is that?\u201d Zuo Mo couldn\u2019t help but ask in curiosity.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d Pu Yao suddenly opened his bloody pupil, his spine straightening, changing from his lazy attitude.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo feel slightly terrified under Pu Yao\u2019s bloody gaze. Inside, he wondered if the other had started to go crazy again.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs something wrong?\u201d Zuo Mo weakly asked.</p><br/><p>After a beat, he saw Pu Yao say dazedly, \u201cThe second consciousness \u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He forcefully shook his head as he refocused. He looked deeply at Zuo Mo. \u201cThe stardust that you saw is a purer form of spiritual power. We usually call it spirit dust. These ten stars, bright and dull are different. The brightest star can produce the most star spirit dust, the speed that it produces spiritual power is the fastest.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo didn\u2019t really understand. Pu Yao didn\u2019t attend to him, and kept on talking.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat yao cultivate are the laws of the world. All objects in the world all contain the laws of the world, all objects in the world can cultivate their spirit. Stars are just one of them. The path of the stars is profound and cryptic. There are very few yao that walk the path of star spirit cultivation.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing this, Zuo Mo suddenly had a slightly bad premonition. \u201cWhat spirit cultivation are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat I chose is Sky Fire Spirit Cultivation.\u201d Pu Yao smiled, his teeth showing.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo interjected, \u201cThen why am I star spiritual cultivation?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause what you cultivate is [Embryonic Breathing Spiritual Cultivation],\u201d Pu Yao snickered. \u201cI hadn\u2019t thought that this [Embryonic Breathing Spiritual Cultivation] is actually a star spirit cultivation. I was fooled by the name.\u201d He muttered in a small voice, \u201cI had expected it was trash, hadn\u2019t thought that it was actually high level, such a loss \u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>An fire suddenly shot up from Zuo Mo\u2019s heart. He was enraged, pointing at Pu Yao\u2019s nose as he swore. \u201cYou trash, you gave something you hadn\u2019t tested for ye to cultivate! You actually wanted to use trash to con ye, ye isn\u2019t finished with you \u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be like this!\u201d Pu Yao wasn\u2019t angry, and said, chuckling, \u201cIn any case, you didn\u2019t lose. Look, you even managed to cultivate to ten stars. In two years, you\u2019ve gotten to manifestation. This speed is very fast!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou you you \u2026 \u2026\u201d Zuo Mo pointed, hearing Pu Yao\u2019s heartless words became so angry his finger trembled.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you want to know how to cultivate next?\u201d Seeing the situation, Pu Yao crisply turned to temptation.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Zuo Mo did not hesitate in answering, all his anger flying away.</p><br/><p>Pu Yao was not shocked in the slightest by Zuo Mo\u2019s one hundred and eighty degree turn in attitude. This guy was very pragmatic.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d Pu Yao smiled. \u201cI can tell you, and I can give you even more help. But I have a small request.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSay it!\u201d Zuo Mo was very familiar with Pu Yao\u2019s conduct as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cI want the golden core of the jindan of Clear Sky Sect.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo was dumbstruck. When he managed to respond, he instantly jumped up. \u201cAre you crazy? Jindan! Go get it yourself if you want it! Run to a little ningmai like myself to say you want the golden core of a jindan, humph humph, the other can turn me to dust with one slap.\u201d</p><br/><p>Finishing, he turned and left, waving his hand. \u201cIf you want to play, play by yourself, ge won\u2019t play with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Pu Yao\u2019s expression was calm, and not angry, \u201cAdd a fifth-grade sword scripture.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo pretended not to hear, and continued to walk forward.</p><br/><p>\u201cAdd a fifth-grade movement method.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo was not moved at all, his steps not changing.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make seven more golden armor guards for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo decided to ignore him.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd another move of [Little Thousand Leaf Hands].\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo instantly stopped his body, and turned to walk towards Pu Yao.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>Translator Ramblings: Pu Yao reflects on Gongsun Cha and Zuo Mo. Chun Yu Cheng is not included since he hasn\u2019t shown much yet and that isn\u2019t Pu\u2019s area of specialty. But Pu Yao is also selectively blind about his own role in Gongsun Cha\u2019s development even as he acknowledges influencing Zuo Mo\u2019s development. \u201cWild\u201d battle generals had to accumulate knowledge and experience through fighting which eliminates all but the most talented so they can out-compete those that were trained by sects and did not have to fight so hard. Gongsun Cha is getting abused daily by a wise and experienced yao battle general. That is a lot of experience that most people won\u2019t get on a very high level. It\u2019s akin to getting a chess grandmaster to play with all his power daily against a child. Zuo Mo\u2019s support using jinzhi is enough at this point to force compliance from the ranks which means that Gongsun Cha\u2019s learning environment right now is better than any sect since he has motivation through his desire to survive this place.</p><br/><p>Pu Yao and Zuo Mo also know each other very well now. Zuo Mo is getting better at negotiating with Pu.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

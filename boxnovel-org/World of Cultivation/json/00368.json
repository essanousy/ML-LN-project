Cloud Ridge Blue Flower had been a famed and influential clan that flourished for thousands of years and never declined. Each generation had outstanding descendants. If they went back a few hundred years, the Blue Flower Clan had occupied a seat on the Council of Elders that oversaw the entire yao world.</p><br/><p>The present Blue Flower did not have the status of its past, but it was still a large sect that was firmly established and admired. Compared to them, the Grey Clan was just a wild, little clan from some backwater mountain, so when Cang Ze heard the other\u2019s name, he instantly became silent.</p><br/><p>Usually, just based on the words \u201cCloud Ridge Blue Flower,\u201d Qinghua Zang Shui could charge recklessly anywhere. When had he ever been humiliated so?</p><br/><p>When had the Blue Flower Family ever been humiliated like this?</p><br/><p>Qinghua Zang Shui was so ashamed that he could die. A burst of hot blood rushed into his head. His eyes glaring, he pointed at Zuo Mo and gritted, \u201cThose that humiliate my Blue Flower Family shall die!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo rolled his eyes. \u201cAre you mental? Am I humiliating your Blue Flower Family?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo- you \u2026 \u2026\u201d The anger in Qinghua Zang Shui\u2019s chest calmed slightly before he was interrupted by Zuo Mo.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho I am humiliating is you.\u201d Zuo Mo looked at Qinghua Zang Shui like he was looking at an idiot and said mockingly, \u201cJust a person like you, you aren\u2019t ashamed to be called a genius? Don\u2019t come out to frighten people? Oh, you definitely want to kill me right now, I know this. So, people like you only have this little bit of patience, only this bit of breadth of chest! Compete with me?\u201d He suddenly increased his volume. \u201cWhat qualifications do you have to compete with me? Does the Blue Flower Family have more face than other people? You who eats soft rice, go and break the prison. Don\u2019t bother me before you break the prison. Ge is very busy, understand?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qinghua Zang Shui\u2019s face flushed turned black and then white. His entire figure wavered unsteadily.</p><br/><p>Puh!</p><br/><p>Qinghua Zang Shui\u2019s blurred figure suddenly exploded into a ball of light and disappeared.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo shook his head and sighed. \u201cHe is mentally weak, his mind is really low in quality!\u201d</p><br/><p>Turning around his face, he looked at the gaping Nan Yue and Cang Ze. He said, \u201cOoh, let\u2019s continue.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>\u201cAaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!\u201d</p><br/><p>A shriek filled with fury came from the room. Ji Cheng stopped in his steps and then forced himself to push open the door. Pia! An extremely fine crystal decoration smashed loudly beside his feet into countless pieces.</p><br/><p>Ji Cheng did not dare to block the shrapnel and allowed the crystal shards to hit his body. He wore a smile as he said in a fawning tone, \u201cSis, what is the matter? Who made you so angry? I\u2019ll go beat him up! Grind his bones into powder, skin him and pluck out his tendons \u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>His voice suddenly stopped. Ji Li Yu stared fiercely at him.</p><br/><p>Woah!</p><br/><p>Old Sis\u2019s angry face was filled with killing intent. In that pair of eyes that enchanted countless male yao was burning fire!</p><br/><p>Heavens! Ji Cheng felt his scalp tighten. He had never seen Old Sis so angry ever. He didn\u2019t know which pitiful person had infuriated Old Sis. So pitiful!</p><br/><p>In her anger, Old Sis did not recognize anyone. Ji Cheng was filled with regret. Why had he been so dumb to stare down the barrel of this gun.</p><br/><p>Ji Cheng knew the time to show his loyalty had come. He pretended to be angry and said, \u201cSis, don\u2019t be so anxious! I\u2019ll go send for people! They dare to provoke my sis, they must not want to live!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ji Li Yu stared at Ji Cheng for a while, which caused Ji Cheng\u2019s hairs to stand up.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright! Don\u2019t act in front of me!\u201d Ji Li Yu snorted coldly and sat down. There was still anger on her face, but she finally calmed down. She propped up her chin, and it was unknown if she was in a daze or considering something.</p><br/><p>Ji Cheng released a deep sigh inside. The most dangerous moment had past. However he knew that if he left at this time, he would definitely receive retribution. He carefully and curiously went forward. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>Which saint had caused Old Sis to be so furious? That skill wasn\u2019t just high! Ji Cheng was full of admiration towards this unknown expert to the point of kowtowing to his or her skills. Of course, he didn\u2019t dare to show any of it on his face.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy [Charm Clothing] was defeated.\u201d Ji Li Yu said lightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh!\u201d Ji Cheng was stunned. He was sincerely concerned now. \u201cAre you wounded?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ji Cheng released a breath but still wasn\u2019t able to believe it. \u201cHow is it possible? How can [Charm Clothing] be defeated?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Ji Family\u2019s [Sky Clothing] was full of transformations and was one of the few remaining earth level yao arts in the yao world. Many of the parts had been previously lost. Afterwards, the Ji Family had founded the Sky Clothing Yao Art House. Under accumulation of research and study over years, they finally recovered the original appearance. There were nine transformations of the Sky Clothing, [Charm Clothing] was one of them.</p><br/><p>But compared to the [Emperor Clothing] and [Domination Clothing] of the Ji Family, those that knew the [Charm Clothing] were the least common. Of the generations of Ji Family disciples, there were rarely those who cultivated the [Charm Clothing]. The conditions to cultivate [Charm Clothing] were extremely strict. It demanded that the one cultivating it was naturally beautiful with a flawless consciousness; but the most important part was that their heart had to be as clean as jade and untainted. The purer the heart, the stronger the power was in their hands.</p><br/><p>Even in the Ji Family, it was one of the most tightly guarded secrets that Ji Li Yu had successfully cultivated [Charm Clothing]. There were less than five people who knew. The most powerful quality of the [Charm Clothing] was that it was intangible and invisible as it affected others. It was one of the best illusory arts.</p><br/><p>Using the power of the [Charm Clothing], Ji Li Yu lived a really a good life. Ever since she was little, she was someone who had always been liked by all. After entering the yao art house, she became blinding and dazzling, she was the dream lover of countless young and accomplished yao. The second year she entered the yao art house, she entered the Genius Alliance and received attention from the leader of the Genius Alliance, Ming Yue Ye. The third year, she entered the Genius Alliance council of elders and became the youngest elder in the Alliance\u2019s history. After becoming the youngest elder of the Genius Alliance, she was appointed by Ming Yue Ye as the Relations Minister of the Genius Alliance and was specifically in charge of recruiting talent.</p><br/><p>She had completely utilized the powers of the [Charm Clothing]. These years, she had outstanding results, and her seat as an elder was rock solid.</p><br/><p>Even as the successor of the Ji Family and someone stronger, Ji Cheng still lived in her shadow.</p><br/><p>No one other than Ji Cheng who also cultivated [Sky Clothing] knew how powerful [Charm Clothing] was. From a certain perspective, it was a nearly undetectable illusory art, and its effects directly gripped the heart. He had personally seen countless vicious serial killers and mass murders face Old Sis with a face full of warmth.</p><br/><p>What kind of monster could bear to attack her?</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is that prison-breaking yao.\u201d Ji Li Yu\u2019s expression was slightly ugly.</p><br/><p>\u201cPrison-breaking yao?\u201d Ji Cheng stilled and then reacted in a moment. He stammered, \u201cThe master of the Wasteland Beast Chessboard? Old Sis, why did you provoke him? Did Ming Yue Ye send you to deal with him? It shouldn\u2019t be so, when did it become the elder\u2019s turn to attack?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho said we are attacking him?\u201d Ji Li Yu rolled her eyes, and her expression became even uglier. \u201cThe masses are talking so much about our failures. If the prison-breaking yao joined the Genius Alliance at this moment, what expression do you think those people would have?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ji Cheng pondered it for a while and then nodded. \u201cThis move is great! Completely pulling the carpet from beneath them! And then? You went to find him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEn, I had people keeping watch on that little girl called Nan Yue.\u201d Ji Li Yu\u2019s expression suddenly became black as she gritted. \u201cI just spoke, and that guy instantly flipped. Without a word, he used four attacks of a very strange yao art.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAttacked without a word?\u201d Ji Cheng\u2019s expression became slightly strange. \u201cOld Sis, is this a romantic debt that you left behind in the past?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ji Li Yu\u2019s eyes glared and frightened Ji Cheng to shrink his head back into his neck.</p><br/><p>But he could not bear his own curiosity and said, \u201cAnd then?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNothing?\u201d Ji Cheng was confused.</p><br/><p>\u201cI was directly thrown out of the Wasteland Beast Chessboard.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDirectly thrown out of the Wasteland Beast Chessboard \u2026 \u2026\u201d Ji Cheng stammered and then inhaled sharply! Whoa, this guy was that vicious? The first meeting and he threw Old Sis out of the Wasteland Beast Chessboard without a word \u2026 ..</p><br/><p>On pain of his death, Ji Cheng could promise Old Sis wouldn\u2019t easily let this matter go. He carefully asked. \u201cOld Sis, what are you planning to do now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph, this isn\u2019t finished!\u201d Ji Li Yi spat out with a dark face.</p><br/><p>In this instant, Ji Cheng was filled with sympathy for that vicious prison-breaking brother!</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>Qinghua Zang Shui\u2019s body uncontrollably trembled, his teeth were creaking. He was going mad from anger!</p><br/><p>He had been humiliated! The Blue Flower Family had been humiliated!</p><br/><p>Eating soft rice \u2026 \u2026 no qualifications \u2026 \u2026</p><br/><p>The words were like a poisonous snake continuously tearing and consuming his peerlessly proud heart.</p><br/><p>He suddenly raised his head, those who humiliate me, die!</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>\u201cThat right now wasn\u2019t good?\u201d Cang Ze weakly said. He suddenly remembered who that seductive female yao was. His heart had almost stopped breathing. He suddenly felt that the decision by the elders was a humongous mistake. Daren\u2019s conduct was completely unpredictable. In the blink of an eye, he had offended two big families.</p><br/><p>The Ji Family and Blue Flower Family!</p><br/><p>Heavens!</p><br/><p>Either of these families could lift a little finger and swept the Grey Clan out. He had just watched as Daren had humiliated the two big families. His heart was freezing cold.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe need to save time.\u201d Zuo Mo said unconcernedly, \u201cWho has the time to waste on these nobodies?\u201d</p><br/><p>Nobodies \u2026 \u2026 the Ji Family and the Blue Flower Family were nobodies \u2026 \u2026</p><br/><p>Cang Ze trembled. Just this matter was enough to create a conflict where blood would flow like rivers. He intelligently skipped past this problem. If he let Daren keep talking, the matter would become even worse. He finally understood the meaning of \u201cdisaster coming from the mouth.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you the prison-breaking yao?\u201d A weak voice passed over.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you guys so irritating?\u201d Zuo Mo was completely irritated by these people that constantly interrupted him. He turned around, and swore all over.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh!\u201d The female yelled and retreated five steps in fear.</p><br/><p>When Zuo Mo saw this was just a normal female, his anger instantly dissipated, but his tone was still slightly unfriendly. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou really are the prison-breaking yao?\u201d the little girl gathered her courage and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cPrison-breaking yao? If you mean the prison-breaking battle, yes, it\u2019s me,\u201d said Zuo Mo impatiently. \u201cIf you have something to say, say it quickly. Otherwise leave!\u201d Seeing that a big transaction was just going to be completed but being successively interrupted by others, Zuo Mo\u2019s mood could be imagined.</p><br/><p>\u201cWow! Great!\u201d The little girl was so excited she almost jumped up. \u201cI am a reporter for the Tomorrow Yao Channel, can I interview you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cInterview?\u201d Zuo Mo stilled. He thought about it and then said openly. \u201cNo problem, no problem, but you have to pay! Just a reminder, ge\u2019s price is very high!\u201d</p><br/><p>The little girl immediately turned to stone.</p><br/><p>Cang Ze and Nan Yue covered their faces and could not bear to watch.</p><br/><p>Translator Ramblings: That was such a nice debate about Zuo Mo\u2019s reaction to Ji Li Yu \u2026 \u2026 and it turns out he did not over-react. There was some really good logic that I hadn\u2019t even thought of like how Zuo Mo only reacted to the elder of Hundred Flower Pavilion after she used an illusion. It is a tricky skill. People will attribute what they feel to attraction towards the enemy rather than an illusion at work.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

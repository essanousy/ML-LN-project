He dares!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTrash! Trash \u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKill you! Kill you!\u201d</p><br/><p>The guard heard the shouts of the corps commander inside the room, and what followed immediately after was the sound of something crashing against the ground. His head shrank back. Thinking about the flesh and gore scattered around the room last time, his heart tightened.</p><br/><p>Daren was really frightening when angry!</p><br/><p>He was also slightly puzzled. Who had caused Daren to be so furious?</p><br/><p>These days, all of the Heavy Earth Corps had been immersed in joy. Who wasn\u2019t speaking positively of the Heavy Earth Corps? Everyone felt there was a shine to their faces. Supposedly, the military high command would visit the corps in a few days.</p><br/><p>Which unperceptive person was seeking death?</p><br/><p>The guard cursed inside but before he could think it through, a figure came out of the room. It was Daren! He jumped, and hurriedly bowed. However, Daren\u2019s face was dark and did not raise his head.</p><br/><p>Whoa, something major probably happened \u2026 \u2026</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>\u201cThis guy,\u201d Ji Cheng\u2019s expression was frozen. A moment later, his soul came back and he stammered, \u201cis he crazy? Too \u2026 \u2026 too domineering! Too arrogant \u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ji Li Yu did not seem to hear it. She looked dazedly at the youth inside the yao channel that was pointing at her. The youth on the yao channel had a gaze like a sword that did not retreat. That straight finger was the declaration of war!</p><br/><p>\u201cToo crazy!\u201d Ji Cheng shook his head and murmured as though he wanted to make himself believe it. He did not even know what he was saying. \u201cToo \u2026 \u2026 exhilarating!\u201d</p><br/><p>A long while later, the soulless Ji Cheng and the dazedly Ji Li Yu resumed normality. But the two sank into silence. They did not know what to say, and did not know what language to use to describe their mood at the moment.</p><br/><p>A youth that was not yet twenty had publicly challenged the commander of a corps!</p><br/><p>Such an insane even had never happened before in history, but it really happened in front of them. They had seen the entire process with their own eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cOld Sis, do you think Yu Heng will accept?\u201d Ji Cheng suddenly asked Ji Li Yu.</p><br/><p>Ji li Yu unconsciously bit her lips. \u201cDefinitely.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d Ji Cheng\u2019s tone was very complex. \u201cYu Heng will definitely accept! Xiao Mo Ge definitely would have predicted that Yu Heng will accept. It really is \u2026 \u2026 crazy!\u201d</p><br/><p>He repeatedly said \u201ccrazy\u201d as though this would be able to truly express his present emotions.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe all underestimated him.\u201d Ji Li Yu\u2019s gaze became clear again. Her usual intelligence also returned. She was very calm. \u201cXiao Mo Ge dares to give this sort of challenge means that he has something he can rely on.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ji Cheng nodded repeatedly. If he had some underestimation and scorn for Xiao Mo Ge before, then he was an admirer of Xiao Mo Ge now. Such a domineering and arrogant challenge, it was so exciting just thinking about it. He wouldn\u2019t even dare to think about it, much less do it!</p><br/><p>No matter if Xiao Mo Ge won or lost, Ji Cheng was completely subdued by the other\u2019s bravery and domineering.</p><br/><p>Without realizing it, Xiao Mo Ge had become Ji Cheng\u2019s idol. Even Ji Cheng did not realize this. He asked urgently, \u201cIs Xiao Mo Ge able to defeat Yu Heng?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo matter how powerful Xiao Mo Ge is, if it is a duel, he definitely is not Yu Heng\u2019s match. However,\u201d Ji Li Yu\u2019s eyes flashed, \u201cthey probably will compete in war chess. What Xiao Mo Ge disparaged was Yu Heng\u2019s skill as a battle general. If Yu Heng wants to wash this shame away, he must respond in this area. The only thing that can realize the two of them fighting is naturally war chess.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs Xiao Mo Ge also a powerful battle general?\u201d Ji Cheng\u2019s mouth was wide, his face disbelieving.</p><br/><p>\u201cMost likely!\u201d Ji Li Yu said to herself, \u201cSince he dares to make the challenge, then he definitely would have some chance of victory. Yu Heng is a gold battle general. To have a chance of victory, he can only be \u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA gold battle general!\u201d Ji Cheng exclaimed. He felt his brain wasn\u2019t enough to use</p><br/><p>Killing twenty six in a row, reconstructing a prison, all of this showed Xiao Mo Ge\u2019s powerful individual strength. With Xiao Mo Ge\u2019s age, it was enough to shock Ji Cheng. Now his Old Sis was telling him that Xiao Mo Ge was also a golden battle general!</p><br/><p>It was too crazy \u2026 \u2026 too crazy \u2026 \u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cImpossible! Impossible!\u201d Ji Cheng unconsciously murmured. He felt his brain was short-circuiting. How was it possible? It was absurd! A guy of the same age as him that not only possessed great individual power, but was also a golden battle general. Was the world crazy? Had golden battle generals become lettuce selling on the market?</p><br/><p>His mind was ringing. But Old Sis\u2019 tone was so confident that he believed it. Every time Old Sis used this tone to give a arrive at a conclusion, then the result of this matter basically would not change too much. From young until now, it had always been so!</p><br/><p>How was it possible \u2026 \u2026</p><br/><p>Ji Cheng suddenly felt a deep blow. His heart felt bitter. Compared to Xiao Mo Ge, he felt he was like a pig. The difference between them was so great that he could not gather the courage to compare the two of them.</p><br/><p>Ji Li Yu noticed her younger brother\u2019s expression. She paused slightly and then understood. She lightly said, \u201cI feel that many people were wrong from the start.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWrong about what?\u201d Ji Cheng\u2019s face was puzzled.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Mo Ge\u2019s identity is still a riddle. Many people assume that he is from a poor background and has no foundation.\u201d Ji Li Yu shook her head and said, \u201cLooking at it now, this speculation is absurdly incorrect. Xiao Mo Ge isn\u2019t from a poor background and his origins are definitely not simple. He may even have a very important background!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Ji Cheng had not refused from his shock.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is possible to be from a poor background and still have powerful yao arts, but if he is a powerful battle general, how can he of humble birth? Xiao Mo Ge either is from a prestigious family background, or he has a famed teacher!\u201d Ji Li Yu explained.</p><br/><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Ji Cheng realized.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe other\u2019s birth might be even higher than our Ji Family, and have a deeper history!\u201d Ji Li Yu said.</p><br/><p>Ji Cheng\u2019s grey face finally recovered some blood. Thinking about it this way, he felt much better.</p><br/><p>\u201cI really anticipate this!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>\u201cHow was it? Was my performance not bad?\u201d Zuo Mo smugly asked Wei.</p><br/><p>Wei smiled slightly. \u201cVery good!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo wouldn\u2019t be fooled by Wei\u2019s humble and gentle appearance any more. In front of the cunning and sly Pu Yao, Wei was definitely playing Mister Good. Wei was one that was persistence in his beliefs. However, Zuo Mo discovered through this matter that of the three of them, this guy had the highest skill at fooling people.</p><br/><p>Full of righteousness, a good appearance \u2026 \u2026</p><br/><p>Even if he was making a great lie, Wei\u2019s eyes would still be filled with sincerity. Zuo Mo was suspicious that this guy was practiced in doing things in the shadows, while showing a pious face.</p><br/><p>This guy was a charlatan!</p><br/><p>But it had to be said that after Wei\u2019s teachings, Zuo Mo\u2019s performance could be said to be perfect.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat should we do now?\u201d Zuo Mo asked Pu Yao curiously. \u201cDo I really have to fight him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need, no need.\u201d Pu Yao showed a very proud smile, and then smiled mysteriously. \u201cYou will know soon!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>The matter of Xiao Mo Ge publicly challenging Yu Heng became an even hotter topic.</p><br/><p>The recording yao art of his one against four battle was spread far. After seeing the entire battle, many people couldn\u2019t help but agree with Xiao Mo Ge\u2019s words. It was true. From the recording yao art, the performances of the four combat yao were not worthy of praise.</p><br/><p>Yu Heng\u2019s impassioned performance changed meaning in front of this recording yao art.</p><br/><p>The rumours about the Heavy Earth Corps in the cities became even more rampant: the Heavy Earth Corps were rotten from the core, there were secrets about the identity of Commander Yu Heng\u2019s gold battle general status.</p><br/><p>Yu Heng deeply experienced what it felt like to fall from the heavens into the pits of hell.</p><br/><p>The military command that had been praising him previously changed their attitudes and their tone became stern. This time, they had come out and scolded him. They were all straightforward and old generals. These old general did not care about showing off. However, the level of the military decreasing and the loss of combat capabilities were subjects of their deep hatred.</p><br/><p>Even more, the front lines had just experienced losses. Some people even speculated the reason that Fierce Fire Corps and Ice Frost Corpse were exterminated were because they were like the Heavy Earth Corps, rotten, in decline, and unable to stand up in a fight.</p><br/><p>The pressure on Yu Heng shot up.</p><br/><p>His face was dark every day. He threw his nephew Yu Zi Zhou far away. The mood in Heavy Earth Corps was very low. The experienced Yu Heng knew that if the other dared to challenge him like this then they had tricks to follow up with. He could see it clearly. No matter if he won or lost, there was no benefit to him.</p><br/><p>If he won, the opponent was a youth and the victory was not honourable, it was expected and nothing to boast about.</p><br/><p>But if he lost \u2026 \u2026</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t dare think of this result!</p><br/><p>Such poisonous schemes!</p><br/><p>Yu Heng\u2019s face was black.</p><br/><p>A while later, he raised his head. His eyes were murderous. He squeezed the words through his teeth, \u201cAccept the battle!\u201d</p><br/><p>The second day, an enormous war chess was being set up on the Wasteland Beast Chessboard.</p><br/><p>All of the topography of this war chess was personally designed by famed war chess master He Yong. To set up this match, the famed Water Caltrop Yao Art House, had sent large numbers of teachers that spent three whole days constructing it.</p><br/><p>This was a war chess match that was unprecedented.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>Gongsun Cha swallowed a fiend soul beast bead and channelled his core scripture. He continuously absorbed soul base source from the fiend soul beast bead.</p><br/><p>By now, his core scripture was in its beginning form and its power had started to show, especially when he was giving commands. He didn\u2019t need to rely on even one talisman to be able to pass his orders to every soldier.</p><br/><p>His core scripture flowed. His mind was able to maintain clarity from beginning to end. For a battle general, that was more important than anything.</p><br/><p>His sudden increase in skill did not cause any joy to appear on his face. Thinking about his defeat last time, there seemed to be a fire burning inside.</p><br/><p>He planned on challenge that old guy today!</p><br/><p>This time, he had to defeat the other!</p><br/><p>Entering war chess like usual, he sent a challenge to the other without fear. Previously, whenever he sent out the challenge, the other would unhesitatingly start a match.</p><br/><p>But the chess match did not start today. Gongsun Cha frowned. The Lil\u2019 Miss in times of battle was a completely different person than usual. At this moment, a dark voice sounded next to his ear, \u201cThere\u2019s a new match, do you dare to come?\u201d</p><br/><p>New chess match? Who cares if it is a new chess match opponent or an old one! I will defeat all of them!</p><br/><p>Full of motivation, Gongsun Cha was ignited by these light words.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome!\u201d</p><br/><p>Translator Ramblings: Nyasmus, it is \u201cthe Materialist(Zuo Mo), narcissist(Pu), fake gentleman chivalry (Wei).\u201d Wei\u2019s not chivalrous at all.</p><br/><p>If Yu Heng hadn\u2019t wanted so much publicity, glory and was willing to apologize, none of this would have happened. It could have been just a \u201cmy nephew is young and rash, please forgive him.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

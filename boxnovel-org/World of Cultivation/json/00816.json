While the influence of the underground had silently grown in recent years, every leader with a clear head knew that this golden age of prosperity was a temporary by-product of the inner conflict in the council of elders.</p><br/><p>But the collapse of [Snapped Red Silk] still caused an earthquake in the underground world.</p><br/><p>In truth, [Snapped Red Silk] did not have large territories, but their skilled management made the faction a firmly established one. Their feelers reached into every corner of their territory.</p><br/><p>Unless it was a matter of life and death, there were not many factions that would touch them.</p><br/><p>They were strong for their size, and one would have to pay a significant price to defeat them. Also, [Snapped Red Silk]\u2019s base was like an impenetrable barrel of metal. Even if one won, it was a complex and troublesome matter to digest a territory.</p><br/><p>[Snapped Red Silk] was strong because they were wealthy. The reason that they were wealthy was because they had a monopoly over the local low level materials business.</p><br/><p>The profit in low material business was not high. But because the majority of powerful factions were not willing to waste manpower on controlling this business it was left to the underground factions. [Snapped Red Silk] was like all other underground powers. They usually were greatly connected to the lowest rungs of society. They had abundant manpower and no competition from large factions. [Snapped Red Silk] had quickly taken over almost seven tenths of the low level materials business in their territory.</p><br/><p>Any business if it was a monopoly would gain great profits even if the profit margin was slim. Low level materials were not eye-catching but they were traded in great volume.</p><br/><p>The [Snapped Red Silk] that had a monopoly over the market started to manipulate the market to obtain even more profit.</p><br/><p>They were skilled and the prices they gave the large factions were far lower than market price. With this method, they hadn\u2019t affected the benefits of the major factions, and even built a terrifying web of connections.</p><br/><p>Yet a faction like this had been exterminated.</p><br/><p>The faction that had destroyed it was called [Black Fire]</p><br/><p>[Black Fire] was a relatively unknown name in the underground world but this unknown little faction had defeated [Snapped Red Silk] that everyone had been unable to deal with. It really was fantastical.</p><br/><p>The tentacles of the underground factions were like an invisible spider-web. Any gust of wind or movement would be felt. Soon, all kinds of intelligence about [Black Fire] ended up on the desks of leaders everywhere.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>Youqin Lie\u2019s recent days were extremely comfortable, and there was a joyful expression on his dark face that could not be disguised.</p><br/><p>He had a few more powerful fighters under his command. The struggles of [Snapped Red Silk] were like that of a wild beast at the end of its life. After their last struggle had been blocked, they completely fell apart.</p><br/><p>Compared to the difficulty of the battles before, the battles after the added personnel were so easy it was like sightseeing.</p><br/><p>However, eliminating the remaining of [Snapped Red Silk]\u2019s power was slightly troublesome. While Youqin Lie was young, he was skilled and cunning. The secret pieces that he had set up before were now coming into use.</p><br/><p>\u201cMany thanks everyone.\u201d Youqin Lie expressionlessly stated his thanks. Next to him, Tao Wei and the others looked with complicated expressions as Nan Yue and the others.</p><br/><p>The underground world did not lack for experts like Wu Ying who were strong. But the people in front of them were so strong they felt fear and awe. Experts of this level could only be supported by those large factions.</p><br/><p>Boss\u2019 support was really unfathomable!</p><br/><p>Tao Wei and the others could see that while Nan Yue\u2019s group was strong, they were definitely not people that worked in the shadows. They did not have any presence of darkness, and their personalities were honest and straightforward like their way of fighting.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo problem.\u201d Wariness flashed across Nan Yue\u2019s eyes. She had an instinctive wariness of these people of the shadows. If she did not see it with her own eyes, she would not believe that Daren would have this kind of faction that worked in the shadows.</p><br/><p>She asked directly, \u201cWhat do we need to do next? If possible, we hope to finish as soon as possible.\u201d</p><br/><p>The gazes of everyone behind her gathered on Youqin Lie. They were extremely wary of this young but extremely vicious and cunning youth. They had watched as Youqin Lie expressionlessly executed more than thirty people. This guy was a demon. They only hoped now to finish their mission as soon as possible and then leave this place.</p><br/><p>They liked sunlight and not darkness.</p><br/><p>Youqin Lie jerked the corners of his lips. It could have been in mirth or disdain.</p><br/><p>But he turned and nodded at Tao Wei. Tao Wei understood and took out a jade scroll to hand to Nan Yue. Nan Yue took the jade scroll with some puzzlement and then started to read</p><br/><p>\u201cThis person is one of Daren\u2019s targets.\u201d</p><br/><p>Youqin Lie\u2019s voice carried a darkness that would make people feel cold.</p><br/><p>Nan Yue finished reading and handed the jade scroll to others. She raised her head, \u201cI cannot see what is special about this person.:</p><br/><p>Tao Wei smiled slightly. Her lips moved and an enchanting voice spread. \u201cCang Ling Xue, female, twenty six, a member of the Grey Family.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGrey Family?\u201d Cang Ze couldn\u2019t help but say. He was curious at encountering someone with the same surname as him.</p><br/><p>Tao Wei did not know why Cang Ze was shocked. She continued to give a detailed explanation, \u201cThe Cang Family of Nu Flat Jie. It is a local faction. Her parents passed away when she was eleven and she became the family head, the youngest family head in the history of the Grey Family.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nan Yue immediately had a feeling of empathy. This was a situation similar to the one she experienced in the past. She knew just how difficult it was for a child of eleven to become the family head.</p><br/><p>\u201cNu Flat Jie\u2019s other factions all assumed that the Grey Family\u2019s decline was certain, and this included factions that were enemies of the Grey Family. Therefore, three local factions allied together and attacked the Grey Family. Yet no one expected was that the Grey Family defeated the three families under the leadership of Cang Ling Xue. This battle made the Grey Family and Cang Ling Xue famous in the Nu Flat Jie.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone listened, enchanted. Many people had astonished expressions. This would have been so difficult for an eleven year old girl.</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter that, the Grey Family quickly grew in power under the leadership of Cang Ling Xue. Three years later, the Grey Family became one of the five biggest factions in Nu Flat Jie. Under her initiative, the five strongest families of Nu Flat formed the Nu Flat Merchant Association. The chair was Cang Ling Xue. That year, she was fifteen.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everone gaped as they heard this.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Nu Flat Merchant Association developed quickly and in the following years, their business expanded to more than thirty of the surrounding jie. Oh, I forgot to tell everyone, Cang Ling Xue is seventeen this year.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo there are really geniuses in the world!\u201d Nan Yue couldn\u2019t help but sigh in astonishment.</p><br/><p>The orange haired yao crowded over and said shamelessly, \u201cIs Sister Nan talking about me?\u201d</p><br/><p>A Wen coldly said, \u201cIdiot!\u201d</p><br/><p>Nan Yue\u2019s eyebrow twitched. These two were starting again! She brought out her killing move. \u201cShut up! Don\u2019t forget what Boss said before you left.\u201d</p><br/><p>The orange haired yao shrunk his head back, and said, \u201cGood brothers are loyal, I am peerlessly loyal!\u201d</p><br/><p>A Wen was silent.</p><br/><p>A look flashed through Tao Wei\u2019s eyes. She looked at Boss. Boss\u2019 eyes were closed.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease continue,\u201d Nan Yue said.</p><br/><p>\u201cCang Ling Xue is skilled in management. Under her reins, the Cang Family is not just organized, it has quickly grown. Her talent and skill also aroused the attention of many factions. The Nu Flat Merchant Association has some power, but compared to the larger factions, it isn\u2019t worth a mention. I heard that even the Council of Elders is interested in her.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tao Wei\u2019s eyes moved. \u201cDo you know what is the best way to recruit a young female?\u201d</p><br/><p>Nan Yue said coolly, \u201cForce a marriage!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tao Wei laughed lightly. \u201cMiss Nan Yue is really smart. There are many ways of dealing with Cang Ling Xue. Cang Ling Xue does not have much to bargain with. The most effective method is a marriage proposal. Cang Ling Xue is beautiful, she is rich, and skilled in management. It will be greatly profitable if one could marry this kind of woman! Up until now, Cang Ling Xue has received over ten marriage proposals. None of these factions are ones that she, or the Nu Flat Merchant Association can afford to offend.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThese people should be killed!\u201d A Wen who hated being forced to do anything said in fury.</p><br/><p>The orange haired yao said righteously, \u201cOnly a genius can save a beautiful maiden \u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Nan Yue ignored the two of them. \u201cWhat does she have to do with us.\u201d</p><br/><p>Youqin Lie who had been resting with his eyes closed suddenly opened his eyes. \u201cThis is one of the targets from the higher ups. Do not ask me the reason. You only need to know that she is your target and I will help you complete the mission.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do we have to do?\u201d Ming Jue Zi asked. Of the group, he had the most ideas.</p><br/><p>\u201cI lean towards kidnapping her.\u201d Youqin Lie shrugged and seemed cunning like a fox. \u201cHowever, this is your mission. You will decide how to carry out your mission. The higher-ups want to recruit a talent that is skilled at internal management. Of course, if you accidentally damage her, we have other targets.\u201d</p><br/><p>Such a cold and emotionless person. Nan Yue\u2019s dislike increased. However, Ming Jue Zi answered before she did, \u201cYou mean that after completing this, we have other targets to reach?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Youqin Lie said coolly, \u201cThe preliminary list to investigate was one hundred and three people. After investigation and selection based on the higher up\u2019s criteria, there are sixteen in left.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSixteen people!\u201d</p><br/><p>Nan Yue and the others gaped. This number surprised their imagination.</p><br/><p>\u201cThese sixteen are all talented, each of them is not from strong faction and are easy to get to.\u201d Youqin Lie looked at the group and jerked the corners of his mouth. \u201cYou should thank me, I helped you finish a ;large part of the work. There are eight that are already taken care of through terror, kidnapping and bribery, and another one we just got from [Snapped Red Silk].\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou mean we have seven left?\u201d Ming Jue Zi immediately caught the point.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Youqin Lie said expressionlessly, \u201cI suggest you first go after Cang Ling Xue. In the ranking from the higher-ups, she has the highest score. While the final result will only be known after they fight it out, I favor her. Also, the level of this mission is [Bird]. I believe that you know what this means.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nan Yue and the others were shocked.</p><br/><p>Translator Ramblings: Despite the same name, Cang Ling Xue is of no relationship to Ze.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

People\u2019s attentions naturally were on the increasingly complex state of the world. Many experts had returned to their clans to participate in the war. Great Peace City had been silent for a long time as a result but as the state of some places stabilized, experts, like Lan Tian Long, came back, Great Peace City recovered its usual atmosphere.</p><br/><p>Pang Chen had died! The opponent was a newcomer! Two punches!</p><br/><p>The mo who had watched the fight in person tried their best to describe the dominance and terrifying nature of the two punches. The promise of ten moves by Pang Chen to Miss Hua Ning became the biggest joke of the challenge.</p><br/><p>The mirage of this challenge was a hot seller. The enthusiasm of the Great Peace citizen erupted!</p><br/><p>How many years had it been since a newcomer beat a famous warrior?</p><br/><p>As the rules were perfected, challenges that crossed levels in status like this were rarer to see. No one was concerned about why Pang Chen had challenged Zuo Mo. They only knew that Pang Chen had died on the hands of a newcome!</p><br/><p>Newcomer!</p><br/><p>They quickly found that even now, they did not know what this newcomer was called.</p><br/><p>So people started to investigate.</p><br/><p>The name of Butcher Guard Camp that killed three thousand bandits with one hundred people, rescued Tao Xing\u2019s group on their way, used one attack to defeat the King Yaksha, and caused hundreds of green yaksha to flee \u2026 \u2026</p><br/><p>He became even more mysterious!</p><br/><p>Now, many factions paid attention this newcomer that had come out of nowhere.</p><br/><p>Great Peace City seemed to come alive.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Pang Chen is dead?\u201d Bu Heng\u2019s wine cup crumbled to dust in his hands.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d The subordinate hurriedly played a mirage.</p><br/><p>Bu Heng stared motionlessly at the mirage as though he was paralyzed.</p><br/><p>The mirage perfectly captured the entire process. Without any effort, Bu Heng could catch every detail. Even outside the mirage, Bu Heng felt his mind shudder at the other\u2019s domineering punch.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe underestimated him,\u201d Bu Hen suddenly said. He straightened his back, and his expression became peaceful again.</p><br/><p>He had seen the mirage of Pang Chen and Qi Diao Yu\u2019s fight. Qi Diao Yu had not used all of his power, but Pang Chen was definitely on of the top fighters in order to withstand thirty of Qi Diao Yu\u2019s moves. Also, Pang Chen had improved over the years, and even had had a breakthrough at the end, but he was still killed by that one punch.</p><br/><p>Just who was this person?</p><br/><p>The other seemed to have come out of nowhere. Even now, they had not identified the other\u2019s origins.</p><br/><p>This caused Bu Heng to feel anxious.</p><br/><p>Bu Heng was not worried about individual strength. From his angle, while that punch was domineering and mind-shaking, if the other did not have a strong background, he still had many ways of eliminating the other.</p><br/><p>This was Great Peace City. This place never lacked for experts!</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>\u201cA Zha Ge, I heard you lost a while ago?\u201d a large man laughed, his tone teasing.</p><br/><p>A Zha Ge was not angry and said with a smile, \u201cI encountered a very powerful xiuzhe battle general. He isn\u2019t just strong. His battalion is clearly much weaker than mine but he was able to fight me to standstill. If our battalions were the same strength, I probably would not be able to win.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo powerful?\u201d The large man was surprised. \u201cA Zha Ge, you are one of the three great battle generals of our Stellar Rahula Clan. Even you are not a match?\u201d</p><br/><p>A Zha Ge grimaced and spread his hands. \u201cI\u2019m really not a match.\u201d</p><br/><p>The large man\u2019s surprise increased. He knew that A Zha Ge would not joke about a matter like this. After a moment of thought, he said, \u201cHow do you think Bi Shan compares to him?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bi Shan was the head of the three Stellar Rahula Clan battle generals, and he had never lost in his life.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot as good.\u201d A Zha Ge shook his head.</p><br/><p>The large man\u2019s expression became serious. \u201cIs he a disciple from the Big Four? Xuan Kong Temple has produced that Jiang Zhe who recently took over Cold Mountain Jie. Many people are rallying together now in preparation to take back Cold Mountain Jie.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe is not a disciple from the Four Sects. I asked him, they are from Cloud Sea Jie. I detected from his tone that they do not like the Big Four very much.\u201d A Zha Ge was an attentive person despite his easy-going nature. \u201cThe reason that they attacked Middle Granary Jie seems to be for the chaos rift to this side.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo they want to invade the mo territories?\u201d The large man\u2019s expression changed slightly. Who could not be on their guard when there was a powerful opponent next to them?</p><br/><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t seem like it.\u201d A Zha Ge thought and the nsaid, \u201cFrom the discussion I had with them, they are not the same as the Big Four, and they do not seem to be hostile to mo. Also, there are not many of them. They would need to take a long time to stabilize Middle Granary Jie. They seemed to want the chaos rift for a certain goal.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you plan to do?\u201d The large man\u2019s expression eased.</p><br/><p>\u201cBecome allies!\u201d A Zha Ge said crisply. \u201cIt would be terrifying to have such a strong battle general as an enemy. It is much better to become friends. It will be worth it even if I have to pay a price.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEn, if he is as strong as you say, this is right,\u201d the large man nodded and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow is the progress on Bi Shan and the other\u2019s end?\u201d A Zha Ge asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot very smooth.\u201d The large man shook his head, his expression worried. \u201cThey encountered trouble. Gongye Xiao Rong\u2019s reputation is not as famous as Jiang Zhe, but he is just lacking a major victory. Bi Shan has lost two times already. Fortunately, the losses were not large. Bi Shan is planning on allying with the yao in the area. However, the battle general of that yao battalion is very young, and it is a female!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFemale? A Zha Ge stilled.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, she\u2019s called Mu Xi. She is from a famous family, the Palace Lake Mu Clan but she is too young. I\u2019m slightly worried.\u201d The large man\u2019s expression was slightly displeased. He clearly felt discontent that their ally had sent a little girl.</p><br/><p>A Zha Ge was also worried but he still comforted, \u201cPalace Lake Wood Clan is a famed family. If they dare to send this little girl, she definitely is extraordinary in some aspect.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI hope it is so!\u201d The large man grimaced and suddenly said, \u201cWhat do you think about the state of affairs?\u201d</p><br/><p>A Zha Ge smiled. \u201cTo use a common saying, a new era has arrived.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow so?\u201d the large man asked interestedly.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Sky-Splitting Calamity has pushed the yaomo and xiuzhe that used to be separated by Blood Sky Metropolis Jie back together. It is unavoidable for yaomo and xiuzhe to mix together.\u201d A Zha Ge\u2019s expression was extremely serious.</p><br/><p>The large man shook his head in disagreement. \u201cWe and the xiuzhe have generations of blood and hate between us, how can we mix?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAs there is more and more contact between yaomo and xiuzhe. The mixing cannot be stopped. There are so many chaos rifts, who can seal them all? This whirlpool will increase in size, no one can escape. We will definitely be fighting now, but there will be a day when everyone gets tired of fighting and will naturally come together,\u201d A Zha Ge said with a chuckle.</p><br/><p>The large man found it hard to accept what A Zha Ge said. He shook his head and said with a smile, \u201cYour thoughts are always different than everyone else.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTime would prove everything.\u201d A Zha Ge raised an eyebrow.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>Turtle Island.</p><br/><p>Ma Fan\u2019s face almost scrunched into a ball. Looking at the busy campsite, he rubbed his head. He really wanted to complain and say \u201cSo troublesome,\u201d but when the words reached his mouth, he swallowed them.</p><br/><p>Right now, he was the commander of a camp, and he could not be as carefree as before and do as he wished.</p><br/><p>Ever since Lil\u2019Miss put Black Turtle Camp into his hands, he put almost all of his mind and heart into it. Like a sponge, he furiously soaked up knowledge about being a battle general and spent all his time on this.</p><br/><p>The strength of Black Turtle Camp had continuously increased. As Turtle Island\u2019s status in Cloud Sea Jie continued to stabilize, there were greater numbers of young and accomplished people that came to participate. The average strength level was much higher.</p><br/><p>Other than an occasional inspection, Lil\u2019 Miss did not pay too much attention to Black Turtle Camp. Black Turtle Camp was created entirely based on Ma Fan\u2019s thoughts.</p><br/><p>The skeleton of Black Turtle Camp was the Sky Peak Platoon and the other members were local xiuzhe. There were many jindan xiuzhe but in terms of combat ability, they were very lacking compared to the jindan of Vermillion Bird Camp. Even more troublesome was that these xiuzhe were from different families and had different spells and talismans they used. There were dhyana xiu, roaming xiu, and sword xiu.</p><br/><p>Ma Fan knew that his battle general skill level was limited so he changed his usual laid-back personality and paid careful attention to details.</p><br/><p>Maybe it was because he had been the tactical center before that Ma Fan was most skilled in micro-tactics. All of Black Turtle Camp followed him in this.</p><br/><p>He made up teams, one after the next, and designed small-area tactics for all of them.</p><br/><p>Black Turtle Camp was like a smorgasbord. The xiuzhe in each team were of different types and each team\u2019s tactics were different. At many times, Ma Fan felt that his Black Turtle Camp was like the clothing of a beggar, patched together.</p><br/><p>He especially longed for the pleasure of Vermillion Bird Camp\u2019s thousand swords moving at once. However, he could only be envious.</p><br/><p>Whenever these thoughts occurred, then it was the time that Black Turtle Camp\u2019s training increased drastically.</p><br/><p>The training intensity of Black Turtle Camp was based on Vermillion Bird Camp\u2019s standard. The amount of training was so high that many local xiuzhe complained. However, Ma Fan was a cunning person. If someone wanted to slack off under his eyes, that was akin to seeking death.</p><br/><p>The sword formations were like cages dripping with blood as they were set up around the training camp. Wanted to slack off? Then in you go!</p><br/><p>Ma Fan did not have a high opinion of Black Turtle Camp but what surprised him was that when Lil\u2019 Miss came for an inspection, Lil\u2019 Miss had praised him.</p><br/><p>When he saw the red eyes of Wei Ran and the others, Ma Fan felt his entire body lightened. Whenever he went back to think about this, Ma Fan\u2019s mood would become much better.</p><br/><p>However, while Black Turtle Camp had also participated in the fight for Middle Granary Jie, they were still overshadowed by Vermillion Bird Camp. He was not very happy.</p><br/><p>This time, Ma Fan had come back to Turtle Island with orders for Black Turtle Camp to engrave formations.</p><br/><p>Supposedly, Turtle Island\u2019s mo matrixes had had a breakthrough. Golden Crow Camp could engrave even more powerful formations. Lil\u2019 Miss who felt that the camp\u2019s strength was not enough decided to have Black Turtle Camp go back to get formations engraved.</p><br/><p>However, they had to wait for a few days. Golden Crow Camp still had a few mo who had not finished.</p><br/><p>Ma Fan was not in a hurry. Returning to Turtle Island, he felt very close to this. However, he still spent his time on the training of Black Turtle Camp. He was continuously correcting and adjusting the problems exposed during the battles of Middle Granary Jie.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, a paper crane flew in front of Ma Fan.</p><br/><p>Before he even unfolded it, Ma Fan\u2019s expression changed. This type of paper crane would only be used for an emergency report!</p><br/><p>He unfolded the paper crane.</p><br/><p>\u2013Enemy Invasion! Jie river!</p><br/><p>Translator Ramblings: Poor Ma Fan, forced skill development. If you want to blame someone, blame your boss with the weird luck.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

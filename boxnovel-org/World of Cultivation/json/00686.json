If Daren leaves, then Rare Artifact Hall will immediately face a calamity.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo thought and found that Yi An\u2019s analysis was correct. The Yao Council of Elders was a great power. If they wanted to do something from the shadows, then Rare Artifact Hall would be unable to stop them. He would also not stay for a long time at Bu Zhou City.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou may say what you think,\u201d Zuo Mo asked.</p><br/><p>Yi An said in a respectful voice that was filled with confidence. \u201cDaren is must deal with many great matters, and does not have the time for minor matters. While Rare Artifact Hall is not one of the biggest businesses in the mo territories, we have a stable foundation. We can become Daren\u2019s hand in gathering is distributing materials, transporting resources and selling items.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo was truly surprised now. He hadn\u2019t thought that Yi An\u2019s plan was to fully submit to him. Deeply established family businesses like Rare Artifacts Hall were factions in their own right and would not easily submit to other factions.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will agree this to this.\u201d Zuo Mo thought and then said, \u201cBut you need to think it though. Once you pick a side, you will not be as idle and free as you are now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yi An\u2019s expression was joyful as he unhesitatingly bowed. \u201cThis subordinate has thought this though and this is not an impulse.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo was very satisfied. Yi An\u2019s Rare Artifacts Hall was an unexpected hall. No matter if it was Yi An\u2019s great experience in managing a business, or Rare Artifacts Hall\u2019s enormous mercantile network, they were all things that the present Mo Cloud Sea desperately needed now.</p><br/><p>This was free food dropping down from the sky!</p><br/><p>\u201cDo not spread the news right now.\u201d Zuo Mo paused and thought.</p><br/><p>Yi An immediately understood. \u201cYes!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo said, \u201cIt is too dangerous outside. Stay here now, and prepare an auction for the [Angel Device Raiment].\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDaren is planning to sell the [Angel Device Raiment]?\u201d Yi An was stunned.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, sell it, it is just a pseudo-shen device.\u201d Zuo Mo nodded and did not expand further. He said casually, \u201cJust some simple preparations.\u201d</p><br/><p>Finishing, he disappeared.</p><br/><p>He left behind a shocked Yi An. Only now did Yi An realize why even the Yao Council of Elders had come to participate in this event. Pseudo-shen device, the [Angel Device Raiment] was a pseudo-shen device.</p><br/><p>Yi An had never seen a shen device and could not make a professional evaluation but just the name was enough to make countless people crazy.</p><br/><p>\u2018Just a pseudo-shen device.\u2019</p><br/><p>Daren was probably the only one that dared to say it like that. The shock on Yi An\u2019s face turned into a grimace.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>Staring at the five Reverse Shadow Soul Silkgrasses in the box.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo couldn\u2019t help but become excited. For this he had almost traversed through the greater portion of Hundred Savage Realm. In order to not be disturbed, Zuo Mo came to the underground sacrificial altar.</p><br/><p>A Gui and the Black Gold Seal Solder were both standing guard underground. The yin energy was of benefit to A Gui, and the Black Gold Seal Soldier liked yin energy. He copied the bone armor, swallowing yin energy and then spitting it out. He played about happily.</p><br/><p>Staring at the Reverse Shadow Soul Silkgrasses in the box, for some reason, Zuo Mo\u2019s heartbeat suddenly sped up.</p><br/><p>Strangely, he was slightly nervous.</p><br/><p>Those riddles that circled his mind, the voice that repeatedly appeared in his dreams, they would all be answered soon. His birth, his previous memories \u2026 \u2026</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo stared dazedly at the Reverse Shadow Soul SIlkgrass. He didn\u2019t move at all.</p><br/><p>A moment later, his body trembled. His dazed eyes finally recovered a thread of clarity. His practiced wooden face became alive and his eyes focused.</p><br/><p>He exhaled deeply and turned to look at A Gui who was stand guard silently. For some reason, the bewilderment and nervousness he felt immediately disappeared.</p><br/><p>He laughed mockingly at his own weakness. Determination and bravery returned to his eyes.</p><br/><p>He threw a Reverse Shadow Soul Silkgrass into his mouth.</p><br/><p>Something seemed to explode in his mind. Countless streaks of light and sound came at him from all directions.</p><br/><p>Boom!</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo\u2019s mind was completely bland and he was in a daze.</p><br/><p>There seemed to be countless people speaking at his ear. He couldn\u2019t make out what they were saying. Countless scenes flashed across his eyes but he could not see anything clearly.</p><br/><p>Too much information suddenly sprouted out of his memories and surrounded him.</p><br/><p>Even with such a strong consciousness, Zuo Mo could not tolerate so many scenes and voices.</p><br/><p>The blurry scenes and the noisy sounds seemed to drift far away.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo\u2019s world became calm again.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>Hiding in a corner filled with rubble, a boy trembled.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe definitely have to get it!\u201d On the other side of the damaged wall, the boy could hear the viciousness in the man\u2019s voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cReally?\u201dA woman\u2019s light laugh sounded. \u201cKun Lun is really Kun Lun, this present, tsk tsk, different from everyone else! However, before the old woman died, why didn\u2019t I hear Kun Lun act so domineering?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph! Go to the side, I feel irritated when I see your Xuan Kong Temple\u2019s falseness!\u201d the man said disdainfully.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou really wound me, I want to ally with you. If that thing ends up in the hands of Tian Huan and Xi Xian \u2026 \u2026\u201d The woman pretended to be wounded and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need,\u201d the man said proudly, \u201cWe, Kun Lun, never need to ally with anyone.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t waste effort, it cannot be used, the jinzhi cannot be opened.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMotherf***er, we spent so much energy to get this pile of scrap metal?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey may have detected something. However, they would not bear for it to become scrap metal, they would definitely have something else up their sleeve.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDid someone manage to escape?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere seems to be one child that we have not found.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDumbass! How can such a mistake happen?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe is trash. He doesn\u2019t like cultivating, and I heard that the old woman did not like him \u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho is he to the old woman?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe old woman\u2019s grandson \u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou idiot! Go find him! No matter what, find him! I want to see him alive or dead!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>In a dark and damp secret room, the small boy looked with intoxication at the mysterious patterns in front of him. For some reason he felt strangely close to these mysterious patterns. Especially those from the many jade scrolls, these would cause him to feel intimacy and warmth.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho let you in?\u201d A cold and shrill voice suddenly came from behind him.</p><br/><p>The young boy\u2019s hand shook and the jade scroll dropped to the ground. He turned around. An old woman with an icy expression was looking at him expressionlessly.</p><br/><p>\u201cI \u2026 \u2026 I \u2026 \u2026\u201d The young boy\u2019s face was ashen white.</p><br/><p>\u201cSpeak!\u201d the old woman shouted harshly.</p><br/><p>\u201cI, I solved, I solved the jinzhi \u2026 \u2026\u201d Terror filled the young boy\u2019s mind and he stammered.</p><br/><p>The old woman was silent.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou like these things very much?\u201d</p><br/><p>A moment later, the old woman suddenly spoke. Her expression was still cold but for some reason, she did not seem to be as intimidating as before.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d The young boy\u2019s terror decreased greatly as he bowed his head and spoke.</p><br/><p>The old woman\u2019s gaze was piercing and the young boy didn\u2019t dare to raise his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cThese are the things that you father left you. I do not agree, but you have still found your way in. Starting from today, this place belongs to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>The old woman finished speaking expressionlessly and turned to leave.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>\u201cStarting today, she is your ghost.\u201d</p><br/><p>There was a young girl with a timid expression dressed in white robes standing next to the old woman.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is a Ghost?\u201d The little boy asked fearfully.</p><br/><p>\u201cA person to protect you.\u201d The old woman was expressionlessly.</p><br/><p>\u201cA person to protect me?\u201d The young boy didn\u2019t seem to understand. \u201cWhy does she have to protect me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause I will die,\u201d the old woman said coldly.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>\u201cGui Gui, this name is not pleasing to hear,\u201d the young boy muttered. His hands didn\u2019t slow at all.</p><br/><p>The young girl tilted her head. \u201cGui Gui feels it is very good!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow come you work so hard at such a boring thing like cultivating?\u201d The young boy was puzzled as he carefully treated the wounds on the young girl\u2019s feet.</p><br/><p>The young girl was teary due to the pain and her voice contained a sob. However, it was unusually determined. \u201cBecause only when I become strong will I be able to protect Young Master.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is very safe here. There is no need to protect me. I don\u2019t like to go outside.\u201d The little boy\u2019s head shook like a rattledrum.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happens if that day comes?\u201d The young girl tilted her head.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are thinking too much!\u201d The little boy pretended to be an adult and tapped the young girl\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh!\u201d The young girl covered her head.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is the old woman teaching you? Why are you wounded every time?\u201d the little boy said furiously, \u201cIs she beating you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t talk about Grandma like that!\u201d The young girl pushed out her cheeks in anger.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, alright, I won\u2019t say anything. She doesn\u2019t like me anyways.\u201d The little boy was slightly dispirited.</p><br/><p>\u201cGrandma is very concerned about you,\u201d the little girl hurriedly comforted.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I know, she doesn\u2019t like me,\u201d the little boy\u2019s voice was low, \u201cbecause she doesn\u2019t like my mother, I know.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are right.\u201d A cold voice came from behind him. The old woman was expressionless but hate flashed across her eyes.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>The tree branches whipped painfully against his face but the little boy gritted his teeth. A Gui had carried him and ran for many days, so many that he had lost count.</p><br/><p>A Gui\u2019s steps faltered.</p><br/><p>Bam.</p><br/><p>He fell off her back, hitting the ground he became dizzy.</p><br/><p>A stream of blood spilled out the corner of A Gui\u2019s mouth. She crawled next to him and said with a sob, \u201cYoung Master, Young Master, are you hurt?\u201d</p><br/><p>He tried to make his smile easy. \u201cNo, I\u2019m fine!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung Master, I really am useless!\u201d A Gui bit her lips, tears in her eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Young Master who is useless.\u201d He reached out and rubbed A Gui\u2019s hair like usual. \u201cGui Gui, run.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo!\u201d A Gui shook her head stubbornly/</p><br/><p>He sighed. \u201cThey used a secret spell and left behind a mark in my consciousness. No matter how we run, we will not be able to escape.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo!\u201d A Gui stilled and then screamed heartbreakingly, her tears spilling out.</p><br/><p>He smiled and rubbed A Gui\u2019s head. \u201cRun, Gui Gui, and live for me as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>A Gui reached out her dirty hand and wiped away her tears. She suddenly picked him up and put him on his back and started to run frantically without a word.</p><br/><p>\u201cGui Gui, it is useless. Put me down.\u201d He urged many times on the road.</p><br/><p>After running for an unknown number of days, the last bit of A Gui\u2019s energy ran out. The two of them fell to the ground. A Gui\u2019s face was ashen. Her power had been used up.</p><br/><p>She struggled and crawled next to him. A Gui\u2019s face was as white as paper. She touched his face and murmured, \u201cYoung Master, will you forget A Gui?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course not.\u201d He smiled weakly. He was also at the end of his energy.</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung Master, you definitely cannot forget A Gui!\u201d A Gui\u2019s face was suddenly covered in tears.</p><br/><p>The hot tears fell on his face. His consciousness started to fade as he murmured.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, even in death, I won\u2019t forget \u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Translator Ramblings: We finally get here!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

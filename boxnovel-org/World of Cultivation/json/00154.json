Otherwise Zuo Mo would be frozen into a popsicle by the Stalagmite fire. This first problem was enough to trip Zuo Mo up. The only scripture that he had related to strengthening the body was [Vajra Profound Sutra]. The effects of the [Vajra Profound Sutra] didn\u2019t look very bad right now, and Zuo Mo tried to find a section on it relating to strengthening channels.</p><br/><p>He was quickly disappointed.</p><br/><p>There wasn\u2019t too much in [Vajra Profound Sutra] on strengthening channels. Zuo Mo, unsatisfied, ran to the records room, searching everywhere for scriptures that could strengthen his channels. He quickly found related content from some of the body cultivation jade schools. However, he was even further disappointed. Each of the jade scrolls clearly wrote that strengthening channels was a very profound field.</p><br/><p>Body cultivation first trained the flesh, then the tendons, and then the bones before the channels.</p><br/><p>With his weak zhuji cultivation, he couldn\u2019t even start to think about it.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo was not discouraged. This was not the first time he had encountered an obstacle like this. The jade scrolls that he had struggled so much to obtain were unclear in many places. That required him to think about it himself. If one path did not work, he would change to another. He could always find a workable solution.</p><br/><p>Since it was not possible to strengthen his channels, that meant that he could not carry out his idea of purifying ling energy in his channels.</p><br/><p>What about on the outside? If he could purify the ling energy outside the channels, then the ling energy he would absorb into his body would become pure ling power. Zuo Mo sank into deep thought. How could he purify ling energy outside the body to turn it into ling power? Inside the body, ling energy was invisible and non-tangible. How could he purify it?</p><br/><p>Each question seemed to be beyond his limits, but he did not plan on giving up.</p><br/><p>\u2014</p><br/><p>\u201c For this sword test conference, who are we sending?\u201d Yan Le looked at Sect Leader Pei Yuan Ran. There was only the two of them in Wu Kong Hall. Xin Yan was in seclusion forging. Shi Feng Rong was in seclusion making dan.</p><br/><p>\u201cNaturally, Wei Sheng will have to go. I just don\u2019t know if he\u2019ll come out in time,\u201d Sect Leader said,\u201cZuo Mo can also go.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha, the little guy ran to make a fuss at Ling Ying Sect. I heard he was extremely impressive,\u201d Yan Le smiled. The Ling Ying Sect, just by relying on their wealth had always been extremely arrogant towards the other sects of Dong Fu. There were many that thought them an eyesore.</p><br/><p>\u201cEn, Zuo Mo\u2019s talent is not bad. It\u2019s a pity he cannot focus on the sword,\u201d Sect Leader said with regret,\u201cIt could be considered an honorable defeat, that he lost on Chang Heng\u2019s hands.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Le shrugged carelessly, \u201cIt\u2019s good even if he does not focus on the sword. In the future, the sect needs people like Zuo Mo.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sect Leader nodded and did not say anything. He turned to say, \u201cYou can go take a look at Luo Li. The incident last time really shocked him. He should have improved.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust these three?\u201d Yan Le asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cEn, just these three,\u201d The sect leader added, \u201cthere\u2019s no rush. There\u2019s still time until the preliminary sword test conference.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Le excitedly clenched his hands, \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to it. If Wei Sheng gets out in time, he will definitely shock everyone.\u201d</p><br/><p>The sect leader gave a light smile. Even though he did not say anything, but the flash of light in his eyes revealed his thoughts.</p><br/><p>\u2014</p><br/><p>The great harvest of Fiery Red flower once again bloated Zuo Mo\u2019s purse. The price of Fiery Red flower had risen again during this time, to now two and a half third-grade jingshi per tael. The eighty mu of ling garden had, in total, produced twenty two catties of first grade Fiery Red flower. Other than that, there was almost one catty of second-grade Fiery Red flower. The price of second-grade Fiery Red flower had grown to sixty pieces of third-grade jingshi per tael. Taking off the previous payment of sixty pieces of third-grade jingshi, in total, Zuo Mo\u2019s income was one thousand and ninety pieces of third-grade jingshi.</p><br/><p>This was his biggest payout of jingshi yet.</p><br/><p>To stop Pu Yao from secretly taking it like usual, Zuo Mo decided to attack first. Based on income, Zuo Mo definitely was in the high ranks of Dong Fu, but all of his jingshi was stolen by Pu Yao before they even got warm in his purse.</p><br/><p>Pu Yao saw Zuo Mo\u2019s nervousness, and mocked, \u201cJust one thousand pieces of third-grade jingshi, it\u2019s just two pieces of fourth-grade jingshi, do you have to be like this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo was completely unaffected. \u201cI\u2019ll exchange it for something.\u201d He then added: \u201cThat I can use.\u201d</p><br/><p>Pu Yao said slowly, \u201cHaven\u2019t you been looking for a way to purify ling energy recently?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo\u2019s mind became alert. \u201cYes! Do you know how?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with your idea.\u201d Pu Yao snickered, \u201cBut you know too little. Even if you have a good idea, you cannot solve it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll exchange for this!\u201d Zuo Mo unhesitatingly said.</p><br/><p>\u201cHee hee.\u201d Pu Yao lightly swept his sleeve. A stream of clinks of jingshi hitting each other sounded, but Zuo Mo did not feel pain this time. He only stared at Pu Yao, waiting for him to keep talking.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I will teach you. In reality, this is a very simple method.\u201d Pu Yao\u2019s face resumed its habitual indifference. \u201cTsk tsk. Even though your idea is only superficial, but to think of it with your skill level isn\u2019t easy.\u201d Pu Yao\u2019s indifference gradually disappeared without him noticing, his voice becoming serious.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiuzhe, yao, mo, the three of them, the one that has the hardest time to create ling power is xiuzhe,\u201d Seeing Zuo Mo\u2019s surprised eyes, Pu Yao laughed lightly, \u201cYou must find it weird, that the xiuzhe who focus on ling poweras their primary have the hardest time with ling power. No matter if it is yao or mo, they are born with the ability to communicate with nature. Like us yao, once we are born, we can manipulate ling energy of the world. Mo, their bodies can automatically absorb the ling energy of the world, and naturally get rid of impurities, that they use to temper their body. They do not need to do anything for their blood and flesh to be filled with ling energy. Based on natural talent, xiuzhe cannot be compared to us. However, they are very good at learning. You have practiced many scriptures now. Do you know what is the core of scriptures?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Zuo Mo, entranced, asked reflexively.</p><br/><p>\u201cFormations,\u201d Pu Yao\u2019s eyes became extremely deep, as though he was looking through the ages, \u201cEach scripture is a kind of formation. Scriptures, most of them are divided into parts. The first is absorption. If it cannot take in ling energy of the world, then the scripture is useless. Then it is forging. If it cannot purify the ling energy, then it is not useful, and would harm the user. After that, it is storage. If it cannot store the power, it\u2019s useless no matter how much is absorbed and purified.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo was dumbstruck. No one had broken down scriptures like this before. Pu Yao stated it so simply, without any part that was difficult to comprehend. Zuo Mo finely pondered it, and instantly understood. It really was so!</p><br/><p>\u201cGood scriptures, the efficiency of taking ling energy is higher, the purification is faster, and it can store more ling power. Hm, it\u2019s just this simple.\u201d Pu Yao sighed. \u201cYou must be wondering why us yaomo can naturally absorb ling energy? That is because us yaomo have natural formations in our body. This is a blessing from nature! It is a pity that our intelligence is not as great as xiuzhe, ignorant of the treasure in our possession. Millions of years, we only knew to act according to our instinct, never thinking of the mechanisms behind it. Only when xiuzhe started to rise did we start to study, but by that time, we were too far behind xiuzhe and could only develop in two other directions.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s off topic.\u201d Pu Yao suddenly gave a smile. \u201cLet us return to your question. Your problem is easy to solve for all time. How about it, do you want to try?\u201d</p><br/><p>Pu Yao was already extraordinarily beautiful. That smile, it seemed to light up the sea of consciousness. Even Zuo Mo was shocked. He was suspicious that, if Pu Yao appeared in Dong Fu, there wouldn\u2019t be a woman in Dong Fu that would be able to resist his spell. But, a male growing up to look like this, it really was a crime!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat method?\u201d Zuo Mo asked, slightly hesitant. You had to reverse Pu Yao\u2019s words. If he said something like it would be solved forever, then it most likely would be continuously troublesome in the future.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour luck isn\u2019t bad. You encountered me\u201d Pu Yao resumed his lazy expression, \u201cDidn\u2019t I already say to you just now, yaomo can naturally gather ling energy and purify it. Coincidentally, this kind of natural seal formation, I have a little knowledge.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSuch a thing as good as this, how could those experts give up on it?\u201d Zuo Mo didn\u2019t quite believe it. The yaomo that xiuzhe had captured could not be counted. If there really was some secret on the bodies of yaomo, it should have been discovered long ago.</p><br/><p>\u201cHa!\u201d Pu Yao smiled mockingly, \u201cThey\u2019ve been angling for this thing for a long time. Pity, nature blessed us Yao with this just so yaomo will not go extinct! How about it, want to try?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow high can it increase? Is there any side effects? Would it conflict with practicing scriptures?\u201d Zuo Mo asked a string of questions.</p><br/><p>\u201cHee hee, how much can it increase, this depends on your body. At least, it would be multiple times what it is now. Side effects? Of course there would some. In this world, is there anything that is only beneficial? Losses and gains, I shouldn\u2019t have to teach you such a simple tenet. As to cultivating scriptures, it wouldn\u2019t affect it, definitely wouldn\u2019t affect it.\u201d Pu Yao resolutely said.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo lowered his head, sinking into his thoughts. Pu Yao did not hurry him, idly sitting on the gravestone.</p><br/><p>For some reason, Zuo Mo had a feeling that the following decision would change and influence his entire life. He did not know why he would have such a feeling. He had learned many things from Pu Yao, but never had a feeling like this before. This feeling was so strong, so clear.</p><br/><p>He was hesitant.</p><br/><p>He had been very happy these recent days. Even though he was still worried about jingshi, but everything was developing so well. He had improved step by step. Each day was very full. If he kept going like this, he definitely wouldn\u2019t have to worry about jingshi in the future, and could live a very good life. In the sect, he would also have a pretty good position.</p><br/><p>He could study ling plants, could study dan-making, could study\u2026 \u2026</p><br/><p>But that repeated dream, like fate, it always seemed to accidentally guide him towards another direction. Changing features and erasing the mind, his body was still carrying a past of unknown hardship and cruelty\u2026 \u2026</p><br/><p>Head down, Zuo Mo\u2019s hands fisted unconsciously, his entire body minutely trembling.</p><br/><p>What was it that he wanted?</p><br/><p>What was it that he could not avoid?</p><br/><p>Translator Ramblings: Zuo Mo goes back to farming and gets some money. Then Pu Yao finally introduces the world to Zuo Mo. A lot of weird information to build up the world and will become important later. Pu is a very good teacher and his attitude about all three races is really evident here.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo thinks of weird things to do like purifying ling energy outside the body because he doesn\u2019t know anything about the world. It\u2019s like how he thought he could make yin fire beads but didn\u2019t know that his cultivation was not enough. He breaks convention because he is not aware where convention is. Of course, that also trips him up when he is not aware some people have already invented certain things.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

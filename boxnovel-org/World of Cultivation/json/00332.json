The house guards that came with her were also shocked.</p><br/><p>\u201cClear Sky Sect isn\u2019t really a good thing. Look at Little Mountain, what have they done to it?\u201d someone muttered.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, they will be punished by the heavens!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs the Marquis going to move against Clear Sky Sect?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t guess randomly .. \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Listening to the mutterings of her subordinates, Rong Wei did not speak. Her mind was slightly unfocused. After a moment, she refocused. She hadn\u2019t seen Clear Sky Old Forefather. The Marquis\u2019 token had been presented, and they were let into Little Mountain Jie.</p><br/><p>She could clearly feel the nervous mood of Clear Sky Sect. She heard that someone had encountered something.</p><br/><p>Had something happened again in Little Mountain Jie?</p><br/><p>The incident of Stars in Daytime in Sky Moon Jie had disturbed many people at the time. She knew that the Marquis had paid special attention to the matter. Even though she had been brought up by the Marquis from childhood, she rarely saw the Marquis so concerned over a matter.</p><br/><p>The origins of the Marquis were deep and mysterious. She had never seen him attend to the major matters that occurred in Sky Moon Jie, but for the first time, she had seen a grave expression on Marquis\u2019 face concerning the Stars in Daytime.</p><br/><p>This was the second time, and was also due to the Stars in Daytime.</p><br/><p>There were many jade scrolls and old records in the Marquis\u2019 compound. Growing up from childhood in the compound, Rong Wei\u2019s knowledge was much wider than the great majority of xiuzhe. She knew a bit about what Stars in Daytime meant.</p><br/><p>She felt slightly puzzled. The impression that Marquis usually gave her was that of an idle person. She couldn\u2019t help but feel nervous that he was so concerned about such a matter.</p><br/><p>She focused, and slowly said, \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><br/><p>The compound guards instantly closed their mouths. Miss Rong was not of Marquis\u2019s legitimate line, but in terms of favor, she was first in the compound. Also, Miss Rong had not failed the Marquis\u2019 teachings, and was outstanding in all areas since childhood. It was just that she rarely left the compound, so her reputation was not known. The compound guards, regardless of their experience, were all respectful when they saw her, and didn\u2019t dare to do any posturing.</p><br/><p>Rong Wei\u2019s head started to hurt. Where should she start investigating the Stars in Daytime?</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>Jiang Hao looked at the most wanted list and drooled, \u201cBig Brother, we are going to get rich now!\u201d The other people also showed undisguised greed.</p><br/><p>Jiang Wei was also swallowing hard, but he was calmer than his younger brother. Whenever he thought of that strange and terrifying female xiu, he would sink into deep terror.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t forget about that female xiu.\u201d His voice was hoarse.</p><br/><p>The surroundings became deathly silent. Terror was imprinted on everyone\u2019s eyes. After seeing that silent massacre, three among them had their cultivation collapse due to long-term terror. The wails before their death still seemed to echo in their ears.</p><br/><p>The flames of greed in everyone\u2019s eyes were doused by a bucket of cold water.</p><br/><p>Jiang Hao shook. He force a smile and said, \u201cThe one that will go find them is the Outer Hall. No matter how powerful the female xiu is, she is just one person \u2026 \u2026\u201d His voice became increasingly light, and his face increasingly pale.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo matter how many the benefits are, we will need to live to experience them.\u201d Jiang Wei\u2019s eyes were bloodshot, and he said gravely, \u201cSince the Outer Hall is searching for them, they will be able to find them. The collision between the two sides is beneficial to us. Maybe we can even leave this damned place.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother, you think too highly of them,\u201d Jiang Hao said with a forced smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that I think highly of them, but I hope they can do it,\u201d Jiang Wei sighed.</p><br/><p>The other people were silent.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>In Zuo Mo\u2019s vast tunnels, the surroundings were filled with formations. His heart was excited. Finished! He finally finished!</p><br/><p>To set up such a large formation just with his power, he had enough to be proud of!</p><br/><p>Thinking it over, working day and night, only he knew how difficult it had been. Starting from when he began building Golden Crow City, he had never truly thought he could finish it. The increasingly tense situation was like an invisible whip continuously urging him to be faster!</p><br/><p>When it truly was finished, Zuo Mo felt he was in a dream.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs this real?\u201d he suddenly turned and asked the female xiu.</p><br/><p>The female xiu didn\u2019t seem to hear and didn\u2019t respond.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo snickered and was not concerned. He muttered to himself. \u201cPlease don\u2019t let this be a dream!\u201d</p><br/><p>In this period of time, his consciousness had improved greatly, his skill with fire deepening with every day so that the later portion of his work had been completed quickly. With his previous skill level, it wouldn\u2019t have been possible to complete such a vast project without using the better half of a year.</p><br/><p>Pu Yao hadn\u2019t lied to him this time. He had improved greatly through the entire process of building the city, so much that even he was shocked. The Jade Metal Head had entered third maturation. What excited him the most was that his consciousness had grown more than three times. Right now, he felt as though he was a basin of water, with so much water that it was almost overflowing. His consciousness probably wasn\u2019t far from a breakthrough. He also had a feeling that if his breakthrough could succeed this time, the degree of improvement would be very large.</p><br/><p>Looking at the surroundings, Zuo Mo was suddenly filled with confidence!</p><br/><p>Even if what he was facing was a jindan!</p><br/><p>Right now, there was only one thing left to do.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo didn\u2019t tell anyone the work had been completed, but the first person who felt the effects was Bao Yi. The supply of Black Processing Meditation mats couldn\u2019t keep up with demand. Bao Yi felt proud, but also frantic.</p><br/><p>Yet suddenly the production of Black Processing Meditation mat increased dramatically. He perceptively realized what had happened.</p><br/><p>Only if Boss did not require any supplies on his side, then the people of the forging division would be able to put all their effort into making Black Processing Meditation mats. Of the two most famous products of Golden Crow city, one was Golden Crow Fire, the other was Black Processing Meditation mat. Other than the batch that Bao Yi deliberately held back, the remaining Golden Crow Fire had all been sold. Only Boss could make Golden Crow Fire. Now that no one could find Boss through the day, who had the time to hope he could produce Golden Crow Fire?</p><br/><p>Golden Crow City only sold one product now, Black Processing Meditation mats.</p><br/><p>The wondrous ability of the Black Processing Meditation mat spread throughout Little Mountain Jie like it had wings. Countless xiuzhe flooded from all areas towards Golden Crow City.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>In a dusky mine shaft, Lil\u2019 Pagoda floated in the air like a dutiful supervisor as it directed those puppets to continuously work. The abnormal change had frightened the timid Lil\u2019 Pagoda half to death. Even though Zuo Mo had not scolded it, it still expressed an attitude of fulfilling its duties well.</p><br/><p>This caused the production of jingshi and ore recently to grow dramatically. The cheer on Bao Yi\u2019s face had grown even more.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, a copper puppet stopped what it was going, looking dazedly at the strange item in front of it.</p><br/><p>Lil\u2019 Pagoda instantly detected the abnormality, and hurriedly flew over.</p><br/><p>It was a bright red rock that exuded a strange presence. Lil\u2019 Pagoda tilted its head and looked with puzzlement at this piece of red rock.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo instantly received the information Lil\u2019 Pagoda passed over and rushed over, since Lil\u2019 Pagoda was connected to Zuo Mo.</p><br/><p>\u201cHm, this rock is strange.\u201d Zuo Mo went over and tapped it.</p><br/><p>The red rock was the size of a table and appeared like a piece of red jade, spreading threads of warmth. However, what was most unique was that it contained strong vitality. If one came close, they could make out the sound of a heartbeat.</p><br/><p>Was this something alive? Zuo Mo felt it was so fantastical. After circling the rock and thinking hard, he couldn\u2019t think of what this red rock really was.</p><br/><p>\u201cPu Yao, what is this?\u201d Zuo Mo ran over to ask Pu Yao.</p><br/><p>Pu Yao sat in front of the gravestone and resting, acting as if he was ignoring Zuo Mo.</p><br/><p>Seeing Pu Yao\u2019s state. Zuo Mo understood that this guy was in a mood. However, he had long forgotten what he had done.</p><br/><p>A real man could bow and scrape, ge will endure.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo piled on the smiles, \u201cPu Yao, you are a honored Sky Yao, what are you doing holding a grudge against a little character like me? Ge \u2026 \u2026 oh no, if this little brother has done something wrong, please have tolerance.\u201d</p><br/><p>Pu Yao\u2019s eyes were still closed, and there was no movement, but Zuo Mo noticed that Pu Yao\u2019s spine had straightened slightly.</p><br/><p>It worked!</p><br/><p>\u201cPu Yao, you are a millennia old Sky yao! The breadth of your mind, the composure, it is as wide as the sky, as deep as the ocean, your knowledge, your \u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay okay! Stop with the flattery!\u201d Pu Yao\u2019s expression was impatient, but the smile at the corner of his mouth revealed his pleased mood.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo mocked him inside. As expected of a thousand year antique. He bent under just this little bit of flattery. He piled on a fawning smile, \u201cSome guidance?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHm.\u201d Pu Yao gave a light cough before slowly drawling, \u201cIt\u2019s not embarrassing that you haven\u2019t seen this before. There aren\u2019t many xiuzhe that have seen it. This is Fire Sickle Rock. After absorbing the essence of moon and sun for a long time, it has born an intelligence. If nothing had changed in Little Mountain Jie, this piece of Fire Sickle Rock would just be an earthly treasure about fifth-grade.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen now?\u201d Zuo Mo perceptively asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cPresently, the ling energy of Little Mountain Jie has withered, and the power of the chaos has risen. But since this piece of Fire Sickle Rock has an intelligence, it couldn\u2019t absorb ling power so it absorbed the power of chaos instead.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo didn\u2019t understand. \u201cPower of chaos?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cChaos is the originator of all power. No matter if it is xiuzhe, yao or mo, power comes from chaos. But because everyone walks a different path, the result is completely different. What yaomo do is to go with the flow, while xiuzhe chose to resist. The ling power of the xiuzhe is a natural enemy to the power of chaos. \u201c</p><br/><p>\u201cYou mean he became a yaomo?\u201d Zuo Mo pointed at the rock and asked with shock.</p><br/><p>\u201cBecome yao.\u201d Pu Yao was clearly smug. \u201cThere is a fire yao being nurtured here, but before it comes out, I don\u2019t know what kind of fire yao. The intelligent souls of flora will become yao, the intelligent souls of wild beasts will become mo. If you throw ling beasts into a place like Bloody Sky Metropolis Jie, and after corrosion by the power of chaos, it will become mo.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo was slightly disappointed. \u201cSo it\u2019s just a yao, then shouldn\u2019t I kill the yaomo?\u201d</p><br/><p>Pu Yao\u2019s face instantly became black, \u201cWho are you killing?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo shook. He remembered the guy in front of him was a Sky Yao. He smiled, \u201cJoke, joke!\u201d He then said, \u201cI\u2019m just too disappointed. I thought I dug up a treasure, and didn\u2019t expect it was something useless.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho says it is useless?\u201d Pu Yao was clearly slightly excited. \u201cYou just don\u2019t know it! Treasure, hmph, even if it was put in front of you, you won\u2019t recognize it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what is the use?\u201d Zuo Mo hurriedly asked.</p><br/><p>Pu Yao closed his mouth and made a proud posture.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo wasn\u2019t tricked. He took out a flying sword from the ring, and moved it to the Fire Sickle Rock. \u201cIf I can\u2019t use it, I can\u2019t let other people have it. So let\u2019s kill it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing the situation, Pu Yao said, \u201cFire yao isn\u2019t too different than your ling beasts. You can use some of its abilities.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, so that\u2019s it, but I don\u2019t know how.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust drip blood.\u201d Once Pu Yao finished, he knew he was tricked.</p><br/><p>As expected, Zuo Mo cheerfully turned the flying sword and swiped across his finger. He squeezed out a drop of blood onto the Fire Sickle Rock.</p><br/><p>Translator Ramblings: Zuo Mo has learned. Threats and flattery used together. Pu Yao lost this round.</p><br/><p>WanderingGummmiOfDoom pointed out that what the yao did in corrupting the ling veins creates more yao. It\u2019s not a bad strategy if you think about it. It\u2019s essentially colonizing the place but I\u2019m not sure that there are that many potential fifth-grade materials lying about.</p><br/><p>Poor Jiang Wei, he has to root for the person who defeated him. I think Fang Xiang is using him as the voice of the other xiuzhe. If Jiang Wei who fought Zuo Mo before is (reluctantly) rooting for Zuo Mo, there is definitely other people out there doing the same.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

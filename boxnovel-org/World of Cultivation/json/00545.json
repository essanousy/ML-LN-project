The Four Realms that had been in a state of chaos was lifted by the news. This was the first mo jie that Four Realm Heaven had taken and the news was unexpected. Originally, people had thought the first one would be conquered by Kun Lun or Tian Huan. No one had expected that it would be Xuan Kong Temple.</p><br/><p>Xuan Kong Temple was unexpectedly attention-catching in contrast to its usual low-key conduct.</p><br/><p>Jiang Zhe who had obtained this victory became one of the most popular battle generals in the Four Realms with this victory!</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>Dong Zi\u2019s entire body was immersed in the black liquid of the medicinal pool. The medicinal fluid gave off a strange fragrance. Ka Zhuo was putting the materials that had been prepared into the medicinal pool one by one.</p><br/><p>Shattered Stone Town was remote and poor so there weren\u2019t a lot of good materials on hand. Many materials were not available in Shattered Stone Jie, Zuo Mo carefully picked carefully and found some common materials to substitute for the rarer ingredients. Ka Zhuo had then made a trip in order to go purchase these items.</p><br/><p>It had to be said that the medicinal fluid that Zuo Mo created was very effective. The medicinal power boiled and dark green mo matrixes appeared on Dong Zi\u2019s body, especially his arms that were almost entirely covered by the mo matrix. The mo matrix on his arms was the most detailed and clear, large amounts of hair-thin mo matrixes formed an eerie and complex diagram. Looking from a distance, it looked like tattoos.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlpine Gorilla matrix, this is the Alpine Gorilla matrix?\u201d Ka Zhuo looked with intoxication at the tattoos on Dong Zi\u2019s body. As a matrix awakening master, his obsession with mo matrixes was almost an instinct. Even though Zuo Mo had passed the Alpine Gorilla matrix to him, and he was completely familiar with it, but when he saw the real thing, he couldn\u2019t help but be enchanted.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo did not speak, as it would disturb Ka Zhuo. He actually admired Ka Zhuo\u2019s ability. In the past, Ka Zhuo\u2019s education did not include any profound content. The reason that he had the skills he did now was, in part, because of his enthusiasm for mo matrixes.</p><br/><p>Turning his gaze to Dong Zi in the medicinal pool, Zuo Mo\u2019s expression was relaxed.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe situation looks pretty good,\u201d Zuo Mo said in a small voice in his sea of consciousness.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is a pity that the materials are lacking,\u201d Wei said faintly. Pu Yao snorted coldly from the side.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo knew that Wei was being extremely conservative in his judgement. The materials were not just a bit lacking. These materials were basically the lowest level of materials, and even so, it had taken all the mo bei that Ka Zhuo had.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is no solution for this,\u201d Zuo Mo spread his hand and said helplessly.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo\u2019s daring idea had received Wei\u2019s support. Wei had also guided him in making this medicinal pool.Supposedly, it was a kind of ancient sacrificial ceremony.</p><br/><p>Pu Yao gave a cold snort from the side.</p><br/><p>\u201cBoy, you better spend some more effort on your body. Otherwise, even we will be affected,\u201d Pu Yao said coldly.</p><br/><p>Wei was silent. On this, he was on the same side as Pu Yao.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe situation is much better than before. I can even move my arm now,\u201d Zuo Mo purposefully showed off smugly.</p><br/><p>\u201cHa, dying from exploding is a very tragic death.\u201d Pu Yao\u2019s face was disdainful. \u201cIt is useless even if you can move your entire body. Your body right now is like a volcano, the inside which is becoming more and more restless. Either you cool it down, or vent it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo raised an eyebrow. \u201cWhat idea do you have?\u201d</p><br/><p>Pu Yao was silent for a moment before he said, \u201cIf you can vent all of the power outside your body, your life will not be in danger. I know a yao art that can do this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd then? Ge will become completely weak?\u201d Zuo Mo twisted his mouth. \u201cGe won\u2019t do that. Ge still has to heal A Gui, has to find ge\u2019s history, ge still has many things to do.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou do not have much time,\u201d Pu Yao\u2019s tone was emotionless. \u201cBased on the present state inside your body, you cannot support it for a long time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo\u2019s brow furrowed. \u201cHow much longer?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOne month.\u201d</p><br/><p>The sea of consciousness became deathly silent. None of the three were interested in chatting further.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo sat dazed in A Gui\u2019s embrace. He hadn\u2019t thought that the situation was this dire, it was worse than he had imagined.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, can we begin?\u201d Ka Zhuo\u2019s voice interrupted Zuo Mo\u2019s thinking.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo refocused and glanced at the medicinal pool. Seeing the water in the medicinal pool was now clear and he could see the bottom, he became alert. \u201cStart.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ka Zhuo took out the matrix awakening needle that he had made recently. His expression became serious and focused.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo\u2019s understanding of mo matrixes far surpassed Ka Zhuo, but in terms of actual practical skill, he could not compare to Ka Zhuo. It was the first time that Ka Zhuo was engraving the Alpine Gorilla matrix but his movements were not raw, flowing with an unique rhythm and extremely elegant.</p><br/><p>The process continued for a whole day.</p><br/><p>Dong Zi was covered in fine and complex mo matrixes that looked like eerie tattoos.</p><br/><p>Ka Zhuo disregarded his tiredness and a thread of nervousness appeared in his eyes. He closed his eyes and twenty breaths later, he opened them, his faint brown eyes were completely still.</p><br/><p>The matrix awakening needle on his hand suddenly gave off a serene black energy. The black energy shrouded the matrix awakening needle and made it appear as though Ka Zhuo was holding a black bolt of energy.</p><br/><p>The black energy suddenly entered between Dong Zi\u2019s brows.</p><br/><p>Pain came onto Dong Zi\u2019s face and his entire body convulsed violently.</p><br/><p>A deep wild roar came from Dong Zi\u2019s throat that was filled with pain.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo\u2019s heartbeat was raised as he watched Dong Zi roll on the ground. The mo matrix had been engraved and was activated, but the success would determine on whether or not Dong Zi\u2019s body could tolerate the complete Alpine Gorilla matrix.</p><br/><p>He had to make it \u2026 \u2026</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo was cheering for Dong Zi on the inside and extremely nervous.</p><br/><p>Threads of black energy seemed to appear out of thin air and enter Dong Zi\u2019s mo matrix. Dong Zi rolled even more violently and gave heart-wrenching howls.</p><br/><p>But no matter how he rolled, the mo matrix on his body was not affected as all. As it absorbed more and more black energy, the mo matrix gradually became bright.</p><br/><p>Dong Zi\u2019s breathing was weakening as his body convulsed.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo was staring unblinkingly at the mo matrix, extremely nervous and held his breath.</p><br/><p>The mo matrix that lit up gradually dimmed. After a while, it gradually lit up again and then dimmed \u2026 \u2026 pulsing as though it was breathing.</p><br/><p>After seven to eight rounds of pulsing, the mo matrix no longer become bright again and Dong Zi was motionless on the ground.</p><br/><p>The mo matrix dimmed and then gradually became faint, so faint that the naked eye was unable to see it. Dong Zi did not look any different than usual.</p><br/><p>Dong Zi\u2019s breathing sounded, long and serene as though he was sleeping.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo\u2019s heart came back to ground and hurriedly stopped Ka Zhuo that was going forward. \u201cLet him rest, do not disturb him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ka Zhuo stilled and then he stammered out a question, \u201cSuc\u2026 success?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes! Success!\u201d Zuo Mo\u2019s tone was filled with joy.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>After four hours, Dong Zi woke up. He looked around dazedly and then looked at his hands. He asked Zuo Mo in puzzlement, \u201cA Zuo, when are you going to work on me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing Dong Zi acting like this, Zuo Mo couldn\u2019t help but roar with laughter. \u201cHaha, it\u2019s already done!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDone?\u201d Dong Zi stilled. He then raised his hands and looked for a while before shaking his head and said, \u201cA Zuo, don\u2019t try to fool me, it is the exact same as before!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo did not explain and said with a smile, \u201cCome, let\u2019s go out. Uncle An Ya and the others are definitely waiting impatiently.\u201d</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t just Uncle An Ya and Dong Zi\u2019s parents that were waiting impatiently. All the residents of the town were filled with curiosity. There hadn\u2019t ever been a matrix awakening that had taken such a long time. Dong Zi was the most talented youth in the town, kind and honest, and everyone liked him. They were also full of anticipation about his future.</p><br/><p>Seeing Dong Zi walk out, Shattered Stone Town shook.</p><br/><p>Everyone came out and surrounded him.</p><br/><p>\u201cDong Zi, show us!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDong Zi, show Auntie how powerful you are now!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBig Brother Dong Zi \u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Dong Zi had never seen anyone shout and talk to him together like this. He instantly didn\u2019t know what to do. Thankfully, the ones that came were people he were familiar with so he was not afraid. Dong Zi was quickly pushed by the flow of people to the training grounds. Uncle An Ya was teaching the other youths in cultivation at this time.</p><br/><p>When Uncle Anya saw Dong Zi, he was first overjoyed, but after examining Dong Zi, he couldn\u2019t help but have a puzzled expression. Dong Zi looked the same as before. Dong Zi\u2019s parents were very excited.</p><br/><p>\u201cDong Zi, it\u2019s done?\u201d Uncle An Ya\u2019s question was very general. The matter about the repaired mo matrix was shocking, and so it was kept a secret with only Uncle An Ya and Dong Zi\u2019s parents knowing the truth of the matter.</p><br/><p>Uncle An Ya was highly respected in Shattered Stone Town. When he spoke, the noisy crowd instantly quieted.</p><br/><p>Dong Zi scratched his head blankly. \u201cA Zuo said it is done.\u201d</p><br/><p>Uncle An Ya\u2019s expression did not change as he moved to make space. \u201cEn, come, try, do you remember the [Shattered Stone Strike] that I taught you?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Shattered Stone Strike] was Uncle An Ya\u2019s ultimate move and this set of strikes was famous in the area. Uncle An Ya had created it based on the striking method he learned in the military and it was very strong.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Dong Zi responded dazedly. In reality, he still didn\u2019t understand what was going on.</p><br/><p>However, Uncle An Ya had taught him everything he knew. He would obey what Uncle An Ya said without any hesitation.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo was in A Gui\u2019s arms and filled with anticipation while Ka Zhuo\u2019s face was red from excitement.</p><br/><p>Dong Zi\u2019s legs were set apart, his arms slightly lowered with his right hand held straight like a blade.</p><br/><p>At this time, the blankness on Dong ZI\u2019s face had disappeared. His expression was stern, his eyes sharp, his entire person like an unsheathed blade!</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo thought, Dong Zi was innocent in personality, and did not have stray thoughts. Just a position and it could be seen he had truly learned from Uncle An Ya.</p><br/><p>\u201cStrike!\u201d</p><br/><p>A shout, and then his slightly lowered arm moved, his hand like a blade as he chopped forward!</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo\u2019s eyes were sharp and saw it clearly.</p><br/><p>Dong Zi\u2019s palm was shaking at a very high frequency! With every shake, there would be a thread of red energy produced from Dong Zi\u2019s palm and the red energies would layer together.</p><br/><p>When the vibrations reached hundreds of times, the red energy was almost tangible and covered the line of his palm!</p><br/><p>Hiss!</p><br/><p>The red blade energy left his hand!</p><br/><p>Boom!</p><br/><p>A ruler-straight gulley stretched forward from Dong Zi\u2019s feet, almost twenty zhang before it ended!</p><br/><p>The surroundings were completely silent.</p><br/><p>Translator Ramblings; Really big advancement here. While Zuo Mo carved formations into people in the past, that was just putting on tattoos. They got an extra bit of ability but what is going on here is different. First, Zuo Mo is modifying what is already within Dong Zi. The consequences for the formations failing is just getting an ugly tattoo but if the matrix awakening fails, then it is loss of power and death. It\u2019s the difference between putting higher-grade gasoline in a car and modifying its engine completely.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

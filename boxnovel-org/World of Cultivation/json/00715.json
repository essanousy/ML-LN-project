People would find it hard to deduce what kind of xiuzhe he was based on his attire. Ji Zheng was the exact opposite. Bald head, prayer beads, monk robes, he looked like a stereotypical dhynana xiu at first glance. The only thing that would cause people to take notice was that granite and icy face. It didn\u2019t have the harmonious air of dhyana xiu. Instead it was cold and murderous, inspiring fear in the onlooker.</p><br/><p>Dai Tao was not from Xuan Kong Temple. He was a roaming xiu. In order to break through to fanxu, he had joined Xuan Kong Temple. Xuan Kong Temple\u2019s enormous resources and the great and famed collection of records had been of great help to him. He had successfully entered fanxu, and became one of the elders of Xuan Kong Temple.</p><br/><p>Ji Zheng was a true disciple of Xuan Kong Temple. His parents had been disciples of Xuan Kong Temple. He had grown up from birth in the temple. Outstandingly talented, he had been one of the disciples that the sect had focused their resources in raising. He himself was a cultivation fanatic and didn\u2019t have any interest in other matters. His mind was pure, and his cultivation path could be said to have been a smooth one without facing any major obstacles.</p><br/><p>Ji Zheng suddenly turned his head and walked into a corner.</p><br/><p>When he stepped onto the grass, that emotionless face changed for the first time. His eyes lit up. \u201cShen power!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShen power?\u201d Dai Tao paused. When he walked to this place, his expression also changed to shock. \u201cSuch pure shen power! Does this boy have a complete shen power inheritance?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe chase him!\u201d Ji Zheng said decisively.</p><br/><p>Dai Tao hesitated. If they took the chance to kill Bie Han, it would be a destructive blow against the enemy. However, he quickly suppressed this thought. In comparison, Xiao Mo Ge\u2019s shen power inheritance was more attractive to him.</p><br/><p>Shen power inheritance!</p><br/><p>His mind heated slightly. If he was able to obtain the shen power inheritance, maybe he could enter dasheng level!</p><br/><p>Dasheng!</p><br/><p>The highest level of cultivation and representing the strongest power in the world.</p><br/><p>How many years had it been since a dasheng expert appeared!</p><br/><p>Dai Tao was actually satisfied with having reached fanxu. However, he understood that without Xuan Kong Temple, he would not have been able to do it. Consequently, he hadn\u2019t had any thoughts about the distant dasheng stage. But this shen power inheritance that suddenly appeared now gave him a thread of hope.</p><br/><p>Xuan Kong Temple had studied shen power for a long time. Dai Tao was one of the most powerful in the temple and had participated in the process. While Xuan Kong Temple had not produced any results up until now, shen power had been found to be a higher power than ling power.</p><br/><p>For normal xiuzhe, this was nothing. The cultivation of ling power itself was already an endeavor vast as the ocean and endless as the sky.</p><br/><p>But for xiuzhe like them that had almost reached the top level of the xiuzhe system, it was tempting!</p><br/><p>The two quickly disappeared.</p><br/><p>Multiple breaths later, a figure slowly formed from empty space near where the two had been. It was Luo Li.</p><br/><p>Two hours later.</p><br/><p>Xiao Mo Ge\u2019s battalions started to mobilize.</p><br/><p>Full speed ahead!</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>\u201cNow tell me why we are going in this direction!\u201d Zuo Mo glowered at Pu Yao and Wei. \u201cAh-huh, ge isn\u2019t so easy to fool! You two lowly cunning, shady, and shameless people. Do not think you can do such unspeakable things behind my back!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo\u2019s speech was both urgent and fast.</p><br/><p>However, the two in front of him clearly would not be defeated by words of this degree.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is a good thing.\u201d Wei smiled harmlessly.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is not so easy to avoid fanxu!\u201d</p><br/><p>Threat! Pu Yao was definitely threatening him!</p><br/><p>However, the thick-skinned and black-hearted Xiao Mo Ge was immune to threats like this. He sneered. \u201cEveryone\u2019s on the same both, what\u2019s the use in scaring me? You guys can escape if I don\u2019t?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis time, it really is a good thing.\u201d Wei still had a friendly smile.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo glanced at Pu Yao. He wondered inside, this guy hadn\u2019t argued with him today, it wasn\u2019t normal!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Zuo Mo responded.</p><br/><p>\u201cActually, in the past, we did leave behind some things.\u201d Wei hesitated but still spoke.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo stilled but then his eyes flashed like jingshi. \u201cWhoa whoa whoa! JIngshi? Oh, mobei? Or the legendary thousand year treasure hoard? You were so strong in the past, the riches you gathered \u2026 \u2026 oh oh oh ! Rich rich! Haha \u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>In the sea of consciousness, Zuo Mo danced excitedly.</p><br/><p>\u201cRiches \u2026 \u2026\u201d Wei\u2019s expression was dazed.</p><br/><p>\u201cI knew he would be like this,\u201d Pu Yao said expressionlessly.</p><br/><p>After being calm for a moment, Pu Yao\u2019s tendons visibly bulged up. His forced expression of calm became twisted. There seemed to be an angry fire burning in his bloody pupil that increased. His teeth ground like millstones. He was clearly angry to his limit.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t riches?\u201d Zuo Mo stopped. His face was full of disappointment as he muttered, \u201cNot riches, that really disappoints me! Ah, you two were famous people in the past, to be poor to this point, tsk tsk \u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShut up!\u201d Pu Yao\u2019s anger that he had been suppressing immediately erupted as he shouted, \u201cYou idiot! Dumbass! You stupid idiot that only knows to laze about, eating and waiting to die! Such humiliation! I actually have a student like you! This is such a great humiliation! What do you understand? Ah! The world! We were fighting for the world, dominating in all directions! Our desires, wishes, how can you who only knows money money money understand \u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The furious Pu Yao ignited the flames in Zuo Mo\u2019s sea of consciousness. The dark red fires filled the sky and Pu Yao was like a furious god.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo\u2019s face was puzzled. He looked at Pu Yao in the sky that was pointing down and swearing at him. He murmured unconsciously, \u201cWhat is this \u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The light words caused the flames to completely still and Pu Yao\u2019s shouts to be choked off.</p><br/><p>Pu Yao was like a deflated ball that flew down without a sound. The fires that burned disappeared.</p><br/><p>Pu Yao and Wei abandoned the puzzled Zuo Mo and went to whisper to each other.</p><br/><p>Wei said calmly, \u201cI just knew that this occasion would be the rest \u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Pu Yao\u2019s anger roiled. \u201cA waste of all this. To have encountered such a master without any ambition. They are really pitiful, the most pitiful in history \u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei hit the target with one sentence. \u201cAmbition? It isn\u2019t the first time that he was just eating and waiting for death.\u201d</p><br/><p>Pu Yao was discontent. \u201cAll the things that we had done, so much preparation to leave for \u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei said calmly, \u201cWe do not have any other choices.\u201d</p><br/><p>Pu Yao gritted. \u201cThe great \u2026 \u2026 I\u2019m going to die of anger! No! Hmph, how can he benefit without paying a price?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei looked at Pu Yao who was about to go off again and said calmly, \u201cHe probably doesn\u2019t want this benefit.\u201d</p><br/><p>Pu Yao seemed to think of something and snickered. \u201cHa, that isn\u2019t up to him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei heard something. \u201cWhat do you plan on doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>Pu Yao didn\u2019t answer and asked in response, \u201cWhat kind of person do you think he is?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei did not hesitate. \u201cLazy, eats and waits for death, dislikes work, greedy, thick-skinned, and black-hearted.\u201d</p><br/><p>Pu Yao thought as he asked, \u201cWhen will he ever actually put effort into doing something?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei said directly, \u201cWhen there is no other choice and he has to do it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, in other words, if we want him to do something, this matter has to leave him no avenue of retreat, no choice left and he has to do it.\u201d Pu Yao concluded.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou mean \u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Pu Yao\u2019s bloody pupil flashed with an unusual light. \u201cHee hee\u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei nodded. \u201cUnderstood.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow about it?\u201d Pu Yao glanced at Wei.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo it.\u201d Wei was brisk.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you now unfamiliar with what has to be done?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have to familiarize myself.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt really makes one\u2019s blood boil!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEn.\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Zuo Mo had a bad feeling.</p><br/><p>Then he saw Pu Yao and Wei who had been whispering off to the side turn to look at him and grin darkly.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo shuddered.</p><br/><p>Were those two planning something else?</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo thought. The two had already turned around and did not seem to intent to pay any more attention to him. Zuo Mo suppressed the impulse to ask and left his sea of consciousness.</p><br/><p>He would not get any answers. It would be safer to stay away from these two.</p><br/><p>Of course, most importantly, it wasn\u2019t riches!</p><br/><p>After hearing that it wasn\u2019t riches, Zuo Mo immediately lost interest in what Pu Yao was talking out. He was very wealthy now: Anti Dragon Claw, Three Thousand Threads of Worry, these two were top treasures. He had also been enriched after killing Marshal Yu\u2019s group.</p><br/><p>The Black-Hearted Treasure Coins, the Blue Carp Sword, all of them were powerful mo weapons.</p><br/><p>There were numerous materials, dozens of mo skills that were all first-tier.</p><br/><p>So Zuo Mo didn\u2019t have any interest in the property that Pu Yao and Wei spoke of. Also, he knew that the things these two offered were not easy to take.</p><br/><p>Right now, he only wanted to go to Nether Springs Jie, investigate his origins, and settle his scores. After doing that, he would manage his own territories, make jingshi and live a carefree existence.</p><br/><p>Since he now had an enormous territory that was enough for people to have pretty good days, he had not failed them, Zuo Mo thought happily.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo quickly shrugged off the scenes of the beautiful future and recovered his calmness.</p><br/><p>The fight right now was directly related to their future. If they won, they would jump into the position as one of the strongest battalions in the world. No one would easily start a fight with them. They would have an open road and they would push Xuan Kong Temple down into a place where they would not be able to get back up from.</p><br/><p>But if they lost \u2026 ..</p><br/><p>No, they definitely could not lose!</p><br/><p>For Xuan Kong Temple, this was a battle they could not lose. For Zuo Mo\u2019s group, this was also a battle they could not lose!</p><br/><p>This was a battle that they could not retreat from nor avoid!</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo became alert and started to ponder if his plans had any weaknesses.</p><br/><p>At this time, Zuo Mo was focusing all his effort and gave off endless spirit!</p><br/><p>His belly full of black water was not willing to stay hidden.</p><br/><p>He had to make some trouble for Xuan Kong Temple!</p><br/><p>Translator Ramblings: Some humor to cut into all the tenseness.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

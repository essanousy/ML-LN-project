Many families are starting to pay attention to him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cContinue to monitor the situation.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShould we make contact? There are many people noticing him \u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo not worry too much. With his present fame, no major family would offer him a high price. As for those small families, even if they recruit him, it would not be hard for us to pull him over.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut \u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo one is stupid. The Shifting Star Sands are very powerful and show that he has potential. However, those that are worth us acting are geniuses that can grow and live to become experts.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Bu Heng is acting against him\u2026 should we make contact?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy should we? You have to understand those that cannot survive are of no value to us.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes \u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGo and help Bu Heng. However, do not leave any clues behind. It is the Shifting Star Sands, you have to give him some special treatment! I feel some anticipation!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, this subordinate understands.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGo.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>The Shifting Star Sands worldly manifestation only remained in the minds of the people of Great Peace City for a few days before it was quickly replaced by major news of the Four Realms victories on all fronts.</p><br/><p>The power of the Four Great Sects caused both the yao and the mo to become nervous, especially the mo.</p><br/><p>The in the battles of Blood Sky Metropolis Jie the yao had suffered heavy casualties but the mo had been largely unharmed and not really felt any pain. However, of the four jie which had been conquered, three belonged to the mo.</p><br/><p>A strong feeling of danger seemed to press down on them.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, the three jie that were taken were all very far from Great Peace City. But terror and nervousness still uncontrollably spread.</p><br/><p>Something like this was not something that could be reversed by one expert unless a king personally acted. But while the mo would have King level experts, the xiuzhe also had people in the dacheng realm.</p><br/><p>The fighting between experts of this level were on a strategic level. Unless it was a crucial time, neither side would act as the risks were too high.</p><br/><p>As long as there were enough people and resources, a battalion could be reconstructed again in a few years and were naturally restored. But experts of such a high level, if one died, there would not be one to replace them. Not just king, even a mo marshal was very difficult to nurture. This could be seen from how many general levels were stuck at the very edge of marshall level in Great Peace City.</p><br/><p>A string of defeats suddenly caused all of Great Peace City to become more solemn.</p><br/><p>Everyone lost interest in chatting and were all worried.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Miao, what do you think?\u201d An extremely elegant mo looked with worry at Miao Jun.</p><br/><p>Miao Jun did not have a large figure. He had a square face with sharply defined features that slightly showed his age. His eyes were a crisp green, his figure stocky and he sat there casually but with presence.</p><br/><p>Miao Jun thought and then said gravely. \u201cThis is not a strange development.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot strange?\u201d his friend\u2019s interest was stirred by this and he hurriedly asked, \u201cHow is this not strange?\u201d</p><br/><p>Miao Jun said in a low voice, \u201cNo matter if people verbally agree or not, the xiuzhe are stronger than the yaomo, this is the truth. This is caused by the results of the thousand year war, and no one can change this. In the past, we had the Blood Sky Metropolis Jie as a barrier but now without it to serve as a border we are all mixed together. We lost the buffer between us and now have to face them and fight. At this time, what matters is strength. So it is not strange that we have lost.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo according to Brother Miao, doesn\u2019t this mean that we will definitely lose in the end?\u201d another person asked in disagreement.</p><br/><p>\u201cLosing in the beginning is already set in stone, but it is hard to say what is going to happen later on.\u201d Miao Jun\u2019s tone was calm and his thoughts clear. \u201cThe xiuzhe have started to gain victories so they will keep on advancing, and we will keep retreating. Many things will change in this cycle of advances and retreats. The other will be fighting on foreign land, and once the battle lines are drawn out, they will be tired out in maintaining it. We look to be retreating but we have an advantage in fighting on home territory. Also, with the calamity and battles many clans will be destroyed, and we will not have any more places to retreat to. When we are fighting with our backs to the precipice, we will be determined!\u201d</p><br/><p>The speech was rational and clear. All of them sighed in agreement.</p><br/><p>At this time, Miao Jun\u2019s gaze suddenly focused and he shouted in a deep voice, \u201cWhich friend has come here, why do you not come forward?\u201d</p><br/><p>Clap clap clap!</p><br/><p>As Zuo Mo walked in, he clapped. He was not pretending, he truly felt that the other had spoken well. The complex state of matters was simplified by the other into clear and concise points. Just this foresight alone was unusual.</p><br/><p>Little Mo Ge was someone that had seen great things!</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Mo Ge!\u201d Miao Jun\u2019s expression was surprised. He was not the only one. The expressions of the people around him instantly became strange.</p><br/><p>Everyone recognized the youth in front of them.</p><br/><p>Was this that Xiao Mo Ge that just a while ago had caused the Shifting Star Sands?</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo was examining Miao Jun, Miao Jun was also examining Xiao Mo Ge.</p><br/><p>Miao Jun had been astounded by the Shifting Star Sands that night, but what he felt more of was admiration. In terms of talent, he and the other people of the Great Peace Mo Rankings did not lack for it. Otherwise, they would not have gotten on the Great Peace Mo Ranking. However, compared to a freak that could have Shifting Star Sand, their presence instantly became dim in the light of that person.</p><br/><p>Miao Jun sometimes would think if he could have the Shifting Star Sand once, even if he could not enter marshal level, he would not have a problem comprehending [Boundary].</p><br/><p>But no matter how jealous he was, after being shocked for two days, the matter had settled. So when Miao Jun saw Zuo Mo, he was just slightly surprised.</p><br/><p>\u201cI had originally come to challenge Brother Miao.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Zuo Mo spoke, the room instantly became silent. Everyone was shocked by his words.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut when I heard Brother Miao\u2019s speech just now, this one is in great admiration of Brother Miao\u2019s foresight and suddenly changed ideas.\u201d Zuo Mo spoke smoothly as though he thought himself a very strong person and did not show any timidity.</p><br/><p>Miao Jun suddenly felt it was very humorous and asked interestedly, \u201cOh, how did you change your opinion?\u201d</p><br/><p>When he was young, wasn\u2019t he also as green as this?</p><br/><p>The other people could not suppress their amused expressions, especially when they saw Zuo Mo\u2019s serious expression. Some even laughed. In their eyes, Zuo Mo was a complete greenhorn while Miao Jun was someone who had been famed for a long time.</p><br/><p>Right now, the greenhorn was swaying his head and lecturing in front of someone famous, wasn\u2019t this funny?</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo did not seem to feel the others laughing at him. He said with a serious expression, \u201cI believe that Brother Miao is an exceptional battle general.\u201d</p><br/><p>Miao Jun was slightly surprised. He would occasionally speak about matters of the world but no one had ever connected him to being a battle general.</p><br/><p>It seemed that this youth had very sensitive perception!</p><br/><p>Miao Jun\u2019s heart shook slightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo I hope that Brother Miao can come help me!\u201d Zuo Mo said with a serious expression.</p><br/><p>Everyone\u2019s smiles seemed to freeze on their faces. Their eyes were wide as they looked at Zuo Mo, their expressions strange.</p><br/><p>A moment later.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha!\u201d</p><br/><p>One person finally could not stop himself and slammed the floor in laughter as though he heard the funniest joke in the world. The laughter seemed to be infectious and quickly spread. All the people in the room roared with laughter.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha! He wants to recruit Brother Miao! He actually wants to recruit Brother Miao \u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHahahaha! Did I hear it right? What day is it today?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to die from laughing!\u201d</p><br/><p>A little child actually ran over and serious wanted to recruit Miao Jun. This was the funniest matter in the history of Great Peace City.</p><br/><p>Even Miao Jun couldn\u2019t help but laugh. \u201cI\u2019m very sorry, my present life is already very good.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo suddenly said, \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t even consider it for [Celestial Azure Essence]?\u201d</p><br/><p>Miao Jun\u2019s smile suddenly froze and he abruptly stood up. \u201cYou have [Celestial Azure Essence]?\u201d</p><br/><p>He unconsciously stepped forward and grabbed at Zuo Mo.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo did not dodge. A light flashed in his eyes and his presence was suddenly released!</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>Luo Li shut himself off in the room.</p><br/><p>His complexion had recovered from its previous pale tone. The content of [Life-Death Lock] flashed through his mind. He had spent the last days studying this art that was completely irrational without any rest.</p><br/><p>For him, death was not a difficult matter.</p><br/><p>Sometimes, it would take more bravery to live than to die.</p><br/><p>This bravery might just be a reason or a thread of hope.</p><br/><p>Luo Li did not have anything to hesitate about.</p><br/><p>His heart that had returned to life was grasping at a hope so small it was almost nonexistent.</p><br/><p>Entering the state of death could stimulate the greatest potential of a person. Then it could reconstruct Wo Li, right?</p><br/><p>Even if this only allowed him to just see her one last time \u2026 \u2026</p><br/><p>Luo Li slowly closed his eyes. He let the darkness take over his world but his lips were curled in a smile.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo\u2019s explosive presence was like a tsunami that lost its restraints and flowed in all directions.</p><br/><p>Miao Jun\u2019s eyes suddenly lit up. They were like suns and unable to be stared at directly.</p><br/><p>The other people changed expression. All laughter was choked off. They panicked fled outside. This presence made them feel suffocated!</p><br/><p>The presence that Xiao Mo Ge gave off was not weaker than Miao Jun at all!</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you going to come?\u201d Zuo Mo\u2019s voice was deep.</p><br/><p>Miao Jun smiled coldly. \u201cDepends on whether you have the skill!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDefeating you?\u201d Zuo Mo did not dodge Miao Jun\u2019s blinding gaze and continued to ask.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have [Celestial Azure Essence]?\u201d Miao Jun asked in response.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d Zuo Mo was crisp.</p><br/><p>Miao Jun\u2019s expression changed. He clearly was conflicted inside.</p><br/><p>Wei, you are so evil \u2026 \u2026</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo thought inside but his expression was proper. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we have a bet?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBet?\u201d Miao Jun\u2019s eyes narrowed.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, let\u2019s have a fight. You lose, then you follow me, you win, the [Celestial Azure Essence] is yours,\u201d Zuo Mo threw out the bait.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow do I know that you have the [Celestial Azure Essence]?\u201d Miao Jun said, unconvinced.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can gamble whether or not I have it.\u201d Zuo Mo was not affected.</p><br/><p>Miao Jun\u2019s eyes narrowed even more, and the light grew brighter. He said coldly, \u201cIf you lose, I will not let you die so easily.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen I lose, you will have a lot of time to do as you wish.\u201d Zuo Mo said coldly. Inside, he looked with sympathy at Miao Jun.</p><br/><p>Wei, you are so devious \u2026 \u2026</p><br/><p>As expected, the more of a fortuneteller one was, the worse they were \u2026 \u2026</p><br/><p>Translator Ramblings: Zuo Mo needs to boost his value.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

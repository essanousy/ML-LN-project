Just first maturation.\u201d Pu Yao looked at the anticipation on Zuo Mo\u2019s face, and did not hesitate in his blows. \u201cBasically, advancement is only possible at third maturation. Little bro, it\u2019s early for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing this, Zuo Mo couldn\u2019t help but feel disappointed. \u201cWhy is advancement this difficult?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDifficult?\u201d Pu Yao smirked coldly. \u201cWhat difficulty is this? Good things are not so easy to get.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d Zuo Mo thought and found that it was right. He still remembered his time when he planted ling grains. Not talking about those good items, but even for those spells to reach a grade, at that time, he had to put in all of his energy to get.</p><br/><p>His days had only gotten better after he had met Pu Yao. Pu Yao would occasionally do something bad to him, but Zuo Mo never really took to heart. Without Pu Yao, he would still be an outer sect disciple of Wu Kong Sword Sect.</p><br/><p>His attitude towards Pu Yao and the mysterious gravestone were the same. He could accept everyone making some transactions. To receive good things, he had to pay a price. This was reasonable, a matter of consent. But if the other was going to force him, he won\u2019t take it.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are these blood beads?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNothing, just the beads made from your essential blood.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo instantly jumped in fright. \u201cMy essential blood? What time? How come ge didn\u2019t know?\u201d He looked at Pu Yao with slightly unfriendliness, his tone changing. Had this guy done something again?</p><br/><p>\u201cNone of ge\u2019s business!\u201d Pu Yao rolled his eyes and mimicked Zuo Mo\u2019s tone. \u201cYour woman did it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGe\u2019s woman?\u201d Zuo Mo stilled. \u201cWhen did ge have a woman?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe one wearing the mask.\u201d Pu Yao undoubtedly had extreme talent in being a ruffian. As he learned a little bit, the disrespectful attitude was born. He clearly was a high grade ruffian of high status and identity, with some dignity and laziness. In comparison, Zuo Mo with his twisted features, and wiry hair was like the ruffians that ran about the streets with bricks.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen did she do that?\u201d Zuo Mo furrowed his brow.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be unable to recognize people\u2019s aid.\u201d Pu Yao unconcernedly glanced and then yawned. He lazily said, \u201cReceived the benefit and still pretending to be good. Mo physiques will change during maturation. Oh, you were quite fierce, played with essence blood explosions. The other is very good, and help you condense them into blood beads so it wasn\u2019t a waste. However, she really is a powerful girl!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo\u2019s expression instantly became awkward. He had always been full of suspicion towards this woman of unknown origins.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the use of this?\u201d The practical Zuo Mo quickly pulled the topic onto the blood beads.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are many uses. If you cultivate mo skills with blood and fiends, it is a very rare treasure. Right now, I can\u2019t think of any,\u201d Pu Yao said irresponsibly.</p><br/><p>Coming out of the sea of consciousness, Zuo Mo coincidentally saw the female xiu. It might have been Pu Yao\u2019s words, but he suddenly found her much more pleasing to look at.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d He raised the blood beads, and thanked the female xiu.</p><br/><p>He knew the female xiu definitely wouldn\u2019t respond. After showing his appreciation, he turned and went back to the work of building the city.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo didn\u2019t know that just as he turned around, a purple light flashed across the eyes behind the mask.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>Gongsun Cha gazed at the changes on the battlefield. He was continuously trying out new tactics. Any battle tactic, from seeing it, to familiarity, to understanding, the entire process required spending a lot of effort and thought. Even more important was actual use and experimentation.</p><br/><p>In the war chess, Pu Yao had shown many kinds of battle tactics to Gongsun Cha. Each tactic had its own qualities, but not every tactic was like the three section wave killing charge, being able to be used after just trying it out. The tactics related to the mixture of people, and the structure of the troops.</p><br/><p>In the war chess, there was only yaomo. To say of nothing else, the combat methods of yaomo and xiuzhe were extremely different. Just adapting the tactics over to use was not going to work.</p><br/><p>However, after being continuously abused by all kinds of tactics, Gongsun Cha\u2019s knowledge was much broader. No one told him what should be. He could only experiment to increase how long he could stand up under Pu Yao\u2019s hands.</p><br/><p>Mimicking, concluding, and experimenting.</p><br/><p>If it was a normal person, after they had a sweet taste of the three section wave killing charge\u2019s sharp blade, they would naturally worship it as the truth, the strongest weapon. However, Gongsun Cha was continuously experimenting with different tactics. Because it was difficult to find jade scrolls on battle formations, he had even asked Zuo Mo in hopes of finding more battle formations.</p><br/><p>Unconsciously, he walked onto a path that had surpassed what everyone imagined.</p><br/><p>About twenty li from them, there were two xiuzhe roaming about, watching the changes of the battlefield from a distance. Gongsun Cha ignored them. Each time they fought, they would encounter scouts like these from other factions. These scouts were extremely skilled in flight. They would only watch from afar. If they saw the situation wasn\u2019t right, they would instantly get on a sword and fly away. There was no way of dealing with them.</p><br/><p>So even though the scouts had been discovered, Gongsun Cha only ignored them other than preparing the necessary defenses to stop these scouts from participating in the fight.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>However, the two people that were watching were not scouts. Jiang Wei was a leader of a faction. Previously he had not noticed Gongsun Cha. However, he had became alerted when Gongsun Cha had plucked up several of the other factions in succession.</p><br/><p>He wasn\u2019t unfamiliar with these factions. They had interacted before. Even though Gongsun Cha was still a distance away from his base, but he felt unsafe. So he had followed his subordinate and pretended to be scout to personally see this mysterious troop.</p><br/><p>\u201cBoss, that\u2019s them.\u201d His subordinate pointed at Gongsun Cha\u2019s group far away.</p><br/><p>Jiang Wei made a sound of acknowledgement. However, his heart was beating rapidly and his expression changed slightly. The battlefield seemed entrenched and chaotic, but to become a leader, how could he not have some good eyes?</p><br/><p>This mysterious group had clearly taken the lead. Right now, they were just playing with the other side, like a cat playing with a mouse.</p><br/><p>But after a while, he flinched with shock.</p><br/><p>That wasn\u2019t right! It wasn\u2019t playing.</p><br/><p>The chaotic battlefield gradually cleared up because this group started to organize themselves, and traces of organization.</p><br/><p>As he continued to watch, Jiang Wei\u2019s face paled, while his heart continuously dropped. This group\u2019s organization and tactics were beyond his imagination. These guys were trying new tactics! Their chaos was not created by the enemy, but by themselves. As they familiarized themselves with their new tactics, the battlefield quickly turned clear.</p><br/><p>He recognized the other side of the battle, Moustache Wang. Moustache Wang\u2019s conduct was extremely powerful, and skilled in battle. He had a group of lawless fighters under his command. When he saw the other, he had to call the other Wang ge.</p><br/><p>But someone as powerful as Moustache Wang was being used by the other to try out battle tactics! He actually was not able to resist!</p><br/><p>Watching as Moustache Wang charged left and right with his band, but appearing as though he was sinking in the bog without a way out, a hint of sorrow came into Jiang Wei\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>This group was too strong!</p><br/><p>Their cooperation was very high. It wasn\u2019t how smooth or grand their tactics were. In reality, he had seen the unfamiliarity in their cooperation at first glance . It should be a kind of tactic they had never used before. Moustache Wang did not lack skill. He had found the enemy\u2019s flaws several times, but just when the balance was to be upset, this group would use a different kind of battle tactic.</p><br/><p>That was the battle tactic they frequently used and were familiar with. It was astoundingly keen. Moustache Wang\u2019s furious counterattack would be torn to pieces in moments.</p><br/><p>Right after, this group would also return to their unfamiliar and new battle tactic in search of familiarizing their cooperation.</p><br/><p>And so it repeated.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s really terrifying!\u201d Jiang Wei muttered to himself.</p><br/><p>The subordinate didn\u2019t understand why Leader would say it was scary. In his view, the two sides had fought for this long before this group had secured the advantage, they were not as strong as they were rumored to be.</p><br/><p>Jiang Wei did not explain. He rejoiced inside that he had made a correct decision today by coming.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>A hint of a smile finally came to Gongsun Cha\u2019s lips. The xiuzhe under his command finally found rhythm with his new battle tactic. Any kind of battle tactic, no matter how well people trained, was discounted in power unless they went through true battle. The situation on the battlefield had tens of thousands of variations. It was completely different than normal training. Just copying what they normally practiced was useless.</p><br/><p>As Lil\u2019 Miss smiled, the rock in the hearts of the xiuzhe beside him finally landed.</p><br/><p>The battle quickly ended. They had captured about one hundred and fifty xiuzhe.</p><br/><p>Seeing the dense black patch of xiuzhe beside them, he couldn\u2019t help but rub his forehead, \u201cHow many xiuzhe have we already captured?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOne thousand one hundred and fifteen people,\u201d the subordinate gave a precise number.</p><br/><p>After some thought, Gongsun Cha ordered, \u201cTransport them back. It is not safe to take them with us for each battle. Send a division.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo was not here and could not put jinzhi in these captives. Due to that, he could only take all their talismans and send people to guard them. Some of the xiuzhe had been directly taken into the troops like those seal xiu, and three sword xiu who had comprehended sword essence, Moustache Wang among them.</p><br/><p>These captives were very docile.</p><br/><p>Every two or three days, they would see Gongsun Cha and the others defeat a faction. Naturally, everyone was docile. They looked fearfully at the remaining three hundred xiuzhe. Even though their own numbers were three times that of Lil\u2019 Miss, but no one dared to disobey.</p><br/><p>Before this, they had never thought there would be such a terrifying army. Of course, the xiuzhe who had seen the yao army would say the yao army were the most powerful. But even those people had to admit that this troop was the strongest troop they had ever seen other than the yao army.</p><br/><p>The subordinates had long ago suggested to Lil\u2019 Miss to send the captives back.</p><br/><p>No one felt it was too few for one hundred something people to transport more than a thousand captives.</p><br/><p>This mission landed again on Wei Ran. Lil\u2019 Miss felt that while Wei Ran\u2019s individual strength was average, but his mind was good and he was calm. This was a person worthy of nurturing. Truthfully, Wei Ran wasn\u2019t quite willing. He was enjoying the fight. If he had to transport the captives, wouldn\u2019t he fall behind the others? He had just gotten a taste of the new battle tactics.</p><br/><p>However, he did not dare to disobey Lil\u2019 Miss\u2019 commands. He could only lead his subordinates and dejectedly go to transport captives.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>Looking at a portion of the troop transporting a dark patch of xiuzhe, Jiang Wei first stilled and then instantly understood. He couldn\u2019t help but shake his head. In his view, if they included these captives in the troop, it would actually cause the battle abilities of this terrifying troop to decrease. As long as one had these three hundred people, where couldn\u2019t they go?</p><br/><p>Maybe they had other ideas, Jiang Wei thought. Suddenly, his eyes lit up.</p><br/><p>A daring idea came out.</p><br/><p>Translator Ramblings: A cliffhanger happens \u2026 \u2026 it\u2019s been a while since we had one.</p><br/><p>The Chinese has this obsession with jade, first white mutton-fat jade early on, and then green jade afterwards. I don\u2019t know why but fantasy worlds seem to have endless supplies of jade. Why does all the writing and the ornamentation have to be primarily jade? I\u2019ve never saw a story involving a jade mine. I guess jade in these worlds is very cheap and plentiful so they use it for communication and everything else and where the jade comes from isn\u2019t of any significance.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

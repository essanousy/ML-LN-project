Every jie river was very lengthy.</p><br/><p>Inside the cabin, Zuo Mo was focused on cultivation.</p><br/><p>\u201cGolden core! My golden core!\u201d Once Pu Yao spoke of the jindan, he started to become irritable. \u201cFought a jindan and almost lost your little life, and you didn\u2019t get me the golden core!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo was slightly embarrassed. Before, he had promised to give a jindan to Pu Yao but that was unfulfilled. Thinking about it now, jindan were not as terrifying as he imagined. As long as he had the right method, it was possible to defeat a jindan.</p><br/><p>After careful thought, the strongest quality of a jindan was their speed. This caused jindan to have the absolute advantage when facing ningmai xiuzhe. For a powerful jindan to kill with a strike was not uncommon, but it was not possible for one strike to kill ten ningmai.</p><br/><p>In comparison, a jindan\u2019s defensive advantage was the least eye-catching .Even though the sword energies of a single ningmai could not seriously wound them, but if dozens of sword energies struck at the same time, even a jindan could not bear it.</p><br/><p>What was most scary was if the jindan decided to kill everyone at the expense of their life. If a jindan decided to go all out, the power they could release was multiple times what it was normally.</p><br/><p>Experience was the most valuable.</p><br/><p>With the experience from last time, if he had to fight with Clear Sky Old Forefather again, he even had the confidence to kill Clear Sky Old Forefather with just Vermillion Bird Camp.</p><br/><p>Facing Pu Yao\u2019s mockery and scorn, he could only grimace inside. The reason the battle against Clear Sky Old Forefather had been so difficult was because he had been frightened by the connotations of a jindan xiuzhe. Now he knew that being on the defense would cause him to become even more reactive when facing a jindan xiuzhe.</p><br/><p>Pu Yao clearly knew this. At this point, his wailing was just to satisfy his mouth.</p><br/><p>Hearing Pu Yao natter at his ears, Zuo Mo really could not bear it any longer. He stopped his cultivation. \u201cAlright, alright! I\u2019ll make it up to you!\u201d He then muttered, \u201cAn honored Sky Yao is actually \u2026 \u2026 hmph hmph \u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Pu Yao pretended not to hear. After a while, he could resist tempting Zuo Mo, \u201cActually, jindan are very easy to kill. You didn\u2019t have the abilities before but it is different now. Look, you have so many people under your command, and you also made a breakthrough \u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBreakthrough?\u201d Zuo Mo\u2019s mind jumped. \u201cLet\u2019s talk more about this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s strange now that you speak of it. Your talent in the consciousness and ling power doesn\u2019t seem outstanding, but you are abnormally fast in cultivating the mo skills. It really is weird.\u201d Pu Yao was slightly discontent, but still said, \u201cYou still remember your mo physique?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, Jade Metal Head. Ranked fifth in the captain stage,\u201d Zuo Mo answered.</p><br/><p>\u201cExactly. At the beginning, I assumed you would go to Star and Moon Wheel. But with such coincidences, you transformed into another kind of mo physique.\u201d Pu Yao seemed slightly helpless but also grave. \u201cThere are one hundred and seventy two types of colonel mo physiques. Ranked first is Mystical Earth, second is Great Day, third is Demonic Fiend Sea.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMystical Earth is not yin or yang, and is the only mo physique in colonel level mo physiques that doesn\u2019t belong to either. The biggest reason that it is ranked first is that it can develop into any brigadier physique, including the top three brigadier physiques.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGreat Day is yang and unyielding, filled with brutal power. It is the best for developing any kind of yang and unyielding mo physique in the future. Demonic Fiend Sea is yin and deceptive, and the best for transformations.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have the Great Day mo physique?\u201d Zuo Mo seemed to understand.</p><br/><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Pu Yao explained, \u201cDuring the fight with Clear Sky Old Forefather, you coincidentally activated the big formation. The big formation processed your body, the essence of Golden Crow, hard lightning, and earth fire. All of those are yang and unyielding substances. Under these coincidental conditions, it allowed you to develop the Great Day mo physique.\u201d</p><br/><p>When he spoke to there, Pu Yao rolled his eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s just you. If this was another other mo that cultivated to Great Day mo physique, he would already have gone to find a jindan to feed on. Afraid of a jindan? Humph!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFeed?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is strange about that? The inner core of yaomo are treasures to xiuzhe, the jindan of a xiuzhe is also great food for yaomo!\u201d Pu Yao\u2019s vividly red tongue unconsciously licked his lips. \u201cYou could try. That taste is delicious.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo shook, and then swore, \u201cPu Yao, you pervert!\u201d</p><br/><p>Pu Yao was not affected. \u201cIt\u2019s you who is too ignorant. It\u2019s very normal for xiuzhe to use yaomo to forge and in dan-making. But you say we\u2019re perverts for eating golden cores?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo was speechless.</p><br/><p>He decided to not linger on this question. \u201cWhat benefits are there to this Great Day mo physique?\u201d</p><br/><p>Pu Yao became excited. \u201cThere are many benefits. Otherwise, how can it match to a jindan xiuzhe? The first is in cultivating mo skills. You practiced [Sky Wave Fist Scripture] before, so you must know the crux to fully using the power of this fist scripture is how strong your body is. Mo skills are even more extreme on this point. In the future, you will discover than any mo skill in the end it is to cultivate the body. Great Day mo physique is innately strong and powerful. It is easier to cultivate those domineering mo skills.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMo skills again, you don\u2019t have mo skills, what are you excited for?\u201d Zuo Mo responded neutrally.</p><br/><p>Pu Yao almost choked. He decided to ignore Zuo Mo, and continued, \u201cMo physiques from colonel and up have many wondrous abilities. Yaomo are not skilled in forging, and really cannot stack up to xiuzhe on talismans. What do we do to compete then? One method is a soul-tethered talisman, but they are different from the soul-tethered talisman of xiuzhe. The yaomo\u2019s soul-tethered talisman is a part of their body, like a claw, tooth, or the skin they shed, formed after being forged constantly. The other method is the transformation of the mo physique.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf the colonel mo physiques, each type of mo physique has its own transformations, but there are never more than six transformations. The reason that Mystical Earth, Great Day, and Demonic Fiend Sea can rank in the top three is because all of them possess six transformations.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo\u2019s eyes lit up upon hearing this, \u201cWhat are transformations?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSimilar to the abhinna of dhyana xiu. Didn\u2019t you get Ling Eyes activated? The transformations of a mo physique are techniques that can use the abilities of the mo physique to the greatest degree.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou understand the six transformations?\u201d Zuo Mo looked at Pu Yao with suspicion.</p><br/><p>Pu Yao said calmly, \u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI just knew. What Sky Yao, you don\u2019t understand anything \u2026 \u2026\u201d Zuo Mo muttered to himself.</p><br/><p>A vein throbbed in Pu Yao\u2019s forehead but he suppressed himself. \u201cI might not understand, but someone does.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho?\u201d Zuo Mo was very curious now.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat guy,\u201d Pu Yao said as he pointed at the gravestone.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe gravestone?\u201d Zuo Mo stilled.</p><br/><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Smugness imperceptibly flashed across Pu Yao\u2019s eyes. \u201cYou only need to agree to a little request from him, and he will teach you the six transformations of the Great Day mo physique, and also pass mo skills on to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle request?\u201d Zuo Mo instinctively detected danger. He suddenly remembered the ancient voice that sounded when Pu Yao had entered his body.</p><br/><p>That damned \u201cTo abide by my ceremony, to execute my desires, to give my oath, will thou?\u201d that had tormented him.</p><br/><p>The more he thought, the more his anger burned. In the past when ge had been tender, you felt ge was easy to bully, and shit and peed on ge\u2019s head, ge couldn\u2019t defeat you, so ge tolerated it! Now you want to trick ge! No one could tolerate this!</p><br/><p>He sprinted in front of the gravestone, and his foot heavily kicked the gravestone!</p><br/><p>\u201cIdiot! You ran into ge\u2019s sea of consciousness! Didn\u2019t give one piece of jingshi in rent! Now you scheme against ge! Do you want to live?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bang bang bang!</p><br/><p>Bang bang bang!</p><br/><p>As Zuo Mo swore loudly, his foot kicked the gravestone rapidly so much the gravestone wobbled.</p><br/><p>Seeing Zuo Mo turn berserk, his eyes bloodshot, Pu Yao was dumbstruck where he stood!</p><br/><p>He \u2026 \u2026 he dared to kick \u201chim\u201d \u2026 \u2026</p><br/><p>Heavens \u2026 \u2026</p><br/><p>After a long time, Pu Yao finally recovered. When he saw the gravestone that had almost been kicked over, his face instantly turned pale.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou \u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Just as he opened and said one word, he saw Zuo Mo stop and turned around. On the dark and vicious face was a pair of bloody and murderous eyes.</p><br/><p>Pu Yao swallowed. He felt he was being targeted by a wild beast. If he took a wrong step, Zuo Mo would instantly leap over. His throat felt tight. When his words reached his mouth, they became, \u201cLet\u2019s talk peacefully \u2026 \u2026 let\u2019s talk peacefully\u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo turned around his pot-black face, and lifted his foot again.</p><br/><p>Bang bang bang!</p><br/><p>After kicking viciously for dozens of times, he finally stopped. Before he left, he did not forget to leave words behind. \u201cIdiot, let ge tell you! You dare to scheme against ge, ge will kill you!\u201d</p><br/><p>As he finished, he was finally content and left.</p><br/><p>Pu Yao looked dumbstruck at the gravestone. The black surface of the gravestone was covered in footprints.</p><br/><p>After a long moment, Pu Yao suddenly exploded in laughter so hard he fell down.</p><br/><p>\u201cHahahaha! This is the person you picked? He has such a personality! Really has a personality! Even more of a personality than you in the past! Haha! How do you feel? It must be great! Haha, I hadn\u2019t thought there would be a day when you get kicked by other people? This is so interesting! Hahahaha! I like this guy!\u201d</p><br/><p>In the sea of consciousness, Pu Yao\u2019s roaring laughter echoed.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>When Zuo Mo left the sea of consciousness, his anger had not been completely vented. What Great Day mo physique, ge doesn\u2019t care!</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t think that if you had stuff like mo skills that you can get good things out of ge!</p><br/><p>Ge doesn\u2019t lack spells!</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo took out a large bunch of jade scrolls from the ring, and arranged them in a row.</p><br/><p>These jade scrolls had been collected over time while he was in Little Mountain Jie, and were all spells that were unique. The great majority were good fourth-grade spells. Among them, there were also two fifth-grade spells. For him, at present, this was enough to use.</p><br/><p>As to the golden core, it can go to hell!</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo suddenly had a deep understanding of a rule. Self-reliance was the true path! Back at Wu Kong Mountain, he was able to break through to the fourth level of the[Little Art of Cloud and Rain] by relying on the lowest grade jade scroll. Right now, he had this many jade scrolls and their grades were not low. There was no reason that he would deteriorate over time.</p><br/><p>Deeply stimulated by Pu Yao and the gravestone, Zuo Mo completely sank into a frenzy.</p><br/><p>Wasn\u2019t it just spells? Wasn\u2019t it just skills? You think if you hold onto the spells, you hold ge\u2019s throat?</p><br/><p>If the tiger doesn\u2019t roar, you mistake it for a sick cat?</p><br/><p>Ge will let you see why you Sky Yao and old antiques have declined to the point that you couldn\u2019t pay the rent, and had to take out the yin beads but couldn\u2019t sell them!</p><br/><p>While ge could hold a place in the outer sect of Wu Kong Sword Sect with just the [Little Art of Cloud and Rain], everyone calling out Little Mo ge, and the jingshi was rolling in!</p><br/><p>Translator Ramblings: World of Cultivation has fanart here by Ars. I love the crane feathers fan Gongsun Cha has, reminds me of Zhuge Liang.</p><br/><p>Pu Yao is like a child in this chapter. Gimme my candy, I want my candy, I WANT my CANDY! Zuo Mo\u2019s upgrade is explained and he (finally!) discovers the difference between Pu Yao and the gravestone. Bit of a lighter chapter and more Pu Yao-Zuo Mo interactions so hopefully people are satisfied. Also, look, no lil\u2019 cliffy!</p><br/><p>I researched and it turns out people pronounce \u201ca\u201d differently in English depending on geography and other influences. So the \u201ca\u201d in \u201cA Gui\u201d seems like \u201cah\u201d to me because that\u2019s how I usually say my \u201ca.\u201d Some of you might pronounce \u201ca\u201d like \u201cai\u201d or \u201ceh\u201d so please keep that in mind.</p><br/><p>Should I stick the ramblings of the past chapters back into the edited chapters. I thought they were distracting between chapters so I left them out. Do they alleviate the off-putting horror that Pu Yao might seem to be?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

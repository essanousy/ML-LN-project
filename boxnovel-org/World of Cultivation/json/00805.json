Just like how Xi Xuan was the crux to restraining Kun Lun and Tian Huan for Mo Cloud Sea, Xi Xuan\u2019s only ally in the xiuzhe world was Mo Cloud Sea.</p><br/><p>After reading through Xi Xuan\u2019s shen methodology, Zuo Mo understood why Xi Xuan hadn\u2019t kept it a secret. No wonder people said that the true ancestor of the five element shen power was the [Reverse Five Element Shen Methodology] that Shuang Yu had created. In Zuo Mo\u2019s view, Xi Xuan\u2019s [Five Element Shen Power] was middling, and lacked any exceptional qualities. If a normal sect had created this shen methodology, it naturally would be outstanding, but with Xi Xuan\u2019s status as one of the four great sects, it could be seen how sparse its talent was, to have created this mediocre shen methodology.</p><br/><p>However, Zuo Mo did not help them advance the shen methodology. He did not dare to underestimate a foundation thousands of years old. Even a rotten boat had three tenths of its weight in nails. If they had the time, who knew if they could recover?</p><br/><p>A powerful Xi Xuan definitely would not be willing to be Mo Cloud Sea\u2019s ally.</p><br/><p>After thinking for a moment, he called the two masters and gave the jade scroll to them.</p><br/><p>Disdainful expressions appeared on the two master\u2019s faces. They naturally looked down on a shen methodology of this level. There were not many that knew that Mo Cloud Sea had more than one shen methodology. Every person\u2019s cultivation base were different, because Zuo Mo\u2019s camp had a lot of xiuzhe, yao, and mo.</p><br/><p>With Zuo Mo\u2019s [Mo Cloud Shen Methodology] as the basis, there were many methodologies that branched off. Zuo Mo himself encouraged the creation of these, and would even help them perfect these shen methodologies. He didn\u2019t hide a thing.</p><br/><p>In this kind of an environment, the two masters were knowledgeable about shen power and looked down on normal shen methodologies.</p><br/><p>\u201cXi Xuan has declined as expected. This shen methodology is just worth so much,\u201d Master Sun Bao said without any courtesy.</p><br/><p>Ji Wei smacked his lips and said, \u201cIt would be good if we can get a hold of Kun Lun\u2019s and Tian Huan\u2019s shen methodologies, those two might have some good insights.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing the two masters\u2019 tone as though they were looking down on the world, Zuo Mo couldn\u2019t help but smile. He then said, \u201cUsing Xi Xuan\u2019s shen power to design shen equipment, is two months enough?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTwo months?\u201d Sun Bao dismissively snorted. \u201cHalf a month, only half a month!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHalf a month!\u201d Zuo Mo had a doubtful expression.</p><br/><p>Sun Bao met Zuo Mo\u2019s doubtful gaze and jumped as though he had been slighted. \u201cDaren, if you don\u2019t believe me, Old Sun is willing to be punished according to military law!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ji Wei\u2019s face and neck was flushed as though he had been greatly humiliated.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo jumped in fright at the two\u2019s reactions. These people were so proud. However, his attention quickly was attracted by the promise of half a month. \u201cIf that\u2019s the case, how many sets can we make before the eighth month of next year?\u201d</p><br/><p>Sun Bao thought and said, \u201cIt depends on how we make them. If we use all of our power, fifty to sixty thousand will not be a problem. However, that is only if we give up on all other missions.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWithout affecting the other missions?\u201d Zuo Mo continued to ask.</p><br/><p>\u201cTwenty to thirty thousand,\u201d Master Sun Bao sighed in relief. He didn\u2019t want to waste his time on forging these shen equipment. There were countless mysteries in the world of shen power waiting for him to explore.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs this a large order?\u201d Ji Wei suddenly said.</p><br/><p>\u201cEn, for the eighth month of next year, Xi Xuan will take as much as we make.\u201d Zuo Mo nodded.</p><br/><p>Sun Bao immediately asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s the price?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ji Wei\u2019s attention was also pulled over. The two\u2019s eyes flashed with light. While Gongsun Cha was the main economic force of Mo Cloud Sea, they also spent the most. Zuo Mo never spared what he invested into Golden Crow Camp. All kinds of high level materials, all kinds of trials, he allowed them to do what they wanted.</p><br/><p>It was only Zuo Mo\u2019s unlimited investment that caused Golden Crow Camp to become so powerful. This could be seen from the flames they used to forge. In the past, only core members would have fourth-grade Golden Crow Fire. Now, this had been spread to become the standard flame for the outer members of Golden Crow Camp.</p><br/><p>If they were willing to enter the cadet organizations, they would be gifted Golden Crow Fire.</p><br/><p>The Golden Crow Fire was harvested from the Golden Crow Macro Formation. While it was not as expensive as it was in the past, it still was significant. Distributing it so widely meant it cost a great amount but Zuo Mo never complained about this kind of investment.</p><br/><p>This directly caused the forgers from many places to furiously flood Mo Cloud Sea.</p><br/><p>Later, in order to stop this outflow of talents, Kun Lun and Tian Huan had to increase their benefits for production xiuzhe. However, Mo Cloud Sea had already gathered a great number of production xiuzhe. Fourth-grade Golden Crow Fire. So many people would save for their entire lives but not be able to buy it.</p><br/><p>Golden Crow Camp was literally a monster that ate gold. The two masters were extremely sensitive to price and profit.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe price will be dependent on your design, the profit margin will be initially set at two hundred percent.\u201d Once Zuo Mo opened his mouth, he was immediately exposed as an evil businessman.</p><br/><p>Master Sun Bao was familiar with forging and said rapidly, \u201cA set of shen equipment\u2019s basic cost is around fifty seventh-grade jingshi. Two hundred percent profit margin, that is one hundred and fifty seventh-grade jingshi. On, that\u2019s about right, the power of the shen equipment will reach about eighty percent of our Mo Cloud System.</p><br/><p>Ji Wei\u2019s eyes were bright and his breathing slightly rushed. \u201cBig business! If it is twenty thousand sets, that is two million seventh-grade jingshi. No, we have to make at least thirty thousand sets!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are ways to increase production.\u201d Sun Bao thought as he spoke, \u201cRight now, there are many low-level forgers with Golden Crow Fire. We can have them first forge the ingots for the shen equipment. That way, it will save us a lot of effort. Our shen fire pool is about to be completed. It will be able to be used to improve our efficiency. We can reduce production time. This way, we should be able to produce forty thousand sets!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFour million seventh-grade jinghsi!\u201d Even Ji Wei who had seen great amounts before couldn\u2019t help but exclaim and inhale sharply.</p><br/><p>That was a terrifying number!</p><br/><p>If this spread, it would make all of the xiuzhe world boil.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo\u2019s face was flushed but he did not let the enormous number go to his head. He said with a snicker, \u201cWe will not take jingshi, we will take materials. Jingshi is being depreciated now, and the prices of materials is increasing. This way, we will get everything out of Xi Xuan.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sun Bao and Ji Wei furiously nodded.</p><br/><p>Ever since they entered the era of shen power, the use and value of jingshi continued to decrease. It was not something essential for people to cultivate. The biggest value of jingshi came from the ling power it contained. Yet in the era of shen power, the greatest pursuit was of shen power, not ling power.</p><br/><p>Conversely, as a result of the fighting, the prices of materials had risen greatly.</p><br/><p>Especially high grade materials. The prices grew so fast it seemed they had a new price everyday. If Zuo Mo and the others hadn\u2019t secretly moved everything out of Xuan Kong Temple\u2019s Dhyana Treasure Pavilion, and all of the high grade materials that Xuan Kong Temple had accumulated over thousands of years had ended up in his hands. He would not have been able to support Golden Crow Camp\u2019s terrifying expenses.</p><br/><p>Most of the high level materials in Gongsun Cha\u2019s [City Destroyer] and Bie Han\u2019s [Arsonist] came from that.</p><br/><p>The reason that Zuo Mo had not forged shen devices was not because he didn\u2019t have the ability, but he did not have the resources. Each shen device required a piled of high grade materials each that were worth cities.</p><br/><p>After forging two shen device raiments, almost all of Mo Cloud Sea\u2019s high grade materials had been used up.</p><br/><p>Even Kun Lun and Tian Huan did not dare to casually forge shen device raiments.</p><br/><p>Shen device raiments were the ultimate weapon of this era. It represented the peak of forging for this era.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo had thought deeply about forging [City Destroyer] and [Arsonist]. A Gui already had a shen device raiment, that grey set of armor that Zuo Mo named the [Undying Ghost]. Zuo Mo also had the Anti Dragon Claw and the Three Thousand Thread of Worry. While the sum of them together could not equal a shen device raiment, they could compare to pseudo-shen weapons.</p><br/><p>Also, Zuo Mo thought that [City Destroyer] and [Arsonist] were of greater use to Mo Cloud Sea.</p><br/><p>However, four million seventh-grade jingshi was enough to forge a true shen device raiment!</p><br/><p>The excitement the three felt when facing this number could be imagined.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will leave this matter to your care,\u201d Zuo Mo said.</p><br/><p>Sun Bao jumped up and said excitedly, \u201cDaren, do not worry, this subordinated definitely will not let even one of these four million pieces of jingshi walk away!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ji Wei nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cEn, en. I\u2019m confident in your work. However, pay attention to keeping this a secret. Don\u2019t let people find out too early,\u201d Zuo Mo ordered.</p><br/><p>The two hurriedly acknowledged this, and then impatiently bid farewell to leave.</p><br/><p>It was impossible for others to be completely unalerted to a project of such scale. Mo Cloud Sea was filled with spies from all factions. While extermination was occurring constantly, these spies were like weeds that would never stop growing.</p><br/><p>As long as this matter was not exposed too early, there was no great worry.</p><br/><p>Watching the two leave, Zuo Mo\u2019s face unconsciously turned to that shen device part shaped like a tree branch.</p><br/><p>His eyes flashed with emotion. As though she detected his emotions, A Gui silently appeared behind Zuo Mo.</p><br/><p>The scars on A Gui\u2019s faces had disappeared. Her face was like the one that Zuo Mo had once seen in his memories. Her face was still expressionless and the mark on her brow was unusually clear.</p><br/><p>Her undying shen power had become even more unfathomable.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d Zuo Mo turned to smile at A Gui and then rubbed her hair.</p><br/><p>A Gui\u2019s empty eyes became gentler.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go to see.\u201d Zuo Mo pulled A Gui to walk towards the corner. The empty corner suddenly pit up and Zuo Mo and A Gui disappeared in the light.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo and A Gui appeared in a secret room.</p><br/><p>There were many things stored in these secret room. Many of the items showed marks of being burned and damaged. They also looked old.</p><br/><p>There was a helmet placed at the end of the room.</p><br/><p>The helmet was dim. Dozens of thin and long bone spikes fanned out in rows behind the helmet. At the top of the helmet, there was a crescent thin blade coming out of the forehead that arched over top and wrapped around to the back of the helmet.</p><br/><p>This was another part of the shen device raiment that his father had forged. It had been placed in Xuan Kong Temple\u2019s Dhyana Treasure Pavilion and then landed in Zuo Mo\u2019s hands. The things in this secret room were all things that Xuan Kong Temple had taken from his home in the past.</p><br/><p>When Zuo Mo came near, the dim helmet suddenly lit up with a gentle light.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo stilled, and his mind moved. He took out that tree-shaped shen device part.</p><br/><p>The helmet suddenly shook, the dozens of spikes trembling as it gave off a hotter light.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo suddenly felt pain on his hand and he instinctively let go.</p><br/><p>The tree branch turned into a streak of light and flew to the bright helmet like a bird return to the nest.</p><br/><p>Translator Ramblings: I know Fang Xiang skipped the ratios of upper grade jingshi but does someone want to estimate how many first grade jingshi Zuo Mo is making with this order?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

But this shocking insect wave seemed to be stopped by an invisible barrier when it had reached a certain part of the rock and could not go any further.</p><br/><p>Xiuzhe with good eyes would be able to see this invisible barrier was actually a streak of black shadow.</p><br/><p>The black shadow was extremely fast and almost hard to catch with the naked eye.</p><br/><p>Tenth Grade\u2019s little face was covered with sweat.</p><br/><p>His figure did not slow down as he forcibly pushed back the insect wave. As his ling power was used up, the suppressed insect wave gradually pushed near the entrance to the cave. Every time this happened, Tenth Grade would gather his energy and push the insect wave back.</p><br/><p>The two sides seemed to be playing tug-of-war.</p><br/><p>After this continued for four hours, Tenth Grade showed weariness on face.</p><br/><p>The corpses of insects had accumulated and packed on the ground. Threads of black energy rose from the bodies of the insects and burrowed into Tenth Grade\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>Every time this happened, Tenth Grade would become refreshed and his attacks would become stronger.</p><br/><p>At an area extremely close to the mouth of the cave, Lil\u2019 Black was timidly laying on a piece of rock. Its pair of antennae waved occasionally. If there was the slightest movement, it would rapidly crawl outside the cave entrance.</p><br/><p>The Little Ones had gotten the patten. These insects definitely would not take one step outside the cave. In the beginning few days, the little ones would accompany Tenth Grade into the cave but Lil\u2019 Pagoda and Li\u2019 Fire quickly got bored and left to play outside. Only Lil\u2019 Black was left to stand guard as though he was very loyal.</p><br/><p>Of course, loyalty aside, if the situation seemed to be going in a bad direction, Lil\u2019 Black would turn and run, not caring for Tenth Grade at all.</p><br/><p>Just like this, Tenth Grade made trouble day and night for the insects in the cave.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>Xu Ling City seemed to resume its peace. The restless businesspeople could finally rest their hearts.</p><br/><p>Everything seemed just like before but everyone understood the sky above Xu Ling City had changed!</p><br/><p>The battle between the Tian Family and Turtle Island hadn\u2019t just shook Xu Ling City, all of Cloud Sea Jie had been rattled!</p><br/><p>When the other factions discovered an unfamiliar battalion had suddenly charged into the ranks of the top fifty, and take the thirty second position, the first thought that occurred in their minds was, who were these people?</p><br/><p>The Xu Ling Battalion, the number one battalion of Xu Ling Sect was ranked in the eighties, and the two positions were not on the same level at all.</p><br/><p>Even though Xu Ling Sect and Turtle Island had not had any conflict, but the silence of Xu Ling City in this incident became the synonym of retreat in many people\u2019s eyes. In the eyes of the local powers of Xu Ling City, the comparison of strength between the two was clear to see at a glance. At the very least, they did not believe that Xu Ling sect could destroy the Tian Family so easily.</p><br/><p>The larger powers of Cloud Sea Jie maintained great caution towards this Turtle Island that had risen up.</p><br/><p>Looking from the intelligence reports they had gathered, Turtle Island\u2019s battalion was outfitted extremely well, with things like the Blue Soul Cold Light Armor. Their equipment was completely of fourth-grade talismans and caused many battalions to drool.</p><br/><p>Cloud Sea Jie was not a rich place. But a fourth-grade outfit like this would not be extraordinary and there were many that could buy it If it was thousands of sets, then only the most powerful factions could afford it.</p><br/><p>What really caused jealousy were the unknown golden swords in their hands. Those were talismans above fourth-grade!</p><br/><p>Talismans above fourth-grade? Wasn\u2019t that fifth-grade?</p><br/><p>When did fifth-grade talismans become a part of regular equipment? When they saw this, many people\u2019s first response was one of disbelief but the following reports all provided the truthfulness of this information. This instantly caused a great furor.</p><br/><p>Fifth-grade talisman!</p><br/><p>Fifth-grade talisman was almost another term for jindan. Those that had the purchasing power and could forge fifth-grade talismans were basically all jindan.</p><br/><p>There were no ningmai that would go and buy fifth-grade talismans. Even if they could, they would definitely not bring it out unless they were at death\u2019s door. Wealth was a crime. Any person with experience understood this.</p><br/><p>Fifth-grade talismans were enough to motivate people to kill and steal!</p><br/><p>They had never heard of a battalion where every person possessed a fifth-grade talisman!</p><br/><p>When the news of the fifth-grade talismans spread, there were many battalions that had devious thoughts but the ranking of thirty-two for Turtle island Battalion made them wary.</p><br/><p>Any battalion that entered the top fifty were not to be easily to provoked.</p><br/><p>But undoubtedly, many more people started to notice this strange faction with an unknown name.</p><br/><p>However, none of them would ever expect that an enormous alligator had made its way into this remote little pond that was Cloud Sea Jie without a sound.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>The divine light was like hell!</p><br/><p>All kinds of rays of light swept to and fro on his body. He switched between euphoria and misery. He switched between befuddlement and clarity, and tasted all the experiences of life!</p><br/><p>Pu Yao and Wei did not dare to breathe as they stared at Zuo Mo, who was shrouded in the light, with nervous expressions.</p><br/><p>Wei might have spoken with openness and bravado, but when it came to his own survival, it would be false to say he was not nervous. Ten whole hours passed, and nothing about Zuo Mo changed. Wei felt slight regret. The divine light was hard to comprehend, no one from the Sky Pool Tribe had been able to comprehend it which was why the imprint had been passed onto him.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo wasn\u2019t one from the Sky Pool Tribe \u2026 \u2026</p><br/><p>But it was too late to say anything now. He could only pray that Zuo Mo could comprehend the divine light. Otherwise, none of them could escape the divine light.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, the lights around Zuo Mo became dim.</p><br/><p>In about ten breaths, all light disappeared, and his surroundings quickly became black and a void at a rate visible to the naked eye.</p><br/><p>Joy came onto Wei\u2019s face but he feared disturbing Zuo Mo and did not dare to breath, the nervousness on his face increasing.</p><br/><p>The space one zhang around Zuo Mo completely turned to a void, a bottomless black void.</p><br/><p>Within the black void, Zuo Mo suddenly opened his eyes.</p><br/><p>Boom!</p><br/><p>A vast and authoritative presence swept furiously like a gale!</p><br/><p>Pu Yao and Wei made muffled grunts in unison. Their faces were white as they stared in shock at Zuo Mo\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo\u2019s eyes flashed with an abnormal light and were like stars in the black void. This pair of eyes did not hold one thread of emotion, like a high up deity looking down at the mortals.</p><br/><p>Pu Yao snorted coldly, the light in his bloody eye rising as he moved to retaliate.</p><br/><p>At the side, the shock that was on Wei\u2019s face was flushed away by excitement and ecstasy.</p><br/><p>At this moment, the light in Zuo Mo\u2019s eyes disappeared completely and showed their original appearance.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo felt he had had a very long dream. The rays of light in the dream had been so real but when he thought about it, he could not remember them. There was no soreness or pain in his body which was as good as when he started.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d he asked with puzzlement.</p><br/><p>\u201cCongratulations,\u201d Wei said excitedly.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo turned around and couldn\u2019t help but pause when he saw Wei. It was the first time he had seen Wei so excited. For some reason, his mood also became better.</p><br/><p>\u201cCongratulate me on what?\u201d Zuo Mo couldn\u2019t help asking. He furrowed his brow and said puzzled, \u201cI just had a very scary dream.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even though he couldn\u2019t recall it, but the thought of \u201cscary\u2019 was deeply rooted in his mind. Thinking about it now, he couldn\u2019t help but shudder.</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, wasn\u2019t I comprehending that Soul Setting Divine Light?\u201d Zuo Mo recalled what happened before and his eyes suddenly widened. He exclaimed, \u201cWas I just \u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Wei couldn\u2019t disguise the joy on his face, \u201cso congratulations!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo stilled and asked in response, \u201cI succeeded?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou completed the most difficult step!\u201d Wei\u2019s tone was excited. \u201cIn the past, I had speculated only someone like the ancient ones, with the three powers merged, could comprehend the divine light. I had not expected it to be so!\u201d</p><br/><p>Under Wei\u2019s guidance, Zuo Mo found the ray of divine light in his body as expected.</p><br/><p>But when he found the divine light, he was greatly disappointed. This divine light was as thin as a hair, grey and had none of the dazzling light of a divine light.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo couldn\u2019t help but frown. \u201cThis is the divine light?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei saw Zuo Mo\u2019s expression and knew what this guy was thinking. He wasn\u2019t angry and said with a smile, \u201cThis is the Soul Setting Divine Light. Don\u2019t judge it by its appearance, if you can comprehend its true meaning, its appearance will change. Feel it well, all the wonders of the Soul Setting Divine Light is within it. I cannot teach you the remainder, you need to comprehend on your own.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo was very discontent at Wei\u2019s irresponsible attitude. \u201cWhat about jinzhi? Didn\u2019t you say that the Soul Setting Divine Light can make jinzhi? I was aiming for the jinzhi! Wei, it is wrong for you to trick me so, you\u2019re making it a habit!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei didn\u2019t know to laugh or cry. \u201cTry to recall it, the wonder will naturally occur.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHm! There it really is!\u201d Zuo Mo\u2019s mind moved and several unfamiliar spells appeared in his mind. He was slightly shocked and carefully inspected these spells. He said, \u201cGood, you didn\u2019t con me! Wei, I\u2019m telling you, don\u2019t copy Pu and make a habit of tricking me, becoming a villain!\u201d</p><br/><p>At the side Pu Yao\u2019s face became green.</p><br/><p>Wei roared with laughter and his heart felt light. This divine light imprint had been a sickness in Wei\u2019s heart. In the past, there had been high hopes for him, the tribe had thought that he would be the person most likely to comprehend the Soul Setting Divine Light in the tribe, so this imprint had been passed onto him. Yet no matter what, he could not comprehend the divine light. When the danger had come, he had sacrificed himself, turning himself into the spirit of the artifact. He was forged into the gravestone armor though a secret method to help the people protect the tribe.</p><br/><p>Yet the tribe still was destroyed later on. Personally seeing the last clansmen die, Wei\u2019s heart ached.</p><br/><p>The gravestone armor had passed through the hands of many strong people. His owners had all being very powerful people but he had never revealed the greatest secret, Soul Setting Divine Light!</p><br/><p>Because he knew they could not cultivate it.</p><br/><p>But this imprint was like a chain of fate binding his heart. He only felt relieved of the burden today and was unspeakably happy.</p><br/><p>The Soul Setting Divine Light that intimidated all of the primitive era once again saw the light of day!</p><br/><p>Suddenly, he was full of anticipation towards the future.</p><br/><p>Translator Ramblings: The Soul Setting Divine Light is not something that will be completely understood immediately, it takes time. Zuo Mo only needs it to put in jinzhi which is not something that is extremely \u201chigh-level\u201d relative to the light itself.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

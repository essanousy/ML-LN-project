We will now have ling energy and ling power. Ling energy is now the energy that is spread out in the world which people absorb. Ling power is the stuff that people use, which is basically \u201cprocessed\u201d ling energy. Think solar energy and solar power (in cactuar\u2019s words).</p><br/><p>Chapter Eighty Nine \u2013 Silly Yao</p><br/><p>The mist faded and a hot spring had appeared. In the steam that rose up, a crowd of beautiful women who were bathing could be barely made out. Their eyes were alluring and extremely seductive. The smooth and silky skin seemed to have magnetism, securely holding Zuo Mo\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>The beauties played and laughed, disregarding Zuo Mo as empty air.</p><br/><p>When had the pitiful Zuo Mo ever seen something like this? It was like he had been struck by lightning, dumbstruck. The laughter and breathing of the women burrowed into his ear. He felt his throat was dry, his entire body hot. Something inside his body seemed to be moving.</p><br/><p>What spell was this?</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo felt his heart beat faster and faster until it felt like his heart was going to jump out of his chest, uncontrollably beating.</p><br/><p>He used all the energy in his body to struggle to swallow. He detected that his entire body wasn\u2019t normal, definitely not normal! He started to channel ling power. It didn\u2019t have an effect. He couldn\u2019t help but be shocked.</p><br/><p>\u2014 Such a strong spell! Such a strong maze formation!</p><br/><p>Calm! Calm!</p><br/><p>It was fake! Fake!</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo told himself. At this time, he should close his eyes, but for some reason, his eyelids today didn\u2019t listen to him. It seemed that there was a mysterious world in that hot spring that uncontrollably attracted his eyes. If he didn\u2019t restrain himself forcefully, his legs would unconsciously walk towards the hotspring.</p><br/><p>Tracelessly capturing a person\u2019s mind and soul. Imperceptibly controlling a person\u2019s body. Zuo Mo\u2019s last bit of rationality concluded, this group of beauties were in reality a high grade maze formation!</p><br/><p>Fourth-grade or even fifth-grade?</p><br/><p>The person trapped would feel hot, the rhythm of breathing lost, the mind disturbed, ling power channeling would be obstructed\u2026 \u2026</p><br/><p>He reflexively swallowed again. Suddenly, Zuo Mo\u2019s pupils expanded.</p><br/><p>The hot steam suddenly disappeared. Those beautiful women, without an exception, their heart-startling faces, their amazing bodies, the porcelain skin and \u2026 \u2026</p><br/><p>A blow like no other before attacked Zuo Mo like a stream of lightning. His breathing stopped, his heart stopped at this moment as well.</p><br/><p>Was this the final attack\u2026 \u2026</p><br/><p>All the beauties suddenly stopped moving like they were under a paralyzing spell. After that, with speed visible to the naked eye, they started to age and wither. The healthy and alluring skin lost the glow, the tightness, became wrinkled like the bark of a tree. Their beautiful appearance quickly withered and lost vitality.</p><br/><p>The skin turned bad, rotted and revealed the white bones inside.</p><br/><p>In the flick of a finger, a crowd of beautiful women became a crowd of skeletons.</p><br/><p>His chest heaving, Zuo Mo felt like he had ate countless mosquitoes and wanted to throw up! This reversal of events, all the blood in his body seemed to reverse flow and he almost spat out blood.</p><br/><p>The viciousness of this final attack\u2026 \u2026</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo was extremely shocked. The person who created this maze formation was really strong! He hadn\u2019t felt even a bit of ling power. This was a traceless attack. At this time, a tearing sound occurred next to his ear. The scene in front of him suddenly twisted as though it was being sucked away by something.</p><br/><p>Beautiful women, skeleton, the black and white checkerboard, it completely disappeared.</p><br/><p>He saw Pu Yao opening his mouth and a wisp of smoke was sucked inside. His state seemed comfortable and satisfied. When did Pu Yao recover? Did he just ruin the maze formation right now?</p><br/><p>Pu Yao closed his mouth and turned to look at Zuo Mo, lightly throwing down, \u201cYou have a nosebleed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo dazed and hurried to touch his nose. As expected, it was red!</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha ha ha ha ha \u2026 \u2026\u201d Pu Yao laughed carefree, his face mischievous as he looked at Zuo Mo. Zuo Mo didn\u2019t understand at all.</p><br/><p>Bleeding proved that the other\u2019s maze formation was really too strong. He had actually been wounded and bled without him noticing. But why was Pu Yao laughing?</p><br/><p>He felt that Pu Yao\u2019s laugh was slightly strange. Even now, his chest felt unspeakably uncomfortable. The last ultimate attack, the power was too amazing. The feeling of disgust lingered in his heart.</p><br/><p>Barely managing to calm down, Pu Yao glanced at Zuo Mo and started snickering again. He swept across the pink colored paper on Zuo Mo\u2019s hands and snatched it over, shoving it into his mouth. He chew two times and swallowed it down. For the second time, he had a satisfied expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026 \u2026 you eat paper?\u201d Zuo Mo pointed at Pu Yao, face full of disbelief as he asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cSuch pure yin energy, it would be a pity to waste it.\u201d Pu Yao thrust out a blood red tongue and licked his lips, still hungering.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen did you wake up?\u201d Zuo Mo asked dumbly.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen this maze formation started.\u201d Pu Yao snickered. However, Zuo Mo felt that the other\u2019s eyes as they looked at him were slightly weird.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve recovered?\u201d Zuo Mo still decided to have some concern for Pu Yao.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot that easy.\u201d Pu Yao stretched and said lazily, \u201cThe injury this time was too much. Recovering isn\u2019t that easy.\u201d From his expression, he didn\u2019t seem to be that concerned with his injury.</p><br/><p>It seemed the situation was better than he had thought. Zuo Mo felt slightly safer. He thought about the beautiful women he had just seen. He hurriedly asked, \u201cWhat maze formation was it just now? Too strong! I was injured without me noticing!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha ha ha ha ha \u2026 \u2026\u201d Pu Yao couldn\u2019t resist and started howling with laughter again, holding his stomach. Laughing to the point of not being able to stand up.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo\u2019s face was puzzled. He didn\u2019t know why Pu Yao was responding like this.</p><br/><p>This maze formation really was powerful\u2026 \u2026</p><br/><p>At a place far away from Sky Moon Jie.</p><br/><p>\u201cHm, why hasn\u2019t there been a response? Is he really not tempted by beauty? Hee Hee, has he surrendered?\u201d</p><br/><p>A girl propped up her chin and talked to herself.</p><br/><p>A while later. Still nothing. Her face was suspicious.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no reason. As long as he isn\u2019t a playboy, he shouldn\u2019t be able to resist! Is he really experienced? He didn\u2019t seem like it! Did I look wrong? This miss dislikes that kind of men the most!\u201d</p><br/><p>She completely did not know her tempting maze formation had been altered by Pu Yao and its effect had moved from one extreme to another extreme.</p><br/><p>She wasn\u2019t satisfied.</p><br/><p>In Little West Wind Yard.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you understand women?\u201d Pu Yao asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Zuo Mo looked strangely at Pu Yao. This question was so dumb and idiotic. Had Pu Yao\u2019s mind been wounded? His mind was now unclear? He reminded in goodwill, \u201cLi Ying Feng Shijie, Xiao Guo, Master. They are all women.\u201d</p><br/><p>No. No. Pu Yao had previously been an old antique of three thousand years ago but, at least, he had been somewhat normal. But now, his mind had been wounded and become dumb. Zuo Mo looked slightly sympathetically at Pu Yao. So pitiful. A Sky Yao becoming a dumb yao.</p><br/><p>Meeting Zuo Mo\u2019s gaze, Pu Yao snickered, \u201cHave you been close with a woman?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo looked with even more sympathy at Pu Yao, \u201cI\u2019m close to all of them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Pu Yao\u2019s snickers suddenly stopped, like he had choked. He suddenly found that it was very difficult to explain this matter to Zuo Mo.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen you see them, do you have any strange thoughts in your head?\u201d Pu Yao made a last effort.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh, strange thoughts?\u201d Zuo Mo struggled, and then nodded, \u201cI have.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you really do have some thoughts!\u201d Pu Yao became excited. He continued in leading, \u201cWhat thoughts?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSelling medicine.\u201d Zuo Mo bashfully and obediently answered.</p><br/><p>Pu Yao was dumbstruck.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo counted on his fingers as he said, \u201cBut it\u2019s a pity that Xiao Guo is still too poor right now. Master, she won\u2019t buy the dan that I make. Usually, only Li Ying Feng Shijie would buy. However, Xu Qing Shijie also would buy. Oh, after some more time, I would advertise moisture dan to them. And there must also be Xu Yi Xia Shijie. Oh, Hao Min might be lacking, but I won\u2019t say no to jingshi\u2026 \u2026 in the future, I will make lots and lots of dan. Elder Wei Nan\u2019s jade scrolls said that women are the best people to sell to\u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Pu Yao sprayed out blood and collapsed. After a while, his limbs twitched and he struggled up. He said, refusing to give up, \u201cDidn\u2019t you just see those naked women? Didn\u2019t you feel something?\u201d</p><br/><p>If before, Zuo Mo had been using a look reserved for silly yao, then now Zuo Mo\u2019s gaze as he looked at Pu Yao was like if he was looking at an idiot. Full of pity, he said, \u201cPu Yao, that\u2019s the seal formation!\u201d</p><br/><p>Gurgle gurgle. Pu Yao once again fell down, fresh blood furiously flowing out from his mouth like a spring.</p><br/><p>So pitiful!</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo looked sympathetically at Pu Yao who had been heavily affected.</p><br/><p>However, Zuo Mo quickly didn\u2019t have the time to sympathize with Pu Yao. The sect leader and the others all returned to the mountain. When Zuo Mo saw the deep exhaustion in the expression of the elders, he perceptively didn\u2019t say anything. The sect leader didn\u2019t say any words, only waved his hands to signal for the disciples to leave.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis time, the incident really is too big.\u201d Pei Yuan Ran sighed deeply, \u201cSky Moon Jie would not be peaceful.\u201d</p><br/><p>The others were silent. Yan Le\u2019s face was worried, \u201cWe have to take precautions. Wei Sheng\u2019s talents are so outstanding, one in a hundred years. We need to think of ways for him to reach jindan early, otherwise\u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone understood the rest. A genius, no matter the talent, before they matured, they were all very fragile. Killing an exceptional zhuji xiuzhe only required an average ningmai. They only needed a seal, a talisman\u2026 \u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, I wanted Wei Sheng to have a strong foundation. Looking at it now, time doesn\u2019t wait for me.\u201d Pei Yuan Ran gave a deep sigh. He thought for a moment and said resolutely, \u201cIn abnormal times, we have to act abnormally. Everyone, gather all your power to help Wei Sheng.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xin Yan and Yan Le nodded at the same time. Shi Feng Rong hesitated for a second and said, \u201cWhat about Zuo Mo?\u201d</p><br/><p>Pei Yuan Ran said helplessly, \u201cZuo Mo\u2019s talent might be outstanding. In another sect, they naturally would take care and nurture. But our assets, Shimei, you know it as well. If we need to put all our energy into nurturing, we could barely just nurture Wei Sheng.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes! Shimei, I only have that much in my stores. I don\u2019t even know if there is enough for just Wei Sheng.\u201d Yan Le urged.</p><br/><p>Shi Feng Rong knew that what the shixiong said was the truth. Wu Kong Sword Sect wasn\u2019t some large sect and didn\u2019t have much wealth. How were young experts made? Made from countless jingshi and lingdan! Wei Sheng was the undisputed successor of the sect. Shi Feng Rong knew very well.</p><br/><p>However, Zuo Mo was her disciple. She gritted her teeth, \u201cI do not have objections on nurturing Wei Sheng. But since Zuo Mo won\u2019t have a share of the resources, then we should reimburse him in other areas. If I need to make dan for Wei Sheng, in the future, I won\u2019t have time to teach him and will have to leave him to his own devices.\u201d Speaking of it, she was slightly sorrowful and then raised her head, \u201cI only have a request. Other than some special jade scrolls, all the jade scrolls in the sect should be open for him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis\u2026 \u2026\u201d Pei Yuan Ran was slightly hesitant. Shi Feng Rong\u2019s request was against the sect\u2019s rules. But when he saw the determination on Shi Feng Rong\u2019s face, he still nodded, \u201cYes, I agree.\u201d Nurturing Wei Sheng. The most important part was the supply of lingdan. On this point, Shi Feng Rong was extremely important.</p><br/><p>Pei Yuan Ran was a charismatic person. He thought and then stood, \u201cSince the situation is this bad, the jade scrolls would be garbage if they are in the pavilion. From today onwards, all the jade scrolls in the sect will be open to all inner sect disciples.\u201d</p><br/><p>And then the whole of Wu Kong Sword Sect shook!</p><br/><p>Translator Rambling: So slightly major business first. I changed the term.</p><br/><p>Second, I know and agree it totally sucks that the elders want to focus on Wei Sheng. Pei Yuan Ran is bribing Shi Feng Rong, who really is trying her best within her limits since the other is her sect leader/boss. I\u2019m going to play devil\u2019s advocate and say Pei Yuan Ran is investing in what looks to be the most profitable venture.</p><br/><p>On the other hand, the elders are terrible at making money!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

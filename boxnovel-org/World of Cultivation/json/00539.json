Shi Dong also looked at Lil\u2019 Miss.</p><br/><p>Speaking of this, Ye Ling and Shi Dong\u2019s attitudes towards Zuo Mo and Lil\u2019 Miss were completely different from each other. Ye Ling was completely loyal and followed Zuo Mo faithfully as he felt that Zuo Mo could possibly become the true king. His respect towards Lil\u2019 Miss was more the kind of respect towards a commanding officer. On the other hand, Shi Dong felt doubt about Ye Ling\u2019s idea that Zuo Mo could become king but he was truly respectful towards Lil\u2019 Miss who had defeated him.</p><br/><p>\u201cEn, go ask around, who knows where Shattered Stone Jie is?\u201d Lil\u2019 Miss said after thinking.</p><br/><p>The two accepted the order and left.</p><br/><p>They quickly came back to report.</p><br/><p>\u201cDaren, this subordinate has found it. There is a small jie called Shattered Stone Jie but it is very remote, it does not produce any special products. It is supposedly the territory of someone called Ceng Yi,\u201d Ye Ling carefully reported. He was curiously. Why was Lil\u2019 Miss Daren interested in Shattered Stone Jie?</p><br/><p>Did that poor and remote little jie have something of value?</p><br/><p>When Ye Ling and Shi Dong privately talked, they both thought that their king\u2019s great work should first start from Little Savage Jie.</p><br/><p>Little Savage Jie was the jie they had lived in before. With the chaos rift, they could quickly enter Little Savage Jie. More importantly, Little Savage Jie was completely unprepared at this time. It would not be hard to take down the local powers with Turtle Island\u2019s strength.</p><br/><p>They had seen Vermillion Bird Camp\u2019s terrifying combat capabilities, and according to their observations, the power of Vermillion Bird Camp members was still improving at a terrifying rate. This was something that amazed the two of them. High rates of growth were extremely scary for battalions that had reached that certain level of strength, like Vermillion Bird Camp.</p><br/><p>Grey Camp was also progressing at the same rapid rate.</p><br/><p>Being able to practice mo skills that they dreamed about made them feel like they were in a fantasy when they held it. Every mo in Grey Camp cultivated as though they were dying of thirst. They did not need to be pressured to train. Every mo was clear about the value of this mo skill.</p><br/><p>Shi Dong\u2019s brow also furrowed. When he found out where Shattered Stone Jie was, he though that attacking Shattered Stone Jie was not a good choice.</p><br/><p>\u201cDaren, Shattered Stone Jie is of no value to us.\u201d Shi Dong was extremely proud and a pure battle general. He stated his thoughts bluntly and directly. This was also one of the important reasons that he had never been promoted.</p><br/><p>Ye Ling knew that Shi Dong\u2019s action was not good. Just as he was going to speak to help Shi Dong out, he heard Lil\u2019 Miss speak.</p><br/><p>\u201cValue? Oh, I do not want Shattered Stone Jie.\u201d Lil Miss shook his head, \u201cBut I need to you go get someone.\u201d</p><br/><p>Get a person?</p><br/><p>Shi Dong had a confused expression but Ye Ling\u2019s heart jumped.</p><br/><p>Ye Ling thought of King who had not shown himself recently!</p><br/><p>Was it \u2026 \u2026</p><br/><p>Noticing the shock in Ye Ling\u2019s eyes, Lil\u2019 Miss smiled slightly. \u201cYour king is in Shattered Stone Jie right now. Out of safety, I feel that we need to send some people over.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKing is in Shattered Stone Jie!\u201d Shi Dong\u2019s eyes were wide in shock. He could not imagine how King had suddenly ran over to Shattered Stone Jie.</p><br/><p>\u201cDoes King not have any guards?\u201d Ye Ling was frightened.</p><br/><p>\u201cOnly Miss A Gui.\u201d Lil\u2019 Miss spread his hands.</p><br/><p>Ye Ling jumped like a cat whose tail was stepped on. \u201cNo guards! Heavens! How can there not be any guards! No guards, he\u2019s the king! How can we let the King enter such a dangerous place alone \u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking at Ye Ling that was shouting as he waved his hands about, Lil\u2019 Miss was astounded.</p><br/><p>Up until now, they had never had similar thoughts unless it was to fight on the battlefield. In the eyes of Lil\u2019 Miss and the others, Zuo Mo was like a cockroach and possessed great and strong vitality. With his cunning and slippery personality and endless bag of tricks, even if he could not win, escaping wasn\u2019t a problem.</p><br/><p>Unless it was a special circumstance, people would rarely worry about Zuo Mo\u2019s safety.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot alone,\u201d Lil\u2019 Miss added weakly, \u201cthere is also A Gui.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss A Gui?\u201d Ye Ling was so furious his eyes were popping out. \u201cMiss A Gui is so gentle and fragile \u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>A Gui was gentle and fragile \u2026 \u2026 Lil\u2019 Miss sweated slightly. Looking at Ye Ling that appeared to almost go into a rage, he interrupted, \u201cSo, so, I have decided to sent you. I believe you can fulfill this mission perfectly!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI, Ye Ling, will use my life to guard my King\u2019s glory!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye Ling shouted his oath!</p><br/><p>Lil\u2019 Miss weakly swallowed. Fanatics were really scary!</p><br/><p>Shi Dong suddenly inserted, \u201cLil\u2019 Miss Daren!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lil\u2019 Miss Daren \u2026 \u2026</p><br/><p>The corner of Lil\u2019 Miss\u2019 eyes twitched and he narrowed his eyes. He smiled bashfully and appeared harmless.</p><br/><p>No one had ever dared to call this \u201cnickname\u201d in front of him \u2026 \u2026 never! This damned guy \u2026 \u2026</p><br/><p>The pitiful Shi Dong who thought that Lil\u2019 Miss\u2019 actual name was Lil\u2019 Miss because Ma Fan and the others always used that name, had unwittingly stepped on a mine in a very natural fashion.</p><br/><p>Even someone as clever as Ye Ling did not detect anything in front of Lil\u2019 Miss\u2019 gentle smile. How could Shi Dong who had a one-track mind react in time?</p><br/><p>He said directly, \u201cIf this is the case, this subordinate suggests to first take Little Savage Jie!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Savage Jie?\u201d Lil\u2019 Miss stilled.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is the jie we originally lived in, it is a little jie and does not have any strong powers.\u201d Shi Dong\u2019s words flowed. \u201cOnly by taking over Little Savage Jie can we guarantee that our avenue of retreat is not blocked off.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShixiong knows transportation formations,\u201d Lil\u2019 Miss said.</p><br/><p>\u201cDaren may not know.\u201d This time, it was Ye Ling that spoke. He had been the quartermaster and knew more about this area. \u201cThe requirements for these kind of extreme long-distance transportation formations are very stringent and the risk during use is very high. Its greatest weakness is that it will produce extremely strong power vibrations and attract the attention of the jie\u2019s strong people.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lil\u2019 Miss\u2019 brow furrowed. \u201cNan Yue and Cang Ze came through the transportation formation.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat only means that their jie does not have anyone strong to interfere.\u201d Calmed down, Ye Ling was a completely different person. \u201cDaren, the mo have a strong sense of territory. Any action that can intrude onto their territory is the same as a provocation to war. These strong people will only need to create a small amount of interference when the transportation formation is at work and the target of the transportation would shift. With a transportation of such an extreme distance, the slightest change would be the difference between life and death. Xiuzhe and yaomo have fought for so many years and never dared to used such a move before.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo that is why.\u201d Lil\u2019 Miss finally understood.</p><br/><p>He had an unorthodox education and did not know many things that were common knowledge. Before the Sky-Splitting Calamity, everyone had been fighting at Bloody Sky Metropolis Jie. This must have been the reason.</p><br/><p>Lil\u2019 Miss became silent. If this was the case, taking over Little Savage Jie became extremely important. The chaos rift was the passage into the mo territories and he would only feel assured if it was in their hands.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe only need Grey Camp and we can sweep Little Savage Jie!\u201d Shi Dong said proudly. He raised his head and looked at Lil\u2019 Miss\u2019s gaze directly, full of fighting spirit!</p><br/><p>The present Grey Camp was multiple times as strong as it was in the past! Shi Dong had been the top battle general in Little Savage Jie before but his battalion had not been one of the top. He had always had to take the most difficult and dangerous missions. All of his subordinates were old soldiers that were experienced but were limited by their talent and their skill, they had reached a peak and could not improve.</p><br/><p>The appearance of [Great Day Hardship Guard] was like a key to these people with great experience and took them into a completely new world.</p><br/><p>All of them had breakthroughs!</p><br/><p>It was due to this that Shi Dong dared to promise such a thing.</p><br/><p>Lil\u2019 Miss made a decision after a moment of silence. \u201cGood! Shi Dong will go to fight Little Savage Jie and Black Turtle Camp will take over guarding the chaos rift. Ye Ling and Shu Long will pick a small group from Guard Camp and go to Shattered Stone Jie. En, Nan Yue and the others will also go.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Grey Camp were all mo and there would not be considered outsiders if they suddenly counter-attacked. If it was Vermillion Bird Camp, all of Little Savage Jie would unite together and the matter would become much more troublesome.</p><br/><p>Ye Ling and Shi Dong took their orders.</p><br/><p>Lil\u2019 Miss\u2019 orders were passed down at the fastest possible speed.</p><br/><p>All of Turtle Island started to move like enormous cogs in a machine.</p><br/><p>Shi Dong was proud but he was not stupid. He knew since he spoke in front of Lil Miss, he had to complete the mission and do well.</p><br/><p>What could be called well?</p><br/><p>Fast!</p><br/><p>The faster the better!</p><br/><p>The major powers of Little Savage Jie did not know someone was targeting them.</p><br/><p>In secret, the guard on the chaos rift changed. Ma Fan wanted to go to the front lines but they didn\u2019t dare to disobey Lil\u2019 Miss\u2019 orders.</p><br/><p>The first to leave was not Shi Dong, but Ye Ling and Shu Long\u2019s group. They would first enter Little Savage Jie before it became chaotic and depart for Shattered Stone Jie.</p><br/><p>There were not many people in Shu Long\u2019s group, only about one hundred people. Under Ye Ling\u2019s suggestion, they disguised themselves as a merchant convoy.</p><br/><p>Even though they were only one hundred people, but they were the elite. Nan Yue, Cang Ze, Ming Jue Zi were among them, and all the experts of Guard Camp were included. A Wen was present and also five flower yao.</p><br/><p>Ye Ling was mo, Nan Yue and the others were yao, Shu Long and A Wen cultivated mo skills, the flower yao also cultivated yao arts.</p><br/><p>This group was extremely plausible. The relationship between yao and mo was good and they were in a kind of alliance. The interactions among the common people were even more frequent and it was possible to frequently see yao in the territories of mo.</p><br/><p>Guard Camp\u2019s mo skill, and the flower slave\u2019s yao arts were extremely profound. There wasn\u2019t any hint of a xiuzhe presence on them, and they seemed to be true-blooded yaomo.</p><br/><p>Ye Ling had relationships and connections with all levels of society and they passed smoothly into Little Savage Jie</p><br/><p>Even now, Little Savage Jie did not know that Shi Dong and Ye Ling had betrayed them. At the beginning, they sent the two in order to test the waters and did not pay much attention. After they defected, Grey Camp had continued to guard the chaos rift so, naturally, no one suspected them.</p><br/><p>Looking at the scenery that was completely different than the xiuzhe world, Shu Long and the others were astounded.</p><br/><p>Out of worry for Zuo Mo\u2019s safety, all of them were burning with impatience and headed towards Shattered Stone Jie at top speed.</p><br/><p>But Shattered Stone Jie was too far away, they needed time.</p><br/><p>Translator Ramblings: Outside POV. Gongsun Cha is Zuo Mo\u2019s second in command and I can just imagine his frustrations if he wasn\u2019t so obsessed with fighting and victory. My leader decided to go off exploring again \u2026 \u2026 and again \u2026 \u2026 and get in trouble I need to rescue him out of.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

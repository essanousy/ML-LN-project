When he returned home, he instantly settled down and started to ponder on his [Ten Crow Celestial Domain] and the Reversed Stellar Revolution.</p><br/><p>Right now, five of ten suns of his Ten Crow Celestial Apparatus mo physique had turned bright. In other words, it meant that half of the suns were lit up. Other than this, he had an unexpected gain in the second transformation of the Ten Crow Celestial Apparatus: the Sun Hammer. However, what was most attractive to Zuo Mo was the [Ten Crow Celestial Domain] and the Reversed Stellar Revolution.</p><br/><p>The Ten Crow Celestial Domain was called the top domain of general level, and unparalleled in its dominance. If he could comprehend it, it meant that he would ascend to the top ranks of general level experts in one leap. However, he quickly discovered that it was not as simple as it seemed. Right now, he had just reached the doorway towards domain, and his own domain had not formed yet.</p><br/><p>There was still a long path to walk, but Zuo Mo now had a general notion of what a domain was. There was a profound power between the five suns. This kind of power formed a domain.</p><br/><p>These powers were like chaotic streams that had to be slowly organized. When they were better organized and perfected, the domain would also be perfected.</p><br/><p>This was something that would take time and there were no shortcuts to take.</p><br/><p>What had surprised Zuo Mo the most was the Reversed Stellar Revolution. After he had returned home and examined it in detail, he found the parts of it that were sparks of fire were made from shen power!</p><br/><p>Their structure was unique and complex. Zuo Mo wanted to study the structure, but when he reached out with his mind, he felt dizzy. He immediately understood that this was out of his reach at the moment.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo understood that the reason the sparks were powerful was not because they were the Reversed Stellar Revolution but because they contained shen power.</p><br/><p>This seemed more like a method of channeling shen power.</p><br/><p>He understood little about shen power. He thought about asking Ceng Lian Er but then gave up.</p><br/><p>As to the Reversed Stellar Revolution, Zuo Mo had thrown it to the back of his mind. When would he have the time to cultivate a yao art domain? In any case, he did not have the time now!</p><br/><p>So Zuo Mo focused on organizing his newly formed Ten Crow Celestial Domain under Pu Yao\u2019s icy smile.</p><br/><p>Then he thought about how he could inquire about Xiao Guo and Li Ying Feng with Princess Xia when he met with her in three days.</p><br/><p>For some reason, that woman gave him a feeling she was not an easy one to deal with.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you think of Xiao Mo Ge?\u201d Princess Xin suddenly asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cHis power is very strange.\u201d The sound of the heavy armored guard came from inside the armor.</p><br/><p>\u201cVery strange?\u201d Princess Xin did not understand.</p><br/><p>\u201cEn.\u201d The heavy armor guard treasured his words as though they were gold.</p><br/><p>Princess Xin\u2019s delicate brow furrowed; but even in irritation, Princess Xin was dignified. Her finger unconsciously tapped the tabletop. \u201cIn that case, he is a very good choice.\u201d</p><br/><p>The heavy armor guard was silent.</p><br/><p>A moment later, Princess Xin made a decision. \u201cCome in!\u201d</p><br/><p>A servant pushed open the door and entered. \u201cPrincess!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSend someone to deliver an invitation to Mister Xiao Mo Ge to attend an evening banquet. The time will be in four days,\u201d Princess Xin said lightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d The servant acknowledged and left.</p><br/><p>Princess Xin suddenly smiled. \u201cA Xia might have some objections about me now.\u201d</p><br/><p>The heavy armor guard was silent.</p><br/><p>Princess Xin\u2019s mind wandered as she gazed out of the window.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>\u201cGrandpa Zhu, are we inviting Xiao Mo Ge?\u201d Princess Wan asked curiously with wide eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Zhu Ke smiled slightly. \u201cHis future is limitless, it would be a pity to give up on a talent like this. Also \u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He suddenly stopped speaking.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Princess Wan nodded, but not in full understanding. She asked with a tilted head, \u201cThen what are we inviting him over to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust to eat a meal,\u201d Zhu Ke said with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cWill Elder Sister Xia blame us?\u201d Princess Wan said anxiously.</p><br/><p>Zhu Ke said with a smile, \u201cYour Elder Sister Xia is a very strong person. However, her biggest mistake this time is aiming for too much.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAiming? What is Elder Sister Xia aiming for?\u201d Princess Wan asked curiously.</p><br/><p>\u201cPrincess will know when it is time.\u201d Zhu Ke put down the pen in his hand. After closely reading over the invitation, he made a satisfied expression. He handed the invitation to a servant that had been waiting at the side as he penned the letter. The servant immediately left upon receiving the invitation.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>Adhering to his nomral routine, Zuo Mo went to Luo Li Shixiong\u2019s room. Luo Li Shixiong did not have any signs of energy but his body had not become rigid as was usual for death and was soft as was usual.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo\u2019s worries eased slightly. No one had cultivated the Life-Death Lock before, and he had been worried. If it wasn\u2019t that Luo Li Shixiong had been seeking death, he never would have taken it out.</p><br/><p>A Gui\u2019s shen power was increasing rapidly, but what made him happy was that, while the increase in shen power was astounding, the light in A Gui\u2019s eyes seemed to be increasing similarly.</p><br/><p>Her eyes were more lively than in the past, and she had more responses.</p><br/><p>This made Zuo Mo very happy, even happier than when he had the breakthrough.</p><br/><p>But when he received the two invitations, he was stunned where he stood.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you hear, Princess Xin and Princess Wan could not resist! They each sent an invitation to Xiao Mo Ge at the same time!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTsk tsk, this time, Xiao Mo Ge has something to posture about! Three princesses extending invitations at the same time, how long has it been since this occurred?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHa, Princess Xin and Princess Wan are not stupid. It would be strange if they did not try to recruit such a powerful person! Also, the matter of the Great Peace Treasure Pavilion has made such a ruckus, one more expert is one more bit of power.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere did this Xiao Mo Ge really come from \u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The sounds on the street all fell into Nanmen Xue\u2019s ears. Nanmen Xue had an arm around a beautiful woman as he shook his head and smiled. \u201cThis really disrupts one\u2019s dreams.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease! Right now, the entire city is crazy.\u201d The male opposite Nanmen Xue also had a displeased expression. He then smiled strangely and said, \u201cIn the past, even Qi Diao Yu did not get this kind of attention!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing the name Qi Diao Yu, Nanmen Xue glanced at the other. \u201cDo you not want me to have a good day today?\u201d</p><br/><p>The other laughed. \u201cI just think that you have sunk and do not have any spirit. I find it strange, why you didn\u2019t try to find trouble with Qi Diao Yu?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m too lazy to pay attention to him,\u201d Nanmen Xue said unconcernedly. He hugged the beauty at his side, kissed her and said with pleasure on his face, \u201cWith a beauty in hand, idleness is the best of life. You guys fight and kill all day, don\u2019t you find it bothersome?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d The other seemed to agree. \u201cIn this world, the strong eat the weak. Right now, you are in Great Peace City and no one dares to target you. However, a dragon is not a part of the scenery. You are accompanied by beauties every day, you look to be carefree, but in truth, you must find it boring.\u201d</p><br/><p>The other did not look at Nanmen Xue and said directly, \u201cThose say, drunken and lying in the lap of a beauty, wake with the power of the world in hand, are you someone to submit?\u201d</p><br/><p>Nanmen Xue roared with laughed. \u201cNo matter how clever your tongue is, what does it have to do with me?\u201d</p><br/><p>The other was not angry and said with a smile, \u201cI heard that Shi Yue Yi has been searching for a person all this time.\u201d Then he said meaningfully, \u201cThe Great Peace Treasure Pavilion has been sleeping for such a long time, it is time for it to see the light of day again.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nanmen Xue did not seem to hear it.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn the past, Brother Nanmen dominated the Little Sparrow Water\u2019s twelve jie. With one call, the heroes all submitted. But right now, you have lost your spirit and immersed yourself in drunkenness; you are a completely different person.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nanmen Xue smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201cOther people do not know the reason and laugh at Brother Nanmen for falling off the path. However, I know of Brother Nanmen\u2019s love and your unchanging heart!\u201d This male stared at Nanmen Xue, emphasizing each word.</p><br/><p>Nanmen Xue\u2019s smile suddenly faded, his expression turning cold as his presence locked tightly onto the other!</p><br/><p>\u201cYou investigated me!\u201d</p><br/><p>The light words were like the clang of bells and shot to the bottom of the other\u2019s heart. The other felt his blood and energies roil, his breathing becoming difficult. He was shocked. Such terrifying power!</p><br/><p>He gritted his teeth and persisted. \u201cNanmen Xue, do you not want to rescue the person you love?\u201d</p><br/><p>Murderousness flashed in Nanmen Xue\u2019s eyes as his hand shot up.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have Fire Heart Gall!\u201d</p><br/><p>The other\u2019s words caused Nanmen Xue\u2019s expression to suddenly change. He grabbed the other. \u201cSay that again!\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking at Nanmen Xue\u2019s handsome features that were twisted, and his undisguised murderousness as well as the presence that was securely locked onto him; the other began to suffocate.</p><br/><p>He gritted out, \u201cI have Fire Heart Gall!\u201d</p><br/><p>Nanmen Xue\u2019s hand opened and the male collapsed on the ground. He was unable to climb up and the beauty beside Nanmen Xue was unconscious.</p><br/><p>\u201cName your terms,\u201d Nanmen Xue said coldly.</p><br/><p>This male panted and his mind was filled with terror as though death was right in front of him.</p><br/><p>After panting for a while, this male struggled out, \u201cYou have to exchange for it with an item from the Great Peace Treasure Pavilion.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGreat Peace Treasure Pavilion? You believe rumors like that,\u201d Nanmen Xue said with a cold smile. \u201cI have been in Great Peace City for this long and never heard of a Great Peace Treasure Pavilion before.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is true.\u201d The male finally managed to struggle back up into a standing position. \u201cYou do not need to know where I learned of the information. I\u2019m also working for someone else.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nanmen Xue glanced at the other and asked icily, \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are three items in the Great Peace Treasure Pavilion.\u201d The male recovered and so did his expression. \u201cRight now, we know that there is a stone stele inside.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStone stele?\u201d A look flashed through Nanmen Xue\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, you have studied the steles of the Great Peace Mo Steles, so you should have already guessed that they are missing one piece!\u201d The male said gravely, \u201cThe most important piece. When Shi Zi Ming created the stele forest, he hid the most important piece. Qi Diao Yu is also looking for this stele.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nanmen Xue was silent. He was starting to believe the other\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>\u201cOur condition is very simple. Use that stele to trade for the Fire Heart Gall.\u201d The male said gravely, \u201cYou help us obtain that stele, and the Fire Heart Gall is yours. With the Fire Heart Gall, not just Ten Thousand Year Mystical ice, even the strongest ice energy can be dissipated!\u201d</p><br/><p>Nanmen Xue stared at the other. \u201cHow can I trust you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLook at this.\u201d The other took out an object and flashed it at Nanmen Xue.</p><br/><p>Nanmen Xue\u2019s pupils shrank into pinpoints.</p><br/><p>Translator Ramblings: Zuo Mo finally gets attention \u2026 \u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

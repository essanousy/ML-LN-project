Li Shu respectfully walked in and first bowed towards Elder Shen.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Looking at A Shu\u2019s face, it seems that you are worried about something.\u201d Elder Shen asked Li Shu with a warm expression. Li Shu was an inner sect disciple and deeply liked by the sect leader so even he had to give him some face.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not afraid that Elder will laugh. But for some reason, this disciple feels slightly unconfident.\u201d Li Shu grimaced.</p><br/><p>He had only taken over this mission in the recent few years but he knew more than Elder Shen. From the moment the location of the ruins had been divined, the sect had sent Lu Zhen and the others to set up Xu Ling Sect. All the signs indicated that the sect wanted the Sun Shen Temple ruins.</p><br/><p>He finally learned later that there was a wondrous treasure inside the Sun Shen Temple ruins that was extremely important to the sect. However, he did not know what treasure it was. For this, the sect even sent out a yuanying elder!</p><br/><p>In his experience during the many years he had been in the sect, the yuanying elders were all in deep seclusion and only focused on cultivation. It was hard to even get see their face. This was the first time he saw a yuanying elder out on a mission.</p><br/><p>It was possible to see from this just how much importance the sect placed on this mission`s success.</p><br/><p>If there was any misstep in the mission this time, he naturally would not escape the judgment of \u201cunable to carry out matters.\u201d This would be extremely disadvantageous for his future in the sect. The sect leader paid great attention to him but in reality, there were many disciples like him.</p><br/><p>Elder Shen said with a smile, \u201cA Shu does not need to worry. Before leaving, the sect leader made a special divination and did not see any sudden changes. As for the Masked Assassin, even though he has some small fame but this old man has a slight grasp on the situation. The other two yuanying have pretty good cultivation, but in other matters, they amount to just that.\u201d</p><br/><p>In his tone, he was extremely disdainful of the two yuanying from Cloud Sea Jie.</p><br/><p>The worry on Lu Shu\u2019s face decreased greatly. The sect leader\u2019s godly divination had never been disproven before. Just yesterday, he had received the sect leader\u2019s paper crane. There was only gentle motivation on the paper crane, and nothing else. If there really was change, how could the sect leader not know?</p><br/><p>It seemed that he was really worrying too much.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder is right, losing composure like this, this disciple needs more training,\u201d Li Shu said.</p><br/><p>Elder Shen was not concerned and said with a smile, \u201cA Shu\u2019s personality is cautious. Not bad, not bad. When this old man was the same age as A Shu, this one was even less skilled at keeping one\u2019s composure. There are four more days until the shen temple opens. A Shu should have a good rest in these days to be in the best condition.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d Li Shu responded. The elder\u2019s tone was warm but the meaning in the words was still for him to stop thinking nonsense.</p><br/><p>There should not be anything that would go wrong in the span of four days.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard you failed?\u201d a middle-aged person with a white face and no beard said with a smile, \u201cThat is rare. If this spreads, this person might become famous.\u201d</p><br/><p>In front of him, the Masked Assassin was wordless like a wooden puppet and the pale white mask was frightening to look at.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy did you think of attacking this person? Did you discover something?\u201d the middle-aged male asked with curiously.</p><br/><p>He had jumped in fright when he received the news. He and the Masked Assassin had worked together for a long time and he understood the other well. The Masked Assassin walked in the darkness but was not a murderous person. Other than the targets of assassination, he almost never acted against other people.</p><br/><p>He had actually attacked a complete stranger, how could he not be shocked? What was even more shocking was that he had failed!</p><br/><p>The middle-aged male\u2019s first response when he heard this was, impossible! Even when the topic had heated up later on, he still did not believe it until now.</p><br/><p>The response of the Masked Assassin proved the truth.</p><br/><p>\u201cIntuition,\u201d the masked assassin treated words as though they were worth gold and gave the one word answer.</p><br/><p>\u201cIntuition?\u201d The middle-aged male was shocked. He had thought of countless possibilities but this was not among them.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe will affect my target.\u201d The Masked Assassin\u2019s voice was hoarse and unpleasant to hear like the sound of sandpaper rubbing.</p><br/><p>\u201cAffect your target?\u201d The middle-aged male was astonished. But as one who was familiar with the other, he instantly understood what the other meant. \u201cYou mean that you intuitively feel that he would affect our matter?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes,\u201d the Masked Assassin responded.</p><br/><p>The middle-aged male became silent. He knew that the Masked Assassin had many curious qualities. This was also one of the reasons he never failed.</p><br/><p>The Masked Assassin\u2019s intuition felt that the other would affect their target, this caused the middle-aged person to feel it was fantastical.</p><br/><p>But for some reason, the middle-aged male believed slightly in it.</p><br/><p>\u201cShould we think of a way to kill him?\u201d the middle-aged male inquired.</p><br/><p>\u201cFormation is strong,\u201d the Masked Assassin said.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what?\u201d the middle-aged male asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t know.\u201d</p><br/><p>The middle-aged male was speechless..</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>\u201cThis method is very simple, it is applying the Sun Crystal Seed to your body,\u201d Qing Lin explained.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis thing is useful?\u201d Zuo Mo took out the Sun Crystal Seed. Since the other had found it, there was no reason to keep hiding it.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour power is not enough, and cannot take in the Sun Crystal Seed. The person who sealed the Sun Crystal Seed must also have thought this,\u201d Qing Lin continued, \u201cBut he probably would not have thought that you would come across a Sun Shen Temple.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo\u2019s eyes were perked up in fear of missing a word.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Sun Crystal Seed is the seed of the Sun Tribe\u2019s totem and used to nurture the totem warriors of their tribe. The totem warriors were strong but they also had great constraints. Since the Sun Tribe is gone now, and so is the belief of the tribe members, there is no totem power, and you cannot become a totem warrior.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo was instantly greatly disappointed. After all this, this stuff had lost its effect.</p><br/><p>Seeing the disappointment on Zuo Mo\u2019s face, Qing Ling couldn\u2019t help smiling, \u201cYou may not be able to become a totem warrior, but the Sun Crystal Seed itself is a rare and precious treasure in our world. It naturally has its own extraordinary properties. Do you know how the Sun Crystal Seed forms?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo finally became spirited again. \u201cHow does it form?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEach generation of totem warriors from the Sun Tribe would try all they can to go to those primitive worlds, or places of chaos to search for unformed suns. They would first seal them into crystals, and then forge them day and night using the power of belief. Fifty years later, it would become a Sun Crystal Seed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo gaped on hearing this.</p><br/><p>An unformed sun \u2026 ..</p><br/><p>Motherf***er, so ge is holding a little sun!</p><br/><p>\u201cEach Sun Crystal Seed is a priceless treasure! If the Sun Tribe did not fall and die out, how could this Sun Crystal Seed end up in the hands of someone else?\u201d Speaking of this, Qing Lin became slightly emotional. He shook his head and then said, \u201cYour luck is pretty good to be able to encounter such an object, and also a person that could seal this object. Now you have also encountered a Sun Shen Temple that has not disappeared. Maybe there really is fate.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing Zuo Mo\u2019s shocked face, Qing Lin grinned. He had a pretty good feeling about Zuo Mo. This person seemed slippery of the tongue and slightly cunning but still had a pure heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe belief power in this Sun Crystal Seed probably has dissipated. If another ten thousand years passes, it may form another sun. In the future, you have to remember not to reveal the fact you possess the Sun Crystal Seed to prevent a calamity from falling on you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing this, Zuo Mo nodded furiously.</p><br/><p>In the past, he only knew that this object was probably extraordinary, but he did not know how this was useful. After learning this, he finally understood how valuable of a gift the strange corpse had given him!</p><br/><p>\u201cOriginally, the Sun Crystal Seed needs to be worshipped at the sacrificial altar before it can be absorbed. But the sacrificial altar in the shen temple has been abandoned for a long time. So we have to use a stupid method.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Qing Lin spoke, a jade-like water droplet suddenly condensed at his fingertip as he gently poked Zuo Mo\u2019s forehead.</p><br/><p>Boom!</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo felt a coolness spread from his brow and roll downwards.</p><br/><p>His entire body was unspeakably comfortable, and his mouth and nose was filled with the scent of fresh flora.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis Greenvine Mystical Water is your big brother\u2019s meeting gift to you,\u201d Qing Lin said with a smile. His face was slightly pale. \u201cIt is very lacking compared to the Sun Crystal Seed, don\u2019t look down at it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo was very moved. His nose became sore as he made a deep bow and said sincerely, \u201cBig Brother!\u201d</p><br/><p>Qing Lin held him up and had a happy expression. \u201cAfter muddling tens of thousands of years, I have no regrets in this life to encounter a brother again!\u201d He then said, \u201cThis drop of Greenvine Mystical Water was a harvest from an old vine that was ten thousand years old. If Brother can absorb it well, it will be of great benefit.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo could only nod dumbly. He suddenly took out a pile of treasures he usually treasured as though they were his life and said, \u201cBig Brother, take a look. If there is something useful, please take it!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, Brother has many good things,\u201d Qing Lin said with a smile as he flipped through. \u201cThis broken arrow is probably the weapon of the totem warrior from the Archer Tribe. This broken bell should be the greatest treasure of the Eastern Water Tribe and is called the Celestial Bell. This black rock is the Nether Ghost Core, the greatest treasure of the Nether Ghost Tribe. It is a pity that this brother can just barely recognize them and I do not know how to use them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is all things I picked up from the Sealed Extinction Battlefield. My friend said that is the place many warriors died,\u201d Zuo Mo said. These treasures had all been obtained when Zuo Mo had followed the strange corpse out of the Sealed Extinction Battlefield. They had gone through many places of death similar to the gold crystal sand sea. The strange corpse didn\u2019t have much interest in these objects and gave them all to Zuo Mo.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo that is the case!\u201d Qing Lin nodded. \u201cThe Sealed Extinction Battlefield, as expected of the Battle of Sealed Extinction! The grave of so many warriors \u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>With a long sigh, Qing Lin pushed the objects in front of Zuo Mo. \u201cThis brother accepts Brother\u2019s good intentions, but I will not be able to use these things. Brother, keep them on you and remember to not easily show them to others.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo instantly said, \u201cBig Brother, pick a few!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere really is no use.\u201d Qin Lin pushed the objects back in front of Zuo Mo and said, \u201cThis brother does have something to request.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Big Brother, say it!\u201d Zuo Mo said unhesitatingly.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf Brother has free time in the future, can you go to this place to look. There may be descendents of mine here. If they are lucky and are still alive, Brother, please help look after them for me.\u201d Qing Lin pointed again and Zuo Mo felt a jie map appear in his mind.</p><br/><p>\u201cSeas turn to mulberry fields, everything probably has changed. Shidi, do not deliberately go looking. If you encounter them, just giving them a helping hand and it is enough,\u201d Qing Lin said.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo problem!\u201d Zuo Mo nodded heavily. He decided inside that he would definitely go to this place to search.</p><br/><p>Qing Lin smiled slightly and reached out a hand. \u201cBrother, lend the Sun Crystal Seed to me for use.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo hurriedly gave the Sun Crystal Seed to Qing Lin\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>At this time, a bright green light suddenly came from Qing Lin\u2019s hand and wrapped around the Sun Crystal Seed, the other end of the light entangling around Zuo Mo!</p><br/><p>Translator Ramblings: More history, more plot development, and \u2026 \u2026 Isn\u2019t a feeling a great reason to want to kill someone?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

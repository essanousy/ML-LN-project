Ma Fan, Wei Ran, and the others stood in ordered ranks.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere hasn\u2019t been any action at East Flow Jie\u2019s chaos rift. Cloud Gate Jie\u2019s chaos rift leads to the yao territories, and Earth Universe Sect in Cloud Gate Jie is very powerful and possess six battalions. They control almost half of Cloud Gate Jie.\u201d Xie Shan\u2019s intelligence was very detailed as he steamed on. \u201cOur best target is Middle Granary Jie. It isn\u2019t just the closest to us, its largest local sect was defeated. They are in chaos. It has been confirmed that the attacks are a mo battalion. It is definitely the mo territories behind the chaos rift. Because there have not been any mo hostages, we are unsure at the moment which jie it is.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAs long as it leads to the mo territories, it is valuable to us.\u201d Gongsun Cha caused everyone to sit up in alertness.</p><br/><p>He stood up and slowly scanned the crowd. Everyone sat up straight.</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone should know what is going on with Shixiong.\u201d Gongsun Cha\u2019s tone was very calm but his ruffled bangs could not stop the light of his eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cOur goal is very simple, reinforce Shixiong! But if we enter any mo jie, we will create an endless struggle with the surrounding mo territories.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut we must reach into the mo territories so we can reinforce Shixiong.\u201d Gongsun Cha had clearly thought this through. His rationale was clear. \u201cWe can create our own mo battalion using Guard Camp and Shi Dong. These mo battalions can enter the mo territories and then reinforce Shixiong. We can even turn Cloud Sea Jie into a place where yao, mo and xiuzhe can coexist. This is hard, but not impossible.</p><br/><p>Everyone showed thoughtful expressions. After a few moments of thought, they nodded slightly and fighting spirit started to burn in their eyes.</p><br/><p>Lil\u2019 Miss smiled slightly. The bashful smile of the neighbor\u2019s boy appeared. The eyes behind the bangs grew even brighter. His calm tone was filled with an indescribable insanity. \u201cBut before this, we need to take over the chaos rift and the territory that can lead into the mo territories! We need more battalions! We need more resources! We need to become stronger!\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone\u2019s eyes flashed crazily. They felt as though their blood was burning.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you ready?\u201d</p><br/><p>The demonic slight smile and the furious fighting spirit crossed like light and dark on Gongsun Cha\u2019s raised face.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d Everyone stood up and shouted together.</p><br/><p>Gongsun Cha walked next to Middle Granary Jie on the mirage. He turned around, his bashful smile filled with cold fighting spirit.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe war has begun!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>Shi Dong\u2019s progress in Little Savage Jie was extremely quick. Right now, he had taken over all of Little Savage Jie. In the past, he had not been trusted but he had fame in Little Savage Jie. Everyone knew that Shi Dong was a very strong battle general.</p><br/><p>So when Shi Dong suddenly returned to fight, other than his former leader that called for his head, no other power said anything. In the mo territories, events like this happened everyday. For those noble families, there were things like glory and honor; but for these little factions, the strongest was king. Whomever had the biggest fist was the leader.</p><br/><p>Shi Dong faced off against his former boss. Before he could attack, the boss\u2019 subordinates mutinied. Everyone knew that Shi Dong had not to been fully trusted but the boss, but everyone also knew how strong Shi Dong was. Being former allies they also knew better than other people. To stay alive, they directly surrendered.</p><br/><p>After the great victory, Shi Dong dissolved the local battalions according to Lil\u2019 Miss\u2019 orders and selected the elite ones to replenish Grey Camp,</p><br/><p>In a short period of time, Grey Camp had expanded to three times its former size yet he had only picked the top quality mo troops.</p><br/><p>However, he also knew that it would take a certain amount of time for this reformed Grey Camp to be battle-ready.</p><br/><p>But with [Great Day Hardship Guard] he had enough confidence he could make Grey Camp into a top-rank battalion!</p><br/><p>However, he clearly underestimated Turtle Island\u2019s strength.</p><br/><p>He received Lil\u2019 Miss\u2019 orders for Grey Camp to send members in a rotation to go to Turtle Island and undergo special training.</p><br/><p>Special training?</p><br/><p>He was slightly puzzled. What kind of training was special training?</p><br/><p>However, these were orders and he knew what his duties were, instantly arranging it.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo did not know that there were countless eyes watching their journey.</p><br/><p>The name of Butcher Guard Camp intimidated small forces and attracted the attention of larger forces. Though they were not willing to provoke Guard Camp, it did not stop them from secretly investigating them.</p><br/><p>There had clearly been a fierce battle here. The market\u2019s ruins and the burnt black soil all pointed to this.</p><br/><p>Everyone\u2019s nerves were tight. They were not worried about encountering bandits, but were very worried about encountering large battalions, especially xiuzhe battalions.</p><br/><p>It was a dangerous matter for Shou Ping\u2019s group to fight against xiuzhe, enemies they were unfamiliar with.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo didn\u2019t want to encounter them either because his identity might be exposed. Even though Guard Camp didn\u2019t appear any different than mo after Wei\u2019s teachings, but those large sects were immeasurable in skill. If he was exposed, it definitely would not be fun.</p><br/><p>Those people that exterminated mo would exterminate them as well.</p><br/><p>Celestial Planet Guard and Guard Camp carefully kept their guard up. From the way they did this, it was possible to see the difference between the two groups. Every person in Celestial Planet Guard seemed to be anxious fearing they would face great enemies as they moved carefully. Everyone in Guard Camp had calm expressions. Only the light that occasionally flashed through their eyes exposed their wariness.</p><br/><p>The skill could be instantly judged!</p><br/><p>Shou Ping shook his head inside, and was deeply impacted. He quickly threw all stray throughout to the back of his mind. Everything in front of him was unusual.</p><br/><p>A black shadow suddenly flashed by and entered the ranks of Guard Camp.</p><br/><p>So fast!</p><br/><p>Shou Ping was shocked. The speed of this scout surpassed all people in Celestial Planet Guard.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are two groups fighting up head, both mo, the fighting is fierce.\u201d A Wen reported the situation that was occurring up ahead.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo\u2019s brow creased. This path was one they had to travel, they could not go around it.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go see.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>The troop moved silently and the intense battlefield quickly appeared in front of them.</p><br/><p>The sky was in chaotic. A small group of mo were surrounded by numerous mo that had dark green wings on their backs. These dark green mo were grouped together like packs of wolves that scattered and gathered, covering the sky, and howling.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey are Green Yaksha!\u201d Wei reminded Zuo Mo. \u201cThey are extremely fast and not weak offensively, innately cold-blooded and desirous of slaughter. They are most skilled in attrition battles, you have to be careful.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat weaknesses do they have?\u201d Zuo Mo asked. If Lil\u2019 Miss was here, he definitely would not ask this question. Lil\u2019 Miss seemed to know all the yaomo.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey like to fight, are easily angered, and their tempers are not well-regulated.\u201d Wei said rapidly, \u201cHowever, you need to be careful, while normal combat mo are not disciplined, it is easy for battle generals to come out of green yaksha. Those above silver are pretty good, and actually, snake mo also easily produces battle generals.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo\u2019s gaze quickly landed on a mo wearing a bright red cape on the battlefield. This person was well-built and extremely brave. He stood with empty hands at the front of the formation. Every time he attacked, it was a ball of fire. If the green yaksha that charged were not careful, they would be burnt into ash at a visible rate.</p><br/><p>The fatalities of the defending battalion was high. The reason they had not been defeated yet was mostly due to this large mo.</p><br/><p>\u201cDaren, they seem to be protecting someone,\u201d Ye Ling said in a low voice. He was experienced and instantly detected it.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo made a sound. He had also noticed this. There were only three hundred people left in this battalion but they were still resisting and protecting an old person.</p><br/><p>The fatality rate of the green yaksha was also high but they were in a frenzy, wave after wave battering against the other\u2019s battle formation.</p><br/><p>With every wave numerous corpses would drop from the sky, but fatalities would also occur in the other\u2019s battle formation.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo\u2019s expression changed. One side did not care about fatalities, the other side did not retreat a step. The battle was intense and fierce. He had heard Wei and Pu Yao say before that the mo were skilled in battle and that their battles were unusually cruel. Having seen it with his own eyes, it really was so. In comparison, the battles between xiuzhe troops were lacking.</p><br/><p>When Shou Ping saw the green yaksha, his expression changed.</p><br/><p>Especially when he counted that there were seven to eight hundred green yaksha flying in the air. The green yaksha were not rabble like bandits. Seven to eight hundred yaksha were enough to take down a city.</p><br/><p>Thinking about the ruins of the market they had walked past, Shou Ping\u2019s heart sank. Had it been these green yaksha that were responsible?</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t help but turn to look at Zuo Mo. He saw the other had an expression of ease without any visible panic. He felt embarrassed inside. He was a battle general but he hadn\u2019t seen battle yet; he wasn\u2019t comparable to this youth.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo\u2019s expression was calm but he was slightly panicked inside. He was not as freakish as Lil\u2019 Miss, but his judgement had been honed with practical experience and he was much stronger than average silver battle generals.</p><br/><p>The fighting most likely would not finish up in a short period of time.</p><br/><p>The large man\u2019s side had fewer people but they were resolved and there seemed to be someone directing them. Their defence was very strict. Other than charging at them, the green yaksha didn\u2019t seem to have a good solution.</p><br/><p>The battle probably would continue through to tomorrow night, Zuo Mo guessed inside.</p><br/><p>But what he did not want to encounter such a delay.</p><br/><p>The two sides fighting quickly noticed Zuo Mo\u2019s group.</p><br/><p>An old voice suddenly came from the formation behind the large man. \u201cWhich friend is this? This one is Tao Xing from Endless City, please, Friend, give this one a hand in aid. After this battle, this one will give heavy thanks!\u201d</p><br/><p>The other was asking for help, but he still maintained his mannerism and there was no panic in his tone.</p><br/><p>\u201cTao Xing!\u201d Shou Ping\u2019s pupils suddenly expanded as he exclaimed.</p><br/><p>Translator Ramblings: Transportation formations, yao trees, blood pools \u2026 \u2026 I think that the trees are the most environmental friendly.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

I got really sick of typing \u201cmanipulate water like fire.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chapter Fifty Four Fire</p><br/><p>\u201cOne grade lingdan, contains a small amount of essence of the sun, effects warm, suited for long term consumption, a certain possibility of forming Golden Crow Fire. Those who consume it can become excited in the short term and can be used for emergencies.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Li Ying Feng received this appraisal, she was shocked. There wasn\u2019t much about the other effects, but she was shocked still by \u201ca certain possibility of forming Golden Crow Fire.\u201d After the appraisal, there was also an order form. The Medicine Institute was hoping to buy one hundred pills, price able to be discussed. The Medicine Institute also suggested changing the same to \u201cGolden Crow Pill.\u201d</p><br/><p>Clearly, everyone hated the bumpkin name that was Great Strength Pill.</p><br/><p>Immediately, Li Ying Feng gave the appraisal to her Master.</p><br/><p>Seeing the three words \u201cGolden Crow Fire\u201d, Yan Le was shocked still. He took the appraisal, throwing down a : \u201cI\u2019m going out,\u201d before flying into the sky, heading straight for Wu Kong Mountain.</p><br/><p>In Wu Kong Hall, all four elders of the Wu Kong Sword Sect were present.</p><br/><p>Pei Yan Ran looked at the appraisal on his hand and had a serious expression. He said in a deep voice: \u201cGolden Crow Fire, this is a fourth grade fire seed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xin Yan nodded: \u201cExactly, my Green Mulberry Fire, Shimei\u2019s Violet Flora Fire, they are all fourth grade. I had heard of this Golden Crow Fire before, it comes from the sun, extremely yang, extremely strong. It cannot be merged. In the fourth grade, it is a rare fine fire source.\u201d</p><br/><p>Pei Yuan Ran smiled at Shi Feng Rong: \u201cShimei is really great. Zuo Mo had just studied with you and could make such a good thing as this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shi Feng Rong had a cold face: \u201cThis has nothing to do with me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Pei Yuan Ran smiled, not minding. He lowered his head to think. The other people were also silent. Golden Crow Fire, fourth grade fire source. This caused this little dan\u2019s price to fly into the sky.</p><br/><p>\u201cShixiong.\u201d Yan Le couldn\u2019t resist stating: \u201cIf it can form Golden Crow Fire, then its use for the sect would be gigantic. Doesn\u2019t Xu Yi still lack a good fire seed? And Zuo Mo himself, if he\u2019s learning dan-making, how can he not have a fire seed?\u201d</p><br/><p>What he was implying was that he wasn\u2019t very willing to sell it.</p><br/><p>Pei Yuan Ran raised his head, responding: \u201cI understand what you mean. That child, Xu Yi, I like him as well. And the forging branch of this sect would likely be passed on through him. He really does need Golden Crow Fire. But we still have to sell some. Right now, the outside probably has heard the news about this dan. If we don\u2019t sell any, it would enrage the public. That would only harm the sect without any benefit.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen Shixiong means\u2026\u2026\u201d Yan Le was hesitant.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust sell a small portion, we\u2019ll use the majority ourselves.\u201d Pei Yuan Ran gave a slight smile: \u201cWe\u2019ll give the market price to Zuo Mo, not one piece less.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMarket price?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. Paper cannot hide fire. There are only just that many people in our Wu Kong Sword Sect that can make dan. There\u2019s no need to cause Zuo Mo to hate us in secret because of a few pieces of jingshi.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cZuo Mo\u2019s past is unclear. There may be trouble in the future.\u201d Shi Feng Rong who had kept her cold face suddenly opened.</p><br/><p>Wu Kong Hall became silent.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo\u2019s identity and origins was a question that everyone had been having a headache about. Before, Zuo Mo had only been an outer sect disciple. His origin hadn\u2019t been a big problem. But right now, he wasn\u2019t just an inner sect disciple. Based on the direction, he would certainly become one of the core members of the next generation of Wu Kong Sword Sect. His identity and origins became a problem that Pei Yuan Ran and the others had to face.</p><br/><p>\u201cHis origins might not be a problem\u2026\u2026\u201d Yan Le said unconfidently.</p><br/><p>Pei Yuan Ran waved his hand: \u201cSince we don\u2019t know anything, then don\u2019t think too much about it. Regardless, just the fact that he is a ling plant farmer, that\u2019s enough that we cannot give him up. Even more, there\u2019s now this lingdan that could make Golden Crow Fire.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing this, everyone didn\u2019t speak anymore. They all knew that sect leader Shixiong was right. If they suddenly expelled Zuo Mo right now out of the sect, it would be what countless people wanted.</p><br/><p>Xin Yan suddenly asked: \u201cCan Shimei make this kind of dan?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know [Art of Crimson Flame].\u201d Shi Feng Rong said coolly: \u201cThis dan needs to use [Art of Crimson Flame].\u201d</p><br/><p>Manipulate water like fire. It was easy to say, but for a ling plant farmer, it was very difficult, especially when it was in a sword scripture.</p><br/><p>There were, in total, seven moves in [Li Water Sword Scripture]. Manipulate water like fire was the core but it was too far right now for Zuo Mo. What he needed to do was familiarize himself with the sword moves. Each move would always have a few dozens of transformations. And each transformation needed to be controlled by ling energy. Even more, the entire process had to be completed in a thought.</p><br/><p>Based on the complexity of ling energy manipulation, these sword moves weren\u2019t as complex as [Little Art of Cloud and Rain], but they needed to be finished in a very short amount of time so the difficulty actually increased. When making the move, the attention needed to be focused. That was even truer during battle. The other usually wouldn\u2019t give you the chance to think. You needed to instinctively finish the complete move.</p><br/><p>This was also why sword cultivators liked pure things. The purer something was, the less the disturbance it had.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo finally could use that ice crystal sword. It was certainly a painful thing to look at a good item yet be unable to use it.</p><br/><p>The ice crystal sword turned into a flashing white light as it flew around Zuo Mo, coldness seeping out. It was silent, yet it gave the feeling of being able to explode.</p><br/><p>[Li Water Sword Scripture] wasn\u2019t a sword scripture that used sword moves to win. It only had seven sword moves and they were relatively simple. As he practiced, Zuo Mo increasingly felt that the person who created this sword scripture probably was a ling plant farmer. Many of the ways that the ling energy moved in the scripture was similar to the five element spells of a ling plant farmer.</p><br/><p>Receiving the benefit of that, Zuo Mo quickly familiarized himself with the sword moves.</p><br/><p>But familiarity was familiarity, so when he moved, there was still a feeling of rawness. Even Zuo Mo could see that his sword moves only had the appearance but not the substance of the move. But he had no solution for that. He might have comprehended a bit of sword essence but he didn\u2019t know at all how to merge sword essence with sword moves.</p><br/><p>Right now, he was just swallowing it all and hoping to digest some. The manipulation of water like fire that Pu Yao had said, Zuo Mo couldn\u2019t make heads or tails of it. According to Pu Yao, the power of this [Li Water Sword Scripture] wasn\u2019t strong originally. If he couldn\u2019t manipulate water like fire, this sword scripture didn\u2019t have any value.</p><br/><p>Manipulate water like fire!</p><br/><p>Damn it, how could he manipulate water like fire?</p><br/><p>His fundamentals were really too weak despite that he had touched the door to sword essence. Wei Sheng was obsessed with the sword, the number of sword scriptures and research that he had encountered couldn\u2019t be counted. Even though it wasn\u2019t anything high quality, but he had already killed and with his wealthy battle experience, his fundamentals were extremely deep and no average sect disciple could compare. And inner sect disciples like Luo Li, they were taught from little by their Master, they could read everything in the records. In comparison, their fundamentals were much thicker than Zuo Mo.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo, he barely managed to get a Master, but she only taught him dan-making. When he had been lianqi, he had only roughly studied those basic sword scriptures that Wei Sheng had given him. He truly had a weak base.</p><br/><p>Pu Yao had lectured for two hours but it was all theoretical guidance, none of it practical.</p><br/><p>But the time Zuo Mo had was only three months, how could he not be panicked?</p><br/><p>Inside, he cursed the adulterous couple of Luo Li and Hao Min countless times. Zuo Mo tried to remain calm. He had practiced [Little Art of Cloud and Rain] to the fourth level, but had never found anything that connected it to fire.</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t panic, don\u2019t panic\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Closing his eyes, Zuo Mo recited to himself over and over.</p><br/><p>When he opened his eyes again, his gaze had recovered its clarity, but deeply hidden was a touch of stubbornness.</p><br/><p>Pu Yao said, wasn\u2019t it just sword essence? Sliced a few thousand times, naturally you will learn.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo said to himself, wasn\u2019t it just a sword scripture? Ge will slice it ten thousand times, if it fails, then a few dozen more, don\u2019t believe it won\u2019t work! If it doesn\u2019t, then slice one million times! Slice until it works!</p><br/><p>Having decided, Zuo Mo wasn\u2019t panicked anymore and raised up his sword.</p><br/><p>I slice!</p><br/><p>Little West Wind Yard, the sword energy flew, coldness spread!</p><br/><p>A storefront on the West Street of Dong Fu, many people had already gathered. These people gathered together and chattered and argued.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy hasn\u2019t it opened yet? I\u2019ve already waited an entire night.\u201d Someone grouched.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s a night? I\u2019ve been guarding for two days and nights.\u201d A person on the side followed up.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs this store going to open? Are they playing with us?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat can we do? It\u2019s their dan, if they want to sell, they sell, if they don\u2019t, you don\u2019t have a choice.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true. Do you really think that Golden Crow Pill can really form Golden Crow Fire?\u201d Someone couldn\u2019t resist asking: \u201cFourth grade Golden Crow Fire, does anyone in Dong Fu have it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t heard that anyone had it. But it was an appraisal from the Medicine Institute so it shouldn\u2019t be far off. Nothing else, essence of the sun, it would be beneficial if it\u2019s added to a fire source.\u201d The person who spoke was brawny and tall with a square face and large ears. He sighed: \u201cThe kind of thing that is fire seed, especially good fire source, is it something people like us can buy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBro, what do you do?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMe?\u201d The square faced man said: \u201cI make food.\u201d</p><br/><p>At this time, an old man suddenly greeted him: \u201cHey, Master Shao, you came too!\u201d</p><br/><p>The crowd suddenly stirred. The person who had been speaking with the square faced man instantly had a very interesting expression. No one would have thought that this large and brawny man was actually the best ling food chef in Dong Fu. The Food Pavilion of Master Shao, it was the most famous ling food restaurant in Dong Fu. He was especially skilled at making marvelous combinations of all kinds of ling food. The ling food he made, it didn\u2019t only increased cultivation but the flavor was incomparable. Just ling grains, he could make over thirty six dishes.</p><br/><p>The square faced man raised his hands: \u201cShopkeeper Wang, are you also here for the golden crow pill?\u201d</p><br/><p>The crowd stirred again. Some people had already guessed the old man\u2019s origins. Master Shao\u2019s Food Pavilion, Wang Sou Wine. The food pavilion sold all kinds of ling food, and Old Man Wang was skilled at fermenting all kinds of ling wine.</p><br/><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d The person was a thin old man, his spine slightly bent but his beady eyes were extremely bright. His expression was slightly helpless: \u201cI\u2019m here for my precious granddaughter.\u201d</p><br/><p>Master Shao chucked: \u201cWhat\u2019s the little girl learning?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cForging.\u201d Old Man Wang was clearly unsatisfied with his granddaughter choosing to learn forging. He couldn\u2019t help complaining; \u201cMy son learnt dan-making, my granddaughter learns forging. My handicraft, it seems I\u2019m taking it into the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t panic, don\u2019t panic. If you ask for disciples, there would be countless people trying to get in.\u201d Master Shao hurriedly comforted.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh!\u201d Evidently having thought of something, Old Man Wang sighed. He looked at the surroundings. Seeing that more and more people were coming, his brow furrowed: \u201cThis Wu Kong Sword Sect looks like it\u2019s going to rise.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEn\u201d Master Shao agreed: \u201cBut they do have the ability.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>At this time, the tightly closed store door suddenly opened.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

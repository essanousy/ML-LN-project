It would be nice in real life if wages grew this quickly.</p><br/><p>Thanks to warlord212 for editing!</p><br/><p>Chapter Forty Aid</p><br/><p>On top of the mat inside the stone room, Zuo Mo serenely mediated, motionless.</p><br/><p>Through the twenty fourth point of the governing, the seventeenth point of the conception and the first point of the kidney vessels, thick ling energy entered his body. It especially entered from the governing vessel point. When the ling energy entered, it had a slightly cool feeling, extremely pleasant. After Zuo Mo had completed one breath, his breathing through the mouth and nose was much less important. Right now, he had only opened three points. If he could reach ten breaths, not only just all three hundred and sixty one points would be opened, all the pores in his body would be unblocked and he would breathe with the world.</p><br/><p>Of course, for him at the moment, that was very far away. His consciousness had increased, but up until now, he hadn\u2019t found any uses for spiritual power. What he needed now was ling energy, continuous accumulating ling energy in hopes of entering zhuji soon.</p><br/><p>When he woke up from the mediation, Zuo Mo\u2019s breath shot out like an arrow.</p><br/><p>How was Shixiong doing in the Sword Cave, the thought popped suddenly into Zuo Mo\u2019s mind.</p><br/><p>In reality, he was very envious about the road that Shixiong had picked. It only needed to pay attention to one matter. However, he was clear enough to realize that Shixiong\u2019s road wasn\u2019t suited for him. So he might be envious, but he would keep doing what he needed to do. He always felt that he didn\u2019t have too much talent in the area of the sword. If it wasn\u2019t for Pu Yao\u2019s existence, not just getting a sword essence, but it was impossible to do what Shixiong was doing.</p><br/><p>His talents laid in the five elements.</p><br/><p>Other than [Art of Aged Gold] which had been helped by Pu Yao, he had learned the other four spells on his own. So he was more enthusiastic about five elements spells. Sometimes he would think, had he once been a roaming xiu before?</p><br/><p>Only roaming xiu liked five elements spells.</p><br/><p>However, even if he had been a roaming xiu, he must have been a silent and unknown xiu living in the lowest classes.</p><br/><p>But if that was the case, why was his appearance changed and mind erased? He unconsciously tightened his fist.</p><br/><p>Carefully retreating out of the stone cavern, he walked to the opening. The sunlight outside made his eyes squint. The warm sunlight made Zuo Mo\u2019s mood unintentionally better. Walking to the ling fields and seeing the vigorous ling herbs, his mood became even better. A ling plant farmer was the profession that was the easiest at showing the relationship between work and result. When you paid in effort and worked hard, the joy at the bountiful harvest made life seem full of hope. Even Old Black, who had a harsh life, smiled when it was harvest time .</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo calculated the time in his mind. The new cycle of ling grains should be starting soon. His previous yard had been yielded to Old Black. Old Black had been yearning for that five mu of ling fields for a long time. If it hadn\u2019t been for Old Black, he wouldn\u2019t have been introduced to Wei Sheng Shixiong. With that connection there, his friendship with Old Black was naturally different.</p><br/><p>With nothing to do, Zuo Mo thought to go see him. However, he didn\u2019t find anyone at the yard. Zuo Mo guess that Old Black had gone to the ling fields and headed to the fields. As expected, he found Old Black in the fields. Also there was Guo Lu. However, the former Guo Lu Shixiong was now the present Guo Lu Shidi. That made him slightly unaccustomed. No matter the age or cultivation, outer sect disciples had to call inner sect disciples shixiong or shijie. This was the same in every sect.</p><br/><p>Old Black saw Zuo Mo and made a happy expression: \u201cLittle Mo Ge.\u201d</p><br/><p>It seemed that Guo Lu\u2019s illness had healed. He wasn\u2019t familiar with Zuo Mo and reservedly gave a bow: \u201cZuo Shixiong.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo felt extremely awkward being called shixiong by two people whose ages far surpassed him. Thankfully, his face was frozen and nothing could be detected.</p><br/><p>\u201cOld Black\u2019s ling grains are really well grown.\u201d Zuo Mo scanned the ling fields and couldn\u2019t resist praising it. He calmly started a spell, instantly a ball of clouds floated over and the silver strands poured down continuously. Old Black instantly revealed a happy expression. Admiration appeared on Guo Lu\u2019s face. The fourth level of [Little Art of Cloud and Rain], people rarely reached it.</p><br/><p>Guo Lu had been recovering on the sickbed in the previous months but the big events that happened in the sect, he had heard them from Old Black.</p><br/><p>In one year, three outer sect disciples became inner sect disciples. The sect had never been so flourishing. All the outer sect disciples were greatly encouraged and many of them became even more hard working.</p><br/><p>Guo Lu attentively examined this young shixiong. Little Zuo Mo Shixiong was the inner sect disciple with the lowest cultivation in the sect, a lianqi disciple that hadn\u2019t entered zhuji! But the genius of the little shixiong had passed on. To be able to receive a spring sprout jade medal in lianqi, Guo Lu had never heard of it.</p><br/><p>His best was [Art of Aged Gold]. He had work hard these years but never could breakthrough to the third level. Looking at the little shixiong who had already become a ling plant farmer, his heart couldn\u2019t help moving.</p><br/><p>Thinking about it, he couldn\u2019t help but be envious of Old Black. No matter if it was Wei Sheng Shixiong, or Zuo Mo shixiong, they all had good relationships with Old Black. The waters rose and the boat became high, Old Black was now extremely popular in the outer sect disciples. But Old Black was very down to earth and still planted his ling grains. Because Guo Lu had been wounded last time when he had helped Old Black, and Old Black had taken care of him in the recovery, the two had a great relationship.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is two mud turning earthworms. It doesn\u2019t have a great use, but it is useful in plowing fields.\u201d Zuo Mo handed both of them each a small bamboo tube. Sealed inside each tube was a mud turning earthworm. He hadn\u2019t thought that Guo Lu would be present but he had enough mud turning earthworms.</p><br/><p>The two hurriedly gave their thanks.</p><br/><p>Guo Lu saw Zuo Mo moving to leave and after struggling and hesitating for a second, he couldn\u2019t resist speaking and at the very end: \u201cLittle Shixiong, my [Art of Aged Gold] has been stuck at the second level. Please, shixiong, give some advise. Guo Luo would be deeply grateful.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo was astounded but still stopped in his footsteps. He was respectful of this old farmer-like shixiong who had stood up last time. Right now, his income didn\u2019t depend on things like making rain so the two naturally didn\u2019t have any conflicts in interest. Quite the opposite. If Guo Lu could break into the third level of [Art of Aged Gold], he could take on much of the pest problems in the sect for him.</p><br/><p>Thinking through all the possibilities, he decided to help Guo Lu: \u201cKilling worms is still killing. Gold\u2019s main purpose is to kill. This [Art of Aged Gold] belongs to the path of killing. How to kill? There are countless ways in this area. Adding on aged gold energy can transform in many ways, if other methods of killing could be added in, the matter is half solved already.\u201d</p><br/><p>Guo Lu listened attentively, afraid of losing even a word. When Zuo Mo finished, he was pinned to his spot, face deep in thought.</p><br/><p>Seeing the situation, Zuo Mo floated away.</p><br/><p>Leaving behind the ling fields, he headed for the Eastern Peak. The recent changes made him felt that it was a different lifetime. The female disciples of the Eastern Peak had meant to rely on him, but who would have thought he would become an inner sect disciple. Usually, he wouldn\u2019t be able to care for them anymore. But since he received benefits from them, that the black gold worm had been their present, Zuo Mo decided to help them.</p><br/><p>When Xiao Guo saw Zuo Mo, a surprised expression came onto her round apple face. She timidly said: \u201cShixiong!\u201d</p><br/><p>The gold horned copper cow was still leisurely eating ling grass, not paying any attention to Zuo Mo.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo felt slightly helpless towards this little girl, especially the always timid expression on her face.</p><br/><p>Last time when he had fainted, the little girl had been afraid but still persisted in protecting him. When he had heard of this from the others, he was very moved and felt that he owed her a favour.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Unhappy to see me?\u201d Zuo Mo decided to tease the little girl. His face didn\u2019t have any expression in the first place. Adding on a slightly stern tone, it was quite frightening.</p><br/><p>Xiao Guo instantly was frightened, her small head furiously shaking, mist rising in her large yes, her mouth hurriedly explaining: \u201cNo, no\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo instantly realized if he continued, she would really cry. He instantly regretted his action.</p><br/><p>Wasn\u2019t this making trouble for himself?</p><br/><p>He hurriedly relaxed his tone: \u201cAlright. Coming this time, there\u2019s something to give to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>The mist in Xiao Guo\u2019s eyes instantly stopped. She looked in puzzlement at Zuo Mo and asked timidly: \u201cWhat thing? Shixiong.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is some sword scriptures, you take it and practise and can pass it on to your other shijie and shimei.\u201d He handed two jade sticks over to the little girl. One of the sticks stored some basic sword moves that he had picked out from the jade stick that Wei Sheng shixiong had given him. At the same time, he took off the gold sword ring from his hand and handed that as well to her: \u201cThis is gold sword ring. It can store three sword energies. But you first need to learn a gold spell. En, one of the jade sticks has five elements spells inside. After practising the [Art of Aged Gold] for a while, you can use this talisman.\u201d</p><br/><p>After explaining all this, Zuo Mo released a breath. This muddle headed little girl always made his head hurt.</p><br/><p>The gold sword ring was not of great use to him now. And he had decided that before zhuji, he definitely wouldn\u2019t leave the mountain. After zhuji, if Master didn\u2019t give a flying sword, he could use Ice Crystal Sword. The power would be much greater than gold sword ring. And that jade stick that contained the five elements spells wasn\u2019t useful for him anymore. He hadn\u2019t thought of given Xiao Guo that jade stick at first, but if she didn\u2019t cultivate a gold attributed spell, it wasn\u2019t possible to use the gold sword ring. As though the simple sword moves in Wei Sheng shixiong\u2019s jade stick. They were simple but useful. For lianqi disciples, they were a pretty good method of protection.</p><br/><p>Female disciples, especially weaker outer sect female disciples, their circumstances would be harder than male disciples.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo could not spare the attention to take care of them like before, and decided to pass these things onto them. In this case, if they met some xiuzhe who wasn\u2019t too powerful, it wasn\u2019t as though they couldn\u2019t even counterattack. If they met a strong one, he had no solution neither.</p><br/><p>Luckily, the Dong Qi Sword Sect disciple from last time had been expelled from Dong Fu. He didn\u2019t need to worry about encountering that guy nearby.</p><br/><p>After handing over everything, Zuo Mo flipped up and landed onto the grey beaked goose\u2019s back, he waved his hand at Xiao Guo without turning his head back and floated off.</p><br/><p>Looking at the disappearing Zuo Mo, Xiao Guo\u2019s hands as they held the gold sword ring and the jade sticks unconsciously tightened.</p><br/><p>Finishing all this, Zuo Mo felt that his body was much more relaxed and headed straight for Fragrant Ginger Yard. He still needed to present five fasting pills at the end of the month. He didn\u2019t dare to offend his cold-faced master. If he didn\u2019t complete it, he would certain receive punishment.</p><br/><p>Entering the dan room, he didn\u2019t start moving immediately. The materials were limited. If he really ruined all of the materials, in his penniless state, there was no place for him to buy more.</p><br/><p>In theory, with his present cultivation, making fasting pills shouldn\u2019t be hard. It really was the most basic dan.</p><br/><p>Thinking for a long time, he felt that last time it was that he hadn\u2019t controlled the input of ling energy properly and wasted a lot of ling energy, causing his ling energy to not be enough.</p><br/><p>After thinking for a long time repeatedly and entering mediation, he let the ling energy recover to the best state.</p><br/><p>Then he started his second try.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

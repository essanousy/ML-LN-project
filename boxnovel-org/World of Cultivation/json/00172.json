They liked being in busy places, and right now, what place in Sky Moon Jie was more busy than Dong Fu?</p><br/><p>Hu Shan rubbed his hands, and said with an excited expression, \u201cExcellent. I\u2019ve waited for so long. The stupid preliminary Sword Test Conference finally finished! Only the true competition is worth seeing!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tao Zhu Er\u2019s eyes were dazed, \u201cYes. Gu Rong Ping is too handsome! I think, in Sky Moon Jie, there isn\u2019t a man more outstanding than him! I really like him!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hu Shan stared at Tao Zhu Er inside for being a fangirl. He suddenly noticed that Yan Ming Zi seemed unfocused.</p><br/><p>\u201cOld Yan, what are you thinking about?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Ming Zi raised his head and focused. He gave a grimace. \u201cI\u2019m thinking about making jingshi!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaking jingshi? You\u2019re lacking for jingshi right now? I\u2019ve got some right now. Do you want some?\u201d Hu Shan said forthrightly. The three, because they had the same battle experience, became close friends.</p><br/><p>Yan Ming Zi shook his head, \u201cJust bought a new flying sword. I\u2019ve nearly spent all my jingshi. No rush, I can slowly make more. I\u2019ll find you if I really can\u2019t find a way.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, you bought a new flying sword? Quick, let us see,\u201d said Tao Zhu Er, as she was instantly interested in the new sword.</p><br/><p>Yan Ming Zi took out a dark blue flying sword, \u201cThe Sword\u2019s name is [Deep Ocean], it\u2019s third-grade.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hu Shan looked and then shook his head. \u201cIt can\u2019t compare to your previous Water Drop sword.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just wasting words!\u201d Yan Ming Zi rolled his eyes in exasperation. Hu Shan\u2019s words stirred up the three\u2019s hurt.</p><br/><p>Seeing the situation, Tao Zhu Er quickly changed the topic, \u201cSo what way did you think of making jingshi?\u201d Of the three, Yan Ming Zi was of average power but the best at business.</p><br/><p>As expected, this question was Yan Ming Zi\u2019s true love. He came the focus of attention, \u201cOf course, it is the Sword Test Conference!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSword Test Conference? How do you make jingshi from that?\u201d Hu Shan asked strangely.</p><br/><p>Yan Ming Zi patiently explained, \u201cWe can\u2019t meddle in other business, but if we have spare money, and make a small bet, it wouldn\u2019t be bad.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hu Shan instantly became disinterested, and said scornfully, \u201cYou mean gambling, that\u2019s not interesting.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tao Zhu Er was actually interested. \u201cOld Yan, don\u2019t pay attention to him. Tell me more.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Ming Zi became even more excited. \u201cGambling naturally is not anything good. But the Sword Test Conference is different from other gambling.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow so?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere might be luck in this Sword Test Conference, but the true determinant is power. There are patterns that can be found in this. A person\u2019s strength, in a short period of time, wouldn\u2019t change very much. Considering the conflict between different spells, the quality of the talismans, even though it is impossible to accurately decide the result of the match, but one can determine the general direction.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hu Shan laughed, \u201cThen how will you know other people\u2019s strength? And their talismans?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Ming Zi nodded, \u201cThis is the crux of the problem. It is very hard to determine power, but the non-local competitors have already fought a few times, and general guesses can be made. As to talismans,\u201d he said proudly, \u201cin this area, I have some experience.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true. Old Yan, you\u2019re always good at picking talismans,\u201d said Hu Shan. He admired Yan Ming Zi very much on this skill.</p><br/><p>\u201cHue hue,\u201d Yan Ming Zi said smugly, \u201cthere are many kinds of wagers. Like the first match that\u2019s been spread around so much, Zuo Mo versus Chao An.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s there to gamble there? Of course Chao An wins!\u201d Hu Shan said unconcernedly, \u201cThe Scalping Zombie might be strong, but his cultivation is just that. He definitely cannot win over ningmai experts!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExactly!\u201d Yan Ming Zi agreed, but his direction changed, \u201cBut right now, what\u2019s spread the most is this wager. Everyone is betting how many moves that Zuo Mo can take from Chao An.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis bet works?\u201d Hu Shan gaped.</p><br/><p>\u201cHa, the odds for three moves and under are pretty normal. After three moves, the odds explode,\u201d Yan Ming Zi said.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you bet?\u201d Hu Shan asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, I put down for seven moves,\u201d Yan Ming Zi said smugly, \u201cthe odds are one to sixteen.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou feel he can endure seven of Chao An\u2019s moves?\u201d Hu Shan\u2019s face was full of shock, \u201cChao An isn\u2019t some little character. He\u2019s the strongest disciple of Fort Chao. You have too much confidence in the Scalping Zombie!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Ming Zi said in a deep voice, \u201cHow do you think Chao An compares to Chang Heng Shixiong?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNaturally he cannot compare!\u201d Hu Shan didn\u2019t need to think before saying unhesitatingly, \u201cChang Heng Shixiong is very strong! Before, when he was in zhuji, he had defeated people in ningmai.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh!\u201d Yan Ming Zi was slightly shocked at the last part, \u201cHow come I didn\u2019t know this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hu Shan unconsciously lowered his voice, \u201cNot many people know this. Shixiong\u2019s Blood Spider sword was obtained by killing someone! That\u2019s why he was punished by the sect leader.\u201d</p><br/><p>The other two instantly felt fearful shock.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems my jingshi won\u2019t be wasted,\u201d Yan Ming spoke. The first thing Yan Ming Zi thought about was his jingshi. He smiled and said, \u201cOriginally, the betting shouldn\u2019t be this popular. However, Chao An was confronted with a wager. The other wagered a bottle of Dying Flowing Moon for Zuo Mo to make it through ten moves. That was what stirred everything up.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDying Flowing Moon\u2026 \u2026,\u201d Hu Shan\u2019s expression was dazed as he muttered, \u201cThat\u2019s such a waste\u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Tao Zhu Er, who hadn\u2019t spoke, suddenly asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s the odds for Zuo Mo to win?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Ming Zi jerked. \u201cAbout one to three hundred,\u201d He looked in shock at Tao Zhu Er. \u201cYou want to bet he\u2019ll win? That\u2019s not possible!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Tao Zhu Er said unconcernedly, \u201cIn any case, I\u2019ll just wager a few jingshi. It will be an amusement. If Chang Heng Shixiong was in zhuji and could be defeated\u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Her words suddenly stopped, her eyes were focused. The other two people saw she didn\u2019t continue and found it strange. When they saw her frozen expression and dazed eyes, they couldn\u2019t help but follow her gaze. Then the two also froze.</p><br/><p>A person was walking towards them.</p><br/><p>Li Ying Feng looked at her shidi who was in the yard and shook her head. It hadn\u2019t been anything important when Shidi had been arranged to fight first. She had felt that the sect leader had wanted Zuo Mo to gain some experience. But the bet about how long Zuo Mo could stay in the fight had suddenly spread everywhere.</p><br/><p>A person of unknown origins had publicly threw out a bottle of Dying Flowing Moon, wagering that Shidi could make it through ten of Chao An\u2019s moves. It instantly caused a furor. Originally, no one had been interested in the match. But now, this match had become the most talked out and attractive match.</p><br/><p>Wasn\u2019t that putting Shidi onto a fire to roast?</p><br/><p>Shidi had shut himself in the yard the past few days, and was working on something she didn\u2019t know. She was extremely worried. Shidi should be practicing the sword some more, honing himself before the fight, even if it wasn\u2019t effective, at least it would look good!</p><br/><p>In the time that Shidi had stayed at the store, she had never seen him practice the sword.</p><br/><p>Did he think he could win with those useless low grade formations? She naturally was not opposed to Shidi studying formations, but formations were more likely used in dan-making and forging. They were not very effective in fighting.</p><br/><p>At this time, he shouldn\u2019t be working on formations!</p><br/><p>Wei Sheng travelled on the Splitting Rainbow as he landed in Dong Fu. He had gone back to Wu Kong Mountain and reported to the sect leader about the white-clothed male before rushing towards Dong Fu. Zuo Mo was in the first match. If he came late, he would miss Shidi\u2019s match.</p><br/><p>As he entered Dong Fu, the bustling crowds on the street was a small surprise to Wei Sheng.</p><br/><p>Differing from Zuo Mo, Wei Sheng was full of interest towards the Sword Test Conference. A chance to spar with different kinds of experts, it was really rare. Just thinking about it, he felt his blood boil, and his desire for battle rise.</p><br/><p>He suddenly thought of Zuo Mo and couldn\u2019t help but smile. With Shidi\u2019s lazy personality, he definitely wouldn\u2019t be interested in the Sword Test Conference. When he thought about Shidi\u2019s unwillingness to compete, and his helplessness against the sect leader\u2019s order, he felt it was extremely humorous.</p><br/><p>Shidi was very talented. It was a pity he was not interested in the sword. If this time, it could force him, it wouldn\u2019t be a bad thing.</p><br/><p>Wei Sheng was an exceptionally pure sword xiu. When Zuo Mo had been focusing on ling farming in the beginning, he hadn\u2019t felt anything. But when Zuo Mo\u2019s talent in cultivating the sword was revealed, but he was obsessed with other things, Wei Sheng felt it was a great pity.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, he heard words from the surroundings.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow many moves did you bet?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThree moves. Zhuji against ningmai. If he could make it through three, it will be the max.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know what Wu Kong Sword Sect was thinking, sending a little zhuji guy to embarrass themselves.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. I heard his main focus is dan-making. He shouldn\u2019t be coming here!\u201d</p><br/><p>A person argued, \u201cIt\u2019s not certain he\u2019ll embarrass himself. Dying Flowing Moon, who has it? A person that has Dying Flowing Moon, would they not have good eyes? From what I see, this Zuo Mo definitely has real skill!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReal skill? Ha! Even if he has skill, he\u2019s only in zhuji!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026 \u2026</p><br/><p>Wei Sheng\u2019s expression became very ugly. He barely suppressed the impulse to beat up those people.</p><br/><p>Along the way, he heard many similar discussions.</p><br/><p>He strode to the doorway of a casino.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, Mister, do you want to try out your luck? Dong Fu\u2019s hottest betting match, wagering how many moves, extremely interesting\u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Sheng prepared to speak when a voice came from behind him.</p><br/><p>\u201cTake out all the jingshi you have right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Robbery? Wei Sheng paused and couldn\u2019t help but turn around.</p><br/><p>The person speaking was a round faced man. There were two males and one female standing in front of him. The three of them seemed extremely frightened of the round-faced man, seem to be very timid in front of him. When the round-face man spoke, the three hurriedly took out all the jingshi they had.</p><br/><p>\u201cWager Zuo Mo wins,\u201d The round-faced man said briskly.</p><br/><p>Yan Ming Zi couldn\u2019t resist, \u201cChang Shixiong, this Zuo Mo\u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEn?\u201d The round-faced man glanced at Yan Ming Zi. Yan Ming Zi\u2019s heart jumped and the words that reached his mouth shrunk back. Hu Shan and Tao Zhu er were docilely standing with their heads down at the side. The two of them were cursing Yan Ming Zi inside.</p><br/><p>Old Yan, you dumbass. You don\u2019t want to live, but don\u2019t pull us along\u2026 \u2026</p><br/><p>Wei Sheng looked with slight surprise at the round-faced man. This was the first he had heard that someone was betting Shidi would win. He noticed the clothing of the three people behind the round-faced man had the symbol of Ling Ying Sect. Didn\u2019t Ling Ying Sect have a grudge against Shidi?</p><br/><p>Chang Shixiong\u2026 \u2026 Wei Sheng seemed to understand.</p><br/><p>The worker that was guarding the door looked at the four like he was looking at idiots. Seeing the jingshi in Yan Ming Zi\u2019s hands, he couldn\u2019t help but drool. He cursed inside. This group was really wastrels. If they had that much jingshi, give it to him, don\u2019t throw it in the water!</p><br/><p>Of course, none of it showed on his face. He praised, \u201cSire\u2019s eyes are very unique!\u201d But he still hesitated, \u201cAll on Zuo Mo winning?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBet,\u201d The round-faced man said.</p><br/><p>Taking the receipt, the round-faced male turned and left. Yan Ming Zi and the others exchanged a look and could only dispiritedly follow behind.</p><br/><p>\u201cReally wastrels!\u201d Once the round-faced man left, the worker of the casino seemed to have opened a flood, continuously talking to Wei Sheng, \u201cJust look. Aren\u2019t those people mental? From the time the betting started, no one has bet on Zuo Mo winning! They just aren\u2019t thinking of jingshi as jingshi. What do you say, a zhuji defeating a ningmai, is there anything as hilarious as this? Wastrels, really terrible wastrels\u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He shook his head, saliva flying.</p><br/><p>\u201cFifty pieces of third-grade jingshi.\u201d Wei Sheng smiled and handed over the jingshi.</p><br/><p>\u201cGreat. How many moves are you betting? Look here, this is the odds for each move\u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBet on Zuo Mo winning.\u201d Wei Sheng kept on smiling gently.</p><br/><p>The worker was dumbstruck.</p><br/><p>Translator Ramblings: Guess what\u2019s the hottest new thing about town? Just how badly Zuo Mo would lose!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

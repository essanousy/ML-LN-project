Zuo Mo was reminded about this each time he came, especially the small of fresh ling grasses mixed with all kinds of waste. It was torture.</p><br/><p>Chun Yu Cheng\u2019s expression was intoxicated. \u201cSuch a fresh and healthy smell!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo smiled helplessly. Chun Shidi was more and more enchanted with animal husbandry and his temper had become strange. The other was alright with him, but was not friendly to others, especially disliking people coming onto his cloud island.</p><br/><p>There were many kinds of ling and mo grasses planted on the island to feed the cloud seeds. Zuo Mo had not seen many of these ling grasses before. They flashed with enchanting lights which meant that their grade was not low. In the present Mo Cloud Sea, Zuo Mo\u2019s half-assed ling plant farmer skill was laughable.</p><br/><p>The ling plant farmers of Mo Cloud Sea were unlike the ling plant farmers anywhere else. They were skilled in using seal formations and their effectiveness was higher. This was an unique system that Mo Cloud Sea\u2019s strong forging abilities provided the support for.</p><br/><p>Cloud Sea Jie did not have many ling fields and the ling plant farmers were mostly gathered in the jie with large tracts of ling fields. The ling grasses on Chun Shidi\u2019s island were relatively high grade, and the skill of the ling plant farmers were relatively high as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow are they?\u201d Zuo Mo asked in concern.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou should have sent them a long time ago.\u201d Chun Yu Cheng\u2019s expression was pained as he chatted, \u201cIf you sent them in a bit later, they would have been wasted! Oh, it wouldn\u2019t have been useful if you sent them over earlier, I hadn\u2019t found out how to raise cloud steeds then, en en, you picked a good opportunity \u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo felt tormented by Chun Shidi\u2019s excessive chatter. He tried to endure. People like Chun Shidi had unusual enthusiasm and obsession with their own field and didn\u2019t care about anything else. They did not understand how to interact with people, and rarely conversed with other people. Most of them had strange personalities. On the other hand, they had outstanding talent and they worked furiously, unaffected by anything else. They usually achieved more in their own field than other people.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo could understand them.</p><br/><p>Chattering endlessly on the way, they finally came to the beast pool from last time.</p><br/><p>Chun Yu Cheng became alert and didn\u2019t waste words. \u201cTenth Grade and Sunshine are good, especially Tenth Grade. His killing energy is thick and he is a rare vicious being. I used the [Hunt Blood Pool] to nurture his body. This will increasing his killing energy. He uses the sword and I asked Eldest Shixiong to find the most vicious sword scripture for him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMost vicious scripture \u2026 \u2026\u201d Zuo Mo felt a cold sweat. If it was the most vicious sword scripture that Chun shidi could find, he would just smile and dismiss it. But if it was Eldest Shixiong, then it definitely was the most vicious sword scripture.</p><br/><p>Chun Yu Cheng had a smug expression. \u201cI don\u2019t really understand sword scriptures, but since Eldest Shixiong said it was the most vicious, then it definitely is. [Hundred Sacrificed Souls Killing Sword]. How about it, just this name seems very powerful.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo\u2019s body couldn\u2019t help but shake. He knew this sword scripture. This had been from Pu\u2019s collection. Pu had said back then that the [Hundred Sacrificed Souls Killing Sword] was not the strongest sword scripture, but could be said to be one of the most vicious.</p><br/><p>At this time, Zuo Mo had not been affected by Pu Yao\u2019s emotional opinion. He didn\u2019t have much interest in cultivating sword scriptures.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo thought of another problem and couldn\u2019t help but ask, \u201cCan Tenth Grade cultivate?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tenth Grade was not like Eldest Shixiong. He originated from a ling beast and was not like a xiuzhe. He had never heard of a ling beast cultivating a sword scripture.</p><br/><p>\u201cI had worried about this before, but I found later on that Tenth Grade is very intelligent and matched well with this sword scripture. There isn\u2019t a problem at all.\u201d Chun Yu Cheng\u2019s expression of pride grew as he seemed to ask for praise. \u201cShixiong, when the time comes, you will have a super sidekick! Tenth Grade\u2019s name was really chosen with great foresight. Shixiong, did you predict a long time ago that he could reach tenth grade?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo\u2019s expression was righteous. \u201cOf course! Otherwise, how can I be your shixiong?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true!\u201d Chun Yu Cheng nodded seriously. \u201cAs expected, those that are shixiong are all strong. Shixiong, you are strong, Gongsun Shixiong is also strong, but Eldest Shixiong is the strongest.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Zuo Mo thought, had Chun Shidi grown powerful enough that he could see people\u2019s power?</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause he\u2019s Gongsun Shixiong\u2019s shixiong\u2019s shixiong.\u201d Chun Yu Cheng\u2019s expression was matter-of-fact. \u201cOf course he is the strongest!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo was speechless. He quickly changed the topic. \u201cSunshine?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chun Yu Cheng fell for it as expected. \u201cSunshine\u2019s attributes are the opposite of Tenth Grade. His specialities are healing, protection, and assistance. If Tenth Grade is yin, then Sunshine is yang. Therefore, the beast pool that I picked is the [Water Flesh Wood Bone Pool]. For Sunshine I did not choose spells, but yao arts.\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking at the excitement on Chun Yu Cheng\u2019s face, Zuo Mo perceptively asked, \u201cOh, what great yao art is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha! Shixiong, you understand me the best!\u201d Chun Yu Cheng laughed proudly. Increasing his volume, he said joyfully, \u201cIt is the [Universal Life] that has been said to be the essential art for super-nannies. Oh, the yao like to call the people who cultivate this yao art nannies. I feel it is very accurate. Other than this, he also cultivates [Ward Breaking Art]. Shixiong, don\u2019t worry. Under my great care, Sunshine can definitely move into the ranks of the top nannies! Such an adorable nanny!\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking at the snowy white and handsome Sunshine, Zuo Mo seemed to see him wearing an apron and holding a bottle in his hand. He couldn\u2019t help but shudder.</p><br/><p>He immediately felt sympathy for Sunshine, but when his words reached his mouth, it became, \u201cShidi\u2019s results are masterworks!\u201d</p><br/><p>Chun Yu Cheng became more excited upon receiving Zuo Mo\u2019s praise. He pulled Zuo Mo over and said excitedly, \u201cAs expected, Shixiong understands me best. Those people do not understand the greatness and holiness of husbandry. This is a kind of creation, a novel creation! I am fated to be the man that will create the strongest ling beasts!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo wiped the cold sweat away from his face as he nodded. \u201cShidi is ambitious! I admire this!\u201d</p><br/><p>Chun Yu Cheng smiled and pulled Zuo Mo to a tall dan cauldron.</p><br/><p>\u201cI asked Golden Crow Camp to forge this dan cauldron. I also got Sun Bao and Ji Wei to operate it for a few days. It is a pity that I couldn\u2019t find them later on. The other people said that they went out.\u201d Chun Yu Cheng\u2019s tone was full of regret. \u201cIf they are here, this fire will definitely be stronger.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo who knew about the entire matter sighed again. He was filled with sympathy towards Sun Bao and Ji Wei. Chun Yu Cheng usually did not show himself in public but he was Zuo Mo\u2019s shidi. His status in Mo Cloud Sea was high. If his requests were not ridiculous, no one would dare refuse him. Due to this, when they received a request for help, Sun Bao and Ji Wei had hurried over despite their heavy workload.</p><br/><p>But Chun Yu Cheng had the two of them act as cauldron workers. Heavens, the two masters of Golden Crow Camp, the two top people in charge of all the seal xiu in Mo Cloud Sea acting as manual laborers, and for three days!</p><br/><p>When they reached three days, they did not relent to Chun Yu Cheng\u2019s invitation, and fled with their ash-covered faces.</p><br/><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t find them no matter what I tried. I could only hire some of the experienced people from Golden Crow Camp. However, they are lacking compared to Sun Bao and Ji Wei, but still acceptable.\u201d Chun Yu Cheng was clearly slightly displeased.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine if it is about the same!\u201d Zuo Mo hurriedly comforted.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d Chun Yu Cheng thought and said with a tilted head, \u201cThis dan cauldron is good and the people later on worked hard. The results aren\u2019t bad. Shixiong\u2019s shen fire was also crucial and beneficial to Lil\u2019 Fire\u2019s growth. However, Lil\u2019 Fire is slightly less intelligent compared to Tenth Grade and Sunshine. But it is an yao beast to begin with and has no trouble cultivating yao arts. I found a fire yao art in the Pu Wei Library called the [Fire Heart Bone Refining Art] for it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo stilled and instinctively asked, \u201cLil\u2019 Fire has bones?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lil\u2019 Fire had ended up in Zuo Mo\u2019s demonic hands many times and he had squeezed the other countless times. In Zuo Mo\u2019s memories, Lil\u2019 Fire was like a rubber ball, and didn\u2019t have any bones.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt does!\u201d When it came to his profession, Chun Yu Cheng\u2019s expression immediately became serious. \u201cThere are many small bones inside its body similar to sea sponges. These bones are very small and flexible. Their structure is very flexible and resilient so Lil\u2019 Fire appears as though it is boneless.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, so this cultivation will thicken its bones and have it become more powerful?\u201d Zuo Mo asked with anticipation.</p><br/><p>\u201cPowerful?\u201d Chun Yu Cheng shook his head with bewilderment. \u201cI don\u2019t know that. I only felt that these kind of bones were rare and wanted to try cultivating it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo\u2019s face was black as a pot. \u201cEven you don\u2019t know the result?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, this is normal. It is hard to predict the results of many husbandry trials.\u201d Chun Yu Cheng said with a righteous tone.</p><br/><p>But when Chun Yu Cheng turned and saw Zuo Mo\u2019s black face, he knew it was not good. He was so friendly this time because he had a goal. If he ruined the matter, it would be terrible.</p><br/><p>He hurriedly pulled Zuo Mo to another place.</p><br/><p>Unlike the other beast pools, there was a kind of vine growing here that Zuo Mo had never seen. It grew over multiple mu of fields and under the thick vines, there was a transparent bubble that hung below.</p><br/><p>Lil\u2019 Black seemed to see Zuo Mo from within the bubble. It furiously moved its legs, but no matter how it moved, it only spun around in the water bubble.</p><br/><p>\u201cShixiong, look, this is the Water Bubble Vine,\u201d Chun Yu Cheng hurriedly introduced. \u201cIt can grow this a special kind of water bubble, and is a natural beast pool. Also, Shixiong, take a look.\u201d</p><br/><p>As he spoke, he pulled away the thick leaves covering the ground and showed a beast pool. Zuo Mo found that the roots of the water bubble vine grew into the beast pool.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe medicine in the beast pool is absorbed by the root system and then gathers in the water bubbles. This process is even more wondrous than the seal formations we engrave. All kinds of medicines can merge together in the water bubble and form a natural beast pool.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo was also attracted by such a wondrous beast pool.</p><br/><p>Chun Yu Cheng saw the interest on Zuo Mo\u2019s face and continued, \u201cThe medicine absorbed will change slightly through the vine\u2019s roots and leaves. This is also the source of its great ability. However, because the water bubbles are not very big, it can only be used on those relatively small beasts. I saw Lil\u2019 Black and immediately thought of the water bubble vine.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is its use to Lil\u2019 Black?\u201d Zuo Mo went directly for the core of the matter.</p><br/><p>\u201cHee hee, Shixiong, don\u2019t be shocked when you hear this!\u201d Chun Yu Cheng was both smug and mysterious.</p><br/><p>Translator Ramblings: I just realized that the Rainbow Mark Butterfly was the only pet of Zuo Mo\u2019s to die, and it was the only pet he didn\u2019t give a name to. That should have made its fate obvious.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

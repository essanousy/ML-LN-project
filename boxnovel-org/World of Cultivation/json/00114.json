Friend Xin Yan\u2019s sword essence is the strongest and guards the center. The nine ling springs are the passages through the entire formation, allowing the sword essence to regenerate itself. The five sword essences create destruction between themselves. It is impossible to find the one living change when you have not reached the level of Heart Turn Sword Essence. Even if one is in jindan, if their sword essence is not high enough, it is impossible. Trying to break through the formation with brute force is seeking death!\u201d</p><br/><p>Pei Yuan Ran praised, \u201cThe formation that Sanren has set up is amazing. To use sword essences in a formation, this one has never heard of it!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Ling Sanren was very proud inside, but he did not lose his calm, modestly saying, \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for the requirements of your sect, this one wouldn\u2019t have thought of such a method.\u201d He then sighed. \u201cThat day when I was a judge, I saw Zuo Mo\u2019s battle. Truthfully, this one was very shocked, but Friend Xin Yan is right we sword xiu must practice the sword! But I haven\u2019t thought that your sect would spend so much for one disciple. To be from such a sect, Zuo Mo is very fortunate!\u201d</p><br/><p>Pei Yuan Ran shook his head. \u201cMoney and talismans are important, but what is most important are people. The people are present, so the sect is present. The people are strong, then the sect is strong. Since he is a disciple of our sect, then this matter is our duty. We only hope that he would wake and return to the right path as early as possible, as to not waste our efforts.\u201d</p><br/><p>The other three had stern expressions.</p><br/><p>Wu Ling Sanren felt a deep sense of respect for these elders. \u201cSect Leader Pei, do not worry. This boy is intelligent and certainly will understand your efforts.\u201d</p><br/><p>Pei Yuan Ran laughed. \u201cIf Sanren did not help this time, we wouldn\u2019t know what to do. This guy really is a headache!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo matter. After being tempered, he would understand. There are ten thousands paths in the work, but only cultivating the sword is the true path. One sword breaks all moves. All his tricks are just like paper in front of sword essences.\u201d Wu Ling Sanren said proudly. He dared to say something like this, not because he had such confidence in his formation, but strong confidence in these four people\u2019s sword essences.</p><br/><p>He had heard rumors about the four elders of Wu Kong Sword Sect: Yan Le was skilled in management; Shi Feng Rong specialized in dan-making; and sect leader Pei Yuan Ran did not involve himself in worldly affairs. He had heard the reputation of the Ice Dragon Sword, but never had personally seen it so he hadn\u2019t felt anything. Only during the construction of this formation did he experience how deep the roots of Wu Kong Sword Sect were. They far surpassed anyone\u2019s imagination.</p><br/><p>Of the five xiu present , his sword essence was the weakest. This made him feel a sense of embarrassment. He had rarely seen a sword essence as strong and terrifying as Xin Yan\u2019s, which surpassed many of those so-called experts.</p><br/><p>Originally, he had been worried the four\u2019s sword essences would not be pure enough and would destabilize the formation. Now, he understood he had underestimated them.</p><br/><p>With Xin Yan\u2019s sword essence, which guarded the center, this big formation was as solid as rock and was unable to be destroyed. This formation was stronger than any other formation he had ever made. Even jindan experts would be unable to escape unscathed if they attacked this formation and were attacked in return by the pure sword essences left by these five xiu .</p><br/><p>His only regret was that such a strong formation was to imprison a disciple in just zhuji. This did not allow him to feel a sense of accomplishment.</p><br/><p>However, to be able to use this chance to form a relationship with Wu Kong Sword Sect, he was naturally very willing. He was full of confidence about Wu Kong Sword Sect\u2019s future after seeing these four people\u2019s terrifying power. The elders were strong and cared about nurturing their disciples, these disciples were also geniuses. Such a sect, he really couldn\u2019t think of a reason it would not prosper.</p><br/><p>Pei Yuan Ran saw that everyone\u2019s faces were extremely tired and smiled, \u201cThis boy really has caused great trouble for us usually. Now, let him go enjoy it himself. Let\u2019s go, we can rest. Sanren can get a taste of my ling tea.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Ling Sanren hurriedly agreed.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo was completely ignorant that the elders had left. He didn\u2019t dare to move.</p><br/><p>He was too familiar with the enormous dragon moving in front of him. He had been sliced by this thing countless times. Second Shibo\u2019s sword essence!</p><br/><p>Gritting his teeth, Zuo Mo suddenly raised his voice to wail, \u201cMaster! Disciple was wrong! This disciple will definitely change, let this disciple out \u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Master might look cold but she was very concerned about him. If he begged, maybe Master\u2019s heart would soften and let him out.</p><br/><p>After shouting until his throat had gone raw, there was no movement from outside the formation. Bitter water rose in Zuo Mo\u2019s heart like a flood. His little heart floated in bitterness. Up until now, he still did not understand what he had done wrong to make the sect leader and the others so furious.</p><br/><p>As he shouted, his feet didn\u2019t dare to move. The dragon in front of him freely moved around, never too far from him. The cold and indifferent eyes would occasionally sweep across his body. He felt that he was cold from head to toe.</p><br/><p>He did not doubt that if he moved the slightest, the dragon claw of this dragon would gently swipe and he would be torn to pieces, flesh flying and lose his life.</p><br/><p>This thing was the true essence!</p><br/><p>He wanted to cry as he shuddered.</p><br/><p>Only when he truly faced Second Shibo\u2019s ice dragon did he experience how great the difference was between Pu Yao\u2019s fake sword essence and the real one. Terror, instinctive terror rose from his heart. No matter how he suppressed it, terror was like a yao weed grass that could not be stopped, furiously growing through his heart.</p><br/><p>After warily standing for an hour, the dragon moved away. But Zuo Mo instantly understood the look that it gave right before leaving.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2014\u2014 I\u2019ll come back.\u201d</p><br/><p>When the dragon disappeared completely, the terrifying pressure also disappeared. The land was empty as though nothing had happened.</p><br/><p>At this time, Zuo Mo lost his nervousness and started to scan the surroundings. He quickly understood he was in the middle of a formation. Thinking about the astoundingly large formation he had seen from the air, he shuddered.</p><br/><p>F***, did the sect leader and the others want to kill him?</p><br/><p>He had just been sighing in amazement at how big the formation was. He hadn\u2019t thought that he would be thrown into the formation by Second Shibo.</p><br/><p>He had to admit he underestimated the rage Second Shibo had towards him!</p><br/><p>His mind recovering, Zuo Mo thought about how his wailing had not received a response and instantly understood that the sect leaders and the others truly wanted him to suffer. It wasn\u2019t that he hadn\u2019t thought before what punishment Second Shibo and the others would give him. Getting beaten, house arrest, or special training, he had prepared himself mentally.</p><br/><p>But after all though calculations, who would have thought that Second Shibo did something even more severe!</p><br/><p>Even if Zuo Mo didn\u2019t understand formations, he would be able to see the extraordinary nature of the formation, and he did have some knowledge of formations. Just one look and he could detect the strength of the person who set up the formation was much higher than his.</p><br/><p>This kind of difference was not just in one area, but in all areas, including cultivation, understanding of formations, sword essences, etc etc.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo looked into the surroundings. He was clear that the sect leader and the others definitely wouldn\u2019t take his life, they just wanted him to suffer a bit.</p><br/><p>But this formation \u2026 \u2026</p><br/><p>Very dangerous! Very very dangerous!</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo swallowed. In a few short steps, the shock in his heart increased.</p><br/><p>Each step was full of killing intent!</p><br/><p>Damn it! Zuo Mo want to swear!</p><br/><p>Even the ground was permeated with fine and dense sword essences that disregarded the shoes on his feet and needled into the soles. It was like he was walking on a board covered with needles, each step left his feet full of pain. It was not just that. The air in front of him looked harmless, but if he moved, the disturbance of the air would naturally formed layers of sword essence around him. These sword essences were like fine icicles, slicing Zuo Mo who was in the middle!</p><br/><p>They couldn\u2019t do this \u2026 \u2026</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo wailed inside. Just how big of an offence had he made to make Master and the others so furious?</p><br/><p>Staying in his original spot, he could only wait for the dragon to come back, that was too dangerous! He gritted his teeth and started [Vajra Profound Sutra]. Right now, his [Vajra Profound Sutra] was at Red Lotus Flowing Gold, hard to wound by normal flying swords.</p><br/><p>Lucky that ge had practiced it \u2026 \u2026 Zuo Mo rejoiced inside.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>Wu Kong Hall, Pei Yuan Ran and the other four idly drank ling tea.</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha, that boy definitely would use [Vajra Profound Sutra].\u201d Yan Le snickered and glanced at Xin Yan who was drinking without speaking a word. \u201cSecond Shixiong really thought of everything, even planning for [Vajra Profound Sutra].\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSword xiu only cultivate the sword.\u201d Xin Yan said frigidly. He sipped, and then added, \u201cNot the body.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis boy really is terrible, he only just walks the wrong paths.\u201d Shi Feng Rong\u2019s face was angry. Her disciple had made everyone feel a headache, and used up so much wealth, she kept on feeling angry. \u201cMaking him cultivate the body was so he could have something to save his life. He\u2019s great. He just silently practices it to the fourth level. Getting him to learn formations, it\u2019s so he can learn more about dan-making, so he has a secondary profession, and wouldn\u2019t have trouble making his living. This little brat just sinks into formations, and doesn\u2019t know to progress, his side job becoming his main profession! His main profession actually went backwards!\u201d</p><br/><p>Vent up to this point, she felt very uncomfortable. \u201cIt\u2019s all my fault. I\u2019ve been remiss in teaching him. That\u2019s why he walked onto the wrong path!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Ling Sanren hurriedly comforted. \u201cShi Xianzi is overly blaming yourself. Young people always are tempted by new things. That\u2019s normal. Which sect doesn\u2019t have one or two disciples like this? As the elders, we can only slowly guide them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSanren is right. Shimei, don\u2019t be sad.\u201d Pei Yuan Ran also comforted.</p><br/><p>Yan Le snickered. \u201cThat boy can just keep suffering. I\u2019ve been finding his [Vajra Profound Sutra] an eyesore for a long time. Red Lotus Flowing Gold, he thinks he\u2019s a Dhyana? Even Dhyana lose when they face us! He needs to understand all his tricks are just garbage.\u201d</p><br/><p>None of the other four objected to Yan Le\u2019s words. They all had a matter-of-face expression.</p><br/><p>The pride of sword xiu came from thousands of years of holding a ruling position, they were unshakable.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo didn\u2019t think that his actions would have be completely planned for by the elders.</p><br/><p>Just as he activated the [Vajra Profound Sutra], the sword essences which had been like icicles suddenly became sharks that tasted blood and flooded towards him from all the surrounding areas.</p><br/><p>Brring brring brrring !</p><br/><p>Woosh woosh woosh!</p><br/><p>Different howls of sword essences filled Zuo Mo\u2019s ears like the earth was breaking, the sky was changing color!</p><br/><p>The sudden change made Zuo Mo freeze!</p><br/><p>He dazedly looked at the air that had turned turbulent, looked at the howls created by this sky full of sword essences, at the sword essences that flooded at him from all around \u2026 \u2026</p><br/><p>What \u2026 \u2026 what was this \u2026 \u2026</p><br/><p>Translator Ramblings: So over on r/noveltranslations, someone said that Wu Kong Sword Sect was a sect in decline. It would be more accurate to say that Wu Kong Sword Sect was a sect that had declined after its first years after founding, reached the bottom in the generation before Pei Yuan Ran and the others, and are on their way back up again. The four elders lived in a one-jindan sect which is not very strong compared to other sects. Most of the sect\u2019s present wealth and assets (excluding Wu Kong Mountain and the sword cave) most likely was accumulated by these four over time. I have to say that their master (and Zuo Mo\u2019s grand \u2013 master) was both super lucky and skilled to have taught four outstanding disciples.</p><br/><p>The elders and Wu Kong Sword Sect remained low-key until Wei Sheng, and kept its numbers small so people in Dong Fu did not know it very well. That doesn\u2019t mean it is not a strong sect. It\u2019s not wealthy, like Ling Ying Sect, and it does not have a power base and connections like Dong Fu Hall does. Wu Kong Sword Sect\u2019s rise is the four jindan, and the three second-generation disciples it now has. This is why people think Wu Kong Sword Sect is going to prosper. Of course, this is all relative to Sky Moon Jie, which is in the backwaters.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

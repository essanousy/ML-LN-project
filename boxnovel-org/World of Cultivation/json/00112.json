There seemed to be an invisible magnetism between the sword billets. She reached out to touch one of them. The other three also moved along with it. The four sword billets maintained their distance from each other, all of them pointing away from each other in a compass arrangement.</p><br/><p>The joy in Su\u2019s eyes became even heavier. The four sword billets marched around her.</p><br/><p>The storekeeper found it wondrous. \u201cAmazing craftsmanship! The four swords are as one, able to attack and defend, truly the finest! If it can be tempered over time, this sword would be hard to trace!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo was tired but he was still quite alert. Finishing the sword billets, he found himself extremely relaxed.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaving finished this, I need to leave.\u201d Zuo Mo prepared to leave.</p><br/><p>Su suddenly called Zuo Mo. \u201cMister Zuo, please wait! This one had not helped during the Sword Test Conference, yet Mister Zuo still kept to your promise and helped me forge the sword billets. This little girl is extremely grateful. Mister Zuo, please take this bottle of Dying Flowing Moon!\u201d</p><br/><p>Su\u2019s gaze was sincere, unable to let go of the four sword billets.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo naturally wouldn\u2019t be polite. Dying Flowing Moon was very good! Quickly taking the Dying Flowing Moon, he said piously, \u201cThen this one will accept.\u201d</p><br/><p>He thought of something and turned to say to the storekeeper. \u201cI have something here I want to ask Storekeeper to take a look.\u201d</p><br/><p>The storekeeper hurriedly said, \u201cIt would be my honor!\u201d If the reputation of Zuo Mo\u2019s strength was why they did not dare to slight him, now, after successfully forging the four sword billets, Zuo Mo\u2019s skill in forging received more respect from the storekeeper. The storekeeper and the others were business people. Their business was also in talismans. Why would they ever offend a cultivator who had limitless potential and was skilled in forging?</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo took out a wooden box from the ring. Opening the box, he took out a jade bottle.</p><br/><p>The two saw Zuo Mo was so serious, and became more curious to what treasure he was taking out.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo handed the jade bottle to the storekeeper, saying, \u201cThis item is not inside the five elements, but this one does not know what it is. Please, Storekeeper, take a look!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot inside the five elements!\u201d Su\u2019s expression changed.</p><br/><p>The storekeeper also slightly changed expression but maintained the sternness in his expression. How good a storekeeper\u2019s eyes were was the most important measure of a storekeeper\u2019s skill. He didn\u2019t want to ruin his own reputation.</p><br/><p>Carefully taking out the cork, he pour out the grey mud inside the bottle onto a snowy-white jade plate.</p><br/><p>After studying for a few moments, he solemnly announced, \u201cThis one cannot distinguish what this substance is, but it truly is not inside the five elements. It doesn\u2019t seem like just one substance, but is a mixture of a variety of different substances not inside the five elements. It really is curious.\u201d</p><br/><p>What he found it strange was that materials not inside the five elements were rare, and it was hard to even find one or two, so he did not know how such a complex mixture was produced.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo stilled. He suddenly remembered the large variety of materials he had thrown into the Five Colored Pagoda. The composition of this grey mud must be very complex. He couldn\u2019t help but admire the skill of the storekeeper.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is the value of this substance?\u201d Zuo Mo asked.</p><br/><p>The storekeeper shook his head. \u201cHard to say.\u201d He then explained, \u201cIf it was one substance, this one can easily set a price. The composition of this substance is extremely complex, and probably has a special use. Maybe it could be used in a flying sword. Materials not inside the five elements, if added into flying swords, can increase the grade of flying swords.\u201d</p><br/><p>He glanced at the four flying swords floating in front of Su and said, \u201cIf Miss Su could add this substance into the four sword billets before they were forged, the grade would have increased greatly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Vexation came into Su\u2019s eyes. But since the formations on the sword billet had taken form, there was nothing to do so she did not say anything.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo was very curious. \u201cSubstances not of the five elements can increase the grade of flying swords? I\u2019ve never heard of this.\u201d</p><br/><p>The storekeeper saw Zuo Mo was interested and said, \u201cIt is hard to find substances not of the five elements. The price has never dropped, and dependent on the attributes of the material, the effect is different. However, one quality is common to all. They are extremely attractive to ling power, especially ling power that is not strongly oriented to the five elements. For roaming xiu that cultivate the five elements, this is not a good thing, but to us sword xiu, it is the best. Most of the sword sect in our jie do not have ling power oriented to the five elements.\u201d</p><br/><p>He had originally wanted to say that five element sword scriptures didn\u2019t have much of a future, when he suddenly remembered the sword scripture that Zuo Mo practiced was a five element sword scripture so he quickly changed his wording.</p><br/><p>Hearing this, Zuo Mo instantly became excited. Coming from a sword sect, he instantly realized the value of the grey mud on his hands.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it is only used as material for flying swords, storekeeper, give a price.\u201d Zuo Mo said.</p><br/><p>The storekeeper hesitated and reported a price, \u201cTwo hundred pieces of third-grade jingshi.\u201d</p><br/><p>As he finished, Su suddenly opened, \u201cThree hundred pieces of third-grade jingshi, can Mister Zuo part with this?\u201d After several interactions with Zuo Mo, she had figured out his general personality. This guy was clear and hard to trick, but as long as there was enough money, he could be tempted.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay!\u201d Without another word, Zuo Mo agreed.</p><br/><p>Three hundred pieces of third-grade jingshi was far beyond the price in his heart. The grey mud was just the waste from the Five Colored Pagoda, and easy to get.</p><br/><p>Su was also crisp in handing over the jingshi to give to Zuo Mo.</p><br/><p>Having jingshi, Zuo Mo felt his heart rest. He sighed inside. As expected, with food in his hand, his heart wouldn\u2019t panic.</p><br/><p>Three hundred pieces of third-grade jingshi. It wasn\u2019t much but it wasn\u2019t a small amount. However, in the Hundred Treasures Flying Pavilion, it was only enough to buy one talisman. Zuo Mo could only reluctantly leave. The stuff of the Hundred Treasure Flying Pavilion was good, but the price wasn\u2019t something normal people could pay.</p><br/><p>His goal was businesses with lower prices, for example, He Rong.</p><br/><p>Among the people that Zuo Mo knew, Fu Jin was a snakehead. His connections were complex and could always obtain things difficult to find. However, if it was mainstream materials, he didn\u2019t have any advantages. He Rong and Zuo Mo had worked together before, their working relationship was well established.</p><br/><p>When He Rong saw Zuo Mo, he was extremely surprised. He quickly gave a smile, \u201cZuo ye coming to this little shop, it is our honor!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo\u2019s name was like the sun right now, a hot commodity in the entire Sky Moon Jie. He Rong put himself extremely low.</p><br/><p>\u201cDoes Boss He find me too old?\u201d The first words that Zuo Mo said made He Rong\u2019s expression change but his next words made him release a breath. \u201cTreating an old friend like this, it really is too courteous! Just call me Xiao Zuo.\u201d</p><br/><p>He Rong could not be blamed for being so nervous. Compared to before, Zuo Mo was someone that was famous in Dong Fu. Businesspeople like He Rong saw even farther into the future. Wu Kong Sword Sect, who had three disciples of limitless potential and four jindan experts, would definitely rise.</p><br/><p>Wu Kong Sword Sect was abnormally mysterious. No one knew what their conduct was like so when outsiders faced them, they naturally were careful.</p><br/><p>He Rong was very experienced, and naturally went along with the flow, pretending to be familiar, \u201cLook, look, you call me He Boss, but wanting me to call you Xiao Zuo, this is not right. If we are brothers, just call me Old He.\u201d</p><br/><p>Having received such fame, Zuo Mo\u2019s conduct did not seem different than before, without any pride. Thinking out the core disciples of those sects that he usually had relations with, He Rong couldn\u2019t help but sigh. If Wu Kong Sword Sect did not rise, then there was no justice in the world.</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha, right. We have history.\u201d Zuo Mo said. He had interacted countless times before with Fu Jin and the others. He was very familiar with all this.</p><br/><p>He Rong pointed at Zuo Mo, smiling as he said, \u201cI know you won\u2019t just come for nothing. Say it, selling or buying?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo snicked. \u201cOld He knows me so well. I\u2019m planning on buying some five element materials.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFive element materials?\u201d He Rong had a puzzled expression. \u201cWhat do you want that for?\u201d He suddenly realized, \u201cRight, my memory, you are also skilled in forging and dan-making!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo didn\u2019t explain, only smiling and saying, \u201cI want to pick some materials strong in five element power, do you have any?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood kinds, or normal?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNormal.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCome with me.\u201d He Rong nodded and said to Zuo Mo, walking at the front.</p><br/><p>He Rong\u2019s store was composed of the front shop and the back yard. Zuo Mo followed him through the store into the back yard. Passing through the yard and into the inner compound, Zuo Mo finally noticed that the doorway to the compound was full of jinzhi.</p><br/><p>Even with Zuo Mo\u2019s eyes, he couldn\u2019t help but be shocked. Some of these jinzhi were extremely powerful, and confusion and illusory jinzhi were countless.</p><br/><p>Just as he was puzzled, He Rong suddenly stopped. His hands cast multiple spells. A door of light appeared in front of them.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome in.\u201d He Rong stepped inside the door first.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo was curious and hurried to follow.</p><br/><p>Stepping inside the door of light, the space in front of him suddenly became vast. There were hundreds of ten zhang high shelves made from pinewood arranged into lines. The shelves were filled with all kinds of materials, and a strange odor wafting in the air.</p><br/><p>It was the first time Zuo Mo had seen something this spectacular. He thought inside that He Rong\u2019s business was much larger than he had imagined!</p><br/><p>He Rong did not show it, but he was not a simple character!</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo felt his steps were much lighter than usual. He made a sound and looked down at the ground.</p><br/><p>He Rong noticed Zuo Mo\u2019s shock. He smiled and said, \u201cBrother Zuo must rarely come to the stores.\u201d He then explained, \u201cStorage areas would usually have a [Light Feather Formation] on the ground. The workers can float in the air, and it is convenient to fetch items. If they accidentally drop something, the item would not be damaged.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo instantly understood, \u201cSo that\u2019s why!\u201d</p><br/><p>His feet slightly used force and he was like a feather that floated into the air. What was even more particular was that he could freely adjust his direction in the air. The design was amazing!</p><br/><p>He Rong had a smile. He had the desire to show his strength when he decided to take Zuo Mo into the stores. Wu Kong Sword Sect would definitely rise in the future. In order to create a cooperative relationship with this kind of sect, strength was the base of cooperation.</p><br/><p>\u201cHere, all the five element materials are here. Pick whichever items you want. Oh, I\u2019ll give you the best price.\u201d He Rong smiled. Giving a good price, but not free. Zuo Mo felt that was even more comfortable.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen many thanks, Old Brother He!\u201d Zuo Mo\u2019s words were really from his heart.</p><br/><p>People who had strength could always more easily receive respect from others.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo went into the materials and started to pick.</p><br/><p>His measure was very special. He didn\u2019t care about the grade of the material, what he needed was five elemental power. The Five Colored Pagoda was not a picky eater. Right now, the Five Colored Pagoda\u2019s primary goal was to recover its power, not to increase its level. He did not need to consider high level materials.</p><br/><p>Also, in compliance with Zuo Mo\u2019s usual conduct, he decided to take the price to the extreme \u2013\u2013 materials that were the cheapest and had the most five element power!</p><br/><p>Translator Ramblings: \u201cXiao Zuo\u201d means\u201dLittle Zuo\u201d. He Rong was the person that Zuo Mo sold plants to.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

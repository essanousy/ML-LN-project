However, to accompany women, especially a crowd of women to window-shop, this required a very strong endurance of the body, probably only those who cultivated the body could endure.</p><br/><p>Seeing that they brought everything they needed, Zuo Mo sneaked away.</p><br/><p>He first went to buy the gold ore. What Pu Yao had said last time, he remembered it. He also brought a jade stick full of basic seal formations. Even though there were teachings from the sect, but there were only just a few kinds. Seal formations were something that all xiuzhe had to learn. No matter if it was forging or making dan, it all required understanding seal formations.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo brought them to create ling fields in the future, even if it was far away. The jade stick didn\u2019t cost much, the expensive one was the gold ore. Twenty pieces of second grade jingshi was enough for him to suffer in pain for a long time but he still decided to buy it.</p><br/><p>His attitude now was different than before. Before, he only looked at jingshi. Even if he still liked jingshi, but he put more importance on the future.</p><br/><p>After Fourth Shigu revealed it, he was clear that he couldn\u2019t return to the past. Those simple aspirations were completely shattered. He was walking on a road that he didn\u2019t know the destination of. What was waiting in the front for him? Breaking into pieces? Finding the answer? He didn\u2019t know.</p><br/><p>What had seemed fresh and exciting in the past was now dull and tasteless now.</p><br/><p>He found a quiet place to sit down and started to think back to the last sword energy he had released. No one taught him. Even Pu Yao only made him experience it for himself. Towards Pu Yao, he only felt grateful. If there wasn\u2019t Pu Yao, he might not even have the chance to seek answers.</p><br/><p>Now that he had the chance, how could he not treasure it?</p><br/><p>He hadn\u2019t realized his own transformation. He suddenly understood some of what Wei Sheng Shixiong felt. Obsession, unrelenting obsession! Every time he thought about his appearance being changed, his mind erase, his wooden face would burn with pain like it was reminding him there was a pair of hands that wiped away his face, that were was a pair of hands that wiped away his memories. This burning that seeped in his bones made him unable to tolerate himself muddle-headedly living.</p><br/><p>He wanted answers!</p><br/><p>He was very clear just how low his starting point was. He didn\u2019t want to waste even one second. He thought of all the ways, worked over his minds, used all his cunning to make himself stronger, to let himself have greater power \u2013\u2013 he wanted answers!</p><br/><p>In the corner of the busy street, he serenely coiled his legs and mused.</p><br/><p>In the roaring sea of fire, Pu sat on the gravestone and lazily listened to the sound tablet.</p><br/><p>The female disciples finally brought all they needed. Everyone\u2019s faces were brimming with content. Zuo Mo finally released a breath. He was now in a rush to return back. Today\u2019s encounter let him have a taste of power. He desperately and impatiently wanted to keep training.</p><br/><p>But in consideration of the safety of these female disciples, he still sat on the flying paper crane and slowly followed them. But he still took grasp of each bit of time.</p><br/><p>Returning to the little yard, the first thing Zuo Mo did was put the black gold worm and the gold ore together, dig a small hole near the ling vein and bury them.</p><br/><p>After burial, he entered his consciousness. Facing Pu Yao, he said: \u201cPu, let\u2019s continue!\u201d</p><br/><p>Unexpectedly, Pu lazily said: \u201cContinue? Continue what?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo blanked before quickly recovering his calm: \u201cWhat conditions do you have?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHee hee, it\u2019s so convenient talking with smart people.\u201d Pu smiled lightly and straightened: \u201cThis is correct, where in the world are there free meals? Hee hee, I want souls.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSouls?\u201d Zuo Mo jumped in fear.</p><br/><p>Pu Yao\u2019s expression was relaxed and his voice carefree as he said: \u201cSouls are good things. The taste fresh, full of vitality. Blood, human meat, they can\u2019t compare.\u201d</p><br/><p>Just a few words and Zuo Mo became quite scared. In his mind, he couldn\u2019t help but think of those great monsters, eating raw human meat, pulling tendons, sucking marrow, eating souls. For a xiuzhe whose dream was becoming a ling plant farmer, things like souls were enough to make him jump out of his skin.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo way!\u201d Zuo Mo resolutely refused. Pu Yao was truly a great monster!</p><br/><p>Even though he wanted power, but he definitely didn\u2019t want himself become a servant of power!</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you want to learn the sword? Hee hee, other than the sword, I still have many other things to teach you, I have many talismans. Hee hee, as long as you have good souls, I can exchange all of it\u2026\u2026\u201d Pu\u2019s crimson tongue licked his lips, voice full of enticement.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo way!\u201d Zuo Mo suddenly relaxed. He sat down facing Pu Yao, stating: \u201cI\u2019m not interested in killing people.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Pu Yao raised a thin eyebrow, his eyes narrowing: \u201cYou have to think clearly. Other people\u2019s lives, how can they be as valuable as yours? Heehee, it actually is very simple to kill another. Oh, one soul and I will let you have a good comprehension of this sword essence and can teach you many things.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI just knew that you didn\u2019t have good intentions.\u201d Zuo Mo glared fixedly at Pu, coldly stating: \u201cPity you have the wrong plan.\u201d</p><br/><p>Pu Yao continued to chuckle.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo suddenly felt his body tighten and couldn\u2019t move.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m wrong?\u201d Pu Yao suddenly raise his voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, so many years, no one has ever dared to say I\u2019m wrong in front of me!\u201d</p><br/><p>He slowly walked in front of the unmovable Zuo Mo, his icy hands touching Zuo Mo\u2019s neck: \u201cAfraid? Hee hee, great! I really tried many kinds and found that terror is the best flavour in all of the souls. Did you know? Souls that died with great terror, it\u2019s like a beautiful wine that fermented perfectly. Just eating it once, ooh, it is unforgettable.\u201d</p><br/><p>A cold finger swiped across the blood vessel on Zuo Mo\u2019s neck, Pu Yao\u2019s expression was mirthful, the crimson red eyes flashed with craziness.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo\u2019s body shook. He kept telling himself not to be afraid, but terror was like a spring that couldn\u2019t be plugged, furiously sprouting out. No matter how he tried, his body wouldn\u2019t move.</p><br/><p>\u201cStruggle is useless.\u201d Pu Yao was still smiling, his eyes cold: \u201cYour stupidity really makes me disappointed. Didn\u2019t you know, pets need to realize that they are pets?\u201d</p><br/><p>He hated this feeling!</p><br/><p>Being manipulated, being controlled, his body not in control\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Something in Zuo Mo\u2019s heart seemed to have lit up. Terror was swiftly taken over by anger. His blood seemed to have be burning. He couldn\u2019t help swearing: \u201cGo to hell!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSuch a stubborn little thing.\u201d Pu Yao shook his head and smiled, his right hand gently squeezing.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh!\u201d Zuo Mo gave a wail. His entire person seemed to be bound by an invisible hand into a strange shape.</p><br/><p>The pain in his body was like countless thin needles piercing his body. His awareness started to dull.</p><br/><p>Just at that moment, a warm stream suddenly rose up from Zuo Mo\u2019s chest.</p><br/><p>\u201cWant to intefere?\u201d Pu Yao seemed to have found a naughty thing and his mouth had a light smile. His entire body suddenly disappeared from his spot and appeared next to Zuo Mo, his right hands easily thrusting into Zuo Mo\u2019s chest!</p><br/><p>Easily taking his hand out of Zuo Mo\u2019s chest, a five colored bead appeared between his fingers.</p><br/><p>This bead was the size of a mung bean. It looked like a rainbow glass, light swirling inside.</p><br/><p>Leisurely examining the small bead for a while, Pu muttered to himself: \u201cSo it was this thing.\u201d Finishing, he prepared to crush the bead.</p><br/><p>Just at this moment, his hand suddenly stopped moving.</p><br/><p>Wisps of black smoke spread from the gravestone, slow and solid. In the blink of an eye, the sky above the sea of flames was covered by black clouds.</p><br/><p>The dancing flames seemed to be quite afraid of these misty black clouds. They shrunk down, a rarely seen sight. The star that was in the sky was also robbed of light by the black clouds.</p><br/><p>Pu dazedly stood, motionless. An extremely complicated emotion floated in his bloody eye, seemingly sorrowful, seemingly happy, seemingly fond, seemingly furious\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>After a long time, he said lightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou really want to choose such a piece of rubbish?\u201d</p><br/><p>The black clouds moved, the layers roiling. The roaring sea of fire seemed to be suppressed, almost extinguishing while that star in the sky had almost completely disappeared.</p><br/><p>Pu Yao stood like a tree, seeming to not have registered it.</p><br/><p>The black clouds became even thicker. The entire sea of consciousness was now a patch of black, nothing could be seen.</p><br/><p>He suddenly sneered, the light flashing in his bloody right eye: \u201cYou do know that to want to persuade me, it isn\u2019t that simple.\u201d</p><br/><p>The surroundings became quiet. The black clouds didn\u2019t give a response and the two sides were deadlocked.</p><br/><p>After an unknown length of time, the light in Pu Yao\u2019s bloody right eyes gradually dimmed. He suddenly laughed lightly, and with the burdens of the ages, he shrugged helplessly: \u201cIt\u2019s always like this, so boring.\u201d</p><br/><p>His finger flicked and the glass bead in his hands entered Zuo Mo\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>The black clouds instantly clear without a trace to be found.</p><br/><p>The sea of fire that lost its suppressor started to once again burn fiercely. That star in the sky gave off light.</p><br/><p>Pu Yao stared at the gravestone for a long time without speaking.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo slowly woke up. When he opened his eyes, he hurriedly inspected his body. Seeing it uninjured, he finally gave a breath of relief.</p><br/><p>What had happened? Why did Pu Yao let go of him?</p><br/><p>Just when he was puzzled, Pu Yao suddenly appeared.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou really took a long time to wake up.\u201d Pu Yao\u2019s expression was full of mockery: \u201cSuch a fragile spirit. Originally, I had wanted to play. I hadn\u2019t bargained for a few thousand years. It ruined my fun. But it is normal. A person that doesn\u2019t have his features or mind, his heart naturally is also soft. I\u2019m so pitiful.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo was silent. His fists uncontrollably tightened.</p><br/><p>\u201cSpeaking about it, there is a place that has souls and you don\u2019t have to kill anyone. But it is very dangerous. How about it? Are you interested?\u201d Pu Yao\u2019s expression was leisurely.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat place?\u201d Zuo Mo asked in spite of himself. Just now, Pu Yao\u2019s words pierced his heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cHeehee, you don\u2019t need to know now. Don\u2019t worry, you don\u2019t need to kill anyone. You just have to say whether you agree or not. As to payment, when your conditions are enough, I naturally will let you be satisfied.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI agree.\u201d He didn\u2019t think about it further. Zuo Mo nodded. As long as he didn\u2019t have to kill anyone, he wasn\u2019t afraid of danger.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t have anything else to lose.</p><br/><p>\u201cAi, finally finished this transaction. For a few souls, this really wasn\u2019t easy. Business, not doing it for a long time, I really deteriorated.\u201d Pu Yao ruefully said in an experienced tone.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo didn\u2019t know what to say.</p><br/><p>Pu Yao turned his face over: \u201cAlright, let\u2019s discuss another transaction.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnother transaction?\u201d Zuo Mo was full of wariness and some puzzlement.</p><br/><p>\u201cJingshi, I require jingshi.\u201d Pu Yao chucked: \u201cWant to experience sword essence? Ten pieces of second grade jingshi each time. How about it, isn\u2019t it cheap?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo stared with a gaping mouth.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

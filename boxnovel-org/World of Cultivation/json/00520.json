No one knew that Turtle Island had achieved victory over the mo army. There were large numbers of xiuzhe gathered at the jie river and were preparing to flee Cloud Sea Jie.</p><br/><p>When Lil\u2019 Miss appeared with the troops, he instantly caused panic in these xiuzhe. Even the xiuzhe that occupied the gathering points on the jie river assumed that Turtle Island had been defeated. In panic, they instantly abandoned their bases to flee Cloud Sea Jie.</p><br/><p>Lil\u2019 Miss easily took over the bases on the jie river. There wasn\u2019t any conflict involved.</p><br/><p>Those xiuzhe that had been running away quickly reacted when they saw Lil\u2019 Miss take over the gathering places.</p><br/><p>Turtle Island had defeated the mo !</p><br/><p>As expected, the news of their victory was quickly proven. Everyone was overjoyed!</p><br/><p>At this time, control of Cloud Sea Jie landed completely in Zuo Mo\u2019s hands.</p><br/><p>They had become the true masters of Cloud Sea Jie.</p><br/><p>The xiuzhe that had been planning to escape returned to their homes. Without the mo army threat, who was willing to leave their homeland?</p><br/><p>Turtle Island\u2019s strength astounded everyone!</p><br/><p>At this time, which faction did not know of Zuo Mo\u2019s ambitions? But the situation had formed and they could not do a thing. Fight? The other could defeat the mo army. Wouldn\u2019t killing them be as easy as waving their hand?</p><br/><p>The factions that were not willing to be subordinate to Turtle Island left Cloud Sea Jie. However, many families that had deep local roots decided to stay in Cloud Sea Jie.</p><br/><p>Unexpected to Zuo Mo and Lil\u2019 Miss, the great majority of people decided to stay.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo later learned that most of the people in Cloud Sea Jie did not care who ruled them. Turtle Island\u2019s strength was also enough to protect them and for them to feel safe.</p><br/><p>With the Sky-Splitting Calamity, war was spreading everywhere. These days, the sound tablet continuously broadcasted areas that had become battlefields, which areas had been turned into a patch of scorched earth, or was filled with mountains of corpses. It seemed that within the span of one night, the xiuzhe world really entered a troubled era!</p><br/><p>In a troubled era, preserving their lives was enough to satisfy most people.</p><br/><p>But for Zuo Mo, this was just the beginning. He was extremely busy every day.</p><br/><p>The enormous Cloud Sea Jie was the largest piece of territory he had ever controlled. The responsibilities as master of a jie were novel and puzzling for Zuo Mo, an ignorant country bumpkin with unorthodox origins. The complex matters were piled up like mountains and caused him a headache. He did not know where to start.</p><br/><p>Out of helplessness, he could only ask Pu Yao and Wei.</p><br/><p>\u201cHm, now you see, I guessed this would happen long ago.\u201d Pu Yao did not reserve his disdain as a scornful smile hung on his face. \u201cThis guy is just a country bumpkin. He can manage some business that doesn\u2019t require long term investment. But to be a small time landlord, ha, he doesn\u2019t have the skill!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei did not pay attention to Pu Yao\u2019s disdain. He had a warm and friendly smile on his face. \u201cDid you encounter some trouble?\u201d</p><br/><p>Neither of these two were good people!</p><br/><p>In all of this, Zuo Mo was clear on this one point. Nothing more needed to be said about Pu Yao. He was an ungenerous person but Wei wasn\u2019t much better. He might look harmless and friendly, but his level of danger wasn\u2019t any lower than Pu Yao.</p><br/><p>He did not respond to Wei.</p><br/><p>He had to cause conflict between these two \u2026 \u2026</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo\u2019s eyes turned and he suddenly asked, \u201cPu Yao, how is your yao army?\u201d</p><br/><p>Pu Yao\u2019s expression instantly darkened. The anger in his bloody pupil roiled. Those damned talentless trash, idiots, garbage! Even when he used all his methods, the foundations of these people were too weak and they could not satisfy Pu Yao even now.</p><br/><p>\u201cYao army?\u201d Wei gave an interested smile. No wonder Pu Yao had been absent in this past while. So he had been working on a yao army.</p><br/><p>It seemed this guy still held a grudge over him stealing away Guard Camp!</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo disregarded Pu Yao\u2019s dark expression and said to himself, \u201cNo matter how powerful Ten Finger Prison is, it is only the Ten Finger Prison. It cannot solve all training problems.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUseless words!\u201d Pu Yao\u2019s voice was glacial and his expression was unfriendly. He knew that Zuo Mo was right. Ten Finger Prison was very effective but it also had its limitations. It could not replace true combat. At the beginning, Nan Yue and the others had improved quickly, but recently the effects of lacking combat training had started to show. Their rate of advancement had slowed down.</p><br/><p>But damn it, was the great Pu Yao Daren someone this boy could laugh at?</p><br/><p>It seemed that it had been too long since the boy was straightened out. This guy was becoming outrageous!</p><br/><p>Pu Yao was irritated. Just as he was going to punish Zuo Mo, Zuo Mo suddenly spoke, \u201cI have a good solution.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha!\u201d Pu Yao seemed to have heard a great joke and roared with laughter. He did not disguise his look full of disdain. \u201cYou, the country bumpkin, has a solution! This is too funny!\u201d</p><br/><p>Immune to Pu Yao\u2019s disdain since long ago, Zuo Mo\u2019s expression was unconcerned. \u201cYou can listen first and then laugh.\u201d</p><br/><p>Pu Yao\u2019s laughter suddenly stopped. He stared hard at Zuo Mo and a moment later, he squeezed out between his teeth, \u201cYou better have a solution. Otherwise, hee hee!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo said solemnly, \u201cMany chaos rifts have appeared in the Sky-Splitting Calamity. These chaos rifts have connected the worlds of yaomo and xiuzhe. It is correct for me to say so.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t waste words!\u201d Pu Yao said coldly.</p><br/><p>There was a faint smile on Wei\u2019s face. He sat motionlessly and listened carefully.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe yaomo and xiuzhe territories can be connected through the chaos rifts rather than travelling through Bloody Sky Metropolis Jie like in the past. The distance between the two sides has shortened!\u201d</p><br/><p>Just as Pu Yao was running out of patience, Zuo Mo suddenly said, \u201cMaybe we can create a transportation formation and transport Nan Yue and the others over here!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTransportation formation?\u201d Pu Yao paused and then had a thoughtful expression. A moment later, he shook his head. \u201cImpossible! We cannot determine their location!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou know that some transportation formations are composed of a yin and a yang component. What if we get Nan Yue and the others to set up the yin formation?\u201d Zuo Mo asked in response.</p><br/><p>Pu Yao\u2019s eyes suddenly lit up. He was an extremely smart person and instantly understood what Zuo Mo was thinking.</p><br/><p>These transportation formations were divided up into yin and yang formations with the two situated in different places. This way, the two formations could still connect and so there would be a passage. If Nan Yue and the others could set up a yin formation in the yao world, a yang formation set up here, that meant \u2026 \u2026</p><br/><p>The chaos rifts formed from the Sky-Splitting Calamity were actually natural transportation formations.</p><br/><p>Pu Yao quickly thought of the difficulty involved. He shook his head and said, \u201cThe transportation formations are too complex. None of the others understand formations.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe have sun seeds,\u201d Zuo Mo said proudly. \u201cThe sun seeds can enter the Ten Finger Prison and be taken out. We can engrave the transportation formation onto the sun seed and use the Ten Finger Prison to pass it to Nan Yue. Wouldn\u2019t that work?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHm, this idea is interesting!\u201d Pu Yao stilled and then had a pondering expression. A beat later, he said, \u201cWe need to try and find out.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo\u2019s idea was very daring.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can supply sun seeds to you. You can find Gu Ming Gong for the transportation formation. That guy is very clever,\u201d Zuo Mo said generously.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph!\u201d Pu Yao snorted, he did not respond to Zuo Mo. \u201cYou only have to assign the daily affairs of Cloud Sea Jie to those local powers and get them to take care of it. If they do it well, reward them. If they don\u2019t, they get punished. Gather their powerful xiuzhe and make a battalion with your people as the leaders. Adding on your own battalions, who can rebel?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo slapped his head and understood.</p><br/><p>Pu Yao just used a few words and smoothed everything out, pointing straight at the crux of the matter!</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo wasn\u2019t stupid. He had been bewilderment because he never had experience dealing with these matters before. After being guided today, he instantly understood!</p><br/><p>He left the sea of consciousness with excitement.</p><br/><p>From beginning to end, there was a faint smile on Wei\u2019s face. It was unknown what he was thinking.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>Shi Dong looked coldly at Ye Ling.</p><br/><p>Ye Ling was unaffected. \u201cDoes Shi Dong Daren have any questions?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat you say is true?\u201d Shi Dong coldly spat out, his hand on the mantis blade at his waist.</p><br/><p>\u201cCompletely true!\u201d Ye Ling said sincerely. \u201cAll of my subordinates saw Daren\u2019s Great Day mo physique. If Shi Dong Daren has any questions, you can ask any one of them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shi Dong\u2019s expression did not change. \u201cHis subordinates are xiuzhe!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are xiuzhe!\u201d Ye Ling corrected the mistake in Shi Dong\u2019s words, \u201cGuard Camp, which is the camp that my superior, Shu Long Daren commands, cultivates mo skills. Shi Dong Daren might have heard of the skill, [Hardship Guard]!</p><br/><p>\u201c[Hardship Guard!]\u201d Shi Dong\u2019s pupils suddenly contracted. Of course he had heard of this name. This mo skill was something usually cultivated by the guards of mo generals and had an extremely high in reputation.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, it is the [Hardship Guard] that most mo general\u2019s guards cultivate,\u201d Ye Ling said with a grave expression. \u201cBut the [Hardship Guard] that Shu Long Daren and his group cultivate has been modified by a very powerful daren and is based on the Great Day mo physique. It is called [Great Day Hardship Guard]!\u201d</p><br/><p>Shi Dong could not stop himself from showing shock.</p><br/><p>\u201cA daren that can use the Great Day mo physique to modify [Hardship Guard], could they possibly be xiuzhe?\u201d Ye Ling asked in response.</p><br/><p>Shi Dong was silent.</p><br/><p>He knew that Ye Ling was correct. Someone that had the ability to use the Great Day mo physique to modify [Hardship Guard] was a powerful elder who definitely had a profound understanding of mo skills. This kind of powerful person would not likely be a xiuzhe. This didn\u2019t just mean they couldn\u2019t be xiuzhe, they also could not be yao. There was only one possibility, it was a powerful mo, and an unusually powerful mo!</p><br/><p>\u201cCultivates the Great Day mo physique, has created a mo army, and has a mo elder of immeasurable power, I cannot think of an identity for Daren other than mo.\u201d Ye Ling was calm and wise.</p><br/><p>Shi Dong was silent for a moment before he asked, \u201cWhat about those xiuzhe?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is the xiuzhe world! Shi Dong Daren!\u201d Ye Ling reminded Shi Dong. \u201cA purely mo troop cannot survive here. Daren needs xiuzhe!\u201d</p><br/><p>Shi Dong gave a bitter smile. He was persuaded.</p><br/><p>He sat down dejectedly.</p><br/><p>Ye Long looked understandingly at Shi Dong. He said gently, \u201cI know what Shi Dong Daren is feeling. For you, surrendering is hard to accept, but if you look at it from the opposite angle, Shi Dong Daren, isn\u2019t this a great opportunity?\u201d</p><br/><p>He looked hard at Shi Dong and asked, emphasizing each word, \u201cShi Dong Daren, how many years has it been since there was a king arose from our Little Savage Jie?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shi Dong\u2019s body shook. He raised his head, his gaze as sharp as a knife. \u201cYou think he can become king?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaybe, maybe not.\u201d Ye Ling\u2019s tone was indifferent. \u201cBut Daren is the mo with the greatest potential to become king that I have ever seen!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you gambled everything?\u201d Shi Dong asked. His tone was filled with disdain.</p><br/><p>Ye Ling was unaffected and smiled as usual. \u201cWhat else do we have? Shi Dong Daren?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shi Dong became silent again.</p><br/><p>Translator Ramblings: Some days are just not worth getting up for if you knew what was going to happen. Why do people have such a high estimation of their own skills and then not admit their mistakes?</p><br/><p>In other news, more comedic banter between Pu Yao and Wei. Zuo Mo has now become a small landlord. Just one jie, not even one percent of the world!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

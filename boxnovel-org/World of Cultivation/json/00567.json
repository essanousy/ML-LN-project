It was very rare to see such an expression on the normally gentle city master. The atmosphere inside the hall was tense.</p><br/><p>\u201cI know that many people have come to the city for the Great Peace Treasure Pavilion and I do not care in whose hands it ends up. My teacher once said that everything is up to fate. However, I never thought that even the sword xiu of Kun Lun would infiltrate into Great Peace City. This is a shock to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shi Yue Yi\u2019s voice echoed in the large hall. Everyone had focused expressions and many showed expressions of shock. Shi Yue Yi was Shi Zi Ming\u2019s student and technically the successor of Great Peace Treasure Pavilion. So, it was a shock to many to hear him be so indifferent about it.</p><br/><p>\u201cGreat Peace Treasure Pavilion holds the product of my teacher\u2019s life long labor. I believe that no one can accept it ending up in the hands of xiuzhe. I have invited everyone here today to discuss how to eliminate these xiuzhe that have sneaked into Great Peace City. Here, I have to tell everyone that it isn\u2019t just Kun Lun that has come into Great Peace City, but all four great sects!\u201d</p><br/><p>When the words came out, there was a furor. Everyone had shocked expressions.</p><br/><p>\u201cGreat Peace City, it is us mo\u2019s Great Peace City! Great Peace Treasure Pavilion, it is us mo\u2019s Great Peace Treasure Pavilion!\u201d</p><br/><p>Shi Yue Yi\u2019s words were like steel.</p><br/><p>The people agreed and the crowd was furious.</p><br/><p>The decision was quickly made that the large factions would eliminate the xiuzhe led by Kun Lun and the one in command would be Princess Xia.</p><br/><p>Shi Yue Yi had recommended her and she received support from everyone else. Princess Xia was intelligent and cunning. She herself also represented the Anwei Family, and was the most suitable commander.</p><br/><p>An unprecedented mission quietly started.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>They still hadn\u2019t received any news about A Wen and the others. This made Zuo Mo very restless.</p><br/><p>\u201cDaren, Qi Diao Yu asks for a meeting!\u201d a subordinate reported.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo stilled. Qi Diao Yu? This guy had come to visit him?</p><br/><p>He turned to look at Ceng Lian\u2019er. Ceng Lian\u2019er shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><br/><p>He thought and then said, \u201cInvite him in.\u201d</p><br/><p>Taking this opportunity, Zuo Mo asked Pu Yao in the sea of consciousness, \u201cPu, what is this guy coming for?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPossibly for an alliance,\u201d Pu Yao said gravely. \u201cNo matter what, you do not need to worry.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo thought and found that the words were right. Even if Qi Diao Yu wanted to use force, Zuo Mo could completely suppress him while in this compound. With A Gui and Ceng Lian\u2019er, the two assistants present, adding on himself, there were three people. Zuo Mo did not believe they could not defeat Qi Diao Yu.</p><br/><p>He glanced at Wei. Ever since Wei saw the gravestone armor last time, he had sunk into silence. Zuo Mo speculated that Wei was thinking of past events. Or maybe he felt something after encountering one of his kind?</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo did not know how to comfort Wei.</p><br/><p>There was something that Pu Yao was right about. He really didn\u2019t have any interest in the gravestone armor. Even though he wasn\u2019t clear about what restraints the gravestone armor would place on him, but he was sure that there would be many restraints.</p><br/><p>He disliked being restricted.</p><br/><p>He quickly saw Qi Diao Yu. It had to be said that Qi Diao Yu had a very good appearance. With his snowy white robes and extraordinary beauty, his presence was stunning.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Qi hasn\u2019t changed at all!\u201d Zuo Mo insincerely gave a greeting.</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to make a deal.\u201d Qi Diao Yu did not waste a word and headed for the topic.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat deal?\u201d Zuo Mo also didn\u2019t mince words and asked straight out.</p><br/><p>Qi Diao Yu looked at Zuo Mo with star-like eyes. He said briskly, \u201cI will help you, and you will give me a copy of the stele inside the treasure pavilion.\u201d</p><br/><p>Now Zuo Mo was slightly surprised. He looked at the other and asked amusedly, \u201cHow do you know that I can enter the Great Peace Treasure Pavilion.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is not that you can, but you are the one most likely to,\u201d Qi Diao Yu explained.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo understood a bit. He smiled and said, \u201cThen what can you help me with?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can protect your life,\u201d Qi Diao Yu said.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo stared at Qi Diao Yu for a moment and then roared with laughter. \u201cAre you joking? Protect me? Can you beat her?\u201d He pointed at Ceng Lian\u2019er who was idly drinking tea by the side. Ceng Lian\u2019er focused on her tea and didn\u2019t even blink as though there was only empty air in front of her.</p><br/><p>Qi Diao Yu glanced at Ceng Lian\u2019er. \u201cWe are evenly matched.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo then pointed at A Gui. \u201cHer?\u201d</p><br/><p>A Gui was also unaffected. At the side, the black gold seal soldier, that glutton, lazily opened his eyes, examined Qi Diao Yu and then closed his eyes with a relaxed expression.</p><br/><p>Qi Diao Yu\u2019s gaze swept the black gold seal soldier. His eyelids flickered. \u201cWe will be evenly matched.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it, if you were very powerful, it would be fine if you make such a deal with me. But you don\u2019t even have the confidence to beat either of them. Even if I wanted to do business with you, I won\u2019t be able to get a good price.\u201d Zuo Mo said with an expression of regret. \u201cI already have two experts. If one more is added, it can increase my strength, but won\u2019t bring me up another level. Also, it is very hard for me to trust you. You are asking for too much, but giving too little. I, Xiao Mo Ge, won\u2019t do such unprofitable business.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have information.\u201d Qi Diao Yu forced himself to remain calm.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo spread his hands. \u201cBut you are not the only one with that information, while I am the only one.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo said the last phrase meaningfully. Originally, he had wanted to take leave of the brewing storm as quickly as possible. He hadn\u2019t expected A Wen and the others to disappear and force him to stay in this storm. Ever since he understood he became a key to entering the Great Peace Treasure Pavilion, he perceptively recognized the business potential here.</p><br/><p>What kind of business was the easiest to profit from? Of course it was the business where you had a monopoly!</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo did not have any ambitions about the Great Peace Treasure Pavilion. He knew that with so many eyes on them, whoever got the treasures would not be able to live.</p><br/><p>But he could take the chance to get rich. For those families, they wouldn\u2019t have any trouble paying a price to gain some advantages in this fight.</p><br/><p>So Zuo Mo unhesitatingly refused Qi Diao Yu\u2019s initial offer.</p><br/><p>What kind of joke was this!</p><br/><p>If his first transaction was so cheap, then the next customers definitely wouldn\u2019t give higher offers.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo seemed to have an instinctive obsession towards the pursuit of profit.</p><br/><p>Qi Diao Yu was silent. The reason he had come to find Zuo Mo today was that he detected this fight was becoming more cruel. He was just one person and couldn\u2019t affect the overall situation, so he thought of finding Zuo Mo to work together. He hadn\u2019t thought that Zuo Mo was more clever than he expected.</p><br/><p>There was a gentle and harmless smile on Zuo Mo\u2019s face. \u201cWhen you have a suitable offer, you can come find me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Diao Yu glanced at Zuo Mo and left without a word.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo smiled as he watched Qi Diao Yu leave.</p><br/><p>He knew that the news that Qi Diao Yu came here would spread over Great Peace City very soon.</p><br/><p>By that time, there would be even more customers.</p><br/><p>He really anticipated it.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo looked at the beautiful Princess Xia in front of him and grimaced. \u201cHow come it is you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t it be me?\u201d Princess Xia rolled her eyes. The unconscious flirtatious look would cause people\u2019s hearts to speed up.</p><br/><p>As Zuo Mo resisted the illusory art, he continued to grimace and said, \u201cI was waiting for the others to come \u2026 \u2026 and bleed them for a lot.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ha, Princess Xia laughed so hard her shoulders curled. Her finger pointed at Zuo Mo. \u201cYou are so bad \u2026 \u2026 so bad!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo said with a serious expression. \u201cThis is such a good chance. If I miss it, the heavens will strike me with lightning!\u201d</p><br/><p>Princess Xia laughed so much her hair dislodged from her hairdo. She panted slightly which added a hint of mature seductiveness. She brushed the hair that had fallen down on her forehead and said with a smile, \u201cDon\u2019t you have any ideas about the Great Peace Treasure Pavilion?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat is a matter for the big landlords to play with, I can\u2019t afford to play.\u201d Zuo Mo said with a matter-of-fact expression. \u201cIt is not worth it to lose my little life over that.\u201d</p><br/><p>A strange look flashed through Princess Xia\u2019s eyes. \u201cYou see it clearly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo said smugly, \u201cOf course. It would be unprofitable if I don\u2019t take the chance to make some more.\u201d But then his expression dropped. \u201cBut since you came, I cannot do that. I owe you a favor from last time, I can\u2019t do that to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Princess Xia smiled mischievously. \u201cI can\u2019t bear to use the favor for something like this.\u201d Then she copied Zuo Mo\u2019s tone. \u201cIt would be unprofitable!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy did you recommend me?\u201d Princess Xia suddenly asked something completely unrelated.</p><br/><p>\u201cRecommend you?\u201d Zuo Mo stilled.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t play dumb,\u201d Princess Xia said, \u201cCity Master told me that you recommended me to him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, that!\u201d Zuo Mo realized. \u201cBecause you are very strong!\u201d</p><br/><p>He added inside: especially in illusory arts \u2026 \u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cStrong?\u201d Princess Xia smiled. \u201cIn your mind, I am such a schemer?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo scratched. \u201cI just felt that you are relatively smart.\u201d Then he couldn\u2019t help say, \u201cYou definitely have to take those Kun Lun people down, don\u2019t let them escape.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWith your personality, you wouldn\u2019t chase after them like this. It seems that they have offended you greatly, there definitely is something else.\u201d Princess Xia looked smilingly at Zuo Mo.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo\u2019s heart shook. This woman was too smart. He had to be careful!</p><br/><p>He could only play dumb.</p><br/><p>The two talked about various topics. Princess Xia had extraordinary knowledge. Other than the illusory arts that were automatically cast which made it difficult, it was very pleasurable to talk with her.</p><br/><p>However, Zuo Mo didn\u2019t dare to drink this time.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Anwei Family is very interested in you.\u201d Finishing, she took out a mo weapon and placed it in front of Zuo Mo.</p><br/><p>This mo weapon was a short dagger-axe. It was completely red and at the horizontal blade, there was a black eye. It caused the entire weapon to seem eerie.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis Crow Eye Dagger-Axe was forged from the beak of a black fire crow mo through hundreds of years of refining. It is very powerful and a top notch mo weapon. Your mo skill is fire-type and this is suitable for you. How about it, are you satisfied?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo picked up the Crow Eye Dagger-axe. Immediately, a vicious and vast presence passed from the dagger-axe to his hand. He couldn\u2019t help but exclaim, \u201cA good mo weapon!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is a meeting gift from the Anwei Family, you do not need to return it.\u201d Princess Xia blinked her eyes at Zuo Mo and giggled. \u201cWith it as a good starting point, don\u2019t be kind when you bargain.\u201d</p><br/><p>Finishing, she waved at Zuo Mo and left.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo was speechless.</p><br/><p>Translator Ramblings: Monopoly \u2026 \u2026 Zuo Mo can set whatever price he wants.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

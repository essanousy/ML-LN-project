He then asked in anticipation. \u201cWhat mo physique do I have now? Is it powerful?\u201d</p><br/><p>Pu Yao\u2019s gaze was very strange.</p><br/><p>\u201cVery powerful,\u201d the one who spoke was Wei. Wei\u2019s expression was also very strange. \u201cYour present mo physique is called Ten Crow Celestial Apparatus, a very rare mo physique, one even rarer than the White Fang mo physique.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis powerful!\u201d Zuo Mo was overjoyed. Then he bent down his neck and said uncertainly, \u201cAre you sure? Wait, isn\u2019t the White Fang mo physique a general level mo physique?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have not remembered it wrong.\u201d Pu Yao\u2019s gaze became even stranger.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo stilled. After a while, he said slowly, \u201cGeneral level? I levelled up to general level?\u201d</p><br/><p>Pu Yao and Wei did not speak and only looked at Zuo Mo strangely as though they could observe something from Zuo Mo\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo was stunned by the news.</p><br/><p>General level!</p><br/><p>He had moved into the general level!</p><br/><p>This was \u2026 \u2026 too fantastical!</p><br/><p>His Great Day mo physique had been a colonel level mo physique. Zuo Mo had thought it had encountered some problem when it hadn\u2019t had a breakthrough after all this time. He hadn\u2019t expect to actually go past the brigadier level and go straight into general level.</p><br/><p>The difference between general level and brigadier level was the difference between yuanying and jindan. There were innate differences.</p><br/><p>This was not rational \u2026 \u2026 this was not rational! Zuo Mo thought dazedly.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt should be caused by the Sun Crystal Seed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd Greenvine Mystical Water and Soul Setting Divine Light!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat does Ten Crow Celestial Apparatus rank among the general level mo physiques? I don\u2019t quite remember it \u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThird!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing the discussion between Pu Yao and Wei, especially when he heard that Ten Crow Celestial Apparatus was ranked third, he shook and woke up. Zuo Mo grumbled, \u201cWhy isn\u2019t it second?\u201d</p><br/><p>Pu Yao and Wei turned, looking at him as though they were looking at an idiot.</p><br/><p>\u201cGreat Day mo physique was second in colonel level!\u201d Zuo Mo said righteously. \u201cFrom second to third, this is a step back!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIdiot!\u201d Pu Yao spat out a word.</p><br/><p>\u201cA person like this actually could cultivate the Ten Crow Celestial Apparatus \u2026 \u2026\u201d Wei\u2019s gaze was also as though he was looking at an idiot.</p><br/><p>\u201cI just said so, it was definitely because of the Sun crystal Seed. With a treasure like this, even an idiot can possess Ten Crow Celestial Apparatus.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are right \u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Pu Yao and Wei\u2019s disdain-filled discussion passed into his ears. Zuo Mo really could not resist. \u201cHey hey hey, speak clearer!\u201d</p><br/><p>After Pu Yao and Wei\u2019s detailed explanation, Zuo Mo had a general understanding.</p><br/><p>The leveling up of mo physiques would not have too much of a correlation with the initial rank. For example, while Great Day mo physique was second among colonel level, but there was more than one path it could level up through. The difference between each of the leveled up mo physiques was large, and Ten Crow Celestial Apparatus was the best level up path for Great Day mo physique.</p><br/><p>According to Pu Yao and Wei, they felt that the reason he had reached Ten Crow Celestial Apparatus was directly connected to the Sun Crystal Seed inside of him, and also the Sun shen power he cultivated. Even the Greenvine Mystical Water and the Soul Setting Divine Light were hugely influential. Otherwise, with Zuo Mo\u2019s present power, the best outcome of leveling up would be the Light Manifestation mo physique that ranked seventh in the brigadier level.</p><br/><p>After listening carefully, Zuo Mo understood.</p><br/><p>However, he did not care if the cause was the Sun Crystal Seed. What he cared about was ranking third in general level!</p><br/><p>Having seen the power of the White Fang mo physique that ranked sixteenth in general level, Ten Crow Celestial Apparatus that ranked third should be even stronger!</p><br/><p>Ten Crow Celestial Apparatus?</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo recited inside. His gaze looked unconsciously towards A Gui.</p><br/><p>A Gui, I now have the Ten Crow Celestial Apparatus, I will become even stronger!</p><br/><p>Gripping A Gui\u2019s hand, Zuo Mo went back to his cultivation.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t want to waste one bit of time.</p><br/><p>Ranking third in general level, Ten Crow Celestial Apparatus, if he could drag out all the power of such a powerful mo physique, the chances of surviving a trip to the Nether Spring Jie should grow much higher!</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo pondered this. .</p><br/><p>Watching the furiously cultivating Zuo Mo, Pu Yao and Wei were silent.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s working very hard,\u201d Wei suddenly said.</p><br/><p>Pu Yao looked at Zuo Mo and seemed to be thinking. His bloody pupil was deep and his emotions were complex.</p><br/><p>A moment later, he suddenly spoke, \u201cI\u2019ve decided to help him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn which way?\u201d Wei raised his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cUsing everything I can do.\u201d Pu Yao raised his head. \u201cYou were right last time, we have to settle our accounts!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>Gongsun Cha laid on the bed and his thoughts wandered as he stared at the ceiling.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo Shixiong had passed information on everything that happened recently back to Turtle Island. There was nothing concealed. Each of them had read all of it.</p><br/><p>No one had ever thought that Shixiong\u2019s history was so wondrous and so tragic!</p><br/><p>Even though they didn\u2019t have a complete picture but just the information they had now was enough for them, people who had been through many battles, to smell the thick tang of blood.</p><br/><p>Shixiong\u2019s present mood was probably \u2026 \u2026</p><br/><p>No, he couldn\u2019t let Shixiong fight alone, he had to do something!</p><br/><p>Gongsun Cha suddenly sat up straight! A moment later, a smile suddenly rose in the clear eyes of the neighbor\u2019s boy. In the depths, fighting spirit rose like flowers on the wind.</p><br/><p>They had always fought side by side!</p><br/><p>The Dark of Hundred Savage \u2026 \u2026 it really was a challenge!</p><br/><p>His spirit burned and his blood was nearly boiling, but Lil\u2019 Miss\u2019 mind was unusually calm. He started to ponder how to actualize his intent.</p><br/><p>He definitely could come up with the most suitable strategic plan!</p><br/><p>\u201cDaren!\u201d The guard outside knocked on the door.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Interrupted, Lil\u2019 Miss frowned.</p><br/><p>The guard came in and handed Lil\u2019 Miss a jade scroll. He reported, \u201cJust now, Wei Sheng Daren came and delivered a jade scroll. He said to give it to Daren.\u201d</p><br/><p>Eldest Shixiong? Lil\u2019 Miss stilled.</p><br/><p>He picked up the jade scroll. A moment later, he wore a grimace.</p><br/><p>Eldest Shixiong had gone by himself to search for Zuo Mo Shixiong!</p><br/><p>\u201cTo Gongsun Shidi \u2026 \u2026 brotherhood and friendship, one needs to remain true, I am unable to stand by and watch \u2026 \u2026 heart of a sort, can safely strike and be safe \u2026 \u2026 know that this one\u2019s strength is not enough, so I bid farewell! I go to the mo world, using fighting to cultivate,kill mo to temper the sword \u2026 \u2026 if I am not dead, and reach the Nether Spring \u2026 I will lend the strength of one sword!\u201d</p><br/><p>In the jade scroll, Wei Sheng\u2019s voice was indifferent and filled with decisiveness.</p><br/><p>\u201cCrazy!\u201d Lil\u2019 Miss murmured.</p><br/><p>Raising his head, his bangs swayed despite the lack of wind. A bashful smile hung on Lil\u2019 Miss\u2019 face.</p><br/><p>\u201cHah, let\u2019s be crazy together!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>Turtle Island\u2019s atmosphere suddenly became tense.</p><br/><p>The intensity of Vermillion Bird Camp\u2019s and Guard Camp\u2019s training was increased to unprecedented level. The tense atmosphere allowed everyone to understand, something had happened! It quickly spread in the two camps that Zuo Mo Daren had encountered trouble!</p><br/><p>Vermillion Bird Camp and Guard Camp had followed Zuo Mo from Little Mountain Jie and their bond was deep. Hearing that Daren had encountered trouble, and there were no orders to move out, only orders telling them to train, the group understood that their current strength was not enough to resolve the trouble for Daren.</p><br/><p>Without needing any urging, the two camps started to cultivate more furiously.</p><br/><p>The large families in Cloud Sea Jie quickly received orders. A new camp, Green Dragon Camp, was going to be set up and was requesting each family to send outstanding disciples to the recruitment. The families with disciples selected would receive more benefits.</p><br/><p>This order caused a great wave in Cloud Sea Jie. As the Great Thousand Island Formation expanded day by day, every family knew that Turtle Island\u2019s rule of Cloud Sea Jie was unbreakable. Only by responding to Turtle Island\u2019s orders would they receive more benefits in the future.</p><br/><p>Countless accomplished youths flooded towards Turtle Island.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>When Shi Dong received the order, he was slightly puzzled.</p><br/><p>His progression speeded far surpassed his own expectations. However, he had not expected that Lil\u2019 Miss Daren was still unsatisfied and ordered him to speed up his advance.</p><br/><p>Other than this, he was also shocked that Lil\u2019 Miss Daren allowed him the right to expand Grey Camp.</p><br/><p>Someone major probably happened!</p><br/><p>Shi Dong\u2019s temper was not the best but he was a smart person. The first he thought of was Zuo Mo Daren.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo Daren \u2026 \u2026 that daren that Ye Ling said could become king \u2026 \u2026</p><br/><p>He thought for a moment before sending down the order to expand the troops. He then ordered an increase in training intensity.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid something happen? Daren!\u201d his subordinate asked suspiciously.</p><br/><p>\u201cZuo Mo Daren might have encountered some trouble,\u201d Shi Dong explained.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh! Our King Daren encountered trouble!\u201d the subordinate paled and asked urgently, \u201cIs it great trouble? Is there danger? Do we need to go reinforce him?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shi Dong was surprised by the subordinate\u2019s fierce response, \u201cYou are very rushed?\u201d</p><br/><p>The subordinate stilled and said unhesitatingly, \u201cOf course, that is our king!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou feel that he can become king?\u201d Shi Dong asked something that had puzzled him for a long time.</p><br/><p>\u201cDefinitely!\u201d the subordinate balled his fist and had a serious expression. \u201cWe all believe he can!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo it\u2019s like this \u2026 \u2026\u201d Shi Dong was thoughtful.</p><br/><p>The subordinate charged outside without even bowing to Shi Dong. He had to pass along this news as fast as he could!</p><br/><p>All hail the king!</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>\u201cThese are the mo matrixes that Daren has sent, as well as some of his own conclusions regarding the topic.\u201d Master Sun Bao looked at the people below and said gravely, \u201cDuring this period of time, everyone will need to put aside all other work, and work on the mo matrixes!\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone nodded but were slightly astounded. It had to be said that while the missions of Golden Crow Camp were difficult and demanding, the atmosphere was free. The two masters generally allowed everyone to explore their own projects and would only gather everyone\u2019s power during some special missions.</p><br/><p>Had something happened?</p><br/><p>Everyone was puzzled.</p><br/><p>Master Ji Wei\u2019s expression was also very grave. He was handing out jade scrolls.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, did something happen?\u201d someone asked.</p><br/><p>Everyone\u2019s gaze gathered on Master Sun Bao.</p><br/><p>\u201cDaren encountered some danger,\u201d Master Sun Bao said in a deep voice, \u201cand needs our help.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was deathly silent. A second later, it exploded!</p><br/><p>\u201cDaren encountered danger?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn it! Did the other groups go play and not fulfill their responsibilities? Where is Lil\u2019 Miss Daren?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHeavens! This isn\u2019t true \u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>These young production xiuzhe were furiously and wanted to charge out.</p><br/><p>That was Daren! Daren who all of Golden Crow Camp had sworn an oath to forever follow. No one would forget who had passed on spells and techniques, who had given them Golden Crow Fire, Why they did not have to worry for the clothing on their back, and could even do whatever they wanted. They remembered who gave them all this!</p><br/><p>Damn it!</p><br/><p>\u201cShut up!\u201d Master Ji Wei\u2019s shout caused everyone to stop talking.</p><br/><p>Master Sun Bao didn\u2019t have any trace of a smile. There seemed to be fire flickering in his gaze. \u201cEveryone, make use of the time and study the jade scrolls. Inside are the conclusion and studies Daren has relating to the mo matrixes. We need to understand all the problems in the shortest amount of time!\u201d</p><br/><p>There seemed to be a fire burning in everyone\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd then, we will start engraving mo matrixes!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is a war!\u201d</p><br/><p>Translator Ramblings: We are going to get two points of view in the next recent while and both viewpoints are important. So don\u2019t skip Gongsun Cha\u2019s sections.</p><br/><p>Mo are just pokemon in disguise \u2026 \u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

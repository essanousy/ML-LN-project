He finally recalled that he and Shixiong had drank all night and apparently had gone crazy later on, singing and dancing. He didn\u2019t even know how they had finally passed out.</p><br/><p>He struggled up and walked out of the room. The outside was still misty.</p><br/><p>Not far away, Xie Shan was respectfully asking Wei Sheng for advice. He occasionally nodded and was as obedient as an underling. Zuo Mo lifted the corners of his mouth and silently snickered. It must have been that Shixiong\u2019s worldly apparition that had had deeply shocked Xie Shan.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo did not disturb the two and randomly walked about. The five slave transporting boats were placed apart and formed an enormous circle around the campsite.</p><br/><p>Having suddenly added a strong member, everyone\u2019s morale grew. They put even more effort into their daily cultivation. The worldly apparition when Wei Sheng had his breakthrough hadn\u2019t shocked just Xie Shan.</p><br/><p>A Wen had awoken. Thinking about how the fiend soul beast had forced him into such a state, and especially in front of Boss, he was very dejected. Starting early in the morning, he started to run around the campsite wanting to encounter another fiend soul beast to defeat. The warlike Tenth Grade was not willing to fall back and tightly followed behind.</p><br/><p>Lil\u2019 Pagoda and Lil\u2019 Fire affectionately nudged A Gui. A Gui was wooden and would only respond once in a while. Whenever it happened, Lil\u2019 Fire and Lil\u2019 Pagoda would be very excited. Silly Bird raised her head high, and stalked around with her unique bird walk as she passed majestically beside Zuo Mo without even glancing at him. For some unknown reason, Zuo Mo\u2019s heart was filled with warmth. His mood seemed full of sunlight and was unusually bright. Even the blood-red sky seemed to become much more amicable.</p><br/><p>He suddenly remembered that the fiend soul beast A Wen had killed had left behind a paw and a bead. He hurriedly took them out. The paw was as hard as steel, deep black and shiny. The claws on the paw were especially sharp. When he gently swiped it against the ground, it created five deep scratches. With Zuo Mo\u2019s eyes, he was unable to distinguish what kind of material it was.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is a fiend heavy weapon, very rare. It is a natural weapon. It is the first time I have seen a fiend heavy weapon of such quality. You brat, you really have good luck. Only a vicious fiendish land sealed for tens of thousands of years like this can form such powerful fiend soul beasts, and produce these kind of fiend heavy weapons.\u201d</p><br/><p>Pu Yao was filled with emotion.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo waved the paw around a bit, and felt it was not very comfortable. He said, \u201cThis is probably worth a lot of jingshi.\u201d</p><br/><p>The emotional Pu Yao stopped breathing. His temple throbbed. He forcibly suppressed himself. \u201cThis isn\u2019t for xiuzhe use, it\u2019s for yao.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo was very disappointed, and his expression was disinterested. If something could not be traded for jingshi, how could it be considered good? He had so many subordinates that cultivated a mo skills, but there were none that cultivate the yao arts. Wait, he suddenly thought of the flower slaves in Guard Camp. Didn\u2019t they cultivate yao arts?</p><br/><p>\u201cThey can\u2019t use them.\u201d Pu Yao finally learned the joy of beating down Zuo Mo\u2019s hopes, and drawled, \u201cWhat they cultivate is the [Flower Yao Coexistence Art]. Their weapon is the ling flower in their bodies. Oh, they should be called yao flowers now. Fiend heavy weapons are vicious things, they are not something that normal yao can use.\u201d</p><br/><p>Could not be traded for jingshi, none of his subordinates could use it, and neither could normal yao \u2026 \u2026</p><br/><p>Was this just trash?\u201d</p><br/><p>Without another words, Zuo Mo threw it into the ring, and picked up the bead.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm, this is something good!\u201d Zuo Mo became alert. He didn\u2019t understand something like the fiend heavy weapon, but he could recognize this bead.</p><br/><p>Normal fiend souls would have a thread of soul base source. How could fiend soul beasts not have any? This bead was their core, and inside was a huge amount of soul base essence that was extremely pure. Upon further thought, Zuo Mo understood. These fiend soul beasts were formed from fiend souls. They consumed other fiend souls and continuously grew. It would take at least a hundred thousand fiend souls to form a fiend soul beast. Fiend souls beasts had a basic intelligence and instinctively understood how to cultivate the rudimentary spells of the fiendish energy.</p><br/><p>No one had disturbed this ancient battlefield for tens of thousands of years. The fiend souls formed here had experienced the cruelest slaughter. It could be imagined how strong their soul was.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo instantly found that the \u201cfishing\u201d they had been so proud of before was really very inefficient and idiotic \u2026 \u2026</p><br/><p>Out of the corner of his eyes, he coincidentally saw Gongsun Cha coming over. His body flashed and he jumped next to Gongsun Cha. Before Gongsun Cha could relax, he shoved the bead into Gongsun Cha\u2019s mouth.</p><br/><p>With a moment of inattentiveness, Gongsun Cha\u2019s eyes bulged out as he was tricked. One breath later, Lil\u2019 Miss\u2019 shy face that originally had a faint blush became completely red.</p><br/><p>Gongsun Cha\u2019s entire body quickly became red. He pointed with a trembling finger at Zuo Mo but could not say a word.</p><br/><p>His eyes suddenly widened, and then he ran away.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha!\u201d</p><br/><p>Behind him was Zuo Mo\u2019s heartless laughter.</p><br/><p>The fiend heavy weapon was useless, the core bead was used to trick Lil\u2019 Miss, Zuo Mo suddenly felt that there was nothing to do. The troop was temporarily resting at this spot. Through Shixiong\u2019s description, Zuo Mo knew that the size of this fiendish mist surpassed his imagination. The native beings that he had originally thought were present turned out to be Eldest Shixiong. Now he wasn\u2019t in a rush to advance.</p><br/><p>\u201cGolden soul! Did you forget Golden Soul?\u201d Pu Yao couldn\u2019t resist reminding.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo hit his head. Right, how could he forget that matter.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>Yi Zheng\u2019s shock grew. He might not be a core disciple of Great Buddha Temple, but he had rudimentary knowledge. Great Buddha Temple was already a strong sect in their jie but \u2026 \u2026</p><br/><p>His eyes swept across those xiuzhe working hard at their cultivation. Even though it was not the first time he saw them, his heart couldn\u2019t resist jumping. The cultivations of these xiuzhe were not high, and their ningmai cultivation were comparable to the normal disciples of the temple. However, if the disciples of the temple had a conflict with these group of people, not even their bones would remain!</p><br/><p>This was killing intent!</p><br/><p>Killing energy that made his heart beat rapidly. Elite! This word suddenly jumped into his head. Only those elite that had experienced hundreds of bloody fights would have such concentrated killing energy.</p><br/><p>The temple also had these kind of elite dhyana soldiers. He had seen them before. Those dhyana soldiers did not have high individual cultivation. One would only know how strong they were only when one fought them. They were vicious and battle hardened, and did not care about sustaining wounds. Yi Zheng had once been completely suppressed by a dhyana soldier with a cultivation lower than his own. In the following five on five match, they had not even lasted for twenty breaths before they lost.</p><br/><p>If it wasn\u2019t that it was a match with the sect, they would have died.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis shixiong, greetings.\u201d</p><br/><p>A warm and gentle voice sounded from behind him.</p><br/><p>Yi Zheng\u2019s mind shifted. Turning around, joy instantly came onto his face. He was facing a dhyana xiu. This troop actually had dhyana xiu! Yi Zheng carefully examined the other. Even though the other was not wearing a monk robe and a kasaya, but the trace of a dhyana xiu aura could not be faked. He instantly felt much closer to the other and hurriedly returned the greeting. \u201cThis little monk gives greetings!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis little brother is Zong Ru. If Shixiong has any matters, you can find me.\u201d Zong Ru had a faint smile hanging on his face.</p><br/><p>Yi Zheng felt astonished inside. The other\u2019s cultivation was not lower than his. Dhyana xiu emphasized their Samadhi skill the most. He gave a slight smile as well, and bowed deeply. \u201cShixiong is too courteous. This little brother is of low cultivation, I am currently lost and in need of help. Please, Shixiong, take care of me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone is together in this dangerous land. Helping each other is rational.\u201d Zong Ru smiled and waved his right hand. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we go this little brother\u2019s room. If Shixiong has any questions, please ask there.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d Yi Zheng hurriedly said.</p><br/><p>He followed behind Zong Ru and walked as xiuzhe occasionally bowed to Zong Ru along the way. He thought inside, it seemed that this Zong Ru Shixiong had a high status among this group.</p><br/><p>Zong Ru\u2019s room was very simple. Other than the two meditation mats, there were no other objects.</p><br/><p>\u201cA simple place, you have seen a joke,\u201d Zong Ru said with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, no! Shixiong\u2019s place is perfect for the serene Samadhi path. This little brother feels admiration,\u201d Yi Zheng hurriedly said.</p><br/><p>Zong Ru smiled. \u201cWhich sect does Shixiong come from? Where did you cultivate before?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yi Zheng thought inside that the true aim had come out. He answered, \u201cThis little monk is a disciple from Great Buddha Temple, and cultivated at He Residence Mountain before.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGreat Buddha Temple?\u201d Zong Ru made a sound and suddenly thought of something. He asked with shock, \u201cGreat Buddha Temple of Temple Sea Jie.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShixiong knows this humble temple?\u201d Yi Zheng slightly let out a breath at the other\u2019s shock. To his shock, he found that everything he had seen in this day and night had unconsciously put pressure on him.</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha, the honored temple\u2019s [Great Buddha Dhyana Records] is one of the Eight Great Dhyana records of Xuan Kong Territoires and is renowned. This little brother may be sheltered and ignorant but still knows the honored Great Buddha Temple.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yi Zheng did not feel any smugness. If it really was like the other had said, Zong Ru would not have made a sound like he did. His mind shifted. \u201cWhere did Shixiong learn?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zong Ru gave a reminiscent expression. He said with a smile, \u201cSpeaking of that, I\u2019m not afraid Shixiong would laugh. This one has no teacher. This one only encountered a master in the past that passed on some basic dhyana spells.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yi Zheng did not believe it. Zong Ru\u2019s cultivation was clearly not weaker than his, and his Samadhi skill was even deeper. The study of any other spells could have the possibility of a shortcut, but not Samadhi. Even if it was a fundamental, but there was no room for shortcuts. Zong Ru\u2019s ling power ripples were as deep and steady as the ocean. His Samadhi skill was clearly very high.</p><br/><p>Seeing Yi Zheng\u2019s expression, Zong Ru understood. He did not explain. \u201cShixiong has come from the Xuan Kong Territories, we have come from the Kun Lun Territoires. There are thousands of li between us. It is a matter of dhyana karma that we have met on this ancient battlefield.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yi Zheng nodded. \u201cShixiong\u2019s words are great kindness!\u201d He already believed the words. Almost all the dhyana xiu temples of the world gathered in the Xuan Kong Territories. The Kun Lun Territories were famed for their sword xiu. He had never heard of them having a large dhyana xiu temple.</p><br/><p>Upon closer examination, he found that while Zong Ru had deep dhyana cultivation, but it was possible to see signs of age and hardship between the brows. He clearly had gone through hardships in his cultivation. The dhyana xiu disciples of large temples did not like luxury, but they did not have to worry about material things. They could rest their hearts and cultivate their dhyana, and it was rare for them to have hard times.</p><br/><p>He suddenly thought of the \u201cancient battlefield\u201d that Zong Ru had just mentioned, and couldn\u2019t help but ask, \u201cThis is an ancient battlefield?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEn. We came in from the outer fringes, and saw many corpses and bones along the way. But it has been too long, and they would disintegrate when touched. Daren said that this ancient battlefield is tens of thousands of years old.\u201d Zong Ru did not conceal it.</p><br/><p>\u201cTens of thousands of years?\u201d Yi Zheng\u2019s expression shifted, and then he sank into thousand, \u201cTen thousand years \u2026 \u2026 ancient battlefield \u2026 \u2026 ancient battlefield \u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The Great Buddha Temple was one of the Eight Great Temples. With a long history, it had many temple records. He thought back and tried to recall what records would match this.</p><br/><p>Seeing Yi Zheng in deep thought, Zong Ru did not hurry him and patiently waited.</p><br/><p>A long while later, Yi Zheng suddenly murmured in a low voice, \u201cCan it be \u2026 \u2026 can it be \u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Deep terror suddenly appeared in his eyes.</p><br/><p>Translator Ramblings: Zuo Mo is so nice to Lil\u2019 Miss. Pu Yao wants his golden souls.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

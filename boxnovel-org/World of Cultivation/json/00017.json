Just the slightest bit of outside force and he would move.</p><br/><p>He took a deep breath. Even though he had broken through to the second breath of [Embryonic Breathing Spiritual Cultivation] and didn\u2019t need to use his nose and mouth to breathe, but when he was nervous, he still unconsciously followed the familiar pattern of breathing to calm his emotions. Letting his mind settle, he gave a deep bow to the wooden door of the grass hut, \u201cDisciple Zuo Mo greets Shibo!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCome in!\u201d Xin Yan Shibo\u2019s icy voice came out of the grass hut.</p><br/><p>The wooden door opened silently. The inside of the hut was a patch of darkness. Zuo Mo\u2019s heart couldn\u2019t help but tense up once again. He gathered his courage and walked in.</p><br/><p>The interior of the grass hut was extremely crude. There was only a meditation mat, other than that, there was nothing else. Xin Yan Shibo was sitting on the meditation mat, a small stream of sunlight entering the grass hut and falling onto Xin Yan Shibo\u2019s body. Shibo\u2019s body was under the sun but his face was shadowed by the hair in front of his forehead and couldn\u2019t be seen clearly until he opened his eyes.</p><br/><p>In the shadow, two dots of ice suddenly lit up. For some unknown reason, Zuo Mo felt a bone-aching cold flow from the tail of spine upwards, all the muscles in his body paralyzed.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are a surprise to me.\u201d Xin Yan\u2019s voice was like a cold mist, permeating through Zuo Mo\u2019s skin into his heart, so cold that he almost couldn\u2019t move.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have any talent at the sword.\u201d Xin Yan said calmly.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo\u2019s heart suddenly tensed. He felt that he almost forgot to breathe at this instant. Terror, like the flood overcoming the dam, instantly broke through Zuo Mo\u2019s psychological defenses. Did Shibo find out?</p><br/><p>\u201cYou could comprehend sword essence in three months, that surprised me.\u201d Xin Yan didn\u2019t look at Zuo Mo. He slowly closed his eyes, the two dots of ice disappearing into the shadows, \u201cI\u2019m not concerned with what fortuitous encounters you had, but you have to remember, if you do anything against the sect in the future, I will kill you with my sword.\u201d</p><br/><p>The tone was calm, as though it was narrating a simple matter.</p><br/><p>It was like Zuo Mo suddenly rose from hell into heaven. This joyful surprise stunned him for a moment. He had already prepared to stretch out his neck to be killed. He had assumed that Second Shibo had already seen through him, and seen that Pu Yao was in his consciousness.</p><br/><p>The tense muscles on his body instantly relaxed. Zuo Mo felt his body was weak, the lingering fears in his heart like a flood, almost swallowing him. His feet were sore and weak.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d Zuo Mo hurriedly answered, his mind slightly steadier.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe [Li Water Sword Scripture] that you cultivate is unique but is limited by the knowledge of the author and it would be hard for it to improve further in the future.\u201d Xin Yan didn\u2019t open his eyes as he said calmly, \u201cAnd your fundamentals are too weak. Several places need to be changed. However, the places that you changed yourself, they weren\u2019t bad.\u201d</p><br/><p>Afterwards, Xin Yan pointed out a few spots. Zuo Mo, now having calmed down, was delighted and willing. The places that Shibo pointed out, it was exactly the places that he felt were uncomfortable and didn\u2019t flow properly, but he hadn\u2019t known how to change it. Hearing Shibo\u2019s advice, he instantly understood.</p><br/><p>After that, Xin Yan Shibo threw a jade scroll to Zuo Mo, \u201cThese are some basic sword scriptures. Practice them more.\u201d Pausing, he said with a hint of regret, \u201cYour primary focus is dan-making, and you\u2019re also a ling plant farmer. You are not suited to cultivate the sword. For sword xiu, what is important is not to be distracted by other matters, the clear heart sword. You, try to do your best.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bidding farewell to Shibo, when Zuo Mo passed over the mud in front of the grass hut, he didn\u2019t feel any of the sword essence that had been there previously. Just like those sword essences knew him and hid themselves.</p><br/><p>On the road from Sun Lookout Peak to Little West Wind Yard, Zuo Mo had been pondering Shibo\u2019s words. Shibo\u2019s meaning was extremely clear. If he wanted to progress another step on the road of the sword xiu, and really accomplish something, he must abandon being a ling plant farmer and dan-making, and only practice the sword. Otherwise, he would find it hard to progress further on the sword.</p><br/><p>Shibo\u2019s words were as clear as they could be, but Zuo Mo knew what he was worth.</p><br/><p>If he was like Wei Sheng Shixiong, he might abandon everything and be a pure sword xiu but he wasn\u2019t. He knew just how much talent he had. If he didn\u2019t have Pu Yao, he basically couldn\u2019t have been able to comprehend sword essence. He had been sliced several thousand times before he had comprehended Shibo\u2019s tidal sword essence. If it had been Wei Sheng Shixiong, he would have needed only a few dozen before he could have comprehended it.</p><br/><p>If he didn\u2019t have the experience of comprehending the tidal sword essence, he certainly wouldn\u2019t have been able to comprehend the li water sword essence in three months.</p><br/><p>He was fated to not walk Wei Sheng Shixiong\u2019s path!</p><br/><p>As he walked with the wind blowing gently in his face, Zuo Mo\u2019s mood rose. The road each person walked was different. Even more, the progress he had made was something he didn\u2019t dare to even think of before. Yet now, he had made it.</p><br/><p>His mood recovered quickly. After the rise and fall in his emotions today, his body felt slightly exhausted. He needed rest.</p><br/><p>However, when he walked to the mouth of the West Wind Valley, his feet stopped and he paused on this spot.</p><br/><p>\u201cAi ya! Zuo Mo Shixiong, you finally came! Shixiong was so strong in the sect assessment, Shidi has come to especially give congratulations, just a humble gift\u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDoes Shixiong still remember me? That year, if it wasn\u2019t for your [Little Art of Cloud and Rain], I would have been homeless. This little brother still remembers it\u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShixiong Shixiong, this little brother cultivates the sword, but doesn\u2019t have a master\u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShixiong, us sisters from the Eastern Peak\u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking at the dense mass of people, Zuo Mo\u2019s head rang.</p><br/><p>The entrance of West Wind Valley was filled to the limit. This scene, it was even busier than the last time when Zuo Mo had been promoted to an inner sect disciple. Even the gifts they had prepared were higher quality than last time. Some outer sect disciples that had good family backgrounds had really spent a lot.</p><br/><p>Desperately needing rest, Zuo Mo felt his head was going to explode.</p><br/><p>\u201cStop the noise!\u201d Suddenly, a voice passed over, and everyone instantly quieted.</p><br/><p>Xu Yi had accompanied two females over. Zuo Mo saw clearly that it was Eldest Shijie Gong Sun Qing and Xu Yi Xia Shijie. The one that had spoken was Xu Yi Shixiong. Xu Yi waved his hand, \u201cLeave.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing the situation, the outer sect disciples scattered like birds.</p><br/><p>Xu Yi bowed to Zuo Mo and said, \u201cShidi, don\u2019t blame me for overstepping. It really is too noisy with all these people here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo hurriedly returned the bow, \u201cMany thanks, Shixiong. This little brother\u2019s eyes are already dizzy. If Shixiong had been just a moment late, this little brother would have been dead right here.\u201d Then he bowed towards Gong Sun Qing and Xu Yi Xia, \u201cEldest Shijie, Yi Xia Shijie!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHee! You are actually somewhat interesting~a!\u201d A green-clad Xu Yi Xia laughed.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo was deeply cautious and alert towards this innocent-looking girl. Li Ying Feng Shijie said that the jade scroll had been from Xu Yi Xia Shijie. What the intentions were at that time of giving him that jade scroll were hard to tell.</p><br/><p>Gong Sun Qing smiled warmly, responding, \u201cShidi looks very tired. Why don\u2019t we come another day?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is Shijie saying, come come come. Everyone come in and have some tea.\u201d Zuo Mo hurriedly said and then made a joke, \u201cBut I don\u2019t have Shixiong\u2019s ling tea. Please don\u2019t blame me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone started moving towards the valley. Each person made with a pondering expression as their eyes encountered the ruined jinzhi scattered on the ground,. They had heard earlier on that Luo Li had gone to challenge Zuo Mo at the valley, the news was passed furiously through Wu Kong Sword Sect. Thinking about the match that neither of the two had won, all three of them had their own thoughts.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo didn\u2019t have any expression. In fact, he couldn\u2019t make expressions. That zombie face couldn\u2019t hold any expressions.</p><br/><p>Entering the West Wind Yard and seeing Zuo Mo return, the grey beaked goose on the roof made a call as though she was giving a greeting. Just having escaped death, Zuo Mo\u2019s mood was very good and he waved his hand in greeting to the female bird.</p><br/><p>Gong Sun Qing saw Zuo Mo\u2019s youthful actions and couldn\u2019t help but grin.</p><br/><p>Xu Yi Xia only took a glance. Seeing it was only just a normal grey beaked goose, she looked away with a hint of disdain in her eyes. Her steed was a third grade golden fire pupil beast. Extremely intimidating and dominant. In her eyes, a grey beaked goose was for country bumpkins only.</p><br/><p>The group of four sat down. Zuo Mo made a pot of tea. The three touched it with their lips before setting it down. Zuo Mo didn\u2019t care. What he had was just normal tea. It was a bit cheap. Normally, even he didn\u2019t drink it.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt really shocked me that Shidi comprehended sword essence in three months. Shidi is really too mean to not have slipped any hint and make me worry.\u201d Xu Yi said with a smile.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo quickly answered, \u201cIt isn\u2019t that this little brother deliberately concealed it. Even this little brother hadn\u2019t thought it would be possible.Afraid of saying it and being embarrassed, this little brother had been practising in the river and had been swept a few hundred miles away by the water. Even the sect leader had to send someone to search.\u201d</p><br/><p>The other three people\u2019s expressions instantly became slightly strange. They had already used the incident of Zuo Mo being swept away by the river as a joke. The three had mocked or disdained it. Now that Zuo Mo mentioned it in self-mockery, the three instantly didn\u2019t feel good inside.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo had comprehended sword essence and was walking far in front of them. Previously mocking Zuo Mo, it clearly showed their ignorance and stupidity.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat sword scripture is Shidi practicing?\u201d Xu Yi Xia asked with a face of innocence.</p><br/><p>\u201cLi Water Sword Scripture.\u201d Zuo Mo didn\u2019t deny it. If they wanted to know, they naturally could find out, \u201cIt is a third grade five elements sword scripture. Pity that Shibo said that it would be difficult for it to progress more.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing this Xu Yi Xia\u2019s cunning eyes couldn\u2019t help but reveal delight.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo coincidentally caught it. He couldn\u2019t resist sneering inside. This brat definitely didn\u2019t have a good heart!</p><br/><p>\u201cShidi, don\u2019t be discouraged.\u201d Gong Sun Qing comforted, \u201cYour talents are so outstanding, Shibo and Sect Leader wouldn\u2019t waste your talents.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShijie is right.\u201d Feeling the concern of the other, Zuo Mo felt goodwill for her and bowed towards Gong Sun Qing. It might have been that she would be marrying soon but she didn\u2019t walk closely with Qin Cheng\u2019s group. It seemed like that she didn\u2019t want to involve herself in the battle between the two sides.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis time, it is me that is searching for Shidi.\u201d The Eldest Shijie smiled, her tone gentle, \u201cThese two have been taken along to keep me company. I heard that Shidi can make a kind of lingdan called Golden Crow Pill which has a probability of making Golden Crow Fire. Is that true?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe appraisal says so. In reality, this little brother has not tried.\u201d Zuo Mo said cautiously.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d Gong Sun Qing smiled and took out a jade box, \u201cI want to use this time to exchange with Shidi for one hundred Golden Crow Pills. Shidi, take a look.\u201d</p><br/><p>Finishing, her slender fingers pushed the jade box in front of Zuo Mo.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo was slightly puzzled as he opened the jade box. The moment he opened the jade box, his pupils suddenly expanded, glee was unable to be disguised in his eyes!</p><br/><p>Translator ramblings: Zuo Mo is on vacation but that\u2019s not going to be for long.He\u2019s made a decision about his \u201ccareer\u201d and really, it was unrealistic for Xin Yan to expect the money-grubbing zombie to abandon his pursuit of wealth in exchange for a promise that he might succeed.</p><br/><p>Due to the fact that people have been confused by the previous/next links I had up in the first few chapters, I have decided to remove all of them.

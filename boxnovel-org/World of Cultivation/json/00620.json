They came so suddenly we did not have the time to flee. Bright Wave Jie started to gather all the major sects. The ones in charge were some people from Kun Lun and they were very strong. The sect leader and the shishu were all called over and put on the front line!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo punched the floor and shattered stone flew. His fist became deeply embedded in the flooring. His features were twisted and vicious. Even though everyone had separated, but the shishu had all been good to him and, in their own way, taken care of him. Zuo Mo had command battalions and he knew that the front line was the most dangerous place. It was also where the fighting was most intense. Not many could survive.</p><br/><p>There were only two types of people that would be sent to the front lines, one was elite troops, the other was cannon fodder.</p><br/><p>\u201cEver since Eldest Shixiong disappeared from the sword cave, many groups of people from Kun Lun came to ask the sect leader about the sword cave. One time, the argument became intense and Xin Shishu almost drew his sword. After that, our sect\u2019s position started to decline in Bright Wave Jie. Other sects started to antagonize us. The disciples started to leave.\u201d</p><br/><p>Luo Li\u2019s gaze was empty and unfocused.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe sect leader felt very depressed but the other shishu were alright. The disciples from before the expansion did not leave since days would be the same no matter where they spent it. Later on when the nearby sects came to antagonize us, Xin Shishu beat them away. No one cared too much. Was there a place that did not have conflict? It was at this time when the chaos rifts opened and the mo battalion came.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKun Lun came and wanted the shishu to go to the front lines. The sect leader did not agree and said that Fourth Shigu was not strong offensively and wanted her to remain behind. Kun Lun did not agree. They surrounded the sect. Fourth Shigu eventually agreed but requested for the disciples to be kept in the rear. Kun Lun agreed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Luo Li\u2019s expression suddenly became twisted.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut who knew when the sect leader and others left, Kun Lun\u2019s people put jinzhi on us. They said it was to prevent us from betraying them. On the road, we were attacked by a troop of mo. The people from Kun Lun forced us to go to delay the mo, otherwise, they would activate the jinzhi killing us. We could only listen and go, and then the Kun Lun people turned and ran abandoning us. Some of us died and some were wounded, the rest were captured. As a slave, I passed through the hands of several people before this mo.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKun Lun!\u201d Zuo Mo squeezed out the two words from his teeth, his eyes bloodshot. He had never thought that Kun Lun would do something this low.</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter Eldest Shixiong disappeared, Sect Leader was very distraught impacted and his hair turned white overnight. From then on, the sect leader started to talk about many things with me. Second Shixiong, Lin Qian always suspected that you were yaomo and mentioned something about Stars in Daytime. The sect leader had heard some rumors and deliberately did not search and have you come back. Sect Leader said, he had picked you up and brought you back, if you really are \u2026 \u2026 then it is this was better than handing you over to Kun Lun \u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing this, Zuo Mo\u2019s tears could not be suppressed anymore and flowed down his check. The thread of resentment that had been inside disappeared. Indescribable sorrow and regret welled up.</p><br/><p>Luo Li was sobbing.</p><br/><p>A moment later, Zuo Mo stopped his sorrow. He raised his head and asked, \u201cWhat about the other shidi and shimei?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI only know that Xiao Guo and Li Shimei are still alive. They were also captured. Shidi, you have to rescue them!\u201d Luo Li grabbed onto Zuo Mo, his grey eyes filled with begging.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo\u2019s heart hurt and he unhesitatingly nodded. He said resolutely, \u201cI will definitely rescue them!\u201d</p><br/><p>He then asked, \u201cSecond Shixiong, do you know who bought them?\u201d</p><br/><p>Luo Li lowered his head and thought for a moment before saying, \u201cIt is a female mo, she seems to be called Princess Xia.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPrincess Xia \u2026 \u2026\u201d Zuo Mo repeated a few times fearing he would forget.</p><br/><p>It seemed he had to go investigate who this Princess Xia was.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo secretly cased a resting spell on Luo Li, causing Luo Li to felt his eyelids become heavy and quickly slipped into sleep. Zuo Mo inspected the wounds inside Luo Li\u2019s body and his expression became terrible.</p><br/><p>The channels inside Luo Li\u2019s body were shattered. It would be extremely difficult to heal such severe wounds.</p><br/><p>\u201cKun Lun!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo had never hated a sect so much before, never!</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>Ximen Ning drank his wine and listened to the report from his subordinate.</p><br/><p>\u201cBoss, you have great foresight, Guard Camp really entered the Great Peace City!\u201d The subordinate was admiring in his tone.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaa haa, there aren\u2019t enough people in Guard Camp. If they had some more people, they might fight Bu Heng. This group is not friendly, and their origins definitely are not simple,\u201d Ximen Ning said with a slight smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cA strong dragon cannot suppress the local snake. Even if they are strong, they can only eat dust,\u201d A Qing\u2019s voice came.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, A Qing is right. Their origins will quickly be found. So many mo embryos, we probably are not the only ones interested. That will be fun to see when the time comes,\u201d Ximen Ning said with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cOnly when the water is cloudy can we take advantage to steal fish,\u201d A Qing inserted at the perfect time.</p><br/><p>Ximen Ning laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen Guard Camp entered the city, they had a standoff with Lan Tian Long.\u201d The subordinate hurriedly narrated the information he had obtained.</p><br/><p>\u201cLan Tian Long!\u201d Ximen Ning\u2019s brow creased.</p><br/><p>Ximen Ning was very familiar with Lan Tian Long and naturally knew of the other\u2019s fiery temper. Lan Tian Long had not fought? This didn\u2019t seem like Lan Tian Long\u2019s usual style.</p><br/><p>The leader of Guard Camp definitely had some special trait. Otherwise, it was not possible to explain Lan Tian Long\u2019s course of action.</p><br/><p>Was it strength? Or background?</p><br/><p>Ximen Ning pondered. It would be exaggerated to say that there was individual\u2019s strength that Lan Tian Long would be wary of. He had researched. The leader of Guard Camp was a youth not yet twenty. Could such a young youth be more powerful than Lan Tian Long?</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t believe it!</p><br/><p>So the only way would be background! Lan Tian Long recognized the background of this person so he purposefully retreated. Ximen Ning felt this was the most plausible. He had fought against Lan Tian Long before and knew while this person had a fiery temper, he wasn\u2019t simple-minded as people assumed.</p><br/><p>This speculation was supported by many details. For example, the strong Guard Camp was likely be the personal guard the young man\u2019s family had sent to protect him.</p><br/><p>Background \u2026 \u2026 what was his background?</p><br/><p>At this time, another subordinate came in to report.</p><br/><p>\u201cBoss, Bu Heng has entered the city!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ximen Ning came out of his thoughts and laughed. \u201cIt has been very long since Great Peace City been so busy!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>\u201cIs there some way to heal him?\u201d Zuo Mo looked at Pu Yao and Wei.</p><br/><p>Pu Yao was silent, Wei did not make a sound.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo instantly felt disappointed. When he agreed to rescue Xiao Guo and Li Ying Feng Shijie, he had seen the desire to die in Luo Li Shixiong\u2019s eyes. Zuo Mo was clear. Under these circumstances, many people would lose the will to life. Their hearts were dead.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo didn\u2019t know how to persuade Luo Li. He could only use the resting spell to temporarily force the other to rest.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Pu Yao spoke. \u201cMaybe there is a solution. However, it is almost the same as death.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat solution?\u201d Zuo Mo was like a person drowning that grabbed the life-saving reed and hurriedly asked.</p><br/><p>Pu Yao slowly spoke, \u201cOn the battlefield in the past, I had found an incomplete spell from a xiuzhe. Read it and you will know.\u201d</p><br/><p>Finished speaking, he threw a ball of light at Zuo Mo.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo took the ball. After he read it, he finally understood what Pu Yao meant that it was not much different than death.</p><br/><p>This was a spell called [Life-Death Lock] that was incomplete. It was very extreme. Saying it was a spell was not accurate. In Zuo Mo\u2019s view, this was just a daring theory. The spell was not complex, and was actually very simple.</p><br/><p>Enter the path through death!</p><br/><p>In this speculative chapter, it assumed that a person\u2019s death was a process, like passing through layers of biscuits, one layer after the next. Only when one broke through the last layer was one truly dead.</p><br/><p>The person who wrote this assumed that while the upper layers were also death, it was only a fake death. A state of fake death could easily stimulate the instincts of a person. If one was able to slow down the speed at which they passed through these upper layers of death, and stimulate their potential so that their potential counterbalanced death. This required that the rate their potential increased surpassed the speed they passed through the layers of death, doing so they could totter on the edge of life and death, and completely express a person\u2019s complete potential.</p><br/><p>After reading this, Zuo Mo had to admire the person who wrote this.</p><br/><p>Such a strange idea. It looked so absurd, but the author was able to explain what it meant. This person had also spent great effort to ponder how to stimulate one\u2019s potential in the state of death to twist life and death.</p><br/><p>It was just as Pu Yao had said. This was not any different than death. The entire chapter was speculative. In the end, even the author did not believe this spell would work and stopped writing.</p><br/><p>Consequently, this spell was incomplete.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo also hesitated. From every angle, [Life-Death Lock] was so absurd, but the phrases in the chapter swirled in his mind. They seemed to hold a strange power. Many of the ideas gave him great inspiration.</p><br/><p>He had a faint feeling that this [Life-Death Lock] was a wondrous spell.</p><br/><p>At this time, Luo Li slowly woke up.</p><br/><p>He opened his eyes. When he saw Zuo Mo, he forced a smile. His eyes were grey and empty, lifeless.</p><br/><p>Xiuzhe were powerful, but if their heart was dead, their vitality would flow away faster than normal people. Because their heart was the base of all their power.</p><br/><p>When Zuo Mo saw Luo Li\u2019s eyes, he knew it was not good.</p><br/><p>\u201cShixiong wants to die?\u201d Zuo Mo suddenly said.</p><br/><p>Luo Li was surprised but he nodded and said honestly, \u201cI am nothing now, my channels are all broken, my dantian destroyed. Even the best ling medicine cannot heal me. I\u2019m satisfied now that I am able to see Shidi. I do not have any left to connect me to this world. With this broken body, I will drag down Shidi. I will also feel life is boring and painful. Rather than suffering through that, death is an easy matter.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo stared hard at Luo Li\u2019s eyes. He saw Luo Li\u2019s expression was the same from beginning to end and knew the other was resolved.</p><br/><p>\u201cShixiong, do you not want revenge against Kun Lun? Do you not want to rescue Xiao Guo and Li Ying Feng Shijie?\u201d Zuo Mo asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cShidi, do not \u2026 \u2026\u201d Luo Li grimaced.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have a spell here. It is dangerous, but it may be your only hope.\u201d At this time, Zuo Mo could only hope for the best and took out a jade scroll, [Life-Death Lock].</p><br/><p>Luo Li assumed that Zuo Mo was trying to persuade him but did not bear to reject his goodwill so he took it.</p><br/><p>After sweeping a glance, he froze!</p><br/><p>Translator Ramblings: About 300 chapters and it finally gets resolved! Foreshadowing for this was there but extremely hard to detect in the chapters.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

His expression was excited and filled with hope. It said that Ming Jue Zi had found some important clues.</p><br/><p>There was nothing that could make Zuo Mo happier than this, nothing was more urgent. He didn\u2019t even stop to go look for Nan Yue and Cang Ze.</p><br/><p>Ming Jue Zi quickly appeared. He recognized Zuo Mo at a glance. \u201cSir Xiao Mo Ge, I am Ming Jue Zi.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo felt this person was familiar but he could not remember where he had seen Ming Jue Zi before. He politely responded, \u201cSir Ming Jue Zi, good day.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Jue Zi did not waste words and casted a recording yao art.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn here is everything about the Battle of Sealed Extinction,\u201d Ming Jue Zi said. This battle is truly too ancient. There are very few records about it. I\u2019m very sorry, this is all the information that I was able to find.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo quickly scanned the contents inside the recording yao art.</p><br/><p>The general era in which the battle of Sealed Extinction occurred was not known, but it was approximately twenty five thousand years ago. It happened at that place that was called Constant Scarlet Jie. Supposedly, because the fiercest fighting had occurred near the jie river, the jie river entrance was destroyed in the fighting, and Constant Scarlet Jie became inaccessible, and disappeared from the jie maps from then on.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo look hard at the ancient jie map.</p><br/><p>This jie map was extremely primitive. Zuo Mo\u2019s gaze landed on the several jie surrounding Constant Scarlet Jie. From these, he could generally judge the position of Constant Scarlet Jie.</p><br/><p>Sky Fold Jie, Gentle Mountain Jie, and Dazzling Splendor Jie. These three bordered Constant Scarlet Jie.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you know the general position of Constant Scarlet Jie based on the present jie maps?\u201d Zuo Mo asked Ming Jue Zi.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is probably in the area of Bloody Sky Metropolis Jie.\u201d Ming Jue Zi had prepared well. \u201cConstant Scarlet Jie disappeared a long time ago so it is hard to judge its position. But Sky Fold Jie and Dazzling Splendor Jie are presently part of Bloody Sky Metropolis Jie. Gentle Mountain Jie is the territory of xiuzhe and is a dangerous area. If we use these jie as references, Constant Scarlet Jie should be near the border of Bloody Sky Metropolis Jie. People have gone to explore this area before, but no one has found the existence of Constant Scarlet Jie.\u201d</p><br/><p>These questions strengthened Ming Jue Zi\u2019s belief that Xiao Mo Ge was searching for treasure. Otherwise, why would he research the position of Constant Scarlet Jie?</p><br/><p>Bloody Sky Metropolis Jie</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo was stunned. Anyone with some common knowledge would know this place. Wasn\u2019t that the place for the Yao Hunt? From all the news reports, he knew Bloody Sky Metropolis Jie was where the heaviest fighting between xiuzhe and yaomo took place.</p><br/><p>For Zuo Mo, this was not good news. Previously, he had decided to determine his present location, and then use transportation formations to leave the ghastly place.</p><br/><p>But hearing that Constant Scarlet Jie was in Bloody Sky Metropolis Jie, his heart instantly cooled halfway. He had heard the general story of how Bloody Sky Metropolis Jie had formed. Places like these were unsuitable for using transportation formations because the interference caused by the formation was great. When the Yao Hunt had been most fashionable in the past, the xiuzhe attempts in putting down transportation formations inside Bloody Sky Metropolis Jie had never succeeded. All of the supplies had been transported in on treasure ships.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo had only a basic understanding of transportation formations. Because he couldn\u2019t predict the interference, he didn\u2019t dare to move rashly. Any small mistake in the transportation formation was terrifying. The reason that they had been transported to that ghastly place was that someone had changed the transportation formation in Sky Water Jie.</p><br/><p>This plan seemed to have failed. Zuo Mo quickly discarded this idea.</p><br/><p>His attention was placed on another sentence \u201cthe bulk of the fighting was near the jie river.\u201d This sentence caused Zuo Mo\u2019s eyes to light up. After searching through the fiendish mist all this time, they had discovered some trends. The closer to the center of the battlefield they went, the heavier the black fiendish energy was, and the stronger the fiend soul beasts.</p><br/><p>If it was like that \u2026 \u2026</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo quickly organized his thoughts and became more excited as he thought. This way, they could quickly find the past jie river of Constant Scarlet Jie. The report speculated the reason that Constant Scarlet Jie had disappeared was that the jie river from it towards other jie had broke. This had caused the appearance that Constant Scarlet Jie had disappeared.</p><br/><p>If they could find the location of the previous jie river, and then open the jie river \u2026 \u2026</p><br/><p>This way, the chances they could leave would increase greatly!</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo repeatedly looked over the information to imprint it deep into his mind. Ming Jue Zi did not hurry him and patiently waited for Zuo Mo to finish reading.</p><br/><p>A while later, Zuo Mo raised his head in satisfaction. \u201cThis is your payment.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ming Jue Zi gathered his courage and said, \u201cSir Xiao Mo Ge, I hope to use the reward to exchange for a yao art.\u201d He then added, \u201cIf you have it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo paused. Ming Jue Zi\u2019s request was unexpected but he still asked, \u201cWhat yao art?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c[Water Wood Light Art]!\u201d When Ming Jue Zi finished speaking, he looked closely at Zuo Mo. He was extremely nervous.</p><br/><p>\u201c[Water Wood Light Art]?\u201d In the sea of consciousness, Pu Yao paused upon hearing the name of the yao art. He abruptly said to Zuo Mo, \u201cAsk him if he knows Ming Duan.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you know Ming Duan?\u201d Zuo Mo asked.</p><br/><p>Ming Jue Zi suddenly became excited. \u201cThat is my ancestor! Does Daren know Ancestor?\u201d</p><br/><p>In the sea of consciousness, Pu Yao was silent, and Wei sighed.</p><br/><p>\u201cPu, you know?\u201d Actually, with Pu Yao\u2019s reactions, Zuo Mo knew that Pu Yao definitely knew Ming Duan and their relationship wasn\u2019t just a casual one. However, he was slightly puzzled. He thought of Nan Yue, Pu Yao\u2019s attitude back then had also been like this.</p><br/><p>\u201cTell him,\u201d Pu Yao did not reply and said, \u201cthe yao art will be given, but he must follow you.\u201d</p><br/><p>As expected, the conditions were just the same as Nan Yue. Zuo Mo muttered inside, but he still repeated this to Ming Jue Zi.</p><br/><p>Ming Jue Zi unhesitatingly bowed, \u201cThis subordinate is willing to follow Daren!\u201d</p><br/><p>Giving the [Water Wood Light Art] to Ming Jue Zi, he hurriedly got him to leave. He was filled with curiosity, and decided to get to the bottom of the situation. He straightforwardly asked Pu Yao, \u201cPu, did you know their ancestors? Why do you have their yao arts?\u201d</p><br/><p>After remaining silent for a while, Pu Yao finally spoke, \u201cTheir ancestors were once my subordinates.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo stilled. He had thought that Pu Yao had a close connection to these clans but definitely had not thought it would be this kind of relationship.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat year, in our final battle, we were trapped.\u201d Pu Yao looked into the distance, his voice reminiscent. \u201cEveryone knew we could not escape. In order to make sure our lines of succession were not broken, we exchanged our yao arts amongst ourselves, said swore that whoever managed to survive was to pass on these yao arts to their descendants.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo was silent. A moment later, he asked, \u201cThen why do you require them to follow me? Just give it to them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI had not thought that their clans would have declined so far.\u201d Pu Yao twisted his mouth. \u201cEven if I give the yao arts to them, their clans might not be able to survive on their own. Getting them to follow you is for their benefit. Your other skills might be average, but your ability to survive is top notch. If they follow you, they can at least survive.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo\u2019s face instantly collapsed. \u201cWhy push your past debts onto me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are my student, who do I push them on to if not you?\u201d Pu Yao\u2019s tone was righteous. He then smiled smugly, \u201cIt is fortunate that you are not inheriting from Wei. Tsk tsk, otherwise, you would really know what trouble is!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei said with slight helplessness, \u201cDon\u2019t draw me into your matters.\u201d Finishing, he couldn\u2019t help but argue, \u201cAll of the gravestone armors stand by their belief and oath, this is glory and strength.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo and Pu Yao rolled their eyes at the same time. They didn\u2019t like Wei\u2019s conduct at all.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo thought of another matter. He asked Pu Yao, \u201cThen where did you get those xiuzhe spells?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSpoils of victory!\u201d Pu Yao had a proud expression. \u201cThe xiuzhe that died on my hands aren\u2019t normal ones. These spells are my collection. Aren\u2019t they good?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo\u2019s eyes lit up. \u201cHow many? Give them all to me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy give them to you?\u201d Pu Yao rolled his eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m your student!\u201d Zuo Mo\u2019s tone was righteous. Even his expression was the same as Pu Yao.</p><br/><p>Pu Yao instantly choked. However, he reacted very quickly. \u201cIt\u2019s not that I can\u2019t give them to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat conditions?\u201d Zuo Mo was very bald.</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst, you are my student, but look at yourself. What you\u2019re best at is cultivating the mo physique. That is unacceptable!\u201d Pu Yao had been discontent about this for a long time. On the side, Wei\u2019s eyes flashed. He knew that Pu Yao had started his attack.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo way about it. Who made it that the Great Day mo physique is powerful. We need to first preserve our lives first and then we can speak of other matters,\u201d Zuo Mo threw up his hands and said with helplessness on his face.</p><br/><p>Pu Yao was not defeated by Zuo Mo\u2019s words. \u201cHa, when your yao arts advance to a level, I will give you that level\u2019s spells.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo wasn\u2019t a softy. Want to tempt ge? Not that easy! He turned his face and said to Wei, \u201cWei, teach me mo skills!\u201d</p><br/><p>Pu Yao\u2019s expression instantly became dark.</p><br/><p>Wei did not want to provoke Pu Yao, but he didn\u2019t want to only watch as Zuo Mo truly gave up on his mo physique. He had inspected everyone in Guard Camp. No person\u2019s talent could compare to Zuo Mo. To be able to cultivate Great Day mo physique to this level, this was talent!</p><br/><p>The inheritance of the gravestone armor was a matter of chance. If he gave up on this opportunity, he didn\u2019t know when he would encounter another one.</p><br/><p>Also, Zuo Mo seemed casual and offhand usually, and was never on the right path, but in reality, he had his own set of rules. He was not someone that would waver.</p><br/><p>He said with finesse, \u201cI gave an oath to not actively pass mo skills on to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Pu Yao instantly thought that it was not good. He knew just how clever his student was.</p><br/><p>As expected, Zuo Mo snickered after hearing that and said, \u201cThis is easy! I know, you are not able to break your oath. Oh, definitely won\u2019t go against your oath, there are many ways. Look, I stole and learned on my own, you didn\u2019t teach me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei was moved. He might hold by his oath, but he was not a pedantic person. Otherwise, he would not have disguised himself as the female to fool Pu Yao.</p><br/><p>Pu Yao\u2019s gaze instantly became extremely unfriendly, but he also had a great headache.</p><br/><p>This boy was more and more bandit-like and was becoming harder to deal with!</p><br/><p>Adding on that Wei was drooling after this boy, Pu Yao felt his mind was a mess.</p><br/><p>Just as Pu Yao was feeling a headache, an icy voice interrupted the three people that were arguing.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Mo Ge! You have been drafted! In ten days, report to the main base of the Heavy Earth Corps. If you do not arrive by the deadline, you will be punished by military law!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo raised his head in shock. He found that at some time unknown to him, he was surrounded by four people with icy presences. The four people had faintly unfriendly expressions and tightly surrounded him.</p><br/><p>Drafted?</p><br/><p>Heavy Earth Corps?</p><br/><p>Report in ten days?</p><br/><p>Punishment by military law?</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo\u2019s mind blanked. What was this?</p><br/><p>Translator Ramblings: Abrupt scene switch again.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

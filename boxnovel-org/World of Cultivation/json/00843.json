The endless mist sea would heal his injuries. Compared to him, the mist monsters that Zuo Mo and the others encountered in the Mist Hall weren\u2019t worth a mention. Every Ghost Mist Head was like a heavy little mountain. Their shifting faces were filled with an eerie power.</p><br/><p>It the sun shen power wasn\u2019t their bane, Zuo Mo doubted that he could have managed to survive until now.</p><br/><p>However, at this time, Zuo Mo didn\u2019t have any stray thoughts in his head.</p><br/><p>The green strand in his hand floated uncontrollably. The light at the tip of Zuo Mo\u2019s finger suddenly gave off an ancient and desolate power. It was like the vast primal plain where everything grew naturally. There were no signs of civilization, only the vitality of nature.</p><br/><p>This shen glyph he did not know the name of, this shen glyph that he had not yet completely comprehended flooded into his mind as Zuo Mo was forced to a precipice.</p><br/><p>The green strand suddenly rolled back as though it was summoned.</p><br/><p>The hair-thin strand tore through the air with a piercing shriek.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo\u2019s attention was completely focused as he searched for the feeling from that day. The light at his fingertip gradually grew brighter.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, his fingertip felt heavy. Joy flashed through Zuo Mo\u2019s eyes. This was the feeling!</p><br/><p>Vroom!</p><br/><p>A heart-shaking low roar came as though it was like a tide coming closer.</p><br/><p>The dancing green strand started to give off eerie light. It was like a luminescent seagrass dancing in the air.</p><br/><p>Any ghost mist head that was touched by the green strand would pop. The hair-thin green strand seemed to contain astounding power. With just light blows, even the largest ghost mist heads would turn to dust!</p><br/><p>This scene was amazing to see.</p><br/><p>Pop pop pop!</p><br/><p>The ghost mist heads rushing towards Zuo Mo were destroyed. Before their destruction, the sorrowful wails of the ghost mist heads would send chills to anyone listening.</p><br/><p>Yet Zuo Mo who was immersed in the shen glyph did not seem to feel it. In a blink, the space in front of Zuo Mo was clear.</p><br/><p>The mist giant saw the glowing green strand and exclaimed after a moment of stillness, \u201cGreen Pulse String!\u201d</p><br/><p>Green Pulse String?</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo did not have time to think. The feeling coming from his fingertips was not one of heaviness but a dull burning pain as though he had rubbed the skin on his finger raw.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo gave a muffled grunt but ignored the pain. He continued to draw the shen glyph that appeared in his mind.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>The green strand suddenly untied itself from Zuo Mo\u2019s wrist.</p><br/><p>The green stand danced in front of Zuo Mo, one end flying into the sky, and the other end under Zuo Mo.</p><br/><p>In a flash, the green strand was pulled tight like a piano wire made from light connecting the sky and earth!</p><br/><p>The mist giant was clearly panicked. His body sank and he was about to flee into the mist sea. As long as he fled into the mist sea, he would be safe.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, his figure froze. The lower half of his body did not listen to him.</p><br/><p>Watching as the light of the green strand grew, he panicked even more.</p><br/><p>What was going on?</p><br/><p>He bent his neck and found to his shock that the lower half of his body had, at some time, become a dull grey.</p><br/><p>Only now he did suddenly recall the woman who had dodged before had channeled something into his body. His body could change at will, was immune to all toxins. As long as he was in the mist sea, he was immortal!</p><br/><p>Ever since he began guarding the Mist Eye Tablet, after fighting so many totem warriors, there was only a handful of warriors that he felt threatened by.</p><br/><p>How could these two worms threaten him, an entity who had lived for tens of thousands of years and was peerlessly powerful?</p><br/><p>But \u2026 ..</p><br/><p>The initial spread of the grey color hadn\u2019t attracted his attention. In the moments before this, he had dismissed it.</p><br/><p>What was this?</p><br/><p>The mist giant was slightly shocked but he did not lose his composure. This was probably a great poison! He pondered. This was not a challenge to him. He was experienced.</p><br/><p>Poison was useless against him!</p><br/><p>The mist giant recovered his calm and smirked inside. This endless mist sea was his greatest support. He had experience in dealing with poisons. If he collapsed his body and then reconstructed it again, even the greatest poison was useless.</p><br/><p>Just like usual, he prepared to destroy his body.</p><br/><p>Yet, in the next moment, his expression changed. He was unable to break down his body!</p><br/><p>How was this possible!</p><br/><p>How was this possible!</p><br/><p>The mist giant was both shocked and angry. Suddenly, an eerie green light entered his vision.</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t help but turn his head. His soul was scared out of him.</p><br/><p>The ruler-straight green thread energy was so thick it was almost tangible from afar. This piano string that connected the earth to the sky was giving off a blinding and intense light.</p><br/><p>When the mist giant\u2019s eyes landed on Zuo Mo\u2019s finger that was drawing in the air, he was motionless as though he had been struck by lightning!</p><br/><p>Impossible!</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>The burning sensation from his fingertip grew stronger. Zuo Mo had reached the end of what he could draw. His attention was focused and tense, so focused he had no other thoughts. He feared that if he slacked off slightly, all of this work would go to waste.</p><br/><p>As Zuo Mo drew the shen glyph, the green strand that was like a chord of light in front of him seemed to be drawn back by invisible hands.</p><br/><p>As the green thread was drawn out, the green lights quickly gathered at the point where the green strand was being pulled.</p><br/><p>The light marks increased. In a flash, a small green twister of light formed on the green strand.</p><br/><p>The enormous body of the mist giant was the best target at this time.</p><br/><p>Brrng!</p><br/><p>The string twanged!</p><br/><p>The twisting green light drew out a blinding green streak in the air before striking the mist giant.</p><br/><p>The green light easily entered the body of the mist giant.</p><br/><p>The mist giant\u2019s body was frozen as though it was a statue. Suddenly, blinding green light came from inside the mist giant. Immediately after, rays of light broke through the mist giant like swords. The mist giant seemed like a hedgehog.</p><br/><p>Woosh!</p><br/><p>Green tongues of flame suddenly shot out of the mist giant. Moments later, the mist giant was completely enveloped in flames and burned.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo finally came out of his strange state. There was nothing under his feet, and his body twisted as it instinctively maintained his position in the air. He finally found to his shock that all of his shen power had been used up.</p><br/><p>Looking at the enormous ball of fire in the distance, Zuo Mo finally sighed in relief. His gaze landed on the green strand that had lost all of its light.</p><br/><p>With a wave of his hand, the green strand flew back into his hands.</p><br/><p>Green Pulse String. That seemed to be the three words that the mist giant had just said.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, a tiny white shadow flew out of the flames and was attempting to break into the air. Zuo Mo could clearly see that the white shadow was a snowy white child.</p><br/><p>What was that?</p><br/><p>Seeing him about to flee, a hand appeared out of nowhere and grabbed his neck.</p><br/><p>The child\u2019s body froze. He didn\u2019t dare to move, but he grimaced inside.</p><br/><p>Holding the naked child, A Gui flew next to Zuo Mo.</p><br/><p>\u201cGhost Mist Child! He\u2019s the Ghost Mist Child of the Ghost Mist Tribe!\u201d Wei said with wonder.</p><br/><p>\u201cGhost Mist Child?\u201d Zuo Mo was clueless.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey say that when the totem warriors of the Ghost Mist Tribe reach the end of their cultivation, they would rejuvenate back to a child, with their bodies becoming completely white. That is a ghost mist child,\u201d Wei explained.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems very powerful.\u201d Zuo Mo muttered.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am very powerful!\u201d The child on A Gui\u2019s hand couldn\u2019t resist speaking.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo, Wei and Pu Yao were completely stunned. The Ghost Mist Child could hear them talking?</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m telling you, this old man was the strongest in the tribe in the past!\u201d The Ghost Mist Child said in a wizened tone. However, when paired with his young voice, it was strange to hear.</p><br/><p>Pu Yao\u2019s bloody pupil suddenly flashed. \u201cYou can hear us talk?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course!\u201d The Ghost Mist Child said impatiently. \u201cYou two are souls, here in my territory, how can I not hear you? You are very weak to not know such a minor skill. You definitely cannot even leave the body of this boy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou know how to make your soul manifest outside your body?\u201d Pu Yao\u2019s bloody pupil flashed again.</p><br/><p>\u201cSoul manifest outside the body? I haven\u2019t heard of that. However, it is very simple to walk out of this boy\u2019s body,\u201d the ghost mist child said offhandedly.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow?\u201d Pu Yao asked shamelessly.</p><br/><p>The ghost mist child suddenly stopped talking, knowing he had something of value now. He wasn\u2019t dumb. He had talked so much because he wanted to bargain with Zuo Mo.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo was experienced. Seeing the other like this, he knew what the other\u2019s plan was. He smirked and said, \u201cCooperate, and save yourself some physical pain.\u201d</p><br/><p>The ghost mist child said dismissively, \u201cWhat can you do to this old man? If you kill this old man, you will never be able to leave the mist eye tablet.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo I need to kill you?\u201d Zuo Mo was a vicious person and the ghost mist child couldn\u2019t compare to him. He said coolly, \u201cI only need to put a wisp of sun shen fire into your body, hmph hmph!\u201d</p><br/><p>He remembered what Wei said. The sun shen power he cultivated was the bane of the Ghost Mist Tribe. The sun shen fire should also be effective against the ghost mist child.</p><br/><p>The ghost mist child\u2019s expression immediately turned ill as he shrieked, \u201cYou are so evil!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cScared by just this?\u201d Zuo Mo continued to smile coldly. \u201cGe has all kinds of ways, this is nothing. Resist, keep resisting, ge is waiting. You brought ge in here, we need to settle this debt. Otherwise, heh, this is only the start?\u201d</p><br/><p>The ghost mist child was about to cry. He had slept for tens of thousands of years and encountered such a freakish guy after waking up.</p><br/><p>Pu Yao said coldly, \u201cCareful, do not let him near the mist sea below.\u201d</p><br/><p>The ghost mist child wanted to kill himself by hitting his head on the wall. How come every one of the enemy was so cunning? The mist hall that he had guarded for so many years. He really missed it. The people of the ancient era were so honest \u2026 \u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll talk, I\u2019ll talk!\u201d The ghost mist child could not care for anything else now that the situation was like this. These people were clearly not friendly, and he could only be unfortunate to have landed in the hands of these people.</p><br/><p>The ghost mist child presented a chant.</p><br/><p>A black and white figure quickly broke free of Zuo Mo\u2019s sea of consciousness.</p><br/><p>\u201cHahahaha!\u201d Pu Yao laughed into the sky with pleasure. He had been searching all this time for a way to leave Zuo Mo\u2019s sea of consciousness. Only today was his wish fulfilled.</p><br/><p>This feeling was too good!</p><br/><p>Wei also had an expression of joy and novelty. No one could imagine the desire a person who was trapped for so many years felt towards freedom.</p><br/><p>A Gui was unaffected by Pu Yao and Wei\u2019s suddenly appearances.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo looked at Pu Yao and Wei who were flying back and forth in the sky. He couldn\u2019t help but gave a sincere smile.</p><br/><p>These two antiques \u2026 \u2026</p><br/><p>The ghost mist child saw no one was paying attention to him and was about to attempt to break free. However, the girl who was grabbing his neck seemed to detect his intentions and her grip tightened.</p><br/><p>The ghost mist child\u2019s neck felt a burst of pain.</p><br/><p>He immediately became docile.</p><br/><p>Translator Ramblings: First person to learn directly about Pu and Wei! Another fogey, but in the guise of a toddler.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

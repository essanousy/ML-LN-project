It\u2019s very weird.</p><br/><p>Chapter Twenty Five Fourth Shigu</p><br/><p>The notice altar was in the southern part of Dong Fu, and it was also the most prosperous and busiest part of Dong Fu. Because he had already joined a sect, and taking care of the ling fields and cultivation had taken up almost all of his time, Zuo Mo had never been to the notice altar before. This was why he hadn\u2019t thought of this place at the beginning.</p><br/><p>Stopping at the notice altar, he couldn\u2019t help but inhale sharply!</p><br/><p>Looking out, countless posts made from cloth banners pointed at the sky like a forest, spreading out into the horizon. Under each banner, people\u2019s heads moved. The stream of people also moved slowly. Zuo Mo was in awe at the scene.</p><br/><p>Dazedly, he followed the stream and entered the notice altar.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis sect has a pair of Firey Gold Eyes Beast pups, requires one zookeeper. Requires cultivation above intermediate level of zhuji, five or more years of experience in animal care, salary generous.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis sect is clearing out ling fields, needs large number of body cultivators, above lianqi fifth level. Includes residence and food. Ten pieces of first-grade jingshi each day.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>In just a quick while, Zuo Mo\u2019s eyes started to blur.</p><br/><p>Just at this time, someone came up: \u2018Bro, what, it\u2019s hard to search. I have the complete table of content for the entire notice altar, detailed and accurate. It is updated at the first time. How about it, do you want a copy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow much?\u201d Zuo Mo asked cautiously.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot expensive, twenty pieces of first-grade jingshi.\u201d The person said: \u201cBro, at one look, I can see you are one for doing big things. Time is so precious, wasting it like this is not worthy. Just twenty pieces of first-grade jingshi, it\u2019s really worthwhile!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEight pieces!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBro, look at all these notices. Just me alone, how can I collect all of them? I have to support an entire bunch of people\u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAdding on two pieces, I\u2019m very sincere.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBro, we don\u2019t have it easy\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo turned to leave. The person hurriedly pulled Zuo Mo: \u201cOkay okay okay, I\u2019ll sell it to you at a loss!\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking at the directory that he spent ten pieces of first-grade jingshi to buy, Zuo Mo was a sorry figure as he escaped from the notice altar. He found a less busy place nearby and sat down.</p><br/><p>That was a really scary place! He looked with trepidation at the bustling notice altar.</p><br/><p>Adding ling energy to the jade stick, there were more than one thousand and five hundred posts in the directory, a huge variety, everything was there. After a long time, Zuo Mo finally found an order and started to look down.</p><br/><p>After a full two hours, he finally raised his head, his eyes full of disappointment. It wasn\u2019t that there weren\u2019t related posts that paid with spells, but not one of them were something that he could accomplish. Thinking about it now, Fu Jing was right. When any spell reached the third level, the price also changed drastically.</p><br/><p>Discontentedly returning on the flying paper crane, Zuo Mo\u2019s expression was blank.</p><br/><p>When he returned home and saw Wei Sheng Shixiong standing outside his door, he couldn\u2019t help but blank.</p><br/><p>Wei Sheng Shixiong didn\u2019t seem to have changed much from before. Still clad in rough cloth. Even though he still gave others the feeling of being as sharp as a sword, but it was much more restrained than before. It could be seen that Wei Sheng Shixiong\u2019s cultivation was much deeper than before. Even when Zuo Mo was still far away, he already detected it.</p><br/><p>\u201cShidi has really made me wait.\u201d He smiled as he greeted.</p><br/><p>Wei Sheng Shixiong\u2019s warmth that was just like before made Zuo Mo very surprised and slightly moved. The attitudes of inner sect disciples towards outer sect disciples were usually extremely bad, and those of low birth and had an accomplished cultivation, their arrogant manner was the normal state.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf Shixiong has something, just send a notice, why wait so long outside the door?\u201d Zuo Mo solemnly replied.</p><br/><p>Wei Sheng took out a small box from his bosom and handed it to Zuo Mo: \u201cThe fire dragon grass seed won\u2019t be of any use in my hands, but at least its third-grade so it would be a pity to throw it out. Shidi is skilled in planting, so this is given to Shidi.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo was greedy about wealth but facing the little box, he didn\u2019t hold out his hand. The seed of a third-grade fire dragon grass, it wasn\u2019t a question to sell it for a few tens of pieces of second-grade jingshi.</p><br/><p>\u201cShixiong has successfully zhuji, and there would be many places that would require jingshi in the future\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Sheng interrupted his words, shoving the wooden box into Zuo Mo\u2019s chest: \u201cDon\u2019t be chatty. I\u2019m telling you to take it. My heart is for the sword, and doesn\u2019t like other things.\u201d</p><br/><p>Holding the wooden box, Zuo Mo didn\u2019t know what to say.</p><br/><p>\u201cShidi has outstanding talent and should work hard to not fail to live up to this good vessel.\u201d He urged: \u201cVery soon I will enter the Sword Cave to study. When I come out, Shidi should have successfully zhuji.\u201d</p><br/><p>For some reason, Zuo Mo\u2019s heart warmed and burst out: \u201cI definitely will successfully zhuji!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I won\u2019t worry anymore. It\u2019s a pity that Shidi isn\u2019t interested in the sword.\u201d There was a hint of pity in Wei Sheng\u2019s expression.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo smiled: \u201cIt isn\u2019t bad being a ling plant farmer, jingshii is a very dependable thing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha!\u201d Wei Sheng roared with laughter: \u201cThat\u2019s so true. I won\u2019t bid farewell. When I come out, us brothers will drink!\u201d</p><br/><p>Finishing, he swept away.</p><br/><p>Even when Wei Sheng Shixiong had walked a long ways off, Zuo Mo\u2019s heart was still slightly excited.</p><br/><p>No matter if Wei Sheng Shixiong was deliberate or not but this bit of solicitude, he would firmly remember.</p><br/><p>From when he opened his eyes, what he faced was a completely unfamiliar world. The sect leader that picked him up had asked a few words before he was never seen again. He was like a newborn baby that started to dumbly learn bit by bit everything in the surroundings. His strange zombie face, and the ignorance about the affairs of the world caused him to receive endless mockery and ridicule.</p><br/><p>The only thing he was glad about was that the heavens had left behind some assets for him \u2013 a cultivation of lianqi fifth level. The setbacks he endured everywhere didn\u2019t make him sink but actually stirred up the stubbornness in his bones. He cultivated day and night, used the rain of [Little Art of Cloud and Rain] to fill the dry pond drop by drop. After that, the treatment he received gradually changed. Piling on the insincerity and worldliness, deliberately getting close to the other disciples in the sect, and earning a pretty good reputation.</p><br/><p>But that alienation inside, it gradually deepened with time.</p><br/><p>Wei Sheng Shixiong, who he only had met two times before, it was the first time he felt a sincere concern.</p><br/><p>Before this, he wasn\u2019t interested in zhuji. That astounding sword essence in his sea of consciousness, while it had stirred up some interest in power, but quickly, [Embryonic Breathing Spiritual Cultivation] had completely made him lose interest in power. For him, power was undoubtedly very far away.</p><br/><p>But Wei Sheng Shixiong\u2019s exhortions today made him suddenly feel that he needed to zhuji. This feeling was so fierce, from the moment it left his mouth, he felt that, no matter what, he had to complete zhuji!</p><br/><p>Zhuji!</p><br/><p>Zhuji, it was the first barrier in the long journey of cultivation. For those disciples in the large sects, zhuji was so easy that it was like stepping over a doorstep. But for normal xiuzhe, this would decide their status. Those that were in the stage of zhuji basically had left behind the lowest level of work, their income enough for those as greedy as Zuo Mo to have red eyes. But there was a high degree of difficulty in zhuji, especially to someone like Zuo Mo who only had the kind of mainstream street trash like [Ten Principles Scripture]. To finish zhuji, it needed luck and character. Other than that, the success of zhuji depended on whether the wallet was full or not.</p><br/><p>The lingdan and ling herbs that were required for zhuji, not one of them was cheap. And the effects varied greatly.</p><br/><p>Normal zhuji dan, it generally was one hundred pieces of second-grade jingshi. But this kind of zhuji dan could only be considered to barely useable. And if one was willing to spill some blood, two pieces of third-grade jingshi, they could buy the highest grade of zhuji dan, the success rate multiplying. This was also why the disciples of the large sects didn\u2019t care about zhuji. For them, two pieces of third-grade jingshi was really a small amount.</p><br/><p>But for Zuo Mo, one hundred pieces of second-grade jingshi was almost his entire wealth. And this was only because his income had been high lately. Before this, did he dare to even think?</p><br/><p>That was also why he would put his efforts on ling plant farmer. In reality, the difficulty of becoming a ling plant farmer was much higher than zhuji. This could be seen from how much the salary of a ling plant farmer surpassed a zhuji cultivator. But the difficulty was based on talent. There wasn\u2019t much of a jingshi investment. What other than this was more perfect for a money-grubbing Zuo Mo?</p><br/><p>But now he wanted to zhuji!</p><br/><p>His brain was occupied with this though as he dumbly walked to Cold Mist Valley.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho are you? How dare you enter this sect\u2019s important lands!\u201d Suddenly a cold shout broke through Zuo Mo\u2019s thoughts.</p><br/><p>A matron, appearing about forty something years old, was standing in the medicine fields, coldly looking at Zuo Mo. Zuo Mo unconsciously raised his head. When he met the other\u2019s eyes, he instantly dropped into ice! The other\u2019s gaze was as sharp as a sword, almost piercing him through.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo shook, as though waking from a dream, his mind whirling quickly, he hurriedly made the bow of a disciple: \u201cThis disciple is Zuo Mo. Received Hao Min shijie\u2019s orders to temporarily care for the medicine fields here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat girl dares! Dares to be lazy!\u201d The green-clad matron\u2019s face was cold, hinting at the anger.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo silently grimaced. Right now, he largely knew the identity of this elder in front of him. Wu Kong Sword Sect hadn\u2019t been big to begin with. The only one that fit the description was the fourth shigu, Shi Feng Rong. Shi Feng Rong spent long periods of time travelling abroad, occasionally returning. Zuo Mo had never had the chance to see her before. But supposedly this shigu didn\u2019t have a good temper, was hard to be close with. Looking at it now, it was true.</p><br/><p>His only hope now was that Fourth Shigu wouldn\u2019t blame him.</p><br/><p>Hao Ming Shijie was an inner sect disciple. Even if she was punished, it wouldn\u2019t be heavy. But his status was low. If he was blamed, he wouldn\u2019t have a good ending.</p><br/><p>Shi Feng Rong scanned the medicine fields in the surroundings. Seeing the ling herbs were fine, the coldness on her face retreated slightly. She relaxed her tone to ask: \u201cWhat are you called?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDisciple Zuo Mo greets Fourth Shigu.\u201d Zuo Mo answered respectfully.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour care isn\u2019t bad.\u201d Glancing at Zuo Mo, her eyes held praise: \u201cCultivation of lianqi eighth level. En, can be considered ambitious. From today onwards, Cold Mist Valley is under your care. Humph, when Hao Min returns, I will sort her out!\u201d</p><br/><p>Temporary worker turning to actual worker, Zuo Mo wasn\u2019t very a hundred times unwilling but facing Fourth Shigu\u2019s gaze that could cut him up, he perceptively swallowed the words back into his stomach. Inside, he muttered, Fourth Shigu was the same as Xin Yan Shishu, they looked at everyone like the others owed them money.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis zhuji dan, it is your reward.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo stared with bright eyes at the zhuji dan in his hands. The hundred times unwilling instantly became one hundred times willing! As expected, it was Shigu would was considerate! He praised Fourth Shigu effusively inside. The most basic zhuji dan was one hundred pieces of second grade jingshi. He had heard that this shigu was skilled at concocting pills, but he didn\u2019t know what grade this zhuji dan was.</p><br/><p>\u201cKeep cultivating, and enter zhuji. Your power now, to care for Cold Mist Valley, it isn\u2019t enough.\u201d Fourth Shigu\u2019s icy voice rang in Zuo Mo\u2019s ears.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo, already drowning in joy, hurriedly responded.</p><br/><p>Shi Feng Rong was going to leave when her eyes glanced at Zuo Mo\u2019s face. Her steps instantly stopped, an astounded expression floating on her cold face: \u201cRaise your head.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

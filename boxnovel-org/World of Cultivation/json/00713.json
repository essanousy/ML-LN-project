His mind had recovered to its best state and he had a feeling that he was at the cusp of a breakthrough.</p><br/><p>His clothing was ragged and shredded as though he was a beggar. However, looking at him no one would feel that Wei Sheng was a beggar. He stood with his back straight, head held high, and his presence was like a sharp and oppressive such that no one could look at directly at him.</p><br/><p>He stood up, picked up the black sword and walked barefoot out of the valley.</p><br/><p>A group of mo had gathered outside the mountain valley. When they saw him, they shifted. Everyone had complicated stares full of terror, hate, admiration, and other various emotions. But no one was disdainful.</p><br/><p>This was an enemy that could not be dismissed.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho\u2019s next?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Sheng\u2019s gaze was determined.</p><br/><p>The mo shifted again. This was the fourth day. In these four days, over thirty people had died under the sword of this sword xiu. Up until now, no one had even been able to exchange three blows. The great majority of people hadn\u2019t been able to survive the first strike before dying.</p><br/><p>He really was terrifying!</p><br/><p>So xiuzhe also had people that were like mo gods!</p><br/><p>In this moment, everyone\u2019s mind stopped and a short silence appeared.</p><br/><p>But thinking about the order they had received from their superiors, their hearts shook again.</p><br/><p>If they could not kill him, they were all going to die!</p><br/><p>Red rose up in these people\u2019s eyes. They were like wild beasts forced to the precipice. Someone howled, \u201cEveryone, let\u2019s go together!\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone\u2019s eyes lit up. Daren had only said they could not use battalions, but not that they couldn\u2019t fight together!</p><br/><p>Looking at their numbers and the lonely Wei Sheng, their morale rose! With so many people attacking one person, no matter how powerful the sword xiu was, he could not kill all of them.</p><br/><p>\u201cKill!\u201d</p><br/><p>They cheered as they charged at Wei Sheng.</p><br/><p>Looking at the noisy mo, Wei Sheng\u2019s sword-like gaze did not shake at all. His face seemed to be carved from granite, and completely emotionless. He tightened his grip on the black sword and moved forward!</p><br/><p>In his heart, there was only sword essence!</p><br/><p>The black sword in his hand seemed to respond to the sword essence in his chest and shook lightly.</p><br/><p>It was hungry and wanted to drink fresh blood!</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>\u201cIt probably is a mo marshal behind this,\u201d Pu Yao said with a calm expression. He had spent a long time in the mo territories with the Corps Command in the past and was very familiar with the mo.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Wei also nodded.</p><br/><p>When Pu Yao and Wei agreed on something, it meant that their conclusion was pretty reliable.</p><br/><p>But, mo marshal!</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo felt pressure at this answer. Any mo marshal was the ruler of an entire region. They might have defeated Marshal Yu but that didn\u2019t mean marshal\u2019s were easy to deal with. If Marshal Yu\u2019s battalions hadn\u2019t been busy and unable to come to help, if Marshal Yu had actually fought them seriously, Zuo Mo wouldn\u2019t have had a chance at all.</p><br/><p>The power that a mo marshal possess was really too great!</p><br/><p>Enormous battalions, vast lands, countless experts.</p><br/><p>Each mo marshal represented a titan. The power possessed by those top marshals rivaled the four great sects.</p><br/><p>If everything here was being manipulated by a mo marshal, then it really was great trouble!</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo knew that Pu Yao and Wei\u2019s guess was probably correct.</p><br/><p>With his present reputation, unless there was a mo marshal supporting them, these little factions would not dare to fight against him.</p><br/><p>When he had clues, it was easier to investigate.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo and the other quickly found out which mo marshal was acting against them.</p><br/><p>Marshal Hao, the fifth strongest mo marshal in the Hundred Savage Realm. The mo jie that Zuo Mo\u2019s group were in now was very close to the area ruled by Marshal Hao.</p><br/><p>Marshal Hao was the most likely suspect!</p><br/><p>After investigating, Zuo Mo had a clear understanding of Marshal Hao.</p><br/><p>Compared to Marshal Yu, Marshal Hao could be said to be an old marshal. The number of jie he ruled was three times larger than that of Marshal Yu! He had became a marshal hundreds of years before Marshal Yu.</p><br/><p>Just the little bit of information that they found was enough for Zuo Mo to end all thoughts of fighting the other.</p><br/><p>However, what was puzzling was that if Marshal Yu really had enmity towards them, then they had the power to completely exterminate them. Marshal Hao had more than one hundred battalions under his command. To say of nothing else, just the sheer number would be enough to drown them.</p><br/><p>But why did the other only send little battalions to harass them and slow down their speed.</p><br/><p>Drag down their speed \u2026 \u2026</p><br/><p>What goal did the other have?</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo suddenly jumped up.</p><br/><p>Was there something waiting up ahead for them?</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>\u201cFather!\u201d a middle-aged man said respectfully. \u201cAccording to your orders, Xiao Mo Ge\u2019s speed has slowed down.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot bad.\u201d Marshal Hao had a satisfied expression. His figure was slightly short and stock and he always had a smile on his face. He looked like a normal shopkeeper. He saw the puzzlement on his son\u2019s face and said with a smile, \u201cYou are puzzled?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d The middle-aged person nodded. \u201cIf we really want to slow them, we only need to invite Xiao Mo Ge\u2019s group to be guests here. With Father\u2019s reputation, they definitely would not refuse. That way, we won\u2019t create bad relations with them, and we can still realize our goal. Wouldn\u2019t that be better?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is very good you can use your head.\u201d Marshal Hao looked at his son and said, \u201cHowever, you need to look further. What do you feel is a greater danger to us, Xiao Mo Ge or Xuan Kong Temple?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cXuan Kong Temple!\u201d The middle-aged man said after thinking. \u201cWhile they are our allies in secret , they also have the power to vie for the world and is the greater threat to us.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Marshal Hao smiled coolly. \u201cWhile Xuan Kong Temple appears to have a good relationship with us now, there will be fighting in the future. Xiao Mo Ge has potential but he has a weak foundation. It will not be easy for him to establish himself.\u201d</p><br/><p>The middle-aged person was thoughtful.</p><br/><p>Marshal Hao then said, \u201cHowever, while Xiao Mo Ge doesn\u2019t have strong support, he still has a strong group of subordinates. In this battle between Xiao Mo Ge and Xuan Kong Temple, it will be Xuan Kong Temple\u2019s victory. However, Xiao Mo Ge has a chance to seriously injure Xuan Kong Temple. The best result for us is that Xiao Mo Ge will greatly injure Xuan Kong Temple before dying.\u201d</p><br/><p>The middle-aged person had an expression of realization. \u201cSo Father is using this method to fulfill Xuan Kong Temple\u2019s request and also warn Xiao Mo Ge.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, do not underestimate Xiao Mo Ge. Even I feel jealous of the people he has. Bie Han is a top battle general that can rival Jiang Zhe. They have the ability to make trouble for Xuan Kong Temple!\u201d Marshal Hao smiled darkly. \u201cIf Xuan Kong Temple loses too much in this battle, then Xuan Kong Temple\u2019s reliance on us will grow and our bargaining position improves!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat if Xuan Kong Temple loses?\u201d The middle-aged man instinctively asked. But when the words left his mouth, he felt what he said was a waste of words.</p><br/><p>How could Xuan Kong Temple lose? That wasn\u2019t possible!</p><br/><p>How could Xuan Kong Temple that was even stronger than themselves not be able to take down a Xiao Mo Ge\u2019s small forces? That wasn\u2019t possible.</p><br/><p>Marshal Yu stilled upon hearing this. His expression became strange. He was silent as though he was deep in thought.</p><br/><p>The middle-aged person regretted saying his words of garbage but suddenly heard Marshal Yu slowly speak, \u201cIf Xuan Kong Temple loses, then it will not be good for them.\u201d</p><br/><p>The middle-aged man shook his head. \u201cXuan Kong Temple will not lose. Even if they do, it will not be a heavy blow to them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou do not understand.\u201d Marshal Hao shook his head with a serious expression. \u201cThey must win this battle and they must do it in a beautiful manner! If they truly lose, then Xuan Kong Temple will be in danger. They will have been defeated by their own traitor. The reputation and trust of their top battle general Jiang Zhe will be damaged. Xuan Kong Temple\u2019s secret humiliation will become a weakness exposed to the world. At that time, no matter how large Xuan Kong Temple is, it is just a pile of meat to lure in more wolves.\u201d</p><br/><p>The middle-aged person gaped.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>Tang Fei\u2019s mind was burdened. She had paid attention to the harassment they had recently faced and she had a strong feeling of danger. But on the surface, she maintained her calm and was even more strict in supervising Tangzi Battalion\u2019s cultivation.</p><br/><p>The individual skill level of the members of Tangzi Battalion was outstanding and even better than the city guard she had previously led.</p><br/><p>But their skills in tactics were terrible. It would take a long time before they could reach a satisfactory level. However, that required time and there were no shortcuts.</p><br/><p>Without the tactics binding them together, this was just a group of rabble.</p><br/><p>She hoped to shorten the time needed. If a battle really occurred, Tangzi Battalion that were not well trained in their tactics would become a target the enemy would focus on.</p><br/><p>\u201cTang Daren, Daren is asking for you to come.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Fei\u2019s heart jumped. She knew that it was a meeting about the enemy harassment that had been occurring. She unhesitatingly went with the colonel to Zuo Mo\u2019s tent.</p><br/><p>When Tang Fei arrived, almost all the core members in Zuo Mo\u2019s service were present.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo\u2019s expression was grave. He did not waste words and narrated the results of the investigation as well as his own speculations.</p><br/><p>Everyone\u2019s expressions became serious.</p><br/><p>Gongsun Cha was the first to speak. \u201cIf it really is Marshal Hao, then they do not have good intentions to harass us like this. They definitely want us to fight and weaken each other. Their relationship to the enemy up ahead is strange.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Bie Han\u2019s tone was murderous and the temperature around him dropped.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo nodded but what he asked was another question. \u201cMore importantly, who is up ahead?\u201d</p><br/><p>This was the most crucial puzzle piece. If they didn\u2019t even know who the enemy was, then they didn\u2019t have any chance of victory.</p><br/><p>Gongsun Cha stared at the jie map and said, \u201cWe are going to Nether Spring Jie. There are many that know this, and the enemy definitely knows. That means that they will only chose to attack us at a location that we have to pass through!\u201d</p><br/><p>Gongsun Cha\u2019s words attracted everyone\u2019s attention. Their gazes all moved to the jie map.</p><br/><p>\u201cOn the path that we must pass, having had past interactions with us, knowing our strength, and still daring to fight us \u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone\u2019s gazes moved along the paths on the jie map following Gongsun Cha\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, everyone\u2019s gazes stopped on one place.</p><br/><p>Bie Han\u2019s breathing suddenly became heavy.</p><br/><p>Translator Ramblings: Double-dealing factions \u2026 \u2026 so much politics.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

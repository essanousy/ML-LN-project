It is a happy occasion when old friends to meet.\u201d Li Xian Er smiled without any nervousness.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, yes!\u201d Zuo Mo said with a snicker. He examined Li Xian Er, as though he was seeing a pile, no, a mountain of jingshi</p><br/><p>\u201cLast time in the mo territories, I saw Mister Zuo and wanted to experience it myself. How about a battle today?\u201d Li Xian Er\u2019s face was full of spirit.</p><br/><p>\u201cFighting? Of course there has to be a fight, but it is two of us against you!\u201d Zuo Mo said scoundrelly and then moved without any hesitation!</p><br/><p>As though she was connected with his mind, almost at the same time, A Gui disappeared from beside him.</p><br/><p>Damn it!</p><br/><p>Li Xian Er cursed inside. She had originally intended to use words to herd Zuo Mo to get a chance to fight one on one. Usually, in front of a woman, there were rarely any men that were willing to embarrass themselves and gang up on the woman.</p><br/><p>If there was a one-on-one fight, Li Xian Er had some confidence that she could handle Zuo Mo. This was her only chance to reverse the situation.</p><br/><p>She hadn\u2019t expected Zuo Mo to completely ignore her. She didn\u2019t know if Zuo Mo had seen through her intentions or if he was such a scoundrel.</p><br/><p>But she reacted quickly. The Abyss Fiend Jail had a great effect on suppressing power. She had the Chief Elder\u2019s jinzhi to counteract this force, but the enemy didn\u2019t.</p><br/><p>She may have a chance!</p><br/><p>Her eyes suddenly lit up. If she could kill Zuo Mo, then Mo Cloud Sea was finished!</p><br/><p>Tian Huan had studied Mo Cloud Sea in depth. Mo Cloud Sea had many strong people. Wei Sheng, Gongsun Cha, Bie Han and others. All of them were stars in their own right. However, there was one person that was the pillar of the faction, Zuo Mo.</p><br/><p>Tian Huan thought hard of to find a to kill Zuo Mo but found in the end it was almost impossible. Zuo Mo\u2019s strength was unfathomable. The only other faction in the xiuzhe world who could reach this level was Lin Qian\u2019s Kun Lun.</p><br/><p>But a chance appeared like this!</p><br/><p>Li Xian Er\u2019s fighting spirit rose, a hint of determination flashing through her beautiful eyes.</p><br/><p>Other than the Chief Elder\u2019s jinzhi, she had something else powerful enough to determine the battle\u2014Weaver Girl\u2019s Shuttle!</p><br/><p>Tian Huan\u2019s only shen device raiment!</p><br/><p>The shen power inside her body moving, the shen glyphs appeared on her exposed skin like blooming roses. An exquisite pink battle armor appeared on her body. The layers of pink plates were like the petals of pink flowers. No one would think that this beautiful and slightly adorable battle armor was the strongest shen device raiment of Tian Huan, the [Weaver Girl\u2019s Shuttle].</p><br/><p>Yet in Zuo Mo\u2019s eyes, Li Xian Er wasn\u2019t adorable at all.</p><br/><p>The surging shen power caused Li Xian Er to look like a furious whirlpool. Zuo Mo had to pause. If he charged in now, he would be pulled into the shen power whirlpool.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo knew very well the power of a shen power whirlpool. He, in fact, had a small whirlpool inside his right hand. However, the shen power coming off Li Xian Er was enough to tear him to pieces.</p><br/><p>As expected!</p><br/><p>Just as Zuo Mo retreated, he heard a \u201cbrnng\u201d sound next to his ear.</p><br/><p>The seemingly adorable armor plates on Li Xian Er stood on end. A powerful presence immediately rushed outwards like a twister that lost control!</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo\u2019s expression changed slightly. He reacted quickly, golden light appeared on his right hand. A small axe appeared in his palm. With a shout, he threw the little axe towards Li Xian Er.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo did not stay idle. Three sun shen thorns glided along the ground like nimble vipers that flew silently towards Li Xian Er.</p><br/><p>Li Xian Er flicked out a pink ray of light that hit the sun shen axe. The sun shen axe seemed to be frozen mid-air.</p><br/><p>Her pink-clad feet lightly tapped and a pink ripple spread. Pia pia pia, the three sun shen thorns were crushed into powder.</p><br/><p>In the entire process, she didn\u2019t even look at Zuo Mo.</p><br/><p>Snap snap snap!</p><br/><p>A burst of explosions sounded above her heads. She was like a blurry purple mist. A Gui was like a ghost that flashed in and out of view. The two were attacking at a rapid rate.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo was astounded. He knew that as the first seat of Tian Huan Li Xian Er was strong. The only person that ranked above her was the Chief Elder. However, he found after fighting her that Li Xian Er was stronger than he imagined!</p><br/><p>She was much stronger than the people he had fought just now!</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo took a deep breath, and his spirit burned like fire. No matter what, he had to capture Li Xian Er today! Only if he took down Li Xian Er could he realize his strategy.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo did not hesitate any longer and advanced!</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>Li Xian Er was astounded. The other two was not affected by the find souls!</p><br/><p>What she did not know was that Zuo Mo and A Gui had spent a long time in the Sealed Extinction Battlefield and they had developed a resistance against corruption from fiend souls. Additionally, Zuo Mo cultivated the sun shen power which was the bane to all things corrupt. A Gui\u2019s Undying Shen Power was the complete opposite, having a strong affinity for fiend souls. She could absorb these yin and corrupt existences. This was the perfect battlefield for A Gui.</p><br/><p>Li Xian Er was shocked but not afraid. She was still calm.</p><br/><p>The other did not have the upper hand even two against one.</p><br/><p>Shen power appeared continuously through the shen glyphs. She didn\u2019t have any feelings of tiredness and was filled with fighting spirit. In the sect, the other shidi were not a match for her, and no one dared to really fight against her.</p><br/><p>She had great strength but not a lot of real battle experience.</p><br/><p>Of the two enemies, Zuo Mo\u2019s attacks were broad and open, while A Gui\u2019s were unpredictable. The two completely different styles forced her to focus.</p><br/><p>However, this caused her to improve quickly. After the initial panic, she gradually calmed down.</p><br/><p>The shen glyphs inside her body had an indescribable resonance with the Weaving Girl\u2019s Shuttle. This profound resonance caused her consciousness to be clear and hold every corner of the battlefield in her mind. She could clearly feel the shen glyphs inside her body become more active under the simulation of the Weaving Girl Shuttle. It seemed to be a powerful heart that gave her endless shen power and filled her with strength!</p><br/><p>As expected, only strong enemies could cause him to improve faster!</p><br/><p>Li Xian Er felt unprecedentedly powerful. Her eyes narrowed sharply!</p><br/><p>Some of the Weaving Girl\u2019s Shuttle\u2019s scales started to show exquisite patterns like roses. It was like a sleeping beast gradually waking.</p><br/><p>Her attacks immediately became stronger.</p><br/><p>As she moved, the pink shen power ripples were filled with fatal danger.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo felt the pressure increase.</p><br/><p>The techniques of shen power were not as complex as spells. Most of them were simple, and what determined their power was the strength of shen power!</p><br/><p>Li Xian Er\u2019s shen power was becoming stronger. This was why he was feeling the pressure increase.</p><br/><p>Yet he didn\u2019t feel any fear. Under the stimulation of great danger, the sun shen power inside his body became unusually active. The golden shen power burned like flowing lava and made Zuo Mo feel as though he was about to burn up.</p><br/><p>\u201cKill!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo\u2019s body flashed dark gold. With a shout, the Anti Dragon Claw he held had a layer of blinding golden energy. He swung towards Li Xian Er as though he was holding a two-handed axe!</p><br/><p>At this time, he could not care about something like capturing the enemy live!</p><br/><p>The air started to ignite where the Anti Dragon Claw had passed.</p><br/><p>The golden axe energy flickered and spat like the tongue of the sun\u2019s flame.</p><br/><p>Li Xian Er\u2019s eyes widened. A long pink shuttle flew in front of her. Li Xian Er\u2019s nimble left hand drew in the air lightning fast.</p><br/><p>The long pink shuttle moved through the air at astounding speed. In a flash, a pink rose wall took form. Every flower petal could be clearly seen. They were in layers, exquisite and beautiful.</p><br/><p>The furious sun shen axe cut hard onto the pink rose wall.</p><br/><p>Booom!</p><br/><p>The pink rose wall seemed to be weak. It immediately shattered and flew in all directions.</p><br/><p>Yet Zuo Mo\u2019s expression changed. The Anti Dragon Claw seemed to have cut into cotton. Invisible power was stopping it, or wrapping around it, or pulling at it.</p><br/><p>The sun shen axe that had been unstoppable was halved immediately in presence.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo did not have time to be startled when he felt a stirring of danger.</p><br/><p>He saw pink flowers spinning in the air around him. They had not dissipated!</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo was experienced in battle. With a look he knew there was a killing move coming!</p><br/><p>Immediately, he waved the Anti Dragon Claw around to protect his body.</p><br/><p>Brrng!</p><br/><p>The delicate pink flower petals dancing in the wind suddenly tensed, becoming hard, and then shot at Zuo Mo!</p><br/><p>Ding ding ding!</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo\u2019s Anti Dragon Claw moved and securely protected him. The pink flower petals hit the circle of light like raindrops on banana leaves and caused sprays of sparks.</p><br/><p>These seemingly delicate flower petals were astoundingly powerful.</p><br/><p>Powerful ripples from the collision caused Zuo Mo\u2019s feet to continue to sink into the ground. In a flash, all of Zuo Mo\u2019s calves had sank into the rock.</p><br/><p>The storm of attacks forced Zuo Mo to instinctively wave the Anti Dragon Claw!</p><br/><p>At this time, Li Xian Er was fighting fiercely with A Gui.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>Li Xian Er could clearly feel that A Gui was more difficult to deal with than Zuo Mo. Other than the unpredictable and erie attacks, A Gui\u2019s grey crystal battle armor was not ordinary.</p><br/><p>The grey crystal armor caused A Gui to merge with her surroundings no matter where she appeared. Adding on A Gui\u2019s eerie and unpredictable movements, even Li Xian Er felt a headache.</p><br/><p>What shocked her even more was that A Gui\u2019s shen power contained a great presence of death.</p><br/><p>Such a great death energy could only appeared on something dead. Li Xian Er almost didn\u2019t believe her eyes.</p><br/><p>A Gui saw Zuo Mo\u2019s situation and a thread of purple flame appeared in her eyes.</p><br/><p>Woosh, a layer of purple flames appeared on the surface of the [Undying Ghost]. The flames were extremely thin as they silently burned.</p><br/><p>Two short bone daggers appeared on A Gui\u2019s hands. The short bone daggers were shrouded in purple flames. The grey [Undying Ghost] spread like the wings of a bird, the purple flames flowing within.</p><br/><p>The silent purple flames seemed to be able to consume everything in the surroundings. At the border of the flames was a circle of deep blackness.</p><br/><p>Shock suddenly flashed through Li Xian Er\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>Shen device raiment!</p><br/><p>This was a shen device raiment!</p><br/><p>While the attributes of power were completely different, she was familiar with the unique presence of the shen device raiment. She was almost immediately sure that this was a true shen device raiment!</p><br/><p>Heavens!</p><br/><p>Other than [Arsonist], Mo Cloud Sea had a second shen device raiment!</p><br/><p>Editor\u2019s note: Poor poor Li Xian Er. Arsonist, Undying Ghost, Zong Ru\u2019s staff, and Lan\u2019s armor have been revealed to some people in the world. But there has not been a true reveal for City Destroyer, Wei Sheng\u2019s God-Killing Blood Sword, Zuo Mo\u2019s Dad\u2019s shen device, and the shen nucleus. Even then Lan\u2019s armor hasn\u2019t had a true reveal. So 4 psuedo shen devices and 4 true shen devices, 8 total. Nine if they capture Li Xian Er and take Weaver Girl\u2019s Shuttle. And the Gravestone Armor too\u2026 Hoard much? Greedy greedy zombie.</p><br/><p>Translator Ramblings: To discuss WanderingGummi\u2019s point, the shen nucleus can\u2019t be used as a weapon to fight at this point, it\u2019s just a potential shen device. You can use it to make a shen device but Zuo Mo hasn\u2019t managed to forge it yet. The [Ghost] which started off the whole thing with Zuo Mo\u2019s family is incomplete. Zuo Mo only has the pieces from Xi Xuan and Xuan Kong Temple, he\u2019s still missing the Tian Huan and Kun Lun pieces.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

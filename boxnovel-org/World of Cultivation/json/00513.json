Bu Si Dong stopped walking and when he saw the incomer, he showed happiness. He darted forward and threw a punch at the other\u2019s shoulder excitedly. \u201cHaha! A Zhe, you didn\u2019t leave either! I thought you already left!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLeave? And go where?\u201d A Zhe laughed helplessly. His figure was slender and scholarly. There was a star-shaped mark on his forehead. He had grown up with Bu Si Dong from childhood. Even though the two of them had later entered different sects, they had kept in contact.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are right!\u201d Bu Si Dong\u2019s voice was emotional. He quickly gave a sunny smile. \u201cWhat are you doing now? Did you find work to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cConstructing the city.\u201d A Zhe pointed at the city which was now coming together, \u201cIsland Master wants to rebuild Xu Ling City. I\u2019m responsible for a mid-sized defense formation.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWow!\u201d Bu Si Dong showed a shocked expression. \u201cYou\u2019re this strong now? I had thought you were only able to forge second and third grade paper seals.\u201d</p><br/><p>A Zhe said exasperatedly, \u201cI\u2019ve lived this many years! Ah, if it wasn\u2019t that Sect Leader had wanted to leave Cloud Sea Jie, I wouldn\u2019t have left the sect.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe same with me.\u201d Bu Si Dong sighed lightly. Both of them were in low moods. For them, their sects were like a second home. They were naturally reluctant to leave.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s not speak about this!\u201d Bu Si Dong gathered his mind and said proudly, \u201cRight, I\u2019ve been selected for Black Turtle Camp! Isn\u2019t it great?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re that strong?\u201d This time, it was A Zhe\u2019s turn to be shocked. \u201cI heard that the selection was very strict. It\u2019s over now that an amateur like you was able to get in. I feel slightly worried about my future.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bu Si Dong rolled his eyes. \u201cI have to protect people like you in the future, I\u2019m the one that should feel grief!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is your honor, Little Bu!\u201d A Zhe laughed as he patted Bu Si Dong\u2019s shoulder. Then he said concernedly, \u201cI heard the training there is very difficult. Do you have enough ling dan? I have some here \u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need, no need!\u201d Bu Si Dong shook his hand and then said emotionally and in a show-off manner, \u201cIn reality, I have never thought there would be a day that I cultivate with such luxury. We get two pieces of third-grade jingshi every day and one Primary Replenishing Dan. We have to finish using it. Every week, we will get a Cleansing Dan to rid ourselves of the impurities and purify the ling power.\u201d</p><br/><p>A Zhe\u2019s mouth was wide open as he stammered, \u201cThat \u2026 \u2026 that is too luxurious!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMotherf***er, I finally know how those large sect disciples cultivate! With such a cultivation method, would they fail? Just absorbing ling power from the jingshi and the medicinal power from the Primary Replenishing Dan would take up half of the day. Then it is battle formation training. If we are the slightest bit incorrect, we can only wait to get punished!\u201d Thinking about the pains of cultivation, Bu Si Dong smacked his lips emotionally.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t complain after benefiting!\u201d A Zhe was full of admiration. \u201cI heard long ago that the island is rolling in wealth. I hadn\u2019t thought they would be this wealthy! You really gained greatly!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, yes!\u201d Bu Si Dong said with pride. \u201cIt is a pity I am not a sword xiu. Turtle Island is best at training sword xiu. You haven\u2019t seen Teacher Wei\u2019s sword essence, it is uncanny!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, work well. In the future, if you make it, then you can protect me.\u201d A Zhe\u2019s expression was matter-of-fact.</p><br/><p>Bu Si Dong thought of a matter and hurriedly said, \u201cA Zhe, you can go try for Golden Crow Camp. That place is filled with xiuzhe skilled in forging, seals and dan-making. I heard those admitted get Golden Crow Fire!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGolden Crow Fire? Fourth-grade Golden Crow Fire?\u201d A Zhe\u2019s eyes were wide as though he had saw a ghost.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d Bu Si Dong nodded forcefully. \u201cI hear that they teach all kinds of forging methods. All of the ling dan that we use in cultivation are made by Golden Crow Camp. I went with Ma Fan Daren once and there were so many good things there that are just thrown on the floor. They can be seen everywhere, my heart hurt just looking at it!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhich direction is Golden Crow Camp?\u201d A Zhe\u2019s eyes became bloodshot as he asked.</p><br/><p>Bu Si Dong pointed, \u201cOh, that place over there.\u201d</p><br/><p>Without another word, he turned and sprinted away.</p><br/><p>\u201cAt least say farewell \u2026 \u2026\u201d Bu Si Dong stilled and then he muttered.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>The people streamed in. Turtle Island was like an enormous magnet that attracted innumerable numbers of xiuzhe. The xiuzhe that were not willing to leave Cloud Sea Jie only had this one chance. Turtle Island quickly was unable to accommodate so many xiuzhe. Adding on that there were many restricted areas on the island that housed things like the Sun Shen Tree. There were too many eyes. If someone recognized it, then it would not be good.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo decided to rebuild Xu Ling City.</p><br/><p>Originally, Lil\u2019 Miss planned to use Turtle Island as bait to attract the mo military. But looking at the flow of people that was continuously coming in, they had to throw out this idea.</p><br/><p>Fortunately Vermillion Bird Camp which had the cloud wings and the nimbus clouds were very mobile and were suited for guerilla combat.</p><br/><p>The progress of Xu Ling City was very quick. There was a large amount of manpower. Everyone knew that time was tight and worked hard.</p><br/><p>Presently, Zuo Mo was very wealthy. This was the benefit of being the first to stand up against the mo army.</p><br/><p>Merchants like Liao Qi Chang who came to Zuo Mo in search of protection naturally were willing to also invest. The businesses that were leaving Cloud Sea Jie would donate the things they were unable to transport to Zuo Mo. It was a favor, one they might be able to use in the future.</p><br/><p>When he encountered this kind of situation, Zuo Mo accepted them. What? Not easy to move? No matter, I will get people to move it!</p><br/><p>Those with keen eyes gambled on Zuo Mo. Many merchant houses proactively supplied all kinds of aid in the rebuilding of Xu Ling City.</p><br/><p>How many of the merchants, that could survive in the cruel market, have poor insight?</p><br/><p>Under this kind of situation, Zuo Mo\u2019s power quickly grew. A strange prosperity appeared around Turtle Island.</p><br/><p>After finalizing their goal, the people under Zuo Mo\u2019s command displayed furious battle intent and high morale.</p><br/><p>This might be the biggest \u201cbusiness deal\u201d that Zuo Mo ever engaged in. His previous business deals were child\u2019s play compared to this business deal. When the fighting started, Zuo Mo perceptively realized that the enormous opportunity contained in the fighting.</p><br/><p>Maybe ge was really born to do business?</p><br/><p>As to what to do after achieving their goal, who knew. Zuo Mo was too lazy to think. This really was a great chance but it was not so simple to grasp it.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, everything seemed to be progressing smoothly at present.</p><br/><p>But Zuo Mo did not let it go to his head. He judged calmly.</p><br/><p>He was clear that this inflation in power was like a pile of bubbles. If they could not defeat the mo army, these bubbles would instantly pop.</p><br/><p>Looking at the quiet A Gui, Zuo Mo\u2019s restless heart also calmed down.</p><br/><p>\u201cA Gui, I\u2019m very sorry. We need to wait for the fighting to finish before we can search for a Water Cloud embryo,\u201d he said apologetically.</p><br/><p>A Gui sat silently and motionlessly.</p><br/><p>The two stared at each other in silence.</p><br/><p>\u201cA Gui, who are you?\u201d Gazing at A Gui, Zuo Mo said quietly. A while later, he lowered his head. His expression was slightly depressed. \u201cWho am I?\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly a hand reached over and grasped Zuo Mo\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo stilled and raised his hand abruptly.</p><br/><p>A Gui\u2019s face was still as wooden as usual but there was a weak light in the deep reaches of the empty eyes.</p><br/><p>A Gui had moved!</p><br/><p>This was the first time A Gui moved of her accord after she was wounded.</p><br/><p>For some unknown reason, Zuo Mo suddenly felt his heart warm up. This simple move made him feel extremely comfortable and his dejection flew away.</p><br/><p>A Gui\u2019s hand was very beautiful. Just like her feet, it did not have one flaw.</p><br/><p>Other than being slightly cold.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo gripped A Gi\u2019s hand back.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you, A Gui.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>\u201cI object!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI also object!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDaren, you cannot enter into a dangerous situation, this is too dangerous!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo looked at the excited group. He had predicted this reaction. Wei Sheng did not speak but it was clear from his expression that he did not agree with Zuo Mo\u2019s thoughts. He was not the only one. Lil\u2019 Miss, Shu Long, and the others were shaking their heads.</p><br/><p>Everyone knew what Zuo Mo\u2019s safety meant to their troops. If something happened to Zuo Mo, this group would likely fall apart instantly.</p><br/><p>Any suggestion that could cause that situation would receive everyone\u2019s opposition.</p><br/><p>Gradually, people calmed from their excitement. Their eyes landed on Zuo Mo. Zuo Mo was smiling as usual and did not show an excited expression. Seeing everyone calm down, he slowly opened.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve thought deeply about this.\u201d</p><br/><p>No one spoke. Everyone was waiting for Zuo Mo to keep speaking. After interacting with Daren for so long, they also knew it was extremely difficult to change Daren\u2019s mind after he made a decision.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo one can replace Gongsun Shidi and Vermillion Bird Camp in fighting against the mo military. The battle style of Guard Camp is not suited to guerrilla combat. Shu Long\u2019s personality is steady and is skilled in defense rather than offence. This time, Guard Camp\u2019s mission is to attack the other\u2019s base. I feel that no one is more suited than I am.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing someone open their mouth to speak, Zuo Mo waved his hand and continued.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs for the danger, do not mention it in the future. We are fighting with our backs against the wall, there is no retreat. Unless we want to return to what we were before,\u201d Zuo Mo looked around and said in a deep voice, \u201cAre you willing?\u201d</p><br/><p>The audience was completely silent.</p><br/><p>Before setting their goal, no one had realized this problem and felt it was nothing. But once they set their goal, it was like poking a hole in the umbrella. No one was willing to go back to their previous muddling days.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen we made this decision,\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo\u2019s gaze slowly swept across everyone. Everyone felt a strong pressure.</p><br/><p>\u201cwe no longer had the right to fear the consequences!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo\u2019s tone was aloof but these words were like a sharp sword deeply cutting into stone, and engraving themselves into people\u2019s hearts!</p><br/><p>Translator Ramblings: Another chapter about how things are being set up. I think Fang Xiang likes ramping up the tension too much. Zuo Mo sounds so serious and mature, but then I remember this is also the person a few chapters ago that stripped people of their underwear.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

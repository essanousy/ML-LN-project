Again and again, Zuo Mo practised the finger movements. The fingers moved faster and fast, but suddenly, with a crisp sound, the fingers paused and turned into a mess.</p><br/><p>This was already the seventh time.</p><br/><p>Practicing finger motions today, he wasn\u2019t successful once.</p><br/><p>Exhaling a long breath, he supressed the fretfulness in his heart. The finger motions of [The Art of Flora] were complicated. If his mind wasn\u2019t calm, it was easy to make mistakes. But how could Zuo Mo calm down his mind? Two months have passed but he still couldn\u2019t complete one Embryonic breath. That wasn\u2019t what made him most discourage was that he was unable to find the door. Before, no matter if he was studying [Little Art of Cloud and Rain] or the other four spells in the jade stick that he had brought, even if he temporarily could understand, but at the very least, he knew in which direction to work in.</p><br/><p>But after he fixed his consciousness using [Embryonic Breathing Spiritual Cultivation], he couldn\u2019t find the direction. He wanted to spend more time, however, the amount of time spend practising [Embryonic Breathing Spiritual Cultivation] couldn\u2019t be over four hours. The ball of light hadn\u2019t explicitly stated why it couldn\u2019t surpass four hours but Zuo Mo was suspicious it could cause harm so he didn\u2019t dare to experiment.</p><br/><p>According to the directions in the ball, he only needed to stop breathing with the nose and mouth before he would be able to turn to embryonic breathing.</p><br/><p>But not matter how he close his breathing, the instinct for living always made him unconsciously open his mouth. He couldn\u2019t even find the feeling of the embryonic breathing.</p><br/><p>In the following two months, other than his consciousness recovering to full health, he hadn\u2019t made any new breakthroughs.</p><br/><p>In the rest of the time, he could only practise other spells. What was unexpected to him were that the great speeds his ling energy and spellwork improved. Especially his spellwork. Other than [Little Art of Cloud and Rain] and [Art of Aged Gold], in just two short months, he managed to elevate the remaining three spells to the second level.</p><br/><p>This kind of speed, even he found it unimaginable.</p><br/><p>Other than joy, his heart was also worried. [Embryonic Breathing Spirit Cultivation] hadn\u2019t improved at all. There was only one month left until the three month deadline. Whether a reversal of blood flow was as horrifying as Pu Yao said, he wasn\u2019t clear, but any of the feelings he got from the four words were not good ones. He tried to ask for aid from Pu Yao, but Pu Yao\u2019s sneer instantly provoked him.</p><br/><p>For some unknown reason, he was easily enraged in front of Pu Yao.</p><br/><p>The ling grains had a bountiful harvest. Compared to the other shixiong, the output of his ling grains were clearly higher. In the disaster last time, even though his ling grains were affected, but the situation had been much better than Old Black and the others. After that, he basically didn\u2019t try to conceal it. [Art of Flora], [Art of Earth Energy], [Art of Aged Gold] were all used. Only [Art of Crimson Flame], due to the fact that it was opposite the yin attribute of the ling grains, was not used.</p><br/><p>Adding on the five mu of ling fields in the yard, the overall output far surpassed his estimates.</p><br/><p>Taking out the rent for the sect, he kept a portion of the ling grains for his own use before selling all of the rest. His income was sixty two pieces of second-grade jingshi. Adding on the fifteen pieces of second-grade jingshi from last last time from Li Ying Feng, his total assets now totalled seventy seven pieces of second-grade jingshi. The reason that he had profited so much was that the price of ling grains were increasing.</p><br/><p>Even Old Black, so seriously affected by the calamity, had enough to pay the sect\u2019s rent. It could be seen just how much the price of ling grains had grown on the market.</p><br/><p>And the other thing that made Zuo Mo worried was Hao Min Shijie and Luo Li Shixiong. Up until now, those two still hadn\u2019t returned to the sect. In the past few days, he had found that some of the ling herbs in the medicine fields of Cold Mist Valley were showing hints of illness. Taking care of ling herbs was an extremely meticulous job, much more care was needed than taking care of ling grains. His own [Little Art of Cloud and Rain] could only guarantee their water intake. From the perspective of the plant, this was just its most basic requirement.</p><br/><p>In the short term, nothing could be seen, but as time passed, it was easy for problems to occur.</p><br/><p>At present, he was hard pressed. His purse had become the fullest it had ever been yet he didn\u2019t have any joy.</p><br/><p>The dammed [Embryonic Breathing Spiritual Cultivation]!</p><br/><p>The horrid Hao Min Shijie and Luo Li Shixiong!</p><br/><p>And the twice-accursed Pu Yao!</p><br/><p>Why was it that ge has such a kind heart yet have to face such evil? He wanted to cry.</p><br/><p>In the previous few days, other than [Embryonic Breathing Spiritual Cultivation], he spent all of the other time on [Art of Aged Gold]. In the five arts that a ling plant farmer required, at least three had to reach the third level. Zuo Mo\u2019s [Little Art of Cloud and Rain] had already reached the fourth level. And in the four remaining arts, the one most likely to reach the third level was [Art of Aged Gold].</p><br/><p>Today, he didn\u2019t have the mood to practise [Art of Aged Gold]. He widened his eyes, frantically running over every word in [Embryonic Breathing Spiritual Cultivation] in his head. If his face could have expressions, then right now it would be twisted into a ball.</p><br/><p>One month!</p><br/><p>Only one month left!</p><br/><p>Biting the corner of his lip, he carefully thought over every word. Pu Yao was still sneering. This completely aroused the stubbornness in Zuo Mo\u2019s bones.</p><br/><p>The damned bastard!</p><br/><p>By now, he finally understood why he was easily provoked in front of Pu Yao. Pu Yao could easily tear away a person\u2019s disguise. He would explicitly or implicitly guide the other\u2019s emotions and expose the other\u2019s most basic personality. And once he knew that, to someone of such cunning like Pu Yao, swearing wouldn\u2019t really provoke him, Zuo Mo didn\u2019t try to restrain his own emotions anymore.</p><br/><p>If he couldn\u2019t vent, he felt that he would, under the damned renyao\u2019s attacks, die!</p><br/><p>As to suffering a little, he didn\u2019t care. Even if he was obedient, would Pu Yao be kind to him? That would be clear even if one used a toe to think. It was better to get some back verbally, and he would feel better.</p><br/><p>Ge is a little stalk of grass, no matter how you blow, you can\u2019t blow me down!</p><br/><p>Thud thud thud!</p><br/><p>A series of urgent knocks sounded.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Mo ge, Mo ge!\u201d</p><br/><p>It was Old Black, why did he come?</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo controlled his fretful heart and stood to open the door.</p><br/><p>Opening the door, as expected, it was Old Black\u2019s wind-blown face, but there was a unfamiliar male standing beside him.</p><br/><p>Seeing Zuo Mo, Old Black released a breath: \u201cOh good, you\u2019re here!\u201d</p><br/><p>Finishing, he introduced the male beside him: \u201cThis is Wei Sheng Shixiong.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Sheng. Zuo Mo was slightly shocked. This male stranger in front of him was the head of the outer sect disciples, Wei Sheng. He couldn\u2019t help staring an examination. Not very tall, thick and broad shoulders, square face, thick brows. He looked extremely honest, but the flickers of light that occasionally came from the pair of eyes made one unable to underestimate him.</p><br/><p>\u201cWei Sheng Shixiong!\u201d Zuo Mo made a greeting. Wei ShengShixiong rarely showed his face outside but his reputation within the outer sect disciples was extremely high. To have good relationships with this kind of person, there were only benefits and no drawbacks.</p><br/><p>Wei Sheng scrutinized Zuo Mo for a few seconds and returned the greeting, smiling warmly and responding: \u201cZuo Mo Shidi is really hidden deep.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo was slightly shocked but he wasn\u2019t too surprised. Wei Sheng Shixiong\u2019s cultivation was higher than him. His mouth was humble: \u201cShixiong over-compliments. Come, let\u2019s come in to talk.\u201d</p><br/><p>The three walked into the yard.</p><br/><p>Wei Sheng gazed at the surroundings and praised: \u201cSuch a big yard!\u201d</p><br/><p>And Old Black\u2019s two eyes were rooted to the ling fields in the yard. A beat later, he said, vexed: \u201cWhy didn\u2019t I think of this way! Isn\u2019t this exempt from the rent?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo smiled, saying: \u201cI\u2019m just taking advantage. I don\u2019t know which shixiong built this yard, and put in five mu of ling fields. But it was a pity that it was barren for two long, the grade dropped one. One grade ling fields, at least it\u2019s better than nothing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Old Black gave a sorrowful expression: \u201cSuch a pity to waste the good ling fields.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo didn\u2019t speak. He didn\u2019t know if it was that Old Black had farmed for too long but towards ling fields, Old Black had an unique affection.</p><br/><p>\u201cEven the yard is all ling fields. Zuo Mo shidi really lives up to being a farming madman. It seems that I found the right person this time.\u201d Wei Sheng added.</p><br/><p>The three sat down under the old tree. Zuo Mo quickly boiled a pot of tea. His [Art of Crimson Flame] was only on the first level, and he could only form a small ball of fire which wasn\u2019t very useful. But it was convenient to use to lit fires.</p><br/><p>\u201cShixiong was looking for me?\u201d Zuo Mo didn\u2019t decline and headed straight for the main topic: \u201cHave you encountered something? Shixi might be limited in cultivation, but if I can add in an effort, I will certainly do so.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Sheng didn\u2019t stand on courtesy: \u201cComing this time, it really is to trouble Shidi with something.\u201d He carefully took out from his bosom a jade box. Opening the jade box, a flow of extremely thick ling energy wafted out, a stalk of ling herb inside. This ling herb was about thirty centimeters long, leaves fire red, a black line running through. Contrasting against the red leaves was a completely green fruit.</p><br/><p>If the muscles on his face weren\u2019t paralyzed, Zuo Mo\u2019s expression would have been very rich. The ling plant that he couldn\u2019t name was shockingly thick with ling energy. He cautiously took it up, putting it in front of his eyes for examination. The ling plant seemed to have been carved out of a piece of red fire jade, translucent and glowing.</p><br/><p>Definitely third-grade and above!</p><br/><p>In this segment of time, as he helped Hao Min shijie take care of the medicine fields in Cold Mist Valley, his knowledge in the subject of ling herbs broadened greatly. He might not be able to call out its name, but from the appearance and the ling energy it emitted, it was better than most of the ling herbs in Cold Mist Valley.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis Fire Dragon Grass, its grade is a rare third-grade, and was very hard to find.\u201d Wei Sheng\u2019s expression was solemn: \u201cThere is still a length of time before I reach zhuji. In this time, I ask for Shidi to help take care of this fire dragon grass for me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTake care?\u201d Zuo Mo was surprised. His response was extremely quick, \u201cIs Shixiong using this fire dragon grass to zhuji?\u201d</p><br/><p>If Wei Sheng didn\u2019t say this was fire dragon grass, Zuo Mo probably wouldn\u2019t have recognized it. Was it because it was third-grade? This fire dragon grass was very different from the one in Zuo Mo\u2019s memory.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Wei Sheng nodded, his face calm.</p><br/><p>At the side, Zuo Mo and Old Black couldn\u2019t help but give an admiring look. There were many ling herbs that were required for zhuji, but only a few of the primary herbs were the crucial ones. Fire dragon grass was one of them but not the best choice because it needed to be consumed raw and its effects were violent. Someone without great willpower might not be able to endure the violent nature and cause the ling energy of the body to dissipate. These years, there were very few that would use it to finish zhuji.</p><br/><p>However, even though fire dragon grass was akin to a poison, but if one overcame it, it was extremely beneficial to the cultivation. The effect was much better than normal ling herbs.</p><br/><p>But third-grade fire dragon grass, think how violent the effects would be!</p><br/><p>In just a few words, Zuo Mo felt respect form for this shixiong that he just met for the first time. He had heard some of the rumors about Wei Sheng Shixiong. Supposedly, Shixiong had been orphaned from young. After he was taken into the sect, he was entranced with cultivating the sword. In order to learn a better sword art, he didn\u2019t even hesitate about going to Luo Li Shixiong\u2019s place to be a sword servant.</p><br/><p>Meeting him today, Zuo Mo found that Wei Sheng Shixiong lived up to the rumors.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

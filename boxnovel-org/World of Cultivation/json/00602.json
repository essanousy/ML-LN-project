He had, long ago, noticed the group of people nearby. It was clear that the group was targeting them and it could be seen that the other had a very low opinion of them. Unrestrained laughter could occasionally be heard from the groups.</p><br/><p>One two three four \u2026 \u2026 seven!</p><br/><p>A Wen counted inside. There were seven groups of mo, each of unknown origins surrounding them. They were clearly being targeted.</p><br/><p>Right now, A Wen was not the same na\u00efve youth that relied on only his talent to survive in the arena. He had fought in large scale battles, seen rivers of blood. Both Pu Yao and Wei had great affection for him and his talent, putting great effort into teaching him.</p><br/><p>He was the strongest hardship guard in Guard Camp, even stronger than Shu Long!</p><br/><p>A the only shadow mo guard his abilities were completely different from the other hardship guards. He had unparalleled speed so he had always acted as the scout.</p><br/><p>Even though the troop was only barely more than one hundred people, Shu Long still methodically sent out scouts.</p><br/><p>A Wen had quickly discovered these groups of bandits. The other\u2019s unrestrained nature caused murderousness to rise but A Wen did not act by himself, instead he reported the information to Shu Long.</p><br/><p>\u201cSeven groups of bandits \u2026 \u2026\u201d Shu Long made a thoughtful sound.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, all the groups have different head counts. The largest is about five to six hundred people, and the smallest is two to three hundred people,\u201d A Wen reported in detail, \u201cThere are about three thousand people in total.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing this, Ye Ling\u2019s expression changed slightly.</p><br/><p>Nan Yue, Cang Ze, and the others stared at each other. They were completely shocked at this news. Three thousand people! When they looked at the hundred or so people around them, they felt a wave of coldness rise.</p><br/><p>Three thousand against one hundred. In other words, each one of them had to defeat thirty bandits.</p><br/><p>This was a ratio that seemed hopeless!</p><br/><p>They suddenly felt great admiration for Shu Long, as his expression was unchanged after hearing the news and there was no trace of panic.</p><br/><p>As expected of the leader of Guard Camp, he had the mannerisms of a great general!</p><br/><p>\u201cYe Ling, what do you think?\u201d Shu Long suddenly asked Ye Ling.</p><br/><p>Ye Ling\u2019s expression had changed but he forced himself to maintain calmness. \u201cDaren what we need to do now is increase our speed and charge out of this jie before they finish surrounding us!\u201d</p><br/><p>Shu Long did not nod. He was thinking.</p><br/><p>He quickly shook his head and refused Ye Ling\u2019s suggestion. \u201cOur speed is not fast. They are bandits and are skilled in quick raids. They have an advantage of speed and there probably are more people waiting for us ahead .\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye Ling\u2019s face was white. Shu Long\u2019s analysis was to the point. \u201cThen what do we do?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFight!\u201d Shu Long\u2019s eyes were filled with murderousness as he said in a deep voice, \u201cWe mustn\u2019t just fight, we need to fight them until their forces are crippled! Only then will we have a chance to charge out of this jie.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone, including Ye Ling and Nan Yue, was stunned. One hundred against three thousand, how did Shu Long Daren want them to fight?</p><br/><p>Wasn\u2019t that just seeking death.</p><br/><p>One hundred against three thousand, there wasn\u2019t any chance of victory!</p><br/><p>Shu Long seemed to know their thoughts and said sternly, \u201cWe are a trained battalion group, they are just a bunch of bandits. No matter how many there are, they are just rabble, there is nothing to fear.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye Ling gritted his teeth. \u201cHow does Daren want to fight?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe will only have one chance. If we cannot destroy them in one strike, and they scatter, we will be harassed the entire way and then be in a reactive position, \u201cShu Long said gravely.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo inspected the mo matrix on the young female\u2019s body. Now that he was half recovered, he didn\u2019t need Ka Zhuo to help him examine her.</p><br/><p>His movements were very slow, and his expression was grave.</p><br/><p>When the mo matrix\u2019s maturation was interrupted, it actually had caused irreparable damage. The mo matrix on the female\u2019s body was unusually complex, the White Fang mo matrix was unique to the White Fang Snake mo. If it had complete maturation, she would enter general level and her mo physique would naturally form.</p><br/><p>So young and she had touched the door to the general level. This young female was astoundingly talented.</p><br/><p>The White Fang mo matrix was extremely unique. It could absorb power continuously and compress it to become more condensed. When it was cultivated to the extreme, one could compress all the power in the body to a point smaller than the point of a needle. This needle point was so powerful it could penetrate anything. Zuo Mo guessed that it could even penetrate a mature \u201cDomain.\u201d</p><br/><p>Pu Yao and Wei examined the White Fang mo matrix curiously. None of them had ever seen the White Fang mo matrix before.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is slightly interesting. No wonder the White Fang mo matrix ranks sixteenth among the general rank mo physiques,\u201d Pu Yao said interestedly. He was an expert in mo matrixes and with a glance, he understood the core fundamentals.</p><br/><p>Wei looked at the young lady and then took his gaze away. He wasn\u2019t too interested in mo matrixes but he had not seen this one before. Now that he saw the real thing, he was satisfied.</p><br/><p>\u201cSixteenth among general level mo physiques?\u201d Zuo Mo said in shock.</p><br/><p>\u201cEn, a very strong mo physique. However what its greatest feature is that if one reaches general level, the mo physique automatically forms!\u201d Pu Yao suddenly said, \u201cHow about you get some of this girl\u2019s blood. Her blood is probably strange.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei who had been silent suddenly opened, \u201cThis idea is pretty good. I know some methods of blood sacrifice, maybe you can possess this bloodline as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo thought and then shook his head. \u201cNo I feel that my Great Day mo physique will soon have a breakthrough, the feeling is very strong.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true. You cultivate the Great Day mo physique. The other mo physiques cannot compare to it in terms of their foundations,\u201d Pu Yao nodded and said in agreement.</p><br/><p>Wei asked Zuo Mo, \u201cYou plan on saving her?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSave her?\u201d Zuo Mo shook his head. \u201cI do not have such great ability. This damage caused by the mo matrix has also damaged her blood and flesh. I cannot save her.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei became silent.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo did not speak more and continued to examine the mo matrix of this young female.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t have any plans of saving her whatsoever. He couldn\u2019t do it, but even if he could, he didn\u2019t plan too. He was planning on making trouble for Ceng Yi once he had his breakthrough to get even over the matter of being forced against his will.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t have the habit of showing someone the right side of his face after they slapped the left.</p><br/><p>But this White Fang mo matrix was really profound. Even Pu Yao didn\u2019t have many general level mo matrixes.</p><br/><p>This was a rare chance!</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo\u2019s fingertip moved along the mo matrix. The unusually profound White Snake mo matrix caused him to sink into an immersed state.</p><br/><p>Without knowing it, a thread of shen power was drawn out of his finger.</p><br/><p>When his finger traced the mo matrix to the forehead of the young female, something happened!</p><br/><p>A great suction force suddenly formed at the forehead of the young female. Zuo Mo\u2019s shen power broke free of his control and furiously flooded towards the young female\u2019s forehead.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo was astounded!</p><br/><p>What was this?</p><br/><p>But no matter how hard he tried, the shen power did not listen to his orders and furiously flooded into the forehead of the young female.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo instantly panicked. If this kept on going, wasn\u2019t he going to be drained dry?</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo who had just recovered half of his strength could not accept a fate of being drained dry again.</p><br/><p>In a panic, Zuo Mo\u2019s right hand pushed against the young female\u2019s body trying to push her away.</p><br/><p>Boom!</p><br/><p>The mo matrix on the young female\u2019s body suddenly lit up. The blinding light broke through the room and a faint shadow of a white snake appeared in the sky!</p><br/><p>It could be seen from far away!</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>\u201cJie master Ceng, you really will not reconsider it?\u201d the youth in front of Ceng Yi asked coldly.</p><br/><p>The youth had two slight bumps on his forehead. This was a trait unique to those with the bloodline of dragons and this trait would only appear in those that had reached the general level. The youth\u2019s face was white as jade, his body tall, but his expression was cold and proud.</p><br/><p>His gaze was filled with haughtiness.</p><br/><p>There were two mo, one thin and one fat, standing next to the youth. The fat one had a jolly smile on his face and looked extremely welcoming. The thin one had a cold expression and his eyes were half-lidded.</p><br/><p>\u201cI do not need to consider it!\u201d Ceng Yi\u2019s expression was unreadable. He slowly said, \u201cThis one is nothing special as a jie master but it is a free existence. This one will have to reject Marshal Yu\u2019s favor!\u201d</p><br/><p>At this time, Ceng Yi\u2019s expression suddenly changed. At the same moment, the thin one next to the youth suddenly opened his eyes, and the fatty\u2019s smile disappeared.</p><br/><p>Without any words, all of them flew out of the room at almost the same time.</p><br/><p>A building in the distance was giving off great light. Amongst the light, the white shadow of a snake flickered in and out of view.</p><br/><p>\u201cLian\u2019er!\u201d Ceng Yi\u2019s expression changed dramatically as he shouted. Before the shout ended , he disappeared.</p><br/><p>\u201cCeng Yi as a White Fang snake mo as expected!\u201d The youth snorted and then joy came onto his face. \u201cThis is a good chance! His daughter is at such a crucial moment, he won\u2019t dare refuse. Otherwise, hmph hmph, he can\u2019t blame us for being vicious!\u201d</p><br/><p>Finishing, the trio disappeared.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo had never expected the other\u2019s mo matrix to be so strange. He was extremely panicked. When he discovered the light given off by the young female\u2019s mo matrix was so bright, he knew it was not good.</p><br/><p>How could such a big disturbance not be noticed by Ceng Yi?</p><br/><p>Damn it!</p><br/><p>This was not a good time to face Ceng Yi but Zuo Mo didn\u2019t have the time to regret it. He already detected Ceng Yi\u2019s presence. No, there were also three more generals!</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo was shocked. Four generals, even if he had a breakthrough, he definitely was not a match!</p><br/><p>\u201cLian\u2019er!\u201d Ceng Yi called out panickedly. His eyes were filled with worry and held none of the cruelness and indifference he usually had.</p><br/><p>\u201cJie Master Ceng, I feel you should consider what I just said,\u201d the youth said in a strange tone from behind Ceng Yi.</p><br/><p>Ceng Yi was infuriated. \u201cYou \u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha, Jie Master Ceng, this is for your own good,\u201d the fat one spoke with a smile, \u201cas long as Jie Master makes a decision, we three are willing to help your daughter mature the mo matrix at the price of expending our own mo skills.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ceng Yi wavered.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo knew that it was not good. If Ceng Yi really agreed, then the one with the most terrible outcome would definitely be him.</p><br/><p>But Zuo Mo didn\u2019t have the power to speak at this time. All of the shen power in his body was flowing towards the brow of the young female.</p><br/><p>At this time, the suction at the young female\u2019s brow suddenly disappeared. Zuo Mo didn\u2019t even have the time to be happy before a strange shen power erupted out of the young female\u2019s forehead, and flowed into Zuo Mo\u2019s body along his finger.</p><br/><p>This burst of shen power was extremely strange. When he looked inside his body, he could clearly see that the returning shen power was silvery white.</p><br/><p>Once the silvery white shen power entered Zuo Mo\u2019s body, it was like a spark that ignited all the remaining shen power in Zuo Mo\u2019s body!</p><br/><p>Boom!</p><br/><p>It felt as though something exploded inside Zuo Mo\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>Translator Ramblings: Ceng Yi is a good father.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Otherwise, we would need to have spent more effort. Careful that we can\u2019t finish Boss\u2019 mission.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re really going to kill all of them?\u201d Lei Peng grumbled.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou think? Don\u2019t think you can get out of it!\u201d Nian Lu brushed the bangs in front of his forehead as he said, \u201cBoss said it in front of this many people. If we can\u2019t finish, hee hee. We cause Boss to lose face, that means we cause Lil\u2019 Miss to lose face. If we lose Lil\u2019 Miss\u2019 face, you don\u2019t need me to say the rest.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know that.\u201d Lei Peng adopted the mannerism of one looking for defeat. \u201dI just feel that there is no joy in defeating this kind of enemy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEnemy? Oh, you are wrong, they are just fat sheep. The pleasure in killing fat sheep is to strip them, not defeat them.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two didn\u2019t have the time to chat. Lil\u2019 Miss\u2019 orders quickly passed over. The two rapidly gathered their minds and turned around.</p><br/><p>Vermillion Bird Camp that had just thrust their way to the back lines of the enemy had suddenly turned and charged back.</p><br/><p>The chaotic mess of over one thousand xiuzhe that had just been scattered by the charge instantly started to wail. Lacking effective organization, they ran in all directions in panic.</p><br/><p>But there was no place to escape. They immediately met the Vermillion Bird Camp xiuzhe that had already sneaked their way to the flanks. After a few dozen were killed in a row, the rest of people were scared half to death and turned to run.</p><br/><p>The platoons that swam at the ranks did not pursue them. They were only responsible for herding the xiuzhe that were preparing to flee back into the big group.</p><br/><p>The Vermillion Bird Camp that had turned back to kill seemed to be herding sheep as they continuously herded the one thousand people that had been robbed of their courage.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>Hong Jun Xuan\u2019s limbs felt cold, his expression hopeless as he stood dazedly in the sky. He continuously saw the Outer Hall xiuzhe move past him, their faces filled with terror and hopelessness. All of his set up had been disrupted. The Outer Hall xiuzhe that came flooding into the remaining three troops.</p><br/><p>Terror quickly spread. The troops that had already had low morale instantly collapsed, they had been routed.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>On top of the lucky cloud, Zuo Mo looked at the chaotic battlefield. He couldn\u2019t help shaking his head, and said, \u201cThis kind of troop is only strong on the surface.\u201d He then smiled, and snickered, \u201cIt\u2019s all ours.\u201d</p><br/><p>The female xiu stood by him like a wooden mannequin.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo actually was just talking to himself. He didn\u2019t hope that the female xiu would give a response. If the female xiu suddenly talked, he would definitely be scared.</p><br/><p>The Vermillion Bird Camp\u2019s simultaneous shouts of \u201cSurrender to not die\u201d could be heard from far away. The hopeless Outer Hall xiuzhe all surrendered so easily that even Zuo Mo was shocked.</p><br/><p>The direction of the entire battle was unexpected to everyone. Even Zuo Mo and Gongsun Cha almost couldn\u2019t believe that more than four thousand people could give up resisting so easily, and collectively surrender.</p><br/><p>The other people were stunned.</p><br/><p>The middle-aged person was the first to respond. He shook his head and sighed. \u201cWhat the Outer Hall does is not righteous in the end. A troop constructed in this manner had nothing to speak in terms of discipline. There\u2019s no problem usually, but if they encounter danger, they cannot withstand a single blow.\u201d</p><br/><p>The large male objected, \u201cIf it is the elite from our sect, it is unknown who will win.\u201d</p><br/><p>The middle-aged person smiled while he spoke, \u201cThe elite from the sect can compare to this troop, but what about the battle general?\u201d</p><br/><p>The large male stilled. A thousand soldiers were easy to obtain, but one general was hard to request. It was hard to raise a battle general. There were rarely those that could come out of the wild. Only large sects would be able to educate some. Of all the licensing offices, the battle general licensing office was always the least populous, but after the incident at Bloody Sky Metropolis Jie, the battle general classes were as common as rain.</p><br/><p>Of course, those were just to con people of jingshi.</p><br/><p>But from the side, it was possible to see the desire of all sects regarding battle generals. Presently, battle general had become the most popular and employable profession. The sect had three or five battle generals, but they only had Bronze Medals.</p><br/><p>The battle general of this troop definitely was not just a Bronze ranked general.</p><br/><p>The level above Bronze Medal was the Silver Metal. Each Silver battle general was a rarely found talent. The price to recruit a Silver battle general was even higher than a jindan sword xiu.</p><br/><p>Was he a Silver battle general \u2026 \u2026</p><br/><p>The large male stared at Gongsun Cha\u2019s bashful and delicate face. He almost couldn\u2019t believe it.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>Rong Wei was just as shocked as he was. However, Rong Wei wasn\u2019t just postulating, she was sure of it. She herself was a Bronze battle general, and had a more accurate judgment of Gongsun Cha\u2019s skill.</p><br/><p>This young person with a shy and bashful smile like that of the neighbour\u2019s little boy definitely was a Silver ranked battle general!</p><br/><p>Clear Sky Sect really kicked a metal board this time!</p><br/><p>Rong Wei stared at the battlefield without a word. Behind her were the shocked faces of the compound guards.</p><br/><p>Her gaze suddenly landed on the black young person sitting on the lucky cloud. That was the master of Golden Crow city. She imperceptibly furrowed her brows. The master of Golden Crow City seemed to be admiring the bare feet of the female.</p><br/><p>She hadn\u2019t expected him to be a lusty person.</p><br/><p>She felt pity inside. The future of such a young Silver battle general was unlimited, but he was under the command of such a lusty person. She felt great regret.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo stared at the perfect bare feet of the female xiu, saying to himself, \u201cTell me, will Clear Sky Forefather come this time?\u201d</p><br/><p>After the previous experience with the Nine Turn Sky Soil Disk, Zuo Mo\u2019s relationship with the female xiu had unconsciously became closer. Even he didn\u2019t seem to realize it.</p><br/><p>The bare feet of the female xiu would unconsciously attract his attention. At the beginning, he had been slightly embarrassed, but afterwards, he found that the female xiu did not care at all, so he did it openly.</p><br/><p>This was in pursuit of beautiful things! Zuo Mo\u2019s reason was righteous.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe should probably come soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo didn\u2019t move aside his eyes as he spoke to himself.</p><br/><p>\u201cClear Sky Old Forefather \u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The female xiu was silent.</p><br/><p>Gathering the spoils was a very familiar practice for Vermillion Bird Camp. Bao Yi also hurried out of Golden Crow City to help. It didn\u2019t even take two hours for all of the captives to be completely stripped clean.</p><br/><p>The spectating xiuzhe all watched with burning eyes. They wanted to go and get some benefits as well. However, after just seeing the strong combat capabilities of Vermillion Bird Camp, no one dared to act.</p><br/><p>When Hong Jun Xuan and the other Clear Sky Sect disciples were taken to Zuo Mo, each of them only had their pants left.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you dare to even harm one of our hairs, the Old Forefather won\u2019t have mercy on you!\u201d a Clear Sky Sect disciple said severely.</p><br/><p>Crazy, Zuo Mo rolled his eyes. Look at the situation, saying these words, did he not want to live?</p><br/><p>Hong Jun Xuan suddenly shouted at this disciple, \u201cShut up!\u201d</p><br/><p>He dismissed the disciple and turned to Zuo Mo to say, \u201cWe are all core disciples of Clear Sky Sect. If Sir can give us a way to survive, we are willing to pay an appropriate price.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo\u2019s eyes lit up. Nothing was more attractive to him than jingshi, but his mouth went, \u201cOh, but you do not have anything right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease give me a paper crane. This one believes the price will definitely satisfy Sir.\u201d Hong Jun Xuan recovered his previous calm.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo thought, and then shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Hong Jun Xuan instantly started to panic. If the other did not agree, then his little life was in danger. He thought the other was unsatisfied. \u201cTwo hundred pieces of fourth-grade jingshi? This price \u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The shidi in the surroundings all inhaled sharply as they looked in disbelief at Second Shixiong. None of them had expected Second Shixiong to be so wealthy.</p><br/><p>Where had Second Shixong gotten this much jingshi from?</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo still shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd half of the profits from the Outer Hall!\u201d Hong Jun Xuan said painfully, \u201cSir should also know how much the Outer Hall can earn in a year. If Sir allows us to survive, the Outer Hall is still under our control \u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSecond Shixiong, you\u2019re crazy \u2026 \u2026\u201d a Clear Sky Sect disciple couldn\u2019t resist saying.</p><br/><p>\u201cShut up!\u201d Hong Jun Xuan\u2019s face was black, tendons bulging. \u201cDo you want to die here?\u201d</p><br/><p>The other people instantly stopped talking.</p><br/><p>Hong Jun Xuan was like a gambling addict that had lost everything. He looked at Zuo Mo. \u201cHow about it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo still shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d Hong Jun Xuan was almost going insane.</p><br/><p>\u201cTo kill Clear Sky Old Forefather,\u201d Zuo Mo said calmly.</p><br/><p>All the Clear Sky Sect disciples first stilled and then laughed as though they had heard an impossible joke.</p><br/><p>Hong Jun Xuan almost couldn\u2019t breathe from laughing so hard. After a while, he stopped, and said with a mocking smile, \u201cDon\u2019t joke. You want to kill Old Forefather? Just you guys? I feel that you should consider my previous suggestion.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo said with interest, \u201cOh, what? Our power isn\u2019t enough?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not just that it isn\u2019t enough.\u201d Hong Jun Xuan said with a cold smile, \u201cOld Forefather has jindan cultivation, his power limitless. You may have some power, but in front of Old Forefather, you basically have no room to move. How about it? Consider my suggestions, people have to be realistic.\u201d</p><br/><p>A hint of pride unconsciously came onto Hong Jun Xuan\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo did not have any interest in wasting words with them. He turned and left. Everyone\u2019s perspective was different. Hong Jun Xuan and the others could not understand many of his thoughts. He waved his hand without turning his head. \u201cDon\u2019t keep these people, make sure they won\u2019t come back to haunt us in the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hong Jun Xuan and the other\u2019s faces instantly turned as pale as paper.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>After such an encounter, Golden Crow City\u2019s name had truly spread through Little Mountain Jie. The rise of this group of people and this city was completely without warning. No one knew their origins.</p><br/><p>But even the dumbest person knew that the final battle between Golden Crow City and Clear Sky Sect was coming.</p><br/><p>No matter if it was the Black Processing Meditation mat or this big battle made it so the two could only fight to the death.</p><br/><p>After this great battle, the gates of Golden Crow City remained tightly shut and under heavy guard. No one knew what was happening inside the walls. The sounds of explosions occasionally came from inside the city. Some xiuzhe that were daring desired to fly up into the sky to look, but they were almost killed by the hard lightning released by the formation battle watchtowers.</p><br/><p>The Golden Crow City that was entirely preparing for battle made the other xiuzhe feel the tenseness of the situation even more. There was no one within one hundred li of Golden Crow City. Even though they wanted to see with their own eyes like they did previously the great battle that was coming, but they didn\u2019t dare this time.</p><br/><p>Coming from Clear Sky Sect this time would only be one person, Clear Sky Old Forefather.</p><br/><p>\u2013\u2013 The only jindan remaining in Little Mountain Jie!</p><br/><p>The following days were cloudy and unspeakably foreboding.</p><br/><p>A storm was approaching.</p><br/><p>Translator Ramblings: Battle generals have their rankings but the author did an oopsie on the naming. In this chapter, it is \u201cmoon silver\u201d but over the rest of the story, he always used \u201cwhite silver.\u201d Then there is \u201cgreen copper\u201d before that, and in the future, these is \u201cyellow gold.\u201d To simplify things, and to avoid having to figure out if it is moon silver or white silver, I am just using bronze, silver and gold. It is also somewhat superfluous to repeat the color of the metal for silver and gold. Bronze is copper with tin added and it turns green if buried which is what the Chinese used to name bronze.</p><br/><p>Poor Hong Jun Xuan. He doesn\u2019t get it.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

His gaze was poisonous and hateful.</p><br/><p>\u201cProbably,\u201d his best friend said without confidence, \u201cat this time, refusing the draft is punishable by military law! No matter how powerful his is, he won\u2019t dare to oppose a military corp.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha!\u201d Yu Zi Zhou laughed smugly. \u201cNo matter if he accepts or not, it won\u2019t be easy for him. Haha! This is an unwinnable situation! I will let him know how death is written!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour move is too poisonous!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha! Your praise makes my heart bloom! Haha!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Heavy Earth Corps sent a draft notice for Xiao Mo Ge?\u201d Ji Li Yu was slightly astonished.</p><br/><p>\u201cEn.\u201d Ji Cheng nodded repeatedly. \u201cYu Zi Zhou did it. The commander of Heavy Earth Corps is his uncle. A lot of people know this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYu Zi Zhou is not a good person, as expected,\u201d Ji Li Yu said with a cold smile. \u201cBut this move is vicious!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do we do?\u201d Ji Cheng was slightly excited. \u201cXiao Mo Ge\u2019s good days have reached an end!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUs? What does this have to do with us?\u201d Ji Li Yu\u2019s eyes flashed. \u201cYu Zi Zhou has lost his reason to his hatred. Making moves like this at this time, what would the people above think?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou mean \u2026 \u2026\u201d Ji Cheng made a sound. He was not dumb and understood she meant.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey will fight their battles, while we just sit and watch,\u201d Ji Li Yu said decisively. \u201cAt such a sensitive time when we are losing at the front lines, there are no disadvantages to being passive.\u201d She changed the topic, \u201cI heard that Mu Xi has come back?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEn, she\u2019s been back for a while now.\u201d Ji Cheng nodded. He then reacted and said with astonishment, \u201cYou think well of her?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFind a time for us to visit Mu Xi.\u201d Ji Li Yu\u2019s eyes flashed with a different kind of light. \u201cI have a feeling that Palace Lake Wood Clan is going end up with her as the main leader.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not possible.\u201d Ji Cheng\u2019s expression was disbelieving and he said unconcernedly. \u201cShe\u2019s so young! Also, she didn\u2019t have any great battle achievements on her trip this time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s wait and see.\u201d Ji Li Yu giggled.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>Mu Xi narrated her entire journey in detail without missing any detail. The old person in front of her was the person she respected the most, and was also the leader of Palace Lake Wood Clan. In her eyes, he was also the wisest person.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou say that the xiuzhe are also investigating this matter?\u201d the clan leader said in a deep voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Mu Xi respectfully replied. \u201cWe did not detect that they were hiding near us at all. If an accident had not occurred to them, their scheme might have worked.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStars in Daytime \u2026 \u2026\u201d the clan leader murmured to himself, \u201cwhich daren would it be?\u201d</p><br/><p>Mu Xi sat respectfully and did not disturb the clan leader from thinking. Truthfully, even now, she did not fully understand the significance of Stars in Daytime.</p><br/><p>A while later, the clan leader shook his head and refocused.</p><br/><p>Mu Xi really could not contain her curiosity any more. \u201cClan Leader, what is Stars in Daytime?\u201d</p><br/><p>The clan leader explained, \u201cThe so-called Stars in Daytime is when one uses the power of the stars to heal the wounds of the body. If it is during the day, stars would appear on the entire sky, this is Stars in Daytime. Only the strongest of yaomo possess this kind of unnatural power.\u201d He then grimaced and said, \u201cThis kind of skill only exists in the legends. I have not heard of anyone in the present that possesses it. Also, because the manifestation indicates he is injured, a daren would only cast such a secret technique in the most dangerous of times.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mu Xi finally understood. \u201cNo wonder!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNow you know why the Council of Elders is so panicked and reacted so urgently,\u201d the clan leader said with a smile, \u201cIt shows great favor that the Elder Council gave such a mission to you, they are nurturing you. Now that the front lines are successively losing, it is a rare opportunity for you young people.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mi Xi calmly nodded, \u201cXi\u2019er will definitely work hard.\u201d</p><br/><p>A flash of satisfaction flashed through the eyes of the clan leader. His expression then became stern as he said, \u201cThis man, Lin Qian, you speak of is probably a Kun Lun disciple, since he is able to pinpoint your origins immediately. The disciples of Kun Lun are always outstanding. If you fight against them in the future, you cannot take them lightly!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d Mu Xi obediently replied. That calm and handsome figure appeared in her mind\u2019s eyes, and her fighting spirit rose. After returning, she had repeatedly thought back to the battle exchanges she had with Lin Qian. But even now, she could not find his weakness.</p><br/><p>She had to admit that the other\u2019s skills as a commander were higher than hers! She had the advantage of greater strength but still could not do anything to the other. If this was a mock battle in a battle general class, it would be judged as her defeat.</p><br/><p>As expected from a Kun Lun disciple!</p><br/><p>No matter if it was skill or conduct, it made others respect them.</p><br/><p>She was not demotivated,but it was the opposite. The other\u2019s appearance had caused her to understand how stupid and narrow it was for her compare herself with only those inside the yao art house. This was her starting point, she truly understood that a vast world had appeared in front of her.</p><br/><p>Noticing the fighting spirit that rose in Mu Xi\u2019s eyes, the experienced clan leader instantly understood what Mu Xi was thinking and couldn\u2019t help but smile slightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis matter will not end like this. Gaining the aid of a daren that can cause the Stars in Daytime is worth any price. This, we understand, the daren of the Council of Elders understand, but the xiuzhe also understand.\u201d The clan elder was very clam. \u201cSince all clues now point to Wu Kong Sword Sect, then we have a direction.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mu Xi was slightly puzzled. In her view, they should not enter into the conflict over the matter.</p><br/><p>Almost as though he saw Mu Xi\u2019s puzzlement, the clan leader said with a smile, \u201cOur Palace Lake Wood Clan has some power, including influence in the territory of xiuzhe. However, the Council of Elders is probably also investigating in secret.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen aren\u2019t we wasting our efforts?\u201d Mu Xi asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha. It seems that we are wasting our efforts,\u201d the clan leader chucked, and a sharp light flashed through his eyes, \u201cbut what if this daren is an elder that survived from the Thousand Year Battle?\u201d</p><br/><p>Mu Xi first froze and then she unhesitatingly shook her head. \u201cThat is impossible!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy is it impossible?\u201d The clan leader\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cI feel this is the most likely possibility! Otherwise, why did this daren appear in the territory of xiuzhe? A daren that could cause Stars of Daytime, it wouldn\u2019t be strange for them to have some life-saving secret technique. Also, this relates to a secret that not many people know.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat secret?\u201d Mu Xi unconsciously asked. But when the words came out, she regretted it. It was almost not appropriate for her to ask this.</p><br/><p>Just as she was feeling insecure, the clan leader did not conceal and said, \u201cIn that great war, everyone knows that we yaomo lost but there are only a few that know some elders were captured! They were imprisoned in the Yao Subduing Tower. If I haven\u2019t guessed wrong, this unknown daren most likely escaped from the Yao Subduing Tower.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mu Xi gaped and stared with wide eyes as she listened to the story.</p><br/><p>Seeing Mu Xi\u2019s expression, the clan leader smiled warmly. \u201cDon\u2019t find it strange. If this daren really escaped from the Yao Subduing Tower, then they are definitely worth our Palace Lake Wood Clan investing all our power.\u201d</p><br/><p>He did not explain more. There were some things that Mu Xi would understand only when she reached a certain age.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>\u201cHeavy Earth Corps?\u201d Zuo Mo felt puzzled. However, when he saw the attitudes of the surrounding four people, his face instantly darkened.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe draft notice has already been delivered to Sir\u2019s follower, Nan Yue. Please report to the base of Heavy Earth Corps within ten days,\u201d one of the people stared at Zuo Mo and said in a deep voice. He did not know who he had offended, but for him, this order held no influence.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have not heard of any Heavy Earth Corps and don\u2019t have any interest!\u201d Zuo Mo\u2019s expression was icy.</p><br/><p>Even though he did not understand why the other had come to find him, but in his view, the other\u2019s attitude was enough to indicate a problem. Surrounded by four people, he was not afraid.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou wish to resist a military order?\u201d This person\u2019s expression darkened and his gaze became vicious.</p><br/><p>The other three people also had vicious glares as their bodies moved forward. A murderous energy instantly locked onto Zuo Mo. Even though they had heard that Zuo Mo had reconstructed the Wasteland Beast Chessboard, but in the eyes of this military combat yao, that wasn\u2019t anything. Those genius that boasted so much were like bubbles that popped on impact, once they were placed on the battlefield.</p><br/><p>The leading combat yao smirked. His gaze when he looked at Zuo Mo was like he was looking at a lamb waiting for slaughter. He did not object to giving the other a lesson in the Ten Finger Prison. Which one of those proud young masters didn\u2019t obey under his hands?</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo\u2019s eyes narrowed and a cold light flashed through them. His upper body waved lightly like that of a clock pendulum.</p><br/><p>The pupils of the leading combat yao suddenly shrank. In his field of vision, the Zuo Mo seemed to disappear! What shocked him even more was the other\u2019s decisiveness. Attacking proactively without a word!</p><br/><p>He was both shocked and angry. He bellowed, \u201cYou dare \u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The movement of his hands were even faster than his angry shout. After long years of training, it was instinct to react once encountering danger. A ball of dirt yellow light lit up in his hand and a shell of dirt yellow light appeared around him.</p><br/><p>This was one of the most widely used military intermediate yao arts of the Heavy Earth Corps\u2014[Earth Defence Art]. Proven through combat, it had outstanding defensive capabilities.</p><br/><p>Being able to enter the third prison, his power was not weak. As one of the top combat yao in the military corp, he had absolute confidence in his power. Even more, he also had three powerful fellows with him.</p><br/><p>Four against one, it made him feel as though he was using a sword to kill a chicken.</p><br/><p>Ping!</p><br/><p>A clear shattering sound caused his bellow to suddenly stop. A golden fist rapidly grew larger in his eyes!</p><br/><p>How was this possible!</p><br/><p>His expression froze. The earth defense art that he had always relied on was so easily broken by the other?</p><br/><p>A military intermediate yao art at his full power \u2026 \u2026</p><br/><p>Was \u2026 \u2026was \u2026 \u2026 smashed to bits by one punch \u2026 \u2026</p><br/><p>Time seemed to suddenly slow at this moment. The other\u2019s fist grew larger and large in his eyes. Everything was so clear. He was even able to see the complex patterns that densely covered the golden armor on the other\u2019s fist.</p><br/><p>The terror was like a ferocious beast that escaped and rampaged in his body.</p><br/><p>Translator Ramblings: Zuo Mo is being underestimated \u2026 \u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Zuo Mo was shocked.</p><br/><p>Just as Zuo Mo was going to suffocate, the restless power inside his body suddenly exploded!</p><br/><p>Countless streams rampaged and charged in Zuo Mo\u2019s body like a flood.</p><br/><p>The invisible pressure pushing down on him disappeared with a pop.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo felt his body lighten. His breathing started again. The powers inside of his body lost their target and gradually calmed.</p><br/><p>From beginning to end, Zuo Mo did not move. No one knew of such a violent change inside of his body.</p><br/><p>Ceng Yi\u2019s eyes were thoughtful and then he smiled slightly. \u201cThis one has a favour to ask of Mister Zuo.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>Ka Zhuo carefully inspected the unconscious young female on the bed. The features of the young female were similar to Ceng Yi and should be Ceng Yi\u2019s daughter or someone close. The young female\u2019s features were exquisite, the warm and soft red lips slightly open, the delicate brow slightly creased as though she was enduring pain.</p><br/><p>A short time later, Ka Zhuo started to sweat. It had taken him a long time to understand what had happened after he was woke up. After the initial panic, he quickly calmed down. If he encountered something as dangerous as this by himself, he would have started trembling long ago, but since his teacher was behind him, he didn\u2019t worry so much.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo\u2019s endless bag of tricks had completely persuaded Ka Zhuo. Ka Zhuo even felt that if it was about mo matrixes, there was nothing that would be a problem for Teacher.</p><br/><p>As Ka Zhuo continued his inspection, the mo matrix on the young females body gradually floated to the surface.</p><br/><p>The ivory white mo matrix was hard to detect on the pale skin if one did not look closely. Zuo Mo was slightly surprised. This was the first time he saw ivory-colored mo matrixes.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t simple.\u201d Wei\u2019s expression was grave. \u201cThe white fang snake mo\u2019s greatest barrier in life is breaking through to general level. If they can, they will form the white fang mo physique, if they fail, they will end up like this. Ivory white mo matrixes is an immature mo matrix.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAn immature mo matrix?\u201d It was the first time Zuo Mo heard this term.</p><br/><p>Wei flicked a look at Pu Yao. Pu Yao snorted and then spoke, \u201cThe mo matrix on the body is not unchanging. When you reach a new level, the mo matrix on your body will change as well, and becomes more mature, more perfect, this is what maturation is. However, if something happens during the process and the mo matrix\u2019s maturation is interrupted, it will become like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo that is how it is!\u201d Zuo Mo\u2019s understanding of mo matrixes increased by the day. He instantly understood when Pu Yao pointed it out.</p><br/><p>He quickly found this was a troublesome problem.</p><br/><p>This kind of problem was not easy to solve.</p><br/><p>As expected, Wei said helplessly, \u201cThis kind of state, in the mo world, is incurable!\u201d</p><br/><p>Pu Yao was also silent. He might study mo matrixes but this kind of state wasn\u2019t in the scope of his study.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo felt his head swell.</p><br/><p>Ka Zhuo finished his last test and retreated with his forehead full of sweat. He looked hopefully at Zuo Mo. He felt there wasn\u2019t anything that could stop Teacher.</p><br/><p>\u201cMister Zuo, how is it?\u201d Ceng Yi asked. His almond-yellow snake pupils looked coldly at Zuo Mo.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo felt his scalp prickle. He knew if he didn\u2019t have anything, he would not be able to walk alive out of here today.</p><br/><p>\u201cJie Master is a White Fang Snake mo!\u201d Zuo Mo suddenly said.</p><br/><p>\u201cMister Zuo is knowledgeable.\u201d A hint of surprise flashed across Ceng Yi\u2019s eyes. White Fang Snake mo was a rare kind of mo and not many people knew of them. Ceng Yi felt some hope that the other was able to recognize it at a glance and the implied skill and knowledge behind it.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhite Fang Snake mo will reach the White Fang mo physique when they enter general level. I had thought it was a rumor and not that it is actually so.\u201d As Zuo Mo talked, his mind whirled furiously.</p><br/><p>Ka Zhuo\u2019s mouth was gaping widely. For him, this was extremely new.</p><br/><p>Ceng Yi\u2019s eyes narrowed slightly and then he laughed lightly. \u201cMister Zuo is very knowledgeable, this one feels respect. Then Mister Zuo should have some explanation about Daughter\u2019s situation. Mister Zuo, please explain.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo said indifferently, \u201cHonored Miss has failed in the breakthrough, the maturation of her mo physique has been interrupted. Right now, her body is probably in chaos, and her life in danger.\u201d</p><br/><p>A light flashed across Ceng Yi\u2019s eyes. Zuo Mo felt as though Ceng Yi suddenly turn into a giant, the great pressure almost making him unable to breathe.</p><br/><p>This time, the chaotic turbulence inside his body did not move.</p><br/><p>Ceng Yi instantly realized that this reaction was not beneficial and restrained his presence. Zuo Mo felt his body relax and he could breathe again.</p><br/><p>General level and having a mo physique, the power was terrifying!</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo was shocked inside. He heard Ceng Yi say in a low voice, \u201cThis one has found more than one hundred matrix awakening masters and only Mister Zuo could identify the ailment. This one feels admiration. Since Mister Zuo can correctly diagnose it, then Mister Zuo must have a solution.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo said through his teeth, \u201cTruthfully, it is the first time this one has seen such a situation. Even though the cause is known, this one doesn\u2019t have a good grasp on the solution.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ceng Yi gave a smile, \u201cMister Zuo is too modest.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even though Ceng Yi had a smile on his face, Zuo Mo felt that smile was glacial.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo knew that he could not refuse. His mind whirled furiously and he continued, \u201cThis one is not being modest. Even though it is the first time this one has seen such an ailment, but this one has heard that it is incurable from many sources.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIncurable!\u201d Ceng Yi stilled. A hint of grief shone in his eyes but he quickly recovered.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo\u2019s heart shook. This mo\u2019s ability to control his emotions was astounding!</p><br/><p>\u201cThis one believes Mister Zuo would have a way,\u201d Ceng Yi said slowly.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo knew the crucial time has come. He said calmly, \u201cThis one has some ideas but will only know if they are plausible after trying. However, this one will first say if Jie Master wants this one to do this, you need to have enough patience. Life is important. This one\u2019s ideas needs to carry out a lot of experimentation.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing this, Ceng Yi smiled and said, \u201cThat is to be expected. I will give the order to fully cooperate with Mister Zuo. However, in order for Mister Zuo to have better results, Mister Zuo will have to temporarily reside in Stone City.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo had expected this. He nodded and said, \u201cAlright.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ceng Yi was very satisfied with Zuo Mo\u2019s perceptiveness. He believed that if Zuo Mo was restricted to this place, Zuo Mo wouldn\u2019t dare to play any tricks.</p><br/><p>Then Zuo Mo was taken to a nearby compound. There were two brigadier mo guarding at the door.</p><br/><p>Only now did Zuo Mo release a breath.</p><br/><p>He had never experienced the power suppression of higher levels on lower levels. If his mind was not this strong, he would have lost his mind facing Ceng Yi.</p><br/><p>However, when he thought of the two brigadier mo outside the door, Zuo Mo grimaced. This time, they wouldn\u2019t be able to escape.</p><br/><p>Even if his power recovered, there wouldn\u2019t be any hope.</p><br/><p>Ceng Yi had general level strength and the White Fang mo physique, that was enough to suppress Zuo Mo.</p><br/><p>His gaze landed on A Gui\u2019s expressionless face. For some unknown reason, Zuo Mo suddenly thought of A Gui\u2019s beautiful and stunning bare feet that he saw through the strands of hair blown up by the wind.</p><br/><p>On the rough rock, the beautiful and exquisite bare feet were flawless and tempting. But this pair of feet trembled from the burden with every step in the wind and sand.</p><br/><p>There was no stopping as she carried him step by step.</p><br/><p>His line of sight was mostly occluded but these short glimpses made the situation clear.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo\u2019s eyes flashed. The low mood flew away. He felt full of energy. He was not demotivated by the situation in front of him. He believed he could overcome this obstacle.</p><br/><p>A Gui \u2026 \u2026 I\u2019ll definitely take you and leave here!</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo said to himself.</p><br/><p>He started to ponder his present situation. Even though he was in a cage, he had a chance to breathe. In the short term, he didn\u2019t need to worry about his safety.</p><br/><p>This amount of time was enough for him to do something.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>Ba La looked at the inventory list and felt great pain. Ever since that strange matrix awakening master came, countless materials had been taken from his place. Ba La was the housekeeper of the Jie Master. Every time, he had to give his permission for these lists. Even though the Jie Master had already ordered him to do his best to satisfy what the other needed, he still felt pain.</p><br/><p>However, he didn\u2019t dare to do anything about the requests. Everyone knew the love Jie Master had towards Miss. If he provoked the Jie Master because of this, it was a road leading to death.</p><br/><p>He gritted his teeth and agreed to hand over the materials.</p><br/><p>Ba La understood his master very well. The Jie Master wasn\u2019t one that was easily fooled. If that damned matrix awakening master could not save Miss when the time came, he would die terribly!</p><br/><p>In the hands of the Jie Master, dying was not an easy matter!</p><br/><p>None of the matrix awakening masters that had come before had left alive.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo\u2019s little yard was still guarded by two mo. They were only responsible for standing guard and were not concerned with what was happening inside.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you familiar with the mo matrixes I taught you?\u201d Zuo Mo asked Ka Zhuo.</p><br/><p>\u201cFamiliar.\u201d Ka Zhuo nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s start.\u201d Zuo Mo did not chat. Time was extremely important for him.</p><br/><p>Ka Zhuo carefully started to engrave the Thousand Layer Iron Cowrie mo matrix on Zuo Mo\u2019s right palm. The mo matrix was not complex and Ka Zhuo finished in four hours.</p><br/><p>Then Ka Zhuo picked up one of the medicinal fluids that had been prepared. These fluids were made using materials they\u2019d gotten from Ba La with the excuse they were for experiments. Ka Zhuo dipped into the fluid and started to brush it onto the mo matrix.</p><br/><p>A burning feeling came from his palm. Zuo Mo was joyed.</p><br/><p>Ka Zhuo used the next medicinal fluid and brushed again and again.</p><br/><p>The feeling of burning increased. Zuo Mo felt as though his palm was going to burn to ash, his entire palm was red like liquid metal.</p><br/><p>Ka Zhuo took out a vial that glowed with a serene blue light, the last medicinal fluid.</p><br/><p>The moment the medicinal fluid touched the mo matrix, a feeling of cool comfort formed. Zuo Mo almost groaned in pleasure.</p><br/><p>When the serene blue medicinal fluid touched the mo matrix, it quickly permeated into the mo matrix.</p><br/><p>The entire mo matrix quickly became serene blue and covered Zuo Mo\u2019s entire palm.</p><br/><p>When the medicinal fluid entered the last stroke of the mo matrix, something changed!</p><br/><p>Translator Ramblings: Zuo Mo must still have his zombie face \u2026 \u2026 he can bluff like crazy. Really, he should have become a professional gambler.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

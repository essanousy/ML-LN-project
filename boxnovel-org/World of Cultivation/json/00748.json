It was popular and filled with people. There were many beauties, the fragrance of wine spread around the air, and those that were conversing would exchange greetings with smiles.</p><br/><p>Anyone of slight fame in and around Bu Zhou City had received an invitation from the Tang Family. There were famed experts from surrounding towns that had rushed over.</p><br/><p>Other than the Tang Family\u2019s unrivaled power in this area, many people had come for another person, Grandmaster Xiao Yun Hai[1]. It was not strange for a grandmaster that had just forged an earth level mo weapon to be pursued to this degree.</p><br/><p>Then they heard that it had been Grandmaster Xiao Yun Hai\u2019s request to hold this banquet, many people had thoughts about the situation.</p><br/><p>While the Tang Family had forcefully stolen Grandmaster away, many people still desired to meet him and form friendly relationships, especially the experts that were strong and lacked mo weapons. They were like flies that smelt meat and all ran over.</p><br/><p>Feng Xin Zi had a sunny smile on his face. He had refused the advances of countless beautiful young female mo. He was holding a cup of wine as he sat beside Ji Li Yu.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou were wrong.\u201d Ji Li Yu\u2019s tone was slightly mocking. \u201cHe\u2019s the new mo weapon grandmaster.\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Xin Zi shrugged his shoulders. \u201cMaybe Xiao Mo Ge also knows to forge mo weapons/\u201d</p><br/><p>While he teased this, inside, he did not believe his own words. Xiao Mo Ge was a genius. Even Feng Xin Zi who was called a genius by others had to admit the other\u2019s astounding talent. But even the most talented person could not be good in all areas. Mo weapon creation was a profound and cryptic field. In order to have accomplishments in this area, one needed to accumulate skill and experience. The former was related to talent, and the latter to time.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlso, don\u2019t you feel it is strange? A mo weapon master that can make an earth mo weapon should have at least some fame and reputation before this, but no one has heard of his name before?\u201d Feng Xin Zi looked at Zuo Mo in the distance and said to himself.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are many people who leap into fame from obscurity. There is nothing strange about that.\u201d Ji Li Yu\u2019s tone was dismissive.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d Feng Xin Zi did not continue on the topic.</p><br/><p>One person forced their way over and said enthusiastically, \u201cHa, I am so fortunate to encounter such a beautiful miss today! Miss who is so beautiful that my heart has almost stopped beating, can you tell me your name?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ji Li Yu felt slight disdain but she did not snow it in her expression. She smiled brightly. \u201cShouldn\u2019t you introduce yourself first before asking for someone\u2019s name?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ji Li Yu was devastatingly beautiful to start with. When she did not smile, she was the brightest jewel at the banquet. When she smiled, the entire banquet hall seemed to light up. The nearby guests were dumbstruck.</p><br/><p>The young person who stepped forward to speak with her was also stunned. After a while, he recovered. His expression was intoxicated. He appeared as though he would be willing to die if Ji Li Yu told him to do so.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh oh oh! I should die for this! I was so impolite. Heavens, this is unforgivable! Please forgive my rudeness, I am Hua Ru Hai from the South Bay\u2019s Hua Family. It is a little place, a little place.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hua Ru Hai smiled fawningly. Shocked inhales sounded in the surroundings. South Bay Hua Family was a faction that rivaled the Tang Family.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am very happy to meet you, Mister Hua Ru Hai! I am Ji Li Yu of the yao!\u201d Ji Li Yu\u2019s smile blossomed and drew the eyes of the males present.</p><br/><p>\u201cHappy, happy, truly happy!\u201d Hua Ru Hai was so excited he could not speak rationally.</p><br/><p>\u201cHas Mister Hua Ru Hai also come for Grandmaster?\u201d Ji Li Yu asked curiously.</p><br/><p>Hua Ru Hai nodded repeatedly. \u201cYes, yes, I was coincidentally around the mo weapon pool when Grandmaster completed forging the mo weapon. I saw with my own eyes the worldly apparition when the Sky Snake Ten Manifestation Pike was created.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSky Snake Ten Manifestation Pike?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, it is an outstanding earth mo weapon, and can change into ten different mo weapons. It is the first time I have seen such a wondrous earth mo weapon. It is a pity it ended up in the hands of Rare Artifacts Hall. It will not be easy to buy it from them.\u201d Hua Ru Hai shook his head and said with regret.</p><br/><p>Ji Li Yu suddenly said, \u201cGrandmaster is really young. Are all mo weapon masters so young?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hua Ru Hai smiled and said, \u201cActually, I was stunned when I met the Grandmaster for the first time. I hadn\u2019t expected him to be about the same age as me. However, people at the grandmaster level are probably not the same as us mere mortals.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat is true.\u201d Ji Li Yu smiled faintly. Her gaze turned to the mo weapon placed at the center of the large hall. \u201cThat is the Sky Snake Ten Manifestations Pike?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEn!\u201d Hua Ru Hai looked with intoxication at the Sky Snake Ten Manifestations Pike and murmured, \u201cPerfect! It is absolutely perfect! I haven never heard of this level of craftsmanship. It is great!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ji Li Yu stared at the Sky Snake Ten Manifestations Pike. An intimidating yet almost imperceptible presence emanated from the pike and shrouded the entire hall. It would occasionally cause sighs of awe.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>\u201cIt really is a perfect masterpiece,\u201d the chief steward of Rare Artifacts Hall praised.</p><br/><p>\u201cMany thanks to you for your support!\u201d Zuo Mo offered his thanks to the other. He had sold the Sky Snake Ten Manifestations Pike to the Rare Artifacts hall already. They had only brought it out for display because it was Zuo Mo\u2019s request.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is nothing,\u201d the middle-aged mo smiled and said. Then he said subtly, \u201cNo matter the occasion, Rare Artifacts Hall is a friend of Grandmaster.\u201d</p><br/><p>He had felt great shock when he had received Zuo Mo\u2019s request but he quickly made his decision. While he did not know what the Grandmaster\u2019s intentions were, it was undoubtedly the best choice to build a good relationship with the other.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo raised the winecup in his hand and toasted the other. \u201cPlease!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease!\u201d The middle-aged mo responded with a raise of his glass in satisfaction. It was not common to have a grandmaster owe you a favor.</p><br/><p>There was an imperceptible smile on Tang Chen\u2019s face. Suddenly, a servant said a few words in a low voice by his ear and he nodded.</p><br/><p>He suddenly stood and raised both of his hands. He said in a loud voice, \u201cEveryone!\u201d</p><br/><p>The hall immediately quieted down. All gazes turned to focus on Tang Chen. Tang Chen had absolute authority in Bu Zhou City. Just a few of his words could have great effects on Bu Zhou City.</p><br/><p>Tang Chen had a big smile. \u201cToday is really a good day, with friends filling the seats, and honored guests that have come.\u201d</p><br/><p>Just as he was speaking, a procession walked in from the door to the hall. The one leading the way was a youth with a faint smile on his face. His handsome face was filled with confidence as he walked with his head high at the front.</p><br/><p>The crowd unconsciously made way for him.</p><br/><p>\u201cUncle Tang!\u201d The youth bowed towards Tang Chen.</p><br/><p>Tang Chen laughed and said, \u201cCome here, come here, let Uncle have a look at you. Heroes really come from youth! I really admire A Di for having such a son!\u201d</p><br/><p>A Di? Low discussion rose in the crowd. Everyone was speculating who this A Di was.</p><br/><p>\u201cFather frequently mentions you, but there has been many matters. He feels very guilty for being unable to visit Uncle Tang these years,\u201d Gongzi Xi said respectfully. [2]</p><br/><p>\u201cOh!\u201d A reminiscing expression came onto Tang Chen\u2019s face. He said emotionally, \u201cThe years have passed so quickly!\u201d</p><br/><p>He then laughed. \u201cIt is not good to be too emotional on such a good day.\u201d Finishing, he turned to face the hall with a hand on the youth. He said in a loud voice, \u201cEveryone, let me introduce you. This is Marshal Di\u2019s son, and my nephew, Xi!\u201d</p><br/><p>The crowd exploded.</p><br/><p>Everyone knew who Marshal Di was. Oh, of course this meant every other than Zuo Mo. Marshal Di was much more famous than Tang Chen and was one of the most famous marshals in the mo territories.</p><br/><p>Many people had uncertain expressions. While Tang Chen\u2019s authority in Bu Zhou City was unrivalled, the Tang Family was usually low-key and seemed content to be in their area without any ambitions to vie for the world.</p><br/><p>Due to this, many people thought of the Tang Family as just a strong local faction. However, Marshal Di was one of the competitors fighting for domination of the world and one of the strongest marshals.</p><br/><p>Because of the difference in status of the families, many people were surprised the son of Marshal Di was so respectful towards Tang Chen. To even bow like a junior suggested that the two marshals had a close relationship.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>Xi\u2019s arrival caused the entire banquet to have a turbulent underflow. Many people thought inside that they needed to reassess the strength of the Tang Family.</p><br/><p>This included the Ji Family.</p><br/><p>In the corner, A Heng\u2019s eyes flashed and he was uncertain. The Tang Family had been a faction that the Ji Family had been trying form relations with for a long time. The Ji Family had even hoped that they could use a marriage to ally the two families together.</p><br/><p>He immediately detected something unusual nearby when Marshal Di\u2019s son Xi had arrived.</p><br/><p>The young master of the Ji Family looked with hate and viciousness at Zuo Mo.</p><br/><p>Refocusing, A Heng noticed the expression of his young master and frowned inwardly. The newly arrived Gongzi Xi appeared handsome and accomplished, his family\u2019s young master in comparison was not acceptable to be seen in public. A Heng shook his head inside.</p><br/><p>That Xiao Yun Hai was an honored guest of the Tang Family now. They did not have any more chances to act. Not speaking of how they wanted to form an alliance with the Tang Family, even if they did not care about how the Tang Family felt, they could not act against a valued guest of the Tang Family while in Bu Zhou City.</p><br/><p>He reminded, \u201cYoung Master, you cannot be rash!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo this will be the end of it?\u201d the young master gritted his teeth and his voice seemed to bellow out from his chest.</p><br/><p>A Heng said coolly. \u201cMaster will not be happy if you offend the Tang Family.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Ji Family young master\u2019s face paled. When he thought of his father\u2019s anger, a chill rose from the bottom of his feet. All of his anger immediately disappeared.</p><br/><p>After A Heng reminded him of this, he didn\u2019t look at his young master again but focused on Gongzi Xi. He decided to stay a while longer and find out why Gongzi Xi had suddenly come to Bu Zhou City.</p><br/><p>The Tang Family was low-key but their strength could not be underestimated. They would be of great aid to any family they allied with.</p><br/><p>A Heng knew that the Horizontal Jie\u2019s Ji Family did not have as much influence compared to Marshal Di. However, he hadn\u2019t expected that Tang Chen had concealed this relationship so deeply. They had investigated for so long and hadn\u2019t even heard a hint of it.</p><br/><p>The Ji Family had started to try to ally with the Tang Family from a very long time ago. Tang Chen\u2019s attitude had always been ambiguous. So this was the reason behind it.</p><br/><p>No matter what, he could not let the Tang Family and Marshal Di form an alliance.</p><br/><p>A cold light flashed across A Heng\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>With the arrival of the new guests, no one noticed the two people from the Ji Family in the corner.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>Tang Chen\u2019s gaze flashed across Gongzi Xi\u2019s retinue. When his gaze landed on Li Xian\u2019er, he was slightly surprised. However, he did not change expression and brought Gongzi Xi in front of Zuo Mo.</p><br/><p>\u201cVirtuous nephew, come, this is Grandmaster Xiao Yun Hai! Grandmaster has just forged an earth mo weapon, the Sky Snake Ten Manifestations Pike, it is extraordinarily powerful!\u201d</p><br/><p>At this time, the corner of Zuo Mo\u2019s eye imperceptibly twitched.</p><br/><p>[1] This is another pun based on similar sounds and different charcters. Yun Hai as in Cloud Sea, and Xiao being the surname.</p><br/><p>[2] The naming convention here seems to follow that of Ancient China. \u201cGongzi\u201d means the \u201cson of a lord\u201d which later turned to mean \u201cgentleman.\u201d So Xi is the name, and Gongzi is like a honorific.</p><br/><p>Translator Ramblings: You all thought Zuo Mo\u2019s naming sense improved?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

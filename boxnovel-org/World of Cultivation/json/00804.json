He said, \u201cBefore we left, Zhong Daren said that Xi Xuan is weak now. Kun Lun and Tian Huan are greedily watching from the sides. The nine great dhyana sects look numerous, but they are divided and their power is scattered, only appearing strong but will scatter when they face pressure. Only Mo Cloud Sea is a viable ally, while they do not have many soldiers they have strong commanders. They do not have a great amount of land, but they are wealthy, their potential can be anticipated and are a possible ally.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cZhong Daren is too complimentary,\u201d Zuo Mo politely responded.</p><br/><p>Jian Jun smiled slightly. \u201cMy Xi Xuan has been weak for a long time, our elite have left us. If there is no help from outside forces, then we will not be able to fight off Kun Lun and Tian Huan. Mo Cloud Sea is in a remote location. With the nine great dhyana sects as barrier, there are no worries in the short term. Yet once Kun Lun and Tian Huan swallow Xi Xuan, each will possess almost two realms of power and be unstoppable. Daren predicted that if it gets to that point, with the two sects sending soldiers, the nine great dhyana sects will collapse with little resistance. At that time, Mo Cloud Sea will have no place to retreat. The nine great dhyana sects can surrender, but Mo Cloud Sea cannot.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo changed expression. He had to admit that Zhong De\u2019s prediction was accurate. The nine great dhyana sects were a group of rabble if they could not unify under one banner. If Kun Lun and Tian Huan had just average abilities, they might try to fight back. If the two big sects really ate Xi Xuan, just their presence would be enough for the nine great dhyana sects to surrender without even fighting.</p><br/><p>The hate between Mo Cloud Sea and Kun Lun had been spread far and wide a long time ago. Everyone knew of the great hate between Mo Cloud Sea and Kun Lun.</p><br/><p>The crux to stopping Kun Lun and Tian Huan was not the nine great dhyana sects but Xi Xuan!</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo had thought of this before, but that that time, there was no hope to be seen in Xi Xuan. The sudden appearance of Zhong De had given new blood to the rotting Xi Xuan.</p><br/><p>Jian Jun continued to speak, \u201cI heard some things about Mister Zuo\u2019s birth. Daren feels great sympathy and has executed everyone involved in that incident. Also, Daren has given me the duty of returning this item to Mister Zuo. This item that belongs to the Zuo Family is today returned to Mister Zuo, to its owner!\u201d</p><br/><p>As he spoke, he took out a strangely shaped item.</p><br/><p>This item was extremely unique in shape. It was about the height of a person, and was like a tree branch cut off from a tree. The main trunk was curved and there were five forks that criss-crossed. The item was made completely from metal. Even after a few decades, it was still shiny like it was new.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is the part that we obtained in the past. The other three are in the hands of Kun Lun, Tian Huan, and Xuan Kong Temple. While returning this cannot undo the past, we have already taken care off the elders involved in the matter. However, we do not hope to receive your forgiveness with this, we only wish to sincerely express our apologies, and to show that Xi Xuan is willing to take responsibility for this matter.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jian Jun\u2019s expression was stern and his tone solemn.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo looked at this shen device part and was in a daze. Xi Xuan had not faked this item. When Jian Jun had taken this out, Zuo Mo had felt the presence of a shen device.</p><br/><p>In his few memories, this strangely shaped thing had appeared a few times.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank Zhong De Daren for me!\u201d Zuo Mo refocused, his expression normal. The scenes that had flashed through his mind caused his emotions to shift but he quickly calmed his mind. As the leader of the entire Mo Cloud Sea, every decision could influence the future development of Mo Cloud Sea.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are no problems about the alliance and ordering shen equipment. But both understanding your shen power and designing shen equipment will take time,\u201d Zuo Mo said.</p><br/><p>A hint of joy flashed across Jian Jun\u2019s eyes. He unhesitatingly took out a jade scroll. \u201cThis is the shen power of our sect, I will give this to you now!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo speedily read through it. After thinking for a moment, he had a general grasp of their method. \u201cThe work to design the shen equipment will take about two months. The price will only be known after the first ones are made.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jian Jun then asked, \u201cIs it possible to finish thirty thousand shen equipment before the eighth month of next year?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo said after a moment of thought. \u201cIt is difficult to produce thirty thousand in one year, but there should be no problems for twenty thousand!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jian Jun said unhesitatingly, \u201cGood! At least twenty thousand, no matter how many you will produce, we will take all of them!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo problem!\u201d Zuo Mo said crisply.</p><br/><p>This was a very profitable transaction. If they had twenty thousand shen equipment, Xi Xuan\u2019s power would increase greatly. Zuo Mo was happy to see this. Also, such a large order would cause Mo Cloud Sea\u2019s forging skills to go up another level.</p><br/><p>This was killing multiple birds with one stone.</p><br/><p>Jian Jun suddenly spoke, \u201cThere is one matter we will request of Mister Zuo.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease speak.\u201d Zuo Mo had to admit that while Jian Jun was not strong, but his style and his way of speech made people feel pleased.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh.\u201d Jian Jun sighed lightly. \u201cWe want to ask Mister Zuo to pass on a message.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA message?\u201d Zuo Mo stilled and then understood. Gu Liang Dao!</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Mister Zuo, please give this letter to Gu Liang Dao. This letter was personally written by Zhong De Daren.\u201d Jian Jun passed over a jade scroll, but his expression was slightly awkward.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo seriously received the jade scroll. He said with a nod, \u201cI will definitely give this to Brother Gu.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you, Mister Zuo.\u201d Jian Jun\u2019s smile was slightly forced. A talent of the sect had betrayed and left the sect due to being forced by the sect, this was not something to be proud of.</p><br/><p>\u201cMister Jian is too polite,\u201d Zuo Mo said.</p><br/><p>The two then discussed the problem of setting up transportation formations.</p><br/><p>After setting up transportation formations, they would be able to travel freely. While it was expensive to move large volumes, it was the safest method at present.</p><br/><p>Both of them knew this.</p><br/><p>Once they opened the transportation formations, the wards of Mo Cloud Sea would flood into Xi Xuan. This would affect Xi Xuan greatly but the present Xi Xuan had no power to manage this. What was in front of them was an even more dangerous and cruel future. Organizing their combat forces was their most urgent need at this moment.</p><br/><p>Before leaving Jian Jun said with a serious expression, \u201cMister Zuo, you need to pay attention to Kun Lun and Tian Huan. While Mo Cloud Sea is the best at forging, Kun Lun and Tian Huan are not lacking. Recently, Kun Lun and Tian Huan having been seeking ancient ruins and Kun Lun found the remnants of an ancient shen device. They have started to plan forging a new shen device.\u201d</p><br/><p>This information immediately attracted Zuo Mo\u2019s attention. \u201cIs there anything more specific?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Jian Jun shook his head. \u201cWe only know that for this device piece, three of Kun Lun\u2019s elders lost their lives and the sect leader was heavily wounded.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo was startled. This price was great even for Kun Lun.</p><br/><p>\u201cShen devices have developed quickly. Maybe in a year or two, everyone will have distanced themselves again,\u201d Jian Jun said concernedly. \u201cTaking from the past is better than closing the doors and creating from within. You will need to pay more attention. If we have information of ancient ruins, we will notify you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018\u2019Alright!\u201d Zuo Mo nodded. Jian Jun\u2019s words made him have nothing to say.</p><br/><p>The beginning of a new era was usually when development occurred the fastest. Slacking off for a time meant that some people might be forever pulled down. Unlike the completeness and maturity of the ling power system, shen power had just been reborn. While the general picture could be seen, the details were still crude.</p><br/><p>Kun Lun was willing to spend such an astounding price. This meant that what they obtained surpassed this price.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo felt strong danger.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>Gu Liang Dao was silent after reading the letter.</p><br/><p>\u201cBig Brother, did that old man Zhong De say something ugly?\u201d Shuang Yu couldn\u2019t resist asking.</p><br/><p>Gu Liang Dao shook his head and handed the jade scroll to Shuang Yu. \u201cRead.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shuang Yu took the jade scroll. His expression was spectacular after he finished reading and then he handed the jade scroll to Xiao.</p><br/><p>Gu Liang Dao laughed self-mocking. \u201cHe\u2019s inviting us back, he will give up his position, and will clean out all opposing factions.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs \u2026 \u2026 is this fake?\u201d Shuang Yu hesitated to say. No matter what, the contents of the letter were not something he could believe.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true.\u201d Gu Liang Dao\u2019s gaze was slightly dazed. The internal conflict and pain appeared in his eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen should we return?\u201d Shuang Yu asked excitedly. He believed that if Big Brother returned to Xi Xuan to take power, Xi Xuan will definitely come back from the dead!</p><br/><p>\u201cA Xiao, what do you think?\u201d Gu Liang Dao suddenly asked.</p><br/><p>Xiao was silent for a moment and then said, \u201cIt is hard to say. Zhong De says he only has three years left, it probably is not a lie. It is also not a lie that he will abdicate the power because only we can save Xi Xuan. So up until now, he killed so many people but didn\u2019t touch any of those close to us.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gu Liang Dao continued to be silent.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut after?\u201d Xiao said calmly, \u201cOnce Zhong De is dead, Big Brother has the power, and then? The sect leader can tolerate Zhong De, but can he tolerate Big Brother?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shuang Yu\u2019s expression froze. He became silent.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe sect leader is skilled in enduring. The elders have held power and controlled Xi Xuan for so many years yet the sect leader did not make a sound. Looking back now, the sect leader may have let them. The sect leader might have moved in the shadows for Big Brother to be forced out of the sect.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo way?\u201d Shuang Yu\u2019s eyes were wide, his expression disbelieving.</p><br/><p>Xiao smiled coldly, \u201cThe sect leader was young when he took the position, and could not stand up to the elders. He was forced by the situation. Think of what the sect leader has done all these years, free and taking pleasure, not asking about the matters of the sect. Look at what the sect leader did this time. While he is not a murderous person, he is a cunning one. Zhong De was gone for more than fifty years, yet he was able to uproot the elders and their support in the span of one night. This cannot be accomplished by just killing people.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou mean to say \u2026 \u2026\u201d Shuang Yu was not stupid and understood.</p><br/><p>\u201cWithout someone familiar with the situation, he definitely could not have done it. The sect leader had probably started to investigate the elders from a long time ago. Supposedly, half of the sect leader\u2019s guards were killed. It is terrifying that he managed to endure for so long!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao\u2019s voice was cold and emotionless. \u201cIt would be fine if this letter came from the sect leader, but it came from Zhong De! Zhong De has great power, and the sect leader will go along with him. What about after Zhong De is dead, what do we have that will let us fight against the sect leader?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo what, we aren\u2019t afraid of him,\u201d Shuang Yu muttered.</p><br/><p>Xiao smiled. \u201cWhy should we? Right now, our situation is not bad. Our land is not large but our foundation is not bad, why should we go back to endure?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao is right!\u201d The shadows in Gu Liang Dao\u2019s eyes were swept away. \u201cWe only knew freedom after coming out. I am not willing to turn back! How can we believe him? But our relatives are in Zhong De\u2019s hands, how can we get them back?\u201d</p><br/><p>When they had fled, the relatives of most of his subordinates had been arrested. Getting these relatives back was a great problem that was related to their foundation.</p><br/><p>Xiao smiled confidently. \u201cThis matter is not difficult. Zhong De has not killed them so he will not make things difficult for us by using them as hostages. However, we need to ask Brother Zuo for help on this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Zuo?\u201d Gu Liang Dao\u2019s eyes lit up and then his praise left his mouth. \u201cYes!\u201d</p><br/><p>Translator Ramblings: More about Zuo Mo\u2019s past and more politics.</p><br/><p>Now that we are starting on the home stretch, I\u2019m losing motivation to translate. I wonder how weird I\u2019ll feel when I don\u2019t have to post everyday.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

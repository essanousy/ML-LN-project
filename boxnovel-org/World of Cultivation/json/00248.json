Never having participated in building a city before, Zuo Mo was extremely interested. Also, the newly built city was of extremely important in his plan.</p><br/><p>To the three people, a strong village that could defend against a jindan was something they had never done before. They were extremely interested. As to the feasibility of the plans due to the high difficulty? That was Boss\u2019 problem. They were only in charge of designing it.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is the use of this beacon tower?\u201d Zuo Mo pointed at the plans and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is primarily to give warning to allies. Other than that, it can contain twenty xiuzhe. Its ling shield can protect xiuzhe. Xiuzhe standing on the top do not have to worry about the attacks of the enemy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut don\u2019t you think it is too small?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt can hold twenty people, it is not small.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSmall, it\u2019s too small. At the very least, it needs to be able to hold fifty xiuzhe. That way, it has offensive power. Also, we don\u2019t need that fire altar. We only have one city, we don\u2019t need to give anyone warnings.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWithout the fire altar, is it still a beacon tower?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe can give it another name. What about Sword Pavilion, how do you guys feel about it?\u201d Zuo Mo asked with interest.</p><br/><p>The three were wordless.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo clearly had not finished speaking his thoughts. \u201cYour plans are pretty good, but it is too conservative. Pure defense cannot stop the attacks of the enemy. Jindan recover ling power faster than us. If he can\u2019t defeat us the first day, he\u2019ll come back the second day. If he continues to attack for a dozen days or a month, do you feel we can stop him?\u201d</p><br/><p>The three were speechless again.</p><br/><p>One person argued, \u201cIf a jindan attacks a city, there\u2019s no city in Little Mountain Jie that can stop him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere wasn\u2019t one before, but there will be one soon.\u201d Zuo Mo looked at the other, and then added, \u201cIf there isn\u2019t one when it\u2019s time, we will all die.\u201d</p><br/><p>The three instantly started to sweat, feeling hopelessness. Heavens, who had Boss offended? Wait! Jindan! A person flashed across their minds, Clear Sky Old Forefather! There was only one jindan xiuzhe in Little Mountain Jie.</p><br/><p>\u201cClear Sky Old Forefather?\u201d a person asked in a trembling voice.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo smiled and said, \u201cYour guess is so accurate.\u201d</p><br/><p>The three\u2019s faces turned ashy. Zuo Mo\u2019s smile was so evil in their eyes, more evil than a demon. They were extremely regretful. Before, their lives were poor, but at least they wouldn\u2019t be at risk for losing their little lifes.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, everyone,\u201d Zuo Mo clapped his hands, \u201ccheer up. I know you are the same as me, you don\u2019t want to die. So cheer up. Use your strongest imagination and give the most plausible plan.\u201d</p><br/><p>One person looked soulless, but he managed to keep his composure. \u201cBoss, you can\u2019t defend against a jindan.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what do we do?\u201d Zuo Mo spread his hands and asked.</p><br/><p>This person bit out, \u201cIf we can\u2019t defend, maybe we can try to kill him!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re crazy!\u201d The other two people yelled.</p><br/><p>\u201cContinue.\u201d Zuo Mo was shocked inside, and gave a surprised expression.</p><br/><p>This person\u2019s face was white, but this eyes flashed with an insane light. \u201cJindan might be strong, but they do have weaknesses. They are too proud, they believe too much in their own strength. They would not care about things that look very dangerous to us. We can make a trap using the city as bait. He may fall for it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not possible. He will see through our disguise.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou cannot kill a jindan!\u201d</p><br/><p>The other two muttered as though they were dreaming.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo scanned this person and asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYuan Jiang, Boss,\u201d the person answered respectfully.</p><br/><p>\u201cFrom today on, you are the leader of the three of you,\u201d Zuo Mo then said to the other two, \u201cyou two will be his assistants. If someone doesn\u2019t listen, hmph hmph. You won\u2019t live if you rebel against a jindan, but if you rebel against me, you won\u2019t have a life now.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two people\u2019s faces instantly whitened again, and fell silent.</p><br/><p>\u201cMake a new plan,\u201d Zuo Mo said to Yuan Jiang.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Boss!\u201d Yuan Jiang said respectfully. He knew that if he was able to grasp this chance, his future prospects were limitless.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>Gongsun Cha listened to the people report. Xie Shan stood at the side with an ashamed expression. He knew that he had gone overboard this time. He had exposed himself too early in front of the public. It was not a good thing for them.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, so it\u2019s like that.\u201d Gongsun Cha raised his head, and gave a shy smile. He said warmly, \u201cNo problem.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Shan\u2019s heart loosened slightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Shan\u2019s heart suddenly rose again.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince you guys caused this problem, then you need to wipe your own butts.\u201d Gongsun Cha then seemed to say to himself, \u201cOh, this is a pretty good chance, can\u2019t waste it.\u201d</p><br/><p>No one understood what Lil\u2019 Miss meant in his words to himself.</p><br/><p>\u201cRight now, Clear Sky Sect is definitely searching for you. Even though you have covered your tracks very well, but they probably will not have to try so hard to find this place. Your present mission is to stop and disrupt their pursuit.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone instantly had an excited expression. Wasn\u2019t this another chance to fight?</p><br/><p>The corner of Gongsun Cha\u2019s mouth rose in an imperceptible curve. \u201cAll of you will led a platoon in this disruption mission.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh! We also need to take those new people?\u201d</p><br/><p>The people who had just been so excited instantly withered. They finally reacted. What disruption mission? It was a babysitting mission. Thinking about taking along a large group of newbies that didn\u2019t know a thing, everyone, including Zong Ru, had a grimace on their face.</p><br/><p>They were very willing to kill. But not one of them was willing to be a babysitter.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat, you aren\u2019t willing?\u201d Gongsun Cha smiled, showing his teeth.</p><br/><p>Everyone\u2019s hearts suddenly froze. They simultaneously shook their heads.</p><br/><p>\u2018Willing, how can we not be willing?! Leading a group of people, it will be very imposing, ha ha!\u201d Lei Peng\u2019s laughter was like sobbing.</p><br/><p>\u201cVery willing, very willing!\u201d Nian Lu hurried to agree, afraid if he wasn\u2019t careful, Lil\u2019 Miss would fix onto him. Then it really would be getting a strip torn off his hide.</p><br/><p>Ma Fan saw Lil\u2019 Miss\u2019 eyes float towards him and hurriedly jumped out. \u201cThis subordinate is willing to be the first to fight.\u201d</p><br/><p>The other people instantly were upset. How come they hadn\u2019t been the first to declare themselves? Ma Fan\u2019s mind was getting better and better. He hadn\u2019t been the core for nothing!</p><br/><p>Instantly, everyone asked to fight.</p><br/><p>Gongsun Cha gave a shy and bashful smile, and said softly, \u201cYou have to be careful.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing this, it was as though everyone had been pardoned, and they scattered, rushing to go pick people.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo suddenly felt he was much busier. All the xiuzhe that had been brought over had at least one skill. He had to personally make arrangements for many people. However, before this, the first person he had to meet was the one who had planned all this, Bao Yi.</p><br/><p>\u201cBoss!\u201d Bao Yi respectfully bowed.</p><br/><p>When he first saw Zuo Mo, he was extremely shocked. From any angle, this boss looked like a youth that did not seem to have even entered his twenties. The more amazed he was, the less he dared to slight Boss. To be able to gather together such a large group of people at such an age, his abilities were definitely not something that a little businessman like him could underestimate.</p><br/><p>After he took a tour around the camp, the amazement in his heart increased. Maybe this camp was extremely crude in other people\u2019s eyes, but in the eyes of someone as experienced as Bao Yi, there were too many places here that were not normal.</p><br/><p>That date seed ship was a rare jingshi talisman. The female xiu beside Boss and the three metal guards enveloped in golden armor were unable to be quantified.</p><br/><p>The first mission he received was to organize the stores.</p><br/><p>He was very attentive to this mission. The stores could, to a certain degree, reflect the wealth of Boss.</p><br/><p>The storeroom was a mountain cave. It was heavily guarded with two whole platoons of xiuzhe. When he entered the deep cavern, and saw the mountainous pile of talismans, he was dumbstruck. In an instant, he felt all the blood in his body suddenly flood into his head.</p><br/><p>Heavens! It was the first time he had seen talismans piled up in heaps like they were trash.</p><br/><p>No one to care and repair them, Bao Yi\u2019s first thought was, wastrel, they were wastrels!</p><br/><p>After that, he started to organize through day and night. He organized and sorted the talismans according to type and grade. When Zuo Mo entered the store and saw the reborn storeroom, he was very satisfied.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou must have worked very hard,\u201d Zuo Mo said.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is this subordinate\u2019s duty,\u201d Bao Yi hurriedly said.</p><br/><p>This guy really had abilities, Zuo Mo thought inside. Even though he was full of interest towards business, but it was clear that he definitely would not have the time in the future.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are going to be in charge of the store and be the quartermaster for the troop.\u201d Zuo Mo reassured him. As the number of people increased, Zuo Mo felt it was increasingly difficult to manage them all. The training and combat of the xiuzhe in the camp belonged to Gongsun Shidi, but there was a lot of work in supplying resources. It had been a headache for him and Gongsun Shidi . As to Chun Shidi, that maniac could not be relied on.</p><br/><p>Bao Yi was overjoyed. \u201cThank you Boss!\u201d</p><br/><p>Quartermaster and in charge of the stores, that was a rich job. What he thought more of was the importance of this job. After this, he did not need to worry about his status in this group.</p><br/><p>\u201cWork hard.\u201d Zuo Mo encouraged and quickly left the storeroom.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>Bao Yi\u2019s job was very easy to arrange because no one other than him could do the job. However, Zuo Mo felt it was very difficult to arrange the other people.</p><br/><p>They were skilled in a variety of areas, some of which were very obscure. Zuo Mo still had no idea what to do with them.</p><br/><p>The only person he could ask for help was Pu Yao.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis problem.\u201d Pu Yao thought, and then said, \u201cMaybe you can borrow some methods from our Yao Art Houses.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat methods?\u201d Zuo Mo\u2019s mind became alert.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn the bigger yao art houses, they would take out a portion of resources and monies each year to support those yao with unique ideas to study new yao arts.\u201d Pu Yao said, \u201cOf course, you cannot avoid the necessary examinations and assessments.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo\u2019s eyes lit up. That was a good idea.</p><br/><p>If he didn\u2019t know how to organize these people, it was better to let them work it out, and he could save effort. As to resources, it would be within the limits of their abilities.</p><br/><p>What Zuo Mo needed the most at the moment was the least effort-consuming method. If it continued like this, he felt that definitely would have no time to cultivate.</p><br/><p>These days, it wasn\u2019t easy being the boss!</p><br/><p>Translator Ramblings: The crazier the person, the more they get promoted in Zuo Mo\u2019s camp, and the higher the status. The best example is, of course, Gongsun Cha. Gongsun Cha making an army is a long term process he is going through that is showing preliminary results. Chun Yu Cheng is also doing the same thing. He\u2019s had preliminary results, and now he just needs more time. If he was useless, Fang Xiang wouldn\u2019t have wrote him in and kept mentioning him in all these chapters.</p><br/><p>Some of you have really good theories for what is going on with the mystery female.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

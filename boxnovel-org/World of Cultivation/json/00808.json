Those that could be called not bad by Wei Sheng Shixiong were definitely not weak.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is Heart Leaf Dhyana Sect,\u201d a guard carefully reported. Daren rarely had a dark expression like this.</p><br/><p>\u201cHeart Leaf Dhyana Sect?\u201d Zuo Mo\u2019s eyes flashed with a cold light.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes! These people are not wearing shen equipment but they cultivate heart leaf shen power. Daren, take a look.\u201d Finishing, the subordinate forced open the hand of a corpse. There was the mark of a tree branch with a leaf on the palm.</p><br/><p>\u201cDaren, this is the mark of heart leaf shen power. They have reached the level of one branch one leaf.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOne branch one leaf?\u201d Zuo Mo asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen heart leaf shen power reaches a new level, their mark will grow and add another leaf,\u201d the person said respectfully.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou know a lot.\u201d Zuo Mo asked in surprise, \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis subordinate is Jin De Wei,\u201d the guard was slightly embarrassed. \u201cThis one\u2019s duty is to inspect the merchant caravans that travel through here, and I have heard some things in the process.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, then speak, what other information is there on Heart Leaf Dhyana Sect?\u201d Zuo Mo stood and asked interestedly.</p><br/><p>Jin De Wei had a hesitant expression.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo smiled and said, \u201cIt\u2019s just chatter, and I\u2019m just listening.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jin De Wei finally spoke, \u201cThis subordinate coincidentally heard the manager of a merchant caravan mention that Heart Leaf Dhyana Sect secretly consorts with Tian Huan. This subordinate felt they were slightly suspicious and paid attention to them secretly. I heard this from their members.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy did you find them suspicious?\u201d Zuo Mo seemed to be more interested in Jin De Wei.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis subordinate found that they were going around and asking questions, especially about shen equipment and shen power. They also asked about the general location of Golden Crow Island. The range of items they brought was wide, they bought a few of everything but not many of any particular item, they did not seem like business people,\u201d Jin De Wei explained.</p><br/><p>The admiration in Zuo Mo\u2019s eyes grew. This person did not have an attention-catching appearance, but he was perceptive and he was a careful person. This was a talent.</p><br/><p>He then asked, \u201cWhat do you think of this matter?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jin De Wei knew that Daren was testing him and immediately focused. After a moment of thought, he said gravely, \u201cThey are very familiar with the jinzhi and probably have come before to study them. There were not many people in this attack, just twenty, they did not have any reinforcements. It seems more like a probing mission.\u201d</p><br/><p>After he said this, Jin De Wei\u2019s expression turned ashen. He was frightened by his own conclusion.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo\u2019s expression turned dark.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are about ninety eight transportation formations to the outside world, in twenty or so jie, these outer border jie have been labeled.\u201d There was a jie map in front of Gongsun Cha. Almost all of out the outermost jie were labeled in red.</p><br/><p>Because Mo Cloud Sea\u2019s connection to the outside was almost completely reliant on the transportation formations. Ninety eight transportation formations, twenty two of the outermost jie, on average, each jie had more than four transportation formations connected to the outside.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf these ninety eight transportation formations that go to different jie, forty two of them are to xiuzhe jie that are not connected to Tian Huan and Kun Lun. These forty two jie are mostly from the Nine Great Dhyana Sects and some smaller powers. These factions are easy to infiltrate and the transportation formations have become a fatal weakness for us right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gongsun Cha raised his head to look around. \u201cThe most secure method right now is to relocate the transportation formations. The best option is to gather the transportation formations, and designate specific business jie where we will station troops to guarantee their safety. However, there are also problems with this plan. The expenses in setting up new transportation formations will be huge, and this way, the cost of many of products will increase as well as reduce our offensive abilities.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo had a grimace. Gongsun Cha\u2019s method was possible, but just as he had said, the investment would be enormous.</p><br/><p>Transportation formations that could move large volumes for long distances were expensive. Even with Zuo Mo\u2019s wealth, he had only accumulated these ninety eight transportation formations after seven years of development. If he had to rebuild so many transportation formations, the amount of money he had to spend was a great sum.</p><br/><p>This was a relatively safe plan but it was too expensive.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe price is too great!\u201d Zuo Mo shook his head. \u201cWe do not have the capital.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone nodded. This plan cost too much. In their view, even if they took over all these jie, they didn\u2019t need to spend so many jingshi.</p><br/><p>Gongsun Cha also knew that this plan was not realistic and continued, \u201cWe do not need to guess what will happen next. Kun Lun and Tian Huan will use our weakness by infiltrating the other powers and harass our transportation formations, even destroying them to destroy our connections to the outside world.\u201d</p><br/><p>Inhales sounded in the conference room. Those with the slightest bit of knowledge understood how great a blow it would be to Mo Cloud Sea if the situation came to that step!</p><br/><p>\u201cThe problem is that even though we know what they will do next, we do not have many solutions.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lil\u2019 Miss\u2019 expression was black. He had originally thought that they built Mo Cloud Sea to be impenetrable and hadn\u2019t expected that they had left such a fatal weakness.</p><br/><p>At this time, a paper crane suddenly appeared in Zuo Mo\u2019s hand. After Zuo Mo unfolded it and read through, he said coolly, \u201cThree transportation formations were attacked at once, and one was destroyed.\u201d</p><br/><p>The conference room was deathly silent. Everyone had black expressions.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo knew that Mo Cloud Sea was in a dangerous situation. At this time, he had to make a decision.</p><br/><p>\u201cOther than the crucial transportation formations, close all others,\u201d Zuo Mo said deeply. Angry flames burned in his eyes.</p><br/><p>His heart dripped blood. The closure of each transportation formation meant the loss of large amounts of jingshi.</p><br/><p>Mo Cloud Sea\u2019s economy was about to receive a great blow. For Little Mo Ge whose wealth was his life, this was like cutting his flesh.</p><br/><p>Breaking someone\u2019s path to riches was akin to killing one\u2019s parents.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo\u2019s face twisted in pain. He was completely infuriated by the enemy\u2019s actions.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf we have to suffer losses, then everyone will suffer with us. How can we be the only to lose?\u201d Zuo Mo gritted out. \u201cOur transportation formation jinzhi have problems, their transportation formation jinzhi will also have similar problems. They can infiltrate and destroy, we can do the same.\u201d</p><br/><p>When had Mo Cloud Sea ever been defeated like this? Hearing Zuo Mo\u2019s words, flames of anger rose in the eyes of the people who had been feeling frustrated.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo was unusually angry. His eyes flashed with burning light like a wolf in the darkness. \u201cThey will regret starting this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d Lil\u2019 Miss\u2019 black expression returned to normal and a smile like that of the neighbor\u2019s boy came back. \u201cThis kind of small scale infiltration is actually more advantageous for us. We have a smaller territory and is easier to defend. They are larger and there are openings everywhere. It will be difficult to prevent infiltration. Also, we do not need to limit ourselves to transportation formations. Attack any storage depots, any resource jie, if we get to their rear, we can cause pandemonium.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lil\u2019 Miss\u2019 words immediately opened a door. All kinds of inspiration rose.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, we can assassinate important people.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is more profitable to assassinate those people who are not in high positions but are very important. For example, the masters in charge of managing production. Their guards will not be strong, the danger is low, and the benefit is high.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDisrupt the peace \u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAmbush transportation boats \u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a place that you all forget, the place that teaches battle generals. If we get that, ha, that place is rich! Maybe we can end a future genius battle general, that would be profitable!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe need to plan for escape \u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe need to divide and conquer \u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The conference room that had just been deathly silent was now in heated discussion.</p><br/><p>As he listened, even Zuo Mo, the start of all this, felt a cold wave up his back. How could these people be so devious \u2026 \u2026</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>Bie Han looked at the paper crane that came from the rear and then crushed it before throwing it to the side. \u201cHave the jinzhi been built?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe construction has finished,\u201d Ma Fan responded. He was filled with puzzlement. Daren had acted the opposite of his usual strategy and built large amounts of jinzhi here as though he was building a great defense line.</p><br/><p>\u201cReport on the progress of the battalions.\u201d Bie Han\u2019s voice was icy.</p><br/><p>Ma Fan shook and then hurried to report. \u201cThe Tangzi Battalion have already taken Eastern Spring Jie, finished reorganizing, and are waiting for next orders. A Zha Ge Battalion need three more days to reach their destination. However, they have already been detected by the scouts from the Mo Marshal Alliance. The Grey Camp have arrived at the ambush spot without attracting any attention.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs there any movement from the reinforcements at Bright Mountain Jie?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are two mo marshal battalions, one of them is seven days away, the other further away, and will most likely arrive in twenty days,\u201d Ma Fan reported.</p><br/><p>Ma Fan had fought alongside Lil\u2019 Miss since a long time ago, and always admired Lil\u2019 Miss\u2019 powerful calculation. This time, when he followed Bie Han, he found to his shock that Bie Han was also precise and accurate in this field.</p><br/><p>\u201cTangzi Battalion will keep resting, A Zha Ge Battalion will follow the original plan.\u201d Bie Han\u2019s orders were clean and brisk.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d Ma Fan hurriedly answered.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are stationed here. Your mission is to stop the enemy battalion from making any sudden attacks,\u201d Bie Han said.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d Ma Fan crisply acknowledged. Then he carefully asked, \u201cDaren, you \u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI will attack the reinforcements.\u201d Bie Han treasured words like gold.</p><br/><p>Ma Fan\u2019s face turned white. \u201cBright Mountain Jie has two mo marshal battalions \u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust guard the defense line.\u201d Bie Han was expressionless.</p><br/><p>Ma Fan finally understood why Daren had built this defense line that seemed completely unnecessary. However, even with the defensive line, when Ma Fan thought of the two mo marshal battalions they were facing, he still felt a great pressure.</p><br/><p>Even though Ma Fan\u2019s battalion was one of the best in defense from Mo Cloud Sea, he had never fought against a mo marshal battalion before. Any battalion led by a mo marshal was astoundingly powerful.</p><br/><p>However, Bie Han clearly did not intend to explain more to him. He led Sin Battalion to disappear in the darkness.</p><br/><p>Editor\u2019s note: And so, the terrorist organization known as \u2026.. was born.</p><br/><p>Translator Ramblings: Zuo Mo needs to start his own spy network among the xiuzhe.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

If one looked closely, they would find that each ball of mist was composed of countless tiny faint blue ice crystals. These faint blue ice crystals floated in the air and did not fall.</p><br/><p>The blue endless mist sea was like an ocean and gave people the feeling of being immeasurable.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis this \u2026 \u2026\u201d Kang De\u2019s face was pale as he gaped. His expression seemed as though he had seen a ghost.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo\u2019s heart jumped as he hurriedly asked, \u201cWhat is it? Is something wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis \u2026 \u2026 this is ice mist!\u201d Kang De stammered out.</p><br/><p>\u201cIce Mist?\u201d Zuo Mo looked at the vast light blue mist and nodded. This name was pretty accurate. However, looking at Kang De\u2019s expression, there definitely was something that was not right. He couldn\u2019t help but ask, \u201cWhat is it? What is wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>Kang De swallowed hard, his face pale as though his face was powdered. \u201cDaren may not know, but the ice mist is only found in one place. That is the Ice Mist Haze territory at the deepest part of the Cloud Sea. How can there be ice mist here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo recognized the situation. \u201cYou are saying there should not be ice mist here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Turning his face, he looked at the vast blue mist sea and shook.</p><br/><p>Something definitely unexpected had happened!</p><br/><p>He suddenly thought of a question and his expression changed. He hurriedly asked, \u201cWhat about the road? Would the road \u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDaren, the road is gone!\u201d Kang De\u2019s expression was full of terror.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo\u2019s heart sank. \u201cThen the water cloud embryos?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis subordinate does not know.\u201d Kang De shook his head. \u201cThis subordinate has never gone into the Ice Mist Haze territory. There are rarely people that go deep into the Ice Mist Haze territory. It is too dangerous! Daren, look at this ice mist, they are extremely cold. If one does not have a treasure or enough power to protect their body, then just contact with the ice mist is enough to freeze them!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Sheng raised the black sword, and the tip sand into the ice mist.</p><br/><p>A layer of frost quickly spread on the surface of the black mist at a visible rate.</p><br/><p>Wei Sheng shook it lightly and the frost on the black sword disappeared. He raised his face and his expression was solemn. \u201cWe need to be careful!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo saw what Wei Sheng had done from beginning to end, if even Wei Sheng felt they needed to be careful then the danger the ice mist posed was clear.</p><br/><p>But \u2026 \u2026</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo looked at the quiet A Gui beside him, his heart filled with unwillingness. Water cloud embryo! Only a water cloud embryo could heal A Gui!</p><br/><p>At this moment, Zuo Mo felt extremely conflicted. No matter what, he needed to find the water cloud embryo but he did not want Wei Sheng and Zong Ru to end up in danger because of him.</p><br/><p>Wei Sheng glanced at Zuo Mo and instantly understood Zuo Mo\u2019s intentions. He smiled, \u201cJust mere ice mist, Shidi, do not be nervous. Finding the water cloud embryo is important, let\u2019s go!\u201d</p><br/><p>Turning around, he walked straight into the ice mist!</p><br/><p>Zong Ru smiled slightly. \u201cDaren, time is tight!\u201d</p><br/><p>Finishing, he walked into the ice mist.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo\u2019s heart instantly warmed and he was moved. Seeing this, he did not hesitate and took out a transportation seal. \u201cYour cultivation is too low, return first. This transportation formation will take you straight back to the island.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kang De had never gone to the Ice Mist Haze territory before and could not act as a guide any further. Kang De was also weak relative to rest of the group and the ice mist was abnormally dangerous. They did not have the attention to spare to protect him so Zuo Mo let him return.</p><br/><p>Giving the transportation seal to Kang De, Zuo Mo took A Gui and walked into the ice mist.</p><br/><p>Entering the ice mist, he felt the bone-boring coldness come from all directions. Even Zuo Mo, with his powerful body, couldn\u2019t help but shudder. Suddenly, a wave of warmth wrapped around him. The Sun Crystal Seed appeared above his head and released fine light that covered Zuo Mo, A Gui, and the Little Ones.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo jumped in fright. The Sun Crystal Seed had always been silent in his body and never moved. Sometimes, he would almost forget the existence of the Sun Crystal Seed. He hadn\u2019t thought that the coldness of the ice mist would have stimulated the Sun Crystal Seed out.</p><br/><p>Wei Sheng and Zong Ru raised their own defenses.</p><br/><p>Wei Sheng was covered in thin sword essence. This layer was extremely thin and wrapped around Wei Sheng\u2019s body like a membrane. When the ice mist came into contact with this layer of sword essence, it would disappear as though it was swallowed.</p><br/><p>Zong Ru held the Crossed Prayer Wheel and slowly turned it. Fine golden sutra characters swam in the surroundings and flicking in and out of view. The strange cold of the ice mist could not break through this seemingly thin barrier of sutra characters.</p><br/><p>When Zuo Mo caught up, the three silently took up positions of a triangular formation with Wei Sheng at the front.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe world is large and has all kinds of wonders!\u201d Wei Sheng said emotionally. \u201cThis time, my vision has been broadened by this trip to the Cloud Sea! No wonder so many elders like to travel the world!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo\u2019s head shook like a rattle drum. \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for the water cloud embryo, I won\u2019t come to this ghastly place! Oh, but the cloud messengers are good \u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Sheng saw Zuo Mo\u2019s greedy state and he laughed. A strange feeling rose.</p><br/><p>In terms of strength, Shidi could be considered a great genius that rivaled him but his personality was completely different than any young genius he had ever seen. Of the geniuses that he had encountered, like the astounding Lin Qian or the many others, they were either had great intelligence and deep talent or they had persistent hearts. Even he himself had only focused on the sword and nothing else.</p><br/><p>But Shidi was far from being considered the peak of intelligence. His personality was lively, he was business-like and greedy for money. He learned all kinds of trades, spells, sword scriptures, seals, formations, forging, he learned a little of all of these, and many strange and weird things that Wei Sheng had never even heard of.</p><br/><p>If one saw the things that Shidi learned, he was definitely the classical example of what not to do.</p><br/><p>But even so, Shidi\u2019s strength had reached a level that was hard to believe.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t understand how Shidi had cultivated the way he did. Wei Sheng shook his head and laughed, throwing the question to the back of his mind.</p><br/><p>\u201cDoes Shidi recognize the water cloud embryo?\u201d Wei Sheng asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Zuo Mo nodded. He had made good preparations.</p><br/><p>Wei Sheng rested his heart. He suddenly realized that while Shidi looked unreliable usually but he never made major mistakes. Thinking about this, Wei Sheng was thoughtful.</p><br/><p>The further they walked in, the heavier the coldness of the ice mist was. The blue color of the ice mist increased and the ice crystals that formed the ice mist became bigger.</p><br/><p>There were still remnants of cloud grasses lingering on the ground. These cloud grasses had been frozen into little ice statues. They would occasionally see corpses of cloud beasts but they had also been frozen into ice and on their surface was a strange blue layer.</p><br/><p>The trio\u2019s expressions became solemn. All the traces indicated that when the ice mist arrived, these cloud beasts had not had a chance to escape.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, A Gui turned her head but no one noticed. Her empty and wooden eyes stared into the depths of the ice mist, a purple light flashed across her eyes.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo was slightly worried that the sudden appearance of the ice mist would have destroyed all the water cloud embryos.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, a wave of rustling noises came from the ice mist. The three instantly showed wary expressions, stopped moving, and went on guard!</p><br/><p>A pair of blue eyes appeared in the ice mist.</p><br/><p>The trio felt a strong feeling of danger!</p><br/><p>Without any hesitation, the black sword in Wei Sheng\u2019s hands suddenly sliced forward!</p><br/><p>The black and empty sword essence tore apart the ice mist in front of them and exposed the other\u2019s true body!</p><br/><p>A female whose body glowed like crystal appeared in front of them. She had a pair of deep blue eyes, her hair was a pure snowy white and her chin was sharp it had an uncanny and beautiful resemblance to work of craftsmanship. Her small lips did not hold any blush. Layer upon layer of light blue ice mist spin around her and her body that was bare flickered in and out of view.</p><br/><p>When Zuo Mo and the others look down, they were astounded.</p><br/><p>Countless blue ice crystals moved on the ground like quicksand. Her lower body was completely made up of this kind of blue ice.</p><br/><p>\u201cMist People!\u201d Pu Yao and Wei\u2019s exclamations sounded in Zuo Mo\u2019s mind at almost the same time.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo\u2019s heart suddenly jumped and he rushed to ask, \u201cWhat are the Mist People?\u201d</p><br/><p>He had a bad feeling. This was the first time that Pu Yao and Wei shouted in shock at the same matter.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow is it possible?\u201d Wei murmured to himself. The aloofness on his face had disappeared and what replaced it was deep disbelief as though he was seeing a ghost.</p><br/><p>Pu Yao\u2019s face was not much better. His expression suddenly changed as he shouted, \u201cQuick ,run!\u201d</p><br/><p>Run?</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo\u2019s mind blanked. Not good!</p><br/><p>Pu Yao usually looked down on everything. This was the first time Pu Yao did not hesitate in telling him to run!</p><br/><p>This would only be one kind of circumstance\u2014the other\u2019s strength was such that even Pu Yao was wary!</p><br/><p>In a flash, Zuo Mo\u2019s mind was abnormally clear. He prepared to call Wei Sheng and Zong Ru to flee when something suddenly changed!</p><br/><p>At some unknown time, their legs had been wrapped up in slender flows of ice mist. No matter how they struggled, they were unable to move!</p><br/><p>Wei Sheng and Zong Ru instantly detected it and their expressions changed. Yet no matter how they channeled ling power, the slender flows of ice mist did not move at all.</p><br/><p>The three had hopeless expressions.</p><br/><p>None of the Little Ones were an exception and were firmly tied up as well. Silly Bird that was usually the boss had been tied until she looked like a knot.</p><br/><p>The mist person looked indifferently at them. The ice crystals under her body supported her and slowly moved her near them.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo knew that they were finished. The difference in strength was too great, so great that they didn\u2019t even have a chance to escape.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are the Mist People?\u201d Zuo Mo\u2019s expression did not change as he asked in his sea of consciousness.</p><br/><p>Pu Yao and Wei definitely knew.</p><br/><p>\u201cAn ancient tribe!\u201d Wei\u2019s tone could not recover its usual calm. \u201cThey are not too famous, but they have endured. It is possible to see traces of their presence in every era. I had not imagined they would had survived until now!\u201d</p><br/><p>Pu Yao\u2019s expression was complex. He was widely read and knew what the Mist People were.</p><br/><p>Everyone had assumed that the ancient tribes had died out long ago. Who could have thought that they would see the lucky survivors of an ancient tribe in the depth of the Cloud Sea!</p><br/><p>Pu Yao who had received the elite education of yao knew much more about all kinds of secrets than normal yao. However, about ancient tribes, no matter if it was the xiuzhe world, the mo world, or the yao world, the conclusion was unusually in consensus.</p><br/><p>They had died out long ago!</p><br/><p>Ancient tribe?</p><br/><p>This time, even Zuo Mo was shocked.</p><br/><p>A tribe as powerful as the Sun Tribe had died out for tens of thousands of years. An ancient tribe had managed to survive?</p><br/><p>Suddenly, the gaze of the mist person landed on Zuo Mo and they walked right up in front of him.</p><br/><p>Translator Ramblings: Even more delays in getting water cloud embryo. It\u2019s great that A Gui\u2019s status isn\u2019t time-sensitive.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

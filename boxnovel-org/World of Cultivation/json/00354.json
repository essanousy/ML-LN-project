She really had been too tired yesterday and slept deeply. She opened her heavy eyes, and opened the door to the room. When she saw the people that come outside, all the drowsiness instantly disappeared.</p><br/><p>The person that had knocked was Chi. His face was full of a warm smile. Behind him was a large crowd of people. Nan Yue found many of them familiar to the eye. But when she saw the House Elder of the Purple Lotus Yao Art House, she couldn\u2019t help but still.</p><br/><p>\u201cNan Yue, did we disturb your rest?\u201d Chi\u2019s tone was filled with warmth and concern, and none of the usual sternness as though he had become a completely different person.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, no no.\u201d Nan Yue instinctively shook her head.</p><br/><p>She finally recalled what those old looking people that looked familiar were. They were the elders of the yao art house.</p><br/><p>Two, three\u2026 \u2026 twelve!</p><br/><p>Nan Yue\u2019s scalp turned numb. All of the elders of the Purple Lotus Yao Art House Council of Elders was standing in front of her home! These elders that usually were high up and indifferent all had smiles on their faces, and harmonious auras. All of the upper level of the Purple Lotus Yao Art House was here without an exception.</p><br/><p>Seeing Nan Yue still where she stood, Chi instantly understood what it was. He couldn\u2019t help but smile and say, \u201cWhat? Are you not going to invite us in to sit?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh oh oh!\u201d Nan Yue finally reacted and seemed to wake up from her dream. She hurriedly moved away from the door. \u201cPlease come in, come in!\u201d</p><br/><p>The procession streamed in.</p><br/><p>The House Elder examined the bare room and said with a slight smile, \u201cStudent Nan Yue is really living simply! As expected of the role model of our house\u2019s other students. Our other students should learn from this valuable attitude.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nan Yue sweated. She wasn\u2019t simple, she was just poor. At this moment, she did not know how to respond, and could only murmur in agreement.</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever,\u201d the House Elder\u2019s tone changed as he said passionately, \u201cas the Chief Student Elder of the Purple Lotus Yao Art House, Student Nan Yue should shoulder a heavier burden! This is too far away, and not convenient. Oo, The house\u2019s Purple Lotus Park has a Spirit Clarity Residence still empty. Student Nan Yue will find it much more convenient when moved over there.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chi\u2019s gaze showed threads of admiration. Spirit Clarity Residence was the highest level of residence in the Purple Lotus Yao Art House. There were only three suites in total. The House Elder actually gave one to Nan Yue. The most valuable part of the Spirit Clarity Residence was the Spirit Clarity Pool. It could increase the cultivation speed of the consciousness. To say nothing of the high price in constructing the Spirit Clarity Pool, it could only be built on special geological forms.</p><br/><p>After that, the elders took their turns to persuade and were unparalleled in their friendliness.</p><br/><p>Nan Yue seemed to go through the entire process as though it was a dream. She did not know what to do. She only gradually refocused when the House Elder and the others had left for a while.</p><br/><p>Chief student elder? She had become the Chief Student Elder? And they had given her a Spirit Clarity Residence to use?</p><br/><p>Was she still dreaming?</p><br/><p>But when she pulled herself out of the initial excitement, she quickly understood the crux. It was not hard to guess what the attitude of the House Elder and the elders were for.</p><br/><p>They were here for Daren!</p><br/><p>Even though they hadn\u2019t mentioned one word about Daren today, but Nan Yue was one hundred percent certain that they had come for Daren!</p><br/><p>No, she had to report this to Daren!</p><br/><p>She suddenly remembered today was the day the first prison formed.</p><br/><p>Thinking to this, she instantly became excited. She inspected her consciousness. Even though she had not fully healed her injuries, but she had recovered enough to enter the first prison. She instantly entered meditation and directly entered the first prison.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>\u201cArgh, motherf***er!\u201d the pained Zuo Mo wailed.</p><br/><p>It had been a long time since his consciousness had been wounded. The long-absent pain appeared again. The feeling of pain seemed to have grown even stronger.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is the result of trying to show off,\u201d Pu Yao mocked neutrally.</p><br/><p>\u201cOuch \u2026 \u2026 ouch, which guy was scheming against me? No, I can\u2019t have suffered for nothing, I have to return it!\u201d The pained Zuo Mo still exposed his vengeful nature.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t a match,\u201d Pu Yao said mercilessly.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow can it be known without a fight? Tell me quickly!\u201d Zuo Mo looked as though he would not give up and was murderous.</p><br/><p>\u201cCrystal Void Qian Liu.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCrytal Void Qian Liu? What thing is that?\u201d Zuo Mo\u2019s face was curious.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t a thing, just a three hundred years little yao.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cChe, just a three hundred year little yao.\u201d Zuo Mo said unconcernedly.</p><br/><p>A tendon throbbed in Pu Yao\u2019s forehead. He forcibly suppressed it. \u201cHe comprehended water breath.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWater Breath?\u201d Zuo Mo instantly became alert and said braggingly, \u201cThat was water breath? Didn\u2019t it get destroyed by my Archaic Wasteland Sacrificial Art!\u201d</p><br/><p>Your Archaic Wasteland Sacrificial Art \u2026 \u2026</p><br/><p>The tendon in Pu Yao\u2019s forehead jumped again. He pretended to be calm and said, \u201cThat was an imprint he left behind three hundred years ago.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAn imprint left three hundred years ago!\u201d Zuo Mo jumped in fright. \u201cIn other words, he was this powerful three hundred years ago?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p><br/><p>The expression on Zuo Mo\u2019s face changed as he said embarrassedly, \u201cPeace is valuable, peace is valuable. It\u2019s not good to fight and kill for nothing!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ignoring Pu Yao\u2019s disdainful gaze, he asked curiously, \u201cWhy did his imprint attack me? I didn\u2019t offend him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe finds you an eyesore.\u201d</p><br/><p>Pu Yao\u2019s caused Zuo Mo\u2019s expression to become even more embarrassed. \u201cIt seems that Ten Finger Prison is really a dangerous place. I should not go to such a kind of place.\u201d</p><br/><p>Pu Yao heard this and thought inside, no, if Zuo Mo was afraid and did not go to the Ten Finger Prison in the future, it would be a troublesome matter. He was very familiar with Zuo Mo\u2019s personality. This guy could not be forced, and could only be tempted. If there were enough benefits, this guy would howl and charge.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a bit of danger, but there are also many benefits.\u201d Pu Yao\u2019s expression was indifferent as though he was speaking objectively. \u201cYou destroyed his imprint, and swallowed his water breath bead. Haven\u2019t you felt anything?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo finally remembered after Pu Yao\u2019s remember the bead he had swallowed before he had fainted. He hurriedly made an examination and immediately found the water breath bead.</p><br/><p>A glowing dewy bead floated in his sea of consciousness. The sea of consciousness where a sea of flames danced had a lively and abundant humidity. The faint moisture spread from the dew bead. Wherever the moisture passed, the wounded consciousness was like burnt soil receiving nurturing and became full of life again. Zuo Mo felt unspeakably comfortable.</p><br/><p>This was something really good!</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo\u2019s mind moved. The dew bead flew in front of him and a warm moisture blew into his face.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe water breath bead can heal?\u201d</p><br/><p>To make Zuo Mo understand the value of the water breath bead, Pu Yao naturally spoke endlessly. \u201cNot just healing. With it, you will have an easier time comprehending your own water breath. Once you have comprehended water breath, it will merge into the water breath that you comprehend. You will have an easier time casting the great majority of water yao arts, and water element spells, their power would also be greater.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis powerful?\u201d Zuo Mo felt very excited. He was clear to the value embodied. With this water breath bead, it meant that his affinity to water had increased. This would increase the strength of a major type of yao arts and spells.</p><br/><p>Water element spells, ge knows them! He cast a [Little Art of Cloud and Rain] with pride. A palm-size could instantly floated in his palm.</p><br/><p>Hm, the cloud ball from the [Little Art of Cloud and Rain] this time was different than before.</p><br/><p>The cloud ball seemed to be alive. The threads of rain that fell seemed to contain vitality. When they landed in Zuo Mo\u2019s palm, then sunk into Zuo Mo\u2019s skin and disappeared. Zuo Mo felt refreshed.</p><br/><p>The sixth level of [Little Art of Cloud and Rain]!</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo\u2019s eyes widened, his face full of disbelief. Just with the addition of a water breath bead, his [Little Art of Cloud and Rain] had leveled up to the sixth level!</p><br/><p>The sixth level of [Little Art of Cloud and Rain] was significantly useful!</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo was overjoyed.</p><br/><p>Treasure! Great treasure!</p><br/><p>\u201cCan this even be called a treasure?\u201d Pu Yao seemed to know Zuo Mo\u2019s thoughts, and an imperceptible smile floated on the corners of Pu Yao\u2019s mouth. He continued to tempt Zuo Mo, \u201cThe water breath was just from the prison-breaking battle of the first prison. Each prison of the Ten Finger Prison has something good. Only what is in the later prisons can be called treasures.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEach prison has their own?\u201d Zuo Mo\u2019s eyes lit up.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Are you interested?\u201d Pu Yao glanced at Zuo Mo with deliberate calmness.</p><br/><p>\u201cInterested! Very interested!\u201d Zuo Mo nodded frantically. He rubbed his palms and said warmly, \u201cPu Yao, let\u2019s get them all! So many treasures, they can\u2019t be wasted!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis will depend on your skills.\u201d Pu Yao did not refute it. \u201cThe later prison-breaking battles will be more powerful than this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Countless jingshi spun in Zuo Mo\u2019s eyes. He drooled and said with a stupid smile, \u201cThat\u2019s nothing, we can wear them down, wear them to death!\u201d</p><br/><p>The water breath bead was wondrous as expected. Not long after, Zuo Mo\u2019s injured consciousness was healed. Zuo Mo was full of praise, and desired the other treasures even more.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go, you have not named your prison battlefield yet,\u201d Pu Yao said as he pulled Zuo Mo into Vast Water Clear Skies.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo looked at the unfamiliar environment, his mouth wide, and his face stunned.</p><br/><p>The criss-crossing river flows from before had all disappeared. The shards of stone under his feet had also disappeared. What replaced them were squares of different colors. The various colored tiles extended into the distance like an enormous chess board.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat what is this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNothing big.\u201d Pu Yao suppressed the shock inside and said in a normal tone. \u201cYou broke the first prison left by someone before you, so the first prison will be reconstructed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, so it\u2019s like that.\u201d Zuo Mo\u2019s face showed realization</p><br/><p>He casually walked forward and stepped into a green square. There were no changes. He stepped into another square, and there was still no change.</p><br/><p>It just changed appearance.</p><br/><p>The shock in Zuo Mo\u2019s heart disappeared. He felt it was very boring, and his expression disappeared.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, the scene in front of him changed again.</p><br/><p>He seemed to have flown to a very high place and was looking down from an aerial view. He saw an enormous chessboard, the disorderly tiles formed a strange shape. The figure seemed slightly familiar to Zuo Mo. He quickly understood what the pattern was. Wasteland beast, that was a wasteland beast!</p><br/><p>\u201cCreate a name.\u201d Pu Yao\u2019s light voice sounded at Zuo Mo\u2019s ears.</p><br/><p>\u201cWasteland Beast Chessboard.\u201d Zuo Mo\u2019s mind moved, and he blurted out.</p><br/><p>Boom boom boom!</p><br/><p>The sound was like thunder. The pattern of the wasteland beast on the chessboard seemed to suddenly become alive. A thread of grey smoke came out of the chessboard, and in a blink, turn to a wasteland beast.</p><br/><p>The lantern sized red and vicious eyes, the bleak and disdainful presence, the roiling and shapeless body.</p><br/><p>It glanced at Zuo Mo and suddenly burrowed back into the chessboard.</p><br/><p>The chessboard under him once again became what it was originally.</p><br/><p>In the minds of the yao that had excitedly charged into the first prison, three words floated up simultaneously\u2014Wasteland Beast Chessboard!</p><br/><p>Translator Ramblings: Zuo Mo\u2019s proven history of terrible names have been broken \u2026 \u2026 actually, the name come from what Pu Yao\u2019s teacher created so this isn\u2019t really something he made. Nan Yue is so protective of her Daren \u2026 \u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Luo Li had only tore down the jinzhi at the mouth but didn\u2019t go in. He clearly came prepared. Luo Li might be doted upon by all the elders but he didn\u2019t dare to act too brashly. If the ling grasses and herbs inside the valley were damaged, the elders in the sect wouldn\u2019t let him off.</p><br/><p>Machinations in the shadows, Zuo Mo was clear the other didn\u2019t dare use them on him. The kind of identity that a ling plant farmer had, it meant that he would receive the sect\u2019s protection. What the other could use was an open and public attack.</p><br/><p>Looking at the mess and the completely ruined jinzhi, even though Zuo Mo knew the other was just venting, but his anger still rose. The other had definitely come because of Hao Min Shijie. Zuo Mo wasn\u2019t scared. He had reason on his side. Even if it got brought up to the sect leader, no one would say that he was wrong.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo controlled the anger, his voice mocking, \u201cShixiong\u2019s sword is so sharp. A pity to waste these flowers and grasses.\u201d</p><br/><p>Luo Li looked coldly at Zuo Mo, his eyes filled with disdain and contempt, \u201cWhether my sword is sharp or not, you will know. You dare to touch my woman.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Zuo Mo brushed it off. He looked at his right hand and said unconcernedly, \u201cSo what if I touched her?\u201d</p><br/><p>If there hadn\u2019t been the previous incident with Hao Min, these two were people that he would have tried to curry favor with. But since it had proceeded to this step, both sides like water and fire, there was no possibility of peace. Zuo Mo\u2019s stubbornness came out. Rather than be bullied, he would rather rebel. Even if it might end terribly for him, he wouldn\u2019t let the other off easily. If he didn\u2019t have some viciousness, with his origins as an outer sect disciple, he would be greatly bullied in the future.</p><br/><p>Luo Li\u2019s pupils shrunk, the indifferent expression on his face finally changing, \u201cThree months, the assessment of the sect, I\u2019ll wait for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou said wait, so you\u2019ll wait?\u201d Zuo Mo smiled coldly, and gasped, \u201cShixiong\u2019s face is so big!\u201d</p><br/><p>Luo Li\u2019s expression twisted. His eyes sprouted fire as he looked at Zuo Mo. He barely managed to control himself and snorted angrily, \u201cHm, let\u2019s see if your mouth is still that hard then!\u201d Finishing, he flew off.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho does he think he is?\u201d Zuo Mo snorted coldly. He turned to walk inside the valley. Everything in the valley was undisturbed. Luo Li basically didn\u2019t come in. Luo Li might be arrogant but he wasn\u2019t dumb. He controlled his behaviour. Ruining the jinzhi of West Wind Valley but not touching the ling grasses in the valley, the elders of the sect would let it go.</p><br/><p>They forbid fighting in the sect. Every sect would have this kind of rules. But fighting inside the sect would always happen. There were many reasons but one of the most important ones was undoubtedly the implicit permission of the elders in the sect. What a sect was afraid of was not having a competitive environment. The occasional skirmish was more beneficial than harmful in the eyes of elders. In most cases, they held a permissive attitude.</p><br/><p>But Zuo Mo felt that these things didn\u2019t have too much to do with him. He didn\u2019t believe that Luo Li would dare come into West Wind Valley. His West Wind Valley was one of the important areas of the sect, possibly even more important than Cold Mist Valley.</p><br/><p>Just like normal, he continued to make dan, right up until Li Ying Feng Shijie came.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Zuo Mo cried out, \u201cWhat kind of rule is that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Ying Feng explained, \u201cIt\u2019s really like this. Supposedly, because the sect forbid the disciples from fighting so they made the sect assessment the place for resolving conflicts. He can challenge you at that time and you must take it up. If you don\u2019t, you have to give the other fifty contribution points.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut I am a ling plant farmer! I, a ling plant farmer, do you want me to grab a flying sword and start fighting with him?\u201d Zuo Mo was indignant.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can ask someone.\u201d Li Ying Feng was also helpless, \u201cThat doesn\u2019t break the rules. Production cultivators like you can use the dan you make or what you\u2019ve planted to hire others. But you can only ask the other shixiong in the sect, not anyone from other sects.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe other shixiong in the sect? Wei Sheng Shixiong hasn\u2019t come out, who else can I invite?\u201d Zuo Mo felt that he was going crazy. The only person in the sect that could win over Luo Li was Wei Sheng Shixiong. But Wei Sheng Shixiong was in the Sword Cave and won\u2019t be coming out soon.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe rules are like this.\u201d Li Ying Feng suggested, \u201cYou could go buy some powerful talismans.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo felt that he was going to faint. Buy talismans? He was so poor he only had the dregs. Buying talismans! Only now did Zuo Mo understand what Luo Li had meant in his last word that day. His mood instantly became terrible.</p><br/><p>Damn it! It was going to be big trouble!</p><br/><p>Facing Luo Li outside the valley, he wasn\u2019t afraid because he had been confident that Luo Li didn\u2019t dare to do anything to him. When he knew that the inner sect had this rule, he instantly blanked. Things like sword energy, it was fine to use to frighten people. Facing Luo Li who practiced [Empty Sword], he, someone who didn\u2019t even have a sword scripture, wouldn\u2019t even know how he died.</p><br/><p>The elders in the sect, of course, wouldn\u2019t let Luo Li really injure him, but humiliation wouldn\u2019t be avoided. Fifty contribution points, that was a very large amount of wealth. If he sold himself, he wouldn\u2019t get fifty contribution points. Thinking about it, Zuo Mo became even more depressed.</p><br/><p>Li Ying Feng looked in sympathy at Zuo Mo. She wanted to help but had no way. She could only take the Great Strength Pills that Zuo Mo had prepared and left.</p><br/><p>The news that Luo Li had sent out a challenge to Zuo Mo was instantly spread to everyone in the sect. These days when Hao Min saw Zuo Mo, she instantly became high and mighty. Zuo Mo wanted to slap her again. The gazes of everyone else when they saw Zuo Mo was extremely strange. Of course, there wasn\u2019t a lack of others who were laughing at Zuo Mo. No one thought that Zuo Mo was going to have a good outcome.</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard that your Luo Li Shixiong sent a challenge to you?\u201d Shi Feng Rong calmly asked Zuo Mo.</p><br/><p>Even Master knew\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo could only reply, \u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEn. The matter between you and your Hao Min Shijie, I won\u2019t interfere.\u201d Shi Feng Rong said coldly, \u201cBut the assessment in the sect, I don\u2019t care what method you use, but you will not lose. If you lose, hmm\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The implication in the last sound made Zuo Mo\u2019s already withered heart dry up like a flower petal and scatter to the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis disciple is only a ling plant farmer\u2026\u2026\u201d Zuo Mo couldn\u2019t help reminding Master.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo what if you are a ling plant farmer?\u201d Shi Feng Rong\u2019s voice went up, her eyes resolute, \u201cMy disciple cannot lose!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care what method you use.\u201d Shi Feng Rong impatiently interrupted Zuo Mo.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo\u2019s heart turned and he said, \u201cMaster is so confident in this disciple, this disciple naturally doesn\u2019t want to fail. This disciple has nothing to request except to pick a sword scripture from the records room.\u201d Since Master wanted him not to lose, than it would be dumb if he didn\u2019t ask for a bit of help. He thought of the [Li Water Sword Scripture] in the records room.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too late for you to start practicing the sword now.\u201d Shi Feng Rong furrowed her brow.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis disciple only has this one request.\u201d Zuo Mo saw that it might be possible and his heart lightened as he hurried responded.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, I can agree.\u201d She looked at Zuo Mo and her voice was stern as she said, \u201cBut if you lose, I won\u2019t let you off lightly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Zuo Mo resolutely promised.</p><br/><p>\u201cTake this tile. You can pick a sword scripture from the records room.\u201d Shi Feng Rong\u2019s expression was icy as she stated.</p><br/><p>Three months. Right now, Zuo Mo was only grateful the sect assessment was three months in the future. He still had a hint of life!</p><br/><p>With the quickest possible speed, he picked [Li Water Sword Scripture] and ran for the Little West Wind Yard.</p><br/><p>He was clear what Luo Li was planning on. The whole sect ,everyone felt that he didn\u2019t have a chance of winning but Zuo Mo didn\u2019t want to admit defeat like this. Whenever he thought of Luo Li and Hao Min\u2019s faces, the anger in his chest rose. And this would directly decide his future status in the sect. To say of nothing else, Master\u2019s warning was in his ears.</p><br/><p>Wasn\u2019t it just a sword scripture?</p><br/><p>What was simpler than sword scripture? After getting sliced a few thousand times, would he get it?</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo thought hatefully.</p><br/><p>There was no possibility of winning if he relied on normal methods. His gamble was all on Pu Yao. But gambling on Pu Yao meant countless jingshi.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou want help? Alright, as long as you can pay the jingshi. Anything can be discussed.\u201d Pu Yao said interestedly, \u201cIf the price you pay is high enough, oh, I can go sort Luo Li out immediately. Guarantee no one would find out.\u201d</p><br/><p>As expected\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>As Zuo Mo expected, Pu Yao started his extortion.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? It\u2019s higher than the previous price? Of course, this is called reacting to the market!\u201d The smile on Pu Yao\u2019s face was enchanting, \u201cYou have to consider it well. The price tomorrow would be even higher.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo went to find Li Ying Feng.</p><br/><p>\u201cShijie, how much jingshi can you lend me?\u201d Zuo Mo\u2019s eyes were red, his throat rough.</p><br/><p>Li Ying Feng didn\u2019t hesitate, \u201cI can lend it all, three third grade!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMany thanks, Shijie!\u201d Zuo Mo didn\u2019t waste words. There was only gratefulness in his heart. It was only at the crucial time that it could be seen if a person was worthy.</p><br/><p>Old Black, and Guo Lu also unhesitatingly gave all the jingshi they had to Zuo Mo. Even Xu Qing secretly gave Zuo Mo fifty pieces of second grade jingshi. The whole sect knew that Zuo Mo was borrowing jingshi. Many people were looking at it as a joke.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid he ask you yet?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHa, I don\u2019t dare to lend to him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExactly. Just became an inner sect disciple and dare to offend Hao Min Shijie, he really thinks he\u2019s someone!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, I remember that Xiao Mo was a pretty steady person, why would he do something so dumb?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen a little person enjoys success, they become arrogant!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo sold all of the mature ling herbs and grasses in his ling fields and received one piece of third grade jingshi.</p><br/><p>Roughly calculating, Zuo Mo had about six pieces of third grade jingshi on his hands.</p><br/><p>This was a huge sum, a sum that Zuo Mo had never even thought about. Not long ago, his yearly income was twenty or so second grade jingshi. The six pieces of third grade jingshi gave off an enticing shine and a strong ling energy vibration.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is everything I gathered, give it all to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo threw the six pieces of third grade jingshi to Pu Yao.</p><br/><p>Pu Yao grinned as he took the jingshi. He played with one with his right hand, gently throwing it up and then gently catching it. His expression was intoxicated as he said, \u201cSuch a moving sound, jingshi is really the most reliable thing in this world.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTeach me this!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo took out the jade stick for [Li Water Sword Scripture], his voice resolute.</p><br/><p>His expression was slightly tired, the zombie face slightly gray but the pair of eyes were like two balls of jumping flames, hot and vicious.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

The black gold seal soldier! The face that was a mirror-image of Zuo Mo\u2019s instantly smiled and then he rushed over.</p><br/><p>\u201cBig Brow, I\u2019m hungry, is there something to eat?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo\u2019s brow twitched. Eat? This glutton! He had already eaten all two hundred ling beasts in one go and then had slept until now. Once he opened his eyes, what he wanted to do first was eat.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Zuo Mo\u2019s face was stern as he stared with unfriendliness at the glutton in front of him.</p><br/><p>The black gold seal soldier suddenly sniffed. His eyes lit up and then his body disappeared.</p><br/><p>Wails from mo steeds came from outside the room.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo smacked his forehead with his hand. He looked upwards and was speechless. Little Mo Ge had always been clever and rarely got involved in unprofitable business. However, he tripped up on this glutton.</p><br/><p>A ball of wind blew by and the black gold seal soldier appeared in front of Zuo Mo. He licked his lips and said with discontent, \u201cThere wasn\u2019t much flavor.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo\u2019s already unfriendly glance immediately became even more unfriendly.</p><br/><p>He decided to have a good talk with the black gold seal soldier. It was best to adjust the incorrect perspectives of a delinquent youth now from just knowing to eat and sleep.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou want to eat well?\u201d Zuo Mo had a pure smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course!\u201d The black gold seal soldier\u2019s eyes lit up. \u201cBig Bro, where, where?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you want to eat well, you have to work hard. Those that work can eat, those that don\u2019t work can\u2019t, the more you work, the more you can eat.\u201d Zuo Mo said with a smile. His expression was very similar to Wei.</p><br/><p>Bam bam bam!</p><br/><p>The black gold seal soldier beat his chest and it rang out metallically. He said with bravado, \u201cBig Bro, I\u2019ll do what you say!\u201d</p><br/><p>Good, good, this delinquent youth was not at a level that was unsavable.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo rejoiced inside and his eyes moved. \u201cDo you know how to fight?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBorn to Battle.\u201d The black gold seal soldier paused slightly and then said seriously, \u201cI will fight if there is food, but I will not fight if there is no food. I will fight more if there is more food!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo\u2019s smile froze on his face.</p><br/><p>So other than looking the same as him, this guy was as cunning as he was.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo felt a headache.</p><br/><p>Just at this time, Ceng Lian\u2019Er suddenly walked in. She saw the black gold seal soldier with his familiar appearance and had a curious expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is this?\u201d She pointed at the black gold seal soldier and asked Zuo Mo.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss! Please do not use terms casually!\u201d The black gold seal soldier said seriously, \u201cI am not a thing, I am Black Gold. Oh, Big Bro, who is she? This girl is pretty beautifully, Big Bro, your tastes finally leveled up. However, you abandoned A Gui? Big Bro, how can you do that? You abandoned the first wife, I had a wrong opinion of you! As expected of my big bro, a cruel rake, a libertine, I need to learn from you \u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo wanted to die.</p><br/><p>Other than being a glutton and a sleeper, this was a chatterbox! Heavens, so many valuable materials wasted on creating him, all of it for nothing, truly no profit at all!</p><br/><p>Ceng Lian\u2019er looked with interest at the black gold seal soldier.</p><br/><p>The black gold seal soldier had keen eyes and rushed to A Gui\u2019s side like a gust of wind when he saw her. \u201cA Gui, A Gui! Big Brother didn\u2019t abandon you! I was just saying, Big Bro is such an honorable person, how could he abandon A Gui. A Gui, A Gui, is there something to eat? I\u2019m so hungry!\u201d</p><br/><p>A Gui suddenly turned around and walked outside. The black gold seal soldier immediately followed behind her and started to flatter her.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo was dumbstruck.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe is?\u201d There was a smile at the corner of Ceng Lian\u2019er\u2019s mouth. This caused her eyes to become even more alluring.</p><br/><p>\u201cA terrible accident.\u201d Zuo Mo spread his hands with an expression of distaste.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are many xiuzhe that have come to Great Peace City.\u201d Ceng Lian\u2019er suddenly said.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiuzhe?\u201d Zuo Mo stilled. After staying for so long in the mo world, even he felt slightly unfamiliar when he heard the word xiuzhe.</p><br/><p>Ceng Lian\u2019er\u2019s eyes curved slightly as she said, \u201cIt is the four great sects. At least twenty people, and some are very strong. Their disguise is very good, no one has discovered them yet.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe four great?\u201d Zuo Mo was surprised and his expression immediately turned grave. \u201cHow come the four have come?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGreat Peace Treasure Pavilion.\u201d Ceng Lian\u2019er spat out the four words.</p><br/><p>\u201cGreat Peace Treasure Pavilion?\u201d Zuo Mo didn\u2019t quite believe it. What kind of sects were the four great sects. When the Sun Shen Temple in Cloud Sea Jie had opened, only Tian Huan had come. And even then they had sent just one yuanying xiuzhe. For sects like the great four that had a long history, there were very few treasure hoards that they would target.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo didn\u2019t quite believe that the Great Peace Treasure Pavilion would attract the great four.</p><br/><p>\u201cI fought against them.\u201d When Ceng Lian\u2019er threw the words out, she scared Zuo Mo half to death.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re crazy!\u201d</p><br/><p>Now he believed it and immediately felt a headache. On this side, A Wen and the others had suddenly disappeared and there were undercurrents swirling in Great Peace City. Now, even the xiuzhe had come to participate. Even as dumb as he was, he knew the situation would become even more complex.</p><br/><p>He suddenly thought of a question. \u201cWhat is in the Great Peace Treasure Pavilion? Why would even the four great sects of the xiuzhe come?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ceng Lian\u2019er was silent.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo stared directly at her.</p><br/><p>A moment later, she said serenely, \u201cInside the Great Peace Treasure Pavilion, there are three treasures. The other two are unidentified but there is one that many people know of. It is a stele.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA stele?\u201d There was a disbelieving expression on Zuo Mo\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe most crucial stele of the Great Peace Mo Skill Steles.\u201d Ceng Lian\u2019er\u2019s eyes were blurry. Her voice was ethereal. \u201cEver since the ancient era and after the era of shen power, the xiuzhe, yao, and mo have rose to power. Yao arts, mo skills, xiuzhe spells, these three cultivation methods have been the most popular. The method of shen power cultivation has been lost, but as the cultivation realms increased, the experts of the three races found that they encountered a block in their cultivation. They tried many ways to surpass this blockade but they could not break through this barrier.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo listened quietly. Ceng Lian\u2019er\u2019s ethereal voice added a faint mysteriousness to these secrets.</p><br/><p>\u201cThese ancestors traced back to the origins of cultivation for multiple generations and found that the only method of breaking through this barrier is to cultivate shen power. All three powers are derived from shen power but because of this they are all also incomplete. When the three powers are cultivated to their limits, if one wants to increase further in power, they have to return to shen power. However, the way to cultivate shen power was lost long ago. They started to search for all kinds of shen power inheritances, but they are all unable to be connected with the present cultivation systems. The legends say that Shi Zi Ming found the solution. This mo skill stele records his knowledge but Shi Zi Ming did not dare to release the contents so he sealed it in the Great Peace Treasure Pavilion.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou also have come for this stele?\u201d Zuo Mo stared at Ceng Lian\u2019er.</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t consider it in the beginning,\u201d Ceng Lian\u2019er said serenely, \u201cbut since I am here, why not?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou already cultivate shen power, what is the use in having that?\u201d Zuo Mo asked in bewilderment.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy shen power inheritance is more complete than yours but it has also lost sections over generations. This stele is very important to me, and can supplement my [Moon Shen Records.]\u201d Ceng Lian\u2019er looked at Zuo Mo and said, \u201cYou are the most talented person I ever saw in cultivating shen power. Other than you, I have never seen anyone perform shen power breathing. However, you understanding of shen power is not as good as mine, even with your talent you are still only knocking on the door of shen power. Only by obtaining this stele can you finally step through the doorway to shen power.\u201d</p><br/><p>Only now did Zuo Mo understand why the Great Peace Treasure Pavilion was causing so many to be obsessed.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat does all this have to do with me?\u201d Zuo Mo smirked coldly. \u201cI was pulled in. Don\u2019t tell me this is a coincidence.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt really isn\u2019t a coincidence.\u201d Ceng Lian\u2019er\u2019s gaze was unfocused as she said serenely. \u201cThe rumors are that two keys are required to open the Great Peace Treasure Pavilion. No one knows what the first key is, but the second key is supposed to be a special person.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSpecial person?\u201d Zuo Mo stilled. He had never thought it would be such an absurd reason. He pointed at his nose and didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry as he said, \u201cIs this special person me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight now, you are the most likely.\u201d Ceng Lian\u2019er\u2019s eyes curved with mirth.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo was dumbstruck. \u201cWhy is it me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCausing Shifting Star Sands at the Mo Skill Steles. You were the first to cause a worldly apparition there.\u201d Ceng Lian\u2019er\u2019s eyes curled even more. Her flawless face was like a picure. \u201cShi Yue Yi also seems to have an interest in you. Qi Diao Yu discovered that you cultivate shen power. He also discovered that I and A Gui do too.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was such an absurd reason.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is something else you missed. When you achieved shen power breathing, the Mo Skill Steles responded to you. The city only suspects that you are that person, but I am the only one certain that you are.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ceng Lian\u2019er looked deeply at Zuo Mo and then disappeared.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo was stunned by Ceng Lian\u2019er\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>The black gold seal soldier followed behind A Gui and looked around occasionally. He appeared sneaky and his nose moved with hunger on his face.</p><br/><p>A Gui did not make a sound as she walked and jumped past the wall, it was as though she was walking on flat ground. She didn\u2019t attract any attention as she walked. The black gold seal soldier sneakily followed behind her with excitement and anticipation.</p><br/><p>With a few jumps, A Gui led the black gold seal soldier into a yard.</p><br/><p>This was the yard of the Celestial Planet Guards.</p><br/><p>A Gui suddenly appeared behind a Celestial Planet Guard like a ghost. With a light touch, this Celestial Planet Guard immediately fell unconscious and dropped to the ground.</p><br/><p>Then A Gui pushed open the wooden door that this Celestial Planet guard had been guarding. There were all kinds of mo steeds inside. This was the stable where the Celestial Planet Guard kept their mo steeds. The Celestial Planet Guard was the personal guard of Ceng Yi and their outfitted equipment was topnotch. Their mo steeds were not an exception to this. None of the mo steeds were of a low grade.</p><br/><p>The black gold seal soldier\u2019s eyes immediately lit up and started to drool.</p><br/><p>He opened his mouth and sucked. Hundreds of mo steeds were unable to react before they drastically shrank and fell into his mouth like a flood of dumplings. In a blink, the full pens were empty.</p><br/><p>The black gold seal soldier burped with a contented expression. He went to fawn over A Gui.</p><br/><p>A Gui was the best!</p><br/><p>At this moment, the smile on his face suddenly disappeared as he turned around.</p><br/><p>Murderousness flashed across the dark gold face that was a replica of Zuo Mo\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>Someone was sneaking in!</p><br/><p>Translator Ramblings: Zuo Mo has created something even greedier\u2026 \u2026 or is Black Gold just gluttonous? For some reason, I always imagine the seal soldier talking in a drawl, like he\u2019s slightly drunk or too lazy.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

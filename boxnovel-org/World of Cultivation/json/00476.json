Endless terror spread through his heart. He felt the other\u2019s gaze seemed to be looking at something dead, or a lamb waiting for slaughter!</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t want to die \u2026 \u2026</p><br/><p>What he did not know was that Zuo Mo\u2019s silence was on purpose to pressure him but because he was in heated discussion with Pu Yao and Wei.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>\u201cI want him to work for me.\u201d In the sea of consciousness, Zuo Mo shrugged with a matter-of-fact expression. \u201cBut he is a jindan and has a higher cultivation than I do. He\u2019s also skilled in formations so it is very dangerous. What suggestions do you have?\u201d</p><br/><p>Pu Yao said unconcernedly, \u201cIf you only want the forging knowledge in his mind, you can just draw out his soul.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDraw his soul?\u201d This phrase caused Zuo Mo to shudder uncontrollably.</p><br/><p>\u201cEven though it is slightly cruel, it is very effective. If you can draw out his soul, you can quickly possess the knowledge that belongs to him. How about it? Are you moved?\u201d Pu Yao\u2019s eerie red pupil narrowed and the slight smile on the corner of his mouth carried a coldness that was unique to him. He continued, \u201cOf course, there is nothing that is perfect in the world. You will receive his memories and comprehensions but it will also affect your mind.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo\u2019s hairs rose up when hearing this but he couldn\u2019t stop himself from asking, \u201cWhat are the effects?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUsually a personality split, a change in personality, etcetera, who knows? Everyone\u2019s played about with the soul for so many years, but no one truly understands,\u201d Pu Yao said irresponsibly.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo almost immediately blocked Pu Yao\u2019s method. He turned his face. \u201cWei, do you have any methods?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei thought for a moment and slowly opened, \u201cWe can only look in the direction of jinzhi.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJinzhi?\u201d Zuo Mo\u2019s eyes lit up but then his brow creased. \u201cHis cultivation is higher than mine, so I cannot put jinzhi in him. He\u2019s also skilled in formations so it might not be able to restrain him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know a type of ancient jinzhi that might work.\u201d Wei was very conservative in his words.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo\u2019s eyes lit up, \u201cWhat jinzhi? Tell me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Pu Yao also had curiosity on his face. Wei\u2019s existence was more ancient than his and he was also curious what kind of strange and wondrous jinzhi Wei could produce.</p><br/><p>\u201cI feel we must first discuss payment,\u201d Wei said smilingly.</p><br/><p>In this moment, Zuo Mo felt Wei\u2019s expression was almost the exact same as Pu Yao. His expression instantly crumbled. Pu Yao was a calamity. Whomever stayed with him would be affected. Even this guy\u2019s heart was black!</p><br/><p>\u201cSeriously!\u201d Zuo Mo wailed.</p><br/><p>Wei was not affected and smiled at Zuo Mo.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo quickly surrendered. \u201cAlright, what payment do you want?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGuard Camp cultivates mo skills, it is not suited for Pu, give it to me,\u201d Wei said with the same smile.</p><br/><p>Pu Yao\u2019s eyes instantly narrowed and became as long and cold as a blade, his entire body exuding an extremely dangerous presence.</p><br/><p>Wei was not affected by this as though he did not detect the change, \u201cMy previous master was a mo, and I understand more about how to cultivate mo skills than Pu. I can get them to grow more quickly. Also, to date Guard Camp hasn\u2019t produced even one battle general, this is enough to show that Pu Yao is not suited to teaching Guard Camp.\u201d</p><br/><p>Pu Yao\u2019s expression was unfriendly. His entire person was like a cold blade that was unsheathed, the black robes he was wearing flapping despite the lack of wind as though he would leap and consume his enemy.</p><br/><p>For Pu Yao, Guard Camp was something he was used to wile away his time. He didn\u2019t find it so important but that did not mean he would allow someone to take it away from him! How could the proud Pu Yao tolerate such a matter happening to him?</p><br/><p>The black fire in the sea of consciousness seemed to solidify.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo felt his scalp turn numb. Both of these were people he could not afford to offend!</p><br/><p>How had he been pulled into the battle between them?</p><br/><p>This was dangerous! Too dangerous for his life!</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t dare to make a sound. He suspected that if he showed even the slightest bit of agreement, Pu Yao would tear him to pieces on the spot.</p><br/><p>Pu Yao\u2019s voice was bone-chillingly cold. \u201cJinzhi? Who doesn\u2019t know jinzhi? Just one type of jinzhi and you want Guard Camp? You are delusional! A certain fake gentleman won\u2019t teach, I\u2019ll teach you! This jinzhi is called Purple Netherworld Curse \u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei\u2019s faint voice interrupted, \u201cPurple Netherworld Curse can only be cast by Rahula Yao, if there isn\u2019t not enough spiritual power, it would backlash on the user.\u201d</p><br/><p>Pu Yao stilled and his expression became uglier. \u201cHmph, other than Purple Netherworld Curse, there is the Needle Ghost Curse.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Needle Ghost Curse needs thirteen yin bone needles, those aren\u2019t easy to find!\u201d</p><br/><p>Pu Yao\u2019s face became increasingly dark. He suddenly smiled coldly. \u201cOh, then I want to see what your jinzhi is.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you have agreed?\u201d Wei looked fearlessly at Pu Yao.</p><br/><p>Pu Yao said proudly, \u201cWith this guy\u2019s power, a skill that can be realized at the spot, without any side-effect. If you can do it, so what if I give you Guard Camp!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo wanted to say weakly, \u201cBig Brothers, Guard Camp is actually mine \u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>But intelligence caused him to keep his mouth closed. He couldn\u2019t offend any of these two big bosses!</p><br/><p>Suddenly, his mind became alert. Fight! Keep fighting! The more you fight, the more benefits ge gets! How did the phrase go, the crane and the clam fights, while the fisherman gets the rice \u2026 \u2026[i]</p><br/><p>He closed his mouth tightly and didn\u2019t say a word.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, then I will be disrespectful.\u201d Wei smiled warmly but his words hide needles among the cotton that caused Pu Yao\u2019s face to become a fraction uglier.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is nothing in verbal battle. I\u2019m still waiting for you wondrous jinzhi to broaden my visions,\u201d Pu Yao said ambiguously.</p><br/><p>Wei finally said lightly, \u201cThis jinzhi is called Soul Setting Divine Light.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing this name, Pu Yao\u2019s expression suddenly changed. His abruptly opening pupil was full of disbelief. \u201cSoul Setting Divine Light! You actually comprehend Soul Setting Divine Light!\u201d</p><br/><p>It was the first time Zuo Mo had seen such an expression on Pu Yao\u2019s face. There was a shock of terror within the amazement and deep disbelief.</p><br/><p>Soul Setting Divine Light? What was that?</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo\u2019s mind was full of puzzlement. If it could cause Pu Yao to lose his composure, then it must be very powerful.</p><br/><p>Wei still had that same gentle smile but at the time, it was full of immeasurability. \u201cI tried to learn it incidentally but I didn\u2019t learn it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho are you really?\u201d Pu Yao looked hard at Wei. If it wasn\u2019t that they would live and die together and coexist together, he would have not been able to stop himself from attacking!</p><br/><p>He suddenly found that he knew pitifully little about Wei\u2019s origins. Other than knowing Wei was once the gravestone armor of the former corps commander, he knew mothering else.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am Wei.[ii]\u201d Wei smiled as usual, the smile warm as the sunlight of the dawn.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo saw the two\u2019s tense face-off and instantly became nervous. Big Brothers, this is an\u2019s sea of consciousness, he instantly threw the idea of the fisherman getting the rice to the back of his head and tried to make peace, \u201cLet\u2019s talk peacefully, let\u2019s talk peacefully. What is this Soul Setting Divine Light? Is it very powerful?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei smiled at him.</p><br/><p>Pu Yao said coldly, \u201cIf even you didn\u2019t learn it, how can you teach him?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei smiled, \u201cMy talent is not good, it is normal that I could not learn it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Pu Yao seemed to hear a joke. \u201cYou feel this boy is talented? Even though he is my student, but his talents, hmph hmph, very normal!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo didn\u2019t accept that, and his face suddenly became black!</p><br/><p>What? Ge\u2019s talents were not good?</p><br/><p>\u201cGe\u2019s talents are not good?\u201d Zuo Mo shot back. \u201cHow was it that was crying and shouting to take ge as a student? Tsk tsk, burning the bridge after crossing it, eating and wiping clean then saying ge\u2019s talent isn\u2019t good?\u201d</p><br/><p>Pu Yao\u2019s old face turned red as he coughed violently.</p><br/><p>Wei had a wry smile on his face, \u201cYes, you can\u2019t be that kind of yao. How about you give this student to me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t push it.\u201d Pu Yao recovered his cold smirk, \u201cI\u2019m not a little child who doesn\u2019t know anything! Soul Setting Divine Light is one of the ancient Great Nine Divine Lights, is it easy to cultivate? If he really can learn it, you also have the qualifications to be his teacher. Otherwise, go find a cold place and stay there.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d Wei nodded without hesitation. He then reached out with his right hand after speaking. Black mist came out of his right hand and quickly gathered into a black ball. It was possible to see dots of light within the black ball that made it even more mysterious.</p><br/><p>Wei smiled at Zuo Mo and the black ball flew towards Zuo Mo and entered his body.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo\u2019s mind blank as he froze where he stood.</p><br/><p>In this instant, he felt an enormous and heterogeneous flood of mental thoughts swallowing him like an avalanche.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo seemed to be situated in a world of strange light. Everywhere was color. Zuo Mo had never seen such a variety and richness of color before. He thought that the colors in the entire world must be in here.</p><br/><p>Light!</p><br/><p>These rich colors were all kinds of light!</p><br/><p>Some were dim, some were bright, some were vivid in color, others as black as ink \u2026 \u2026</p><br/><p>They twisted, changed, were destroyed and created again!</p><br/><p>They lived and died in a cycle, changed constantly and were so vast that Zuo Mo could not see the borders.</p><br/><p>This was an ocean of light!</p><br/><p>There seemed to be a voice above Zuo Mo\u2019s head, but no matter how hard he tried to hear, he could not hear it clearly. But if he decided to ignore it, the voice would burrow into his ears again.</p><br/><p>There was only him alone in this rainbow world.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>In Zuo Mo\u2019s sea of consciousness, Pu Yao\u2019s face showed shock again. \u201cImprint! The imprint of the Soul Setting Divine Light!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei smiled slightly. \u201cIt is fortunate it has not dissipated. Otherwise it would be a pity.\u201d</p><br/><p>Pu Yao remained silent. He was thinking hard in his mind. If it was said that he had been very shocked that Wei understood how to cultivate the Soul Setting Divine Light, then Wei possessing the imprint of the Soul Setting Divine Light made him even more confident of the guess he had.</p><br/><p>The Soul Setting Divine Light was one of the ancient Great Nine Divine Lights. The number of people who had ever succeeded in cultivating it could be counted on the fingers. In the present day, most cultivators wouldn\u2019t have even heard of it.</p><br/><p>This great skill was famous in the ancient era and definitely had its outstanding aspects.</p><br/><p>Since Wei possessed the imprint of the Soul Setting Divine Light, then he should have a direct connection to the great ones that had created this great skill.</p><br/><p>Soul Setting Divine Light \u2026 \u2026 Soul Setting Divine Light \u2026 \u2026</p><br/><p>A bolt of lightning flashed in Pu Yao\u2019s mind, and his pupil suddenly widened.</p><br/><p>[i] The original idiom roughly translates to the crane and the clam fight, the fisherman benefits. It describes a case when two sides fight and is both wounded so that the third side benefits.</p><br/><p>[ii]  (Wei) means to guard, or Guardian. Wei\u2019s words have a double meaning.</p><br/><p>Translator Ramblings: Fang Xiang probably hinted this from the start but it probably got lost in the translation somewhat that Wei\u2019s name is actually the character for Guard Camp. I could have probably named it Wei Camp but that would have given away the plot too early.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo mangles all idioms, you have to excuse him.</p><br/><p>Who wrote the new summary on novelupdates? It is hilarious. May I copy it for the WOC summary page?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

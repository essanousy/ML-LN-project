It was not a good time to enter the fray now.</p><br/><p>Yet at this moment, a grey shadow suddenly flashed across his vision, and Zuo Mo\u2019s expression changed dramatically!</p><br/><p>A Gui!</p><br/><p>A Gui seemed to appear out of thin air behind Lu Han. Her hand that flashed with purple energy soundlessly pressed against Lu Han\u2019s back.</p><br/><p>Lu Han did not seem to detect it and continued to sprint forward. The purple handprint on his back created an eerie purple streak of light in the night.</p><br/><p>He went just three more zhang and the purple light continued to corrode Lu Han\u2019s body. But Lu Han didn\u2019t seem to detect it and flew forward. Patches of purple energy disappeared in the air like leaves swept up by the wind. What disappeared with them was Lu Han\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>Everyone who saw this felt as though an icy wind swept across their hearts and their hairs stood up.</p><br/><p>The stony-faced Rare Artifact Hall head guard\u2019s expression changed.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo also changed expression at the same time. He thought, this was bad. He didn\u2019t know why A Gui suddenly attacked Lu Han. A Gui was functioning on pure instinct, and she definitely had felt something! Had Lu Han in the past \u2026 \u2026</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo shook his head. This was not the time to think about this. It definitely wasn\u2019t possible to conceal A Gui\u2019s unexpected attack. There were two more people hiding in the shadows that would have seen her.</p><br/><p>Their identities would be soon exposed.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo took a deep breath and calmed the shock inside. His mind was peerlessly calm. There wasn\u2019t much time left to him. He needed to finish the setup before these people managed to react.</p><br/><p>Right now, there wasn\u2019t enough time to run away. Those that were gathering were the strongest experts in the world. The probability of running away from these people was almost zero. Also, the Reverse Shadow Soul Silkgrass was almost here. If he ran away now, all of his efforts would have been for waste.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo said gravely, \u201cGo, hurry to Grave Ghost Mound!\u201d</p><br/><p>At this time, he did not hide his strength and flew with all his power.</p><br/><p>A Gui, Ceng Lian\u2019er and Qinghua Xue heard this, didn\u2019t hesitate and flew at full power.</p><br/><p>A hint of shock flashed across the face of the Rare Artifact Hall head guard before his expression became indifferent again. \u201cAll of you, return first.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDaren!\u201d The other guards said panickedly.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou will not be able to participate in the upcoming battles.\u201d Then he leapt off the mo steed to chase after Zuo Mo and the others.</p><br/><p>The other guards looked at each other. One person quickly said, \u201cWe need to hurry back to report to Boss!\u201d</p><br/><p>The group did not hesitate and hurriedly returned.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo looked at the head guard that had caught up to them. He was slightly surprised and said, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to enter this mess!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI will naturally finish what Boss has ordered,\u201d the head guard said gravely.</p><br/><p>A hint of admiration flashed through Zuo Mo\u2019s eyes. \u201cWhat is Sir\u2019s name?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKuai An,\u201d the head guard said coolly.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo nodded and didn\u2019t speak further. The group focused on travelling.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>Flying at top speed, they managed to cover seven hundred li in less than two hours.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is the Grave Ghost Mound,\u201d Kuai An said.</p><br/><p>Without Kuai An\u2019s words, Zuo Mo would still know they reached their destination. This place was so heavy with yin energy that he could feel it from far away. Zuo Mo was slightly surprised. Such thick yin energy would not have naturally formed. He could feel the thick death energy mixed within it.</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t help but ask, \u201cWhat is the history of this place?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSupposedly, during the ancient era, a great battle of over ten tribes occurred here. Countless warriors fell on this place, and their ghosts were difficult to dissipate and turned into spectres and yin fiends. However, that is just a rumor, and there is no evidence,\u201d Kuai An said expressionlessly.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo looked down and murmured to himself, \u201cIt probably isn\u2019t just a rumor.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kuai An\u2019s eyes suddenly lit up.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo did not look at Kuai An. His gaze swept across the Grave Ghost Mound. This place fulfilled all of his needs. It had mountains, water, and there was the smell of sulphur in the air which meant that this place had earth fire. The yin river here had been corroded by the yin energy for a lengthy amount of time and really was a river of yin energy now.</p><br/><p>Speaking just in terms of environment, this place was very suited to setting up the [King\u2019s Forbidden Firmament]. The yin river was an unexpected surprise and could greatly increase the power of the jinzhi.</p><br/><p>But for some reason, Zuo Mo felt a thread of anxiousness.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo shook his head and threw the thread of uncertainly behind him. Even if there was something strange here, it could not compare to the immediate and apparent threat from the experts that would soon arrive.</p><br/><p>Mo Shen Temple, Kun Lun, all the mo marshals, the Yao Council of Elders \u2026 \u2026</p><br/><p>There was no need to count all of them, just these few was enough to rob people of courage.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo did not feel any fear at all. Even though A Gui\u2019s sudden attack had messed up all of his preparations, he felt relieved of a heavy burden. He no longer needed to be careful, did not need to conceal himself. It was as though he had thrown away all of the chains and qualms weighing him down, and he felt unspeakably relaxed.</p><br/><p>Thinking about how he was about to fight against the top experts famed in the world, fighting spirit filled his heart and his body with endless strength.</p><br/><p>To contend against the heroes of the world with just his own power!</p><br/><p>Just thinking about it caused his blood to boil!</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>\u201cSo Elder, you knew that Xiao Yun Hai was Xiao Mo Ge already.\u201d The young mo god had an enchanting smile on his face. He stood there lazily as though he was about to lay down and sleep.</p><br/><p>The old man that was in front of him grinned to show his missing and yellow teeth. \u201cI would never admit that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m really curious, Elder, what is the relationship between you and Xiao Mo Ge? Relatives?\u201d the young mo god asked with a smile.</p><br/><p>The old man shook his head, \u201cYou are wrong, I don\u2019t have a good relation with him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen you are enemies?\u201d the young mo god shook his head. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t appear so!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHa, stop guessing, you won\u2019t be able to get it right,\u201d the old man said unconcernedly.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Scab Fragrance isn\u2019t something normal. While I don\u2019t hope that you will return it to me, but, Elder, you have to give an explanation. Otherwise, it will be a great embarrassment to me.\u201d The young mo god spread his hands.</p><br/><p>The old man grinned and said, \u201cThis old man didn\u2019t break any promise. I said that he was able to force shen devices. While the [Angel Device Raiment] isn\u2019t a true shen device, if you get it and study a bit, you may possibly be able to forge your own shen device.\u201d</p><br/><p>The young mo god sighed and said, \u201cIt seems that we will have to fight today.\u201d</p><br/><p>The old man urged, \u201cWhy? Everyone knows each other\u2019s power. You alone cannot beat me, if there are two of you, then I definitely cannot win. But only if there are three of you would I be unable to escape.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true. It seems that I can only bear the humiliation until they come,\u201d the young mo god tiled his head and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut we will have to fight no matter what.\u201d The old man smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou want me to help you delay. While I am very lazy, what can I do? What I won\u2019t be able to get, I\u2019m displeased that the turtles behind me still aim for them.\u201d The young mo god\u2019s expression was pained.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, yes.\u201d The old man nodded repeatedly with agreement on his face.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlso, you say that I cannot defeat you, I\u2019m also displeased by this!\u201d The young mo god raised his face and looked directly at the old man.</p><br/><p>His shen power rippled. The usual laziness on the handsome face had disappeared and what replaced it was unusual focus. This cased his face to have a light that was eerie and almost something that people could not directly look at. The stone around him seemed to be attracted by an invisible force and slowly floated upwards.</p><br/><p>Boom!</p><br/><p>A strong shen pressure spun around him, and grew stronger as it revolved. It pulled all of the power within dozens of li!</p><br/><p>It was like a twister that reached directly into the sky.</p><br/><p>His smile was still enchanting but unusually sharp.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no way about it. There are many matters in the world that are displeasing,\u201d the old man grinned and said.</p><br/><p>He shook his head and stepped forward.</p><br/><p>His steps were not heavy, but in the moment he stepped onto the ground, boom, a deep rumble like that of a drum sounded. The ground within a hundred li seemed to be stuck, and shook once!</p><br/><p>A spiderweb of cracks spread more than seven li with his right foot as the center.</p><br/><p>The cracks that appeared seemed to reach into the underworld, deep and bottomless.</p><br/><p>The young mo god\u2019s twister shook. The top part of it suddenly lost control, turned into chaotic turbulence and scattered.</p><br/><p>The young mo god\u2019s eyes narrowed slightly. The light that came from his narrowed eyes were sharp as blades.</p><br/><p>A smile spread on his mouth. \u201cThere are many people that have come!\u201d</p><br/><p>The old man sighed. \u201cIt seems that we need to show some actual skill. Otherwise, we aren\u2019t able to intimidate these people.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI dislike doing hard labor.\u201d The young mo gold seemed to say to himself. His eyes lit up with a burning light.</p><br/><p>The gazes of the two collided in the air and sparks flew.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>The strength of the power vibrations produced by the fighting of two shen power experts was like the sun in the dark of the night. Not just the nearby Bu Zhou City, even Zuo Mo a few hundred li away clearly felt it.</p><br/><p>Everyone in Bu Zhou City was startled away.</p><br/><p>In this period of time, the undercurrents and the continuously intensifying conflicts had been detected by many of the locals who left Bu Zhou City long ago.</p><br/><p>Right now, the majority of people in Bu Zhou City were outsiders. The remaining were large families such as the Tang Family who thought they had the ability to protect themselves. But at such a time, the Tang Family were on full guard.</p><br/><p>How could they not have detected such a great ruckus.</p><br/><p>Tang Chen\u2019s face was pale. The vibrations from the collision outside the city made even he, a marshal, feel his heart jump. Beside him was another middle-aged male. Beside the male was Qin Ming, Zhong Wen Tian, and Gongzi Xi who were all standing solemnly. He was Marshal Di who had secretly arrived this night!</p><br/><p>Marshal Di\u2019s expression was grave, \u201cBoth are using shen power.\u201d</p><br/><p>The shock on Qin Ming\u2019s face was difficult to disguise. All of them were marshal experts. Even though they had earth mo weapons, they would have to use their full power to reach such a level.</p><br/><p>Yet the two seemed to be strolling in the park. The power ripples given off as they moved were able to upend an ocean!</p><br/><p>\u201cThe youth is one of the three great mo gods of the Mo Shen Temple, he is called Youxi Ya Ke, the old man\u2019s origins are unknown,\u201d Qin Ming said gravely.</p><br/><p>Marshal Di\u2019s gaze swept across the people. Seeing the expression on their faces and how they were clearly intimidated, he suddenly smield and said, \u201cWen Tian, if you and Old Qin work together, do you have the confidence to fight Youxi Ya Ke?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhong Wen Tian\u2019s eyes lit up as he rumbled, \u201cWe can fight!\u201d</p><br/><p>The other two people\u2019s expressions eased.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d Marshal Di\u2019s voice was strong and powerful, \u201cAdding on Old Tang and I, we have for marshals, and four earth mo weapons. If we count this way, that will be two mo gods. We just have one less than the Mo Shen Temple. In this chaotic situation, we may have a chance!\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone\u2019s confidence increased greatly.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what do we do now?\u201d Tang Chen asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait!\u201d Marshal Di\u2019s expression was at ease. \u201cWe are not the strongest, and the timing of our action is most crucial. We must be successful on our first attempt! Old Tang, investigate and see what really happened when Xiao Yun Hai left the city at night before the shen power expert conflict. We need to keep our eye on Xiao Yun Hai, he\u2019s the crux of this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Chen did not hesitate. He nodded and said, \u201cAlright!\u201d</p><br/><p>Translator Ramblings: Everyone wants to get Zuo Mo. He needs to clone himself. \u201cYour very own Zuo Mo, comes with a ghost, one ancient gravestone and a yao in spirit form. The sword fanatic shixiong, battle maniac shidi, pets, and other accessories are sold separately. \u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

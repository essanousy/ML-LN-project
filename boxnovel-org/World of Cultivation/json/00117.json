It wasn\u2019t until he had reached the mouth of the path that he saw four other disciples .</p><br/><p>However \u2026 \u2026</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo didn\u2019t recognize any of them. What shocked him even more was all four of the disciples were in zhuji, and one of them had an even deeper in cultivation than hedid. Who were these people? Why had they come to the back of the mountain of his sect?</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo was on his guard.</p><br/><p>When the four disciples saw Zuo Mo, they first paused and then bowed simultaneously, calling out, \u201cGreetings to Zuo Shixiong!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Shixiong? Had the sect taken in new disciples recently? Zuo Mo was puzzled but asked without showing a hint of confusion, \u201cEveryone looks unfamiliar. Why did you all enter Wu Kong Sword Sect?\u201d</p><br/><p>The person with the deepest cultivation among the four stepped forward and said respectfully, \u201cWe used to be Wei Sword Sect disciples. Two months ago, we formally entered the sect and have received orders from the sect leader to guard the back mountain.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo\u2019s puzzlement increased upon hearing this. He asked curiously, \u201cIf you were Wei Sword Sect disciples, then why would you consider entering our sect?\u201d</p><br/><p>The four exchanged looks and smiled. The leader explained. \u201cShixiong was in seclusion and may not know the dramatic changes within the sect. Not just Wei Sword Sect, but almost half of the sects around Dong Fu have merged into our sect.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo gaped.</p><br/><p>The four saw Zuo Mo was blanking but didn\u2019t dare disturb him. They might all have nearly the same level of cultivation, but the difference in status was enormous. The sect leader wasn\u2019t known to be someone who was nepotistic, but it was unavoidable that the status of the original Wu Kong Sword Sect disciples would rise with their expansion. Even more, Zuo Mo wasn\u2019t just any Wu Kong Sword Sect disciple; he was one of the core disciples.</p><br/><p>According to the other original Wu Kong Sword Sect disciples, Zuo Mo\u2019s position was even above Luo Li Shixiong. They didn\u2019t dare to offend him. At the Sword Test Conference, Zuo Mo had become very famous. Everyone remembered his trademark zombie face. The four of them had recognized him with nothing more than a glance.</p><br/><p>Only now did they realize that the back of the mountain was Zuo Mo\u2019s place of seclusion. From when they had been ordered to guard this place, they had been curious what was so special about the back of the mountain that the sect leader would send four people to guard it. At regular intervals, Eldest Shijie Li Ying Feng would come, but still nothing was ever mentioned.</p><br/><p>As they stopped speaking, countless sword energies flew in from all over. At the front was Sect Leader Pei Yuan Ran and Shi Feng Rong.</p><br/><p>The light of Zuo Mo coming out of the formation had alarmed all of Wu Kong Mountain.</p><br/><p>When Pei Yuan Ran saw Zuo Mo, his brows imperceptibly creased but resumed normal. At his side, Shi Feng Rong had a happy expression.</p><br/><p>When the four people guarding the back mountain saw Pei Yuan Ran and Shi Feng Rong, they were shocked and hurriedly bowed. The four of them were once again reconsidering the importance of Zuo Mo to the elders.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou finally came out of seclusion. Not bad.\u201d Pei Yuan Ran warmly said, \u201cYour Master has been impatient.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good that you came out!\u201d Shi Feng Rong was extremely fond of this disciple that was full of talent but also a cause for headache. The rims of her eyes turned red.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo\u2019s nose instantly felt sore. He was very moved. He properly bowed, \u201cMaster!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>After talking for a while with Zuo Mo, the sect leader left. There were too many things he had to do. Shi Feng Rong accompanied Zuo Mo back to his Little West Wind Yard.</p><br/><p>Just as they reached the mouth of the valley, a ball of white shadow slammed into Zuo Mo. Caught unaware, Zuo Mo was thrown to the ground. Silly Bird! Silly Bird nudged and snuggled with her head. Zuo Mo scolded, \u201cYou silly bird!\u201d But inside, his heart was warmed.</p><br/><p>The Little West Wind Yard did not seem different than before. There should have been people who came to clean.</p><br/><p>Having perceived Zuo Mo\u2019s befuddlement, Shi Feng Rong said with a slight smile, \u201cAt the beginning, Xiao Guo came to clean every day. After, Xiao Guo was sent to Sky Sound City, so she sent a few outer sect disciples to clean.\u201d</p><br/><p>Thinking about the timid apple-face, Zuo Mo felt a slight sense of loss. He asked, \u201cHow is Xiao Guo\u2019s situation?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shi Feng Rong was clearly very satisfied with her other disciple. \u201cXiao Guo\u2019s talents might not be as high as you guys, but she is extremely hard-working. Adding on that the sect has expanded quickly this half year and has many more resources, she has leveled up quickly. She\u2019s not far from ningmai. The sect leader felt she needed to gain experience so she was sent to manage Sky Moon City.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEldest Shixiong? Luo Li Shixiong?\u201d Zuo Mo couldn\u2019t help but ask.</p><br/><p>Shi Feng Rong said, \u201cYour Eldest Shixiong and Luo Li Shixiong originally started out with your Second Shibo. Afterwards, to increase speed, they all led some of the other disciples and split up. It\u2019s a pity that we didn\u2019t know when you would come out of the formation, otherwise Li Ying Feng definitely would have waited a few more days before leaving. Your Yan Le Shibo needs people so he also called your Li Ying Feng Shijie over.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo\u2019s heart felt even more hollow. Who could have thought that everything had changed after staying in the formation for half a year.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve expanded this much?\u201d Zuo Mo couldn\u2019t help but ask, \u201cThe other sects have not interfered?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not just us that is expanding. This half year, everyone has been expanding.\u201d Worry came onto Shi Feng Rong\u2019s face. \u201cThe situation in Bloody Sky Metropolis Jie is becoming worse. Everyone is worried. In these troubling times, everyone that has the power to expand will expand. Only by consolidating our strength can there be some hope for survival. Sky Moon Jie is not far away from Bloody Sky Metropolis Jie. Everyone is panicking. During such dangerous times, naturally it requires that special measures be used. We cannot be kind and generous. The sect leader is hoping that we can finish organizing before the bad news comes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe situation is this bad?\u201d Zuo Mo was very shocked.</p><br/><p>\u201cEn.\u201d The worry on Shi Feng Rong\u2019s face became even heavier. She hesitated but still spoke. \u201cOriginally, since you came out of the formation, you should rest a while. But the situation is serious so there are some things that I have to say to you. Do not slack off now. The sect is not like it was in the past. We have seven jindan, about thirty ningmai, and more than two hundred zhuji disciples right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo seemed to know what Master wanted to say, but for some unknown reason, he was very calm.</p><br/><p>\u201cOur sect has expanded too quickly. Even though it is out of helplessness, but there are many weaknesses. The sect is not as harmonious as it was before.\u201d Speaking of that, she couldn\u2019t help but sigh. \u201cYou have to work hard, and enter ningmai as early as possible!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis disciple understands.\u201d Zuo Mo knew that Master was looking out for him.</p><br/><p>Shi Feng Rong said a few more things before leaving.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>The sky was dark. Zuo Mo sat on the rooftop, a sound tablet by his side. The noise of the sound tablet was the same. Silly Bird was at the side. She seemed to feel Zuo Mo\u2019s mood and didn\u2019t make noise.</p><br/><p>After entering meditation from before, Pu Yao still hadn\u2019t moved.</p><br/><p>Luckily, there was no change in the sea of flames, no change in the gravestone, and no change in Pu Yao sitting on the gravestone.</p><br/><p>Pu Yao was meditating, Eldest Shixiong, Luo Li Shixiong, Xiao Guo, and the others were not here.</p><br/><p>Sitting on the rooftop, he looked at the sky. The light of flying swords were multiple times more frequent than before, extremely busy. Yet all this prosperity made Zuo Mo feel this place was now very unfamiliar and very cold.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, something pulled the corner of his clothing. Turning around, he found it was Silly Bird.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Silly Bird!\u201d</p><br/><p>Silly Bird flapped down the roof. Hm, Zuo Mo\u2019s eyes landed where Silly Bird was standing.</p><br/><p>Wasn\u2019t that the entrance to the rock room?</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo had always carefully concealed the entrance to the rock room. He had especially set up illusory formations around it. No one had found it. Zuo Mo suddenly felt interested and burrowed into the room.</p><br/><p>Entering, a damp and cold air rushed out.</p><br/><p>Sweeping the stone room, Zuo Mo suddenly had a joyful expression.</p><br/><p>Hm!</p><br/><p>Black gold worm!</p><br/><p>The black gold wom also found Zuo Mo, turning into a streak of black light to land on Zuo Mo\u2019s shoulder. Seeing this little guy, Zuo Mo\u2019s mood lifted as though he was meeting an old friend. He finally remembered that the black gold worm liked to stay on the ling vein inside the stone room. He had long forgotten about it.</p><br/><p>Putting the black gold worm on his palm and inspecting it, Zuo Mo felt even happier. Compared to before, the black gold worm was of a higher grade and more intelligent.</p><br/><p>What had this guy eaten?</p><br/><p>When his eyes landed on the pock-marked ling vein, he understood. It was as he had expected. When he approached the ling vein, he found he could not detect any ling energy. There was a small yet extremely deep hole in the ground. When Zuo Mo tested with his consciousness, he found it was at least several dozen zhang deep. It definitely was due to the black gold worm. The dan that had been nurturing by the ling spring probably also landed in this little guy\u2019s stomach.</p><br/><p>\u201cI really didn\u2019t see that you really have some skill!\u201d Zuo Mo smiled at the black gold worm.</p><br/><p>Taking the black gold worm out of the stone room, Zuo Mo\u2019s mood was much better.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>Wu Kong Hall</p><br/><p>Pei Yuan Ran and Shi Feng Rong were discussing matters.</p><br/><p>Pei Yuan Ran smiled and said, \u201cI just received a flying sword message from Third Shidi. Good news, Heart Lake Sword Sect has agreed to give the Desolate Wood Reef to us.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shi Feng Rong also showed a sliver of joy. \u201cIf that\u2019s the case, that\u2019s great! The Desolate Wood Reef is right beside the jie river to Little Mountain Jie. We now have another escape route, but what did Heart Lake Sword Sect want in return?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey wanted Kui City. I agreed. Kui City isn\u2019t of much use to us. To exchange for Desolate Wood Reef, it\u2019s profitable.\u201d Pei Yuan Ran said decisively.</p><br/><p>Shi Feng Rong nodded in agreement.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m planning to let Zuo Mo go to the Desolate Wood Reef,\u201d Pei Yuan Ran suddenly said.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Shi Feng Rong suddenly stood up, her face angry. \u201cZuo Mo just came out of the formation, and you are sending him to such wilderness. I understand clearly just how barren the Desolate Wood Reef is. We\u2019ve been there before, and I know it. I don\u2019t agree!\u201d</p><br/><p>Pei Yuan Ran rubbed his brow in helplessness, his other hand motioning to Shi Feng Rong. \u201cDon\u2019t be so impatient. Wait for me to finish.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shi Feng Rong snorted coldly, not speaking.</p><br/><p>Pei Yuan Ran really had no methods of dealing with his shimei. \u201cDesolate Wood Reef might be very poor, but Shimei also knows how important it is to us. Otherwise, why would we have needed Third Shidi to personally go to Heart Lake Sword Sect? This kind of important location, I wouldn\u2019t feel safe if it wasn\u2019t on our people\u2019s hands. Wei Sheng and the others have their duties. Tell me, who can I send?\u201d</p><br/><p>Pei Yuan Ran spread his hands, and asked Shi Feng Rong.</p><br/><p>Shi Feng Rong sneered. \u201cDon\u2019t use these righteous excuses. Isn\u2019t it just that you saw that Zuo Mo isn\u2019t in ningmai and his sword essence hasn\u2019t reached Heart Turn Sword Essence? This matter, I definitely won\u2019t agree!\u201d</p><br/><p>Pei Yuan Ran grimaced. \u201cAh, what do you want me to say? Keeping Zuo Mo in the sect, would that be good for him? You also know what the situation is like inside the sect! Do we have the time to protect him? Do you have it? No! I don\u2019t either! Wei Sheng and the others are not here, no one can help him, is that really so good for him?\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing Shi Feng Rong\u2019s face relax, he continued patiently, \u201cDesolate Wood Reef might be out of the way and poor, but it is very safe. It is behind us, therefore it will be on our path for retreat. Zuo Mo going there, he might suffer, but his life will not be in danger. If the situation is really bad and we need to retreat, we will definitely go through Desolate Wood Reef. With our current circumstances, other than ensuring his survival, what more do you want?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shi Feng Rong didn\u2019t say anything. She knew that Sect Leader Shixiong was right.</p><br/><p>After struggling for a while, she raised her head, and gritted her teeth, \u201cOn the matter of resources, we can\u2019t short-change him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d Pei Yuan Ran answered easily.</p><br/><p>Translator Ramblings: Some of you were very accurate in your predictions back during the Sword Test Conference arc. Zuo Mo is being temporarily relocated.</p><br/><p>Also, we have a new editor. Everyone, say hello to Brian!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

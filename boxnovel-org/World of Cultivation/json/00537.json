It was hard for him to accept Zuo Mo\u2019s disappearance.</p><br/><p>He bowed respectfully towards Lan. After the constant worship from the mist people in the last two weeks, Lan\u2019s power was gradually recovering. Lan passed on the long-lost Ice Mist Shen power cultivation method to the mist people, the power of the tribe increased daily. The shadow that had hung over the tribe for tens of thousands of years was swept away. Lan received the sincere reverence of all the mist people.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat question do you have?\u201d Lan\u2019s faint yet authoritative voice sounded in Bing Yao\u2019s mind.</p><br/><p>\u201cLan, what are the restricted lands?\u201d Bing Yao raised his head and asked.</p><br/><p>Lan hadn\u2019t thought that Bing Yao would ask this. He remained silent.</p><br/><p>\u201cEver since we moved here, we have guarded the restricted lands for more than ten thousand years. No one ever knew what the restricted lands are or why we guard it.\u201d Bing Yao\u2019s speaking speed was neither slow nor excited. It was filled with bewilderment.</p><br/><p>A moment later, Lan slowly said, \u201cThe time has not come.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cXuan Kong Temple has already discovered this place. They definitely have a goal or they know something,\u201d Bing Yao said straightforwardly.</p><br/><p>\u201cBecome strong as fast as possible.\u201d Lan\u2019s sigh echoed in the air.</p><br/><p>The surroundings sank into silence. No matter how Bing Yao called out, Lan no longer replied.</p><br/><p>Disappointment flashed through Bing Yao\u2019s eyes but he did not probe more. For him, or rather, for the great majority of the mist people, protecting and disallowing entry to the restricted lands was a tradition they had adhered to for tens of thousands of years. If it wasn\u2019t that Zuo Mo might be stranded in the restricted lands, Bing Yao would not think to question this. Even if Ding Zhen had really entered the restricted lands, they would not have followed.</p><br/><p>All the signs pointed to the fact that the restricted lands held an unknown secret.</p><br/><p>Even something as powerful as Xuan Kong Temple desired this secret. What was inside the restricted lands? In order to become the sect leader Bing Yao had some skill and intelligence. Lan\u2019s words had been sparse but he still managed to deduce a lot of information.</p><br/><p>To enter the restricted lands, they were not strong enough \u2026 \u2026</p><br/><p>Bing Yao\u2019s gaze became determined as he left the altar in silence.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>They advanced day and night.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo dared to swear that he probably would never have another chance in this life where he would walk so far-that wasn\u2019t right- carried so far. A Gui\u2019s body was on the verge of falling apart, but seemed to contain astounding power. One day, one night, four hours rest, she did not know exhaustion.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo was like a chatterbox and continued to talk. In the past, he definitely never would have imagined there would be a day when he spoke so much.</p><br/><p>Lying on A Gui\u2019s back, the bare feet that he had sighed countless times over were trembling and straining with each step. He could clearly feel it. With every step, Zuo Mo\u2019s heart shook. An indescribable feeling spread in his heart to the point he felt he wanted to be silent but he knew that he could not be silent. He kept on telling himself he had to do something.</p><br/><p>Other than these meaningless words, he could not do anything.</p><br/><p>There had never been a time, Zuo Mo had never hoped and wished like this, wished that he could use the shen power that dominated his body to exchange for one thread of ling power. Just one thread of ling power\u2014and he could create a paper crane.</p><br/><p>But there wasn\u2019t one iota.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, A Gui, I\u2019ve found that you are undefeatable, the more you fight, the stronger you get, the more you are wounded, the stronger you get.\u201d Zuo Mo talked in a heartless tone, \u201cHave you been hiding your power in the past? I\u2019ve always found it strange about why you are so good to me. Did you owe me jingshi in the past? Hey, do you really owing me jingshi \u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis ghastly place doesn\u2019t even have any birds pooping here. Did we come to another ancient battlefield? No no no, that was careless of me, I didn\u2019t mean to say that! A Gui, you didn\u2019t hear a thing \u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve walked for twenty days and didn\u2019t even see a stalk of grass, this is so depressing \u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>With only Zuo Mo\u2019s nattering as company, they walked for another ten days.</p><br/><p>When Zuo Mo saw the streak of green on the horizon, Zuo Mo was euphoric.</p><br/><p>\u201cA Gui A Gui! Look! Look! There, there! Oh, Heavens, hahahaha, we\u2019re saved! We\u2019re saved! A Gui! Can you see? Can you see?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo was extremely excited and his exhales blew up A Gui\u2019s hair.</p><br/><p>A Gui did not respond and walked forward.</p><br/><p>\u201cA Gui, you are a genius! Oh oh oh ! A great genius! Such a great distance and you could find the direction, you are really a genius! Hahahaha, we need to find someone and then heal. Once I recover, I will take you to find a water cloud embryo again, I will \u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are too excited.\u201d</p><br/><p>A rough voice came from behind him.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo\u2019s voice abruptly halted and his heart shook. The inside of his body was a mess to the point that he didn\u2019t even detect someone was so close to him! He was unable to turn his neck and could not see the person behind him.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m very sorry, my body is unwell and I cannot turn my head.\u201d Zuo Mo tried to keep his tone normal.</p><br/><p>\u201cEn?\u201d The other was slightly surprised. A figure flashed in front of Zuo Mo that said with astonishment, \u201cSo sickly! I pity you, little girl, you don\u2019t have it easy!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo finally saw the other\u2019s appearance.</p><br/><p>The other was of large stature and about twice Zuo Mo\u2019s height. His skin was a sandy yellow, and a pair of faintly red eyes were sharp. Zuo Mo\u2019s gaze landed on the other\u2019s arm. From his wrist to the elbow, it was wrapped in a layer of brown scales.</p><br/><p>Mo!</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo was so shocked he almost shouted. Had he come to a mo territory?</p><br/><p>\u201cHe is a lizard mo.\u201d In the sea of consciousness, Wei destroyed Zuo Mo\u2019s last hopes. However, Wei\u2019s tone held a thread of excitement. \u201cOh, faintly red eyes, he probably has the blood of flame lizards.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLizard mo Big Brother, good day!\u201d Zuo Mo wanted to put a smile on his face but his face was paralyzed.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph, silvery tongued boy, you don\u2019t look like a good person.\u201d The wariness in the eyes of the lizard mo dissipated. The two in front of him didn\u2019t look like a threat at all. His brow suddenly creased. \u201cWhere did you come from?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe direction we came from.\u201d Zuo Mo\u2019s tone was joyful. \u201cWe walked more than thirty days, I almost went crazy!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThirty days?\u201d A hint of suspicion flashed across the eyes of Uncle Lizard Mo. \u201cYou mean you two passed through the Shattered Stone Desert?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShattered Stone Desert?\u201d I don\u2019t know. We were exploring some ruins and might have accidentally activated something. As a result, we were transported to this damned place.\u201d Zuo Mo found an explanation that seemed extremely reasonable. His paralyzed face was the best disguise.</p><br/><p>The last hint of suspicion in the eyes of Uncle Lizard Mo left and he said with a snort, \u201cYou look half-dead, and you explore ruins. You are very lucky to not have died in the Gobi Desert.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo\u2019s heart eased slightly. This Uncle Lizard Mo\u2019s tone was bold but he could hear the friendliness.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go, I\u2019ll count this as doing an act of kindness.\u201d Uncle Lizard Mo glanced at A Gui and complimented, \u201cYou, Boy, are really fortunate!\u201d</p><br/><p>Finishing, he walked at the front.</p><br/><p>A Gui seemed to understand and walked behind Uncle Lizard Mo.</p><br/><p>\u201cUncle, what is this place?\u201d Zuo Mo asked familiarly. Anyone that had talked to themselves for thirty days couldn\u2019t help but be enthusiastic.</p><br/><p>\u201cShattered Stone Town,\u201d Uncle Lizard Mo replied without turning his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cShattered Stone Town \u2026 \u2026 uh, what jie does this belong to?\u201d Zuo Mo asked in puzzlement.</p><br/><p>\u201cShattered Stone Jie.\u201d Uncle Lizard Mo did not turn his head.</p><br/><p>In the sea of consciousness.</p><br/><p>\u201cWei, you were among the mo before. Do you know where Shattered Stone Jie is?\u201d Zuo Mo asked Wei, full of anticipation.</p><br/><p>Wei coughed and said, \u201cYou know, my masters are usually mo of high status and were nobility, this kind of small place \u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHahahaha!\u201d Pu Yao\u2019s laugh echoed in the sea of consciousness.</p><br/><p>We\u2019s skin was clearly thicker than the average as he looked at Zuo Mo with composure.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo had lost control of his body but this did not affect his ability to make expressions in the sea of consciousness.</p><br/><p>\u2013Disdain!</p><br/><p>Yes, it was disdain, disdain as he looked down, deep disdain!</p><br/><p>Pu Yao laughed even more freely as the red-black yao fire danced.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou two, one of you boasts every day you are a sky yao, arrogant and domineering, one of you acts like a seer, ask me! Ask me! Ask me! You don\u2019t even know where Shattered Stone Jie is, how can you not know the answer to such a simple question?\u201d Old and new grievances combining, Zuo Mo pointed at the pair and swore, \u201cI should have seen the truth about you both a long time ago! One used a stupid bead in the past and preyed on my youth and inexperience, telling me how much jingshi I can make with it, but I didn\u2019t get any jingshi at all! Now the other comes in. Not even speaking of the rent, you always talk about that oath and that noble status. Ha, a person that doesn\u2019t even know Shattered Stone Jie has the qualifications to talk about status?\u201d</p><br/><p>Pu Yao\u2019s laugh stopped. Wei\u2019s smile froze on his face. Even the yao fire stopped pulsing.</p><br/><p>After he finished scolding, Zuo Mo instantly felt much better. With a snort, he left the sea of consciousness.</p><br/><p>Uncle Lizard Mo was not very powerful and did not cultivate a mo physique. However, his body was strong and he strode forward. He noticed that it took A Gui great effort to walk and stopped. \u201cHey, Little Girl, let me carry him!\u201d</p><br/><p>A Gui did not seem to hear him and continued to walk forward.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo hurriedly apologized to Uncle Lizard Mo, \u201cUncle, sorry, she cannot hear.\u201d</p><br/><p>Uncle Lizard Mo\u2019s gaze instantly gentled greatly. He seemed to think of something and was slightly inattentive but he quickly raised his head. He walked together with A Gui and snorted, \u201cYou two, one sick and the other crippled. You don\u2019t stay at home but come out to run around, you don\u2019t want to live, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo could only smile weakly. He didn\u2019t know how to respond.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou guys, fine, you won\u2019t listen even if I talk.\u201d Uncle Lizard Mo shook his head and then said, \u201cYou can first stay at my place. Since I live alone, the space isn\u2019t used.\u201d</p><br/><p>Finishing, he didn\u2019t listen to Zuo Mo\u2019s words of gratefulness and walked forward.</p><br/><p>When they reached Shattered Stone Town, Zuo Mo saw some other mo. It could be seen that these mo were respectful towards Uncle Lizard Mo, and their gazes were full of curiosity as they looked at A Gui and Zuo Mo. However, several female mo looked at Zuo Mo with disdain and unfriendliness.</p><br/><p>Contrary to what Zuo Mo had imagined, not all of these mo were lizard mo or one type of mo. This seemed to be a place where all kinds of mo lived together.</p><br/><p>Shattered Stone Jie, Shattered Stone Town \u2026 \u2026 where was this \u2026 \u2026 ge was going to shatter soon \u2026 \u2026.</p><br/><p>Translator Ramblings: Zuo Mo, it\u2019s not those two\u2019s fault that you weren\u2019t strong enough to defeat Ding Zhen and escape away untouched. Little bit of undeserved blame there.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Zuo Mo\u2019s my favorite character but this one is right after. Luck is really important on the road to cultivation. Zuo Mo has terrible luck\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>I have a hard time translating . I\u2019ve used both abnormal and perverse. Any suggestions?</p><br/><p>Chapter Seventeen Pu[1]</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo slowly woke up. His head was still aching, but compared to the pain that had cut through his entire body, it was much less.</p><br/><p>Thinking of what had happened before he went unconscious, his face suddenly changed.</p><br/><p>He always had been one with a clear mind. Under the situation where his head was aware and he could think clearly, he quickly organized the cause and result. Without any great need to think, it was definitely that black dandelion seed that was the culprit.</p><br/><p>The one that released the sword essence was him. And the one that pressured him was also that one.</p><br/><p>Thinking about it, Zuo Mo\u2019s heart burned in anger.</p><br/><p>That guy tried to play tricks on his head, he didn\u2019t know what he was getting into!</p><br/><p>He suddenly thought that he had said something before he went unconscious, and his face changed. Was it that he didn\u2019t persevere and had capitulated?</p><br/><p>Thinking about this, he quickly calmed his mind and entered his consciousness.</p><br/><p>When he enters the sea, he was stupefied.</p><br/><p>On the undulating hills, it was groups of large ancient trees. The green grass was like a carpet, spreading out in patches. Fine wild flowers mixed within the grass, adding hints of life.</p><br/><p>It was as though he walked into a forest.</p><br/><p>Before, his sea of consciousness was only empty space. This living and breathing scene in front of him\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo was completely pinned to the ground. The scene in front of his eye far surpassed the limits of his understanding.</p><br/><p>He dazedly walked on the grass, feeling the softness of the grass under his feet. The smell of the green grass wafted into his nose. Zuo Mo was dazed. He was only an eighth level lianqi low-level xiuzhe.</p><br/><p>When his gaze turned towards a hill without any trees, he instantly came back.</p><br/><p>He started to run like a maniac towards that hill.</p><br/><p>On the hill, a man dressed in black was sitting on a stele, black clouds moving around it. One hand was lying on the leg, another propped up his chin, his expression carefree and pleased.</p><br/><p>When he neared, Zuo Mo finally made out the black-clad man\u2019s appearance.</p><br/><p>A perfect face!</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo had never though men could be so handsome. An androgynous face, a high nose, the raven back hair covering up the left eye, the right eye as narrow and long as a blade, the serene crimson red pupil was like a bottomless blood pool, the thin and wide lips eternally held a shallow yet strange curve. A piece of dark red rhombus shaped crystals were in each earlobe, the wide black clothing soft and smooth, just like his hair, it gave off a black glow as it kept close to his body, full of a strange enticement.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo blanked at his position, not knowing what to say. He was only the most normal disciple of a small sect. When had he ever seen someone so outstanding?</p><br/><p>\u201cI am called Pu.\u201d A sweet-sounding and beautiful voice. He propped up his chin, looking in interest at Zuo Mo, the curve of his mouth more evident: \u201cWhat are you called?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cZuo Mo.\u201d He replied dumbly. He definitely was dreaming. Pu seemed to be just sitting there but all the light in the sea of consciousness seemed to have been unconsciously sucked away to him. Zuo Mo had seen those female disciples at the Eastern Peak. Not one of them was better looking than Pu.</p><br/><p>When a man looked like this, he probably would want to cry.</p><br/><p>When this thought came out, Zuo Mo came back to awareness. Pu\u2019s enticing and shocking aura was instantly shattered by this humorous thought.</p><br/><p>Seeming to have noticed Zuo Mo returning to his senses, Pu smiled gently, and wasn\u2019t irritated. He still used his melodious voice: \u201cIt seems we will have to be in contact for a long time. But I believe we will have delightful interactions. Oh, right, this is for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Pu casually threw a glowing ball at Zuo Mo. On the surface of the ball, countless seals flashed.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Zuo Mo instinctively received the glowing ball.</p><br/><p>Boom.</p><br/><p>It was as though he was struck by thunder, his body frozen. Countless characters were shoved into him mind, circulating relentlessly.</p><br/><p>\u201c[Embryonic Breathing Spirit Cultivation], just a little plaything. It can repair your spirit, count that as a greeting gift.\u201d Pu\u2019s tone was lazy: \u201cEven though I want to live for free, but there\u2019s no other way. Your sea of consciousness is so broken. Fix the sea of consciousness quickly, otherwise I have to find another place again.\u201d</p><br/><p>He gracefully waved his hand. Zuo Mo, still unmoving at his spot, felt the space around his body tighten. When he opened his eyes, he found that he had come out of his sea of consciousness.</p><br/><p>His heart was suddenly terrified. Pu seemed to be even stronger than he had imagined. A person like this that he couldn\u2019t control in his consciousness, no wait, controlling his sea of consciousness! He had no joy at receiving [Embryonic breathing Spirit Cultivation]. Terror spread through his body like poison.</p><br/><p>Managing to swallow his saliva and suppressing the terror in his heart, he pondered what to do.</p><br/><p>Report to the sect?</p><br/><p>In these two years, he had only seen the head of the sect once. That was when he had been picked by the leader and when he opened his eyes. As to the other elders and shishu, he had never even met them.</p><br/><p>What he was really worried about was another conjecture.</p><br/><p>He was very suspicious, Pu was very likely to be a yaomo!</p><br/><p>Such a beautiful yaomo, he almost couldn\u2019t believe it, but for some reason, this suspicion was like a maggot burrowing into the bones, taking root in his mind, unable to be swept away.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo had never seen yaomo, all his ideas about yaomo came from the sound tablet. When it mentioned yaomo, it was killing, it was death and bleeding. But the between yaomo and xiuzhe were that of natural enemies, he was very clear about that. Destroying yaomo was the duty of each xiuzhe, no matter where.</p><br/><p>However, Zuo Mo was a beginner xiuzhe whose cultivation just reached the eighth level of lianqi. Not speaking of destroying yaomo, the yaomo wouldn\u2019t even lower themselves to destroying him.</p><br/><p>What he was more worried about was that if someone else knew that a yaomo was in his body, he definitely would be destroyed, ground until not a trace could be found. In the eyes of those higher level xiuzhe, just an eighth level lianqi like him, he couldn\u2019t even be considered cannon fodder.</p><br/><p>Maybe, they would throw him straight into the dan[2] furnace and get refined with the yaomo\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t help but shudder, his heart beating furiously. He quickly stopped those terrifying thoughts.</p><br/><p>In a daze, for the next two days, Zuo Mo seemed to not be in this mortal coil.</p><br/><p>He naturally had to practise [Embryonic Breathing Spiritual Cultivation]. Otherwise, before he could be crippled by Pu Yao, he would cripple himself first. Pu Yao, that was the new name Zuo Mo gave Pu. Regardless if he was a yao, just how he looked, he deserved the character of yao.</p><br/><p>The effects were very good. After a few days, half of his spirit had recovered. But Zuo Mo felt no gratefulness towards Pu Yao. Because he finally remembered, the reason that his consciousness was wounded, it was Pu Yao\u2019s fault.</p><br/><p>In these few days, he didn\u2019t go to his sea of consciousness.</p><br/><p>If it was said at the first glance, the deepest impression Pu Yao left on Zuo Mo was enchanting, now, enchanting changed to wicked!</p><br/><p>What did the guy really want?</p><br/><p>That was the true cause of the terror.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo quickly found that his life became incomparably terrible. To a xiuzhe whose goal was to become a ling plant farmer, living was the most important.</p><br/><p>He decided to have a discussion with Pu Yao.</p><br/><p>Just like last time, Pu Yao sat on the stele idly, in the same black clothing. Seeing Zuo Mo he smiled. That smile coming among the thick black smoke revolving around, it made him look full of evil. The conjecture about whether or not Pu was yaomo jumped out again of its own accord.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo\u2019s heart shook. He didn\u2019t lack in courage, but when the other was in complete control, he wouldn\u2019t do such a stupid thing as to express bravery. He suddenly noticed the stone stele under Pu\u2019s body. Half a person high, the stone stele was shrouded in black clouds. When he accidentally swept across the surface of the stone stele, he couldn\u2019t help but be shocked.</p><br/><p>Grave!</p><br/><p>This was a grave!</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t a stone stele, it was a gravestone!</p><br/><p>He instantly was frightened, his heartbeat speeding up.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Wanted to find me for a chat?\u201d A lazy voice. He didn\u2019t know if it was this gravestone at fault but Zuo Mo felt that Pu\u2019s voice was full of a kind of dark coldness that easily seeped into one\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo calmed his emotions, a fawning smile on his face: \u201cDa ge,[3] look, my cultivation is this weak, and my body is all bones, there isn\u2019t a few catties of meat, not good to eat.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEat?\u201d Pu suddenly smiled. He opened his dark red right eye, slowly speaking: \u201cSpeaking of delicious human meat, oh, that\u2019s so long ago. The best human meat, there\u2019s a lot to consider. The best is sixteen or seventeen year old girls. Tender meat, crunchy bones. Yum, yum.\u201d</p><br/><p>A scarlet tongue licked the lips, his expression full of reflection.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo\u2019s heart was beating out of his chest. He forced a smile: \u201cYeah, yeah, see, shouldn\u2019t you change a person?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cChange a person?\u201d Pu tilted his head, staring at Zuo Mo: \u201cWhat? You don\u2019t like it? Feeling that I took over your space?\u201d</p><br/><p>Being pierced by Pu\u2019s deep red right eyes, cold spread through Zuo Mo\u2019s heart. He hurriedly waved his hand: \u201cNo, no! This is my honor! Honor!\u201d</p><br/><p>He seemed to be very satisfied with Zuo Mo\u2019s answer. Pu took away his gaze, his right eye closing again, his mouth absent-mindedly asking: \u201cIn your generation of disciples, how many are jindan? Ten?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cEight?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo continued to shake his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cFive?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo finally couldn\u2019t endure it. He felt the other was making fun of him: \u201cNot a single one. In the shixiong of this generation, the highest cultivation is the last stages of zhuji.\u201d</p><br/><p>For the first time, a shocked expression came onto Pu\u2019s face with his closed right eye. This made Zuo Mo feel smug.</p><br/><p>After a while, Pu shook his head, sighing: \u201cNo wonder you suck so much.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo almost spat blood.</p><br/><p>Pu opened his eye, his gaze once again landing on Zuo Mo\u2019s body. He examined up and down, his hand propping up his chin, murmuring to himself: \u201cThe body is really weak. Hmm?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo was very irritated at how the other was discussing him like he was examining an object, but Pu\u2019s \u201chmm\u201d made his heart jump.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs something wrong?\u201d He couldn\u2019t ask hurriedly. He knew his body wasn\u2019t normal. The hard zombie-face, and that dream that appeared countless times, it was like a thorn in his heart.</p><br/><p>Pu lifted his head, the hair in front of his forehead almost covering the left half of his face. The crimson right eye that wasn\u2019t covered glanced at Zuo Mo\u2019s face, one corner of his mouth lifting: \u201cNo problem.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, you suck very much, but not to a terminal point.\u201d Pu returned back to his lazy tone of voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cI wanted to ask\u2026 \u2026\u201d Zuo Mo decided to lay his cards on the table with Pu. He wanted to find out what Pu\u2019s true aims were.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, right.\u201d Pu interrupted Zuo Mo. His blood-red right eye narrowed, his thin lips lifting upward on an angle: \u201cStarted practising [Embryonic Breathing Spiritual Cultivation. How is it, is the effects alright? Almost forgot to tell you, [Embryonic Breathing Spiritual Cultivation is good, but it has one pesky problem.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo\u2019s heart beat frantically. He had a bad feeling.</p><br/><p>\u201cOnce [Embryonic Breathing Spiritual Cultivation] is started, it can\u2019t be stopped. Supposedly, if one can\u2019t get to the first embryonic breath in three months, there would be some minor problems.\u201d</p><br/><p>He raised his right hand, spreading his five fingers, the corner of his mouth raising higher, the fresh red of his eye even brighter: \u201cReally, it\u2019s just small pains such as blood flowing in reverse. Oh, did you know, before I had a very creative friend. He was in charge of the torture prisons.\u201d</p><br/><p>Pu seemed to be telling a story, actively narrating.</p><br/><p>\u201cOne time, he encountered a very hard nut. He tried everything but couldn\u2019t break open this guy\u2019s mouth. He then begged for this method from me. He sent a subordinate to pretend to be a criminal and near this guy. And then, using his subordinate\u2019s mouth, he passed this scripture over to him. Oh, you have to know, I always admired this guy. Creative, and patient.\u201d</p><br/><p>He said with a few hints of glee: \u201cSuch a pity that this criminal didn\u2019t have much talent. Three months, he didn\u2019t reach one embryonic breath. Oh, I always felt, it must have been that my friend purposefully left out a few words.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd then?\u201d Zuo Mo asked, his voice shaking.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd then?\u201d The smile on Pu\u2019s face became even brighter: \u201cCracked on the thirty-first day. But my friend was a soft-hearted one and didn\u2019t kill him. Left him hanging for three months. Each day, he begged my friend to kill him. Listening to the exquisite and mellow wailing, such an experience! Supposedly, when he died, oh, his soul just exploded like a firework, extremely beautiful.\u201d</p><br/><p>A bone-aching cold spread over Zuo Mo\u2019s entire body.</p><br/><p>His pitiful nerves were like a spring that was pushed to its limits. All the accumulated anger exploded in one instant. He lost his rationality and screamed as he leapt at Pu.</p><br/><p>\u2013\u2013\u201cYou perverse renyao![4] Ye\u2019ll kill you!\u201d</p><br/><p>[1] It is pronounced a bit like \u201cpoo\u201d. The character used is the same one that is usually used for dandelion.</p><br/><p>[2] : pill, pellet. Common used as \u201cpills of immortality\u201d by Chinese emperors in search of eternal life. A gaming equivalent would be potions.</p><br/><p>[3]: big brother</p><br/><p>[4] : Hong Kong slang for Thailand transvestites. It was then adopted as internet slang for males that used female avatars in MMORPGs. It\u2019s also used to describe \u201cgirliness\u201d in boys. The literal meaning is human-spirit. In this case here, Pu is really a yao, and he does look androgynous.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

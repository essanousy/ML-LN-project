There were mo who continuously fearlessly charged in suicide attacks but in facing a completed battle formation, they were like moths charging into a fire.</p><br/><p>Jiang Zhe hadn\u2019t expected the fighting to be so violent. Even if he was used to great spectacles, he was still shocked at this sight. He couldn\u2019t help but feel a thread of respect towards those crazed mo. Without any doubt, this was an outstanding battalion!</p><br/><p>The respect did not cause Jiang Zhe to be soft-hearted. He spoke softly as he commanded, \u201cCentral formation, feign a withdraw. Flanks, charge forward in a cross.\u201d</p><br/><p>The mo discovered that the enemy in front of them had suddenly retreated. They were instantly overjoyed. Was the other unable to withstand their charge any longer? At this time, a battalion suddenly charged in front of the right flank with lightning speed!</p><br/><p>The mo who had just relaxed mentally were stunned by the fierce charge. Like a knife through butter, this battalion charged through their ranks.</p><br/><p>The formation of the mo was cleaved apart!</p><br/><p>The morale that had just rose up instantly sank. What no one noticed was that another battalion had snuck behind their rear.</p><br/><p>The panicked mo were almost pierced through in an instant by the second charge.</p><br/><p>From the sky, the two battalions cut a perfect cross through the mo.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey are finished.\u201d The woman next to Jiang Zhe stretched lazily as her voluptuous and mature body drew out an attractive curve with this motion. Several of the personal guards around them swallowed. Facing such a person, even dhyana xiu would not be unaffected.</p><br/><p>Jiang Zhe was silent, his long and snowy-white hair blown into the air by the wind. His brow was slender and warm, his body tall, and upright like jade, standing in the air above the fighting. He would always unconsciously attract everyone\u2019s gaze, especially his calm and deep eyes, clear without any impurity. Any person that met his stare would be unconsciously attracted.</p><br/><p>As one of the most accomplished representatives of Xuan Kong Temple\u2019s present generation , no matter where he went, he would attract stares. In Xuan Kong Realm, his reputation and fame surpassed even those great dhyana xiu that had been famed for many years. In the minds of young dhyana xiu, the name Jiang Zhe seemed to hold a magical power.</p><br/><p>In Xuan Kong Realm, there was only one person that could rival him, his Shixiong, Nangong Qing Lian.</p><br/><p>Unlike Jiang Zhe who was a battle general, Nangong Qin Lian was a pure dhyana xiu. One literary and one martial, but both were outstanding.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs there any news of Bie Han?\u201d Jiang Zhe stared off into the distance, his thoughts unknown.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot yet. What is it? You miss him?\u201d The female raised an eyebrow with a teasing expression on her face. This beautiful and moving woman was Jiang Zhe\u2019s Shijie, Feng Yue, and also his second-in-command.</p><br/><p>There was a mole at the corner of Feng Yue\u2019s mouth. It did not detract from her beauty and against the contrast of her bright red lips, it was extremely seductive.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m thinking if it is Bie Han leading the other side \u2026 \u2026\u201d Jiang Zhe was not affected by Feng Yue at all and said lightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t do it? Or you are worried you would lose?\u201d Feng Yue said heartlessly, \u201cDid you guys in the past, en-hm, have some special feelings?\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Yue specially emphasized \u201cspecial.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Zhe was used to Feng Yue Shixiong\u2019s teasing style since a long time ago. He wasn\u2019t angry and then he smiled slightly. \u201cNow that you say this, I\u2019m feeling anticipation about fighting against him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI just don\u2019t know why the sect leader had taken him in. I didn\u2019t like him, since the first time I met him. His eyes are too vicious, like a wild beast.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about Cloud Sea Jie?\u201d Jiang Zhe deflected the topic.</p><br/><p>\u201cHa, Ding Zhen Shishu\u2019s status in the temple isn\u2019t high enough, he died for nothing. Hmph, if those other shishu died, would the temple be as indifferent to the situation as they are now?\u201d Feng Yue\u2019s brow scrunched as an angry expression rose on her face and her tone became less courteous.</p><br/><p>Jiang Zhe coughed lightly. \u201cOriginally, Bie Han had been sent to deal with it, but now that Bie Han has betrayed us, and the situation is so chaotic, the temple \u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to defend those old people. Let\u2019s put the ugly stuff first. If you are going to become like them in the future, this sis will go play by herself then.\u201d Feng Yue raised an eyebrow, her tone filled with nonchalance.</p><br/><p>Jiang Zhe gave a grimace. He didn\u2019t know what to do with Feng Yue Shijie.</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter your defensive line stabilizes, I will go take revenge for Ding Zheng Shishu! If you won\u2019t go, I will!\u201d Feng Yue suddenly said.</p><br/><p>Jiang Zhe who had appeared calm until now suddenly had a dark expression. \u201cNonsense!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDing Zhen Shishu had mentored me in the past. I have to repay him,\u201d Feng Yue said serenely.</p><br/><p>Jiang Zhe sighed as well and became silent.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>Ka Zhuo looked with intoxication at the matrix awakening needle in his hand. He continuously caressed it and couldn\u2019t stop touching it.</p><br/><p>The new matrix awakening needle was completely black and the blood red mo matrix spread over its surface like a spider-web and glimmered eerily.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, alright, stop looking.\u201d Zuo Mo understood Ka Zhuo\u2019s feelings but after Ka Zhuo had laughed dumbly like this for a whole morning, he finally could not bear it any longer.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes yes yes, Teacher.\u201d Ka Zhuo seemed to wake up and carefully put away the matrix awakening needle.</p><br/><p>Uncle An Ya was unable to believe that Zup Mo had suddenly became Ka Zhuo\u2019s teacher but after listening to Zuo Mo\u2019s speech about geniuses Uncle An Ya had been mentally spun round and round, he managed to believe it.</p><br/><p>However, the side effect of this was that Dong Zi and the others did not dare to treat Zuo Mo like they used to. In front of Zuo Mo, they became constrained and careful. They had to maintain their respect towards the matrix awakening masters. Every youth had been told this repeatedly.</p><br/><p>And no one else laughed at A Gui carrying Zuo Mo in a princess carry. People suddenly realized, no wonder A Zuo was so strong, he wasn\u2019t a normal mo.</p><br/><p>In order to make his matrix awakening master identity more plausible, Zuo Mo started to study the topic of matrix awakening masters seriously. Zuo Mo was skilled in mo matrixes, forging, and seal formations. He managed to understand the craft without expending great effort.</p><br/><p>Awakening matrixes was not content of a profound level, and for Zuo Mo, a freak who had seen many high level mo matrixes, if he understood, his understanding of matrix awakening far surpassed the great majority of matrix awakening masters.</p><br/><p>Ka Zhuo was filled with respect. The more he was in contact with Teacher, the more he discovered just how vast his Teacher\u2019s knowledge was.</p><br/><p>This caused Ka Zhuo to faithfully do whatever Zuo Mo instructed.</p><br/><p>Having a matrix awakening needle again, Ka Zhuo could awaken Dong Zi\u2019s matrix.</p><br/><p>Dong Zi who had waited for a long time was very excited and ran over instantly. The matrix awakening had attracted large numbers of Shattered Stone Town residents. Dong Zi was the most talented youth in this group and most people hoped that Shattered Stone Town could produce a true expert.</p><br/><p>Ka Zhuo made a detailed examination of Dong Zi. Everyone stopped breathing in fear of disturbing Ka Zhuo.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo was lying in A Gui\u2019s arms and saw the entire process. He understood.</p><br/><p>Ka Zhuo was going to start awakening the matrix when Zuo Mo suddenly spoke, \u201cWait.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ka Zhuo instantly stopped moving and respectfully came next to Zuo Mo to ask, \u201cTeacher, what orders do you have?\u201d</p><br/><p>The mo that were watching in the surroundings shifted slightly.</p><br/><p>Even though they had accepted the reality that Zuo Mo had become Ka Zhuo\u2019s teacher, when Ka Zhuo called him this in public, it was still caused a strong reaction. Zuo Mo\u2019s age was about the same as Dong Zi and the other\u2019s, yet this youth had become Ka Zhuo\u2019s teacher. Ka Zhou did not reside in Shattered Stone Town but he was famed in Shattered Stone Town.</p><br/><p>Dong Zi\u2019s talent was really pretty good. According to Wei\u2019s observations, Dong Zi should have Alpine Gorilla Blood. Pure Alpine Gorillas were natural warriors with great strength, speed, and bravery.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo had watched Ka Zhou\u2019s inspection. He had confirmed that there were remnants of Alpine Gorilla matrix on Dong Zi\u2019s body and Wei\u2019s guess was proven.</p><br/><p>When Zuo Mo had been studying the profession of a matrix awakening master, he found in the last few days that matrix awakening was similar to the matrixes that he had engraved on Lei Peng and the others. However, the mo were skilled in physical power so they used mo matrixes while xiuzhe used ling power so they used seal formations.</p><br/><p>After confirming that Dong Zi had remnants of an Alpine Gorilla matrix on his body, Zuo Mo had a daring idea\u2014could he complete Dong Zi\u2019s Alpine Gorilla matrix?</p><br/><p>Matrix awakening masters could awaken the mo matrix but that was only bringing out the hidden mo matrix. It was only a minor adjustment and did not repair the mo matrix.</p><br/><p>However, to Zuo Mo who had engraved formations before, this idea was daring but was rational.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo was not completely confident and he decided to let Dong Zi make the final decision.</p><br/><p>Calling Dong Zi, his parents, Uncle An Ya into the room, Zuo Mo told them his thoughts.</p><br/><p>Everyone was stunned. When they heard that Dong Zi had the bloodline of the Alpine Gorilla mo, their faces became disbelieving. Zuo Mo noticed that Dong Zi\u2019s gaze showed yearning and excitement.</p><br/><p>Ka Zhuo felt that his mind could not fully grasp the concept. Repair the mo matrix? Ka Zhuo gaped. A long time later, he recovered and his expression suddenly became excited. Having been a matrix awakening master for a long time, Ka Zhuo knew what it mean if this daring idea could be realized.</p><br/><p>\u201cA Zuo, you cannot joke about this,\u201d Uncle An Ya\u2019s tone was grave, \u201chow confident are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThree tenths,\u201d Zuo Mo replied with a conservative guess. After having told them this, he realized the risk and felt regret. He hoped that no harm would befall Dong Zi. In this period of time, Dong Zi had been very good to him.</p><br/><p>Dong Zi and his parents started discussing in low voices. They quickly made the decision.</p><br/><p>Dong Zi inhaled deeply. \u201cA Zuo, I am willing to try this!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is very dangerous, your chance of death is very high,\u201d Zuo Mo who now deeply regretted bring this up had started to urge him to reconsider.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not afraid!\u201d Dong Zi said boldly, \u201cI want to become more powerful, this way, we won\u2019t be bullied.\u201d</p><br/><p>At this time, Dong Zi\u2019s father also spoke. He said respectfully, \u201cMister Zuo, please give Dong Zi this chance! Our family, our Shattered Stone Town needs this chance.\u201d</p><br/><p>Uncle An Ya sighed deeply and then suddenly looked much older.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo knew that there probably was something going on. He saw that they were extremely resolute and even Uncle An Ya didn\u2019t object so after some thought, he agreed, \u201cAlright! But I need several days to prepare.\u201d</p><br/><p>Including Zuo Mo, no one had considered what kind of legend their decision would create!</p><br/><p>Translator Ramblings: Ding Zhen\u2019s incident isn\u2019t settled yet.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

She was staring at the hoop of light that was like a sun above the island.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Miss.\u201d He opened his mouth, but perceptively swallowed his words.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh.\u201d The female said faintly, \u201cCheck first if there is any suspicious targets among them. If not, push them out.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d The middle-aged man instantly complied.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou really are kind.\u201d A male beside the female said in a sarcastic tone. He was like a crane among the chickens, his entire person like a burning flame, a flame red crystal on his forehead.</p><br/><p>Sweeping a glance at the rebellious male, the female was calm. \u201cYan Feng, shut your mouth.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Feng smirked. \u201cThe xiuzhe on this island are just rabble. Give me five hundred troops, and I can sweep them clean! If you let them go, isn\u2019t it letting them off easy?\u201d</p><br/><p>The female was not moved. \u201cOur job is to find someone.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Feng suddenly became excited, \u201cMu Xi, you forget that they are xiuzhe! Our enemy! The more we kill, the less enemies we have \u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Mu Xi\u2019s tone became cold, \u201cSir Yan Feng, please watch your tone. You are speaking to your direct commander. If you overstep again, you will be treated according to military law!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Feng was so angry fire came out of his eyes. The last bit of intelligence allowed him to keep his control. He knew the woman in front of him would do as she said.</p><br/><p>The composition of yao was extremely complex. There were many species. Different than the reproduction of humans, yao were born from nature, formed from the ling energy of the world. Like Mu Xi, she came from the largest clan of yao, the Wood Clan. They were all formed from flora. Yan Feng, came out of Desolate Western Mountain Sky Fire branch. The reproduction of the Fire Clan was not as prosperous of the Wood Clan. They did not have many yao but they were natural fighters, their personality explosive and brave.</p><br/><p>The Wood, Fire, Gold, Water, and Earth Clans were the five largest clans of the yao, but there were other little clans as many as sand. Due to the abundance of yao, every decade, some small clans would be born. Due to this, yao society was very accepting and very transparent.</p><br/><p>This type of transparent and complete government was like an enormous squid that reached its tentacles into every corner. It was also this governance that had borne from countless great minds and strong elders that allowed the yao to quickly recover.</p><br/><p>For example, Mu Xi was the most accomplished of the youths of the Wood Clan. Even though her cultivation was not outstanding, but she had started her duties very early. Yan Feng rarely found an opponent that could match his offensive power and was even stronger than Mu Xi, but due to his infighting within the ranks, he was punished and placed under Mu Xi\u2019s command.</p><br/><p>In reality, the two once had been classmates, but they had always been at odds.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo found he actually wasn\u2019t nervous. He was slightly surprised. It seemed that fighting and killing really hardened people.</p><br/><p>However, Pu Yao\u2019s words instantly made him nervous. \u201cThey have come to find you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFind me?\u201d Zuo Mo gaped.</p><br/><p>\u201cStars in Daytime, you alerted them.\u201d Pu Yao was very calm. This made the nervousness in Zuo Mo\u2019s heart decrease.</p><br/><p>\u201cStars in Daytime, what does it do?\u201d Zuo Mo asked a question that had been hidden in his heart for a long time.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot much. Some strong yaomo would try to borrow the power of the stars to recover from serious wounds, and this forms the Stars in Daytime.\u201d Pu Yao said.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Pu Yao smiled coldly, \u201cNone of my business!\u201d He then frowned. \u201cBut these things are slightly irritating.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you a yao? Should you be of the same kind as them?\u201d Zuo Mo couldn\u2019t really grasp Pu Yao\u2019s attitude. However, if it wasn\u2019t Pu Yao, who was it? Was it the gravestone?</p><br/><p>Pu Yao did not like xiuzhe, Zuo Mo could understand this, but he could not understand that Pu Yao didn\u2019t even like the yao.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t have any connection to me.\u201d Pu Yao\u2019s face was cold.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo saw that Pu Yao didn\u2019t seem to want to mention this matter, and perceptively changed the topic. \u201cDo you have any good suggestions?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour luck seems pretty good. The arrivals are the Wood Clan.\u201d Pu Yao glanced at the organized ranks of yao troops in the sky. \u201cThey don\u2019t like fighting.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWood clan?\u201d Zuo Mo was very curious. Zuo Mo might have openly spoke about the little yao before, but that was buying and selling at the same time. Zuo Mo was very unfamiliar with yaomo. Seeing that he could not avoid a conflict with the yaomo, it was beneficial for him to know a bit more.</p><br/><p>\u201cA large clan, but it has many cadet branches. Formed from flora.\u201d Pu Yao introduced shortly.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh \u2026 \u2026\u201d Zuo Mo nodded, not understanding. What was formed from flora? But he knew that Pu Yao definitely did not have the patience to explain.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Zuo Mo detected a strong consciousness ripple.</p><br/><p>\u201cHm!\u201d He couldn\u2019t help but jump. Such a strong consciousness!</p><br/><p>The consciousness ripple came from the other side and swept the sky above the entire Desolate Wood Reef. Before this, Zuo Mo had been very confident in his consciousness. He had almost never encountered a xiuzhe who had a stronger consciousness than he did.</p><br/><p>But the strength of this consciousness was far above his.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey are searching for you. Such a pity, just Night Stock yao, they believe they have the skill!\u201d Pu Yao smirked. He seemed to understand what Zuo Mo was thinking. \u201cIt\u2019s very normal. They only cultivate the consciousness, it isn\u2019t something a half-ass like you can compare to.\u201d</p><br/><p>Pu Yao\u2019s interest was unknowingly stirred. \u201cYao cultivate the consciousness so the division for spiritual power is much finer than the xiuzhe. Star fire, manifestation, spirit seed, yin spirit, yao mansion, six revolutions, and sky channels. You are just at manifestation. Among them, the most powerful have finished spirit seed. Even though their spirit is weak, but it can easy to kill you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cManifestation?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen the starfire is full, it manifests, seed born in the heart to become planted in the spirit, the spirit births the yin spirit, the yin spirit opens the yao mansion \u2026 \u2026 spiritual manifestation, oh, your leaf hand is a manifestation.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe consciousness can become tangible?\u201d Zuo Mo asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, it\u2019s so simple, do you really need to think about it?\u201d Pu Yao\u2019s face was full of disdain. \u201cHowever, you just entered manifestation, you\u2019re very far off from spirit seed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is called seed born in the heart?\u201d Zuo Mo couldn\u2019t help but ask, his head bloated.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll know when it is time.\u201d Pu Yao had used up his patience.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSolve it yourself.\u201d Pu Yao said impatiently before disappearing.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey are going to attack.\u201d Gongsun Cha pulled Zuo Mo back.</p><br/><p>The attacking posture of the other size was so obvious even an idiot could see. Zuo Mo couldn\u2019t help but become nervous. Pulling Gongsun Cha and Chun Yu Cheng, he pushed his voice low, \u201cPrepare to escape.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d Chun Yu Cheng\u2019s face was puzzled.</p><br/><p>Gongsun Cha suddenly opened his mouth, \u201cTowards the jie river!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe jie river? Little Mountain Jie?\u201d Zuo Mo was very surprised, \u201cIsn\u2019t that heading for the net?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Endless Ocean is vast and borderless. We need to fly multiple months to see land, there is no place to hide.\u201d Gongsun Cha was very calm, a hint of heat in his eyes. \u201cWhen it\u2019s time, these people will all scatter. We\u2019ll go the opposite way and break through. They definitely wouldn\u2019t have thought of it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey just came from Little Mountain Jie, Little Mountain Jie definitely has fallen. If we go to Little Mountain Jie, we have no escape.\u201d Chun Yu Cheng was frightened by Gongsun Cha\u2019s suggestion, so frightened he woke up.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is not certain.\u201d Gongsun Cha shook his head. \u201cIf Little Mountain Jie has fallen, what would come definitely wouldn\u2019t just be this little amount of yao.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is a little?\u201d Chun Yu Cheng pointed at the organized and solemn yao army in the sky, and shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cTo us, it seems like a lot. But if they want to attack Sky Moon Jie, it is far too few,\u201d Gongsun Cha said quickly.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo instantly reacted. \u201cYou mean they are a little troop that snuck in?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPossible.\u201d Gongsun Cha said.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did they sneak in for?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, they probably have a target?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo suddenly thought of what Pu Yao had said. Did these people really come to find him? No, to find the yaomo of the Stars in Daytime?</p><br/><p>He continued to weigh the choices in his heart. Truthfully, Gongsun Cha\u2019s suggestion was very dangerous, no, it was extremely dangerous. But Zuo Mo felt that the success of that suggestion was very likely. From this, it could be seen that he was in support of Gongsun Cha\u2019s suggestion.</p><br/><p>Chose which one?</p><br/><p>He was just a little xiuzhe that had just broken through to ningmai and hadn\u2019t seen much. Facing a choice that would determine life and death, he couldn\u2019t help but hesitate.</p><br/><p>Yet the other didn\u2019t give the time to hesitate.</p><br/><p>The sky above the other side\u2019s troop was suddenly dark. Strong ling power ripples were like a harsh wind that swept past.</p><br/><p>Damn it!</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo jumped in fright. The other side was going to attack. The ling power ripples passing through the air were the same as [Yang Fiend Hard Lightning] but the terrifying presence it gave off was hundreds of times stronger. He didn\u2019t doubt that their attack would flatten all of Desolate Wood Reef.</p><br/><p>If he didn\u2019t run now, when could he run?</p><br/><p>He grabbed Gongsun Cha and Chun Yu Cheng, not caring for anything else, and suddenly jumped into the water.</p><br/><p>A gold light flashed, and the Buddha Sound Hoop landed in Zuo Mo\u2019s bosom, the presence of the formation on the Desolate Wood Reef weakening.</p><br/><p>The Desolate Wood Reef instantly exploded!</p><br/><p>\u201cHe ran! Zuo Mo ran!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRun!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone, run!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026 \u2026</p><br/><p>At this time, with a large sound, a bolt of lightning twisted and struck the Desolate Wood Reef.</p><br/><p>Dong!</p><br/><p>A muffled sound hit everyone\u2019s heart. Those xiuzhe with weak cultivations bled from their mouths and nose.</p><br/><p>Everyone couldn\u2019t help but turn their head.</p><br/><p>The Desolate Wood Reef with its layers of formations was like paper in front of the lightning, cleanly wiped out. More than ten of the xiuzhe that moved too slowly were swept by the after-ripples and torn to countless pieces, not even having the time shout before their souls were destroyed.</p><br/><p>In the ocean, Zuo Mo didn\u2019t have it good either. The blood inside his body was roiling, his ling power almost spiraled out of control. Gongsun Cha and Chun Yu Cheng\u2019s faces were pale, the power of the one attack was so powerful that it even passed into the ocean!</p><br/><p>At the border of life and death, Zuo Mo became calm. A date seed appeared on his hand, a talisman-ship was carved on it. This date seed ship had been taken from Nan Ming Zi\u2019s body. However, it required too much ling power, so he hadn\u2019t found out how to use it.</p><br/><p>In seclusion this time, after finishing forging the five essence sword set, Zuo Mo had spent a lot of effort on the talismans that he did not understand. He hadn\u2019t expected that he found some methods, and including this date seed boat.</p><br/><p>At this time, he didn\u2019t dare to hold anything back, the ling power in his body furiously flooding towards the date seed boat.</p><br/><p>A little date red wooden boat with an old aura appeared in front of everyone.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo\u2019s hand moved.</p><br/><p>They felt the scene in front of them blur and then they were inside the ship. The ship was dry and clean. The water outside the ship seemed to be stopped by an invisible power, unable to enter.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo hurriedly directed the date seed ship to sink to the bottom .The thick water could stop the search from the other\u2019s consciousness.</p><br/><p>If they could flee to a place that the other could not detect them, they would be temporarily safe.</p><br/><p>Translator Ramblings: Little more stuff on yao society and military. Don\u2019t speculate too much since this is just the tip of the iceberg. Zuo Mo knows nothing. He\u2019s just the mouthpieces for Pu Yao.</p><br/><p>I told Lemeres I\u2019m going to reply to their comment from yesterday. So, yes, this is a yao military unit that has attacked what is essentially a civilian outpost. But the status of these two sides are not equal. It is hard to say that the xiuzhe all fail because of this one encoutner. This is the military, so there is training and organization on one side. What they are facing is country bumpkins that are civilians. The yao military win due to numbers and organization, but they can\u2019t be the only side with armies. The story will be a whole less realistic. Mu Xi has clearly trained for her position through school, and she is an officer. The rest are trained soldiers sent on this special mission so they probably are not regular foot soldiers. Remember that the xiuzhe are fleeing Sky Moon Jie and the ones that are passing through Zuo Mo\u2019s island aren\u2019t the big sects but the lower classes. They have no organization that they belong to so not one of them would stay to fight. That is what causes this instant defeat in this chapter.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

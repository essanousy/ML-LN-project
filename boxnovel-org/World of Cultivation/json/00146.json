Even if we tell him, he won\u2019t be able to get back. Unless he is jindan, he can\u2019t get back in three days.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I won\u2019t go to Bright Wave Jie! I\u2019ll go get him!\u201d Shi Feng Rong said decisively.</p><br/><p>\u201cNonsense!\u201d Pei Yuan Ran was furious. Looking at the pain and anger on Shi Feng Rong\u2019s face, he suppressed the anger inside and said in a low voice, \u201cThere are so many experts in Bright Wave Jie. Whether our sect can establish ourselves in Bright Wave Jie, it all depends on us jindan. In our time of need, will Shimei abandon the entire sect for just Zuo Mo?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shi Feng Rong bit her lips tears flowing down uncontrollably.</p><br/><p>Pei Yuan Ran relaxed his tone of voice, \u201cShimei, don\u2019t worry. Zuo Mo is usually clever. He definitely will be fine. After we establish ourselves in Bright Wave Jie, we can send people to search for him!\u201d</p><br/><p>Pei Yuan Ran comforted Shi Feng Rong for a long time before she was finally persuaded.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>When Lin Qian saw Pei Yuan Ran, he saw the other\u2019s face was dark, and assumed that Pei Yuan Ran was worried for the future. He comforted, \u201cSect Leader Pei, do not worry too much. This one has some weight in Bright Wave Jie and will definitely pick a good land for your sect.\u201d</p><br/><p>Pei Yuan Ran raised his hands in thanks, but he stared at Lin Qian and said solemnly, \u201cThis one still has one thing that that he does not understand. Master Lin, please explain a few things to me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, please speak, Sect Leader Pei,\u201d Lin Qian said.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin has no connection to our sect, so why have you been so close with our sect as of late?\u201d Pei Yuan Ran\u2019s eyes were bright.</p><br/><p>Lin Qian seemed to have already know that Pei Yuan Ran would ask this, and smiled, \u201cIf that\u2019s the case, then I will speak the truth. It is because I see potential in Wei Sheng. Wei Sheng is the most talented xiuzhe that this one has ever seen, he has unbridled potential and his future will certainly be boundless. Sect Leader Pei can think of this as an investment. In the future, when I need help, please, Sect Leader Pei, lend a hand.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNaturally,\u201d Pei Yuan Ran\u2019s heart relaxed slightly. Even though he didn\u2019t believe all of it, but he didn\u2019t let it show.</p><br/><p>Lin Qian smiled and said, \u201cWe will temporarily set our departure at noon three days from now. This one will be waiting and won\u2019t disturbed Sect Leader Pei now. Farewell!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI won\u2019t see you off!\u201d Pei Yuan Ran said, raising his folded hands.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo and Bo Feng had made two good transactions, the aura between them very harmonious.</p><br/><p>Chang Heng and Gui Feng were not interested in Golden Crow Fire, something Zuo Mo felt was very regretful about. However before leaving, Zuo Mo asked them to spread the news of the Golden Crow Fire, and Bo Feng agreed.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo saw Bo Feng and the others leave.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d Pu Yao suddenly asked.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo inhaled deeply, and then exhaled, as though he wanted to pushed out all the darkness that had formed in his heart, \u201cI\u2019ll take it step by step.\u201d</p><br/><p>Pu Yao smiled coldly, \u201cYou didn\u2019t receive one bit of information. Tsk tsk, seems those old codgers don\u2019t value you very much!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo was silent.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlan on flying back?\u201d Pu Yao didn\u2019t have any sympathy.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s not enough time,\u201d Zuo Mo shook his head. From the Desolate Wood Reef to Wu Kong Mountain, flying would take multiple months.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d Pu Yao said unconcernedly, \u201cEven if the yaomo come, it would be small groups. Probably just Night Stock Yao and Moon Demon, nothing important.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNight Stock Yao and Moon Demon? Are they very strong?\u201d Zuo Mo asked curiously. He didn\u2019t know much about yaomo.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle worms,\u201d Pu Yao twisted his mouth, \u201cabout the same as ningmai.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen why is everyone fleeing?\u201d Zuo Mo could not understand, \u201cIf they are about the same as ningmai, we can completely kill them!\u201d</p><br/><p>Pu Yao smiled scornfully. \u201cWhether Night Stock Yao or Moon Demon, if they face your ningmai, they can fight one against three!\u201d His bloody pupil suddenly rippled, \u201cTheir growing environment is much more cruel than you guys.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo what?\u201d Zuo Mo wasn\u2019t persuaded.\u201d Sky Moon Jie has jindan!\u201d</p><br/><p>Pu Yao shrugged indifferently, \u201cThis is just the beginning. I am willing to bet\u2026 no, guarantee that the old codgers of your sect are definitely planning on migrating away. Who is willing to bleed themselves to help other people stop yaomo?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWu Kong Mountain is the base of our sect \u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are too na\u00efve!\u201d Pu Yao\u2019s words were full of scorn, \u201cJust a poor mountain. As long as they have people, where can\u2019t they go? Without the mountain, they can go steal another one.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo couldn\u2019t speak.</p><br/><p>\u201cPrepare early,\u201d Pu Yao shook his head, \u201cI won\u2019t have any time in the near future, don\u2019t bother me.\u201d</p><br/><p>He disappeared after finishing.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo stood at his spot he was unfocused for a moment. He could not think that the entire front line of Bloody Sky Metropolis Jie had collapsed in such a short period of time. This was the news that he traded with Bo Feng. Supposedly, it was a group of yaomo that had appeared at the flank and caused the collapse of the entire defensive line which fortified Bloody Sky Metropolis Jie.</p><br/><p>Sky Moon Jie was not immediately next to Bloody Sky Metropolis Jie, but it wasn\u2019t far from it, so it was in a very dangerous situation. Many sects of Sky Moon Jie had already started to prepare for migration.</p><br/><p>This was the news from five days ago.</p><br/><p>What had frozen Zuo Mo\u2019s heart was that he had not received any news from his own sect. News from five days ago, with Wu Kong Sword Sect\u2019s present status, they couldn\u2019t be ignorant of it. If he moved now, he couldn\u2019t meet up with the sect unless the sect migrated to Little Mountain Jie. But if they were going through Little Mountain Jie, they would have notified him so he could prepare to receive them.</p><br/><p>But he hadn\u2019t received anything.</p><br/><p>He knew that he was set on a different path from the sect after this incident.</p><br/><p>He wasn\u2019t sad. In reality, when he had came out of the sword essence formation, he had sensed it coming, but he hadn\u2019t thought the day would come so quickly. The present Wu Kong Sword Sect had long not been the Wu Kong Sword Sect of the past.</p><br/><p>Never mind, he should think of way to protect himself. It was better to rely on himself than on others.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo\u2019s idea was quite different than anyone else. He decided to keep guarding Desolate Wood Reef. Desolate Wood Reef\u2019s environment was special. Adding on the Skyring Moon Chime Formation, and the golden armor guards, he could basically guarantee his own safety. If it was needed, he could enter Little Mountain Jie through the jie river at any time.</p><br/><p>But before that, he needed to increase his own strength. Otherwise, with his zhuji cultivation and despite his large wealth of jingshi, not a piece of him would remain. If he left, he would take the shidi with him.</p><br/><p>He had found all the materials for the five essence sword set. Also, his cultivation, which hadn\u2019t moved for such a long time, finally had started to grow.</p><br/><p>At this time, it was better to control his personality and increase his own strength before anything else.</p><br/><p>The re-forging of Water Drop sword was very quick, only taking one day. He added a piece of fourth-grade Crimson Fire Rock. Even though that did not elevate it to fourth-grade, it rose to the top of third-grade. The outer layer of the Water Drop sword had an additional aura of bright red flame that constantly burned.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo renamed it [Water Fire Sword].</p><br/><p>The Teeth Vine was soaked in a \u201cling spring.\u201d There were no ling springs on the Desolate Wood Reef. This ling spring was one that Zuo Mo made himself using formations. The effect was not as good as natural ling springs. Zuo Mo could only increase the time it spent in the water.</p><br/><p>The ten days it should have taken to forge, were extended to thirty days by Zuo Mo.</p><br/><p>The Blue Icicle Crystal, the Breath Rock, and the Fox Teeth were all fourth-grade materials. It was almost impossible for Zuo Mo at present to forge them. He could only process them into sword billets. When his cultivation reached ningmai and he had absorbed Golden Crow Fire, could he finish the forging.</p><br/><p>All of his other time was spent on meditation.</p><br/><p>In this period of time, even Pu Yao who usually disdained Zuo Mo\u2019s cultivation, intelligently chose to remain silent. Also, Pu Yao was very busy in this time.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo received a flying sword message from his Master. On there, it said that Bloody Sky Metropolis Jie had collapsed, and the sect decided to move to Bright Wave Jie. She told Zuo Mo to be careful and protect himself. It also told him he could enter other sects. If there was a chance, he could also go to Bright Wave Jie to find them.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo put the flying sword message into his ring, and turned back to his meditation.</p><br/><p>On the Desolate Wood Reef, the black lake had been completely transformed.</p><br/><p>The inky black pond water now glowed darkly. On the shore, a simple and old-fashioned stone altar had taken form. Thirty something little yao guards continuously took water from the black water pond and poured it onto the stone tiles of the altar.</p><br/><p>The stone tiles were like sponges. No matter how much black water was poured onto the surface, they didn\u2019t leave one drop behind.</p><br/><p>Pu Yao looked at the altar, not saying a word.</p><br/><p>The number of xiuzhe that passed through Desolate Wood Reef increased over the days. At the beginning, there were little crowds. After a while, it turned to a continuous flow.</p><br/><p>The power of the Skyring Moon Chime formation was much higher than before, so the consumption of jingshi was also much higher. Each day, it needed twenty pieces of third-grade jingshi to remain active. However, even though it was very expensive, but the strength exuded by the Brahma sound ring, and the Skyring Moon Chime Formation, prevented the passing xiuzhe from daring to have any greedy thoughts.</p><br/><p>The rumors were that the Black Wind Bandits had attacked the Desolate Wood Reef, but ended up all being annihilated. There were also rumors that Zuo Mo was selling Golden Crow Fire. As long as they could pay the price or had good things to trade, they could buy it at any time.</p><br/><p>Each xiuzhe that came onto the island would ask around about these two pieces of news when they landed.</p><br/><p>As the flow of people increased, Zuo Mo\u2019s daily income also shot up. However, he didn\u2019t have any time to put on it. Each day, he furiously meditated, hoping to quickly break through to ningmai.</p><br/><p>In comparison, Lil\u2019 Pagoda was living very well these past days. The large amounts of talismans and materials that Zuo Mo had gotten from the Black Wind Bandits were quite good. Since Zuo Mo could not use them, and there was no place he could sell them, he decided to feed it all to Lil\u2019 Pagoda.</p><br/><p>Lil\u2019 Pagoda flowed with light. Compared to the fragility of the past, it seemed to be brimming with life.</p><br/><p>The tip of the tower that had been as sharp as a sword was now much more round. The slender body seemed much broader. The past Five Colored Pagoda gave people the feeling of darkness and sharpness. Now, it was more lively and nimble, the aura of killing was much smaller. What Zuo Mo felt most strange about were the five little gourds appeared on the eaves of the first level.</p><br/><p>The five little gourds were all of different colors, belonging to the five elements. They were the size of a grain of a rice. If Zuo Mo did not look closely, he wouldn\u2019t have found them.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo and Lil\u2019 Pagoda communicated many times on the use of the five little gourds. Lil\u2019 Pagoda tried very hard to explain, but Zuo Mo didn\u2019t understand even after a long time. Full of anticipation, Zuo Mo couldn\u2019t do anything except throw the question to one side.</p><br/><p>To Zuo Mo\u2019s joy, Lil\u2019 Pagoda spat out a piece of grey mud again. It was slightly larger than last time, about the size of his thumb. Zuo Mo put the little bit of grey mud into his ring.</p><br/><p>The other shidi also knew now that the sect had already left Sky Moon Jie. Everyone\u2019s mood became terrible. Some people joined other sects. Zuo Mo didn\u2019t stop them. In situations like this, they were certainly free to enter other sects.</p><br/><p>Power and responsibility were tied together. The sect surrendered their responsibilities to them. Accordingly, they also surrendered the power to constrain them.</p><br/><p>All of Zuo Mo\u2019s efforts were put on cultivation.</p><br/><p>He could feel his cultivation progressing extremely quickly. On a certain day, he finally started his charge at ningmai!</p><br/><p>Translator Ramblings: Some of you were almost correct, and a few of you were on the dot. pennamemoe was the first person to get it exactly right.</p><br/><p>No ramblings today so you guys can process this chapter without my influence. =) I\u2019ll write tomorrow.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

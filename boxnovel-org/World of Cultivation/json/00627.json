They realized that this battalion was not one from Cloud Sea Jie after the xiuzhe they sent as a messenger had been killed, confirming status as an enemy.</p><br/><p>When Ma Fan received the report, he understood the seriousness of the situation. Lil\u2019 Miss was in Middle Granary Jie and in Cloud Sea Jie, the only camp that could fight was Black Turtle Camp.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, in order to connect the large cloud islands together, the transportation formations inside Cloud Sea Jie were very well-developed. The area near the jie river was also a place greatly protected and the transportation formations were very convenient.</p><br/><p>Ma Fan decided to report the news to Lil\u2019 Miss Daren as he furiously organized his troops to rush towards the jie river.</p><br/><p>After going through several transportation formations, Ma Fan\u2019s Black Turtle Camp reached the jie river at their fastest possible speed!</p><br/><p>To his surprise, when he arrived, the other side was resting. With a moment of thought, Ma Fan understood. The other probably had travelled a long-distance and needed to recover.</p><br/><p>The xiuzhe that had went to meet them had been killed. There was no need to inquire about their intentions.</p><br/><p>\u201cSuch a powerful battalion!\u201d Nian Lu said in surprise.</p><br/><p>Ma Fan\u2019s expression was slightly grave. He could also see the extraordinary skill of this battalion, fromtheir outfits equipment and their well-organized troops. They were definitely military.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are we afraid of? If we charge, they will fall!\u201d Lei Peng rumbled, his expression unconcerned. Without Lil\u2019 Miss\u2019 control in Black Turtle Camp, Lei Peng\u2019s bravado had grown.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan you see their origins?\u201d Ma Fan asked Nian Lu.</p><br/><p>Of the three, Nian Lu was the most detail-oriented and was a very good vice commander.</p><br/><p>Nian Lu\u2019s eyes narrowed and a moment later, his expression changed slightly. \u201cIt is a battalion from Xuan Kong Temple!\u201d The insignia on their bodies flashed with light under the sun. Lil\u2019 Miss had expected Xuan Kong Temple to come seek them long ago and paid special attention to intelligence from Xuan Kong Temple.</p><br/><p>\u201cXuan Kong Temple!\u201d Ma Fan\u2019s expression couldn\u2019t help but change slightly. No wonder he felt the other\u2019s troops were extraordinary, a Xuan Kong Temple Battalion.</p><br/><p>Having discovered the other\u2019s origins, the trio knew there was no way to avoid this fight.</p><br/><p>But a battalion from Xuan Kong Temple \u2026 \u2026</p><br/><p>Up until now, Black Turtle Camp had never had a large battle. Ma Fan knew without thinking what the result of facing this Xuan Kong Temple battalion was.</p><br/><p>Lil\u2019 Miss Daren had definitely received the news now. Vermillion Bird Camp was most likely on the way!</p><br/><p>What they needed to do was delay them and wait for Vermillion Bird Camp to arrive. Ma Fan didn\u2019t even think about facing them in real battle. Cloud Sea Jie was not a large jie, and even the outstanding disciples of local sects were lacking compared to the xiuzhe in the other\u2019s battalion.</p><br/><p>But no matter what, they could not let the other advance deep into Cloud Sea Jie!</p><br/><p>The Great Thousand Island Formation was not yet complete. There was Turtle Island and Golden Crow Camp. If the other charged onto Turtle Island, than Daren\u2019s great estate would be ruined! He definitely could not accept this!</p><br/><p>Ma Fan looked behind him. Black Turtle Camp had departed just as training for the day had started. They were now just warmed up, and they had arrived using the transportation formations so they had not expended a great amount of energy along the way.</p><br/><p>In other words, Black Turtle Camp\u2019s energy and alertness were at their peak!</p><br/><p>The other might looked disciplined but their expressions could not disguise their tiredness.</p><br/><p>Ma Fan gritted his teeth, murderousness flashing through his eyes. This was their best chance! If the other recovered, then it would not be good!</p><br/><p>Thinking it through, Ma Fan\u2019s expression calmed down. He pulled over Lei Peng. \u201cLei Zi, you are first, let\u2019s charge!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lei Peng grinned, his expression excited. He liked these words the best!</p><br/><p>As to that Xuan Kong Temple, who was that?</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>Feng Yue\u2019s expression darkened. This battalion had clearly come from another place. The other\u2019s quick response almost surpassed her imagination.</p><br/><p>She was very knowledgeable and instantly understood Cloud Sea Jie had built a well-developed transportation formation system. She couldn\u2019t help but be surprised. Everyone knew the benefits of a transportation formation system, but each transportation formation was a significant expenditure. They also needed xiuzhe skilled in seal formations to build them and creating a system would take a large amount of jingshi. Not everyone would be willing to spend such a great price.</p><br/><p>But when her gaze swept this battalion, the anxiety in her heart settled back down.</p><br/><p>The other battalion\u2019s skill level was very lacking compared to her battalion. She did not feel that this was strange. This was an expected situation. The regular battalions of Xuan Kong Temple were not lacking compared to the elite battalions of smaller places.</p><br/><p>This was what it meant to be a great sect!</p><br/><p>Even more, they were one of the great four.</p><br/><p>They were like the titans at the top of the food chain. They could idly look down at the beings living below. With just a pinky, they could crush a whole group of little ants.</p><br/><p>In the eyes of Feng Yue, Cloud Sea Jie was a little group of ants!</p><br/><p>Ants could chew an elephant to death, but not a dragon!</p><br/><p>Suddenly, her expression stilled. Disbelief came onto her face. The other battalion was charging at them!</p><br/><p>Feng Yue had followed Jiang Zhe though numerous battles. Other than the mo, no battalion had ever attacked them first.</p><br/><p>Where these people crazy?</p><br/><p>Feng Yue stood up, her eyes becoming icy. She was going to let these ants know that even the spark of anger from a dragon was enough to burn them to the point that not even ash would remain!</p><br/><p>The other xiuzhe also stood up. The laughable actions of the other side provoke these proud combat xiu!</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>Gao Xuan was feeling panicked. He had not expected Feng Yue to be in such a rush. He had sprinted with five hundred people but he still could not catch up to the other.</p><br/><p>The reply that Feng Yue had given him was that she would finish the battle as quickly as possible.</p><br/><p>Thinking about this, Gao Xuan couldn\u2019t help but grimace. He was trying his best to hurry and catch up but the girl was not grateful. However, he did not doubt Feng Yue\u2019s confidence. Feng Yue was a better battle general than he was, and the one thousand combat xiu in her command were experienced and had been tempered in battle. Even though they could not compare to the Jiangzi Battalion, they would dominate in any normal jie.</p><br/><p>But he still did not dare to linger and sprinted on.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>\u201cHem hem hem!\u201d Zuo Mo pretentiously coughed.</p><br/><p>Everyone, including Tao Xing, Tang Fei and Shou Ping were pulled over. Everyone looked in puzzlement at Zuo Mo. Looking at him, it seemed he had something to announce.</p><br/><p>\u201cStarting from today, everyone, call me Xiao Mo Ge!\u201d Zuo Mo bowed.</p><br/><p>The people stared at each other and did not understand what Zuo Mo was doing. Tao Xing was the first to react. His eyes lit up. \u201cIs Mister Zuo worried that someone will figure out your background?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is Mister Xiao!\u201d Zuo Mo seriously corrected Tao Xing.</p><br/><p>Tang Fei\u2019s expression shifted. Inside, she thought, was this guy\u2019s background really extraordinary? Otherwise, why would he use an alias?</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo\u2019s reaction was evidence for Tao Xing\u2019s speculation. Tao Xing said unconcernedly, \u201cEven though I feel that this will not work, but if you insist, this isn\u2019t a problem.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cVery good!\u201d Zuo Mo clapped and turned to look at the other people.</p><br/><p>Tang Fei nodded. \u201cAlright!\u201d</p><br/><p>Shou Ping obediently nodded. \u201cNot a problem, Xiao Daren!\u201d After he had been admonished by Ceng Lian\u2019er, Shou Ping became much more obedient.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo automatically ignored Ceng Lian\u2019er. Zuo Mo was not changing his name due to an impulse. The name Zuo Mo would easily catch the attention of Kun Lun. Who would know if there were Kun Lun spies here?</p><br/><p>\u201cEven though you are not part of my battalion, I still have to remind you that the challenge this time is not an accident. Someone is acting against us,\u201d Zuo Mo said calmly.</p><br/><p>Tao Xing nodded. \u201cIt is Bu Heng!\u201d</p><br/><p>He had stayed in Great Peace City before and knew what went on behind the scenes. He explained, \u201cBu Heng and his battalion have entered Great Peace City. He should be the culprit this time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis guy just won\u2019t go away,\u201d Zuo Mo muttered. He had completely forgotten how he had killed a few hundred of the other\u2019s people. However, when he thought, he instantly became happy.</p><br/><p>Bu Heng would not rest and would definitely send more people to test him out.</p><br/><p>Wouldn\u2019t they be delivering themselves to him?</p><br/><p>He wouldn\u2019t have to go find time to make challenges.</p><br/><p>However, before this, he had to make a few more trips to the Mo Skills Steles. The content on the steles were very useful. What he had comprehended from the Mo Skill Steles had been crucial in dealing the fatal strike to Pang Chen.</p><br/><p>This filled him with anticipation about the other content on the Mo Skill Steles.</p><br/><p>A Wen had been scolded heavily by Shu Long after his epiphany passed, protecting Daren would be his first responsibility. Thinking how Daren had left someone to guard him so he would not be disturbed during his epiphany, A Wen was both moved and ashamed.</p><br/><p>Yet what he had not expected was that Daren had given him an unexpected order. Daren requested that he had to read every mo skill stele.</p><br/><p>Even if A Wen was stupid, he understood that Daren\u2019s orders were to benefit him. He swore inside he would always follow Daren!</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo did not think so much. He was still feeling the longing for the Mo Skill Steles.</p><br/><p>Yet what he did not expect was when he walked out of the yard, someone shouted, \u201cHe\u2019s come out!\u201d</p><br/><p>Woosh, a big group of people surrounded him.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo was shocked and almost attacked but he quickly found that while these people were excited, they did not hold enmity.</p><br/><p>\u201cDaren! Please accept me as your student!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDaren! Please accept me as your student!\u201d</p><br/><p>The tide of people crowded around Zuo Mo and cut off all paths of exit. Zuo Mo\u2019s face was confused and he clearly did not understand what was going on. Only when Tao Xing came out of the compound, squeezing through the crowd to stand next to him and explain, did Zuo Mo finally understand.</p><br/><p>They wanted to become his students!</p><br/><p>These people had come in search of a teacher. This was caused by Zuo Mo\u2019s victory of Pang Chen.</p><br/><p>The crowd was packed and looked extremely spectacular.</p><br/><p>After a rough glance, Zuo Mo estimated there were at least one hundred people, all of them looking pleadingly at Zuo Mo.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo not agree.\u201d Tao Xing said in a low voice by his year, \u201cThese people are not strong enough and do not have any potential. If you agree, they will be a burden.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo was silent.</p><br/><p>Translator Ramblings: Perfect ready made alias.

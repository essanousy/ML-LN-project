I didn\u2019t think that this guy was so cunning!\u201d Ji Cheng still didn\u2019t believe it, and it was hard to blame him. Before this, he wouldn\u2019t even look at the corps commander of a regular corps. In the eyes of these large clans, the subordinate corps of the Council of Elders were the true elite. The regular corps were stronger than local corps, but their prestige and reputation was low.</p><br/><p>But this time, he had been convinced that the regular corps also had powerful people.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo not underestimate others.\u201d Ji Li Yu rolled her eyes. \u201cYu Heng is a golden battle general in the end, so how could he be weak? But comparing the actors of this scene, Yu Zi Zhou is really lacking. There isn\u2019t anyone good in this generation of the Jade Family.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTsk tsk, it seems that Yu Zi Zhou is completely out of the game! This kind of trash, Old Sis will definitely look down on,\u201d Ji Cheng said as he shook his head.</p><br/><p>Ji Li Yu said unconcernedly, \u201cI didn\u2019t have much interest in him to start with. If it wasn\u2019t for fact he is from the Jade Family, I wouldn\u2019t have even bothered with him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know who will become my brother-in-law,\u201d Ji Cheng muttered. Then he seemed to think of something. \u201cBut seeing Xiao Mo Ge losing, Old Sis probably feels very good!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHee, slightly good!\u201d Ji Li Yu\u2019s brows relaxed, but then quickly creased again as she said, \u201cHowever, I feel that Xiao Mo Ge wouldn\u2019t lie down so easily.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn front of Yu Heng the old fox, he definitely has no chance of making a comeback,\u201d Ji Cheng said confidently.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat is not so certain \u2026 \u2026\u201d Ji Li Yu unconsciously wanted to say this; but when the words reached her mouth, she finally reacted and swallowed them back down.</p><br/><p>That figure floated in her mind. She had a strong feeling this guy wouldn\u2019t give up here!</p><br/><p>Fleeing without fighting definitely was not this guy\u2019s style!</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? You aren\u2019t going to help that little guy who you were interested in?\u201d the fire-faced person said curiously. \u201cThis guy\u2019s situation isn\u2019t good right now!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not so idle as to make time for such things,\u201d Tian Liu said disgruntledly.</p><br/><p>\u201cHm, weren\u2019t you very interested in him all this time? Didn\u2019t you praise him for his outstanding talent and limitless potential,\u201d the fire faced person asked with shock.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou who dislikes salt does not need to worry about those of us who like salted carrots.\u201d Qian Liu was so lazy he didn\u2019t even open his eyes.</p><br/><p>The fire faced person was enraged. \u201cI hate eating carrots!\u201d His tone suddenly changed. \u201cYou really aren\u2019t worried?\u201d</p><br/><p>Facing the fire faced person\u2019s nagging, Qian Liu was helpless. He could only raised his face. \u201cIn any case, it is just losing some popularity. So what? He won\u2019t lose his life.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s right.\u201d The fire faced person reacted.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlso, that boy isn\u2019t one take an attack like that lying down.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, you are actually interested in the boy \u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>Yu Heng\u2019s move caused both he and the Heavy Earth Corps to become famous.</p><br/><p>No matter if it was the normal citizens that were truly fooled by him, or his opponents that knew him, they were filled with praise. Morale at the Heavy Earth Corps increased. Everyone raised their heads and puffed their chests. They were mentally satisfied and full of reverence when they looked at the corps commander.</p><br/><p>Yu Heng was very proud. The effect that the plan, he had twisted his mind for, had had far surpassed his expectations. He had not been criticized for this matter. It was the opposite. Instead the military command had given him rewards for this. It had to be said that the geniuses of the yao art houses did not like to take positions in the military unless it was the corps that were directly subordinate to the Council of Elders, these were the positions that were attractive to them. The military command had always felt great pain about this but never had a solution.</p><br/><p>The draft call of the Heavy Metal Corps caused their eyes to light up. Even more importantly, Yu Heng had made this matter beautiful! It hadn\u2019t caused trouble for them, but made the military seem more upright. Even more, at this time when they were losing on the front lines, the words of the Corps Commander Yu Heng said had caused the low morale of the soldiers to greatly increase.</p><br/><p>Yu Heng\u2019s days became even better. As to whether or not Xiao Mo Ge would come, he was not concerned. After the storm this time, his reputation had shot up. Some citizens had put his name forward for the position of [The First Corps Commander of the Regular Corps]. No matter if Xiao Mo Ge came or not, he had benefited. As for actually being sent to the front lines, he was not afraid. His position as corps commander had been earned by rising up through the ranks.</p><br/><p>It really was profit without any costs!</p><br/><p>He smugly watched the yao channels. In the past, he did not like these things that were full of wasted words, but he liked them very much now. Listening to the reporters repeatedly praising him, that made him feel better than anything else.</p><br/><p>Yu Heng recognized the report in the yao channel. Yesterday, it had been him that had praised Yu Heng greatly, \u201cThe Tiger of the Regular Corps commanders,\u201d \u201ca true warrior,\u201d \u201cthe bravest of the generation.\u201d Yu Heng almost felt embarrassed from hearing the praises.</p><br/><p>How would this guy compliment him today?</p><br/><p>Yu Heng relaxed his body and laid halfway down as he thought and ate fruit.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn this period of time, the matter of the drafts has really been turbulent and caused a great and unprecedented discussion. Every side has been continuously speaking of their position. The words of Corps Commander Yu Heng have showed us the sincerity of the Heavy Earth Corps. However, from beginning to end, we have missed the voice of one of the most important participants, Xiao Mo Ge! From the start, Xiao Mo Ge has not showed himself, and has not ever given his opinion on this matter. What we are able to see is only Xiao Mo Ge one on four battle and him defeating four Heavy Earth Corps combat yao in the recording yao arts. But today, Xiao Mo Ge has finally made a statement.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Heng was unconcerned. No matter if it was emotionally or rationally, he had the advantage. No matter what Xiao Mo Ge said, he could not win.</p><br/><p>In the yao channel, Xiao Mo Ge\u2019s expression was cold. It was the first time Yu Heng saw Xiao Mo Ge\u2019s appearance. He paused slightly, so young, and then relaxed. His eyes were filled with amusement. What tricks would the other play?</p><br/><p>\u201cI still refuse the draft call of the Heavy Earth Corps.\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporter hurriedly asked, \u201cWhy? Do you not want to give your aid for this great war?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Xiao Mo Ge shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen why?\u201d the reporter pressed.</p><br/><p>Xiao Mo Ge showed an expression of struggle.</p><br/><p>Seeing the direction the interview was going, the reporter had a sense of urgency inside. On the outside, he had to act as a friendly guide. \u201cIf you have any difficulties, please tell everyone. I believe everyone will understand!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Mo Ge still shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it because of cultivation? You are at an important time in your cultivation?\u201d The reporter used his imagination.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Xiao Mo Ge shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it because of some predicament that cannot be altered?\u201d the reporter gritted his teeth and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Xiao Mo Ge shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen why?\u201d The report was going to go crazy.</p><br/><p>Hesitating once again, Xiao Mo Ge asked uncertainly, \u201cDo I really have to say it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m begging you, please say it!\u201d The reporter wanted to cry.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut saying it, I feel it wouldn\u2019t be good,\u201d Xiao Mo Ge slowly said.</p><br/><p>The reporter had tears on his face. At this time, every yao that was watching was crying. Yu Heng snorted and smirked. This guy was good at pretending to be mysterious but his moves really sucked!</p><br/><p>\u201cNo matter the reason, please say it!\u201d the reporter said with the last of his energy.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll say it!\u201d Xiao Mo Ge looked innocently at the reporter.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease say \u2026 \u2026 please say \u2026 \u2026\u201d the reporter panted and nodded.</p><br/><p>Xiao Mo Ge suddenly paused. He retracted his playful expression and became grave. All the yao that were watching this unconsciously held their breath. Every yao had the same feeling that Xiao Mo Ge\u2019s following words were definitely very important!</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause\u2026\u201d Xiao Mo Ge who had closed his eyes suddenly opened them with a sharp gaze, \u201cbecause they are too weak!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cToo weak?\u201d Intimidated by Xiao Mo Ge\u2019s presence, the reporter instinctively asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was four against one a fight with an inexperienced youth like me, who has never stepped on the battlefield, yet they were defeated in one round. Is this the strength of our regular corps?\u201d There was indifference in his tone,reaccounting the event without emotion, yet he was able to convey his deep disappointment. \u201cI am very disappointed! This is our Heavy Earth Corps? This is the Heavy Earth Corps that we have hoped would be able to protect us? This is the Heavy Earth Corps that we are hoping can win this great war?\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporter was completely stunned! Yu Heng was stunned! All the yao that were watching the yao channel were stunned!</p><br/><p>In their ears, there was only Xiao Mo Ge\u2019s icy voice echoing.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo I refuse! I have never thought that a regular corps would be this weak. Four against one, but where was your teamwork? Where was the basic strategy that combat yao should have? Where was it? I believe that there are many who have seen the recording yao art. Can you find even the slightest trace of these things from there? And this is our regular corps?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Mo Ge shook his head, his expression serious, as he seemed to talk to himself.</p><br/><p>\u201cA corps that is in such decline saying they want to draft me, should I feel proud? No! I feel embarrassed! This is an embarrassment! Even though I have never joined the army before, in my mind, the army was powerful, so powerful it required our reverence. A qualified combat yao may not match an expert in a one on one battle, but when it is four on one, such a poor performance cannot be forgiven!\u201d</p><br/><p>Among the silence, Zuo Mo\u2019s voice was clear.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy personal experiences fill me with bewilderment. The so-called corps commander of this kind of corps, is he really a qualified battle general?\u201d</p><br/><p>In front of the yao channel, Yu Heng was so angry his face was white. His breath was stuck at his chest, unable to go up or down.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaybe a four on one battle cannot reveal the problem. Then\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>In the yao channel, Xiao Mo Ge that had thrown out such shocking words suddenly raised his head. His raised his right arm, his finger pointing straight as though Yu Heng was right in front of him.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s have a fight! Gold General Corps Commander Yu Heng!\u201d</p><br/><p>The clear voice and the domineering presence were imprinted in the minds of countless people alongside the figure of the youth giving a battle challenge with his arm.</p><br/><p>Translator Ramblings: Some of you are very good at predicting what comes next \u2026 \u2026 I like how this chapter showed some of Yu Heng\u2019s faults. Morale is important in any culture, even in fantasy worlds, and so is the desire to get promoted.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo is a total liar, never having stepped onto a battlefield\u2026 \u2026 of course not, those were just spars, friendly ones that end up with death or being scalped, or both.</p><br/><p>Going off for the weekend so internet will be limited. Tomorrow\u2019s chapter is scheduled.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

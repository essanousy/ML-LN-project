It sounded extremely crass but he didn\u2019t care.</p><br/><p>He had planned on making a few more to give to Yan Le Shishu to sell for jingshi but very quickly, he could only put this matter to the side. In the ling fields, a batch of ling grasses and herbs were ready for harvest. He had farmed attentively each day. Like [Little Art of Cloud and Rain], [Art of Earth Energy] and [Art of Crimson Flame], he would cast it multiple times each day. And [Art of Flora] and [Art of Aged Gold] would be used once every couple of days.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo had never farmed like this in the past. Due to his diligent care, the growth of the plants in West Wind Valley was extremely outstanding. Some of the ling plants with short growth periods were ready for harvest.</p><br/><p>For Zuo Mo whose purse was rusted, this was really a perfectly timed rainstorm. Due to its importance, he even asked for a break from Master.</p><br/><p>Inside West Wind Valley, a skeleton bent over the ling fields and sweated.</p><br/><p>\u201cFinally all done.\u201d Zuo Mo sat on the ground as he panted. Looking at the small pile of ling plants in front of him, he was filled with satisfaction. Then he turned to look in the corner. The third grade fire dragon grass was almost full grown. A bright fiery red, very beautiful.</p><br/><p>He sorted out the ling grasses and herbs by type and then by grade. Then he carefully wrapped them. After all that, Zuo Mo rode the grey beaked goose towards Yan Le Shishu\u2019s residence.</p><br/><p>When Yan Le saw Zuo Mo, especially the big bag on Zuo Mo\u2019s back, his eyes instantly lit up: \u201cDid Shizhi grow something good?\u201d</p><br/><p>Putting down the large bag, Zuo Mo wiped the sweat on his forehead: \u201cThis is a bunch of ling herbs that were just grown. Shibo, please help me sell them.\u201d Letting someone else sell them required given two-tenths to the sect but Zuo Mo still decided to let the sect sell them. Other than the fact that Yan Le Shibo knew more about the market than he did, the sect\u2019s contribution points were very useful. And the more one contributed to the sect , their status within the sect would naturally become higher.</p><br/><p>Even though Pu Yao was in his sea of consciousness, but this fickle and perverse renyao could not be relied on. Pu Yao was a completely dangerous factor. If he didn\u2019t have to touch him, it was best not to.</p><br/><p>In comparison, Zuo Mo was much more willing to take advantage of the sect\u2019s power. At the very least, the elders of the sect appeared to be normal people. But this way, raising his own status in the sect had become very important.</p><br/><p>Cultivation, the higher it went, the more resources it needed. Trying to rely on an individual\u2019s power, it was far less realistic than using the power of the sect. Even roaming cultivators had their own little circles. Cultivators who truly secluded themselves were the rarest of the rare.</p><br/><p>Yan Le crouched down and flipped through the ling grasses Zuo Mo had brought, the joy on his face becoming heavier.</p><br/><p>\u201cLots of good stuff! En, en, third grade south wolfberry, third grade seven leaf chrysanthemum, woah, and there\u2019s also daystar grass, also third grade! This can be sold for a pretty good price\u2026 \u2026\u201d Yan Le seemed to be very familiar and recognized all of the ling grasses and grains.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo was in awe and hurriedly flattered: \u201cShibo is really great, you recognize all of these.\u201d Shi Feng Rong was the smallest of the four so Zuo Mo\u2019s address of Yan Le turned from shishu to shibo.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, in business, you have to recognize those.\u201d Yan Le felt very good about Zuo Mo\u2019s flattery. His originally small eyes became a line and he said amiably: \u201cAs expected of a ling plant farmer! To grow something, not just faster than others, but better than others. Shizhi has put thought in. All you planted are things easy to sell and at a good price.\u201d</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t know if it was that he felt guilt,y but Zuo Mo felt that Yan Le\u2019s gaze seemed full of meaning. Did Shibo also know about Elder Wei Nan?</p><br/><p>He forced himself to remain calm: \u201cShibo should also know just how poor this disciple is. If I don\u2019t plant something to sell, I won\u2019t even have the jingshi for learning about dan-making.\u201d</p><br/><p>He was very grateful for his zombie face. It really was the best disguise.</p><br/><p>Yan Le nodded: \u201cHaha. Without jingshi, you can\u2019t learn anything. You are a ling plant farmer now, don\u2019t worry about jingshi. As long as you keep farming, us elders wouldn\u2019t treat you unfairly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, of course.\u201d Zuo Mo smiled in agreement but his expressionless face truly gave others a strange feeling.</p><br/><p>Yan Le randomly picked two plants out: \u201cSouth wolfberry, and this gold-grain red tulip, don\u2019t sell it, you keep it. In the future, you\u2019ll use it in dan-making. I remember your master had especially asked me to help gather it for her. These two are easily sold but it\u2019s hard to buy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo hurriedly put away those two ling herbs.</p><br/><p>\u201cEverything else I\u2019ll go help you sell. What the sect needs, I will give to you according to the market price.\u201d Finishing, he took out a piece of jingshi to hand to Zuo Mo: \u201cThis is a piece of third grade jingshi. It\u2019s a down payment. Take it. I\u2019ll get your Li Ying Feng Shijie to send over the remainder in a few days.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo stared dazedly at the third grade jingshi on Yan Le\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>Third grade jingshi! This was the first piece of third grade jingshi that he had ever seen!</p><br/><p>Seeing Zuo Mo\u2019s dumb gaze, Yan Le couldn\u2019t help but start to laugh. He threw the jingshi at Zuo Mo: \u201cArlight, outside, don\u2019t embarrass me like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo\u2019s brain still hadn\u2019t managed to fully recover. Previously, he had thought that this harvest would be of some value but he had never thought that just the down payment was a piece of third grade jingshi! The wealth that dropped down from the sky pounded Zuo Mo into dizziness. He felt that his entire body was floating.</p><br/><p>He suddenly remembered another matter. Zuo Mo, who had been walking away, turned back and took out \u201cGreat Strength Pill\u201d: \u201cShibo, can you see how much this lingdan is worth?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Le took the lingdan and narrowed his eyes for an examination: \u201cYou made it? What\u2019s its use?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo narrated what Master had said.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll try to help you sell it. Everyone takes some time to accept new lingdan, I cannot guarantee how much I can sell this for.\u201d Yan Le said after thinking.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo naturally was very grateful. His purse being the fullest it had ever been, he completely forgot that he had thought of using great strength pill to earn jingshi. Even as he returned to the Little West Wind Yard, he was still muddle headed.</p><br/><p>Like a miser, he looked at this third grade jingshi.</p><br/><p>The color and intactness of a third grade jingshi far surpassed a second grade jingshi. All the edges were regular and complete, the entire body transparent and glowing without any signs of impurity. It was like a clear crystal. But the ling energy inside was extremely powerful!</p><br/><p>He gently caressed the jingshi, a drunken expression in his eyes.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, his hand seemed to have been cut by something, and the jingshi in his hands lit up unexpectedly. Zuo Mo stood, paralyzed, as he looked at the glowing jingshi. A strong pounding feeling rose in his heart as through something was going to erupt.</p><br/><p>The glow from the jingshi gradually faded, but the pounding in Zuo Mo\u2019s heart became even stronger.</p><br/><p>What was going on?</p><br/><p>He was slightly panicked.</p><br/><p>\u201cIdiot, you are entering zhuji!\u201d Pu Yao suddenly appeared with a mocking smile as he looked at Zuo Mo.</p><br/><p>\u201cZhuji?\u201d Zuo Mo couldn\u2019t attend to the disdain in Pu Yao\u2019s voice and hurriedly asked: \u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Why am I suddenly going into zhuji?\u201d</p><br/><p>Pu Yao shrugged his shoulders: \u201cWhen there is enough ling energy, naturally it is time for zhuji. You just had been stimulated by the ling energy in the jingshi so the ling energy inside your body, hm, woke up.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWoke up? What am I supposed to do?\u201d Zuo Mo didn\u2019t know what to do.</p><br/><p>Damn it! He hadn\u2019t thought he would get to zhuji so soon. He hadn\u2019t even make any preparations. He didn\u2019t know what was going to happen next, or what he needed to do. He had always felt that zhuji was far from him.</p><br/><p>Right, he could go ask the shibo! Zuo Mo hit his head and prepared to run towards the grey beaked goose.</p><br/><p>Under the shadow of the hair in front of Pu Yao\u2019s face, a blade-like curve silently appeared.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you want power? I have a method for zhuji, pretty good, guarantee you will successfully zhuji and your cultivation will increase greatly.\u201d Pu Yao\u2019s cool voice was filled with intense enticement.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo\u2019s footsteps stopped.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d Zuo Mo asked between his teeth.</p><br/><p>\u201cHee hee.\u201d Pu Yao pointed to Zuo Mo\u2019s hands with the third grade jingshi.</p><br/><p>As expected, this renyao didn\u2019t have good intentions! So he was aiming for his third grade jingshi. Zuo Mo was enraged and snorted: \u201cI should asked Shibo\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHee hee, zhuji, it\u2019s the first gate for a cultivator. But many people don\u2019t know that it\u2019s also one of the most important gates. It would directly influence your future cultivation. Don\u2019t blame me for not warning you. Using those zhuji dan won\u2019t be of any benefit to you~~!\u201d</p><br/><p>Pu Yao said leisurely.</p><br/><p>The pounding in his heart became even stronger. Zuo Mo felt as though his heart was going to jump out of his chest. Pu Yao\u2019s words landed in his ear but became hazy and intangible.</p><br/><p>\u201cHee hee, those shibo of yours. It\u2019s not that I\u2019m underestimating them but they can\u2019t give you much power. Look at your master, she\u2019s just not the opponent of the person that changed your features and erased your mind. How about it? I\u2019ve never cheated you. [Embryonic Breathing Spiritual Cultivation] is useful right, sword essence, oh, you\u2019ve reached the threshold! Me, I\u2019m very trustworthy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Pu Yao smiled gently, peerlessly beautiful.</p><br/><p>\u201cOne piece of third grade jingshi, this is really cheap. Just a piece of third grade jingshi. If you put some effort it, you\u2019ll earn it again. But the benefits you\u2019ll receive would be endless. Is there a business more profitable than this one in this world?\u201d</p><br/><p>The pounding inside his heart became even stronger. Everything in his vision seemed to become twisted. Zuo Mo felt that something inside his body seemed to have been lit up.</p><br/><p>Thirsty! He licked his lips and swallowed the saliva.</p><br/><p>He had a feeling that going to find Master now, there wouldn\u2019t be enough time.</p><br/><p>\u201cHere!\u201d Zuo Mo gritted his teeth and threw the third grade jingshi hard at Pu Yao. He wanted to smash this renyao.</p><br/><p>\u201cHee hee, the smart choice!\u201d Pu Yao easily caught the jingshi, his thin lips opening: \u201cHm, take that fire dragon grass to Cold Mist Valley.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFire dragon grass!\u201d Zuo Mo\u2019s eyes widened as he forced the words through his teeth.</p><br/><p>This guy\u2026 \u2026</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo wanted to cry. The kind of terrifying thing that was fire dragon grass, only terrifying people like Shixiong could tolerate it! People like him, there was only one outcome, that was, ling energy collapsing and death.</p><br/><p>Pu Yao\u2019s right eye curved into a crescent and reminded Zuo Mo: \u201cThere\u2019s not much time left.\u201d</p><br/><p>The feeling of burning inside his body became even stronger. Zuo Mo wanted to rip off the clothing. The blood vessels were like burning metal pipes. He was abnormally thirsty, abnormally uncomfortable! There wasn\u2019t much time left!</p><br/><p>Unable to care about that much, he took out the spirit travelling seal and pasted it onto his legs. All the ling energy in his body moving, he grabbed the fire dragon grass, and ran towards Cold Misty Valley like a ball of red clouds.</p><br/><p>He shouted inside.</p><br/><p>\u2013\u2013 Pu! You cursed renyao!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Normal time for next chapter.</p><br/><p>Chapter Two Hundred and Five War Chess</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere are we heading?\u201d Chun Yu Cheng asked uncertainly.</p><br/><p>\u201cJie river.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gongsun Cha\u2019s face was relaxed, half-lying on the bottom of the cabin, relaxed and idle.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d Chun Yu Cheng looked worriedly at Zuo Mo Shixiong who was still working on the date seed ship. Shixiong had been working for several hours and showed no signs of stopping.</p><br/><p>\u201cHa. Shixiong might look careful and conservative, but if he\u2019s pressured, he\u2019s vicious and decisive.\u201d Gongsun Cha said unconcernedly.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happens if Little Mountain Jie has been taken by the yaomo?\u201d Chun Yu Cheng\u2019s face was slightly pale. The strong offensive power of the yao army had almost destroyed his soul.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo way about it. It\u2019s all up to luck.\u201d Gongsun Cha stretched out his waist, and laid down completely.</p><br/><p>With a hiss, a silver light suddenly flashed outside the ship.</p><br/><p>Just having laid down, Gongsun Cha instantly sat up, eyes looking outside. When he saw the lightning outside the ling shield, he first stilled, and then had joy on his face. Chun Yu Cheng who was in a fragile state of mind was half-scared to death by the noise.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow\u2019s the power of that thing?\u201d Gongsun Cha pointed outside the ship, and asked Zuo Mo who had finally stopped and walked over.</p><br/><p>\u201cBetter than nothing.\u201d Zuo Mo sat down in exhaustion. \u201cMy skill in formations isn\u2019t enough. This lightning net doesn\u2019t have any dead ends but it is way too loose. Don\u2019t have high hopes about the power.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gongsun Cha nodded, and then asked, \u201cHow far have we travelled?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis boat goes one hundred li every two hours, how long has it been?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTwelve hours.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen it\u2019s six hundred li,\u201d Zuo Mo said. \u201cSeems no one has chased after us.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI wonder what this yao army is looking for. This is an unexpected calamity.\u201d Chun Yu Cheng sighed.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo naturally could not say the yao army was searching for him, but seeing Chun Yu Cheng\u2019s worried expression, he knew this docile person had been frightened too deeply today, and hurried to comfort him.</p><br/><p>The two shidi had two completely different personalities. Chun Yu Cheng was docile, and somewhat lacking in courage, only interested in animals. Gongsun Cha was the exact opposite. He was cunning and daring, calm when there was trouble, and had a devious and dark character. He didn\u2019t have much interest in butchering.</p><br/><p>\u201cFollow the flow.\u201d Gongsun Cha inserted and then raised his delicate face, his eyes shining, \u201cShixiong, there\u2019s nothing to do now. Why don\u2019t you get them to practice their cooperation?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo understood that Gongsun Cha meant the three golden armor guards.</p><br/><p>\u201cCooperation?\u201d</p><br/><p>Gongsun Cha\u2019s words reminded him. The blow that the yao army had given them was too strong. The troops that were so organized they were almost insane, so neat that it seemed almost impossible, and that lightning attack that they couldn\u2019t even hold their heads up against. Zuo Mo felt that he wouldn\u2019t forget it in his life. The shock and panic of the xiuzhe was the perfect definition of the word \u201crabble.\u201d</p><br/><p>Every time he thought of it, he felt coldness seep uncontrollably from his heart.</p><br/><p>The yao army gave all the xiuzhe on the Desolate Wood Reef a lesson.</p><br/><p>Even the stupidest person could see the difference between the two, and could feel the difference in power. Zuo Mo suddenly had a feeling, that the era of individual power was nearing its end.</p><br/><p>However, he quickly threw the problem to the back of his mind. A big problem like an era ending, it wasn\u2019t something a little ningmai like him could relate to. But he agreed greatly with Gongsun Cha\u2019s suggestion.</p><br/><p>However, while he agreed, how to accomplish it was the true problem, \u201cI don\u2019t know how.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe can slowly try,\u201d Gongsun Cha\u2019s decisive tone made Zuo Mo look at him. He grinned. \u201cIt\u2019s better than losing our lives.\u201d</p><br/><p>For some reason, Zuo Mo felt Gongsun Shidi\u2019s delicate face was like the raised head of a snake, vicious and cold.</p><br/><p>But when he turned his eyes towards Gongsun, Shidi\u2019s smile was so sunny and timid that Zuo Mo felt he was mistaken.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay!\u201d He nodded.</p><br/><p>Before having seen the yao army, Zuo Mo might have found it extraneous, but right now he didn\u2019t hesitate.</p><br/><p>This was useful! Very useful!</p><br/><p>For him, starting from a blank slate wasn\u2019t a new experience. Before, as long as he could make jingshi, he would work with all his effort! Now, Zuo Mo discovered that his little life was more important. His belief suddenly turned, anything that could save his little life, he would definitely put everything in!</p><br/><p>The two crowded together and started to discuss.</p><br/><p>Both were greenhorns, the mood was vibrant, but quickly, the discussion reached a standoff. Words had no proof, especially when the two had divergent views, no one could persuade the other. At this time, Gongsun Cha did not care Zuo Mo was his shixiong. His face was flushed as he argued, his expression ferocious, he no longer looked like a weak and bashful young master.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf we each have a troop and can really fight, that would be nice.\u201d Zuo Mo sighed, \u201cThen who is right, it naturally can be seen.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d Gongsun Cha\u2019s face was also bitter, holding his head and sighing. \u201cTalking soldiers on paper, it is useless.\u201d</p><br/><p>A voice suddenly came inside Zuo Mo\u2019s mind. \u201cWant to try? I\u2019ve got a way.\u201d</p><br/><p>Pu Yao suddenly came out.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat way?\u201d Zuo Mo\u2019s mind became alert. Pu Yao might like to boast, but he occasionally had some real skill.</p><br/><p>Pu Yao looked at him. \u201cActually, this kind of thing has been played since a long time ago, like Seal Soldier Battle Board, like Puppet Chess.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is that?\u201d Hearing those two new terms, Zuo Mo couldn\u2019t help but be curious.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is a kind of War Chess.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWar Chess?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s many ways to play, like one on one, or many against many.\u201d Pu Yao seemed to suddenly sink into his memories, refocusing after a while. \u201cI remember it was quite fashionable back then.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have those?\u201d Zuo Mo looked suspiciously at Pu Yao.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Pu Yao shook his head. \u201cThe most important part is the rules. It is very easy to make them.\u201d He threw a ball of light at Zuo Mo. \u201cHere, these are the rules for all kinds of War Chess games that I played before, and how to make them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHm, when did you become this kind?\u201d Zuo Mo\u2019s gaze became even more suspicious, but his hands were not slow at all, rapidly catching the ball of light.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to die this quickly.\u201d Pu Yao looked scornfully at Zuo Mo before disappearing.</p><br/><p>The date seed ship silently slid along the bottom in the pitch black water. For everyone, this was a very long period of boredom. Chun Yu Cheng seemed to be accustomed to this kind of boredom. He continued to busy himself in his experiments.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo occasionally took out the Golden Crow Fire. He seemed to be forging something.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo boring!\u201d Gongsun Cha yawned. He seemed to be the only person that didn\u2019t have anything to do. He had thought about teasing Silly Bird to relieve his boredom but Silly Bird ignored him, proudly strutting her bird walk in the cabin. Lil\u2019 Black climbed around the cabin without exhaustion. Lil\u2019 Pagoda floated in the air, spinning in its spot. The three golden armor guards were like three statues, not having moved a finger in days.</p><br/><p>Originally, Gongsun Cha had been worried they might meet some water element ling beasts. In the legends, there were many terrifying ling beasts in the Endless Ocean. However, their luck seemed to be exceptional and they travelled smoothly.</p><br/><p>But these days were really so bland.</p><br/><p>\u201cDone,\u201d Zuo Mo suddenly stated, making Gongsun Cha jump in fright..</p><br/><p>He crowded over. \u201cWhat\u2019s done? Hm, what is this? Chess?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEn, something called a War Chess,\u201d Zuo Mo said uncertainly. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I made it correctly. Come, let\u2019s try.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gongsun Cha, so bored he had almost fallen asleep, instantly jumped up. \u201cOkay!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo took out a jade scroll, recording down some of the rules that Pu Yao gave him and threw it to Gongsun Cha.</p><br/><p>\u201cHm, interesting!\u201d Gongsun Cha took the jade scroll. After a look, he became alert.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo also started to read the rules. Reading it in detail, he was instantly frightened!</p><br/><p>F***! This was that complicated?</p><br/><p>The dense paragraphs of rules made his head feel numb.</p><br/><p>He heard Gongsun Cha\u2019s voice full of enthusiasm, \u201cHm, this bit is interesting, yes, yes \u2026 \u2026 oh, I understand \u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo could only force himself to keep reading.</p><br/><p>An hour later, when Zuo Mo\u2019s eyes were unfocused and his brain faint, he suddenly heard Gongsun Cha say, \u201cSo interesting, so interesting! It\u2019s really too interesting!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo raised his head in shock. He saw Gongsun Cha look excitedly at him, and say, \u201cLet\u2019s begin! If I know there was something as fun as this, I wouldn\u2019t have learned how to butcher!\u201d</p><br/><p>What Zuo Mo forged was Puppet Chess. It was simpler. The size of the Seal Soldier Battle Board was bigger, requiring better skill at forging, and had more complex rules.</p><br/><p>Basically, Puppet Chess was made from a set of little illusions. In a circle one zhang wide, miniature mountains and rivers were perfectly depicted. There were even clouds in the sky that slowly changed. Suddenly, these white clouds started to rain. Under the rain, the water in the river suddenly grew. A xiuzhe wearing Taoist robes suddenly charged into the sky from the river, slowly scanned the surroundings. Seeing there was not anything, the person went back into the river.</p><br/><p>\u201cExquisite! Truly too exquisite!\u201d Gongsun Cha gaped, his eyes changing from excited to scorching.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo was also shocked by such exquisiteness. Even though he had made it from beginning to end, but he had never thought of the result of the end product.</p><br/><p>This wasn\u2019t some chess board, it was like a complete little world. Everything inside would naturally cycle on their own.</p><br/><p>So wondrous!</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo\u2019s mind became blank.</p><br/><p>\u201cQuick quick, how to play?\u201d Gongsun Cha urged.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo refocused and handed him a piece of third-grade Black Daze crystal. \u201cPut your mind into it.\u201d He also took up a piece of black daze crystal and flooded it with his consciousness.</p><br/><p>He felt the scenery in front of his eyes change, and he seemed to be looking from the sky.</p><br/><p>Hm, his eyes unconsciously looked down.</p><br/><p>Yao!</p><br/><p>Nine yao were arranged in an organized square. He could clearly feel the connection between him and the nine yao. He was even able to use the eyes of any of the yao to see everything in the surroundings.</p><br/><p>At the same time, the information of the nine yao flowed through his mind.</p><br/><p>His mind moved, and a yao suddenly stepped three paces forward, leaving the troop. He instantly controlled it to do many strange and awkward poses.</p><br/><p>So interesting! Very interesting!</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo was in shock.</p><br/><p>Translator Ramblings: What to do when you are bored? Play games. This is a road trip to a place they don\u2019t know.</p><br/><p>Pu Yao is very good at hiding since he found a spot inside Zuo Mo\u2019s sea of consciousness. He managed to evade Xin Yan and the others, then the people at the Sword Test Conference, and now the yao. At this point, it\u2019s pretty obvious that he doesn\u2019t like the yao that much. At the same time, as a commentator pointed out, he doesn\u2019t respect Zuo Mo as an equal considering how he just takes Zuo Mo\u2019s resources and uses them without permission. From our perspective as readers, we frequently side with Zuo Mo since we have the most knowledge about his state of mind, and there is a tendency to desire the main character to improve and win all the time. However, in a world where power is might, Zuo Mo is not at a strength that Pu Yao can respect even if he is greatly weakened now. From Pu Yao\u2019s perspective, Zuo Mo\u2019s primary skills in the consciousness and body cultivation is due to him giving/selling the knowledge to Zuo Mo. Zuo Mo is akin to a leech that Pu Yao needs at this point to survive but Zuo Mo is still so weak that Pu Yao dismisses him. His mindset has not completely adjusted to his present situation, and he is refusing to admit some truths. The change in Pu Yao\u2019s mindset will be an interesting one.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

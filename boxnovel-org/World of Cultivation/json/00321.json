A ningmai first stratum xiuzhe could just barely survive in Little Mountain Jie. Everyone was silent, but the Clear Sky Sect disciples conversed freely.</p><br/><p>\u201cThese days, no one cultivates five element spells! I heard that Lu Hui still hasn\u2019t responded, don\u2019t know where he ran off to. How is it possible to find a person that knows all five element spells so quickly?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLu Hui\u2019s brain has never been too bright. Qi ge\u2019s method is best. We can find some more people to get all five!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha \u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo heard these people chat as though no one was around. A low voice spoke to him, \u201cBro, what should we call you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMe?\u201d Zuo Mo pointed at himself, a face full of puzzlement.</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha, I see that this little brother\u2019s aura isn\u2019t ordinary and I desire to become acquainted with you. Sorry for the offense!\u201d The one who was speaking was a clever-faced middle aged male. There were seven or eight people beside him. They looked to belong to the same group.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo made up a fake name. \u201cI\u2019m called Wang Hong, what should I call you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis one is Liu Gui,\u201d the middle aged man bowed with folded hands, and probed, \u201cWhich side does Brother Wang live in?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo parried, \u201cAll over.\u201d He then pursed his mouth, \u201cAre these your brothers?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Wang has keen eyes!\u201d Liu Gui said with a smile. After this short conversation, he understood that he would not get anything out of Zuo Mo, and stopped conversing further. The expressions of those beside him were stern and didn\u2019t seem to be in the mood to chat.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t just them. All of the people in the surroundings had worried expressions.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo suddenly asked in a low voice, \u201cWhy is everyone so docile?\u201d He couldn\u2019t understand. There were just three Clear Sky Sect disciples, and they were able to herd almost twenty xiuzhe.</p><br/><p>Liu Gui was shocked inside. Just now, he had seen the person hide among the group with an expression of fear, but he had now asked something like this. He didn\u2019t seem to be a coward. He said without expression, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing we can do. They are from Clear Sky Sect.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo smiled and didn\u2019t respond.</p><br/><p>After a while, the more Liu Gui mused, the more he felt Zuo Mo\u2019s words contained hidden meanings. Seeing Zuo Mo maintain his silence, he couldn\u2019t resist and spoke in a small voice, \u201cWhat solution does Brother Wang have?\u201d</p><br/><p>Glancing at him, Zuo Mo said with a smile, \u201cWhat solution can I have?\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Gui increasingly felt this young person seemed high and unfathomable. Before, he appeared weak, but he looked calm now, and unworried. Liu Gui had met many people. He trusted his eyes. The presence exuded by this person didn\u2019t seem like an ordinary person.</p><br/><p>Was this a powerful xiuzhe?</p><br/><p>He flipped through all the famous xiuzhe that he knew, but didn\u2019t find anyone that was similar.</p><br/><p>Because he was too young!</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Wang looks very young,\u201d Liu Gui couldn\u2019t help but probe. \u201cYou look to be in your twenties, so young, yet you are ningmai, your talent is truly outstanding.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo only smiled, and didn\u2019t say anything.</p><br/><p>However, what he didn\u2019t expect was that Liu Gui\u2019s words had stirred the attention of his fellows beside him. Usually, most of the people that broke through to ningmai in their twenties were sect disciples.</p><br/><p>Men usually did not care much for their appearance. The price of Eternal Appearance Dan was not cheap. Very rarely would men spend that amount of jingshi. Consequently, it was hard to judge the ages of female xiu, but it was possible to see hints with male xiu. Zuo Mo\u2019s face was easily a very youthful face.</p><br/><p>However, the attitude that unconsciously revealed itself on his face had a maturity that surpassed his age.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis one is Zheng Zhong, their shixiong,\u201d the leader introduced himself. His words instantly startled the other disciples. They all raised their heads and looked with bewilderment at Shixiong. Even Liu Gui had a shocked expression. In their experience, Shixiong rarely spoke. This time, he had proactively spoken. They couldn\u2019t help but look at Zuo Mo.</p><br/><p>\u201cNice to meet you, Brother Zheng.\u201d Zuo Mo bowed with folded hands. He didn\u2019t dare to underestimate the other. His consciousness was abnormally sensitive. This Zheng Zhong had his eyes directed downwards but he was a ningmai third stratum expert!</p><br/><p>In Little Mountain Jie, ningmai third stratum xiuzhe were the top experts! Experts like these may not be able to oppose Clear Sky Sect, but they definitely were not people that a few Clear Sky Sect disciples could order about.</p><br/><p>Unless they had other aims?</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo became wary. He didn\u2019t want to have uncontrolled factors influence his plan. He didn\u2019t care too much about the earthly treasures in the secret realm, but he was very worried about Silly Bird\u2019s safety.</p><br/><p>That idiot\u2019s intelligence was pitifully low. As a bird, she was arrogant and outrageous. It would be a wonder if she didn\u2019t get in trouble outside.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle brother\u2019s skill is not ordinary, this one is full of admiration!\u201d Zheng Zhong said seriously.</p><br/><p>The other\u2019s instantly had shocked faces. They looked at Zuo Mo like they were looking at a weirdo.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo felt slightly uneasy as he became the object of attention, and hurriedly said, \u201cHa ha, what is Brother Zheng saying. This one is just a first stratum newbie, everyone, please take care of me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zheng Zhong did not refute it, smiled and lowered his gaze.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo\u2019s hairs rose at Zheng Zhong\u2019s smile. He decided to stay a bit further away from this group in case trouble occurred. He was now sure that these people were after the secret realm. He didn\u2019t care about the secret realm, he only wanted them not to damage his plan.</p><br/><p>\u201cShixiong, I cannot see where this person is outstanding!\u201d a shidi said though a secret language.</p><br/><p>They could communicate through a secret communication method that others were not able to detect.</p><br/><p>Liu Gui glanced over, and said through the secret communication method, \u201cI feel that this person\u2019s origins aren\u2019t simple. Look, he doesn\u2019t seem nervous at all.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zheng Zhong suddenly said, \u201cThere\u2019s killing intent on his body. He has recently killed at least four or five people.\u201d</p><br/><p>The others shook in fright.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo \u2026 \u2026 no way!\u201d a person stammered out. \u201cDoesn\u2019t he just have first stratum cultivation? How can he kill four or five people at once?\u201d</p><br/><p>Disbelieving expressions came onto the faces of the other people.</p><br/><p>It was hard to imagine a first stratum xiuzhe killing four people in succession in Little Mountain Jie. First stratum was the lowest level of power in Little Mountain Jie. In other words, every person that he killed wasn\u2019t weaker than he was. One person killing four people that were not any less weaker than he was, it was extremely difficult to do.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaybe he has a powerful talisman?\u201d one shidi said through the communication method.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t cause trouble.\u201d Zheng Zhong said in a solemn tone. \u201cThis person\u2019s strength isn\u2019t simple. Everyone, be careful.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo noticed these people occasionally glancing at him, and grimaced inside. Had he became a target of these people? That wasn\u2019t good!</p><br/><p>There were about twenty people in the group. Zuo Mo suspected that these Clear Sky Sect disciples had stopped every xiuzhe they encountered. He could occasionally hear these people talking, but those Clear Sky Sect disciples never controlled them.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>After flying for two hours, they encountered two more Clear Sky Sect disciples.</p><br/><p>One Clear Sky Sect disciple said, \u201cYou guys are too slow! Huang Shixiong has been waiting for you, and also Lu Hui. We don\u2019t know where he ran off to, not taking care of business, hmph, he won\u2019t get a share this time!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Clear Sky Sect disciple that had been herding the group said, \u201cThat\u2019s great. Maybe we can get a few more items each!\u201d</p><br/><p>The other people laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems you guys had a good harvest. Quick, Huang Shixiong has been waiting impatiently.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo\u2019s blood felt cold inside. These Clear Sky Sect disciples really had great pageantry. It seemed that they really thought of Little Mountain Jie as their backyard.</p><br/><p>The group flew into a little mountain valley. The mountain valley was heavily guarded by Clear Sky Sect disciples holding flying swords and talismans as though they were facing a great enemy. There were already about twenty or so xiuzhe that had been gathered.</p><br/><p>Huang Zhuo Guang stood proudly at a mountain peak, looking down at the xiuzhe, and asked in a deep tone, \u201cHave we found all the people that know five element spells?\u201d</p><br/><p>Huang Zhuo Guang had narrow eyes and long eyebrows, his nose was high, his chin slightly narrow. He was wearing a bright yellow ling armor, a deep red cape on his shoulders, a copper circle tying up his hair. His hands were wearing dark blue gloves, a pair of Eye Tiger Head boots on his feet, he looked extremely grand and warrior-like. He was the most outstanding of the second generation disciples of Clear Sky Sect, and belonged to the most powerful branch. He himself was the most favored disciple of Clear Sky Old Forefather, and undoubtedly the leader of the Clear Sky Sect disciples.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe still lack someone skilled in water element spells,\u201d said a shimei in a soft tone. She was wearing a goose yellow palace robe, her eyes full of seductiveness. She said in puzzlement, \u201cShixiong, why didn\u2019t we get the Outer Hall to assist us? Wouldn\u2019t that be more convenient?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Outer Hall?\u201d Huang Zhuo Guang snorted coldly and said, \u201cThat group of trash, they can\u2019t even defend Nan Sheng Village, how can they be relied on to help us?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh!\u201d The shimei was very shocked. \u201cWhat happened with the Outer Sect? Someone dares to make enemies with our Clear Sky Sect?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph! Who cares who they are!\u201d Huang Zhuo Guang narrowed his eyes, his voice was sharp and full of killing intent. \u201cJust kill them! After this affair, we\u2019ll go right back. Master had given the Outer Hall to He Xiang, I hadn\u2019t thought this guy who fail so badly! Master is in seclusion, as his disciple, it is naturally up to me to help share the burden.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shimei looked with intoxicated eyes at Shixiong, feeling he was extremely magnificent.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou there, which one of you knows water element spells?\u201d someone shouted at Zuo Mo\u2019s group.</p><br/><p>No one responded.</p><br/><p>A cold smirk floated at the corner of a Clear Sky Sect disciple\u2019s mouth, and followed, \u201cThose that know water element spells, stand up and help us. We\u2019ll give you a fourth-grade flying sword as reward!\u201d</p><br/><p>He raised the flying sword in his hand.</p><br/><p>This flying sword\u2019s shape was very unique, like the fangs of a monster. Its body was made out of a material that was stark white. From two to three zhang away, it was still possible to feel the waves of killing intent clearly.</p><br/><p>Such a vicious weapon!</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo was very shocked. This flying sword wasn\u2019t ordinary. Just the pure and keen killing intent was enough to make countless sword xiu crazy.</p><br/><p>As expected, the crowd that had been motionless instantly exploded.</p><br/><p>\u201cI know!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMe me me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Instantly, seven or eight hands rose up.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo also raised his hand. He wanted to see what this group really wanted to do. He noticed that Zheng Zhong also raised his hand. He secretly glanced around him, trying to match the information he got from Lu Hui\u2019s mouth to the Clear Sky Sect disciples he could see.</p><br/><p>His gaze quickly landed on the bright figure that was on a little mountain peak.</p><br/><p>The hero of Clear Sky \u2013 Huang Zhuo Guang!</p><br/><p>Translator Ramblings: Zuo Mo sticks out a bit to those who are more perceptive. Zheng Zhong is smart. Would one of the weakest cultivation run around in a lawless land as fat sheep for other people unless they had something to rely on?</p><br/><p>I miss Zuo Mo and his need for secrecy back when he was selling the yin fire beads. He had avoid being noticed and also used concealment methods. Now that he\u2019s gotten a new face which is less noticeable, and since there is no need, he hasn\u2019t used those disguises he used in the past.</p><br/><p>Thank you for all your comments. It\u2019s been a busy few days and I\u2019ve been spotty in replying.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

It created a giant cloud of dust. Yet before the dust settled, burning flames erupted out of the depths of the earth and swallowed the entire shen temple.</p><br/><p>The people watching exclaimed in shock.</p><br/><p>Shen Wu Hai felt his hand hurt and instantly woke.</p><br/><p>Fire? His vision was filled with red. A sea of fire? Why was he in a sea of fire?</p><br/><p>He flew into the air clueless. He instinctively escape this sea of fire. He channeled his ling power and flew into the sky.</p><br/><p>Midair, he felt his body cool which caused his mind to clear up.</p><br/><p>His body felt cool \u2026 \u2026 it was a very strange feeling \u2026 \u2026</p><br/><p>At this time, woosh, woosh, woosh, figures shot out of the shen temple debris. A dozen shadows appeared next to him.</p><br/><p>These people all swayed and their expressions were slightly bewildered.</p><br/><p>Shen Wu Hai was stunned where he stood. His expression became strange. Everywhere he looked, he saw white naked flesh. These people were not clothed, not even an inch of cloth.</p><br/><p>Wait, that cool feeling \u2026 \u2026</p><br/><p>Shen Wu Hai\u2019s face turned ashen as he looked down. What entered his field of view was a patch of smooth white skin. His naked body was completely exposed in the air.</p><br/><p>His head rang.</p><br/><p>The crowd of spectators were deathly silent. Shen Wu Hai swept across them out of the corner of his eyes and could clearly see the shock on their faces.</p><br/><p>Countless gazes gathered on his bare-naked body \u2026 \u2026 it felt cool \u2026 ..</p><br/><p>Laughter came like a tide.</p><br/><p>Pew!</p><br/><p>A mouthful of blood burst out of his throat. His figure wavered and he dropped down towards the sea of fire.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder!\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Shu\u2019s weak voice came from afar and became blurry in Shen Wu Hai\u2019s consciousness.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo was inspecting his spoils of war.</p><br/><p>The richness of the harvest this time surpassed his expectations. His grin almost reached his ears. Now that the shen temple was swallowed by fire, it had erased all the traces leading to him. No one would know that the masked person was him.</p><br/><p>But before this, there was much work to be done.</p><br/><p>Like the mountain of talismans piled up in front of him inside a formation.</p><br/><p>Among these talismans, many had imprints left behind. Zuo Mo had made a special formation to block the imprint. If he could not erase the imprints, then these talismans had to be hidden. Otherwise, he would just be waiting for the other people to come find him.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo knew very well just how powerful the people he had offended this time were.</p><br/><p>But clearing out the imprint was not a difficult task for Zuo Mo. He had the Great Day Banded Flame, the Greenvine Mystical Water, shen power, these could all erase the imprints.</p><br/><p>What he was struggling with was another problem\u2014how to prevent others from finding him.</p><br/><p>Supposedly, Tian Huan had many xiuzhe skilled in divination. These people could peek at fate. Tian Huan definitely would not swallow their anger at having such a major loss. Tian Huan would even take revenge more cruelly to tell other people what the outcome of being enemies with Tian Huan was.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo didn\u2019t want to be the chicken that was killed to scare the monkeys. He needed to hide his tracks to prevent any future problems.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, he had Pu Yao.</p><br/><p>\u201cDisrupt divination?\u201d Pu Yao rubbed his chin. The eye that was exposed slightly narrowed. The lips that were as thin as blades slowly curved like the gleam of a blade.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo nodded. \u201cYes, yes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Pu Yao suddenly turned to ask Wei, \u201cWhat methods do you have?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei glanced at Zuo Mo. \u201cSacrificial offerings, but it needs at least yuanying level souls.\u201d</p><br/><p>This wasn\u2019t a field Wei was skilled in.</p><br/><p>\u201cYuanying level souls?\u201d Zuo Mo asked hesitantly. He was suspicious that there was a problem with his ears.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Wei replied seriously, \u201cI only know this one method.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo unhesitatingly turned to look at Pu Yao. Was he joking, yuanying level souls, even ten of him could not kill a yuanying.</p><br/><p>Pu Yao smiled. Zuo Mo suddenly had a bad feeling.</p><br/><p>\u201cVery good, I like business deals that only has one supplier. I want a good price.\u201d Pu Yao\u2019s evil and sharp smile caused Zuo Mo to shudder.</p><br/><p>A good price \u2026 \u2026</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo said tragically, \u201cState your price!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou got pretty good things this time, oh, those bones, pity \u2026 \u2026\u201d Pu Yao was full of regret in his words.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo\u2019s heart suddenly jumped. He knew that Pu Yao was speaking of the bones he found in the Burning Shen Realm. He secretly noted it down. So these bones were the best things out of what he got this time! Did this guy want the ink jade bones? Zuo Mo\u2019s heart was insecure but when he heard Pu Yao say \u201cpity,\u201d his heart eased slightly.</p><br/><p>However, Pu Yao did not continue after \u201cpity.\u201d His tone changed, \u201cAll of the Sun Fruits, and one hundred Sun Seeds.\u201d</p><br/><p>Pu Yao looked smilingly at Zuo Mo.</p><br/><p>His heart just relaxing, Zuo Mo inhaled sharply and his heart jerked. Pu Yao\u2019s cut was really deep this time! It was fine for the Sun Fruits, but those one hundred Sun Seeds were extraordinary in value. Zuo Mo had gotten a good number of Sun Seeds but after this one hundred was paid, then the total amount would shrink greatly.</p><br/><p>But Zuo Mo knew that he could not give Pu Yao a chance to give another price, otherwise \u2026 \u2026</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo gritted his teeth and nodded heard, \u201cAgreed!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRefreshing!\u201d Pu Yao stood but no emotion could be seen on his handsome face. He threw a ball of light at Zuo Mo. \u201cTake it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo took the ball of light, and countless unfamiliar methods flowed into his mind.</p><br/><p>He hurriedly left the sea of consciousness and started to study it. At this time, he didn\u2019t dare to waste one moment. This was a race against time. The earlier he finished his defenses, the earlier he would escape the danger. If he was late, then no rescue efforts would help.</p><br/><p>In the sea of consciousness, Wei suddenly smiled warmly. \u201cYour negotiation was done well. It seems that I need to learn from you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are right.\u201d Pu Yao blinked his bloody pupil with an open expression. There wasn\u2019t any evilness on his face.</p><br/><p>The two exchanged a look and then disappeared separately.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>Wasteland Beast Chessboard.</p><br/><p>Nan Yue was furiously cultivating. Her eyes were tightly closed, her expression focused i her hands were placed together as though she was holding an invisible bow. Her [South Sky Arrow Art] had progressed quickly. Her rate of improvement was akin to travelling a thousand li in a day.</p><br/><p>The scenery around her constantly changed, and her hands changed positions as well. However, there seemed to be a faint connection between her hands throughout.</p><br/><p>Her consciousness was extremely unique and was like invisible water ripples. When the water ripples encountered enemies, they would quickly return with information about the other.</p><br/><p>The surrounding scenery that changed was both real and fake.</p><br/><p>Nan Yue needed to find the true target hidden among these real and fake yao arts.</p><br/><p>It was not the first time she had trained like this. In reality, she was trapped in this illusion almost every day.</p><br/><p>Ever since they had been introduced to Teacher Pu for instruction, they would encounter all kinds of strange training. Many people complained. Teacher Pu\u2019s training was ever changing but what made people complain was that each type of training was extremely difficult. Teacher Pu\u2019s temper was also fickle. If they did not complete the training, their outcome would be very bad. Many people couldn\u2019t help but feel anger.</p><br/><p>But Nan Yue did not feel any rage.</p><br/><p>Teacher Pu was far stronger than any expert she had ever seen. Compared to Teacher Wei, the teachers at the yao art houses were thousands of miles behind. Every cultivation illusion here had been created by Teacher Pu with a wave of the hand. The uncanny yao arts caused everyone to gape in shock.</p><br/><p>With this kind of famed teacher guiding them, what else could they hope for?</p><br/><p>Nan Yue did not slack off and became even more diligent. She knew just how rare this chance was!</p><br/><p>She wasn\u2019t the only one. Ming Jue Zi, Cang Ze, and the others all knew this and buried their heads in cultivation in fear of missing this chance. The elders of the Grey Clan also strictly supervised the members of the Grey Clan. Those that did not work hard on their cultivation were disciplined with the clan law.</p><br/><p>Selecting at the Wasteland Beast Chessboard as the cultivation area was done out of helplessness. Thankfully, the Wasteland Beast Chessboard was endless. No one noticed the corner they occupied. The number of people that could see through Pu Yao\u2019s illusory arts were pitifully few and they would not appear in the Wasteland Beast Chessboard.</p><br/><p>Just like usual, Pu Yao appeared in the Wasteland Beast Chessboard.</p><br/><p>\u201cSuch terrible skill!\u201d He looked down at the yao that were cultivating. His brow furrowed and he was dissatisfied.</p><br/><p>He had enough qualifications to give this judgment. When he thought about this, he couldn\u2019t help but think of Guard Camp and his mood worsened. Guard Camp wasn\u2019t highly skilled in his eyes, but compared to these greenhorns, they were much better.</p><br/><p>Right now, Guard Camp was in Wei\u2019s hand. Having been tricked, Pu Yao naturally could not accept this so he put his ideas onto Nan Yue and the others. Wei could not enter the Ten Finger Prison so he could not see whatever Pu Yao did here.</p><br/><p>Thinking like this, Pu Yao\u2019s mood instantly became slightly better.</p><br/><p>But when he saw these clumsily people practicing, what were extremely basic yao arts in his eyes, his good mood instantly evaporated.</p><br/><p>Pu Yao had been planning to use these guys to form another camp so he had initially trained them in battle formations. However, he quickly found that these people were extremely lacking in skills. With such terrible strength, no matter how much they trained battle formations, they could not catch up to Guard Camp.</p><br/><p>So he could only personally teach them yao arts.</p><br/><p>Even though the improvement of Nan Yue and the others was considerable, to Pu Yao who lacked patience, this kind of progression was not enough.</p><br/><p>He hadn\u2019t expected Zuo Mo to be able to enter the Sun Shen Temple and to obtain so many treasures. He instantly locked on.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo coincidentally came to ask for help so he had gotten his hands on a lot of Sun Fruits and Sun Seeds.</p><br/><p>The first moment he saw the Sun Fruits and Sun Seeds, Pu Yao\u2019s heart had moved. He recognized these two treasures. They were like the golden souls, and could be taken into the Ten Finger Prison.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is really a waste to use them on you lot.\u201d</p><br/><p>Pu Yao murmured to himself as the Sun Fruits and Sun Seeds in his hand flashed with an enchanting light.</p><br/><p>Translator Ramblings: The power of a monopoly, even the Scalping (Stripping) Zombie must bow before the forces of the market.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

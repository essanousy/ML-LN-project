But because they had been preparing to leave, all of them were unharmed.</p><br/><p>When Zuo Mo\u2019s shout howled out, all of Guard Camp suddenly shot into the air like a drawn bow string. With a few jumps, they appeared next to Zuo Mo.</p><br/><p>They had finished forming a battle formation in the air. When they landed next to Zuo Mo, they surrounded him in the middle. The movements was so dazzling that all those who noticed this scene had strange looks on their faces.</p><br/><p>\u201cFind A Wen and the others!\u201d Zuo Mo asked gravely, \u201cIs everyone else here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAll here!\u201d Shu Long nodded reliably. Behind him, several figures flew out and quickly found A Wen and the others.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo noticed Xiao Guo and Li Ying Feng among the group and Li Ying Feng was carrying Luo Li on her back. His nerves immediately relaxed. When he saw Bie Han and Sin Battalion, his expression eased further.</p><br/><p>But his brow quickly furrowed again.</p><br/><p>The black dots in the sky became increasingly clear. The battalion that was flying towards them was astoundingly large. From the scale, it probably had more than ten thousand people!</p><br/><p>\u201cBie Han, prepare to fight!\u201d Zuo Mo lost his politeness at this time and briskly ordered.</p><br/><p>Bie Han\u2019s cold face remained motionless. He nodded and turned to leave.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss Ceng! Please give the command of the Celestial Planet Guards to me!\u201d Zuo Mo said with a serious expression.</p><br/><p>Ceng Lian\u2019er did not waste words and shouted, \u201cShou Ping!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPresent!\u201d Shou Ping immediately came out of the ranks. Miss\u2019 battle just now had frightened him half to death and the reveal of Miss\u2019 strength had shocked him.</p><br/><p>\u201cFrom now, you will be under Xiao Mo Ge Daren\u2019s command. Anyone who disobeys will be executed!\u201d Ceng Lian\u2019er swept Shou Ping with a glance and said in a light tone.</p><br/><p>Shou Ping\u2019s heart shook and he responded respectfully, \u201cYes!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Ming Bandits! The Ming Bandits have come!\u201d In the sky, many mo stumbled as they landed. Their faces were ashen and their expressions filled with terror.</p><br/><p>\u201cMing Bandits!\u201d</p><br/><p>Great Peace City exploded.</p><br/><p>Even Zhu Ke and the others suddenly changed expression.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo saw Tao Xing\u2019s bloodless face. His lips were trembling and he was clearly extremely terrified. Zuo Mo asked, \u201cWho are the Ming Bandits?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tao Xing\u2019s throat was dry and his expression as grey as it could be. \u201cWe are definitely going to die now! Ming Bandits \u2026 \u2026 Ming Bandits, they are a group of lawless bandits \u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLawless bandits?\u201d Zuo Mo paused. At his side, some members of the Guard Camp had expressions of scorn. They had killed many bandits on their journey here.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe strongest bandits!\u201d The one who spoke was Tang Fei. At this moment, this handsome young woman with a ponytail had a trace of fear on her face. \u201cThey come like the wind, kill people and are extremely cruel. Their leader is called Ming Hui. This person is an astounding genius. Even though he is young, he is only a step away from marshal level. He has many experts under his command. They are all the elites of the other bandit groups that he has taken over. This person is extremely ambitious and is as sly as a wolf. He is someone no one wants to provoke!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo understood some of this. After a moment of thought, he said to Tang Fei, \u201cStarting from now, I\u2019m going to command your battalion!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Fei opened her mouth but did not speak. Tao Xing heard this and his expression relaxed slightly. He nodded repeatedly and said, \u201cGood good good! Tang Fei, listen well to Daren\u2019s orders!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Fei lowered her head and accepted the order. \u201cYes!\u201d</p><br/><p>At this time, Zuo Mo did not have the attention to spare for Tang Fei\u2019s willingness or the lack thereof. The Ming Bandits were coming quick and a hard battle would not be able to be avoided.</p><br/><p>Right now, anything he could get was something that he could use.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>\u201cMing Bandits!\u201d The middle-aged attendant\u2019s expression changed slightly. She raised her head to look at the incoming black cloud in the sky and gritted through her teeth, \u201cI will take you and break through.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can escape. With your strength, you should be able to break out on your own. If you take me, you will not be able to escape.\u201d Princess Xia glanced at her.</p><br/><p>The middle-aged attendant said lightly, \u201cWe have been mistress and servant for so many years. I had my own intentions when I started, but I watched you grow up into a young woman. No matter what, I will not abandon you.\u201d</p><br/><p>She looked deeply at Princess Xia and said, \u201cYou have done enough for the Anwei Family, you do not owe them anymore. If you want to take the opportunity to go into hiding, this may be a good chance.\u201d</p><br/><p>A thread of warmth flashed across Princess Xia\u2019s eyes. With her hand she combed her slightly ruffled hair. \u201cYou are giving up?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is probably fate,\u201d the middle-aged attendant said lightly. However, her expression seemed to be relieved of a burden.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have given up, but I do not want to surrender like this to fate.\u201d Princess Xia\u2019s smile blossomed and a differently light flashed through her eyes.</p><br/><p>The middle-aged attendant showed a hint of shock.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is crueler to forget the things that one does not want to forget. Compared to him, I am much luckier.\u201d Princess Xia raised her face and her eyes seemed to be shrouded in mist. She murmured to herself, \u201cIn these years, I have muddled through and accepted the arrangements of the family. It was not for the Anwei Family, but for Father. Every time, I would think that the Anwei Family was the blood and tears of my father, and I was unable to refuse their requests. Now, I have thought it through. Since I do not want to forget, I will not forget. In the past, I was struggling in my memories and was moved by others like a puppet. When I think about it now, that me was really lacking.\u201d</p><br/><p>Her beautiful face slowly lit up. She stared into the sky and seemed to say to herself, \u201cI have to become brave. The Anwei Family is the work of my father, and the best way to pay respect to him is to inherit his last wishes and make the Anwei Family prosperous. I need to stand up, and not remain down, I will not be a puppet, I want to become the master of the Anwei Family!\u201d</p><br/><p>The middle-aged attendant\u2019s gazed softened. She had seen how depressed Princess Xia had become after her father had passed away.</p><br/><p>She was silent for a moment before she said, \u201cI will lead you out of here!\u201d</p><br/><p>Her tone held determination rare to her.</p><br/><p>Princess Xia took her gaze back and smiled mischievously. \u201cI have a way.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have a way?\u201d The middle-aged attendant stilled.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>\u201cThey are surrounding us.\u201d Miao Jun\u2019s expression was grave.</p><br/><p>He was a gold battle general and had a broader view than other people. He quickly noticed the Ming Bandit Battalion that appeared at their flanks and rear. The other was trying to corral them in.</p><br/><p>This was the first time that he had seen the legendary Ming Bandits. His mood was as dark as his expression was. As expected of the Ming Bandits that were publicly recognized as the strongest bandits. From the initial charge to the maneuver to surround them, the transformation of the formation flowed like water. It was shockingly smooth. The troops looked unorganized but the murderousness that came with battle experience caused Miao Jun\u2019s heart to tremble.</p><br/><p>After seeing this group of terrifying bandits with his own eyes, Miao Jun finally understood why no faction was willing to provoke the Ming Bandits.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo grimaced. He could also see what Miao Jun saw. But his strength was completely drained and he had not recovered. He swept a look across Shu Long and the others. Their expression was normal but everyone had been affected by that sword strike that swept through all of Great Peace City. Their offensive capabilities were also affected.</p><br/><p>The Ming Bandit did not form a wall to surround them. Instead they were strategically dispersed maintaining appropriate distances between the groups of troops and did not expose any openings.</p><br/><p>Seeing this, Zuo Mo knew that the enemy was an expert!</p><br/><p>However, the Ming Bandits did not target Lin Qian\u2019s group.</p><br/><p>They were those who only bullied the weak!</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo cursed them as he threw lingdan into his mouth. He ordered Shu Long and the others to take the time to recover and receive the hard battle that was going to come.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Zuo Mo noticed Princess Xia\u2019s group coming over.</p><br/><p>\u201cI know you have a way out so I came to side with you.\u201d Princess Xia had a mischievous smile.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo grimaced. \u201cWhat way do I have?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what do we do?\u201d Princess Xia\u2019s brow furrowed as she looked pleadingly at Zuo Mo.</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if you look at me, I can\u2019t create a way.\u201d Zuo Mo\u2019s expression was one of helplessness, but the next words that came from his mouth was completely the opposite. \u201cHowever, no matter if there is a way or not, we have to fight.\u201d</p><br/><p>His tone was not resolute, nor arousing but a strong fighting spirit permeated from it.</p><br/><p>For some reason, Princess Xia immediately felt reassured. She smiled beautifully. \u201cI will let you take command of my guards. If I really die, it isn\u2019t much. We will live and die together!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCough cough cough!\u201d When Miao Jun heard this, he burst into coughing. Princess Xia was a beauty, and he felt he was unable to withstand her presence in that moment.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo was not affected by the \u201cillusory spell.\u201d His mind was filled with potential ways of breaking through the encirclement.</p><br/><p>He did not refuse Princess Xia\u2019s submission. In his mind, Princess Xia was his friend and he also owed her a favor. He thought and then asked, \u201cHow many guards do you have?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAbout three hundred.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGive their command to me.\u201d Zuo Mo did not waste words.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright!\u201d Princess Xia agreed without another word.</p><br/><p>A hint of admiration flashed through Zuo Mo\u2019s eyes at Princess Xia\u2019s decisiveness.</p><br/><p>Princess Xia\u2019s guards were quickly gathered and they were put under Zuo Mo\u2019s command. Zuo Mo immediately gave these guards to Miao Jun to lead.</p><br/><p>A gold battle general could not be wasted.</p><br/><p>The events that occurred after far surpassed Zuo Mo\u2019s expectations. It may have been that Bie Han\u2019s battalion had the advantage of numbers but many other people came to throw their lot in with him.</p><br/><p>Given their familiarity Zuo Mo could understand when the Lan Brothers came to him but he didn\u2019t understand why Princess Xin and Princess Wan also came.</p><br/><p>But at this time, he needed more manpower and did not refuse any of them. His request to all of them was the same, hand command of their guards to him. The people also knew the urgency of the situation and cooperated.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo had Miao Jun take command of all these guards.</p><br/><p>At this time, the Ming Bandits had finished their encirclement. It was strictly enforced and any mo that tried to break through were killed on the spot.</p><br/><p>The pressure created by the army circling the city was suffocating.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo felt extremely urgency. If the Ming Bandits attacked the city at this moment, then they wouldn\u2019t have any power to resist. What he could trust the most right now was only Bie Han\u2019s Sin Battalion. There weren\u2019t enough of Guard Camp\u2019s members here. A Wen and the others were lightly wounded and their strength was affected.</p><br/><p>Time! They needed time!</p><br/><p>Just as Zuo Mo was praying that the Ming Bandits would not attack the city so quickly, woosh, the Ming Bandit battle battalion suddenly pushed forward.</p><br/><p>The tangible murderousness filled the air and swept them like an enormous wave. Everyone\u2019s expression changed!</p><br/><p>Were they about to attack the city?</p><br/><p>At this time, something suddenly happened!</p><br/><p>Translator Ramblings: It never ends.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

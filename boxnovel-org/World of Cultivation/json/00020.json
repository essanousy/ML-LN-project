The benefits of consistently practicing [Art of Flora] was evident in the fluid motions of his fingers. This spell, which Pu Yao, called [Art of Concentrating Yin] was complicated but it wasn\u2019t too difficult for Zuo Mo.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo felt the yin energy in the surroundings stir. The energy was saturated with a dark and cold presence causing all the hair on his body to stand on end, but he gritted his teeth and persisted. The yin energy continued to gather in his hands.</p><br/><p>After the last movement was completed, a grey-white bead condensed in Zuo Mo\u2019s hands.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo curiously examined the bead, \u201cPu, what is this?\u201d The bead was a dirty white color, extremely plain, and felt cool in his hands.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is a yin bead, created through concentrating yin energy. It can be used in dan-making or forging. The effect is especially beneficial for yin attribute talismans,\u201d Pu Yao\u2019s expression was smug as he glanced at Zuo Mo disdainfully, \u201cThe yin energy in this place is very abundant. As long as you do not slack off, and make a few more each day, jingshi will naturally roll in. What I think is you should change your sect. I have never seen such a poor sect. In your sect, other than that shixiong of yours, everyone is just trash,\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo volleyed back, \u201cYou, a so-called Sky Yao that was wounded by my Second Shibo, you have the face to say this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Pu Yao snorted icily, \u2018If I hadn\u2019t been forged under the tower for three thousand years and my spirit terribly wounded, how could a jindan trash cut me?\u201d He was extremely disgruntled.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo followed with an icy snort, \u201cI finally understand how you became a Sky Yao,\u201d</p><br/><p>Pu Yao blanked, \u201cHow?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou boasted[i] about it,\u201d Zuo Mo couldn\u2019t resist and roared with laughter, pointing first at Pu Yao and then pointing at the sky, \u201cA yao, blowing up into the sky, becomes a Sky Yao! Ha ha ha ha!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m too lazy to even pay attention to you,\u201d Pu Yao wasn\u2019t angry. He spread his arms, and there wasn\u2019t any movement but the yin energy suddenly started to move. He was like the eye of a horrifying whirlpool, the yin energy in the surroundings to rushed toward him.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you sure that this thing is really worth money?\u201d Not paying attention to Pu Yao, Zuo Mo started at the yin bead on his hand and asked with uncertainty.</p><br/><p>Pu Yao, who had been enjoying the experience of absorbing yin energy, felt a vein in his forehead start to throb. His movements suddenly stopped and he almost choked in annoyance.</p><br/><p>Since Pu Yao said that the yin bead was very valuable, Zuo Mo held a trustful attitude. He decided to make a few more, but he found that all the yin energy in this area was all pulled towards Pu Yao. He couldn\u2019t manage to form a yin bead and had to move to another location further away.</p><br/><p>Luckily, there was only one path in the sword cave. Zuo Mo didn\u2019t need to worry about getting lost. After walking for a while, finding that he wasn\u2019t affected by Pu Yao any longer, he started to make yin beads. It wasn\u2019t too difficult to make yin beads. The finger motions were slightly complicated, but to Zuo Mo it wasn\u2019t a problem. In one go, he made about twenty beads before he stopped.</p><br/><p>After making the yin beads, Zuo Mo started to examine the surroundings. What aroused his curiosity the most was the blood river not far away. The river seemed to be composed of a sticky blood. There wasn\u2019t any sound of flowing. For some reason, Zuo Mo felt his heart tremble whenever he saw this silent river of blood.</p><br/><p>He picked up a rock from the ground and threw it into the blood river. It was as though the rock had landed in quicksand. It did not make a \u201csplash,\u201d it slowly sunk into the river.</p><br/><p>\u201cFor your sake, don\u2019t touch it. It\u2019s blood fiends,\u201d Pu Yao\u2019s voice suddenly came from behind. He said with some regret, \u201cPity I\u2019m not a blood yao, otherwise this would be very beneficial,\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are blood fiends?\u201d Zuo Mo couldn\u2019t help asking.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t understand even if I told you,\u201d Pu Yao never let a chance to mock Zuo Mo slip by. He scanned the surroundings and made a sound of surprise, \u201cRationally, such a cruel place, there would be some malicious spirits like devilings. Why is it so clean?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are devilings?\u201d Zuo Mo asked again.</p><br/><p>\u201cDelicious things,\u201d Pu Yao\u2019s bright red tongue couldn\u2019t help run across his lips, while an expression of yearning flashed across his face. After searching for a long time, he was slightly dazed and sighed, \u201cYour shixiong is really too honest of a person. He actually didn\u2019t even spare one of them. It looks like it needs to a while to recover,\u201d</p><br/><p>Refreshed, Pu Yao waved his hand at Zuo Mo, \u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d</p><br/><p>Finishing, he threw out four pieces of jingshi!</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo\u2019s expression changed dramatically again. This time, he didn\u2019t even need to check his pocket as he wailed grievously, \u201cPu Yao\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The white light rose and his voice stopped.</p><br/><p>Returning to the Little West Wind yard, Zuo Mo wanted to cry. Eight pieces of third-grade jingshi! Going there and back, so much was gone. Just like that half of all the jingshi he had earned by furiously making dan was gone.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look that sad,\u201d Pu Yao unconcernedly said with a face full of disdain, \u201cWhen you sell the yin beads, you\u2019ll get your costs back with profit. You really are trash. Just eight pieces of jingshi, and you are this distraught. You really are making a profit. Entering the sword cave once, it requires two jindan trash to both be present. Using eight pieces of third-grade jingshi to invite two jindan trash, can you get a better bargain than that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo could do nothing. He could only pray that the twenty yin beads he had made would sell for a good price. He knew that the yin beads could not be sold through the sect. The origins of the yin beads wasn\u2019t clear. If he aroused the suspicions of the shibo then no matter how many lives he had, he would still die.</p><br/><p>He decided to go sell them himself in Dong Fu.</p><br/><p>To not attract attention, he didn\u2019t ride the grey beaked goose; rather, he silently left the mountain. As he arrived at the outskirts of the mountain, he darted into the forest. When he came out, he appeared completely different. He had turned into a weak looking man with a waxy complexion. In Elder Wei Nan\u2019s jade scrolls, there were endless methods of changing appearances and concealing one\u2019s tracks. Zuo Mo had picked a method that wasn\u2019t very difficult.</p><br/><p>This was the first time Zuo Mo put on a disguise. He was very curious and found it strange.</p><br/><p>Right now, he was regretful that the Spirit Traveling seal had been burnt. If he had the Spirit Traveling seal, he could saved some time. His flying paper crane was too eye-catching so he could only walk.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>Even though his cultivation had increased greatly, his body was still very weak. Exhausted, he arrived at Dong Fu, after walking over the mountains and rivers. However, his thirst for jingshi and his enthusiasm won over his weariness. Almost crawling, he stumbled into the free market.</p><br/><p>With great pain, he rented a mini-room. Zuo Mo set up a shop.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo had been to the Free Market many times but it was the first time that he was selling something. He didn\u2019t think about earning a profit, he would be grateful if he could just earn back the eight pieces of third-grade jingshi. He put out a price of half a third-grade jingshi for each yin bead. He was very worried. He thought about how Pu Yao had boasted how good this thing was, at the very least it must be worth half a third-grade jingshi.</p><br/><p>Of course, Pu Yao was full of disdain towards Zuo Mo\u2019s conduct. He snorted coldly, \u201cThe honored yin bead\u2026\u2026\u201d The meaning was implicit.</p><br/><p>After six hours had passed. The last golden rays of sunlight shone on Zuo Mo\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is the jingshi rolling in? This is the thing you said was good? This is getting back profits along with cost? Honored yin bead!\u201d Zuo Mo was grieving as he demanded answers from Pu Yao. A whole entire afternoon, no one had even stopped in front of his mini-room. Up until now, Zuo Mo hadn\u2019t even sold one yin bead. He still had to pay the rent for the mini-room as well.</p><br/><p>Pu Yao also stared blanky. He muttered for a while, not knowing what to say.</p><br/><p>After a long time, his face was full of disbelief. He suddenly threw his hands up in exasperation, \u201cHow is that possible? This is the yin bead! Yin bead! After three thousand years, how can people not even want a yin bead?\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing Pu Yao lose his composure, Zuo Mo didn\u2019t feel the heartache as much anymore. He had already started to accept this cruel reality. He snorted coldly, \u201cIn the future, stop posturing like a Sky Yao. Look at the era, Sky Yao! Three thousand years, your things, they are relics, they have become obsolete! Understand? You made me excited for nothing. Hmm. After a while, ge will give it to the children to use as marbles,\u201d</p><br/><p>Pu Yao\u2019s expression was subdued. It was clear that this incident had dealt a harsh blow to him.</p><br/><p>At this time, a little girl passed by Zuo Mo\u2019s mini-room and suddenly stopped. Zuo Mo, who had been preparing to start criticizing Pu Yao again, suddenly stopped talking, and enthusiastically said, \u201cMiss, do you want to buy? This is a good thing, yin bead, completely formed from pure yin energy. Can be taken anywhere. Cool in the summer, and has the effect of beautifying the complexion\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The little girl looked like a maid. Hearing this, she laughed lightly, \u201cYou really know how to advertise,\u201d Her brow suddenly creased, \u201cBut these beads are too ugly. If it was rainbow colored, Miss Huang[ii]would definitely like it,\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss, don\u2019t just look at the outward appearance. The quality is very fine, look how round and heavy it is\u2026\u2026\u201d In order to make his very first transaction, Zuo Mo completely had no shame.</p><br/><p>Seeing Zuo Mo actually promoting the yin beads like marbles, Pu Yao stared with a wide mouth, his gaze dull.</p><br/><p>\u201cHa, since you\u2019ve said so much. I\u2019ll buy one,\u201d The little girl covered her mouth and laughed. She took out the jingshi and bought one. Before she left, she urged him kindly, \u201cI see you are a honest person. In the future, you should sell reliable things. These grey beads, no one would buy them,\u201d</p><br/><p>Finishing, she turned and left.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo collapsed to the ground. He had finally sold one, and it wasn\u2019t easy. Compared to him, Pu Yao\u2019s soul had been mortally wounded. His expression was dull, his complexion was grey.</p><br/><p>Seeing Pu Yao\u2019s state, Zuo Mo couldn\u2019t help but urge, \u201cIt\u2019s nothing. Just business. Next time, we\u2019ll sell something else. At the least, making golden crow pills isn\u2019t bad. Three thousand years have passed, you need to adapt,\u201d</p><br/><p>One person and one yao snuck back to the mountain.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2013</p><br/><p>In a small yard in Dong Fu Hall.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss, I\u2019m back,\u201d A cheerful voice passed out from the door. Yun Xia xianzi\u2019s little yellow bird flew up and rushed at the door.</p><br/><p>Yun Xia xianzi was embroidering a handkerchief and made a sound of acknowledgement, her head not raising from her work, \u201cYou brat, we just arrived and you instantly disappeared,\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha,\u201d A figure rushed in. It was the smiling and adorable little girl. The yellow bird flew around the little girl, chirping. The little girl said with a face full of helplessness to the yellow bird, \u201cOkay okay, Miss Yellow (Huang) , I got you something good to eat,\u201d</p><br/><p>If Zuo Mo heard this, he would definitely have spat up blood. The \u201cMiss Huang\u201d was really just a bird\u2026 \u2026</p><br/><p>Finishing, she took out a large pile of things and narrated, \u201cThere is the five flower cake from the Food Pavilion, the lotus and lily crisps, thirteen flavored sweets. This is the famous Old Wang liquor. Don\u2019t drink too much, otherwise Miss will discipline you again\u2026\u2026,\u201d</p><br/><p>The yellow bird\u2019s eyes were gleaming. Suddenly, it saw a grey bead. Like an arrow, it rushed into the pile and picked up the grey bead.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh, you like this bead?\u201d The little girl was very surprised.</p><br/><p>The yellow bird picked up the bead with its beak and flew ito Yun Xia xianzi, placing the bead onto her handkerchief.</p><br/><p>When Yun Xia xianzi\u2019s eyes spotted on the bead, she exclaimed in surprise and she stopped what she was doing. Picking up the bead for a closer inspection, her expression couldn\u2019t help but change slightly, \u201cXiao Yuan, where did the bead come from?\u201d</p><br/><p>[i]: chui is used as boasting, but also means being blown as in blown away by the wind.</p><br/><p>[ii]:huang also means yellow</p><br/><p>Translator Ramblings: Not all of Zuo Mo\u2019s ventures could be successful. The sword cave is also important.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

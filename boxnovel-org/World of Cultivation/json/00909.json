Her battalion had received a high number of fatalities. She did not feel any dissatisfaction. Bie Han was stronger than she was. She accepted the losses.</p><br/><p>But when she received Xue Dong\u2019s flying sword letter, she was stunned.</p><br/><p>Sect Leader had been defeated!</p><br/><p>Sect Leader had been defeated?</p><br/><p>How was it possible? Mu Xuan\u2019s first reaction was one of disbelief but it was Xue Dong had sent this message. She quickly accepted that this was the truth.</p><br/><p>Mu Xuan immediately realized this was an unprecedented danger!</p><br/><p>Wei Sheng was fighting his way to the main peak of Kun Lun. If he truly made it onto Kun Lun\u2019s main peak, then a calamity would descend on Kun Lun!</p><br/><p>The peerless Kun Lun had never been humiliated like that before.</p><br/><p>Damn it!</p><br/><p>Mu Xuan wanted to grow wings and fly back to Kun Lun yet Bie Han would not let them escape. If Mu Xuan showed any opening, he would take a bite.</p><br/><p>Bie Han was like a wolf, cunning and ruthless.</p><br/><p>Mu Xuan Battalion was heavily wounded. In a short span of a few days, more than a thousand people fell under the fangs of Bie Han\u2019s Sin Battalion. Worse was that a similar amount of people were injured. More off, Mu Xuan knew that Bie Han had deliberately left many with just injuries. Injuries had a greater impact on morale and reduced their mobility.</p><br/><p>Mu Xuan Battalion\u2019s morale was unprecedentedly low after two successive losses. Mu Xuan knew that she could not beat Bie Han in conditions like this.</p><br/><p>Right now, she was considering how to get back to Kun Lun as fast as possible. Kun Lun had been forced into a precarious predicament. The situation reversed so suddenly that even Mu Xuan felt clueless.</p><br/><p>However, Bie han seemed to guess her intentions. He continued to hound and harry them with little fear of retaliation.</p><br/><p>For the first time, Mu Xuan felt powerless. What should she do?</p><br/><p>\u201cDaren!\u201d Mu Xuan\u2019s second in command interrupted her thoughts.</p><br/><p>Mu Xuan raised her head.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet this subordinate take command of the rear!\u201d Her second in command spoke. She had a calm expression as though she was just describing a normal matter.</p><br/><p>Mu Xuan\u2019s heart shook. She looked at this partner that had followed her for over a decade. The other\u2019s gaze was determined. The two had grown up together from childhood, and were like sisters.</p><br/><p>\u201cFor Kun Lun!\u201d Her sister-in-arms\u2019 tone was serious and determined.</p><br/><p>After staring for a long moment, Mu Xuan suppressed the grief she felt. Closing her eyes, she used her last shred of will to say, \u201cFor Kun Lun!\u201d</p><br/><p>The second in command showed a gentle smile, turned and then left.</p><br/><p>Mu Xuan\u2019s tears flowed down.</p><br/><p>The sorrowful atmosphere filled the battalion. Everyone understood the decision of the higher-ups. The one thousand injured members and two thousand sword xiu were selected to stay behind. They would use their lives to to delay Bie Han.</p><br/><p>The cold wind cut like a blade.</p><br/><p>\u201cFor Kun Lun!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei Sheng flew holding his sword. His expression was solemn. Everywhere he passed, the sky and the ground seemed to be dyed by blood.</p><br/><p>The God-Killing Blood Sword seemed to have been filled with blood and its killing intent filled the sky.</p><br/><p>Wei Sheng\u2019s gaze was clear and determined.</p><br/><p>He could not count how many people he had killed in the past days. The sword xiu of Kun Lun leapt fearlessly towards him like a flood.</p><br/><p>Their strength was not worth mentioning, but their resolve caused him to change expression.</p><br/><p>But it only amounted to this.</p><br/><p>Wei Sheng\u2019s heart was like a stone. The sword oath he had given in the past echoed in his mind. He would not rest against Kun Lun, this would only end with death.</p><br/><p>To stop him, Kun Lun destroyed all the transportation formations along the way. However, this was not of any effect against Wei Sheng. God-level experts could travel through the void.</p><br/><p>When the Kun Lun mountain range entered his view, even Wei Sheng was awed by its vastness and majesty.</p><br/><p>Mountain peaks numbering in the tens of thousands like an endless forest of swords that stretched out. Each mountain peak was like a flying sword. They had different appearances and different auras. Some were steep, others vast plateaus, others covered in glaciers, or flowing with lava. Even Wei Sheng who had been to so many places was seeing such a unique place for the first time.</p><br/><p>As expected, Kun Lun was blessed.</p><br/><p>Wei Sheng lamented inside as his gaze landed on the main peak of Kun Lun.</p><br/><p>The main peak of Kun Lun was the most attention-catching of the tens of thousands because of its height and size. Kun Lun\u2019s main peak was unrivalled as it towered over the others. All other mountains were like molehills next to it.It was much higher and wider than the other peaks. It was like an enormous sword pointing towards the firmament.</p><br/><p>Peerless Kun Lun!</p><br/><p>The layers of jinzhi suddenly appeared. It added a beautiful layer of silk to the main peak that flashed with dazzlingly light under the sunlight.</p><br/><p>Was this Kun Lun?</p><br/><p>Wei Sheng\u2019s eyes suddenly became bright. While the main peak of Kun Lun had soul-shaking presence, the image in his mind was the little unknown and remote Wu Kong Mountain.</p><br/><p>It was not vast, it did not have any astounding power, it was not revered by countless people.</p><br/><p>But that mountain was the most important mountain in his heart!</p><br/><p>In the name of Wu Kong!</p><br/><p>Wei Sheng took a deep breath. His eyes were full of resolve as he raised the God-Killing Blood Sword.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s here!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWei Sheng!\u201d</p><br/><p>The main peak of Kun Lun shifted with people. All of the mountain peaks in Kun Lun\u2019s mountain range were full of people.</p><br/><p>Countless Kun Lun disciples had came from all over.</p><br/><p>\u201cFor Kun Lun!\u201d</p><br/><p>Someone shouted. Almost everyone raised their flying sword and shouted, \u201cFor Kun Lun!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFor Kun Lun!\u201d</p><br/><p>The thunderous shouts echoed in the air, in the mountains, in the hearts of every Kun Lun disciple!</p><br/><p>\u201cKill!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKill!\u201d</p><br/><p>Countless shadows flew up from Kun Lun\u2019s mountain range to cover the sky.</p><br/><p>They were like a burning sea of flames that wanted to use the fire of their life to burn that terrifying figure. Their faces were filled with fearlessness.</p><br/><p>Yet, unexpectedly, that person in the distance did not charge over.</p><br/><p>For some unknown reason, many people sighed in relief.</p><br/><p>But at this time, Wei Sheng suddenly raised the sword in his hand.</p><br/><p>Everyone stilled. Even the Kun Lun disciples that were charging towards Wei Sheng paused.</p><br/><p>What did he want to do?</p><br/><p>Wei Sheng was over one hundred and fifty li away from the main peak of Kun Lun. If they hadn\u2019t set up seal formation, they would not have been able to see Wei Sheng\u2019s figure.</p><br/><p>Was this a challenge?</p><br/><p>What was the use in raising the sword from so far away?</p><br/><p>Yet before they could understand, a red sword energy flew out of Wei Sheng\u2019s sword.</p><br/><p>That red sword energy was not blinding and did not look as though it was astounding in any aspect. But that seemingly ordinary energy cut the space in front of them as though it travelled through the void!</p><br/><p>The sword energy brought with it an endless ocean of blood!</p><br/><p>The surging waves of blood rose up like monsters opening their mouths and leading at them.</p><br/><p>These Kun Lun disciples were swallowed by the surging waves of blood before they could react. The waves of blood did not stop. They became even stronger and charged towards the main peak at an even faster speed.</p><br/><p>The vast distance did not seem to matter.</p><br/><p>Almost instantly, the surging blood red waves carrying savage power and steel resolve smashed onto the main peak of Kun Lun!</p><br/><p>Boom!</p><br/><p>The jinzhi of the main peak was like paper. Shattered energies of various colors flew through the air and then were consumed by the bloody waves. The layers of jinzhi that Kun Lun had worked to set up over the generations didn\u2019t even last for a breath before turning into dust.</p><br/><p>The waves that crushed all obstruction slammed into the main peak of Kun Lun!</p><br/><p>Boom!</p><br/><p>Time seemed to stop in this moment. Everyone\u2019s expressions were dazed. Their minds having gone completely blank.</p><br/><p>The vast Kun Lun main peak slowly collapsed before their eyes.</p><br/><p>Boom-oom-oom!</p><br/><p>The main peak was so large that when it fell, shattered stone and dust rose up into an enormous mushroom cloud. The roar caused all of Kun Lun mountain range to shudder.</p><br/><p>A deathly silence!</p><br/><p>It was completely silent!</p><br/><p>Everyone had ashen faces. Their lips trembled. Their expressions were dazed.</p><br/><p>The main peak, the main peak had been cut down in one stroke \u2026 \u2026</p><br/><p>All of the Kun Lun disciples had pale faces. Something seemed to collapse in their minds.</p><br/><p>The grieving screams contained the deepest of hopelessness!</p><br/><p>Wei Sheng had charged into Kun Lun and cut down Kun Lun\u2019s mountain peak!</p><br/><p>This astounding news swept the world like a gust of wind. Nothing was more astounding than this. Kun Lun, the strongest hegemon of the world. Had been defeated by one person, Wei Sheng had struck down the main peak of Kun Lun!</p><br/><p>Everyone that heard the news would be dazed for a while.</p><br/><p>People already felt that Lin Qian\u2019s defeat was incomprehensible, this event could not be described.</p><br/><p>Kun Lun had been the strongest sect of the world for thousands of years, the strongest faction in the world!</p><br/><p>No sect could match Kun Lun.</p><br/><p>Peerless Kun Lun!</p><br/><p>Kun Lun had not coined the phrase. The authority that Kun Lun had accumulated over thousands of years was imprinted on people\u2019s minds. The disciples of Kun Lun were always proud. Everyone thought they deserved to be proud. This was a pride that was matter-of-fact because they came from Kun Lun.</p><br/><p>They were always full of spirit and confidence. They were forever the most outstanding youths, the strongest sword xiu. They were the future rulers of the world both in the eyes of others, and they believed this in their hearts.</p><br/><p>Kun Lun was the holy ground of sword xiu.</p><br/><p>They created the cultivation path for the powerful sword xiu and developed it. The sword xiu became the strongest offensive fighters of all the xiuzhe.</p><br/><p>Yet this holy land for sword xiu was brought to its knees by a sword xiu from a previously unknown sect.</p><br/><p>For any sect, this wasn\u2019t just a great humiliation, it wounded them at their foundation.</p><br/><p>When a sword xiu heard the news, they could not speak. In their hearts, something seemed to silently collapse in their minds.</p><br/><p>Kun Lun would never be the Peerless Kun Lun ever again.</p><br/><p>The collapsed main peak and Kun Lun\u2019s peerless reputation became the perfect adornment for one person.</p><br/><p>There would be no argument in the future about the name of the Sword God Wei Sheng.</p><br/><p>Peerless Sword God!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

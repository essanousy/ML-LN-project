The first king of the mo. Just this name was enough to cause them to wet themselves.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it really true?\u201d Si Du stammered out.</p><br/><p>The other four locked closely at Zuo Mo as though there was a flower growing off his face.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course it\u2019s true.\u201d Zuo Mo smiled. He looked at Mo Ru and held the horn in front of her. \u201cIf you regret it, I will pick something else.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mo Ru furiously waved her hand. \u201cThis thing is a hot potato, only Grandmaster can possess it!\u201d</p><br/><p>The other four nodded. Mo Ru\u2019s words were not flattery. The Yin Tomb Guards were about to start fighting with Eastern Nether Mansion. No matter which side won, none of them would dare to offend Grandmaster. In Nether Realm where forgers were rare and valuable, one\u2019s head would definitely be wrong if they went to offend a grandmaster that could forge shen devices. In their view, the four nether lords would not do something so stupid.</p><br/><p>If Grandmaster wanted the horn, the four nether lords would not hesitate even if it was the true King\u2019s Horn, and not just the long horn of the first king.</p><br/><p>And this long horn had an astounding history but it seemed as though only Grandmaster would have the ability to forge it into a true [King\u2019s Horn].</p><br/><p>In these days, people believed in the power of battalions and experts. The Yin Tomb Five Ghost would not believe that one horn would be enough to conquer the world.</p><br/><p>The Nether King didn\u2019t have the horn and he still united the Nether Realm!</p><br/><p>In other words, it still depended on who had the stronger fist. But Mo Ru and the others did not want to be involved with something as troublesome as this. While they listened with great attention, they had no intentions of taking it for themselves.</p><br/><p>If this was in the past, they might get a reward if they gave it as tribute to Nether King. But the king had not been seen for a long time. It was unknown whether he was dead or alive. Having it in their possessing would bring a calamity.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo put away the long horn. He had great interest in it. The [King\u2019s Horn] of legend seemed wondrous. This long horn most likely was extraordinary. He was god-level and he lacked treasures he could use. While the talismans and shen devices he forged before were not bad, they were still lacking for him at present.</p><br/><p>The shen power of a god-level expert was not something that normal talismans could withstand.</p><br/><p>Lin Qian had the Immemorial Shen Sword, Eldest Shixiong had the God-Killing Blood Sword but he did not have an appropriate shen device. While Zuo Mo had pit Eldest Shixiong against Lin Qian in his mind, he did not have any assurances of when Eldest Shixiong would wake up. If Lin Qian came out of seclusion and Eldest Shixiong had not woken up, he was the only one that was a match.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo noted down this matter and his gaze swept across Si Du\u2019s collection.</p><br/><p>Si Du had pulled out a few more things after trading for the black sand. Things that this person kept to the end were good things. Zuo Mo\u2019s gaze swept across a stone figure, and his head jumped. This stone was about the size of his fist, and there were countless black and white rings moved around the surface of the stone. These rings were of various sizes that gathered and spread apart.</p><br/><p>Yinyang Ring Stone!</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo unhesitatingly chose it.</p><br/><p>Si Du felt slight pain but he sighed in relief. The Yinyang Ring Stone was unique, but for Si Du that was primarily focused on poisons, it was not as useful as the other items.</p><br/><p>Everyone took what they needed.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow long will Grandmaster take to forge shen equipment?\u201d Si Du couldn\u2019t resist asking.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo thought. \u201cYou five are all different, and the time will be different, but it will be no later than a month.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing Zuo Mo give the deadline of a month, the five were satisfied. Eastern Nether Mansion would need time to gather the troops to attack the Ten Thousand Tombs of the Underworld. The Yin Tomb Guards were on the defensive and these five did not need to worry about the initial clashes.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen we will bid you farewell.\u201d Si Du bid farewell to Zuo Mo. He desperately needed to find a place to refine the nether sand he just obtained. Recovering from his wounds was the right choice at this time.</p><br/><p>The others also bid farewell. With a great battle coming, they needed to prepare many things. They each lead a battalion and they were busy.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo did not keep them. He also had many matters to attend to.</p><br/><p>He decided to forge pseudo-shen devices for the five that were like the Angel Device Raiment. With his present cultivation, forging pseudo-shen devices were not difficult for him.</p><br/><p>His success rate at the Weapon Layering Craftsmanship was astounding high. This was an advantage of his cultivation.</p><br/><p>The three hundred items of shen equipment could not satisfy the Ghost Lord\u2019s need. The problem now was that the material supply could not keep up with Zuo Mo\u2019s forging speed. Almost all the warehouses were furiously transporting materials to the Fire Cemetery.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo planned to go to the Sea of Ten Thousand Boiling Pools.</p><br/><p>This time, he went alone without notifying anyone else.</p><br/><p>The Sea of Ten Thousand Boiling Pools were astounding. Zuo Mo sneaked in and followed the direction from last time and walked towards the death eye.</p><br/><p>He noticed the three hundred articles of shen equipment had been placed into the Sea of Ten Thousand Boiling Pools to be nourished. Each piece of shen equipment was absorbing death energy. Little whirlpools appeared over the Sea of Ten Thousand Boiling Pools. Each shen equipment was being heavily guarded.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo carefully avoided the crowds and moved silently in the grey death energy.</p><br/><p>He soon was able to feel clearly that the death energy ahead was much thicker. He became alert. He was about to reach the death eye soon. After moving forward for about fifteen minutes, Zuo Mo felt the surrounding death energy was eight times as dense as before.</p><br/><p>The death energy here was astounding thick. Zuo Mo\u2019s heart trembled.</p><br/><p>If he was not god-level, a normal expert would see all kinds of illusions in such thick death energy. The death energy would corrode their bodies. No wonder no one dared to come to the death eye. Even Zuo Mo felt that the death energy was bone-chillingly cold.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo\u2019s speed slowed. After moving about ten li further, the surrounding death energy was so thick it was tangible.</p><br/><p>With every step, he felt his vision seemed to shake. Countless evil ghosts and thoughts came at him, and illusions sprouted out.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo\u2019s expression became stern. He felt a great pressure.</p><br/><p>Woosh!</p><br/><p>The sun shen fire erupted out of his body. The evil ghosts immediately wailed when they touched the sun shen fire. However, the sticky death energy seemed to be enraged by the sun shen fire. They roared and roiled as waves of death energy moved towards Zuo Mo.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo\u2019s expression changed slightly. What kind of place was the death eye that it would have such a great concentration of death energy?</p><br/><p>He had never heard of a place with such a great concentration of death energy.</p><br/><p>Feeling the great power coming through the roiling death energy, Zuo Mo shook his head. This place was not one he could come to at present. Unless his body completely recovered, and his shen power was replenished, he would not be able to advance.</p><br/><p>It seemed that he could only come back after recovering.</p><br/><p>However, Zuo Mo did not plan on leaving empty handed. The thick sticky death energy here was a very good material by themselves.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo\u2019s hands grabbed at the air.</p><br/><p>Moments later, more than fifty beads formed from death energy appeared in his hands. The beads were grey. If one looked at the surface, they would be unconsciously sucked in.</p><br/><p>These death energy beads were of rare quality.</p><br/><p>After forming fifty death energy beads in succession, a hint of exhaustion flashed across Zuo Mo\u2019s face. He was startled. The death energy here was so thick it was incomprehensible! Forming the fifty death energy beads took more effort than forging three hundred articles of shen equipment!</p><br/><p>It really was a strange place!</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo noted it down and put the death energy beads back in his ring. Then he went back along the way he came. This time, he still gained something. The fifty high quality death energy beads were a considerable profit.</p><br/><p>Coming out the Sea of Ten Thousand Boiling Pools, Zuo Mo returned to his residence.</p><br/><p>He sat for a whole day before recovering. Opening his eyes, he played with the death energy beads in his hands. He remembered the thought he had before and stood up to walk towards the back of the yard.</p><br/><p>Arriving in front of the five shen wood coffins. As expected, the death energy in five death energy pools were halved.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo thought and then took out a death energy bead to throw into one of the death energy pools.</p><br/><p>Boom!</p><br/><p>Surging death energy erupted.</p><br/><p>The shen wood coffins suddenly lit up and started to absorb the death energy that had come out. Zuo Mo touched a shen wood coffin and closed his eyes. The death energy was quickly permeating inside the coffin. Because the death energy was in high concentration, after it met the vitality of the shen wood coffin, the base shen power produced was three times stronger than before.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo became excited.</p><br/><p>The conclusion he made after repeated consideration in these past days was that enough base shen power would allow everyone to wake up. The base shen power was unique. It could permeate all things and nourish people from the root.</p><br/><p>Everything was developing in a good direction. The future was filled with hope.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo pulled out what he had gained today. The marked poison stone could only be given to the flower yao after he returned to Mo Cloud Sea. The dragon heart was for Eldest Shixiong. The jade skeleton for Lan.</p><br/><p>The ghost fire flickered in his hand. He was silent. When he obtained the ghost fire, he just had the beginnings of a thought, but the idea was still unclear.</p><br/><p>At this time, the female within the ghost fire suddenly appeared. She bowed when she saw Zuo Mo. \u201cGrandmaster!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo stilled and then his thoughts were pulled back. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCould Grandmaster bestow a death energy bead to this servant?\u201d the female shadow said honestly. \u201cIf Grandmaster could bestow a death energy bead, this servant will be able to stabilize my body, and grow stronger. This servant is willing to be controlled by Grandmaster!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh!\u201d A look flashed through Zuo Mo\u2019s eyes. After a moment of silence, he threw over a death energy bead. \u201cHere!\u2019</p><br/><p>The ghost fire female was overjoyed. The ghost fire flickered and wrapped around the death energy bead.</p><br/><p>The green ghost fire immediately had a faint tinge of grey.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis servant needs multiple days to absorb the death energy. Grandmaster, please forgive me.\u201d The female figure wavered.</p><br/><p>\u201cGo,\u201d Zuo Mo said.</p><br/><p>The female figure bowed again and then disappeared.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo thought to himself and then put the ghost fire back in the ring. He took out something else. The Yinyang Ring Stone! When Zuo Mo saw this item, the first person he thought of was Luo Li. Yin and yang coexisted on this stone. If this stone was forged into a flying sword, the best form would be two swords chained together, and would be most suitable for Luo Li and Wo Li.</p><br/><p>As Zuo Mo\u2019s understanding of life and death increased, he saw the connection between Wo Li and Luo Li more clearly. If Wo Li did not die, then Luo Li would not perish. The two were truly a pair that would live and die together. If this stone could be forged into a Yinyang Paired Chain Swords, when the two woke up, their power would go up another level.</p><br/><p>Carefully putting the Yinyang Ring Stone away, Zuo Mo picked up his biggest gain of the day. The long horn, the horn of the first mo king.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo\u2019s hand caressed the patterns on the surface of the first mo king\u2019s horn. He took a deep breath and his mind slowly sank into it.</p><br/><p>Translator Ramblings: Prezzies for you, and you, and you!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

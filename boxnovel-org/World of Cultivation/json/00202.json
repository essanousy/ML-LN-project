Chun Yu Cheng named this multi-colored butterfly Rainbow Mark Butterfly, it was the most outstanding ling beast he had ever raised up until now.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo could feel an extremely weak presence come from the Rainbow Mark Butterfly. The thoughts were very weak, and there were many images that were indistinct. This was a characteristic unique to low level ling beasts. The higher the grade of the ling beast, the more intelligent it would be. High level ling beasts were not much different than xiuzhe.</p><br/><p>This Rainbow Mark Butterfly was only third-grade, and its intelligence just forming. Naturally, there would be many messages that Zuo Mo could not understand.</p><br/><p>However, it could accurately understand Zuo Mo\u2019s orders and was very obedient. The beast pool had been constructed to make jingshi. He had never thought that he wouldn\u2019t lack for jingshi now. So the batch of ling butterflies had been turned from a business product into for their own use.</p><br/><p>The Rainbow Mark Butterfly was the most outstanding of the three ling butterflies. It had three spells: Rainbow Pupils, Illusion Poison, Poison Change.</p><br/><p>He ordered the Rainbow Mark Butterfly to cast the Rainbow Pupils. The Rainbow Mark Butterly lightly fluttered its wings, a rainbow light landed on Zuo Mo\u2019s body. His eyes were suddenly covered in a layer of faint five-colored light. Zuo Mo felt the world in front of him change.</p><br/><p>Everything he saw was grey-white.</p><br/><p>The silently masticating Rainbow Mark Butterfly communicated before Zuo Mo understood. The so-called Rainbow Pupil was to detect poison. It could detect the danger of poisonous items.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo did not cultivate poison so the spell was not very useful for him. The only place he could use it was in dan-making.</p><br/><p>Compared to Rainbow Pupil, Illusion Poison was much more interesting. Illusion Poison was to use poison to create illusion. Zuo Mo was very interested. He instantly thought of the uses for this spell. If he secretly fortified a few places of his formation with illusion poison, then no one would detect it.</p><br/><p>However, the spell most important to Zuo Mo was the third spell \u2013 poison change! Rather than calling it a spell, poison change was more like a talent. According to Chun Yu Cheng\u2019s explanation, if he kept on feeding the Rainbow Mark Butterfly poison, especially high-grade poison, when it reached a certain level, it could cause the Rainbow Mark Butterfly to transform and enter a higher grade.</p><br/><p>As the grade increased, the intelligence of a ling beast would increase, and there was a possibility of the addition of a spell. It was a pity that Zuo Mo did not have any interest in poison, much less high-grade poison.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Zuo Mo smacked his forehead. How did he forget that? Didn\u2019t his Inky Black Lava White Fire have a deadly poison? That was the poison obtained by processing a fourth-grade Inky Black Lotus Seed.</p><br/><p>The grade of the Inky Black Lotus Fire was too low. Zuo Mo had decided to use the Golden Crow Fire as the primary one. It was perfect for him to split the fire apart. The poison for the Rainbow Mark Butterfly, the fire for Lil\u2019 Pagoda. Even though the grade of the Inky Black Lava White Fire was not high, but it was still a fire seed, and quite pure.</p><br/><p>But before that, Zuo Mo still needed to do one thing: forge the Blue Ice sword. The Blue Icicle Crystal could only be forged with a cold fire. The grade of the Golden Crow Fire was higher, but the attribute was not correct.</p><br/><p>The Blue Icicle Crystal sword billet was about half a chi long, its body shaped like a prism. When the light reflected on the facets of the prism, it was very beautiful.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>Three days later, the Blue Ice Sword took form!</p><br/><p>The entire body was like a blue icicle, the tip of the sword extremely sharp. The body of the sword was made out of countless facets. As it floated in the air, a mist naturally formed around the sword.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo\u2019s mind moved. Pew, the Blue Ice Sword entered the ground, only leaving behind a sword shaped hole. There was a circle of clear ice cracks around the hole. It could be seen just how cold it was.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo\u2019s forging skill was not high and the Blue Ice Crystal was just lower fourth-grade. The grade of the Inky Black Lava White Fire was also too low. He had barely managed to forge a fourth-grade flying sword.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t care that much. The five essence sword set emphasized the cooperation between the different qualities of the flying swords.</p><br/><p>Taking apart the Inky Black Lava White Fire, however, had taken Zuo Mo quite a bit of effort. The poison from the Inky Black Lotus had long ago merged into the flame. Zuo Mo did not have the strength at his cultivation level to take it apart. However, he thought of a clever solution, let Lil\u2019 Pagoda deconstruct it.</p><br/><p>The present Lil\u2019 Pagoda only needed a bit to break through to fourth-grade, its control greatly increased. It could control how to decompose what was put into it.</p><br/><p>The Inky Black Lava White Fire was quickly taken apart. The Inky Black Lotus poison was separated out. What surprised Zuo Mo was that this ball of Inky Black Lotus poison was an invisible substance. When he used ling power to carefully surround this deadly poison, he was instantly alarmed. His ling power was quickly consumed.</p><br/><p>As expected from a fourth-grade Inky Black Lotus\u2019 poison!</p><br/><p>This discovery made him hesitate. Could the Rainbow Mark Butterfly tolerate such a strong poison? But quickly, he could feel the Rainbow Mark Butterfly\u2019s anticipation and joy. The Rainbow Mark Butterfly lightly flapped its multi-colored wings, and a circle of light surrounded the poison.</p><br/><p>The ring of light continuously shrunk until it disappeared.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo was slightly disappointed. A line of black had appeared on the wings of the Rainbow Mark Butterfly, but there was no other change. Lil\u2019 Pagoda absorbed the fire seed, but there were no signs of another breakthrough.</p><br/><p>Alright, he could not be too greedy, Zuo Mo mumbled.</p><br/><p>He started to absorb the Golden Crow Fire.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>The atmosphere of the Desolate Wood Reef was nervous and fretful. Everyone\u2019s face was slightly heavy. A few days ago, several xiuzhe had escaped from the jie river.</p><br/><p>They had encountered a group of very strong xiuzhe. That group killed everyone they saw. Many xiuzhe didn\u2019t even have the time to flee before they were killed.</p><br/><p>Instantly, the Desolate Wood Reef became tense. These injured xiuzhe had no strength to fly over the Endless Ocean, and could only stay on the Desolate Wood Reef. Those xiuzhe that had originally planned to travel to Little Mountain Jie through the jie river didn\u2019t dare to move recklessly, and waited to see what would happen.</p><br/><p>The number of xiuzhe on the Desolate Wood Reef increased, but no one dared to cause a disturbance. Other than the intimidation of the three golden armor guards, they also understood, if there really was a powerful enemy, the formation on the island was their strongest defense.</p><br/><p>Without the beast pool, Chun Yu Cheng was idle. His face was full of worry. \u201cThere\u2019s more than six hundred xiuzhe on the island, and more than twenty ningmai. If something happens, that wouldn\u2019t be good. Shixiong is also in seclusion \u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you afraid of?\u201d Gongsun Cha was unconcerned and said heartlessly, \u201cWorst case, we can just flee.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you think the people in the jie river are? Killing everyone they see! They really have no regard for the law!\u201d Chun Yu Cheng was righteously indignant.</p><br/><p>Gongsun Cha teased the grey butterfly and said lazily, \u201cWho knows, probably a group of people who couldn\u2019t think things through.\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly, the crowd on the island shifted. The two instantly stopped what they were doing and stood up.</p><br/><p>Far away in the sky, there were many black dots.</p><br/><p>Chun Yu Cheng inhaled sharply, his face pale, voice trembling as he pointed at the black dots in the sky. \u201cWhat\u2026 \u2026 what is that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Gongsun Cha also was motionless at his spot with a shocked expression.</p><br/><p>The dense crowd of black dots flew at the Desolate Wood Reef at astonishing speed like a black cloud rolling over the sky. With a suffocating presence, they silently moved to a distance twenty li from the Desolate Wood Reef.</p><br/><p>\u201cYao \u2026 \u2026 yaomo \u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Someone trembled out those two words. It was as though a spark had been thrown into a pot of oil. The deathly silent Desolate Wood Reef suddenly exploded.</p><br/><p>\u201cYaomo \u2026 \u2026\u201d Chun Yu Cheng felt his legs sore and weak, dropping to the ground.</p><br/><p>There were hints of terror in Gongsun Cha\u2019s eyes, but the terror was quickly changed to curiosity.</p><br/><p>Was this yaomo?</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t just him that had this thought. In reality, this thought uncontrollably flashed across many people\u2019s minds on the Desolate Wood Reef.</p><br/><p>Other than the somewhat strange dark green skin, the yaomo in the sky didn\u2019t seem much different than xiuzhe. On their foreheads, they all had a piece of crystal, the color and shape varied. Their bodies were mostly slender and were very handsome regardless of sex.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is yaomo? Wow!\u201d Gongsun Cha tsked. He rubbed his chin, \u201cOh, almost as handsome as me, that\u2019s not very good.\u201d</p><br/><p>However, he quickly became speechless.</p><br/><p>The yaomo in the sky quickly moved forward three li.</p><br/><p>Everyone was intimidated.</p><br/><p>People now found that the dark-green skinned yaomo in the sky were in well-organized ranks that seemed to have been measured with a ruler. During the flying process, the entire troop did not have any hint of disorder, they were so synchronized that it was frightening.</p><br/><p>When several dozen people were so, everyone would find it to be nothing, but when thousands of people were so organized, an invisible pressure formed. It was as if there was a thousand-catty rock on everyone\u2019s chest. All the noise stopped, like someone had cut their throats.</p><br/><p>\u201cReally the elite!\u201d Gongsun Cha\u2019s eyes glowed as he muttered. He then looked in sympathy at the panicking xiuzhe on the island, and couldn\u2019t help but sigh, \u201cAnd there go the rabble!\u201d</p><br/><p>The contrast between the two sides was too strong. Of the thousands of people on the other side, no one was speaking, it was deathly silent. The xiuzhe on the island was panicking like a crowd of headless chickens.</p><br/><p>\u201cPrepare to run for your life,\u201d Gongsun Cha said to Chun Yu Cheng.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about Shixiong?\u201d Chun Yu Cheng asked, his expression blank.</p><br/><p>\u201cFind him.\u201d Gongsun Cha said.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m here,\u201d At some unknown time, Zuo Mo appeared behind the two of them.</p><br/><p>\u201cEscape,\u201d Gongsun Cha spread his hands at Zuo Mo.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo grimaced. He hadn\u2019t thought that he would encounter this just after he came out of seclusion. He knew that Gongsun Cha was right. Even though the island had six hundred xiuzhe, it was just a grab-bag of random cultivators.</p><br/><p>Looking at the military troop that was so terrifyingly organized, a hint of helplessness rose in Zuo Mo\u2019s heart. The difference in power was not something a formation could bridge.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it really yaomo?\u201d Chun Yu Cheng was still somewhat lost. Gongsun Cha looked in curiosity at Zuo Mo.</p><br/><p>\u201cEn, yao, not mo,\u201d Zuo Mo nodded, \u201cMostly Ghost Attendant Yao and some Night Stock Yao.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGhost Attendant Yao? Night Stock Yao?\u201d Gongsun Cha had an interested expression. To them, yaomo was a very distant monster.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe most basic yao are called little yao, about our lianqi. The next level is Ghost Attendant yao, like our zhuji. The Night Stock yao are equivalent to our ningmai,\u201d Zuo Mo explained simply.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat scared me. Then can\u2019t we hold this place?\u201d Chun Yu Cheng said excitedly.</p><br/><p>Gongsun Cha shook his head but didn\u2019t speak. Zuo Mo grimaced, \u201cProbably not. Yaomo emphasize killing and have endured fighting since they were born. They live more harshly than we do. Also, you can also see their organization. Our side only has scattered soldiers and heroes, we are not a match.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what do we do?\u201d Chun Yu Cheng\u2019s little face became pale again.</p><br/><p>\u201cFlee!\u201d Zuo Mo gritted his teeth and said hatefully.</p><br/><p>His heart was filled with sorrow.</p><br/><p>The good days of sitting and taking in money had reached an end \u2026 \u2026</p><br/><p>Translator Ramblings: We have civilians who can\u2019t fight, people who can fight, and then \u2026 \u2026 the military. Numbers is its own kind of battle strategy. The yao finally show up after so much foreshadowing.</p><br/><p>Ironically enough, translation is actually low on my list of priorities for when I have the spare time considering that it takes up the majority of my spare time. Translating is after when I don\u2019t have novels to read, finish reading the news, run out of lives on Candy Crush and lots of other things. Some days, I translate a few words and I get distracted. Then there are the translation breaks before fights. My biggest break was a whole week not translating because I didn\u2019t want to translate the Ling Ying Sect chapters with Chang Heng and Zuo Mo\u2019s fight.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

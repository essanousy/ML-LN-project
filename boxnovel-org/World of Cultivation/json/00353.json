Each step required a great deal of concentration from him.</p><br/><p>His clothing was in tatters and covered in dust, his entire person looked very fragile. Only that pair of black eyes showed a sharp light that seemed to penetrate the thick fiendish mist.</p><br/><p>The dangers of this journey was hundreds of times greater compared to this trip in the sword cave.</p><br/><p>Those soul beasts that could take form were especially vicious and cunning. They seemed to be one with the fiend mist, would silently approach to ambush and were hard to defend against. They also had an endless supply of illusory techniques that enchanted a person\u2019s mind. If it wasn\u2019t for the strength of Wei Sheng\u2019s resolve, he would have fallen a long time go. They came like the wind, their speed was lightning fast, their attacks vicious. If he was the slightest bit careless, he would land in a precarious situation.</p><br/><p>In the most dangerous incident, he had encountered three fiend soul beasts. What surprised him was that these three fiend soul beasts knew to cooperate among themselves. In that battle, he had been wounded in a dozen places. The most serious wound was so deep his rib bones could be seen.</p><br/><p>If he did not have healing lingdan in his dimension ring, he would have died from the wound alone.</p><br/><p>However, Wei Sheng was still Wei Sheng. Having left the sect to come to such an unfamiliar and dangerous place, it was as though he had been released from a heavy burden. The chains on his heart were shattered. He was like a bird that had escaped the cage and was unspeakably relaxed. He did not feel uncomfortable at the dangers in front of him.</p><br/><p>He continuously experienced the ambush of all kinds of fiend soul beasts, the illusory techniques that ensnared a person\u2019s mind. These dangers did not made him want to retreat, but tempered his sword heart even making it more refined and pure.</p><br/><p>His talent in cultivating the sword was very exceptional in the beginning. The worldly apparition when he entered zhuji had caused everyone to feel anticipation about his future. Even Lin Qian of mysterious origins treated his talent slightly favorably. It was possible to see just how talented he was.</p><br/><p>Having rediscovered the calm of his sword heart, and adding on the honing from the dangerous situation, he was like a treasure sword uncovered from the dust, and gradually showed his sharpened edges!</p><br/><p>There wasn\u2019t much ling power left.</p><br/><p>He thought inside as his gaze looked towards the depths of the fiendish mist. Previously, sword essence had exploded suddenly in the direction he had been travelling. This gave him hope. He had a strong feeling that he was not far from his target.</p><br/><p>But right now, he needed to think of everything he could do and control the consumption of ling power.</p><br/><p>He was like the most frugal miser. If he could use one thread of ling power, he would not use two threads. He also tried to absorb ling power from the jingshi in the dimensional ring, and tried to purify it of impurities. He did everything he could do.</p><br/><p>Even so, he was a sorry figure.</p><br/><p>Caressing the black sword in his hands, he raised his head again and walked forward with determination.</p><br/><p>He trusted the sword in his hands.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>\u201cShixiong fainted again?\u201d Gongsun Cha gazed curiously at the unconscious Zuo Mo. He reached out to poke and see if Shixiong was really unconscious.</p><br/><p>The \u201cagain\u201d of Gongsun Cha\u2019s words made the other people\u2019s features twitch.</p><br/><p>\u201cEhm, Daren must be cultivating a special technique.\u201d Xie Shan found a shoddy excuse. Zuo Mo was his boss. He had to help disguise it.</p><br/><p>Shu Long\u2019s mouth imperceptibly curved up but he quickly became stern again.</p><br/><p>Gongsun Cha\u2019s face was regretful as he muttered, \u201cI had been hoping he could help me fish today \u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHm, Daren will rest. He probably will wake up soon,\u201d Xie Shan could only say.</p><br/><p>He had checked. There were no problems with Daren\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>Shu Long had been planning on reporting to Zuo Mo. He could only leave now. He was the leader of the Hardship Guards. There was a pile of matters waiting for him everyday.</p><br/><p>The camp of the Hardship Guard was always set up separately. Walking into the camp, it was very busy.</p><br/><p>For other people, the abundant black fiendish energy was akin to poison, but for them, it was nothing less than the best nutrients.</p><br/><p>\u201cHead, when will Daren come to the camp?\u201d When A Wen saw Shu Long, his eyes lit up, and he ran over with his black spear. The other Hardship Guards also crowded over.</p><br/><p>Shu Long felt a head but still said expressionlessly, \u201cDaren is cultivating now. When Daren finishes, I will report at the first moment.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Everyone\u2019s sounds carried slight disappointment.</p><br/><p>In this period of time, the Hardship Guard had all improved greatly. There were many people that had finished forming their weapons. Almost half of the Guard Camp had finished forming their weapons. Compared to before, their combat capabilities were much stronger. Some more accomplished, like A Wen, rocketed in their improvement.</p><br/><p>In this short amount of time, he had become the second strongest in Guard Camp after Shu Long. He had just woken up from his meditation, and had gained greatly. He was very innocent and he desired Daren\u2019s praise. Everyone in the camp had improved greatly. Every one of the flower slaves had comprehended a few spells.</p><br/><p>Shu Long also hoped that Daren could come to the camp. That would greatly increase morale.</p><br/><p>He hadn\u2019t expected that Daren was unconscious again.</p><br/><p>He could only go tomorrow, Shu Long thought.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>Nan Yue rubbed her forehead as her head ached. Being forcibly ejected from the Ten Finger Prison meant that her consciousness had been wounded slightly. But at this time, she did not put any attention on her lightly wounded consciousness.</p><br/><p>She only wanted to know one thing now\u2014had Daren finished the prison-breaking battle!</p><br/><p>She wanted to enter Vast Water Clear Skies again, but before her consciousness recovered, she had no way of entering Vast Water Clear Skies.</p><br/><p>Tightly biting her lips, her heart was in the air. What would Vast Water Clear Skies look like now?</p><br/><p>But she could only be impatient. She comforted herself, tomorrow, by tomorrow, she would know the result. No matter if Daren had completed the prison-breaking battle or not, this matter would spread tomorrow, and the result would naturally float to the surface.</p><br/><p>Daren had accidentally activated the prison-breaking battle. Due to this, other than the first and second prison, no one had managed to rush over in time. Right now, the news had not spread, but she dared to guarantee that by tomorrow, this matter would shake all of the yao world.</p><br/><p>This was a prison-breaking battle!</p><br/><p>She suddenly became excited. To be able to follow such a daren, what honor this was!</p><br/><p>In the yao word, powerful yao would usually have many followers. Many of them would become their daren\u2019s students, but most of them would only have the identity of a follower. However, this did not mean that they were lower than others. The guidance of a master, even if it was just a tiny bit, would greatly benefit them.</p><br/><p>Even more, Daren had promised to pass her [South Sky Arrow Art]!</p><br/><p>Thinking about this, she unconsciously tightened her fisted hands.</p><br/><p>Nan Yue, you have to work hard, and cannot disappoint Daren!</p><br/><p>She repeatedly motivated herself, her little face filled with determination. She understood her responsibilities. South Sky Wisteria Clan had already declined and was tiny. She did not think about recovering the past prosperity of the Wisteria Clan of the South Sky. Her only hope was to use her efforts to help the clansmen leave behind their situation of poverty. At least, they would have better lives.</p><br/><p>Nan Yue, you can do it!</p><br/><p>She told herself.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>The vast ocean seemed borderless.</p><br/><p>Water shifted at a part of the ocean, and in a moment, a terrifying whirlpool over two hundred li in diameter formed. The whirlpool spun with astonishing speed, the strong force pulling the center of the whirlpool to collapse into itself.</p><br/><p>A deep passage appeared in the center of the whirlpool.</p><br/><p>A handsome male flew out of the passage. His features were soft in its lines, a warm and elegant smile on his face that would create positive feelings, and had a transparent crystal on his forehead.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe broke Vast Water Clear Skies, and swallowed my water breath bead as well,\u201d the male shook his head and smiled. \u201cLooks like a pretty talented young little yao.\u201d</p><br/><p>Just as he was talking to himself, a dash of fire landed from the sky.</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha! Little Qian Qian, your Vast Water Clear Skies was broken!\u201d</p><br/><p>A face appeared in the mountain-sized ball of fire. He was roaring with amused laughter.</p><br/><p>Hearing the other\u2019s appellation of him, Qian Liu\u2019s forehead twitched. But he knew if he argued with this unreasonable guy, that was definitely going up against a wall. He could only smile and say, \u201cThree hundred years have passed, it\u2019s time for it to be broken.\u201d</p><br/><p>The fire-faced person that had been laughing at his misfortune a moment ago couldn\u2019t help but snort. \u201cHmph! Three hundreds years and no one came out. That group of old guys talk that whole set every day, there\u2019s no use.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qian Liu hurriedly urged, \u201cThat can\u2019t be said. Even though there are no experts, but their methods at nurturing intermediate level yao is very effective.\u201d</p><br/><p>The temper of the fire-faced person was very explosive. He swore, \u201cEffective my ass! No experts, there won\u2019t be one to be able to be seen in public.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey have it hard.\u201d Qian Liu sighed. \u201cSupposedly, a few good seedlings have come from the yao art houses. They can be considered to have set up a path.\u201d</p><br/><p>The fire-face person\u2019s temper lowered slightly, but he still growled, \u201cIt\u2019s too late. We\u2019ve already started the battle with the xiuzhe. If they came a few years earlier, then that would have worked.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qian Liu said with a smile, \u201cIt may not be a bad matter for them to arrive in time for this great battle. Without the tempering of true battle, it is hard for these people gain strength.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn any case, you always have excuses!\u201d The fire-faced person clearly was impatient and did not want to stay on this topic. He changed direction. \u201cWhat, don\u2019t you want to know what the new first prison looks like?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qian Liu blinked. \u201cThere is still one day until the new first prison will form.\u201d</p><br/><p>The flames around the body of the fire-faced person stilled. He had forgotten this. He hurriedly glossed over. \u201cWhat do you think this boy\u2019s origins are?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow can I guess? I\u2019ll know when I see tomorrow.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHee hee, I can\u2019t wait.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>Vast Water Clear Skies had been broken.</p><br/><p>The news quickly spread through all of the large yao jies like it had wings, and instantly created waves. Right now, the yao army was winning on the front lines. This news was a boost in morale for the troops. All of the yao felt excited.</p><br/><p>Was a new era about to come?</p><br/><p>The prison-breaking battle that had not been activated for three hundred years once again entered everyone\u2019s view. Some old yao were so excited they started to reminiscence about the prosperity of the yao before the thousand year war.</p><br/><p>However, no one knew the origins of the mysterious guy.</p><br/><p>All kinds of recording yao arts appeared, but people quickly found that all the recording yao arts did not have an ending, lacking the most important and crucial part.</p><br/><p>Speculation and discussion filled every corner of the yao world. Each yao was waiting for the arrival of the second day, waiting for the new first prison to take form! Each yao desired to know\u2014</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014What would the new first prison be like?</p><br/><p>Translator Ramblings: Wei Sheng keeps going and becomes a miser to survive. Zuo Mo is unconscious and Xie Shan is such a good subordinate to make excuses for him.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

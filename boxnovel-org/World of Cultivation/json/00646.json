His Highness \u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOne hundred years!\u201d Zuo Mo interrupted Fu Feng.</p><br/><p>\u201cTake it or leave it, there is no second offer! As for Xuan Kong Temple, do not worry. I will destroy those thieving baldies sooner or later! I will not stop you from having your revenge.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo\u2019s price scared everyone. Tao Xing\u2019s face was slightly pale, much less Fu Feng. He was completely white in fright.</p><br/><p>Bie Han was silent.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo counted on his fingers. \u201cIt is only one hundred years, you will not lose out. Think about it. You are mo, your life is long to begin with, one hundred years, that\u2019s a flick of the finger, a brief moment of life! What is that worth? Think about it, this Sin Battalion, other than the things I\u2019ve already talked about, I have to be responsible for after-sale services, equipping them, and also providing food and shelter, that\u2019s a huge expense. Think again, can you really charge into Xuan Kong Temple the way your are now? Not just one Sin Battalion, even if you had ten battalions, you will not manage to make it far. They are one of the great four! Even a hair of their back is thicker than you! Your thinking is very na\u00efve!\u201d</p><br/><p>Bie Han was silent. He knew that what Zuo Mo said was correct. No matter how strong he was, he could not destroy Xuan Kong Temple with just Sin Battalion alone. They would not even be able to step onto Xuan Kong Temple. The other had enough battalions to wear him down and also had defensive formations everywhere.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you do not care about revenge and are just seeking a way to die, then I have nothing further to say. But if it was me who had such great hate with Xuan Kong Temple, it would be strange if I don\u2019t upend them. I want them to cry when they hear the name of Little Mo Ge, and then I will flatten Xuan Kong Temple and burn it to the ground. Oh, that will be good!\u201d</p><br/><p>Bie Han\u2019s expression shifted, his fists unconsciously tightened.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother, that is what pleasurable revenge is! What you want to do is called seeking your own death. You are providing Xuan Kong Temple with a benefit, making it so they have one less thing to worry about! That\u2019s not how you take revenge, we need to consider strategy, timing, we need to strengthen ourselves, and weaken the other. Even if we cannot destroy them, we have to at least be like a fish bone stuck in their throat and make them uncomfortable, so that they cannot rest in peace!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo\u2019s tone turned.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour skill in fighting is pretty good but not in this. However, I can do it!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo patted his chest loudly, and said with a serious expression, \u201cI am the master of Cloud Sea Jie, I have many armies, and a specialized forging camp. I have xiuzhe, yao, mo in my service. If you work with me for a hundred years, we strengthen our forces, then can\u2019t we step on Xuan Kong Temple like stepping on a worm?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother!\u201d Zuo Mo persuaded. \u201cJust one hundred years, a slight faction of your life. Compared to your deep hatred, what is that worth? Such a profitable transaction!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright! I agree!\u201d Bie Han suddenly raised his head, his face filled with murderousness. \u201cYou are right, I want them to be unable to eat and rest in peace! Each day that we are alive, they will not rest in peace for that day!\u201d</p><br/><p>Fu Feng looked dazedly at His HIghness. He had not expected His Highness to agree like this. He wanted to cry. What kind of person did not bargain when doing business?</p><br/><p>\u201cGreat!\u201d Zuo Mo clapped his hand and said to Bie Han with an admiring expression. \u201cA true man has to be decisive like this!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tao Xing\u2019s face was slightly pale. He was completely frightened by this business deal that occurred right in front of him. One hundred years! Such light words for one hundred years of servitude!</p><br/><p>Now that he thought about it, the mo embryos that he had to pay that day were really a cheap price! He looked in sympathy at Bie Han. Pitiful child, you are so pitiful to have to asked this person for help.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo suddenly turned around and faced Tao Xing. \u201cOld Tao, the materials \u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Tao Xing who was in a frightened state almost jumped up. \u201cAh ah ah ah! Materials \u2026 \u2026 oh oh oh, the materials, \u2026 \u2026 no problem! I will provide all of it, freely!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo was very happy and patted Tao Xing\u2019s shoulder warmly. \u201cOld Tao, I just knew that you are the one that understands me the best!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tao Xing\u2019s expression almost froze on his face as he nodded frantically. \u201cThis is something that I should do!\u201d</p><br/><p>He really was frightened \u2026 \u2026</p><br/><p>So scary \u2026 \u2026</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>In the sea of consciousness.</p><br/><p>\u201cOne hundred years is too short!\u201d Pu Yao was unsatisfied.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou should have signed him for a lifetime. He would still agree,\u201d Wei said with a smile, \u201cif you will let him have his revenge.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo rolled his eyes. \u201cI, Little Mo Ge, care about holding to my morals when doing business.\u201d</p><br/><p>His tone suddenly changed as he said seriously. \u201cI used shen power.\u201d</p><br/><p>Pu Yao and Wei simultaneously stilled.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo\u2019s face was grave. \u201cThe last jinzhi on the Sin Battalion member that was connected to the soul was created with shen power.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShen power?\u201d Pu Yao and Wei\u2019s expressions became greve.</p><br/><p>\u201cXuan Kong Temple has grasped shen power?\u201d Wei was slightly surprised.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, it should be a kind of shen power that is not fully developed.\u201d Zuo Mo thought and then said, \u201cBut it definitely is a kind of shen power. I cannot describe it. The ling power I used was consumed and because there was no other way, I was forced to use shen power in order to complete the mo matrix.\u201d</p><br/><p>Pu Yao\u2019s expression recovered as he smiled coldly. \u201cXuan Kong Temple is not dumb. How can they not have any ambitions for obtaining shen power? It probably isn\u2019t just them. The other sects probably are also studying it in secret.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo\u2019s mind shifted. \u201cSo the truth is that the four great sects pursue the descendants of ancient tribes for shen power?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cClearly!\u201d Pu Yao\u2019s cold smile remained. \u201cThey were not good people before.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBe careful, do not let anyone else know that you cultivate shen power,\u201d Wei said gravely.</p><br/><p>\u201cEn, don\u2019t worry, it is not easy even for me to manipulate this shen power,\u201d Zuo Mo said helplessly. However, then his mood went up as he snickered. \u201cHowever, it is very beneficial for my shen power when I remake the mo matrices for Sin Battalion. Especially those jinzhi. There are many places where I need to use shen power. I can profit and I can also cultivate shen power, I\u2019m really a genius! Haha!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, then there less of a loss.\u201d Wei said neutrally.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is better than nothing.\u201d Pu Yao said lazily.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>Ceng Lian\u2019er was not in a good mood. It had been a few days since Zuo Mo had cultivated. He was working on the Sin Battalion. If Zuo Mo did not cultivate, she could not use paired cultivation. She had already detected the increase of shen power inside her body had slowed down.</p><br/><p>Her teacher had once told her that the cultivation method she used was not complete and there were many chapters that had been lost. Even though the previous generations had spent great effort to try to repair it, but it still could not reach the effects they hoped for.</p><br/><p>There were rarely those of her teacher\u2019s lineage that could cultivate shen power.</p><br/><p>For example, her teacher\u2019s teacher never obtained shen power. There were many details in a profound method like shen power that could not be described in words alone.</p><br/><p>She had finally managed to cultivate shen power and found someone to perform paired cultivation with. Her good fortune was many times that of her teacher.</p><br/><p>Yet what she felt helpless about was that Zuo Mo was not currently cultivating!</p><br/><p>If Zuo Mo did not cultivate, she could not use paired cultivation and her shen power growth was unusually slow. She had tried to copy Zuo Mo and went to read the Mo Skill Steles but she found she was quickly unable to keep reading. The things the Mo Skill Steles talked about were too simple. The final goal of the Mo Skill Stele was shen power but that was just one section of the content and was extremely hidden. There was nothing mentioned about the things past obtaining shen power.</p><br/><p>After reading through it, she threw it to the side.</p><br/><p>That time, she had only fought briefly with Qi Diao Yu but she felt great wariness of the other\u2019s power. Her shen power was still too weak and Qi Diao Yu had managed to discover it. This really was too dangerous.</p><br/><p>If the news spread, she would have to run for her life.</p><br/><p>In the last few days, she did not leave the residence and stayed inside the courtyard. The compound was heavily guarded and even Qi Diao Yu would not dare to carelessly charge in.</p><br/><p>But Zuo Mo actually was not cultivating shen power!</p><br/><p>Thinking about this, she was so angry she wanted to throw the teacup in her hand.</p><br/><p>He was not focusing on his actual work!</p><br/><p>She decided to think of a solution.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>\u201cPublic safety is very chaotic recently,\u201d Princess Xin\u2019s brow creased, \u201cbandits have kept appearing along the way. I heard that there are more bandits gathering to target us.\u201d</p><br/><p>A youth smiled and said, \u201cPrincess, do not worry, with us guarding you, no matter how many they come, we just have a few more opponents to practice against.\u201d</p><br/><p>Princess Xin did not like the other\u2019s frivolous tone. \u201cThere may be experts among the bandits.\u201d</p><br/><p>The youths neither shook their head or smiled. Most of them were strong even among their families and naturally looked down on the bandits.</p><br/><p>Princess Xia smiled. \u201cElder Sister does not need to worry. After a few more days, we will reach Great Peace City and have some peace.\u201d</p><br/><p>Princess Xin\u2019s expression eased slightly. \u201cYounger Sister is right.\u201d</p><br/><p>There wasn\u2019t any battalion that dared to fight in Great Peace City. This was also applicable to the bandits. There had never been any bandits that dared to rampage in Great Peace City.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhich of you have heard of the Great Peace Treasure Pavilion?\u201d a youth suddenly spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cGreat Peace Treasure Pavilion? What is that?\u201d The other youths heard this and crowded over.</p><br/><p>The youth had a proud expression. \u201cThe news that just recently spread. Supposedly, Shi Zi Ming had collected innumerable treasures so he built Great Peace Treasure Pavilion. In the first three years of the Great Peace City, this Great Peace Treasure Pavilion always existed and it was mentioned in many records. But later, due to unknown reasons, the Great Peace Treasure Pavilion disappeared, and Shi Zi Ming never talked about it again as though it never existed.\u201d</p><br/><p>All of the people\u2019s interests were stirred and they asked, \u201cAnd then?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNews spread just a while ago that the Great Peace Treasure Pavilion is going to appear again. We can have a good look when we go this time!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStop gossiping! Great Peace Treasure Pavilion, I\u2019ve gone to Great Peace City many times and never heard of some Great Peace Treasure Pavilion!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat might not be the case! I have seen records about the Great Peace Treasure Pavilion, I think on the [Great Peace Travel Records.]\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve also read about it!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs there really a Great Peace Treasure Pavilion? We need to go search! If we find it, we\u2019ll be rich!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDream on!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGreat Peace Treasure Pavilion?\u201d Princess Xin seemed to think of something and an indecipherable light flashed through her eyes.</p><br/><p>Translator Ramblings: One hundred years, going going gone!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

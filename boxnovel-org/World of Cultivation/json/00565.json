The security around this compound was so heavy that he found it hard to imagine. He seemed to have come to a very scary place. There were not many at his cultivation level that could rival his concealment and stealth movement. But even so, he almost fell for some of the traps along the way.</p><br/><p>If it wasn\u2019t that the woman\u2019s intentions were really strange, he would have immediately turned around and left.</p><br/><p>His intuition told him that this place was too dangerous!</p><br/><p>For the mission this time, the sect had used a hidden chaos rift. This chaos rift had been one that they had originally planned to use for an ambush at a crucial time.</p><br/><p>Even with these precautions they had been attacked after just entering Great Peace City. A woman of unknown origins attacked without any warning. This woman was very strong and even with the people from the sect fighting together, they were unable to capture her. She also seemed very certain they didn\u2019t dare to make too much of a ruckus.</p><br/><p>Had their identities been exposed? Everyone\u2019s hearts sank. All of them knew very well what it meant if their identities were exposed in the mo territories.</p><br/><p>When that mysterious woman left, Fei Fei hid himself and followed her from afar.</p><br/><p>The other was even warier than he had expected and took a winding path to shake of any tail. Fei Fei had almost lost track of her several times. In the end, this woman entered this estate. Fei Fei had originally decided to leave but he had found a flaw in the defenses. He could not resist and sneaked in.</p><br/><p>A guard of this calibre was full of holes in his eyes.</p><br/><p>But after he entered, he found that the situation inside was the reverse of what he had imagined.</p><br/><p>The estate was better protected than he had imaged. That flaw he had seen seemed more like a trap. As he continued inwards, his wish to retreat increased.</p><br/><p>At this time, he suddenly saw a woman and a completely dark person walk over.</p><br/><p>He hurriedly hid and didn\u2019t dare to breathe.</p><br/><p>This woman was not like the woman that had attacked them. There weren\u2019t any energy ripples coming from her body. The dark gold person beside her seemed to be a mo puppet.</p><br/><p>However \u2026 \u2026</p><br/><p>Was that really a mo puppet?</p><br/><p>The flattery was varied as it came out of the mo puppet\u2019s mouth. In the shadows, Fei Fei felt ashamed. If he had this level of skill in the sect, his status in the sect would not be what it was now.</p><br/><p>He was shocked as well. It was rare to see such a lifelike mo puppet.</p><br/><p>But the next scene caused his jaw to drop.</p><br/><p>Hundreds of mo steeds were swallowed up by the mo puppet.</p><br/><p>In Fei Fei\u2019s eyes, the small mouth of the dark gold mo puppet suddenly became a gaping maw that could consume anything. A mo puppet that swallowed mo steeds probably would also be interested in swallowing xiuzhe. Thinking about how the mo puppet would consume him, Fei Fei trembled.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, the dark gold mo puppet turned his face and looked towards the corner he was in.</p><br/><p>Fei Fei\u2019s mind blanked. He was discovered!</p><br/><p>He was very experienced in battle and calmed down. He decisively activated his spell. His body blurred and he appeared on the verge of turning into a ball of mist.</p><br/><p>Fei Fei started with his life-saving ultimate technique [Smoke Travel Spell]!</p><br/><p>[Smoke Travel Spell] was a sixth grade spell. It could turn a person\u2019s body into a ball of smoke that would dissipate. Once one turned to smoke, they could not attack the enemy but the majority of attacks were ineffective against them. It was a top spell for escaping.</p><br/><p>This technique had save Fei Fei an unknown number of times.</p><br/><p>So when he detected that the situation was not right, he immediately used the [Smoke Travel Spell]. He could detect the threat from the dark gold mo puppet. If he turned to light smoke, he could return to Shixiong\u2019s side. His Smoke Return Pillar was on Shixiong\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>Yet just as he was about to successfully escape, the mo puppet appeared in front of him.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>The black gold seal soldier stared at Fei Fei whose body was becoming faint. His eyes were indifferent without any of the cheer that was just there. He reached out and an ancient character on his palm lit up.</p><br/><p>Fei Fei\u2019s eyes widened and terror showed on his face.</p><br/><p>The black gold seal soldier\u2019s hand already pressed onto Fei Fei whose body was blurring and then he quickly moved his palm away.</p><br/><p>The bright character was imprinted on Fei Fei\u2019s almost transparent body . Fei Fei\u2019s body melted at a visible rate like a snowman under a bright sun.</p><br/><p>Fei Fei\u2019s features twisted as he furiously screamed but he couldn\u2019t make any sounds.</p><br/><p>The black gold seal soldier looked indifferently at him.</p><br/><p>Not five minutes later, Fei Fei completely disappeared.</p><br/><p>Clink.</p><br/><p>A light sound. It was a ring that dropped to the ground from the smoke.</p><br/><p>The black gold seal soldier picked up the ring. The indifference on his face disappeared. He was full of smiles like before as he presented the ring to A Gui.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>\u201cFei Fei is dead.\u201d A hint of grief flashed through Lin Qian\u2019s eyes but his tone was very cold.</p><br/><p>The other people stared at each other with sadness and terror in their eyes. Even though they all knew that the mission this time would be dangerous no one had thought they would lose someone just after arriving in Great Peace City.</p><br/><p>Their start was not a good one!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat that woman used was shen power.\u201d Lin Qian\u2019s expression was calm as he said, \u201cShe should have come for the Great Peace Stele as well. Everyone, be careful. Do not expose your identities before the Great Peace Treasure Pavilion appears.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d Everyone answered simultaneously but it was apparent their morale had suffered.</p><br/><p>Lin Qian did not look at them and said to himself, \u201cThe mission is very hard and dangerous this time. Even I do not have the confidence of victory. But our Kun Lun\u2019s thousands of years of prosperity was won by our forebearers through life and death struggles. Now, the world is uncertain, and these next few decades will determine the next thousand years!\u201d</p><br/><p>His gaze landed on the other people and his authority came through in his indifference.</p><br/><p>\u201cOn matters related to the fate of Kun Lun, how can we retreat?\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone\u2019s expressions steadied. Most of them were born in Kun Lun and had deep feelings towards Kun Lun. Their families were also at Kun Lun and their lives were deeply connected to Kun LUn.</p><br/><p>One person said in a deep voice, \u201cEldest Shixiong is right, even if we die, we will have a place in the Kun Lun\u2019s Sword Home!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow can we, the people of Kun Lun, fear those yaomo?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAt most, it is just another thousand year battle!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Qian did not speak. Morale rose and everyone\u2019s gazes became more determined. This time, those that were selected were all yuanying experts. All of them had strong sword hearts and their spirits rose.</p><br/><p>When the noise faded, Lin Qian said with a small smile, \u201cEven if that person recognized us, that is alright. Great Peace City is a gathering of many mo factions and the complexity of the situation is almost unimaginable. These mo all have their own plans and are suspicious about those around them. There are also people making waves from the shadows to muddy the waters. We are just one of the factors in Great Peace City. Some people will care about our identities, but there are also people that hope we have come to disrupt the situation and provide them with an opportunity.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone nodded and agreed when they heard this.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo the plan will not change.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>The Celestial Planet Guard was in a furor. All the mo steeds in the beast pens had disappeared. What was even more crazy was that there wasn\u2019t any signs of fighting near the beast pens.</p><br/><p>Shou Ping\u2019s face was black. Someone had come and stolen all the mo steeds. This had actually occurred under his leadership.</p><br/><p>Miss hadn\u2019t said anything but Shou Ping was so ashamed he wanted to burrow into a crack in the ground. Nothing had happened to the other yards, only his steeds had been stolen from!</p><br/><p>Embarrassing! Too embarrassing!</p><br/><p>The Celestial Planet Guard had been at the bottom of the pack in cultivation. How could the proud Shou Ping tolerate something like this happening?</p><br/><p>The pitiful Celestial Planet Guards were tormented to death because of a glutton.</p><br/><p>But the culprit had forgotten about this matter.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is part of your plan?\u201d Nanmen Xue stared coldly at the person in front of him.</p><br/><p>This male shook his head. \u201cWe did not do this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI do not believe it.\u201d Nanmen Xue said coldly, \u201cOur partnership ends now. I have great doubts about your sincerity.\u201d</p><br/><p>The male\u2019s expression was normal. He still shook his head. \u201cWe did not do this. We had sent people to capture Xiao Mo Ge, but he killed them. The disappearance of his subordinates has nothing to do with us. We are also investigating but there hasn\u2019t been any clues yet.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nanmen Xue stared at the other. Seeing that the other\u2019s expression did not change, he believed that the other had not lied.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow all clues point towards me,\u201d Nanmen Xue said coldly. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me you do not have other plans.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe do,\u201d the male said gravely. \u201cWe are now sure that Xiao Mo Ge is that crucial person. However, we are not the only ones to realize this, the other people probably also have as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nanmen Xue listened silently and did not speak.</p><br/><p>\u201cRight now, everyone is looking at Xiao Mo Ge. As long as we are not targeting Xiao Mo Ge, no one would care about us,\u201d the male said calmly, \u201cthe waters of Great Peace City have started to muddy.\u201d</p><br/><p>He suddenly smiled. \u201cThey are all staring at Xiao Mo Ge so we will go find the other key to Great Peace Treasure Pavilion.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou know who has the key?\u201d Nanemn Xue was shocked.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d The male smiled slightly. \u201cWe have a few targets.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nanmen Xue started at the other and suddenly said, \u201cIs there anything I need to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course!\u201d The male had a satisfied expression. \u201cYou are an integral part of our plan.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then he told Nanmen Xue his plan in a lowered voice.</p><br/><p>Nanmen Xue\u2019s eyes were bright as he listened and nodded occasionally. The other\u2019s plan was outstanding.</p><br/><p>However \u2026 \u2026</p><br/><p>When the other finished telling him the plan, Nanmen Xue looked at the other and smiled. \u201cIt is an outstanding plan! However, I want the Fire Heart Gall.\u201d</p><br/><p>The other\u2019s brow furrowed. \u201cAs long as you complete \u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Nanmen Xue shook his head. \u201cI want it now.\u201d</p><br/><p>The other\u2019s expression changed slightly. \u201cThat is not possible!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Namen Xue smiled and said, \u201cYour plan is so exquisite and detailed. If one part goes wrong, the whole plan falls apart. So many steps are related to me, I am a very important pawn.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is no benefit if you go back on your word! You will regret it!\u201d The other\u2019s face was dark as he gritted out.</p><br/><p>\u201cFire Heart Gall or you lose, choose one.\u201d Nanmen Xue still smiled. \u201cOh, right, I believe that you can also see that it is not a very easy matter if you want to withdraw from our partnership now.\u201d</p><br/><p>The other\u2019s complexion was ashen.</p><br/><p>Translator Ramblings: So many people after the same thing. Everyone is greedy.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

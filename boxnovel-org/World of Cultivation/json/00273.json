The sky had just been full of light, but now it was covered in dark clouds. It was possible to see lightning snakes among the clouds, and five colored auroras flowing by. Many people couldn\u2019t help but have admiring expressions. Everyone caused different apparitions when they were forming their core. The exact nature of the apparition was related to the xiuzhe\u2019s own spells, and the laws that they comprehended.</p><br/><p>The changes of the world during core formation was extremely important to a xiuzhe because it was the first step for a xiuzhe to comprehend the higher levels of the world\u2019s rules. Higher levelled rules, and deeper comprehension began with the apparition during core formation. Stepping into this door was a brand new world.</p><br/><p>This was core formation! The core formation that countless people dreamed about.</p><br/><p>Every xiuzhe that entered ningmai had a dream, core formation.</p><br/><p>For the great majority of xiuzhe, jindan was the highest target they purused. It mean greater power, higher status, more jingshi, and a freer life! In places like Sky Moon Jie and Sky Water Jie, a jindan was a warlord, and if they didn\u2019t want to waste time on mortal matters, any sect would welcome them with the status of an elder. The tempting benefits meant you did not have to worry about materials, or jingshi. You had great amounts of time to do anything you wanted.</p><br/><p>To get all these benefits, you only needed to become a jindan.</p><br/><p>The black clouds in the sky roiled. The five colored aurora would occasionally become rainbows that then extinguished. It was very attractive. The mood became even tenser.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo\u2019s mouth was open wide as he looked dazedly at the sky. This was the first time he saw the process of core formation and it gave him an enormous shock. The black clouds in the sky, the rainbows that were born and died, all of this shocked him. His consciousness was very strong, and his sensitivity to ling power surpassed any xiuzhe inside the valley.</p><br/><p>He could clearly feel the terrifying ling power that was contained here!</p><br/><p>The ling power within a three hundred li radius had suddenly concentrated the moment the black clouds formed. The ling power had all flowed into this ball of black clouds. If these black clouds exploded, the power it would release would far surpass the power of twelve Sonic Lightning Walnut exploding simultaneously.</p><br/><p>The entire Hundred Flower Valley would turn to dust. Even Zuo Mo, with his Great Day mo physique, would not be able to avoid this calamity. The pressure that was released by the black clouds was purely caused by the sheer enormous volume of ling power it contained!</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo\u2019s expression suddenly became extremely ugly. He noticed many xiuzhe didn\u2019t retreat, but went closer. Core formation was a rare event and had a fatal attraction for everyone. If they could see a bit, it definitely would be of benefit.</p><br/><p>This group of people didn\u2019t want to live!</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo swore inside and stopped the people going forward, \u201cIt is dangerous! Come back! Everyone, retreat out of Hundred Flower Valley!\u201d</p><br/><p>Fortunately, Zuo Mo held great authority among this group of people. Everyone hesitated, but they all quickly left Hundred Flower Valley.</p><br/><p>Hundred Flower Valley was very close to Bright Water City. Such a strong flow of ling power had disturbed all of Bright Water City. Xiuzhe from Bright Water City continually flew out of Bright Water City to look in the direction of Hundred Flower Valley.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>After that night\u2019s battle, the xiuzhe of Bright Water City changed their attitudes towards the Little Mountain Jie xiuzhe who were lead by the Master of Golden Crow City, especially jindan xiuzhe. The ambush during the night had completely destroyed Wood Sword Camp, including one jindan. Up until now, there were five or six jindan that had died in the hands of the Master of Golden Crow City.</p><br/><p>This was an number that no one could dismiss.</p><br/><p>If it was one or two, it could be said to be luck, but five or six was not something that could be explained by luck. This was why the heavily wounded Wood Sword Sect and Cloud Divine Sect did not launch a counter-attack.</p><br/><p>In the eyes of normal xiuzhe, the power of the Master of Golden Crow City was immeasurable. They also found that the construction of Little Mountain City did not affect their lives. These xiuzhe that came from Little Mountain Jie were not as brutal and evil as they had originally imagined. They were very generous and were deeply liked by merchants. Many merchants planned on going to Little Mountain City and open up a store.</p><br/><p>\u201cCore formation, they have someone becoming a jindan!\u201d</p><br/><p>In the sky, Yan Yang\u2019s expression was dark. A malicious look flashed through his eyes.</p><br/><p>He Qiu was silently for a moment before he said, \u201cYes, they have become even stronger.\u201d</p><br/><p>When the figures of Vermillion Bird Camp appeared in the sky, He Qiu sighed. The name of Vermillion Bird Camp had spread through Sky Water Jie. Everyone knew of them. The appearance of this troop meant that the Master of Golden Crow City was still wary of them. Yan Yang did not make a sound. He stared viciously at Vermillion Bird Camp that was swimming through the air.</p><br/><p>It was this troop that had sent Wood Sword Camp to their deaths, and had taken the life of his beloved disciple.</p><br/><p>He definitely would avenge this grievance!</p><br/><p>His gaze was dark. The elders of the sect did not agree to allow him using stronger measures. No elder was willing to fight. This was why he had remained inactive up until now. He did his best to control the hatred in his heart. He was very clear that only an unconventional move could help him avenge this grievance. In the entire Sky Water Jie, no sect would publicly stand with him and become enemies with the Master of Golden Crow City.</p><br/><p>Yan Yang did his best to suppress it, but how could he conceal it from the eyes of He Qiu, who had been his opponent for more than ten years? He Qiu instantly knew Yan Yang\u2019s thoughts, but he did not speak of it. If Yan Yang wanted to jump into the fire pit, he wouldn\u2019t stop the other.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>At this time, five colored aurora lights suddenly light up the thick cloud layer above Hundred Flower Valley. It was possible to see the shape of a rainbow-colored ling beast swimming inside.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo\u2019s expression was nervous. Xie Shan had reached the most crucial time of a core formation.</p><br/><p>He could feel Xie Shan was continuously absorbing ling power from the clouds. That ling beast that was blurry was very resistant to Xie Shan absorbing ling power. Xie Shan didn\u2019t seem to be in a hurry, and just continuously drew out ling power.</p><br/><p>Two hours passed. Xie Shan was still absorbing ling power.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo was filled with shock. Up until now, he could generally estimate how much ling power Xie Shan had drawn out from the clouds. Jindan xiuzhe were definitely monsters. The amount of ling power in a ningmai could not compare to what a jindan could contain. No wonder people commonly say that jindan and ningmai were two different worlds.</p><br/><p>Pu Yao appeared out of nowhere. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be jealous of him. He has a deep base which is why he has caused such an apparition while he is forming the golden core. If you grasp all six transformations of the Great Day mo physique, other than some rare powerful jindan, no other jindan will be a match for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Zuo Mo didn\u2019t quite believe it. Before today, he hadn\u2019t been as fearful of jindan as he had been in the past, but the powerful apparition of Xie Shan\u2019s core formation today had once again shown him the power of jindan xiuzhe.</p><br/><p>\u201cTo be ranked second among brigadier mo physiques, how could it not have any powerful qualities?\u201d Pu Yao smirked coldly.</p><br/><p>His direction changed. \u201cEven if you do not use the Great Day mo physique, you still don\u2019t have to be afraid of him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow so?\u201d Zuo Mo was slightly interested. After Pu Yao had gotten a jindan last time, he had become much more energized, and was chattier. What surprised Zuo Mo the most was that this guy was much more generous than he was in the past. He didn\u2019t hide things like spells and yao arts like he had before.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you cultivate [Great Thousand Leaf Hands] and [Little Thousand Leaf Hands], even a jindan isn\u2019t a threat!\u201d Pu Yao said proudly.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d Zuo Mo smirked scornfully, \u201cwho are you trying to fool! I\u2019ve practiced these two, the power isn\u2019t bad, but it isn\u2019t enough to take down a jindan.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow much have you cultivated?\u201d Pu Yao volleyed back with the same scornful tone. \u201cIt is a waste for them to have landed on your hands. Your brain isn\u2019t very good. Just cultivate Great Day mo physique. That is most suited to people with able limbs and simple minds.\u201d</p><br/><p>He then glanced disdainfully at Zuo Mo, \u201cOur yao cultivation has much more to consider than the dumb mo.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo was not willing to show weakness. He said with a cold smile, \u201cReally? But why haven\u2019t I ever seen it from this honored Sky Yao?\u201d</p><br/><p>Pu Yao had a deep hint of mirth at the corner of his mouth. \u201cNo problem, I can let you see.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo\u2019s pupils suddenly shrank. A black dot suddenly appeared in front of Pu Yao, a black dot that was bottomless. When the black dot appeared, it expanded and swallowed the surrounding space at a rapid speed. Zuo Mo could only stare as the surroundings were being swallowed. His body could not move.</p><br/><p>In the black void, Zuo Mo faced Pu Yao.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis .. \u2026 what yao art is this?\u201d Zuo Mo gaped as he stammered. He looked in all directions. Everything was a black void.</p><br/><p>Pu Yao lowered his head slightly, his blood red pupil narrowing into a line, and the thin lips slightly curved. \u201c[Night Restriction], a very obscure yao art.\u201d Finishing, he gave a strange smile. \u201cYou are nervous?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCough!\u201d Hearing this, Zuo Mo pretended to cough. \u201cNonsense! Just a yao art that is used for scares, and you want to make ge nervous, you underestimate ge!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo then said suspiciously, \u201cPu, you\u2019ve recovered your power?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA little bit. Just a golden core, there wasn\u2019t much primary essence.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo sweat when he heard this. Pu Yao\u2019s tone made it seem like he was saying a mosquito didn\u2019t have much meat. Those were jindan, not lettuce.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you want to do by bringing me to this dark place?\u201d Zuo Mo\u2019s expression was righteous. \u201cI\u2019m telling you I have no interest in yao. In the future, I will find a beautiful female xiu to marry!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m very interested in you!\u201d Pu Yao stared with interest at Zuo Mo like he was seeing some peerless treasure. His eye was red and shiny.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo\u2019s hair rose at his gaze.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat \u2026 \u2026 that \u2026 \u2026 Pu, Xie Shan is undergoing core formation! I\u2019ve never seen a core formation. If I miss this chance, it will be hard to encounter one again, look \u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to see in a core formation.\u201d Pu Yao narrowed up his eyes again, and froze Zuo Mo\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>Pu Yao didn\u2019t seem normal today!</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo\u2019s heart was beating. An abnormal Pu Yao was much scarier than any jindan.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was out of my expectations that you could cultivate to Great Day mo physique.\u201d Pu Yao glanced at Zuo Mo and said lightly, \u201cThe Great Day mo physique is unyielding and powerful. I\u2019ve only seen one mo successfully reach it. Ten years later, I discovered he died.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDied? How did he die?\u201d Zuo Mo instinctively asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey failed and died during advancement. If xiuzhe fail during advancement, they fail, and they themselves are not damaged. But the progression of a mo physique is very dangerous. If it fails, then their soul is destroyed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Pu Yao\u2019s words were like the sharp cold wind of the winter, making Zuo Mo\u2019s face turn pale white.</p><br/><p>Translator Ramblings: Tradeoffs, faster growth, higher risk of death. It\u2019s nice of Pu Yao to tell Zuo Mo this after such a long time \u2026 \u2026</p><br/><p>Xie Shan is the first to reach jindan and this shouldn\u2019t be a surprise considering Fang Xiang mentioned it way back that Xie Shan had humongous ling power stores compared to most ningmai.</p><br/><p>Pu Yao said one golden core and I kept it as such since Fang Xiang wrote it that way. It\u2019s possible that one was eaten to heal himself and he used the second for other purposes.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

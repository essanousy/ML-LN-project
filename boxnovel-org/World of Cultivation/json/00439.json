Looking at the scenery outside, they were very excited.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve finally arrived! So this Cloud Sea Jie!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so beautiful!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, it\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve seen a place this beautiful \u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Under their feet was an endless sea of clouds. Floating among this sea of clouds werewere little islands. The cloud sea slowly floated, and the white cloud energy was faintly discernable like mist.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, a big, bright-green bird shot out of the cloud sea, its wings stroked as it furiously flew into the sky and disappeared into the distance in a blink.</p><br/><p>\u201cSuch fast speed!\u201d</p><br/><p>The people that saw this scene all inhaled sharply. The speed of this green bird was something who even A Wen, the fastest one among them, could only gape at.</p><br/><p>The expressions of Zuo Mo and few others also changed slightly. They exchanged looks with each other and saw the gravity in each other\u2019s eyes. The green bird\u2019s grade was not low. In Sky Moon Jie, it would definitely be at the top of the food chain.</p><br/><p>If the grade of the yao beast in an area were very high, it meant that there would not be a high population of xiuzhe in this area and that the area was not well explored. Yao beasts were not friendly to xiuzhe. Xiuzhe liked to hunt yao beasts, and yao beasts were also showed a similar interest and fondness for xiuzhe.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere aren\u2019t any people on these islands.\u201d Wei Sheng stared at the island as they passed by. The island was not very large, about fifty mu. Because it was so close, the group could see it very clearly. There were ruins of buildings on the island which indicated that xiuzhe had once resided there.</p><br/><p>Thinking about the green bird that had darted by, everyone\u2019s expressions were not very good. Were the ling beasts here left to roam free to such a degree?</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone, be careful,\u201d Zuo Mo ordered.</p><br/><p>Everyone immediately focused and prepared their defenses. However, the reality proved they had worried needlessly. Other than that shockingly fast green bird, they did not encounter anything significant along the way.</p><br/><p>After the initial novelty passed, the endless cloud sea quickly became dull and boring in everyone\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>After more than a dozen days, just as everyone was feeling restless, an enormous island appeared in their vision. Everyone\u2019s morale rose, but no one had expected that they had to continue flying for three more days before they could be considered near to this island.</p><br/><p>They finally realized that the enormity of this island far surpassed their imagination! When they flew closer, this feeling increased. It was like a colossal sea turtle silently floating in the cloud sea. In front of it, the xiuzhe were insignificant like specks of dust!</p><br/><p>Approaching the large island, the number of fragmented little islands they could see increased. They were scattered randomly and in various sizes. Some were just dozens of zhang in diameter, while others were tens of thousands of mu in area.</p><br/><p>When Zuo Mo and the others flew close, a xiuzhe flew out from one of the little islands. This xiuzhe\u2019s face looked clever. He wore a cloth robe and crisply stopped fifty zhang from the Black Turtle. He made a bow and shouted loudly, \u201cThis one is Shang Wei Ming. Bosses, welcome to Dong Sheng Cloud Island. This one hopes your business is prosperous and flourishing! Do you require a guide? This one is a local, so if Boss wants to know of something, sell or buy, this one might be able to offer some scarce effort.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shang Wei Ming\u2019s face was open without any shyness.</p><br/><p>\u201cGuide?\u201d Zuo Mo felt it was interesting. After thinking a while, he shouted his order, \u201cGet Bao Yi to come.\u201d</p><br/><p>As he finished, he flew out of the Black Turtle first. Wei Sheng was worried for Zuo Mo\u2019s safety and also flew out. The other people inside the ship were alert and guarded, to ensure they could respond the moment they encountered any danger. They had slaughtered their way out of Bloody Sky Metropolis Jie and had formed the habit of being alert at any moment.</p><br/><p>Shang Wei Ming saw two people fly out of the ship. His expression was steady but he released a breath inside. It seemed that this business was possible!</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is Dong Sheng Cloud Sea?\u201d Zuo Mo asked curiously.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, this is Dong Sheng Cloud Sea.\u201d Shang Wei Ming bowed towards the two. \u201cWhat do I call both bosses?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy name is Zuo,\u201d Zuo Mo said with a smile. He pointed at Wei Sheng and said, \u201cHe is Wei.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood day, Boss Zuo and Boss Wei,\u201d Shang Wei Ming raised his folded hands in salute and gave his greetings. He examined the two people. Seeing their attire was normal, he was slightly disappointed inside. The black ship behind them was very normal. Shang Wei Ming was increasingly sure that Zuo Mo and the others were just small business merchants.</p><br/><p>However, while he felt disappointed inside, he did not allow it to show it on his face. No matter what, it was good that he had business today.</p><br/><p>\u201cHave you come to Dong Sheng Cloud Sea for business or to visit friends?\u201d Shang Wei Ming looked as Zuo Mo and asked. He could see that Zuo Mo was the decision-maker.</p><br/><p>At this time, Bao Yi hurried over. He bowed towards Zuo Mo, \u201cBoss,\u201d and then bowed towards Wei Sheng. \u201cTeacher Wei!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Bao is too courteous,\u201d Wei Sheng said humbly.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo wasn\u2019t polite. \u201cOld Bao, you came at the right time. You can deal with the business affairs. This Mister Shang is our guide. You can deal with the fees and such.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bao Yi hurriedly said, \u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shang Wei Ming\u2019s heart jumped. The decision-maker\u2019s clothing was normal but his presence and tone of voice was definitely not of a small business merchant. He also smelt something familiar from this person who was as thin as bamboo.</p><br/><p>It was the smell of a merchant!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is the daily fee, Mister Shang?\u201d Bao Yi raised his head, his eyes flashing with calculation.</p><br/><p>Shang Wei Ming focused. \u201cFive third-grade jingshi per day.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis price isn\u2019t high.\u201d Bao Yi nodded. He then slowly asked, \u201cWhat other services does Mister Shang provide?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bao\u2019s attitude, presence, and calculation caused Shang Wei Ming to realize that the person in front of him was an old-timer. His confidence of his positive speculations increased.</p><br/><p>This group was surely here to do big business!</p><br/><p>The smile on Shang Wei Ming\u2019s face grew more friendly. \u201cProviding directions is the most basic service. If you need to find shelter and food, this one can find appropriate inns and restaurants for everyone. This one is a local merchant and has a small network. This one also knows the local goods. If there is a need for information, this one can also find it, but this will require some additional jinshi.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Bao Yi took out fifteen pieces of third-grade jingshi. \u201cThis is the fee for three days. I hope to have a good partnership with Mister Shang.\u201d</p><br/><p>The other was generous in payment, and Shang Wei Ming\u2019s mood became even better. He took the jingshi and said humbly, \u201cTo serve you is this one\u2019s honor.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing the two finish their conversation, Zuo Mo smiled and opened up, \u201cThis is the first time we have come to Cloud Sea Jie. We are unfamiliar with this place. Can Mister Shang give us an introduction?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo problem.\u201d Shang Wei Ming discretely put the jingshi into his pocket and continued. \u201cCloud Sea Jie is remote. Even though it was discovered early in recorded history, there haven\u2019t been many xiuzhe here. You must have seen the many abandoned cloud islands along the way?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, what happened?\u201d Zuo Mo hurriedly said.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe reason there are not many xiuzhe in Cloud Sea Jie is because we are currently overrun with yao beasts. Those cloud islands were occupied before, but as there are too many yao beasts in Cloud Sea Jie, those who are weak were eaten by the yao beasts.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you hunt and kill the yao beasts?\u201d Zuo Mo asked curiously. \u201cEvery part of a yao beast is treasure!\u201d</p><br/><p>Shang Wei Ming showed a grimace. \u201cIt\u2019s the fault of this cloud sea! This cloud sea is endless and extremely deep. No one knows how deep it is down there. These yao beasts mostly live inside the cloud sea with it as a barrier. This cloud sea is also very strange, it can almost completely block off ling energy. For many years, an unknown amount of people used to dive into the cloud sea to explore it; but though many went, only a few come back. Of those that came back, they usually have no gains. Gradually, few wanted or dared to go down anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen isn\u2019t it very dangerous above the cloud sea?\u201d Zuo Mo was frightened.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. The cloud sea is vast and filled with danger. Our jie\u2019s cloud islands can be counted in tens of thousands, but there are not many that are truly suited for xiuzhe to inhabit. Our Dong Sheng Cloud Sea is the biggest cloud sea. Other than this, Qi Luo Continent and Hu Ju Island are among the relatively large cloud islands. Please do not randomly fly among the cloud sea, it is very dangerous. There are transportation formations that go between the cloud islands. It is much safer to go through transportation formations. Between the cloud islands that do not have transportation formations, there are shipping routes that have defended cloud islands among the way. That is also a safer option.\u201d</p><br/><p>Finishing, he took out a jade scroll. \u201cThis has all the transportation formations and shipping routes of Cloud Sea Jie. It isn\u2019t worth much, but a token of this one to give to Boss.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shang Wei Ming\u2019s action clearly showed his intentions of forming a relationship. Zuo Mo naturally understood. He smiled and took the jade scroll. \u201cMany thanks, Brother Shang.\u201d He took out a third-grade flying sword. \u201cA little token of our own, nothing major. Brother Shang, please accept it!\u201d</p><br/><p>Shang Wei Ming took the flying sword. Taking it in hand, he channeled ling power through it. The smile on his face increased as he gave his thanks. Intermediate third-grade water element flying sword, this could be sold for a pretty good price. However, he did not plan on selling it. His son was not far from entering ningmai and this flying sword was perfect for him.</p><br/><p>If it had just been a guess before, now he was almost certain this Boss Zuo was a big boss!</p><br/><p>Using a third-grade flying sword as the first move, this was the first time he had encountered such a thing! He couldn\u2019t help but rejoice how wise his decision had been. It was really profitable this time!</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo looked around. \u201cAre there any yao beasts where we are now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shang Wei Ming hurried to say, \u201cBoss, don\u2019t worry. Our Dong Sheng Cloud Island has a large formation. Yao beasts will not come here. See how there are many cloud islands in this area, they are all protected by the large formation, and we do not need to worry about our safety. If Boss wants to have a long stay, you may want to buy one and turn it into a private yard.\u201d</p><br/><p>They conversed as they slowly flew towards the large island, the Black Turtle following closely behind them.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, these cloud islands can be bought? Where can one buy them? What are the prices?\u201d Zuo Mo was instantly interested. The Black Turtle was spacious on the inside, but after staying in for a long time, they had all, naturally, become restless. Searching for Water Cloud Embryo would not be a not a quick matter. This place was relatively safe, and it was good to have a place to put their feet down.</p><br/><p>Shang Wei Ming just mentioned this in passing. He hadn\u2019t thought that Zuo Mo would really be interested. He instantly became alert. According to the rules of the island: if he really could make this deal, he could receive a significant commission.</p><br/><p>Shang Wei Ming seemed to see countless jingshi beckoning him!</p><br/><p>Good fortune had come so suddenly!</p><br/><p>Translator Ramblings: Think of it this way, Fang Xiang is trying to keep the pace up so reader will not be bored reading about people travelling.</p><br/><p>Also, I think there was a misunderstanding based on my translation last chapter. The \u201cMeat Grinder\u201d doesn\u2019t refer to Zuo Mo or Gongsun Cha, it is referring to the chaotic situation they left behind when they killed Ming Lie. Fang Xiang is implying Zuo Mo\u2019s battle has set off the war and caused high fatalities. Essentially, they were the spark to lit off the firestorm.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

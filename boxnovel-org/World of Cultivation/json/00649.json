Everyone else stared at the jie map with similarly terrible expressions.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe do not have enough battalions,\u201d Wei Ran said gravely. \u201cBased on Gu Liang Dao\u2019s speed and the path of his advance, our path to Daren will soon be cut off!\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone was silent. What Wei Ran said was what they were most worried about.</p><br/><p>Orchid Home Jie was at the border of Hundred Savage Realm and Dark Realm. Theoretically, it was the best meeting point. Zuo Mo could first reach Orchid Home Jie to meet up with everybody before heading to Dark Realm.</p><br/><p>Yet no one had expected for Gu Liang Dao to pop out of nowhere. He coincidentally appeared on the path that Zuo Mo would take to Orchid Home Jie. Xi Xuan had been putting in great effort recently, and caused there to be a higher risk that this path would be cut off.</p><br/><p>But Lil\u2019 Miss did not have enough battalions on his hands. Orchid Home Jie was not safe. With the yao as their neighbours, he needed a strong battalion to defend it. If they lost control of the chaos rift, everyone understood what that meant.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have already sent the highest priority order to Golden Crow Camp,\u201d Gongsun Cha said gravely. \u201cIf it really comes down to it, we will position Black Turtle Camp here, and Vermillion Bird Camp would be responsible for advancing.\u201d</p><br/><p>The mood inside the hall was pressuring. Gongsun Cha\u2019s idea was extremely risky. Black Turtle Camp was strong, but no one knew if they could hold this chaos rift.</p><br/><p>The yao battalion in the neighboring Black Stone Jie was strong. Gongye Xiao Rong had disappeared, but if there was a chance, he would definitely pop out to take a bite.</p><br/><p>If Lil\u2019 Miss was not here in person, in such serious circumstances, even with Vermillion Bird Camp, no one dared to claim absolute confidence in defending the chaos rift.</p><br/><p>But even if Black Turtle Camp could hold this place, it was even more difficult for Vermillion Bird Camp to carve open a path.</p><br/><p>Gu Liang Dao\u2019s appearance completely disrupted all of Lil\u2019 Miss\u2019 plans.</p><br/><p>If the path was cut off, then there was no meaning to holding Orchid Home Jie. They would need to take a long detour before they could meet up with Zuo Mo. Wei Ran and the others had already calculated this alternative route. If the path was cut off, the nearest point they could meet up with Zuo Mo was one where they had to pass through sixty two jie!</p><br/><p>One battalion passing through sixty two jie! Just the number of fights they would encounter was enough to make their scalp feel numb.</p><br/><p>In comparison, it was more realistic to fight for control of the path against Gu Liang Dao. Gongsun Cha did not feel any fear towards Gu Liang Dao and Xi Xuan.</p><br/><p>But he did not have enough forces in his hands. There was nothing to do if he did not have the manpower. Right now, all these jie needed people standing guard.</p><br/><p>Compared to those large sects, their foundations were still too thin.</p><br/><p>Lil\u2019 Miss stood there silent.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>In the night, three figures landed and flashed through the air like three ghosts.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo and A Gui were next to each other with Ceng Lian\u2019er half a step behind. Zuo Mo originally didn\u2019t want A Gui to come but A Gui whose shen power had increased seemed to have her own ideas now. She did not make a sound, but she would always stay within a step of Zuo Mo. It was useless no matter what Zuo Mo said to her. Ceng Lian\u2019er following them left Zuo Mo puzzled but he did not stop her. She was a very good assistant, and since she wanted to follow, he would let her.</p><br/><p>Ceng Lian\u2019er was like a wisp of smoke in the night. Her movements were elegant and held a thread of eeriness.</p><br/><p>A Gui was like a puppet that was completely void of life. She was completely silent. Her bare feet moved in her usual pace . But there was no flow of air, no sound, and no vibrations.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo\u2019s movements were like that of a cat, relaxed and agile. His movements were balanced as though he was sliding through the air.</p><br/><p>All three were wearing masks. These were masks that Zuo Mo had just made and did not have any other use except to stop people from seeing their true faces. The three had even changed the shape of their figures. If they did not take off their mask, no one would think it was them.</p><br/><p>Looking at the sumptuous palace in front of them, a light flashed through Zuo Mo\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>Xiao Guo! Li Ying Feng!</p><br/><p>I\u2019m coming!</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>\u201cGreat Peace Treasure Pavilion \u2026 \u2026\u201d Princess Xin sighed lightly. She seemed to be murmuring to herself and that pair of eyes that enchanted countless people showed bewilderment and helplessness. She murmured in light voice, \u201cIs this fate?\u201d</p><br/><p>She thought of the shocking scene from last night. At that time, the entire Mo Skill Stele forest had seemed to breathe. She almost cried.</p><br/><p>In the corner, a warrior covered in thick armor stood with a sword the size of a door. There was no opening on his entire body. Even his face was securely covered. No one knew of his true features.</p><br/><p>Everyone knew that Princess Xin had a heavily armored guard with her, but no one had ever seen him fight. He never spoke and only stood behind Princess Xia with that sword of his as he ignored the suitors.</p><br/><p>Princess Xin rubbed the chain ornament on her forehead, something that she never took off, and sighed. Her expression was extremely lonely. She curled up like a cat afraid of the cold.</p><br/><p>There was none of the confidence and elegance that she usually had.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, the statue-like armored guard suddenly moved with an unusual agileness that was not clumsy at all.</p><br/><p>He appeared next to the door.</p><br/><p>Princess Xin\u2019s eyes were wide as she looked at the heavy armor guard in shock. It was the first time she had seen him react so strongly.</p><br/><p>What had happened?</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>\u201cPrincess, sleep early.\u201d Zhu Ke whose hair and beard were white looked benevolently at Princess Wan as though she was his own grandchild. As Princess Wan was someone he had watched grow up since she was little, she was like his granddaughter.</p><br/><p>\u201cGrandpa Zhu, is there really a Great Peace Treasure Pavilion?\u201d Princess Wan\u2019s eyes were wide and her expression curious.</p><br/><p>Zhu Ke couldn\u2019t help but give a smile. His wrinkle-covered face crinkled. \u201cDoes Princess like treasure pavilion?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes yes! It seems very interesting. Grandmaster Shi Zi Ming is so strong, there must be many treasures.\u201d Princess Wan\u2019s eyes were full of longing.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha!\u201d Zhu Ke couldn\u2019t help but laugh. He affectionately caressed Princess Wan\u2019s hair. \u201cIf Princess wants it, this old servant will go search and see if there are any when the time comes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Princess Wan exclaimed happily. \u201cThat\u2019s great! Great Peace Treasure Pavilion, it makes people excited just thinking about it! It is much more interesting than eating with those people!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt has been hard for Princess these past few days!\u201d Zhu Ke said caringly.</p><br/><p>Princess Wan shook her head. \u201cI can help Daddy like this, it is not a hardship!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPrincess is really mature!\u201d Zhu Ke praised. Suddenly, his hand imperceptibly stilled. He said in a gentle voice, \u201cPrincess, go to sleep, it is late.\u201d</p><br/><p>An indistinguishable presence spread. Princess Wan\u2019s eyelids became heavy. She yawned and said, \u201cGrandpa Zhu \u2026 \u2026 I\u2019m sleeping \u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Before she could finish, she entered her dreams. Zhu Ke carefully tucked the blanket around her. When he slowly turned around, a thread of harshness flashed through his eyes.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>\u201cHas the matter of the Mo Skill Steles been resolved?\u201d There was no smile on Princess Xia\u2019s smile like there usually was and her tone was harsh.</p><br/><p>\u201cPrincess, no!\u201d the subordinate trembled and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou trash!\u201d Princess Xia\u2019s face was cold. \u201cHow many years has the family stationed you here for? You are unable to solve such a minor matter? And Great Peace Treasure Pavilion! Such a great matter and you did not hear a thing!\u201d</p><br/><p>The subordinate did not dare to even breath. Everyone knew if they argued with the princess now, it would end terribly for them!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat clues are there about the rumors of the Great Peace Treasure Pavilion?\u201d Princess Xia continued to ask severely. \u201cAfter so many years and no one knows a thing, yet suddenly the whole world knows! There is definitely something going on!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis subordinate is useless \u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Pia, a incense pot landed on this mo\u2019s face and blood instantly flowed. This mo did not dare to move and allowed the blood to drip down his face onto the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cTrash! A group of trash!\u201d Princess Xia panted angrily. Her flushed chest seemed to almost pop out but no one dared to look.</p><br/><p>A moment later, Princess Xia\u2019s anger settled. She said coldly, \u201cXiao Mo Ge? If you say you are still not able to tell me anything, then you can die in front of me.\u201d</p><br/><p>This mo hurriedly said, \u201cThis subordinate has made a thorough investigation of Xiao Mo Ge! He first appeared in Shattered Stone Jie. One of the women with him is the daughter of the jie master Ceng Yi. Ceng Yi is a white fang snake mo and has cultivated the White Fang mo physique. He had once refused the invitation of Marshal Yu. He also killed one of Marshal Yu\u2019s subordinates. Xiao Mo Ge\u2019s subordinates are Guard Camp who came from a very distant place. Right now, their earliest appearance that we have tracked is in Little Savage Jie which is now in the hands of someone called Shi Dong. This person is not very strong but is a pretty good battle general.\u201d</p><br/><p>Princess Xia showed some interest. The subordinate\u2019s investigation was very detailed but it held many strange details. She understood the subordinates well. They might be useless, but if they did not investigate thoroughly, they would not dare to speak.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you think of Xiao Mo Ge?\u201d she suddenly asked.</p><br/><p>The subordinate stilled. He hesitated and then gritted out, \u201cThis subordinate thinks that Xiao Mo Ge is the most outstanding genius that this subordinate has seen in all these years! He can rank with Qi Diao Yu!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRank with Qi Diao Yu \u2026 \u2026\u201d Princess Xia had an amused expression. She waved her hand and said lazily. \u201cWipe up the blood and leave!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d The subordinates hurriedly retreated as though they were pardoned.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d Princess Xia suddenly asked. The person the question was directed to was her maid. This maid was about forty years old with an average appearance. There wasn\u2019t any presence to her.</p><br/><p>The middle-aged maid said, \u201cThe Great Peace Treasure Pavilion is real.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know!\u201d Princess Xia raised an eyebrow. \u201cAnd then?\u201d</p><br/><p>At this time, the middle-aged maid\u2019s expression changed. She turned to look towards the window.</p><br/><p>At this time, a clear voice came from a distance, \u201cWhich coward dares to break into the princess\u2019 residence in the middle of the night? Come out! Beg for forgiveness from the princesses! Do not dirty ye\u2019s hands!\u201d</p><br/><p>Translator Ramblings: Poor Lil\u2019 Miss having to deal with this entire mess.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

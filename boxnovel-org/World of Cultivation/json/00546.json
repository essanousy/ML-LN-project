His expression changed rapidly and he was astounded.</p><br/><p>Captain level!</p><br/><p>Dong Zi\u2019s Shattered Stone Strike had reached the skill level of captain level!</p><br/><p>Uncle An Ya was captain level himself and was very familiar with this move\u2019s power. If he used all his power, he could produce the same effect.</p><br/><p>Uncle An Ya knew Dong Zi\u2019s strength very well. He was the most talented among the youths of Shattered Stone Town, but he was far from reaching the captain level.</p><br/><p>But now \u2026 \u2026 captain level!</p><br/><p>Uncle An Ya couldn\u2019t help but turn to look at Zuo Mo in A Gui\u2019s arms. There wasn\u2019t any expression on Zuo Mo\u2019s face. His gaze was also normal and there didn\u2019t seem to be any change.</p><br/><p>Wasn\u2019t he shocked?</p><br/><p>Uncle An Ya almost didn\u2019t believe his eyes. However, he had gone into the world and seen more, and he knew more than the people here.</p><br/><p>A Zuo\u2019s origins were not simple!</p><br/><p>Thinking back to it, A Zuo and A Gui had walked out of the Gobi Desert. In the past, he had felt that these two had great luck but thinking carefully now, how could they not have any strength and still managed to survive weeks in the Gobi Desert? How could they be simple people?</p><br/><p>Uncle An Ya grimaced inside. It seemed that he was getting old, and actually had misjudged these two young people.</p><br/><p>His gaze landed back on Dong Zi. Dong Zi clearly was frightened by his own move. His face was panicked and he didn\u2019t know what to do. Uncle An Ya laughed.</p><br/><p>Captain level, Dong Zi was in captain level now, his future would be even brighter. If Shattered Stone Town could produce an expert, then everyone\u2019s lives would be much better. Uncle An Ya suddenly felt the heavy burden on his shoulders instantly became lighter.</p><br/><p>Uncle An Ya walked next to A Gui and said emotionally, \u201cA Zuo, thank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo said with a smile, \u201cAh, ah, Uncle, don\u2019t be courteous, this is something I should do!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI hadn\u2019t thought that Dong Zi would level up to captain level directly, it really is \u2026 \u2026\u201d Uncle An Ya couldn\u2019t keep the wonder out of his tone.</p><br/><p>\u201cCaptain level?\u201d Hearing this, Zuo Mo paused and then said to himself, \u201cNo wonder I felt it was slightly weak, so it is only captain level!\u201d</p><br/><p>Finishing, he ran into his sea of consciousness and started to discuss with Wei.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlpine Gorilla matrix is a colonel level mo matrix, why is Dong Zi only at the captain level?\u201d Zuo Mo asked Wei.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe change is a process. The mo matrix will continuously refine his flesh and blood until his body and the matrix truly become one and then his strength can break into colonel level,\u201d Wei explained.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo finally understood.</p><br/><p>Talking to Wei, Zuo Mo did not notice that Uncle An Ya\u2019s expression had froze.</p><br/><p>Slightly weak \u2026 \u2026 captain level \u2026 \u2026</p><br/><p>A beat later, Uncle An Ya refocused. He increasingly felt that Zuo Mo was even more mysterious. Where did A Zuo come from?</p><br/><p>Those with captain level strength were unable to enter those elite battalions but definitely had no problem being admitted to those normal battalions. In little places like Shattered Stone Town, people at the captain level were the strongest.</p><br/><p>As expected, they came from big places!</p><br/><p>Uncle An Ya reflected inside.</p><br/><p>\u201cUncle, Uncle, I\u2019m very strong now, very strong!\u201d Dong Zi charged over excitedly.</p><br/><p>\u201cVery powerful?\u201d Zuo Mo heard this and spoke, \u201cJust captain level.\u201d</p><br/><p>Just captain level \u2026 \u2026</p><br/><p>Uncle An Ya perceptively closed his mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour body has not been completely tempered, the mo matrix has not merged into your flesh, you do not have a mo physique and the mo skills you practice \u2026 \u2026 oh\u201d Zuo Mo finally remembered that the one teaching Dong Zi was Uncle An Ya. Uncle An Ya was right beside him.</p><br/><p>Uncle An Ya laughed freely. \u201cA Zuo, don\u2019t be polite, Uncle knows his skill, and it really isn\u2019t anything.\u201d Immediately after, An Ya turned and said sternly to Dong Zi, \u201cListen carefully to A Zuo, remember everything that A Zuo tells you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Uncle An Ya was clear that this was a one-in-a-thousand chance for Dong Zi!</p><br/><p>Dong Zi clearly did not understand. He said blankly, \u201cI will listen to A Zuo, he\u2019s so strong!\u201d</p><br/><p>This boy\u2026 but even a stupid mo has stupid good fortune! Uncle An Ya did not state it explicitly. He felt very happy inside and then said, \u201cEn, listen carefully to A Zuo. I will first take care of them.\u201d Finishing, he pulled Dong Zi\u2019s parents away.</p><br/><p>\u201cA Zuo, tell me, I\u2019ll listen to you!\u201d Dong Zi patted his chest and said in a loud voice.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo looked at Dong Zi\u2019s face filled with sincerity and felt a thread of guilt.</p><br/><p>Ge is really too evil! Seducing such an innocent youth to nurture him into a strong sidekick \u2026 \u2026</p><br/><p>He felt guilt but when the words reached his mouth, it became, \u201cHm hm, I have a very high-intensity cultivation plan here. If you can finish it, you might rise to colonel level!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Dong Zi\u2019s eyes were bright and filled with desire.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you can complete it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI will definitely complete it!\u201d Dong Zi said in a loud voice as though he was swearing an oath. His face was filled with determination.</p><br/><p>\u201cSuch a brave youth!\u201d Wei praised. \u201cYou are becoming more and more devious.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo ignored Wei and said, \u201cHowever, Dong Zi, you have to promise me something.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSomething? A Zuo, speak.\u201d Dong Zi asked curiously.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can see that my present state is not good and A Gui is very soft and weak. My family has already sent people to get us but they are too far away. They will probably arrive after a long time. During this time, you have to protect A Gui and I.\u201d Zuo Mo\u2019s tone was serious.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, you and A Gui are so weak. A Zuo, you might understand a lot but your body is too weak.\u201d Dong Zi\u2019s face was matter-of-fact. Suddenly, his expression became nervous. \u201cA Zuo, is someone targeting you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh, no, this is just in case.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good, that\u2019s good!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>Dong Zi becoming captain level caused a ruckus in Shattered Stone Town and Ka Zhuo\u2019s reputation had become unrivalled. Countless parents came with their children to find Ka Zhuo and Ka Zhuo was in a sorry state dealing with them.</p><br/><p>No one came to bother Zuo Mo. Zuo Mo\u2019s sickly looking appearance caused people to not bear to disturb him.</p><br/><p>In the sea of consciousness.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have an idea,\u201d Zuo Mo said seriously, \u201cwhat if I also engrave a mo matrix into myself?\u201d</p><br/><p>Pu Yao and Wei were shocked by Zuo Mo\u2019s idea.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are not a mo,\u201d Pu Yao was the first to object.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut I have achieved the Great Day mo physique,\u201d Zuo Mo said unhesitatingly.</p><br/><p>Pu Yao was silent. He finally remembered that this freak had made it to the Great Da mo physique even though he was not a mo.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat kind of mo matrix do you want to engrave?\u201d Wei asked gravely.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy body right now is like a volcano that is about to erupt. The power inside is increasing, and the collisions are becoming more violent. The end result is exploding.\u201d Zuo Mo was calm as though he was describing something unrelated to him. His tone was calm and composed. \u201cThe best method is to reorganize the powers in my body back to their state from before, but it is too difficult and I do not know where to start. The other way is to strengthen the volcano by making the mountain stronger and harder to break through.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cInteresting! Even though it cannot solve the root problem, we can try,\u201d Wei said. \u201cBut the effect of low level mo matrixes will not be strong with your present state. Your physical powers are also in chaos so you probably cannot activate high level mo matrixes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo nodded and said, \u201cYes, I want to engrave a portion of a mo matrix on my arm. When the mo matrix is engraved, the blood and flesh there would recover. It would be like a strong barrel. I will then try to direct the powers into the barrel. This way, the other parts of my body would not contain these chaotic powers, and can recover more quickly.\u201d</p><br/><p>He turned around and said to Pu Yao, \u201cYou said last time you had a yao art that could guide the powers in the body out? Since it can guided out, then it definitely can be used to guide the powers to my arm.\u201d</p><br/><p>Pu Yao and Wei sank into deep thought.</p><br/><p>But quickly, the two raised their head simultaneously and their eyes flashed with an excited light.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe yao art needs to be changed slightly, en, but not by very much.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe mo matrix has to be strong, but only has to be strong. With this kind of requirement, a mo matrix is easy to find!\u201d</p><br/><p>Once the direction was confirmed, the rest of the matter was not very hard for experts like Pu Yao and wei.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo was slightly excited. He finally had hope of bidding farewell to this paralyzed state.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is the mo matrix for the Thousand Layer Iron Cowrie, colonel level mo matrix, very suited to you. The mo matrix is not complex. This is a mollusc that lives deep in the sea, each is the size of a fist. Its outer shell is one of the hardest materials in the world and can tolerate shocking amounts of power.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wei quickly found a suitable mo matrix. The mo matrixes that Pu Yao collected were mostly powerful and great mo matrixes, but in terms of how much he knew, he could not compare to Wei, especially in obscure areas.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt really isn\u2019t complex.\u201d Zuo Mo examined it for a long time.</p><br/><p>Pu Yao also produced the recipe needed. He had studied mo matrixes for a long time, even longer than Zuo Mo. This was not hard for him.</p><br/><p>But when Zuo Mo gave the recipe to Ka Zhuo, Ka Zhuo\u2019s expression became strange.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs there a problem?\u201d Zuo Mo saw something was not right.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, the materials on here \u2026 \u2026\u201d Ka Zhuo said slowly, \u201care very expensive \u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cVery expensive?\u201d Zuo Mo blanked.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Teacher, very expensive! Like this, Date Fish Bone Powder, this student has only heard of this, and has never seen it before. This Blood Gelatin, this student has never seen it before, and it is definitely not sold in most shops \u2026 \u2026\u201d Ka Zhuo stammered out.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo became depressed.</p><br/><p>He finally got a plan with some hope but found that his jingshi, oh, mo bei, wasn\u2019t enough!</p><br/><p>Even more depressing was that it wasn\u2019t that Zuo Mo didn\u2019t have the wealth, but that he couldn\u2019t take the jingshi out!</p><br/><p>Was there anything more tragic than this?</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo cried inside.</p><br/><p>An unfamiliar voice suddenly interrupted Zuo Mo\u2019s grieving.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello, Mister Zuo.\u201d</p><br/><p>The one who spoke had a very deep voice with a unique resonance.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo looked up and examined the person. A tall and proportional figure wrapped in dark green armor. Dark red eyes looked at Zuo Mo without any hint of warmth.</p><br/><p>Colonel level!</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo instantly discovered the other\u2019s strength from the presence the other exuded.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo\u2019s heart shook and felt a thread of danger.</p><br/><p>Translator Ramblings: Lil\u2019 Cliffy makes a comeback.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

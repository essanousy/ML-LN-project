The Light Void Wings shook slightly, and his figure disappeared in the air.</p><br/><p>The Seventh, Ninth and Tenth Divisions of Vermillion Bird Camp attacked at the same time like three blades flashing across the sky. With the presence of death, they viciously sliced at Elder Mei.</p><br/><p>Boom!</p><br/><p>Everyone felt their vision darken, the earth shake like the world was ending. And then the sky filled with a blinding light illuminated the sky, formed from countless streams of fire shooting in all directions before disappearing.</p><br/><p>All of Bright Water City was alarmed by such a terrifying collision. Countless xiuzhe flew into the sky and looked with terror in the direction of Hundred Flower Valley.</p><br/><p>The powers that had been preparing to come to the aid of Hundred Flower Valley saw this. They were shocked and stopped their movements.</p><br/><p>This was a collision on the level of jindan!</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>Compared to the earth-shaking black serpent, Zuo Mo\u2019s attack was silent without even a whisper. Like a ghost, he appeared behind Elder Xiao. The glass-like right palm lightly pressed on Elder Xiao\u2019s glowingly alluring back.</p><br/><p>His action was warm, gentle, and without any presence. When Zong Ru saw Zuo Mo\u2019s move from a distance, his expression changed slightly. He felt awe that Boss could cultivate [Sky Glass Wave] to such a fantastical level.</p><br/><p>Elder Xiao\u2019s figure suddenly froze. She seemed to hear an authoritative low growl echoing throughout her body. The explosive power erupted like a volcano and the channels inside her body were instantly shredded. What made her feel as though she was going to die was the golden core inside her body had stopped revolving. No matter how she tried, the golden core did not move even a sliver.</p><br/><p>A hand suddenly grasped the golden core.</p><br/><p>Endless blackness swallowed her like a tide.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>Everyone in the Seventh, Ninth and Tenth Divisions raised their flying swords together. Everyone\u2019s blood was boiling in their bodies, their battle intent filled their bodies and almost causing them to combust. They furiously accelerated without keeping anything back. Accelerate! Continuous acceleration!</p><br/><p>There was only one goal in everyone\u2019s eyes!</p><br/><p>The leaders of the three divisions shouted at the same time, \u201cHundred Kill!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHundred Kill!\u201d</p><br/><p>The xiuzhe of the three divisions howled angrily, their flying swords slicing down. The three sword energies that flashed passed at high speed gave off a blinding light in the air as their killing intent locked onto Elder Mei.</p><br/><p>Elder Mei\u2019s hair was loose as she glared, blood seeping out of the corner of her mouth.</p><br/><p>Facing the three enormous sword energies, she had a slight smile. Wave after wave of attacks had pushed her nerves on edge. She had long been at the end of her rope, and just hanging on by a breath. The plum tree in her hand had broken into pieces a long ago, just leaving behind the bare main trunk.</p><br/><p>The three enormous sword energies headed straight at her face. The presence sharp sword essence was enough to freeze her blood.</p><br/><p>Was she going to be finally released?</p><br/><p>This was the last thought that flashed through her mind. The three enormous sword energies exploded at the same time. The blinding light consumed her.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>The Begonia Palace Lantern was destroyed. Elder Wang was heavily injured and spat out three mouthfuls of blood. The black serpent swam and coiled in the air, and growled successively. One of the black horns that had just grown had been broken. It clearly was very furious about that.</p><br/><p>The black serpent had a vicious look in its eyes. It suddenly turned to a ball of black energy and smashed towards Elder Wang.</p><br/><p>It came extremely quickly. Elder Wang\u2019s movement was affected by her injuries and she was struck full on by the black energy.</p><br/><p>Bam!</p><br/><p>Like a meteor, Elder Wang was thrown into the ground.</p><br/><p>The pitiful Elder Wang wasn\u2019t a body cultivating expert like Zuo Mo. Such a strong crash was a fatal blow to her weak body. She was instantly killed.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>Su Yue\u2019s face was pale white, her eyes filled with hopelessness. The death of three jindan elders was a loss that Hundred Flower Alliance could not bear. There was still a troop brimming with murderous intent in the sky. A thought suddenly flashed through her mind, was today the day that Hundred Flower Alliance would cease to exist?</p><br/><p>The Light Void Wings on Zuo Mo\u2019s back slowly faded. The rich and explosive power inside his body quickly disappeared like a retreating tide.</p><br/><p>He looked at the other people. No matter if it was Vermillion Bird Camp or Guard Camp, everyone was furiously panting for breath. It was possible to see how fierce these battles had been. But all of them had smiles on their faces. Only they, especially because they had experienced the battle with Clear Sky Old Forefather in Little Mountain Jie, could feel the difficulty of this battle, could feel the improvement of their strength!</p><br/><p>This battle had disturbed all of Bright Water City. Countless xiuzhe flew from Bright Water City towards Hundred Flower Valley.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo glanced at the battlefield and grabbed Su Yue.</p><br/><p>Su Yue seemed to have lost her soul. She did not resist Zuo Mo capturing her.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo was slightly reassured and said to Shu Long, \u201cYou guys go search and see if there is anymore people you are familiar with. We\u2019ll take all that you recognize.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shu Long was moved. Without another word, he nodded and left with Guard Camp.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo held Su Yue and led the group to start looting Hundred Flower Alliance. Su Yue\u2019s last thread of hope was destroyed and she was abnormally obedient.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo felt great shock at the wealth of Hundred Flower Alliance. It definitely was one of the richest sects he had ever seen.</p><br/><p>Ling Ying Sect which had been famed for its wealth in Sky Moon Jie, but it was very poor in comparison to Hundred Flower Alliance. Su Yue was skilled in management. After twenty years of accumulation, the wealth of this enormous sect caused Zuo Mo to sink into an extreme frenzy.</p><br/><p>In the storeroom, third-grade and fourth-grade materials were piled up in mountains. Fifth-grade materials were not rare. Zuo Mo even saw a large number of sixth-grade materials. His drool almost spilled out. There were all kinds of ling flowers, including the seeds of rare ling flowers.</p><br/><p>To a person like Zuo Mo who would even pluck the feathers off a goose, how could he pass on such a good opportunity?</p><br/><p>Everyone in the forging division were sent over to transport the materials to the slave transporting ships. Zuo Mo decided to loot all of Hundred Flower Valley.</p><br/><p>The treasure rooms of the elders gave Zuo Mo joyful surprises again, especially Elder Wang\u2019s room which held many of her craftwork. The great majority of these were fifth-grade talismans and above. Most of those were various kinds of flower lanterns. Even though there were not many items in the treasure rooms, but all of them were of very good quality.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo did not hesitate in sweeping them all into his ring.</p><br/><p>The jade scrolls, including the jade scrolls the elders collected, and the ones that Hundred Flower Alliance had bought or obtained through other channels were also swept clean by Zuo Mo.</p><br/><p>Looking at the disciples that fled in fear, Zuo Mo was filled with scorn. After he finished looting, Hundred Flower Alliance would truly be dead. If this was a cohesive sect, all the disciples would have started to attack at this time, and not just watch as the elders risked their lives.</p><br/><p>This had to be said to be the tragedy of Hundred Flower Alliance.</p><br/><p>Shu Long found Zuo Mo. His expression was grave, and his eyes pained and sorrowful, \u201cBoss, come look.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo stilled, and followed Shu Long into an extremely deep cave in the mountain valley. When he saw the terrifying scene, his skin uncontrollably prickled.</p><br/><p>Hundreds of xiu slaves had all kinds of strange ling flowers tangled on their bodies. The roots of these ling flowers were rooted in their bodies. Their gazes were unfocused, strange smiles on their faces. The ling flowers on their bodies were alluring as they were blooming. However, Zuo Mo who possessed Ling Eyes could clearly see the vitality of these xiu slaves were slowly being lost.</p><br/><p>It seemed as though something suddenly exploded inside Zuo Mo\u2019s body. An unprecedented anger swept his body like it was burning. He suddenly gripped Su Yue\u2019s throat, and jerked her in front. Su Yue\u2019s face was twisted as her eyes showed pain. Zuo Mo\u2019s viciousness and brutality made her feel terror.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou group of scum!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo squeezed the words one by one through his teeth. His hand tightened and crushed Su Yue\u2019s throat!</p><br/><p>Su Yue\u2019s gaze became muddled. Even until death, she could not understand how Zuo Mo could bear to act against her? Countless people showed goodwill towards her, and used all kinds of methods to curry her favour. She had always assumed no man would willingly kill her because of her unparalleled appearance!</p><br/><p>As long as she was docile and obedient, they wouldn\u2019t bear to.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo distastefully threw Su Yue to the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cBoss, what to do with them?\u201d Shu Long could not disguise the sorrow in his voice. As someone who had also been a xiu slave, he felt it even more deeply. He could detect the vitality of these xiu slaves were slipping away bit by bit into the ling flowers on their bodies.</p><br/><p>In Zuo Mo\u2019s mind, Pu Yao suddenly said to him, \u201cDon\u2019t remove those ling flowers. If you move them even one bit, they will immediately die.\u201d</p><br/><p>Pu Yao\u2019s voice contained a rare thread of anger. \u201cFlower slaves, I hadn\u2019t thought this method would have been passed down. Ling flowers grown on the bodies of flower slaves will take the flower slave\u2019s purest vitality. The ling flowers grown this way will be extremely high in quality. If you want to save them, there is only one method.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo finally understood why Hundred Flower Alliance had so many high grade ling flowers. The rage rampaged in his chest. He forcibly suppressed it, and asked in a deep voice, \u201cWhat method?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe primary energies of the flower slaves is being taken away, and they cannot escape death. There are only two ways to save them. The first is to replenish their energies using lingdan and such. The other method is to use reverse-absorption!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReverse-absorption!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEn, yes! The ling powers can absorb the primary energies and vitality of the flower slaves, so why can\u2019t the flower slaves absorb the primary energies and vitality of the ling flowers?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo\u2019s eyes lit up. \u201cHow do you reverse it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Pu Yao threw a ball of light to Zuo Mo.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you this [Flower Yao Coexistence Art].\u201d Pu Yao\u2019s voice was slightly heavy, and carried an imperceptible sorrow. \u201cIn the past, during the war between xiuzhe and yaomo, many yaomo were like them. After they were captured, they were implanted with ling flowers. They would die after a length of time after they were rescued. In order to save them, this [Flower Yao Coexistence Art] was created. I hadn\u2019t thought that this yao art would be used again after thousands after years.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo bit his lips and turned to say to Shu Long, \u201cTake them all onto the boat.\u201d</p><br/><p>A hint of joy flashed through Shu Long\u2019s eyes. Boss definitely had a solution. He and Guard Camp hurriedly transported the hundreds of flower slaves to the slave transporting boats.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo\u2019s mood was extremely bad. He felt there was a fire burning in his heart that could not be vented. He never thought of himself as an ally of justice. However, the treatment of the flower slaves had broken through his bottom line. He could not suppress his fury.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, he raised his head to glance at the sky and the several troops rolling in.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo suddenly smirked coldly.</p><br/><p>Translator Ramblings: Zuo Mo finally gets to loot a sect after missing Clear Sky Sect. Pu Yao gets another golden core but not all three. I\u2019m very curious how many jingshi is a golden core worth since they only seem to exist inside jindan and it is difficult to extract them.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

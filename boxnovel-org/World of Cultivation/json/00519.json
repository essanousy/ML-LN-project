Even though this incident had occurred so suddenly and was so implausible, it had happened in front of him!</p><br/><p>Everyone looked at Zuo Mo. Many people couldn\u2019t help but sigh inside\u2014as expected of Daren!</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo could not pay attention to them so much. His spirit was suppressed almost to the point of causing an internal injury, it took great effort to calm the energies roiling inside of him.</p><br/><p>But as more and more gazes looked at him, he felt he needed to give, oh, display more of the mannerisms of a boss.</p><br/><p>He straightened and coughed lightly. In the silence, it was unusually clear. He frightened himself.</p><br/><p>Ye Ling and the other\u2019s suddenly became alert, their expressions even more respectful.</p><br/><p>\u201cI say, this \u2026 \u2026\u201d When Zuo Mo started to speak, the presence of a boss instantly dissipated, \u201cyou guys want to pledge allegiance to me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Daren!\u201d Ye Ling\u2019s response was clean and crisp.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Zuo Mo asked curiously. His question attracted everyone\u2019s attention. Truthfully, no one understood what was going on.</p><br/><p>\u201cDaren has the potential to become king,\u201d Ye Ling unhesitatingly replied.</p><br/><p>Everyone liked hearing flattery. Zuo Mo was not an exception. He instantly gave a smile. \u201cYou have pretty good eyes, you managed to find me when I am hiding so deeply?\u201d</p><br/><p>Gu Ming Gong who just recovered suddenly had a strange expression. But when he glanced around and saw the seriousness on Shu Long and the other people\u2019s faces, he intelligently suppressed his impulse to laugh.</p><br/><p>Shu Long, A Wen, and the others threw gazes of praise at Ye Ling. As Zuo Mo\u2019s core troop and most loyal subordinates, Guard Camp was completely loyal to Zuo Mo. They originated as xiuzhe slaves. Compared to the old-timers of Vermillion Bird Camp, they were less skilled in the ways of social interaction and did not understand the customs of the xiuzhe world. Their thinking was simpler and even purer.</p><br/><p>In their minds, Zuo Mo was the most outstanding, powerful, and wisest Daren in the world!</p><br/><p>Even if Zuo Mo told them to jump into a fire pit, they would jump in together without any hesitation.</p><br/><p>In their minds, they only existed for Zuo Mo.</p><br/><p>Gu Ming Gong felt Ye Ling was only giving platitudes but Shu Long and the others did not think so. To be able to recognize Daren\u2019s strength in such a short amount of time, this guy had pretty good eyes!</p><br/><p>Unconsciously, Guard Camp\u2019s collective opinion of Ye Ling shot up.</p><br/><p>Ye Ling\u2019s words caused Zuo Mo to float and feel as though he was an immortal. The incident of almost getting internal injury just now was forgotten immediately.</p><br/><p>He grinned to the point his eyes were narrow lines. His face bloomed like a flower. \u201cPotential to become king? Ohoh, tell me, slowly, in detail!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes! Daren!\u201d Ye Ling thought that Zuo Mo was testing his abilities. He collected his thought with the utmost seriousness before he opened, \u201cDaren is young and has cultivated the Great Day mo physique. In all of the mo world, Daren could be called a genius. Situated in such a dangerous place, Daren was able to create such a powerful army and create such a situation. Daren has the signs of being a wise leader that can survive these troubled times. Only Daren who is strong, has talent, a resilient personality, and also one with great foresight, might become king!\u201d</p><br/><p>Shu Long and the others nodded and exchanged looks. As they communicated through their eyes, they showed expressions of agreement.</p><br/><p>Shrunken in the corner, Gu Ming Gong was gaping. As he looked at the smug Zuo Mo, he felt this was impossible. The person speaking was serious, the person being praised was also serious. There was no flattery, no insincerity. It was terribly sincere and honest conversation.</p><br/><p>But \u2026 \u2026</p><br/><p>The clever Gu Ming Gong opened his mouth a few times, but could not produce a word.</p><br/><p>Oh, it was a pity that Eldest Shixiong and Gongsun Shidi were not present \u2026 \u2026 ah, he had forgotten, forgotten, he should have recorded it with a jade scroll.</p><br/><p>Extremely happy, Zuo Mo instantly felt regret. This was one of those rare chances to grow face. He wanted everyone to see this.</p><br/><p>Finally struggling out of his regret, Zuo Mo smacked his lips with lingering hunger and coughed pretentiously. \u201cOh, alright! However, we need to be low-key, low-key!\u201d</p><br/><p>No wonder Daren was able to survive in the xiuzhe world until now and had even amassed such a group. He really understood the way of concealment!</p><br/><p>Ye Ling said with sincere reverence, \u201cYes, Daren!\u201d</p><br/><p>Having heard the flattery and having enjoyed it, Zuo Mo felt that leaving like this was not fair. He thought and then said, \u201cOh, since you have such sincerity, then from today onwards, you are Grey Camp. Shu Long will temporarily lead the camp, you will be the vice commander.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye Ling was overjoyed. \u201cThank you Daren for bestowing the name!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut from today onwards, you have to take note and not reveal your identity as mo,\u201d Zuo Mo reminded Ye Ling.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d Ye Ling was full of admiration. Daren was extremely meticulous.</p><br/><p>He turned his head and spoke a few words. The entire mo army changed their expressions. The mo that could enter the mo military all was of relatively strong strength and changing appearances were not hard for them. However, the mo sense of beauty was far different than xiuzhe. They preferred more rough and powerful appearances.</p><br/><p>Then Ye Long greeted Shu Long.</p><br/><p>Shu Long and the others had been xiuzhe slaves and oppressed by xiuzhe for a long time. They did not like xiuzhe but did not have any bad feelings about mo. Ye Ling\u2019s words just now had won their good opinion. Shu Long and the others felt as though Ye Ling spoke what they all thought!</p><br/><p>A feeling of walking on the same path rose.</p><br/><p>Shu Long said solemnly, \u201cI will treat Grey Camp fairly, everyone work hard!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d Ye Ling was full of excitement.</p><br/><p>Accidentally recruiting Grey Camp caused Zuo Mo\u2019s sneak attack journey to end in a strange manner but in all, he had still accomplished his objectives.</p><br/><p>Under the efforts of Guard Camp and Grey Camp, they quickly began setting up a new base at the chaos rift. Compared to the crude base that Ye Ling had, the scale of the new base was astounding.</p><br/><p>However, the mo grass sea was still uprooted. This was really too eye-catching.</p><br/><p>At this time, Ye Ling suddenly came to find Zuo Mo.</p><br/><p>\u201cDaren,\u201d Ye Ling said with hesitation.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Zuo Mo asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cDaren, please permit me to persuade Shi Dong Daren to surrender!\u201d Ye Ling gritted his teeth and said with determination.</p><br/><p>\u201cShi Dong?\u201d Zuo Mo stilled and then he reacted. \u201cYou mean the other mo army?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Daren,\u201d Ye Ling hurriedly said, \u201cShi Dong Daren was this subordinate\u2019s previous commander.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, tell me about him.\u201d Zuo Mo\u2019s interest was stirred.</p><br/><p>\u201cShi Dong Daren is born from a rare branch of the mantis mo called the Sky Mantis Mo. Shi Dong Daren is the most outstanding battle general this subordinate has ever seen. He is resilient and determent, extremely perceptive in battle. If he was not limited by his birth as a mantis mo, his accomplishments would not be limited to just so!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow is he compared to you?\u201d Zuo Mo asked curiously. Ye Ling\u2019s Mist Hand Seat had left him a deep impression.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis subordinate is inferior,\u201d Ye Ling said seriously, \u201cthis subordinate has always served as Shi Dong Daren\u2019s quartermaster.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo that\u2019s how it is \u2026 \u2026\u201d Zuo Mo instantly had the feeling he was making a great profit and hurriedly nodded, \u201cthen you can try!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye Ling was overjoyed. \u201cYes!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>Smoke wafted off Shi Dong\u2019s body. His grand cape was no torn and dirtied, his body covered in wounds of various sizes. He also had a tired expression.</p><br/><p>Beside him, there were only half of the organized troops that remained and all of them carried wounds.</p><br/><p>Shi Dong had not expected the other to be so powerful! Thinking about these nightmarish days of battle, his heart couldn\u2019t help but shudder.</p><br/><p>The enemy battle general was too powerful!</p><br/><p>Other than at the beginning when the two were at a standoff, Shi Dong had been forced to watch as the balance of battle slowly tilted towards the enemy.</p><br/><p>A slow yet resolute tilt!</p><br/><p>He had tried all the solutions he could think of but was still unable to stop the tilt.</p><br/><p>The other had suppressed them completely and did not give them any faults to use.</p><br/><p>He had never thought he would encounter such a terrifying opponent!</p><br/><p>Was this the legendary Xue Dong from Kun Lun? Or Tian Huan\u2019s Gongye Xiao Rong?</p><br/><p>Wasn\u2019t this Cloud Sea Jie? Wasn\u2019t this a remote little place that Four Realm Heaven disdained to enter?</p><br/><p>How could such a peerless battle general be here?</p><br/><p>A golden battle general!</p><br/><p>Only a golden battle general could suppress him to the point of hopelessness!</p><br/><p>Shi Dong was just a step away from becoming a gold battle general. If it wasn\u2019t for his mantis mo bloodline, maybe he would be a gold battle general already. Since a very early point in his life, he had rarely encountered a match for himself. He never lacked confidence when directing battle.</p><br/><p>But this time.</p><br/><p>Looking at the small groups of three and five sword xiu that were nearby in the sky, he bit down on his lips with a pale face.</p><br/><p>Just at this moment, a gasp of shock came from his vice commander.</p><br/><p>He suddenly turned around his face with a sword-sharp gaze.</p><br/><p>But when he saw the black insect in the vice commander\u2019s hand, he suddenly froze.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>\u201cA good opponent,\u201d Lil\u2019 Miss\u2019 voice was full of praise.</p><br/><p>No one dismissed his words. The hardiness of this troop far surpassed their expectations. Even though Vermillion Bird Camp had quickly gotten the advantage, the other still withstood their assault.</p><br/><p>Even though they could not stop the rising tide, the collapse in moral that people predicted had not occurred.</p><br/><p>Even fighting to now with only half of their battalion left, their morale was still shocking steady. If this was a normal battalion, they would have crumbled long ago.</p><br/><p>This kind of enemy was worthy of being respected.</p><br/><p>Ever since Lil\u2019 Miss created his own core scripture, his consciousness expanded rapidly by the day. His last shortcoming disappeared. Lil\u2019 Miss who had been strong to start with, had become extremely terrifying, unusually and abnormally terrifying!</p><br/><p>The advancement in skill caused by his increase in consciousness could be seen in this battle. From the moment the battle begun, the rhythm of battle was in his hands.</p><br/><p>From beginning to end, he didn\u2019t give the enemy on chance. Steadily and unrushed, with a method that was almost suffocating, he pressed on the other\u2019s space leaving them no room to maneuver.</p><br/><p>However, Lil\u2019 Miss still had a high opinion of Shi Dong.</p><br/><p>If he hadn\u2019t had a breakthrough in his consciousness recently, the other would have been significant trouble for him to defeat. If the battle was fought in those conditions, less than one third of Vermillion Bird Camp would remain, and it wouldn\u2019t have been zero fatalities like it was now.</p><br/><p>The other reason they had such an advantage was the enemy mo army\u2019s level was one lower than Vermillion Bird Camp. The investments that Zuo Mo made on Vermillion Bird Camp without any consideration for the cost finally showed their effects.</p><br/><p>Lil\u2019 Miss was sure that the other had power that was nearing that of a gold battle general.</p><br/><p>Of all of Turtle Island, only Gongsun Cha and Zuo Mo had the power to fight against him. Even Shu Long was lacking in comparison.</p><br/><p>It was a pity that Shi Dong encountered Gongsun Lil\u2018 Miss. The terrifying Lil\u2019 Miss that even the renowned Corps Commander Yu Heng had fallen at the feet of!</p><br/><p>Such a hardy opponent, Gongsun Cha sighed emotionally and turned to give the order to attack.</p><br/><p>\u201cPrepare to attack, let\u2019s finish this battle before sunset.\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Gongsun Cha\u2019s gaze stopped. He saw the enemy battle general leave the battle formation alone. The sword xiu at the front quickly flew back and reported to Gongsun Cha.</p><br/><p>\u201cDaren, they are surrendering!\u201d</p><br/><p>Translator Ramblings: I won\u2019t go so far to say they are fanatical, but Guard Camp has been pretty well indoctrinated. Poor Gu Ming Gong, he\u2019s surrounded.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

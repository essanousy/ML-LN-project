He could clearly feel the bone-aching coldness from the sword energy that was just touching his skin. All the hairs on his body were raised. He didn\u2019t tremble. It wasn\u2019t that he was bolstered by his bravery, but that he didn\u2019t dare to. He did his best to maintain his posture, afraid that the slightest bit of movement would cause the sword energy to move.</p><br/><p>For some unknown reason, he kept on feeling that if there was an accident, the sword energy at the tip of the flying sword would unhesitatingly cut into his neck.</p><br/><p>Maybe it was the steadiness of the flying sword, maybe it was Zuo Mo\u2019s eyes, maybe\u2026 \u2026</p><br/><p>It didn\u2019t matter that he knew Zuo Mo didn\u2019t dare to kill him but he didn\u2019t dare to gamble.</p><br/><p>\u201cI surrender.\u201d Lin Yuan\u2019s voice was dry and raspy, nothing remaining of the past conceit and proudness. It echoed in a patch of silence and could be heard clearly.</p><br/><p>The coldness disappeared from his neck without any warning.</p><br/><p>Lin Yuan\u2019s heart finally settled down. He swallowed, looking in terror at Zuo Mo and the Water Drop sword that was peacefully floating in front of his chest. There was only one thought in his head. This person couldn\u2019t be provoked!</p><br/><p>The spectators finally managed to react, dissolving into noise. Disbelief was on everyone\u2019s faces. No one could have thought that the entire battle would finish so quickly! When Lin Yuan took out the fourth-grade [Yang Emperor Sword], the great majority had already assumed his victory.</p><br/><p>The gap between fourth-grade and third-grade flying swords was an extremely large one!</p><br/><p>But, one move, and Lin Yuan lost.</p><br/><p>In the crowd of spectators, a cold light flashed through a pair of eyes hidden in the shadows.</p><br/><p>Lin Yuan focused. He pretended to be generous and opened, \u201cI lost. You can take down any of the talismans on my body.\u201d People like him, what they were afraid of losing was both the fight and their honor. Losing in battle wasn\u2019t major. He hadn\u2019t created his power based using physical power. But if he lost his reputation, then it was really sweeping the floor.</p><br/><p>His heart was still beating heavily. Please do not pick\u2026 \u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cThen the ling armor on Brother Lin\u2019s body.\u201d Zuo Mo said.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright!\u201d Lin Yuan rushed to answer, afraid Zuo Mo would take it back. He had been afraid that Zuo Mo would pick the fourth-grade [Yang Emperor Sword]. The [Moonwater Black Turtle Armor] might be a fine third-grade ling armor, and he had put a lot of effort into getting it, but it couldn\u2019t compare to [Yang Emperor Sword]. [Yang Emperor Sword] had been bestowed down by the sect leader. If it was lost, it would be bad for him.</p><br/><p>Lin Yuan rapidly took the ling armor off his body, throwing it to Zuo Mo, deliberately pretending to be forthright, \u201cBrother Zuo really is skilled, Lin Yuan has no compunctions about losing. I\u2019ll take Brother Zuo as my friend. In the future if you need any help, please speak!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo raised his hands in a greeting, \u201cBrother Lin\u2019s demeanor is extraordinary, this little brother admires it. To be able to interact with people like Brother Lin, this little brother feels very honored!\u201d His hands, however, were extremely fast and impolite in putting the [Moonwater Black Turtle Armor] onto his body.</p><br/><p>The [Moonwater Black Turtle Armor] was entirely black, constructed of thirty six black turtle shells, and forged with essence of moonwater. It was extremely durable. Zuo Mo could tell as he put the armor on that this was far better than the ling armor that Yan Le Shibo had given him. It was both comfortable and breathable, and the ling energy inside the Black Turtle armor slowly seeped into Zuo Mo\u2019s body, extremely pleasurable.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo felt extremely good inside, disregarding the sighs that came from the surroundings. Of course, he knew that, based on just the price, the fourth-grade [Yang Emperor Sword] that Lin Yuan had far surpassed this [Moonwater Black Turtle Armor]. However, this was also where he was the smartest. If he demanded the [Yang Emperor Sword], even though Lin Yuan would give the [Yang Emperor Sword] to him due to face, but that way, this incident would increase in severity. A fourth-grade flying sword, there wasn\u2019t many of those in Wu Kong Sword Sect. In all of the disciples, only Wei Sheng Shixiong\u2019s [Splitting Rainbow] was fourth-grade.</p><br/><p>Coveting this flying sword, that was waiting for the other\u2019s elders to come find him!</p><br/><p>Not just that, he would also enter into an unsolvable disagreement with Lin Yuan. The other would certainly hate him! Also, [Yang Emperor Sword] wasn\u2019t suited for Zuo Mo. At most, he could sell it for some jingshi. But [Moonwater Black Turtle Armor], he could use it right now. Wearing it on his body, his defensive power would increase dramatically. He would have more confidence in making a profit this time.</p><br/><p>On someone else\u2019s territory, being too arrogant meant a terrible death!</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo got a bargain and gave Lin Yuan enough face. Lin Yuan managed to keep possession of [Yang Emperor Sword] and got face, his mood instantly rose. As for the [Moonwater Black Turtle Armor], just a third-grade talisman, he didn\u2019t care that much.</p><br/><p>Lin Yuan threw a jade scroll at Zuo Mo, generously saying, \u201cThis jade scroll has the directions to use this [Moonwater Black Turtle Armor]. For this armor to land in the hands of a hero like Brother Zuo, this little brother is very honored.\u201d He then scanned the surroundings, and said clearly, \u201cBrother Zuo is one against five. Everyone should admire his courage. However, is our Ling Ying Sect those that take advantage of others? This unskilled one suggests that, after each of Brother Zuo\u2019s fights, he can rest for an hour to recover his ling energy, and be fair. How does everyone feel?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Yuan\u2019s actions instantly aroused the agreement of many people.</p><br/><p>\u201cLin Shixiong is really a honest person!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t think that a disciple of Ling Ying Sect could have a demeanor like this. It really isn\u2019t easy, isn\u2019t easy!\u201d</p><br/><p>No matter if it was the disciples of Ling Ying Sect or the other spectators, they all spoke praises.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo took the jade scroll, praising, \u201cBrother Lin is really a genuine person!\u201d</p><br/><p>However, the faces of the three people who were going to fight next were extremely bad, their eyes hateful as they glared at Lin Yuan. Chang Shixiong, however, was staring at Zuo Mo, his expression pondering.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo hadn\u2019t thought that the situation would change to be like this. Looking at the eyes of the other three people, Zuo Mo\u2019s heart was like a mirror. He he, this Lin Yuan really helped him out!</p><br/><p>With this jade scroll, he didn\u2019t need to search on his own. One hour, it was enough for him to broadly grasp how to use this ling armor. As to recovering ling energy, the previous fight had been so quick he basically hadn\u2019t used any ling energy at all.</p><br/><p>Lin Yuan bowed with his hands at Zuo Mo and proudly went back to his troop. That demeanor, there was nothing remaining of his expression when he had just lost. The shidi that were dependent on him gave a flood of praise for Lin Yuan\u2019s generosity. Lin Yuan pretended to calmly wave his hand, smirking inside. He didn\u2019t have good intentions in giving the instructions to the [Moonwater Black Turtle Armor] to Zuo Mo. He had gone first and lost. If his competitors won, then no matter how successful his performance was, it wouldn\u2019t make a difference.</p><br/><p>He had been generous in giving the [Moonwater Black Turtle Armor] to Zuo Mo and suggested that Zuo Mo could rest for an hour between each fight so to undermine the people after him. Increasing Zuo Mo\u2019s power was attacking his opponents. If those people also lost, he would have lost honorably. If the other people wanted to copy him, it definitely wouldn\u2019t have the same effect.</p><br/><p>The other people were not able to object to Lin Yuan\u2019s \u201creasonable\u201d suggestions. They could only stare with dark faces at Zuo Mo sitting cross legged on the ground.</p><br/><p>An hour later, Zuo Mo finally opened his eyes. He was extremely happy inside. As expected, this [Moonwater Black Turtle Armor] was very good. There were natural seal formations on the shells of black turtles. When they were used, flying swords would have a hard time breaking through.</p><br/><p>The second Ling Ying Sect disciple had been impatiently waiting long ago. When Zuo Mo opened his eyes, he walked out.</p><br/><p>He threw the bright red cape off his body, revealing the tight clothes underneath.</p><br/><p>When the other tore off the cape, Zuo Mo\u2019s eyes became straight.</p><br/><p>This guy\u2026 \u2026</p><br/><p>Disregarding the glowing ling armor on his body, not saying anything of the finest third-grade vambrace, Zuo Mo wouldn\u2019t even look at the bright red [Crimson Blood Bull Boots], his eyes were staring fixedly at the other\u2019s waist, wrist and chest\u2026 \u2026</p><br/><p>On the belt, there was a miscellany of paper seals, oh no, a collection of paper seals that would make someone think this guy sold seals for a living. Second-grade [Turtle Shell Seal], second-grade [Multiple Ghost Shadows], second-grade [Domineering Five Thunder Seal].</p><br/><p>On the wrists, a circle of one-use talismans were tied, second-grade [Sharp-headed Prickly Snake Shuttle], second-grade [One Star Galaxy], second grade [Light Rain Twin Sparrows]\u2026 \u2026</p><br/><p>There were a few pouches hanging on his chest, the smell of medicine wafting out. To Zuo Mo whose main profession was dan and medicine, he was too familiar with this smell. [Ling Returning Dan] that was used to recover ling energy, definitely not lower than second-grade; [Red Flower Dan] used to stem bleeding, also not lower than second-grade; the [Plum Colored Dan] that had a special smell, second-grade miasma\u2026 \u2026</p><br/><p>On the outside of his legs, hanging on one of them was a second-grade [Great Sun Moon Wheel], the other a second-grade [Sky Net].</p><br/><p>\u2026 \u2026</p><br/><p>Not just Zuo Mo, all the spectators were completely dumbstruck.</p><br/><p>Yan Ming Zi snickered, \u201cIt looks like Wang Shixiong is going all out. Using his ultimate medicine-seal-style from the start.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hu Shan looked with fear at Wang Shixiong who was standing fully armored, \u201cOnly upon personal experience can one know the power of Wang Shixiong\u2019s medicine-seal-style!\u201d He had once fought against Wang Shixiong, and had been completely suppressed for the entire battle, almost to the point he couldn\u2019t raise his head.</p><br/><p>Yan Ming Zi nodded sympathetically, \u201cThe shixiong that use medicine and seals in our sect cannot be counted, but to be like Wang Shixiong, to use the medicine-seal-style to such a degree, it had never happened before.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hu Shan, \u201cWang Shixiong does have some real skill.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Ming Zi added, \u201cHis wealth is really abundant!\u201d</p><br/><p>The two couldn\u2019t help but fall silent. The disciples of Ling Ying Sect might all have wealthy families, but there were still very drastic differences between them. Like Wang Shixiong, who dared to use seals and medicine to such a degree, if he didn\u2019t have the wealth to back it up, he wouldn\u2019t dare to do so. Everyone could understand the core philosophy of the medicine-seal-style \u2013 to use jingshi to win. While everyone could understand the concept, but it was another matter if they could do it.</p><br/><p>Wang Shixiong\u2019s seal-medicine-style once again proved a truth that had existed for countless years, this world, when you throw enough jingshi at someone, the great majority of the time, you could win.</p><br/><p>Maybe, as a person, Wang Shixiong was not as personable as Lin Yuan but his seal-medicine-style was still very famous in Ling Ying Sect. When he tore off the cape and revealed all he owned, all of the Ling Ying Sect disciples suddenly became excited. That was because, in Ling Ying Sect, the absolute majority of disciples believed deeply in one truth, the person with the most jingshi was the one that was right!</p><br/><p>To the xiuzhe that were passing by, this scene was an extremely heavy blow.</p><br/><p>These days, there was someone who could armor himself to such a frightening degree?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

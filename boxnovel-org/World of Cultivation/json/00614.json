Zuo Mo thought back to the feeling he just had, that spontaneous pause. The change was not a major one, yet the power had drastically changed. Guiding the influx of power but not immediately attacking with it required a higher level of control. If he had tried this in the past, after the Guard Camp members shouted \u201ckill,\u201d he would not have been able to. If the roaring killing essence was not used immediately in an attack, it would have backlashed against him.</p><br/><p>Control, this was the power of control, the control made possible at the general level.</p><br/><p>He finally understood somewhat why all the mo battle generals were strong people. Gathering the power of tens of thousands into one point, other than astounding coordination, it also required an astounding ability to control oneself. The influx of power would cause those with weak bodies would have exploded long ago.</p><br/><p>Just now, he suddenly found a wondrous use of shen power</p><br/><p>\u2014shen power could greatly increase the stress tolerance of his body.</p><br/><p>For normal mo, this might not be important, but for a mo battle general, this was crucial!</p><br/><p>The manipulation of shen power was Zuo Mo\u2019s weakness all this time. Both Ceng Lian\u2019er\u2019s and A Gui\u2019s shen power manipulation was exquisite. It was invisible and impossible to defend against, as well as being amazingly strong. But Zuo Mo could not reach their level. His manipulation of shen power was extremely crude. The gold leaf he obtained was like a book of the Heavens, hard to read and harder to understand. He only used shen power to cultivate his three powers. It was faster to cultivate shen power than the three powers individually.</p><br/><p>A Gui could not speak, and Zuo Mo didn\u2019t even consider asking Ceng LIan\u2019er for advice. He had decided to explore himself.</p><br/><p>Until today!</p><br/><p>That pause allowed him to find a completely new channeling method of shen power.</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo did not have Eldest Shixiong\u2019s persistence and resolve, his periods of hard work were usually done to allow him to slack off in the future, but he was undoubtedly a smart person.</p><br/><p>When he found that shen power would be channeled along with his mo physique, he instantly asked himself, could shen power be added into ling power? Could it merge with his spiritual consciousness?</p><br/><p>When these thoughts popped up, he became excited!</p><br/><p>Having had a good taste, Zuo Mo wanted to start experimenting immediately. However, he could only think about it at the moment. There were affairs to take care of right now.</p><br/><p>Right, there was profitable business.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>Everyone gradually recovered from the deathly silence and the terror stricken expressions faded. But when their eyes swept across Zuo Mo and the others, they couldn\u2019t help but shudder. Celestial Planet Guard silently distanced themselves from Zuo Mo\u2019s group. If it wasn\u2019t that Miss was here, they would have most likely turned and ran back to Shattered Stone Jie by now. Even Shou Ping started to miss the peaceful environment of Shattered Stone Jie.</p><br/><p>However, he noticed that Miss was not shocked by the success of Guard Camp.</p><br/><p>\u201cMake some tea,\u201d Ceng Lian\u2019er serenely spoke.</p><br/><p>Xian\u2019er seemed to wake up from a dream and started to boil water. However, there was still terror on her face and her hands were trembling.</p><br/><p>Ceng Lian\u2019er glanced at her. She faintly said, \u201cLet me do it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Purple Charcoal Stove, Black Mud Pot, a little tea table, a bamboo tea place, a sky blue little pot, white cups, and Ceng Lian\u2019er sitting there with her layered dress was like the flower blooming in the night. Her movements were elegant, her expression serene. Her seductive face was peerless. She seemed to be at ease as though she was in her own home.</p><br/><p>Sitting amongst the disordered battlefield, she was unusually eye-catching.</p><br/><p>The members of Celestial Plant Guard stared at each other and then they felt slight embarrassment. Miss was so composed and calm, but they had felt the urge to flee. This was an embarrassment!</p><br/><p>The restless Celestial Plant Guard quickly calmed down.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis subordinate is useless!\u201d Shou Ping admitted his crime with an ashamed expression.</p><br/><p>Ceng Lian\u2019er took a light sip, her long eyelashes blurry among the steam. The beautiful face became more ethereal as she said serenely, \u201cIt is good for you to see the power of the general level.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGeneral level!\u201d Shou Ping\u2019s eyes widened, his expression disbelieving. \u201cHeavens, he\u2019s so young!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStarting from today, you will all obey his orders.\u201d Ceng Lian\u2019er\u2019s voice passed into Shou Ping\u2019s ears through the rising steam of the tea.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis \u2026 \u2026\u201d Shou Ping hesitated. They were Ceng Yi\u2019s personal guard yet Miss was telling them to listen to the orders of another person. Shou Ping naturally could not help but feel resistant.</p><br/><p>Ceng Lian\u2019er continued to drink tea and her eyes didn\u2019t even look up as though the person who spoke wasn\u2019t her.</p><br/><p>Shou Ping gathered his courage and voiced the puzzlement he felt. \u201cMiss, this subordinate does not understand what Miss wants? This person is of unknown origins and his future vicious and hard to predict \u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are disobeying?\u201d Ceng Lian\u2019er put down her teacup, her serene voice carrying a ice cold tone.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis subordinate does not dare!\u201d Shou Ping\u2019s broke out in a cold sweat. He knew Miss\u2019 temper very well. If he hesitated at all, Miss would execute him without a second word.</p><br/><p>\u201cGo,\u201d Ceng Lian\u2019er said lightly as though nothing had happened.</p><br/><p>In the span of time that this word was said, Shou Ping\u2019s back had been soaked. He couldn\u2019t help but sigh inside, Miss had more presence than the Jie Master did at this age.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t dare to inquire further and retreated.</p><br/><p>But when he almost reached Guard Camp, he suddenly recalled. What did Miss mean by \u201cgo?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shou Ping grimaced.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>\u201cThis one is Tao Xing, many thanks, Little Brother, for your aid,\u201d Tao Xing said politely to Zuo Mo. Just now, the power that Zuo Mo had shown shocked him. He was curious who Zuo Mo was. Such a strong youth could not be unknown.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need for thanks, this is just business.\u201d Zuo Mo waved his hand with an unconcerned expression.</p><br/><p>Tang Fei\u2019s face turned black. It would have been fine if Zuo Mo didn\u2019t mention it. Now that he did, she recalled this person\u2019s past actions. It made her furious, the other had blackmailed them! Robbed them using threats! In her eyes, a person who acted so at such a crucial time had terrible conduct.</p><br/><p>While she was angry, she suppressed it.</p><br/><p>Even now, that astounding attack was still lingering in her mind.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat should I call Little Brother? Where are you from?\u201d Tao Xing smiled and asked. He was able to accept this. Even though the price caused him some pain, but it was worth it to save his life. Also, now the other would go to Endless City with them so their safety during this journey now had a very good guarantee.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust call me A Zuo.\u201d Zuo Mo was an old-timer and understood what the other was probing for. He acted as though he did not hear Tao Xing\u2019s second question.</p><br/><p>Tao Xing did not care and said with a smile, \u201cA Zuo is so young and has reached general level, your future is limitless!\u201d</p><br/><p>On the side, Tang Fei\u2019s expression changed. General level! This person with terrible virtues was actually general level! She then had an expression of realization. No wonder this person was so powerful.</p><br/><p>Tang Fei\u2019s strength was pretty good but she was still brigadier level. Among the mo, brigadier mo were usually silver battle generals, and gold battle generals had to be general level and above.</p><br/><p>Was this person a gold battle general? Tang Fei shook her head inside. She felt her thought was too absurd. Such a young gold battle general. That would only appear in the most prestigious of mo noble families.</p><br/><p>This person in front of her was unrivalled in greed. What mannerisms of a prestigious upbringing did he have?</p><br/><p>\u201cHow long until we reach Dark Abyss Jie?\u201d Zuo Mo asked Tao Xing.</p><br/><p>Tao Xing thought and said, \u201cAbout a month or so.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEn, let\u2019s keep hurrying along.\u201d Zuo Mo clearly did not have any interest in talking and ended the conversation.</p><br/><p>Tao Xing was slightly shocked. No matter where he went, he was respected and taken care off. It was the first time that he had encountered someone like Zuo Mo that didn\u2019t even have an interest in talking.</p><br/><p>A person without manners!</p><br/><p>Tang Fei added another criticism of Zuo Mo to her list.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo did notice that there were many eyes observing the battle from the shadows. However, due to the intimidation of Zuo Mo\u2019s terrifying attack, those hidden scouts felt fear so they only followed from a distance. They feared that if they approached, the other would crush them to bits.</p><br/><p>Immersed in his investigations, Zuo Mo did not detect that the name of Guard Camp was had gained infamy.</p><br/><p>This battle had caused some ruckus when news that they had killed four hundred Green Yaksha with one blow. Facing the King Yaksha and still being able to destroy the enemy with one blow, the strength of the battalion was evident. Intelligence on the leader of Guard Camp was quickly gathered by this group.</p><br/><p>All kinds of mirages appeared.</p><br/><p>Guard Camp\u2019s history was very mysterious. No one knew their origins, nor did they know what faction they belonged to.</p><br/><p>But what attracted the attention of most people was Zuo Mo. So young, and in general level, this attracted everyone\u2019s attention. Many people speculated on Zuo Mo\u2019s background but there were no results.</p><br/><p>But Zuo Mo did not know that his business deal had also tempted many of the powers hiding in the shadows.</p><br/><p>This really was a great big piece of business!</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>Zuo Mo did not pay attention to Tao Xing\u2019s group. He urgently wanted to test out the ideas in his head. He wanted to go into seclusion.</p><br/><p>However, that clearly was not realistic. He could only think as he travelled. He quickly managed to come up with some techniques.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe is a good mo battle general.\u201d Wei had been paying attention to Zuo Mo\u2019s experiments. In this period of time, Zuo Mo had asked him numerous times for advice, especially in the area of battle generals. Zuo Mo was not skilled in yao fighting methods but he would rapidly understand the mo battle methods and come up with new ideas that caused Wei to frequently sigh in amazement.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph!\u201d Pu Yao\u2019s expression was displeased. Everyday, he was in the Ten Finger Prison, and tormented the yao battalions. The pitiful Nan Yue, Cang Ze, and others, traveled during the day, and spent all of their remaining time in the Ten Finger Prison. It was extremely hard for them.</p><br/><p>However, Nan Yue and the others gritted their teeth and managed to endure. This journey had caused them to understand that there was nothing more important than strength in troubled times.</p><br/><p>What depressed Pu Yao was that there was nothing happening in his search of yao while Wei\u2019s blood summons had gotten responses.</p><br/><p>Damn it!</p><br/><p>At this time, Pu Yao abruptly stopped. He suddenly stood up, a light flashing through his bloody pupil as he disappeared.</p><br/><p>A yao had responded to the summons!</p><br/><p>Translator Ramblings: Since Zuo Mo is technically \u201cyuanying,\u201d it is true that his lifespan has expanded. I can\u2019t remember the exact number but he definitely gets 200 years of life. Zuo Mo needs to make long term investments \u2026 \u2026 otherwise, he\u2019s not going to have any retirement funds.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

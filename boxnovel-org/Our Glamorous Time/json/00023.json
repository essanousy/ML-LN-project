As usual, he arrived at the office before 7:00 am.</p><br/><p>At 7:00 am sharp, he sat on the couch, looked down at his watch, and then looked out at the cubicles outside the door.</p><br/><p>Under the bright lighting, Lin Qian\u2019s desk seemed clean and tidy; a tiny green succulent sat in the corner.</p><br/><p>She hadn\u2019t arrived yet.</p><br/><p>Li Zhicheng slowly stood up, headed to the bookshelf, then took out an industry magazine, turning to a certain page. He walked back to the couch, leaving the magazine open on the coffee table.</p><br/><p>He was waiting.</p><br/><p>When it became 8:00 am, Lin Qian, who usually arrived around the same time as him, still wasn\u2019t there yet. Again, Li Zhicheng looked up at her desk, then he looked down and kept on reading.</p><br/><p>Until the working bell started ringing at 9:00 am, among a group of footsteps, he spotted the noise he was most familiar with heading to the cubicles. This was followed by more familiar noises of her actions, from taking off her jacket to sitting down and turning on the computer. Suddenly, the phone on her desk began ringing.</p><br/><p>In a sweet and soft voice, she answered, \u201cHello, this is the President\u2019s office.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Zhicheng, who sat on the couch, looked up. Through the half-closed door he could see the side of her clear, pale face and her bright red lips.</p><br/><p>He kept reading, but his eyebrows lifted softly.</p><br/><p>Her voice and appearance suggested that she must have felt a lot better.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Hanging up the phone, Lin Qian stared at the reports awaiting Li Zhicheng\u2019s signature. She became quiet for a few seconds.</p><br/><p>She had actually gotten up pretty early this morning, but she had deliberately arrived late because she was just not feeling up to coming to work. The idea of getting along with each other alone for a couple of hours like they usually did felt a little odd.</p><br/><p>Clearly, he was a wolf\u2014perhaps even the most fierce and ruthless one she had met\u2014why had she treated him like a sheep?</p><br/><p>She sighed quietly. Why do I just want to storm in and give him a good scolding to his face?</p><br/><p>Of course she wouldn\u2019t really scold him. She even managed to put on her professional smile when picking up the documents, then quietly knocked on his door. But she couldn\u2019t laugh with him as she had before\u2014not anymore. A cheesy smile was all she could do.</p><br/><p>Huh. Who did he think she was? Although his plan was justified, he shouldn\u2019t have set her up too. Was she just an ordinary, simple individual to him?</p><br/><p>Just when she was getting upset thinking about it, an opposite idea slipped into her head.</p><br/><p>He had never deliberately tried to hide his talent and ability away from her throughout the whole plan. Despite dealing with him every day, she hadn\u2019t noticed any clues at all. Were they even on the same level?</p><br/><p>Stop it, what am I doing?</p><br/><p>From now on, I need to be extra vigilant when facing this\u2026 unpredictable man.</p><br/><p>She pushed the door open and looked up at Li Zhicheng sitting on the couch.</p><br/><p>The warm sunshine appeared from behind the clouds, shining through the window, bringing a sweet orange light into the room. As usual, he was in his black trim suit and clean shirt. There was a hint of casualness in his silence as he sat with a nice posture with his hands resting on his knees. Hearing her footsteps, he looked up, his pitch-black eyes calm and peaceful.</p><br/><p>Lin Qian\u2019s heart skipped a beat the moment they made eye contact. Silly! She thought to herself. Take a look at him! The expression in his eyes, his posture\u2014he\u2019s clearly evil-minded. Why had she thought him a quiet, humble cat? A freaking cat and a wolf were completely different things\u2014why hadn\u2019t she been able to tell?</p><br/><p>Although there were millions of thoughts going on in her head, her smile was getting more and more perfect. She passed over the documents, \u201cPresident Li, this is the report from the IT department. And this is\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Zhicheng took them. Their rapport was just as usual. She spoke simply, and he read carefully while commenting briefly. She wrote the things he said down in her notebook.</p><br/><p>During the process. Lin Qian unconsciously looked up. She noticed how concentrated he was. Below his dark brows, the rich black lashes and tall nose were beautiful and serious, like a painting.</p><br/><p>An idea that popped in her head made her realize that she had never really taken a serious look at him.</p><br/><p>Soon, the procedure was finished. Picking up the documents, Li Qian was ready to leave\u2014she even looked rushed. \u201cHold on.\u201d Li Zhicheng\u2019s voice was clear and unexpected.</p><br/><p>Lin Qian paused, turning around with a smile. \u201cPresident Li, do you need anything else?\u201d</p><br/><p>His head down and his eyes locked on the document, he patted the couch next to him. \u201cSit over here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Qian could feel her heart racing again.</p><br/><p>\u201cSit\u2026 over there?\u201d</p><br/><p>She started to imagine their hot, rugged kiss from the other day. The weirdly cool and clear feeling between his arms suddenly started to appear around her.</p><br/><p>He seemed to have noticed her hesitation, and slowly looked up at her with his clear eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cLast year\u2019s review for top ten bags was in this magazine.\u201d His fringes lighted tapped on the authoritative magazine from earlier. \u201cAn item from SMQ was also included in it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Qian realized he wanted her advice.</p><br/><p>She decided to play dumb.</p><br/><p>Calmly, she walked over to him, but still deliberately kept a distance from him when she sat. Overlooking his focused gaze on her face, she picked up the magazine and began to read with all her attention.</p><br/><p>She soon remembered that at some point in the past she had read this article. The authoritative magazine had come up with the top ten most popular bags in 2013 based on the reviews of their quality, appearance, value, sales, and reports from online users.</p><br/><p>She was pretty surprised at the article because the top three were all from New Bori. Following were some bags from SMQ and other companies. The bag from Vinda, promoted by Aida, was ranked 8th. It was just that last year\u2019s sales had done poorly.</p><br/><p>Would Vinda make it in the top three next year?</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, out of habit, Lin Qian picked up the report; based on her knowledge, she began explaining, \u201cPresident Li, it was a casual-styled bag from New Bori that ranked at number one. As far as I know, the bag had already been released for three years, and the rank was all due to the stylish look, decent quality and affordable price. Ranking second was a professional outdoor sports bag from New Bori. It was quite unusual for a domestic company to design some quality outdoor gear. New Bori sold a lot of them, but they were also slightly pricey\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>In the middle of speaking, it suddenly hit her. What was she doing? Still taking him as that fearless and adventurous boss who needed advice? Considering how he had been able to easily manipulate SMQ, how come he had zero knowledge of this basic information?</p><br/><p>What did he even need her for?</p><br/><p>Glancing up, Lin Qian kept muttering to herself. She could see those long legs of his slightly crossed as he sat comfortably against the couch next to her, one of his arms resting on the arm rest behind her and the other one on the knee. She could still feel his gaze without looking up. It was like air, everywhere, shrouding her.</p><br/><p>Immediately her face turned red.</p><br/><p>This guy\u2026</p><br/><p>It quickly flashed in her head that he was a man with clear goals.</p><br/><p>Her face was getting redder and redder just by thinking about it. Putting down the magazine quickly, she wanted to dash out of there. \u201cPresident Li, that is all I know.\u201d</p><br/><p>After a brief silence, in his low voice right next to her he said, \u201cYou look red.\u201d</p><br/><p>She remained quiet for a little while, then looked up at him. \u201cYeah, maybe the flu is still lingering. I\u2019ll sit further away so I don\u2019t pass it on.\u201d She was ready to leave immediately so as to avoid his unpredictable arms.</p><br/><p>Surprisingly, her shoulder started to feel heavy the moment she moved. His hand was on it, pressing her down.</p><br/><p>Lin Qian\u2019s pulse pounded\u2014this time she really was held under his arm.</p><br/><p>The two gazed at each other. His handsome face was very close to hers, and the same hand still gripped her should tightly, making her unable to move around. Her small panicky image was reflected in his dark but distant eyes.</p><br/><p>They didn\u2019t talk. The heated air in the room steamed almost as much as his fingertips, leaving her face feeling burned. He just stared at her; she was surrounded by the couch and his figure, tall and slender.</p><br/><p>Lin Qian\u2019s heart pounded harder and harder. A voice emerged in her head, Why is he acting like this? Who courts this way? Quiet but intense. Why are you sure I\u2019ll surrender?</p><br/><p>The other voice in her head was cold and smirking. Lin Qian, are you sure he\u2019s into you? It\u2019s only the tip of the iceberg he\u2019s shown you. You don\u2019t even know what he\u2019s up to. Aren\u2019t you afraid of the consequences?</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Lin Qian calmed down, looking at him sitting next to her. \u201cPresident Li, I think this incident was Aida\u2019s darkest hour before the dawn.\u201d</p><br/><p>Glancing at her, his eyes seemed to get heavier.</p><br/><p>With her loud pulse, Lin Qian felt this was slightly unfair; there was panic in her but strange courage as well. She continued, \u201cAlthough we\u2019ve lost Ming Sheng, on the plus side, the outlook for SMG\u2019s mid-range bag marketing is bright. God helps those who help themselves\u2014it appears we\u2019re still blessed.\u201d</p><br/><p>She felt calm telling Li Zhicheng this, and then she looked straight into his eyes.</p><br/><p>He stared back without any change in emotion. The staring lasted for a while.</p><br/><p>All of a sudden, Lin Qian started to feel like she was being absurd. He must have understood what she had said since he was so smart. Even though he might\u2019ve figured out the hidden meaning, it didn\u2019t mean she\u2019d have to clarify anything. But today, for some reason, with her shoulder held down, she felt she had to.</p><br/><p>With all the emotions she felt between her struggles, regrets, and impulses, the last thing she expected was Li Zhicheng to continue staring at her without revealing any emotion.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you upset?\u201d he quietly asked.</p><br/><p>Lin Qian remained silent.</p><br/><p>He considered her deeply for a moment, then quickly let go of her shoulder as well as shifted backwards, creating some distance between them for now.</p><br/><p>Lin Qian was instantly relieved. But there was a touching sensation that seemed to linger in the shoulder he had just grabbed. She glared at him, unsure what to say.</p><br/><p>Calm, he opened a book on the left corner of the desk. Lin Qian realized it was Master Sun\u2019s The Art of War.</p><br/><p>She was shocked.</p><br/><p>He took out a piece of white paper from the book. He turned and then placed it in front of her. Lin Qian glanced at him\u2014wasn\u2019t this the piece of paper he had recorded his tactics on? The same powerful handwriting, just like before, that included, Pay someone back in his own coin, and Killing with a borrowed knife\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never meant to hide anything from you,\u201d he slowly said. \u201cIt was the situation.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Qian didn\u2019t respond.</p><br/><p>What was he doing? Offering her some explanation?</p><br/><p>As such a complicated person, why was he being this honest?</p><br/><p>Hmm\u2026</p><br/><p>As she was still silent, Li Zhicheng remained quiet for a little while. Looking straight at Master Sun\u2019s The Art of War, he opened it quickly and steadily, taking out a folded note and turning to her.</p><br/><p>\u201cI wrote three copies. This is the second one.\u201d Keeping the note in between his slender fingers, gazing at her with his clear eyes, he asked, \u201cWanna look?\u201d</p>\n</div>"}

He could only infer from the\nsubtle moves in Aida that they were going to introduce a brand of new\nproducts, and they might be outdoor products. He couldn't find\ninformation that was any more specific. </p><br/><p> In the last battle\nagainst Vinda, Li Zhicheng and the company had worked together as an\nirresistible force and pinpointed all the spies New Bori put in Aida.\nAll of them were either held financially accountable or fired. Although\nnone of them had confessed who had sent them, Aida worked as an\nabsolutely cohesive team now. </p><br/><p> He had to admit: Li Zhicheng was a very strong compet.i.tor. </p><br/><p> Monday morning, Ning Weikai went to the headquarters of Zhu's for a meeting like usual. </p><br/><p>\nThe weather was fantastic that day. Ning Weikai's entrance in the\nheadquarters was a grand spectacle like it always was. Although he only\nbrought his secretary, Yuan Jun, to keep a low profile, everyone\ngraciously welcomed him. He was the Chairman's son-in-law and New Bori,\nthe business he ran, was the most profitable company under Zhu's. </p><br/><p> The meeting started at 9:00 am. </p><br/><p>\nThe head chairman, Ning Weikai's father-in-law Zhu Boyun, was no longer\nresponsible for the daily operations of the corporation, and wouldn't\nshow up to such meetings. </p><br/><p> Instead, Zhu Boyun's oldest son, Zhu Hanchong, ran the meeting. He was also a chairman of Zhu's. </p><br/><p>\nHe was a refined and cultivated man wearing gold-framed gla.s.ses. He\nalways spoke gently and smoothly. Everyone said that Mr. Zhu was a good\nleader, only lacking a bit of boldness. </p><br/><p> After the operations\nmanagement department reported last month's sales record of each\nsubsidiary and business department, he smiled to everyone in the meeting\nand said, \"This is a good start to the year, and everyone has put in\ntheir best effort. The chairman must be exhilarated by these numbers,\nespecially the bags sales.\" He looked at Ning Weikai beside him. \"New\nBori surpa.s.sed the target number again and took first place. Weikai,\nthanks for your hard work.\" </p><br/><p> Everyone looked to Ning Weikai with a polite and respectful smile. </p><br/><p> Ning Weikai internally sighed with a bit of contempt. I made them jealous again. </p><br/><p>\nHowever, the smile on his face was very sincere. \"New Bori gained its\nsteady development thanks to the help of the chairman and everyone\npresent. We will strive to do our best in the coming new year and try to\ngive a satisfactory performance to the board.\" </p><br/><p> Everyone just kept nodding. Zhu Hanchong smiled in silence. </p><br/><p>\nIn the meantime, the second Zhu brother, Zhu Hancheng, who was in\ncharge of a real estate business, said apathetically, \"I hear that\nAida's booming these days. I also hear they're preparing a new product\nto rival the market our corporation is dominating right now. Weikai, is\nthis true?\" He just turned twenty-six and was five years younger than\nhis brother. He was a handsome but ferocious-looking man who always\ntalked in an impa.s.sive way. He had been successful in expanding the\nreal estate business, so when compared to the bookish Zhu Hanchong, the\nsubordinates awed him more. </p><br/><p> Ning Weikai was a bit surprised that he knew about this. </p><br/><p>\nUmm\u2026 They've been keeping a really close eye on us. Well, I've made New\nBori so perfect that the Zhu's are anxious when there are any\ncompet.i.tors. </p><br/><p> Zhu Hancheng looked to the people in the\nmarketing department and said, \"How could you skip something so\nimportant during the report? Do you know how many Vinda bags were sold\nin the past several months? Are they posting a threat to us? Why aren't\nyou functioning as a marketing department of the headquarters?\" </p><br/><p>\nThe manager of the marketing department felt wronged. The operations of\nNew Bori were always independent; especially after Ning Weikai had come\ninto power, the headquarters didn't have a say in how the company was\nrun. They indeed weren't aware of the situation Zhu Hancheng had just\ndescribed. </p><br/><p> However, why were they the collateral damage of the conflict between the superiors? </p><br/><p>\nThe manager didn't provide an explanation; instead, he answered\nvaguely, \"Sure Mr. Zhu. We'll pay attention to it in the future.\" </p><br/><p>\n\"Okay.\" Zhu Hanchong started to smooth things over. \"Weikai knows a lot\nabout the bag industry and he knows what he should do. Hancheng, you\ndon't need to worry about it too much.\" </p><br/><p> The corners of Zhu\nHancheng's lips curved and he looked to Ning Weikai. \"Then, Weikai, what\nhappened? Are you prepared for this premeditated attack?\" </p><br/><p> Ning\nWeikai didn't like Zhu Hancheng, who always called him \"Weikai,\" in the\nslightest. He was two years older than Zhu Hancheng, but because he'd\nmarried his younger sister, he didn't show any respect for the older. </p><br/><p> \"I haven't made any plans yet,\" he answered with a smile. </p><br/><p> Everyone was astounded by what he said\u2014Zhu Hanchong was also dazed. Zhu Hancheng, however, was as cool as a cuc.u.mber. </p><br/><p>\nThe meeting room remained quiet and some old members from the board\nlooked at each other at dismay. Yuan Jun, who was sitting in the back\nand didn't get a chance to say anything, however, thought his boss was\nawesome. </p><br/><p> Ning Weikai looked around calmly, put one of his hands\non the desk, and the other started tapping it continuously, bewildering\npeople. </p><br/><p> After a long while, he started to speak without\nexpression. \"I'll first introduce everyone to the history of the market.\nIn the past three years, trend followers such as SMQ, Aida, and Shunkai\nchallenged New Bori with either new products or marketing strategies\nover a dozen times. And we've witnessed a vast number of innovative\nproducts of high quality and brilliant marketing ideas. With all of\nthese, if we had let them develop without obstacles, the market\nstructure could have been changed completely and New Bori's leading\nposition could have been lost.\" </p><br/><p> Everyone listened to him quietly and Zhu Hancheng maintained a straight face. </p><br/><p>\nNing Weikai smiled and went on saying, \"However, the fate of all these\nproducts were the same: they were replaced by products of greater\nquality and higher popularity that New Bori designed.\" </p><br/><p> He\nlooked around. \"Hancheng, and all members of the board, and all the\nmanagers: there's no need to worry about New Bori. Since we are the\nleader in the market, compet.i.tion will never cease. But fortunately,\nour overall strength and compet.i.tiveness are much better than they\nthink. </p><br/><p> \"We're much more advanced in independent research,\ndesign and foreign technology than any other company. Maybe they have\nsome new ideas. But unfortunately for them, whatever high-quality\nproducts they can make, New Bori can also do it and do a better job. In\nthis market, the best talents are all in New Bori and hence all the best\nproducts will only come from New Bori. </p><br/><p> \"I've got to say it's\ntragic for our compet.i.tors. Because all the new market s.p.a.ce they\nthink they've occupied will eventually come back to us.\" </p><br/><p> Lin\nQian sat in the hotel restaurant in Taipei, which was on a small\nplatform filled with sunshine. It was early and hardly anyone was\naround; she picked up the contract Li Zhicheng signed with Mingde Fabric\nFactory and started to read carefully. </p><br/><p> Li Zhicheng sat right across from her, eating quietly. </p><br/><p>\nTo be honest, the conditions in the contract were sensible, but beyond\nexpectations. People said the old man in Mingde was a bit aloof. He held\nseveral fabric patents and was reluctant to sell them. Lin Qian had\nknown that there was mystery involved in the deal that allowed Li\nZhicheng to convince him. </p><br/><p> And this was an expensive \"mystery.\" </p><br/><p>\nAccording to the contract, Mingde would provide the two existing fabric\ntechnologies exclusively to Aida over the next three years. Also, Aida\nwould have priority over other corporations in utilizing new fabric\nunder the same price. If there were a breach of contract, three times\nthe order amount would be paid. </p><br/><p> Lin Qian was relieved after reading this condition. </p><br/><p> Fabric cost the most in producing bags, and they had come a long way to find this most cost-effective option. </p><br/><p>\nIf Aida introduced new products, New Bori would definitely launch\nproducts of the same kind as compet.i.tion. However, as long as Aida had\nexclusive rights over the raw material, it would be difficult for New\nBori to find fabric as cost-effective and high-quality as theirs. </p><br/><p>\nEverything came with a price. To get the exclusive rights to the\nfabric, the contract dictated that all activities, sales, and all\npromotion of Aito, such as television and media advertis.e.m.e.nt, must\ninclude MingDe, which meant Aida must treat Aito and MingDe equally when\nintroducing them to the market. </p><br/><p> The cost and work required for\nAida to satisfy this condition was immense. Take television\nadvertis.e.m.e.nt for instance: even one second on CCTV, which might\ncost millions of yuan, would be split between Aito and Mingde. </p><br/><p> Lin Qian closed the contract and looked up at Li Zhicheng. </p><br/><p> He was bolder, more resolute, and more capable of understanding human nature than she'd thought. </p><br/><p>\nUsually, negotiations between raw material factories and manufacturing\nfactories only concerned monetary terms. He, however, had been able to\nbring up a win-win agreement to build the reputation of the other party.\nThe old man in Mingde was innately zealous. It was a small factory and\nheld an incredible patent. The fact that it hadn't been bought out yet\nmeant he wanted the brand to remain independent. How could he reject\nsuch an offer? </p><br/><p> Everyone had their ambitions. One was just comparatively more ambitious than others if he was \"zealous.\" </p><br/><p>\nThe sunshine mottled Li Zhicheng's shirt and his short black hair. Lin\nQian stared at his left cheek\u2014there seemed to be a small red mark on it.\nShe rejoiced at seeing that. </p><br/><p> That was her kiss. Early in the\nmorning, Li Zhicheng had met her downstairs for breakfast and they had\nkissed at the gate. And today, knowing she was going to Mingde, she had\nput on some makeup. Her lipstick was on his face. </p><br/><p> \"Clean it again.\" She gave a tissue to him. </p><br/><p> Li Zhicheng understood what she meant. She took the tissue and wipe his face while gazing at her. </p><br/><p> \"What are you looking at?\" Lin Qian asked. \"How could I meet someone without putting on makeup today?\" </p><br/><p> Li Zhicheng didn't say anything. After a while, he put down the tissue. </p><br/><p> Lin Qian stirred her coffee with her head down. \"There's still some on your left collar, and some on your neck.\" </p><br/><p> Lin Qian smirked. \"Okay.\" </p><br/><p> Lin Qian was a bit embarra.s.sed. What do you mean by 'Okay?' Why are you pretending to be weak again? Annoying! </p><br/><p>\nAfter he finished cleaning himself up, Lin Qian asked, \"Although a\nthree-times penalty is stated in the contract, can you say for sure that\nthis Mr. w.a.n.g won't betray us?\" </p><br/><p> Li Zhicheng said succinctly, \"He never will.\" </p><br/><p>\nAlthough she had no idea why he was so confident, the fact that he said\nso meant he was one-hundred-percent sure. Lin Qian could also rest\na.s.sured now. </p><br/><p> Mingde was located in the suburbs and surrounded\nby blooming trees and gra.s.s. Beside it were several ecological,\nagricultural companies. </p><br/><p> Li Zhicheng was welcomed in by the\nsecretary and conferred with Mr. w.a.n.g alone. Lin Qian and Jiang Yuan\nsat outside in the reception room, looking at the trees and factory\noutside, waiting quietly. </p><br/><p> Lin Qian estimated the a.s.sets of\nthis factory to be tens of millions of yuan, excluding the value of the\npatent. It was indeed mutually beneficial to cooperate with Aida. </p><br/><p> After more than an hour, the meeting room door opened. Li Zhicheng walked out with a skinny man in his fifties. </p><br/><p> Lin Qian and Jiang Yuan immediately stood up with a smile, observing this person in silence. </p><br/><p>\nHe wore a navy-blue Mao suit and had a pair of gla.s.ses on, looking\nlike a refined and knowledgeable college professor. Nevertheless, he\nlooked nonchalant and pretentious, with a touch of mystical light\nshining in his eyes. He glanced at them and his gaze fell on Lin Qian. </p><br/><p> Lin Qian shook his hand and beamed. \"Nice to meet you, Mr. Li. I'm Lin Qian from Aida.\" </p><br/><p>\nMr. w.a.n.g glanced at Li Zhicheng before shaking her hand, and said\nslowly, \"Ms. Lin came from afar. I'm not showing adequate courtesy.\" </p><br/><p>\nLin Qian was a bit surprised hearing him talk so politely\u2014he was\nwell-known for his harshness. It seemed she benefited from her\nrelationship with Li Zhicheng. </p><br/><p> Suddenly, Mr. w.a.n.g said to Li Zhicheng, \"Does Mr. Li prefer his career or his lover?\" </p><br/><p> Lin Qian was rendered speechless. </p><br/><p> Ummm\u2026 How does he know? </p><br/><p>\nJiang Yuan, who stood to the side a bit, was surprised as well. He\nlooked unruffled, however, pretending like he didn't hear it. Li\nZhicheng peeked at her calmly and held her hand. </p><br/><p> \"Mr. w.a.n.g\nis a senior man in the industry. We should be humble and learn more from\nhim.\" He spoke to her in a husky voice and made sure that everyone\naround could hear. </p><br/><p> \"Sure, sure.\" Lin Qian blushed. </p><br/><p> So he was playing the humble junior card? </p><br/><p>\nLin Qian understood interpersonal relationships very well. The deepest\nbusiness relationships were definitely not formed just hitting it off\nout of mutual interests. Instead, private friendships enabled better\nbusiness relationships. </p><br/><p> That was happening right now. Li\nZhicheng, after the official business, talked to the pompous\nprofessor/factory director along with his girlfriend there. This showed\nboth his frankness and trust\u2014this also worked well on the imperious old\nman. In his eyes, Li Zhicheng was not just a businessman vying for more\nmoney, but also a vigorous young man who cared for his girlfriend. </p><br/><p> Lin Qian walked with Li Zhicheng. She stared at his serene face. </p><br/><p> Though this man is reserved, he's quite insightful. He knows quite a lot about human nature. </p><br/><p> What relieved her was that he'd already made a promise that he wouldn't use the same trick on her. </p><br/><p>\nThe corners of Lin Qian's mouth curved up, but she pouted when others\nwere not paying attention. \"Why did you tell the others? Especially Mr.\nw.a.n.g?\" </p><br/><p> Right now, everyone was following Mr. w.a.n.g to tour\nthe park. Standing on the two sides were factories and trees. Li\nZhicheng pressed his hands against her palms and answered, \"We'll have\nlots of contact with him\u2014this ident.i.ty is more convenient.\" </p><br/><p> Lin Qian was jubilant, but she thought, This ident.i.ty? </p><br/><p> Blah\u2014I'm your girlfriend, and you're talking like I'm the mistress. </p><br/><p>\nShe smirked again when she heard him say, \"He can attest to it: I\ndidn't tell him anything.\" He glanced at her and smiled. \"He's quite\nperceptive and you\u2026 You're not able to hide it.\" </p><br/><p> Lin Qian, in a daze, glared at him. </p><br/><p>\nThe thing she hated the most was this kind of inscrutable behavior from\nhim and Lin Mocheng. They thought they were the only ones capable of\nhandling life. As for her, she was too naive to them. </p><br/><p> What triggered her the most was the way they had talked to her: \"Don't do anything. I'll handle it myself.\" </p><br/><p> Lin Qian muttered, \"I'm not that naive. I was very tactful before meeting you!\" </p><br/><p> Li Zhicheng chuckled and turned his head to her. She thought he looked emotionally ignited and like he wanted to kiss her. </p><br/><p> But it was a public place after all. He just gazed at her quietly and said in a deep voice, \"Then use that on me.\" </p><br/><p> In the afternoon, they flew back to Lin City. </p><br/><p>\nLi Zhicheng was quite frugal in outings, booking economy-cla.s.s\ntickets all the time. Nevertheless, Jiang Yuan gave the two seats that\nwere together to them while he sat at the corner two rows away. He could\nhear his boss's instructions without disturbing their private time,\nwhich was a perfect arrangement. </p><br/><p> The seats in the cabin were a\nbit small. Lin Qian leaned on Li Zhicheng and rested her hands in his\nlap. She looked at the clouds outside and felt sweet inside. </p><br/><p> Huh\u2026 </p><br/><p> She recalled what he had said in Mingde, telling her to use her tactful nature on him. </p><br/><p> However, she was thankful that this man wouldn't scheme against her. Comparisons were odious, and his shrewdness scared her. </p><br/><p> Will my ploys actually work on him? Isn't it going to be like nothing to me? </p><br/><p> The more she thought about it, the more she realized he was the same person as her brother. </p><br/><p>\nShe felt kind of down when thinking about her brother. Lin Mocheng\nhadn't replied to her since the day she had sent that smug message. She\nhad been so devoted to romance the past two days that she'd overlooked\nhim. Is he really mad? </p><br/><p> \"Have you talked to your brother at all?\" the man sitting next to her asked. </p><br/><p> This was the last thing she wanted to talk about. </p><br/><p> \"I'll call him when we land,\" Lin Qian answered honestly. </p><br/><p>\n\"Okay,\" Li Zhicheng looked at her as if he were thinking about\nsomething. He took out a yellow folder from the laptop bag under him and\nput it on her tablet. </p><br/><p> \"What's this?\" Lin Qian asked. </p><br/><p> \"This is the additional pact I made with him. It's time to let you know.\" </p><br/>\n</div>"}

The warm yellow sunlight penetrated the gaps in the curtains and contrasted with the dimly lit room. It was like a gold belt that reached into the room, colorful and quiet.</p><br/><p>Li Zhicheng hadn\u2019t yet woken up.</p><br/><p>Hmm hmm hmm..</p><br/><p>After the intimacy of the previous night, it was like a gorgeous and ridiculous dream to think back on it.</p><br/><p>After their almost perfect first time, Li Zhicheng had taken a break, holding her. The two talked intimately for a time.</p><br/><p>Then he went again \u2026 having thought of that, Lin Qian couldn\u2019t help but be shy, because at the end of it, she wasn\u2019t like herself anymore.</p><br/><p>He was still him. Calm, strong, and of few words, but his countless ways of caresses made her totally gave herself in to him again and again.</p><br/><p>Lin Qian looked at the man\u2019s sleeping, peaceful face laying close to her.</p><br/><p>With the shimmering light in the room, his face looked particularly clean and gentle. The black eyebrows were defined as if they\u2019d been drawn vividly with an inkpen.</p><br/><p>However, this lovely and calm face was of course just an illusion.</p><br/><p>Lin Qian\u2019s heart was filled with sweetness, and at the same time she felt a bit shy.</p><br/><p>Hmm, fine. She was a lazy person. For her, in terms of sex, she would not attempt to be dominant, she was willing to follow his lead for the rest of her life.</p><br/><p>After wriggling in his arms for a moment, Lin Qian cautiously pulled her legs away and picked up his hand on her waist and moved it aside.</p><br/><p>Unexpectedly, just after the thigh had pulled out from between his legs, when her calf was stuck between his legs, he woke up.</p><br/><p>His black eyes slowly opened, firmly looking at her.</p><br/><p>Lin Qian, \u201cMorning\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The response was a sudden and tight grab of her waist. He pulled her back into his arms, pushed himself against every inch of her skin, and looked down at her, \u201cMorning.\u201d</p><br/><p>The sound of the man\u2019s low, dull voice, and the thoughtful look, only made Lin Qian slightly flustered, she urgently whispered, \u201cLet go of me! I need to use the bathroom!\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Zhicheng took a look at her before releasing her hand.</p><br/><p>Without looking back, she could still feel his gaze. Once she had entered the bathroom, Lin Qian deliberately locked the door. She walked into the shower and began to wash slowly.</p><br/><p>Truth be told, her entire body was sore, and it was very enjoyable to take a hot shower.</p><br/><p>Most women bathe slowly, and today her shower was as slow as a snail, carefully washing every part of her body. Just by looking at the hickies all over her skin, especially her waist and chest, she couldn\u2019t help but blush.</p><br/><p>His hands and mouth were both pretty rough.</p><br/><p>She was still in her own thought when she suddenly heard a noise from behind the shower curtain, at the door.</p><br/><p>Then a slender figure was seen through the curtain and slowly entered the bathroom.</p><br/><p>Lin Qian felt extremely embarrassed. Of course, it was his house. Absolutely pointless to lock the door, he must have the key.</p><br/><p>Lin Qian covered her body with the shower curtain and stuck only her head out, protesting at the sudden invading man, \u201cI\u2019m in the middle of a shower! Hey, why don\u2019t you show some respect for my privacy\u2026 Get out.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Zhicheng was in a black bathrobe, loosely tied around his waist. His short hair was a bit messy, but it made his eyes look more handsome and profound. Pretending he hadn\u2019t heard her, he walked towards her slowly, and said lightly, \u201cI also need a shower.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Qian, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He had already taken off his bathrobe and stepped into the bath.</p><br/><p>Despite the huge bathtub, with two people standing inside, it seemed particularly crowded. Especially when he first came in, he held a hand against the wall beside her, and with the other, hooked her into his arms. Then, under the turbulent flow of water, he looked down at her. The man\u2019s beautiful stature and dark eyes only called for Lin Qian\u2019s heart. She no longer wanted to escape, with her finger painting a wreath of water on his chest, \u201cSo\u2026what do you want\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>The two were standing silently under the stream, letting the hot jets of water rinse their bodies. Without any more talking, they quietly embraced and enjoyed the beauty of the moment.</p><br/><p>After a while, Lin Qian looked up at him with a smile, \u201cShould I scrub your back?\u201d</p><br/><p>She would never tell him that back when she would watch TV, when a woman scrubbed a man\u2019s back, it felt like a great relationship for an old couple, staying together for a very long time.</p><br/><p>Li Zhicheng looked at her and replied, \u201cOk.\u201d</p><br/><p>He turned away from her and reached his hands to scoop up some water, washing his face. No doubt that was a handsome act, with his slender muscular figure, handsome profile, and hair roughly positioned.</p><br/><p>Lin Qian couldn\u2019t help but say, \u201cYou should try to star in men\u2019s razor or body-wash ads.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Zhicheng turned his head and looked at her lightly.</p><br/><p>He gave her a slightly disdainful look. Fine, he was using his eyes to threaten her again.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust kidding\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The body of my man should never be shared with other women.</p><br/><p>She began to wash his back.</p><br/><p>Then Lin Qian found out that on his slender and tough waist also unexpectedly had some hickeys and hmm\u2026 scratches and redness. They were long, shallow and could only be seen with a close examination. She instantly began to feel guilty.</p><br/><p>Very well. Her desire didn\u2019t lose to his at all. No loss for her at all.</p><br/><p>After scrubbing him for a while, Lin Qian looked at his tall figure and his well-proportioned muscular back, she couldn\u2019t help but tiptoe and gently kissed his neck, \u201cIt\u2019s done.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Zhicheng turned to face her. His eyes were still dark, she couldn\u2019t see through them.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour turn,\u201d he said concisely.</p><br/><p>Lin Qian instantly felt it was very sweet and full of love to help and serve each other. In the bed, he ruled her, and off the bed, as a proper Boss, he had to scrub the back of a woman.</p><br/><p>Lin Qian turned cooperatively and put her hands against the wall. \u201cThank you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Qian had no idea that this scene, in the eyes of a man, was so real and lively.</p><br/><p>Li Zhicheng kept quiet, he took the bath towel from her hand, covered her back and began to scrub.</p><br/><p>The strength of his hands was even and long, and his movements were precise, making Lin Qian feel so comfortable that a noise almost escaped her lips. But in the end, she resisted.</p><br/><p>Having scrubbed for a while, he stopped. Lin Qian also felt it was about time, she asked, \u201cIs it done?\u201d</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t reply.</p><br/><p>Just when Lin Qian was about to turn back to him, she was held from behind.</p><br/><p>Steamy, they couldn\u2019t keep their hands off each other.</p><br/><p>By the time Li Zhicheng carried her in his arms and put her back to bed, it was more than an hour later.</p><br/><p>Lin Qian once again had a sore back. However, in contrast to her, even though he was the one being more physically active, he had ended up looking just fine. Sitting on the edge of the bed, with his arm around her, he looked down at her, with a faint smile in the dark eyes.</p><br/><p>That was the satisfied, happy smile from a man who had just been pleased. It was seen through by Lin Qian, even though she was just being tossed about. It was so rare to see him this happy, like a real young man in his twenties, she also felt sweet and tender at the same time.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you need to sleep for a little longer?\u201d he asked.</p><br/><p>Lin Qian looked at the clock on the bedside and it was past eleven. She shook her head, \u201cLet\u2019s get up, I want to get some food.\u201d</p><br/><p>They both got up and put on their clothes.</p><br/><p>Li Zhicheng took a shirt and put on a pair of black trousers. Lin Qian looked at him, and she became romantic and squeamish all over again, throwing her casual clothes aside and reached out to him, \u201cPass them over, I\u2019m wearing yours.\u201d</p><br/><p>To be honest, wearing a man\u2019s shirt at home was nothing creative but cheesy. But there was no doubt that it was really sexy.</p><br/><p>The afternoon sun was clear and bright. Lin Qian was wearing a white shirt of his, with the linen trousers that she wore at home. Swaying in the room, she felt feminine and sexy.</p><br/><p>The take-out they had ordered had not yet arrived. Lin Qian cut up the oranges and goldberries from yesterday\u2019s excursion, and carried a full plate into the living room.</p><br/><p>Li Zhicheng was sitting on the couch, watching news on the television. He was looking at the Lin City Economy Channel. Since the luggage industry had always been one of the pillars of the local economy in Lin City, this channel often put on a lot of industry news and cutting-edge international information. Lin Qian also watched this when she had free time.</p><br/><p>She put down the fruit plate and sat on the couch, leaning against his arms. While watching the news, she picked up the fruit from the small silver skewer and placed them into his mouth, piece by piece.</p><br/><p>Li Zhicheng laid a hand on the armrest of the couch, and the other hand was clutching her waist, letting her put the weight of her entire body on him. After having some fruit, he lowered his head and began to kiss her. They were both bearing the flavor of fruit in their mouth; sweet and fresh. Then the kisses increased in length. In the quiet afternoon, surrounded by silence, no one wanted to move nor go out, they just wanted to quietly spend time together.</p><br/><p>He buried his head inside the loose and large shirt she had borrowed, doing all he wanted. Lin Qian didn\u2019t think it was a good idea. If they kept kissing like this, then they were going to \u2026 do it again. So she pushed him away, hard and determined, \u201cStop! We\u2019ve spoken about it, and we\u2019ve already done it enough for today!\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Zhicheng smiled in his eyes. Just staring at the messy shirt on her body and her delicate private parts, he was quiet for a while, then whispered, \u201cYou like to be in my clothes?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Qian laughed a little, putting on a disinterested face, and looked at the TV. At the same time she began to twist his fingers, \u201cLike it or not, so what?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Zhicheng bowed his head, lightly kissing her forehead, \u201cFrom now on, at this house, you can keep dressing like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Qian ignored him.</p><br/><p>But the corner of her mouth couldn\u2019t help but be upturned.</p><br/><p>In the afternoon, the sunshine was particularly bright, and the weather was a little hot. Lin Qian had been in the house for a long time. She wanted to go out for some fresh air, but her legs and feet were sore, and she didn\u2019t want to walk. So she asked Li Zhicheng for some other fun activities.</p><br/><p>Li Zhicheng, in fact, had never spent time with a girl like this before. After considering her request, he asked, \u201cFancy growing some grapes?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Qian\u2019s eyes suddenly widened.</p><br/><p>In this world, is there really anything that can baffle Li Zhicheng?! Growing grapes? It was such a creative entertaining idea that he just came up with, what a great boyfriend.</p><br/><p>Li Zhicheng had bought several grape seedlings the previous month. It was because of his workload that he had been putting off transplanting them from where he\u2019d been raising them on his balcony. The two took the seedlings and went to the small garden in the front yard. Lin Qian didn\u2019t know what to do, so she followed his instructions.</p><br/><p>Li Zhicheng first took a small shovel and dug a long ditch in the mud. With his great strength, the digging was done nice and quick. Lin Qian looked stunned and asked, \u201cHave you been a sapper? So cool!\u201d Li Zhicheng smiled a little and stood up, brushing on her lips. \u201cYou\u2019re flattering me. I was merely breaking a butterfly on the wheel.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Qian instantly bursted into laughter.</p><br/><p>After the ditch was dug, the seedlings were carefully placed into it. For such meticulous work, Lin Qian did very good job, placing each seedling nice and straight. Li Zhicheng simply stood aside, leaving her to enjoy herself.</p><br/><p>Soon the soil was buried and the roots covered, and Lin Qian was next to the seedlings. She looked up at the tall wooden frame and blinked against the sunlight.</p><br/><p>She wondered if she and Li Zhicheng would still be this close when the grapes were fully grown and hanging there next year.</p><br/><p>They must be.</p><br/><p>Having been pleased with her thoughts of the future, she stood up. As soon as she turned around, she saw Li Zhicheng standing beside a few plants, with his hands in his trouser pockets. He looked at her intently.</p><br/><p>Lin Qian\u2019s heart started twitching, she stepped forward. But she couldn\u2019t hold him when there was still soil on her hands. She could only hold his neck loosely, and tip-toed, to give him a kiss.</p><br/><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d she whispered.</p><br/><p>Li Zhicheng did not reply.</p><br/><p>He only pulled her into his arms and turned her short light kiss into a long, passionate, and warm one under the trellis.</p><br/><p>After a few moments, he let go of her, picked up the garden hose from the ground, and handed it to her.</p><br/><p>Watering this kind of thing was Lin Qian\u2019s favorite. Watching the water slowly seep into the land, nourishing the root buds of the seedlings, made her feel a particular sense of accomplishment. She gladly took this task and began to pour slowly. Li Zhicheng simply sat down in a chair on the side, and watched her.</p><br/><p>Having poured for a while, Lin Qian looked for something else that could entertain her. Looking at him closely, she saw his long legs loosely crossed, his face calm, and in a causal posture.</p><br/><p>Lin Qian rolled her eyes, and while he wasn\u2019t paying attention, she secretly turned on the tap. Then she raised her hand, and began to shower him with water.</p><br/><p>Li Zhicheng was caught off guard, his shirt around the chest was covered with water, and his trousers were soaked too. When he looked up, he saw Lin Qian standing under the trellis, putting on a serious face, holding the hose, pretending to be surprised and apologetic, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, my hand slipped!\u201d</p><br/><p>In the early summer, the water covering his chest only felt refreshing. Li Zhicheng looked at her, and with his hands in his trouser pockets, he stood up.</p><br/><p>She had to admit when a man\u2019s clothes were half-wet, there was a special kind of handsomeness. But to see him stand up, Lin Qian was a bit intimidated. She moved two steps back, trying her best to keep acting arrogant, \u201cHey, I really just slipped, you can\u2019t take revenge!\u201d Seeing him take another step closer, she lifted the hose in a threatening manner \u201cIf you come any closer \u2026 I\u2019ll keep spraying you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Then Li Zhicheng really came closer.</p><br/><p>Lin Qian didn\u2019t even think about it, she took a few steps back and fiercely began spraying him again. Since Li Zhicheng was already wet, with more water spraying him, he no longer cared, even greeting her \u201cwater gun nozzle\u201d, he rushed straight over and reached out to hug her.</p><br/><p>Lin Qian couldn\u2019t help laughing. She screamed and turned to hide. But this time, she overestimated her speed, and underestimated Li Zhicheng\u2019s capability as he pressed her into his arms. Not only that, he also grabbed the hose from her hand. Then, while holding her, he poured the water column on her and wet her thoroughly from head to toe.</p><br/><p>\u201cAhh,\u201d Lin Qian pushed hard on him, but she couldn\u2019t break free. She was held even closer to him. All she could see in front of her was the clear and rushing water. She could only roughly see his face not too far from her, raising his thin lips, and laughing hard. Lin Qian also suddenly giggled, she stopped struggling, and reached out to his chest, \u201cHey cheeky! You are bullying me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Zhicheng looked at the wet shirt on her body. Her exquisite curves were sweeping, and without any hesitation, he dropped the water hose and turned his head down, approaching her with his wet lips.</p><br/><p>They kissed for a moment before he pulled his head back. But he didn\u2019t let go, instead he lifted her up with both hands and turned back into the house.</p><br/><p>Inside, after closing the door, Li Zhicheng still hadn\u2019t let her down. He kept walking deeper into the house. Lin Qian asked, \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Zhicheng, \u201cHaving a shower.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><br/><p>They could really use a shower. Otherwise, sooner or later they would catch a cold. but\u2026</p><br/><p>Li Zhicheng looked at her and flashed a vague smile.</p><br/><p>She pretended to act furious, reaching out to push him, \u201cLet me down, I want to go home.\u201d</p><br/><p>By this time, Li Zhicheng had taken her upstairs, freed one hand, pushed the door of the master bedroom open and closed it neatly.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is your home,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m working tomorrow morning and in the afternoon I\u2019ll help you move over.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Qian was stunned.</p><br/><p>Li Zhicheng held her and entered the bathroom again. Lin Qian reached out and grabbed the door frame, desperately resisting, \u201cHey, when did I agree to move in with you?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Zhicheng paused his steps, and looked at her in his arms, \u201cDo you think I will let you go back?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Qian didn\u2019t know how to react to this, shouting, \u201cYou\u2019re bossy! Bossy and cheeky!\u201d</p><br/><p>The next day was Sunday.</p><br/><p>When Lin Qian awoke, Li Zhicheng had already driven to work. Thinking of the tenderness in the morning, her face blushed, with a pounding heart.</p><br/><p>People are in high spirits when involved in happy events, and even though she was physically tired, she was feeling extra cheerful. She slowly made herself some breakfast. Having thought that Li Zhicheng would come back at noon, she decided to visit a supermarket to get purchase ingredients and cook with him when he returned.</p><br/><p>Supermarkets were more crowded than usual on the weekends, and occasionally she could see a group of people, not knowing what they were buying. Lin Qian\u2019s thoughts were all on Li Zhicheng. Thinking that it would be their first day living together, she couldn\u2019t help but feel sweet and somehow funny.</p><br/><p>Hmm\u2026 he had it all planned.</p><br/><p>Considering they were both so busy working, if they didn\u2019t live together, they wouldn\u2019t have much time to spend with each other. What could they do? Certainly, they had to live together sooner or later. Otherwise, she couldn\u2019t stand anxiously waiting for him all the time.</p><br/><p>But it has only been a little while since we determined our relationship, and he\u2019s already taking the upper hand. No, I have to let him wait for a few days. It\u2019s hard for me to switch the dominance, and keep him waiting, it feels very nice. Hahaha.</p><br/><p>After getting some food, she returned to his house. It had just passed 11 o\u2019clock, and Li Zhicheng was still not home yet. To pass the time, she turned the television on, watching while preparing the dishes.</p><br/><p>Having thought of his family background, although down to earth, after staying so long in the military, she wondered if he typically cooked for himself or ate at the military canteen. But seeing the fridge was very empty, and based on his personality, perhaps he really never cooked. From now on, she would take great care of his appetite\u2026</p><br/><p>While she was thinking, she heard a familiar word was coming out of the television, \u201cNew Bori.\u201d</p><br/><p>Putting down the ingredients, she looked up at the TV.</p><br/><p>It was still on the same Lin City Economy Channel they watched yesterday. At the moment, it was showing live business news.</p><br/><p>Lin Qian froze.</p><br/><p>The television displayed a live news conference. Many renowned figures in the industry were sitting at the front of the room. Lin Qian recognized them, as they were all the important leaders from New Bori and Zhu\u2019s Consortium.</p><br/><p>In the middle was Ning Weikai, in a tailored black suit, looking up at the camera with a smile, very handsome, \u201cThis product, is the strategic focus for New Bori this year\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The voice from an unseen male host was deep and clear, very gentle. But for Lin Qian, it was like the sound of a thunder, every word was loud and explosive in her ears.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis morning at 11 o\u2019clock, New Bori is officially launching their urban sports utility bag brand, Sha Ying.</p><br/><p>The concept of the urban sports utility bag was first created by Aida a few months ago, and its subsidiary brand, Aito had achieved an amazing market performance. The competition in the suitcase and bag industry had always been tough. With New Bori, the leader in the industry, entering this new space, it was not hard to imagine that Aito\u2019s situation of outshining the rest, would obviously be altered from now on\u2026</p><br/><p>According to the conference, Sha Ying hadn\u2019t been released to the market yet, but New Bori had already invested hundreds of millions of dollars in this venture. An inside source stated that the famous technology fabric company from Taiwan, Mind, despite previously having a close business partnership with Aida, was very likely to become Sha Ying\u2019s Strategic Partner Supplier\u2026\u201d</p>\n</div>"}

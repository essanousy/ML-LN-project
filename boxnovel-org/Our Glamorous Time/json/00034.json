Since they had already made their way down, they decided to take a look on the way. Just as they got off the escalator, Lin Qian glanced toward the drink stall sitting by the main entrance on their left. Their lunch had been rushed so her throat and mouth were starting to feel a little dry.</p><br/><p>Then she looked to the right and saw the sign for the bathrooms. Then she told Li Zhicheng, \u201cI\u2019m going to run to the bathroom.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Zhicheng nodded. \u201cWhat do you feel like drinking? I\u2019ll buy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Qian was confused. \u201cHuh?\u201d</p><br/><p>He glanced at the drink stall to indicate what he meant.</p><br/><p>\u201cLemon kumquat.\u201d The corners of her mouth lifted into a smile. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>She thought to herself, That was like telepathy, wasn\u2019t it?</p><br/><p>The two temporarily went their separate ways at the foot of the escalator.</p><br/><p>After walking several steps, Lin Qian suddenly realized how strange that had actually been. He had asked her what she felt like drinking instead of whether she wanted something to drink.</p><br/><p>How did he know that she was thirsty?</p><br/><p>So, was he always\u2026 noticing her body language and expressions?</p><br/><p>She stopped in her tracks and looked back to see Li Zhicheng standing in line behind dozens of people amidst the bustling activity all around. She guessed he had never bought something like this before, as he focused intently on the large sign above the stall.</p><br/><p>Once again, when you stand on the bridge admiring the view, the person who is admiring the view is actually gazing at you.</p><br/><p>Lin Qian continued to stare quietly before turning around and heading into the bathroom.</p><br/><p>Facing the clear, bright mirror, Lin Qian removed her hat and washed her face. Lifting her head again, she looked at her damp and thoughtful expression. Her feelings were confused and complicated.</p><br/><p>No wonder he had told her that the \u201cbig battle is nearing\u201d back in America. Was this the \u201cbig battle?\u201d</p><br/><p>This could create a huge upheaval of the entire market.</p><br/><p>After a moment of silence, she reattached the strap of the hat and dolled herself up a little in the mirror. Only when she felt that she looked spirited and pretty did she walk out of the bathroom.</p><br/><p>The hallway leading to the bathroom was as straight as a pencil. Lin Qian thought about what Li Zhicheng had said earlier and walked with her head lowered. Behind her, a man followed, his footsteps going thud, thud, thud. He wasn\u2019t too near but he wasn\u2019t very far either\u2014she did not notice him. At the end of the hallway it once again opened into the mall, returning her to the loud and crowded shopping area.</p><br/><p>When she reached the exit, she lifted her head and noticed two men dressed in suits standing by the side as if they were waiting for somebody.</p><br/><p>Lin Qian found them rather familiar as she appeared to have seen them previously in the competitor\u2019s store. Was it New Bori, Cheng Pin, or SMQ\u2026?</p><br/><p>She naturally spared them a few more glances. Eventually, she heard an emotionless voice from behind her. \u201cWhat are you looking at?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Qian was extremely familiar with this voice. A sudden wave of anger erupted within her but she immediately suppressed it.</p><br/><p>She turned around and smiled at him with a very magnanimous and appropriate attitude. \u201cPresident Chen, what a coincidence. I can bump into you even while going to the bathroom.\u201d</p><br/><p>While it was a logical comment, the moment it left her mouth it seemed as though she was making a dig at him. Lin Qian internally scolded herself.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Chen Zheng stared at the woman before him and felt a mixture of feelings. Disdain, injustice, desire, melancholy at his inability to get close to her despite desiring to, and a slightly-hurt ego from what she had said. These feelings had been festering within this man and finally they culminated in a wave of violent anger.</p><br/><p>He hadn\u2019t thought he still had any interest in this woman, but Chen Zheng came from an entrepreneurial, farming family background, and was the same as his father. He was set on revenge and wanted an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth. When faced with someone that made him unhappy, he would definitely make her unhappy as well\u2014whether it was scaring her or making a dig at her. Since they had bumped into each other today, she had better not think it would be easy to escape.</p><br/><p>Chen Zheng gave his two subordinates a look, indicating for them to keep their position. Then, he turned to Lin Qian as if he was smiling\u2014he wasn\u2019t. \u201cDoes your face still hurt? Let President Chen have a look.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Qian turned to walk away without saying a word.</p><br/><p>After she had walked two steps he caught up again, this time looming even closer than before. Right in front were several displays of internationally-renowned leather products. The store\u2019s lights were bright and customers were continuously streaming in. Lin Qian tried to hurriedly retreat and almost collided with a customer who just exited the stall. Chen Zheng, who was beside her, pulled her over to a display surrounded by fewer people. \u201cWhat are you going off for? What can I do to you? Give you another slap?\u201d</p><br/><p>Finally, Lin Qian could no longer hold it in. She tilted her head and snarled, \u201cChen Zheng you bastard! Are you even still a man!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Cheng Zheng\u2019s expression started to shift and he stared at her without a word.</p><br/><p>Although he looked fierce, Lin Qian was not in the least bit afraid and she coldly glared at him. She thought about Li Zhicheng, who was getting the drinks, and wholeheartedly wanted to leave as soon as possible. But Chen Zheng\u2019s face was not amicable and his tall body blocked her path. The two of them stood next to the display and glared at each other, neither wanting to relent.</p><br/><p>A dense sound of footsteps came from behind Lin Qian, as if a whole group of people was grandly walking over.</p><br/><p>Lin Qian had yet to turn around but Chen Zheng, who was opposite her, had already lifted his head and his eyes flashed.</p><br/><p>Then, Lin Qian heard a man\u2019s voice that was strangely familiar. \u201cIsn\u2019t this SMQ\u2019s President Chen? Such a coincidence\u2014are you here to check up on the stores as well?\u201d Then, as if he was talking to others, he chuckled, \u201cI said this earlier: today\u2019s a great day. Look, not only has my flagship store broken its sales record, I even got to bump into my good friend.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Qian\u2019s back went rigid.</p><br/><p>That\u2026</p><br/><p>It was the first day of their huge sales as well as the first weekend after the New Year, so it was natural for the bosses of the big corporations to make their rounds. Moreover, making rounds and checking up on stores were about the most important things in the business. However, it seemed a suspicious coincidence for her to bump into both of them\u2014something just didn\u2019t add up.</p><br/><p>The low voice that hinted at a lazy smile; the thick skin to warmly and outrightly call a competitor a \u201cbest friend.\u201d Who else could it be other than Ning Weikai?</p><br/><p>Today was different from days past. Lin Qian had no need to acknowledge him so she simply remained quiet and slightly lifted her head to get a sense of what was going on. She could see Ning Weikai in his suit and shoes, not a single strand of his short hair out of place, and his face as white as jade. Behind him stood a large crowd: men and women, young adults and middle-aged folks, and a secretary beside him holding his jacket. He looked at her and Chen Zheng with amusement, calm and controlled with an extremely ostentatious presence.</p><br/><p>Chen Zheng had regained his usual demeanor, and his two subordinates had hurried over to stand beside him. He smiled and took a step forward, extending a hand toward Ning Weikai. \u201cPresident Ning, long time no see. The last time we met was at the industry\u2019s annual meeting in September. Why, it\u2019s such a nice weekend and you\u2019re not out spending time with your wife? Instead you\u2019re going solo, like a bachelor such as myself, making your rounds of the stores.\u201d</p><br/><p>The people beside him laughed as if they were placating him. Lin Qian actually found it a little funny as well. Everyone in the industry knew that Ning Weikai had married the daughter of the president of Zhu\u2019s\u2014this was how he had propelled into his position at New Bori. With Ms. Zhu\u2019s two older brothers at the same level, they each got hold of the Zhushi consortium\u2019s property, the financial service industry, and the bag business respectively. Chen Zheng\u2019s words may have seemed a light-hearted joke, but people who were more sensitive could tell that there was a hidden meaning.</p><br/><p>And by Lin Qian\u2019s standards, Ning Weikai was a very sensitive man.</p><br/><p>Watching from the outside, it was definitely funny. But if Lin Qian did not leave now, when would she?</p><br/><p>Just as she was about to take off, she heard the voice laced with lazy laughter ask, \u201cAnd who is this?\u201d His tone still held a little uncertainty.</p><br/><p>Lin Qian did not have to turn and look to know that many gazes had fallen upon her.</p><br/><p>Even though Lin Qian was a small fry, ever since Li Zhicheng\u2019s very successful battle, Aida\u2019s group of talents had once again established a name for themselves in the market. In this market where competition was tough, everyone believed in the mantra that \u201conly by knowing yourself and your enemy well will there be a guaranteed win every battle.\u201d It would not be unbelievable if several people there recognized her.</p><br/><p>It was too late to try and get out of the situation.</p><br/><p>She maintained a perfect smile and slowly turned around, looking at everyone with bright, shining eyes.</p><br/><p>She heard Chen Zheng laugh, \u201cThis is Miss Lin Qian from Aida Group\u2014President Li Zhicheng\u2019s precious and beloved subordinate.\u201d He glanced at her again. \u201cShe used to be part of SMQ\u2019s staff and is also my friend.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Qian cursed bastard at him in her heart again. Then, she looked up at Ning Weikai with a smile. \u201cHi President Ning, I\u2019m Lin Qian.\u201d As for a handshake\u2014there was no need for that!</p><br/><p>Ning Weikai put on a slightly shocked expression. \u201cPresident Li\u2019s most precious and beloved subordinate is so young!\u201d He smiled at her. \u201cManager Lin, it\u2019s my pleasure to meet you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Someone beside him immediately chirped, \u201cStill so pretty.\u201d</p><br/><p>She could not tell if that line was genuine or not. But at that moment, Lin Qian was a woman standing in a crowd of mostly men. Such a comment, when analyzed in detail was often not a compliment, but rather a flippant remark.</p><br/><p>Lin Qian smiled without a word. Ning Weikai also had a smile on his face and looked at the person who had said that. It was a basic store holder who did not often have the chance to see the president. Even though the president was smiling at him, why did it feel very cold? He obviously did not approve of people cracking such jokes. The store owner immediately lowered his head, reducing his presence in the room and trying to blend into the crowd.</p><br/><p>The little detail that most did not notice Lin Qian had immediately picked up on. She understood Ning Weikai\u2019s character well. Even though he wasn\u2019t loyal when it came to relationships, he was extremely respectful and courteous to women of all ages, appearances and social status.</p><br/><p>That was why Lin Qian had agreed to be with him all those years ago. She\u2019d been blinded by the gentle and refined side of him.</p><br/><p>Even so, Lin Qian still lifted her gaze and shot him a grateful look. Meanwhile, his gaze was as still as water and his demeanor was completely unchanged, making her unsure if he even noticed it.</p><br/><p>Chen Zheng briefly exchanged some greetings with Ning Weikai, and without many other words he said his goodbyes. As he left, he didn\u2019t even glance at Lin Qian.</p><br/><p>Lin Qian took the chance to say her goodbyes as well but before her mouth could open, Ning Weikai looked at her with a smile. \u201cManager Lin, I\u2019m very interested in the brand Vinda that your company has recently launched. I\u2019ve heard that Vinda\u2019s products have been selling very well and has broken the market\u2019s record.\u201d He turned his head again and told the others. \u201cConsidering that Aida created such a successful brand in such a stale market, they should really be a model for others.\u201d</p><br/><p>Most people took turns to agree, but anyone could say polite words. Lin Qian did not want to listen to any of this praise.</p><br/><p>People can be very strange. She obviously knew that the man in front of her was no longer the youth he once was. If he did not have those cruel tactics that were so similar to Li Zhicheng\u2019s, even if he was the son-in-law of the company, he definitely would not have been able to secure his position as the president of New Bori for so long. Neither would he have been able to lead his organization to such heights and allowed it to progress so quickly.</p><br/><p>But staring at his profile, which was nearly identical to how he looked years ago, and watching his cunning eyes, Lin Qian couldn\u2019t help but feel that deep down he was still the sly, gentle, kind person\u2026 with a hunger for power and fame, and an unpredictable nature.</p><br/><p>Lin Qian smiled. \u201cPresident Ning is too kind. Our President Li is also full of respect for President Ning. New Bori is this field\u2019s benchmark\u2014\u201d Just as she was about to finish her string of polite nonsense, she heard President Ning softly go \u201cOh!\u201d before getting excited and looking around. \u201cHas your President Li come today?\u201d</p><br/><p>From where they stood now they couldn\u2019t see the drink stall\u2014Lin Qian became very anxious. She reckoned that Li Zhicheng still had many people in front of him, and since the drinks had to be freshly made, perhaps he would still be a while. She simply gave him a vague smile and evaded his question, saying, \u201cPresident Ning, since you\u2019re busy, I\u2014\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss Lin,\u201d Ning Weikai cut her off once again; his smile was as refreshing as a spring breeze. He gestured to her. \u201cCome over here by my side.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Qian was stunned. The surrounding crowd silently observed.</p><br/><p>There were a few feet between them. Lin Qian had no idea what his ulterior motives were. This version of Ning Weikai gave her both the sense of familiarity and unfamiliarity at the same time.</p><br/><p>Under the scrutiny of the crowd, she walked over, closing their distance to 20 to 30 centimeters before standing still. Ning Weikai tilted his head to look at her. He extended his arm and pointing to the top level of the mall. He said, \u201cThat\u2019s New Bori\u2019s store with the highest sales. Has Miss Lin gone to have a look today?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Qian blinked and answered, \u201cOh, today I\u2019ve been blindly going all over the place. I have probably gone already.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Weikai smirked at her. Then using the back of his hand to support his head in a thinking position, he was seemingly deep in thought. \u201cI hope in the future, our two companies can work together more often to revitalize this industry. I also invite you and President Li to visit our stores more often and to give me some suggestions.\u201d</p><br/><p>These words were definitely too amiable, but the crowd all quickly agreed and seconded the idea. \u201cPresident Ning is extremely correct!\u201d\u201dExactly, one must have such an attitude when doing business!\u201d</p><br/><p>Amidst a sea of approval, Lin Qian had no choice but to continue smiling. However, regardless whether it was the unfamiliar Ning Weikai of the present or the familiar Ning Weikai of the past, these passionate and selfless sentiments were fake. Lin Qian became completely incapable of adding any more flattering words.</p><br/><p>Amidst the hubbub of voices from around and the background music, she could suddenly hear a man\u2019s low, amused voice come from above her head; so soft that only the two of them could hear, he said, \u201cYou\u2019ve grown taller. Last time you were only as tall as the second button of my shirt, and now you\u2019re nearing the first.\u201d</p><br/><p>This light and airy voice made Lin Qian go numb.</p><br/><p>What kinds of things was he saying?! Their relationship had seemed to come out of a play: they had broken up after only ten days together. How could he say such nostalgic things? What was it for?</p><br/><p>He was crazy!</p><br/><p>In a low voice again, she heard him say, \u201cHowever, your appearance has become a bit worse. You\u2019re all dressed up like a man, and you didn\u2019t even put on makeup. And what kind of lousy hat is this\u2014it looks terrible.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Qian could not stand it for a moment. She turned her body slightly and blocked the view of the people standing around. Then, she lifted her head, her face still etched in a smile and whispered vehemently, \u201cNing Weikai, would you die if your mouth was less cruel?!\u201d</p><br/><p>His thin lips gently pulled upwards into a smile that was as cold as a snowfall.</p><br/><p>\u201cZero dollars, long time no see.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Qian had been initially irritated by his words. But now, hearing this, she didn\u2019t know why, but she suddenly smiled too. She was about to retort, \u201cLame!\u201d Before she did, however, she realized that it would be a little odd.</p><br/><p>Turning her head, she saw Li Zhicheng. He had one hand in his pocket and the other one carried a plastic bag with their drinks. He was amongst the flow of people walking by about 30 feet away. He appeared to have just walked over from the drink stall and lifted his head to look in the direction of the bathroom. His gaze paused for a moment before he looked in her direction.</p><br/><p>Through the dark and packed crowd, and in the loud environment, he spotted her at a glance.</p>\n</div>"}

The sound of him sitting down again, typing on his keyboard. Rustling sounds\u2026 him flipping through some documents\u2026</p><br/><p>Everything sounded normal, very productive even. Not a trace of frustration nor sudden change in emotion, common symptoms in a lovesick person.</p><br/><p>Lin Qian breathed a sigh of relief.</p><br/><p>On second thought, she was definitely worrying for no reason! People like him must be good at controlling their emotions and feelings. Or perhaps, even though unrequited in love, romance for him in general was not a priority. One could figure this out from another specimen his species, Lin Mochen.</p><br/><p>But Lin Qian was a little restless; mouse in hand, she clicked aimlessly on the screen.</p><br/><p>When it comes to relationships, it\u2019s not like rejecting him or not loving him makes you the winner and you can rejoice without any worry. It always takes two to work at a relationship; it\u2019s also a double-edged sword.</p><br/><p>Right after she had finished the line, Lin Qian wanted to bite her tongue off. Why had her tone sounded guilty and foolish, like a student admitting her mistake to the teacher?</p><br/><p>Then, she had seen him sitting behind his office desk, expressionless as before, staring at her using his dark, deep eyes. He had kept staring at her. His gaze had made her feel uncomfortable.</p><br/><p>She had lowered her head, avoiding his gaze; she\u2019d come up with an excuse and left the room.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking about that you are so absorbed?\u201d a familiar voice rang.</p><br/><p>Lin Qian was surprised; she looked up. Gu Yanzhi and Xue Mingtao were standing in front of her. She didn\u2019t know how long they had been there.</p><br/><p>She immediately collected her thoughts, smiling. \u201cMr. Gu, Mr. Xue, is there anything I can help you with?\u201d</p><br/><p>Gu Yanzhi smiled without a word; he seemed refreshed. Also smiling, Xue Mingtao said, \u201cWhere\u2019s your coat? Aren\u2019t you coming?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Qian paused momentarily; only then did she notice that both of them were in coats, and Xue Mingtao had an office bag in his hand, ready to leave. Before she could respond, she heard steady footsteps walking over to them. Li Zhicheng\u2019s deep voice rang out. \u201cShe is going.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Qian froze for a moment, then she quickly stood up, tried to look normal, turned and said with a smile, \u201cMr. Li.\u201d</p><br/><p>She was surprised.</p><br/><p>Li Zhicheng had his coat on, still the same black coat that made him look tall and cool. Beneath his short hair, his dark eyes were indifferent; his gaze paused on her for a while, his deep voice ordering, \u201cGrab your coat. We\u2019re going out.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nothing peculiar, expressionless as before. He looked just the same as usual. In contrast with the dominance and enthusiasm shown in the office just now, he felt like a different person.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Lin Qian replied. She turned off her computer, put on her coat, and followed after the three of them to the elevator.</p><br/><p>The car cruised steadily on the ring road.</p><br/><p>Xue Mingtao was the driver; Lin Qian was in the passenger seat as usual.</p><br/><p>Today\u2019s sales were still rising; therefore, Xue Mingtao was chatting happily with the two bosses while driving. Gu Yanzhi was obviously in a good mood too; he even teased Li Zhicheng, saying that he should treat them.</p><br/><p>Lin Qian, sitting in front, could see Li Zhicheng out of the corner of her eyes. He sat straight up, unperturbed. When faced with Gu Yanzhi\u2019s teasing, he chipped in a few words as a response. Not sure if she was overthinking, Lin Qian felt like his voice was especially low today, and his cold and composed aura filled the car. Occasionally when he raised his head to look in front, Lin Qian could feel his clear and keen gaze silently land on her.</p><br/><p>An unsettling feeling washed over her, so she was quieter than usual.</p><br/><p>But her silence drew attention from the others.</p><br/><p>Xue Mingtao turned the car into a brand new industrial zone, glancing at Lin Qian at the same time. \u201cLin, why are you so quiet today? Still feverish?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Qian realized she hadn\u2019t said a word since she had gotten into the car. Today was the joyous day after their first triumph in battle, so her silence was indeed abnormal.</p><br/><p>As soon as Xue Mingtao finished speaking, she could feel the gaze of both men in the back seat settle on her. She instantly pulled out a bright smile. \u201cA little.\u201d</p><br/><p>She just wanted to get by the question with a vague answer, but it happened that the traffic light turned red, so the car stopped. Xue Mingtao turned to her, looking concerned. \u201cShow me your tongue?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Lin Qian said.</p><br/><p>Xue Mingtao was over forty; he thought highly of her after their first battle, so he treated her like a dear sister. Seeing her stunned, he chuckled, \u201cI used to practice traditional Chinese medicine. Let me examine your tongue and your throat.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Lin Qian turned towards him, opening her mouth and sticking out her tongue. \u201cAhh.\u201d</p><br/><p>When she darted her eyes from this angle she could see Li Zhicheng sitting straight up in his seat, both hands on his knees, revealing the white cuffs beneath his coat. He was staring at her; his gaze was similar to when he had confessed to her in the morning, bright and piercing.</p><br/><p>Lin Qian was taken aback by his stare. Her tongue was still out. Suddenly her face reddened. She quickly closed her mouth shut, tilted her head aside, avoiding his gaze.</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t let him see.</p><br/><p>Confused, Xue Mingtao gave her a look, \u201cWhy are you suddenly dodging\u2026 It looks fine, there should be no inflammation. It\u2019s just odd that your face is red. Do you have a fever?\u201d As he spoke, he put his palm over her forehead.</p><br/><p>And so Lin Qian could sense more intensely that Li Zhicheng\u2019s stare was fixed on her face once again, pausing at the spot touched by Xue Mingtao.</p><br/><p>Lin Qian continued to blush. Xue Mingtao was nagging her to drink more water and such, but she wasn\u2019t listening.</p><br/><p>Godd*mnit\u2026 what is this?</p><br/><p>She had already rejected him. But right now, why did the interaction between both of them give the\u2026 the illusion that she was already his? Her every move seemed to be locked under his gaze. And it was strange that she automatically filtered out other people, only caring about his actions.</p><br/><p>Could it be\u2026 Li Zhicheng\u2019s aura and presence were too dominant?</p><br/><p>The car stopped at a new industrial zone not far away from Aida Group.</p><br/><p>It was almost noon. The brand-new, large, grey office building area was bathed in sunlight. The compound was filled with green plants; the scenery tranquil and picturesque. Lin Qian was aware that this area had been built with the investment from the state government, and was for sale or for rent. Because it was still very new, only a few blocks had been built, the company\u2019s sign hanging on them. There was not a single person in the area.</p><br/><p>What are they doing here? Most of Aida\u2019s industrial zone was still left abandoned and unattended; a portion of it had been mortgaged to the bank.</p><br/><p>The three men were tall so they walked fast. Lin Qian was trotting behind them. As they were walking, Xue Mingtao introduced the area to the two bosses in a low voice; Li Zhicheng, leading in front, didn\u2019t look at her or speak to her.</p><br/><p>Finally, they entered a white three-story building. Contrasted with the classic nineties design of Aida\u2019s main office, the layout here was clean, elegant, and modern, using black and white as the base tone.</p><br/><p>Lin Qian looked around. Suddenly a thought popped into her head: this place had been designed and decorated based on Li Zhicheng\u2019s preference.</p><br/><p>She lifted her gaze to look at Li Zhicheng. Hands in his pants pockets, he was overlooking the surrounding area.</p><br/><p>Why does he want to buy or rent a new office? What is he trying to do?</p><br/><p>But they didn\u2019t explain, so she kept the question to herself. The four of them visited every room one by one; most of the time Gu Yanzhi was the only person nitpicking, commenting on the interior design. Li Zhicheng only pointed out one or two alterations to be made. Xue Mingtao readily promised that after this he would ask the workers to make changes accordingly.</p><br/><p>Once in a while, when Li Zhicheng turned around to walk out of a room, he would come face to face with her. She would avert her gaze, acting dumb by not staring at his eyes. His side profile was calm; his steps steady. He would walk past her like normal.</p><br/><p>Lin Qian slowly calmed down with his calm demeanor. Yup, that\u2019s right. Back to the status of boss and assistant. That\u2019s very good.</p><br/><p>She actually still very much preferred to work alongside him.</p><br/><p>The south wing on the third floor of the area was obviously reserved for the administrators. The space was segmented into small rooms; the interior design was more delicate too. When they reached one of the rooms that faced south, Lin Qian paid extra attention to it. This was because the room was decorated with warm colors. Even the office desk strayed from the regular black color of the desks in the other rooms; instead, it was a bright and clean beige color. The glass window on the side was carved into beautiful geometrical shapes. The whole room looked refreshing and stylish.</p><br/><p>When Gu Yanzhi entered this room, he smiled without saying a word. He didn\u2019t nitpick on anything either. Xue Mingtao looked around, nodding. \u201cI feel like this room is the best. In terms of the direction it\u2019s facing, design, and style.\u201d After he finished speaking he looked at Lin Qian with a smile.</p><br/><p>Lin Qian paused momentarily. Is he hinting for her to comment as well?</p><br/><p>Before she could speak, Li Zhicheng, initially standing alone quietly in front of the desk, turned around and looked at her too. His voice was distant and flat. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Qian stared straight into his dark eyes.</p><br/><p>Finally\u2026 he speaks to me again. She replied with a smile, \u201cI think it\u2019s quite good.\u201d</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t say anything else, turning to look at the other side.</p><br/><p>Lin Qian understood. Was it possible that this office was being prepared for an incoming female manager?</p><br/><p>Who would that person be? Enough for Li Zhicheng to take notice of the design, and even speaking to her to ask for her opinion.</p><br/><p>Lin Qian, with a stomach full of questions, followed behind them as they left the area.</p><br/><p>When they reached Aida, Xue Mingtao sent the two bosses upstairs. Then he asked Lin Qian to accompany him to look for the contractor to convey the changes discussed just now. Lin Qian gladly agreed. She didn\u2019t want to go back to the office to face Li Zhicheng. It would be better if they could give each other some time to cool off.</p><br/><p>While they were on their way, Lin Qian finally couldn\u2019t hold it in anymore and asked, \u201cMr. Xue, the new office that we saw today\u2014what\u2019s it going to be used for?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xue Mingtao looked at her, surprised. \u201cYou don\u2019t know yet? I figured Mr. Li had told you since he asked you to go check out the office as well.\u201d He smiled, lowering his voice. \u201cVery soon Mr. Li will separate the hot-selling Vinda out to form a new subsidiary company. The relationship between Vinda and Aida will become investor and debtor. As for the rest, you can witness it yourself.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Qian was dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>So, that was how it was.</p><br/><p>In the morning she had still been worried that Vinda would be dragged down by the mess of Aida Group. She\u2019d been worried about how Li Zhicheng would be able to control the company. However, looking at the new office today, it seemed like Li Zhicheng was not only focused on the marketing war with other companies, but he was preparing to rectify the situation in the company as well.</p><br/><p>Now that they had seized victory outside, he had started to take drastic measures to control the inside. Step by step, each step interconnected, carefully planned with every conceivable possibility taken into account.</p><br/><p>Exactly how shrewd is this man?</p><br/><p>When Lin Qian returned to the office again, it was already past 7:00 pm.</p><br/><p>She first went to the IT department to inquire about today\u2019s sales. After receiving a surprising result, her mood brightened. Even the trace of gloominess caused by her incident with Li Zhicheng had gone with the wind.</p><br/><p>But the aura of her boss was impeccable. When she stepped out of the elevator and set foot on the top floor, it only took her a glance at his half-closed office door from afar to get anxious again.</p><br/><p>They were both adults. There wasn\u2019t anything embarrassing about working together now, right?</p><br/><p>He would not stare at her again with that rattling gaze, right?</p><br/><p>When she moved closer, she saw someone in her seat. It was a familiar face, Yang Xiru, her subordinate from the CEO office.</p><br/><p>Lin Qian walked towards her, smiling. \u201cWhat\u2019s up? Looking for me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yang Xiru immediately stood up; the smile on her face was lovely and compliant. \u201cMiss Lin, I am here to familiarize myself first. If you have any orders, feel free to assign them to me first.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Qian was puzzled. \u201cWhat are you familiarizing yourself with?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yang Xiru was surprised too. She replied, \u201cCEO assistant\u2019s duties.\u201d</p><br/><p>She was a smart girl; seeing that Lin Qian\u2019s expression didn\u2019t look right, she immediately lowered her voice, answering truthfully, \u201cMiss Lin, I received a call from Mr. Li an hour ago saying that you\u2019ll be transferred to another department soon. He asked me to get ready to be the CEO\u2019s assistant.\u201d</p><br/><p>Before Lin Qian could speak, a familiar bass voice called from inside the room. \u201cLin Qian, come in.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yang Xiru made a face at her, but Lin Qian couldn\u2019t smile. She pushed the door open, walked in, and locked the door.</p><br/><p>When she raised her head and saw Li Zhicheng sitting on the sofa, calm and collected, a thought flashed through her mind.</p><br/><p>Because of the incident this morning he\u2019s transferring me away?</p><br/><p>Indeed, as superior and subordinate, this method was the best solution for them. Hadn\u2019t she thought of applying for a transfer in the morning as well?</p><br/><p>But her resigning was one matter. Him transferring her away was another.</p><br/><p>His feelings for her, as it turned out, could only last for a day. Once he\u2019d been rejected, he was going to immediately send her away?</p><br/><p>\u201cSit.\u201d He calmly looked at her, his demeanor cold and handsome as usual. But his gaze was not as sharp and deep as it had been in the morning; it was peaceful like it normally was.</p><br/><p>Lin Qian sat down quietly.</p><br/><p>Li Zhicheng pushed a document on the table towards her. Lin Qian glanced at the cover page: \u201cDismissal Agreement.\u201d</p><br/><p>This came way too suddenly. Lin Qian tried to settle her nerves. She couldn\u2019t believe it, but the paper was right in front of her.</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t even bother flipping through the dismissal agreement. Pride rushed through her. She stared at him across the table, glaring at him. \u201cIs it because of what happened this morning?\u201d</p><br/><p>Her tone was harsh. Li Zhicheng\u2019s eyes darkened, staring at her slightly reddened cheeks.</p><br/><p>After a moment, his pair of unfathomable eyes flickered with amusement. He looked down, reached out, and opened the dismissal agreement for her.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201d he asked lightly. \u201cDo you think I would let you go?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Qian\u2019s heart quivered. She couldn\u2019t care to figure out whether his words had a hidden meaning. Instead she bent her head to read the content of the dismissal agreement. It was written on the first page: \u201cDue to Lin Qian voluntarily offering to work at Vinda company, this agreement has been made between her and Aida Group, and the contract of employment shall be terminated\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Qian blinked. Vinda company? The new subsidiary company mentioned by Xue Mingtao? The new office visited by them today? So soon? Her anger vanished, replaced with confusion and curiosity.</p><br/><p>\u201cLook at the back.\u201d Li Zhicheng\u2019s words were succinct.</p><br/><p>Lin Qian flipped to the back; it turned out there was a copy of the new employment contract attached. She opened it and she was shocked again.</p><br/><p>\u201cLin Qian\u2026 Assistant CEO\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>CEO\u2019s assistant, Assistant CEO. The titles merely differed in sequence, but the ranking varied tremendously. Assistant CEO was genuinely a high-ranking position, usually managing a few departments.</p><br/><p>Lin Qian stared at this title, her heart beating fast. A phrase popped up in her head: a meteoric rise to fame.</p><br/><p>No wonder he had brought her along to see the office today. No wonder they had asked for her opinion of the office.</p><br/><p>That office\u2026 could it have possibly been prepared for her?</p><br/><p>She was speechless for a while.</p><br/><p>Apparently noticing the hesitation in her heart, Li Zhicheng said calmly, \u201cThis delegation has nothing to do with love. From now on, you take charge.\u201d</p><br/><p>His concise words, as usual, caused Lin Qian to feel a sudden gush of blood pulsing through her veins.</p><br/><p>Yes\u2014if it were for love he would keep her close, not let her go. He was not someone who would let a relationship impair his judgment and career.</p><br/><p>Since this was unrelated to love, then it was due to her ability and outstanding achievement. Lin Qian\u2019s ability was indeed strong; furthermore, she had contributed greatly in this battle.</p><br/><p>So, he really wanted to let her go out and take charge?</p><br/><p>Lin Qian stood up, holding the contract of employment; her expression was more serious than it had ever been. \u201cMr. Li, I will definitely do my best. I will not disappoint you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Zhicheng sat on the sofa, both hands on his knees, staring at her. \u201cI will never be disappointed in you.\u201d</p><br/><p>That night for Lin Qian was a sleepless night. Her thoughts roamed.</p><br/><p>As for Li Zhicheng, he spent the night sitting in the quiet office, setting up a Go game, and inviting someone over for a match.</p><br/><p>He\u2019d grown up with his grandfather and had long been trained to play Go. He was the one behind intentionally releasing the antique Go manual into the market for Chen Zheng. Other than to lure him in, he had also gained Mr. Kang as his Go-mate. The effort had been worth it.</p><br/><p>But looking at Aida, only Liu Tong, deputy CEO and veteran, was worthy of playing against him.</p><br/><p>Liu Tong gladly accepted his invitation. The two of them sat facing the lonely moon outside the window, playing Go in silence.</p><br/><p>After they ended a round, Liu Tong chuckled, \u201cZicheng, I\u2019ve had five matches with you so far, and I\u2019ve lost all five of them. However, today is rare because, for once, I see a chance of winning.\u201d He glanced at Li Zhicheng. \u201cToday you are a little impatient and distracted. Isn\u2019t the online flagship store a success?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Zhicheng paused for a moment, replying slowly, \u201cAn unrequited pursuit results in impatience and distraction. One should resist the temptation, toughen his nature, and slowly lay out the scheme.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Tong was stunned. He took a stone and set it down gently, saying flatly, \u201cNever regret decisions made.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>A month later.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Tomorrow was the Lunar New Year\u2019s eve. The office had a joyous atmosphere. Lin Qian, in a business suit and high heels, first went to inspect the customer service department. After ensuring that everything was normal and the sales were increasing steadily, she motivated the workers and then left feeling pleased.</p><br/><p>After that she went to the IT department. This was not a department she managed, but it was one of the core departments in the company who worked closely with her. After chatting and exchanging New Year\u2019s pleasantries with the IT department manager, she then turned around and returned to her office on the third floor.</p><br/><p>It was almost time to leave work. After tomorrow they would start their long holiday. The hallways were packed with workers hastily walking around; when they saw Lin Qian, they would smile and nod. \u201cManager Lin!\u201d\u201dHello, Manager Lin!\u201d\u201dManager Lin, happy new year!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Qian would nod in acknowledgment to each and every one of them.</p><br/><p>It feels good to be a leader. She was like a fish in water; the person who chose her for this position had chosen the right person for the right job.</p><br/><p>Outside the window, the tree branches had started budding; the chilly air was no longer as frigid and bitter as it was during winter. Lin Qian stared at the spring scenery and her heart sighed with emotion.</p><br/><p>Since the day she had received the employment contract, her work focus had shifted to preparing the new \u201cVinda\u201d subsidiary company. She had slowly gotten to know more insider\u2019s news as well. For example, before taking over Aida, Li Zhicheng had negotiated with his father that he would exchange the ten percent of Aida\u2019s share in his hand with the ownership of the brand \u201cVinda.\u201d At the time, since Vinda had been selling terribly overseas, all the shareholders had agreed without giving a second thought.</p>\n</div>"}

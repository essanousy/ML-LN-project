Mr.Zhu claimed previously that he wouldn\u2019t sell the shares of New Bori. Now, however, things changed in a short period.</p><br/><p>Without much effort, he figured out how it had happened. DG started to buy shares from moderate and minor shareholders, who were the relatives and friends of the Zhu\u2019s. They helped Mr. Zhu build the corporation so they owned part of New Bori. And now? They couldn\u2019t enter the executive suite of Zhu\u2019s corporation. It was difficult for them to resist DG Corporation\u2019s high-priced offers.</p><br/><p>tsktsk</p><br/><p>However, it was Zhu Hanchong and Zhu Hancheng who put New Bori into an equity crisis.</p><br/><p>Lin Mochen, one of DG Corporation\u2019s representatives, secretly met with the two. After a few days, he bought ten percent shares from them combined, which brought DG\u2019s ownership to thirty percent of New Bori and made DG one of the largest stakeholder in the company.</p><br/><p>As for Ning Weikai, the only thing he wanted to say to this was, \u201cF*ck!\u201d After all, New Bori was not the established or \u201craised\u201d by the Zhu brothers, and thus they did not feel sorry for giving this \u201cstep-child\u201d up. Ning Weikai could think of lots of reasons why they were willing to sell their shares. First, Ning Weikai himself had been in charge of New Bori for years and was influential. They didn\u2019t feel assured dealing with a corporation with a large group of people who they had concerns with the loyalty. Second, they had only dabbled in the real estate and finance industries before, while traditional and low-profit industries like the bag industry couldn\u2019t attract their interest. Selling part of their shares rewarded them with a huge sum which they could use the to support other areas of the business owned by them. Of course, it could further build their reputation within the Zhu\u2019s Corporation as well. After all, when Ning Weikai was taken care of, they became the only competitors for the chairman position. Lastly, it would be almost impossible for Ning Weikai to ever turn the tables after New Bori was sold. It was like salt in his wound.</p><br/><p>Ning Weikai had to admit that if he were in their shoes, he would also sell New Bori.</p><br/><p>Now, the situation was unclear. Mr. Zhu owned twenty percent, and the two brothers sold five percent each, not to mention that they were likely to sell their remaining twenty percent. Zhu Hanyu\u2019s fifteen would be sold while the other fifteen percent was distributed among other minor shareholders, who were loyal to Ning Weikai. Other than everything above, thirty-five percent was owned by DG. There was still a question mark about who would become the controlling shareholder of New Bori.</p><br/><p>As for Zhu Hanyu, Ning Weikai could completely understand why she wouldn\u2019t sell her shares. It was said that Lin Mochen had approached her but was rejected.</p><br/><p>She was na\u00efve and inexperienced, but she was also stubborn. She might not be able to realize how important her shares were, but she didn\u2019t want to sell what belonged to the Zhu\u2019s in the first place.</p><br/><p>Ning Weikai looked at the sky and buildings outside and sighed.</p><br/><p>As he was thinking about her, Yuan knocked on the door and walked in. He looked a bit odd and was hinting at him with his eyes, \u201cMr. Ning, Mrs. Ning is here.\u201d Ning Weikai was a stupefied. He saw Zhu Hanyu, who was wearing a sapphire-blue skirt and a white topper, walk in.</p><br/><p>They gazed at each other. Ning Weikai\u2019s face was fixed while Zhu Hanyu was expressive in her look. She held her purse tightly, gazing at him. \u201cYuan Jun, I need a minute,\u201d said Ning Weikai. And then, he stood up behind his desk and approached her with a smile, \u201cWhy\u2019re you here, Hanyu?\u201d</p><br/><p>This was the first time she set foot in his workplace after she married him.</p><br/><p>Zhu Hanyu somehow lowered her head to evade eye contact with him. \u201cYou haven\u2019t been home for three days. I\u2019m here to see whether you\u2019re OK.\u201d Ning Weikai looked at her alabaster neck, resembling a smooth jade of high quality. He had never seen another woman with such a smooth and delicate neck. Today, she was in the most ordinary clothing. However, every one of her moves showed what an elegant and refined woman she was. She was born a socialite, a princess. The princess who lived at the ivory tower like in the fairy tale. The princess once in his dream.</p><br/><p>Ning Weikai held her hands and walked back to the desk. Zhu Hanyu followed him stunningly without saying anything. Ning Weikai sat back down and dragged her to his lap. Zhu Hanyu felt a bit uncomfortable, \u201cThis is the office.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it,\u201d Ning Weikai gave a mild kiss to that delicate neck, \u201cthey won\u2019t come in. The acquisition is a huge deal and everyone\u2019s talking about it. I\u2019m busy with the issue so I don\u2019t have time to go home.\u201d</p><br/><p>This explanation sounded hollow to her ears. Before, no matter how busy he was, he would go home and be with her as long as he was in Lin City. Zhu Hanyu only nodded her head and handed him a folded paper, \u201cI, I come here to give you this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Weikai took it, and was dazed by what he saw, \u201cThis is\u2026\u201d It was an equity proxy, which stated that Zhu Hanyu entrusted Ning Weikai with all her fifteen percent of the shares of New Bori, and Ning Weikai would act on her behalf. At the bottom was her signature and seal, slim and frail as she was.</p><br/><p>Ning Weikai looked up at her and asked, \u201cDo you know what this means?\u201d It meant the decision of who could be the controlling shareholder of New Bori, either the Zhu\u2019s or DG, was up to him to decide.</p><br/><p>There was a trace of vague emotions sparkling in Zhu Hanyu\u2019s eyes. She answered, \u201cIt means\u2026 together with the shares you have of Sha Ying, you can at least make sure Sha Ying, and other brands are safe in your hands, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d Ning Weikai bowed down and kissed her, \u201cYes. Thank you, Hanyu.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Hanyu suddenly burst into tears and put down her fragile dignity. She held his neck and said sobbingly, \u201cWeikai, it doesn\u2019t mean that I side with my father and brothers. I just don\u2019t want you to fall out. I want everything to be exactly the same.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Weikai felt like his heart was rocked. He held her tightly and said, \u201cI understand\u2026\u201d Before he could finish, he heard someone knocking on the office door and opening it. \u201cMr.Ning, I\u2019m here to report my work!\u201d she said in a clear tone, and stood there gracefully.</p><br/><p>Both Ning Weikai and Zhu Hanyu turned around and looked to the door. It was a young and pretty girl, wearing a white shirt and an office skirt. She was standing holding the door open. Seeing them hugging each other, she blinked. Yuan Jun stood behind her with a straight face and started to scold her, \u201cLydia, Mr. and Mrs. Ning were talking. Go out immediately.\u201d Before she could react, the door was closed.</p><br/><p>Silence was restored in the room.</p><br/><p>Ning Weikai and Zhu Hanyu looked at each other. Just when he was about to kiss her again, she pushed him away, stood up and squeezed out a smile, \u201cDo you still have to work? I\u2019ll leave you alone then,\u201d she halted and looked up to him, \u201cAre you coming\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m coming back,\u201d Ning Weikai interrupted. He stroked her hair and murmured, \u201cWait for me.\u201d Zhu Hanyu nodded her head, gave him a brief look and left.</p><br/><p>Ning Weikai walked her out of the office and all the way to the ground floor. When they passed by the secretary\u2019s desk, he unintentionally peeked at the girl. She didn\u2019t look at the girl and nor did the girl look at her. She got into the private car and waved Ning Weikai goodbye. It wasn\u2019t until the car turned and he couldn\u2019t see her from the back that Zhu Hanyu began sobbing, with her body trembling.</p><br/><p>Ning Weikai receiving fifteen percent of New Bori\u2019s shares couldn\u2019t be kept a secret. Everyone in the industry quickly knew about it. Lots of people visited him, while others were waiting for his next move. As for him, he didn\u2019t meet with anyone, including Lin Mochen, who was renowned in the bag industry. He scheduled a meeting with Li Zhicheng a couple of days later.</p><br/><p>Both of them had an explicit intention for this meeting. For Ning Weikai, the only brand he had total control on was Sha Ying. Now that he was beset with troubles internally and externally, this could either save him or doom him. What he needed, was a strong back-up. Li Zhicheng knew Ning Weikai\u2019s situation perfectly, and meanwhile, he needed his help.</p><br/><p>On a bright afternoon, they met at the teahouse where they had met previously, without Lydia and Lin Qian. This time, it was Ning Weikai who filled Li Zhicheng\u2019s teacup. He asked him with a faint smile, \u201cI heard that DG made its intention clear that they\u2019ll acquire Aida. How\u2019s the process going?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Zhicheng gave a brief but clear answer, \u201cI\u2019ll respond to that in the coming few days.\u201d Ning Weikai nodded his head without further inquiry. He took up the porcelain teacup and swirled it in his palm. Suddenly, he laughed, \u201cIt was a bloody war. I always thought you were the biggest challenger of the industry, without realizing we would all become prey of those multi-national corporations.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot necessarily so,\u201d Li Zhicheng tapped the desk and remained unexpressive, \u201cwhat do you think will happen if all the Chinese corporations resisted buyout?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Weikai had contemplated the costs and benefits before. He answered with an obscure smile, \u201cIn the short term, it\u2019ll be pyrrhic victory. But in the long term, we will lose without doubt.\u201d Li Zhicheng didn\u2019t even raise his eyebrows. He took a sip of his tea and said, \u201cHave you read the report of Chinese appliance industry?\u201d</p><br/><p>Undoubtedly, Ning Weikai had read it. He smiled, \u201cWe\u2019re not like them. There\u2019ll be both advantages and disadvantages if we want to compete against the foreign companies.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m all ears.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough technologies are still required in bag manufacturing, unlike appliances, there aren\u2019t huge quality and technology differences between companies. That\u2019s why, unlike the appliances companies, we don\u2019t have to invest into that intensively and only earn a thin profit margin. And that\u2019s our advantage.\u201d He glanced at Li Zhicheng and continued, \u201cHowever, appliance customers focus more on cost-effectiveness and don\u2019t care as much about the brand name because appliances are about functionality. For bags, they\u2019re personal consumer goods. To put it plainly, choices of bags represent a person\u2019s taste and social status. DG Corporation is now using SMQ\u2019s marketing network to set foot in the Chinese market and once the customers get to know and accept this international brand, we won\u2019t be able to do anything about it, not even price competition and quality rise, because no one will shun the best international brand and go to local brand just because of a two-digit yuan price gap. Even if we want to wage a price war against others, we might not even be able to win it. We\u2019ll still remain second-tier brands behind DG.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although he said it frivolously and coldly like always, what he said showed his perspicacity. He put his hands on his knees and looked at Li Zhicheng after he finished talking.</p><br/><p>Li Zhicheng looked at the man in front of him of quietly. His eyes were so dark that he couldn\u2019t even see things clearly. After a short while, Li Zhicheng started to talk.</p><br/><p>He took the teacup and put it on the middle of the desk, \u201cThat\u2019s why if we want to beat DG and preserve our market share, the only way is to prevent customers from knowing this brand in the first place.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Weikai lifted his eyebrow.</p><br/><p>When talking to Li Zhicheng, Ning Weikai felt pleasure like he\u2019d never experienced before. These were the thoughts ingrained deeply in his mind. Now after inspecting this complicated industry and looking into the core issues of the situation, he came up with the boldest conclusion and most precise deciding point, and Li Zhicheng hit the mark with a single comment.</p><br/><p>Is this what is like to meet your rival?</p><br/><p>He grinned in his heart. \u201cWhat\u2019re your plans then?\u201d he said, cutting to the chase.</p><br/><p>Li Zhicheng was apparently well-prepared. He took the other two teacups and put them in front of him one by one, \u201cThere are two steps.\u201d He looked up at him solemnly and went on explaining, \u201cAt the first stage, you\u2019re the lead and I\u2019ll cooperate with you. We\u2019ll pressure them from the outside, and make sure that they\u2019ll have a hard battle when trying to enter the Chinese market.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ning Weikai immediately understood what he meant. \u201cOutside\u201d meant all the sales channels, suppliers, retailers, logistics operators and more. He was still the president of the Bag Industry Association and had a large network in the industry. It was ironic that he had thought about using the same trick on Aito in the past, but now Li Zhicheng was asking him to use it on foreign corporations.</p><br/><p>Li Zhicheng continued, seeing Ning Weikai remain silent, \u201cI\u2019ll give you all the resources Aida has.\u201d This was immense support. What Li Zhicheng meant was integrating all the resources of the two companies and entrusting them to Ning Weikai, so that the pressure and potential losses faced by the two companies were equal. Meanwhile, he could accumulate more connections and build a mightier reputation, thus preparing for his comeback. Ning Weikai weighed the pros and cons in his heart without giving an explicit response. Instead, he asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s the second step?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Zhicheng looked at him, leaned back in his chair, and answered, \u201cThe first step will disappoint DG, but it will be just a feint. I\u2019ll take charge at the second stage, to build a wall against foreign brands in customers\u2019 hearts.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was sunset when Li Zhicheng arrived back at Aida. Almost all the people in the building were gone while Jiang Yuan was still sitting in his compartment. He stood up seeing Li Zhicheng, \u201cMs.Lin is here.\u201d Li Zhicheng nodded his head and said, \u201cOK. You can head home.\u201d</p><br/><p>He saw Lin Qian reading Master Sun\u2019s \u201cThe Art of War\u201d beside the shelf under the dimming light. She turned around and twinkled at him. She took out the paper where his third scheme was pulled from the book. \u201cCan I keep this?\u201d she asked.</p><br/><p>Li Zhicheng had no problem with that. She folded the paper carefully and put it in her purse. She pretended to look at him tensely and said, \u201cI need to be extra careful because it\u2019ll be the end of the world if someone gets it. And of course, I\u2019ll never show this to my brother.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Zhicheng chuckled, walked to her and sat down holding her in his embrace. \u201cAre you going to Changsha next week?\u201d he asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that early next month?\u201d Lin Qian was a bit surprised. The original plan was Lin Qian heading to Mind\u2019s subsidiary in Changsha, taking charge of operations of Mind in mainland China and quitting Aida from now on.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe war\u2019s drawing near.\u201d Li Zhicheng held her in his arms and said gravely, \u201cStay there until it\u2019s finished.\u201d Lin Qian remained silent. Li Zhicheng couldn\u2019t make himself clearer, and she understood that it was appropriate for her not to participate in this acquisition like Lin Mochen. Though she made herself clear that she wanted to be his deputy, it was all talk. She had prepared to stand aside, except that she didn\u2019t realize she had to leave so soon.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell,\u201d he must have his concerns since he made this plan. Lin Qian flung her arms around his neck, \u201chow long do you need?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThree to five months.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Qian opened her eyes widely, \u201cThree to five months?\u201d Without seeing each other? Seeing her worried, smiles waved in his eyes. He put his hand on her head and kissed her. \u201cI\u2019ll come every week no matter what happens.\u201d</p><br/><p>After a few days, Lin Qian flew to Changsha.</p><br/><p>Lin Qian was more keen than reluctant for this relocation, although her eyes were wet when she said goodbye to Li Zhicheng at the airport. After a long time of cohabitation, it was fresh and relaxing for her to live alone again. She was also certain that he would keep his promise and visit her every week.</p><br/><p>Lin Qian called Li Mochen from the airport and told him that she was leaving. Lin Mochen was surprised, \u201cWasn\u2019t it next month?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou avoided the acquisition. Don\u2019t you think I should do the same thing?\u201d Lin Qian sighed. Lin Mochen said, \u201cThat might be a good thing. You\u2019re Li Zhicheng\u2019s only weakness. It\u2019s better for you to leave than stay.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Qian was dazed. What does he mean that I\u2019m Li Zhicheng\u2019s only weakness? I\u2019ve always been his Man Friday? When did I become his weakness? Does Li Zhicheng think the same thing?</p><br/><p>She felt uncomfortable as she stepped onto the plane. However, with the plane flying across the clouds and the sun blazing, she stopped thinking about it. She appreciated the majestic scene outside while taking the piece of paper out of her wallet. This had been was written by them together when she was discussing a strategy with Li Zhicheng at his home. The handwriting was a bit poor, but it didn\u2019t affect reading.</p><br/><p>The first step, to lure the enemy into a trap.</p><br/><p>Lin Qian read it a few times, then folded it and put it back in her purse. This was the first time that she knew all about his plans, and right now, she thought that there wouldn\u2019t be any problems ahead.</p><br/><p>We will win.</p>\n</div>"}

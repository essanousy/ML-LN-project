It was deeply attached to the ones in love, and straightforward.</p><br/><p>For a man like Li Zhicheng, it was like a lake that nobody knew about, quietly hidden underneath the surface, with the water being deep, and still. But his restraint would always come to an end. As the deep water flowed more powerfully, despite the surface of the lake appearing calm, the turmoil was hidden beneath it, and as soon as there was an opportunity, it would overflow uncontrollably.</p><br/><p>When it finally didn\u2019t have to restrain itself, the stream would be as turbulent as he was and could engulf her instantly.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Li Zhicheng pressed her onto the couch and kissing her repeatedly. The light and the sun were intertwined and the lovers were painted with bright colors. The room was extremely quiet. Only their breath lingered; clearly audible. Jiang Yuan\u2019s phone was ringing constantly behind the door, and his voice was intermittent, \u201cOk\u2026 I\u2019ll pass it on to President Li\u2026he is busy in a meeting at the moment\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Qian\u2019s heartbeat began beating faster with each kiss.</p><br/><p>During his working hours, in his office, kissing her with his most fervent desire \u2026 the thought was making the kisses more passionate and intense.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell\u2026\u201d she murmured. \u201cStill in your office\u2026 You want to be a self-indulgent leader?\u201d</p><br/><p>Her words were jumbled. Li Zhicheng stared at her with his open eyes, heavily sucking on her tongue, leaving her entire body feeling numb. He then got up, holding her.</p><br/><p>Lin Qian\u2019s cheeks were getting red, and her shirt was also wrinkled from the pressure, she quickly looked down and tidied up, then stared up at him.</p><br/><p>He also looked down at her, and in his dark eyes, there was still turbulence, with an impression like a wolf.</p><br/><p>Lin Qian responded with a rush in her heart, as she reached for his tie. She then demanded, \u201cDidn\u2019t you miss me at all?!\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment it came out, she started to feel her desire to be spoiled was too obvious, but still acted like a peacock who had been left out, and glared at him arrogantly.</p><br/><p>But in her heart, there was a sweet sense of helplessness. Holy god\u2026I am so useless\u2026 It took her over two months, having done so much work all over the country, she had finally trained herself into a tough woman.</p><br/><p>But when she returned to his arms, it only took two minutes to change herself back to that sentimental little woman\u2026</p><br/><p>Damn!</p><br/><p>Li Zhicheng watched the woman in his arms, with the bright lighting sparkling in her eyes, her long and light lashes, as well as her pink and soft cheeks, her tender and slender hands, and the soft delicate body of hers, suggesting she had completely surrendered in his arms.</p><br/><p>Without responding to her question, nor any explanation, with a strong arm, he picked up her whole body and put her on his lap.</p><br/><p>For the first time, Lin Qian was sitting in this position on top of him, in the office where people were coming and going. Her heart was even more alarmed, she whispered, \u201cLet me down! If anybody comes in\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Zhicheng completely ignored her.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re being so bad\u2026\u201d she protested in his cocoon with a mosquito-like voice.</p><br/><p>Li Zhicheng\u2019s face was covered in a pale redness, but his eyes were sinking deeper.</p><br/><p>\u201cAm I?\u201d he asked lightly.</p><br/><p>Lin Qian replied, \u201cYou are\u2026you tease me\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The two kissed passionately, occasionally engaging in meaningless chatter here and there. Li Zhicheng put her body onto him, \u201cteasing\u201d her all he wanted. Unknowingly, an hour passed and the bell from work rang. Li Zhicheng finally raised his head from her chest, looking at her.</p><br/><p>Lin Qian was now completely resting in his arms like a boiled shrimp, soft and red. He stared at her, kept buttoning up her shirt slowly, and lowered his head to kiss at her lips, \u201cGo to the parking lot and wait for me in the car.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUmm.\u201d Lin Qian took the car keys from his hand. Even after having seen him thousands of times, when her gaze touched his, her heart still turned soft and shuddered. Thinking of the fondling in his office, she felt it was getting even more ridiculous, timid and sweet.</p><br/><p>She stood up and turned her head to look at him again. Then she cleared her throat, walked to his desk and picked up his cup on the table, took a large mouthful, moistened her dry throat, and then headed out.</p><br/><p>Li Zhicheng\u2019s shirt was ruffled as he sat on the couch, watching her as she left. He then stood up and adjusted his clothes. After the heat from their activity had faded away, he sat back at his desk and called in Jiang Yuan, handing him the documents he had signed.</p><br/><p>Then he looked down at his watch; 10 minutes had passed. He picked up his suit jacket and stood up. He picked up the cup of water she had drank from and slowly tilted his head backwards for a refreshing sip before walking out of the office.</p><br/><p>Although Lin Qian had complained that Li Zhicheng didn\u2019t miss her, deep down she actually appreciated his great self-control that drove him to put his career and Aida ahead of her. Despite chasing her first, up until this day, he was the one who had been acting freely in the relationship.</p><br/><p>However, Lin Qian had no idea Li Zhicheng clearly knew that it wasn\u2019t true.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t put his career above her, nor did he feel fully capable of acting freely in the relationship.</p><br/><p>In the past two months, he had nearly put down the piled-up, brow-furrowing work and flown to see her.</p><br/><p>That was when she had been on the business trip for over a month. One night she called him. At that time he was sitting in the office, having just finished the day\u2019s final meeting and was tired. Hearing her voice, he felt as if a stream from a spring rushing in the darkness, feeling careless and lazy.</p><br/><p>After talking for a while, she started talking about something small that happened during the day.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy brother called me today and asked about us,\u201d she said.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh?\u201d he rubbed the space between his eyebrows, eyes closed, and whispered, \u201cWhat did you talk about?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Qian seemed to have thought for a while before laughing, \u201cHe asked how our relationship is going, and I said I\u2019ve been on a business trip recently. He\u2019s definitely pleased that the two of us can\u2019t see each other, and naturally can\u2019t break through the line of defense he built.\u201d</p><br/><p>She spoke with candor and said it flippantly. Noticing that he remained silent, jokingly, she added \u201cI also told him that if he gave me a cassock, I would totally pass for a nun.\u201d</p><br/><p>That was a very ordinary yet heartwarming conversation. She was still cute and motivated through the phone.</p><br/><p>However, after hanging up the phone, Li Zhicheng looked at the files at hand without turn a page for a long time.</p><br/><p>She always had a lot of concerns and considerations when it came to work. But when it was related to him, she never thought too much and was always straightforward. Yes meant yes, and no meant no. After becoming his girlfriend, she always put her sincere and simple heart in front of him.</p><br/><p>But this time, after being separated for more than a month, she implied \u2013 she tried to made it sound natural yet failed \u2013 that she wanted him to visit her. That was why she those sentences. However, she couldn\u2019t bear this to really affect his work, so after many times attempting to tell him what she wanted, she only made a light joke of herself,</p><br/><p>\u2026 give me a cassock and I would totally pass for a nun\u2026</p><br/><p>Thinking of this, Li Zhicheng felt a tightness in his chest.</p><br/><p>After a moment of silence, he had called to Jiang Yuan, \u201cGet me a ticket on the earliest flight tomorrow to Nanjing, and one returning the day after tomorrow.\u201d Nanjing, at that time, was where Lin Qian was.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yuan paused a little, but he soon came to a realization. But he still had to bite the bullet and embarrassingly advise, \u201cPresident Li, tomorrow you have appointments with the general managers of two supermarkets, and their time is very difficult to secure. Also, President Kang from Ming Sheng arranged for you and the municipal government\u2019s Business and Industry Bureau to meet in the afternoon.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Zhicheng briefly interrupted him, \u201cPostpone them all.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yuan didn\u2019t say anything again, nodded and went out.</p><br/><p>Soon, the ticket was booked and the itinerary was sent to Li Zhicheng\u2019s phone: The earliest flight leaves at 8:00 am. tomorrow. Fly to her side.</p><br/><p>Looking at the message, Li Zhicheng sat in the middle of the office that night and slowly smiled. Just when he was to pick up the phone and call her, Jiang Yuan knocked again. This time his expression was very serious and shocked: \u201cPresident Li, news has just come in that the sales manager of New Bori was planning to discuss their cooperation with President Wang of Mind, but was publicly rejected. This news has spread\u2026 \u201d</p><br/><p>Before Jiang Yuan finished his sentence, Li Zhicheng\u2019s cell phone and the landline both started ringing at the same time, continuing for a while. Gu Yanzhi, Liu Tong, the production department, the procurement department\u2026 and even his father, were all calling to ask if it would cause any impact on Aida, and what to do afterward.</p><br/><p>By the time Li Zhicheng had addressed the matter, it was already 1am. He also arranged a conference call with President Wang and several senior staff members that morning.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yuan was also busy following him around. When they finally left the office that evening, Jiang Yuan asked him, \u201cPresident Li, the flight to Nanjing tomorrow\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCancel it,\u201d he replied.</p><br/><p>A few days later, this small disturbance had completely subsided, and there was full communication with Mind. In the dead of night, he called Lin Qian. After chatting for a while as usual, he whispered, \u201cMissing you.\u201d And the simple two words made the woman fall silent for a long time. For the following few days, she still sounded uncontrollably delighted and pleased over the phone.</p><br/><p>The elevator slowly descended and Li Zhicheng was standing inside, all alone.</p><br/><p>With a ding, the elevator door opened. When he looked up, he saw his Land Rover, quietly parked in the corner not far from the parking lot. His woman was sitting quietly and lovingly inside at the moment, waiting for him.</p>\n</div>"}

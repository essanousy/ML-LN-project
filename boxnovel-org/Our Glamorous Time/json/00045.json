He remained silent for a moment but was still adamant to not resign himself to defeat. He stretched his hand and pressed lightly onto that area of hers, pressing to the point that her body trembled slightly before he got up and lay back down atop her body.</p><br/><p>Under the blurry light, the woman looked at him with wide eyes. There was guilt and heartache within the depths of her gaze, but also a trace of slyness.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, is it very uncomfortable?\u201d she stretched her hand and lightly pushed onto his chest.</p><br/><p>Li Zhicheng was very clear that this woman was temporarily feeling her heart ache for him but got over it soon after and regained her usual mindset, deliberately starting to tease him again. At that moment, she had seemingly forgotten that she was lying half-naked in his embrace. Following the lifting action of her hand, the beautiful part of her body revealed an even more vivid and seductive outline.</p><br/><p>Li Zhicheng\u2019s gaze got darker as he looked. But Lin Qian was acting if she had not noticed and looked at him while giggling, \u201cHurry and have a cold shower. Next time, next time it will definitely go smoothly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Her smiling face was a sweet, beautiful light that blinded his eyes even more so than a fully naked body.</p><br/><p>He had no plans to suppress it any longer.</p><br/><p>Lifting his hand, he grabbed one of her hands.</p><br/><p>He slowly lay sideways next to her body and allowed her to rest her head on one of his arms, her entire body still remaining in his embrace.</p><br/><p>\u201cLin Qian, help me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Understanding his intentions, Lin Qian felt a gush of blood rush to the top of her head, which then rushed to the hand that was in his tight grasp.</p><br/><p>As they gazed into each other\u2019s eyes and after a moment of silence, she softly replied, \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><br/><p>This was the first time that Lin Qian would touch a man\u2019s part of the body that had the desire to enlarge. In the dim light, she could clearly hear her own breathing and Li Zhicheng\u2019s heart thumping against his chest not far away.</p><br/><p>He guided her hand to the area around his waist. The two hands, his hand, her hand, both slowly unbuckled his belt. Lin Qian felt a layer of hot air covering her face, but such heat could not compare to the area where Li Zhicheng had brought her hand and pressed it to.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, when Li Zhicheng was touched by her slightly cold fingertips, his breath caught momentarily. He extended his hand and tightly secured her head in his chest, allowing her hand to freely and jerkily roam his lower areas, randomly kneading it.</p><br/><p>Lin Qian was a clever person, and though she had never done it before, she knew the principle behind it. And under the guidance of Li Zhicheng\u2019s low voice telling her a few pointers, she got the hang of it in no time. Between moving up and down, in and out, she felt Li Zhicheng slowly tighten his grasp of her hand. His heartbeat had also seemingly got faster and faster.</p><br/><p>Initially, she was rather nervous and shy, but after doing it for a while and getting past the nervousness, she slowly grew more relaxed. Hence, she lowered her head and snuck a glance downwards, her mouth growing dry the more she looked.</p><br/><p>Her hand was also starting to play some tricks, suddenly speeding up then slowing down, suddenly using more strength then growing gentle again. At the same time, she even smiled up at Li Zhicheng, \u201cHow is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Zhicheng felt his blood rush from her playfulness, and extended his hand to grab her chin, looking down at her before saying word by word, \u201cFor all that you have done tonight, I will definitely return the favor.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Lin Qian remained silent.</p><br/><p>As they were nearing the end, Li Zhicheng got Lin Qian to bring a towel and place it between the two of them. Then, he hugged her tightly, pressing onto her and kissing her repeatedly. Meanwhile, looking at a man so aroused created such an extreme visual impact that it finally made her feel uncomfortable. Very uncomfortable. The depths of her body suddenly felt extremely dried-up and astringent, causing her entire body to feel out of sorts.</p><br/><p>What goes around comes around and the one that ended too fast was her. Now, the one who felt bad had become her too.</p><br/><p>Silence took over and the night became darker.</p><br/><p>Lin Qian lay in Li Zhicheng\u2019s embrace in discomfort, pulling on his taut muscles. As Li Zhicheng looked at her expression, he slowly broke into a smile.</p><br/><p>He picked up her hand and kissed it, asking in a low voice, \u201cHow many days?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Qian was stunned for a moment before she realized what he was asking about. She was embarrassed for a bit, answering, \u201cAround four days.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, Lin Qian\u2019s heart skipped a beat once again, and she felt sweet yet flustered. She buried her face in his chest and repeatedly grazed it, as if doing so could make up for things.</p><br/><p>The night was long and the two fell asleep in each other\u2019s embrace. They slept auntil the sun had long risen, which meant that they had missed even the well-known Golden Peak sunrise.</p><br/><p>Since they had already come to a famous mountain, why would they not climb to the peak? Hence, even though Lin Qian\u2019s body was not well, she insisted on continuing the climb up after she woke up. Thus, Li Zhicheng accompanied her and they slowly made their way up towards the peak.</p><br/><p>By the time they arrived at the Golden Peak, it was already one o\u2019clock in the afternoon.</p><br/><p>It was the exact time when it was the hottest and thus there were not many people. The sunlight pierced through the cloud cover and shone down, causing the mountains and forests near and far to be painted with misty golden rays.</p><br/><p>Li Zhicheng and Lin Qian found an empty spot with nobody around, only trees surrounded them with several mountainous rocks and the cliff off the peak in front. The two of them sat on a large piece of round rock. Li Zhicheng passed her some water and asked, \u201cHow\u2019s your body, is it still uncomfortable?\u201d</p><br/><p>Actually, Lin Qian was still rather not used to having a man so concerned about her these few days. She answered, \u201cJust like that. It\u2019s a bit painful but fine if I don\u2019t think about it.\u201d She was telling the truth. It was period cramps after all, and it varied from person to person. It was just that there would be a dull throbbing pain for her personally.</p><br/><p>After hearing this, Li Zhicheng did not say any more. He simply lifted his head and looked into the distance.</p><br/><p>Lin Qian looked at the vast mountainous view in front of her and also felt a broad sense of cheerfulness wash over her. Naturally, her mind drifted to Aida being in the midst of an unstable career moment at this point in time.</p><br/><p>\u201cLi Zhicheng.\u201d She asked, \u201cNow that Aito has been launched into the market, is it the longbow that you had envisioned? Is it a perfect longbow?\u201d</p><br/><p>Under the sunlight, she tilted her head to look at him.</p><br/><p>Li Zhicheng lifted up the water bottle and lifted his head, drinking a huge mouthful. After he set it down, he remained in his position looking forward and said, \u201cIn this market, the most perfect longbow can only be produced by the most outstanding company.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Qian was slightly stunned, then nodding her head, she said with vigor, \u201cRight, we are this market\u2019s most outstanding company.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Zhicheng turned his head to look at her, that gaze held an obscure meaning that Lin Qian could not clearly recognize. The sunlight shone down from his side, causing his outline to become even more refreshingly handsome.</p><br/><p>\u201cPreviously, you did not dare to look at my Art of War.\u201d He slowly opened his mouth, that throaty voice was seemingly laced with amusement, \u201cNow that you\u2019ve already become my woman, you are even more so afraid to look?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo what?\u201d Lin Qian lifted her head to look forward, the ends of her mouth betrayed her into a smile, \u201cI have the right to my own decisions.\u201d</p><br/><p>The last time he had wanted to share with her his investment plans, she had refused to take a look. Thus, ever since they had fallen in love, the two had never mentioned this one matter. Lin Qian did not know why he brought it up so suddenly at this moment.</p><br/><p>She heard him say calmly, \u201cIt\u2019s also fine if you don\u2019t look. However, if anything happens in the future, don\u2019t get a shock or cry from shock. Always remember, come and ask me first.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Qian was stunned for a moment listening to that. The future? What did his words mean? Were there still going to be huge variations in the future?</p><br/><p>His words made Lin Qian\u2019s heart go into a frenzied mess in an instant, but she couldn\u2019t open her mouth to ask either. However, he walked over to be in front of her and squatted with his back facing her, \u201cCome on up.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Qian asked, \u201cWhy do you want to piggyback me?\u201d</p><br/><p>He turned his head to look at her, \u201cIsn\u2019t your stomach aching? I\u2019ll carry you down the mountain.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Qian really wanted to say that it was just a little achy and would not affect her much. But when the words were at the tip of her tongue, she swallowed it back in, followed his advice and climbed onto his back. She tapped on his shoulder and said, \u201cPut me down when you\u2019re tired, I can still walk on my own.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Zhicheng did not answer. Carrying her, he turned around and started the climb downwards.</p><br/><p>The journey was actually very quick, considering that Li Zhicheng had one person on his back and was carrying two bags, the pace of his steps was seemingly not affected at all, as he took vigorous strides that were as graceful as the moving clouds and flowing water. On his back, Lin Qian was amazed, \u201cYou\u2019re meet the special forces standard, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Zhicheng answered, \u201cMore or less.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Qian felt beyond fortunate. Stroking his neck, she did not care about the looks from passersby. She leaned on his slightly damp back, helping to wipe the sweat off the side of his forehead and lowering her head to his neck to kiss it from time to time.</p><br/><p>As Li Zhicheng was being served by her in this way, even though he did not have many words, he was obviously joyful, quickly finishing such a long mountainous walk.</p><br/><p>During the night, the two of them sat on the bus returning to Lin City.</p><br/><p>As usual, they sat at the window seat, holding hands and exchanging words in soft voices. However, Lin Qian felt that they had a different sort of deepened intimacy and reliance this time, as compared to the journey before. When you have already become familiar with a man\u2019s every outline, of each and every inch of his body, even if you have not given yourself up to him entirely, you would have already formed a very intimate physical relationship.</p><br/><p>You would feel that you truly belonged to him. And he also belonged to you. Such an intimate relationship could tell the two of you apart from any others in the surroundings. It was like a small, inner circle where only the two of you exist, as if a small, exclusive world had finally been formed.</p><br/><p>When the bus arrived in Lin City, the two of their phones rang in succession.</p><br/><p>Li Zhicheng was first to pick up the call from Gu Yanzhi. His voice was laced with happiness, and one could almost imagine his pair of eyes that looked like that of a fox squinting slightly right at this moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cZhicheng,\u201d he said, \u201cOur Aito can basically be considered a success.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Zhicheng grasped the phone and looked around Lin Qian to the thriving city in the twilight, a smile slowly surfacing on his face.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, the phone call that Lin Qian received was from a marketing employee, a very competent subordinate. Her words were more direct and joyful, \u201cManager Lin! Good news! After totaling up the data this afternoon, the entire country\u2019s worth of Aida products have already been sold to the point that they are out of stock within just this weekend alone!\u201d</p>\n</div>"}

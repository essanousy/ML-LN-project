As she reported about her work to Xue Mingtao, the two ended up talking for quite a while.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re just stuck on the fabric materials,\u201d Xue Mingtao said. \u201cBoss has already talked to around seven fabric companies in the past few days, but to achieve the production quality at the cost he wants is not an easy feat.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Qian nodded her head.</p><br/><p>Fabric was the largest investment in the production of bags. And since they had hoped their \u201clongbow\u201d would be water-resistant, resistant against oil and grease, lightweight, fast-drying, and both soft to the touch and durable, they had to use a special outdoor-technology fabric.</p><br/><p>But just like other internationally well-known specialty fabrics such as Gore-Tex, WINDBLOC, Cordura and others, their prices were relatively expensive. The profit margin wouldn\u2019t be very big if they used one of those expensive materials. In this case, Li Zhicheng\u2019s \u201clongbow\u201d strategy would basically become a bunch of empty talk.</p><br/><p>Li Zhicheng hoped to find an outdoor fabric that was exceptional in quality and price. The brand did not have to be all that prominent but the quality was important. But it was just as Lin Qian had said: \u201cThe tougher things are, the more valuable they become.\u201d It had been half a month and there were no results so far. She heard that some of the subordinates were also in disagreement, but Li Zhicheng was adamant in his attitude. \u201cContinue searching.\u201d</p><br/><p>That afternoon, they had learned of a production company in Taiwan whose specialized fabrics fulfilled all of his requirements. Although they had also heard the company was extremely tricky and unwilling to collaborate, he still rushed over immediately when he heard the news.</p><br/><p>He left behind his sweetheart, whom he hadn\u2019t seen in days, and rushed over without a second thought. Lin Qian thought of it that way.</p><br/><p>In the evening, Lin Qian grabbed a coffee cup and sat out on the balcony admiring the glow of the sunset.</p><br/><p>She had worked tirelessly for almost a month and since the next day was the weekend, she had given herself and her team a two-day leave. Sitting here, it felt as though all her stiff and tense muscles were completely relaxed; the thought of the soul-stirring kiss in the car that afternoon made her smile uncontrollably.</p><br/><p>She wasn\u2019t sure if his trip to Taiwan would be successful.</p><br/><p>Such a man like him can also suffer a setback. Huh. Thinking about it made her heart go soft.</p><br/><p>Lin Qian fell deep in thought again. Taking out her phone, she sent Lin Mochen a text.</p><br/><p>\u2018What\u2019s your deal with Li Zhicheng? I want to know.\u2019</p><br/><p>Lin Mochen replied after quite a while. \u2018It\u2019s not the right time yet.\u2019</p><br/><p>Lin Qian suddenly had the urge to clench her teeth. The two of them! They had both given her the exact same answer. What were they doing beating around the bush like that!</p><br/><p>But she also understood when she considered her brother\u2019s personality. It was definitely her know-it-all older brother ordering Li Zhicheng around, and whatever requirement he wanted to be filled was sure to be difficult.</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t want it to be so difficult\u2026 Regardless of whether it was for the family business or whether it was for her personally.</p><br/><p>She was just about to send Lin Mochen a reply in a futile attempt to get him to take the initiative in canceling the agreement to lessen the burden and stress on Li Zhicheng\u2019s shoulders. At that moment, a new message came in. Lin Qian saw the name \u201cLi Zhicheng.\u201d Her eyes brightened and she opened it immediately.</p><br/><p>\u2018Already landed.\u2019</p><br/><p>Lin Qian felt a sweetness in her heart and typed, \u2018Alright, be safe.\u2019 Then she added a smiley face and sent the text.</p><br/><p>The page automatically jumped back to the texting screen and Lin Qian continued typing in an extremely good mood.</p><br/><p>Yup\u2026 The method must be thorough for it to be effective. Her brother had rationalized that his interference was ultimately for her happiness. She had to soften his heart. It would be difficult, but he could possibly change his decision and attitude.</p><br/><p>\u2018Bro, you said that you wanted to make him suffer. But it seems to have had the opposite effect.\u2019</p><br/><p>Puke, that\u2019s sorta mushy. Mushy and obscure and worth resenting.</p><br/><p>She thought for a while before sending out another one. \u2018I miss him\u2014he\u2019s left for Taiwan. I like him a lot. Just ditch your agreement, alright? That\u2019s all.\u2019</p><br/><p>After sending this, she sat and stared at the horizon for a bit.</p><br/><p>She had initially planned on faking her emotions for a bit so she\u2019d appear pitiful to her brother. However, she had already typed out her true feelings.</p><br/><p>Lin Mochen didn\u2019t reply. She couldn\u2019t turn back now, and tried to finish off the conversation by sending one last text. \u2018I like him so much that I can\u2019t take it anymore, so you have to scrap your agreement. It\u2019s not easy for me to meet someone I like this much. I haven\u2019t in years. This is not something that you can prevent because I don\u2019t want anyone else besides him. Do. You. Understand?!\u2019</p><br/><p>After sending that out, she felt her entire body relax. Then she felt the urge to laugh.</p><br/><p>She knew of her brother\u2019s temper, but her brother also knew of her temper. After saying these words, her brother would still remain stubborn. However, even if Li Zhicheng couldn\u2019t fulfill their secret agreement, he would turn a blind eye and allow them to be together.</p><br/><p>Hahaha!</p><br/><p>Her phone screen started to light up with the delivery notifications:</p><br/><p>\u2018Delivered to Li Zhicheng at 18:46:32.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Delivered to Li Zhicheng at 18:47:20.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Delivered to Li Zhicheng at 18:50:35.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Delivered to Li Zhicheng at 18:52:40.\u2019</p><br/><p>At first Lin Qian just glanced at them without a thought and pressed her lips together. So the signal hadn\u2019t been good, and now he would receive all four messages at once.</p><br/><p>Just as she was about to put her phone aside, there was an immediate response. She picked it up and looked at the screen. Within a moment, her forehead broke out in sweat.</p><br/><p>She had sent them to\u2026 Li Zhicheng?</p><br/><p>She hurriedly opened the history of the text messages and took another look. She was truly dumbfounded. She didn\u2019t know if she had been too engrossed in crafting the messages or if a glitch had caused the page to change without her realizing.</p><br/><p>Every message from the one that had asked him to \u201cbe safe,\u201d to the one that fiercely declared, \u201cI like him so much that I can\u2019t take it anymore,\u201d had been sent to the same person.</p><br/><p>Lin Qian\u2019s entire face caught on fire and her mind became a mess.</p><br/><p>They had sent to him. Those mushy, passionate words: \u201cmake him suffer,\u201d\u201dmissing him a lot\u201d and \u201cnot easy for me to meet someone I like this much.\u201d</p><br/><p>This would drive her to her death. Only because she\u2019d intended to send them to her brother had she used such over-exaggerated and bitter words.</p><br/><p>Even though she did like him, it wasn\u2019t to that level of passion!</p><br/><p>Lin Qian\u2019s face fell. Holding her phone, she tried to come up with something to send to make up for it, but couldn\u2019t think of anything.</p><br/><p>What could she say? \u201cSent to the wrong person?\u201d\u201dI was purposely trying to placate my brother, don\u2019t misunderstand?\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking at her phone, she felt like crying. No tears came out, yet her heart pounded incredibly fast.</p><br/><p>Just then, with a ding, a new message came in.</p><br/><p>\u2018From Li Zhicheng.\u2019</p><br/><p>Lin Qian was about to go crazy. She clenched her teeth and opened it, but there were only two words: \u2018I understand.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018I like him so much that I can\u2019t take it anymore.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018I don\u2019t want anyone else besides him.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Do. You. Understand?!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018I understand.\u2019</p><br/><p>Lin Qian looked at this short reply in a daze.</p><br/><p>She considered it for quite a while before suddenly screaming and burying her head in her arms.</p><br/><p>But after a while, she couldn\u2019t suppress it anymore and broke into a smile.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>At the Taipei, Taoyuan Airport, the sky was exceptionally blue. Both inside and outside the beautiful, modern airport there was a constant bustling crowd.</p><br/><p>Li Zhicheng held his phone and stood outside the terminal, his head lowered and his eyes focused. People streamed around him but it was as though he didn\u2019t notice at all.</p><br/><p>It was not until Jiang Yuan called out \u201cPresident Li\u201d two times did he lift his head.</p><br/><p>This was a situation never before seen. Jiang Yuan was slightly breathless, but he smiled while saying, \u201cPresident Li, the car has arrived.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Zhicheng put his phone away and followed him into the car.</p><br/><p>After riding in silence for a while, he lightly asked, \u201cDoes Lin Qian have a Taiwanese visa?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yuan\u2019s expression did not change as he replied, \u201cShe does. I settled the passports of all the executives.\u201d</p><br/><p>It had recently been a crucial period for taking care of business. The executives had needed their official passport documents settled so they could travel around without wasting any time.</p><br/><p>Li Zhicheng nodded. He looked out the window at the unfamiliar city scenery and as he thought about the texts he\u2019d just received, his usually stable and cold heart seemed to have been grabbed by the woman\u2019s hand lightly by the corner, making it hard for him to calm down.</p><br/><p>I miss him.</p><br/><p>This is not something that you can prevent because I don\u2019t want anyone else besides him.</p><br/><p>His heart clenched. Lin Qian, I miss you very much too. I want to caress you, finally pull you into my arms in my embrace, dote on you and never let you go.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Lin Qian was surprised by a sudden call from Xiaotang.</p><br/><p>Xiaotang was Li Zhicheng\u2019s chauffeur and had witnessed their shocking kiss that day. But Li Zhicheng only surrounded himself with people who could think deeply. Even his chauffeur.</p><br/><p>His tone sounded very natural. \u201cManager Lin, what time should I pick you up tomorrow?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Qian responded with a \u201cHuh?\u201d and her phone buzzed at the same time. It was an automatic message from Air China. \u2018The flight that you have booked, CA411 (Lin City, Taipei), will depart at 8:00 tomorrow.</p><br/><p>Hanging up her phone, Lin Qian\u2019s heart was flustered but also full. She sent Li Zhicheng a message. \u2018Why did you get me a flight to Taiwan?\u2019</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t that they suddenly needed her help for some work reason, right?</p><br/><p>His reply was fast. \u2018Come be by my side.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Just before she boarded the flight the next day, Lin Qian sent her brother a message. \u2018I\u2019m going to Taiwan. After I\u2019m back from this trip, I\u2019ll probably be with Li Zhicheng. About the agreement\u2014you can just do whatever you want with it.\u2019</p><br/><p>Aida had a specialty store in Taiwan that had been left by the previous CEO after a global expansion by the company. These stores had been shut down by Li Zhicheng in most places, leaving behind only a few as the support for their brand image.</p><br/><p>An Aida employee from Taiwan came to pick Lin Qian up in a car and drove her directly to the hotel where Li Zhicheng and the others were staying at.</p><br/><p>Lin Qian\u2019s room had a large bed. Though it was small, the room had been exquisitely decorated. It was a four-star hotel because Li Zhicheng \u201cnever splurged\u201d whenever he had to go out.</p><br/><p>There was a little balcony outside the room where she could stand and look down on a busy Taipei street market. Lin Qian stood there staring at the large city, realizing that she was slightly worried for him.</p><br/><p>The employee from Taiwan had said that President Li and Assistant Jiang had left for the Mind fabric production factory early in the morning. She\u2019d heard that the person in charge of Mind was an old fogey. He used to be a professor at Taiwan University, but with his sly personality it was uncertain if he would want the deal.</p><br/><p>Their trip took an entire day. When Lin Qian had first arrived the employee from Taiwan called Jiang Yuan. They were still waiting to meet with Mind and were temporarily unable to return. Thus, he had asked them to bring Lin Qian back to the hotel to settle in.</p><br/><p>At such a critical time, Lin Qian absolutely would not disturb them. So she waited in the hotel.</p><br/><p>Slowly, the sky became dark.</p><br/><p>Lin Qian went out for a walk by herself, ate some street food in the market, and even bought some little trinkets and interesting toys. When she got back to the hotel, they still had not appeared.</p><br/><p>Lin Qian did not find it painful to wait at all. She just felt\u2026 a bit worried for him and, ridiculously, felt her heart ache a little.</p><br/><p>Was the feeling of liking a person this pathetic?</p><br/><p>Why was it that the stronger, busier, and more capable she became, the more her heart ached for him? It was odd. Her inner self was too independent and strong to be used to heartache.</p><br/><p>As she let her mind wander, she eventually fell asleep on the bed. The television was still turned on and played a variety of shows, while the night sky outside the window grew darker.</p><br/><p>Lin Qian was suddenly jolted awake by the click sound of the door being lightly opened.</p><br/><p>She sat up straight in an instant. There was light shining in from the door. Someone\u2019s elongated shadow stretched along the floor. Then she heard Li Zhicheng\u2019s familiar voice say, \u201cThat\u2019s all then, early in the morning tomorrow, we\u2019ll go to Mind again.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yuan was also outside the door and he softly replied, \u201cAlright.\u201d</p><br/><p>There was a soft sound again as the door closed. He walked inside.</p><br/><p>Lin Qian looked at him with wide eyes.</p><br/><p>The light in the room was gentle, making everything in the room have a certain blurry quality to it. He wore a shirt with a tie and his suit was draped over his arm; his leather shoes were shiny. His figure looked exceptionally slender as he stood there.</p><br/><p>He stared at her without any of the awkwardness that a man would normally have after walking into a woman\u2019s room uninvited. He moved to the bedside, asking gently, \u201cYou\u2019re awake? I came in earlier but you were still sleeping.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Qian\u2019s face heated up. \u201cYeah\u2026\u201d She realized something. \u201cHow did you get my room key?\u201d No wonder she\u2019d only received one key card this afternoon when all the others had received two.</p><br/><p>\u201cI got it this morning,\u201d he said, tossing his suit onto the small sofa and sitting on the edge of the bed. His hands casually rested on the bed, trapping Lin Qian between him and the wall. He lowered his gaze to look at her.</p><br/><p>Lin Qian only wore a long-sleeved shirt and long linen pants. Although half her body was still tucked under the blanket, she couldn\u2019t help but feel a little self-conscious. She extended her arm and pushed his chest. \u201cYou go back to your room first. I\u2019ll talk to you after getting changed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Once she said that, his arms tightened around her. He held her, then locked her back onto the bed at the first opportunity.</p><br/><p>Lin Qian\u2019s heart palpitated. \u201cYou\u2026\u201d Her other hand had also been secured.</p><br/><p>He stared at her closely. \u201cMissed me a lot?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Qian\u2019s blush deepened. His voice was low but clear, like the night breeze blowing at the window, teasing her face and her heart. She turned to avoid his gaze that could penetrate nearly anything and tried to lead him to another topic. \u201cHow was the talk with Mind? This is a big deal.\u201d The moment she said it she felt stupid\u2014she\u2019d made it too obvious.</p><br/><p>Li Zhicheng\u2019s gaze was still locked onto the woman just an arm\u2019s length away. His voice had a trace of amusement. \u201cYeah, it\u2019s a big deal. I\u2019ve attained three years of exclusive rights to use their fabric at a hugely discounted price. The agreement was signed this afternoon.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Qian\u2019s eyes grew wide. Turning to look at him, she said, \u201cReally! That\u2019s great! That\u2019s great!\u201d She unconsciously gripped his wrists while hers were still held in his hands.</p><br/><p>Li Zhicheng looked at her joyful smile and the happiness in his eyes gradually deepened. He said softly, \u201cYes, finally. I have all my things settled and everything\u2019s in place for this battle. Now all we have to do is wait for New Bori to join in.\u201d</p><br/><p>His words made Lin Qian excited, and she felt as though she were floating in her own happiness.</p><br/><p>He had said he wasn\u2019t good with battles, but being decisive was obviously an innate part of his personality. At the start of this battle, he\u2019d said that they had to be prepared for anything and simply wait for their competitors to enter and die.</p><br/><p>He had maintained such composure and had been so merciless.</p><br/><p>Being like this gave him a sort of uniqueness and a manly charm that made him irresistible to women.</p><br/><p>Lin Qian did not say a word and simply looked at his straight posture and attractive eyes.</p><br/><p>He also stared at her.</p><br/><p>She thought that he would kiss her. Unexpectedly, he looked at her, held her hand and brought it to his lips before lowering his head and giving it a gentle kiss.</p><br/><p>\u201cI made an agreement with your brother\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Qian perked up. Huh? Is it the right time? Is he finally willing to reveal it?</p><br/><p>She looked like a cat, listening intently with her entire body rigid. Li Zhicheng gave a low laugh but continued kissing her hand, at the same time looking into her eyes.</p><br/><p>It was just like a knight kissing the princess of his dreams.</p><br/><p>\u201cBy this time next year, if I\u2019m at the top of the field, he\u2019ll give your hand to me,\u201d he said softly. \u201cLin Qian, I am very patient and I don\u2019t rush to get the things I want. However, you will become my woman for sure\u2014entirely solely Li Zhicheng\u2019s\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Qian stared at him, stunned.</p><br/><p>He put her hand down, returning her gaze with his dark eyes.</p><br/><p>Lin Qian laughed suddenly and said, \u201cTwo of the most intelligent men I know actually made such a childish agreement.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Zhicheng didn\u2019t say a word.</p><br/><p>Lin Qian let out a \u201cHmph!\u201d and said, \u201cWhat does us being together have to do with your ranking in the field?\u201d He remained silent, so she leaned forward and pecked him on his left cheek.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you still not understand?\u201d She lifted her head to give him another peck on his right cheek. \u201cI won\u2019t wait for the\u2014ah!\u201d</p><br/><p>Something strong grasped her waist. Li Zhicheng had a grip of steel and pulled her to his chest. The sudden action caused Lin Qian to gasp. But she was quickly silenced as Li Zhicheng threw his body forward and secured her against the wall, before lowering his head and planting a kiss on her lips.</p>\n</div>"}

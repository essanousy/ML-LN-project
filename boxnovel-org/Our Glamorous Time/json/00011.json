But no food, no matter how good, could cure the cold and foreboding expression on Li Zhicheng\u2019s face. He sat up straight like a military man, eating quickly and quietly.</p><br/><p>Lin Qian concentrated on eating too, trying to look humble and hide most of her presence.</p><br/><p>With a clang, the restaurant door opened again. Lin Qian heard the owner ask, \u201cHow many?\u201d</p><br/><p>Soon, Gu Yanzhi, dressed in a suit, sat down with them, throwing his car keys on the table.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello, Mr. Gu,\u201d said Lin Qian immediately. She then asked the owner to bring another set of plates and chopsticks for him.</p><br/><p>Li Zhicheng looked up at him briefly and then continued to have his lunch.</p><br/><p>Lin Qian hadn\u2019t had any friendly experiences with Gu Yanzhi in a normal situation before this. She saw that he could be very easy going. He took a pair of disposable wooden chopsticks from the restaurant owner and rubbed them together. He then asked Lin Qian for a cup of hot water and started eating.</p><br/><p>After a few bites, he put his chopsticks down and asked Li Zhicheng, \u201cHow was your morning?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Qian also stopped eating and looked at Li Zhicheng.</p><br/><p>Having already finished his lunch, he was sipping water, his head slightly bent. \u201cAs bad as I thought it would be,\u201d he replied.</p><br/><p>Gu Yanzhi nodded. \u201cI\u2019ve arranged a two o\u2019clock meeting for this afternoon. As we talked about yesterday, all the vice presidents and the important department heads will join us for a meeting on our future work priorities.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMmm,\u201d Li Zhicheng replied.</p><br/><p>Lin Qian felt her heart skip a beat. Li Zhicheng can finally start working and get to the real point of his position.</p><br/><p>As if guessing what she was thinking, Gu Yanzhi suddenly turned to look at her and asked evenly, \u201cI heard that you suggested Mr. Li\u2019s next priority should be finding a turning point and making a comeback\u2019?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Qian hesitated for a second and was about to answer yes, but suddenly paused.</p><br/><p>Did Li Zhicheng tell Gu Yanzhi everything I said the other day?</p><br/><p>Lin Qian blushed without speaking.</p><br/><p>Her bold statements like \u201cI\u2019d like to be your adjutant\u201d and \u201cthis side of me is the true me\u201d had been spoken naturally in front of Li Zhicheng. But to someone else besides her boss, Lin Qian was a little embarrassed. Even worse, it was Gu Yanzhi, a long-time member of the business world.</p><br/><p>She looked up and saw a faint but meaningful smile on Gu Yanzhi\u2019s face. She even detected a hint of a smile from Li Zhicheng, who was sitting quietly.</p><br/><p>After a moment of silence, Lin Qian spoke up with a smile, as if nothing had occurred in her thoughts. \u201cYes, that\u2019s what I think. I hope Aida can improve.\u201d</p><br/><p>That answer wasn\u2019t enough for Gu Yanzhi. He quickly asked again, \u201cOh, is it? Since you\u2019ve come up with such an interesting idea, could you tell me what turning point you\u2019re referring to? I don\u2019t want a generalized statement. What I need is a real solution and plan.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Qian kept quiet for a moment.</p><br/><p>In all honesty, when she had expressed her loyalty to Li Zhicheng the other day, she had indeed kept some things to herself. Like Gu Yanzhi said, she had only given Li a vague idea, not an actual solution. At the time, she wasn\u2019t sure if she would get the position of CEO assistant. It would have been too hasty for her to suggest the solution then. Besides, it was a plan full of risks.</p><br/><p>A workplace rule that Lin Qian had always believed in was to \u201cbrush off petty things tactfully, but to face important things bravely and practically.\u201d If she had to deal with everything tactfully and couldn\u2019t openly express her ideas, how exhausting and boring would things be?</p><br/><p>So she replied, \u201cMr. Li, Mr. Gu, I think the most appropriate turning point for the time being would be the Ming Sheng Group project.\u201d</p><br/><p>She stopped to gauge their reaction. Unexpectedly, she found them both watching her in silence, as if they were waiting for her to continue.</p><br/><p>So Lin Qian decided to take a risk and started her long speech.</p><br/><p>\u201cI think that because we need to turn things around, Aida needs to do something that will really reinvigorate us. I\u2019m not suggesting the Ming Sheng project because it can bring us a large profit. On the contrary, the profit from it might be very low, or close to nothing at all. It would be difficult for us to get the project too. But, I still think that it\u2019s the best way for us to get out of our dilemma right now.</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst, we would have to create a new market through the project. The consumer market is now being held firmly by New Bori and SMQ. Although that was a big share of ours, it will be too difficult and time consuming for us to make any breakthroughs in that particular market.</p><br/><p>\u201cOn the other hand, Ming Sheng Group is one of the top fifty enterprises in China and is state-owned. An order from them is almost like a getting a government procurement, which can greatly improve Aida\u2019s reputation. Besides, Ming Sheng has close relations with many peer companies in the system of the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission. More orders will come to us as long as we complete this order efficiently. We don\u2019t necessarily have to make money directly from the Ming Sheng project.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s also about morale. Our company\u2019s attitude and enthusiasm are as important as our performance. An important order like this one will surely boost the morale throughout the entire group and bring all the employees together under Mr. Li.</p><br/><p>\u201cLastly, the new base inspection we did this morning has really reinforced my idea. The raw materials that can\u2019t be used for the domestic market can be used in the Ming Sheng project. That way, our inventory can be used in one go and the state-owned companies will be impressed by our low prices and high quality. Aida\u2019s production chains will be revived as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, the employees, our production levels, and our market shares will all come back. Everything will be revamped.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>It was early in the morning back in the eastern United States.</p><br/><p>Having finished a full work day, Lin Mochen rubbed his face and habitually opened his personal email. He smiled when he read Lin Qian\u2019s email, which only said, \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>He was curious about the status of her current career choice, mostly because it was unconventional. He took out his cell phone and dialed her number.</p><br/><p>When Lin Qian received the call, she had just gotten back from lunch with her two bosses. Seeing the caller\u2019s number, she went to an empty stairwell to pick up the call.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey Lin Mochen, shouldn\u2019t you be sleeping?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Mochen smiled lightly and said, \u201cAssistant Lin, how do you feel about your new job?\u201d</p><br/><p>Remembering what she had gone through that morning, Lin Qian smiled and replied, \u201cWell, are you going to cheer me up?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMmm,\u201d he said, \u201cI want to see how long you can actually survive.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAw, Lin Mochen, can you stop being so evil?\u201d said Lin Qian, noticing that he seemed to be in a good mood. His investment had probably gone well that day.</p><br/><p>Lin Mochen was in such a good mood that he continued to joke around. \u201cOh, when I finished my work yesterday, I had some free time to do some simple research on Aida,\u201d he said casually.</p><br/><p>\u201cWow, that\u2019s so kind of you.\u201d Lin Qian was excited. She knew well that \u201csimple\u201d research from Lin Mochen would be worth thousands of dollars to an outsider.</p><br/><p>He smiled and said, \u201cBased on an analysis of their current situation of markets, debts, and assets, with the compensation being deducted for the loss resulting from the Carcinogen Incident, I\u2019ve calculated that the capital that the entire Aida Group can raise and use in the future can\u2019t be more than ten million dollars. And their overall business is experiencing negative growth, so if there isn\u2019t a new growth point, that ten million dollars will continue to shrink rapidly, and Aida will soon go bankrupt.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Qian was shocked speechless.</p><br/><p>Ten million dollars? Only ten million? That\u2019s what\u2019s left of a company that used to have a billion dollars in assets?</p>\n</div>"}

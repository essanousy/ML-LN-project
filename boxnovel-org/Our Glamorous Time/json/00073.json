For instance, when DG promoted their second and third-tier brands after it set foot in China, or how DG brought ZAMON to the front line of the battlefield after Li Zhicheng used the \u201cfish in troubled waters\u201d tactic. Or how the market was in a stalemate.</p><br/><p>ZAMON was like a delicately beautiful crystal ball and was hung at the apex of the market. However, without even realizing it, DG had shown all its cards \u2014 funds, personnel, brand reputation and all the channels and resources SMQ had. Besides, DG tied the top-tier brands and the ordinary brands together.</p><br/><p>If someone pushed them from the back, ZAMON and the whole of DG China, would fall to the ground and be smashed. Lin Qian thought that it was time to do that.</p><br/><p>Then an unexpected event occurred. DG had become the controlling shareholder of Old Aida. There was more than one thing following the misfortune.</p><br/><p>Lin Qian was lying in the bed of her apartment and was talking with Li Zhicheng on the phone. \u201cI\u2019m so glad that Mr. Li is okay,\u201d she said tenderly, \u201cI was startled by the news.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Zhicheng was walking hurriedly to the gate for his flight to Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, and was dressed in business attire. The light was dimming in the night outside. He watched the plane arrive on the tarmac, and answered in a husky voice, \u201cNo need to be worried. I just got off the phone with him in the afternoon and he\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUm. Should I fly to visit him today?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Zhicheng stayed silent for a few seconds and said, \u201cNo need. Stay in Changsha for the time being.\u201d Lin Qian acquiesced.</p><br/><p>She was upset not because of Li Zhicheng\u2019s response. She knew perfectly what he meant. Old Aida was in the hands of DG now and the news stunned China\u2019s corporations and its media. Although Old Aida only made up an insignificant part of Aida Corporation, it still meant more to them than a business, but was a family business to the Li\u2019s. And for all the staff of Aida, especially the long-time staff, it symbolized Aida.</p><br/><p>Aida Corporation, as the leader of the resistance against the acquisitions, now lost its family business. How could the public not talk about it? They would certainly have divergent opinions on it. Some said the board of Aida had been compromised under the pressure of ZAMON and had reached a secret buyout contract with DG, and some said unity in Aida was gone and it was divided into two sides. Of course, it was likely that some people were spreading rumors and exaggerating the situation.</p><br/><p>Li Zhicheng didn\u2019t want her in Lin City to keep her away from all the trouble.</p><br/><p>As for Lin Qian, she was disappointed both because Aida had been stabbed in its back, and because of her incapability to prevent it from happening. \u201cWho sold the shares? Have you figured out yet?\u201d she asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Li Zhicheng looked up at the scene outside and became grave, \u201cApart from Gu Yanzhi, Xu Chengyan and my sister-in law also.\u201d</p><br/><p>At the same time, Mr. Gu Yanzhi, vice-chairman of Aida and universally considered the right hand of Li Zhicheng, was visiting the flagship store of ZAMON in New York while wearing a casual outfit with sunglasses, together with staff from MK Investment Management Corporation and DG Corporation.</p><br/><p>Before he went to America, he took a month\u2019s vacation, leaving behind his resignation at the same time. And now, with all these people clustered around him, he looked extra vigorous and leisurely. \u201cMr. Gu,\u201d a manager from DG Corporation asked with a smile, \u201care you satisfied with this trip?\u201d</p><br/><p>Gu Yanzhi took off his glasses and smiled at him faintly, \u201cHighly. Thanks for your warm welcome. I guess I\u2019ve fulfilled my dreams by earning enough money now. I\u2019ll start traveling around the world, starting with America.\u201d People around him burst into laughter. There was another Chinese manager who had flown to America with Gu Yanzhi. He smiled and stated, \u201cMr. Gu\u2019s willingness to sell shares of Aida left shocked. We\u2019re all wondering why.\u201d</p><br/><p>What he said was a little ambiguous. It was MK Corporation that negotiated the acquisition with Gu Yanzhi, and executives in DG only focused on the outcome. That manager, who\u2019d been a competitor of Gu Yanzhi, was a bit suspicious. Why did Gu Yanzhi sell the shares, leading to DG\u2019s becoming the controlling shareholder of Old Aida? He was fraught with doubts.</p><br/><p>Gu Yanzhi only smiled obscurely to all these questions. Seeing several people besides that man gazing at him, he answered briefly, \u201cPersonal reasons. Forgive me if I can\u2019t tell more.\u201d But nothing could be kept a secret forever. Why did Gu Yanzhi choose to exit Aida? People from MK Corporation would of course illustrate it to DG.</p><br/><p>A few days later, word spread in DG, and to the entire industry. \u201cGet rid of someone as soon as he has finished his work\u201d. This was a habit of all the Chinese who reigned. Gu Yanzhi might have been a prominent and indispensable shareholder of Aida, but since Li Zhicheng had taken charge, he introduced brands like Vinda and Aito one by one. Also, assets of the corporation went through a series of restructuring and stripping, with shares held by Gu Yanzhi severely diluted. His vital status was threatened by all these moves, alongside the rise of people like Xue Mingtao and Lin Qian.</p><br/><p>He was resentful of this. And when DG offered a generous buyout, he decided to go along with it.</p><br/><p>Opinions were divided among people in the industry. Some said Gu Yanzhi was a traitor who stabbed his former employer in the back, while others thought Gu Yanzhi would do a much better job at starting a business of his own thanks to his extraordinary talents and he was just choosing another path to live.</p><br/><p>Regardless, the consensus was that Gu Yanzhi had departed from Aida and cut all ties with his former employer. In the subsequent months, nobody knew where he was, what he was doing; it was as if he had never existed.</p><br/><p>As for Lin Qian, she got a call from the secretary of Xu Yong the day after she talked with Li Zhicheng. \u201cMs. Lin,\u201d the secretary was courteous, \u201cthe chairman just gave an instruction and he would like you to come to Lin City to visit him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it about?\u201d</p><br/><p>The secretary halted.</p><br/><p>Although he was the secretary of the chairman, everybody in Aida knew that Li Zhicheng was the man in charge. He, as the person closest to the chairman, knew that the CEO attached great importance to his fiancee</p><br/><p>.</p><br/><p>He answered inexplicitly, \u201cA new shareholder visited the chairman this morning and mentioned what happened lately, including you. The chairman hasn\u2019t been in good mood ever since.\u201d Lin Qian missed a heartbeat.</p><br/><p>Whether she should go to Lin City to visit Xu Yong or not was of no question to Lin Qian. She would look suspicious if she didn\u2019t.</p><br/><p>Xu Yong was a man of reason and he asked her there to clarify things. It would be better to go, as she didn\u2019t want any mistrust between her future father-in-law and herself. However, she couldn\u2019t go there unprepared.</p><br/><p>After hanging up the phone, she sat on her bed with her jaw on one question \u201cWhy did someone reveal the relation between her and Lin Mochen? Why did it occur right after shares of Old Aida were purchased, and Xu Yong was hospitalized for it?\u201d</p><br/><p>It might be a coincidence. Or someone did it on purpose. But who? DG? Chen Zheng? Or people in the industry, even within Aida; people who wanted to join DG?</p><br/><p>Everyone had their choices when it came to benefits. It wouldn\u2019t be surprising that such kind of people existed. But because of Lin Mochen, it wouldn\u2019t be someone from MK Corporation.</p><br/><p>What did they want to accomplish by using this scheme? To estrange Xu Yong from her? No. That would not be enough to crush Aida.</p><br/><p>Lin Qian\u2019s heart sunk. If Xu Yong knew this, it wouldn\u2019t be long before the public knew as well.</p><br/><p>She and Li Zhicheng had tried to keep it a secret, but they were too discreet about it. Aida was extremely stable, and she and Lin Mochen had refrained from being involved in the acquisition of Aida. Even if it became public, it shouldn\u2019t have been a big deal. There was no reason for her to be afraid.</p><br/><p>But now, everything had changed. Not only had the acquisition of Old Aida sensitized the public and the media, but cohesion in Aida was imperiled as well. If someone wanted to take advantage of the relation between her and Lin Mochen, she might not be able to defend herself whatsoever.</p><br/><p>Darn it!</p><br/><p>Lin Qian hit her bed with her hands angrily. Li Zhicheng was right that it would better for her not to go back to Lin City. She picked up her phone and called Li Zhicheng.</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry, the phone you\u2019re trying to reach is unavailable, please call back later,\u201d he was still on the flight back to China.</p><br/><p>At the same time, a call came from Xu Yong\u2019s secretary again, \u201cMr. Lin, the chairman brought it up again. He is an old man and cannot hold things in his heart. The doctor also said he couldn\u2019t be stressed again. Could you come here today? For his health\u2019s sake?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSure\u2026\u201d she replied. After hanging up the phone, Lin Qian analyzed the situation carefully. No matter where she stayed, Changsha or Lin City, she would be found if her opposition had made up their mind to give her a hard time. What risks would there be if she went to Lin City? The first thing that came to her mind was that Xu Yong hadn\u2019t fully recovered yet. If he got emotional when talking to her and his situation got worse, she wouldn\u2019t be able to handle it, so she decided to book a late ticket and would go there with Li Zhicheng after he arrived at Lin City. It would be better if he was there.</p><br/><p>Besides, her rivals might tell the media, or spread rumors within Aida. If it was Chen Zheng, based on his track record, he might start a rampage again, so she would be extra careful to avoid any uncertainties.</p><br/><p>But there was a silver lining after all. No matter what their rivals were thinking, they could only make groundless accusations. Lin Mochen and Li Zhicheng were both capable enough to distance her from it and deal with any public backlash. She didn\u2019t need to worry too much.</p><br/><p>After comforting herself, she picked up her phone and asked her secretary to book the ticket, after which she called Gao Lang to tell him to bring some guards to pick her up at the airport. Only after such a careful arrangement did she feel relieved.</p><br/><p>Though there wasn\u2019t much to be afraid of, she was going into the mountains knowing that there were tigers there.</p><br/><p>It was at dusk when Li Zhicheng arrived at the airport of Lin City. He saw three missed calls and one message from Lin Qian when he turned on his phone on the car. \u201cYour father wants me to meet him at Lin City and I\u2019ve arrived,\u201d he heard as her voicemail played.</p><br/><p>Li Zhicheng called her immediately, but she\u2019d already turned off her phone. Li Zhicheng thought silently for a while and said to Jiang Yuan, \u201cStay here and pick up Lin Qian. I\u2019ll go to the hospital first.\u201d</p><br/><p>Why would Li Zhicheng go to the hospital first? First of all, he was worried about his father\u2019s health. Also, he wanted to solve the issue with his father before Lin Qian arrived. He didn\u2019t want Lin Qian to face his father\u2019s questions and have to defend herself alone.</p><br/><p>It was already nightfall when he arrived at the ICU. Li Zhicheng saw his father lying on the bed when he walked in. He looked much more emaciated than he\u2019d been several days ago when Li Zhicheng had just went abroad. His eyes that used to be sophisticated but clear now seemed a little turbid. Li Zhicheng frowned and sat down beside him.</p><br/><p>\u201cI was told that you are stable now,\u201d he whispered and held his father\u2019s hands.</p><br/><p>\u201cI was furious at Chengyan,\u201d Xu Yong answered in a hoarse voice, \u201cI can understand that your sister-in-law want to sell her shares, but how could he?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xu Chengyan, was Xu Yong\u2019s son born out of wedlock after he was divorced.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t affect the whole picture,\u201d Li Zhicheng said gradually, \u201cand you don\u2019t need to be angry about it.\u201d Xu Yong didn\u2019t agree with his son. He was both sick and old, and no matter how open-minded he was, he had his own stubbornness.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe old Aida, what you all call Old Aida now,\u201d he said slowly, \u201cthat was my precious. I built it step by step.\u201d He looked at his son with his dim eyes, \u201cWill you get it back for me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI will.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xu Yong nodded his head.</p><br/><p>After a while, he asked, \u201cLin Qian\u2019s brother is leading this acquisition?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Zhicheng answered with a straight face, \u201cYes, but he\u2019s just following his company\u2019s instructions, and he avoided Aida. As for Lin Qian, she went to Mind. There won\u2019t be any impacts.\u201d</p><br/><p>He explained everything with a few sentences. Xu Yong looked at him with a fixed stare. \u201cDid you choose not to tell me because you knew that I wouldn\u2019t be comfortable with it?\u201d he asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter all, Lin Qian is my daughter-in-law-to-be, but her brother\u2019s trying to buy the entire bag industry in China. Are you sure he\u2019s not using you to achieve his goal?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Zhicheng looked up at him and said, \u201cHe won\u2019t be able to do that, and he can\u2019t use me.\u201d</p><br/><p>They both stayed silent for a while before Xu Yong went on, asking, \u201cMust you marry Lin Qian? Have you thought it through? Because I don\u2019t think you two will be compatible.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need to think, I must marry her.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xu Yong didn\u2019t say anything.</p><br/><p>They stayed silent for a while and Xu Yong said, \u201cIf I know, everyone else will know. Protect her at all costs and you\u2019d better take her out of spotlight. Marry her only after this is over. Don\u2019t let a woman face this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know,\u201d said Li Zhicheng.</p><br/><p>He looked at his watch, got up and started to walk out. Just as he reached the door, he turned around and said, \u201cDad, you\u2019re overthinking this. Only the strongest can have a voice. If I can banish DG from China, who dares to say another word?\u201d</p><br/><p>What he said showed his high spirits and fortitude as a young man. Xu Yong smiled and nodded. Li Zhicheng walked out the door. It was quiet in the hallway and the light was giving a soft glow. He raised his head and saw Lin Qian sitting on the bench at the entrance.</p><br/><p>Li Zhicheng was perturbed.</p><br/><p>Lin Qian also stood up, gazing at him with a complicated look.</p>\n</div>"}

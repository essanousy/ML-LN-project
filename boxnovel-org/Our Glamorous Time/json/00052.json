It was exciting, but also agitating. He put his hands on her sides and looked down at her. He seemed to be examining or appreciating her with his dark eyes and wasn\u2019t inclined to start yet.</p><br/><p>Lin Qian blushed in embarrassment at his his perplexing look and said in dismay, \u201cWhat\u2019re you looking at?\u201d</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t answer her, but there was a trace of a smile in his eyes. The smile was rippling like water in a limpid lake, and the waves were drifting off to the deep of his pupils, where the light was gloomy inside.</p><br/><p>Then everything returned to quietude. His eyes were bright and mesmerizing again. He gave nothing more than an ordinary look, which, nonetheless, made Lin Qian fluster.</p><br/><p>She felt like a prey running for long and finally captured by him. As for him, he was delighted at the moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow should we deal with the clothes?\u201d He stared at her with his head down, and his voice was deep but forceful.</p><br/><p>Lin Qian was also looking at him. His eyes were like abyss with gravity, pulling her inside and entangling her while she completely surrendered to it.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you want to do?\u201d she whispered, with a blushing face and quiet movement. She wanted to do what he expected and soon, there were a pile of women\u2019s clothes on the floor of his bedroom.</p><br/><p>Lying completely naked right in front of him, Lin Qian felt her face burning and her heart drumming because of this exceptional night. It was still a little chilly outside, whereas inside the room, there was an intangible fire being lit and floating in the air, sizzling everything.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about the clothes I\u2019m wearing? You haven\u2019t\u2026\u201d he spoke under his breath.</p><br/><p>Lin Qian missed a heartbeat while remaining still. \u201cWhy should I undress the both of us?\u201d she protested.</p><br/><p>Why am I the one who does all the work?</p><br/><p>Li Zhicheng didn\u2019t mind. When he saw her reluctance, he grabbed one of her hands and put it on his waist. He stared at her reticently, as if he would swallow her next second. Lin Qian started to blush again and submitted herself to him. Although she\u2019d seen his body several times, when she actually saw him naked once again, she felt like her heart was jumping out of her chest.</p><br/><p>They were sitting opposite to each other, as naked as newborns. This was the first time that there was nothing separating them, and their souls were exclusive to each other. Lin Qian\u2019s throat got drier. She lowered her head and didn\u2019t say a word. Li Zhicheng gradually put his hands on her shoulders and gently pushed her back on the bed. He bowed down instantly and went to the same place as she did.</p><br/><p>Lin Qian didn\u2019t feel excited, or impulsive, or even fazed. She felt at ease. She felt his body weight and his heartbeat. An unprecedented sense of steadiness struck her because she was being embraced by this man, and every inch of her body belonged to him. Never before had Lin Qian felt so clearly and fervently that they were meant for each other.</p><br/><p>Just when her heart was quavering, Li Zhicheng\u2019s voice, deep as water running ploddingly at night, rang beside her ears. \u201cLin Qian,\u201d he said slowly, \u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d At that moment, Lin Qian heard her heart racing. \u201cSure,\u201d she murmured, and grabbed his back.</p><br/><p>Never in my life have I been so willing and keen. I will give it all to you, and only to you.</p><br/><p>She was finally overwhelmed by the waves of affection and crumbled in his arms. As for Li Zhicheng, he felt a deep connection with her.</p><br/><p>She could smell his breath and hear his heart romping, Lin Qian felt a tear welling up in her eyes. Her heart, like her body, was full of him. Filled with joy and empathy. Affection and empathy for this man. She loved his tenderness and perseverance on the bed and empathized with him who couldn\u2019t help but tremble on her.</p><br/><p>Lin Qian\u2019s throat was dry, she reached her hands to his hair and caress it, and she murmured, \u201cLi Zhicheng, I love you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Zhicheng held himself up and looked at her. His eyes were darker than any night, and more limpid than any sea. He stroked her heated cheeks, and his look became more fervent.</p><br/><p>\u201cI fell in love with you,\u201d he whispered, \u201cthe second I saw you.\u201d</p>\n</div>"}

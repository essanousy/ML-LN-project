She made him a cup of hot tea and when she put it on his desk, he reached out his hands and dragged her into his arms. This was such a familiar scene, which had happened so many times in the past year that she smiled during her sleep.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, they went to the bed, with Li Zhicheng\u2019s body pressing from above, and all she could see was the contour of his body. He murmured, \u201cLin Qian, only death could do us apart.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Qian opened her eyes and looked at the ceiling. They were in the resort in Taiwan, and the sun was blazing outside. It was still daytime, so she wondered why she would have such a strange dream. Li Zhicheng would never say anything so sensational as \u201cOnly death could do us apart\u201d. Even if he wanted to express that sentiment, he would say it in a mighty way, \u201cNo chance I will let go a person that I trade with my heart.\u201d</p><br/><p>She put on a smile and rolled out of her bed. Li Zhicheng was sitting on the sling chair on the porch outside. Lin Qian sighed and thought to herself, \u201cWe\u2019re doing exactly what Gu Yanzhi said, collecting money at home. I can still remember how busy we were, and now one of us is taking an afternoon nap and the other is enjoying the sunshine.\u201d</p><br/><p>She randomly picked a pair of flip-flops and put them on. She walked to him and gave him a kiss on his neck. \u201cHaving a dream about me?\u201d Li Zhicheng asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow did you guess?\u201d Lin Qian was dazed.</p><br/><p>Li Zhicheng grinned, pulled her into his arms and they sat on the sling chair together, with the chair swaying. The chair was made a long time ago; it was smooth, bright, and comfortable to touch.</p><br/><p>As a matter of fact, Li Zhicheng knew this because he had overheard Lin Qian talking in her dream, \u201cZhicheng, Zhicheng\u2026\u201d And the corner of her lips was curved up.</p><br/><p>\u201cInstinct,\u201d he, however, answered with a white lie.</p><br/><p>Lin Qian opened her eyes wide, thought about it and nodded, \u201csynced minds.\u201d Actually, she was thinking of the phrase, \u201cempathy between bodies and souls\u201d, but saying such thing to Li Zhicheng equated to seduction, so she didn\u2019t let it slip.</p><br/><p>All ladies would be moved by \u201csynced minds\u201d. Lin Qian blinked, hooked his neck and asked, \u201cWhy do we always see eye to eye with each other?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Zhicheng stared at her face, \u201cBecause we have empathy between our bodies and souls?\u201d Li Zhicheng rendered her speechless and put her lips on his. After this silent but passionate kiss, Lin Qian sat on his thighs and looked out at the farms, roads and factories.</p><br/><p>They were meant for each other now, unlike a year ago when lots of conflicts existed between them. Time flew, as did the conflicts.</p><br/><p>Lin Qian recalled the most serious dispute between them, and it was not because of Aito. It was three months after that, when Aida was secretly designing a new brand of leisure bags to prepare for a launch and Lin Qian\u2019s team was responsible for marketing plans.</p><br/><p>No matter how well their minds were aligned with each other, it was impossible for them to agree on everything. That time, the plan designed by Lin Qian\u2019s team was vetoed by Li Zhicheng, who said only three words, \u201cNo. Redo it.\u201d</p><br/><p>In reality, she hadn\u2019t worked on the majority of the plan. Instead, it was one of her subordinates, with support from others on the team who pulled lot of all-nighters to finish it. The subordinate was a young girl; and being criticized like that by her boss in public made her want to shed tears. As for Gu Yanzhi and Liu Tong, they wouldn\u2019t give much thought to a staff member at her level. After reviewing the plan, they censored it too.</p><br/><p>Lin Qian\u2019s heart was broken seeing her subordinate dejected in that manner. She thought it was a great plan. Obeying seniors\u2019 direction was key, but it was also important to voice her own opinions. She stood up and began to illustrate her thoughts. Lin Qian\u2019s personality, as Li Zhicheng had once said, was sometimes even bolder than a man, especially when she was trying to reason with people. She brought up eight points to show the plan was great.</p><br/><p>After finishing, everyone was stupefied and silent, not because the nay-sayers were convinced, but her eloquence had made people unwilling to argue.</p><br/><p>At that point, Li Zhicheng gave her a look from afar, with a vague trace of a smile, and said calmly, \u201cWhat you said makes sense. However, the market orientation of this product doesn\u2019t match our initial strategy and my expectations. Redo it.\u201d</p><br/><p>He went right to the heart of the matter, and people around him nodded their heads. Some people may have agreed with Lin Qian, but they chose to remain silent. Lin Qian couldn\u2019t squeeze out a smile. She sat down darkly and answered, \u201cOK.\u201d</p><br/><p>After arriving back at home, Lin Qian turned a cold shoulder to Li Zhicheng. She realized afterwards that she was being immature, but she was still furious at that time. Different opinions aside, she was his girlfriend after all, how could he just embarrass me like that in front of everyone else? She refused to make eye contact the entire evening. As for Li Zhicheng, initially, he didn\u2019t think of it as a big deal, but after arriving home and realizing how angry he had made her, he tried to flirt with her in an opaque way.</p><br/><p>He noticed that she only ordered her portion when calling for take-out, so he picked up the menu, ordered the exact same thing and ate next to her. When she tried to dodge him silently, he dragged her into his arms and restrained her. She resorted to finishing the meal while sitting on his thighs.</p><br/><p>She stormed into the shower, locked and put a chair in front to the door. He opened the door with his keys, removed all the obstacles and stepped inside the bathroom. He stood and did nothing except stare at her. When she tried to retrieve her towel, he brought it to her and when she was about to reach the face-cleanser, he mistakenly brought her the mask. Lin Qian wanted to laugh, but she managed to resist it.</p><br/><p>After all that, they were finally on the bed. Lin Qian turned her back to him. He asked, \u201cDo I need to show you my loyalty again?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Qian blushed and said, \u201cNo need!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAbsolutely!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen turn your back,\u201d he tried a strike a bargain.</p><br/><p>Lin Qian then followed his instructions unwillingly and turned to face him, but she kept her eyes closed to avoid eye contact with him.</p><br/><p>\u201cHave you ever heard of the term \u2018no fight among couples should last overnight\u2019?\u201d he whispered. Lin Qian couldn\u2019t respond. After being kissed and caressed like this by him, she relaxed her body as well as her will.</p><br/><p>After recovering from her exasperation, she came up with an incredible idea to deal with those types of situations. She said, \u201cI know we shouldn\u2019t confuse life and work, but \u2026 But I\u2019m a woman! I\u2019m sensible and don\u2019t want to be embarrassed. I can\u2019t be rational like you are. My suggestion is, from now on, every time you want to veto my plan in a meeting, instead of being so forthright, touch you left eyebrow and say \u2018This is a good plan but I hope to see better\u2019 so that I know you mean \u2018This plan is awful and redo it\u2019!\u201d She blinked her eyes, \u201cDoes it sound OK to you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Zhicheng held her in his arms with a bright look. \u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><br/><p>However, he never touched his eyebrow after that. Once he did say the same thing, which agitated her, so she asked him immediately after they arrived home, \u201cDid you forget to touch your eyebrow?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said mildly.</p><br/><p>It was only then that Lin Qian realized he was just teasing her.</p><br/><p>As for Lin Qian, she was changing too. She came to realize that sometimes it was her naivety that led to confrontations. They were in both a romantic and a work relationship. If they brought issues from the workplace back home, their romantic relationship might be jeopardized, like the Aito incident. After contemplation, she suggested that no discussion of work would be allowed at home, which Li Zhicheng agreed to with pleasure.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019re you thinking about?\u201d she heard that low but gentle male voice. Lin Qian was brought back to the ground, turned to him, \u201cNothing. Just recalling how you\u2019ve bullied me before.\u201d Li Zhicheng was used to this woman\u2019s duplicity. Although she had a stern look on her face, there was a trail of cunning smile in her eyes.</p><br/><p>He nodded his head. Since she was \u201cnostalgic\u201d about being toyed with, he didn\u2019t mind seeing more eye to eye with her. \u201cI\u2019m so going to \u2018bully\u2019 you on the chair tonight,\u201d he said in a low voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cDarn you,\u201d Lin Qian flushed and swore.</p><br/><p>Sunset brimmed every street in the town. Youngsters were having fun in their leisure time and whistled when they saw Li Zhicheng and Lin Qian\u2019s car. They were scheduled to visit Wang Taishi tonight. Lin Qian called her brother from the car. It was still the elegant but artificial female voice in English. She hung up and looked at Li Zhicheng who was driving, \u201cI have no idea what my brother\u2019s up to. Every time I call him it goes directly to voicemail, but he\u2019s always like that when he\u2019s working on a big project.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Zhicheng only gave her a faint smile. Lin Qian gazed at him with her jaw on her hands, and said, \u201cActually, you remind me of him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not your brother,\u201d Li Zhicheng said.</p><br/><p>There was a profound meaning behind what he said, and Lin Qian was somewhat bewildered. Lin Qian told Li Zhicheng about her brother\u2019s past. What he meant was\u2026\u201dI will not lose the woman I love,\u201d Li Zhicheng glanced at her. Lin Qian was dazed and didn\u2019t say a word. It really made a person wonder when it comes to life and human nature. Li Zhicheng and Lin Mocheng, were like a twins in the workplace. Unfortunately for her brother, only after he went through agony did he realize what he really wanted. As for Li Zhicheng, he was sincere with her, and from all these days together, he had a stronger and stronger grip on her.</p><br/><p>\u201cNothing\u2019s impossible,\u201d said Lin Qian, \u201cand it really depends on your future performance.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Taishi lived in a two-story house. The street lights were lit, shining gently across the trees and steps outside the house. Quiet and peaceful, that was how it looked. Li Zhicheng had brought two bottles of Maotai. Lin Qian held his arm and rang the bell. Wang Taishi\u2019s son, the financier who deliberately revealed his weaknesses and tricked Ning Weikai, opened the door. He looked much more handsome than his father, fair-skinned, refined and wearing a pair of golden-framed glasses. He welcomed them inside with a grin and shouted, \u201cDad! Mr.Li and Ms.Lin are here!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Qian couldn\u2019t resist glancing at the willowy and handsome Li Zhicheng beside her.</p><br/><p>Li Zhicheng and Wang Taishi had become friends and regarded each other as equals. Although Wang Taishi\u2019s children were the same age as Li Zhicheng, they treated him extra courteously. Each time Li Zhicheng sat and spoke with Wang Taishi while drinking tea, the youngsters would sit aside politely.</p><br/><p>As for Lin Qian, her heart raced every time when she saw how stable and mature he was compared to his peers. Wang Taishi\u2019s wife was a retired college professor, but in contrast to her husband\u2019s pretentiousness and haughtiness, she was much more easy-going. She was a short woman with elegant make-up and a warm smile on her face. She even sounded a bit na\u00efve when she talked, probably because she\u2019d stayed in an ivory tower for her entire life and was spoiled by her husband.</p><br/><p>Everyone was enjoying the hotpot. After only a few drinks, she asked Lin Qian, \u201cQian, when\u2019re you planning to get married?\u201d Lin Qian was drinking her juice when she heard this. She made an \u201cAh\u201d sound and did nothing but smile.</p><br/><p>Wang Taishi interjected, \u201cA marriage certificate is just a piece of paper for young people nowadays. Your own son isn\u2019t even married yet and you have the time to worry about others?\u201d He changed the topic and looked to his son, \u201cWhen\u2019re you bringing a girlfriend home?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang\u2019s son nodded his head and said ambiguously, \u201cYes father, I\u2019m trying.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Qian knew why Wang Taishi changed the topic. Actually, everyone knew except Mrs.Wang. It wasn\u2019t the topic itself that was off-limits but asking in that way was an invasion of someone\u2019s privacy, especially when Mrs.Wang didn\u2019t know what was in Lin Qian\u2019s mind. Men like Wang Taishi, Li Zhicheng and Lin Mocheng were well-disciplined when it comes to interpersonal communication. Lin Qian didn\u2019t overthink it just like everyone else because she thought this topic was over. However, Li Zhicheng suddenly proposed a toast to Mrs.Wang and said, \u201cWe\u2019ll definitely send you an invitation when we\u2019re getting married.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone laughed. Mrs.Wang clapped her hands, said cheers with Li Zhicheng and glared at her husband, as if she were saying blamefully, \u201cWhy\u2019re you disrupting our discussion?\u201d Wang Taishi did nothing but laugh.</p><br/><p>As for Lin Qian, her heart skipped a beat when she heard Li Zhisheng speak of marriage. He was wearing a white shirt without a tie today. His cuff was a bit loose and he was holding a porcelain cup; he looked cultivated and attractive. He sensed that she was looking at him, so he looked to her too. There were waves in his eyes, possibly due to the steaming hotpot. The light radiated from the chandelier fell into his eyes. Lin Qian suddenly recalled the time when he first tried to pursue her and said to her, \u201cThis is the first time in my life that I want a woman.\u201d And now, after all these days, he was still giving her the same look and trying to tell her without words that he wanted her.</p><br/><p>Lin Qian turned her head around and took a sip of juice. At that moment, Li Zhicheng\u2019s cell phone rang. He looked at it and said, \u201cSorry I have to take this call.\u201d He stepped onto the balcony. Lin Qian couldn\u2019t help following him with her eyes, and the everyone was less engaged in the conversation as if they\u2019d sensed something.</p><br/><p>Wang Taishi ate the peanuts in front him gradually with a pair of chopsticks. He was patient and quiet.</p><br/><p>Li Zhicheng hang up the phone after a short while and open the door of the terrace. He subtly caught Lin Qian\u2019s eye. She smiled and walked to him. Wang Taishi also joined them. Wang Taishi asked with a bright look, \u201cAny good news?\u201d Li Zhicheng was smiling mildly, and he looked incredibly tall and built at night, \u201cIt\u2019s like you can do predict the future.\u201d He looked them two and said, \u201cZhu\u2019s Corporation just ordered that Ning Weikai is no longer in charge of New Bori and will be transferred to the new Internet subsidiary, where he will be CEO. He still holds a huge share of Sha Ying. And now, the second Zhu\u2019s brothers will take charge.\u201d</p><br/><p>Both Lin Qian and Wang Taishi calmed down after he finished. Though the past year, New Bori\u2019s market share in casual bags had decreased, but strenuous efforts were still needed if Aida wanted to wage a war against them, because of the existence of Ning Weikai. The centipede went on wriggling even when it was dead.</p><br/><p>But now, New Bori lost Ning Weikai as an eagle lost its wings. Although Zhu Hancheng was a talented man, he couldn\u2019t compare to Ning Weikai, and there would of course be a transition period when he took over. As for Aida, it would soar during while New Bori floundered.</p><br/><p>Li Zhicheng definitely understood these outcomes. He looked to Wang Taishi and said, \u201cMr.Wang, we can start manufacturing Aida casual bags now.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was already nine o\u2019clock when they went back at their resort from Wang Taishi\u2019 home. Lin Qian drove them back because Li Zhicheng had drank a great deal. His cheeks were reddened but he was still lucid. He sat on the sling chair and rubbed his forehead after arriving home.</p><br/><p>Lin Qian was very considerate of his condition. She made him an after-drink tea and brought him a warm towel. Li Zhicheng drank the tea while Lin Qian wiped his face. \u201cHow much did you drink?\u201d Lin Qian asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cQuite a few cups,\u201d he replied groggily.</p><br/><p>She nodded her head, unbuttoned his shirt, and wiped his neck. Men tended to consume alcohol when given good news. Li Zhicheng and the Wang\u2019s had drank one cup after another. Mrs.Wang would stop and give a toast on occasion, but Lin Qian wasn\u2019t worried at all.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t because he could handle much liquor, rather, he was incredibly self-disciplined. Some men would get drunk without even noticing it, but such things never happened to Li Zhicheng. He would stop when he felt he had enough and wouldn\u2019t take another, sip no matter how the others pushed him.</p><br/><p>Lin Qian had seen him drowsy but had never seen him drunk, and Lin Mocheng was exactly like him. Perhaps for men like them, it was crucial to remain sober and in control. After cleaning both his face and hands, Lin Qian asked him, \u201cDo you want to go to bed?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSure,\u201d he answered with a low voice.</p><br/><p>She aided him in standing up and felt half his weight on her body. Just when Lin Qian put him on the bed, he reached out his hands and dragged her on the bed. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she smiled, \u201cI need to shower.\u201d Li Zhicheng rolled over and pressed her under his body. The scent of alcohol rolled over her. He gazed at her with his sparkling eyes. \u201cLin Qian,\u201d he said, \u201ctell your brother that I, Li Zhicheng, am about to be the leader of the industry. From now on, you will belong to me completely and no one will interfere.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Qian was a bit astounded first, and then broke into laughter. The alcohol had indeed intoxicated him. Li Zhicheng, who was always reserved and serene, showed some insolence today. She hugged his neck and said, \u201cOK. From tonight on, I completely give myself to you with all of my heart,\u201d she halted, the went on, \u201cI\u2019ll be your woman and only yours. We\u2019ll be together, joyful and intimate like this every day. Does that sound great?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d he said gradually, \u201cit\u2019s a deal.</p><br/><p>Lin Qian\u2019s heart was racing while Li Zhicheng bowed down and started to kiss her. Somehow her body and soul were both keen, probably because success was within reach after tonight or because his scent was too seductive, or both. Their bodies intertwined with each other, zealously but silently. In the room overflowing with moonlight, only her moans and sound of tossing bedsheets were heard.</p><br/><p>The same night, across the city, there were many people just as happy as Li Zhicheng; Lin Qian, Wang Taishi, Gu Yanzhi and all the staff in Aida.</p><br/><p>Others were sorrowful, while still others were secretly planning something sinister.</p><br/><p>Lin Mocheng, who just finished a meeting about an investment project, was sitting in his office on Wall Street. He was looking at the hustle and bustle of New York\u2019s streets. Tired, he rubbed his forehead.</p><br/><p>He saw a missed call from Lin Qian when he took out his phone. He looked at the clock, and realized it was midnight in China. He put his phone aside, picked up the newspaper and started to read it leisurely with his legs crossed.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Ning Weikai, who had just been removed from the leadership of New Bori, had left the building. Tomorrow would be his last day.</p><br/><p>As for Chen Zheng, he was still sitting in his office and wallowed in contemplation. News of Ning Weikai\u2019s \u201cbanishment\u201d had been delivered to him as well. This year, Sha Ying had wrecked the whole market. SMQ\u2019s line of casual bags had suffered severe damage. And now, the CEO who\u2019d never had a good day in the past year, could finally smile. He felt like this was the time for him to turn the tables.</p>\n</div>"}

Then she asked herself, What for? At most the two would exchange a few hugs and kisses.</p><br/><p>But maybe he\u2026</p><br/><p>The corners of her mouth raised slightly.</p><br/><p>Whenever the workload became a little lighter, Jiang Yuan was immediately told to invite her to the office to keep him company, in the name of the job.</p><br/><p>Even just being around him counted as a rare pleasure.</p><br/><p>The night was quiet.</p><br/><p>Sitting on the couch, Li Zhicheng stared down at the documents with concentration in his eyes, appearing calm.</p><br/><p>Although Lin Qian kept him company, she didn\u2019t want to interrupt him too much. She was just beside him, constantly refilling his water, and tidying up the files.</p><br/><p>Occasionally she would look at the side of his sullen face, stare at his hands on the table, and she would have the urge to kiss him. But of course, she held herself back.</p><br/><p>Along with Li Zhicheng\u2019s great concentration, he would become hyper-focused on work. Lin Qian was fond of his determination, but also felt a bit annoyed.</p><br/><p>Lin Qian had never been a workaholic. Since she was taking a break from work, she was not going to do anything work-related. Having stayed with him for a while, she was getting bored, so she took out her phone.</p><br/><p>Soon it became 11:00 pm. Lin Qian yawned.</p><br/><p>Li Zhicheng, who had his head down, noticed.</p><br/><p>He looked up at her. \u201cSleepy?\u201d Then he put down the files and got up. \u201cLet me take you home.\u201d</p><br/><p>Just when Lin Qian was about to say yes, she looked at him and rolled her eyes. \u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cThought we agreed I\u2019d to keep you company. I\u2019ll just rest on the couch.\u201d</p><br/><p>I\u2019m not going home.</p><br/><p>I just want to be with you.</p><br/><p>Naturally, Li Zhicheng knew what she was thinking. After a brief silence, he picked up a cushion from the couch and put it on the arm of the couch. He then took off his suit jacket from the coat rack and handed it to her. \u201cCover yourself with this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSure.\u201d Lin Qian laid down on the couch, pleased. The male jacket was very large, covering most of her.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Li Zhicheng moved the laptop from the table. It seemed he was going to sit on the single couch and leave the bigger one to her. Without any thought, Lin Qian quickly sat up and grabbed his arm. \u201cNo. Just sit here with me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Zhicheng looked up at her.</p><br/><p>He put down the laptop, and went back to sit where he was. There was a faint hint of a smile in his eyes.</p><br/><p>Lin Qian\u2019s legs lightly touched his back from behind: intimate and sweet. Playfully, her legs kept rubbing him, over and over again.</p><br/><p>Although Li Zhicheng was focused on his work, with a beauty by his side his night was smooth and pleasant. But the bursts of touch and friction between his back and waist created ripples in his heart.</p><br/><p>He turned to look at her.</p><br/><p>Completely buried in his suit, Lin Qian only had her face sticking out. With her big clear eyes blinking, she asked softly, \u201cHow much longer are you working for?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Zhicheng could feel his breath pause a little.</p><br/><p>Staring at her sparkling eyes with a hint of anticipation, and those pale slender fingers of hers wrapped around his suit, Li Zhicheng felt a certain tender, soft breath coming out of her hair and fingertips and reaching his heart.</p><br/><p>He knew he finally understood what it meant to be tangled in softness.</p><br/><p>He was surprised that even he, Li Zhicheng, had this coming too. Despite the work piling up like a mountain, and his strong-as-iron determination, he was profoundly affected by her soft eyes.</p><br/><p>He put down the files and closed the laptop.</p><br/><p>Taking off his shoes, he was suddenly on top of her. Hands supporting himself on both sides of her body, he stared quietly at the woman under him.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo more work. I\u2019m spending some time with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although Lin Qian had initiated this, it was mainly because she wanted to have some fun for herself since he acted like he didn\u2019t care about her when there was work to do.</p><br/><p>But at the moment, seeing he had really left his job to kiss her, she felt her cheeks become a little hot. Feeling slightly apologetic, she said, \u201cHave you finished your work already? Maybe you should\u2014\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Zhicheng had already lowered his head, sealing her lips.</p><br/><p>A while later, lying in his arms, Lin Qian\u2019s hair and clothes looked a little messy.</p><br/><p>Although the couch was fairly spacious, it couldn\u2019t accommodate two people lying side by side. So with Li Zhicheng lying flat, she lounged on the inside, leaving most of her weight on him.</p><br/><p>\u201cAm I heavy?\u201d she whispered.</p><br/><p>Li Zhicheng put a hand behind her head and the other clutched her waist. He looked down at her. \u201cNope. How bad could it be?\u201d</p><br/><p>Women loved comments like that. Lin Qian smiled in his arms, her finger making circles on his chest through the shirt.</p><br/><p>\u201cTo be honest, I\u2019ve been feeling a little down lately, and I thought you didn\u2019t care about me that much\u2026\u201d She looked up at him.</p><br/><p>Only to find that his head faced down. Instead of gazing at her face, he was gazing at\u2026</p><br/><p>They made eye contact. Lin Qian followed his gaze and looked down at the slightly-open collar of her shirt: her soft pale breasts were clearly visible. Thanks to her prone position, the deep groove in the middle of them was particularly noticeable.</p><br/><p>Lin Qian had not at all expected that was why he was being silent. Her face suddenly turned red. A hand reached upwards to push against his face. \u201cDon\u2019t look\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Even before she had finished, her heart suddenly did a flip, and the left side of her chest felt heavy.</p><br/><p>His hands had already laid on top.</p><br/><p>Stunned, Lin Qian stared at him.</p><br/><p>He also stared back at her.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think I care much about you?\u201d he asked in a low, slightly-husky voice.</p><br/><p>Lin Qian moved her lips, but no sound came out.</p><br/><p>\u201cI do care about you,\u201d he whispered, leaning down again and kissing her. And that hand, wrapped around the side of her plump breast, rubbed gently.</p><br/><p>Lin Qian felt like her entire heart was about to melt with his short reply. With both her hands clutching his collar against his silent tenseness, she closed her eyes, breathing slowly.</p><br/><p>He was also gradually increasing the strength in his hand; Lin Qian was starting to feel the heat through her entire body.</p><br/><p>And soon, this type of contact would no longer satisfy him.</p><br/><p>Lin Qian could feel his hand on her chest suddenly withdraw. He stopped kissing.</p><br/><p>Lin Qian opened her eyes, looking at him.</p><br/><p>His facial expressions remained the same.</p><br/><p>Then Lin Qian saw his hands unbuttoning her shirt.</p><br/><p>Her face was getting hotter and hotter. She even started to feel heat and dizziness in her eyes.</p><br/><p>Unconsciously, she grabbed his hands and said, \u201cWhat are you doing? This is your office.\u201d She had meant it as a protest, but her voice was quenched in honey, extremely soft.</p><br/><p>Li Zhicheng pressed her entire body into the couch. He looked down at her. \u201cThis is my woman.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Qian was shocked.</p><br/><p>Seeing that she was flushed with redness, but pulling on his hands to make them stop, Li Zhicheng stared at her and whispered, \u201cDon\u2019t you want me to kiss you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Qian\u2019s face almost began to drip blood. Only one thing went through her mind: Damn it! Why ask? How am I going to respond to this?</p><br/><p>However, somehow she became emboldened. \u201cNot unless I kiss you first!\u201d</p><br/><p>She was surprised that it came out of her mouth.</p><br/><p>Li Zhicheng looked amazed too. But he quickly adapted to the initiative of his woman, a smile flashing in his eyes. He grabbed her hand and pulled it to his chest. \u201cHmm, fair enough.\u201d</p><br/><p>Warm air blew through the silent room.</p><br/><p>His short hair had become very messy. His desire tightly pressed against her body. He stared at her with his pitch-black eyes. And his hand, clutching hers, fell on the first button of his shirt.</p><br/><p>Lin Qian could feel her dry throat. Her face was sizzling hot, and so were her head and hands. And her thigh, quietly pressed against his member, was even hotter.</p><br/><p>She slowly undid his first button.</p><br/><p>He stared at her face motionlessly with the willing eyes of prey.</p><br/><p>The second one was unbuttoned.</p><br/><p>His chest was exposed, flat, well-proportioned, and strong.</p><br/><p>Then the third and fourth.</p><br/><p>His shirt was open, a strong and attractive body in full view. His burning gaze was unusually deep.</p><br/><p>Lin Qian gently bit her lower lip.</p><br/><p>Women usually placed love above sex. At this moment, with her body touching his, Lin Qian forgot about her comment to \u201ckiss him first.\u201d She hadn\u2019t thought about how her comments and actions could affect a man.</p><br/><p>She stared at the beautiful chest of the man she loved and instantly felt the emotion filling her heart.</p><br/><p>I like him, I really do. I want to have him every second.</p><br/><p>Driven by this thought, she slowly reached out and grabbed his waist. She gently pressed her face to his bare chest.</p><br/><p>\u201cLi Zhicheng, I like you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Zhicheng went still for a moment.</p><br/><p>Looking down, he saw Lin Qian\u2019s closed eyes. She had pressed her cheek to his chest with a pleased look. The warmth exhaled from her petite nose, and her soft strands of hair, both brushed his chest. It felt like tens of thousands of feathers, exploring the expanse of his body for the greatest desire.</p><br/><p>When he rolled over, he pressed her down. Lowering his head to seal her lips, he effortlessly found the buttons on her shirt, and easily undid them one by one.</p><br/><p>When the phone rang, it was like a flash of lightning, waking up the two indulging lovers.</p><br/><p>It also seemed to kill the steamy silence in the room.</p><br/><p>Li Zhicheng paused. He then made eye contact with her and got up. At the same time he pulled his suit jacket over her, covering up her delicate body. He then sat down by the couch and reached for the phone on the table.</p><br/><p>Lin Qian\u2019s skin burned hotter than a fire. From her forehead to her neck and to her waist, there was still a soft, moist numbness. It made her feel as though she had just woken up from a long dream.</p><br/><p>She grabbed his jacket, trying to keep her breasts covered while sitting up. She realized that even as Li Zhicheng answered the phone call, one of his hands still lingered on her, pressing on his jacket to completely cover her body.</p><br/><p>The body that belonged to him.</p><br/><p>The thoughtful gesture made Lin Qian feel a sweetness in her heart. Quietly lying under his suit, she watched his flushed, handsome face. His shirt was still open, and he sat very rigidly. His lust seemed to be lingering. It made Lin Qian\u2019s heart swell.</p><br/><p>Soon he hung up and turned to look at her.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m heading to the workshop.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><br/><p>Once again, he lowered his head and brushed his lips against hers. \u201cButton up your shirt. I\u2019ll be back once I\u2019m done.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing her acting so obedient, Li Zhicheng stared at her for a moment and started to slowly laugh.</p><br/><p>It had never occurred to him that he could explore her body at such a place. He was disappointed by the interruption. However, the fact that he had been able to get so far with her could be considered a blessing.</p><br/><p>He rubbed her head, pulled himself together, got up and left.</p><br/><p>Lin Qian waved to him. When the door shut, she turned her head and buried her face in his suit, her mind wandering around.</p><br/><p>Hmm\u2026 how\u2019s he going to cool down without a cold shower?</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>By the time Lin Qian woke up, it was morning and bright.</p><br/><p>The soft yellow sunlight shined through blinds, illuminating her face.</p><br/><p>The sunlight also gathered on the man\u2019s face; he lied next to her.</p><br/><p>Lin Qian looked up at him.</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t know when he had returned. Like his previous sweet gesture, he fell asleep on the couch with the suit covering the two of them. His handsome face was like a sleeping sculpture in the morning light; his large arm was still firmly wrapped around her waist.</p><br/><p>Lin Qian stared at him quietly for a moment, then returned to his arms and closed her eyes.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>After a fortnight, Aito, an exclusive urban utility bag brand of Aida, officially began its production.</p><br/><p>The domestic bag industry had broken out of its winter slump. A fireless battlefield was finally rekindled to a raging fire.</p>\n</div>"}

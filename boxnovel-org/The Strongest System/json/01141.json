Why did you back off once again?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Boundless Future Buddha Lord was truly helpless right now; he wanted to f*ck this fella over as well! However, that guy was always taking out the soap to scare him off. This wasn\u2019t even an issue about whether or not that other fella was killed \u2014 he didn\u2019t want to lose his life in the hands of that lad!</p><br/><p>He did not know just how many times more that soap could be used for. But, when he looked at how brazen that lad was, not even showing a trace of fear despite coming to face him, the Boundless Future Buddha Lord knew that he must definitely have some tricks up his sleeves. And of course, that was none other than that soap.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Buddha Lord\u2026\u201d The Boundless Future Buddha Lord was just about to say something when he was totally stumped by the sight before him.</p><br/><p>The Void Master God had suddenly wailed out tragically, as his body had an entire hole blown through by a punch of Lin Fan! Not only that, his God Core was even in the hands of that lad!</p><br/><p>\u201cHAHAHA\u2026!\u201d Lin Fan roared out in laughter. Once he threw out that punch of his, who would dare to fend against it? While those Master Gods might be powerful, what sh*t use was that right now?</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked over at the Void Master God. \u201cHow about now? Are you starting to feel fear just yet?\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking at his chest, the Void Master God found a gaping void that was hollower than anything else could be. Fresh blood was gushing out freely like a stream as he raised his head over at Lin Fan. \u201cRETURN ME MY GOD CORE!\u201d</p><br/><p>He had not expected that this would be the sort of end he would come to. How in the world could the strength of this Indigenous Being possibly be this crazy? Earlier on, he had clearly defended against this attack! And yet, the Indigenous Being just ignored his barrier entirely and came straight for him, pushing that fist through his chest and seizing his God Core away.</p><br/><p>They were Master Gods! Without God Cores, they would be no different from cripples. In fact, they might even die from it. The reason why their bodies were so formidable was because they received the nourishment of the God Powers. Without the God Cores providing that sustenance, their God Bodies would just rot out and fall apart eventually.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan pursed his lips. \u201cAre you, like, dreaming or what?\u201d</p><br/><p>Sensing the power of the God Core in his hands, Lin Fan\u2019s lips curled into a smile. This was some good stuff indeed; the God Power within was boundless like the oceans. Now that the Void Master God had lost his God Core, what other capabilities could he possibly have?</p><br/><p>\u201cNOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO\u2026!\u201d The Void Master God howled out.</p><br/><p>BAM!</p><br/><p>Lin Fan used a little bit of strength. However, the God Core seemed as though it had just received some impossibly tremendous force, causing it to shatter apart instantly as the God Powers within gushed out and dissipated into the world.</p><br/><p>Gradually, the light in the eyes of the Void Master God dimmed out as he lost every single bit of life.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026 Congratulations on killing Void Master God.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026 Experience Points + \u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>The feeling of killing Master Gods were simply way too great. The notifications from the System had Lin Fan especially feeling a sense of euphoria. Honestly, words were not enough to describe that sensation.</p><br/><p>Looking at everything before him, the Chasm Master God was just scared witless. To think that out of four Master Gods, he would be the only one left standing after the others were slain by that Indigenous Being!</p><br/><p>His entire heart froze up as fear crept in. This was especially the case after realizing that the gaze of the other party was locked onto him, causing him to feel a deep rooted fear. At this moment, that impossibly steady and firm God Heart of his was actually showing signs of failing as it quivered out.</p><br/><p>This Indigenous Being\u2026 He was no ordinary human at all!</p><br/><p>\u201cChasm Master God, you\u2019re the only one left now. As for that bald monk, you can just forget about him. There\u2019s no way he\u2019s going to be able to save you.\u201d Lin Fan chuckled out.</p><br/><p>The Chasm Master God looked at Lin Fan and then turned his gaze toward the Boundless Future Buddha Lord, his eyes shining with a glint of Godly light. Right now, the situation was extremely disadvantageous for him. The strength of this Indigenous Being had already far surpassed his imagination; he no longer had the confidence of being able to suppress him.</p><br/><p>\u201cBoundless Future Buddha Lord, just when in the world are you thinking of striking out? Every single time, you\u2019re being so dodgy and evasive! Do you know that you\u2019re betraying us by doing this?\u201d The Chasm Master God yelled out.</p><br/><p>The Boundless Future Buddha Lord had once made an oath. Therefore, he was naturally not in cahoots with this fella here. But, if he were to behave as such each time they wanted to strike, what else could they do about him?</p><br/><p>Now that three of those Master Gods had fallen, this was an extremely incomparable loss for the Moon Shadow Mainland.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t easy to become a Master God, and it was especially the case for the stronger Master Gods. All of them would require time to solidify their powers. Now that three of them were dead, how were they going to continue with their invasion of the Endless Mainland?</p><br/><p>The Boundless Future Buddha Lord was infuriated in his heart; even that Buddha heart of his had long gone berserk. He knew that everything was all caused by this lad here. However, what else could he do about it? The treasure in the hands of that lad was simply way too frightening to deal with. If he did not put his guard up against this guy, he might not even know how he would die!</p><br/><p>Right then, the Chasm Master God was contemplating about escaping. He no longer wanted to stay here; he definitely had to escape!</p><br/><p>Looking at the situation before him, Lin Fan\u2019s heart skipped with joy. \u201cThinking of running, eh\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>Roaring out furiously, the Chasm Master God sent an extremely thick Chasm aura exploding out. The void tore to open a single gap instantly, looking like the malevolent mouth of a gigantic heaven devouring beast. Within it was a destructive aura that was exuding forth, threatening to annihilate all existences.</p><br/><p>\u201cIndigenous Being, you don\u2019t have what it takes to have Your Master God killed!\u201d The Chasm Master God no longer wanted to linger in this place. He knew that if he were to do so, the only thing awaiting him would be death. Right now, all he could do was to make his escape from this place hastily so that he could inform the other Master Gods about this; they had to know that there was an Indigenous Being this strong within the Endless Mainland. Also, the Boundless Future Buddha Lord was not to be depended on!</p><br/><p>Standing at the entrance of a deep chasm, the Chasm Master God turned his gaze toward the Boundless Future Buddha Lord. \u201cAfter I head back, I\u2019ll tell the other Master Gods about everything that has transpired. You are not working with us at all\u2026You\u2019re just diminishing our strength!\u201d</p><br/><p>He had an extremely huge issue with the Boundless Future Buddha Lord right now. They had worked with him from the very beginning; yet, he was the cause of the deaths of many Master Gods up to this point. There was no need to think further about his connection with all the events happening right now.</p><br/><p>Standing in the void, the Boundless Future Buddha Lord spoke up, \u201cChasm Master God, you should not do that.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Chasm Master God howled out in rage, \u201cI should not do that? What should I do then? Even though you are not in cahoots with this Indigenous Being, you are clearly harboring motives of your own! Do you really think that we Master Gods will believe in you? After I leave this place, you will be the same as this Indigenous Being here\u2026an enemy of us Master Gods!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled out, \u201cChasm Master God, you had better leave with haste. I\u2019m going to let you off. Go, go! Remember now, this bald monk is no kind soul. Cooperating with him is as good as courting death. Heck, he can even destroy his very own clan and line. Do you think that he would want to work with you guys wholeheartedly?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Boundless Future Buddha Lord had suppressed all the Senior Old Masters of the Good and Evil Buddha Sect. Even though those Senior Old Masters were his juniors, they were all from the same orthodoxy. However, the Boundless Future Buddha Lord showed no mercy as he took them down all the same. As for any disciples of the Buddha clan that tried resisting, all of them were slain.</p><br/><p>This was just a tyrannical reign.</p><br/><p>The Chasm Master God looked at Lin Fan deeply. \u201cIndigenous Being, you had better watch out\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, the Boundless Future Buddha Lord closed his eyes gently before jerking them wide open. \u201cUnexpectedly, things have turned out as such. Since that\u2019s the case, there\u2019s no way I can let you leave then.\u201d</p><br/><p>BOOM!</p><br/><p>An infinite Buddha light blanketed the entire world as a gigantic Buddha palm covered the sky and that endlessly deep chasm. Under the might of this gigantic Buddha palm, the entrance of the chasm crumbled down, blocking the path of the Chasm Master God at the same time.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you trying to do?\u201d The Chasm Master God hollered out in rage. He had not expected that the Boundless Future Buddha Lord would really make a move.</p><br/><p>The Boundless Future Buddha Lord closed his palms together and only said one word in response. \u201cAmitabha!\u201d</p><br/><p>Catching sight of this, Lin Fan chuckled out. Taking a step forth, he pushed out with a single palm strike. \u201cChasm Master God, thank your lucky stars for today. Hurry and leave\u2026 Yours Truly will help you defend against him\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>BAM!</p><br/><p>The Buddha light dissipated out. When the Boundless Future Buddha Lord caught sight of this, his heart was filled with rage. \u201cLad! Mind your own business!\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking at Lin Fan deeply, the Chasm Master God muttered, \u201cMany thanks\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He had not expected that this lad would be the one to help him at this point! Turning around, he made his move to leave immediately.</p><br/><p>But all of a sudden, a dull sound drifted out.</p><br/><p>The Chasm Master God turned his head around. Out of nowhere, he found a dagger stabbed in his waist.</p><br/><p>\u201cYOU\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shook his head exasperatedly. \u201cRemember this\u2026Never ever turn your back on your enemy\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Chasm Master God, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

To think that a powerful being from the ancient race would die just like that! How could that be?</p><br/><p>Just who in the world was this person here and how did he gain access to the secret ground?</p><br/><p>\"Impossible! Back in the Ghost world, I have been through tons of trials and tribulations and have escaped death for so many times! Finally, I\u2019ve reached this point after climbing up step by step! How can I die right here just like this?\"</p><br/><p>Mu Tian started to attack frantically. However, the dragon formed by Biggra howled malevolently. Even if he managed to slap out the dragon to dust, it would gather back and form together once more.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan burst out laughing. Even though his killing of this desolate celestial powerful being was due to him taking advantage of the situation, this could be considered an opportunity in itself.</p><br/><p>Opportunities were not only limited to seeking out treasures. For him, it was to strike out with thunderous blows and taking down others right when they were at their weakest.</p><br/><p>60,000 experience points! That was a pretty significant amount, and he was one step closer to leveling up once more.</p><br/><p>So what if that was a desolate celestial upper-level being? He was still slain like a pig nevertheless.</p><br/><p>Even if Lin Fan were to bump into Long Xuan right now, he would no longer be the same person he was back then where he could only struggle helplessly and think of ways to run.</p><br/><p>\"Just who in the world are you?\" Mu Tian looked at Lin Fan warily. He did not stop his struggles as he continued fighting against the Biggra dragon.</p><br/><p>However, none of these attacks would work on this dragon conjured by Biggra.</p><br/><p>Even though Lin Fan\u2019s cultivation state wasn\u2019t as high as Mu Tian, the True Skill seeds that he had cultivated were not seeds that Mu Tian could hope to compete against. And those facts weren\u2019t even inclusive of the fact that Mu Tian was now heavily injured, and was on the brink of destruction.</p><br/><p>\"From the Xuanhuang World, I am Lin Fan, a human.\" Lin Fan tossed his robes aside and looked over at Mu Tian imposingly. \"In order to gain access to the secret ground, you have sold out our comrades from the thousands of races out there. That is a crime punishable by death.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan\u2019s eyes shone with killing intent. He was bent on killing this Mu Tian.</p><br/><p>The moment Mu Tian heard this name, he searched the fugitive list hurriedly as his face changed as well.</p><br/><p>\"I-impossible! Your ranking is in the 200,000, with a cultivation state of azure celestial middle level! How can you possibly cultivate True Skill seeds?\" Mu Tian glared at the fugitive list with frightful eyes, unable to believe the stats there.</p><br/><p>When he had witnessed Lin Fan deploying those True Skill seeds with such ease, he was almost certain that this was definitely a powerful being of desolate celestial cultivation state!</p><br/><p>To think that this guy was only an azure celestial after he checked the fugitive list!</p><br/><p>On the fugitive list, as long as one was ranked 300,000 and above, no matter who he was, he would be sensed by the Heaven\u2019s Will of the Ancient Saint World. Eventually, one\u2019s cultivation state would be sniffed out by the world itself.</p><br/><p>This was the biasedness of the Heaven\u2019s Will to give the ancient race the advantage so that they wouldn\u2019t send themselves to death unknowingly, without knowing the cultivation states of the other party.</p><br/><p>When one was talking about the Heaven\u2019s Will of the Ancient Saint World, there was no such thing as fairness. The only thing fair about this was the fact that the Heaven\u2019s Will itself had not intervened in the destruction of these beings from the other races.</p><br/><p>\"Hmph! The life of Yours Truly isn\u2019t something for a degenerate like you to understand. We don\u2019t have much more to talk about today. Your death has arrived.\" Lin Fan snorted coldly.</p><br/><p>If he had known from the start that Lin Fan\u2019s cultivation state was only an azure celestial middle level, Mu Tian might not have believed that this man would have what it took to kill him.</p><br/><p>However, upon watching how Gu Yao was cleaved down, he finally understood that this man wasn\u2019t bluffing at all.</p><br/><p>Compared to Gu Yao, his injuries were even more severe. If this man wanted to kill him, Mu Tian knew that it was going to be an easy task for Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>\"WHY DO SEEK TO KILL ME? WE ARE ALL BEINGS OF THE THOUSANDS OF RACES OUT THERE AND SHARE THE SAME GOAL OF RESISTING AGAINST THE ANCIENT RACE!\" Mu Tian howled out, trying to struggle for that last bit of hope.</p><br/><p>\"Don\u2019t talk to me about that. Back when you gave up the lives of your fellow comrades from the thousands of races out there as a sacrifice for these ancient race beings, your fate had already been decided.\" Lin Fan replied icily.</p><br/><p>\"HAHA! You\u2019re talking about those trashes?\" Mu Tian laughed wildly as his face turned ever more baleful.</p><br/><p>\"DO YOU EVEN UNDERSTAND THE TERRIBLE STATE OF OUR EXISTENCE RIGHT NOW? EVEN THE SECRET GROUNDS WHICH WERE THE ONLY PLACES WHERE WE COULD HOPE TO SEEK OUT A HOPE OF FIGHTING AGAINST THE ANCIENT RACE ARE CONTROLLED BY THEM! WHAT ELSE ARE WE SUPPOSED TO DO IF WE WANT TO GROW STRONGER FASTER?\"</p><br/><p>\"SO WHAT IF WE MAKE A SMALL SACRIFICE NOW? FOR THE SAKE OF A BRIGHTER FUTURE OF TAKING DOWN THESE BEINGS FROM THE ANCIENT RACE, EVERYTHING WILL BE WORTH IT!\"</p><br/><p>\"IF YOU TELL ME THAT YOU KILLING ME WOULD HELP YOU TURN STRONGER SO THAT YOU CAN TAKE DOWN THE ANCIENT RACE, THEN I, MU TIAN, AM WILLING TO DIE IN YOUR HANDS!\"</p><br/><p>Mu Tian screamed out at the top of his lungs, directing these words at Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>\"You have your will, and I have mine\u2026 Mine is to kill you.\" Lin Fan\u2019s face turned frosty. With a single slap, the void rumbled as the energy currents within them surged and tore through everything.</p><br/><p>\"YOU WANT TO KILL ME, MU TIAN? YOU\u2019VE GOT TO BE DREAMING\u2026!\" Mu Tian howled out. His road was far from the end right now! How could he just die here?</p><br/><p>\"YOU DO NOT KNOW JUST HOW CRUEL THE REALITY OF THE ANCIENT SAINT WORLD IS! WITH YOUR CURRENT WAY OF THINKING, THERE IS NO WAY THE THOUSANDS OF RACES OUT THERE ARE GOING TO GET STRONGER!\"</p><br/><p>\"That is not something you get to decide.\" Flipping his palm, Lin Fan slapped out at Mu Tian.</p><br/><p>The True Skill seeds in his body churned, bent on killing Mu Tian.</p><br/><p>The void rippled with a boundless amount of energy.</p><br/><p>Mu Tian was spitting out blood repeatedly. Against Lin Fan, his face was filled with horror.</p><br/><p>\"IF YOU REALLY WANT TO KILL ME HERE, HOW CAN I GRANT YOUR WISH? MU TIAN SWEARS THAT HE\u2019LL REMEMBER THE SEEDS OF VENGEANCE SOWED TODAY! BETWEEN YOU AND ME, ONLY ONE OF US SHALL SURVIVE IN THE FUTURE!\" Mu Tian hollered out as he slapped out with his Gigantic Sky Burial.</p><br/><p>\u2018EXPLODE!\u2019</p><br/><p>Mu Tian\u2019s heart was bleeding right now. This was a supreme grade spirit weapon as well as his only treasure. However, in order to keep his life, he could not think of anything other than this.</p><br/><p>As long as he could get to cultivate that spirit vein he had obtained, he could easily regain everything he had lost here.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan had not expected Mu Tian to sacrifice his own supreme grade spirit weapon like that.</p><br/><p>\u2018DEMON CITY!\u2019</p><br/><p>Lin Fan\u2019s palm slapped out as the humongous Demon City appeared. The big ancient demon clamored in anger as his titanic arm stretched out to grab at the Gigantic Sky Burial.</p><br/><p>BOOM!</p><br/><p>A dazzling light erupted out from within. The self-destruction of a supreme grade spirit weapon was far from ordinary. The power that was emitted was definitely enough to destroy everything around.</p><br/><p>The dragon of Biggra broke apart bit by bit before disintegrating completely.</p><br/><p>\"LIN FAN! I\u2019LL REMEMBER YOUR NAME! THE VENGEANCE TODAY, MU TIAN WILL MAKE YOU PAY FOR IT!\"</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>Lin Fan moved nimbly. Looking around, he frowned.</p><br/><p>\"Damn it. To think that I let that fella slip!\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan had not expected this move of self-detonating his weapon. To think that the power of a supreme grade spirit weapon\u2019s self-destruction could be this strong that even the walls of the Infinite Slaughter Ancient Realm were blown apart.</p><br/><p>As for where Mu Tian was right now, Lin Fan had no idea.</p><br/><p>After keeping silent for a moment, Lin Fan heaved in a deep breath.</p><br/><p>This was a huge loss to take. To think that Mu Tian was keeping this up his sleeves. But it didn\u2019t matter. This was a lesson learnt then. If he were to meet with such a situation in the future, he would know how to deal with it.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked around at the Infinite Slaughter Ancient Realm. He was in no hurry to leave.</p><br/><p>Whether or not this place had any hidden treasures, Lin Fan wasn\u2019t interested in that.</p><br/><p>He refused to believe that his luck was THAT good for him to be able to find a treasure in this secret ground which must have been combed thousands of times by so many other people for treasures.</p><br/><p>However, the killing intent in this place was pretty useful. It would do well to boost the power level of his War King\u2019s World Extinguishing Fist.</p><br/><p>...</p><br/>\n</div>"}

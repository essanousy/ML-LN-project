After all, he had already made his move.</p><br/><p>That short little dagger surpassed everything, with too many people having been scammed and killed by it.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026!\u201d The face of Ancestor Immortal Jiu Li was totally stupefied as though he could not believe everything. To think that this fella would strike out right at this moment! This was something he had not expected!</p><br/><p>He knew that the other party had already known of his identity, and both sides were not exposing the other while waiting for the best moment to strike. But, he would have never imagined that the other party would strike at this moment right away.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shrugged his shoulder and patted the other party\u2019s shoulder, stabbing yet another strike into his waist.</p><br/><p>\u201cRemember now, you must never ever turn your back toward strangers. But, by the time you understand this logic, it would already be too late.\u201d Lin Fan said with regret.</p><br/><p>As for Ancestor Immortal Jiu Li, how could he accept something as such happening to him? He was truly filled with indignance!</p><br/><p>He was a powerful being of the Ancestor Immortal state! But, he realized that the Ancestor Immortal Laws within his body were shattering apart continuously within his body right now, being destroyed by that endless and boundless Sword Will.</p><br/><p>He was filled with a deep unwillingness! However, it was all too late now.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan raised his hand and placed his five fingers onto the face of Ancestor Immortal Jiu Li. With a slight push, the latter fell back and landed onto the ground.</p><br/><p>Even at the time of his death, he might not have figured out what all of this was about.</p><br/><p>As for Lin Fan, he was feeling immensely pleasured beyond anything else right now. Amazing! This was way too amazing of a feeling! This was the type of feeling he craved for!</p><br/><p>Mo Qingxuan was totally flabbergasted by now. She could finally understand how Hall Master Black Demon had died, or perhaps, this was even exactly how he had died.</p><br/><p>She wanted to leave right now, but her legs felt like heavy rocks that wouldn\u2019t budge at all, as though they were frozen.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026! To think that you would kill senior brother! You\u2026!\u201d Zheng Qiankun\u2019s face was startled as though he was fraught with disbelief.</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe\u2026\u201d Lin Fan sniggered out as a notification rang out beside his ear.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026 Congratulations on killing Ancestor Immortal state lower level being.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026 Experience Points + \u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>When he looked at the experience points bar, Lin Fan\u2019s heart leaped with joy. Soon! It was going to be real soon now! He then cast his sight toward the two remaining people.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Zheng Qiankun and Fairy Bi Liu\u2019s faces were frightfully pale.</p><br/><p>\u201cRun!\u201d</p><br/><p>Their senior brother had been killed by the other party, leaving them without any will to fight back anymore. Even though they were Grandmaster Candidates of the sect, in the face of such a horrifying being, they simply had no chance at all.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan\u2019s body shifted in a flash as he sliced in a single fluid motion.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026 Congratulations on killing Golden Immortal full cultivation state powerful being.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026 Experience Points + \u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Killed in a flash, there was no hesitation at all on part of the monstrous Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>\u201cSave me! SAVE ME\u2026!!!\u201d Fairy Bi Liu screamed out tragically. That supremely beautiful faces of hers revealed an endless amount of fear right now.</p><br/><p>Thud!</p><br/><p>At that moment, the frantically escaping Fairy Bi Liu found herself knocking into the embrace of someone.</p><br/><p>\u201cAHHH! DON\u2019T KILL ME\u2026!\u201d When Fairy Bi Liu caught sight of the face of this person before her, she was so scared that her face was devoid of color, as though she had just seen a ghost.</p><br/><p>Her strength was formidable. Within the sect, there was no one who didn\u2019t fear her. But right now, she was the one being scared half to death.</p><br/><p>The person before her right now was no human, this was a ghost, a manifestation of Death itself!</p><br/><p>Lin Fan hugged Fairy Bi Liu and patted her back, \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Even though that voice was gentle, in the ears of the latter, it was just absolutely demonic. It was truly the voice of a demon that was seeking her life!</p><br/><p>Fairy Bi Liu sobbed out in tears as she begged, \u201cPlease don\u2019t kill me, please! I\u2019m willing to be your servant! Anything you wish for me to do, I will do my best to please you! Even if\u2026even if\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>Gradually, Fairy Bi Liu\u2019s face started flushing red as though she had just thought of something shameful. At the same time, she puffed her chest up high, allowing that perfect body of hers to stick right onto Lin Fan\u2019s body. She hoped that she could use this to persuade the other party into sparing her life.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are truly a beauty, so much so that it\u2019s truly somewhat difficult to lay my hands on you.\u201d Lin Fan sighed out.</p><br/><p>Fairy Bi Liu looked at Lin Fan and nodded her head silently, \u201cYes, I\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Splurt!</p><br/><p>But all of a sudden, the clean stabbing sound sounded out.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s a pity that there\u2019s no use no matter how pretty you are. You can only blame yourself for entering the wrong sect\u2026\u201d Lin Fan said regretfully.</p><br/><p>When the formidable Sword Will stabbed into Fairy Bi Liu\u2019s body, it caused the Golden Immortal Laws within her body to disintegrate immediately.</p><br/><p>Those eyes of hers which were initially filled with an endless amount of flirtatious intent gradually dimmed down and lost their charm. Lin Fan pushed Fairy Bi Liu away and looked at that body fluttering through the void, his heart filled with deep regrets.</p><br/><p>\u201cHais! The world has lost yet another beauty.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026 Congratulations on killing Golden Immortal full cultivation state being.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026 Experience Points + \u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026 Cultivation State leveled up.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Cultivation State: Ancestor Immortal lower level.\u2019</p><br/><p>BOOM!</p><br/><p>His aura exploded out as the Ancestor Immortal Laws wrapped themselves around his body. Lin Fan\u2019s heart leaped with joy; his cultivation state had leveled up once more! This feeling was too darned awesome!</p><br/><p>As for the treasures that these guys carried with them, Lin Fan could not be bothered to collect them at all. The items that he had obtained in the Triple Emperor Heaven Cache already constituted an abundant amount of wealth! How could he still be concerned over such small stuff?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy did you have to kill them!\u201d Mo Qingxuan gasped out in shock and disbelief.</p><br/><p>\u201cTheir sect wanted to kill me, so why should I not kill them?\u201d Lin Fan smiled in reply.</p><br/><p>Mo Qingxuan gulped down her saliva, \u201cAre you thinking about killing me as well?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan did not reply and simply held onto Mo Qingxuan while leaving the place immediately. This was not a place for them to linger on. It\u2019d be best for them to leave as soon as possible.</p><br/><p>Traversing through time and space, they arrived at a foreign place.</p><br/><p>As though she had lost every single bit of motivation, Mo Qingxuan collapsed onto the ground, crippled. She then turned around to Lin Fan and repeated her question, \u201cAre you thinking of killing me as well?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled, \u201cA little.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mo Qingxuan was alarmed, \u201cMy Suppressing Demons Heaven Faction did not trifle with you at all! Even though I was coveting your Kunlun God Mountain at the start, I\u2019ve never thought about killing you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shrugged his shoulders, \u201cWho\u2019s to tell?\u201d</p><br/><p>Mo Qingxuan felt that the other party did not seem to believe in her words. She then repeated with an even more emotional expression, \u201cIt\u2019s true! I truly had not thought about killing you!\u201d</p><br/><p>She was afraid right now, truly afraid. This was especially the case after witnessing how the other party had killed those three Grandmaster Candidates of the Kunlun God Sect mercilessly. There was even a woman amongst them with an unrivaled beauty that could match even hers!</p><br/><p>If most men were to catch sight of her, it would be hard for their hearts to not skip! And yet, there was not even a single emotion on this man\u2019s face!</p><br/><p>He killed as he wished! Horrifying! This was way too horrifying!</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at Mo Qingxuan and let out a look of dilemma, \u201cThis is a little troubling. Just how should I deal with you then?\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment Mo Qingxuan heard these words, her heart skipped a beat as her body broke out into shudders. But right then, she yelled out, \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSince you don\u2019t wish to die, I\u2019ll purify you then.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan pointed out his finger and started purifying her. This was the best solution he could come up with, to have her purified completely. He would then arrange her back into the Suppressing Demons Heaven Faction and have her serve him.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

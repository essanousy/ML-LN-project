This was especially the case for Hu Qing and the others, who had obtained quite a few cores. For them, this was a decent fortune that was gained.</p><br/><p>Out of everything, the most surprising reward was the Quasi-Supreme Grade Utmost Treasure Scarlet Blood Demon Saber.</p><br/><p>If they were to exchange that saber for Contribution Points back in the sect, that would be an astronomical sum to be gained.</p><br/><p>In fact, there would be many strong disciples or even elders who would come forth and try to exchange for this Scarlet Blood Demon Saber with all sorts of medicines and pills.</p><br/><p>\u201cFor the trip to the Earth Abyssal Demon Cave this time around, it is really all thanks to Junior Brother Lin!\u201d Su Hongchen said.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right! If not for Junior Brother Lin, we might have already died within there!\u201d When Hu Qing thought of a certain event, he felt chills traveling down his spine despite it having passed.</p><br/><p>Those Earth Demons were crueler than anything else. Even with his strength as an Immemorial Ancient state being, he was left with no other way out than death in face of those Earth Demons.</p><br/><p>Not only would those Earth Demons shred his body to pieces, they would even slurp up his fresh blood. The very thought of that was extremely horrifying.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan gave a calm smile. This feeling of being taken as a Messiah by the masses was simply way too pleasurable!</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing much. We are all from the same sect, and if we can take care of one another, we naturally should.\u201d Lin Fan waved his hands off dismissively while saying coolly.</p><br/><p>Right now, the group was looking at Lin Fan with a different eye. After all, in this world, power reigned supreme. For someone like Junior Brother Lin being so polite and courteous to them even despite being this strong was something that was extremely touching.</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, Junior Brother Lin, you still have to be careful. I don\u2019t suppose that Ling Wuzun is going to let things go just like this.\u201d Hu Qing said worriedly.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s alright. If the soldiers come, fight them\u2026If the river floods, the earth will stop it. If they want to lose face even back in the sect, they can feel free to come at me by all means.\u201d Lin Fan said while chuckling.</p><br/><p>Su Hongchen and the others thought about it for a moment. Even though they were worried in their hearts, since Junior Brother Lin did not put it to heart, they naturally did not continue with that topic.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll head back first.\u201d Lin Fan cupped his fists towards everyone. Right now, he had to head back and fuse this Scarlet Blood Demon Saber into his own treasures.</p><br/><p>The Eternal Axe was already a Legendary Weapon right now. Based on the grading of the Endless Mainland, it could even be considered as an Immortal Weapon.</p><br/><p>However, this Immortal Weapon wasn\u2019t exactly perfect just yet. After all, back in the Ancient Saint World, the Laws of the Heaven and Earth were not fully refined just yet. It was a far cry compared to this Endless Mainland. Therefore, Lin Fan had to continue to put some work into his Eternal Axe.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>After Lin Fan\u2019s departure, Hu Qing spoke up, \u201cLet us go exchange these cores for Contribution Points. Junior Sister Hongchen will then send them over to Junior Brother Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright! Even though these Contribution Points may not be enough to satisfy Junior Brother Lin\u2019s standards, he has just entered the sect after all. There are definitely some places where he could still make use of some Contribution Points.\u201d Su Hongchen replied.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Saint Devil Peak\u2026</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan landed, he realized that Li Qing was already waiting at the entrance.</p><br/><p>Li Qing was an Outer Sect disciple while Lin Fan was an Inner Sect disciple. When he met Lin Fan, he naturally had to address him as senior brother.</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior Brother Lin, you\u2019ve returned!\u201d The moment Li Qing caught sight of Lin Fan, he rushed up to greet immediately.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d Lin Fan looked at Li Qing carefully, not knowing what this was all about. But, when he caught sight of the things in the latter\u2019s hands, he let out a look of surprise.</p><br/><p>Could he be here to deliver items this time around?</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior Brother Lin, this is a \u2018Five Elements Pill\u2019 here for the Five Elements Sword Wills. With this, you will be able to learn it with only half the effort.\u201d Li Qing explained.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan took the pill over in his hands with some suspicion. He was an Inner Sect disciple. How could there be so many benefits?</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is also welfare from the sect?\u201d Lin Fan asked.</p><br/><p>Li Qing nodded his head, \u201cThat\u2019s right. You\u2019re an Inner Sect disciple, senior brother. From time to time, you will receive welfare!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan patted down on Li Qing\u2019s shoulder, \u201cDon\u2019t lie to me, alright? I have a rough idea what an Inner Sect disciple is all about now. There are still Remnants above me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Qing\u2019s face changed slightly before he chuckled out, \u201cSenior Brother Lin, actually, your position should have been as a Remnant. However, there are only ten seats available for Remnants, and there was no availability. Therefore, even though you\u2019re an Inner Sect disciple, you will still receive the same treatment as Remnants should.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, so that\u2019s the case. I see.\u201d When Lin Fan observed Li Qing\u2019s expression, he kind of bought it. Otherwise, who would be silly to such an extent that they would keep sending him so much good stuff?</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you for the troubles then, Junior Brother Li.\u201d Lin Fan replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s no trouble! No trouble at all! If there\u2019s nothing else, your junior brother will take his leave first.\u201d Li Qing waved his hand away at Lin Fan before leaving the Saint Devil Peak.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan held the pill in his hand. Right now, the Five Elements Sword Wills had long been fused by him. Therefore, he naturally had no use for such booster pills anymore.</p><br/><p>However, popping it down would still gain him quite a bit of experience points nevertheless.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan\u2019s heart leaped with joy as he tossed the pill into his mouth.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026Experience Points +3,000,000.\u2019</p><br/><p>Popping pills for experience points growth, this was something that Lin Fan hasn\u2019t experienced for the longest time now. It was because back in the Ancient Saint World, pills could barely give him any experience points.</p><br/><p>But right now, the feeling of having his experience points soar through pills was one that was akin to ascending to the Heavens.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Within the peak\u2026</p><br/><p>Lin Fan sat down cross-legged and took out the Scarlet Blood Demon Saber immediately, then took out the Eternal Axe.</p><br/><p>The Heaven and Earth Smelt came out next.</p><br/><p>BOOM!</p><br/><p>The Heaven and Earth Smelt was Lin Fan\u2019s most tyrannical treasure. A perfect combination of both offense and defense, this was something that was purely overpowered.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis Eternal Axe could be considered as a Lower Grade Immortal Weapon. However, because the Laws of the Immortal Weapon aren\u2019t fully refined, its powers are less than one percent of a normal Lower Grade Immortal Weapon.\u201d</p><br/><p>Refine!</p><br/><p>Lin Fan tossed the Eternal Axe and the Scarlet Blood Demon Saber into the Heaven and Earth Smelt.</p><br/><p>Craft.</p><br/><p>Right now, Lin Fan\u2019s proficiency in crafting weapons was at a pinnacle state, allowing him to draw out the essence of the Scarlet Blood Demon Saber into the Eternal Axe.</p><br/><p>Shing!</p><br/><p>The smelt vibrated slightly.</p><br/><p>The Eternal Axe started giving off a slight aura of an Immortal Weapon. However, because it was in the Heaven and Earth Smelt, the aura naturally did not leak out at all.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026Congratulations on refining success.\u2019</p><br/><p>Lin Fan took out the Eternal Axe as his lips curled into a look of satisfaction. As for that Scarlet Blood Demon Saber, the only thing left of it was some scrap debris. It had basically no function left any longer.</p><br/><p>Eternal Axe.</p><br/><p>Grade: Lower Grade Immortal Weapon.</p><br/><p>Right now, some of the treasures he had with him, such as the Demon City and others, could not evolve at all due to lack of materials.</p><br/><p>However, he knew that he could go searching for some Legendary Items if he had the chance, so that he could raise the levels of all the treasures he had on him.</p><br/><p>By that time, he would truly be domineering.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Poor! Way too poor!</p><br/><p>Lin Fan knew that he was really poor right now. There weren\u2019t many things he could show off from his inventory right now. He did not have any pills or any Legendary Items that were crafted out.</p><br/><p>As for those Shengyang Pills, ever since he arrived at this place, there was practically no f*cking use of them anymore.</p><br/><p>Those Shengyang Pills might have been some decent items back in the Ancient Saint World. But ever since he arrived at this Endless Mainland, it had turned into some inferior product.</p><br/><p>This was angry-worthy, rage-probable, and tears-inducing all at the same time.</p><br/><p>If he wanted to raise his cultivation state, he only had two goals right now.</p><br/><p>First: Killing powerful beings.</p><br/><p>Second: Popping these elixirs.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Lin Fan entered a state of deep thought. Seemed like he had to go out and explore for a bit. Either that, or he would have to go back to his old trade.</p><br/><p>Eventually, Lin Fan thought it through hard and deep.</p><br/><p>Seemed like the best way was still for him to revert to his old trade.</p></div>\n</div>"}

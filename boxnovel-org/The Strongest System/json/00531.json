However, to Gu Zhantian's horror, the red colored brick seemed to be ignoring his defenses entirely as it knocked straight onto the back of his head!</p><br/><p>Even though there wasn't any feeling, his head felt as though it was slammed by a torrent of water, putting him in a daze.</p><br/><p>\"Hmph! You think you can remain standing after receiving Yours Truly's Nine Five Legendary Brick? That's a fool's dream!\" Lin Fan laughed coldly as he slammed down against the head of Gu Zhantian. It had been a long time since the Nine Five Legendary Brick had unleashed its fullest potential.</p><br/><p>Well, it was time to let this so-called commander be the test bed for it then.</p><br/><p>\"H-how could this be?\"</p><br/><p>Gu Zhantian's face was entirely stumped. However, he collapsed with a thud instantly.</p><br/><p>Right now, the other three commanders were still working hard at trying to refine the Heaven and Earth Smelt. However, to think that this thing was so damn tough! Even with their combined forces, they were unable to refine it at all! This was something that was impossible in their eyes.</p><br/><p>\"Not good! Gu Zhantian has fallen!\" Suddenly, the three of them noticed what was happening in the distance as they exclaimed in shock. To think that the human would be able to take down Gu Zhantian!</p><br/><p>Looking at the fainted Gu Zhantian, Lin Fan kept the Nine Five Legendary Brick back into his storage.</p><br/><p>'Slay!'</p><br/><p>Lin Fan did not hesitate at all as he chopped down on Gu Zhantian. As one of the four commanders, his cultivation state was extremely high. After killing this guy, Lin Fan would definitely receive a huge amount of experience points, causing his cultivation state to climb up as well.</p><br/><p>\"STOP\u2026!\" The three commanders howled out in horror at the sight of this. How could they allow Gu Zhantian to be killed by that damned human?</p><br/><p>However, it was all too late. They were way too smitten by the Heaven and Earth Smelt, and were thus too far away from Lin Fan right now.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan slammed down with his Eternal Axe at the fainted Gu Zhantian, who couldn't even resist a single bit in that state.</p><br/><p>'Ding\u2026Congratulations on killing desolate celestial full cultivation being Gu Zhantian.'</p><br/><p>'Ding\u2026Experience points +100,000'</p><br/><p>'Ding\u2026Congratulations on leveling up.'</p><br/><p>'Ding\u2026Cultivation State: Azure celestial full cultivation state.'</p><br/><p>Instantly, Lin Fan could feel a surge of energy rising through his body. This was the boost in power that came with leveling up. This energy was way stronger than anything he had ever experienced before.</p><br/><p>'HAHA!'</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed out maniacally. He could sense an obstruction from the unknowns blocking his way forward. This was the barrier for one to cross if they wanted to turn into a desolate celestial. However, for Lin Fan, something like this could easily be crossed with experience points.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Lin Fan's body was filled with an invincible form of energy. It was as though he could even take down the gods themselves with this.</p><br/><p>\"DAMNED HUMAN! HOW DARE YOU KILL GU ZHANTIAN?\" The first commander, Gu Haitian, howled out in anger as the energy emanating from him turned berserk and wild.</p><br/><p>They had lived together for such a long time, and that too with little differences. So, they naturally shared a deep relationship. To think that Gu Zhantian would be killed by a mere human! How could this not infuriate them?</p><br/><p>Lin Fan ignored the three other commanders as he swept his robes and tossed the body of Gu Zhantian into the Demon City. A desolate celestial full cultivation being... The amount of energy he could harness was definitely going to be amazing. This would definitely be a magnificent booster for Demon City!</p><br/><p>The moment the other ancient race soldiers witnessed one of their four commanders, Gu Zhantian, being slain by the human, they fell into a complete state of shock, as though the entire sky had fallen upon them.</p><br/><p>They could not believe that the seemingly almighty commander in their eyes could have been taken down by a lone human! How could they take in this reality?</p><br/><p>As for the captive beings of the thousands of races, they too were equally astounded.</p><br/><p>Strong! He was way too strong!</p><br/><p>They had never ever met such a strong human being! To think that he could even take down the undefeatable Gu Zhantian!</p><br/><p>\"Long live the human race!\"</p><br/><p>\"Exterminate all the ancient race beings!\"</p><br/><p>\"Hope is here! Finally! WE CAN FINALLY SEE HOPE ONCE MORE\u2026!\"</p><br/><p>The tormented beings of the thousands of races clamored in excitement. All they needed was as savior! And right now, Lin Fan was the Messiah in all of their hearts!</p><br/><p>Lin Fan stepped forth, grabbing out with his hand in a claw-like manner, \"You three are truly fools. Refine the treasure of Yours Truly? Know your place. All I did was to mess around with you guys with a small trick, and I could already distract you this easily. All of you are way too dumb indeed.\"</p><br/><p>The three commanders did not know the meaning of these words. However, in that instance, that Heaven and Earth Smelt, which they thought was almost refined over to their side, began to vibrate violently.</p><br/><p>\"What's going on?\" Gu Haitian slapped it with his palm, infusing a large amount of energy within it, trying to suppress the Heaven and Earth Smelt. However, to his shock, the Heaven and Earth Smelt tore through the void and every single seal in its way, appearing right in front of Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>\"Suppress the treasure of Yours Truly? Really now, fools?\" Lin Fan was extremely proud of his brains right now. Making use of the Heaven and Earth Smelt to block their combined attack gave them the illusion that this was a defensive treasure.</p><br/><p>And indeed, as expected, all four of them fell for the bait. The time taken for the three of them to 'convert' the Heaven and Earth Smelt was more than enough of an opportunity for Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>One on one?</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was never ever afraid of a one on one. Now that he had killed Gu Zhantian, he was at an overwhelming advantage. Not only did he raise his cultivation state, the four of them were now one short. This would make reaping them a way easier task than before.</p><br/><p>\"DAMN IT!\" The three commanders were thoroughly incensed by everything that was happening before them right now. They could not wait to tear Lin Fan up into bits and pieces.</p><br/><p>To think that they could have fallen for the ploys of this human!</p><br/><p>\"HUMAN! I'LL MAKE SURE I KILL YOU TODAY!\" Gu Haitian howled out once more as he tore through the void with massive strides. A multitude of black beams burst forth from behind his back as they pierced through everything and headed in Lin Fan's direction.</p><br/><p>Keeping the Heaven and Earth Smelt in his storage, Lin Fan's eyes shone with disdain.</p><br/><p>This was the time for him to exhibit his true strength.</p><br/><p>So what if he were a desolate celestial full cultivation being? Yours Truly was going to take down everything in his path today and attain that desolate celestial cultivation state as well!</p><br/><p>\"Let us join forces and employ our strongest move to take down this human here and now!\" The second commander, Gu Zhengtian, had his eyes shine with fury. To think that this human would be strong enough to be able to kill Gu Zhantian!</p><br/><p>They would no longer be careless with his cultivation state. Furthermore, the other party was in possession of an utmost defensive treasure!</p><br/><p>However, in the Despair City, they were the gods. No matter who it was that came forth, they must leave their corpses here!</p><br/><p>\"ALRIGHT!\" The third commander, Gu Batian, roared. Waving his arm, he sent a flurry of fists into the void as well.</p><br/><p>'Heaven's Will Enmity Execution!'</p><br/><p>The three commanders joined forces with their ultimate moves, as they summoned the powers of the Heaven's Will as a booster, engaging Lin Fan in a focused onslaught.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Going from the past experience with Monkey Steals Peach, Lin Fan believed \"Hidden Arts\" would likely upgrade at level 20.</p><br/><p>In a single night, he had raised \"Hidden Arts\", which had a max level of three, to level twelve. No one could compete with him.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was overjoyed. He brushed his teeth and prepared to shower his students with love once again today. When Lin Fan headed off towards his class, he overheard some students and teachers discussing yesterday\u2019s incident. Overjoyed, he crept up near them, wanting to hear how they were evaluating him.</p><br/><p>\"The new D class teacher has quite the talent to be able to make Liu Qingfeng\u2019s party face such humiliation. He is a competent person.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was pleased upon hearing these words. As expected, people were praising him. But when he continued listening, he realized something was off.</p><br/><p>\"That new teacher sure doesn\u2019t know how to properly act, forcing Liu Qingfeng\u2019s party to apologize to students. What\u2019s up with that, how are those four suppose to hold up their image in front of their students from now on?\"</p><br/><p>\"Hah, to be able to defeat Liu Qingfeng\u2019s party yet to still be in D class, his strength only should be enough to become a B class teacher.\"</p><br/><p>\"Haha, that\u2019s what you all don\u2019t understand. Some would rather be a chicken\u2019s head than a phoenix's tail. The B class has many hidden dragons, Liu Qingfeng\u2019s party is only considered average. If he goes to B class, he won\u2019t receive as much as attention compared to being in D class.\"</p><br/><p>\"That is quite reasonable, who would\u2019ve thought that person had such plans in his heart.\"</p><br/><p>\"It will be better if you all don\u2019t get too close with that guy. Liu Qingfeng has quite good connections within B class, I heard even the dynasty\u2019s thirteenth prince has a very good relationship with him.\"</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Lin Fan felt that these people were portraying him as some sort of scheming person. How could he let this be?</p><br/><p>\"Everybody, I believe your analysis is wrong.\" Lin Fan then walked over pretending to be part of the people, discussing the same topic.</p><br/><p>\"Oh! Do you perhaps have some inside information?\"The people discussing asked puzzledly.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan\u2019s expression lit up then he began his stream of lies, \"This all started yesterday. I was just casually wondering about inside the school and then happened to see a person standing next to the school\u2019s pond talking to himself. At the time, I thought that person was perhaps trying to commit suicide or something, so I decided to check things out and secretly eavesdropped on him.\"</p><br/><p>\"It was unexpected when I heard the person\u2019s first words which completely shocked me. He was saying how he wasn\u2019t teaching D class for the fame or profit, but instead just wanted to do all he could to bring the lost and wandering D class students back to the right path.\"</p><br/><p>\"Think about it, these D class students suffer ridicule and are ostracized. Their hearts are likely warped, so when they graduate, what do you think they can do?\"Lin Fan looked at a few people and inquired</p><br/><p>\"Those D class students most likely will either just end up as mountain bandits or some other lowlife scum.\" The bystanders frowned slightly and replied.</p><br/><p>\"Correct, if no one is there to guide them, won\u2019t they really just end up going astray? Think about it, the person was able to defeat Liu Qingfeng\u2019s party, so his cultivation base is likely not weak. If he goes to B class, isn\u2019t it likely he will become a well-respected teacher? But instead, he decides to remain in D class and endure the discrimination from other teachers. Just this dedication only is very admiring, don\u2019t you all agree?\"Lin Fan sincerely said this, to the point where it felt like it was actually true.</p><br/><p>These people also began doubting and started feeling ashamed of their previous gossiping.</p><br/><p>\"That analysis seems accurate, it seems this new teacher is perhaps really broad-minded.\"</p><br/><p>\"Shameful, shameful\u2026 The other person is so broad-minded, and we are here talking behind his back, this is really despicable.\"</p><br/><p>\"Thank you, fellow brother, for your intake on the matter. Otherwise, we would\u2019ve misunderstood the new teacher.\"</p><br/><p>Seeing that everyone realized their mistake, Lin Fan also smiled in satisfaction, then waved his hand dismissively, \"No matter, no matter\u2026 Although I am unfamiliar with this righteous, selfless, and forgiving person, I just felt that facts shouldn\u2019t be flipped. If you all are really repenting, then do speak of this to others, as it\u2019s also a good deed for the society.\"</p><br/><p>\"Of course, of course. This kind of thing cannot be miscommunicated. We will definitely notify the others of it.\" A few of the passerby hastily said.</p><br/><p>\"I have other matters, so I will leave now.\" Lin Fan was overjoyed and brought his hands together before leaving. He couldn\u2019t let a good deed he had done be miscommunicated, that would tarnish his reputation.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>As Lin Fan joyfully hummed a tune and walked into class, he realized the thirteen students were all doing their own things and had completely ignored him. Lin Fan slightly frowned, where did all the previous respect for him go?</p><br/><p>\"Ahem\u2026\" Lin Fan pretended to lightly cough a few times.</p><br/><p>As soon as he coughed, the students all jolted, and when they saw their teacher standing at the podium, they all instantly rose and shouted in unison.</p><br/><p>\"Teacher, good morning.\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes, you can sit now.\" Lin Fan nodded and said, \"What were you all doing?I was inside for some time now, did none of you see me?\"</p><br/><p>\"Ah, teacher, when did you come in? I was just looking at the door wondering why teacher still hadn\u2019t arrived yet.\" Liu Shuishui was the only girl in the class and acted very cutely.</p><br/><p>\"Yeah, teacher, we didn\u2019t see you enter at all.\" Cao Tianjiao also felt it was bizarre.</p><br/><p>Then the other students also began agreeing.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was currently confused, \u2018A full person like Yours Truly walks through the door and stands in front of the podium, yet you all couldn\u2019t see me? Are you all perhaps near-sighted?</p><br/><p>Then Lin Fan suddenly remembered he was currently cultivating his \"Hidden Arts\". It seemed the reason his students couldn\u2019t see him was probably due to \"Hidden Arts\". After figuring out the situation, Lin Fan smiled, \"Good morning. Let\u2019s not waste any more time, I will be empowering you all today.\"</p><br/><p>\"Teacher, what do you mean by empowering?\"Zhu You tilted his head and asked.</p><br/><p>\"Yes, this empowering is a unique martial skill of mine. Explaining it is rather difficult, but after you experience it, you will all understand. Alright, Zhu You, let\u2019s use you as an example.\" Lin Fan was too lazy to explain and then continued on dismissively.</p><br/><p>\"Teacher, my name is Zhu Di, not Zhu You.\" Zhu You said with depression, the name change sounded a bit bad.</p><br/><p>\"Hm?\" Lin Fan frowned and he stared straight at Zhu You, as if saying \u2018you dare defy your teacher?\u2019</p><br/><p>Zhu You could only concede, \"Alright teacher, I was wrong.\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes.\" Lin Fan nodded his head in satisfaction, the boy is worth teaching.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Lin Fan had already decided on this time\u2019s empowerment, \u2018Let\u2019s give him \"Titanium Grade Demon Body\".\u2019</p><br/><p>This was a body training skill, and once it reached level three, it\u2019s power would be quite good. Ordinary weapons wouldn\u2019t be able to cause any damage, and once it reached level six, it would jump drastically in strength. People of the same cultivation base would not be able to do any harm.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

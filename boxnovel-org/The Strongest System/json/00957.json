In his eyes, he clearly knew that this cheap disciple of his was extremely extraordinary compared to everyone else. But, back when the Infinite Worlds had fused together and all the other beings of the thousands of races had skyrocketed in terms of cultivation, he had assumed that this cheap disciple of his wouldn\u2019t be able to catch up with the rest of the living beings anymore.</p><br/><p>But, now that they were meeting with one another once more, Feng Qingzi was left entirely speechless. It was only a few short years, but his results were way different even from those who had sat on a rocket and soared above.</p><br/><p>\u201cAverage I suppose. It\u2019s just that there are many utmost powerful beings of the different races right now. Compared to them, I\u2019m still that bit off.\u201d Lin Fan replied, \u201cThat\u2019s right, old man\u2026 why are you alone now? Back in the Guarded Ground, wasn\u2019t there another old man?\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, Lin Fan realized that Feng Qingzi\u2019s expression was slightly dejected.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere have been too many things that happened in the past few years.\u201d Feng Qingzi shook his head slightly as though he did not want to talk about it. The past should just stay in the past.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut you, lad\u2026 you\u2019re quite something, aren\u2019t you? I\u2019m afraid that even if you meet those utmost powerful beings now, you\u2019re not going to fear them anymore, right?\u201d Feng Qingzi was undoubtedly pretty envious at this point. One could truly die from disappointment if they had to keep comparing themselves with others.</p><br/><p>To think that a disciple he had taken in in the past had now turned way more amazing than he was. How was he to raise his head high in the future?</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s nothing much.\u201d Lin Fan waved it off casually as though this was something not worth mentioning at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust a few words of praises and your head gets all big now, eh?\u201d Feng Qingzi rolled his eyes. Everything about this disciple was good except for the fact that he was way too shameless.</p><br/><p>But, when he thought about how this disciple of his was able to stay alive up till now and even raise his cultivation state to such an extent, he supposed that this definitely had something to do with that shameless trait of his.</p><br/><p>\u201cOld man, do you wish to follow along with me?\u201d Lin Fan asked calmly.</p><br/><p>But, when Lin Fan put his words so straightforwardly, Feng Qingzi felt that there was something wrong with it. Since when in the world had there been a Master who followed his disciple? His face then changed, \u201cHmph! Your Master isn\u2019t in a state whereby he needs to follow his disciple.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe! Old man, alright, fine. It doesn\u2019t matter who follows whom between us. Back in the past, you\u2019ve treated me so nicely. No matter what, I\u2019ve got to protect you properly as well. How about we travel together then? This era will be the final era now, and also, I feel like something big is about to change soon. All of those utmost powerful beings might choose to start going all out now.\u201d Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow do you know so much?\u201d Feng Qingzi asked suspiciously. This lad knew a little TOO much, didn\u2019t he? He knew even more than Feng Qingzi himself!</p><br/><p>\u201cWho do you think I am?\u201d Lin Fan smiled confidently while pointing at himself.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe disciple of Feng Qingzi?\u201d Feng Qingzi replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, fine.\u201d Lin Fan was speechless in the face of this. One might as well forget it and just let this old man have his pride for now. After all, the blows that he had received today were pretty huge as well.</p><br/><p>Even though he had that bit of his pride, the blow he received in his heart did not lessen at all, \u201cSince this disciple of mine is so filial, as Your Master, I guess I have no choice but to accept this and go along with you then. I\u2019ll give you the chance to support Your Master so that you can satisfy that filial heart of yours.\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment Lin Fan heard this, he cursed in his heart, \u2018Shameless old man!\u2019</p><br/><p>But soon enough, as though he had thought of something, Lin Fan giggled out, \u201cOld man, let me introduce you to some\u2026companions.\u201d</p><br/><p>Under the bewildered gaze of Feng Qingzi, Lin Fan swept his robes and released Chicken Big and the others.</p><br/><p>\u201cCuckoo! That was so suffocating for Your Chicky!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWoof, woof! What\u2019s going on? What\u2019s the situation?!\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment Chicky and the others came forth, they looked left and right. But, when they caught sight of a single old man standing before them, they got pretty curious.</p><br/><p>\u201cOld man, let me do the introductions. This here is Chicky. This is his son, Chicken Big. And this is his son\u2019s friend, Tai Ritian.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis man here is my Master. He\u2019s old now and feeling lonely in his heart. You guys shall accompany him properly from now on, okay?\u201d Lin Fan said out.</p><br/><p>\u201cCuckcuckoo! So, to think that you\u2019re the Master of my Old Bro! Naturally, I\u2019ll accompany you properly then!\u201d Chicky leaped up onto the head of the old man and plopped down his bum, sitting right on top of Feng Qingzi\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m called Chicky.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chicken Big leaped up onto the left shoulder of Feng Qingzi as well before displaying one of his shiny accessories, \u201cI\u2019m called Chicken Big!\u201d</p><br/><p>Finally, Tai Ritian leaped into Feng Qingzi\u2019s embrace, \u201cWoof, woof! I\u2019m called Tai Ritian!\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Qingzi was stunned right now. What was going on here? Where in the world did all of these strange looking things pop out from?</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan caught sight of this, his lips curled into a grin, \u2018Hehe\u2026 You want to be funny? I\u2019ll let my Great Pet Army go accompany you properly then!\u2019</p><br/><p>Just as Lin Fan was thinking about such stuff, the void suddenly began to tremble.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>All of a sudden, Lin Fan\u2019s face changed as he sensed that something was wrong. This aura\u2026seemed too damned bloody familiar!</p><br/><p>When Feng Qingzi and the others felt this aura, their faces turned pale with fright as well. This aura was way too powerful. This should be an utmost powerful being that was arriving.</p><br/><p>\u201cAll of you go hide within my Paradise first.\u201d Without any hesitation, Lin Fan swept his robes and kept Feng Qingzi and the others into his Paradise immediately. He then looked up at the void warily.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow did you manage to find me?\u201d Right now, Lin Fan was about to curse at someone\u2019s mother. He hadn\u2019t expected the Fire Water Empress to actually arrive here!</p><br/><p>Towards this b*tch, Lin Fan was extremely careful.</p><br/><p>This b*tch was crueler than anyone else, and she especially loved tormenting his \u2018little brother\u2019.</p><br/><p>The events of the previous encounter were still etched deep in his heart. If not for the fact that his battle prowess was pretty formidable, he would have long been sucked up into a dried corpse by the Fire Water Empress!</p><br/><p>But, to Lin Fan\u2019s exasperation, it was as though this Fire Water Empress had planted some tracking device on him! Each time she hunted him down, it seemed unusually easy for her! That was something that was way too horrifying.</p><br/><p>\u201cTo think that the Exclusive Property of Your Empress would have grown to such a state to be able to f*ck over and kill seven utmost powerful beings. That was something pretty startling for Your Empress to find out!\u201d At this moment, a figure appeared between the Heaven and Earth.</p><br/><p>Those robes of Fire and Water fluttered along with the winds as that majestic disposition of an empress shrouded the entire world.</p><br/><p>If this were in the past, Lin Fan might have truly been threatened by the presence of the Fire Water Empress alone. But, things were different now. Lin Fan\u2019s battle prowess was extremely formidable as well. Even if he were to fight an utmost powerful being right now, the odds were seven to three right now.</p><br/><p>To be clear, Lin Fan stood at seven while the other party stood at three.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you looking for me for? You can\u2019t be thinking of wanting to f*ck me again, are you? I\u2019m telling you, I\u2019m extremely malnourished right now! If you f*ck me, there\u2019s a high chance I\u2019m going to die from that!\u201d Lin Fan had long developed a strong sense of resistance towards something like that.</p><br/><p>And. the main reason was because the previous time around had been simply way too savage. To think that he was f*cked continuously for a few years straight. If not for the fact that he had worked hard to strengthen his body and its quality, he might very well barf out even at the sight of the Fire Water Empress alone.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat now? You do not wish to see Your Empress?\u201d The Fire Water Empress barked out. It was as though if Lin Fan dared to reply with a \u2018Yes\u2019, the outcome would definitely involve an endless amount of discipline.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow could this be? Now that you\u2019re here, you have no idea how happy I am!\u201d Lin Fan said against his will.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood.\u201d The Fire Water Empress nodded her head, looked over at him, \u201cYour cultivation state is now enough for you to fight with utmost powerful beings. Then again, you\u2019re the Exclusive Property of Your Empress. Naturally, I will not have you annihilated in this era. This time around, there is going to be a miraculous encounter. Come along with Your Empress.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Fire Water Empress pointed out with her smooth, long finger and caused the void to vibrate. Instantly, Lin Fan could feel as though he was being enveloped by something.</p><br/><p>However, he did not resist at all and allowed the Fire Water Empress to do as she pleased.</p><br/><p>Bloody hell! The weak had no rights! If she said to go, he had to go.</p><br/><p>One fine day, he was definitely going to turn her obedient!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

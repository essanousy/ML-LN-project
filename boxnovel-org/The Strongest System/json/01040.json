If Senior Brother Lin had scolded or whacked them, they might have felt a sense of relief. But now that Senior Brother Lin was expressionless without saying anything to them, it had them feeling extremely panicked.</p><br/><p>\u201cSon, how come there was no news from you for the past three years?\u201d Lin Haoming asked. Even though there was no intention of blaming, he still felt a little grievance in his heart. If there had been some news for the past three years, he wouldn\u2019t have been so worried.</p><br/><p>He naturally knew about the rumors that were spreading outside. However, he did not choose to believe in any of them in his heart. At times, he felt pretty helpless as well. After all, there had not been a single peep from Lin Fan for the past three years! Even if he had wanted to refute those rumors, he had to have some evidence to do so.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled out, \u201cI was training outside and met with some stuff. Hence, I didn\u2019t have the chance to get back at all.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Haoming nodded his head. Anyway, he was in a pretty good mood right now, \u201cSo, that\u2019s the reason. But, you\u2019ve got to watch out, alright? And, come back to check on us often as well!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Lin Fan nodded his head.</p><br/><p>The other seven Family Heads surrounding them were all smiles as they ate and drank without any hesitation. From time to time, their gazes would sweep across the people who were kneeling on the ground right now.</p><br/><p>Huehue!</p><br/><p>Acting tough in front of them and wanting them to be their servants? They could just look where things were now! Now that Young Master Lin was back, no matter how tough these guys wanted to act, they still had to kneel there obediently without daring to make even a single sound!</p><br/><p>However, Lin Fan was the one they were most impressed with. To think that he would have gotten to such a state in just three mere years! This was practically enough to have gods and ghosts crying over!</p><br/><p>Grandmaster Candidate! How incredible was that! In fact, they were even thinking what would happen if the Young Master Lin went on to be the future Grandmaster of the Heaven and Earth Sect one day!</p><br/><p>If he really became the Grandmaster, that would be absolutely outrageous! The entire Lin Family would just skyrocket into the Heavens!</p><br/><p>In fact, even their own families would not lack in terms of the benefits received. The mere thought of that was getting them a little excited right now.</p><br/><p>To think that a tiny little Rising Dragon City could raise the Grandmaster of a big sect! From now on, the Rising Dragon City was going to be famous around the entire Endless Mainland!</p><br/><p>\u201cBig Brother\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, there was a crisp, clean voice coming from outside, seeming to be rushing in quickly.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked over as his lips curled into a grin.</p><br/><p>Lin Lan\u2019er had been in her house, feeling extremely terrible the entire time. The people who had followed her Big Sister home this time around did not make her feel good at all. In fact, she was even detesting them.</p><br/><p>However, the other party was too strong and had a high status. They weren\u2019t people she could afford to offend. Therefore, she ran straight into the house since she would feel no evil if she saw no evil.</p><br/><p>But, after the servants came to inform that the Young Master Lin had returned, it uplifted Lin Lan\u2019er\u2019s mood tremendously.</p><br/><p>Her own Big Brother was home\u2026!</p><br/><p>Lin Lan\u2019er was not the only one who had arrived; there was Lin Feixue as well. And at the same time, Mrs. Lin was also rushing in while feeling exceptionally emotional. After not seeing her own child for the past three years, she was naturally feeling hollow in her heart.</p><br/><p>But when Lin Lan\u2019er entered the house, she was absorbed by the sight before her.</p><br/><p>It was especially eye-catching for Lin Lan\u2019er to see the fella she detested the most, Ning Tiekun, just kneeling down there. That had her feeling pretty bewildered.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Sister.\u201d Lin Fan spoke up, indicating for her to sit down.</p><br/><p>Mrs. Lin and Lin Feixue headed up to ask about Lin Fan as well. Through the conversation he had, Lin Fan felt that it was really quite a nice feeling to have a family at times.</p><br/><p>\u201cBig Brother, what are they doing?\u201d Lin Lan\u2019er asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey\u2019re just wrongdoers.\u201d Lin Fan replied indifferently, totally unbothered with them.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh!\u201d Lin Lan\u2019er nodded her head and let out a bright smile.</p><br/><p>Kneeling there, Ning Tiekun and the others did not feel even a single bit of anger. Their hearts were only filled with fear. They were truly afraid right now.</p><br/><p>Even though he was the son of the Grandmaster of the Metal Sword Sect, the difference between the Metal Sword Sect and the Heaven and Earth Sect was as great as the one between Heaven and Earth themselves. There was no way to compare them at all.</p><br/><p>Not only that, the identity of the other party was that of the Grandmaster Candidate of the Heaven and Earth Sect! Compared to his own status, that was way, way higher!</p><br/><p>The hearts of the three senior sisters of Lin Hanyu were long surging with tidal waves. They could not believe that Junior Sister Lin Hanyu\u2019s younger brother would be this incredible!</p><br/><p>In the past, they naturally knew that Junior Sister Lin Hanyu had a younger brother who had entered the Heaven and Earth Sect. But even then, they did not bother too much about it.</p><br/><p>How big was the Heaven and Earth Sect, and how intense was the competition within it? If one wanted to stand out on top there, it was a task that was more difficult than difficult.</p><br/><p>Even in their small little sect, for example, it was already extremely difficult if one wanted to make a name for themselves, let alone the Heaven and Earth Sect.</p><br/><p>Therefore, they did not get overly concerned with Junior Sister Lin\u2019s younger brother. To them, he was probably just a small nobody in the sect, someone without much of a status.</p><br/><p>But right now, they truly understood the situation. They were totally wrong about everything! Not only did Junior Sister Lin\u2019s younger brother have a status in the sect, his status was one that could even shock people to death!</p><br/><p>Grandmaster Candidate! Even if he headed over to their sect, their own Grandmaster would have to greet him respectfully without daring to get brazen in the slightest bit!</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>When Ning Tiekun looked at how Lin Fan was all smiles toward his family members and the seven Family Heads, he had assumed that the other party must have been appeased by now. This little life of his should be safe.</p><br/><p>But Zhou Jun and Wang Yun felt that things would definitely not end up being so simple.</p><br/><p>How could Senior Brother Lin spare them so easily?</p><br/><p>BAM!</p><br/><p>BAM!</p><br/><p>The thudding sounds of their kowtowing got even louder. That was because in their minds, they could tell that a storm was coming.</p><br/><p>Once Senior Brother Lin and his family were done with their meal, it would perhaps be time for him to lay judgment on them!</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>After some time, Lin Fan placed down the utensils in his hands.</p><br/><p>The other Family Heads were a little high through drinking now, the main reason being that they were absolutely ecstatic. The commoners outside had been waiting for a long time as well, and were getting particularly excited at this moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you guys think Young Master Lin is going to do to these fellas?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got no idea. But, I don\u2019t think that they\u2019ll be let off so easily.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not as though he is going to kill them, right? That man seems to be the son of the Grandmaster of some sect, with quite a distinguished status. No matter how high Young Master Lin\u2019s status in his sect is, he shouldn\u2019t want to kill the other party, should he?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s hard to say.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh? Take a look\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, Lin Fan rose up and walked beside Zhou Jun and Wang Yun.</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior brother! Please spare our lives! We really know that we\u2019re in the wrong now!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Jun and Wang Yun cried out tragically. They were truly afraid, and their heads were still banging down furiously. The sounds were getting even louder, echoing out reverberatingly.</p><br/><p>They could only hope that on account of being in the same sect, Senior Brother Lin would be gracious and spare them this one time.</p><br/><p>At the same time, they bore an intense hatred toward Ning Tiekun right now. If not for this fella, they would not have had something like this happening to them!</p><br/><p>Bloody hell! Even if he wanted to die, why the hell did he have to implicate them?</p><br/><p>To think that he would head over to Senior Brother Lin\u2019s house to act tough! Not only that, he even had Senior Brother Lin\u2019s family members work as his servants! Wasn\u2019t that just bloody looking for death?</p><br/><p>Looking at the three of them, Lin Fan\u2019s lips curled into a grin.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

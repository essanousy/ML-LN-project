To think that we\u2019re outside. But, there\u2019re still quite a number of things I\u2019ve yet to pillage inside!\u201d Lin Fan checked out his surroundings with a pained look on his face. He had just seen some good stuff, but did not manage to timely reap them in. Now that was really tragic!</p><br/><p>Seemed like his luck wasn\u2019t all that good after all.</p><br/><p>Mo Qingxuan looked at Lin Fan with an absolutely strange look on her face. She felt that this person was no human at all. He was way too savage!</p><br/><p>Each time he touched something important in that treasure cache, he would reap it all in immediately. And to think that he wasn\u2019t satisfied even now! If any single item from that treasure cache were to be let out into this world, it would invoke a fight over them amongst countless people!</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked around him, not seeing even a single person nearby, \u201cTime to go. Boring\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Entering the treasure cache this time around, Lin Fan did not come across Qin Shengjun at all. This was an extremely huge treasure cache in a different dimension. But thankfully, Lin Fan\u2019s fortune was good as he encountered the most valuable thing available in the treasure cache, the \u2018Pill\u2019 text character.</p><br/><p>That \u2018Pill\u2019 text character was a treasure that the Immortal King had refined for a long time and was fused with everything from the Pills World. Now that it was gone, the Triple Emperor Heaven Cache was probably not so perfect anymore.</p><br/><p>This was especially the case after the loss of those seven Supreme Grade Immortal Weapons. If even one of them were brought outside and allowed to regain its Laws of the Immortal Dao so that it could unleash its fullest might, it would have been an immensely horrifying scenario. It was even more so considering that it was a set. But, it was a pity that there was no longer a need to discuss about that possibility. Those seven Supreme Grade Immortal Weapons had been eaten up by Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>As for the Legendary Items for crafting weapons, they were naturally precious beyond anything else. Even though Qin Shengjun wasn\u2019t particularly gifted in the crafting of weapons, those Legendary Items were still an astronomical wealth that he could exchange for countless treasures!</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Somewhere else\u2026</p><br/><p>When the Grandmaster Candidates of the Kunlun God Sect caught sight of the situation around them, their pale faces gradually recovered.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust what in the world happened? How are we outside now?\u201d Ancestor Immortal Jiu Li asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior brother, we\u2019ve got no idea what\u2019s going on either. Initially, we had thought that we were going to die there as well. But all of a sudden, we were purged out of that place.\u201d Golden Immortal Qian Kun, Zheng Qiankun, replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat damned Qin Shengjun! To think that he would dare deceive us in order to lure us in there! If not for this sudden power of repulsion, we might have had to fall in there!\u201d On that supremely beautiful face of Fairy Bi Liu was a trace of wrath.</p><br/><p>When they spoke of Qin Shengjun, all three of their gazes went dark. That was an extremely devious fella. If not for the fact that those living beings in there had not managed to cultivate out the Laws of the Immortal Dao, they would not have been able to survive till now.</p><br/><p>\u201cGo. We have to hurry back right now and report this issue over to the Grandmaster. I\u2019m sure all of you must have heard that voice from earlier on as well. Triple Emperor Heaven Cache\u2026 The name of this treasure ground is the Triple Emperor Heaven Cache. Even though I\u2019ve got no idea what that is, I\u2019m sure the Grandmaster and the others must know about it.\u201d Ancestor Immortal Jiu Li said.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright!\u201d The both of them nodded their heads. They were very nearly unable to escape, which was an issue they would remember in their hearts.</p><br/><p>While they were no match for Qin Shengjun, as long as they were to report this matter back to the sect, the sect would definitely avenge them.</p><br/><p>Triple Emperor Heaven Cache\u2026 A single mention of it was enough to tell that it was an extraordinary place. For Qin Shengjun to be in possession of such a treasure cache, were they still going to be able to rest easy against him in the future?</p><br/><p>Pshew!</p><br/><p>The three of their bodies shifted in a flash, preparing to dive into the void and get out of this place. But all of a sudden, the void was sealed up, rendering them unable to leave.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d Ancestor Immortal Jiu Li\u2019s face tensed up as he looked around warily. To think that there would be someone stopping them in their path at this moment!</p><br/><p>But when they made clear who it was, all three of them exclaimed out, \u201cQin Shengjun!\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, Qin Shengjun\u2019s face was looking pretty terrible as though he was deranged. Both of his eyes were bloodshot, seeming like he could just devour anyone alive right now.</p><br/><p>\u201cHand my things over.\u201d Qin Shengjun\u2019s voice was hoarse as though he had just received an immense blow.</p><br/><p>He could not believe that everything that he had left behind from his past life was gone!</p><br/><p>Those seven Supreme Grade Immortal Weapons were gone! That \u2018Pill\u2019 text character that could spill out countless of pills was gone! Even the Legendary Items for crafting weapons that were floating around in his cosmos were gone!</p><br/><p>He was thoroughly crazed right now!</p><br/><p>These were all his wealth which no one was allowed to put their hands on! And this time around, these three fellas were the only other people who had entered the Triple Emperor Heaven Cache with him! Other than them, who else could have taken the treasures away?</p><br/><p>\u201cQin Shengjun! What are you talking about? What items of yours? We took nothing at all!\u201d Ancestor Immortal Jiu Li said.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t take anything? The three of you were the only ones who had entered the Triple Emperor Heaven Cache! If you guys didn\u2019t take it, who did? How dare you bunch of b*stards take away the things inside while I was busy refining the treasure cache! This is my last warning to you\u2026 Hand my things over!\u201d Qin Shengjun barked out angrily.</p><br/><p>This Triple Emperor Heaven Cache was extremely important to him, especially that \u2018Pill\u2019 text character, which was more important than anything else. Now that all of those precious items were gone, how could he not get worried and flustered?</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t accuse us out of thin air! The three of us were scammed by you and led into that endless pit of living beings, almost getting killed by them! And now, you\u2019re here demanding items from us? Qin Shengjun ah, Qin Shengjun! Is that the disposition that someone who is the strongest in the God Essence Sect should act with?\u201d Zheng Qiankun spoke up.</p><br/><p>They were harboring a belly of rage as well. Not only did they not manage to find anything in that treasure cache, they were hassled by those living beings and had nearly lost their lives! And now, one should look at this Qin Shengjun who was here trying to demand his items from them? Could he get any more shameless than this?</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is a limit to my tolerance. Don\u2019t force me to make a move against you guys.\u201d Qin Shengjun snarled out as his eyes revealed his killing intent. It was as though he would definitely slaughter the three of them if they did not hand over the items.</p><br/><p>He had been searching in the Triple Emperor Heaven Cache for a long time, yet he could not find any of that stuff. All of his hopes were extinguished at that moment.</p><br/><p>He was even starting to regret why he had to bring these three along with him. If not for the fact that he was too hurried and required the Kunlun God Fire of the Kunlun God Sect to refine his unparalleled mystic skill, nothing as such would have happened!</p><br/><p>Even if he did not refine his unparalleled mystic skill back then, as long as he were to obtain the pills in the Triple Emperor Heaven Cache, he would definitely have been able to skyrocket and become a peak existence!</p><br/><p>But right now, he had nothing left. All the most important treasures in his treasure cache were gone! This was a huge blow for Qin Shengjun.</p><br/><p>Even though Ancestor Immortal Jiu Li and the other two were afraid of him, they hollered out at this moment, \u201cDon\u2019t you get overboard now!\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Shengjun roared out in laughter, an extremely deranged laughter, \u201cGood! Since that\u2019s the case, I shall have all of you taken down now!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot good\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, Qin Shengjun struck suddenly. Sweeping out with a palm strike, he slammed it out at the three of them.</p><br/><p>More than ten years ago, Qin Shengjun was the number one on the True Immortal Substitute Roll, someone who could even kill True Immortal state beings. After so many years had passed now, no one even knew what extent his cultivation state had reached.</p><br/><p>But at the moment when Qin Shengjun struck out, his berserk powers burst out and pushed at them. Their hearts suddenly froze up! To think that they couldn\u2019t even summon the strength to resist him!</p><br/><p>\u201cHow dare you take the items of me, Qin Shengjun! All of you shall die!\u201d Qin Shengjun was enraged right now. For the sake of the items in the Triple Emperor Heaven Cache, he was giving it his all. Even if he were to rouse the anger of the entire Kunlun God Sect, it did not matter to him anymore.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

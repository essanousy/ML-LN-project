Click, And You Shall Receive.</p><br/><p>Translator: Lam_ Editor: Hitesh_</p><br/><p>So, this was the true form of the Colossal Dragon. It was truly imposing indeed! Compared to the manifestation of the members of the Dragon race, there was a world of difference.</p><br/><p>Based on the current situation, the Dragon race had an inseparable connection with the Colossal Dragon race. However, Lin Fan supposed that the Dragon race should be an offspring of the beings of the Colossal Dragon race breeding with some other race out there.</p><br/><p>Intrinsically, the cultivation of the Colossal Dragon race was greater. Therefore, the Colossal Dragons that were metamorphosed from them had way larger true bodies as well.</p><br/><p>Even though the Dragon race could metamorphose into Colossal Dragons as well, their body frames were smaller in comparison.</p><br/><p>At this moment, two gigantic Colossal Dragons spanning hundreds of thousands feet long floated in the sky above Lin Fan. Their dragon whiskers were thin and long, as though they were infiltrating the void itself, collecting energy from within it to replenish their personal energy.</p><br/><p>There was a sense of berserkness hidden within those blood red eyes. It was especially evident when they were looking at Lin Fan, as though they could not wait to shred this man into pieces.</p><br/><p>\"Damned human! Your death is here! Once someone from the Colossal Dragon race transforms into a Colossal Dragon, their strength would increase even further!\" The Tenth Prince remarked coldly.</p><br/><p>For him, unless he was pushed to the edge and had no other choice, he would never revert to his true form as a Colossal Dragon. After all, that was way too hideous a sight.</p><br/><p>Instantly, the two gigantic Colossal Dragons opened their mouths. From within shot out countless crystal shards.</p><br/><p>Each of these crystal shards were akin to the size of a mountain on their own, containing a massive amount of power within.</p><br/><p>\"Seems like things are getting a little troublesome.\" Lin Fan could not help but tense up a little after sensing the amount of power being emanated from those two Colossal Dragons.</p><br/><p>Indeed, it was every bit as the Tenth Prince had described. Ever since they turned into Colossal Dragons, their strength had increased by multiple folds.</p><br/><p>Based on his current strength, Lin Fan could challenge someone of a Divine celestial level 8, Universal Elixir state.</p><br/><p>The skill that was cultivated by Long Yushen and Long Tiangang was one of the three heaven revolting skills of the Colossal Dragon race. Compared to any other Universal Elixir state beings out there, they were way stronger.</p><br/><p>However, even if that were the case, Lin Fan wasn't afraid at all.</p><br/><p>\"Hmph! Insignificant tricks.\" Lin Fan spread his palms wide open. Instantly, they encompassed the entire sky. His outstretched fingers were like heavenly pillars that grasped out at these crystal shards.</p><br/><p>\"HAHA! Foolish fella! You're courting death by doing that. That's the Dragon Qi! Do you really think that you can withstand that with your mere flesh and blood?\" The Tenth Prince laughed out manically. He realized that this human was simply way too dumb!</p><br/><p>Crack.</p><br/><p>However, the next scene that followed was startling to one's heart.</p><br/><p>That gigantic hand was so large it seemed as though it could cover the entire sky. The moment those crystal shards made contact with it, they began to break apart until they disintegrated into nothingness.</p><br/><p>\"HOW COULD THIS BE?\" The Tenth Prince was utterly shocked right now. He could not believe everything that was happening right now.</p><br/><p>Given his current physical body state, Lin Fan was that of Divine celestial level 8, Universal Elixir state being. There was nothing that could break his body apart at all. No matter how strong this Long Yushen and Long Tiangang were, their cultivation states were still that of Divine celestial level 8, Universal Elixir state no matter what.</p><br/><p>\"This human is so strong! If it were us, we might have been annihilated long ago!\" The members of the Phoenix race called out in astonishment. They could sense the boundless power being emanated out from every single crystal shard.</p><br/><p>Even though they were laughing at the start, each and every single one of them knew that the Ancestor Dragon's Reincarnation was an extremely strong skill with unparalleled power.</p><br/><p>Each time they reincarnated, their powers would increase by hundred percent.</p><br/><p>If that weren't the case, the Dragon God couldn't have caused the Ancient race to retreat in defeat and suppress all the other races with just a portion of his strength. That alone brought the Colossal Dragon race up into one of the Top ten Old Ancient Beast races.</p><br/><p>And that feat couldn't have been possible without the Ancestor Dragon's Reincarnation.</p><br/><p>\"Your cultivation states are pretty decent indeed. However, it's still too far off. Today, Your Motherf*cking King is going to let you guys know what true strength means.\"</p><br/><p>\"Twisting Heaven and Earth! Reversing Yin and Yang!\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan floated in the void gently, his long hair dancing in the breeze. Slapping out with his palm, a boundless amount of energy erupted forth. Yin and Yang were mixed up, as though energy of the entire world was brought forth with it.</p><br/><p>\"T-this is\u2026!\" Sensing the changes in his surroundings, the face of the Tenth Prince changed.</p><br/><p>\"This is\u2026changing the energy of the natural order!\" The Tenth Prince revealed a look of horror. To think that this human would have such powers up his sleeves!</p><br/><p>At its very primitive state, Twisting Heaven and Earth came from Monkey Steals Peaches. Under Lin Fan's tireless efforts, it managed to evolve, and eventually transformed into this formidably strong Twisting Heaven and Earth.</p><br/><p>Carrying with it the powers of Yin and Yang, he could interchange them with the flip of his hand.</p><br/><p>Now, the skill that Long Yushen and Long Tiangang were cultivating was the Ancient Dragon's Reincarnation, something that would change the course of Yin and Yang, causing the powers within their bodies to be entirely mixed up.</p><br/><p>At this moment, the faces of Long Yushen and Long Tiangang changed entirely. They had realized that the powers within their bodies were going into dissonance.</p><br/><p>The Qi of Yin and Yang were getting disordered. Suddenly, they wailed out in pain as that gigantic body that was hundreds of thousands feet long started contorting.</p><br/><p>\"JUST WHAT HAVE YOU DONE? DAMN IT!\" The two voices roared out in anguish as a gigantic dragon's claw tore through the void out at Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>\"Dragon Slayer Saber. Click and you shall receive. System, do you want to send it to me?\" Lin Fan laughed indifferently and muttered out for fun.</p><br/><p>\"Send!\"</p><br/><p>\"Eh?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was stunned and helpless at the reply of the system. Pointing out with his finger, countless skills appeared out. In the blink of an eye, all the innumerable Skill Gods flew out of it. Every single last bit of power that he possessed were contained within this finger.</p><br/><p>\"This single finger of mine can tear through anything in this world.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan's figure shifted nimbly. Pointing out with his finger, he dotted at the claw of the dragon.</p><br/><p>Creak.</p><br/><p>The sky changed color instantly as the void began to rupture out explosively. This was Lin Fan's epiphany towards all the skills that he had learned thus far in his path of cultivation.</p><br/><p>Using pure power to break through every single skill out there... Within this single finger was his life's worth of learning.</p><br/><p>Even though this finger of Lin Fan looked extremely plain and simple, it brought with it a boundless amount of energy that tore the void apart.</p><br/><p>That dragon's claw which was grabbing over from the void began to shred apart like a piece of mere paper.</p><br/><p>For a Universal Elixir state powerful being, every single portion of their bodies would possess an immense amount of power. And under the tremendous might brought forth by these dragon's claws, they were formed of nothing but power in its purest form.</p><br/><p>\"I-impossible! Just who in the world are you?\" Long Yushen and Long Tiangang had not expected that they could possibly lose. And to think that the loss would be so decisive!</p><br/><p>\"Human! Just who in the world are you?\" The two Colossal Dragons lashed out. Under a miraculous encounter, both of them had managed to enter the second cycle of the Ancient Dragon's Reincarnation. Therefore, they were ever more confident towards their own capabilities.</p><br/><p>To think that they would be defeated this quickly at this point!</p><br/><p>\"Remember now, boys. The one who killed you guys is none other than the Motherf*cking Human King, Lin Fan.\" Lin Fan tossed his robes back and slammed out with his palm strike.</p><br/><p>\"Heaven and Earth's Yin and Yang! Go wreak havoc!\"</p><br/><p>BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!</p><br/><p>Suddenly, the Qi of Yin and Yang in the world went entirely insane. Long Yushen and Long Tiangang began to howl out in pain once more. That hundreds of thousands of feet long body of theirs began to expand rapidly, as though something was going berserk within them.</p><br/><p>BAM!</p><br/><p>A loud explosion rang out between the entire place.</p><br/><p>\"N-NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO\u2026!!!\" Looking at the sight before him, the Tenth Prince was entirely stumped. Those fighters of his that were supposed to be rising and strong from this point forth were dead just like that!</p><br/><p>'Ding\u2026Congratulations on killing Divine celestial level 8, Universal Elixir state Colossal Dragon race being.'</p><br/><p>'Ding\u2026Experience points +\u2026'</p><br/><p>'Ding\u2026Congratulations on killing Divine celestial level 8, Universal Elixir state Colossal Dragon race being.'</p><br/><p>'Ding\u2026Congratulations.

What a harvest this was! Gigantic harvest!</p><br/><p>Absorb!</p><br/><p>Instantly, everything that belonged to the two Colossal Dragons was sucked into Lin Fan's Paradise.</p><br/><p>'Ding\u2026Dragon Slayer Saber.

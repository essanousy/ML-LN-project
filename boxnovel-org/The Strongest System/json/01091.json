But ever since the Heavenly Lords disappeared, Immortal Kings could only stop at this end.</p><br/><p>There was a jet black ocean, with no ends in sight. This gigantic black ocean was extremely still and eerily silent. There were no waves on the water surface, as though everything had solidified. The skies above the ocean were pitch black, with ominously dark clouds, the same color as the ocean itself. This entire place reeked of death.</p><br/><p>Within all the major sects in the Endless Mainland were records of this place, which was called the Ocean of Death. There had once been a number of powerful beings who had wanted to head over to the ends of it to check it out. However, it was a one way trip for all of them \u2014 they were never seen ever again.</p><br/><p>At this moment, on this vast and boundless Ocean of Death appeared a few spots of light. These few spots emitted a faint glow. If one hadn\u2019t been looking carefully, they wouldn\u2019t even have been able to make them out.</p><br/><p>BOOM!</p><br/><p>Lightning flashed and thunder crackled endlessly while the light spots approached. Gradually, a few colossal black objects came into view. All of those colossal black objects had black thunderbolts coiling around their bodies, tugging at them. They seemed to be trying to break free from it.</p><br/><p>By the time they were finally close enough, those three colossal objects actually turned out to be three humongous ships! The front of those ships had the head of a mysterious beast perched on it, one that looked absolutely frightening. The eyes of those Colossal Beasts were blood red, and they gave off a vile, sinister aura. However, there were no records of such Colossal Beasts ever existing on the Endless Mainland.</p><br/><p>The three colossal ships came to a rest at the beachside. The bodies of those ships were extremely derelict and tattered, looking as though they had been through an absolutely destructive wreck. But even then, they still completed their duty of arriving at this place.</p><br/><p>A few days later\u2026</p><br/><p>The colossal ships started moving as a series of figures appeared on them. As every figure stood on top of those colossal ships, they looked at everything before them and entered a deep contemplative state.</p><br/><p>\u201cHAHAHA\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>All of a sudden, a crazed howl reverberated throughout the skies. That voice was absolutely horrifying, and filled with a trace of madness.</p><br/><p>On the middle colossal ship stood an extremely tall figure. Protected by his black armor and wielding a gigantic sword in his hand, he looked like the most sinister Evil God in the entire universe. Leering down on the rest of the world, he spoke out softly, yet his voice caused the entire void to explode.</p><br/><p>\u201cSeems like everything was real. The Indigenous Lands! The Oracle left down by the Master of Chaos did not deceive us!\u201d The gigantic figure roared out with his deranged laughter.</p><br/><p>\u201cLord Aide of the God of War, we have been asleep for 10,000 years this time around. Three of our God\u2019s Arks are damaged.\u201d A servant reported while kneeling on the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh! I hadn\u2019t expected for it to be this long, such that even the God\u2019s Arks are damaged. Forget it! Set up the Dimensional Portal. Now that we\u2019ve discovered such a piece of Indigenous Land, we must definitely conquer it.\u201d The Aide of the God of War spoke up.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Lord.\u201d</p><br/><p>That servant stood up and immediately surveyed his surroundings left and right. Finally, he caught sight of a slightly secluded place where he took out a couple of weird looking crystals. His lips twitched slightly as though he was chanting out some incantation. All of a sudden, those crystals burst out and floated up before forming a hexagram formation that was imprinted right onto the Ocean of Death.</p><br/><p>\u201cLord, I\u2019ve set it up.\u201d The servant reported politely.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, very good! The Master of Chaos was the only other person who had stepped foot onto this Indigenous Land! I, Aide of the God of War, Xi Ousi, SHALL BE THE SECOND ONE! ALL HANDS, GATHER! CLEAN UP THE ENTIRE PLACE IN A RADIUS OF 10,000 MILES FROM HERE!\u201d Xi Ousi rallied.</p><br/><p>\u201cYES!\u201d</p><br/><p>Countless mysterious living beings wearing that same pitch black armor swarmed down from those three gigantic God\u2019s Arks, pushing forward with a formidable might.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Heaven and Earth Sect\u2026</p><br/><p>Lin Fan opened his eyes wide. After the hard work he had done to get himself rocketing sky high just by popping pills, he had gained quite a large amount of experience points. Right now, he wasn\u2019t all that far from the Immortal King state.</p><br/><p>However, from this day forth, he might most probably not be able to pop down pills anymore, and was left with only killing others to level up.</p><br/><p>Using the Weapon Crafting Legendary Materials he had obtained from the Senior Old Masters of the Kunlun God Sect, Lin Fan had them all crafted into Immortal Weapons as well. However, to Lin Fan\u2019s disappointment, there wasn\u2019t even a single Special Item in there. That was truly extremely disappointing.</p><br/><p>But, oh well, one might as well forget it then. If he didn\u2019t craft out any, so be it then. There were more chances to come in the future anyway.</p><br/><p>Shing!</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Lin Fan felt his heart jerk. This was an extremely ominous sign. This was\u2026!</p><br/><p>All of a sudden, he bolted right up. Cleaving open the void, he dove right into them.</p><br/><p>The feeling earlier on was caused by the feedback from one of the Legendary Weapons he had created.</p><br/><p>That was a Legendary Weapon he had given to Lin Hanyu.</p><br/><p>If there were a feedback, she must naturally be in danger.</p><br/><p>Without any hesitation, Lin Fan bolted right over in that direction.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Hundred Flower Sect\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cJust what in the world are they?! How are all their moves so weird?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got no idea! These aren\u2019t any normal powers at all! Not only that, their speed is extremely swift! All of them are masters of the Sword Dao!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTheir strength is crazy explosive! There\u2019s no way we can hold out against them!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTo think that even the armor that they are wearing can have offensive capabilities! Earlier on, Junior Sister Hua landed a palm strike on them, but who knew that her entire palm would be minced away by the armor itself!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>As those female disciples of the Hundred Flower Sect looked at these horrendous creatures before them, all of their faces were filled with fright and terror.</p><br/><p>And that this moment, the Grandmaster of the Hundred Flower Sect was engaged in a duel with that gigantic figure.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot bad, not bad! You have quite a good figure\u2026Befitting of being one of my, Xi Ousi\u2019s slaves!\u201d Xi Ousi burst out in wild laughter as that gigantic sword he wielded cleaved out right at the Grandmaster of the Hundred Flower Sect.</p><br/><p>There were seven mysterious gemstones embedded into that gigantic sword. Each time he waved it, those gemstones would sparkle with a dazzling brilliance. Be it in terms of speed or strength, they were all enhanced.</p><br/><p>Not only that, the gigantic sword brought with it fire, lightning, and all sorts of other powers.</p><br/><p>When it got closer, one could even feel the scorching blaze emanating from it.</p><br/><p>Right now, the Grandmaster of the Hundred Flower Sect was having an extremely tough fight as she glared at the person before her in a furious rage, \u201cJust who in the world are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xi Ousi roared out in laughter before his face turned stern, \u201cListen up! I am Xi Ousi, one of the seventy two Aides under the command of the great Master God of War! All of you Indigenous Beings had better lay down and surrender right now! Otherwise, you shall all die\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Grandmaster of the Hundred Flower Sect was bewildered in her heart. She had no idea at all who these people were!</p><br/><p>Who in the world was this Master God of War? What was up with this seventy two Aides and whatnot as well?</p><br/><p>Furthermore, all the names sounded extremely weird. She hadn\u2019t even heard any of them before!</p><br/><p>\u201cHundred Flowers Appearance!\u201d</p><br/><p>Taking a step forward, the Grandmaster of the Hundred Flower Sect waved out her palm and unleashed an unparalleled mystic skill.</p><br/><p>When Xi Ousi caught sight of everything before him, he could only let out a cold laugh, \u201cHmph! Since you don\u2019t know what\u2019s good for you, you can just go to hell then!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018God Technique \u2013 Slaying Doom!\u2019</p><br/><p>At that moment, Xi Ousi\u2019s body burst forth with a golden aura as he slammed down the gigantic sword in his hand, digging it right into the Earth and cleaving it apart with a mighty force.</p><br/><p>Thunder!</p><br/><p>Flames!</p><br/><p>All of those supernatural powers wrapped around the gigantic sword, generating a boost to its current status!</p><br/><p>The Grandmaster of the Hundred Flower Sect felt her heart skip a beat as that unparalleled mystic skill of hers was destroyed entirely by the other party. The strength of this man before her was similar to hers, yet that gigantic sword he wielded was helping him boost his powers by a significant amount, rendering her entirely powerless!</p><br/><p>Urgh!</p><br/><p>The Grandmaster of the Hundred Flower Sect spat out a mouthful of fresh blood as her face was drained from all color.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cGrandmaster, you\u2019re not dead, right?!\u201d Lin Hanyu rushed forward immediately and supported her Grandmaster. If she had not been depending on that Immortal Weapon that her younger brother had given her, she would not have been much better off either.</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha! How about now?\u201d When Xi Ousi looked down at those ants, he could not help but roar out in a maddened laughter.</p><br/><p>He, Xi Ousi, was THE greatest existence.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m alright, but these people are way too strong. The weapons that they are wielding are way too sinister as well.\u201d The Grandmaster of the Hundred Flower Sect exclaimed.</p><br/><p>Lin Hanyu was getting flustered right now as well. She too was starting to realize that these guys were well versed in combat. The gigantic sword in their hands seemed as though they could slice through every single thing out there. At the same time, they brought with them some supernatural strength that had the defenders completely powerless against them.</p><br/><p>\u201cAll of you Indigenous Beings\u2026 If you don\u2019t wish to die, you had all better kneel down obediently.\u201d Xi Ousi said with authority. With the gigantic sword in his hand vibrating, everyone felt their hearts clenching.</p><br/><p>\u201cDream on!\u201d Lin Hanyu yelled out.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph! Then death is the only path that awaits you.\u201d Xi Ousi roared out as he sliced down with that gigantic sword of his once more.</p><br/><p>When Lin Hanyu and the Grandmaster of the Hundred Flower Sect caught sight of this, their hearts skipped a beat.</p><br/><p>Clang!</p><br/><p>\u201cSeems like I\u2019ve still managed to get here in time.\u201d</p><br/><p>All of a sudden, a figure floated out between the Heaven and Earth, grabbing that gigantic sword with a single hand. When Lin Hanyu caught sight of the person who had arrived, she called out emotionally, \u201cLittle Bro\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, Lin Fan froze as well. He had a bloody strange feeling after grabbing hold of that sword.</p></div>\n</div>"}

He then remarked with an exaggerated expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior, even though you have been sealed here for dozens of thousands of years, you did not give up on yourself. Not only that, you are even doing your best to help us juniors! For that, your junior here couldn\u2019t be any more grateful! If I were to become a powerful being out in the world someday, no matter what, I will definitely rescue you out, senior! At the same time, I will head with you to seek out that Boundless Future Buddha Lord, senior!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood! Your Ancestor has truly not made the wrong judgment on you. This is a mystic skill of the Buddha race, something that the Boundless Future Buddha Lord had once cultivated himself. Within the Buddha race, this is ranked number one. If you are to cultivate this to its maximum extent, you can turn into the Infinite Buddha Ancestor and suppress the entire world!\u201d The Selfless Demon Ancestor said before a jade bamboo scroll flew out of the mountain range, landing before Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan held the jade bamboo scroll in his hands.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026Discovered counterfeit product. Unable to cultivate.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Motherf*cking hell! Even if you were to give me a counterfeit product, Your Daddy would have to give it to you. But bloody hell, a counterfeit that couldn\u2019t even be used to cultivate? What the f*ck do you want? Trying to f*ck the Heavens?\u2019 Lin Fan cussed out in his heart. However, his expression was still grateful as ever.</p><br/><p>He then let out a face as though he had just received an Utmost Treasure and could not wait to unroll that jade bamboo scroll, wanting to learn the supreme mystic skill within. However, his face changed slightly after.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow could this be?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior, your junior here is unable to cultivate it!\u201d Lin Fan raised his head while saying.</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha\u2026 Don\u2019t get anxious now. That is the number one mystic skill in the Buddha race after all. It isn\u2019t something that is so easily cultivated. To cultivate this mystic skill, you are required to possess the Spirit of the Buddha race. As for that Spirit of the Buddha race, that is something that only the Boundless Future Buddha Lord has. However, Your Ancestor here has a pill that can allow the future generations to possess their own Spirit of Buddha race. Now, this Spirit of Buddha race is something that\u2019s far from ordinary. Not only can you start cultivating this number one mystic skill of the Buddha race, it will raise your level of comprehension by an infinite degree. From this point forth, there shall be no mystic skills in this world that can pose any trouble to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Selfless Demon Ancestor chuckled out as a pill floated out of the mountain range. It emitted an extremely dense Buddhist light. There were even groups of Buddhas chanting out scriptures within the Buddha light, looking as though this was the Buddha race coming home.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy thanks, senior!\u201d Lin Fan let out a look of extreme glee as he held the pill in his hands.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026Discovered Selfless Heaven Demon Pill.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Selfless Heaven Demon Pill: Using the Essence Blood of the Selfless Demon Ancestor as a lure, after consumption, one shall be controlled by the Selfless Demon Ancestor.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018After consumption, one can gain 50,000,000 experience points.\u2019</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was just helpless in his heart right now. Couldn\u2019t there be some form of trust and credibility between beings anymore?</p><br/><p>Were all powerful beings with some age to them so crafty and cunning?</p><br/><p>If not for his System, who knew how many times he would have been scammed by others by now.</p><br/><p>Bloody hell! This was truly no good thing. This bloody Selfless Demon Ancestor totally deserved to be suppressed here.</p><br/><p>But, since he had started the act, he must go through with it to the end. Lin Fan wanted to see just what else this Selfless Demon Ancestor could do.</p><br/><p>However, those 50,000,000 experience points were pretty decent indeed. Pleasurable!</p><br/><p>\u201cAs long as you consume this pill, you will be able to cultivate that supreme mystic skill of the Buddha race!\u201d The Selfless Demon Ancestor said.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the Selfless Demon Ancestor with his tears about to flow out right now, \u201cSenior! Your grace and mercy to me is something that this junior will remember for the rest of his life! To think that you would even give me a pill of this sort! This junior doesn\u2019t even know what else to say anymore!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Selfless Demon Ancestor laughed out softly, \u201cConsume it then. If you cultivate here, no one will disturb you. It\u2019s all because Your Ancestor can tell that you have a resolute and firm heart along with an innocent and pure nature. If it were any vile and evildoing junior, Your Ancestor would not bother with him at all.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded his head. He wasn\u2019t going to talk anymore and just pop it down. Since this guy has already said it as such, what else was there to even talk about?</p><br/><p>As he consumed that Demon Pill into his belly, Lin Fan\u2019s life was still his and not anyone else\u2019s.</p><br/><p>Crunch, chomp, munch!</p><br/><p>Fragrant and aromatic!</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026Experience Points +50,000,000.\u2019</p><br/><p>When the Selfless Demon Ancestor saw how that lad had consumed the pill, he could not help but roar out in laughter, \u201cHahahaha\u2026! HAHAHAHA\u2026!!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior, what are you laughing about?\u201d Lin Fan blinked his eyes and asked out.</p><br/><p>Cough, cough!</p><br/><p>All of a sudden, the Selfless Demon Ancestor started coughing as though he had just discovered something absolutely outrageous. His voice was even filled with some astonishment.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you feel anything?\u201d The Selfless Demon Ancestor asked.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shook his head, \u201cNot really. I just feel my stomach being a little warm right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Selfless Demon Ancestor was taken aback as though he could not come to terms with it. Stomach a little warm? That couldn\u2019t be right!</p><br/><p>At this moment, Lin Fan took up the jade bamboo scroll and took a look once more before showing a dismal face, \u201cSenior! I still don\u2019t get it!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Selfless Demon Ancestor was startled. This couldn\u2019t be! That was a pill cultivated using his life\u2019s Essence Blood! How could it fail? Right! It must be because the medicinal power wasn\u2019t strong enough! The Essence Blood was where his source was at. Expending that single drop meant that he had lost a hundred years of his powers.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle fella, don\u2019t worry now. I think that pill didn\u2019t have enough medicinal powers to it. Your Ancestor has another pill here.\u201d The Selfless Demon Ancestor said.</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior, how could that do? I\u2019ve already wasted one of your pills earlier on!\u201d Lin Fan let out an embarrassed expression while saying that. He then started mumbling to himself, \u201cSigh! Seems like it\u2019s also a crime to have an innate potential that\u2019s way too superb at times. For anyone else, one pill might have been enough. But for me, it\u2019s far from enough.\u201d</p><br/><p>When the Selfless Demon Ancestor heard these words, he felt his heart skip a beat. Through the seal, he then took a closer look. Yet, he discovered that he could not even tell of this lad\u2019s innate potential!</p><br/><p>At this moment, the Selfless Demon Ancestor was starting to get excited. Gritting his teeth, he brought out yet another drop of Essence Blood and infused it into the pill.</p><br/><p>Pshew!</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is another pill. Consume this instead!\u201d Even though the Selfless Demon Ancestor was slightly pained in his heart, he felt that everything was all worth it right now.</p><br/><p>Using his consciousness to penetrate through the void, he had been entering the dreams of the Demon Sect disciples through their Seven Emotions and Six Worldly Desires to impart mystic skills to them.</p><br/><p>As long as they were to use those mystic skills imparted by him to kill their enemies, it would then turn their opponent\u2019s Essence, Spirit and Vitality into an Essence Pill. After a year, they would use that to pay respects to him.</p><br/><p>This was an affair that had lasted for many years now. With that, the Selfless Demon Ancestor\u2019s cultivation state had been recovering gradually as well. As long as it were to reach a certain degree, he could then abandon this physical body of his and deploy an unrivaled mystic skill to break through the seal and achieve reincarnation.</p><br/><p>By then, he would be able to come up with a plan to break through this seal and retrieve his physical body from it.</p><br/><p>This time around, it was already supposed to be the most fortuitous time for him to do so. But, discovering an abnormality such as Lin Fan had the Selfless Demon Ancestor feeling additionally intrigued.</p><br/><p>The fact that he had found this abnormality with such a high innate potential caused his mind to whirl with plans.</p><br/><p>If this were truly high enough, he COULD abandon that Selfless Demon Body of his.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan took the pill in his hands and popped it down with satisfaction.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026Experience Points +50,000,000.\u2019</p><br/><p>Holy f*ck! This was so darned pleasurable!</p><br/><p>\u201cHow is it?\u201d The Selfless Demon Ancestor asked once more.</p><br/><p>\u201cI still don\u2019t get it!\u201d Lin Fan raised his head while crying out.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow could this be?\u201d The Selfless Demon Ancestor was dumbfounded right now. Just what in the world was up with this guy?! How could nothing be working now that he had already taken two pills into his tummy?</p><br/><p>This couldn\u2019t be! It just didn\u2019t make any sense!</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior, I\u2019ve already told you, my innate potential is special. These pills just aren\u2019t enough.\u201d Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ve got more here!\u201d The Selfless Demon Ancestor refused to believe that this wouldn\u2019t work as he spat out yet another mouthful of Essence Blood and begin fusing.</p><br/><p>Even though Lin Fan\u2019s face was exasperated, his heart was filled with happiness like a blossoming flower.</p><br/><p>This was a mother*cking braindead f*ck!</p><br/><p>The strength of this Demon Ancestor was outrageous indeed. Just his Essence Blood alone could raise Lin Fan\u2019s experience points by this much! This was even more tyrannical than Immortal Pills!</p><br/><p>\u201cAgain\u2026!\u201d The Selfless Demon Ancestor spoke up.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

It would be so great if he could have more medicinal pills; that way, he could just rely on eating medicine to become invincible.</p><br/><p>After checking through the bag, he couldn\u2019t find any more medicinal pills, so Lin Fan switched his focus onto the martial skills.</p><br/><p>He remembered seeing several manuals earlier and wondered what kind of martial skills they contained.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan didn\u2019t expect much from Mo Yi Xuan, as he didn\u2019t seem to be a good person. So the martial skills he possessed were most likely useless.</p><br/><p>But Lin Fan repented quickly. He shouldn\u2019t be so discriminating as a person. Although Mo Yi Xuan wasn\u2019t a really great person, he was still able to become that strong, so his martial skills should be sufficient.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan took out a manual as he glanced through it, and smiled.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026 congratulations, discovered upper heaven class mental cultivation, \"Faceless Sky Devil\".'</p><br/><p>\u2018\"Faceless Sky Devil\" is the Infinite Devil sect\u2019s founding skill. The founder of the Infinite Devil sect had visited hell, worshiped the Faceless Devil, and cultivated this technique after hundred of years, only those who possess the Sky Devil Body can cultivate it.\u2019</p><br/><p>After seeing the description, Lin Fan cackled,\u2019 How far-fetched! But whatever, a powerful person can lie all he wants.\u2019 Since he just so happened to lack a mental cultivation skill, he might as well fix that.</p><br/><p>\u2018Learn \"Faceless Sky Devil\"?\u2019</p><br/><p>\"Learn.\"</p><br/><p>What a joke, he was troubled over not having any mental cultivation skills, now that one came on its own, how could he not learn it?</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026 congratulations, learned heaven class mental cultivation, \"Faceless Sky Devil\" level 1, experience\uff080/100000).</p><br/><p>\"Ding, congratulations learned \"Faceless Sky Devil\", true energy+1000.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was joyful that after learning the mental cultivation \"Faceless Sky Devil\", his true energy had increased by 1000. It was quite strong, and going from the description in the manual, \"Faceless Sky Devil\" had a total of nine levels. But he was curious how far he could cultivate it to.</p><br/><p>At the same time, Lin Fan discovered a problem; since he had the system, if he upgraded\"Faceless Sky Devil\", would that mean he would also level upgrade?</p><br/><p>But it was likely not that easy. When other people trained their own mental cultivation, their cultivation stage would also rise. But since he had a character level, he needed to rely on leveling up through experience, which was a rather sad thing.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan\u2019s head began hurting when he thought about it, not giving it any more thought in the end. As long as he continued gaining experiences crazily, he would have nothing to fear.</p><br/><p>Then Lin Fan began searching, finding some basic secret scrolls as he wondered what they could be.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026 discovered upper heaven class mental cultivation \"Will of the Sword\".'</p><br/><p>\u2018Damn it\u2026another heaven class mental cultivation! It seems this mental cultivation belongs to Ni Mantian\u2019s righteous sect.\u2019 Lin Fan sighed, strong people were really infuriating. It seemed both Ni Mantian and Mo Yi Xuan were quite important within their sects.</p><br/><p>\u2018\"Will of the Sword\", the highest sword will cultivated by the founder of the Linglong Sword sect, only those who possess the Will of the Sword\u2019s Body can cultivate it.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026 learn?\u2019</p><br/><p>\"Learn.\"</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026 congratulations, upper-class heaven mental cultivation\"Will of the Sword\" level 1, experience \uff080/100000).\"</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026 congratulations, learned \"Will of the Sword\", true energy + 1000.\u2019</p><br/><p>After learning two top tier mental cultivation skills, Lin Fan\u2019s heart began swelling up with a sense of invincibility. Of course, it was only maintained for two-three seconds before he stopped himself.</p><br/><p>Although he obtained these two skills, he still needed to slowly raise their levels, so it would be a long road up ahead. Then, Lin Fan began checking the remainder martial skills.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding, discovered upper earth class martial skill \"Deflowering Finger\".'</p><br/><p>\u2018\"Deflowering Finger\", a powerful self-cultivated skill of the Infinite Devil sect, one finger dominates the entire world, can only learn, may not be spoken of.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Learn?\u2019</p><br/><p>\"Wait, something seems up.\" Lin Fan\u2019s previous joyful heart felt like cold water had been dumped over it.</p><br/><p>\u2018\"Twisting Heaven and Earth\", \"Black Tiger Steals Heart\", and now a \"Deflowering Finger\", won\u2019t I end up just becoming a human developer like that? Deflowering Prince or Deflower Thief? No, no, absolutely not\u2026 as a person of justice, how can I learn such a lowly technique?\u2019</p><br/><p>\"Don\u2019t learn, definitely don\u2019t learn.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan then rubbed his chin in thought, his expression a little hesitant after finally obtaining a martial skill but not learning it.</p><br/><p>\u2018That\u2019s right, there are no good or bad martial skills, it just depends on the person who uses them. Yes, this is the truth\u2026 I can\u2019t be scared by just the martial skill\u2019s description.</p><br/><p>\"Learn.\" Lin Fan then learned it without any hesitation.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026 learned \"Deflowering Finger\" level 1, experience\uff080/1000\uff09</p><br/><p>Then Lin Fan looked towards the last manual. Since he had even learned \"Deflowering Finger\", what other skills would he not learn? But this manual was a bit disappointing. This was Ni Mantian\u2019s martial skill \"Wind Chasing Sword Tactics\"</p><br/><p>Lower earth class.</p><br/><p>\"Wind Chasing Sword Tactics\"was presently the only proper attack skill Lin Fan encountered so far. But since he didn\u2019t use a sword, this was a rather awkward situation.</p><br/><p>He had essentially checked all the items, and the only things left were the equipment. Lin Fan wasn\u2019t really interested in these equipment.</p><br/><p>All of the defense gear was essentially unnecessary for Lin Fan, \"Eternal Demon Body\" being more than enough.</p><br/><p>Then, Lin Fan took all the collected clothes, shoes, and one sword, and tossed them all into the furnace for forging.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026 profession advance blacksmith level not high enough, unable to melt for forging.\u2019</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan threw them into the furnace, this notification came up. Lin Fan sighed in exasperation; it seemed this area still wasn\u2019t sufficient enough. Not continuing any further, he then placed the items back into his bag and decided to wait for another chance in the future.</p><br/><p>After finishing everything, Lin Fan began relaxing.</p><br/><p>After the sky had darkened, Lin Fan found a large ancient looking tree and leaned on it while closing his eyes, and began cultivating \"Faceless Sky Devil\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan felt an energy flow within his body and began expanding.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026 \"Faceless Sky Devil\" experience + 10.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026 \"Faceless Sky Devil\" experience + 10.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Lin Fan opened his eyes, a bit confused. The cultivation of this skill was so slow that it didn\u2019t make sense. Then, he began cultivating the \"Will of the Sword\" as an experiment to see what was going on.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026 \"Will of the Sword\"experience + 1.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026 \"Will of the Sword\"experience + 1.\u2019</p><br/><p>Just what was going on? Both were heaven class mental cultivation skills, yet the experience gained was different. Perhaps, the upper-class mental cultivation \"Will of the Sword\" didn\u2019t suit him.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was feeling exasperated. Leveling up required 100,000 experience, and with this speed, just how long would it take?</p><br/><p>\u2018There must be a problem, it definitely shouldn\u2019t be like this.\u2019</p><br/><p>Although these two skills required proper specifications, since the system allowed him to train them, it must have eliminated those needs. Yet, it was still being cultivated so slowly. So there must be another reason, it was just that he hadn\u2019t discovered it yet.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

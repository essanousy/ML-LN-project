Hell if it could be considered as a treasure! Initially, it was just used for crafting weapons. But, because it was tough and firm, Lin Fan then decided to hide within it each time he bumped into an enemy attack he couldn't deal with.</p><br/><p>The moment the Heaven and Earth Smelt appeared, Lin Fan discovered that the eyes of the Death Demonic God had opened wide.</p><br/><p>Now, the Death Demonic God's face was naturally hidden underneath that black robe, and there was no way one could make out his eyes. But, Lin Fan guessed that this fella must have definitely opened his eyes wide.</p><br/><p>\"Now, Lord Death Demonic God, what do you think of this treasure?\" Lin Fan asked.</p><br/><p>\"Good.\" The Death Demonic God spoke up. There was a hint of excitement in that tone of his.</p><br/><p>\"Human, you have performed well. How about submitting under Your Demonic God here and becoming my underling? With Your Demonic God watching over you, there will be no one who will dare to mess with you in this entire world.\" The Death Demonic God spoke up.</p><br/><p>The moment Lin Fan heard this, he blinked his eyes. 'Become your mother's underling!', he thought. But, in Lin Fan's opinion on the other hand, since the Death Demonic God could say out words like these, he was definitely an existence whom Lin Fan could talk things over with.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan's mind started pondering over it. He had to come up with a good plan.</p><br/><p>\"To be able to become an underling of the Death Demonic God\u2026 This is such a privilege!\"</p><br/><p>\"Lord Death Demonic God, do you eat Spicy Gluten?\" Lin Fan hurriedly entered the Earth in his Inner World and searched for the most amazing delicacy on Earth, the Spicy Gluten.</p><br/><p>'Bloody f*ck, Death Demonic God! Yours Truly is going to mess with you good and proper today!' Lin Fan cursed in his heart. He then started infusing a large amount of twisted medicine into that Spicy Gluten.</p><br/><p>'Spirit of Biggra! Refine, refine, refine!' He refined till its most intricate state, and had it fused with the Spicy Gluten.</p><br/><p>'Ding\u2026Congratulations on creating a pack of Biggra Spicy Gluten.'</p><br/><p>\"Spicy Gluten?\" The face of the Death Demonic God was surprised, not knowing what this was.</p><br/><p>By now, Lin Fan had successfully created that pack of Spicy Gluten, and his heart was filled with an unlimited amount of hope. He had to steady this! This time around, he had to hold real steady!</p><br/><p>\"That's right. This is THE Spicy Gluten that's said to be the most delicious through all legends. This is something I've accumulated over many years.\" Lin Fan took out the Spicy Gluten. Those sticks of Spicy Gluten emerging one after another looked so seductive.</p><br/><p>Looking at these seductive Spicy Glutens, even Lin Fan could not help but gulp down his saliva. But, when he thought about the effects of these Spicy Gluten, he forced himself to stay calm.</p><br/><p>As long as this Death Demonic God ate the Spicy Gluten of Yours Truly, things would truly get fun then!</p><br/><p>He could then hide within the Heaven and Earth Smelt before releasing the Big Ancient Demon for them to have a good poke at one another before he collected the returns of the fight.</p><br/><p>And, if this Death Demonic God could be killed, his cultivation state would definitely skyrocket off the charts. By then, hell, he'd be damn great!</p><br/><p>Even though he was a Divine celestial level 10, Eternal God state being right now, compared to these Demonic Gods and whatnot, there was still a world of a difference. But, as long as he could kill a single one, things would be easy to deal with later on.</p><br/><p>\"Delicious Spicy Gluten.\"</p><br/><p>At this moment, Lin Fan seemed to have heard the sounds of saliva being slurped down. But, he took it as a figment of his imagination and did not put it to heart.</p><br/><p>\"Give it to me.\" The Death Demonic God stretched out his hand.</p><br/><p>\"Indeed, he's got a low intellect!\"</p><br/><p>In Lin Fan's opinion, powerful beings such as this Death Demonic God would normally be high and aloof, and would kill over a single disagreement. How else would they talk to him as peacefully as right now?</p><br/><p>Taking the Spicy Gluten in his hands, the Death Demonic God tore open the packaging and took out a single stick. He sniffed at it before looking around.</p><br/><p>At this moment, the hands of the Death Demonic God which were hidden beneath the white robe pulled up the black robe that was covering his face slightly, revealing his chin.</p><br/><p>\"EH?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was stunned, feeling somewhat taken aback. When he saw that snow white sharp chin, he had a bad feeling about this.</p><br/><p>How could this be?</p><br/><p>Isn't this the f*cking Death Demonic God?</p><br/><p>In Lin Fan's mind, this was supposed to be an extremely ugly and horrifying existence! But at this moment, Lin Fan was starting to realize that everything was completely different!</p><br/><p>This Death Demonic God was completely different from what he had imagined!</p><br/><p>This was a chick!</p><br/><p>Even though he could only see her chin right now, based on Lin Fan's many years of experience, he could make out her entire face with just this chin alone!</p><br/><p>Pink lips!</p><br/><p>There were two pointy teeth on each side of her mouth as she placed that red hot Spicy Gluten into her mouth and nibbled on it gentle.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan gulped down his saliva in a huff.</p><br/><p>Wrong. This was definitely wrong!</p><br/><p>Lin Fan wanted to say something. But just at this moment, he had to swallow his words back.</p><br/><p>\"How is it?\" He asked carefully.</p><br/><p>At this moment, the Death Demonic God released the grip on the scythe in her hands as she peeled over the black robe that was covering her head, revealing a bright head of red hair that was akin to a burning sun.</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan caught sight of the face of the Death Demonic God, his little heart started thumping furiously.</p><br/><p>'F*ck me\u2026!'</p><br/><p>It was truly as he had imagined!</p><br/><p>But this wasn't right! The Death Demonic God of the Ancient race should look like the Ancient race beings as well! How could she possibly look like this?</p><br/><p>\"Yes, not bad. Your Demonic God is pleased.\" All of a sudden, the voice of the Death Demonic God changed.</p><br/><p>That sinister voice from earlier on had disappeared entirely. It was as though everything she had said earlier on was modified by a machine!</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>At this moment within the Paradise\u2026</p><br/><p>The Big Ancient Demon had long received Lin Fan's notifications and was ready to go for a big round of f*cking up with this Death Demonic God. The Big Ancient Demon had already seen himself as the object of one's pent-up frustrations to be vented after the effects of Biggra.</p><br/><p>Even though the Big Ancient Demon was of the Demon race, he wasn't a casual person as well.</p><br/><p>In his opinion, this Death Demonic God must definitely be some ugly skeleton or perhaps some creature with an extremely hideous face. But, at this moment when he caught sight of the face of the Death Demonic God, the Big Ancient Demon could no longer hold it in!</p><br/><p>\"Master, let me do it! Even though I, the Big ancient Demon, am royalty within the Demon race, I am willing to sacrifice myself for the noble ambitions of my Master!\"</p><br/><p>The Big Ancient Demon said while his eyes flashed with a sharp glint.</p><br/><p>That red hot hair, those exquisite features\u2026 Bloody hell! If someone else were to tell Lin Fan that this was the Death Demonic God, he wouldn't have believed it at the death of him.</p><br/><p>When he heard the words of the Big Ancient Demon, Lin Fan coughed gently, \"It's alright. Yours Truly has given it a thought earlier on. You have suffered enough for me, Big Ancient Demon. It's better for me to face this problem myself personally.\"</p><br/><p>\"It's not enough! Not enough, Master! I'm all willing! Let me do it this time around!\" The Big Ancient Demon yelled.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan did not give the Big Ancient Demon any chance to say anymore as he closed his Paradise shut immediately.</p><br/><p>The situation later on would definitely be intense.</p><br/><p>But, Lin Fan had already made up his mind.</p><br/><p>'If I don't enter Hell, who would?'</p><br/><p>Even though this Death Demonic God might be terrifying, he was the hero that was going to save the world.</p><br/><p>If he couldn't even endure something like this, how was he going to continue down this harsh path in the future?</p><br/><p>As time slowly slipped by, Lin Fan just stood there silently watching.</p><br/><p>By the time the Death Demonic God ate the last stick of Spicy Gluten, Lin Fan knew that what had to happen would eventually happen.</p><br/><p>\"Yes.\"</p><br/><p>And right at this moment, the face of the Death Demonic God was starting to change ever so slightly. This was the effect of Biggra.</p><br/><p>\"Human, you are decent. Your Demonic God is very pleased. From now on forth, you shall provide Your Demonic God with more of this Spicy Gluten thing. Your Demonic God will not treat you poorly.\" The Death Demonic God could feel a ridiculous lust that was burning up within her.</p><br/><p>\"Yes, yes\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded his head silently. At the same time, he was all prepared.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Lin Fan suddenly thought of a phrase.</p><br/><p>'Let the thunderstorm come forth ever more ferociously!'</p><br/><p>But all of a sudden, Lin Fan was starting to discover that something wasn't right with the situation.</p><br/><p>\"Lord Death Demonic God, what are you doing!\" Lin Fan was still in his imagination when he realized that the Death Demonic God had pointed out with her finger, causing the void to vibrate out. Hinges that were made out of the Law locked all four limbs of Lin Fan tightly.</p><br/><p>Huff! Huff!</p><br/><p>The Death Demonic God was breathing out heavily right now as though her frame of might was starting to get blurry. She wielded the Death God Scythe in her hand and transformed it. All of a sudden, the scythe turned into a long black whip.</p><br/><p>T-this\u2026!</p><br/><p>'Not good! She's bloody wanting to abuse me!' Lin Fan started to get frantic as he struggled furiously.</p><br/><p>But no matter how strong Lin Fan was, he could not get out of this situation at all!</p><br/><p>\"I request to tag out! I request a change of person!\" At this moment, Lin Fan yelped out. 'Bloody hell! Big Ancient Demon! Come on out!'</p><br/><p>Piak!</p><br/><p>A black streak of light flashed.</p><br/><p>\"Human, you've filled Your Demonic God here with an insatiable lust to train you up. You're going to belong to Your Demonic God now.\" The eyes of the Death Demonic God shone with a weird glint. That exquisite face of hers let out a deranged look as well.</p><br/><p>\"Holy mother*cker\u2026! Yours Truly is regretting it now\u2026!!!\"</p><br/><p>\"AHHHHH!\"</p><br/><p>\"HAHAHAHAH\u2026!!!\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

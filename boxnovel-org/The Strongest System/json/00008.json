At the same time, he began to recognize the Saint Devil Sect\u2019s system. Genius, that was the critical point that needed to be raised. In the Saint Devil Sect, the outer sect examination disciples were divided into nine major sites, the area Lin Fan was in was merely a small portion of one of those sites, and this small fraction alone contained hundreds of people.</p><br/><p>An overall estimation would likely end up with a terrifying number. The Saint Devil Sect, in order to discover those hidden geniuses within the sect, enforced a reward system for identifying and reporting a genius.</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior-brother Ni, what kind of person is senior-brother Meng. Do you think he will like a genius like myself?\u201d Lin Fan asked while cackling.</p><br/><p>Ni Mingyang, who was walking in front, stopped suddenly. Lin Fan watched Ni Mingyang, wondering what kind of result this would bring.</p><br/><p>\u201cJunior-brother Lin, senior-brother Meng is a solemn person. You must not be disrespectful in front of senior brother Meng\u2026 Be sure to keep that in mind.\u201d Ni Mingyang said seriously. He was afraid that this innocently playful junior-brother might act out of line in front of senior brother Meng.</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood.\u201d Lin Fan nodded his head, a bit curious towards this so-called senior-brother Meng, one of the outer sect\u2019s top ten geniuses. To be within the top ten among the thousands of outer sect disciples, he most likely was a very powerful person. While walking, Lin Fan entered the grand garden. Since the time he became a punching bag, Lin Fan had never been anywhere else. So naturally, he didn\u2019t know how big the Saint Devil Sect was. Thus, the sight in front of him brought Lin Fan into an entirely new world.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe have arrived. This is where senior-brother Meng resides.\u201d Lin Fan looked at the house in front of him, his heart yearning, \u2018One day, I will also possess all of this.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cEnter, and remember, don\u2019t be disrespectful.\u201d Ni Mingyang cautioned again.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, I understand senior-brother Ni.\u201d Lin Fan nodded his head. Towards senior-brother Ni, Lin Fan still had a desire to get closer to him. Even though he would occasionally act tough, but the intelligence and compassion was still very touching.</p><br/><p>Within the pearly white walls of the garden, the surrounding green willows, and the adorning mountain rocks gave off an impression of magnificence and elegance. \u2018So this is the place one of the outer sect\u2019s top ten geniuses resides in\u2026 It truly is desirable.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior-brother Meng\u2026\u201dNi Mingyang stood outside the house and respectfully greeted.</p><br/><p>\u201cEnter.\u201d A faint voice came from inside the house, at which point Lin Fan became a bit nervous. Hearing the voice alone, he could sense the toughness which was quite high.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Lin Fan followed behind Ni Mingyang and entered inside. The insides of the house emitted a sense of antiquity, like a place where a scholar would reside. For a devil sect, this kind of place was a bit incongruous.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs this the genius mentioned by the underling?\u201d\"Meng Yangquan closed the ancient book within his hands, and then carefully observed Lin Fan. Lin Fan also stared directly at this so-called outer sect\u2019s top ten geniuses.</p><br/><p>\u2018Sure enough\u2026A dragon amongst men.\u2019</p><br/><p>As a man, Lin Fan also felt some envious hate, \u2018What was up with this world? How could there be so many men that possessed such devilish beauty?\u2019</p><br/><p>And the so-called senior brother Meng in front of him, even with his devilish beauty, he didn\u2019t possess a sense of overwhelming superiority but instead gave off an indescribable feeling.</p><br/><p>In more modern terms, an elegant indifference\u2026difficult to speak with, definitely difficult to speak with.</p><br/><p>And when Lin Fan took a look at the level, he was instantly convinced.</p><br/><p>\u201cSixth level Pericelestial\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Seriously, with a cultivation base that high and still lying around among the outer sect disciples, this is insane.\u2019</p><br/><p>Breaking through to postcelestial would allow one to become an inner sect disciple. Upon entering the pericelestial stage, they could become a core disciple and even compete for the position of sect head; the weaker ones could still become sect elders or the likes.</p><br/><p>\u2018This is essentially just a max level pig who is stubbornly refusing to leave the beginner\u2019s zone.\u2019</p><br/><p>Of course, this thought was kept inside Lin Fan\u2019s heart. Even though his \u300aTitanium Grade Demon Body\u300b had reached the eighteenth level, when Lin Fan thought about it, perhaps even with a mere breath of the other party would reduce him to nothing.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re Lin Fan?\u201dMeng Yangquan asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Lin Fan silently but non-submissively nodded his head, \u2018Even though your cultivation base is quite high, but no matter what, I am someone who possesses the ultimate system. I cannot lose face.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior-brother Meng, the cultivation of junior-brother Lin\u2019s \u300aTitanium Grade Demon Body\u300b is really high, it can even withstand my full-powered strike. He is a rare talent for sure.\u201d Ni Mingyang said excitedly.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Senior-brother Meng\u2019s gentle expression slightly changed. Lin Fan suddenly felt as if his whole being was completely exposed in front of senior-brother Meng. Lin Fan felt a bit awkward, \u2018The cultivation base of senior-brother Meng is quite high, how is his style like this?\u2019 Not long after that, this kind of feeling disappeared.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot bad, not bad\u2026he is definitely unusual, \u300aTitanium Grade Demon Body\u300b is Saint Devil Sect\u2019s lowest body training technique. To be able to train it to that level is also an incredible qualification. But your cultivation base is rather low, so you need to work harder.\u201d Meng Yangquan\u2019s expression was calm, but felt quite shocked on the inside, with a strong feeling of disbelief.</p><br/><p>But how could an expert like him reveal a shocked expression in front of the juniors? \u201cI thank senior-brother Meng for the advice.\u201d Lin Fan said. \u201cTomorrow morning, take him to elder Li\u2019s place for initiation.\u201d Meng Yangquan said.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Ni Mingyang nodded his head and prepared to leave.</p><br/><p>\u201cTomorrow morning......\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior-brother?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFor the inner sect exams in three months, you should work hard, set aside your other businesses and give it a try.\u201d Meng Yangquan said.</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior-brother, wherever you go, I will also be there,\u201d Ni Mingyang said with a firm expression.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan, who stood to the side, silently looked towards the two people and pondered, \u2018Does Ni Mingyang perhaps like men?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Tch, tch...I don\u2019t want to think about it, I don\u2019t want to think about it\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cHa, go.\u201d Meng Yangquan sighed.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Outside\u2026</p><br/><p>Along the way, Ni Mingyang didn\u2019t say a single word, and Lin Fan became a bit bored.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the cultivation base of senior brother Meng?\u201dLin Fan pretended to be clueless and asked. After all, for a sixth level pericelestial to stay in the outer sect, it was quite weird.</p><br/><p>\u201cThird level postcelestial.\u201d Ni Mingyang replied. Lin Fan nodded his head, \u2018As expected, there is something up\u2026 even hiding the cultivation base and not letting others know. Was Meng Yangquan perhaps actually a \u2018tiger pretending to be a pig\u2019 type of big shot?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior-brother, senior-brother Meng told you to enter the inner sect exams, why won\u2019t you go? People strive to aim higher, do you want to stay in the outer sect for the rest of your life?\u201d Lin Fan asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t understand\u2026\u201d Ni Mingyang didn\u2019t say anything more. Hearing this, Lin Fan instantly exploded in his mind. \u2018Seriously, I don\u2019t understand? You don\u2019t even bother to explain the situation and just say I don\u2019t understand. Whatever\u2026just whatever.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018I am not a gossiping type of person, who cares if there is some kind of relationship or something between you two, it has nothing to do with me. But it really is intriguing.\u2019</p><br/><p>Lin Fan really wanted to open Ni Mingyang\u2019s head and carefully investigate what exactly was going on, to the point of him being ready to cast aside his chance for promotion and riches.</p><br/><p>But upon seeing Ni Mingyang\u2019s current deadpan expression, Lin Fan didn\u2019t bother to pursue the matter.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

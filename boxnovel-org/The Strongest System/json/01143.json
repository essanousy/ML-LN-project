He did not want to waste time blindly with this lad here any longer. For some unknown reason, he was just getting this really uneasy feeling in his heart, as though something bad was about to happen.</p><br/><p>This feeling was way too nefarious!</p><br/><p>The Boundless Future Buddha Lord barked out, \u201cLad! Don\u2019t you get overboard now! Are you thinking of chasing me to the edges of the world?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chasing tight behind the Boundless Future Buddha Lord, Lin Fan replied, \u201cBloody stop and have a talk with me! Let\u2019s have a good talk! Don\u2019t worry, I guarantee that I won\u2019t scam you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cScram!\u201d There was absolutely no way the Boundless Future Buddha Lord would believe in Lin Fan\u2019s words. If he were to do so, he would end up like the Chasm Master God \u2014 filled with indignance even till his very last breath.</p><br/><p>To think that the Chasm Master God would have believed that this lad would actually help him to block a move and even let him leave. Now he knew of how miserable an outcome one would have after trusting the words of this lad, right? This was just an inhumane person! Heck, even devils would not be as despicable as this lad!</p><br/><p>And to think that he would call himself a disciple of the Heaven and Earth Sect? His way of doing things were even more devilish than devils!</p><br/><p>Absolutely untrustworthy, despicable, and shameless! Even his treasures were so damned underhanded! Once upon a time, there was a roll for the top ten evildoers. But even the ten of those evildoers combined would not be as lowly as this lad here!</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t that the Boundless Future Buddha Lord was afraid of this lad; he merely felt that there was no need to continue wasting his energy with here. He had more important things to deal with. Right now, he had finally understood; it was going to be absolutely impossible for him to have this lad slain given his current situation. The only way he would have the confidence of killing this lad was after he had attained the great Dao of the Heavenly Lord. As for now, it was still impossible.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was getting exasperated now, filled with battle intent at this moment! He shouted out, \u201cBald monk, you\u2019ve disappointed me far too much! Back in the past, when I caught sight of you, the only thing I could do was make a break for it and feel all flustered. But now that Yours Truly wants to duke it out with you, you\u2019re the one who\u2019s making a break for it! Can you not do this? How about let\u2019s fight for a good 300 rounds!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Boundless Future Buddha Lord turned his head around and glared at Lin Fan. Raising his palm, a bright beam of Buddhist light pierced through the entire void. Startled, Lin Fan dodged at it right away. \u201cHoly f*ck! You\u2019re so despicable! To think that you would still dare to try and sneak an attack on me? Stand there if you\u2019ve got the balls!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan had not expected that this bald monk would be so cowardly. At the start, he had thought that this bald monk would definitely fight it out with him. But, it was only now that he realized that he had been making light of things. The bald monk had no intention of fighting him at all.</p><br/><p>Right now, Lin Fan was already making use of his fastest possible speed. But, as though he had popped down pills and was high, that bald monk was somehow even faster, such that he could not catch up at all!</p><br/><p>Lin Fan took a furious stomp forward, causing the entire void to explode out. As he raised his finger, a sharp Sword Will streaked out and floated right in the void, slicing out toward the Boundless Future Buddha Lord.</p><br/><p>An infinite Sword Will that cut through the void and caused a series of ripping sounds to reverberate out.</p><br/><p>\u201cFuse!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFlying Heavens!\u201d</p><br/><p>His Sword Will fused together as Flying Heavens started revolving up within the void, fusing together with.</p><br/><p>The Boundless Future Buddha Lord swung his entire head around. While he did not know what that lad was up to or what that thing in his hand was, he knew with a single glance that it was definitely nothing good.</p><br/><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you really good at running? Yours Truly is going to use Flying Heavens to pierce through your anus today!\u201d</p><br/><p>Pshew! Pshew!</p><br/><p>Flying Heavens spun out at a furious speed. Thereafter, with the boost of the Sword Will, it bolted through the void and flew over. With an extremely penetrative force, it twisted the entire void in its path, generating an extremely dull sound.</p><br/><p>The Boundless Future Buddha Lord felt that this lad was just completely sick in the head. Just when in the world was he intending to stop chasing him?</p><br/><p>But all of a sudden, he realized that there were some disturbances in the void behind him! It was as though there was something locked onto some part of his body. This was a feeling that left him feeling extremely uncomfortable. When he turned around, his expression changed entirely as he swept his robes aside, sending the Future Gear flying out with a tremendous might that blocked the Flying Heavens.</p><br/><p>A ringing sound of the two items clashing erupted forth as the brows of the Boundless Future Buddha Lord furrowed. He had not imagined that this lad would actually have such capabilities! This was something that left his blood running cold.</p><br/><p>Looking at how even Flying Heavens was useless, Lin Fan could only curse out loudly, \u201cBald monk! Sure, you had better f*cking run! But, Yours Truly shall have you know that I\u2019m hell bent on following you! No matter where you run off to, I\u2019m going to be hot on your tails! You can try running for your entire life if you want to!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a lunatic!\u201d The Boundless Future Buddha Lord was enraged. He had not expected that this lad would be so difficult to be rid of! \u201cAlright! Since you love to follow me that much, you can just continue following then! Your Buddha Lord is going to see just how much more time you can spend following me!\u201d</p><br/><p>In the eyes of the Boundless Future Buddha Lord, there was no way this lad could follow him forever. Since that was the case, he would just see who could outlast the other to the end then!</p><br/><p>Hmph!</p><br/><p>Competing to see who could last longer?</p><br/><p>Was that something that this lad could compete with him in?</p><br/><p>Before Your Buddha Lord was a Buddha Lord, he was a poor monk who had cultivated diligently and bitterly while sitting out in the desolated mountains for many years, just so he could cultivate this Buddha Heart! Since this lad wanted to compete with himself, he would let this lad come then!</p><br/><p>Lin Fan had not expected that the Boundless Future Buddha Lord would be so brazen to actually dare and taunt him! He had initially thought that he would just let this off. Since he could not chase this guy down, he might as well just let him off. But, to think that this bald monk would dare to even mock him! That was something intolerable for him indeed.</p><br/><p>\u2018Fine, fine! You think you\u2019re good, huh? We\u2019ll compete it out then!\u2019</p><br/><p>A single day passed as two figures streaked through the void, crossing the Heavens up in the North down to the Earth down in the South.</p><br/><p>Two days\u2026</p><br/><p>Three days\u2026</p><br/><p>The Boundless Future Buddha Lord was getting a little vexed now. However, things were still fine; he could still bear with it. He refused to believe that this lad could still continue to follow through.</p><br/><p>A month later\u2026</p><br/><p>The Boundless Future Buddha Lord was about to break down now as he glared at Lin Fan with a pair of hateful eyes. He had not expected that this lad would be this sick to actually follow him for an entire month now!</p><br/><p>In that period of time, he had not even stopped for a single breath\u2019s moment. As for that lad, it was the exact same, following closely behind him without stopping at all. This was just absolutely unbelievable.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan roared out, \u201cBald monk! You had better bloody stop down! We\u2019ll have a good 300 rounds of fighting!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Boundless Future Buddha Lord was just incensed. This darned lad had chased him for a full month now!</p><br/><p>\u201cARGH!\u201d</p><br/><p>Thoroughly enraged, the Boundless Future Buddha Lord came to a stop. \u201cYOU\u2019RE COURTING DEATH, AREN\u2019T YOU\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTHE UNLIMITED BUDDHA\u2019S DAO! HEAVEN AND EARTH BUDDHIST LIGHT!\u201d</p><br/><p>With him bellowing out in rage, a profound Buddhist light shone out in all directions from behind the Boundless Future Buddha Lord, causing the entire world to be blanketed by a wave of Buddhist light that curled out at Lin Fan. That boundless Buddhist light that was filled with an invincible amount of energy. This was especially the case for the Power of Buddha that was enveloping the entire world in it. If any ordinary people were to catch sight of it, they might even be scared to death by it alone!</p><br/><p>But for Lin Fan, this situation right now was just absolutely wonderful.</p><br/><p>\u201cBald monk, incredible! You\u2019re trying to fight me head on now? That\u2019s right! What\u2019s the point of just running away all the time?\u201d Lin Fan\u2019s heart leaped with joy as he was totally unfazed when facing this Immortal Art of the bald monk. Stamping down on the ground, his hand took on the role of a knife as he chopped down right onto that Buddhist Light.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll chop!\u201d</p><br/><p>In the fraction of a second, the entire world was filled with an overwhelming Sword Will that sliced that wave of Buddhist Light into tiny shards. Lin Fan then bolted out for the Boundless Future Buddha Lord. \u201cLET\u2019S FIGHT MELEE!\u201d</p><br/><p>BAM!</p><br/><p>Lin Fan threw a single fist out at the Boundless Future Buddha Lord right away. After being chased down by Lin Fan for an entire month, the Boundless Future Buddha Lord was just filled up to his head with wrath. \u201cI\u2019LL HAVE YOUR LIFE\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>Opening up his Buddha Palm, he pushed down with a palm strike that shrouded the entire world in a massive Buddha Power. As it collided together with Lin Fan\u2019s fist, a resounding boom rippled out across the entire world \u2014 this was the explosion of power. Even the entire Heaven and Earth trembled out violently under this might.</p><br/><p>\u201cHAHAHA! THIS IS JUST PLEASURABLE!\u201d Lin Fan roared out in laughter. Flipping his palm, he then gripped tightly onto the arm of the Boundless Future Buddha Lord.</p><br/><p>\u201cHEHE!\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, Lin Fan smirked out.</p><br/><p>When the Boundless Future Buddha Lord caught sight of this smirk, the color drained from his face \u2014 he had discovered something that didn\u2019t seem right.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p></div>\n</div>"}

Even if you guys aren't afraid of death, you can't drag Yours Truly down with you! Yours Truly isn't tired of living just yet!'</p><br/><p>But of course, this was the thought he had initially while he was stunned by the aura of the Sovereign King Wei. However, upon closer inspection of the essence spirit, Lin Fan was elated.</p><br/><p>Divine celestial level 2 cultivation Realm state.</p><br/><p>Seemed like this essence spirit that had descended was only equal to a divine celestial cultivation Realm state being!</p><br/><p>If this were earlier on, perhaps this cultivation Realm state alone would have had Lin Fan crying sh*tless. However, right now, Flying Heavens had a dual lifeform weapon spirit all on its own. Within it, just the Marquis of Despair alone was of the divine celestial level 2 cultivation Realm state.</p><br/><p>Therefore, Lin Fan came up with a new action plan. It was time to give it a shot.</p><br/><p>With a strong backing such as the Motherf*cking Human King, Lin Fan, all of the former captive beings were filled with an immense courage right now.</p><br/><p>No matter how weak they were personally, they felt like a peerless overlord right now. Emboldened by Lin Fan's presence, they pointed their fingers in the sky and cussed out with all sorts of nonsense. Furthermore, all of their curses were extremely imposing and cocky!</p><br/><p>\"Sovereign King Wei, your death is near!\"</p><br/><p>\"The Motherf*cking Human King is going to take you down with just the back of his palms! Do you believe it?\"</p><br/><p>\"We believe in it at least! Our Motherf*cking Human King's going to snuff you out!\"</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>The elders of the six major sects felt a sinking feeling of despair in their hearts. They were not as ignorant of the world as these former captives.</p><br/><p>Even though they did not know of the exact strength of the Motherf*cking Human King, they knew that he shouldn't have hit the divine celestial level 2 cultivation Realm state.</p><br/><p>Within the Ancient Saint World, even the difference of a single cultivation state was a world of difference.</p><br/><p>Elder Dulong and the other elders garnered that for the Motherf*cking Human King to be able to kill Gu Xiao, his cultivation state should be at the true divine celestial level 1 True state.</p><br/><p>While the former captive beings of the thousands of races were extremely relaxed right now, Elder Dulong and the others had a really grim look on their faces.</p><br/><p>Seemed like their deaths were truly set for this day.</p><br/><p>With that, Elder Dulong and the others shook their heads and sighed out in helplessness.</p><br/><p>However, at that moment, something unbelievable happened.</p><br/><p>\"Sovereign King Wei! That trash of a son of yours was killed by Yours Truly! What are you upset about?\" Looking up at the void, Lin Fan hollered out majestically.</p><br/><p>The essence spirit was changing forms rapidly. At this moment, it took on the form of a gigantic arm. From the palm of that arm, a pair of eyes and a mouth suddenly appeared.</p><br/><p>Those eyes shone with a dark, sinister gleam.</p><br/><p>\"To think that a mere human such as yourself would dare to act so brazenly before Your Majesty? Even your ancestors would not dare to speak to me in such a manner!\" He blared out.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was never one who was afraid of a battle of words. Since the Sovereign King Wei wanted to start the verbal battle, how could Lin Fan lose out?</p><br/><p>\"Hmph! How dare a mere essence spirit come before me so impertinently? In front of Yours Truly, your essence spirit is nothing but a mere ant! If your true body were to appear here right now, perhaps only then would Yours Truly be forced to let out a trick or two!\" Lin Fan tossed his robes and replied with a domineering aura, causing everyone present to freeze up.</p><br/><p>By now, all the elders of the six major sects were completely stumped.</p><br/><p>Did they have the wrong idea about this human?!</p><br/><p>Was it because this Motherf*cking Human King's cultivation state was so high compared to theirs that they could not make out his true strength at all?</p><br/><p>There had never been anyone who had dared to speak such brazen words before the Sovereign King Wei in the Ancient Saint World!</p><br/><p>Only if his true body were to appear would this human be forced to let out a trick or two? Didn't that mean that his true prowess was beyond the Heavens?</p><br/><p>\"Did you catch that, Sovereign King Wei? The noble Motherf*cking Human King's going to slaughter you today!\"</p><br/><p>\"Long live our Motherf*cking Human King!\"</p><br/><p>\"Take down the Sovereign King Wei and revive the glory of the thousands of races!\"</p><br/><p>By now, all the beings of the thousands of races were raving out in crazy excitement. Having gone through immense tortures and sufferings, the Motherf*cking Human King was their one true hope, their Heaven and Earth!</p><br/><p>Looking at these beings of the thousands of races, a thought bubbled up in Lin Fan's mind uncontrollably.</p><br/><p>'Are these guys really going to believe every single sh*t that Yours Truly says?'</p><br/><p>\"Just who are you?\" The eyes of the Sovereign King Wei shone with a weird light as he asked sternly, as though he was taken aback by these words. Because the Sovereign King Wei could not sense the aura of this human before him, he could not tell the cultivation state of the other party.</p><br/><p>Initially, the Sovereign King Wei had thought that he would be able to slap someone like this to death with a single slam of his hand.</p><br/><p>But, the unfazed look of this man before him, along with the fact that he didn't seem to be giving him any bit of respect, was throwing the Sovereign King Wei a little off. He was slightly wary right now, as though this other party could truly be some really powerful being.</p><br/><p>However, he knew all the powerful beings within the Human race right now. Just who in the world could this human be then?</p><br/><p>\"Hmph! Yours Truly is the Motherf*cking Human King. Never forget that. Yours Truly isn't someone you can afford to mess with.\" Lin Fan's aura was formidable without any signs of letting down at all.</p><br/><p>\"Motherf*cking Human King?\" Sovereign King Wei was bewildered. He had never heard of anyone with this name.</p><br/><p>The former captives grew excited once more.</p><br/><p>Dulong and the others were flabbergasted as well. To think that the Motherf*cking Human King could cause the unparalleled Sovereign King Wei some astonishment!</p><br/><p>If they had not witnessed this right for themselves, they would never have dared to believe that any being from the other races could manage to scare the Sovereign King Wei.</p><br/><p>\"Just who in the world are you exactly.\" Sovereign King Wei asked once more. However, his tone was no longer as imposing as before.</p><br/><p>\"Hmph! Yours Truly never repeats himself thrice. If you do not wish to lose your essence spirit right here, you had better scram now!\" Lin Fan raised his chin and called out haughtily.</p><br/><p>The moment they saw the gracefulness of their Motherf*cking Human King, all the beings of the thousands of races felt their hearts thumping with adrenaline.</p><br/><p>This was the first time in history that the thousands of races had been so imposing!</p><br/><p>\"Listen right up, Sovereign King Wei! This person here is the noble Motherf*cking Human King! The great Lin Fan of the Human race, who shines down upon all of us with his dazzling brilliance! If you do not wish to lose your trace of essence spirit here, you had better get the f*ck out right now! In the time to come, our Motherf*cking Human King would definitely come knocking on your doorsteps and take you down personally!\" Seizing the opportunity, Mu Longtian lashed out. Since he couldn't compare with the Motherf*cking Human King, he must make sure that this human has a lasting impression of him.</p><br/><p>Who knew if he might be able to catch the eye of the Motherf*cking Human King and gain a straight path up to the Heavens!</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was exhilarated right now. Not only was his plan working out well, the effects were pretty explosive indeed!</p><br/><p>But right at the moment Lin Fan heard what Mu Longtian claimed, he was stunned, as he turned his head slowly around to look at Mu Longtian in utter shock.</p><br/><p>Looking at how the Motherf*cking Human King had turned around to look at him, Mu Longtian straightened his back and revealed a beaming smile.</p><br/><p>'Smile\u2026YOUR MOTHER!' The moment Lin Fan caught sight of that smile, he cursed in his heart.</p><br/><p>\"Lin Fan?\" Sovereign King Wei murmured before going silent.</p><br/><p>But, Lin Fan knew that the Sovereign King Wei must be checking up on him right now.</p><br/><p>Indeed.</p><br/><p>In the blink of an eye, a thunderous holler boomed out from the Heavens.</p><br/><p>\"B*STARD! HOW DARE YOU TRY TO TRICK YOUR MAJESTY HERE? PREPARE TO DIE!\" Sovereign King Wei was totally angered by now. Upon receiving the name, he checked up the fugitive list immediately.</p><br/><p>The moment he saw that this so-called Motherf*cking Human King, Lin Fan, was only at the desolate celestial upper level, he was thoroughly incensed.</p><br/><p>He was the great sovereign that served directly under the utmost being. Since when had he ever been rattled by anyone else? However, to think that a mere desolate celestial ant would dare to use some secret treasure to hide away his true cultivation state and put on an act before him! If anyone else were to find out about this, where would the dignity of his great name go to?</p><br/><p>Sovereign King Wei's hand bolted out towards Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan sighed helplessly and cussed under his breath.</p><br/><p>'This is what happens when you've got noob teammates. These guys just f*cked up a possibly perfect act.'</p><br/><p>However, even if things had come to this, Lin Fan wasn't afraid.</p><br/><p>After all, there was always a Plan B.</p><br/><p>He would just have to kill ahead then.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

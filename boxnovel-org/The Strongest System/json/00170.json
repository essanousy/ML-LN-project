Some disciples could be seen working hard at cultivating on top of peaks or at the bases of waterfalls.</p><br/><p>Looking at these diligent disciples, Lin Fan did not head forth to disturb them.</p><br/><p>As Lin Fan headed towards the peak of the Grand Master, he was greeted by the sight of Zong Hentian.</p><br/><p>\"Junior Master Lin!\" Catching sight of Junior Master Lin, Zong Hentian broke into a smile. He had not seen Junior Master Lin ever since the expedition had ended.</p><br/><p>\"Junior Disciple, looking at your relaxed demeanor, I suppose you have quite a bit of confidence in the sparring of the geniuses?\" Lin Fan chuckled.</p><br/><p>Zong Hentian smiled awkwardly, \"Haha, don\u2019t tease me, Junior Master. It\u2019s because I have no confidence that I\u2019m out here taking a walk to calm my mood.\"</p><br/><p>\"How could you have no confidence when the sparring had yet to start?\"</p><br/><p>\"It\u2019s true, Junior Master. I truly am lacking in confidence.\" Zong Hentian was under immense pressure. For the sparring event, he was the hope of many Junior Brothers to perform well. But Zong Hentian clearly knew that he was not in the least bit confident or ready for this sparring.</p><br/><p>He had partaken in the sparring 3 years ago, and he was utterly toyed with and dangled like a puppet by the genius of Jiuxiao Sect. Even though he had trained fervently for these 3 years and had grown tremendously, he was still unable to claim that he\u2019d take victory in it.</p><br/><p>\"As long as you try your best... But yes, right, could you explain to Yours Truly what\u2019s the whole thing about this sparring between the geniuses?\" Lin Fan walked with Zong Hentian to a bench, and sat down to chat.</p><br/><p>\"Well Junior Master Lin, this goes way back. It started 3000 years ago. Back then, Jiuxiao Sect and Glory Sect were bonded to the point of life and death. When our ancestors were still disciples themselves, they got to know one another through a forbidden ground expedition, and grew to be really close from there on. However, they once got into an argument over whose sect had stronger disciples. Since they couldn\u2019t come to an agreement, they settled with this series of sparring, and it has lasted to this day.\"</p><br/><p>\"So, does anyone get any prize of any sorts for winning this?\"</p><br/><p>\"Nopes.\" Zong Hentian shook his head.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was stunned momentarily. Why were these guys trying so hard for something without a prize? He shook his head, \"Then, what\u2019s the meaning of all this? Where do our disciples get their motivation from without any prizes?\"</p><br/><p>Listening to Lin Fan\u2019s question, Zong Hentian shook his head fervently to correct him, \"That\u2019s not it, Junior Master. While there\u2019s no prize, this is an extremely important event for the sect. Therefore, we must not lose!\"</p><br/><p>Looking at Zong Hentian\u2019s determined face, Lin Fan could only shake his head helplessly. Seemed like this sparring was all just a pointless argument by some old fogies years ago.</p><br/><p>To think that it had lasted to this day. What a chore!</p><br/><p>\"Alright then, give it your best. I\u2019ve got high hopes for you.\" Lin Fan patted Zong Hentian on the shoulders and stood up, preparing to leave.</p><br/><p>\"Yes, Junior Master. That\u2019s all I can do as well.\"</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>Afternoon\u2026</p><br/><p>A gigantic ark appeared above the skies of Glory Sect.</p><br/><p>Glory Sect disciples who caught sight of the ark below were all deep within their own discussions.</p><br/><p>While this may be the first time some of the disciples had caught sight of Jiuxiao Sect, the rest who had taken part in the sparring every three years just found these guys to be a nuisance.</p><br/><p>Standing amongst the crowd, Lin Fan couldn\u2019t help but sigh as well. Whoever said that no sect would keep up with their reputation was definitely wrong. Just look at these guys. Their ark was tens of times larger than Glory Sect\u2019s. If Glory Sect\u2019s ark were to float up there side by side, it\u2019d be like a parent and its child.</p><br/><p>This time round, the person in charge of welcoming them was Senior Elder Wuya.</p><br/><p>\"Long time no see, Wuya. Seems like Glory Sect\u2019s grounds have been getting smaller in size, hasn\u2019t it? There\u2019s hardly even any room for us to park our ark anymore!\" On the ark, an old man with a long white beard chuckled.</p><br/><p>Looking at the situation, Lin Fan couldn\u2019t help but wonder. What a cocky old man! The first words he said were already so daring!</p><br/><p>\"Long time no see too, Brother Yichu. You seem like you\u2019ve aged considerably as well. Well, since you\u2019re here, how about you come on down and we can catch up?\" Senior Elder Wuya shook his head gently and smiled calmly.</p><br/><p>\"Alright.\" Senior Elder Liang Yichu of Jiuxiao Sect swept back his white robes and swiftly floated down in front of Senior Elder Wuya.</p><br/><p>This was the first time Lin Fan could clearly make out the appearance of this guy.</p><br/><p>Neither tall nor bulky, he was somewhat stumpy with a rotund face. With a big belly in front of him, he seemed like he was kind of pregnant as well.</p><br/><p>As the senior elders exchanged glances, their looks seemed to be filled with a thousand emotions.</p><br/><p>After a long stare, the both of them hugged each other and gave out a hearty laugh, as though they had been through thick and thin.</p><br/><p>Glory Sect and Jiuxiao Sect went way back. Since their ancestors made friends 3000 years ago, naturally they had got a pretty sturdy relationship over all these years.</p><br/><p>But this was only true for those of the previous generation. Somehow, the feeling was somewhat different for the current generation.</p><br/><p>\"Alright, come on down.\" Liang Yichu beckoned at the ark. It grew smaller, and his disciples descended down as well one by one. Each of them looked high and mighty, and glanced at Glory Sect with sharp eyes.</p><br/><p>\"Brother Wuya, what do you think of this?\" Liang Yichu smiled and laughed. Towards this generation\u2019s disciples, he was pretty pleased with their growth and powers. Now that he brought them over to Glory Sect, naturally he had to show them off as well.</p><br/><p>Senior Elder Wuya took a quick glance and stroked his beard without saying anything for a long time. Finally, he replied laughingly, \"Not bad, not bad. There are quite a few good seeds over here.\"</p><br/><p>\"Brother Wuya, isn\u2019t that not too generous? I\u2019m sure they\u2019re pretty much better than just a few good seeds!\"</p><br/><p>Senior Elder Wuya chuckled and did not reply. He did feel somewhat uncomfortable within his heart. Indeed, he couldn\u2019t deny that some of these disciples were pretty extraordinary.</p><br/><p>But compared to Mie Qiongqi of three years ago, they were far from him. Just that Mie Qiongqi\u2026sigh.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the numerous disciples and couldn\u2019t help but sigh as well. Indeed, these guys were pretty something.</p><br/><p>But what the hell was wrong with them?</p><br/><p>Each and every one of them stood with their noses facing the skies, as though they owned the place. Furthermore, their hands were all placed behind their backs, exuding authority and arrogance.</p><br/><p>That haughty demeanour of theirs made anyone who looked at them want to give them a thorough whacking.</p><br/><p>The surrounding Glory Sect disciples were deep in gossip as well.</p><br/><p>\"Look at that guy\u2019s gaze. Goodness, how I wish I can throw a punch at him!\"</p><br/><p>\"Right! And the other guy too! He looks as though Glory Sect is nothing much to him! Bloody hell!\"</p><br/><p>\"Hmph, let them continue to put on airs for now. When the genius sparring begins, I\u2019m sure our senior brothers from the inner sect would put them in their place!\"</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>\"Brother Wuya, let me introduce you to my own personal disciple. Xinfeng! Come over and greet Senior Wuya!\" Liang Yichu shouted to a disciple behind him.</p><br/><p>From the front row of the Jiuxiao Sect disciples, a jade faced disciple, who looked extremely elegant, headed forth. Even though every step of his was slow, he was in front of Liang Yichu in an instant.</p><br/><p>Shrinking distances instantaneously, that was an extremely high-level skill.</p><br/><p>\"Xinfeng, greet Senior Wuya.\"</p><br/><p>\"Hmm.\" Xinfeng looked at Senior Elder Wuya and nodded his head, passing that off as a greeting.</p><br/><p>\"My apologies, Brother Wuya. His temperament has been as such no matter how much I\u2019ve been trying to change him.\" Liang Yichu laughed gently, but his meaning was clear, \u2018So what if my disciple is arrogant? That\u2019s the way it is.\u2019</p><br/><p>Senior Elder Wuya shook his head and laughed. He did not put the incident in his heart at all.</p><br/><p>But on the other hand, Lin Fan, who had witnessed the entire incident, felt like a pack of horses had stampeded over his heart. What the hell? How could this fella be even cockier than him?</p><br/><p>This guy needed to be taught a lesson.</p><br/><p>He needed to understand that one must not be too cocky in life.</p><br/><p>Translator's Thoughts</p><br/><p>Lam Lam</p><br/><p>Hi guys, there\u2019s a portion which I\u2019m completely unable to translate out. Now, the last sentence is one must not be too cocky in life. In Chinese, \u2018too cocky\u2019 can be used in a slang way as Xinfeng as well, which is the guy\u2019s name. So there you have it HAHA.</p><br/><p>Cheers!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

At the time, he saw Mo Yi Xuan clutching a map in his hand, and naturally decided to check it out.</p><br/><p>The treasure map was made from an unfamiliar material and felt soft in his hands. It was unusually flexible, and even when Lin Fan tried to rip the map, it wouldn\u2019t tear at all.</p><br/><p>\"What kind of secrets does this map of the seventh saint have to make those two fight to death for it?\"Lin Fan opened the treasure map and glanced over it. Since he had just left the sect, the map was too confusing for him. He had no clue what the picture on it meant.</p><br/><p>But the map had two sentences, which he felt contained very deep meanings. Logically speaking, there should be secrets hidden within them.</p><br/><p>\"The heavens above heavens, a plane within the earth.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan knew this was valuable, and placed it into his bag, deciding to go over it when he gained more experience in the future.</p><br/><p>Then, Lin Fan searched Mo Yi Xuan\u2019s waist, but didn't find any storage bags.</p><br/><p>\"He has such a high cultivation base, but doesn\u2019t even have a single storage bag?\"Lin Fan searched a bit more but didn\u2019t find anything, and felt like giving up.</p><br/><p>Looting for the first time and being unsuccessful.</p><br/><p>\"Hah\u2026\"At that moment, Lin Fan\u2019s eyes caught something shiny. He saw a dazzling ring on Mo Yi Xuan\u2019s finger, upon seeing which he thought of something. Then, he eagerly removed the ring from Mo Yi Xuan\u2019s finger.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026 congratulations, discovered storage ring, open?\u2019</p><br/><p>\"Open.\" He would obviously open it, there must be treasures waiting for him within it.</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan saw the items within the storage ring, he began grinning from ear to ear.</p><br/><p>As expected from a powerful person, the items within the ring were all incredibly rare. But now was not the time to sort through the loot. He needed to find a safe place first and then go through it.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan placed all the items within the storage ring into his own bag. Of course, he wouldn\u2019t forsake the ring, so he took that too. Although he didn\u2019t need it, he could perhaps sell it for a good price.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan then searched Mo Yi Xuan from top to bottom but didn\u2019t find any more useful items.</p><br/><p>\"Hehh\u2026\" Lin Fan sighed. He didn\u2019t even have a weapon, and it was a wonder he could win against someone just by fighting with his bare hands.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smacked the brick over the two\u2019s head, but as he smacked Mo Yi Xuan, his innocent eyes suddenly emitted a dazzling light.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026 congratulations, discovered intermediate legendary item, Black Dragon clothes.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Black Dragon clothes: the scales of the wild beast black dragon, crafted with sky crystals, can block a portion of damage from stages under lesser celestial.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Rank: intermediate legendary.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan froze. He didn\u2019t think that he would discover such a treasure by just randomly touching. Weapon and armor ranking went from lower graded, middle graded, upper graded, and then legendary.</p><br/><p>This was a super rare item.</p><br/><p>This Mo Yi Xuan was way too rich.</p><br/><p>Then Lin Fan searched throughout his entire body with shining eyes, not even sparing the underwear.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026 congratulations, discovered intermediate legendary item black dragon cloud riding boots.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Black Dragon cloud riding boots: the wings of the wild beast black dragon, crafted with cloud crystals, can boost speed.\u2019</p><br/><p>Lin Fan leaped up with joy. It turned out to be a set, and the effect also seemed to be quite good.</p><br/><p>Although he couldn\u2019t kill Mo Yi Xuan, the profit he gained this time was enormous.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan then quickly stripped Mo Yi Xuan naked without any hesitation. These two items were way too recognizable. He tossed them into his bag and planned on having a good makeover when he left the place.</p><br/><p>Seeing the naked Mo Yi Xuan, Lin Fan then gave a sigh, his eyes locked onto the area around Mo Yi Xuan\u2019s crotch.</p><br/><p>He was somewhat guilty that his attack had been a little too heavy. His crotch was now this swollen and was likely to not be good enough to be used anymore.</p><br/><p>How about using twisting heaven and earth to fix it up.</p><br/><p>But Lin Fan felt that today\u2019s benefits were quite plentiful, and if he continued, it would be somewhat presumptuous.</p><br/><p>Also, having Mo Yi Xuan display his entire figure to the world was a bit wrong, and being the good person he was, Lin Fan took off his own white undergarments and wrapped them around Mo Yi Xuan like a diaper.</p><br/><p>Since they were both men, Lin Fan, of course, couldn\u2019t let Mo Yi Xuan lose all face; what needed to be protected should be protected.</p><br/><p>After finishing everything, Lin Fan then turn his eyes over from Mo Yi Xuan to Ni Mantian with difficulty. Such a beauty, Lin Fan naturally was hesitant. Such methods couldn\u2019t be used on the body of a beauty. But what needed to be checked would still be checked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026 congratulations, discovered intermediate legendary item, violet frost sword.\u2019</p><br/><p>Lin Fan touched Ni Mantian\u2019s sword and was joyful. Unexpectedly, it turned out to be an intermediate legendary sword\u2026 not bad, not bad\u2026 confiscated.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026 discovered lower legendary item, flowing cloud boots.\u2019</p><br/><p>Lin Fan began searching her body. Ni Mantian\u2019s shoes were lower legendary items\u2026 not bad, not bad\u2026 confiscated.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026 discovered intermediate legendary item, Phoenix clothes.\u2019</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was surprised, \u2018Another treasure! Just, ah, never mind, I will let this one slide\u2026 making such a beautiful girl like you be naked to the world is definitely not something a man should do.\u2019</p><br/><p>Lin Fan kept Ni Mantian\u2019s clothes on, but the clear and water-like ring on her hand couldn\u2019t escape from Lin Fan\u2019s hands.</p><br/><p>Confiscated\u2026confiscated\u2026 all confiscated.</p><br/><p>After he placed all the confiscated items into his bag, he then looked at the two selfless people, with his heart full of gratitude. He stood up straight in between the two people and then bowed down with a serious expression.</p><br/><p>\"Thank you two for the care, I will return the favor in the future.\"</p><br/><p>Though he thanked the two people, he still felt it wasn\u2019t enough. He then wrote a few words on the ground below Ni Mantian\u2019s feet.</p><br/><p>\"I understand your pain\u2026. A prideful and beautiful woman, how could you not let yourself be perfect? But don\u2019t worry, your previous defect has been fixed by me. No need to thank me\u2026 just remember my name, Lei Feng.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked through it once more, and after confirming there were no problems, he then went in front of Mo Yi Xuan and left a few words.</p><br/><p>\"A man\u2019s pride isn\u2019t their cultivation base or family history, but instead, one\u2019s own worth. I have helped you remake yourself today and increased it by several times. You should be satisfied now. If you want to thank me, remember my name, Lei Feng.\"</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>After finishing everything, Lin Fan nodded his head in satisfaction and then smiled towards the two people. He then took the legendary Nive-five red brick in his hand and smacked it over the two again.</p><br/><p>After finishing with his \u2018hard work,' he then without any hesitation and ran away like the wind.</p><br/><p>But after running away, he then ran back again. When he had left, Lin Fan\u2019s reluctant eyes had discovered a slight problem.</p><br/><p>Ni Mantian\u2019s chest wasn\u2019t the same size on both sides. For the earnest Lin Fan, this couldn\u2019t be tolerated. Lin Fan smacked the brick over the two\u2019s head again and started his repair.</p><br/><p>\"Black Tiger Steals Heart.\"</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026 congratulations\"Black Tiger Steals Heart\" experience + 1.\u2019</p><br/><p>\"Black Tiger Steals Heart.\"</p><br/><p>\"Black Tiger Steals Heart.\"</p><br/><p>After continuing for about ten minutes, Lina Fan finally stopped with satisfaction.</p><br/><p>\"Now it\u2019s perfect!\" After saying this, Lin then once again ran away like the wind.</p><br/><p>But Lin Fan was suspicious of one thing; did Black Tiger Steals Hear actually have this kind of side effect, or was it actually just Ni Mantian\u2019s chest swelling up? This question needed to be carefully analyzed in the future.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

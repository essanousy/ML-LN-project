This aimless searching had them not knowing just where the end of this would be.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no hurry. There should be some around. I refuse to believe that we can\u2019t bump into any.\u201d Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>This Endless Mainland was simply way too huge. Even after traveling for so many days, they hadn\u2019t caught sight of a single figure.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh? There\u2019re people up ahead.\u201d Jin Zhengu\u2019s eyes were the sharpest as he spotted a group of people up ahead.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan leaped with joy momentarily before looking over, \u201cThose guys look a little sinister. They seem to be people from a Demon Sect.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know them. They are people from the Connate Demon Residence.\u201d Qiu Zhanyu said.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d Lin Fan asked skeptically.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve met people from the Connate Demon Residence before. Their attires were all the same. Those beings from the Connate Demon Residence are extremely scary, and have vicious methods. Whoever lands in their hands would suffer a fate worse than death.\u201d Qiu Zhanyu replied.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan did have some inkling about the Connate Demon Residence. They were a strong sect within the Endless Mainland after all.</p><br/><p>Nine sects, six residences, three caves, and seventy two gangs\u2026</p><br/><p>This was the distribution of the famous factions in the Endless Mainland. The leaders of these factions had a strength that was practically the epitome of horror.</p><br/><p>While Lin Fan did not know what they were doing, he knew that they would not have gathered here if there wasn\u2019t anything significant.</p><br/><p>Pshew!</p><br/><p>At this moment, another few figures appeared from the boundaries of the sky. These few figures had a Demonic Qi that surged right into the sky. Even though they were not of the Connate Demon Residence, the people from the Connate Demon Residence did not have any conflict with the other party at all. The next few words were heard clearly by Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>\u201cToday, we are here to pay respects to the old Selfless Demon Ancestor. If there are any grudges of hatred, please let it go for now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>If it were any other type of situation, Lin Fan would not have minded. But, those words really stuck in his mind. Seemed like there would be benefits to be reaped here!</p><br/><p>Lin Fan started thinking about what he should do so that he could mix in with that bunch of fellas.</p><br/><p>At this moment, his gaze was cast toward Qiu Zhanyu and Jin Zhengu.</p><br/><p>The both of them froze for a moment as they felt some slight nervousness in their hearts, \u201cOld Bro, why are you looking at us like that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan revealed a brilliant smile. However, that smile was ever so horrifying in the eyes of Qiu Zhanyu and Jin Zhengu.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Pshew!</p><br/><p>The ripple of activity attracted the attention of the masses.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI am here to pay respects to the old Selfless Demon Ancestor.\u201d At this moment, Lin Fan came forth from the void. As he wielded a long spear in his hands, Qiu Zhanyu and Jin Zhengu were seen pierced through it.</p><br/><p>Right now, Qiu Zhanyu and Jin Zhengu were feeling extremely pained in their hearts. They felt that this Big Bro they had acknowledged was too darned vicious! Each time, he would use them as bait!</p><br/><p>These guys were all from Demon Sects. They did not have much of a suspicion towards Lin Fan\u2019s arrival.</p><br/><p>The Selfless Demon Ancestor was their mentor. Even though he had already fallen, a figure would always appear in their dreams. Teaching them many strong mystic skills of the martial arts, this figure referred to himself as the Selfless Demon Ancestor.</p><br/><p>Later on, in order to gain more benefits out of it, these people would head here every year to pay respects to the Selfless Demon Ancestor.</p><br/><p>And, the main reason for that was that each time they came to pay respects, they would enter a cunning space.</p><br/><p>Within that space were many treasures that existed, and each time they came out of it, they would return with bountiful rewards.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho are these two?\u201d A grim looking elderly man looked at Lin Fan warily.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled out, \u201cThese two fellas are Remnants of the Heaven and Earth Sect. The moment they saw that I was a demon, they started claiming things like purging demons to maintain righteousness. Hearing that, I just killed them casually.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Remnant\u2019s token was still hanging on Qiu Zhanyu\u2019s body. In the Endless Mainland, the Heaven and Earth Sect was a huge sect. Therefore, it was only natural that everyone knew of the Remnant\u2019s token.</p><br/><p>\u201cHoly f*ck! Brother, you\u2019re a little domineering, aren\u2019t you? To think that you would dare to kill Remnants of the Heaven and Earth Sect\u2026 And two of them at that!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHAHA! Purging demons to maintain righteousness? All of those sects are big on their words! If they want to purge us, that will have to depend on whether they have the capabilities to do so!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, you\u2019re one of us! I\u2019ve suffered some losses in the hands of disciples of the Heaven and Earth Sect in the past as well. This could be considered as taking some revenge for me there, brother!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSince we have all received grace from the Selfless Demon Ancestor, we\u2019re all on the same side!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled out, \u201cThat\u2019s for sure! I made sure to keep these two fellas alive so that I can turn them into my puppets later on and have them spy for me in the Heaven and Earth Sect.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow do I address you, brother? To think that you would have such ambitions! That is truly admirable indeed!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled out. He was about to reply when the air around them, which initially had no signs of activity, started to tremble all of a sudden.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Selfless Demon Ancestor has already opened up the space! Let us head in then!\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, the masses were not focused on Lin Fan as their bodies emitted a cunning sort of aura. This aura seemed to bear a connection with the void as they queued up to enter one after another.</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan caught sight of everything up ahead, he was stunned. Holy f*ck! To think that there would be such methods required to enter this place! Your Father didn\u2019t have this capability!</p><br/><p>Looking at them entering one after another, Lin Fan was starting to get a little flustered.</p><br/><p>After that, he just stood behind somebody.</p><br/><p>The person in front of Lin Fan turned around and looked at him before revealing a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother, after we come out later on, how about making friends with one another?\u201d The man asked.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled out, \u201cSure! No problem! Those who roam the world are all brothers!\u201d</p><br/><p>The man was slightly taken aback as though he had not expected such words to come from Lin Fan. He then broke out into a laugh, \u201cAlright! How about you go first, brother?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved it off with his hand immediately, \u201cNo, no! You should go first! I\u2019ll cover the back!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright then.\u201d The man smiled before turning his head to the front again.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at how he was the only one left now. Just as the man was about to head in, Lin Fan knocked him out with the brick before releasing Qiu Zhanyu and Jin Zhengu immediately.</p><br/><p>\u201cBig Bro! Even though we\u2019ve popped those pills, it still hurt a lot!\u201d Qiu Zhanyu complained.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright! Let\u2019s cut the crap here. Hurry up and take action.\u201d Lin Fan said before searching the body of the other party. If he could not find anything on the body of this fella, he would just Purify him later on to see if there were any tricks to it.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Lin Fan discovered a black ball-like object in the storage ring of the other party. This spherical ball was only the size of a fist, and yet, there was quite a bit of dark aura hidden within.</p><br/><p>This aura had a strong connection with the reverberations in the void here. It was as though one could only enter if they held on to this object.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan hoisted the fella up and tossed him straight toward the tremors of the void.</p><br/><p>Shrrrrk!</p><br/><p>In the next instant, something that stunned Lin Fan occurred. To think that the man would have been minced into pieces!</p><br/><p>Horrifying!</p><br/><p>This was too bloody horrifying!</p><br/><p>At this moment, Lin Fan already understood things clearly: if he wanted to enter, he would have to depend on this thing here.</p><br/><p>However, there was only one of this thing here. Qiu Zhanyu and Jin Zhengu would definitely not be able to enter. Therefore, it seemed like he was the only one who would be entering.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe two of you, listen up. Use the Heaven and Earth Net to seal up the entrance and wait for them to fall into the trap.\u201d Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>\u201cBig Bro, rest assured! You can keep your heart at ease when we are put to the task! Camping for food as such is something that we are most skilled at!\u201d Qiu Zhanyu said.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded his head in satisfaction. This was called not letting even a single one off.</p><br/><p>Thereafter, Lin Fan strode right into the tremors of the void without any hesitation as his figure gradually disappeared from the face of the world.</p></div>\n</div>"}

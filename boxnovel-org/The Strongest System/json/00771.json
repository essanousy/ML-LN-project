That's weird. That's weird! Why do I have a feeling of being collateral damage right now?!\"</p><br/><p>For some unknown reason, Lin Fan felt as though this issue had something to do with him! But that shouldn't be the case! Yours Truly was such a low profiled person who is extremely principled when it came to doing things, and would never ever commit crimes!</p><br/><p>Wang Family?</p><br/><p>Saint Devil Sect?</p><br/><p>Jiuxiao Sect?</p><br/><p>Well, Lin Fan couldn't deny that the last two names DID have some relation to him. But what in the world was that first name?</p><br/><p>What the sh*t was this Wang Family?</p><br/><p>Lin Fan couldn't figure it out at all. But, since this elderly person had already captured those two chicks, Lin Fan might as well just follow him and check out just what the situation was.</p><br/><p>Heaven Mountain City\u2026</p><br/><p>This was originally just like any other city, and wasn't all that famous. However, they had progressed rapidly in the past few years, and were now one of the largest cities in the entire Xuanhuang World.</p><br/><p>\"Guys, look! They've caught those two girls back!\"</p><br/><p>\"Hais, what a tragedy! I wonder how they will have to suffer for offending the Wang Family.\"</p><br/><p>\"That's right. Those two girls are disciples of the Flower Stream Sect. However, compared to the Wang Family, the Flower Stream Sect is just like a toddler! There's no way to put them together at all! And take a look! Isn't that the Grandmaster of the Flower Stream Sect? By the looks of it, she seems to be here to help them plead for forgiveness!\"</p><br/><p>Along the way at the Heaven Mountain City, the crowd began to clamor in discussions. It wasn't long before those two captured girls were brought to the Wang Family.</p><br/><p>As for Lin Fan, he stood outside the Wang Family, and was startled when he caught sight of two stone lions. There was some mysterious hidden power stored within the stone lions.</p><br/><p>Even though the power was practically insignificant for Lin Fan, it was something that no one from the Xuanhuang World could stand up against at all.</p><br/><p>\"Holy f*ck! I've just remembered this! Isn't this the blessings of the Heaven's Will!?\"</p><br/><p>\"Wang Family\u2026WANG XIAOLIU?\"</p><br/><p>At this point, Lin Fan finally had some memories jolting back into him. After spending five years in the Ancient Saint World, he had long forgotten about some stuff.</p><br/><p>Now that he was at a familiar place once more, it triggered some memories within his heart.</p><br/><p>\"Holy f*ck! The powerful backing of the Wang Family they were talking about, don't tell me that it's me?\"</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Lin Fan remembered this incident.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan could vaguely recall that before he left this place, he had allowed the Heaven's Will to bless down on the Wang's Family and suppress any weak beings who would dare to go against them.</p><br/><p>Back in the sect, Lin Fan had made a promise. Therefore, it was only natural for him to fulfill his promise. But now that he thought clearer about it, those words that he had said were extremely insane!</p><br/><p>Blessings of the Heaven's Will?!</p><br/><p>In the Xuanhuang World, the Heaven's Will was the biggest boss of them all!</p><br/><p>To be able to obtain the blessings of the Heaven's Will, wouldn't their powers be just godlike?</p><br/><p>\"Holy f*ck! This Wang Xiaoliu must have done all sorts of bad things, resulting in all the retribution of karma that ends up coming to Yours Truly!\"</p><br/><p>\"That's why Yours Truly found it weird. Ever since I headed up to the Ancient Saint World, I didn't have a good day passing by at all. I was either hunted down by this or chased down by that as though I was born with one hell of a face worth being taunted at!\"</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Within the living room\u2026</p><br/><p>The Family Head of the Wang Family sat in the middle. On the right side were delegates of the Wang Family, which were all pretty strong. There were even some of them that were of Greater celestial cultivation states.</p><br/><p>Thud.</p><br/><p>Housekeeper Long tossed Qin Yue'er and the other girl over.</p><br/><p>\"Family Head, I've brought them back.\" The elderly person greeted respectfully.</p><br/><p>\"Yes.\" The Family Head of the Wang Family nodded his head. He then looked at the two girls for a moment before putting down his tea cup slowly, \"Do you girls know that that single kick of yours nearly took the life of my son?\"</p><br/><p>\"Hmph! He would have deserved death.\" Qin Yue'er tossed her head and scoffed coldly.</p><br/><p>\"BRAZEN!\"</p><br/><p>The moment Housekeeper Long heard these words, he was angered and wanted to raise his hand, but was stopped by the Wang Family Head.</p><br/><p>\"You don't have to act so hypocritically. If you want to kill me, come at it. I, Qin Yue'er, am a woman that bears responsibilities for her actions. This has to involve no one else.\"</p><br/><p>\"Yue'er, what are you saying!? Wang Family Head, on account that she's just an ignorant young teenage girl, please spare her life!\" Old Lady Flower Stream spoke up.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan remained hidden in the void and watched everything before him. He could not help but sigh out. This chick's temperament was quite hot, gosh!</p><br/><p>But now that he hadn't seen this guy for quite some years, Wang Xiaoliu did look like quite the somebody now, donning the robes of the Family Head.</p><br/><p>And Wang Xiaoliu was still the old Wang Xiaoliu of the past, without many changes.</p><br/><p>Seemed like the only one who has changed must be that son of his.</p><br/><p>\"Young Master, Young Master! Your wounds have yet to recover!\" Just at this moment, a figure burst into the living room.</p><br/><p>\"You smelly b*tch! How dare you injure me?\" The moment he heard that the woman criminal who had crippled him was captured, Wang Xiaoming hurried over in a huff.</p><br/><p>\"Shut up.\" The Wang Family Head roared out. However, Wang Xiaoming wasn't afraid of him in the slightest bit.</p><br/><p>\"Father! We've already captured them! You've got to seek revenge for me! Our Wang Family is not one that can be bullied this easily!\" Wang Xiaoming yelled out.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the Wang Xiaoming before him. For a moment or so, he could not link this person before him with the memories of that little boy in his head.</p><br/><p>How did he change so much in just five years?</p><br/><p>The Xuanhuang World placed the utmost importance on martial arts.</p><br/><p>Therefore, when most kids were around twelve or thirteen years old, the blood within their bodies would start rumbling, resulting in a speedy growth, with which, they would look like an adult by then.</p><br/><p>\"Pericelestial lower level cultivation state... Seems like all of this has gone to the dogs!\"</p><br/><p>Looking at the behavior of Wang Xiaoming from within the void, Lin Fan shook his head in disagreement.</p><br/><p>\"However, for this lad to be so arrogant and tyrannical and yet remain alive after all these while, seems like I'm the one who played a big part in this.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan vaguely recalled that five years ago when this kid had called him uncle, that was the very moment his virtually non-existent fortune had suddenly skyrocketed up into the Heavens.</p><br/><p>From there on, he was blessed with a good fortune that would render him matchless. If he were to meet with Gods, he would kill the Gods. If he met with Buddhas, he would kill the Buddhas.</p><br/><p>\"Wang Xiaoming! What goes around comes around! That is the way of karma! You will definitely receive yours!\" Qin Yue'er cursed him in rage.</p><br/><p>\"Karma? I, Wang Xiaoming, have never been afraid of karma!\" Wang Xiaoming scoffed coldly before turning around, \"Father! I am going to seal up her cultivation state! Hand her over to me!\"</p><br/><p>\"Young Master Wang, please give this old lady here some face!\" The moment Old Lady Flower Stream saw everything that was happening, she could not help but speak up.</p><br/><p>\"This time around, I'm giving face to NO ONE! This b*tch has whacked me so hard that I nearly lost my life!\" Wang Xiaoming waved his hand dismissively, giving them zero respect at all.</p><br/><p>\"Don't come over!\" When Qin Yue'er saw how Wang Xiaoming was making his way towards her, she snarled out in rage.</p><br/><p>\"Hmph! Whack me? I'll let you know later on what are the consequences of whacking me!\" Wang Xiaoming laughed out coldly.</p><br/><p>Looking at the behavior of his own son, Wang Xiaoliu could not help but shake his head and sigh. He wanted to speak up. Now that his son was alright, he did not intend to pursue this matter any further.</p><br/><p>But just at this moment, Wang Xiaoliu was stunned.</p><br/><p>Qin Yue'er laughed out frostily as her aura started rising. At the same time, there were some white pills floating around her body.</p><br/><p>\"Jiuxiao Godly Thunder Pills!\"</p><br/><p>The moment everyone present saw those few white pills, the color from their faces drained out.</p><br/><p>This Jiuxiao Godly Thunder Pills were weapons of the Jiuxiao Sect! If they were to explode, even Greater celestial beings would receive some damage!</p><br/><p>\"You hedonistic being. You shall go to hell with me!\" Qin Yue'er had already made up her mind. If she were to end up in the hands of this hedonistic person, she could not even dare to imagine her state.</p><br/><p>She might as well self destruct here. If she could bring him along, that would be for the best.</p><br/><p>\"Son, watch out!\" Wang Xiaoliu bolted upright immediately. His cultivation state wasn't all that high. Despite how extraordinary the status of the Wang Family was, the cultivation state of Wang Xiaoliu was nothing more than a Pericelestial lower level right now.</p><br/><p>If these Jiuxiao Godly Thunder Pills were to explode, other than the Greater celestial beings present, everyone else might probably die!</p><br/><p>Indeed, a maddened woman was the scariest thing in the entire world.</p><br/><p>\"Master! Your disciple here does not wish to suffer in humiliation with junior sister here! This is the only way!\" Qin Yue'er looked at the Old Lady Flower Stream with tears in her eyes as she prodded the Jiuxiao Godly Thunder Pills furiously.</p><br/><p>\"It's too late\u2026!\"</p><br/><p>All the delegates from the Wang Family wanted to repress that power down. But it was all too late now.</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan caught sight of everything before him, he could not help but shake his head helplessly. Flicking his finger, the entire void froze up. The Jiuxiao Godly Thunder Pills that were about to explode dropped down onto the ground, perfect as they were before.</p><br/><p>\"How could this be!?\"</p><br/><p>At this moment, Qin Yue'er's face was frightfully pale. She hadn't expected things to end up like this! Housekeeper Long snapped back to his senses and held down Qin Yue'er immediately.</p><br/><p>\"You damned b*tch, how dare you try to drag Your Young Master here to death with you?\" Wang Xiaoming was angered right now as he hurled a punch out towards Qin Yue'er.</p><br/><p>Qin Yue'er shut her eyes gently as though she was hoping for a quick release.</p><br/><p>But just at this moment, the voice of the hedonistic Young Master rang out.</p><br/><p>\"Let go of me! LET GO OF ME!\"</p><br/><p>There seemed to be an invisible hand that was grabbing Wang Xiaoming to hang up in the void. His feet were lifted off the ground unable to move at all.</p><br/><p>\"WHO IS IT!?\"</p><br/><p>At this moment, everyone was startled. To think that there could be someone hidden here and yet they didn't sense anything at all!</p><br/><p>\"Hais\u2026\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

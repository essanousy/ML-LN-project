This was an aura that shouldn\u2019t be present on mere mortals. In fact, there was even a Killing Demonic God formed in the void just from the aura emanating from these soldiers.</p><br/><p>Feng Yanyun felt her heart tense up at the sight of this as well. She then looked over at the both of them, \u201cHow is the aura of these soldiers from the Yue Country so formidable?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBe careful! There must be some problems within.\u201d Qiu Zhanyu warned cautiously.</p><br/><p>Within the deepest parts of the Yue Army, he could sense two incredibly strong auras. At the same time, these were two auras that he was familiar with. They must have fought with one another before.</p><br/><p>Eventually, the Heaven and Earth Net had caused the other party to retreat the last time.</p><br/><p>\u201cHAHAHA\u2026!\u201d At this moment, a frenzied laughter rang out from within the Yue Army. Two figures floated up into the void and glared over at Qiu Zhanyu and the others.</p><br/><p>\u201cQiu Zhanyu! Jin Zhengu! Both of you had better come and prepare yourselves for death!\u201d Coming forth along with that berserk voice was a boundless power that rattled the entire world.</p><br/><p>The power of just that voice alone caused a shockwave to sweep across the soldiers of the Maple Forest City.</p><br/><p>Qiu Zhanyu took a single step forth and dissipated the shockwave with his palm, \u201cTo think that it would be you two.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course! It has been a couple of months since that battle from back then. Today, along with my junior brother, we are here to give a test to the strength of the two of you.\u201d Luo Li roared out in laughter madly.</p><br/><p>Qiu Zhanyu and Jin Zhengu took a step forth and stood tall in the void. They then whispered to one another, \u201cWatch out! Those two fellas are not our match at all. But, the fact that they dare to head here today must mean that they\u2019ve got some sort of a backing up their sleeves.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph! The Yue Army wants to invade our Maple Forest City? As long as the two of us brothers are around, none of you shall succeed!\u201d Jin Zhengu roared out.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that so?\u201d Luo Li chuckled out softly before casting his glance over at Feng Yanyun, \u201cThe ruler of the Maple Leaf City is truly decent indeed. You will be more than enough for me to take home and use as a slave! HAHA!\u201d</p><br/><p>The sinister laughter was relentless as he swept his robes aside, \u201cGo!\u201d</p><br/><p>As though they were boosted with some mysterious aura, the Yue Army roared out endlessly while rushing out like human-shaped beasts.</p><br/><p>Pshew!</p><br/><p>\u201cCourting death!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHeaven and Earth Net!\u201d</p><br/><p>Qiu Zhanyu and Jin Zhengu roared out as the powers within their bodies rumbled out. The Heaven and Earth Net floated out gently in the void and covered the entire sky in an instant, enveloping everyone from the gigantic army of the Yue Country together.</p><br/><p>This was the might of a Supreme Grade Immortal Weapon.</p><br/><p>Since both of them were at the True Immortal state full cultivation level, the might of the Supreme Grade Immortal Weapon was raised as well.</p><br/><p>Even though they still could not unleash its full potential, this might here was not something that the Luo Brothers could deal with at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cHAHA! Do you guys think that we\u2019ve got nothing up our sleeves anymore?\u201d Luo Li burst out laughing before he turned over to the void and shouted out, \u201cOld Master Infernal Requiem\u2026 please strike out!\u201d</p><br/><p>At this point, Qiu Zhanyu and Jin Zhengu were completely taken aback.</p><br/><p>\u201cFabulous! It\u2019s a Supreme Grade Immortal Weapon indeed! In the hands of those two, the Immortal Treasure\u2019s potential is completely being wasted! It\u2019s only in the hands of Your Old Master Infernal Requiem that it can unleash its fullest might!\u201d A chilling aura surged through the entire void.</p><br/><p>An elderly man who was standing atop a dragon formed from Ominous Qi flitted over and appeared in the void.</p><br/><p>\u201cOld Master Inferno Requiem!\u201d When Qiu Zhanyu and Jin Zhengu caught sight of this elderly man, their faces changed completely. This was a reputable Old Master who was a Golden Immortal being!</p><br/><p>Qiu Zhanyu and Jin Zhengu had not expected that something as such would happen! To think that the Luo Brothers would be able to invite over such a horrifying existence!</p><br/><p>At this moment, Qiu Zhanyu and Jin Zhengu were not the only astounded ones! Even Feng Yanyun\u2019s face was aghast. The elderly man who was always by Feng Yanyun\u2019s side felt his sweat pouring down his back as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cOld Master Inferno Requiem is a Golden Immortal being! Why is he interfering in the affairs of mere mortals?\u201d The elderly man asked in horror.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis Supreme Grade Immortal Weapon shall belong to me then!\u201d The Old Master Inferno Requiem burst out into laughter as he opened his palm wide, causing the Laws of a Golden Immortal to ripple over.</p><br/><p>This was a Supreme Grade Immortal Weapon, something that was extraordinary. If both of them had the strength of Mystic Immortal state, perhaps even the Old Master Inferno Requiem might find this getting a little tricky.</p><br/><p>But, things were different right now. Both of them were merely True Immortal state beings. If they wanted to protect this Supreme Grade Immortal Weapon, they would truly be dreaming.</p><br/><p>\u201cHAHA! Your deaths are here!\u201d Luo Li burst out in laughter as he slashed out at Qiu Zhanyu and Jin Zhengu.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>At this moment within the secret chamber\u2026</p><br/><p>There was already a deeply dug underground abyss right now. A bed was lain there, ever so eye-catching to look at. The figure on the bed was motionless as though it was a living dead man right there.</p><br/><p>But just at this moment, that motionless figure jerked both his eyes wide open all of a sudden and shouted out with vulgarities.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*cking hell! This Boundless Future Buddha Lord is really way too bloody devious! To think that a mere strain of his consciousness was able to trap Yours Truly for such a long time!\u201d Lin Fan cussed out.</p><br/><p>However, he was extremely pleased with the end result.</p><br/><p>After he took down the consciousness of the Boundless Future Buddha Lord, Lin Fan gained an incredible amount of experience points!</p><br/><p>But all of a sudden, Lin Fan was stunned. He had discovered that something was not right with his surroundings.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere in the bloody world is Yours Truly? Why the hell is this place pitch black?\u201d Lin Fan was taken aback. Gathering his powers, he illuminated the entire place.</p><br/><p>But when he caught sight of his surroundings, Lin Fan was stunned.</p><br/><p>Walls! Abyss! Lifting his head, there seemed to be a switch of some sort above him.</p><br/><p>BOOM!</p><br/><p>The ground quaked out as a figure bolted up from underground.</p><br/><p>\u2018Where is this place?! Where did those two Little Bros of mine die off to? To think that they would dare to keep their Old Bro underground! Did they really think that Yours Truly was dead?\u2019 Lin Fan cussed out in his heart. This was getting bloody awkward right now!</p><br/><p>He then checked out his surroundings.</p><br/><p>This place was slightly more foreign. He did not know where he was at all.</p><br/><p>He then floated up into the void and took in everything around him. For a moment, he was absolutely bewildered. Why was he in the middle of a city right now?</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, Lin Fan felt that there were some reverberations of powers being generated up ahead. He did not know what was going on at all.</p><br/><p>When he stepped out, he found a figure running off furiously on the ground.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan landed down immediately and grabbed hold of the person while asking, \u201cOi, where is this place?\u201d</p><br/><p>When the person who was sprinting caught sight of Lin Fan, he was stunned, \u201cThis is the Maple Forest City! There\u2019s a war happening outside already! And, we seem to be on the losing end! Hurry up and run!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaple Forest City?\u201d</p><br/><p>Just where in the world was this place?</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was befuddled at this point. Where in the world did Qiu Zhanyu and Jin Zhengu die off to? They couldn\u2019t have cast him away because they thought he was too troublesome to deal with, could they?</p><br/><p>But, he took a look at the clothes on his body. They were neat and proper as though they had just been cleaned recently. Seemed like there had been people taking care of him.</p><br/><p>\u201cForget it! Those can wait. Time to check out just what is happening outside first.\u201d Lin Fan dove into the void and headed over to the direction where all the commotion was happening.</p><br/><p>If Lin Fan had known that the Boundless Future Buddha Lord had f*cked up three entire years of his time, he would have scolded the hell out of that piece of sh*t.</p><br/><p>On the battlefield\u2026</p><br/><p>Bam!</p><br/><p>Bam!</p><br/><p>Just like bullets, Qiu Zhanyu and Jin Zhengu were sent flying and digging straight into the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cHAHA! Without the Supreme Grade Immortal Weapon, you guys are nothing but ants!\u201d The Luo Brothers laughed out wildly. They opened their mouths side and sucked in, taking in all the five Qis that were formed in the surroundings into their tummies.</p><br/><p>Qiu Zhanyu and Jin Zhengu struggled to stand still. Spitting out a mouthful of fresh blood, they looked up into the void.</p><br/><p>The Supreme Grade Immortal Weapon was being held down by the Old Master Inferno Requiem entirely, and refused to listen to their commands.</p><br/><p>When Feng Yanyun caught sight of this, her face was filled with a look of despair as well. It was over. It was truly over this time around.</p><br/><p>But just at this moment, a mighty voice boomed out of the void.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy did you two fellas bury Yours Truly underground!\u201d</p><br/><p>When Qiu Zhanyu heard this voice, that frightfully pale face of his suddenly turned ecstatic! He yelled out, \u201cBig Bro! You\u2019re finally awake! Hurry and come save us! We\u2019re about to be whacked to death by others!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Who bloody has the guts to whack my Little Bros?\u201d The moment Lin Fan heard this, he was pissed. Bloody hell! Wasn\u2019t this just not giving Yours Truly any face at all?</p><br/><p>When the despairing Feng Yanyun looked up into the void, her face turned into one of confusion.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust which ant is this yet again? How dare\u2026\u201d Luo Li raised his head and barked out. But, before he could finish with his words, a gigantic palm strike hurled out at his face.</p><br/><p>\u201cCourting death!\u201d Lin Fan snorted out coldly.</p><br/><p>BAM!</p><br/><p>An explosion rang out as Luo Li turned into a puddle of blood instantly, dying in a worse way than he could have ever expected.</p><br/><p>From the start till his end, he didn\u2019t even have a chance to react at all.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Feng Yanyun was just dumbfounded.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

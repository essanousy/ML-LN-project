This was evidently to get that Scarlet Blood Demon Saber in the latter\u2019s hands.</p><br/><p>If this were anyone else, they would most likely be dead right here. But, since this was Lin Fan, he was undoubtedly just courting death.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan turned around and sliced out with the Scarlet Blood Demon Saber. A torrential Blood Qi gushed out from it, intertwining into a straight line that attacked out at Ling Wuzun.</p><br/><p>\u201cJunior brother, don\u2019t be rash now!\u201d When Su Hongchen caught sight of this scene, she yelped out in shock. She hadn\u2019t expected that things would come to this.</p><br/><p>This Ling Wuzun here was a Remnant! Not only that, his cultivation was extremely profound! Even that Xue Tianzi wouldn\u2019t be a match for him!</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph! To think that a single Inner Sect disciple would dare to strike out at me. I wonder who gave you those guts.\u201d Ling Wuzun was enraged right now. As he slapped out with a single palm strike, it seemed as though the surrounding void was crushed down by some immense pressure, breaking apart bit by bit.</p><br/><p>The surrounding disciples exclaimed out.</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior Brother Ling\u2019s going at it for real right now! Seems like that fella is about to get crippled!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure senior brother isn\u2019t going to take his life. However, he will definitely make sure that he teaches that guy how to be a proper disciple.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe demonic nature of that Scarlet Blood Demon Saber is immense. As an Inner Sect disciple, what capabilities does he even have to be able to withstand its demonic nature? If that thing is left in his hands, the Heaven and Earth Sect will definitely be filled with a bloodthirsty maniac for sure!\u201d Jian Fengchen said.</p><br/><p>The strength of Ling Wuzun was something that Lin Fan had total disregard for. This cultivation state of his wasn\u2019t even as strong as those people that Lin Fan had met back in the secret ground eleven years ago.</p><br/><p>Clang!</p><br/><p>Even though this Scarlet Blood Demon Saber was a treasure of Xue Tianzi and had a direct connection with him, ever since Lin Fan killed him, it had already been subdued in the latter\u2019s hands.</p><br/><p>\u2018Huh?!\u2019</p><br/><p>This Ling Wuzun had truly overestimated his worth. He thought that Lin Fan\u2019s strength would amount to nothing much. But, when that saber gleam actually clashed with his palm, his face changed entirely.</p><br/><p>\u2018How could this be?\u2019</p><br/><p>Everything in its path withered and died, leaving destruction in its wake. The saber gleam so sharp that it seemed as if nothing could stand in its way. Even that palm of Ling Wuzun was sliced apart by Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Ling Wuzun\u2019s pupils dilated as the blood red gleam approached him. At the same time, that extremely sharp Saber Qi slashed out at him as well. Before the saber had even reached him, the Saber Qi had already arrived.</p><br/><p>When this extremely sharp Saber Qi sliced out on Ling Wuzun\u2019s face, it stung as though his skin was torn apart.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan\u2019s lips curled into a cold grin. An existence as such was something he could take down with the back of his hands.</p><br/><p>When Hu Qing caught sight of this, he was absolutely alarmed. It was as though he could not even begin to imagine the consequences of his Junior Brother Lin if he killed this Ling Wuzun.</p><br/><p>\u201cJunior Brother Lin, stop it\u2026!\u201d Hu Qing yelled.</p><br/><p>Shing!</p><br/><p>By the time Ling Wuzun reacted to it, the saber gleam had already arrived at his throat.</p><br/><p>That blood red saber gleam was extremely cold and bone chilling. Through it, Ling Wuzun could feel the cold blooded intent behind it.</p><br/><p>Gulp!</p><br/><p>Ling Wuzun\u2019s throat bobbed up and down as a single bead of sweat flowed down his forehead ever so slowly.</p><br/><p>He was starting to feel fear in his heart right now.</p><br/><p>When Jian Fengchen caught sight of this, his face was drained of color as well. He hadn\u2019t expected that Senior Brother Ling would not be a match for this fella. And not only that, the other party had even stuck a saber gleam right at this throat!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you trying to do? This is Remnant Senior Brother Ling! As an Inner Sect disciple, what are you trying to do?\u201d Jian Fengchen barked out with all the courage he could muster.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d Lin Fan\u2019s brows furrowed as he shot a single glance over at Jian Fengchen.</p><br/><p>Startled, Jian Fengchen stumbled back a few steps in fear. In his eyes, this man before him was way too horrifying.</p><br/><p>All the other surrounding disciples were completely filled with fright right now as well, totally unable to believe in the scene before them.</p><br/><p>Senior Brother Ling was a Remnant! How in the world could he be defeated this easily?</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, Ling Wuzun wanted to speak up. However, he was cut short by Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t speak now.\u201d Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>Hu Qing rushed up immediately and came beside Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>\u201cJunior Brother Lin, you mustn\u2019t kill him! Otherwise, things will be real bad!\u201d Hu Qing told him.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy now? Could something big happen out of me killing him?\u201d Lin Fan chuckled out.</p><br/><p>\u201cJunior Brother Lin, the sect rules decree that as long as it is a fellow disciple, you must never harm his or her life. If you have some life and death hatred, you can settle it through a duel as long as things don\u2019t get lethal.\u201d Hu Qing replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, I see. So, that\u2019s the way it is.\u201d Lin Fan nodded his head. Now, this was interesting.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking of doing?\u201d Ling Wuzun\u2019s face was drained of color as his expression tightened up.</p><br/><p>If there were no one surrounding them right now, Lin Fan would have just killed this fella decisively. But right now, the situation was a little troublesome.</p><br/><p>\u201cNumber forty eight on the True Immortal Substitute Roll, yet that\u2019s all you amount to.\u201d Lin Fan laughed out coldly. He then slapped out furiously towards Ling Wuzun with a single palm.</p><br/><p>BAM!</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019d dare?\u201d Ling Wuzun hadn\u2019t expected that the other party would dare to strike at him.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat would I not dare? Since a fella like you dares to snatch the Scarlet Blood Demon Saber, you were just courting death to begin with.\u201d Raising his leg swiftly, Lin Fan swung it out at Ling Wuzun\u2019s face instantly.</p><br/><p>With that, a series of tragic cries rang out.</p><br/><p>When the surrounding disciples caught sight of this scene, their faces turned pale with fright. Was this guy seeking death?!</p><br/><p>This person before them was a Remnant! If he dared to treat the other party as such, wasn\u2019t he afraid of the consequences it might bring forth?</p><br/><p>Even though Ling Wuzun was the weakest out of all the Remnants out there, he was still a Remnant no matter what! Compared to those Inner Sect disciples, he was way stronger!</p><br/><p>Anyone who was able to get into the True Immortal Substitute Roll was a genius amongst geniuses. These were not individuals that ordinary people could hope to compare with.</p><br/><p>Even if it were Hu Qing combined with every single other disciple present, they were still no match for Ling Wuzun.</p><br/><p>And, the only reason why Lin Fan was able to take down the other party was that his own strength had already reached an extremely formidable state.</p><br/><p>If even someone of a True Immortal state could be defeated by Lin Fan, it was needless to talk about all these other people who were just skirting around the boundaries of Immemorial Ancient state.</p><br/><p>Only, there was one person on that True Immortal Substitute Roll that had Lin Fan feeling extremely wary towards. And that was the number one on the roll, Qin Shengjun.</p><br/><p>But, in the past eleven years when Lin Fan had been in the Endless Mainland, that Qin Shengjun had long broken through, and was no longer on this True Immortal Substitute Roll.</p><br/><p>Thus, Lin Fan was pretty curious as to the sort of existence that Qin Shengjun would be right now.</p><br/><p>As for the current number one of the True Immortal Substitute Roll, it wasn\u2019t someone of the Heaven and Earth Sect. That person belonged to some other sect.</p><br/><p>If there were a chance, Lin Fan would definitely love to exchange blows with someone like that.</p><br/><p>However, he did not know how far apart the difference between this person and Qin Shengjun would be.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>At this moment, Lin Fan did not hesitate as he trampled on Ling Wuzun\u2019s face till it was entirely swollen before he relented.</p><br/><p>\u201cJunior Brother Lin, that\u2019s about enough\u2026\u201d When Hu Qing caught sight of that once haughty looking Ling Wuzun, he could not help but breathe in a mouthful of cold air.</p><br/><p>Just what sort of a background did this Junior Brother Lin hail from? To think that he would be this overbearing! Wasn\u2019t he afraid that Ling Wuzun would find trouble for him after they headed back?</p><br/><p>However, Hu Qing did not feel that this would cause much of a ruckus back in the sect. At the same time, this Ling Wuzun knew that he was no match for Junior Brother Lin as well. Therefore, he should not seek out needless trouble for himself.</p><br/><p>Only, one must still always be on guard at all times. Otherwise, it wouldn\u2019t be good to suffer a disadvantage all for nothing.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. Let\u2019s head back then.\u201d</p><br/><p>This time around, Lin Fan had gained quite a bit from this Earth Abyssal Demon Cave, and felt that it was about time to leave as well.</p><br/><p>He then cast a last glance at that Ling Wuzun, who was walloped so badly he did not even look human anymore, and smirked out coldly.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

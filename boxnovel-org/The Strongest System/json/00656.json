Let go of me! Otherwise, you'll die without even a burial ground!\" The Fox Emperor, whose face was swollen entirely from the bashings, yelled out at Lin Fan's feet.</p><br/><p>When the eight old fogeys struck out together earlier on, it was a total bullying. There was no way they could fight back at all.</p><br/><p>But now that the Old Master of the Fox race was here, the Fox Emperor didn't feel fear any longer. In his opinion, the Old Master of the Fox race was the strongest existence there should be.</p><br/><p>Even though the Fox Emperor did not know why the Old Master of the Fox race did not strike out, in his eyes, the Motherf*cking Human King was no more than a dead man walking.</p><br/><p>From this day forth, he would definitely hunt this guy down relentlessly till he was dead.</p><br/><p>\"Why should I let them off?\" Lin Fan chuckled gently. If they were indignant, f*ck it all then!</p><br/><p>Even though these two fellas were really strong, Lin Fan wasn't afraid of them. At the most, he'd just die, wouldn't he? But, who was afraid of whom then?</p><br/><p>There had never been anyone who could force him to bow down. It didn't matter whether their strength was above his or not.</p><br/><p>At the most, they'd just go for a big round of f*ck-it-ups.</p><br/><p>\"What did you say!\" The Old Master of the Fox race was angered as he asked again harshly.</p><br/><p>\"You're trying to court death, eh? Even though there's someone watching over you, if you don't watch your attitude and know your place, you've got no one to blame for your death!\"</p><br/><p>\"HAHA!\" Lin Fan burst out laughing, \"Yours Truly, Lin Fan, has never ever required anyone's protection!\"</p><br/><p>Crack.</p><br/><p>\"HOW DARE YOU?\" The moment the Evil Alliance Patriarch and the Old Master of the Fox race caught sight of the scene before them, their faces changed immediately. However, it was all too late.</p><br/><p>The Evil Alliance Palace Master and the Fox Emperor were both killed by Lin Fan in the blink of an eye, and their bodies were cast into his Paradise.</p><br/><p>Within the Paradise, their Laws, physical bodies, Essence Spirit, et cetera\u2026 anything that was useful was all absorbed within the Paradise. There wasn't even a scrap of them that was left once everything was over.</p><br/><p>\"What do I not dare to? Isn't it just killing? If you've got the guts, come and f*ck me up! So what if you guys are divine celestial level 10, Eternal God state beings? Your Father here wasn't even afraid of the Utmost Being of the Ancient race&gt; Do you think Your Father would be scared of you guys?\" Lin Fan's figure flashed as he inched towards the stone sculpture of the Battle Emperor Sect gradually.</p><br/><p>\"Today, no one shall be able to spare you from our wrath! Go to hell!\" The Old Master of the Fox race was enraged right now as his ominous aura filled the sky endlessly. It materialized into a physical blow that struck down at Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>In the blink of an eye, that might of his encompassed the entire Heaven and blanketed the Earth. Even Lin Fan could feel this tremendous threat looming.</p><br/><p>At this moment, the eight old fogeys appeared instantly. As they retaliated with their eight palm strikes, the result was entirely earthshattering, holding back against the attacks of the Evil Alliance Patriarch and the Old Master of the Fox race.</p><br/><p>\"You're both at the Eternal God state. Do you guys really think you can bully me because I've got nothing up my sleeves?\" Lin Fan laughed out, using a single hand to take in that stone sculpture into his storage.</p><br/><p>After he had killed the Evil Alliance Palace Master and the Fox Emperor, he had gained quite a bit of benefits from them.</p><br/><p>With that, the experience points he had increased as well.</p><br/><p>\"You really think that these eight trashes will be able to safeguard your life? They're only good to see, but that's all they amount to. The Eternal God state isn't something an ant such as yourself can understand.\" The Evil Alliance Patriarch and the Old Master of the Fox race looked at these eight old fogeys as their eyes shone with a true disdain.</p><br/><p>In the blink of an eye, the Evil Alliance Patriarch bellowed out while his body started changing rapidly. Pointing out with his finger, a tiny spot of light exploded as it slammed out onto the body of one of the old fogeys.</p><br/><p>BAM!</p><br/><p>\"H-how did this happen?\"</p><br/><p>The moment Lin Fan caught sight of everything before him, he frowned. No matter what, these eight old fogeys were divine celestial level 10, Eternal God state beings as well!</p><br/><p>To think that one of them would start coughing out blood immensely after just a single strike from the Evil Alliance Patriarch! In fact, even his entire aura had withered down!</p><br/><p>\"Hmph! Flashy without any substance. Even though the eight of them are also Eternal God state beings, their bodies have long been emptied out. Against the face of a true Eternal God state being, they're as good as paper!\" The Old Master of the Fox race lambasted out.</p><br/><p>Opening his arms wide, a gigantic door from the Fox World opened up above his head. The door opened out as a horrifying Nine-Tailed Fox appeared, spitting a mouthful of fire with it.</p><br/><p>One of the old fogeys dodged immediately. However, he still received half a body's worth of burns.</p><br/><p>'Holy f*ck. I may have miscalculated this.' At this moment, it suddenly struck Lin Fan. Even though he might have repaired the cultivation roots of the old fogeys, it had been a really short time nevertheless. Therefore, even though they might be at the Eternal God state, their strength was definitely not up to the mark just yet.</p><br/><p>This was especially the case now that they were faced up with two peerlessly powerful beings such as the Evil Alliance Patriarch and the Old Master of the Fox race. They were just too weak in comparison!</p><br/><p>\"F*ck this sh*t! I've f*cked up!\" At this point, Lin Fan retreated instantly without thinking about anything. Turning into a streak of light, he activated So Near, Yet So Far to its maximum.</p><br/><p>\"Retreat!\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan did not have to hesitate at all. If he couldn't win against them, then he might as well run!</p><br/><p>\"You wanna run? Let's see how you can run now.\" The Evil Alliance Patriarch and the Old Master of the Fox race sneered coldly. Opening their gigantic hands, the entire world seemed to be shrinking down as though every last thing in this world was under their control.</p><br/><p>\"Eight Mortal Realms into One! Universe into One! Seal!\"</p><br/><p>In the blink of an eye, Lin Fan's face changed. To think that these two old fellas would seal up the Heaven and Earth, rendering him unable to escape at all!</p><br/><p>\"Yours Truly's not going to believe in this sh*t today!\"</p><br/><p>\"Nine Sword Wills! Destroy!\"</p><br/><p>Pointing out his finger, a tremendous Sword Will erupted out from Lin Fan. That finger was bent on destroying the boundaries of the seal.</p><br/><p>BOOM!</p><br/><p>A massive explosion caused Lin Fan to be deflected 100 miles away.</p><br/><p>'So resolute! To think that it would be useless!' Lin Fan's brows creased. He could sense that this was going to be troublesome.</p><br/><p>\"It's useless. You're not going to escape this place today. You shall never be able to understand the true might of the Eternal God state.\" The Evil Alliance Patriarch laughed wildly. His laughter was extremely creepy.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Lin Fan truly realized that the might of the Eternal God state wasn't something that could be described with mere words. In fact, it was already admirable that he was even able to withstand to this point with just a divine celestial level 5, Essence Spirit state to his name.</p><br/><p>If it were any other beings of his level, they might have already disintegrated just under the aura alone.</p><br/><p>If not for the fact that his reserves and background were firm, he might have been slain just by revealing his face alone.</p><br/><p>\"Paradise, shrink! Boundless energy!\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan wasn't going to bother exchanging blows with these two guys. Instead, he concentrated his energy and had it burst forth at the confinement.</p><br/><p>BAM!</p><br/><p>\"Dumb thing! You're not going to be able to run.\"</p><br/><p>All of a sudden, Lin Fan realized that the space around him was starting to firm and harden up. His blood, powers, Essence Spirit, etc\u2026 everything was solidifying.</p><br/><p>\"Shengyang Pills! Incinerate all of them!\"</p><br/><p>\"Demon City!\"</p><br/><p>\"Flying Heavens!\"</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>\"All of you, go blow up this barrier!\"</p><br/><p>At this moment, Lin Fan's powers climbed repeatedly. The Big Ancient Demon howled out furiously as his powers went into a frenzy.</p><br/><p>Slamming out with a punch, he shattered the entire solidified space.</p><br/><p>\"Bloody f*ck! I'm going to turn into a pauper once more! Evil Alliance Patriarch, Old Master of the Fox race, you two damned fellas! One day, I'll have both of you piercing one another after swallowing my Biggra!\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan's heart was throbbing right now. These were his complete savings!</p><br/><p>\"Just what sort of a background does this lad have? Even though his cultivation state isn't that high, how in the world could he cause such an immense amount of power to erupt forth?\" The Old Master of the Fox race felt his spirits rattled.</p><br/><p>\"No matter his background, we've got to kill him!\"</p><br/><p>\"Alright. Sever!\"</p><br/><p>Instantly, Lin Fan could feel the hair on his back standing up. He was being locked up a series of sharp flashes.</p><br/><p>As he caught sight of the Old Master of the Fox race moving all ten of his fingers, ten beams of light pierced through the void at him. It was as though the entire void was about to be sliced open.</p><br/><p>This was the skill of severing. Once it was cultivated to a certain state, it could sever anything from time and space to even the future.</p><br/><p>For the Old Master of the Fox race, it didn't matter how strong this Motherf*cking Human King was. He would still have to bury his grudges in here today.</p><br/><p>BOOM!</p><br/><p>The Heavens and Earth trembled as a series of explosions rang out.</p><br/><p>\"Motherf*cking Human King! Today, I shall have you turn into the Motherf*cking Dead Dog!\"</p><br/><p>But just at this moment, something caused the Evil Alliance Patriarch and the Old Master of the Fox race to be stunned.</p><br/><p>\"Just what in the world is this?\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

If Lin Fan wanted him to die or live, he would die or live. There was simply no chance of him resisting at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Who would have thought that the utmost powerful being, Old Master Thunder, would have been purified by someone just like that? If any of the other utmost powerful beings were to find out about this, their hearts might even jump out of their chest from the blow.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I were to kill this Old Master Thunder, I might be able to reach an Immemorial Ancient state upper level. But, this Old Master Thunder did remind me that he\u2019s of great value!\u201d Lin Fan\u2019s heart leaped with joy as all sorts of ploys started popping in his mind.</p><br/><p>Eventually, he decided on the best plan of them all. This was a plan that would allow him to turn into a God with a single thought.</p><br/><p>Whether or not he could turn into a God would all depend on the Old Master Thunder right now.</p><br/><p>\u201cLay out a Heaven and Earth barrier with me.\u201d Lin Fan ordered.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d The Old Master Thunder did not have to hesitate as he sent out a mysterious Power of Thunder that rose into the air and laid out across the endless void before turning into seals one after another.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan pointed out with his finger as the Source Sealing Technique burst forth. This was the fundamental of Sealing the Heaven and Earth.</p><br/><p>\u201cPower of Biggra.\u201d</p><br/><p>That odorless and colorless mist seeped into the endless void as well.</p><br/><p>At this moment, it was as though an entire spiderweb was laid out, blanketing the whole sky. Every single thread of it glistened with light and was filled with an unlimited amount of sealing powers.</p><br/><p>After god knows how long, it was only once the Heaven and Earth Seal of this entire place had reached its pinnacle state that Lin Fan stopped his actions.</p><br/><p>\u201cWith this seal here right now, it\u2019d be easy for anyone to get in\u2026 But getting out? That\u2019s another issue altogether.\u201d Lin Fan was extremely pleased with everything right now.</p><br/><p>\u201cOld Master Thunder, call over all the utmost powerful beings that you had once summoned and grouped up with.\u201d This time around, Lin Fan was prepared to go big on this.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d The Old Master Thunder nodded his head before countless streams of his consciousness extended out into the void.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Ancestor has already captured the Motherf*cking Human King. Fellow utmost powerful beings, please come forth and give me a hand.\u201d</p><br/><p>Instantly, all of these streams of consciousness spread in all directions. It didn\u2019t take long before the void started trembling.</p><br/><p>\u201cOld Master Thunder, to think that you would inform Your Ancestor here about it. You\u2019re really a dependable person.\u201d A gigantic crocodile descended down into the world as those gigantic claws ripped the void open before extending slowly.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat is for sure! Even though the events of the previous time were a misunderstanding, Your Ancestor here naturally has to make some amends to you.\u201d The Old Master Thunder said.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha! Not bad! From this day forth, we\u2019ll write everything off!\u201d The Old Master Crocodile burst out laughing as he looked at this Motherf*cking Human King before him with lustful eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is indeed that Motherf*cking Human King. After taking all of those Legendary Items for yourself, it\u2019s time you spit them out today!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTo think that the Old Master Crocodile would have been a step earlier than me.\u201d Lucifer arrived as a godly radiance shone down on the entire world. When he felt the sealing of the void nearby, he was slightly bothered with it at the start.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis seal\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis Human is crafty beyond anything else and has escaped from the hands of Your Ancestor one too many times. This time around, Your Ancestor laid down an entire Heaven and Earth Formation Seal. Let\u2019s see how he runs from this now.\u201d The Old Master Thunder said with confidence.</p><br/><p>Following closely after, a thousand feet long Water Dragon spiraled over. This was the Old Master Water Dragon who had arrived.</p><br/><p>\u201cOld Master Thunder, to think that you would have captured this Motherf*cking Human King.\u201d At this moment, the Old Master Devouring Heavens arrived as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cI, the Drought Demonic God, have arrived!\u201d A Demonic God of the Ancient race descended. And beside him stood yet another Demonic God as well.</p><br/><p>This was the Extreme Heavens Demonic God of the Ancient race.</p><br/><p>Most probably, the Drought Demonic God was worried that his strength might not be enough alone, and hence, decided to bring along someone of his own race.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Old Master Devouring Heavens, Lucifer, Drought Demonic God, Extreme Heavens Demonic God, Old Master Water Dragon, Old Master Crocodile and Old Master Thunder\u2026 This made up a total of seven utmost powerful beings.</p><br/><p>Looking at the number of utmost powerful beings who had descended, Lin Fan\u2019s lips curled into a cold grin.</p><br/><p>\u201cSeems like all of you are accounted for.\u201d Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>\u201cMotherf*cking Human King, hand over the Legendary Items! Between the Heaven and Earth here, you have nowhere to run now!\u201d The Old Master Water Dragon said grimly.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. In the hands of seven of us, it\u2019s not as though you can still run away once more, can you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause of our carelessness the previous time around, you had managed to escape once. But, you\u2019re not going to get lucky again!\u201d</p><br/><p>Under the combined forces of these seven utmost powerful beings, no matter who it was, they would definitely have to fall. However, for Lin Fan, even though there were only seven utmost powerful beings here, this still beat having only a single one of them around.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked over at the Old Master Thunder before laughing out calmly, \u201cSince you guys want the Legendary Items, come and get them then.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSuppress him!\u201d The Old Master Thunder roared out and struck out first. Next, the other utmost powerful beings followed suit.</p><br/><p>At the exact moment when all the other utmost powerful beings had struck out, the Old Master Thunder seized the chance when they weren\u2019t paying attention to stand back slightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cHAHA! It\u2019s not as though I could be afraid of you guys! Come and whack me if you\u2019ve got the guts!\u201d Lin Fan\u2019s heart leaped with joy before he squatted down while covering his head.</p><br/><p>BOOM!</p><br/><p>Six utmost powerful beings surrounded Lin Fan entirely and came forth with formidable attacks one after another, raining them down onto his body.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Lin Fan could only feel that his luck was simply way too good. If not for the fact that the Great Sage had helped him to level his Physical Body State to Immemorial Ancient full cultivation state, he might have been beaten to death physically by these six utmost powerful beings here.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuman\u2026 If you don\u2019t wish to die here and now, hand over those Legendary Items!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re f*cking dreaming! Whack me to death if you\u2019ve got the guts!\u201d Lin Fan covered his head before lying flat on the ground, allowing them to whack as they pleased.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph! Courting death!\u201d The six utmost powerful beings focused all of their attention onto the body of this Motherf*cking Human King here. To all of them, those Legendary Items of the Heaven and Earth were treasures amongst treasures.</p><br/><p>But, to think that this Motherf*cking Human King would have obtained all of them! How could they possibly endure something like this?</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, Yours Truly IS courting death! Come and f*ck up Your Daddy to death if you can!\u201d Lin Fan roared out.</p><br/><p>Leg after leg, they rained down kicks onto Lin Fan\u2019s body. Lin Fan hugged onto the thighs of one of the utmost powerful beings right now and continued, \u201cCome on! Kick me to death!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn it! Let go of Your Ancestor, you damned Human!\u201d</p><br/><p>Bam! Wham! Pow! Bish!</p><br/><p>Lin Fan covered his face with his palms and allowed the utmost powerful beings to whack as they wanted. Either way, even if he were to brawl it out with them, he wouldn\u2019t be able to win it straight up. He might as well let them beat him to their heart\u2019s pleasure.</p><br/><p>After all, Yours Truly was a good person! These were already their final moments, so it was good to let them vent out all the Desolate powers within their bodies right now!</p><br/><p>Time passed by the seconds and minutes\u2026</p><br/><p>Soon, the six utmost powerful beings discovered that this Human was too damned bloody resilient! For a moment or so, even they felt a tad tired.</p><br/><p>\u201cOld Master Thunder, I heard that your Dao of the Thunder can torment one\u2019s heart and soul! How about you give it a\u2026 try?\u201d Suddenly, the Old Master Devouring Heavens thought of the Old Master Thunder. But, when he discovered that the Old Master Thunder was not around them, he started looking left and right for the latter\u2019s presence.</p><br/><p>All of a sudden, the Old Master Devouring Heavens realized that the Old Master Thunder was floating silently in the void up above with lightning wrapped all around his body. A devastating aura was channeling out from within him.</p><br/><p>\u201cOld Master Thunder, what are you thinking of doing?\u201d The Old Master Devouring Heavens asked in a stumped manner.</p><br/><p>\u201cErm, self destructing?\u201d The face of the Old Master Thunder was calm right now. When those horrifying words of \u2018self destructing\u2019 came out of the mouth of the Old Master Thunder, they sounded like the most normal thing possible.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t! Old Master Thunder, if you self destruct here, we\u2019re all going to be implicated!\u201d The Old Master Water Dragon yelled out.</p><br/><p>And at this very moment, Lin Fan stood up on his feet and twisted his neck left and right to stretch it.</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone, please remain silent. Let me do the explaining for the second half of this show and elaborate to you guys the sort of impact his self destruction would create.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

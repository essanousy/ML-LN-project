No, that\u2019s not nice, is it? Look at us now! Me throwing you a punch and you returning with a palm strike\u2026 Awesome! Let us continue hurting one another!\u201d Lin Fan chuckled out.</p><br/><p>Right now, the Old Master Thunder was already thoroughly captured by Lin Fan. His throat was being choked as his face was pressed against Lin Fan\u2019s chest.</p><br/><p>\u201cLET LOOSE!\u201d The Old Master Thunder wanted to struggle out of this. However, he discovered that the strength of this Motherf*cking Human King was simply way too strong, that he couldn\u2019t break free at all!</p><br/><p>At this moment, the Old Master Thunder raised his bum and struggled to try and retreat. He hadn\u2019t expected that this Motherf*cking Human King would play so dirtily.</p><br/><p>At the same time, the thing that infuriated him the most was that this Motherf*cking Human King was just depending on that undefeatable Physical Body State of his. To think that he would be this despicable!</p><br/><p>\u201cOld Master Thunder, let\u2019s just watch and see what other capabilities you\u2019ve got to break out of this.\u201d Lin Fan sniggered out sinisterly.</p><br/><p>\u201cYOU DOGSH*T\u2026!\u201d The Old Master Thunder took out every last bit of strength he had as though he was sucking milk out of titties as he struggled and pulled back relentlessly.</p><br/><p>But, even if he coiled his entire body with the Power of Thunder, it was all useless.</p><br/><p>How in the world did this Motherf*cking Human King train his Physical Body State to this point? Even if it were the other utmost powerful beings, they definitely wouldn\u2019t be able to withstand this Power of Thunder at point blank!</p><br/><p>But for this Motherf*cking Human King, it did nothing at all! The Old Master Thunder could not help but feel saddened over this fact.</p><br/><p>\u201cOld Master Thunder, look at this. Tell me what it is.\u201d Lin Fan gripped his fist and waved it in front of the Old Master Thunder.</p><br/><p>\u201cFist.\u201d The Old Master Thunder could not help but reply.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wrong. This is a fist that\u2019s as big as a punching bag.\u201d After Lin Fan said that, he punched down once on the face of the Old Master Thunder.</p><br/><p>The force of that single punch was horrifying beyond anything else. The Old Master Thunder could feel as though his entire face was being distorted and wrecked by it right now.</p><br/><p>Blood Bursting Fist of the North Star.</p><br/><p>This was a special fist glove that Lin Fan had created and was invisible when he wore it on his fist. A single punch would cause blood to burst out while three punches would cause an explosion for sure.</p><br/><p>Fresh blood was spraying everywhere right now!</p><br/><p>The Old Master Thunder had never ever thought that his face would be so fragile that it would spray out blood with just a single punch.</p><br/><p>The fresh blood of utmost powerful beings was something far from normal. Every single drop of blood possessed an endless amount of power.</p><br/><p>If it were any normal person who had obtained this, licking a single drop of this blood could have them imploding from within due to the overload of power.</p><br/><p>And, even if it were any other martial artist, a single drop of blood could have them cultivating for a long period of time.</p><br/><p>\u201cDoes it hurt?\u201d Right now, Lin Fan was totally on a comeback in the advantaged position. Now that the Old Master Thunder had fallen into his hands, he definitely wanted to beat him up badly.</p><br/><p>This Old Master Thunder had been hunting him down for such a long time now. Each time he appeared, the shadow of the Old Master Thunder would definitely be chasing him from close behind. Now that the other party had fallen into his hands, if he did not let this guy know the feeling of being whacked up, he would definitely take Yours Truly as a pushover!</p><br/><p>\u201cMotherf*cking Human King, let me go! Your ancestor wants to fight you for a good 300 rounds!\u201d The Old Master Thunder yelled out.</p><br/><p>\u201c300 your mother! If I let you go, you will definitely make a break for it, you piece of dogsh*t!\u201d Lin Fan laughed out before punching on the face of the Old Master Thunder once more.</p><br/><p>BAM!</p><br/><p>\u201cARGH!\u201d</p><br/><p>It was as though the blood of the Old Master Thunder was a part of some buffet as it sprayed out everywhere. For an utmost powerful being, receiving a humiliation as such was something he couldn\u2019t possibly endure.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you know what\u2019s the name of this fist technique?\u201d Lin Fan asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet go of your ancestor!\u201d The Old Master Thunder did not want to know the name or anything else. The only thing he wanted right now was to be released and to take down this Motherf*cking Human King harshly.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you\u2026 This is the Blood Bursting Fist of the North Star. Do you know what\u2019s the effect of being punched by this three times in a row?\u201d Lin Fan scoffed out.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou bloody let go of me right now!\u201d The Old Master Thunder howled out.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan did not reply as he sent yet another punch down.</p><br/><p>BAM!</p><br/><p>An exploding sound boomed out.</p><br/><p>This was the third punch that was hit.</p><br/><p>The face of the Old Master Thunder split right open with flesh and blood flying everywhere. This was a terrible sight to endure. If any other utmost powerful beings were present here, they would definitely have their sh*t scared right out of them.</p><br/><p>This was a bloody utmost powerful being, not some punching bag!</p><br/><p>The anger in the heart of the Old Master Thunder was burning as the Power of Thunder wrapped all around his body.</p><br/><p>Crack, crack, sizzle, sizzle!</p><br/><p>Under the Power of Thunder, the entire void started crackling and exploding. But for Lin Fan, it wasn\u2019t as though it could possibly deal any damage to his physical body at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cOld Master Thunder, do you know what\u2019s the sister punch of the Blood Bursting Fist of the North Star?\u201d Lin Fan asked coldly.</p><br/><p>The Old Master Thunder did not reply. Right now, he was already incensed after being punched by Lin Fan repeatedly. That raised bum of his was swaying left and right up in the air as he tried his hardest to get out of this predicament.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you! The sister punch of the Blood Bursting Fist of the North Star is the Boobs Bursting Fist of the North Star.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe first punch.\u201d</p><br/><p>BAM!</p><br/><p>Lin Fan punched out to the left side of the Old Master Thunder\u2019s chest. Momentarily, a sharp pain spiked through him. Unable to endure the pain, the Old Master Thunder cried out in anguish.</p><br/><p>\u201cT-THIS\u2026!!!\u201d</p><br/><p>All of a sudden, the Old Master Thunder discovered that his chest had grown larger! This\u2026!</p><br/><p>\u201cMOTHERF*CKING HUMAN KING! JUST WHAT IN THE WORLD HAVE YOU DONE TO YOUR ANCESTOR\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Old Master Thunder screamed out at the top of his lungs. He felt that this Motherf*cking Human King was simply way too despicable and shameless!</p><br/><p>\u201cHuehue\u2026 This is where the magic of this fist technique lies. The next punch shall be your other chest, alright?\u201d Lin Fan laughed out coldly.</p><br/><p>\u201cSTOP THAT, MOTHERF*CKING HUMAN KING! YOU HAD BETTER STOP THAT FOR YOUR ANCESTOR! AS A KING WITH A CULTIVATION OF IMMEMORIAL ANCIENT STATE, HOW CAN YOU STOOP SO LOW TO USE SUCH DESPICABLE MOVES?\u201d The Old Master Thunder bellowed out. As an utmost powerful being, how could he possibly go out into the world with such a body?</p><br/><p>\u201cEH? Old Master Thunder, a single look and one could tell that you evidently have no understanding of the sort of person Yours Truly is. Ever since Yours Truly started off in the Xuanhuang World, the first move I had learned was Monkey Steals Peaches. Do you want to know how the Monkey Steals Peaches goes about?\u201d Lin Fan chuckled out frostily.</p><br/><p>\u201cLET GO OF YOUR ANCESTOR! FIGHT WITH YOUR ANCESTOR FOR A GOOD 300 ROUNDS IF YOU\u2019VE GOT THE GUTS!\u201d The Old Master Thunder was burning in wrath right now as he howled out uncontrollably.</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe\u2026 The second chest!\u201d</p><br/><p>BAM!</p><br/><p>When the punch had landed and the Old Master Thunder realized the state of his chest afterward, he started wailing out once more. He then churned his powers and tried his best to suppress this strange situation that was happening in his body. But to his surprise, nothing would work at all!</p><br/><p>Just what in the world was going on right now?!</p><br/><p>\u201cHow now? What are your thoughts on this currently?\u201d Lin Fan chuckled out and asked.</p><br/><p>The Old Master Thunder glared at Lin Fan with a death stare, \u201cYOUR ANCESTOR CANNOT WAIT TO RIP YOU UP INTO SHREDS!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shrugged his shoulders, \u201cDon\u2019t sweat it. Given your strength, you wouldn\u2019t be able to even break through the body of Yours Truly, let alone talk about ripping into shreds.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Old Master Thunder looked at Lin Fan with an endless amount of hatred. However, he could not help but admit that the words of the Motherf*cking Human King were right on the spot. He couldn\u2019t even break through the other party\u2019s defenses.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright! Since I\u2019ve played with you for such a long time now, Yours Truly shall send you on your way then.\u201d Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>The moment the Old Master Thunder heard these words, his face changed, \u201cYOU WANT TO KILL ME\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIMPOSSIBLE! YOU WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO KILL YOUR ANCESTOR FOR ALL ETERNITY! YOUR ANCESTOR IS THE ANCESTOR OF THE THUNDER RACE! THUNDER IS ABSOLUTELY INDESTRUCTIBLE! JUST SOMEONE LIKE YOU AND YOU THINK THAT YOU CAN DO IT\u2026?\u201d The Old Master Thunder mocked out.</p><br/><p>\u201cPast life, slay.\u201d</p><br/><p>Instantly, the face of the Old Master Thunder lost all its color, \u201cY-you\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get anxious now. This is just the Triple Lifetime Reincarnation Sutra of the Ancestral Buddha, that\u2019s all. I\u2019ll just slay all three of your lifetimes so that you can\u2019t even reincarnate.\u201d Lin Fan replied in a composed manner.</p><br/><p>\u201cNO! WAIT! YOU CAN\u2019T DO THAT!\u201d At this moment, the Old Master Thunder panicked. He hadn\u2019t expected that the Motherf*cking Human King would actually know of this mystic skill!</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

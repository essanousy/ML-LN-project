Can we talk this out nicely?\"</p><br/><p>\"I've got a specialty skill that I didn't take out earlier on! I'm willing to hand it over to you now!\"</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>At this moment, those old fogeys were starting to feel terror one after another. They had suddenly realized that this living being was a sicko, a beast!</p><br/><p>\"Yes, you, old fogey. You were hiding something earlier on?\" Lin Fan's face was straight as he asked sternly.</p><br/><p>\"N-nopes! No, I didn't!\"</p><br/><p>\"Hmph! Don't try to talk your way out of this. Then, you shall be the first one! How can you not be truthful towards someone as just and righteous as myself? This is something that the Heavens shall not tolerate! Chop you then! I'll just chop you then!\" Lin Fan swept his robes back, not wanting to say anything more.</p><br/><p>\"No please! Please spare my life!\"</p><br/><p>\"Even if you beg me, it's useless. It's all because you're way too dishonest as a person!\" Lin Fan replied.</p><br/><p>\"Ah! I'm the Reverend Heaven Shredder who has trodden over all the ancient times! Since when have I ever been as lowly as right now? I'm unwilling to accept this! You little beast! I'll curse that you to die a horrible death!\" Reverend Heaven Shredder roared with anger with indignance in his heart.</p><br/><p>He had not expected this to be his outcome one day. This was something he had never ever imagined.</p><br/><p>As for the other old fogeys, they heaved a sigh of relief at the sight of this instantly. Thank goodness!</p><br/><p>Towards the ending of Reverend Heaven Shredder, they couldn't help but feel a bit sad. However, they were more relieved than anything else. With that, the chances of them surviving was way higher right now. Now, who was going to be the next unlucky one?</p><br/><p>Waving his hands, Lin Fan tossed Reverend Heaven Shredder into his Paradise.</p><br/><p>\"Alright, next up, we'll be very fair about it. Now, whoever lives or die shall depend on the will of the Heavens then.\" Lin Fan's back faced them. Wielding the Eternal Axe in his hands, he sucked in a deep breath.</p><br/><p>\"All of you, stand up straight. Don't move randomly! I'm coming!\" This was the first time in Lin Fan's life that he was playing a game like this.</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>\"Alright, here it comes!\"</p><br/><p>At this moment, everyone present looked at that axe that was tossed up into the sky nervously.</p><br/><p>The Eternal Axe shone with a brilliant glare in the skies. However, to those old fogeys, this glare was less than beautiful. It was practically the luminescence of death.</p><br/><p>Whomsoever had this axe land on his head, it would be utter bad luck for them!</p><br/><p>'No, don't come over here! Not here please!'</p><br/><p>'Don't toss it at me! No please!'</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>At this moment, all the old fogeys were begging in their hearts and praying.</p><br/><p>Instantly, a wail rang out.</p><br/><p>\"How could it be me! I'm the Scarlet Rainbow Demon! How can I die like this? It can't be! This is absolutely impossible!\"</p><br/><p>The Scarlet Rainbow Demon could not bear to believe the sight before him right now. That Eternal Axe that had landed by his side was ever so blinding and gutsmashing right now.</p><br/><p>\"Seems like the outcome has been decided. This is the will of the Heavens. You've got no one to blame, eh!\" Lin Fan shrugged his shoulders helplessly.</p><br/><p>Right after that, he waved his hands and sent them into his Paradise.</p><br/><p>\"Master, I'll go ahead and train these guys, alright?\" The Thunder Trainer King asked excitedly.</p><br/><p>\"Sure.\" Lin Fan nodded his head.</p><br/><p>\"Alright, all of you, follow me. I shall lead you guys to the peak of your lives and experience pleasure like you have never ever known before.\" The Thunder Trainer King's face was benevolent right now as he said this. However, in the eyes of the old fogeys, that was a look so unsettled and horrifying. It was as though something frightening was about to happen real soon.</p><br/><p>However, at this moment, they did not want to think too much about it. After all, it was all useless.</p><br/><p>Seeing these old fogeys that were brought away by the Thunder Trainer King, Lin Fan felt a deep sorrow for them. To think that they would still be so fearful of death after cultivating to such an extent. In order to remain alive, they didn't even have a single bit of dignity left in them.</p><br/><p>Seemed like the more one possessed, the more one would be afraid of losing.</p><br/><p>Divine celestial level 10, Eternal God state... If they were in the Ancient Saint World right now, they would undoubtedly be truly powerful beings. Riches, status, respect, power... They wouldn't be lacking in any one of those. That's the reason why they were so fearful towards death as well.</p><br/><p>However, to Scarlet Rainbow Demon and the others, this was also a form of release. For once, it was truly all over. They would be free from their suffering and enslavement.</p><br/><p>The branches of the Mythical Parasol Tree were coiled around the Scarlet Rainbow Demon and the Reverend Heaven Shredder as it absorbed the power within their bodies.</p><br/><p>Even though these two fellas had been through 10,000 years of torment and were left with only a shell of their former selves, they were still Eternal God state beings no matter what. As such, they still had that bit of their cores left with them.</p><br/><p>'Ding\u2026Congratulations on killing Divine celestial level 10, Eternal God state powerful being.'</p><br/><p>'Ding\u2026Experience Points +1,000,000'</p><br/><p>'Ding\u2026Congratulations on killing Divine celestial level 10, Eternal God state powerful being.'</p><br/><p>'Ding\u2026Experience Points +1,200,000'</p><br/><p>'Ding\u2026Congratulations on leveling up.'</p><br/><p>'Cultivation State: Divine celestial level 5, Essence Spirit state.'</p><br/><p>Instantly, Lin Fan felt his powers starting to gush up like a rapid, long river that was surging rampantly. His powers were climbing steadily as they reached a new peak.</p><br/><p>Within his Inner World, Lin Fan could sense a mysterious feeling as well. It was as though there was a second him who was living within his body right now.</p><br/><p>Within his Inner World, an Essence Spirit was nurtured out. It sat there cross-legged with the exact same cultivation state as him. Between the both of them, there was this intense connection.</p><br/><p>Even if they were at two extreme ends of the world, it seemed as though he would be able to sense this connection.</p><br/><p>The Essence Spirit was himself, and he was the Essence Spirit.</p><br/><p>\"Seems like this is the Essence Spirit doppelganger.\" Lin Fan could sense this wondrous feeling of an interconnected telepathic link that was intertwined.</p><br/><p>With just a single notion, a figure appeared before Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan checked out his Essence Spirit doppelganger curiously. However, he had this strange feeling in his mind that someone was checking him out.</p><br/><p>This was a really mysterious feeling.</p><br/><p>It was too mysterious for words!</p><br/><p>The Paradise, Essence Spirit, Law, and every other good thing that the Scarlet Rainbow Demon and the Reverend Heaven Shredder possessed was fused into the Paradise.</p><br/><p>However, the only thing that had Lin Fan regretting was that the Scarlet Rainbow Demon and Reverend Heaven Shredder had been crippled by the Utmost Being, Cruel. Otherwise, if they had their true strength as divine celestial level 10, Eternal God state beings, these would definitely not be the only benefit they would be giving off right now.</p><br/><p>But, oh well, one might as well forget it. The benefits of today were pretty bountiful for now. After all, there was no way he was going to be able to take down this Cruel himself. Later on, once Cruel broke down the power that was sent by the Fire Water Empress, he would definitely come for Lin Fan himself. Even though it was almost certain that Lin Fan would die, he might even have to go through a round of torture before his death.</p><br/><p>If that were the case, he might as well commit suicide here.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the pitch black darkness in the distance. This place was akin to a world of its own, vast and boundless. Seemed like the body of a powerful being was nowhere as simple as he had thought it to be.</p><br/><p>If this were the case, the only way he could go about it was to continue raising his cultivation state. By the time he reached this equivalent cultivation state, he might then start to understand just what sort of an existence this was.</p><br/><p>However, he wondered how the Fire Water Empress and Cruel were doing now.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan could tell that even though this was a doppelganger of Cruel, it was no pushover. No matter how strong the Fire Water Empress was, there was no way she could be a match for Cruel with just a strain of her powers.</p><br/><p>\"Heh. Since I've already earned more than I could have ever asked for, even if I die now, I'm not going to lose anything with it. To think that Yours Truly's encounters would be this deeply tied with fate. Even in a dangerous place as such, I could receive endless benefits. This is indeed the best feeling ever!\"</p><br/><p>Instantly, a large amount of energy burst forth from Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>\"Well, it's time to see whether I can bring some trouble for Cruel by self destructing today!\" Lin Fan thought in anticipation.</p><br/><p>If there were anyone who wanted to compete in ruthlessness, Lin Fan would definitely be the champion. After all, he was a man who had dared to steal his own peaches in the past. And right now, he was going for the big blow up suicide.</p><br/><p>How was anyone not going to bow down to courage as such?</p><br/><p>\"Alright! Go and burst for me!\" Lin Fan yelled out in a high tone as he opened up his arms wide, prepared to receive this brand new future that laid in store for him. But, just as Lin Fan had made all preparations and was ready to self-destruct, he realized that something was off.</p><br/><p>\"Aiyoh! Holy f*ck! To think that the Fire Water Empress would have managed to kill off the doppelganger of Cruel's Essence Spirit! S-stop\u2026! Stop! I can't self-destruct now!\" Suddenly, Lin Fan's face was stunned. Just as his powers were surging out and his arms were starting to rupture, all prepared for a big blow up, he realized that his surroundings were starting to change!</p><br/><p>It seemed that he had managed to get out of Cruel's body!</p><br/><p>At this moment, Lin Fan's eyes were flushed red as he tried his best to retract that energy that was emanating out. He could not help but wipe the sweat off his forehead.</p><br/><p>\"Whew! That was too close for comfort! I nearly died for nothing!\" Lin Fan gasped with some stinging pain in his nuggets. If he were off in his timing by even a split second, he would have turned into nothingness!</p><br/><p>And just as Lin Fan was ready to yell out at this, he saw something happening in the distance.</p><br/><p>For some unknown reason, a light screen had appeared there.</p><br/><p>And Lin Fan was clear that this was the innate skill of the beings of the Succubus race. To think that it would appear again.</p><br/><p>Didn't this mean that Yours Truly's face was being shown right in front of all the beings of the thousands of races once more?</p><br/><p>No, no. Calm down\u2026 He had to calm down right now.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Lin Fan tossed his robes back. Disregarding that left arm of his that was blown off from his suicide attempt earlier on, he raised his head slightly. His eyes were imposing as he placed his hands behind his back and commented indifferently.</p><br/><p>\"Utmost Being of the Ancient race, Cruel, that's all he amounted to. In the hands of the Motherf*cking Human King, he was still disintegrated into ashes nevertheless.\"</p><br/><p>The moment these words came out, the entire Ancient Saint World fell into silence.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

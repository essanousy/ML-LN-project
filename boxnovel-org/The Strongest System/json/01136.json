He was long afraid of being set up by the Boundless Future Buddha Lord just like before; therefore, he was naturally more cautious right now. Being such a crafty fella, the Boundless Future Buddha Lord was definitely not someone whom Lin Fan could scam and kill that easily.</p><br/><p>Even though Lin Fan was always extravagant in his actions from the past, he wasn\u2019t some little expert who would throw himself into the pits of death. Everything would only take place after he had the utmost confidence of it working out.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Lin Fan started contemplating. Should he start with killing the Boundless Future Buddha Lord or the other five Master Gods later on?</p><br/><p>This was truly a question that was worth pondering over.</p><br/><p>The Boundless Future Buddha Lord was not a simple foe. Even if he were injured, he still definitely wasn\u2019t someone that Lin Fan could f*ck over just like that. As for the other five Master Gods, they didn\u2019t seem all that strong. Even if they weren\u2019t injured, Lin Fan would have the confidence of killing them all, let alone in a situation as such right now.</p><br/><p>Nevertheless, he had to play it safe!</p><br/><p>Even though he really wanted to have the Boundless Future Buddha Lord killed, he had better not get himself into a situation where he would get nothing in the end. In that case, he would suffer one hell of a loss. Therefore, his final conclusion was to get those five Master Gods killed first. As for the Boundless Future Buddha Lord, there was no hurry about that. If he got lucky, he could just get this guy killed as well. But if he didn\u2019t, then he would just leave him for the future. After all, he was already getting one hell of a profit from this affair this time around.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Lin Fan was still camping in wait without coming out at all.</p><br/><p>Once again, the Boundless Future Buddha Lord and the five Master Gods went at one another, causing a boundless surge of power to burst out. The void rattled out violently; this was a fight involving pure brute power. Anyone below the state of Immortal Kings would definitely find themselves minced into shreds if they were sucked into this situation.</p><br/><p>BAM!</p><br/><p>Yet another clash took place. While the Boundless Future Buddha Lord wasn\u2019t injured, the light around him seemed to have diminished slightly. As for the five Master Gods, their injuries seemed somewhat on the serious side.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan felt that it was about time for him to strike now.</p><br/><p>Pshew!</p><br/><p>Instantly, Lin Fan appeared behind the back of the five Master Gods. Gathering his aura, he hurled out a punch and was prepared to first have the five Master Gods killed.</p><br/><p>The brows of the Boundless Future Buddha Lord twitched with joy. \u201cHe\u2019s here\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Shing!</p><br/><p>The void quaked out, and those initially severely injured Master Gods recovered to full health all of a sudden.</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan caught sight of the situation, he froze up for a moment \u2014 he seemed to have been set up by them once more! The aura of the five Master Gods was way stronger than before, and at the same time, they seem to have been prepared for this!</p><br/><p>\u201cIndigenous Being, you\u2019ve finally come.\u201d In a flash, the five Master Gods turned around as a series of formidable God Powers exploded out.</p><br/><p>\u2018F*CKING MOTHER F*CK!\u2019</p><br/><p>Lin Fan cussed out in his heart. The way things were right now, even if he could not deal with it, he still would have to go deal with it! He had decided to come at them after such a difficult decision. No matter what, he would have to take at least one of them down!</p><br/><p>\u201cARGH!\u201d</p><br/><p>The powers within Lin Fan\u2019s hands burst forth as he bolted for one of the Master Gods right in the middle of everyone. That Master God\u2019s face changed immediately as he yelped out, \u201cHe\u2019s trying to kill me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBenefactor, Your Buddha Lord here has long seen through your antics and predicted that you would come. Therefore, I\u2019ve been waiting here for a long time now.\u201d The Boundless Future Buddha Lord spoke up and appeared behind Lin Fan\u2019s back instantly, striking out at him with a palm strike from behind.</p><br/><p>While Lin Fan could totally disregard the attacks of those few Master Gods, he could definitely not ignore the power that was being sent forth by the Boundless Future Buddha Lord. The strength of that fella was far from normal \u2014 a single palm strike from him was definitely more than enough to have Lin Fan sustaining severe injuries.</p><br/><p>Grabbing out at one of those Master Gods with his arm, Lin Fan took out a fake soap in his other hand and threw it out at the Boundless Future Buddha Lord.</p><br/><p>\u201cHAHA! Bald monk! You thought that I was trying to kill these Master Gods? I was trying to lure you over so that I can have you killed by this soap!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan roared out into laughter. When the Boundless Future Buddha Lord caught sight of the soap, his entire expression changed. He was someone who knew about just how powerful that soap was, and this was even more so when it was used by this crafty lad. The other time around, that lad had used a fake one to try and scam him. So, he was initially skeptical about everything this time around.</p><br/><p>But, when he heard the lad saying that he was only attacking the Master Gods to lure him over, he was startled and retreated back furiously right away. He did not want to bet on this, neither did he dare to. In his eyes, the risk involved was not worth taking.</p><br/><p>\u201cARGHHHHHHH!\u201d</p><br/><p>The other four Master Gods slammed their attacks onto Lin Fan\u2019s body. However, the latter still threw out his palm strike regardless and struck at the Master God right in the middle.</p><br/><p>BAM!</p><br/><p>A tragic wail rang out as that Master God was torn into four-five pieces due to Lin Fan\u2019s palm strike. A boundless amount of power surged right through his entire body, destroying it entirely.</p><br/><p>Carefree and easy, it was extremely simple.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026 Congratulations on killing Sky Master God.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026 Experience Points + \u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>The strike from those four Master Gods sent Lin Fan flying off as the blood within his body rumbled out furiously, causing him to spit out a mouthful of fresh blood into the skies. He then used his Mythical Parasol Tree to send a large stream of life force gushing into his body so that his wounds could be healed up.</p><br/><p>As for that soap that was thrown out, it had the Boundless Future Buddha Lord scared half to death. But when he realized that the soap was nothing but a fake, he was so mad that he was about to explode from anger.</p><br/><p>\u201cDAMN IT! YOU\u2019VE TRICKED ME AGAIN!\u201d The Boundless Future Buddha Lord howled out. He had not expected that he would be deceived by that lad once again.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan floated gently up in the void and was just cussing out in his heart, \u2018His f*cking chicken wh*re of a mother! That bald monk WAS indeed trying to set me up! Bloody hell! And here I was thinking about how the Boundless Future Buddha Lord could possibly arrive this quickly. Not only that, all of those Master Gods had managed to come in time as well. Seems like everything was but a show for me! Damn it! F*cking scary people these guys are.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cSo what if I\u2019ve tricked you? What I want to do IS to trick a big idiot like you!\u201d Lin Fan scolded out at that Boundless Future Buddha Lord. Bloody hell! Something as underhanded as such could have only been conceived by that bald monk. Otherwise, who else could manage that?</p><br/><p>Crafty and despicable, he had even bloody put on an act with the five Master Gods to try and lure Yours Truly out! And the worst thing was that Lin Fan had fallen for their hoodwinking, and was really drawn out.</p><br/><p>If not for the fact that his Physical Body State was extremely tough, and coupled with the fact that the strength of those five Master Gods wasn\u2019t that strong either, he might have really been killed with a single palm strike of theirs!</p><br/><p>Nevertheless, it was still a gain for him at the moment. To think that he would have earned the kill of a Master God in a short span of time still. Right now, there was going to be one less Master Gods out there, dropping their numbers down to sixty six.</p><br/><p>Looking at the remaining four Master Gods, Lin Fan WAS starting to have some ideas about them. He had a good mind of killing all four of them at one go.</p><br/><p>Looking at how the Sky Master God was killed by that Indigenous Being, those four Master Gods felt their hearts clenching up and being filled with a boundless rage. They raised their heads up at the Boundless Future Buddha Lord. \u201cWhy are you still not striking out! Are you actually colluding with this Indigenous Being here?\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment earlier on, the Boundless Future Buddha Lord clearly had a good chance to strike out and have that Indigenous Being killed! But, to think that he would have suddenly vanished, wasting that one and only precious chance they had.</p><br/><p>And now that he was still not striking out, that was something that had the other four Master Gods feeling entirely infuriated.</p><br/><p>\u201cGosh, you guys! Do you just have to spill the beans? This bald monk is truly my partner from the start. But no matter, telling you guys today will make no difference anyway. After all, all four of you are going to die here today. Perhaps, you guys don\u2019t know this yet, but the Water Master God and the Radiant Master God were both killed by me. And, my accomplice was none other than the Boundless Future Buddha Lord. Hehehe\u2026!\u201d Lin Fan roared out in laughter.</p><br/><p>\u201cShut up! Don\u2019t malign me with your lies!\u201d The Boundless Future Buddha Lord roared out.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan\u2019s lips curled into a grin.</p><br/><p>Perhaps if he were to take it slow and kill them, he could mow down all of these Master Gods cleanly.</p><br/><p>By then, Yours Truly would be lauded as the great hero that had saved the entire Endless Mainland.</p></div>\n</div>"}

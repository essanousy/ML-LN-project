Aside from increasing his experience, the stuff he crafted was either broken tiles or useless clay. His blacksmith profession was already level four, but all the stuff he crafted was complete trash, Lin Fan was now already full of doubts.</p><br/><p>\u2018Is it possible that even though I unlocked professions, I still can only craft piles of junk? Actually, this couldn\u2019t even be considered junk.\u2019 Lin Fan stared at the junk in front of him while breathing hard, about to go mad. \u201cYours truly just won\u2019t accept this\u2026\u201d Lin Fan roared out angrily, opening crazy mode as he began throwing the piles of junk once again into the furnace.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026 the material breaks and disappears.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026 the material breaks and disappears.\u2019</p><br/><p>\"How can this be?\u201d Lin Fan looked helplessly at the empty courtyard. The original three walls were now nonexistent. Aside from leveling his blacksmith skill to level four, he didn\u2019t craft a single useful item. At this point, Lin Fan doubted life itself and also doubted his own forging level. \u2018This doesn\u2019t make sense\u2026 this completely doesn\u2019t make sense. In the modern era, I was an enthusiastic fan of forging after all. How come after arriving here, I can\u2019t even craft a piece of garbage?\u2019</p><br/><p>After working hard all day, the sky was already darkening, and the outer sect disciples that went out to observe the exam should have already returned. \u201cJunior brother Lin, what happened to the walls around your courtyard?\u201d Yin Mo Chen, who had just returned back to his house, asked curiously after seeing Lin Fan\u2019s buck naked house.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know. When I woke up, it was all gone. Senior brother, how was today\u2019s outer sect examination?\u201d Lin Fan didn\u2019t want to say anything more, the reason being the topic was too painful.</p><br/><p>\u201cExcellent! There were many potential seedlings, so the sect was very excited.\u201d Yin Mo Chen also said this a bit excitedly. But upon seeing junior brother Lin\u2019s expression looking a bit down, Yin Mo Chen became slightly worried. \u201cJunior brother Lin, are you alright? You don\u2019t look too well. Is it possible you are still injured from last time? This is despicable! Senior brother Yi is just busy shielding and didn\u2019t even bother to give a reply. Tomorrow, I will go demand some justice for you.\u201d Yin Mo Chen said.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that, Senior brother. I am just tired. I will be returning now.\u201d Lin Fan lowered his head and said. \u201cJunior brother\u2026\u201d Yin Mo Chen watched Lin Fan worriedly, \u2018His figure seemed somewhat depressed, is he really alright?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Lin Fan lied down on his bed and gave a sigh, \u2018Today was a complete waste. All my efforts were for nothing. At least give me something useful and let me feel a bit happy.\u2019 But this entire day, it was either rubbish or broken, with not a single decent item appearing.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck\u2026\u201d Lin Fan covered himself with his bed sheets and without a further word went to sleep. At this moment, the room became silent, the fire flickered about inside the lantern on the table, as if it were reacting to Lin Fan. The sky became darker, and aside from the moonlight and bright stars shining down upon the earth, all was silent and peaceful.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, I refuse to accept this.\u201d Lin Fan suddenly sat up, throwing aside his bed sheets, now fully awake.</p><br/><p>Without another word, Lin Fan rose up and left the room, slowly disappearing into the darkness.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>In a certain outer sect disciple\u2019s house, the insides were still bright, and the person inside was obviously not asleep. Currently, inside the house, Wang Tianfeng smiled while taking out a manual he had just obtained today from his senior brother Yi Zhongyu.</p><br/><p>\u300aBurning Palm\u300b</p><br/><p>The world\u2019s martial skills were divided into four categories - heaven, earth, dark, and light.</p><br/><p>Though this manual \u300aBurning Palm\u300b was a lower martial skill of the dark category, to Wang Tianfeng, this was a precious martial skill. Outer sect disciples could only practice martial skills under the light category. As for the dark category, only inner sect disciples could study them.</p><br/><p>Wang Tianfeng hastily opened the manual and began diligently remembering the incantations. As long as he mastered the \u300aBurning Palm\u300b, even Ni Mingyang wouldn\u2019t be a match for him.</p><br/><p>Upon thinking about Ni Mingyang, Wang Tianfeng was filled with anger, \u2018That despicable guy actually went and snitched on him to Senior brother Yi. Luckily, Senior brother Yi is open-minded and took no notice of that guy.\u2019</p><br/><p>Of course, Wang Tianfeng understood that the reason Senior brother Yi ignored that guy was because he couldn\u2019t be bothered with it, as that person still wasn\u2019t of concern to him. After remembering a few lines of incantations, Wang Tianfeng carefully stored the manual away within his chest and got into a lotus position while focusing on the incantations.</p><br/><p>\u2018Dong Dong\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>At this time, Wang Tianfeng frowned, \u2018Who would come this late at night?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Dong Dong\u2026\u2019 The knocking continued endlessly.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m coming, I\u2019m coming. Not going to sleep even though it\u2019s so late, just what do you want?\u201d Wang Tianfeng shouted while swearing. But when Wang Tianfeng opened his door, he was stunned. There was not a single person in sight. He then swore loudly and closed the door, hastily getting back into the lotus position in his bed.</p><br/><p>\"Dong Dong\u2026\u201d A knock sounded on the door once again at this moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d \"At this point, Wang Tianfeng didn\u2019t get out of bed and instead impatiently shouted. After hearing the person outside continually knocking on the door, Wang Tianfeng became livid, immediately rushing off the bed and opening the door. But what made Wang Tianfeng even more enraged was the fact that there wasn\u2019t a single person outside.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho\u2019s there? Show yourself, coming to disturb me in middle of the night! I will kill you!\u201d Wang Tianfeng shouted while swearing.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Lin Fan, who was hiding in the shadows, began laughing upon seeing the flustered looking Wang Tianfeng, his previous depression now all swept away. After Wang Tianfeng closed his door again, Lin Fan silently crept forth, preparing another wave. But when Lin Fan arrived in front of the entrance, Wang Tianfeng suddenly opened the door.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan jolted obviously surprised. \u2018Damn\u2026It seems Wang Tianfeng also knows how to be sly.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright then, so it was you. It seems yesterday\u2019s punishment wasn\u2019t enough. In that case, I will let you know what happens to people like you.\u201d After seeing it was Lin Fan, Wang Tianfeng immediately launched a fist forth without a second word.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrat, let\u2019s see who can save you now.\u201d Wang Tianfeng was enraged at this point. This guy repeatedly tried to provoke him; he was simply testing his patience.</p><br/><p>\u2018Bam\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>The punch which contained all of Wang Tianfeng\u2019s anger smashed upon Lin Fan. According to Wang Tianfeng, it seemed that this time he would be gravely injured.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026 congratulations \u300aEternal Demon Body\u300b experience +10.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Lin Fan was a bit surprised.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Wang Tianfeng was in disbelief.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Wang Tianfeng looked at Lin Fan in disbelief, \u2018How is this guy still alright?\u2019</p><br/><p>As for Lin Fan, he didn\u2019t think that this guy would merely increase his experience by ten points.</p><br/><p>\u2018What\u2026What the hell!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cYou brat, Yours Truly just didn\u2019t use his full strength. Just letting you settle in a bit.\u201d Wang Tianfeng did not believe that his punch had no effect on the other party. He gave an angry roar, prepared to use his full strength to make this guy understand just what kind of horrible thing would happen to people who provoked him. But at this point, Wang Tianfeng\u2019s angry expression suddenly changed. There was a bit of ecstasy along with a bit of sourness.</p><br/><p>\u201cSeriously\u2026only ten points? Useless.\u201d Lin Fan rolled his eyes, then turned around and left in disdain.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026 congratulations\u300aMonkey Steals Peach\u300b+ 100.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026 defeated sixth level precelestial, Wang Tianfeng, experience + 500.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026You\u201d The previously enraged Wang Tianfeng held his crotch while crouching down, as tears streamed down his face. The pain within his eggs swept throughout his entire body.</p><br/><p>\u201cLin Fan, I will never forgive you!\u201d Wang Tianfeng roared out with his last ounce of strength as tears surged forth.</p><br/><p>In the darkness, Lin Fan\u2019s dull reply echoed forth.</p><br/><p>\u201cWeakling that only gives ten experience points\u2026\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

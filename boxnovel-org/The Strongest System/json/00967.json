Bam!</p><br/><p>The peaceful void started exploding out all of a sudden as a figure was pushed out from.</p><br/><p>\u201cSeven Saint Old Dog.\u201d When Lin Fan caught sight of that figure, he could not help but chuckle out.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn it! How did you discover me, Fire Water Empress?\u201d Seven Saint Old Dog barked out as his eyes shone with a horrified look. He hadn\u2019t expected that after staying hidden so deeply, he would still be discovered!</p><br/><p>\u201cAt the time when Eternal God Seats started flooding out within the world, it had already been brought to my attention. But, to think that there would be someone who was manipulating everything from behind the scenes.\u201d The Fire Water Empress said.</p><br/><p>When the Eternal God Seats started appearing all over the world, the Fire Water Empress had already realized that things were far from simple. Later on, when she conducted a thorough investigation into it, she realized that there was someone who was actually pushing everything from the dark.</p><br/><p>It was hard to predict everything in this world.</p><br/><p>Even if it were Seven Saint Old Dog, he had not thought that things would come to this point.</p><br/><p>According to the calculations of that mysterious Master of his, being slowly corroded bit by bit would ensure that they would be able to suppress these utmost powerful beings.</p><br/><p>But, who would have thought that these utmost powerful beings would no longer be fighting with one another after coming out of that secret ground! This had the Seven Saint Old Dog caught at a loss about what to do at that moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cSeven Saint Old Dog, you\u2019ve been hiding yourself the entire time. But, I doubt that you could have guessed that this would happen, right?\u201d Lin Fan asked while grinning.</p><br/><p>\u201cMotherf*cking Human King, you had better shut up! If not for you, Your Saint here would not have been at this state right now!\u201d Seven Saint Old Dog roared out harshly once more. The reason why he was in such a wretched state right now was all caused by this b*stard before him.</p><br/><p>If not for this Motherf*cking Human King, how would he be in a state where he was controlled by others, and had to remain hidden in the void the entire time?</p><br/><p>If it were any other time, Lin Fan would have loved for a good chat with the Seven Saint Old Dog. But, given the current situation, time was of the essence.</p><br/><p>There was no telling when those two stone gates would close themselves shut. If those stone gates were to shut close, it would be too late for them.</p><br/><p>\u201cSuppress him then.\u201d Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d The Fire Water Empress nodded her head. Even though they could not take down those powerful beings in the secret ground, suppressing this Seven Saint Old Dog was no tall task.</p><br/><p>The moment the Fire Water Empress struck out, her fingers tore through the void and caused everything to sparkle like crystals. It was as though this was a World of Fire and Water right now.</p><br/><p>Shing!</p><br/><p>Seven Saint Old Dog could feel the void around him starting to tremble as he shrieked out.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn it! This is accursed!\u201d</p><br/><p>BOOM!</p><br/><p>In front of the Fire Water Empress, Seven Saint Old Dog was just like a weakling who could not do anything at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, save me! Please save me, Master\u2026!\u201d Being grabbed in the hands of the Fire Water Empress, Seven Saint Old Dog started screaming out towards the void as though he was seeking help from someone.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph!\u201d The Fire Water Empress scoffed coldly as she sliced at the void with her fingers acting as knives.</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone, strike out together!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright!\u201d The utmost powerful beings nodded their heads. They knew that if they did not band together at this critical moment, they could then only wait for the destruction of this era.</p><br/><p>At this moment, a thread of black mist wrapped itself around the body of Seven Saint Old Dog. This was a connection that the mysterious, powerful being had placed onto his body.</p><br/><p>Slay!</p><br/><p>Bam!</p><br/><p>\u201cYou bunch of ants\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Fire Water Empress and the other utmost powerful beings had already sensed the connection of that consciousness. Even though that consciousness had managed to penetrate through to this place, it could only watch with open eyes as it got purged out.</p><br/><p>\u201cARGH!\u201d</p><br/><p>Seven Saint Old Dog had not expected that things would turn out as such. With a final howl, his body ruptured and turned into dust before disappearing between the world.</p><br/><p>\u2018Just who in the world is the mysterious person who was manipulating Old Master Seven Saint from behind the scenes?\u2019 The Fire Water Empress was bewildered in her heart. Even though they had managed to purge out that consciousness, she knew that they hadn\u2019t managed to deal any damage to the other party.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, everything has ended now. The Motherf*cking Human King is our only hope right now. Even though we do not know what is going on with the world outside, I hope that everyone would be able to band together and send the Motherf*cking Human King out.\u201d The Fire Water Empress said.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. Regarding this matter, we know what we should do. We can only hope that the Motherf*cking Human King can stay true to his words.\u201d Even though many of the utmost powerful beings still bore doubt towards Lin Fan, given the current situation, they knew that they had no other choice.</p><br/><p>The Reincarnation Demonic God stood out at this moment, \u201cThe Reincarnation Secret Technique can allow one to reincarnate their consciousness. However, one must abandon all the living beings within their bodies. At the same time, one must seal up one\u2019s powers.\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment Lin Fan heard this, his face changed slightly before sighing out. Flicking out with his finger, the three worlds other than his Paradise floated out.</p><br/><p>Thereafter, with a thought from his mind, all the living beings of the three worlds appeared within the world here.</p><br/><p>When the utmost powerful beings caught sight of this, they felt their hearts skip a beat. To think that this Motherf*cking Human King would have cultivated three entire worlds!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere is this place\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>When the living beings who were residing in the three worlds caught sight of everything around them, their faces were filled with bewilderment.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>All of Lin Fan\u2019s closed ones appeared and came beside him immediately. Their faces were filled with exhilaration.</p><br/><p>\u201cHubby!\u201d In the blink of an eye, Xuan Yunxian\u2019s had arrived at a foreign place, which made her expression change. But, when she caught sight of Lin Fan, she ran beside him immediately.</p><br/><p>\u2018Not good\u2026!\u2019 Lin Fan\u2019s heart skipped a beat. All of a sudden, he had realized that the face of the Fire Water Empress was starting to change.</p><br/><p>This was anger accompanied with jealousy!</p><br/><p>However, she had hidden her emotions extremely deeply. If one didn\u2019t pay attention, they might not have been able to tell at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cHUEHUE.\u201d The Fire Water Empress laughed out. However, this was a laughter that was ever so sinister and creepy.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis\u2026!\u201d Lin Fan wanted to say something, but the Fire Water Empress swept her robes aside, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to say more. I\u2019ll settle things with you slowly after you\u2019re back. And if you don\u2019t return, all the better. See no evil, feel no troubles.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even though Xuan Yunxian did not know what the Fire Water Empress meant by her words, she was someone who was extremely tactful. She noticed that the Fire Water Empress was exerting a tremendous pressure onto her. At the same time, through her eyes and her tone, Xuan Yunxian could make out the rough meaning of everything. As long as one wasn\u2019t stupid, they would be able to understand.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Sister.\u201d Xuan Yunxian addressed her respectfully. But, when she caught sight of Lin Fan, the meaning of her gaze was also extremely clear, \u2018Good! You\u2019re dead meat\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Even though the Fire Water Empress was infuriated in her heart, her expression was indifferent, \u201cI\u2019ve lived for many more eras than you have. It\u2019s only natural that you address me as elder sister.\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, the Fire Water Empress exerted her dominance as the \u2018big wife\u2019.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, where are we?\u201d Zhang Ergou asked puzzledly, not understanding what was going on.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster\u2026!\u201d By now, Zhiqiao was already a young adult. She stood tall and elegant, and was a goddess level beauty back in the Xuanhuang World.</p><br/><p>But, when she caught sight of these living beings who bore extremely boundless auras, she could not help but feel her heart tightening as well.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan summarized the events, and the masses who had appeared understood it all as well. As a result, their faces were filled with worry.</p><br/><p>The Fire Water Empress took a step forth and looked at the utmost powerful beings present, \u201cAll of you can see it as well, right? The loved ones of the Motherf*cking Human King are all here, and will coexist with us as well. If the Motherf*cking Human King does not return, everything shall vanish along with the winds into nothingness. Are you guys satisfied now with such a huge risk he\u2019s taking here?\u201d</p><br/><p>The utmost powerful beings nodded their heads. The situation right now was better than one where he had nothing to care about.</p><br/><p>Even though these utmost powerful beings cared about nothing else other than their own safety, they could tell that the Motherf*cking Human King had emotions lingering with these people here.</p><br/><p>If he were to fail, they could only resign themselves to fate.</p><br/><p>But, if he succeeded and yet chose to not return to save them, they could at least rest easy despite their indignance knowing that there were all these people who would be accompanying them in their burial.</p></div>\n</div>"}

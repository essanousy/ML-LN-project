He hadn't expected that this human would dare to act so brazenly.</p><br/><p>\"That's fine as well. Your Heaven's Will shall kill you right now, and dig that Ancient Saint Sacrificial Altar and Eternal God Seat out of you!\"</p><br/><p>\"Kill me? Dream on!\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan roared out. Without staying put any longer, he propped up both his feet onto the ground and prepared to head forward, wanting to leave this place.</p><br/><p>\"Puny human, wanting to escape from the grasp of Your Heaven's Will is nothing but a fool's dream! The entire Ancient Saint World is under the control of Your Heaven's Will! Even if you were to escape to the edge of the world, it's all useless!\"</p><br/><p>BOOM!</p><br/><p>Yet another thunderbolt struck down from the Heavens.</p><br/><p>This boundless thunderbolt flashed out, turning the entire world extremely bright for a moment.</p><br/><p>The thunderbolt swam out as Lin Fan's entire body was caged up in it. The screeching sounds of the lightning permeated the void in a radius of thousands of miles, causing the entire world to seem as though it was engulfed in thunder.</p><br/><p>When the Heaven's Will struck, the impact would be far from what one could possibly imagine. The ripples caused by the aftermath were equally terrifying.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan's worries from before were completely undue.</p><br/><p>Given the current situation, even if it was a Divine celestial level 9 state powerful being, they might be electrocuted to Hell and back even on the outside, let alone having to walk in to see how Lin Fan was doing right now.</p><br/><p>\"AH! That hurts!!!\"</p><br/><p>In order to act out that he was really having a terrible time right now and could barely withstand anymore, Lin Fan put on even more effort towards acting.</p><br/><p>'Ding\u2026Eternal God Body Experience Points +50,000.'</p><br/><p>Even though Lin Fan knew that the Ancient Saint World's Heaven's Will might have only a slight bit awakened, its power was more than enough to give him a run for his money.</p><br/><p>Right now, Lin Fan's cultivation state was only that of a Divine celestial level 9, Eight Desolates United state. He was still quite a distance away from being a Divine celestial level 10, Eternal God state being.</p><br/><p>And there was even another state to that.</p><br/><p>An Eternal God state being who had obtained the Eternal God Seat.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan did not know the sort of changes would occur when his strength was finally raised to an Eternal God state.</p><br/><p>If the Fire Water Empress were here, Lin Fan had half a good mind to ask her just how in the world it would feel compared to right now.</p><br/><p>\"Human, you\u2026!\"</p><br/><p>The Heaven's Will of the Ancient Saint World was startled right now. Even though he did not have a complete body yet, the fact that this human could withstand two thunderbolts was still extremely weird.</p><br/><p>In his opinion, this didn't make any sense at all!</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan heard the tone of the Heaven's Will of the Ancient Saint World, he froze up in his heart. This Heaven's Will was way too confident, wasn't he? Wasn't it just two thunderbolts that didn't manage to kill him? Did he have to make such a fuss over it?</p><br/><p>He had to give a few thousand thunderbolts at least! That would be more like it!</p><br/><p>\"I can't do it anymore! No more! My Paradise's about to break down!\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan exclaimed out, indicating that he was in a horrendous pain and couldn't really take it any longer.</p><br/><p>\"Heaven's Will, if you were to come at it a few times more, Yours Truly will truly not be able to take it anymore!\"</p><br/><p>BOOM!</p><br/><p>Yet another thunderbolt struck down.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan's body shone immensely once more. In fact, his skin was so charred it couldn't turn any blacker than this. In the eyes of any outsider, for someone to be able to continue living under such circumstances was way too inconceivable!</p><br/><p>'Ding\u2026Eternal God Body Experience Points +50,000.'</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>\"No! Yours Truly has got to run! How can I possibly die in your hands?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan yelled out and spat out a mouthful of old blood. He then sprinted off into the distance as though he was giving it his all.</p><br/><p>However, Lin Fan still took care to pay attention to the situation in the void.</p><br/><p>The path of his escape had to be planned out as well, so that the Heaven's Will would think that if he didn't put in some effort, he would end up allowing this human to escape!</p><br/><p>Back when his physical body state wasn't a Divine celestial level 10, Eternal God state body, Lin Fan would definitely not dare to go head on stubbornly as such.</p><br/><p>The Heaven's Will was the Heaven's Will. Even if only a small part of it had awakened right now, he still wasn't something that Lin Fan could f*ck up just yet.</p><br/><p>But right now, Lin Fan could face him head on straight up. Even though the Mythical Parasol Tree had expended quite a bit of lifeforce, that didn't amount to much.</p><br/><p>\"Human\u2026 you shall never be able to escape! Under the control of Your Heaven's Will, there is no place for you to hide in the entire Ancient Saint World!\"</p><br/><p>The Heaven's Will bellowed out as he sent yet another thunderbolt down.</p><br/><p>\"URGH!\"</p><br/><p>Blood sprayed up into the skies.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan convulsed furiously for a moment before tossing his head and running while covering his head. However, he was stumbling left and right before giving off an expression that implied that he was could barely make it right now, yet had enough within him to continue running for another bit of distance.</p><br/><p>Boom!</p><br/><p>Boom!</p><br/><p>At this moment, it seemed as though the Heaven's Will of the Ancient Saint World was addicted to it as he sent thunderbolts one after another. They dropped down like raindrops that pitter pattered onto Lin Fan's body.</p><br/><p>\"Heaven's Will! Are you intent on leaving me with no way out!\" Lin Fan yelled out.</p><br/><p>\"Hand over the Ancient Saint Sacrificial Altar\u2026!\"</p><br/><p>\"No! You might as well strike me to death!\"</p><br/><p>'Ding\u2026Eternal God Body Experience Points +50,000.'</p><br/><p>'Ding\u2026Eternal God Body Experience Points +50,000.'</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>At this moment, happiness and pain were coexisting within Lin Fan. However, happiness took the majority of it.</p><br/><p>When he heard the notifications of the experience points, Lin Fan's heart was overwhelmed with joy.</p><br/><p>For Lin Fan, this type of feelings was just awesome!</p><br/><p>Time passed by the seconds and minutes\u2026</p><br/><p>By now, the entire world right here had completely descended into a world of thunder. In fact, in Lin Fan's opinion, each time the Heaven's Will sent down a thunderbolt, it could probably even turn into a Thunder Spirit.</p><br/><p>\"So many experience points! A few more times and I'll be able to level up!\"</p><br/><p>Right now, Eternal God Body was already Level 19. As long as it leveled up once more, it would reach that Level 20, and might even evolve. Lin Fan did not know if it would then turn into some even more powerful physical body skill!</p><br/><p>\"Come on! Strike me to death!\"</p><br/><p>At this point, Lin Fan gave up on running entirely and opened up his arms spread-eagled, as though he was welcoming a brand new future.</p><br/><p>For the current Lin Fan, what came next would be a moment of miracle.</p><br/><p>\"Eh?\"</p><br/><p>At this moment, Lin Fan was stunned. What in the world was going on? Why wasn't anything happening at all? Was the Heaven's Will not coming at him any longer?</p><br/><p>Lin Fan opened up his eyes. Those dark clouds that were rumbling furiously started to seem unsteady right now, as though they could disappear at any moment.</p><br/><p>\"Holy f*ck!\"</p><br/><p>\"Heaven's Will, don't do this! You can't drop the combo at this critical moment right here!\"</p><br/><p>\"Aiyah! Yours Truly is truly not going to make it soon! Look at how badly you've made me puke blood! I can die at any moment!\"</p><br/><p>\"Last six times, I promise! Just six times more! If Yours Truly doesn't die, I'm literally going to be struck by thunder!\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was anxious right now. The situation in the void didn't seem favorable at this very moment. There was a blurry feeling to this right now. Initially, the void was filled with a formidable power that could rattle one's heart. But at this moment, that had weakened considerably.</p><br/><p>BAM!</p><br/><p>\"Here it comes!\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was overwhelmed with joy instantly. He was given quite the scare by the Heaven's Will, thinking that the Heaven's Will was all done with him just like that.</p><br/><p>An extremely thick thunderbolt was channeling within the void. In Lin Fan's opinion, this thunderbolt seemed far from ordinary.</p><br/><p>BOOM!</p><br/><p>The thunderbolt screeched with an extraordinary momentum to it. Lin Fan was overwhelmed with happiness at this moment. This was the way it should be! It wouldn't be befitting to be called the Heaven's Will if it didn't strike down all the way till the end!</p><br/><p>Crackle. Crackle. Crackle.</p><br/><p>Just at this moment, something suddenly seemed off with the situation.</p><br/><p>As the thunderbolt was channeling in the sky, it seemed to have caught fire as it spouted out black smoke. It then turned smaller and smaller, until when it eventually arrived at Lin Fan's head, it was only the size of his thumb!</p><br/><p>'Ding\u2026Eternal God Body Experience Points +1,000.'</p><br/><p>Lin Fan's jaws dropped down at this moment as his eyes were filled with absolute disbelief. He then raised his head slowly and looked up into the void, unable to break out of this daze for a long, long time.</p><br/><p>\"Heaven's Will\u2026 Are you f*cking kidding me?\"</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

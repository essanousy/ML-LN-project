This was the System\u2019s function of restraining in his aura, which ordinary people would not be able to see through at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s dead. To think that he would have really died!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGo! Delays would always bring unnecessary problems. Check if there\u2019s anything good on him. Let\u2019s take it and just leave.\u201d</p><br/><p>Both of them were incomparably excited right now. As Ancestor Immortal state beings, they would normally not be bothered with any ordinary Immortal Weapons. However, the Immortal Weapon that Lin Fan had displayed earlier on was far from ordinary. There was a good chance that it might be an item that went beyond the Supreme Grade Immortal Weapon grade!</p><br/><p>If people could spill guts fighting over a Supreme Grade Immortal Weapon, there was no need to imagine how rare it was to find an item as such which could surpass that existence.</p><br/><p>Both of them stood before Lin Fan and eyed him carefully.</p><br/><p>\u201cIndeed, heroes are born from the youth. Look at how young his bones are and yet his cultivation state is already that high. If he were given the opportunity to continue progressing, he was most likely going to turn into someone outrageous!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuehue\u2026 Even if that\u2019s the case, so what? The Endless Mainland is so huge, with so many geniuses with exceptional talent. But, how many of them ever get to live till the very end? Yet, I\u2019ve got to agree that this fella is truly pretty special. Even when compared to that Qin Shengjun of the God Essence Sect, they may actually have been equals.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTo think that he would end up veering onto the path of the devil. If the Heaven and Earth Sect knew about this, I wonder how they would feel about it. It must truly be miserable.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHurry up and search him. As the Grandmaster Candidate of the Heaven and Earth Sect, this lad must have a fair amount of treasures on him.\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, the two of them started searching.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was cussing out in his mind. These mother*cking dogsh*ts! They were really searching him just like that! Search their mother\u2019s p*ssies! He was going to rekt them apart!</p><br/><p>\u201cEh? Where has this lad kept all of his items? That\u2019s really strange!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs there nothing in his storage rings?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNopes! I\u2019ve just taken a look! There\u2019s absolutely nothing in his storage rings!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSearch carefully once more!\u201d</p><br/><p>With that, both of them squatted down and let down their guard. In their minds, this lad had really died after veering onto the path of the devil.</p><br/><p>Seeing this, Lin Fan\u2019s heart leaped with joy. It seemed like it was time for him to shine now!</p><br/><p>\u201cHUH!\u201d</p><br/><p>Just at this moment, the faces of these two people changed slightly. That initially excited expression of theirs was frozen solid. They felt as though there was a part of their body that had just received some intense blow!</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe! Caught them!\u201d</p><br/><p>A demonic voice rang out in both of their ears.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026!\u201d Both of them had their faces alarmed and somewhat menacing right now.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t move now! Be careful of them blowing up! If they really do blow up because of you moving, you can\u2019t blame me!\u201d Lin Fan moved his hand ever so slightly, but the amount of strength he had in them was pretty tyrannical nevertheless.</p><br/><p>PAIN!</p><br/><p>The faces of the two grimaced at this point. All they could feel was an impossible pain surging right into the depths of their hearts. This pain was extreme in the torment that it delivered. No matter how strong their powers were, there was no way they could withstand this!</p><br/><p>\u201cW-Weren\u2019t you already d-dead? How c-could you\u2026!\u201d Their voices were trembling while their teeth chattered as though they had just seen a ghost.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho said that I was dead? I was merely pretending to be dead. The Kunlun God Sect is truly far from ordinary. To think that they would have two Ancestor Immortal state lower level beings to come look for trouble with me!\u201d Lin Fan sighed.</p><br/><p>\u201cY-You\u2019re so d-despicable\u2026!\u201d The two of them clenched their teeth while saying. However, because the other party was grabbing onto their magical spot, they could not summon even the slightest bit of strength to fight back.</p><br/><p>\u201cDespicable? No, I\u2019m not being despicable. This is just a normal plan. You guys can only blame yourselves for being too stupid.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTwisting Heaven and Earth!\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, Lin Fan spoke up, that clean, crisp voice of his reverberating across the Heaven and Earth gently. This was an extremely simple move; yet, Lin Fan was the only person within the entire universe who could master this skill to such an extent.</p><br/><p>As for both the targets of the move, it was as though their worlds had crumbled at this very moment. The ground was splitting into countless pieces while the entire sky was being destroyed, turning their world pitch black right now.</p><br/><p>\u201cARGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!\u201d</p><br/><p>All of a sudden, two extremely anguished voices rang out across the entire world. These voices were tragic and miserable beyond anything that had existed.</p><br/><p>\u201cYOU ARE THE GRANDMASTER CANDIDATE OF THE HEAVEN AND EARTH SECT, SOMEONE WHO IS UPRIGHT AND JUST! TO THINK THAT YOU WOULD RESORT TO SUCH UNDERHANDED AND CHEAP TRICKS! DESPICABLE! SHAMELESS\u2026!\u201d The two of them screamed out. To think that this fella would be this underhanded!</p><br/><p>Both of them were Ancestor Immortal state powerful beings who could probably reign supreme over a part of the Endless Mainland,. Within the Kunlun God Sect, they were the core Battle Elders. If they were sent to any of the small sects, they would most likely be able to take over as the Grandmaster!</p><br/><p>But, to think that they would have to bear the indignance of being struck by the other party without having even a single chance to fight back! They were filled with indignance toward this unfairness!</p><br/><p>If the other party had used some absolutely formidable strength to take them down, they would at least be convinced in their hearts. But right now, these despicable methods of the other party had them feeling exceptionally resentful!</p><br/><p>Lin Fan clapped his hands and looked at the two people lying on the ground while clutching their crotches, then let out an extremely brilliant smile.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Lin Fan took out the Eternal Axe and swung it a few times in the air.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you trying to do?!\u201d The two of them gasped out in shock. They wanted to fight back, but the pain in their groins rendered them totally immobile.</p><br/><p>Painful! It was really way too painful!</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled, \u201cWhat do you guys think?\u201d</p><br/><p>These two Ancestor Immortal state powerful beings were major bundles of experience points! Whether or not he could level up would have to depend on these two!</p><br/><p>However, he truly had not expected that the Kunlun God Sect would be petty enough to really send people for killing him.</p><br/><p>But, he might as well let it be then. If they came, all he had to do was just kill them instead. Acts of kindness such as presenting him with experience points was something that had Lin Fan feeling a little emotional to be honest.</p><br/><p>\u201cYOU WOULD REALLY DARE TO KILL US?\u201d The two of them glared at Lin Fan madly. After all, they had a high status in the Kunlun God Sect.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat would I not dare? You guys wanted to kill me, and yet I don\u2019t have the right to kill you guys instead?\u201d Lin Fan raised his axe, prepared to chop down on one of them.</p><br/><p>But just at this moment, the void trembled slightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cStop that\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>A thunderous voice boomed over as though it came from a distant place. When both of them heard that voice, their hearts leaped with joy, \u201cVice Grandmaster\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan frowned. Even though the voice had arrived, the person had yet to arrive. Bloody hell! He had to hasten it up now.</p><br/><p>Hands up, axe down.</p><br/><p>Snap!</p><br/><p>Fresh blood sprayed out everywhere.</p><br/><p>\u201cARGHHHHHHHHHH!!!\u201d</p><br/><p>With that, a tragic cry rang out across the world.</p><br/><p>The two of them had not expected Lin Fan to truly strike down!</p><br/><p>Lin Fan\u2019s eyes shone with a deranged expression. At a time as such, how could he get soft in his heart? The experience points were clearly lying right before his eyes! If he were to let them go, wouldn\u2019t he be taking a huge loss?</p><br/><p>He did not care about who it was that had arrived. As long as they dared to come, he would kill them all the same.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026Congratulations on killing Ancestor Immortal state lower level powerful being.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026Congratulations on killing Ancestor Immortal state lower level powerful being.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026Congratulations on leveling up\u2026Golden Immortal state upper level.\u2019</p><br/><p>Lin Fan did not hesitate as he opened his palm to keep all the storage rings of the two, then bellowed out into the void, \u201cSTOP YOUR MOTHER! COME AND CHASE ME IF YOU\u2019VE GOT THE GUTS!\u201d</p><br/><p>Pshew!</p><br/><p>With that, a long streak of light bolted into the endless void. The feeling of a hit and run was so damned bloody awesome!</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn it! You\u2019re courting death!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Vice Grandmaster of the Kunlun God Sect roared out as his voice filled the entire void.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan took a quick glance behind him. What a bloody moron! He had only sent his Essence Spirit instead of his true body here, and he expected it to be enough to hold down Yours Truly? This guy must be dreaming!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

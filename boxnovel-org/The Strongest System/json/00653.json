This was especially the case for Twisting Heaven and Earth, and True Origins Crushing Kick. These two were the most horrifying of them all.</p><br/><p>In fact, for Lin Fan, these were extraordinarily unique skills on their own.</p><br/><p>Repelling Lin Fan's attack, Sovereign King Zheng had wanted to laugh out wildly. However, in the blink of an eye, he felt the hair on his back standing entirely upright. It was as though there was some terrifying power surging towards him.</p><br/><p>All of a sudden, the sky changed colors as the ground began to crack.</p><br/><p>For Sovereign King Zheng, it was as though his entire world had just collapsed. The pain in his nuggets bubbled its way into his heart. He was unable to pull himself away from this pain.</p><br/><p>\"This feeling\u2026!\"</p><br/><p>\"THIS FEELING\u2026!\"</p><br/><p>\"ARGHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!\"</p><br/><p>No matter how strong he was, he still screamed out at the top of his lungs at this moment. This tragic cry was extremely sorrowful, bringing with it a sense of melancholy.</p><br/><p>Pain!</p><br/><p>Extreme pain!</p><br/><p>Sovereign King Zheng's eyes rolled around wildly as his hands grabbed at his crotch.</p><br/><p>\"HOW COULD THIS BE? Your Sovereign King here has already trained himself up to a state of indestructibility! How could I still feel pain?\"</p><br/><p>Sovereign King Zheng could not understand, nor did he want to understand. After all, this pain was way too unbearable.</p><br/><p>Looking at the state Sovereign King Zheng was in right now, Lin Fan smiled calmly. This was a situation he had seen too many times now. It could be said that he was long used to it. However, when he caught sight of how terrible Sovereign King Zheng was looking right now, he still could not help but chuckle out.</p><br/><p>\"Sovereign King Zheng, how does it feel? Are you finally feeling some sensations that you had long lost?\" Lin Fan asked casually.</p><br/><p>\"WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO ME?\" As an Ancient race being, Sovereign King Zheng was insusceptible to pain. However, to think that it would be useless at this moment.</p><br/><p>That pain within his body rumbled furiously like tidal waves, one taller than the other.</p><br/><p>\"Isn't it obvious? All I did was give you a kick in the nuts.\" Lin Fan giggled out. By now, Sovereign King Zheng had lost his fighting powers entirely. As for Evil Alliance Palace Master and the Fox Emperor, both of them were engaged in a private duel for the Green Hell Ancient Clock.</p><br/><p>Neither of them wanted it to fall in the hands of the other party. Hence, even while grabbing at the Green Hell Ancient Clock, they were trying to backstab the other party as well.</p><br/><p>\"DESPICABLE! SHAMELESS!\" Sovereign King Zheng could almost feel his tears coming out right now. The Ancient race beings were supreme existences in this world! How could they tear out? But for the current Sovereign King Zheng, it was truly painful. Truly, very painful.</p><br/><p>It was so painful that he was about to go mad.</p><br/><p>The throbbing pain of his nuggets were being transmitted over to his brain. The powers within his body were rumbling furiously, wanting desperately to curb this pain. However, it was all useless.</p><br/><p>Following the increase in the pain intensity, Sovereign King Zheng could no longer endure it. Clutching his crotch with both hands, he rolled around on the ground. On that pitch black forehead of his, gigantic beads of sweat began to drip down one after another.</p><br/><p>\"MOTHERF*CKING HUMAN KING! YOU'LL DEFINITELY DIE A HORRIBLE DEATH!\" This was something that the Sovereign King Zheng had never once experienced. There had never been a powerful being who was so despicable with his skills.</p><br/><p>But, this Motherf*cking Human King before him? He seemed as though he was extremely well versed in these skills.</p><br/><p>\"What's happening? Why's the Sovereign King Zheng rolling on the ground screaming now?\"</p><br/><p>\"I've got no idea. All I saw was a leg that had extended from the void all of a sudden. Following that, this happened to Sovereign King Zheng.\"</p><br/><p>\"That must be the ultimate move of the Motherf*cking Human King! To think that it would be this strong to take down the Sovereign King Zheng with a single kick! This is simply way too scary!\"</p><br/><p>\"Eh? The Evil Alliance Palace Master and the Fox Emperor are still trying to vie for the treasure! Why isn't the Motherf*cking Human King stepping up to stop them?\"</p><br/><p>\"What are you worried about? Can't you see how calm the Motherf*cking Human King looks? He'll definitely be able to take care of them later!\"</p><br/><p>\"Oh, that makes sense.\"</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>Grandmaster Yun was feeling a little awkward at this moment. He had witnessed the kick as clearly as he could have. The kick had landed squarely on the little donger of the Sovereign King Zheng. However, what Grandmaster Yun could not understand was that in case of a powerful being such as Sovereign King Zheng, his body should have already been cultivated to a certain toughness! How was he still feeling pain from this?</p><br/><p>Could it be that there was something different about that kick earlier?</p><br/><p>As for Grandmaster Wu He of the Battle Emperor Sect, his entire face was flushed red right now. His heart was palpitating unusually. To think that this would be the final outcome on things. By now, the vast, boundless sea of 10,000,000 troops Ancient race army was already left with less than half of them.</p><br/><p>Sovereign King Wei was dead!</p><br/><p>Sovereign King Qi was dead!</p><br/><p>Even Sovereign King Zheng wasn't too far from death's door right now.</p><br/><p>As for the Evil Alliance Palace Master and the Fox Emperor, they weren't that much of an issue now.</p><br/><p>At this moment, even if the Motherf*cking Human King weren't around any longer, they'd be able to hold out. While they might not be able to kill those two with their own strength, it'd be enough to have them retreating.</p><br/><p>Just what sort of a talented prodigy was this Motherf*cking Human Emperor? By the looks of it, he didn't seem to be all that old. But, to think that he would possess such strength to him. This was simply way too horrifying.</p><br/><p>\"It's getting late now, Sovereign King Zheng. Time to send you on your way.\" Lin Fan laughed coldly.</p><br/><p>The experience points he had gotten from Sovereign King Qi's kill earlier on was pretty decent. If he were to kill Sovereign King Zheng as well, he would be more than halfway through his experience bar right now.</p><br/><p>Within the Paradise, the Supreme Grade Dao Weapon, Battle Thorn, was already being split up by the others. As a Supreme Grade Dao Weapon, the amount of power that it possessed was incredible. Ever since it was brought into the Paradise, it brought with it a great deal of strength as well.</p><br/><p>This was especially the case for treasures such as Demon City, Flying Heavens, and the others. They borrowed the strength of this Supreme Graded Dao Weapon and comprehended quite a bit of Law from it. It would certainly be useful for their growth in the future.</p><br/><p>\"BEAST! I SWEAR THAT THE ANCIENT RACE WILL NOT REST UNTIL WE HAVE YOU DEAD!\" Sovereign King Zheng howled out. However, he couldn't move even if he wanted to right now.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan opened up his palm and swiped every bit of valuables on Sovereign King Zheng's body clean.</p><br/><p>There was only a single storage ring. Opening it up, Lin Fan nodded his head in approval.</p><br/><p>100,000,000 Shengyang Pills. This wasn't considered too little. He himself had just a bit more than 200,000,000 Shengyang Pills.</p><br/><p>While this might seem a lot on paper, each time he went ham, the amount of Shengyang Pills expended was extremely horrifying.</p><br/><p>Sovereign King Zheng was looking at Lin Fan with hatred right now. That malevolent expression on his face was enough to have anyone getting goosebumps just looking at him.</p><br/><p>\"LITTLE BEAST! EVEN IF YOU WANT TO KILL ME, I'LL HAVE YOU PAY THE PRICE FOR IT! YOUR SOVEREIGN KING HERE SHALL ENSURE THAT YOU'LL HAVE NO PLACE TO HIDE FROM THIS DAY FORTH. YOUR SOVEREIGN KING HERE WILL HAVE YOU WATCHING EVERYONE YOU CARE AND LOVE DIE AT YOUR SIDE ONE BY ONE. YOUR SOVEREIGN KING HERE CURSES YOU. I'LL CURSE THAT YOU WILL HAVE A HELL OF A DEATH! BLOOD TRIBUTE!\"</p><br/><p>Suddenly at this moment, Sovereign King Zheng's body gleamed with a sinister red glow. From all seven apertures of his head, fresh blood oozed out. The blood seemed to possess a consciousness as it began to twist and contort into an evil looking symbol.</p><br/><p>The moment Grandmaster Yun caught sight of his, his face changed into shock, \"Lin Fan, watch out now! That's the Blood Tribute of the Sovereign King Zheng! If you're tainted by that blood, no matter where you head to from here on forth, the Ancient race will always be able to track you down!\"</p><br/><p>\"HAHAHA! IT'S TOO LATE! IT'S ALL TOO LATE! I'LL HAVE ALL OF YOU DRAGGED DOWN INTO HELL WITH YOUR SOVEREIGN KING HERE! THE LORD UTMOST BEING WILL NEVER LET YOU GUYS OFF!\" Sovereign King Zheng laughed wildly. This laugh was extremely frightening to hear.</p><br/><p>Everyone's face changed immediately. No matter where they were, they would be found by the Ancient race. Didn't that mean that there was nowhere they could hide ever?</p><br/><p>Being tracked openly by the Ancient race... What difference was there from being dead?</p><br/><p>\"Oh, to think that you would still dare to try some weird antics at the brink of your death! Alright then, it's time to let you know today that your so called Blood Tribute has as much use to Your Motherf*cking King here as pubic hair.\" Lin Fan placed his feet forward. Instantly, he appeared before the face of the Sovereign King Zheng.</p><br/><p>Blood Sea started churning.</p><br/><p>\"I'll accept your Essence Blood then!\"</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>\"N-NO\u2026!!!\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

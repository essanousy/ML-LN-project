But, it\u2019s a pity we lost two elders.\u201d Tian Fengling said with regret.</p><br/><p>The Grandmaster of the Kunlun God Sect nodded his head, \u201cI had wasted a hundred years of my time to lay down a heaven revolting mystic skill and repress down the Heaven and Earth Sect\u2019s fortune. Who would have thought that this unforeseen accident would happen for the Heaven and Earth Sect to be able to recruit in a disciple who could change their fortune like that? But, things are good now. Even though we can\u2019t have him killed, it\u2019s good enough to suppress him for a hundred years.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right! After a hundred years, he would remain the same while the world would have changed. By then, no matter how heaven revolting he is, it would be no issue.\u201d Tian Fengling laughed out while saying.</p><br/><p>\u201cSealing the void, isolating his Spirit Qi, blocking out his consciousness from transmitting messages\u2026 I trust that you have ensured that there\u2019re no loopholes, right?\u201d The Grandmaster of the Kunlun God Sect, Tai Qiantian, asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cGrandmaster, you can rest assured. Even though I\u2019ve only sent down my consciousness this time around, I\u2019ve already trapped that kid with the Kunlun God Mountian. Even if Han Juntian himself were to pass through that area, he would definitely not be able to discover and realize that his precious disciple is being trapped under it.\u201d Tian Fengling said with confidence.</p><br/><p>Tai Qiantian nodded his head, \u201cThat\u2019s good! Right now, the Old Masters are trying to break through to the Heavenly Lord state and are in a critical stage. Only, no one knows if they\u2019ll be able to make it through.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s more difficult than difficult itself. The Heavenly Lord state is mysterious beyond description. Across all of the ancient times, there have been countless ambitious, powerful beings who had tried to break through to the Heavenly Lord state. However, all of them ended in defeat eventually.\u201d Tian Fengling said warily. At the same time, he too was yearning to reach that Heavenly Lord state. That was the highest cultivation state in all of the ancient times. As long as one could break through to the Heavenly Lord state, they would be indestructible for all of eternity. Even if the skies were to topple over or the Sun and Moon were to be destroyed, they would live within the universe, carefree and relaxed.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Old Masters have already headed over to the Ethereal World and are killing countless of Demonic Gods to cultivate great Immortal Grade elixirs. There should be a good chance of it. As long as the Kunlun God Sect can have a single Heavenly Lord as a backing, we shall reign supreme across the entire Endless Mainland. But, even if they can\u2019t break through the barriers of the Heavenly Lord state, the Kunlun God Sect must suppress the Heaven and Earth Sect no matter what.\u201d Tai Qiantian said.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s of course. Recently, that Qin Shengjun of the God Essence Sect has come over seeking the use of our Kunlun God Fire to cultivate his mystic skill. With that, we\u2019ve already come to an agreement. Once the treasure secret ground opens up, he can allow the Kunlun God Sect to have three disciples entering that place. As for the three disciples, we\u2019ve got to deliberate on our candidates properly.\u201d Tian Fengling said.</p><br/><p>\u201cHais! To think that the God Essence Sect could have actually uncovered a prodigy such as that Qin Shengjun. Rumors have it that Qin Shengjun possesses the greatest treasure key in the entire Endless Mainland which is coveted by many. Hell, even the people in the God Essence Sect themselves are coveting it. But now that Qin Shengjun has already grown considerably strong, even the God Essence Sect does not dare to rein him in too tightly, lest this golden chicken of theirs decides to leave them. By then, their losses would be tremendous.\u201d Tai Qiantian added on.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut, Qin Shengjun naturally knows of these things. Right now, we\u2019re scheming alongside a tiger, but that Qin Shengjun is doing exactly the same thing. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve got to hurry our Grandmaster Candidates back so that they can follow him into the treasure ground.\u201d Tian Fengling was thinking hard in his mind. The strength of this Qin Shengjun was extraordinary. He would definitely not allow someone of their level to accompany him into the treasure ground.</p><br/><p>That was a concern of Qin Shengjun as well. If he were to allow people like Tian Fengling and the others to enter with him, he would not be able to maintain control over them.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>At this moment, under the Kunlun God Mountain\u2026</p><br/><p>Lin Fan cried to the Heaven and the Earth, but to no avail no matter what. He was feeling a little exasperated in his heart right now.</p><br/><p>Even though his powers were rumbling, there seemed to be some mysterious aura that this Kunlun God Mountain possessed, locking his powers within his own body entirely and preventing him from pushing them out.</p><br/><p>The Source of Power gushed out and burst forth.</p><br/><p>His strength was even enough to move mountains and rivers right now. But despite that, there was no reaction from this God Mountain at all. Evidently, this couldn\u2019t work.</p><br/><p>\u201cBloody hell! That f*cker is simply way too bloody savage!\u201d Lin Fan wasn\u2019t afraid of anything except for the other party playing dirty and sealing him like this.</p><br/><p>Therefore, the current situation right now was the one which Lin Fan was the most afraid of.</p><br/><p>The connate Element of Earth was his great tool for digging into the ground. But at this moment, there was no use to it at all. The entire Earth was being shrouded by a bright beam of light such that he couldn\u2019t do anything at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cMotherf*cking Kunlun God Dog Sect! You had better not let Your Daddy come out! Otherwise, I\u2019ll definitely fight with you guys all the way to the end!\u201d Lin Fan roared in his heart that was filled with hate.</p><br/><p>He had not expected that the beings of the Kunlun God Sect would truly be this shameless. Since the weaker beings couldn\u2019t do anything, the powerful beings came to take him down immediately without even a single bit of hesitation! They didn\u2019t even try to beep beep him with nonsense, giving him no time to react at all!</p><br/><p>If that fella had wasted more of his breath on him, he might perhaps have been able to come up with a plan to escape or something. But as people said, \u2018man plans, god intervenes\u2019. This was the true beginning of his misery right now.</p><br/><p>He had to think up of a way to get out of this place quickly. Otherwise, if he were to be sealed here for a hundred years or even longer, he would really be f*cked!</p><br/><p>That group of people from the Ancient Saint World were still awaiting his salvation!</p><br/><p>He could not afford any delays right now!</p><br/><p>\u201cFlying Heavens!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan had initially wanted to take out this Legendary Weapon that specialized in drilling holes so that he could bore a hole through this God Mountain or whatnot. But to his utter surprise, Flying Heavens was just stuck there without being able to move at all!</p><br/><p>\u2018Kunlun God Mountain: Item of Tian Fengling\u2019s true body that has been cultivated to an Immortal Weapon of his own life. Grade: Supreme Grade Immortal Weapon. Able to suppress all living beings in the world, and is as heavy as a part of the Heaven and Earth itself.\u2019</p><br/><p>Making use of the System, Lin Fan checked out the properties of this Kunlun God Mountain.</p><br/><p>He knew that his consciousness had already been sealed in this place completely, and there was no way he could seek external help. However, he wasn\u2019t someone who would admit defeat just like that. No matter what methods he had to face, he would have to give it a shot.</p><br/><p>Pills Through Thought.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Lin Fan\u2019s hands moved slightly. He had to see if this would work at all.</p><br/><p>The flames of Pills Through Thought could burn through everything, just like the Heaven and Earth Smelt could refine everything.</p><br/><p>However, this ball of flames was slightly less useful because it could not leave his body and only remain burning on top of his palms. He could only deploy it on opponents to affect them under special circumstances.</p><br/><p>Sizzle, crackle, burn!</p><br/><p>The flames surged out, and when they made contact with this Kunlun God Mountain, something that excited Lin Fan happened! The part of the God Mountain above his palm suddenly had a hole burnt through it!</p><br/><p>\u201cHoly f*ck! I\u2019ve got a plan now!\u201d At this moment, Lin Fan\u2019s heart leaped with joy, \u201cHAHA! Dogsh*t! I suppose that even you would not have thought that Your Daddy would have a Legendary Item as such, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen bloody burn it! Burn it even more miserably than you can ever imagine or handle!\u201d Lin Fan\u2019s heart leaped with joy.</p><br/><p>There was already some space in the area above his right palm. So, his palm changed direction and continued burning.</p><br/><p>At this moment, within the depths of the Kunlun God Mountain, the Weapon Spirit was lying there deep in slumber. He had yet to notice what was going on with his body.</p><br/><p>But Tian Fengling, who was far away in the Kunlun God Sect right now, suddenly felt his heart palpitating. He then frowned and flew through the endless time and space to land on the Kunlun God Mountain.</p><br/><p>At this point, there was no change going on inside the Kunlun God Mountain. That disciple of the Heaven and Earth Sect was still being trapped there.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust what in the world is going on here? Why do I get this uneasy feeling?\u201d Tian Fengling was nagged by it in his heart.</p><br/><p>The Kunlun God Mountain was extremely huge, and Lin Fan had only just burnt a small part of it. Therefore, Tian Fengling naturally did not notice anything at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe\u2026\u201d Lin Fan was sniggering out. This fella had dared to suppress Your Daddy here, hadn\u2019t he? After he got out, he would definitely not let that fella have it easy. He must have the other party spitting out blood before he was finally appeased.</p><br/><p>And with that, Lin Fan immersed in his digging operation once more.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

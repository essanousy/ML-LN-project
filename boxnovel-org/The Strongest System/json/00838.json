With its main body dissected, it was only left with its Weapon Spirit right now. While the Chaos Fiend Coffin might recognize the Evil Lord as its Master, it possessed a consciousness of its own. Now that it was in deep peril, the Weapon Spirit of the Chaos Fiend Coffin naturally would think of self preservation.</p><br/><p>After cultivating this far and going through all sorts of trials and tribulations, how could it die as such?</p><br/><p>Indignance!</p><br/><p>An immense feeling of indignance surged into the mind of the Chaos Fiend Coffin's Weapon Spirit.</p><br/><p>\"When one walks at the riversides for a long time, they would eventually get their shoes wet.\" Lin Fan lamented. By the looks of it, the Evil Lord had wanted to come at him with his life. To think that he would be so cowardly.</p><br/><p>Being able to run off after putting on an act\u2026 How great that must have felt!</p><br/><p>However, the problem that Lin Fan had to face right now was that the Weapon Spirit of this Chaos Fiend Coffin could explode at a moment's notice.</p><br/><p>\"Save me\u2026 Save me!\"</p><br/><p>At this moment, the Weapon Spirit of the Fiend Coffin placed its hopes on Lin Fan. He hoped that Lin Fan could save him.</p><br/><p>The Weapon Spirit knew just how frightening self destruction was. If he were to self destruct, he would disappear from the face of the world forever, without even a single scrap left.</p><br/><p>However, he was indignant! He had painstakingly cultivated to this point! If he were to disappear just like that, all of his past efforts would have been for naught!</p><br/><p>\"What the f*ck is this? Without a main body and only a Weapon Spirit? Not only that, the Weapon Spirit could blow up at any moment? Isn't this just absolutely useless?\"</p><br/><p>At this moment, Lin Fan was stuck in a slight dilemma. He felt that things hadn't gone all too smoothly this time around. Initially, Lin Fan had thought that he would just purify the Evil Lord and snatch over all of his treasures.</p><br/><p>But, by the looks of things now, that was obviously not too possible anymore.</p><br/><p>This bloody scammy piece of sh*t Evil Lord had just put on an act and ran off straight away! And not only that, he had left this Fiend Coffin in a self destructing state before running off!</p><br/><p>It was really a bloody loss this time around, a huge and complete loss!</p><br/><p>\"ARGH!\"</p><br/><p>At this moment, the Weapon Spirit roared out. The black blob of flesh began to pulsate even more violently, as a boundless amount of power began to seep out of it. Even a single trace of that power was enough to cause the voids to vibrate out.</p><br/><p>This was an Utmost Treasure! If an Utmost Treasure were to blow up, the impact that it could cause would be something that could shake the entire world!</p><br/><p>Heaven and Earth Smelt!</p><br/><p>Without any hesitation, Lin Fan summoned out the Heaven and Earth Smelt instantly, then kept this blob of flesh within it directly.</p><br/><p>\"Smelt!\"</p><br/><p>Before this Weapon Spirit were to self destruct, he might as well smelt it. Who knew if he might be able to smelt out something useful.</p><br/><p>\"SAVE ME! SAVE ME!!!\"</p><br/><p>Within the Heaven and Earth Smelt, the Weapon Spirit was wailing out. As a sacred weapon of the Outworld Fiends, it had existed for a really long time now, definitely nothing short of 10,000 years. But, to think that it would meet with such an outcome right now!</p><br/><p>In the blink of an eye, the power of smelting burst forth.</p><br/><p>'Ding\u2026 Congratulations on obtaining Evil Thoughts Core.'</p><br/><p>'Evil Thoughts Core: Source of all evil thoughts in the Infinite Worlds. Sinister, horrifying, and vile. Myriad of uses.'</p><br/><p>'After smelting, it can be used as the Source of Evil Thoughts and take control of all Evil Thoughts within the world in order to boost one's powers. Side effects not known.'</p><br/><p>Retrieving this Evil Thoughts Core from the Heaven and Earth Smelt, Lin Fan's face was bewildered.</p><br/><p>\"What in the world is up with this thing?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shrugged his head and tossed it within his storage. When he had the time, he would give it a good look. As for now, he did not want to think too much about it anymore.</p><br/><p>Now that the Evil Lord has left, this little world here was about to cave in.</p><br/><p>Initially, Lin Fan had thought that this sacrificial altar would be of some use. But, after touching it with his finger for quite some time, there was nothing that came out of it! It was just a completely useless sacrificial altar!</p><br/><p>\"Let's go.\"</p><br/><p>Sweeping his robes, Lin Fan kept the Ancient One and Cruel into his Paradise, then broke through the crystallized walls of this little world straight before leaving it.</p><br/><p>When he arrived outside, Lin Fan looked at his surroundings. For a moment or so, he did not know where he had wandered off to.</p><br/><p>The Evil Alliance was hidden within a pocket dimension, and had no fixed location. Every single second, it was changing a location altogether. Lin Fan's position right now depended entirely on where the Evil Alliance had floated off to.</p><br/><p>And just as Lin Fan determined where he was exactly, he noticed that there was bloodshed somewhere in the distance. And amidst the bloodshed, there was even a torrential force backing it.</p><br/><p>\"There are people fighting! Not only that, there're quite a number of casualties!\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan's brows twitched in joy. He loved it when it came to people fighting! These were the fastest shortcuts to getting rich!</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was secretly praying in his heart that it was some powerful beings who were fighting! If that were the case, he could earn some profits out of it!</p><br/><p>In a flash, Lin Fan dove into the void and headed into the distance.</p><br/><p>Right now, in a patch of sky somewhere\u2026</p><br/><p>A figure stood tall between the Heavens and Earth.</p><br/><p>This figure was calm and expressionless, without any anger or rage. Both its arms were surrounded by golden rings circle after circle.</p><br/><p>When he jerked both arms gently, the golden rings vibrated, and a boundless amount of power burst forth from it.</p><br/><p>The powerful figures who were surrounding this lone figure started having their bodies torn apart, creating a rain of blood that showered down onto the world.</p><br/><p>\"ARGH!\"</p><br/><p>A series of horrified cries rang out from the mouths of those living beings who were sitting crippled on the floor.</p><br/><p>\"Female Empress\u2026 come on out! Otherwise, these Fox race beings are going to die because of you!\"</p><br/><p>The figure that was standing in the void was an imposing figure from the Ancient race.</p><br/><p>Even though there was only a single Ancient race being, all of the Fox race beings who had the majority in numbers did not dare to budge a single inch. All of them were shivering uncontrollably.</p><br/><p>\"Hmph! You dream on!\" The leader of the Fox race beings was a small girl. By the looks of it, she wasn't all that old, twelve to thirteen years old at best. However, her face was firm and resolute. She wasn't fearful even in the face of this Ancient race being.</p><br/><p>\"Huehue! Little brat, you ant like existence!\" This Ancient race being was an Utmost Being. His name was Fault.</p><br/><p>\"Xuan Xuan, we will be with you!\" Around this girl from the Fox race were a couple of young living beings surrounding her. These living beings did not look too old either. However, at this moment, they too were unfazed as they looked at that Ancient race being in rage.</p><br/><p>\"I'm sorry, everyone.\" Xuan Xuan apologized.</p><br/><p>Her Master was the Female Empress. She had been running around, exploring the Ancient Saint World for the past few years, and had gotten to form a group of young little comrades as well. Later on, she heard that her Master had met a Sovereign King of the Ancient race while passing by her village. Her Master then extended a helping hand and helped save her village. However, she sustained some injuries as a result of that. The moment Xuan Xuan heard about that, she rushed back immediately.</p><br/><p>And, all of these little comrades of hers followed along naturally. But, who would have expected that an Utmost Being of the Ancient race would appear!</p><br/><p>\"Xuan Xuan, what are you saying? We are all good friends. Even if it's dangerous, we wouldn't be afraid at all.\" A chick from the Wings race bore a slightly pale look on her face right now. However, she spoke out while forcefully trying to maintain her cool.</p><br/><p>Xuan Xuan looked around at the masses with a look of gratitude.</p><br/><p>\"Female Empress, since you refuse to come out, then all of these people can go to hell!\" Fault hollered out. Sending a palm strike across, the entire world shook in the face of it as though it could collapse down.</p><br/><p>This boundless power descended right down from the Heavens. For Xuan Xuan and the others, there was absolutely no way they could defend against this.</p><br/><p>And just as Xuan Xuan and the others were about to be the recipients of this lethal blow's descent, a figure floated out before them and dispersed the punch instantly.</p><br/><p>\"Master!\" When Xuan'er caught sight of who it was, her heart tightened up as she cried out emotionally.</p><br/><p>The Female Empress raised her head and looked at Fault with a solemn face. Even though she was a powerful being of Divine celestial level 10, Eternal God state, she was still far too weak compared to the Utmost Being.</p><br/><p>She knew that the Utmost Beings had been hunting down for her and the Namo Saint Emperor. While she did not know how the Namo Saint Emperor was doing right now, she reckoned that he shouldn't be leading too easy a life right now either.</p><br/><p>\"Xuan'er, take your fellow race beings with you and leave first. Your Master shall hold it here for you.\" The Female Empress said.</p><br/><p>\"Master! But\u2026!\" Xuan'er shook her head, not wanting to leave.</p><br/><p>\"Hurry up.\" The Female Empress pushed.</p><br/><p>This time around, the Female Empress knew that the odds were stacked against her. But, if she could even hold him back for a short period of time, that would be pretty good as well.</p><br/><p>When she had killed off five Sovereign Kings earlier on, she had already sustained some substantially heavy injuries. Even though she had made quite the remarkable recovery by now, she was up against an Utmost Being of the Ancient race. She still had not much confidence towards this.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

He was a Master God, someone who controlled and reigned over a part of the world! Yet, he found himself suffering from such a wretched death in the hands of this Indigenous Being. In fact, he hadn\u2019t even had the chance to use a single one of his moves! If the Heavens were to give him another chance, he would dare to swear to it that even if he had to die in battle, he would choose it over such a lowly death!</p><br/><p>An extremely strong sense of indignance burst forth from the body of the Chasm Master God.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan retracted his dagger while nudging at the body of the Chasm Master God. But to his surprise, the body of the Chasm Master God was totally stiff to the touch!</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026 Congratulations on killing Chasm Master God.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026 Experience Points + \u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>The notification from the System rang out, causing Lin Fan\u2019s heart to skip with joy. However, he was still astonished over how the corpse of the Chasm Master God wasn\u2019t even budging a single bit at all! It was just like a heavy mountain that was crashing down right now.</p><br/><p>BOOM!</p><br/><p>All of a sudden, Lin Fan realized that there was a formidable aura erupting forth from the body of the Chasm Master God, as a surge of God Power pierced all the way into the Heavens.</p><br/><p>The currents of the void up above were split apart by this, forming a Calamity Cloud.</p><br/><p>At that moment, a robustly firm void sounded out of the body of the Chasm Master God.</p><br/><p>\u201cI, the Chasm Master God, have died with indignance! I\u2019M INDIGNANT\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>The brows of the Boundless Future Buddha Lord knitted up. He had not expected that this lad would actually be this underhanded! Furthermore, he could not have imagined that the resentment stemming from this Chasm Master God would actually be this immense that he could even gather God Power after dying to form a single strand of his Vengeful Will, which could drift out between the Heaven and Earth!</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was slightly bewildered, although he could tell that this was the Vengeful Will of the Chasm Master God. To think that a Master God would have been able to cultivate it out.</p><br/><p>This was a situation that Lin Fan knew about. When powerful beings were faced with a situation of extreme indignance, they could cultivate and form a single trace of Vengeful Will. There was no material body or soul to it, let alone any bit of spiritual consciousness. It was nothing more than a vengeful spirit that was floating out between the entire world.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019M INDIGNANT! I\u2019M JUST INDIGNANT\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan pursed his lips. Even if this guy was indignant, he would have to suck it up.</p><br/><p>As he opened his mouth, a formidable suction force emerged, swallowing that trace of Vengeful Will from the Chasm Master God right into his tummy.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026 Absorbed negative will. System shall suppress it.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026 Comprehended Power of Chasm.\u2019</p><br/><p>At that moment, Lin Fan was truly curious. He had suddenly discovered a tiny little God Core floating out within his body! Now THAT was perplexing.</p><br/><p>When the Boundless Future Buddha Lord saw how Lin Fan had devoured that Vengeful Will of the Chasm Master God into his tummy, he broke out into laughter. That was something that contained the resentment of the Chasm Master God! If any ordinary person were to take it into their tummies, they would definitely be affected by this berserk Vengeful Will. Once this lad started to try and refine it, it would definitely be the right time for him to make his move.</p><br/><p>But suddenly, he realized that the lad did not seem to have any changes happening to him. It was as though he was totally unaffected by that trace of Vengeful Will!</p><br/><p>Lin Fan cast his sight toward the Boundless Future Buddha Lord. \u201cBald monk, there\u2019s just us left here right now. Now, how do you think I should deal with you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Filled with disdain, the Boundless Future Buddha Lord scoffed out coldly, \u201cWith just your capabilities?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled out with ease, \u201cHow can we tell unless we give it a shot? Could you have failed to notice that the strength of Yours Truly has gotten even stronger than before?\u201d</p><br/><p>Upon hearing that reply from Lin Fan, the Boundless Future Buddha Lord froze up slightly, his expression changing gradually. Indeed, he had discovered that the strength of this lad seemed to have risen by a significant chunk once more.</p><br/><p>This\u2026</p><br/><p>How could this be?</p><br/><p>Just as the Boundless Future Buddha Lord was still being bothered by it, Lin Fan bolted into the void in a flash, attacking the Boundless Future Buddha Lord directly.</p><br/><p>Given the current situation, he felt that he had what it took to try going at this Boundless Future Buddha Lord for a good round. As for how the eventual outcome would be, well, that would just have to depend on their respective fates then.</p><br/><p>It was basically a fifty-fifty given the current situation. However, Lin Fan knew that his chances were slightly higher in reality. After all, that Boundless Future Buddha Lord had to keep his guard up against him.</p><br/><p>\u201cB*stard!\u201d The Boundless Future Buddha Lord had not expected that things would turn out as such once more. Earlier on when he had tried to f*ck this lad over with the Radiant Master God, the Radiant Master God died as a result with he himself had no other choice but to make a break for it. And the previous time around, he had so many Master Gods with him, yet they had still managed to let this lad give them the slip! That was just a bloody huge humiliation!</p><br/><p>As for this time, he was almost going crazy from anger.</p><br/><p>He had come together with four Master Gods to gang up on this lad. But, to think that at the end of the day, those four Master Gods would be killed instead! Just what in the world was up with these situations? He just could not wrap his head around it!</p><br/><p>\u201cBuddha Lord!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Boundless Future Buddha Lord did not have any intention of yielding at all as he counterattacked with a Buddha Palm that was tantamount to the Heavens. That palm crushed down from the skies, suppressing everything with an unparalleled Buddhist Power.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smirked out at that sight, \u201cI see that you\u2019ve got some capabilities. To think that you would try to just fight back with brute force, eh? Aren\u2019t you afraid of Yours Truly\u2019s soap anymore?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph\u2026!\u201d The Boundless Future Buddha Lord snorted out coldly. He felt that he had been too scared of this lad. Come to think of it, that was really one hell of an embarrassment.</p><br/><p>BAM!</p><br/><p>With that strike, a tremendous power burst forth. If this were in the past, Lin Fan would have never been able to come at the Boundless Future Buddha Lord head on. However, things were different now. His own strength had already grown so much that he basically had nothing to fear anymore.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled out coldly, \u201cBald monk, you\u2019re not going to be able to cut it anymore. But don\u2019t worry, it won\u2019t be long before you die in the hands of Yours Truly.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Boundless Future Buddha Lord felt his heart clench up. The rate in which this lad\u2019s strength had grown was just absolutely astounding. If he were to give this lad more time, it might truly be as he had described \u2014 the Boundless Future Buddha Lord would not be able to defeat him anymore. But, how was all of this even possible in the first place? He was THE Boundless Future Buddha Lord; someone who was going to attain the great Dao of the Heavenly Lord! How could he possibly lose to a lad as such?</p><br/><p>Lin Fan hurled out a single punch, bringing with it such immensity that it tore the entire void around that area. The Buddha Lord Golden Body of the Boundless Future Buddha Lord had an extremely high defense. At the same time, because he was fighting against Lin Fan with all he had, the Future Gear revolving around him was emanating out a bright streak of Buddhist light.</p><br/><p>This was the Power of Future \u2014 he had mastered control over the Future Buddha Power.</p><br/><p>The entire world had already started crumbling under this ferocious battle. For the moment, the Boundless Future Buddha Lord found himself incapable of taking down Lin Fan. He grit his teeth, knowing that it wasn\u2019t possible for him to have this lad killed this time around anymore. He then dove into the void. \u201cLad, you had better watch out!\u201d</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan noticed that the Boundless Future Buddha Lord was going to run, he bolted right into the void as well. But, how could he give him that chance? \u201cWatch your mother! Today, we\u2019re going to fight it out to our deaths! It\u2019s going to end either with your or my death! Run your mother! Get the f*ck back\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Boundless Future Buddha Lord turned his head around. He had not expected that a day as such would ever come for him as well \u2014 the lad was chasing him in hot pursuit. He had no plans of letting him escape in peace at all!</p><br/><p>Damn it! This was just the epitome of being accursed!</p><br/><p>\u201cYOU\u2019RE JUST COURTING DEATH\u2026!\u201d The Boundless Future Buddha Lord bellowed out in a furious mad rage.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan sniggered out in response, \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know whether or not I\u2019m courting death. But say, how about you come to a stop first and we\u2019ll have a good chat\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Boundless Future Buddha Lord did not stop at all. Right now, the last thing he wanted to do was to waste any more time. He felt that he had a pressing need to hurry and finish his plan as soon as possible.</p><br/><p>As of this moment, everything that was happening had far surpassed his calculations.</p><br/><p>The only true path to home was when he would attain the Dao of the Heavenly Lord! By that time, no one between the Heaven and Earth would be a match for him anymore!</p><br/><p>As for this lad, he would be able to crush him the same way he would squish an ant to death by then!</p><br/><p>As of now\u2026?</p><br/><p><strong><em>Stop your f*cking mother!</em></strong></p></div>\n</div>"}

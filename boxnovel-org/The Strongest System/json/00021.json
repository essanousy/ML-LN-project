But this was only temporary. Upon exiting his house, Lin Fan\u2019s heart sudden rose. Aside from the outer sect\u2019s top ten geniuses holding some potential, the others were essentially nothing. But no matter how small the fly, it was still meat. Though they couldn\u2019t provide \u300aEternal Demon Body\u300b with any more experience points, they could still properly provide \u300aMonkey Steals Peach\u300b with some.</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan arrived at the dining hall, he glanced about with his bright eyes, \u2018I wonder what I might run into today. I am rather looking forward to it.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><br/><p>At this time, Lin Fan saw a situation up ahead, his heart leaping with joy as he waved towards his experience farm. Lin Fan quickened his pace, giving a shout,\u201d My fellow two brothers, don\u2019t argue. I will help you resolve the issue.\u201d After hearing Lin Fan\u2019s words, the two arguing disciples glanced over and became scared out of their wits.</p><br/><p>\u201cHurry, it\u2019s that guy. Recently, many fellow brothers have fallen to him.\u201d The previously arguing two people at this point acted like friends that hadn\u2019t seen each other in days. They grabbed each other by the shoulders and instantly retreated, not even bothering to wait for the calling Lin Fan and just hastily ran away.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck\u2026\u201d seeing the scene in front of him, Lin Fan became speechless, \u2018What\u2019s with them?\u2019 Lin Fan sighed while shaking his head. This situation had caught him totally off guard. But Lin Fan\u2019s heart was very strong, one failure wouldn\u2019t be able to stop his advance. Lin Fan ran forward once again, looking for more opportunities.</p><br/><p>Though the outer sect disciple\u2019s area was rather peaceful, arguments and fights still would break out quite often. So Lin Fan wasn\u2019t afraid that he would have nothing to do. Currently, Lin Fan\u2019s eyes lit up again as he bounded forth, but this time, Lin Fan played it smart and waited until he was in front of the two people before asking.</p><br/><p>But then something that made Lin Fan feel a bit hurt happened. The two people\u2019s expression immediately changed after seeing Lin Fan, as if they had just met a ghost.</p><br/><p>\u201cCrazy Peach Stealing Demon\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The disciples blurted out but immediately closed their mouth in fear, as if they had done something bad, and without another care instantly ran away. The previously excited Lin Fan couldn\u2019t help but have his expression changed upon hearing those words, displaying a bit of disbelief.</p><br/><p>\u2018Crazy Peach Stealing Demon? Are those guys talking about me?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Lin Fan\u2019s heart jumped with joy. How long had he been in the outer sect? \u2018I now finally have obtained a nickname! Crazy Peach Stealing Demon, not bad, not bad!\u2019 Just like that, whenever Lin Fan called out to the other party, they would always run away as if they had seen a ghost. Lin Fan also felt a bit helpless, did his reputation perhaps really become this bad in the outer sect?</p><br/><p>\u2018This doesn\u2019t make sense\u2026 this doesn\u2019t make any sense at all.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Later on that day, the previously excited Lin Fan was feeling utterly helpless. When the outer sect disciples saw him, they would always react like they saw a ghost. One glimpse at him and they would immediately run away. When other disciples saw him, their already calm expressions would become even more cautious, as if they were afraid their peaches would also be stolen.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan sighed. It looked like the methods he came up with wouldn\u2019t work on those outer sect disciples anymore.</p><br/><p>He would need to change his strategy from now on. Lin Fan then suddenly remembered the outer sect\u2019s top ten geniuses. It seemed there was a need to go investigate them. \u2018These outer sect\u2019s top ten geniuses, if their cultivation base was too high, then \u300aEternal Demon Body\u300b might not be able to withstand against them. I need to take this slowly.\u2019 If he could do it, then it would definitely be another wave of mockery.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>At night...</p><br/><p>Lin Fan stealthily sneaked outside. Since the sect\u2019s disciples had already gone to sleep, the outside was empty, which allowed Lin Fan to begin his path of forging. During the morning, Lin Fan thought of a problem. This profession perhaps had something to do with the material he exchanged. After all, how could a legendary weapon be formed with something like a single brick?</p><br/><p>So Lin Fan decided to experiment on this tomorrow. For tonight, he would just use these bricks to level up his blacksmith profession that was already level seven. Just a bit more effort tonight and he might be able to raise it to level eight. Lin Fan came to an unnamed disciple\u2019s house and made a promise that tonight he would definitely be careful and only dismantle the wall, not the entire house.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026 congratulations on crafting broken tile piece, experience + 1.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026 congratulations on crafting a pile of useless clay, experience + 1.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The experience increased little by little as usual. The material was still just tile pieces or clay, but Lin Fan had already relaxed his heart. It was most likely what he thought of earlier about how trash material couldn\u2019t be used to craft anything good.</p><br/><p>The night sky was exquisite and the surroundings quiet, as Lin Fan worked away like a diligent little honey bee. One brick after another was tossed into the furnace. Once one side of the wall was dismantled, Lin Fan would switch to another.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026 congratulations on crafting broken tile piece, experience + 1.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026 congratulations on crafting broken tile piece, experience + 1.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Once the sky started becoming brighter, Lin Fan would then stopped and quietly left. Tonight\u2019s speed was not bad, he had dismantled four walls. His blacksmith profession had already reached level nine, and the distance to leveling up again was quite short.</p><br/><p>Just when he was leaving, Lin Fan picked up the last brick, preparing to call it a night. Although profession might not seem like an important thing, Lin Fan had played games before, so he understood that professions were one of the most powerful existences. If he were able to raise it to the strongest level, then it would become something that could easily wipe the whole field clean.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan then threw the last brick into the furnace, not really paying any attention to it and prepared to leave. He understood that it would most likely just be another broken tile piece.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026 congratulations crafted Legendary Weapon \u201dNine-Five Red Brick.\u201d\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026 congratulations on crafting Legendary Weapon, blacksmith rank + 1.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026 congratulations, blacksmith upgraded to advanced blacksmith.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026 congratulations on crafting Legendary Weapon, character experience + eight million.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026 congratulations on unlocking character storage space.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Lin fan, who was preparing to leave, heard this notification and completely froze up.</p><br/><p>\u2018F*ck\u2026jackpot!\u2019</p><br/><p>Lin Fan couldn\u2019t believe this moment as if he were in a dream. He had already long given up on the bricks. After all, one would never be able to craft a diamond from a pile of clay. They were in two completely different categories.</p><br/><p>But Lin Fan became very excited at this moment. Just how many days, just how many bricks had he destroyed, and right at the moment he was prepared to return, a legendary weapon appeared. What was with this concept? This was God finally rewarding him.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan didn\u2019t think anything more and suppressed his excitement. He then began running, after all, he needed to return back and carefully inspect this. If he were to be caught here by some outer sect disciples, it would be difficult to explain.</p><br/><p>Inside the house, Lin Fan immediately closed the doors and then excitedly lied down on his bed.m</p><br/><p>The blacksmith profession had a total of ten levels and had now upgraded to advance blacksmith. At the same time, it also gave him eight million experience points. The experience he obtained from crafting a legendary weapon was even more than the time he consumed the \u201cSupreme pill.\u201d This was completely unbelievable for Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>If it had just given one million more experience points, he would have broken through to the postcelestial stage. Once one attained postcelestial, they would have formally entered the path of cultivation. All the things one considered impossible before would become possible after entering the postcelestial stage.</p><br/><p>According to hi, this character storage space was similar to the inventory spaces within games, and could be used to store things and such. Lin Fan felt that these were all good stuff. He rubbed his hands and began carefully inspecting the legendary weapon.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

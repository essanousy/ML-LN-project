To think that this Motherf*cking Human King would drag him down the waters!</p><br/><p>Under the boundless and endless Power of Biggra, the Evil Alliance Prince realized that his body was no longer under his control anymore.</p><br/><p>Every single breath he took had a large amount of this mist.</p><br/><p>One by one, pink colored Colossal Dragons wrapped themselves around his heart, destroying and gnawing at him from within.</p><br/><p>\"What in the world is this? Lord Utmost Being\u2026! Argh! ARGH! ARGHHHHHHHHH!!!\"</p><br/><p>The Evil Alliance Prince was going berserk right now. His eyes were flushed red as they let out a berserk gaze.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan's body was flashing intermittently in the sky as he deployed So Near, Yet So Far to its maximum capacity.</p><br/><p>\"Utmost Being Cruel! Watch out now! My buddy, Evil Alliance Prince, is going to go nuts!\" Lin Fan disappeared from the face of the world, leaving these final words before he left.</p><br/><p>Run! Run!</p><br/><p>As far as he could get, he had to run!</p><br/><p>Lin Fan's speed right now had reached a maximum point. However, turning his head around, he realized that the Utmost Being of the Ancient race was already on his tail, holding a head in his hand.</p><br/><p>That head in his hands was that of none other than the Evil Alliance Prince.</p><br/><p>\"Holy f*ck! How in the bloody world is that possible?\" The moment Lin Fan caught sight of this, his goosebumps stood up, evidently in some disbelief.</p><br/><p>No matter what, that Evil Alliance Prince was a powerful being of divine celestial level 7, All in One state! Did he have to die this quickly?!</p><br/><p>At this moment, the eyes on the head of the Evil Alliance Prince were wide open, as though he had had a vengeful death. Or rather, it would be more accurate to say that the Evil Alliance Prince did not even know how he had died even till the last moment.</p><br/><p>That was because in the blink of an eye, the Utmost Being of the Ancient race had already appeared before the face of the Evil Alliance Prince, lifting his hand without any warning. The next thing the Evil Alliance Prince knew, his head had already been separated from his body.</p><br/><p>To a powerful being such as the Evil Alliance Prince, as long as his Essence Spirit did not vanish, he wouldn't perish. Even a single drop of blood could have him revived through it.</p><br/><p>However, in the hands of someone like the Utmost Being of the Ancient race, there was no chance of that happening.</p><br/><p>Instantly, the Utmost Being of the Ancient race had just swallowed the body of the Evil Alliance Prince whole. Every single fiber of his being was converted into the power of its core, and was consumed entirely by him.</p><br/><p>As for this head right now, it was just a morbid shell that had nothing within it.</p><br/><p>\"Holy f*ck! Utmost Being Cruel! Why the f*ck are you following me? I'll have you know of my powers!\" Lin Fan's heart was pained right now.</p><br/><p>That was a bloody divine celestial level 7, All in One state powerful being! Initially, he had wanted the other party to act as his meat shield! That was the only reason why he didn't kill the Evil Alliance Prince himself! To think that this bloody Evil Alliance Prince would be this useless to get himself killed by the Utmost Being of the Ancient race in the blink of an eye just like that!</p><br/><p>If he had known that this was the case, he would have done the deed himself!</p><br/><p>\"Motherf*cking Human King, Lin Fan, you shall die today as well.\" The Utmost Being of the Ancient race was hot on Lin Fan's pursuit as he commented calmly.</p><br/><p>To him, this human was akin to an ant. He was someone that he could crush in the blink of an eye. However, the thing that had the Utmost Being of the Ancient race surprised was that this human's speed of escape was pretty darn fast!</p><br/><p>Back when Lin Fan was immersed in the library of the Cloud Sect, he had read intensively. As such, he cultivated some of the skills as well.</p><br/><p>Although they were eventually devoured by the Skill Spirits within his Paradise, their essences were retrieved in order to boost his shortcomings.</p><br/><p>As such, it could only be said that Lin Fan's skills were only getting stronger at the same time. This was especially the case for So Near, Yet So Far. Now that he had mastered it to a certain point, it's speed was absolutely fast, leaving one in the dust from it.</p><br/><p>Now that he had come face to face with the Utmost Being of the Ancient race, Lin Fan realized just how strong he was. In his hands, he was nothing more than a toy.</p><br/><p>\"Holy f*ck! This is too damned vicious! If this were to carry on, I'd definitely be caught by him!\" Lin Fan knew that his speed was already pretty darn fast. However, against the Utmost Being of the Ancient race, this just wasn't fast enough yet.</p><br/><p>To think that a single stride taken by that guy would be akin to crossing an infinite distance as he appeared behind Lin Fan's back.</p><br/><p>\"Motherf*cking Human King, Lin Fan. Hahahahaha\u2026\" The Utmost Being of the Ancient race laughed out, as though he was mocking Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shrugged his head as his mind went into a fuzz. What should he do now? Just what in the world should he do so that he could get out of the hands of this fella?</p><br/><p>\"This guy is toying with me intentionally.\" Lin Fan was fuming in his heart.</p><br/><p>Just like that, the Utmost Being of the Ancient race was following Lin Fan with his hands behind his back. He was just maintaining that small distance between them all the way.</p><br/><p>But, this fella was just refusing to strike out at all. He was just taking his own sweet time, looking at Lin Fan run as though he was waiting to see how long more Lin Fan could run.</p><br/><p>\"You son of a b*tch!\" Lin Fan couldn't bear with it any longer. Taking out his Nine Five Legendary Brick, he braked immediately and swerved around, slamming the brick onto the face of the Utmost Being of the Ancient race.</p><br/><p>Bam!</p><br/><p>The brick landed squarely on the face of the Utmost Being of the Ancient race.</p><br/><p>\"Holy f*ck! Damned fella!\" Lin Fan did not want to think anymore. Since he couldn't run, the worst that could happen was him dying, that's all.</p><br/><p>But right now, there was something that Lin Fan was regretting. Why in the world hadn't the other party fainted from a slam of his Nine Five Legendary Brick? Could it be that it only worked if he slammed it at the back of the head of the other party? But, the Utmost Being of the Ancient race was so strong! How could he possibly get the chance to do that?</p><br/><p>\"Little thing, what's wrong? Why aren't you running anymore?\" The Utmost Being of the Ancient race looked down at Lin Fan with contemptuous eyes and chuckled.</p><br/><p>\"Huff, huff. Run your mother! Come, aren't you just going to eat up Yours Truly? Come on, eat me then!\" Lin Fan patted at his own head and taunted overbearingly.</p><br/><p>\"Yours Truly is going to stand right here today! If you don't eat Yours Truly, you're my little grandson!\" Lin Fan was a little sad right now. This fella was a damned piece of sh*t!</p><br/><p>The Utmost Being, Cruel, looked down on this puny human. After that, he opened up his mouth widely as though it was a gigantic black hole.</p><br/><p>Looking at this black hole like mouth, Lin Fan could not help but feel a little worried.</p><br/><p>Snap!</p><br/><p>Just like that, Lin Fan was swallowed in a single mouthful and disappeared from the world entirely. At this moment, the only feeling Lin Fan could feel was the world revolving around him. His mind was in a state of a mess right now.</p><br/><p>To think that he was truly devoured by this guy!</p><br/><p>What sort of a tragedy was this?</p><br/><p>Lin Fan had never ever felt an exasperation of this sort. This was especially the case upon meeting the Utmost Being of the Ancient race right now. This was the epitome of exasperation. There wasn't anything he could do about this at all.</p><br/><p>Even though his physical body state was that of a divine celestial level 8, Universal Elixir state, it didn't do anything for him before the doppelganger of the Utmost Being of the Ancient race's Essence Spirit.</p><br/><p>In fact, Lin Fan could tell that this doppelganger of the Utmost Being of the Ancient race's Essence Spirit had far surpassed everything. Even a powerful being of the thousands of races with the same divine celestial level 10, Eternal God cultivation state as him wouldn't be his match at all.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Lin Fan floated slowly in a patch of darkness. Suddenly, he jerked opened his eyes. Everything before him was dark and empty. He couldn't even see any hope before him.</p><br/><p>\"That spot of light!\" At this moment, Lin Fan caught sight of a single bit of light at the distance.</p><br/><p>\"I am the Evil Alliance Prince! I can't die! I can't die!\"</p><br/><p>At that moment, a tragic wail rang out. This was the Essence Spirit of the Evil Alliance Prince.</p><br/><p>Just as Lin Fan was about to head up and say hi to him, an astral wind attacked them. The Essence Spirit of the Evil Alliance Prince disappeared entirely, converted into pure power that seeped into the surrounding darkness.</p><br/><p>\"Holy f*ck! This bloody Utmost Being of the Ancient race is just digesting every single living being!\" At this moment, Lin Fan was feeling some slight discomfort and pain in his body. It was as though a corrosive energy was trying to dissolve him.</p><br/><p>\"F*ck! Utmost Being of the Ancient race! Since you dare to swallow Yours Truly into your stomach, you would really take Yours Truly as a pushover if Yours Truly didn't leave some mark here!\" Lin Fan's face changed. Instantly, he summoned out the Heaven and Earth Smelt and dove straight into it.</p><br/><p>'Hmph! With this divine protective item here, time to see how he's going to dissolve Yours Truly!'</p><br/>\n</div>"}

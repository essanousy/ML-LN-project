This man had killed a Grandmaster Candidate of the Kunlun God Sect, sowing a grudge with them in the process. If they were to get too close with this guy, they might end up attracting some trouble for themselves.</p><br/><p>However, since the madam did not seem bothered by it all, he naturally did not say anything more either.</p><br/><p>The death of Long Jinfei did not cause too much of a commotion. It had only spread out in a small area centered around where he was because there was no earthshattering battle. For him to die in three mere stabs as an Ancestor Immortal state being was something that seemed absolutely impossible and unreal.</p><br/><p>Ancestor Immortal state beings could be considered as indestructible existences. Even if their bodies were smashed into smithereens, their consciousness would be able to escape. But, with those three stabs of Lin Fan, consciousness aside, even Long Jinfei\u2019s Laws of Ancestor Immortal state were all totally erased from existence.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is a pretty decent place indeed.\u201d Lin Fan looked around at his surroundings and lamented.</p><br/><p>It might take some time before the death of Long Jinfei would be relayed back to the Kunlun God Sect. As for now, Lin Fan wasn\u2019t afraid in the least bit. What would come would eventually come anyway. While he could still try to dodge it, there was no reason why he should have to live life so tiringly.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease hold your steps.\u201d At this moment, a voice rang out.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan turned his head around and looked at the few people before him. His gaze was especially fixated on the token hanging at the waist of the shawled woman, which read \u2018Suppressing Heavens Demon Faction\u2019.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d With a quick glance, Lin Fan could tell that the cultivation states of those few people were pretty strong. This was especially the case for the burly man standing at the back. To think that he would be an Ancestor Immortal state upper level being!</p><br/><p>As for that shawled woman, her cultivation state was at the Ancestor Immortal lower level. The rest of them weren\u2019t really worth Lin Fan\u2019s attention, mere Golden Immortal ants. Heck, they weren\u2019t even full cultivation state beings.</p><br/><p>The woman spoke up while chuckling, \u201cFor someone to be able to still walk around so carefreely after killing the Grandmaster Candidate of the Kunlun God Sect, this IS the first time I\u2019m coming across something like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shrugged his shoulders, \u201cIt\u2019s nothing much, I suppose. Although, what do YOU guys want?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNothing much either! Just wanna make friends, I suppose.\u201d The woman replied nonchalantly.</p><br/><p>Right now, Lin Fan had an urge to chop the other party to death. Not only were their cultivation states pretty decent, they were even people of Demonic Sects. Even if he were to chop them to death, it would be exacting justice for the Heavens, and he wouldn\u2019t even have to feel bad in his consciousness. Who knew, he might even be thanked for it!</p><br/><p>But of course, those were just mere thoughts in his mind. Given the Ancestor Immortal upper level cultivation state of that burly man, things might not be that easy.</p><br/><p>On the surface, his aura looked calm and unassuming. However, there were black lines intertwined on his body, with an extremely formidable aura cruising through as though he had cultivated some unparalleled mystic skill.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaking friends is fine as long as you guys aren\u2019t afraid to die. So, may I ask for your name, beauty?\u201d Lin Fan chuckled out.</p><br/><p>The burly man was enraged immediately, \u201cInsolent! Mind your tone!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAiyoh! Pretty high class, aren\u2019t we? Even though an Ancestor Immortal upper level cultivation state is pretty decent, it\u2019s not exactly impossible if I want to kill you as well. Therefore, YOU had better mind YOUR tone!\u201d Lin Fan glanced over at the burly man, unaffected by him in the least bit.</p><br/><p>Even though if they were to talk about strength, he truly might not be able to kill the other party, this big rockhead seemed a little dumb.</p><br/><p>\u201cShut up!\u201d The woman scolded out. The burly man glared at Lin Fan with an angry expression before moving to the back without saying anything anymore.</p><br/><p>\u201cMo Qingxuan.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDecent name. Remember mine: Lin Fan.\u201d Lin Fan replied.</p><br/><p>When that name was said out, the face of the initially angry burly man changed, \u201cYou are that person who had taken down the Kunlun God Mountain!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGrandmaster Candidate of the Heaven and Earth Sect, Lin Fan!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh!\u201d Lin Fan was stunned. The issue of Your Daddy taking down the Kunlun God Mountain should not have been known by too many people, right? Could Tian Fengling be the one who had publicized the news himself?</p><br/><p>But, how magnanimous of a heart must he have to spread it to the world after being f*cked over by someone? This guy was amazing! Lin Fan could not help but feel impressed toward him.</p><br/><p>Mo Qingxuan chuckled out with a jingle, \u201cTo think that a Grandmaster Candidate of the Heaven and Earth Sect would have such guts to f*ck over the Kunlun God Mountain of the Vice Grandmaster from the Kunlun God Sect, Tian Fengling. Not only that, you still dare to use your real name out in the open! This maiden is impressed with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan wasn\u2019t bothered at all, \u201cIf one has got the skills, what need is there to hide oneself? If I wanted to hide from the very beginning, I wouldn\u2019t have done what I did.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mo Qingxuan was slightly taken aback before laughing out.</p><br/><p>\u201cSpeak then, just what do you guys want? There\u2019re only two types of people I know in the world outside\u2026The first are strangers, and the second are foes.\u201d Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>\u201cInteresting! For us stepping forth this time around, the first reason is that we wanted to see for ourselves just what sort of a character would have the guts to kill a Grandmaster Candidate of the Kunlun God Sect. The second reason is that I would like to cooperate with you.\u201d Mo Qingxuan replied.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan LOVED cooperating with others. However, in collaborations as such, there would usually be nothing good that coming out. Eventually, both sides would definitely come at the other\u2019s throats.</p><br/><p>\u201cCooperation? I love it! Just what is this all about? If there\u2019s any good to be gained out of it, I don\u2019t think I would really mind.\u201d Lin Fan asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid that this is an inconvenient place to carry on with this conversation. How about we follow up with this chat in a shop?\u201d Mo Qingxuan suggested.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Within a shop\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re referring to a treasure ground where you want me to go with you guys as a companion?\u201d Lin Fan was startled. To think that something this good would exist!</p><br/><p>\u201cNaturally, this is a treasure ground which only Qin Shengjun of the God Essence Sect knows about. Well, other than him, I do know a little about it as well. But compared to Qin Shengjun, there really is a world of a difference.\u201d Mo Qingxuan said.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuehue.\u201d Lin Fan chuckled out as he started scheming in his heart. There must be some catch to this for sure. If there was really some great treasure awaiting, would they want to share it with him just like this?</p><br/><p>\u201cSure, no problem. We can cooperate on this.\u201d Lin Fan agreed immediately without having to think twice.</p><br/><p>No matter what sort of tricks these guys were plotting, it was of no use against him. As long as he were to arrive at the destination, he would act solo.</p><br/><p>Mo Qingxuan was stunned before chuckling out, \u201cAlright! Since that\u2019s the case, we\u2019ve got a deal then.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was ultimately decided that they would move out the next day.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cMadam, Qin Shengjun has headed over to the Kunlun God Sect to borrow their God Fire and refine his mystic skill, and has permitted three slots for the Kunlun God Sect\u2019s side. Things might get a little tricky then. This is especially the case with this fella we just met. A single look and one can tell that he\u2019s no kind soul. Why do we have to keep such an unpredictable element around us? Even if you respect his strength, Madam, is there a need to keep someone as dangerous as him by our side?\u201d</p><br/><p>Mo Qingxuan smiled. However, that smile bore with it a frosty undertone, \u201cRespect? Initially, I had only wanted to see for myself just what sort of capabilities this person had. But, now that I\u2019ve confirmed that he is a disciple of the Heaven and Earth Sect, I\u2019ve got yet another plan bubbling in my mind. If this can work out, things might just have a really different outcome.\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking at how contemplative Mo Qingxuan was, the burly man then broke out into a smile as though he had finally understood the connection between everything she had done.</p><br/><p>On another side of the city\u2026</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was sitting cross-legged. Right now, his cultivation state was at the Golden Immortal full cultivation state, just that step away from reaching the Ancestor Immortal state. If he could raise his level up, he would be able to kill any gods or buddhas that would come in his path.</p><br/><p>As for those big sects, anyone below the position of a Vice Grandmaster would be killed by Lin Fan in a single punch.</p><br/><p>And this time around, Lin Fan had seized the opportunity.</p><br/><p>Be it the Kunlun God Sect or the Suppressing Demons Heaven Faction, he would have to slaughter all of them without letting anyone off. The astronomical experience points were what Lin Fan truly required.</p><br/><p>Wanting to take him to the treasure ground? Didn\u2019t they just want to scam him to death?</p><br/><p>\u2018If they want to do so, come on then! Who\u2019s afraid of whom?\u2019</p><br/>\n</div>"}

One of them chuckled out in amusement, \u201cHow many moves do you guys think that he can hold out against our junior sister?\u201d</p><br/><p>Another Remnant shook his head, \u201cThat\u2019s hard to say now. If junior sister were to get serious, she would be able to take him down within ten moves.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut, if junior sister feels like toying with him, it might take a little longer. Although, that WOULD cause this Ling Wuzun\u2019s face to be lost really big time then!\u201d A Remnant remarked.</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha! That\u2019s what I think as well! Even though our junior sister is a female, she isn\u2019t someone to be underestimated at all.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>At the seat of the Grandmaster\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cGrandmaster Han, what do you make of this female disciple?\u201d The Grandmaster of the Kunlun God Sect asked while smirking.</p><br/><p>Han Juntian took a casual glance. \u201cPassable.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFufufu!\u201d The Grandmaster of the Kunlun God Sect chuckled out softly before muttering out, \u201cHowever, you must not underestimate her. I think that disciple of yours is going to be in for a rough time now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Han Juntian did not reply as he focused on the situation on the sparring arena.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease enlighten me then,\u201d Ling Wuzun said before his body moved instantly. With a stern expression on his face, he deployed a mystic skill immediately. As he covered the entire sky with his palm, his powers rumbled out to try and suppress Yan Qingxue.</p><br/><p>On the other side, Yan Qingxue\u2019s body budged, \u201cNot bad, not bad. To use the Heaven and Earth Five Elements Palm and seal up the Heaven and Earth in order to lock down my movements\u2026 However, it\u2019s a pity that your mastery of it is far from perfect.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Qingxue focused slightly as a long whip appeared in her hands, snow white all over. When it made contact with the ground, the entire sparring arena froze up because of it!</p><br/><p>Waving out her hand, her brandished whip struck the air, causing the void to freeze up equally as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow about now? Are you starting to feel that your motion is getting sluggish?\u201d Yan Qingxue asked.</p><br/><p>Ling Wuzun was feeling a little pissed in his heart. Bloody hell! It was just a duel. Did she have to spout out so much crap? His body then shuddered furiously before giving off a brilliant glare that was as bright as a scorching sun. This beam of light surged up into the sky, penetrating through the void.</p><br/><p>The frozen voids melted instantly.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot bad, not bad! I guess the Remnants of the Heaven and Earth Sect do have SOME capabilities after all. But, this is still not enough just yet,\u201d Yan Qingxue said with a low tone as she tossed out the long whip in her hands. Like a gigantic dragon, it spiraled out and pierced toward Ling Wuzun\u2019s chest.</p><br/><p>\u201cDaluo Emperor Heaven Palm! Suppress!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Wuzun had made quite a decent improvement in the past few years as well, having cultivated a number of pretty formidable mystic skills.</p><br/><p>This was especially the case for this Daluo Emperor Heaven Palm, which had an extraordinary impact.</p><br/><p>Daluo represented the eternity of space, transcending through everything. The might of this palm strike was exceptional, shrouding the entire sparring arena within it and leaving Yan Qingxue with nowhere to run.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood!\u201d When Jian Cangqiong caught sight of this scene, he could not help but exclaim out.</p><br/><p>The disciples started discussing as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior Brother Ling\u2019s strength is so strong! That mystic skill is a famous unparalleled mystic skill of our sect!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat woman is done for sure! In the hands of Senior Brother Ling, how many moves can she hold out for?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThese Remnants of the Kunlun God Sect are truly way too arrogant! Do they really think that our Heaven and Earth Sect\u2019s senior brothers are useless?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFight on, senior brother!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>When the Remnants of the Kunlun God Sect saw this, they started discussing amongst themselves as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot bad! Ling Wuzun has managed to master this mystic skill to a certain extent.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. Most people would definitely not be able to defend against it. But against junior sister, it is still too far off.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGuys, take a look. Junior sister seems like she\u2019s tired of playing with the other party now!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s over. The Kunlun God Sect is going to sweep across the entire Heaven and Earth Sect. This competition will be enough for the Kunlun God Sect to suppress the Heaven and Earth Sect for a full hundred years now!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cBoring, boring! Here I was thinking about how strong you might possibly be. But to think that this would be all you amount to.\u201d Yan Qingxue\u2019s lips curled into a smirk as she looked at Ling Wuzun, \u201cGiven your strength, if you were placed in the Kunlun God Sect, I\u2019m afraid that you would merely be able to join the ranks of the Inner Sect disciples.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026!\u201d Ling Wuzun was about to spit out blood right now. This b*tch before him was too damned vicious! To think that she would dare spout out such harsh words to humiliate him!</p><br/><p>Compared to that Lin Fan, she was even more venomous!</p><br/><p>\u201cOne must never be too careless in a duel.\u201d Right at this moment, Yan Qingxue appeared before Ling Wuzun all of a sudden.</p><br/><p>Ling Wuzun\u2019s face was shocked as he revealed a panicked expression. He wanted to push the other party back. But by this time, it was all too late. The only thing he could see was Yan Qingxue\u2019s feet that stomped down on his face.</p><br/><p>BOOM!</p><br/><p>The entire sparring arena reverberated out as those hard tiles of the ground began exploding, causing the entire sparring arena to be covered in a sandstorm.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior Brother Ling couldn\u2019t have lost, could he?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s impossible! Absolutely impossible!\u201d</p><br/><p>After the dust cleared, everyone was absolutely dumbfounded when they caught sight of the situation on the sparring arena, their eyes filled with astonishment.</p><br/><p>Senior Brother Ling had truly been defeated!</p><br/><p>There was a sharp throbbing pain in the hearts of the Heaven and Earth Sect\u2019s Remnants. It was yet another bloody defeat.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour strength is just simply way too weak.\u201d Yan Qingxue trampled Ling Wuzun down on her feet directly. For any Remnant, this was an absolutely intolerable act. This was especially the fact considering the shame of being stomped upon by a woman. How was he to face the world from now on?</p><br/><p>\u201cDAMN IT!\u201d Ling Wuzun roared out in rage.</p><br/><p>Yan Qingxue\u2019s face shone with a look of contempt, \u201cStop barking now. Your strength is simply too weak when compared to mine. Even if I were to give you a hundred years of cultivation, you would never be my match.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTAKE OFF YOUR FOOT!\u201d Ling Wuzun had not expected that he would be defeated at such lightning speed that he wouldn\u2019t be able to react to it at all.</p><br/><p>That single foot seemed to have crossed through time and space, arriving at his face in the blink of an eye.</p><br/><p>T-this\u2026!</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you admit defeat?\u201d Looking down at Ling Wuzun who was trampled under her feet, Yan Qingxue\u2019s face revealed a haughty expression. However, Ling Wuzun did not reply as he continued to struggle against it.</p><br/><p>Even though Yan Qingxue was a female, the strength she possessed was heavy like a crushing mountain that suppressed down on Ling Wuzun\u2019s face mercilessly.</p><br/><p>When the Remnants of the Kunlun God Sect caught sight of this, they burst out into laughter.</p><br/><p>\u201cJunior sister is about to break someone\u2019s mind again!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHAHA! I\u2019m afraid that from now on forth, the Heaven and Earth Sect is going to have a crippled Remnant. Anyone who was humiliated by junior sister before could barely ever regain their confidence at all!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, I\u2019ve got to say that the Grandmaster of the Heaven and Earth Sect can truly hold his temper.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if he can\u2019t hold his temper, so what? This is a competition between the Remnants. Everything is fair and square. If one loses, they can only blame it on their lack of skills!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>On the Grandmaster\u2019s seat\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s too much of them!\u201d The Grandmaster of the Kunlun God Sect apologized. However, his eyes shone with a look of gloating glee.</p><br/><p>Han Juntian sat there with the fury in his heart about to explode out. However, he soon calmed himself down.</p><br/><p>The Grandmaster of the Kunlun God Sect looked over at Yan Qingxue, \u201cBe moderate in your actions. Take care not to spoil the relationship between our sects.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGot it, Grandmaster.\u201d Yan Qingxue nodded her head. She then kicked Ling Wuzun away with her feet as she scoffed out coldly, \u201cHmph! Useless piece of trash! To think that you can even become a Remnant with that bit of strength. What a bloody joke!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Qingxue then looked over at the Remnants of the Heaven and Earth Sect, \u201cYour Lady here hasn\u2019t had enough of a fight! Is there not a single Remnant in the Heaven and Earth Sect who can fight?\u201d</p><br/><p>She used the long whip in her hands to point out at two other Remnants, \u201cI don\u2019t recall both of you having entered the sparring arena yet. Alright then! How about you guys come and spar with me so that I can check out your strength?\u201d</p><br/><p>The many disciples of the Heaven and Earth Sect were angered at this moment.</p><br/><p>At the start, they were still thinking somewhere along the lines of how pretty this sweet lady was. Some of them even had a slight crush on her. But at this point, they could no longer hold their anger in.</p><br/><p>Cocky! She was way too cocky!</p><br/><p>She was just belittling all the Remnants of the Heaven and Earth Sect, showing them no respect at all!</p><br/><p>The Remnants of the Heaven and Earth Sect who had yet to enter the sparring arena were incensed as well. However, the strength of this Yan Qingxue was far from ordinary. Even if they were to head up, they might not be able to win against her.</p><br/><p>At that point, the entire place fell into an awkward silence.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph! Even if your strength can\u2019t make it, don\u2019t you guys even have the bit of courage to come onto the sparring arena? What a huge disgrace!\u201d Yan Qingxue declared haughtily.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026!\u201d At this moment, one of the Remnants bolted upright. His fists were gripped tightly as he was prepared to head onto the sparring arena.</p><br/><p>But right after he did that, a voice traveled from amongst the spectating disciples.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do it then.\u201d</p><br/><p>When the masses present heard that voice, all of their heads turned over in a flush.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

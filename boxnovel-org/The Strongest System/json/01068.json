Bringing four Vice Grandmasters with them, the Kunlun God Sect was clearly trying to have a showdown with the Heaven and Earth Sect.</p><br/><p>Tai Qiantian\u2019s face was entirely dark with a sense of rage that he could not speak out. \u201cHan Juntian\u2026 Today, you\u2019re going to have to give my Kunlun God Sect an explanation for this issue no matter what.\u201d</p><br/><p>Now that four of the Grandmaster Candidates of Kunlun God Sect had been slain by that lad, Tai Qiantian\u2019s reverse scale had been triggered thoroughly.</p><br/><p>All the Vice Grandmasters of the Heaven and Earth Sect sat there quietly, their hearts filled with raging waves as well. That lad was way too vicious, wasn\u2019t he? To think that he would end up killing four Grandmaster Candidates of the Kunlun God Sect in a row! That was just crazy!</p><br/><p>But, for some unknown reason, they had a thrilling feeling in their heart over it as well. It was as though they were heaving out breaths of relief from, even though the current situation WAS a little complex now.</p><br/><p>To think that the Grandmaster of the Kunlun God Sect would come knocking personally. And by the look of their force, this didn\u2019t seem like an issue that could be settled that easily.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Tai, we don\u2019t know anything about this issue. Furthermore, it\u2019s been a long time since we\u2019ve seen him as well.\u201d Han Juntian said with a face of helplessness.</p><br/><p>He had not thought that that lad would have turned this incredible, and would really have the guts to do all this! However, that lad had quite the luck as well. If he we were in any other ordinary sect, he\u2019d be dead for sure. With Tai Qiantian descending personally, most ordinary sects would be scared out of their pants, and would definitely push him out to face the music.</p><br/><p>However, this was the Heaven and Earth Sect, a sect that would never ever fear any other sect.</p><br/><p>In fact, Han Juntian was even about to roar out while declaring, \u2018Good Kill!\u201d</p><br/><p>That was something that Han Juntian could not help but admit. The Kunlun God Sect had indeed been stepping over their heads, especially in the past 100 years where the overall strength of the Kunlun God Sect stood at a slight advantage.</p><br/><p>But naturally, the difference was only evident in the middle tiers. At the upper tier, all of their powers were evenly matched, with not much of a difference.</p><br/><p>\u201cHan Juntian, I hope that you will take this issue seriously. The Senior Old Master of my sect has been taking notice of it as well. If you are not going to give our Kunlun God Sect a proper explanation for this issue and account for it, you will bear the consequences yourself.\u201d Tai Qiantian roared out with a stern face as though he was speaking of an extremely grave issue, without any hint of amusement in his tone at all. His intentions were clear: if they did not give a proper explanation for it, they could blame no one but themselves if they were to meet with any regrettable outcomes.</p><br/><p>Han Juntian\u2019s face froze up, \u201cTai Qiantian, what do you mean by that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tai Qiantian swept his robes in fury, \u201cWhat do I mean? I\u2019m sure you know it well in your heart. Four of my Grandmaster Candidates have been slain by a disciple of your sect. This is something that has a great impact on my Kunlun God Sect. Well, you can naturally take this with ease and not have a single bit of concern, Han Juntian. But, even if you can protect them for a moment, you can\u2019t protect them for a lifetime. If someday, somewhere in the Endless Mainland, you were to find some corpses of the Grandmaster Candidates of the Heaven and Earth Sect floating around, don\u2019t blame me for not reminding you.\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment Han Juntian heard these words, he blew up, \u201cAre you trying to declare a war?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tai Qiantian refused to admit defeat either, \u201cIf a war is to be declared, then so be it! Do you think that my Kunlun God Sect would be afraid of your Heaven and Earth Sect? No matter what, if the Heaven and Earth Sect does not account for this issue properly, the Kunlun God Sect will definitely not let it off just like that either! If you were to hand that lad over to me, I could take it as though nothing has happened!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cImpossible! You\u2019ve got to be dreaming.\u201d Without even considering, Han Juntian rejected him flatly, \u201cTai Qiantian, don\u2019t you get overboard now. To think that you would have the cheek to try and step in over the little disputes between the younger generation! If any disciples of your Kunlun God Sect were to kill my disciple, I, Han Juntian, would definitely not have a single grudge. After all, if his skill isn\u2019t comparable to others, it would be his due desserts to die. But, if a Grandmaster such as yourself were to strike out personally, would there still be any dignity left?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tai Qiantian bolted upright, \u201cHan Juntian, I am not here to debate with you over this issue. I\u2019m just here to ask you to watch over the disciples in your sect properly. Otherwise, don\u2019t come blaming anyone if they were killed outside.\u201d</p><br/><p>Han Juntian bolted up as well as his eyes shone with a glint of rage, \u201cTai Qiantian, you\u2019d dare\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuehue\u2026 What would I not dare? A disciple of your sect has already killed four Grandmaster Candidates of mine. That is already a huge crime. If you dare to cover that one person, you should be prepared mentally for reckoning.\u201d Tai Qiantian\u2019s way of doing things were always headstrong. This time around, he wasn\u2019t here to waste time on crap. He truly had his killing intent triggered.</p><br/><p>\u201cTai Qiantian, do you really wish to start a war?\u201d Han Juntian asked harshly.</p><br/><p>Tai Qiantian\u2019s eyes shone with a sharp gleam, \u201cRemember this, the Kunlun God Sect is not one to be humiliated. Since you do not wish to hand that disciple over, you can only await the Kunlun God Sect\u2019s wrath.\u201d</p><br/><p>One of the Vice Grandmaster of the Heaven and Earth Sect nearby knitted his brows as he sent his voice telepathically, \u201cGrandmaster, there\u2019s no need to fall out with the Kunlun God Sect over just a single disciple. How about handing him out?\u201d</p><br/><p>Han Juntian glared over and the Vice Grandmaster lowered his head immediately. He knew that the Grandmaster would definitely not hand the disciple over. But, if they were to continue clashing like this, it would bring no benefits either.</p><br/><p>To send the other disciples into the fire pits just over a single disciple wasn\u2019t a wise choice.</p><br/><p>This was truly a rare situation to come across. In the Endless Mainland, there had never been a precedence to this. This disciple of their sect seemed as though he was just pitting himself entirely against the Kunlun God Sect by only killing their Grandmaster Candidates. Not only that, he even killed four of them! How could the Kunlun God Sect possibly endure something like this?</p><br/><p>Han Juntian swept his sleeves, \u201cFine! Since that\u2019s the case, come on then. It has been a thousand years since the Heaven and Earth Sect has made any moves. I\u2019m sure that there must be many people who are disgruntled over our name being up there as one of the nine sects. Send down the orders! From now on, if any Heaven and Earth Sect disciples are to meet any Kunlun God Sect disciples\u2026KILL!\u201d</p><br/><p>The initially harmonious face of Han Juntian suddenly turned serious and tyrannical, his voice filled with an endless amount of killing intent.</p><br/><p>\u201cTai Qiantian, I, Han Juntian, had never been afraid of anyone a thousand years ago, and would never have taken anyone\u2019s threats! It seems like being in the seat of Grandmaster for a thousand years has mellowed my temper. But, you\u2019ve got to remember this. I, HAN JUNTIAN, AM NOT SOMEONE WHO IS AFRAID OF TROUBLE!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026!\u201d Tai Qiantian was taken aback, evidently not expecting the other to speak such words!</p><br/><p>Tai Qiantian and Han Juntian were both people of the same generation. Back then, both of them were geniuses of that generation, and were just like the Grandmaster Candidates of the sects right now.</p><br/><p>At that time, Han Juntian was someone with an unrivaled might and a torrential battle prowess. By reigning over the entire world, he took on the seat of the Grandmaster in glory.</p><br/><p>Ever since he became the Grandmaster, Han Juntian felt that he had a much heavier responsibility on himself, and could no longer act as wantonly and brazenly as before. With that, he settled everything peacefully.</p><br/><p>This was the reason why he could still reply in a polite and courteous tone when Tai Qiantian came knocking. But right now, he was thoroughly enraged.</p><br/><p>Glaring at Tai Qiantian, Han Juntian\u2019s aura was extremely strident, \u201cTai Qiantian, remember this! A thousand years ago, I, Han Juntian, was firmly above you! After a thousand years, there\u2019s no way I\u2019m going to allow you to act so audaciously here! I\u2019m not going to hold you back today. But, you must remember to take good care of your Kunlun God Sect disciples. Otherwise, they\u2019re not going to even know how they died!\u201d</p><br/><p>PIAK!</p><br/><p>Tai Qiantian was incensed as he smashed the table with his palm, \u201cHAN JUNTIAN! YOU TRULY WISH TO DECLARE WAR?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHAHAHAHAHAHAHA\u2026!\u201d Han Juntian roared out in laughter, then swept his sleeves, \u201cSend the guests\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>He did not reply to Tai Qiantian\u2019s question. Now that things had gotten to this extent, he might as well let them come then!</p><br/><p>It was not as though he would be afraid, would he?</p></div>\n</div>"}

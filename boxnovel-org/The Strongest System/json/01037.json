Their expression looks as though they\u2019re just looking at us as beasts.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNow, that sentence of yours isn\u2019t quite right now, eh? How can they take us as beasts?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, I was just saying. But in any case, that\u2019s my intuition so far.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHais! At times, it really sucks to not have strength on your own. You will forever be under the control of others. Take a look at Brother Lin. His daughter had entered a sect while his son has not returned with any form of news for the past three years. Now that his daughter brought back her senior sisters, they are so darned arrogant. Seems like Brother Lin is really going to be in for a rough time now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShould we head over to check things out?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, if we head over, we\u2019ll be deemed as causing trouble. Just wait and wait out the situation further.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d</p><br/><p>The situation that the Family Heads of the seven great families spoke of had truly happened.</p><br/><p>Right now, Lin Haoming was having a huge headache. Those few fellas acted as though they were their ancestors. The moment they reached the Lin Family, they treated the Lin Family like their servants. If not for the fact that they were way too strong, Lin Haoming was even prepared to fall out with them.</p><br/><p>On the dining table\u2026</p><br/><p>Lin Haoming did not take the main seat of the host. Instead, Ning Tiekun sat there.</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone, please enjoy your meal.\u201d Lin Haoming invited them with a cheery face full of smiles and politeness. Lin Feixue, Lin Lan\u2019er, and Mrs. Lin sat down without making a single peep. They could sense that there was something off with the situation.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t bother. I can\u2019t bring myself to consume the food of commoners.\u201d Ning Tiekun said, then took out a pill and swallowed it into his tummy.</p><br/><p>Out of the three senior sisters who had followed Lin Hanyu back, one of them had a pretty good relationship with her. She then took up her chopsticks and started eating, \u201cNot bad! The taste is pretty good!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Hanyu looked over at her Senior Sister Xiao Yuya and gave her a look of immense gratitude.</p><br/><p>As for the other two senior sisters, they were just like Ning Tiekun. They refused to budge at all, as though this food was way too lowly for them.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s not bad, then do please eat more! Thank you all so much for looking after my daughter in the sect!\u201d Lin Haoming said.</p><br/><p>\u201cYu\u2019er, I heard from your father that you had become an Outer Sect disciple? How is it like being an Outer Sect disciple? Is it much better than before?\u201d Mrs. Lin asked.</p><br/><p>Lin Hanyu truly did not know how to reply. Within the sect, Outer Sect disciples did not have much of a status, unlike Inner Sect disciples; they were just like ants. However, to give her family a peace of mind, Lin Hanyu naturally nodded her head, \u201cYepps, it\u2019s good! Ever since I\u2019ve become an Outer Sect disciple, things have been much better!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, it\u2019s all good as long as things are fine.\u201d Mrs. Lin heaved out a sigh of relief.</p><br/><p>Lin Feixue and Lin Lan\u2019er dug into the food with their heads lowered.</p><br/><p>But suddenly, Lin Lan\u2019er raised her head, \u201cHow nice would it be if Big Brother were here\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFather, has there really not been a single peep from Little Brother in the past three years?\u201d Lin Hanyu asked.</p><br/><p>It was only after entering a sect that she knew how things were like there. The competition between the disciples were extremely intense, and it was filled with dangers. If there had been no news for the past three years\u2026that was a situation she did not dare to imagine.</p><br/><p>Lin Haoming nodded his head, \u201cYes. It\u2019s been three years without news now. I wonder what that lad is doing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, that just sounds like a grim omen to me.\u201d Ning Tiekun spoke up. He did not care about how everyone else at the table felt.</p><br/><p>And indeed, the moment Ning Tiekun spoke up, the faces of Lin Haoming and the others changed slightly.</p><br/><p>Lin Lan\u2019er had even rebutted, \u201cYou\u2019re talking crap! My Big Brother will definitely be fine!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d Ning Tiekun\u2019s face changed, evidently slightly enraged.</p><br/><p>Lin Hanyu knew of Ning Tiekun\u2019s background, and was pale as a sheet momentarily. She wasn\u2019t close to this Ning Tiekun at all. He was an acquaintance of one of her senior sisters. This time around, she had been returning with three of these senior sisters when they bumped into this Ning Tiekun along the way. She did know that much about him either.</p><br/><p>However, looking at how her senior sisters were all polite and respectful toward him, she naturally knew that she could not afford to offend him.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou said that I\u2019m talking crap?\u201d Ning Tiekun\u2019s face tensed up as his wrath bubbled. When Lin Lan\u2019er caught sight of this, she was scared silly and sat there blankly.</p><br/><p>\u201cSir Ning, please be appeased. My Little Sister is still young and isn\u2019t sensible enough yet.\u201d Lin Hanyu said.</p><br/><p>Senior Sister Xiao Yuya helped to chime in from the side as well, \u201cSir Ning, I\u2019m sure you wouldn\u2019t get angry over something as small as this, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Haoming added in to apologize profusely as well.</p><br/><p>This time around, the people brought back by Lin Hanyu weren\u2019t people he liked at all. However, what could he do about it? The other party was evidently far from simple. If they had offended him, what could the Lin Family have to defend against them?</p><br/><p>Furthermore, his daughter was still in that sect. If they were to offend the other side and they were to make things difficult for her in the future, what were they to do?</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph!\u201d Ning Tiekun snorted out coldly. He was just like a high and mighty sovereign right now, \u201cIf there\u2019s a next time, I\u2019ll definitely kill her without mercy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBoohoo\u2026!\u201d Lin Lan\u2019er was scared into tears right now as she ran out immediately. Even though Lin Hanyu felt a little enraged in her heart, she did not dare to vent it out.</p><br/><p>Lin Feixue and Mrs. Lin chased after Lin Lan\u2019er.</p><br/><p>As for Lin Haoming, even though he was displeased in his heart, he still laughed out awkwardly in apology.</p><br/><p>Looking at the situation before her, Xiao Yuya could only look at Lin Hanyu and shake her head exasperatedly, indicating that she could do nothing about it.</p><br/><p>The position of this Ning Tiekun was extraordinary. He wasn\u2019t someone they could go against. All they could do was to endure.</p><br/><p>As a result, this meal was an extremely awkward one. Lin Haoming and the others did not even dare to take in a deep breath of air.</p><br/><p>Even though Lin Hanyu was an Outer Sect disciple, in the eyes of Ning Tiekun, she was nothing more than an ant, no different from cannon fodder.</p><br/><p>The next day\u2026</p><br/><p>The news of Lin Hanyu returning to the Rising Dragon City had spread out. However, everyone also knew that she had brought some other people with her. Those people had a position that was even higher than hers in the sect.</p><br/><p>Some people wanted to seize the chance to build some connections. But, when they heard that the other party did not even give the Lin Family any face, they naturally held back. When it came to people as such who were difficult to get acquainted with, they had better just forget about it.</p><br/><p>On the streets\u2026</p><br/><p>Ning Tiekun and the others walked ahead while Lin Haoming followed behind and introduced everything about the Rising Dragon City to them. Ning Tiekun\u2019s head was raised up high as though no one here was worthy of him looking at them.</p><br/><p>The surrounding passersby made way immediately, not daring to head up and check it out.</p><br/><p>Lin Hanyu stood by the side, feeling immensely awkward beyond anything else. At the same time, she was boiling in her heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cSir Ning, this is the most glamorous place in the entire Rising Dragon City now.\u201d Lin Haoming said.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d Ning Tiekun nodded his head.</p><br/><p>All of a sudden, Ning Tiekun\u2019s eyes sparkled as he pushed Lin Haoming aside and rushed ahead.</p><br/><p>Caught totally by surprise, Lin Haoming was nearly pushed onto the ground. Thankfully, there was someone to support him up.</p><br/><p>This excitement of Ning Tiekun naturally meant that he had bumped into his acquaintances.</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior Brother Zhou, Senior Brother Wang! Long time no see!\u201d Ning Tiekun came before a stall and cupped his fists while greeting.</p><br/><p>When these two people who were purchasing some items from the secular world here heard this voice, they raised their heads and stopped looking through the items for a little while, \u201cOh, it\u2019s Brother Ning!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Haoming and the others caught up with them as well by this point.</p><br/><p>Turning around to look at Lin Haoming and the others in disdain, Ning Tiekun said, \u201cLet me introduce you guys. These two are Inner Sect disciples of the Heaven and Earth Sect, Brother Zhou and Brother Wang.\u201d</p><br/><p>When the senior sisters of Lin Hanyu heard the identity of the other side, they were a little excited, \u201cGreetings to the two senior brothers!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Heaven and Earth Sect was a big sect within the Endless Mainland, and the disciples within were all extraordinary! It wasn\u2019t something that sects like theirs could compare with!</p><br/><p>When Lin Haoming heard that the other side were disciples of the Heaven and Earth Sect, he got emotional momentarily and rushed forth to tug at the two of them, \u201cMay I ask\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>However, before Lin Haoming had even managed to speak up, the face of Ning Tiekun turned dark as he kicked him away.</p><br/><p>\u201cBRAZEN! These two senior brothers here are not people you can tug at! Lin Hanyu, you had better watch your father\u2019s actions! Otherwise, he is going to cause big problems!\u201d Ning Tiekun barked out coldly.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026!\u201d Lin Hanyu could no longer bear with it. She then sighed out and helped her father up, \u201cFather, we\u2019ll ask later when there\u2019s a chance.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Haoming nodded his head.</p><br/><p>Ning Tiekun snorted out coldly once more before turning to the two senior brothers with a face full of smiles, \u201cSenior brothers here, how about letting me prepare a welcome feast for you guys?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOur thanks to Brother Ning then.\u201d The two of them did not mind at all. After all, since someone was prepared to host a welcome feast for them, why should they refuse?</p><br/><p>At this moment, Ning Tiekun turned around and said to Lin Hanyu softly, \u201cWhat are you still waiting for? Hurry and get your father and those family members of yours to start preparing!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Hanyu had wanted to say something when Xiao Yuya held her back and nodded her head to not have her say anything more.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p></div>\n</div>"}

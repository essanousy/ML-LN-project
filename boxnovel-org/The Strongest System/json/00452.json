Complete and Utter Breakdown!</p><br/><p>Translator: Lam_ Editor: Hitesh_</p><br/><p>\"Human race?\" The moment the Ancient race being caught sight of Lin Fan, he wasn't too certain at first. However, after further scrutiny, he burst out into laughter, \"HAHA! To think that you truly are from the human race\u2026!\"</p><br/><p>Upon realizing that Lin Fan was a human, that initially furious wrath of the Ancient race being disappeared entirely. In its place was a sense of excitement.</p><br/><p>\"What's wrong with the human race? Have you gone silly?\" Upon looking at the expressions of the Ancient race being, Lin Fan was astonished.</p><br/><p>\"Don't tell me that the human race is your daddy? Is that why you're so happy? Because Daddy's here? But don't worry too much, kiddo. Your Daddy here already has a cheap son. Someone like you isn't qualified to my Your Daddy's new son.\" Lin Fan chuckled.</p><br/><p>\"HAHA! To think that the humankind still doesn't know that their race is on the brink of extinction. Seems like the gods of the Ancient Saint Heavens are blessing me, for me, Gu Hai, to be able to find a human! If I bring you back, I'll certainly get a huge amount of credit for it!\" That malevolent face of Gu Hai was guffawing wildly.</p><br/><p>His gaze at Lin Fan was the exact same as a predator watching its prey.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan did not know what this guy was up to.</p><br/><p>But by the looks of it, he DID seem pretty excited.</p><br/><p>Could it be that the human race was pretty important to the Ancient race?</p><br/><p>At this moment, Lin Fan sized up Gu Hai carefully. He was pitch-black all over, with an extremely hideous face. Compared to the human race, he was around fifty percent taller, causing him to seem like a mini-giant. Those veiny muscles looked like they were about to burst out with power.</p><br/><p>Other than that, he looked exactly the same as any other human.</p><br/><p>But, if the Ancient One belonged to this Ancient race, then the Ancient One must have been the highest level of existence within this race. As for this Gu Hai, he was practically the lowest level of existence in comparison.</p><br/><p>Earth celestial middle level.</p><br/><p>This cultivation state wasn't that high. Lin Fan had the confidence in taking him down.</p><br/><p>\"Human, you better follow me obediently. Or, would you rather be dragged away by me after I turn you into an ic-cold corpse?' Looking at this human before him, Gu Hai placed a foot forward. That single footing contained a massive amount of energy, bursting out massively and covering the entire surroundings within it.</p><br/><p>Now that he had discovered this human, he did not want to let him slip from his grasp. Hence, he had to ensure that he was well prepared for anything.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan's current physical body state was at Imperishable full cultivation state. He was around 2,900 experience points away from leveling up.</p><br/><p>If he had to make a comparison of cultivation state, his physical body should only be able to withstand blows of any being up to the utmost celestial full cultivation state.</p><br/><p>However, Gu Hai was an earth celestial middle-level being. But, based on the situation, Lin Fan knew that this Ancient race being would most probably not deal any lethal damage to him.</p><br/><p>Even if he decided to go lethal, Lin Fan wasn't that afraid either. After all, it wasn't anything easy for someone to want to kill anybody like Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>\"Hmph, you wanna take me away? Well, we'll just have to see if you've got what it takes to do so then!\" Lin Fan snorted coldly without a single bit of respect towards Gu Hai.</p><br/><p>And as expected, Lin Fan's reaction had caused Gu Hai to fly into a maddened rage.</p><br/><p>\"Since that's the case, then you're courting your own death!\" Instantly, that malicious face of Gu Hai revealed a cold smile. Disappearing from where he was, he teleported right in front of Lin Fan instantly and sent out a tremendous punch.</p><br/><p>BAM!</p><br/><p>Lin Fan used his hand to block this. Despite that, the massive surge of energy that was emanated from the punch caused Lin Fan to be sent flying into the distance.</p><br/><p>'Ding\u2026Eternal Immortality experience points +200.'</p><br/><p>\"Hmph, know your place\u2026!\" Looking at this human who was sent flying by a single punch of his, Gu Hai's face was filled with contempt.</p><br/><p>Lying on the ground, Lin Fan could not help but think that the punch's strength was pretty decent. Of course, a punch of this level couldn't probably cause him to bleed in any way. But, based on the circumstances right now, if Lin Fan did not spit out some blood of his own, this Ancient race being might take a blow to his confidence.</p><br/><p>With that, Lin Fan held his breath and gradually spat out some fresh blood from his mouth.</p><br/><p>Following which, Lin Fan 'struggled' to stand up. With a hand clutching his chest, he gave off a look of torment as he continued, \"Y-your punch didn't hurt at all\u2026!\"</p><br/><p>\"HAHAHAHA! HUMAN! You're simply way too weak! In order not to kill you, I've only used 30% of my strength earlier on! To think that you would still dare to talk back and put on a strong front! I'll let you know of Gu Hai's true powers!\" Gu Hai laughed maniacally as he rushed forth towards Lin Fan once more. A single fist which tore through the void appeared right before Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>BAM!</p><br/><p>'Ding\u2026Eternal Immortality experience points +200.'</p><br/><p>Lin Fan flew away once more. Looking at the beautiful night skies while he was flying away, he could not help but sigh exasperatedly. Seemed like show business was a tough career for an actor at times.</p><br/><p>'Urgh\u2026!'</p><br/><p>Yet another fresh mouthful of blood was spat out as Lin Fan pretended that he almost couldn't take it anymore.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shook uncontrollably as he stood up. He stretched out a single finger, and with a shine of unyieldingness in his eyes, he went on, \"I'll never go down!\"</p><br/><p>\"Hmph\u2026! We'll see how long more you can talk back for then!\" Looking at how this human did not know his place, Gu Hai revealed a cruel laugh. \"You had better stay down obediently!'\"</p><br/><p>BAM!</p><br/><p>'Ding\u2026Eternal Immortality experience points +200.'</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>\"I'll never submit to you!\" Lin Fan was like a stubborn 14-year-old adolescent right now, yelling with absolute indignance.</p><br/><p>\"Shut up!\"</p><br/><p>BAM!</p><br/><p>'Ding\u2026Eternal Immortality experience points +200.'</p><br/><p>\"Your fist can't kill me!\"</p><br/><p>\"Shut up!\"</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>\"You bloody human! Since you're asking for death, then don't blame me!\" Gu Hai was totally riled right now. To think that this human before him could be so resilient! How was he not dead after being walloped down so many times!</p><br/><p>\"LONG LIVE THE HUMAN RACE\u2026!\"</p><br/><p>\"YOURS TRULY ISNT AFRAID OF YOU\u2026!\"</p><br/><p>\"YOU CAN'T KILL YOURS, TRULY NOPE!\"</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>\"Can you bloody use some strength!?\" Lin Fan had been enduring Gu Hai's punches all this while. However, now that his experience points for Eternal Immortality had stopped increasing, he leaped up suddenly and lashed out at Gu Hai.</p><br/><p>\"Eh\u2026?\" Gu Hai was stunned, totally bewildered by this human before him. Wasn't this fella half dead just moments earlier?! How was he revitalized in an instant?!</p><br/><p>Lin Fan's facial expression changed at that moment as well. Sh*t! Not good! He was going to be caught with his acting at this rate! No, but that was not for sure either. He looked at the Gu Hai. This person didn't seem to have a really high intellect.</p><br/><p>Changing his face once more, Lin Fan spat out three mouthfuls of blood continuously. His finger then wavered and trembled, pointing outwards as though he was on the brink of death, \"Y-you'll never kill me\u2026!\"</p><br/><p>That stunned Gu Hai immediately recovered from his stupor as he hollered out, \"Brazen! You had better lie down\u2026!\"</p><br/><p>Looking at that fearsome punch of Gu Hai, Lin Fan's heart leaped with joy. 'Bloody hell yes! It's finally here!'</p><br/><p>BAM!</p><br/><p>'Ding\u2026Eternal Immortality experience points +300.'</p><br/><p>'Ding\u2026Congratulations on Eternal Immortality leveling up.'</p><br/><p>'Ding\u2026Congratulations on physical body state leveling up.'</p><br/><p>'Physical Body State: Earth celestial lower level cultivation state.'</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>At this moment, Lin Fan's lips curled into a grin.</p><br/><p>What an arduous trial he had to go through to finally have his physical body state level up!</p><br/><p>\"You bloody human! Just what in the world is wrong with you? Why can't you die\u2026? Impossible\u2026!\" Gu Hai's punches were raining on Lin Fan's body like a torrent of water. Yet, it was as though this human could just not die, as he stood up time after time after every single punch.</p><br/><p>In fact, each time he stood up, he was sent flying by Gu Hai's own punch!</p><br/><p>But still, he stood up yet again!</p><br/><p>This continuous cycle of ups and downs had Gu Hai's mind almost breaking down.</p><br/><p>\"You can't kill me\u2026\" At this moment, Lin Fan struggled to stand up once more.</p><br/><p>\"I-impossible\u2026!\" Gu Hai was almost breaking down entirely right now. Both of his hands were scratching his head furiously as he howled, \"YOU GO AND DIE\u2026!\"</p><br/><p>BAAAAAAAAAAAAAM!</p><br/><p>It was a 360 degrees roundhouse punch. Receiving this punch, Lin Fan sighed in exasperation once more. Seemed like Gu Hai was really on the brink of breaking down mentally right now.</p><br/><p>How long had it been since he had caused someone such anguish?</p><br/><p>Looking at this human who had fallen onto the ground, Gu Hai's heart was chanting furiously. 'He must now allow this human to get back on his feet once more! Definitely not!'</p><br/><p>\"Y-you can't kill me\u2026!\" Lin Fan stood up once again. In Lin Fan's mind, however, he was ready to reap in this guy by now.</p><br/><p>\"YOU\u2026!\" Looking at this resolute human who was standing firmly once more, Gu Hai stumbled back a few steps in absolute disbelief.</p><br/><p>He was a noble warrior of the Ancient race! How could he not kill a single human?!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

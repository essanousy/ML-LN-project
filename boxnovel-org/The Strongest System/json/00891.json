He had taken a huge loss in this battle. To think that a human of a mere Supreme state would be able to cause him to retreat.</p><br/><p>This was a humiliation that was beyond the heavens. Even if the other party paid with their fresh blood, they wouldn't be able to make up for this.</p><br/><p>\"Welcome to our great Ancestral Buddha on returning.\"</p><br/><p>All of the Llama Buddhas and World Buddhas that were seated cross-legged started prostrating on the ground to welcome the grand return of the Ancestral Buddha. In the hearts of these powerful Buddhas, the Ancestral Buddha was an unparalleled, mighty existence in whom their faiths resided.</p><br/><p>As for all of those previous Buddha Lords of the Buddha race, they could sense that there was a flame of rage burning within the heart of the Ancestral Buddha.</p><br/><p>Seemed like he must have failed.</p><br/><p>It was just that with the strength of that lad, Shakya, how could he possibly escape from the grasp of the Ancestral Buddha? Seemed like there must be some big reason behind this.</p><br/><p>\"Ancestral Buddha, seems like that sinner of the Buddha race must have been subdued with this trip of yours.\" One of the Buddha Lords showed a respectful expression on his face. However, he was actually just gloating over the Ancestral Buddha's misfortune in his heart.</p><br/><p>But just at this moment, the face of the Buddha Lord changed. The Ancestral Buddha who was seated on his lotus seat closed his palms together as the powers within the body of the Buddha Lord instantly started going berserk.</p><br/><p>BAM!</p><br/><p>Without any premonition, the Buddha Lord exploded out immediately and turned into dust.</p><br/><p>When the other Buddha Lords caught sight of this scene before them, they were thoroughly infuriated. However, there was nothing they could do about it.</p><br/><p>\"Wan Sheng Buddha Lord's heart has already been invaded by demons. Therefore, I had no choice but to release him from his sufferings, so that he can reincarnate earlier and return to the seat of the Buddha once more.\" The Ancestral Buddha spoke up as though he was speaking about something extremely casual.</p><br/><p>\"Buddha is merciful.\"</p><br/><p>All the other Buddhas lowered their heads and muttered in a soft voice.</p><br/><p>Right now, the heart of the Ancestral Buddha was burning with rage. How could he not understand what that Buddha Lord was trying to imply? How could he possibly allow him to act so brazenly?</p><br/><p>At this moment, the Ancestral Buddha left the place and appeared within a completely endless void.</p><br/><p>Today's affair was one that he had to settle immediately. For that human to dare to act so audaciously, the only path awaiting him was death.</p><br/><p>At this moment, the Ancestral Buddha raised his finger and sent a long Buddha light into the void, penetrating through the boundless river of space and time.</p><br/><p>\"Ancestor of the Star race, Ancestor of the Night Devils, please have a meeting with Your Buddha here.\" The Ancestral Buddha muttered in a low voice. His words came out as Buddhist texts that floated in the void.</p><br/><p>All of a sudden, a galaxy river appeared within the endless void. This galaxy river was endless and filled with all sorts of stars. Within it was a particular ancient star that was flushed red, above which stood a figure.</p><br/><p>\"Ancestral Buddha, what do you require?\"</p><br/><p>\"Ancestor of the Star race, we'll discuss when the Ancestor of the Night Devils arrives.\" The Ancestral Buddha replied.</p><br/><p>Right after the words of the Ancestral Buddha finished, a pitch black streak of light arrived from a distance. This black streak of light was the blackest thing that one could ever find in the entire universe. There was nothing blacker than this.</p><br/><p>\"Ancestral Buddha, what's the matter?\" The voice of the Ancestor of the Night Devils was cold, and his eyes pitch black. If anyone were to exchange a single glance with him, they could just sink in and be lost in the endless darkness forever.</p><br/><p>\"The two emperors here, Your Buddha would wish to seek help from you guys to take down a single human.\" The Ancestral Buddha requested.</p><br/><p>While the Ancestral Buddha might feel that there was something up with the human, taking him down naturally would not require him to personally come forth and seek help from these two emperors. There was something else he wanted to discuss.</p><br/><p>\"Hue!\" The Ancestor of the Star race laughed out. \"Ancestral Buddha, you asked for us to come over. I don't suppose this should be the only issue, right? For three of us to take action over a single human, it's not as though he's some heaven revolting powerful being, is he?\"</p><br/><p>\"Naturally that human isn't of the greatest concern. I've heard that the Great Sage of the Monkey race and Goddess Nuwa of the Snake race et cetera had met in private, and have formed an alliance. Now that this era is on the cusp of destruction, the chance of a true eternity is still ever so elusive for us. If we don't band together, there's practically going to be no chance at all.\" The Ancestral Buddha continued.</p><br/><p>\"There's such a thing?\" The Ancestors of the Star race and the Night Devils exchanged a single glance. Even though this was what they said on the surface, they had already understood this fact in their hearts.</p><br/><p>\"Naturally. It's not as though the words of Your Ancestral Buddha could be madness, could they?\" The Ancestral Buddha replied.</p><br/><p>The 3,000 Demonic Gods of the Ancient race were all competing with one another, and their hearts were not aligned. The same could be said for these great emperors of the thousands of races. All of them had their own agendas.</p><br/><p>The true path to eternity wasn't one that was so easily obtained.</p><br/><p>In the previous era, everyone was defeated and had to go back into slumber. Now that they were awakened, they naturally had to fight their way to the top once more.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The Ancestral Buddha said many things to these two emperors. However, the prerequisite for everything was for them to help him take down that damned Human.</p><br/><p>For the Ancestral Buddha, everything that had happened today was something that he couldn't endure at all.</p><br/><p>On the other hand, the Ancestor of the Star race ruled over all the endless stars in the sky. For him to seek out a single Human in this vast world was something that he could do with ease.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>\"Where are we now?\" Reverend Shakya followed Lin Fan and came out of the void. He looked around him with bewilderment, not knowing where they had arrived.</p><br/><p>\"How could I possibly know?\" Lin Fan shook his head. The changes in this world had been simply way too huge. Along the way, Lin Fan could already feel a couple of different auras.</p><br/><p>These auras belonged to different races out there, and they were all grouped up into masses. He had sensed a few of those oppressors of the Ancient race from the past as well. However, the current Ancient race was not as dominant as before.</p><br/><p>Just that road along here earlier on, Lin Fan had already come across quite a few waves of Ancient race beings that were slain by the beings of the thousands of races.</p><br/><p>And to Lin Fan's surprise, the cultivation states of the beings of the thousands of races had actually skyrocketed to an unbelievable extent!</p><br/><p>There were as many Divine Celestial level 7 beings as dogs, and comparable number of level 8 state beings that trawled around the entire place. He could grab a whole bunch of level 9 state beings wherever he looked, and there were quite some level 10 state beings!</p><br/><p>This was simply too huge a change, to the extent that Lin Fan was starting to think that this wasn't the same world as the one he had experienced before.</p><br/><p>And indeed, it was as Lin Fan had thought. The changes were great indeed. Compared to the past, the difference could only be described with nothing but Heaven and Earth.</p><br/><p>With the fusion of the Infinite Worlds, the Laws of the universe had upgraded to an even higher level. In the past, reaching the Divine celestial level 10 state was harder than difficult could be. But right now, as long as one's affinity was there, it wouldn't be an issue at all.</p><br/><p>\"By now, the changes in this world have been extremely intense. In the past few years when I was on the run, I had come across many places where sects were set up. Back in the past, all the beings of the thousands of races would group up in a bunch and join any sect. However, right now, they are all divided out clearly. Every race has a sect of their own, and they never accept anyone unless they are from the same race.\"</p><br/><p>\"These are truly some great changes.\"</p><br/><p>Reverend Shakya could not help but lament over the great changes that had taken place.</p><br/><p>Right now, the Ancient race was no longer a problem for the thousands of races. Because of that, with this time available for them to grow, those genius disciples naturally soared in their cultivations, and were unstoppable in their paths forward.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan did not say anything. These were situations that he had expected to begin with.</p><br/><p>And just at this moment, they sensed some commotion happening up ahead.</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan brought Reverend Shakya over to this place, he was already feeling a little puzzled.</p><br/><p>There were a group of beings of the thousands of races gathered facing a mountain up ahead. The mountain looked extremely normal. However, there was a tremendous amount of power gathering within it.</p><br/><p>\"The Eternal God Seat is hidden within. This time around, we must definitely get our hands on it.\"</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The moment Lin Fan heard this, he was surprised. An Eternal God Seat hidden in a forbidden ground? This was way too strange\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

This was resourcefulness! This was his killer move!</p><br/><p>At times, the things that were most useful were still the things that were created by him in the past.</p><br/><p>On could just look at the Power of Biggra! So tyrannical! So awesome!</p><br/><p>Right now, Lin Fan had quite a number of killer moves. But, out of them, the most devious of all was still this Spirit of Biggra.</p><br/><p>At this moment, the Demon Lord reverted back to his original state now that he was unable to sustain the Heaven and Earth Figure.</p><br/><p>\u201cBig Bro! This fella\u2026What should we do?\u201d Qiu Zhanyu glared at this fella before him with hooked eyes. This was a Golden Immortal!</p><br/><p>In the Endless Mainland, a Golden Immortal could be considered as a powerful being of one whole part of the world. He could kill off anyone with just the flip of his palm.</p><br/><p>Even though Qiu Zhanyu and Jin Zhengu had explored the Endless Mainland for such a long time, they had really not come across a Golden Immortal state being.</p><br/><p>And, at the Golden Immortal state, there was a distinction in their levels as well. Not all Golden Immortal state beings were equally formidable.</p><br/><p>Some of the extremely strong Golden Immortal state powerful beings could kill four to five other Golden Immortals even at the same cultivation state. As for this Demon Lord, he must definitely be a talented genius amongst the Golden Immortals.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat else can we do? Of course, we must kill him! Otherwise, if we were remembered by heart by a Golden Immortal state being, that would be one hell of a tragedy.\u201d Lin Fan chuckled out.</p><br/><p>Qiu Zhanyu and Jin Zhengu nodded their heads immediately. Big Bro was right! If they were remembered by a Golden Immortal state being, they wouldn\u2019t be able to even sleep at night from here on forth!</p><br/><p>\u201cThis fella looks damned devilish, gosh! He looks even better than women! This is unbearable!\u201d Qiu Zhanyu remarked in envy.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can go ahead and reward him with a few kicks in the face.\u201d Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>The moment Qiu Zhanyu heard that, he was somewhat frightened. This was a Golden Immortal state powerful being! If he were to head up and give him some kicks and the other party ended up waking up, wouldn\u2019t he be dead meat?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you afraid of?\u201d Lin Fan shook his head. He then raised a fist and sent a flurry of punches down onto the face of the Demon Lord. At the same time, he was cussing out in his mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot only are you strong, you are so good looking! You deserve to be whacked!\u201d</p><br/><p>After he was done whacking, Lin Fan heaved out a sigh of relief. That was so darned releasing!</p><br/><p>The impact of the Blood Bursting Fist of the North Star was one that was extraordinary. Just those punches alone were enough to cause the face of the Demon Lord to swell and bruise up.</p><br/><p>When Qiu Zhanyu and Jin Zhengu caught sight of this, they could not help but gulp down their saliva. Big Bro was so tyrannical!</p><br/><p>Lin Fan raised his head and looked up at the void. At this moment, the void was extremely silent, without any form of activity.</p><br/><p>Now that this Golden Immortal Demon Lord was laying right below his feet, it was best to first harvest him in properly before killing him. At the same time, Lin Fan was immensely curious about just how many experience points he would gain from this.</p><br/><p>For Lin Fan, that was a world of curiosity there.</p><br/><p>\u201cBare Nudeness!\u201d</p><br/><p>This was another one of Lin Fan\u2019s godly techniques. As he moved his finger, all the clothing on the Demon Lord was stripped off.</p><br/><p>A storage ring landed in Lin Fan\u2019s hand, which he then opened to check out.</p><br/><p>Shing!</p><br/><p>An extremely sharp flash of light streaked by from within the storage ring and attacked Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was startled and made way immediately while his heart skipped a beat. To think that this Demon Lord would be this sinister that there were even tricks in his storage ring!</p><br/><p>But, Lin Fan had a headache right now. Who would have thought that this Demon Lord would have laid down a grand formation within the storage ring? The formation was revolving around endlessly while bearing a tremendous killing intent.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuehue\u2026 Do you think that you\u2019re able to block out Yours Truly with just something like this? That\u2019s got to be dreaming!\u201d Lin Fan tossed the storage ring into his Heaven and Earth Smelt directly.</p><br/><p>He then controlled the Heaven and Earth Smelt to refine this storage ring entirely. Under that power of refinement, the formation disintegrated as the treasures within were sprayed out into the Heaven and Earth Smelt.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan took a quick glance; there were quite a number of decent items.</p><br/><p>This was especially the case for a Spirit Vein present within the storage ring. The Spirit Vein was just like a gigantic dragon that swiveled around furiously within the Heaven and Earth Smelt while emanating a thick and boundless Spirit Qi.</p><br/><p>Refine!</p><br/><p>Lin Fan did not think twice as he forcefully refined everything within. There were quite a lot more herbs within. But, it was a pity that there were no more Immortal Herbs. Even then, regardless of what was inside, everything was all cultivated into a single item.</p><br/><p>Pills Through Thought!</p><br/><p>The pill fire burned out furiously as it wrapped out everything that the Demon Lord had within it. It didn\u2019t take long before a single pill appeared, floating gently within the Heaven and Earth Smelt.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026Congratulations on creating Immortal Attainment Pill.\u2019</p><br/><p>Lin Fan took the Immortal Pill and popped it in.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026Experience Points +300,000,000.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026Congratulations on leveling Cultivation State.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Cultivation State: True Immortal state middle level.\u2019</p><br/><p>Not bad, not bad! To think that this pill would give him a full gain in cultivation state!</p><br/><p>But on second thought, this was only about right. After all, this was a pill cultivated out using all of Demon Lord\u2019s Spirit Herbs. The experience points within must be vast indeed.</p><br/><p>If it were any ordinary person who had swallowed this pill, they would only be left with a single outcome: exploding out entirely. The tremendous amount of medicinal powers within it were definitely not something that ordinary folks could actually handle.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was the only one in possession of this System, and could convert the pill into experience points entirely.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Lin Fan cast his sights toward the Demon Lord, who was lying down on the ground, as his lips curled into a grin.</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe!\u201d</p><br/><p>An extremely dodgy smile beamed out widely on Lin Fan\u2019s face. This Demon Lord must have never imagined that he would have an outcome as such one day.</p><br/><p>As for Qiu Zhanyu and Jin Zhengu, when they heard that laughter, their body shivered out coldly. They felt that their Big Bro was really somewhat scary right now. At the same time, they felt some pity toward this Demon Lord. The Demon Lord was truly in an extremely wretched state right now.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Lin Fan took out the Eternal Axe and aimed slightly at the body of the Demon Lord.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Big Bro?\u201d Qiu Zhanyu asked.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shook his head, \u201cI\u2019m just thinking where I should chop first.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBig Bro! What is there to think about? Wouldn\u2019t it be fine to just cut down with a single axe and chop him to death?\u201d Qiu Zhanyu was puzzled.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t understand. There is much knowledge to be learned about chopping down people. If you chop down with too much violence, fresh blood will spray out everywhere. But, if you don\u2019t chop it down furiously enough, the other party might not die either. Therefore, the positioning is extremely important.\u201d Lin Fan said while gesticulating once more.</p><br/><p>Qiu Zhanyu and Jin Zhengu nodded their head with a \u2018Eureka!\u2019 expression, \u201cTo think that there is so much wisdom in chopping others!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s without a doubt.\u201d Lin Fan chuckled out.</p><br/><p>At this moment, the Demon Lord seemed as though he was about to wake up from his slumber. But, how could Lin Fan give the former that chance? With a single brick slapped down, he fell into a dead sleep once more.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuehue! Go die then!\u201d Lin Fan raised his axe and flung it down onto the body of the Demon Lord.</p><br/><p>This single axe was filled with extraordinary might. With an extremely sharp power, it cut through this totally unprepared body of the Demon Lord.</p><br/><p>BAM!</p><br/><p>The body of the Demon Lord split wide open.</p><br/><p>The Laws of the Golden Immortal were shattered immediately. This was a sight that had Qiu Zhanyu and Jin Zhengu totally taken aback.</p><br/><p>They knew that Laws were one of the most resolute existences in the world. But, to think that it would shatter with just a single cleave of that axe! The horrifying nature of this act was one that they could not dare to imagine at all.</p><br/><p>Terrifying! It was just way too terrifying!</p><br/><p>And at this moment, the notifications from the System came through, filling Lin Fan\u2019s heart with joy.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026Congratulations on slaying Golden Immortal full cultivation state powerful being.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026Experience Points +\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026Cultivation State leveled up.\u2019</p><br/><p>True Immortal state upper level!</p><br/><p>True Immortal state full cultivation state!</p><br/><p>Mystic Immortal lower level!</p><br/><p>Mystic immortal middle level!</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Mystic Immortal upper level!</p><br/><p>Mystic Immortal full cultivation state!</p><br/><p>\u201cHoly f*ck\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, Lin Fan\u2019s mouth was just agape. This was way too mother*cking savage, wasn\u2019t it? He was just literally skyrocketing right now!</p><br/><p>Skipping through so many levels in one single go! His life was so damned tyrannical!</p><br/><p>Perhaps, it might not be long before he could ascend to the heavens in a single step and just f*ck over the entire world!</p></div>\n</div>"}

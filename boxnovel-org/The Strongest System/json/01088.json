However, his heart was in misery right now. This was a feeling that should have never ever appeared in his heart; not now, not ever!</p><br/><p>But given everything before his eyes, he had no other choice than to make a decision.</p><br/><p>All of the disciples of the Kunlun God Sect were locked up within that Heaven and Earth Smelt. They were the future of the Kunlun God Sect. If these disciples were to be gone, the Kunlun God Sect would be entirely done for! From this day forth, they would most probably be even marked off from amongst the nine sects.</p><br/><p>White Saint\u2019s voice was hoarse, \u201cGeng Yangtian, just what do you want?\u201d</p><br/><p>He truly had no other way out right now. Fighting them head on doggedly? All the Senior Old Masters of the Heaven and Earth Sect were gathered here. Even if he were to continue fighting out, there was absolutely no way they could determine the victor. And now that all of the Kunlun God Sect\u2019s disciples were in the hands of the other party, what else could he honestly do?</p><br/><p>Geng Yangtian\u2019s mood was joyous right now. Being in seclusion for the entire time had him feeling numb toward all secular affairs. To think that the first affair he would have to deal with after such a long time would be something this big! It was something that had his old blood pumping once more, feeling absolutely incredulous. The surprises that this disciple had brought for him were way too many. Although, at times, it was more shocking than surprising to be honest.</p><br/><p>\u201cTELL ME! JUST WHAT IN THE WORLD DO YOU GUYS WANT?\u201d White Saint howled out with a baleful gaze. To think that he would be pushed to such an extent as a powerful being of Immortal King state. This was truly something absolutely unbelievable and unimaginable.</p><br/><p>That single howl of his contained a sense of exasperation and anguish more than anything else.</p><br/><p>Geng Yangtian looked over at Lin Fan, \u201cSo, what do you want to do with them?\u201d</p><br/><p>Geng Yangtian was truly at a loss right now. Now that this disciple had captured ALL of their disciples, well, he should probably come up with a demand as well. Treasures, pills etcetera\u2026 As a Senior Old Master of the Heaven and Earth Sect, Geng Yangtian was naturally not lacking in any of those things. For someone like him who lacked nothing, he truly did not know what he wanted from them anymore.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan\u2019s brows furrowed. This question was a little serious now. He truly had to give it a good thought \u2013 just what did he want from them?</p><br/><p>\u201cYou guys chit chat first. Give me some time to think about it.\u201d Lin Fan waved his hand off.</p><br/><p>Geng Yangtian glared at Lin Fan. Chit chat his a*s! If not for the fact that the disciples of the Kunlun God Sect were in his hands, White Saint would have long come for his neck! But well, given the way things were right now, what else could they do other than chit chat?</p><br/><p>\u201cSay, White Saint, do you remember a time back in the past when we were both Inner Sect disciples? Back then, we came across a treasure in a secret ground and fought over it. You remember that scene? Although, it was only natural that I obtained that treasure in the end. After all, my skill was still that bit better, and my might slightly greater than yours.\u201d Geng Yangtian started reminiscing about the past.</p><br/><p>However, White Saint seemed as though he was hadn\u2019t taken anything into his head as he just glared at Lin Fan fixatedly with a death stare.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>At this moment, Geng Yangtian started rambling on nonstop as though he had found himself swimming in the nostalgia of the yesteryears.</p><br/><p>After thinking for a moment, Lin Fan slapped out at his thighs in eureka and coughed out gently, \u201cAll of you Senior Old Masters, hurry and hand me all the treasures you guys have with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment those words came out, the entire scene fell into a state of absolute horror.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat lad is so darned bloody greedy! Treasures of the Senior Old Masters of the Kunlun God Sect? What sort of treasures would those be? And to think that he would come demanding for EVERYTHING they had with them!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s too much! I wonder if the Senior Old Masters of the Kunlun God Sect would agree to it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf they don\u2019t agree to it, what else can they do? The other party has their weakness in his hands\u2026unless they truly want the Kunlun God Sect to disappear and be annihilated forever!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis has truly been an eye opener. From this day forth, there should be no one in the entire Endless Mainland who would dare to mess with this person anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho in the bloody world would be sick enough to mess with him? He\u2019s one hell of a twisted f*ck!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Geng Yangtian threw Lin Fan a gaze. The message he was trying to convey was clear \u2013 this demand was a little overboard, wasn\u2019t it?</p><br/><p>All the treasures of powerful beings of Immortal King state? That was an astronomical fortune! This was especially the case for White Saint. After being an Immortal King for such a long time, the wealth he carried with him must definitely be as vast as an ocean!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you trying to do? Don\u2019t come railing at me now! If I were to get careless and have all of the disciples of the Kunlun God Sect in this smelt killed, you had better not come and blame me.\u201d Looking at how White Saint was about to rail out at him, Lin Fan spoke up immediately.</p><br/><p>Indeed, White Saint was truly about to shout out at Lin Fan. However, he dug that impulse deep into his heart.</p><br/><p>\u2018Bear with it! I absolutely have to bear with it!\u2019</p><br/><p>The legacy of the Kunlun God Sect must be passed down! If it were to end in his hands, he might not be able to forgive himself for his entire life! Perhaps, he might never be able to attain the great Dao of Heavenly Lord in this lifetime of his by then.</p><br/><p>White Saint looked over at Lin Fan, then at the disciples within the Heaven and Earth Smelt. The tradition of the Kunlun God Sect must not break. Must. Not. Break! Must. Not. End!</p><br/><p>\u201cHeaven and Earth Sect, you guys mustn\u2019t go overboard.\u201d White Saint finally spoke up.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan\u2019s brows knitted, \u201cOverboard? I don\u2019t think this is overboard in the slightest bit. Remember this now, your Kunlun God Sect was the one that had been trying to kill me from the very beginning. It was just that your strength was way too pathetic, and were unable to kill Your Daddy! And now that karma has arrived, you guys will just have to deal with it!\u201d</p><br/><p>When White Saint heard those words, he did not even know how he should feel about it.</p><br/><p>He was first and foremost extremely disappointed with Tai Qiantian. To think that he would even fail at killing a nameless little disciple. How could he carry the name of the Kunlun God Sect\u2019s Grandmaster like that? And to think that this disciple had even come knocking right on their doorsteps. This was truly the biggest humiliation that the Kunlun God Sect had faced in its entire history.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhite Saint, I\u2019m already giving you guys a path left to walk. I\u2019m not even demanding for all the items in your Kunlun God Sect\u2019s Treasure Chamber. All I\u2019m asking for are the items that you Senior Old Masters are carrying with you right now.\u201d Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>White Saint lowered his head and agreed to it eventually, \u201cAlright, I\u2019ll give it to you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>PHWOOOOOOM!</p><br/><p>As he swept out his sleeves, a stream of treasures flew out from White Saint\u2019s person. These were all the belongings of an Immortal King, and could be described as nothing less than a vast ocean. Just these treasures alone were more than enough for one to create a middle sized sect.</p><br/><p>And, if one were to make use of them appropriately, it could even propel them to the Immortal King state.</p><br/><p>This was how profound the resources of an Immortal King were.</p><br/><p>When all the powerful beings who were spectating up in the void caught sight of the treasures, their hearts were filled completely with greed. But given the current situation, all of them held it back in. They had better forget about it. With so many Senior Old Masters who were Immortal King state beings, the only people who would dare to try making a move on those treasures would be those who were tired of living.</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan caught sight of everything, his heart skipped with joy.</p><br/><p>Immortal Pills!</p><br/><p>Weapon Crafting Legendary Materials!</p><br/><p>Immortal Herbs!</p><br/><p>There were all sorts of treasures here. This was just absolutely blinding!</p><br/><p>Pointing out with his finger, Lin Fan sent all of those treasures into his storage.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood\u2026 Very good! Now, all the other remaining Senior Old Masters? Hand over your treasures now.\u201d Lin Fan chuckled out.</p><br/><p>This feeling was truly way too amazing!</p><br/><p>Actually, Lin Fan\u2019s plan at the start was to have a couple of Immortal King Old Masters killed so that he could raise his cultivation state rapidly. But, the way things had panned out was beyond his expectations.</p><br/><p>Even though the Lin Brand\u2019s Soap was extremely tyrannical, he only had two more chances left with it. If he were to use it right now, it might not give him the desired outcome he wanted.</p><br/><p>In fact, he might even be cockblocked by some of those people. By then, that would be a real tragedy.</p><br/><p>Therefore, Lin Fan decided to scrap the idea completely and not give it a try at all. Being able to kill Old Master Qi Tian and Tai Qiantian was already one hell of a profit for him. There were definitely going to be more chances for him to kill off enemies in the future. Losing this one day would not mean much.</p><br/><p>Now that White Saint had already taken out all his treasures, what could the other Senior Old Masters do? Naturally, they handed out all of their treasures as well.</p><br/><p>But right now, Lin Fan was just looking at them in disdain. These guys were way too poor, weren\u2019t they? Compared to White Saint, it didn\u2019t even seem as though they were of the same cultivation state!</p><br/><p>\u201cOi! You guys are not hiding anything, are you? How can it be this little?\u201d Lin Fan asked.</p><br/><p>But when he found out that this was truly all there was to it, he could only shake his head helplessly. This was truly such a pity!</p><br/><p>Lin Fan asked softly, \u201cOld Master, do you think I should really let all of them off now? Do you think I should keep a few important figures with me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Geng Yangtian shook his head, \u201cNo need\u2026 Let them all go. We of the Heaven and Earth Sect must be men of our words and never deceive others.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright then.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan opened up the lid of the Heaven and Earth Smelt and released all of the Kunlun God Sect\u2019s disciples</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, listen up now, Kunlun God Sect! This time around, this should serve as a lesson for you guys. If you dare to do this again next time, things will not be this simple anymore!\u201d Lin Fan declared loudly.</p><br/><p>Even though the disciples of the Kunlun God Sect were feeling extremely vengeful in their hearts right now, none of them dared to act brazenly. In the Heaven and Earth Smelt, they too had witnessed how their Old Masters had handed over all of their treasures. They were redeeming the hostages with their entire fortunes.</p><br/><p>This was something that touched them to the bottom of their hearts.</p><br/><p>They truly did not choose the wrong sect at all! Even though they were bullied right now, they firmly believed that they would be able to get their dignity back one day.</p><br/><p>They were determined to cultivate tirelessly and fight for the sect\u2019s glory in order to take down that huge devil of the Heaven and Earth Sect \u2013 Lin Fan.</p></div>\n</div>"}

In an instant, that seal turned into dust and vanished without a trace.</p><br/><p>\u201cFinally, my strength has returned!\u201d Lin Fan was overwhelmed with joy in his heart.</p><br/><p>For the past eleven years, he had been working hard day and night, and finally, he had successfully removed the seal. If he were to just wait for it to dissipate naturally, it would have to take a minimum of twenty years at least.</p><br/><p>That period of time was something that he couldn\u2019t afford.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Lin Fan raised his head and took a look at this foreign world in front of him.</p><br/><p>Endless Mainland\u2026</p><br/><p>This was a vast world with countless of powerful beings within it. There were many things that Lin Fan did not know about here.</p><br/><p>\u201cBloody hell! My strength has finally returned! Even though I\u2019m not the strongest in this Endless Mainland, my strength is still pretty darn mighty. The next step will be to go according to the conclusion of the discussion with the Fire Water Empress and the others.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTime to join a sect.\u201d</p><br/><p>The martial arts mystic skills that were cultivated in this world were all different from those he had cultivated back in the Xuanhuang World and the Ancient Saint World.</p><br/><p>If he wanted to raise his cultivation state quickly, this was the only plan now.</p><br/><p>Naturally, if he wanted to depend just on himself to become a top tiered powerful being, that wouldn\u2019t be an issue either. However, his speed of cultivation will definitely not be as fast as if he were to join a sect.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Rising Dragon City\u2026</p><br/><p>Three beautiful figures appeared on the streets. The appearance of these three beautiful figures attracted all the attention of the commoners in the surroundings.</p><br/><p>These were the three beauties of the Lin Family.</p><br/><p>Amongst them, the one who was born together with Lin Fan was also slender and elegant, with a clean and pretty face.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go buy some presents for Little Bro.\u201d The Big Sister of the Lin Family was already fifteen years old right now. As a female of the Endless Mainland, this was an age where she should be discussing about affairs regarding marriage by now.</p><br/><p>However, this Big Sister had a pretty decent gift. Her strength at the Divine celestial level 4 state. If she had the affinity to join a sect, she would naturally have a brighter future awaiting her.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright! Say, Little Bro has always refrained from speaking much after all these years. Do you guys think that Little Bro really doesn\u2019t like talking?\u201d The second Sister of the Lin Family, Lin Feixue asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cBig Sister, second Sister, it\u2019s not that third Brother does not like talking. It\u2019s just that he loves contemplating about things!\u201d The youngest brat of the Lin Family, Lin Lan\u2019er replied.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cOho! The ladies of the Lin Family are well groomed indeed! Indeed, each one is prettier than the other! Fresh!\u201d At this moment, a voice of a hedonistic nature traveled over.</p><br/><p>On the other side of the street stood a man while waving his hand fan. He was followed by a bunch of dog lackeys that roared out in laughter as they walked along.</p><br/><p>When the commoners caught sight of the man, all of them were so frightened that they stumbled back a few steps.</p><br/><p>This was the eldest son of Rising Dragon City\u2019s Huang Family, Huang Tailong. Although he was only seventeen years old, his cultivation state was already at Divine celestial level 7 state. In the Rising Dragon City alone, he could be considered as some sort of a prodigy by now.</p><br/><p>As for the Huang Family, they were not too bad themselves either. Amongst the eight great families, they were one of the top three.</p><br/><p>Compared to the Huang Family, the Lin Family was way too far down. In fact, there could barely even be a comparison between them.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuang Tailong, what are you thinking of doing?\u201d The eldest daughter of the Lin Family, Lin Hanyu, shielded her two younger sisters behind her while glaring at Huang Tailong warily.</p><br/><p>From the get-go, this Huang Tailong did not have too good a reputation within the Rising Dragon City. And, coupled with the fact that his strength was tremendously strong, there were many people who were taken advantage of by him.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat am I thinking of doing? I\u2019m definitely not thinking of doing anything. But, seems like I\u2019ve got to head over to the Lin Family to propose for marriage now.\u201d Huang Tailong folded the hand fan he was holding and smirked out. His entire attitude reeked of dandyism.</p><br/><p>\u201cDream on!\u201d Lin Lan\u2019er was hiding behind her eldest sister nervously when she popped her head out and said in distaste.</p><br/><p>\u201cHAHA!\u201d Huang Tailong burst out laughing before taking a step forth. However, with that single step, he appeared right before the face of Lin Lan\u2019er as he caressed those tender cheeks of hers, \u201cLittle brat, do you believe that Your Young Master can just head over to the Lin Family to propose marriage and take you in as my wife right now? Let\u2019s see if your father dares to utter a single word of nonsense.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh my, oh my! Hanyu\u2026 how could you be this violent? Now, now\u2026 It isn\u2019t good to get all physical now, is it?\u201d Huang Tailong stood firm on his ground as he grabbed onto Lin Hanyu\u2019s oncoming hand, then fondled it, \u201cThis hand is really quite silky smooth, eh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShameless\u2026!\u201d Lin Hanyu blared out.</p><br/><p>\u201cHAHAHA! Shameless and whatnot. Even though your Lin Family is one of the eight great families of the Rising Dragon City, you guys are barely scrapping by. And, I\u2019ve heard that the Young Master of your Lin Family is nothing but a piece of trash? Seems like the entire Lin Family will be done for by this generation. I\u2019d say, the three of you might as well follow under Your Young Master here. At least if you come under Your Young Master as disciples of my family, you guys can upgrade from being wild chickens to phoenixes!\u201d Huang Tailong mocked out while laughing.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026!\u201d The face of Lin Hanyu was red with fury.</p><br/><p>\u201cBoohoo\u2026!\u201d The youngest sister, Lin Lan\u2019er, was so scared that her eyes were brimming with tears as they pitter-pattered down onto the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Sister, don\u2019t cry.\u201d Lin Hanyu consoled her before glaring at Huang Tailong, \u201cJust what do you want?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHAHA! Forget it. Boring! Go home and tell that trash of a father you have that Your Young Master will be dropping down personally in a few days\u2019 time to visit and propose marriage for the three of you to be my wives.\u201d Huang Tailong roared out in laughter before turning around to walk off.</p><br/><p>\u201cBig Sister\u2026!\u201d The second Sister, Lin Feixue, was feeling afraid now. This was especially after the last sentence that Huang Tailong had said, which raised an intense fear in her heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be afraid now. He\u2019s just dreaming on his own. Let\u2019s head back.\u201d Lin Hanyu said in anger.</p><br/><p>Lin Family\u2026</p><br/><p>When the three sisters returned bearing such weird expressions on their faces, it seemed as though something big had happened. The servants and housekeepers did not know just what was wrong.</p><br/><p>\u201cMissy, is there anything that\u2019s wrong?\u201d The old housekeeper of the Lin Family had been serving them for many years now; therefore, he naturally asked out of concern.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201d Lin Hanyu shook her head.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh! My precious daughters, you are all back!\u201d When Lin Haoming caught sight of his three precious daughters, his face broke into a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you guys? Did something happen?\u201d When Mrs. Lin took a look at her three daughters, it was only natural that she could tell that something was up.</p><br/><p>\u201cFather, mother, when we were on the streets, we were bullied by Huang Tailong. He pinched my face and touched Big Sister\u2019s hand! He even said that he\u2019s going to come over to our Lin Family in a few days\u2019 time to take us in as his wives!\u201d Lin Lan\u2019er bawled out in tears.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat bastard! This Huang Tailong is getting overboard with his bullying!\u201d Lin Haoming hollered in rage. However, he knew that even though the Lin Family was still considered as one of the eight great families, it was the weakest one amongst all of them.</p><br/><p>Given the current state of the Lin Family, he was the only one who could do something. But even then, that didn\u2019t amount to much.</p><br/><p>But, now that his precious daughters had been bullied by that Huang Tailong, there was naturally no way he could possibly endure this at all. Still, if they were to clash with the Huang Family, the latter could use it as an excuse to deal with them. By that time, things would truly be out of hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere is the Huang Family?\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, a voice rang out.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Huang Family resides at the west of the city.\u201d Lin Haoming said by sheer reflex. But suddenly, he snapped to his senses, \u201cSon! What are you asking this for?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Brother.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBig Brother\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan\u2019s face was composed, showing neither anger nor happiness. His hands were placed behind his back as he looked at the masses.</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter staying here for eleven years, I AM getting a little bored. Time to go look for the Huang Family to relieve my boredom.\u201d Lin Fan chuckled out. Curling his finger, a streak of light bolted over.</p><br/><p>An ordinary longsword within the Practice Hall tore through the void before appearing in his hands. By the time Lin Fan next moved, he had already appeared far in the distance.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Brother, he\u2026!\u201d Lin Hanyu was frozen as though this was too much for her to come to terms with.</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t my son a wasted cripple? Since when had he known how to cultivate? And why is he talking so much today?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot good! Hurry up and go after him\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, Lin Haoming suddenly came to his senses before he slapped at his thighs and chased after Lin Fan.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

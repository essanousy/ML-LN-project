The difference was on an entirely different level.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not wrong, the residences of the outer sect disciples are all located here.\u201d Ni Mingyang said while smiling, \u201cJunior-brother, work and train hard, do not fall behind. But then again, you\u2019re a genius, so you definitely will succeed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you Senior-brother Ni.\u201d Lin Fan nodded, \u201cSenior-brother Ni, how come this residence is so different from senior-brother Meng\u2019s?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJunior-brother, Senior-brother Meng is one of sect\u2019s top ten genius disciples, so of course the treatment will be a bit different\u2026 But as long as junior-brother works hard in the future, you most definitely will also receive the same treatment as Senior-brother Meng.\u201d Ni Mingyang comforted.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked towards Ni Mingyang and nodded his head, \u2018Aren\u2019t you stating the plain obvious? With the power of Yours Truly, with just a little bit of effort, even the sect\u2019s top ten genius disciples will become my experience treasure-trove. But for now let\u2019s just lay low and go about this slowly, one step at a time.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior-brother Meng, how many outer sect disciples are there in total?\u201d Lin Fan inquired. \"Eight thousand eight hundred eighty-eight people.\" Ni Mingyang said. Upon hearing this Lin Fan\u2019s heart leaped with joy, \u2018More than eight thousand people, it seems after playing around here a bit and obtaining some more experience, securely achieving postcelestial stage is merely child\u2019s play.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cJunior-brother what are you smiling about?\u201d Ni Mingyang seeing Lin Fan smiling alone, asked in confusion.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I am not smiling, Senior-brother. I am feeling tired, so I wanted to go rest up.\u201d At the moment, Lin Fan wanted to investigate the surroundings, take appropriate measures, and prepare to catch a big one.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, then take a good rest Junior-brother, your Senior-brother will take his leave now.\u201d Ni Mingyang said. \u201cGoodbye Senior-brother, I will come see you in a few days.\u201d Lin Fan said while waving his hand. Ni Mingyang, who was preparing to leave, turned white in fear and quickened his pace upon hearing these words. \u2018No good, I must move when I return home. If this guy comes to see me, it definitely will be for no good reason.\u2019</p><br/><p>Back inside the house\u2026</p><br/><p>Lin Fan opened the items he had collected. Medicinal pills contained inside a white bottle, a light colored long robe, a pair of shoes, a sword, an iron emblem, and a not too thick manual\u2026and that was it\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2018Just these many items?\u2019 Lin Fan sighed, feeling that the sect was a bit stingy. Lin Fan then dumped out a medicinal pill from inside the white bottle. The pill was white, the size of a soybean.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026 discovered \u2018circulation pill\u2019 \u2018</p><br/><p>\u2018Effects: Ingestion by ordinary people will increase inner energy circulation flow, strengthening the body, refining the internal organs, can only take one per day.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Ingestion increase: experience + 100.\u2019</p><br/><p>Lin Fan counted, \u2018A total of 30 pills\u2026 It seems these are given on a monthly basis.\u2019</p><br/><p>Lin Fan directly poured out all the medicinal pills and stuffed them into his mouth, gulping them all down at once.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026 experience + 3000.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018It seems that ingesting medicine will also be a good way to level up in the future,\u2019 he thought. But for now, he was unfamiliar with this area, and hence there was a need to investigate it thoroughly. Afterward, Lin Fan picked up the distributed sect clothing and felt it with his hands, \u2018Not bad, not bad\u2026 the material is rather reliable, very smooth. But what\u2019s up with this, why is there a split on the left and right, is this perhaps a cheongsam?\u2019</p><br/><p>And it was also lift-able from the back, saving the trouble of having to undress.\u2018This\u2026\u2019 At this moment, Lin Fan couldn\u2019t help but become rather sinister.</p><br/><p>Then Lin Fan picked up the sword, testing it out in both hands. It was merely an ordinary sword, quite useless, so he directly threw it aside.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026 discovered\u300aSaint Devil secret manual\u300b\u2026 Learn?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cLearn.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, inside a variety of information appeared inside Lin Fan\u2019s head which he didn\u2019t previously know.</p><br/><p>\u2018Not bad, not bad\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>The next day\u2026Training field\u2026</p><br/><p>The outer sect examination disciples came to the training field one after another. At the same time, the faces of the outer sect examination disciples revealed a blissfully happy smile, as if something joyous had occurred. \u201cHeh, senior brother is smart, managing to get rid of that monster. We won\u2019t be bullied by him from now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Standing in the middle of the crowd, the unparalleled pretty boy smiled confidently, \u201cA mere trivial matter.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cClever senior-brother.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior-brother is a brilliant person, his brain is better than anyone else\u2019s.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The surrounding outer sect examination disciples gathered around the unparalleled pretty boy, dousing him in flattery. The pretty boy was also enjoying this current situation and was smiling as bright as a sunflower.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>In the early morning, Lin Fan hurriedly got up. He couldn\u2019t allow his daily plans to be delayed from something like sleeping in. Since he had entered the outer sect, he needed to properly utilize the current resources, \u2018Those outer sect disciples are all innocent little lambs that have not been harmed yet. Each one of them is softly calling out, just waiting for Yours Truly to invade.\u2019</p><br/><p>Lin Fan wore the lightly colored long robes of the outer sect disciples, tied the emblem to his waist, and walked towards the outside. Now, he needed to find the area where the outer sect disciples were training.</p><br/><p>But when Lin Fan arrived at the place, he was instantly confused.</p><br/><p>What\u2019s this situation? Where did all the outer sect disciples run off to? How was the huge outer sect disciple training field this empty? There were only a few people, easily countable; this was completely different than what Lin Fan had in mind.</p><br/><p>\u2018Under normal circumstances, this outer sect training field should be packed full of people, each one training their hardest. What\u2019s up with this current situation? Is it possible that Yours Truly might need to return over to where the outer sect examination disciples are?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Those guys can\u2019t even provide much experience anymore, low enough to just completely disregard them. Heavens and earth\u2026 is it possible you just want me to decay away like this?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018I want to train, I want to level up.\u2019</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said nothing and directly stopped one person. \u201cSenior-brother, may I ask why there is barely anyone on this training field?\u201dLin Fan asked in a friendly manner. The expression of the person stopped by Lin Fan didn\u2019t look too good. Carefully looking at Lin Fan and seeing the emblem on his waist, he then asked, \u201cAre you a new outer sect disciple?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Lin Fan replied while nodding.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe outer sect training field usually doesn\u2019t have many people. The vast majority of brothers typically train at their own quarters.\u201d The dragon-sleeved Senior-brother lightly replied, seeing that the attitude of this Junior-brother was quite nice.</p><br/><p>\u201cI see.\u201d Lin Fan nodded, \u2018But this is quite troublesome. They all train within their own quarters, just what method should he use to lure those guys out? It seems there is a need to think about it and make a plan.\u2019</p><br/><p>But\u2026for now, Lin Fan had a crucial matter that he needed to take care of.</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior-brother, may I ask how you are viewed upon amongst the outer sect disciples?\u201d Lin Fan curiously asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cRespected by everyone.\u201d The dragon-sleeved Senior-brother raised his head while proudly saying. Lin Fan looked at the other party, \u2018He had a bit of swag, so it was likely true.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cMay I ask for Senior brothers name?\u201d Lin Fan asked humbly.</p><br/><p>\"Han Lu.\u201d Even though senior-brother Han didn\u2019t understand why this outer sect Junior-brother asked this, he still decided to reply to the other party.</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior-brother Han, how do you see me?\u201d Lin Fan asked. Han Lu looked at Lin Fan in confusion, his heart asking thousands of questions\u2026 Just what did this junior-brother want? He was currently heading over to Elder Chuan Gong to borrow a manual. If he ended up missing the time, he\u2019d be deeply regretful.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is the first time I met junior-brother, so it\u2019s hard to say. If there is anything else Junior-brother needs, let\u2019s talk next time. Since your Senior-brother has business he needs to attend to, I must leave now.\u201d Han Lu hurriedly said, as if he didn\u2019t want to talk anymore with Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Alright, senior-brother take care.\u201d Lin Fan said while smiling. Han Lu nodded and then turned around leaving. \"Senior-brother, please wait.\u201d Lin Fan spoke up suddenly at this moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Han Lu turned around in doubt. But the instant he turned around, Lin Fan immediately moved.</p><br/><p>\u201cMonkey Steals Peach\u2026\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

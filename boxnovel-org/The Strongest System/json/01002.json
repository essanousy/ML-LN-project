The strength of this fella had gone far beyond their expectations. Initially, they had thought that the Supreme Grade Immortal Weapon, the Heaven and Earth Net, would be able to fight against this fella. But, who would have thought that the other party had come prepared?</p><br/><p>Yin Zhenfeng struck out with his palm as he sent forth his move, the Baleful Yin Murdering Heaven Palm that pushed all the way through. This was a martial arts mystic skill that carried with it the Demonic Qi of the Earth Abyss in the Endless Mainland and was formed from its culmination. When it was deployed, there was a sinister Power of Baleful Yin that was sent forth in waves along with it.</p><br/><p>If there were any beings who were weaker and ended up in contact with this Power of Baleful Yin, they would be turned into ashes immediately.</p><br/><p>The Baleful Yin rumbled out as a menacing dragon howled over. This dragon looked exceptionally malevolent, and those jet black scales it had shone with a cold gleam.</p><br/><p>\u201cDIE\u2026!\u201d Yin Zhenfeng snorted out coldly as his eyes shone with a violent, berserk look.</p><br/><p>\u201cLITTLE BROTHER, LET US MEET AGAIN IN OUR NEXT LIFETIME.\u201d Qiu Zhanyu shook that rotund and plump body of his before screaming out.</p><br/><p>\u201cBIG BROTHER, WE WILL! DON\u2019T WORRY ABOUT THAT!\u201d Jin Zhengu howled out as well.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Lin Fan, who was standing at the sidelines, chuckled out helplessly. Shifting his body nimbly, he disappeared from where he was. By the time he next appeared, he slapped up with his palm, shattering the void and controlling that sinister dragon within it.</p><br/><p>BAM!</p><br/><p>Moving his palm, Lin Fan\u2019s fingers were just like claws as a berserk amount of power was gathered within, crushing that sinister dragon into dust.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d Yin Zhenfeng\u2019s face froze up as he glared at Lin Fan warily. He then looked at the token at Lin Fan\u2019s waist before scoffing out coldly, \u201cYou are a Remnant of the Heaven and Earth Sect.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked around at his waist. Oh, so this was the thing that had revealed his identity to the outside world.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs a disciple of the Heaven and Earth Sect, what are you trying to do? Unless you\u2019re thinking about helping these two fellas and waging war with my Heavenly Demon Sect, are you?\u201d The voice of Yin Zhenfeng was grim right now.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow, those words of yours are getting a little cocky now. I\u2019m watching over these two people, and yet you\u2019re thinking of killing them. Are YOU thinking about waging war with my Heaven and Earth Sect?\u201d Lin Fan\u2019s brows furrowed as he reversed the question.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026!\u201d Yin Zhenfeng\u2019s face was dark. It was as though he had not expected that the other party would actually spout out words as such.</p><br/><p>Qiu Zhanyu and Jin Zhengu, who had already been waiting to receive death, were so emotional at the fact that there was someone who was here to save them that they hugged out at Lin Fan\u2019s thighs immediately.</p><br/><p>\u201cBig Brother, please save us!\u201d Qiu Zhanyu and Jin Zhengu bowed down without a single bit of hesitation. This was something that had Lin Fan feeling bemused.</p><br/><p>\u201cWeren\u2019t you guys trying to rob me just moments earlier?\u201d Lin Fan asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cBig Brother\u2026 we were in the wrong! As long as you save us, Big Brother, we will definitely compensate you properly and accordingly!\u201d Qiu Zhanyu and Jin Zhengu cried out.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan\u2019s lips curled into a grin.</p><br/><p>The main reason for this was that it had been a long time since Lin Fan had received some experience points right now. As for this Yin Zhenfeng before him? This was a huge amount of walking experience points here!</p><br/><p>True Immortal state middle level\u2026 Even though this wasn\u2019t the largest fish out in the sea, this was sufficient for the current Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>\u201cEven though you\u2019re a Remnant of the Heaven and Earth Sect,\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018???\u2019</p><br/><p>Before Yin Zhenfeng had even finished with his words, he realized that this guy had already struck out at him!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen it\u2019s time to fight, you must never ever beep beep. Otherwise, it\u2019ll lead to your death.\u201d</p><br/><p>In a flash, Lin Fan appeared right before Yin Zhenfeng. He hurled out a fist that had a speed so fast that it was enough to have everyone\u2019s jaws drop in amazement.</p><br/><p>BAM!</p><br/><p>An explosion boomed out; this fist of Lin Fan wasn\u2019t one that was so easy to block against.</p><br/><p>So what if one was at True Immortal state middle level? If they were struck by it, it would still be one hell of a wallop for them.</p><br/><p>The Blood Bursting Fist of the North Star was brought by Lin Fan to the Endless Mainland as well. A single fist was enough to have Yin Zhenfeng\u2019s entire face rupture, causing an endless amount of blood to spray out.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn it!\u201d Yin Zhenfeng was enraged right now. As he slapped his palms together, a red beam of light shone out from within his palms. This blood light was extremely sinister, carrying a torrential Demonic Qi.</p><br/><p>\u201cDemonic Earth Abyss!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yin Zhenfeng started separating his palms slowly. When they were separating out, an extremely horrifying abyss formed within his palms as though it was about to descend down upon the world.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamned fella! How dare you challenge my might? I\u2019ll have you dead!\u201d Yin Zhenfeng roared out in rage. The Laws of True Immortals surged out from within his body. When a powerful being reached the True Immortal state, they would be able to sense the Heaven and Earth and utilize the might of the Heaven and Earth itself to suppress their enemies.</p><br/><p>Therefore, within the Endless Mainland, unless it was some exceptional prodigy or had some treasures, there was practically no chance for anyone of Immemorial Ancient state to want to defeat someone of True Immortal state.</p><br/><p>The difficulty of that was extremely high, similar to one wanting to ascend into the highest Heavens.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet us net!\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, Lin Fan had already made his preparations when all of a sudden, a gigantic net appeared around Yin Zhenfeng out of nowhere.</p><br/><p>Yin Zhenfeng\u2019s face changed immediately. He wanted to defend against this, but he was a step too late.</p><br/><p>Thud!</p><br/><p>He was netted right in the middle, without any chance of fighting back at all.</p><br/><p>Within the net, Yin Zhenfeng found all of his powers being sealed up. In fact, he did not have any bit of strength remaining to even continue floating up in the void.</p><br/><p>\u201cBig Brother! We\u2019ve caught him!\u201d Jin Zhengu was tugging furiously as he exerted strength into both arms to drag the net and his captive over.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Brother, you\u2019re so incredible!\u201d Qiu Zhanyu yelled out excitedly.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was slightly speechless right now. He did not even have a chance to show off! What a tragedy!</p><br/><p>\u201cLet me go! You bunch of dogsh*ts! As long as Your Father doesn\u2019t die, I\u2019ll make sure to turn you guys into nothing but ashes and bones!\u201d Yin Zhenfeng was yelling out. His face was so grim that it was extremely horrifying to look at.</p><br/><p>Qiu Zhanyu and Jin Zhengu were evidently rattled by that threat.</p><br/><p>\u201cBig Brother, come over here for a moment!\u201d Jin Zhengu beckoned out towards Qiu Zhanyu as the both of them huddled their heads deep in conversation once more.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat should we do with this fella? If we let him off, he will definitely come and kill us in the future!\u201d Jin Zhengu asked worriedly.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Brother, do you have any more brilliant suggestions? This fella is indeed a problem!\u201d Qiu Zhanyu did not know what to do right now either.</p><br/><p>\u201cBig Brother, should we just kill him? Or, how about let\u2019s rear him up so that he can\u2019t escape for his entire life?\u201d Jin Zhengu suggested.</p><br/><p>The moment Qiu Zhanyu heard those words, he shook his head, \u201cWe can\u2019t kill him! This guy seems to be a disciple of the Heavenly Demon Sect! If we were to kill him, it\u2019s going to be one hell of a tragedy for us!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShould we just keep him locked up in the net for all eternity, so that he can\u2019t get out for his entire life?\u201d Jin Zhengu asked.</p><br/><p>The moment Qiu Zhanyu heard this, he nodded his head, \u201cLittle Brother! You are really quick witted! That is such an amazing plan! Alright, let\u2019s do that then!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cARGH!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHOW DARE YOU TRY TO KILL ME?\u201d</p><br/><p>BAM!</p><br/><p>Just as Qiu Zhanyu and Jin Zhengu were done discussing, a tragic wail rang out. They looked over to see Lin Fan stamping down on Yin Zhenfeng with his feet before channeling his powers to rumble out, crushing him to death in the blink of an eye.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis\u2026!\u201d When Qiu Zhanyu and Jin Zhengu caught sight of that, they were completely dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve killed him\u2026!\u201d The both of them raised their heads and looked over at Lin Fan blankly.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan revealed a wide beam.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026 Congratulations on killing True Immortal state middle level being Yin Zhenfeng.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026 Experience Points +70,000,000.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026 Cultivation State leveled up.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Cultivation State: True Immortal state.\u2019</p><br/><p>All of a sudden, after the notifications from the System came to an end, there was a sudden change within Lin Fan\u2019s body. The powers within his body were rumbling out like a gushing river that could not stay restrained.</p><br/><p>BOOM!</p><br/><p>Within Lin Fan\u2019s Inner World, a door appeared all of a sudden. This door seemed as though it was a door to the Heaven and Earth. Under the ramming of his torrential power, the door was slammed open directly.</p><br/><p>If anyone else were to know about this, they would definitely be shocked with a look of absolute horror.</p><br/><p>What kind of a bloody joke was this? Opening the Heaven and Earth door with such ease as though a window was being opened? How horrifying was this?</p><br/><p>Above Lin Fan\u2019s head, the powers gushed up through the Heaven and Earth as the Law of the True Immortals wrapped around his entire body.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan\u2019s Law of True Immortals was extremely thick compared to anyone else\u2019s. This was a Law that was even thicker than most other True Immortal state beings, evidence of just how deep his foundations and resources were.</p></div>\n</div>"}

In the boundless void, the energy grid line chains swirled around in a circular motion like agile snakes.</p><br/><p>Ooooooooooooooooooom.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Lin Fan\u2019s house seemed to be encompassed by a massive energy barrier.</p><br/><p>Everyone on Nameless Peak\u2019s faces changed immediately as they turned towards the Master\u2019s house immediately.</p><br/><p>\"That energy\u2026!\" With the highest cultivation state, Mie Qiongqi\u2019s sensitivity towards energy levels was the strongest as well. The moment Lin Fan summoned his energy grid line chains, he could already sense this boundless sea of energy.</p><br/><p>At this moment, the house where their Master was residing within seemed to be contorting gradually. This was a mirage that was formed by the explosive amount of energy.</p><br/><p>\"Master, what\u2019s wrong?\" Zhang Ergou asked in extreme bewilderment.</p><br/><p>\"Nothing. This is the Master\u2019s powers. To think that Master would be this strong. All of you, look up.\" Mie Qiongqi pointed above the house.</p><br/><p>The sky was being distorted as well, forming a black vortex of energy whirlpool. Within it, the energy grid line chains swam like eels.</p><br/><p>\"Energy grid line chains\u2026\" Looking at the scene, Mie Qiongqi was stupefied.</p><br/><p>Within the black vortex, the amount of energy grid line chains was so dense that it was beyond anyone\u2019s imaginations.</p><br/><p>Strong. Simply too strong!</p><br/><p>Just how did Master do it?!</p><br/><p>As a greater celestial, Mie Qionqi\u2019s comprehension of energy grid line chains was already pretty deep right now.</p><br/><p>The more energy grid line chains one possessed, the stronger the person was. As for him, he could only congeal energy grid line chains of \u2018Unkillable Indestructible\u2019.</p><br/><p>There was just a total of two chains.</p><br/><p>But for him, he had been gradually strengthening the power of those two chains.</p><br/><p>He understood the difficulty in all of these. Even with that peerless inheritance of Unkillable Indestructible, the grand path of the energy grid line chains was still an extremely tough one to partake in.</p><br/><p>But looking at the massive amount of energy grid line chains in that vortex right now, how could he not be shocked at it?!</p><br/><p>Suddenly, the entire Glory Sect shook.</p><br/><p>Looking in the distance, Grandmaster Yan\u2019s face was solemn as well.</p><br/><p>\"Grandmaster, look at that\u2026!\" Senior Elder Wuya exclaimed in astonishment. The black vortex that was gathered above Nameless Peak was giving him a repressed feeling.</p><br/><p>This was the suppression of absolute power.</p><br/><p>\"That lad is getting more terrifying than ever. That simply isn\u2019t human at all!\" A deep shock could be seen through Senior Elder Wuya\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>All the other Senior Elders nodded their heads in agreement. But at the same time, they were heartened. After all, this lad was a disciple of Glory Sect. The stronger he was, the better for them.</p><br/><p>\"I\u2019ve never ever once looked at him as a human.\" Grandmaster Yan lamented, \"How else could anyone gather this number of energy grid line chains? Look at us. How many have we gathered over a hundred years?\"</p><br/><p>Hearing this, all the other Senior Elders nodded helplessly. Comparisons would definitely just serve to kill them. It was most appropriate to say that this lad wasn\u2019t human at all.</p><br/><p>Within the house\u2026</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. His smile was more radiant than ever.</p><br/><p>\"Holy sh*t. This system is indeed getting sicker and sicker!\" Lin Fan remarked. To think that he would gather this many energy grid line chains just by sleeping for one year. If he had slept for eighteen years, wouldn\u2019t he be out of this world right now?!</p><br/><p>\"All of you, come over.\" Lin Fan curled his finger as the void trembled violently. One by one, those wild energy grid line chains turned extremely obedient and gentle, swimming around Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>\"438 energy grid line chains?! How the hell should I handle them?\"</p><br/><p>After contemplating for a moment, Lin Fan decided.</p><br/><p>He would fuse them into his body to strengthen his physical body to an extreme point.</p><br/><p>The Eternal Arm only had a mere 100 energy grid line chains, yet its powers were impossible to deny. In fact, it was practically an invincible existence.</p><br/><p>\u2018100 energy grid line chains fuse to left arm.\u2019</p><br/><p>As he curled his finger, the energy grid line chains swimming around Lin Fan surged towards Lin Fan\u2019s left arm as though they had found a home.</p><br/><p>Coiling around one by one, they entered Lin Fan\u2019s arm.</p><br/><p>\"Feels alright\u2026\" Stretching out his left arm, he drew a line gently in the void, causing a gap to tear open instantly.</p><br/><p>\u2018Fuse to left leg.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Fuse to right leg.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Fuse to body.\u2019</p><br/><p>Every single part of his body had now been fused with 100 energy grid line chains. With the remaining 38 chains, Lin Fan thought of the Eternal Donger. Should he strengthen his own donger? But that was just a thought. If he had to use that portion of his to attack someone, he might as well kill himself.</p><br/><p>\u2018Fuse to brain.\u2019</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Lin Fan\u2019s body was wrapped around by the energy grid line chains. The countless energy grid line chains flew orderly to all parts of his body.</p><br/><p>At the same time, the black vortex in the skies began to disappear gradually.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan sat down cross-legged, closing his eyes and slowly sensing the changes in his body. 438 energy grid line chains had fused with all parts of his body. Each of these parts were filled with incredible power.</p><br/><p>In fact, Lin Fan could not help but think that if he didn\u2019t control his power while using True Origin Crushing Kick on an enemy, he would definitely smite the opponent to dust immediately. That didn\u2019t seem like an impossible scenario at all.</p><br/><p>\u2018If that\u2019s the case, then I might be able to just stand a chance against the onslaught of the Beast Spirit World.\u2019 Lin Fan had a lot of things on his mind right now.</p><br/><p>Beast Spirit World. Heaven\u2019s Will. All of these unknown things were filling his mind with doubts. He had an inexplicable feeling that it wouldn\u2019t be long before all of these things would arrive at Dongling Continent.</p><br/><p>But, Lin Fan wasn\u2019t afraid. Now that he had fused with 438 energy grid line chains, wouldn\u2019t he be wasting his year of sleep if he didn\u2019t crush all these enemies?</p><br/><p>The pressing matter on Lin Fan\u2019s mind right now was how to grow this Mythical Parasol Tree completely.</p><br/><p>The Mythical Parasol Tree had successfully evolved into a seedling with Chicky\u2019s Nirvana. But due to the battle with the big ancient demon, which had caused it to expend way too much lifeforce, its development had been stunted. In fact, it still hadn\u2019t fully healed up even after an entire year.</p><br/><p>Perhaps, it was time for him to make a trip to the Manhuang Land to check out if there was any way to salvage this.</p><br/><p>The girl who had passed him the Mythical Parasol Tree, Huang Linger, had seen this coming. The look in her eyes when she handed him the Mythical Parasol Tree was clear as day.</p><br/><p>Night and day exchanged places.</p><br/><p>Next day\u2026</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>Everyone on Nameless Peak was extremely joyous. This was because the Master they had long thought of to be dead has revived.</p><br/><p>\"Master, there\u2019s still one last dish! It\u2019ll be here in a jiffy!\" Feng Bujue shouted out from the kitchen. Lin Fan was pretty stunned right now. Since when had Feng Bujue turned into a cook?!</p><br/><p>\"Ergou, what\u2019s up with this guy?\" Lin Fan asked.</p><br/><p>\"Master, what?\" Chomping down on the dishes, Zhang Ergou looked at his Master in bewilderment, not knowing what he was referring to.</p><br/><p>\"I\u2019m asking you how does he know cooking now?\" After picking up some of the food, he found that the taste was pretty decent when it entered his tummy. If he had not witnessed this for himself, he would not have believed this.</p><br/><p>\"Junior Brother is really skilled in cooking! Ever since you passed away, everyone had been in a really bad mood. Hence, he started picking up cooking. Everything else aside, his skills are really nothing short of superb. The thing we look forward most to daily other than cultivating is definitely mealtime.\" Zhang Ergou replied with a look of happiness.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan did not reply, but accepted the fact silently in his heart.</p><br/><p>As for Gong Bingye, he too did not know what to do with her. However, he noticed that she didn\u2019t seem to be harboring any plans or intentions, so he just let her be.</p><br/><p>After all, he had two little disciples here right now. There would be some things he would require Gong Bingye to teach them in the future. Otherwise, a man such as himself would find it difficult to raise up those issues.</p><br/><p>\"Master, when are you bringing your wife back?\" Munching on her meal, Cai Zhiqiao turned to Lin Fan with her big, innocent eyes.</p><br/><p>\"Eh?\" Lin Fan was stunned. Before he could even recover, a single person entered his mind.</p><br/><p>Xuan Yunxian.</p><br/><p>\"That\u2019s right, Master! In the year you\u2019ve been dead, she has always come by every single month. Each time, she would linger for a pretty long period of time. I don\u2019t think she even knows that you\u2019re revived as of now.\" Zhang Ergou continued.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan fell into deep thought immediately. That was right! His revival was only known to Glory Sect right now. She probably had no idea.</p><br/><p>\"Let\u2019s just eat first.\" Lin Fan waved his hand dismissively, shaking off the topic. Seemed like he would have to make a trip there eventually.</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>Translator's Thoughts</p><br/><p>Lam Lam</p><br/><p>Seems like this chapter is just to prepare us and catch us up to speed with everyone else. Honestly, this novel is still pretty hyped imo. And I think the time skip just makes it even better for me. *One Piece, Naruto, Bleach blah blah hahaha* (Although I would like to say that One Piece is the best manga ever made. Cheers to all who agrees HAHA!)</p><br/><p>Author\u2019s notes: \u2018The content would be more peaceful in the coming few chapters. After all, all hell is about to break loose soon.\u2019</p><br/><p>I suspect we\u2019ll be in for quite a few more 0 to 180 degree turns and the novel might never go back to our innocent, loving jokes :(</p><br/><p>Then again, cant wait for Cangling Continent arc!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

The quietness was to the point where it actually got somewhat scary. But at this moment, there was one person in the darkness creeping about the houses of various outer sect disciples.</p><br/><p>After all, since Lin Fan couldn\u2019t find a way to level up in the outer sect, he decided to put all his efforts on his professions skill. Lin Fan was rather stubborn, his blacksmith profession was already level four, yet he still couldn\u2019t make a single decent item. This made Lin Fan quite dissatisfied.</p><br/><p>In between all the houses of the outer sect disciples was a small channel, and these channels were Lin Fan\u2019s hiding spot. When Lin Fan went about looking for targets, he didn\u2019t just look around randomly. Instead, he would go about looking for disciples that had already turned the lights off and gone to sleep.</p><br/><p>At this point, Lin Fan successfully found a target and prepared to attack. Lin Fan then took a brick from an area of the wall that was already loose, and tossed it into the furnace and began forging.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026 congratulations on crafting broken tile piece, experience + 1.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Today\u2019s first shot was unsuccessfully fired. Lin Fan gave a small cackle, \u2018Mocking me? I see. Then, I will see how long you can keep this up. I dare you to keep giving me trash.</p><br/><p>Without another word Lin Fan began his hard work; picking up a brick, tossing it into the furnace.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026 congratulations on crafting a pile of useless clay, experience + 1.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026 congratulations on crafting broken tile piece, experience + 1.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026 congratulations on crafting broken tile piece, experience + 1.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>With the passage of time, Lin fan's heart was about to explode.</p><br/><p>\u2018Are you serious? Can\u2019t you just give me a somewhat decent item already?\u2019 Lin Fan felt flushed, his eyes flashing as he muttered about. At this time as Lin Fan was focusing on his path to forging, inside a separate house, Fang Han lied on his bed without a single breath.</p><br/><p>Fang Han obtained the Devil Emperor\u2019s heritage, so his starting point was higher than anyone else. His cultivation method was also of course seemingly peerless.</p><br/><p>What Fang Han was currently cultivating was the Devil Emperor\u2019s exclusive martial skill \u300aDemon Dimension\u300b. Just slightly cultivating this martial skill could allow him to open a monstrous demon realm, where he could then gather demon energy and at the same time summon numerous kinds of powerful demons.</p><br/><p>But now, Fang Han was at the most crucial moment, sealing himself away and cultivating the Demon Dimension\u2019s seed, unable to sense anything that was going on outside. Even if there were a person causing a ruckus next to him, he still wouldn\u2019t be able to sense it.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Currently, Lin Fan\u2019s expression was becoming more and more livid. An entire wall of bricks had already been thrown into the furnace.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026 congratulations on crafting broken tile piece, experience + 1.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026 congratulations blacksmith leveled up, rank + 1.\u2019</p><br/><p>Lin Fan, whose heart was about to collapse, after hearing the level up notification suddenly smiled. The blacksmith skill was already level five, it couldn\u2019t possibly still give trash, right?</p><br/><p>Lin Fan stopped and rubbed his hands, his good fortune was coming. The shot of a level five, it definitely would succeed. Lin Fan then picked up a piece of brick and tossed it into the furnace.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome now, my little companion.\u201d Lin Fan\u2019s insides screamed, his eyes bright, awaiting for his legendary weapon to appear.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026 congratulations on crafting slightly broken tile piece, experience + 1.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck......\u201d Lin Fan, who was originally full of expectations, suddenly felt like sh*t as his expression changed and a desire to just die emerged. \u2018The blacksmith skill is already level five, can\u2019t you at least give me a little bit of hope? Do you really have to fight me to the death?\u2019 Lin Fan went crazy at this moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, I refuse to believe that you won\u2019t give me a legendary weapon.\u201d Lin Fan\u2019s heart roared. Not caring about anything anymore, he started tossing brick after brick into the furnace</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026 congratulations on crafting slightly broken tile piece, experience + 1.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026 congratulations on crafting a slightly better pile of useless clay, experience + 1.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026 congratulations on crafting slightly better tile piece, experience + 1.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Lin Fan\u2019s vision was completely lost with only bricks within his eyes. Wherever the bricks were, Lin Fan\u2019s pair of demon hands would also be there. After an unknown amount of time, as the sky became a little lighter, Lin Fan could be seen gasping for breath.</p><br/><p>In a single night, his blacksmith level had gone up three levels. The bricks he crafted ranged into the thousands, but this detestable profession, in the end, didn\u2019t give him a single useful weapon.</p><br/><p>If it weren't broken tile pieces, it would instead be piles of clay.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan wiped away the sweat from his brow, \u2018Alright then, since you want to play, Yours Truly will play with you to the death. I refuse to believe my luck is this bad.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cOh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, Lin Fan gasped, \u2018Isn\u2019t that junior brother Fang? Just why is junior brother Fang sleeping outside?\u2019</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was enraged, \u2018What bastard could be this cruel and force junior brother Fang to sleep outside? As his senior brother, I must investigate. I can\u2019t let my junior brother suffer this injustice after all.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cJunior brother Fang, wake up.\u201d without another thought, Lin Fan ran forth and started slapping Fang Han\u2019s face. But Fang Han didn\u2019t even move the slightest as if he were dead. And just when Lin Fan was about to perform his heroic deed of saving his junior brother, he suddenly froze up.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t right\u2026\u201d Lin Fan was stunned, then he stood there stupidly while glancing around.</p><br/><p>\u2018This is\u2026this is\u2026\u2019 At this point, Lin Fan suddenly realized and without another word ran off as fast as he could. \u2018Damn it! Yesterday, I was too focused on my work and ended up dismantling my junior brother\u2019s house. If junior brother wakes up and sees that his house is gone, he will definitely try and fight me to the death.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018So the best choice at the moment is to immediately retreat and just act like the rest of the ignorant masses.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>After returning to his house, Lin Fan then blocked the door with his back while gasping for breath, as if he had done something bad. \u2018Looks like I need to be more careful. Dismantling a house even by accident is a rather immoral thing. For tonight\u2019s operation, I must keep my composure.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Currently in the morning...</p><br/><p>Fang Han, who was lying on his bed opened his eyes, his mouth revealing a trace of a smile.</p><br/><p>\u2018Success! The Demon Dimension\u2019s seed has been successfully cultivated, my future cultivation path will be easy now. As long as nothing happens, the future Devil Emperor will be I, Fang Han.\u2019</p><br/><p>As for the current Saint Devil sect, Fang Han didn\u2019t even consider it anything. When he became the Devil Emperor, a mere Saint Devil sect like this will also be worshiping him.</p><br/><p>\u2018Because I, Devil Emperor Fang Han, once stayed here after all.\u2019</p><br/><p>After Fang Han had adjusted his mentality, he prepared to get up and go eat at the dining hall, but at this moment Fang Han froze.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow is it so bright in my room, the air is also very fresh, huh\u2026?\u201d Fang Han gasped and immediately sat up. When he saw the scene in front of him, he was utterly dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>\u2018What the f*ck happened?\u2019</p><br/><p>Currently, multiple outer sect disciples were outside of Fang Han\u2019s house pointing curiously.</p><br/><p>Fang Han\u2019s expression turned cold, he then got dressed. \u201cDamn, who did this?\u201d Inside Fang Han\u2019s cold eyes, a raging fire burned forth. If he ever discovered who did this, he would make them pay dearly. \u2018As for those ants that are laughing at me, when I achieve my full cultivation, I will send you all into the deepest depths of hell.\u2019</p><br/>\n</div>"}

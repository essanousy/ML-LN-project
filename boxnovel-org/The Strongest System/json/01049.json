No matter how hard he tried, he could not pass through it at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cSlay!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was unconvinced as he sent forth a torrential Sword Will that had been fused with the Five Elements Sword Will. When it burst forth, a bedazzling sword flash sliced through the void and forced itself within.</p><br/><p>Creak!</p><br/><p>Indeed, it ended up being useful.</p><br/><p>Right now, Lin Fan\u2019s strength was nothing to be underestimated. This was especially the case after he had just slain two Ancestor Immortal state lower level beings, which had given his strength yet another boost. For someone like Lin Fan who could have already crossed through cultivation levels to kill powerful beings, he could even slay Ancestor Immortal state beings at this point.</p><br/><p>However, something that stunned Lin Fan happened at this moment. When the void up ahead was sliced open, a God Mountain appeared and blocked his path ahead!</p><br/><p>For a God Mountain to appear up in the void, what kind of insane bullsh*t was this?</p><br/><p>The God Mountain was humongous, and had a sharp peak. There was even a godly gleam of light that shone and revolved around it in the void. On the peak of the God Mountain stood a solitary figure.</p><br/><p>That figure looked extremely young; one could even say that he was elegant and suave, with an extraordinarily handsome face. However, his dressing style was simple and plain.</p><br/><p>If there was a spirit in a mountain, he must be an immortal.</p><br/><p>The Vice Grandmaster was fused into the God Mountain. It was as though he was the was the immortal right within this God Mountain.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to run anymore. You will never be able to escape. If you had stopped in your tracks just now, perhaps I could have just let things be\u2026You should have never, ever killed the two of them.\u201d The Vice Grandmaster, Tian Fengling, spoke out calmly.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan\u2019s brows furrowed, \u201cHmph! They wanted to kill me and yet I\u2019m not allowed to kill them? However, I\u2019m finally seeing through you guys. Your Kunlun God Sect is truly so darned shameless. To think that you guys would be as petty as this. All I did was take down your Kunlun God Sect in the competition, and yet you guys have the guts to send people to reap the life of Yours Truly? If this was made known to the outside world, everyone would definitely laugh their jaws off!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSpeaking anymore serves no purpose.\u201d Even though the voice of Tian Fengling was calm, the wrath in his eyes was endless. While this was only an Essence Spirit, the aura emanated from it was absolutely apocalyptic, shaking the entire world.</p><br/><p>As he pointed out with his finger, countless boulders swiveled out of that God Mountain. Even though these boulders only gave off a faint glow, they were filled with life!</p><br/><p>Lin Fan\u2019s heart skipped a beat. He wasn\u2019t careless at all as he punched out with his fist while his body transformed.</p><br/><p>Doomsday!</p><br/><p>An exclamation rang out, as though Tian Fengling had not expected Lin Fan to possess such strength. His killing intent then surged up; a disciple as such could not be allowed to live.</p><br/><p>\u201cSuppress!\u201d</p><br/><p>An illusory figure of a mountain enveloped Lin Fan within as a mysterious aura descended from the skies and restrained him within it. This was apparently a sealing mystic skill.</p><br/><p>\u201cSplitting Heaven Three Stances!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan\u2019s wrist flicked as the Eternal Axe in his hands started dancing. Cleaving out in the form of three axe shadows, they subsequently fused into one and slashed outward.</p><br/><p>BOOM!</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph! Wanna suppress Yours Truly? You\u2019re far from worthy!\u201d Lin Fan yelled out. At the same time, he was busy trying to figure out what he should do in his mind.</p><br/><p>Even though this was only the descent of an Essence Spirit, the strength associated with it was something that Lin Fan could not deal with as of now.</p><br/><p>This fella had surpassed the Ancestor Immortal state. Within every single move of his was the power of Heaven and Earth.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan could only break through the opponent\u2019s Dao with brute force right now. But, it was hard to say whether the enemy had already been giving it his all or not.</p><br/><p>On the other side, Tian Fengling was feeling extremely taken aback in his heart. He had not expected the strength of this disciple to be formidable to such an extent!</p><br/><p>Every single mystic skill he used was an unparalleled mystic skill! A potential of this level was truly unmatched!</p><br/><p>He must definitely not allow a second Qin Shengjun to appear, especially not in the Heaven and Earth Sect.</p><br/><p>Over ten years ago, Qin Shengjun\u2019s cultivation state was merely at the Immemorial Ancient state, and he was still on the True Immortal Substitute Roll. But, over the past ten over years, this Qin Shengjun had surpassed everyone! Right now, his cultivation state was so profound that no one could guess at it at all.</p><br/><p>That God Essence Sect was even giving off a feeling that it was a cut above all the other major sects right now.</p><br/><p>Even though the Heaven and Earth Sect was formidable, their resources were roughly equal when compared to the Kunlun God Sect. And in terms of disciples, the Kunlun God Sect even had an edge. But, out of nowhere, the appearance of this one Lin Fan had the Kunlun God Sect feeling some pressure.</p><br/><p>They got to know that this disciple had only joined the Heaven and Earth Sect three years ago. But to think that he would possess such a cultivation state already! What sort of tyranny and horror was that?</p><br/><p>He must not be kept alive! Definitely not!</p><br/><p>\u201cKunlun God Mountain! Suppress for all eternity!\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, Tian Fengling roared out as he burst forth with all his powers. As a result, a tremendous amount of energy erupted from his body and turned into a tangible river that circulated around the entire Heaven and Earth, causing a bedazzling gleam of light to shine down upon the world.</p><br/><p>The pressure in Lin Fan\u2019s heart mounted even higher. To think that this Tian Fengling would have even more tricks up his sleeves!</p><br/><p>BOOM!</p><br/><p>BOOM!</p><br/><p>The God Mountain that was blocking the path ahead started quaking before uprooting itself and flying out to suppress Lin Fan directly.</p><br/><p>The ten fingers of Tian Fengling moved as a series of mysterious runes flew out of his palms and entered the God Mountain. The void cracked and exploded as the boundlessly huge God Mountain gave off a feeling of being absolutely unstoppable.</p><br/><p>No matter where Lin Fan went to, he was within the region of control of the God Mountain.</p><br/><p>\u2018Holy f*ck!\u2019</p><br/><p>Lin Fan cussed out in his heart. He had not expected this Tian Fengling to be this vicious!</p><br/><p>This Endless Mainland was truly so darned dangerous, and all the upper echelons of the sects were so darned shameless!</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll fight it out!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan roared out, and with both his palms supporting the Heavens, he pushed them over to the God Mountain.</p><br/><p>BOOM!</p><br/><p>A boundless power shot over with such might that Lin Fan\u2019s hands were actually trembling, with signs of tearing and breaking!</p><br/><p>This was really playing it big now!</p><br/><p>Even though this was only a single strain of Tian Fengling\u2019s Essence Spirit, the strength he possessed was definitely not something that Lin Fan could handle right now.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll f*ck your mother! You had better just f*cking wait and see! If Your Daddy doesn\u2019t whack the sh*t out of you in the future, Your Daddy will take on your surname!\u201d Lin Fan hollered in rage.</p><br/><p>BOOM!</p><br/><p>The God Mountain slammed down, suppressing all living things.</p><br/><p>Seeing the scene, Tian Fengling\u2019s lips curled into a cold grin. As he swept his robes, the appearance of the God Mountain transformed and gradually took on the shape of a normal mountain peak. No matter who it was, they would definitely not be able to tell the difference between this and the God Mountain from before.</p><br/><p>Even though Tian Fengling really wanted to kill Lin Fan, he considered the fact that the latter was a Grandmaster Candidate of the Heaven and Earth Sect. If he were to kill this fella, he might very well incur the wrath and vengeance of Han Juntian.</p><br/><p>Even though they weren\u2019t exactly afraid of a single Han Juntian, they knew how sinister and vicious he was back before he took on the position as the Grandmaster of the Heaven and Earth Sect.</p><br/><p>He believed that if Han Juntian were to take revenge, he would definitely not head straight for the Kunlun God Sect. He would just camp outside the Kunlun God Sect and kill every single disciple who went out.</p><br/><p>At the same time, he would most probably slay every single last Grandmaster Candidate of the Kunlun God Sect as well.</p><br/><p>By that time, things would be really troublesome.</p><br/><p>Right now, Tian Fengling was only going to suppress Lin Fan here and isolate him from the outside world. The latter wouldn\u2019t be able to transmit his consciousness, neither would there be even a single bit of Spirit Qi for him to absorb. He would just trap this guy here for a hundred years, or maybe even a thousand.</p><br/><p>Perhaps, he would be totally wasted by that time.</p><br/><p>After taking a last glance at this God Mountain, Tian Fengling\u2019s Essence Spirit returned to him after dissipating into the void.</p><br/><p>Under the God Mountain at this time, Lin Fan was cursing out at that guy\u2019s mother.</p><br/><p>\u201cMOTHERF*CKING PIECE OF F*CKING DOG SH*T!\u201d Lin Fan could feel as though he was being shackled and couldn\u2019t budge even a single inch.</p><br/><p>\u2018This is f*cking bad now.\u2019</p><br/>\n</div>"}

While it was considered standard, there was a lot of land within its boundary with extensive resources.</p><br/><p>Within Heaven Mountain City was a tall mountain. Many structures were built on this tall mountain. Most of them were grand in sight. This was the place where the rich and famous lived.</p><br/><p>The rest of the commoners were scattered down the base of the mountain. This was the exact reason for the name of the place, Heaven Mountain City.</p><br/><p>\"Xiaoliu, do you remember where your house was?\" Floating in the endless void, Lin Fan looked down at this unique landscape curiously. Even though he had not gone down personally, with his current strength, he could take in the entire place thoroughly through his senses.</p><br/><p>It was evident that the ruler of the Heaven Mountain City was at the peak of the mountain below.</p><br/><p>With luck coiling all around and an auspicious purple cloud along with it, that was the most decent place in the area.</p><br/><p>In the eyes of commoners, this should be a pretty formidable character.</p><br/><p>But to Lin Fan, he was only so-so.</p><br/><p>Taking Xiaoliu as an example, his luck was immensely high right now compared to the low level it was before. And the reason for that was because he met a benefactor of his life who could change his fate.</p><br/><p>That was none other than Yours Truly.</p><br/><p>\"It's been a long time since I've returned. Even though there have been some changes, I suppose that it should still be down there at the foot of the mountain.\" Wang Xiaoliu's face was eager and anxious. He couldn't wait to catch the sight of his family.</p><br/><p>Looking at Wang Xiaoliu, a sense of enlightenment overwhelmed Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Men of humble backgrounds had wishes and desires.</p><br/><p>From this day forth, he should really refrain from killing too much. But of course, if they were enemies, there was no excuse. One palm to take them down as always.</p><br/><p>\"Alright, let's go down and take a look then\u2026\" Grabbing hold of Wang Xiaoliu, Lin Fan jumped out of the void and headed in the direction which Xiaoliu mentioned.</p><br/><p>With Lin Fan's current strength, no one could notice him at all. Therefore, even those so-called powerful beings on the mountain peak did not even realize Lin Fan's arrival.</p><br/><p>They landed\u2026</p><br/><p>Wang Xiaoliu got pretty emotional, and at the same time, there was a look of disbelief.</p><br/><p>\"Big bro, I remember this place! Back when I left my hometown, this was the path that I had taken!\"' Wang Xiaoliu commented excitedly.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded his head silently. That had better be the case. Hopefully, his hopes and dreams would not end up being empty.</p><br/><p>The moment Lin Fan and Wang Xiaoliu landed on the ground, they naturally attracted the attention of commoners. However, these people refrained from communicating with them. Instead, they went into hushed whispers.</p><br/><p>They didn't know who these people were.</p><br/><p>Wang Xiaoliu had already left his hometown for a good 4-5 years. Therefore, he wasn't recognized by anyone naturally.</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>Just then, Lin Fan and Wang Xiaoliu stopped in their tracks. There was a group of children who were bullying a single kid up ahead.</p><br/><p>\"You're a b*stard child! You don't even have a father!\"</p><br/><p>\"That's right! Your mum's even working at my place as a maid! If you dare to get me riled up, I'll ask my father to fire her!\"</p><br/><p>\"The next time you see us you better give us some respect! Otherwise, I'll have you looking for your teeth all over the floor!\"</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>\"Big bro, what's wrong?\" Wang Xiaoliu wondered why his big bro had stopped walking.</p><br/><p>\"Nothing much, just taking a look.\" Looking at the kid who was being bullied, Lin Fan's lips curled into a smile.</p><br/><p>\"Big bro, these are common stuff after all. Back when I was a kid, I was often bullied as well, and would always return with a bruised face.\" Looking at the bunch of children, Wang Xiaoliu chuckled.</p><br/><p>\"Alright, let's go\u2026\" Looking at the bunch of children scatter, Lin Fan chuckled. \"Xiaoliu, you must make sure you raise your kid up well and not let him get bullied often.\"</p><br/><p>\"Naturally, big bro! Don't worry! I'll definitely have my kid be the king of kids! But right now, I don't even know if they're around.\" Wang Xiaoliu's heart was thumping furiously. His face was fraught with worries as well.</p><br/><p>After all, he had already left the place for 4-5 years. Back then, there was only an aging mother and his wife back home. In those past years, he hadn't even come back once. He didn't know if his mother had passed away or whether his wife had remarried.</p><br/><p>Along the way back, Wang Xiaoliu had already made mental preparations. No matter the outcome, he would bear it all within his heart.</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>As they walked, the number of people that followed behind Lin Fan and Wang Xiaoliu increased. To these curious people, they were naturally wondering what these two were here for.</p><br/><p>\"Big bro! Take a look! That's my place!\" Wang Xiaoliu pointed to a house in front excitedly.</p><br/><p>Raising his head, Lin Fan let out a long sigh. This place was pretty big indeed with a large garden yard. However, it was a little derelict.</p><br/><p>At the same time, the plaque at the front of the house was a pretty worn out.</p><br/><p>'Wang's Residences.'</p><br/><p>Seemed like Wang Xiaoliu was right. This used to be a pretty prosperous household in the past. But it had since fallen. No wonder Wang Xiaoliu would leave his house to seek out a sect. He was probably hoping to regain his house's glory one day.</p><br/><p>\"What's wrong? You're not heading in?\" Wang Xiaoliu was touching the wooden doors with his hands trembling. Looking at his actions, Lin Fan smiled and asked.</p><br/><p>\"Big bro, I-I'm nervous.\" Wang Xiaoliu said a little unnaturally.</p><br/><p>\"What are you afraid of...?\" Lin Fan pushed gently and nudged Wang Xiaoliu through.</p><br/><p>Everything within looked like how he had left it to be, except that they were more tattered and worn out.</p><br/><p>Within the courtyard\u2026</p><br/><p>A young woman was pulling onto a young child. At the same time, she was applying some sort of medicinal oil on the young child while chiding about something.</p><br/><p>This young lady looked to be in her twenties. However, perhaps it was the toll of labor on her body that she looked considerably aged than she should be.</p><br/><p>The moment Wang Xiaoliu stepped in\u2026</p><br/><p>The young woman and her child looked at the door squarely. At the same time, the young child took up a wooden stick and glared at Wang Xiaoliu cautiously, protecting his mother in front.</p><br/><p>Silent.</p><br/><p>Unusually silent.</p><br/><p>There were no words.</p><br/><p>Looking at this young woman, it was as though Wang Xiaoliu was completely stumped. Without saying anything, Lin Fan stepped out quietly. Closing the door, he stood in front of the door.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, a massive aura erupted out from within him.</p><br/><p>There was one last thing he needed to do.</p><br/><p>He needed to fulfill that promise back then.</p><br/><p>\"If the day comes where I rule over this world and you're still alive, I'll definitely make sure you rise and lead a life of glory.\"</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>The residence was filled with cries. At the same time, an elderly voice came along, followed by more weeping.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan let out a smile. This was indeed the perfect ending.</p><br/><p>At the point where he noticed the kid earlier on, he had already known that that was Wang Xiaoliu's child. After all, there was a mysterious connection within one's bloodlines that were connected. While ordinary people might not be able to tell, Lin Fan could.</p><br/><p>Time passed by the second and minute.</p><br/><p>The doors of the Wang Residences opened up.</p><br/><p>The family of four walked out. Wang Xiaoliu had used the time to explain his circumstances over the past few years to his family. Knowing that Wang Xiaoliu's big bro was still waiting for him outside, his mother and wife hurried out to welcome him.</p><br/><p>As for Wang Xiaoliu, they would naturally deal with him later on.</p><br/><p>However, the moment they opened their doors, they were dumbstruck.</p><br/><p>The ruler of Heaven Mountain City had arrived. At the same time, all the leaders of the great families of Heaven Mountain City had all arrived. All of them were waiting right outside their doorsteps.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan turned around. Looking at Wang Xiaoliu, whose face was all puffy and swollen from crying, Lin Fan chuckled. At the same time, looking at the elderly woman beside him, Lin Fan cupped his fists together and greeted.</p><br/><p>\"Elder, I've sent Xiaoliu back home. He'll never leave his home like that ever again.\" Lin Fan smiled.</p><br/><p>\"Good\u2026good\u2026\" The elderly woman was befuddled as her speech stuttered.</p><br/><p>\"Xiaoliu, this is your son? What's his name?\" Lin Fan asked.</p><br/><p>\"Big bro, he's called Xiao Ming! Son, hurry and call Uncle!\" Wang Xiaoliu was almost brought to tears. He had not expected his son to be so big after coming back home.</p><br/><p>And this was definitely his son for sure!</p><br/><p>The five-year-old Xiao Ming looked at Lin Fan nervously. He then called out anxiously, \"U-uncle!\"</p><br/><p>The moment Wang Xiaoming said those words, that empty luck that was floating above his head immediately skyrocketed and pierced through the Heavens.</p><br/><p>\"Good kid, good kid.\" Lin Fan patted his head and smiled.</p><br/><p>\"Sir, may I know who you are?\" The ruler of Heaven Mountain City took a look at Lin Fan, his heart thumping furiously.</p><br/><p>All of them had felt the burst of aura just now. It was so strong that they didn't even have a single bit of resistance.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at everyone from Heaven Mountain City present and addressed them, \"It doesn't matter who I am. All you need to know is that, if anyone from the Wang Residences suffers even a single bit of harm from this day forth, none of you shall exist any longer.\"</p><br/><p>Everyone from Heaven Mountain City were shocked. Some of them were the leaders of great families in the city! Since when had they ever been threatened as such?</p><br/><p>\"Sir! Aren't you being a little too overbearing?!\" The ruler of Heaven Mountain City was enraged.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan ignored them completely and called up to the Heavens, \"Heaven's Will, come out\u2026!\"</p><br/><p>BOOM!</p><br/><p>Instantly, the void rumbled as a tremendous aura appeared up in the skies.</p><br/><p>Now that the Heaven's Will had been completely trained up by Lin Fan, he was more obedient than anyone else. Upon hearing Lin Fan's voice, how could he not obey this call?</p><br/><p>\"Heaven's Will!?\" Everyone from Heaven Mountain City was stunned this scene. They had not seen the Heaven's Will before. But this aura was simply way too formidable!</p><br/><p>Vast, boundless. No one could even fight this at all!</p><br/><p>\"From this day forth, you shall take care of everyone in this Wang Family. If anyone, ANYONE, dares to be insolent to them\u2026 Kill.\" Lin Fan's voice was calm.</p><br/><p>\"Yes\u2026\" Heaven's Will nodded his head gently. Raising his fingers gently, two thunderbolts shot down from the Heavens, changing along the way. They landed down and formed 2 Qilin Stone Lions that stood on each side of the entrance of the Wang Residences.</p><br/><p>\"These are the Heaven's Will's protection, and will be able to guard against any offense.\" Heaven's Will continued.</p><br/><p>\"Good.\" Lin Fan nodded his head, entirely disregarding all the shocked faces of everyone from Heaven Mountain City. He then turned to Wang Xiaoliu, \"Xiaoliu, it's time for me to go. Fight on and take care from here on forth.\"</p><br/><p>\"Big bro...\" Looking at Lin Fan, Wang Xiaoliu was almost touched to tears.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan patted his shoulders, \"We'll meet again if we have affinity in the future.\"</p><br/><p>Now that there was the protection of the Heaven's Will, no one in this world should be able to threaten Wang Xiaoliu. His promise had not gone empty.</p><br/><p>After giving them such a great starting opportunity, if the Wang Family still didn't rise to prosperity in the next 100 years or so, then there would truly be nothing that Lin Fan could do.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan then drew out a gap in the void and disappeared within.</p><br/><p>He left behind a bunch of people who stood there, dazed at all that had happened.</p><br/><p>...</p><br/>\n</div>"}

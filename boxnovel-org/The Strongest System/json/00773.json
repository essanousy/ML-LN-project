For some unknown reason, he had a really bad feeling about this.</p><br/><p>\"Shut up, unfilial son!\"</p><br/><p>Wang Xiaoliu roared out. He then came before Lin Fan with a face full of reproach, \"Big brother, everything that this small brother has right now was all given to me by you, big brother! Yet, I ended up bringing up such an unfilial son! It's all my fault, big brother!\"</p><br/><p>The delegates of the Wang Family had been listening intently. When they heard these words coming out of the Wang Family Head, everyone felt their hearts rattling.</p><br/><p>\"Everything that the Wang Family has was given to them by this man? Could this man be\u2026?\"</p><br/><p>All of a sudden, everyone present felt as though their minds could not come to terms with everything that was happening right now.</p><br/><p>The rise of the Wang Family was really mysterious. However, the backing behind them was even more mysterious. It was even rumored that they had the blessings of the Heaven's Will itself.</p><br/><p>However, these delegates of the Wang Family knew that the rumors were all true. The Wang Family DID have the blessings of the Heaven's Will.</p><br/><p>Not only that, they had even heard the Wang Family Head mention that it was his big brother that had allowed the Heaven's Will to bless the Wang Family. A man who could command the Heaven's Will, what sort of an existence was that?</p><br/><p>At this moment, no one present dared to imagine any further. They felt as though everything that they were witnessing this day was way too explosive.</p><br/><p>\"Xiaoliu, what nonsense are you spouting? You are my small brother. Everything that you do shall be covered by me. Even if you were to cause the entire world to topple over, could I, Lin Fan, have my small brother bear the burden himself?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved his hands, unbothered about everything that had happened.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, when he discovered that Xiaoming was the Eternally Hated Body of the Destined Child, he couldn't feel any bit of anger anymore.</p><br/><p>An even larger plan was looming over the mind of Lin Fan. He had to plan this out properly.</p><br/><p>Looking at everything before her, Qin Yue'er's face changed. She had not expected this fella to be in cahoots with the Wang Family! Against the face of this absolute power, she did not have any bit of resistance left in her anymore.</p><br/><p>\"Big brother!\" Wang Xiaoliu looked at Lin Fan. For a moment, he did not know what to say anymore.</p><br/><p>\"Let this matter be. Release them.\" Lin Fan waved his hand and said.</p><br/><p>While Housekeeper Long did not know who this man was, he knew that this must be some ridiculously hell of a person if even the Family Head had to call him big brother respectfully!</p><br/><p>Without thinking twice, he let go of the captives.</p><br/><p>Old Lady Flower Stream could not help but heave out a sigh of relief at this. Thankfully, nothing went down. However, she did not know who this man before her was, neither did she know where he hailed from.</p><br/><p>But, looking at how respectful the Wang Family Head was towards him, he should naturally be far from normal.</p><br/><p>\"Uncle Lin, how can we let them off so easily? What if they were to find trouble with me again next time?\" Wang Xiaoming had not expected things to come to this, and felt a little scared after everything now.</p><br/><p>Even though there were many delegates in the Wang Family and they could protect him, who knew when this smelly b*tch might come and capture him one fine day if he were careless?</p><br/><p>\"Then that is your own business. Since you created this mess, you have to settle it yourself.\" Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>\"AHHHHH\u2026!!!\" Wang Xiaoming had wanted to say something more. But when he caught sight of the expression on his father's face, he was startled and shut his mouth obediently.</p><br/><p>\"Hmph!\"</p><br/><p>Qin Yue'er shot Wang Xiaoming a fierce glance. Her meaning was clear: This was not over just yet.</p><br/><p>And Lin Fan was just watching everything with delight. Right now, he had to craft out his plan step by step.</p><br/><p>The crowd then dispersed. As for Lin Fan, he made his way to Wang Xiaoliu's study room and began discussing.</p><br/><p>\"What? To think that so many things would have happened in the few years I was not here?\" Lin Fan's brows furrowed. He had not expected all of this to happen.</p><br/><p>\"That's right, big brother. There have been plenty of things going on in these five years that you weren't around.\" Wang Xiaoliu lamented.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan put out his palm and the Heaven's Will appeared in a flash. The Heaven's Will of the Xuanhuang World had long been trained up by Lin Fan. As such, it was appearing before him obediently right now.</p><br/><p>As for Wang Xiaoliu, he also felt respectful when he saw the Heaven's Will appear. After all, the Wang Family had been watched over by the Heaven's Will's blessings all these years.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the Heaven's Will and permeated him with his consciousness, looking at everything that had happened in the past few years.</p><br/><p>This one look was quite something to be honest. Lin Fan had not expected these many changes to occur after he had left. However, he could not help himself from chuckling out involuntarily.</p><br/><p>The Heaven's Will watched over the entire Xuanhuang World, and everything that happened was within the Heaven's Will's vision.</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan was done watching everything, he shook his head helplessly.</p><br/><p>Those two brats, Zhiqiao and Jiuling... They were way too immature. As for Zhang Ergou, Mie Qiongqi, Chicky, Feng Bujue and Tian Yu, how could they not know better and add on to the ruckus of the girls?</p><br/><p>\"Heaven's Will, did you not interfere with these affairs?\" Lin Fan asked.</p><br/><p>The Heaven's Will looked over at Lin Fan before shaking his head and said with an exasperated face, \"I couldn't do anything about it.\"</p><br/><p>The moment Lin Fan heard this, he did not know what to say for a moment or so. This Heaven's Will really knew when the right time to shrug off responsibilities was.</p><br/><p>However, he was right as well. These people had a really intimate relationship with Lin Fan. Even if he wanted to meddle in their affairs, he couldn't.</p><br/><p>\"These two brats have really caused way too much trouble. When I find them, I'm going to have to discipline them properly! Goodness, they've really caused one hell of a huge mess out of this fine Xuanhuang World.\"</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan caught sight of everything, he was caught in a huff for a moment or so, unable to recover from it.</p><br/><p>\"Do you know how Yunxian is like now?\"</p><br/><p>Utilizing the eye of the Heaven's Will, Lin Fan checked out on Yunxian's location and how she was doing recently.</p><br/><p>Xuanjian Sect\u2026</p><br/><p>Xuan Yunxian had long taken on the role of the Grandmaster of the Xuanjian Sect. During the day, she would be busy with the affairs of the sect. When night came, she would raise her head and look up into the stars, as though she was waiting for something.</p><br/><p>In a single thought, five years had passed just like that. And Yunxian had been like that for the whole five years as well. This was something that Lin Fan felt really guilty about.</p><br/><p>There were way too many people that Lin Fan was worried about.</p><br/><p>All of his students back at the school that he had once taught at, the fourteen Sand Bandits, et cetera\u2026 These were all inseparable parts of Lin Fan's past.</p><br/><p>\"Xiaoming, come on in.\" Lin Fan had sensed Xiaoming's presence at the doorsteps and invited him in.</p><br/><p>\"Uncle Lin.\" Xiaoming entered and stood before Lin Fan respectfully. He did not dare to act defiantly right now.</p><br/><p>\"Big brother, I've only got this one son of mine. And now, he doesn't even act like an adult! It really pains my heart. Please help me with this, big brother!\" Wang Xiaoliu spoke up.</p><br/><p>\"Yes, don't worry. Leave it to me.\" Lin Fan nodded his head and said.</p><br/><p>\"Father, Uncle. I am already an adult, no?\" Wang Xiaoming asked.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled out, \"From tomorrow on, you shall head out and undergo training.\"</p><br/><p>In Lin Fan's opinion, he knew that it would be impossible if he wanted to change the attitude of Xiaoming right now. However, as someone who possessed the Eternally Hated Body of the Destined Child, how could he absorb more hatred from others if he did not head out?</p><br/><p>\"Uncle Lin, I quite like it here! I don't want to go out!\" The moment Wang Xiaoming heard this, he was taken aback. What was he to do if he had to head out?</p><br/><p>He was practically the Crown Prince of the Heaven Mountain City! Whatever he wanted, he would get it. If he were to go out, wouldn't he be killed by others?</p><br/><p>\"Unfilial son, shut up! If your Uncle Lin wants you to head out, you head out! Otherwise, I'm going to break your legs!\" When it came to the ways of educating his kid, Wang Xiaoliu was obeying Lin Fan's words for sure.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan's words were the law as far as he was concerned.</p><br/><p>In Wang Xiaoliu's opinion, his big brother must definitely have confidence over this. Otherwise, he wouldn't have suggested it.</p><br/><p>\"Xiaoming, don't worry. Do you think your Uncle Lin will harm you? I've already left a single strain of my consciousness on your body. Once you get out, just do as you want and however you want to! I assure you that nothing will happen to you.\" Lin Fan chuckled out.</p><br/><p>\"Are you for real, Uncle Lin?\" The moment Wang Xiaoming heard this, he was overwhelmed with joy. The reason why he didn't want to head out was that he knew that he wasn't all that strong. If he were to brag and flaunt outside brazenly, wouldn't he be walloped into an idiot?</p><br/><p>\"Naturally.\" Lin Fan grinned back.</p><br/><p>\"Big brother, this\u2026!!!\" Wang Xiaoliu could not understand the intentions behind his big brother's actions! Lin Fan waved it off with his hands and replied with confidence, \"Don't worry. I've got this.\"</p><br/><p>Even though Wang Xiaoliu could not get it, he could only let it be at this point.</p><br/><p>As for Wang Xiaoming, this was a bloody joyous event worth celebrating! With Uncle Lin backing him, what else could he be afraid of?</p><br/><p>The Heavens and Earth might be great, but none of them were greater than the one and only Uncle Lin!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

This was completely beyond his imaginations. Back in the past, wanting to kill this lad was something that he could have done with extreme ease. Who would have thought that he would have been able to progress to such an extent by now?</p><br/><p>He had just killed the Whirlwind Master God right in front of their eyes. This was something extremely horrifying.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Lin Fan\u2019s battle intent was extremely high strung. He then looked at the three remaining Master Gods and the Boundless Future Buddha Lord. \u201cWhat other methods do you guys have? Later on, all of you will end up like the Whirlwind Master God\u2026crushed by Yours Truly into nothing but dust!\u201d</p><br/><p>He had an extremely optimistic outlook toward the current situation; it wasn\u2019t entirely impossible for him to have those three other Master Gods killed. While he might end up sustaining some slight injuries as a result, none of that would matter anymore.</p><br/><p>As for the Boundless Future Buddha Lord, that fella was still somewhat more cunning. That fella would most likely not let Lin Fan have such an easy time killing those three Master Gods. But, if he wanted to step in and stop the latter, that would also have to depend on whether he had the capabilities to do so.</p><br/><p>Void Master God.</p><br/><p>Contract Master God.</p><br/><p>Chasm Master God.</p><br/><p>The three of them stood up in the void, their eyes sparkling with a sharp glint. Right now, their hatred was torrential and burning rampantly. The death of the Whirlwind Master God had left them feeling exceptionally infuriated. If they did not have this Indigenous Being killed, they would definitely feel a deep chagrin over it.</p><br/><p>This was especially the case after that Indigenous Being had actually dared to declare that he would have them killed! In their eyes, that was nothing but a fool\u2019s dream. The Whirlwind Master God was simply way too careless earlier on to let this Indigenous Being seize the chance. However, they knew that they would absolutely not give this Indigenous Being the same chance. Under the combined forces of the four of them, there would only be a single outcome awaiting this Indigenous Being \u2014 death.</p><br/><p>\u201cBoundless Future Buddha Lord, let us join forces. No matter what, we must definitely have this Indigenous Being killed.\u201d The Contract Master God yelled out.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright!\u201d Right now, the thing that the Boundless Future Buddha Lord was the wariest about was that secretive treasure of that lad. As long as he were to watch out for that treasure and not allow himself to get set up by it, there would definitely be no issues about it.</p><br/><p>\u201cHURGH!\u201d</p><br/><p>Four pillars of aura shot up into the sky like heaven piercing pillars, penetrating through the clouds instantly.</p><br/><p>Gradually, the eyes of the Void Master God began to undergo some changes, slowly turning into void themselves. Within those eyes was a place that was like a vast universe in itself; encompassing a boundless Heaven and Earth. From time to time, it would even exude an extremely chilling aura.</p><br/><p>\u201cIndigenous Being\u2026you have already caused us to be completely incensed right now! With that, your death sentence has arrived!\u201d The Void Master God raised both of his arms. The void trembled as a mysterious aura burst forth from behind his body, causing a gigantic black hole to appear. It looked like a mighty beast which could devour the entire Heavens, swallowing everything in its path. The void around it was filled with a devastating power.</p><br/><p>At the same time, the Contract Master God raised his hands as well, bringing forth a series of mysterious contractual symbols to float out in the void. All of those symbols gave off an extremely mysterious and mystifying power. While Lin Fan could tell that those powers weren\u2019t exactly the strongest out there, he knew that all of these Master Gods were one more mystifying than the other. The mystic skills and Immortal Arts that they had were way different compared to those of the Endless Mainland; hence, he definitely had to take things seriously.</p><br/><p>The Chasm Master God was the strongest amongst them. The Power of Chasm he possessed seemed as though it was the vilest power out there, causing a series of black waves to blanket the entire world. Within it, it was nurturing the most horrifying creature that existed within the chasms, and brooding its devastating chasm aura as well.</p><br/><p>While the Boundless Future Buddha Lord did not move at all, the Future Gear revolving around his body gave off a bright, golden colored Buddhist light.</p><br/><p>Against these four powerful beings, Lin Fan heaved in a deep breath of air as he burst forth with all of his firepower. His Source of Power erupted forth like a volcano at this moment, causing his entire body to be wrapped up by streams of light that moved around as though they had a life of their own.</p><br/><p>\u201cHURGH!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan roared out as a gigantic aura started expanding out with his body as the core, causing a series of ripples to spread out in the entire world. Raising his head, those eyes of his which were filled with an unparalleled battle intent glared at the four powerful beings with a deathly stare.</p><br/><p>\u201cVery well, Contract Master God! You shall be the first one killed by Yours Truly. There\u2019s no way you\u2019re going to run!\u201d Lin Fan spoke up. This entire battle right now was going to be a fierce and hard one, but definitely exciting and intense.</p><br/><p>The Contract Master God looked over at Lin Fan while scoffing out, \u201cDream on!\u201d</p><br/><p>BAM!</p><br/><p>In a flash, Lin Fan moved out as his entire body tore through the void while he bolted toward the Contract Master God. Using his fingers like a knife, he cleaved down and sent forth a tremendously explosive Sword Will. \u201cContract Master God! What capabilities have you got?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shred!</p><br/><p>The Sword Will sliced through the void as it arrived before the Contract Master God within a single breath. Sensing the formidable power that was being exuded along with the Sword Will, the Contract Master God did not hesitate at all as he spread open his palm, bursting forth with those mysterious symbols that collided against the oncoming Sword Will.</p><br/><p>\u201cVoid Severance!\u201d</p><br/><p>Shred!</p><br/><p>A sharp light shot out of the palm of the Void Master God as he killed out at Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph! What\u2019s so great about being able to slice the void? Yours Truly will show you what fighting with brute force is!\u201d</p><br/><p>BAM!</p><br/><p>When that beam of light struck onto Lin Fan\u2019s body, a loud metallic sound reverberated across the void. In fact, sparks were even flying out from the point of impact.</p><br/><p>Splat!</p><br/><p>Lin Fan\u2019s arm was actually sliced apart slightly because of that Void Severance. However, it was just a small injury which he could heal up in a split second, leaving not even a single scar behind.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan pursed his lips in disdain. \u201cWhat\u2019s that sh*t? That dealt no damage at all.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Void Master God gasped out, \u201cThe body of this Indigenous Being is so strong! Earlier on, the Power of Whirlwind of the Whirlwind Master God could not do anything to him. And right now, to think that even my Void Severance could not slice his body apart either! This is absolutely horrifying!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Chasm Master God did not say anything. Striking forth with a palm strike, the Power of Chasm behind him gushed out like tidal waves that rumbled out furiously. Within that Power of Chasm, a series of demonic monsters howled out malevolently. These were not creatures that existed between the Heaven and Earth; they were filled with the Power of Chasm, and their strength was more formidable than normal, leaving everyone with nothing but chills running down their spines.</p><br/><p>As for the Boundless Future Buddha Lord, he was simply waiting for a chance. The speed of this lad was extremely fast, and his body was indeed strong. This was especially the case with that Heaven and Earth Sutra of his \u2014 that was something that the Boundless Future Buddha Lord himself wanted to get his hands on. To him, that wasn\u2019t something that this lad should own; that was something that belonged to Heavenly Lord Xin Feng. Only, what the Boundless Future Buddha Lord could not get was how this lad had managed to get his hands on it.</p><br/><p>What was his relationship with Heavenly Lord Xin Feng? Could he have actually managed to inherit the legacy of Heavenly Lord Xin Feng?</p><br/><p>That was the most likely possibility in the eyes of the Boundless Future Buddha Lord. In his mind, that was literally the only way that could explain this fact of him being in possession of the Heaven and Earth Sutra.</p><br/><p>As for whether or not this lad could be the reincarnation of Heavenly Lord Xin Feng, that was something entirely impossible in the eyes of the Boundless Future Buddha Lord. The reason for this was that back then, Heavenly Lord Xin Feng had already died, without even a single bit of aura left. Furthermore, Heavenly Lord Xin Feng\u2019s Source was scattered out between the entire Heaven and Earth. How could he reincarnate and cultivate once more given those circumstances?</p><br/><p>Even though he had always born a strong dislike toward Heavenly Lord Xin Feng, he could not help but acknowledge that the latter was still a true supremely powerful being. He was someone righteous and just, unlike this lad who was so despicable and shameless; vile, in fact! The treasures that he made use of were even more incredulous!</p><br/><p>Those were not stuff that ordinary people could have come up with ever.</p><br/><p>Because of those reasons, the Boundless Future Buddha Lord had long thrown away the possibility of Lin Fan being the reincarnation of Heavenly Lord Xin Feng.</p><br/><p>Looking at the masses, Lin Fan\u2019s lips curled into a grin. \u201cHmph! All of you can come at me together! I\u2019m going to count to three, and thereafter, the Contract Master God is going to die. Do you guys believe me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSeems like you guys don\u2019t. Very well then! Yours Truly shall just let you guys have an eye-opener. Even if all of you are here, there is no way you can stand in the path of Yours Truly!\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, Lin Fan bolted out for the Contract Master God.</p></div>\n</div>"}

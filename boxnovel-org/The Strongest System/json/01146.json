While their faces were compassionate, the auras that they were giving off were extremely bone chilling.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd this place is?\u201d When the Boundless Future Buddha Lord caught sight of this Buddha before him that was shrouded with an entire sky of Resentment Wills, he felt his heart skip a beat.</p><br/><p>The black robed person gave off a chuckle, \u201cThat\u2019s right. This was the place where the Buddha Ancestor himself had once imprisoned the Evil Buddha that had fallen. However, perhaps even someone like you would not have known about this place. At best, you would have only heard rumors about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Boundless Future Buddha Lord had not expected that this person would know about this place. Indeed, he himself had only heard about it, but he did not know where it was located exactly. Even those Old Masters of the Good and Evil Buddha Sect did not know about it either; that was because the only person who knew about it was none other than the Buddha Ancestor.</p><br/><p>This was a place that had imprisoned all the disciples of the Good and Evil Buddha Sect that had fallen down the path of the Evil Buddha. For hundreds of thousands, or perhaps even millions of years, there had been countless of them that had been locked in here. Some of them lost their evil thoughts of the path of the Evil Buddha and returned onto the right path. However, there were some that just veered even further till the point of no return, where they were lost completely in this place, turning into those Evil Buddhas of an endless Resentment Will.</p><br/><p>Pointing at a spot up ahead where the resentment gathered was the thickest and murkiest, the black robed person said, \u201cThere\u2026That is the place which you will want to head to.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTriple Yin Infinite Buddha Lord, Sinful Sovereignty Buddha Lord, Blood Buddha Lord, etcetera\u2026 All of those countless Buddha Lords had been imprisoned here, causing their resentment and everything about them to form a Buddha Pool. Within it lies everything that they had possessed. Perhaps you don\u2019t know this just yet, but the Buddha Ancestor has two sides to him\u2026Good and Evil. As for the Evil side of him, it is suppressed down at this place as well. You should probably understand now why I will be able to help you accomplish the Dao of the Heavenly Lord, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>When the Boundless Future Buddha Lord heard those words, he was stumped for a moment; his mind in a blur. All of those Buddha Lords that the black robed person had mentioned earlier were people that he knew about. They were all starkly renowned people back in the Good and Evil Buddha Sect. However, because they had all veered into becoming Evil Buddhas, they were suppressed by the Buddha Ancestor in this place. He hoped that he would be able to wash away the evils in them by doing that. But who knew, all they did was turn more and more evil, until they were eventually refined by the unparalleled Buddha Power, causing them to be imprisoned in this place for all eternity. With that, their unparalleled Resentment Wills surged up into the skies, gathering into a Buddha Pool which contained every single thing of theirs. Not only that, the Evil Wills of the Buddha Ancestor himself were kept there. If the Boundless Future Buddha Lord himself were to be able to control everything here, that\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2026would be\u2026unimaginable!</p><br/><p>The Buddha Heart of the Boundless Future Buddha Lord started thumping up and down as he turned his gaze over at the black robed person. \u201cWhat are you trying to achieve by telling me all this?\u201d</p><br/><p>The black robed person gave a stifled laughter, \u201cBy the time you attain the Dao of the Heavenly Lord, you will know clearly. Right now, it\u2019s better for you to not get entangled in the affairs of the Endless Mainland and just relish in the wondrous pleasures of attaining the Dao of the Heavenly Lord. Perhaps, it might not be that long before you succeed!\u201d</p><br/><p>While the face of the Boundless Future Buddha Lord was calm as usual, his heart was just rumbling and pounding with adrenaline. This was HIS encounter! If he could get control over all of this, just how strong would he be by then? How horrifying would he be?</p><br/><p>Everything\u2026Every, single, thing, was something that left one excited beyond one\u2019s wildest imaginations.</p><br/><p>Once he attained his Dao of the Heavenly Lord, there would be no one who could order him around or mess with him anymore. As for this black robed person, the only thing awaiting him would just be death as well\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cGo on then. Your encounter is awaiting you within.\u201d The black robed person then vanished into thin air. Everything that would happen later on would be the issue of the Boundless Future Buddha Lord. Whether or not he decided to step into that Buddha Pool, that would be his choice. If he did not step in, he could forsake his dreams of becoming a Heavenly Lord in this life of his. And if he did, the Heavenly Lord state would be something he could attain with ease.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>At that moment, Lin Fan\u2019s eyelid twitched. \u201cWhat the hell? Why am I getting this looming feeling of impending doom?\u201d</p><br/><p>Given his current strength, he was long able to sense danger from far away. However, he did not put it to heart \u2014 with his strength right now, what did he have to be afraid of?</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re reaching soon, right?\u201d Presently, Lin Fan was streaking through the void with the Old Master Pu Xin. They were headed in the direction of the Undead Spirit Master God and the Nightmare Master God.</p><br/><p>The result of those two Master Gods joining hands was indeed something rather frightening. To think that they could force the various major sects of the Endless Mainland to retreat helplessly without the living beings of the Moon Shadow Mainland taking even a single bit of damage.</p><br/><p>It was all because the Undead Spirit Master God was just making the disciples of the Endless Mainland fight against those Undead Spirits that he had summoned.</p><br/><p>Old Master Pu Xin looked over at the distance and could only see a thick mist that was shrouding the entire place. While it looked normal through his naked eye, he could tell the difference with his Buddha Eye \u2014 that entire place seemed as though it was weaved together by someone and was a part of a dreamscape.</p><br/><p>\u201cBenefactor, check it out. The Nightmare Master God has made his move. All of those disciples have fallen into that dreamscape. Most likely, only Immortal Kings would be able to resist that.\u201d Old Master Pu Xin remarked.</p><br/><p>Taking a single glance over, Lin Fan could tell that that was truly the case. \u201cIt\u2019s time for us to make our move then.\u201d</p><br/><p>Old Master Pu Xin nodded his head in agreement. As he closed his palms together, a bright Buddhist Light blanketed the entire world.</p><br/><p>\u201cBuddha Dream\u2019s Karma.\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly, a Sleeping Buddha appeared between the Heaven and Earth. Tilting his body, he laid down on the void while yawning out gently. Just like a heavenly thunder, a deafening sound boomed out and reverberated throughout the entire world, slamming onto the Heaven and Earth.</p><br/><p>That yawn contained the Power of the Buddha Clan, drifting throughout the entire sky.</p><br/><p>In front of them, those disciples were sunken deep in a nightmare. In their minds, it was as though a series of demons were pouncing out at them while they were holding up with a fierce resistance. Grabbing the weapons in their hands, they were charging forth against those demons.</p><br/><p>An Immortal King Old Master stood there absolutely flabbergasted. He found himself totally helpless to intervene in everything happening here right now, and could only stand by and watch with wide open eyes.</p><br/><p>At the same time, there was a strong Power of Nightmare that was bolting out at him from the void, trying to break its way into his consciousness. He had to deal with that to the best of his abilities. This was no mere fight of one\u2019s powers; it was a clash between two mental powers.</p><br/><p>Against this Power of Nightmare, that Immortal King Old Master was feeling extremely infuriated in his heart. To think that he would have to deal with such a cumbersome Master God.</p><br/><p>If this were a direct fight, he would have nothing to fear at all. But, when the other party was constantly trying to invade his consciousness, he was left with nothing but a huge headache while dealing with this.</p><br/><p>BOOM!</p><br/><p>Right at that moment, a reverberating Buddhist Voice sounded out within their hearts, purging the Power of Nightmare away from them instantaneously.</p><br/><p>Those disciples that had sunken into the nightmare jerked awake right away. But, when they caught sight of everything before them, they were stumped.</p><br/><p>They had discovered that the \u2018demons\u2019 that they had wanted to slay earlier on were actually people of their own sides!</p><br/><p>\u201cHow could this be\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking at the situation down below, Lin Fan raised a single finger. Life force started gushing out just like a stream of water that coiled and wrapped all the disciples while healing up their wounds. As long as anyone even had a single breath left, they were all healed and recovered with this life force.</p><br/><p>\u201cOld Master Green Hell, are you alright?\u201d Lin Fan asked.</p><br/><p>When Old Master Green Hell caught sight of the person who had arrived, his heart skipped with joy. \u201cI\u2019m fine! Thank goodness that you guys made it in time! The tricks that these two Master Gods have are extremely cunning! You guys would have to watch out for them as well!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled out. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. This time around, Old Master Pu Xin is here to counter those two Master Gods with specialized Immortal Arts of the Buddha Clan.\u201d</p><br/><p>Old Master Pu Xin muttered out his Buddhist Chants as the Buddhist Beads that were hanging around his neck suddenly danced into the sky. They then enlarged as the number of Buddha Beads started to increase in quantity as well.</p><br/><p>As he shook his hands furiously, that Sleeping Buddha lying down on the void turned into streams of Buddhist Lights that seeped into these Buddha Beads. With that, the Buddha Beads started to shrink down into tiny little beads that eventually scattered out and entered the bodies of the disciples out there.</p><br/><p>These were the Seeds of the Buddha Clan\u2019s Immortal Arts, and could automatically fend against the powers of the Nightmare Master God.</p><br/><p>When the two Master Gods, who were far in the distance, caught sight of this, they were astounded.</p><br/><p>The Nightmare Master God\u2019s face was filled with wrath. \u201cTo think that these Indigenous Beings could actually dispel my powers!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Undead Spirit Master God merely chuckled out and swept his robes aside. With that, a Power of Undead Spirits effused out, blanketing the entire sky with a snowy patch as countless beings started appearing\u2026</p></div>\n</div>"}

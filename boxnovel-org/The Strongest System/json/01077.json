For this disciple of the Heaven and Earth Sect to actually take down two of their Vice Grandmasters, what sort of a huge blow was that turning out to be for the Kunlun God Sect?</p><br/><p>This was especially the case given the fact that Chan Yingtian was an existence who was in possession of the Legendary Item of the Heaven and Earth, the Wheel Saint King. Now that his physical body had been destroyed, rebuilding it would be an extremely difficult task as well.</p><br/><p>Before Han Juntian had even replied, Lin Fan beat him to it, \u201cAre you bloody braindead? You\u2019re asking us if we\u2019re declaring war after how I\u2019ve walloped your Kunlun God Sect to such an extent? I think you must be a special kind of stupid!\u201d</p><br/><p>These words of Lin Fan were extremely tyrannical, albeit without anything wrong with them: tyrannical, haughty, arrogant, and cocky!</p><br/><p>\u201cYOU\u2026!\u201d Tai Qiantian\u2019s anger was burning from the depths of his heart. But just at this moment, a bright beam of light shone out from the depths of the Kunlun God Sect and stopped above his head.</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan caught sight of that figure, his heart skipped a beat. That was so darned bloody strong!</p><br/><p>This figure before him was dressed in white robes, with a handsome face and a fleeting head of white hair. In the middle of his forehead was an actual eye that was wide open! This eye was azure blue, with a sort of flowing light that swirled within, giving off an extremely chilling aura.</p><br/><p>In that instant, an extraordinary might burst forth furiously, infecting the entire Heaven and Earth. When all of the masses hidden in the void caught sight of this person, they gasped out in disbelief.</p><br/><p>\u201cOld Master of the Kunlun God Sect, Old Master Qi Tian!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTo think that Old Master Qi Tian would actually come out!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Old Master Qi Tian was one of the Senior Old Masters of the Kunlun God Sect, with an extremely heaven revolting cultivation base. He was an Immortal King state being who could already comprehend the Heaven and Earth, someone who could be considered to be a single body with the Heaven and Earth. With a single thought of his, he could destroy every single thing around him.</p><br/><p>Kunlun God Sect did not just have a single Immortal King state Old Master. As to just how many of them there were, this was a secret that no one knew about. After all, this was a secret of the Kunlun God Sect relating to the depth of their resources.</p><br/><p>\u201cDisciple Tai Qiantian pays his respect to the Old Master.\u201d The moment Tai Qiantian caught sight of who had arrived, his heart skipped a beat as he greeted respectfully.</p><br/><p>Looking at this figure before him, Han Juntian was still managing to maintain his composure despite feeling some slight stir in his heart. The appearance of Old Master Qi Tian was naturally not to suppress them. He was here to make peace in this matter.</p><br/><p>But, even Han Juntian had not expected that this disciple of his would actually be formidable enough to push the Kunlun God Sect to such an extent.</p><br/><p>Given Lin Fan\u2019s current strength as a Saint Immortal being, he should never have been able to force the Kunlun God Sect to such a state. But, the main reason was because he had struck it rich in the Triple Emperor Heaven Cache, obtaining an endless amount of precious Legendary Items for crafting weapons that could create all of these Immortal Weapons. For most martial artists, self destructing any Immortal Weapon was a choice that they would only make at their most desperate times. Otherwise, who could be willing to take such a loss?</p><br/><p>But now that Lin Fan was just blowing up Immortal Weapons left and right as though they were some freebies, who can bloody beat him right now?</p><br/><p>This was just like fighting a BOSS level being. While others were using a small short ranged rifle to shoot, it was equal to another person throwing out nuclear missiles one after another. Who in the bloody world could play against that?</p><br/><p>Old Master Qi Tian looked over at Han Juntian before casting his sight onto Lin Fan. Those deep eyes of his seemed as though they were bent on seeing through Lin Fan. But, Lin Fan just puffed his chest up proudly. Since this guy wanted to take a look, he could look all he wanted, lest he were to complain that Lin Fan was being stingy and not letting him take a proper look!</p><br/><p>With the appearance of a Senior Old Master of the Kunlun God Sect, everyone present felt that this was probably the end of the war. Otherwise, if they were to continue fighting on like this, the outcome would be entirely unimaginable.</p><br/><p>Be it the Kunlun God Sect or the Heaven and Earth Sect, neither side would allow the Senior Old Masters to fight with one another.</p><br/><p>Those were the most precious resources of both the sects. In a battle where everyone was throwing their resources at one another, if any unforeseen situation were to happen, both sides would definitely suffer greatly.</p><br/><p>Old Master Qi Tian was frowning right now. To think that he could not see through this lad before him. If this were any other time, he would have definitely suppressed Lin Fan for sure. But right now, they were on the verge of trying to break through to attain the Dao of Heavenly Lord. There must absolutely be no accidents during this time.</p><br/><p>In the depths of the Kunlun God Sect, all of them were working hard together at perceiving the great Dao of Heavenly Lord. However, they had no choice but to interfere in the affairs happening outside. Otherwise, the Kunlun God Sect might have even been knocked down by the other party.</p><br/><p>\u201cHan Juntian, let this matter end right here. The Kunlun God Sect does not wish to become enemies with the Heaven and Earth Sect.\u201d Old Master Qi Tian spoke up.</p><br/><p>Han Juntian could refuse to give Tai Qiantian any face, but he could not do the same to Old Master Qi Tian.</p><br/><p>Old Master Qi Tian was a supremely powerful being who had risen to the several thousand years ago. Back then, he was already an Immortal King state being. Even though Han Juntian was the Grandmaster of the Heaven and Earth Sect, there was no way he wouldn\u2019t comply now that Old Master Qi Tian had spoken up.</p><br/><p>But just as Han Juntian was about to speak up, he discovered a beam of light streaking through the void and arriving right in the face of Old Master Qi Tian.</p><br/><p>\u201cEXPLODE!\u201d</p><br/><p>BAM!</p><br/><p>A Supreme Grade Immortal Weapon had suddenly flown right in the face of Old Master Qi Tian\u2019s consciousness and exploded! The might generated from the destruction of a Supreme Grade Immortal Weapon was extremely horrifying.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan took a step forth and roared out toward the other party, \u201cWho in the bloody hell do you think you are! YOU don\u2019t wish to be an enemy of the Heaven and Earth Sect? Today, Your Daddy is going to f*ck over your entire Kunlun God Sect! Don\u2019t think that you can start acting strong just because you have a single trace of consciousness out! Hurry and send your true body out so that Your Daddy can teach you how to be a proper human being!\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, the entire place erupted out into a frenzy.</p><br/><p>\u201cHoly f*ck! Has that lad gone crazy? Does he not know who this person before him is?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust where in the world did the Heaven and Earth Sect find this disciple? Is he bonkers or what?! Does he really not know who he\u2019s dealing with?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s over! Completely over! To think that that lad would even dare to strike at the Old Master Qi Tian! Even if the Senior Old Masters of the Heaven and Earth Sect were to come here, even they wouldn\u2019t be able to save him from this anymore!\u201d</p><br/><p>The other nine sects, six factions, and every other force out there were just completely stupefied. They had not expected that this disciple of the Heaven and Earth Sect would dare to spout out such words! Just what sort of a background did he have for him to have such guts?!</p><br/><p>Right now, Han Juntian was just looking at Lin Fan with stupefaction, frozen to his core on seeing the situation developing like this. This lad was way too cocky, wasn\u2019t he? Back when he was younger, Han Juntian was also one hell of a cocky fella. But compared to this lad, it was really like a child being compared to an adult; there was no way to compare at all! This guy was just creating a huge mess that was worthy of death!</p><br/><p>And when Han Juntian turned his head over toward Old Master Qi Tian, his expression changed entirely. The amount of force produced by this lad causing a Supreme Grade Immortal Weapon to self destruct was definitely heaven revolting.</p><br/><p>Even if it were Han Juntian himself, if he was unprepared and was caught right in the middle of it, he would definitely be severely injured.</p><br/><p>The Old Master Qi Tian right now was only the doppelganger from a piece of his consciousness. Naturally, his strength wouldn\u2019t be even one percent of his original self. Therefore, there was no way he could stand the self destruction of a Supreme Grade Immortal Weapon.</p><br/><p>Looking at how the consciousness doppelganger of the Old Master Qi Tian was blown apart with only half of it remaining, he raised his head, \u201cOld Master Qi Tian, don\u2019t say that I\u2019m bullying your consciousness doppelganger! Bring your true body out!\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, Lin Fan wanted to take this gamble. This was an extremely rare chance here! If he were to give it up, there might not be a second chance again!</p><br/><p>At the same time, he knew that he would definitely not die. That was because Han Juntian would definitely not sit by idly and leave him, and neither would the Senior Old Masters of the Heaven and Earth Sect. Even if worse came to worse where the Senior Old Masters DID decide to ignore him, he would not die still. At most, he\u2019d just have to blow up all of those Immortal Weapons before seizing the chance to escape. And if he couldn\u2019t, well, there was always the Heaven and Earth Smelt to hide in. This was the final safe plan.</p><br/><p>Everything was planned out perfectly.</p><br/><p>\u201cYOU B*STARD\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, the crazed voice of the Old Master Qi Tian boomed out across the entire world.</p><br/><p>The clouds quaked while the winds howled and thunder crackled. It seemed as though the entire world was shivering under the force of his fury.</p><br/><p>The might of an Immortal King rattled the entire world\u2026The true body of the Old Master Qi Tian was about to descend!</p><br/><p>Right now, Lin Fan was extremely nervous as well. The Big BOSS was coming out! Whether or not his cultivation state increased would depend on this moment here!</p></div>\n</div>"}

At the same time, there was a stark change in that indifferent expression of the God of the Dragon Ancestor.</p><br/><p>Seeing this scene, Lin Fan felt a great deal of confidence in his heart that Chicky must definitely be the descendant of this God of the Dragon Ancestor!</p><br/><p>\"Cuckcuckoo!\"</p><br/><p>Chicky crowed out softly before turning his body sideways and looking at Lin Fan with a strange expression. His meaning was clear: This God of the Dragon Ancestor was his Daddy!</p><br/><p>Lin Fan's heart was thumping so hard it was about to pop out right now. If this were truly the case, wouldn't he have hit a bloody gold mine? He then hurriedly squinted, twitched, and winked with his eye furiously.</p><br/><p>'Since this is determined, hurry up and go hug this guy's legs tightly!'</p><br/><p>Chicky nodded his head silently. In fact, he even gave Lin Fan a special look.</p><br/><p>'Old Bro, don't worry! When Chicky takes the show personally, everything is going to be settled for sure!'</p><br/><p>Seeing this look from Chicky, Lin Fan was filled with confidence. Even though Chicky might not be too much altogether, he had been specially trained by Lin Fan. Those leg hugging skills were definitely top notch!</p><br/><p>All of a sudden, the tension in the atmosphere changed.</p><br/><p>Chicky cried out loudly, and his disposition had changed entirely all of a sudden as well!</p><br/><p>Even though that pair of chicken eyes of his couldn't be considered as large, they underwent an extremely hard change within this short period of time.</p><br/><p>Agitation! Disbelief! Shock! Exhilaration\u2026!</p><br/><p>\"C-CUCKCUCKOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!\"</p><br/><p>Looking at this God of the Dragon Ancestor before him, Chicky suddenly spread out his wings as though he had just seen something absolutely outrageous! Those little feet of his darted over furiously and pounced toward the God of the Dragon Ancestor.</p><br/><p>Instantly, Chicky was hugging the legs of the God of the Dragon Ancestor tightly! That expression as he hugged onto the legs of the God of the Dragon Ancestor was as though he was filled with nostalgia right now!</p><br/><p>\"CUCKOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO\u2026!!!\"</p><br/><p>Even though Chicky could not speak just yet, the meaning of that cry was clear.</p><br/><p>'DADDYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY\u2026!!!'</p><br/><p>The God of the Dragon Ancestor was completely stupefied right now. Those stern eyes of his glared at Chicky intently as though he was trying to verify something.</p><br/><p>The God of the Dragon Ancestor could confirm that the bloodline of this living being before him was extremely similar to his.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Lin Fan took a step forth and pointed his finger slightly, trembling with a face of astonishment, \"C-Could you be the father of Chicky?\"</p><br/><p>At that moment, all members of the Colossal Dragon race were completely petrified. This was especially the case for the older generation of the Colossal Dragon race right now. Their hearts were surging with torrential waves as they were filled with absolute disbelief.</p><br/><p>They knew that the God of the Dragon Ancestor once had a relationship with the Phoenix race! But, that was something that had happened a long time ago now!</p><br/><p>And right now when they looked at Chicky, they could also feel that there was the bloodline of the Colossal Dragon race cruising through his body! Also, there was a part of this bloodline that belonged to the Phoenix race as well!</p><br/><p>However, there was one thing they could not understand. How could the life that resulted as a fusion of the God of the Dragon Ancestor and the Phoenix race's copulation be something like this?</p><br/><p>At this moment, Lin Fan looked at the current situation and felt a strange feeling bubbling. The expression of the God of the Dragon Ancestor seemed to have calmed down!</p><br/><p>If Chicky was truly the descendant of the God of the Dragon Ancestor, he should naturally be extremely agitated at their reunion now. But, why did he not have any reaction at all? There couldn't have been some mistake, right?</p><br/><p>And, the acting of Chicky right now was absolutely to the point. It was the complete behavior someone should display after being a poor orphaned child who had been abandoned out into the world for countless of years, and then finally found his kin!</p><br/><p>\"CUCKCUCKOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!\"</p><br/><p>At this moment, Chicky was a little indignant now. He had been hugging this guy's legs for so damned long now! Yet, this fella wasn't giving any reaction at all! To Chicky, this made no sense at all!</p><br/><p>He then wailed out loudly. This time around, the wail was even more tragic. It was as though he was a child without a home right now! He was as pitiful as he could get at this very moment!</p><br/><p>SCREEEEEEEEEEECH!</p><br/><p>All of a sudden, the sky was filled with a patch of fiery red. From within those flames, a Phoenix swooped down and appeared before the God of the Dragon Ancestor instantly.</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan caught sight of this Phoenix, his heart tightened. Wasn't this the Phoenix he had witnessed back in Xuanhuang World?</p><br/><p>At this moment, this Phoenix took on a human form. She was draped in a set of red Phoenix robes. Those lively eyes of hers were filled with an endearing look the moment she caught sight of Chicky.</p><br/><p>Elegant, poised, authoritative, et cetera... Her disposition changed all of a sudden into that of a tender motherly love.</p><br/><p>Instantly, Chicky was hugged in the embrace of the woman. Her voice was gentle and was filled with a boundless amount of longing, \"My son\u2026!\"</p><br/><p>Chicky, who had been coordinating his performance with Lin Fan perfectly from the start, was now stunned as well. He let go of the legs of the God of the Dragon Ancestor involuntarily, then looked at this woman with a dumbfounded look. Even after she had picked him up into her embrace, he had still yet to snap out of his stupor.</p><br/><p>\"My son\u2026!!!\"</p><br/><p>It was just two words, yet it was more than enough to have Chicky cry out thoroughly. Spreading his wings, he hid himself within her embrace and bawled out loudly.</p><br/><p>\"Don't cry now, don't cry! It's your mother's fault here! I'm the reason why you had to endure so much hardship outside!\" Tears were gushing down the eyes of this woman. It was as though she had something extremely heart-breaking brought up in her mind.</p><br/><p>The members of the Colossal Dragon race in the surroundings exchanged glances with one another. They knew that something big was going to happen soon.</p><br/><p>The God of the Dragon Ancestor looked at the situation around him and his brows furrowed, \"Let us head back first before discussing about this. We'll talk later.\"</p><br/><p>The woman who was hugging Chicky felt her heart being overwhelmed with emotions. She then glared over with her beautiful eyes, \"What do we have to talk about when we head back? We'll talk about it right here and now!\"</p><br/><p>\"Zi Feng\u2026\" The heart of the God of the Dragon Ancestor skipped a beat. He had a bad feeling about this.</p><br/><p>\"Huang Wusheng! What were you doing just now? Why didn't you have any expression at all when your son hugged you? Are you looking down on him?\" Zi Feng scolded him harshly.</p><br/><p>\"Zi Feng, I\u2026!\"</p><br/><p>\"No, don't say anything! What did you say 10,000 years ago? And what are you going to say now? Since you don't wish to see him right now, then let me go, and I'll live a life with my son together!\" Zi Feng's expression was displeased.</p><br/><p>10,000 years ago, it was precisely because she was with this guy that she suffered the oppression of the Colossal Dragon race. Later on, when Huang Wusheng became the God of the Dragon Ancestor and had an unparalleled position in the race, that was when he wanted to go fetch her back.</p><br/><p>But as far as Zi Feng went, what in the world did he take both the mother and child for? People they could chase away and bring back as and how they wished?</p><br/><p>\"I'll just ask you one simple question. Do you acknowledge him?\" Zi Feng asked.</p><br/><p>The God of the Dragon Ancestor looked at Chicky, then at his surrounding fellow race. He then nodded his head eventually.</p><br/><p>\"Acknowledge\u2026 I acknowledge. Shall we discuss this slowly after we head back?\" At this moment, the God of the Dragon Ancestor felt like he was about to implode. The first time he saw Chicky, he already knew that this was his son.</p><br/><p>But, his appearance was something that the God of the Dragon Ancestor found hard to come to terms with for a moment or so. If not for the relationship between their bloodline, he would not dare to believe that a living being which looked like this could possibly be his son!</p><br/><p>At this moment, Lin Fan stood at a corner and watched silently. He discovered that this thing was happening a little too quickly!</p><br/><p>To think that Chicky's mother would arrive here! And this God of the Dragon Ancestor seemed a little like a henpecked man!</p><br/><p>However, seeing the melodramatic events that transpired between Chicky's parents, Lin Fan did not want to press any further. Based on what he had heard earlier, he had a rough idea of what was going on.</p><br/><p>Back in the past, this God of the Dragon Ancestor had yet to attain the position he was in right now. As such, his life wasn't under his control. But because Zi Feng was unable to accept something like that, she headed down to the Lower World from this Upper World.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>A melodrama as such was filled with boundless entertainment for Lin Fan. However, there was only a single thought on his mind right now, and that was\u2026</p><br/><p>'Chicky, please carry on with your act!'</p><br/>\n</div>"}

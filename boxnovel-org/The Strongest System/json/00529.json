Now that the four of them joined forces to gang up against a single human, one could possibly imagine the sheer might of this lineup.</p><br/><p>If it were anyone else that had to go against these four, they would most likely be disintegrated into dust immediately, without any room for resistance.</p><br/><p>Sealing the Heaven and Earth, all four commanders unleashed their ultimate moves, as their True Skill seeds churned. It was as though the Heaven's Will of the Ancient Saint World was their direct source of energy, with four beams of light shining down from the Heavens onto them, channeling additional power to them consistently.</p><br/><p>Seizing the opportunity to strike with a sneak attack, the four commanders were now on the offensive, with their flurry of strikes slamming through the void. In an instant, thousands of palm strikes merged into the void, as a series of expressions appeared on all of their faces.</p><br/><p>Sinister, vile, lustful, and malevolent looks\u2026</p><br/><p>All four of them were spread out in four directions, blocking Lin Fan's path of escape entirely. It was as though they had welcomed some sort of ultimate heavenly wisdom to form this killing formation of absolutes.</p><br/><p>For the past 100 years, they had been in seclusion, trying to obtain that much desired Divine celestial cultivation state. However, the difficulty in attaining it was way more difficult than anyone could imagine.</p><br/><p>However, due to that, they had comprehended a fair amount of heavenly wisdom of this world. Every single strike that came from them now brought with it a stunning amount of energy from the Heaven and Earth.</p><br/><p>'That is some terrifying strength there!'</p><br/><p>Lin Fan frowned. He could tell that these four were far from simple. However, he had not expected that once they joined forces together, they would seal every single opportunity of survival and escape for him.</p><br/><p>The four commanders were existences that couldn't be compared to any other ordinary ancient race beings.</p><br/><p>At the same time, Lin Fan was gradually beginning to understand why the ancient race could continue to oppress the beings of the thousands of races out there for such a long time.</p><br/><p>At this moment, even if a desolate celestial full cultivation state being were to appear, he would definitely be disintegrated into mere dust in the hands of these commanders.</p><br/><p>'So Near, Yet So Far!'</p><br/><p>Lin Fan's body shifted like an agile snake as his feet swiveled around with the powers of the Yin and Yang along the Heaven and Earth. With a single point of his finger, a dense number of apertures ruptured through the void, as though it was made out of paper.</p><br/><p>Doomsday Calamity God Fist!</p><br/><p>Black Tiger Steals Heart!</p><br/><p>Twisting Heaven and Earth!</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>Instantly, Lin Fan's True Skill seeds began to churn as well, as each and every one of them gave off a brilliant glow. The light being emanated was razor sharp, as it pierced through the layers of time and space.</p><br/><p>Brilliantly dazzling, the light spread out in the entire place.</p><br/><p>Going on the offense, Lin Fan had immediately employed a couple of his ultimate moves, bent on going all out against the four commanders.</p><br/><p>\"Just what sort of a background does this human have? To think that he could deploy so many ultimate moves in a single breath!\"</p><br/><p>\"Look at the sheer size of those True Skill seeds as well! Just how in the world did he cultivate them?\"</p><br/><p>\"Hmph! So what if he's strong? Against the four of us together, he doesn't stand a chance!\"</p><br/><p>Despite being rattled by Lin Fan's strength, the four commanders still maintained their advantage. After all, so what if his True Skill seeds were stronger? He was still an ant against the combined might of the four of them.</p><br/><p>The first commander, Gu Haitian, moved like a dragon. Every single breath he took caused a huge amount of Saint Spirit Qi to burst forth.</p><br/><p>'Ancient Saint World's Heaven Will's Booster Complete!'</p><br/><p>'Gigantic Whirling Ancient Saint Punch!'</p><br/><p>Suddenly, the pitch black skin of his gleamed with a bright golden shade. This gold colored light was brought down from the Heavens under the booster of the Heaven's Will of the Ancient Saint World. At the same time, as his mighty punch struck out, it felt as if a miniature world were pummelling down towards Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>The spirit of the Doomsday Calamity God Fist was strong enough to devastate the entire world. However, against the might of this single punch by the commander, even the spirit was being forced back to the brink of destruction.</p><br/><p>'Annihilate the living!'</p><br/><p>Each of the other three commanders began to unleash their ultimate moves as well. The void began to quake violently, as though the entire world was about to be destroyed.</p><br/><p>Under the face of this absolute power, anyone would be forced into submission naturally.</p><br/><p>'Damn it! Because these four made the first move with the sneak attack, I'm now being pushed into a disadvantage.' Lin Fan's eyes shone coldly as he struggled against their offensive attacks. The four of them had a continuous stream of aura that was interconnected. No matter which direction Lin Fan attacked from, it would receive a burst of strength immediately.</p><br/><p>At the same time, Lin Fan could not help but despise the cheapness of this Heaven's Will in the Ancient Saint World. It was just blatantly helping the ancient race for free!</p><br/><p>By now, Lin Fan's defenses were finally broken through by the four commanders and their attacks.</p><br/><p>All of them let out a look of excitement as they hollered together, \"SEIZE THE CHANCE!\"</p><br/><p>BAM!</p><br/><p>A massive amount of energy burst forth from the four of them, turning into a ball before culminating to form a gigantic dragon that rocketed out towards Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>With Lin Fan as the center, the aftershock of the mighty attack rippled out in all directions, destroying all the buildings and structures in the vicinity. In fact, even some of the ancient race soldiers who were nearer to the blast impact were turned into a mess of blood altogether.</p><br/><p>\"S-strong!\"</p><br/><p>\"Is that human dead yet?\"</p><br/><p>\"HAHA! Long live our four commanders!\"</p><br/><p>Catching sight of this earthshattering battle, all of the ancient race soldiers were exhilarated to no ends. This was the might of their revered four commanders! This was power that no man in this world could go against!</p><br/><p>On the other hand, the captives were filled with nothing but anguish at this sight.</p><br/><p>They could tell that the human was extremely strong. However, there was just no chance of a comeback for him against these four commanders.</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>Looking at the scene before them, the four commanders smirked. They were extremely clear about the power of that single attack. Even they themselves might not be able to survive the attack under the same circumstances. Needless to say, there was no way this human could get out of it alive for sure.</p><br/><p>However, all four of them had their faces changed suddenly as they could sense the situation in the aftermath of the attack. In fact, Gu Haitian's eyeballs nearly popped out as he exclaimed in shock.</p><br/><p>\"H-HOW COULD THIS BE? What the f*ck is that thing that could defend against our mighty attack? This is an attack that even we ourselves may not be able to block! How could a single cauldron looking thing block it? What is that treasure even? A dao weapon? An utmost treasure?\"</p><br/><p>\"This human has had such a miraculous encounter upon appearing here. That must be a defensive treasure for sure!\"</p><br/><p>\"Don't panic now! As long as the four of us continue to seal up this entire place, we can definitely kill him!\"</p><br/><p>The other three commanders had looks of lust within their eyes as well. To think that this human would possess a defensive treasure of such caliber!</p><br/><p>For it to defend against an attack of that might, that must be a dao weapon at least! In fact, it might even be a supreme grade dao weapon! Otherwise, there was no way it wouldn't budge at all in the face of all that!</p><br/><p>\"This human's fighting strength is nowhere near ours. Even if he has this dao weapon, it won't help him take us down. Even if were to try, we'll mow him down!\" The fourth commander, Gu Zhantian, hollered.</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>At that very last moment, Lin Fan no longer wanted to defend. No matter how strong these guys were, there was no point for him to continue wasting his stamina with them.</p><br/><p>These four possessed an innate advantage over him. Thinking back, if he were to take on this one versus four and retaliate, that would definitely take quite a toll on him.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan did not like stuff like this where he would always be on the losing end.</p><br/><p>The Heaven and Earth Smelt was a godly item that was crafted through the System. It could smelt everything within this world. Therefore, its defensive capabilities were naturally frightening as well.</p><br/><p>When the tremendous might of the four commanders landed on the Heaven and Earth Smelt, it didn't even budge a single inch nor reacted against it at all. Their attack was simply dissipated in all directions naturally.</p><br/><p>Hidden within the Heaven and Earth Smelt, Lin Fan rubbed his chin and grinned coldly as he entered Stealth mode.</p><br/><p>BAM!</p><br/><p>The doors of the smelt opened up with a slam. The four commanders focused their attention, awaiting the exit of that human. However, no matter how long they waited, there was no one coming out of it.</p><br/><p>They were puzzled for a moment.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, their faces changed.</p><br/><p>\"HE'S OVER THERE\u2026!\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

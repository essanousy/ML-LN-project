But, when he took a clearer look at the thing in his arm, he was stunned. Why in the bloody world was there just a single arm left? Where had that bald monk disappeared?</p><br/><p>Coming out of the Heaven and Earth Smelt, Lin Fan saw the Boundless Future Buddha Lord bolting into the distant void while blasting out in rage, \u201cLad! You had better wait up! Just you wait\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Boundless Future Buddha Lord was practically on the brink of breaking down right now \u2014 to think that this lad would be this despicable and shameless! Initially, he had thought that the lad only had a single treasure that could f*ck him over. But who knew that the lad would actually have one more up his sleeves!</p><br/><p>Back when he realized that lad was grabbing onto his arm, he had already sensed something strange. It felt as though he had just fallen for a trick or something. Without any hesitation, he severed his arm right away. And at the end, it proved that his decisive act was indeed the right choice to make. If he had not done so, he would have been dragged into that mysterious smelt by that lad as well.</p><br/><p>At that moment, he did not even know what else to say anymore. He had never imagined that a lad who was equivalent to trash in his eyes would be able to grow to this extent.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan, on the other hand, pursed his lips while looking up at the void. That bald monk had managed to escape once more. That guy was simply being way too cautious, such that he did not leave Lin Fan a single opening at all!</p><br/><p>All of a sudden, Lin Fan discovered some feedback coming from that arm he was holding onto.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan checked it out in surprise.</p><br/><p>\u201cBenefactor!\u201d A radiant sound boomed out in Lin Fan\u2019s ears. Taking an even closer look, Lin Fan discovered that there were ten bald monks suppressed in that Buddha Palm.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho are you guys?\u201d He asked curiously, not expecting that there would be sh*t like this in the palm of the Boundless Future Buddha Lord.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello, Benefactor. We poor monks are the Senior Old Masters of the Good and Evil Buddha Sect, and we\u2019re presently being suppressed by the Boundless Future Buddha Lord in this place.\u201d One of the bald monks replied.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan peered carefully. \u201cAnd I\u2019m supposed to just take your words for it? I don\u2019t know about that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s only natural that you have your doubts, Benefactor. We\u2019ve heard that you\u2019re a disciple of the Heaven and Earth Sect, Benefactor. If it\u2019s possible, could you take us to the Heaven and Earth Sect? Old Master Geng Yangtian of your revered sect would definitely be able to tell.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded his head. \u201cAlright. I\u2019ll take you guys there then.\u201d</p><br/><p>He then kept that Buddha Arm in his storage. To think that the Boundless Future Buddha Lord would have suppressed these bald monks as well. However, Lin Fan did not know who they were at all. Since that was the case, he would just take them back to the sect to check out if they were real or not. And if they weren\u2019t, he could very well just subdue them later on.</p><br/><p>Looking into the distance, Lin Fan dove into the void and headed back for the sect.</p><br/><p>At that moment, the Boundless Future Buddha Lord, who was in the midst of escaping, came out of the void. He had suddenly discovered a problem. He seemed to have kept all of those bald monks of the Good and Evil Buddha Sect he had suppressed in that Buddha Arm of his!</p><br/><p>\u201cARGH!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Boundless Future Buddha Lord howled out all of a sudden. It wasn\u2019t a mere thought \u2014 it was the truth! All of those fellas were still sealed in that severed arm of his!</p><br/><p>Those fellas were all a part of his plan! Now that he had lost them, what was he supposed to do?</p><br/><p>Damn it! God damn it! One fine day, he must definitely have that lad killed! Otherwise, there was no way he was going to be able to appease this hateful vengeance boiling in his heart!</p><br/><p>\u201cWho is there? Come out!\u201d Suddenly, the Boundless Future Buddha Lord had caught hold of a mysterious aura that had appeared in the void.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time, Boundless Future Buddha Lord. To think that you would be in such a wretched state right now.\u201d A cloud of black mist appeared in the void before gradually materializing into a physical body.</p><br/><p>A figure shrouded with a black robe appeared; his face could not be seen at all.</p><br/><p>When the Boundless Future Buddha Lord caught sight of this person, his brows furrowed. His tone evidently brought forth a trace of disbelief. \u201cIt\u2019s you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIndeed, it\u2019s me.\u201d The black robed person replied with a low, husky voice. If one did not use their eyes to literally look at him, they might not have caught even a whiff of his aura at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d The Boundless Future Buddha Lord looked at this person warily without the slightest bit of carelessness. Even though it was a pity that he had lost those fellas through severing his arm, so be it. His Buddha Power then gushed out wildly, healing up that severed arm of his. However, it was no longer the same arm as before.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, you must be wondering about the background of that lad, right? Perhaps, I can tell about it to you?\u201d The black robed person said.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd, you\u2019ll actually be so kind hearted?\u201d The Boundless Future Buddha Lord snorted out coldly.</p><br/><p>The black robed person did not reply to the Boundless Future Buddha Lord\u2019s question. He just continued, \u201cBased on what I know, he should be the reincarnation of Heavenly Lord Xin Feng.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cImpossible! For one to reincarnate, they would require the Heavenly Lord Source. Back then when Heavenly Lord Xin Feng had fallen, his Source had long dissipated! Don\u2019t try and lie to me!\u201d The Boundless Future Buddha Lord retorted.</p><br/><p>The black robed person merely chuckled, \u201cWhether or not you believe it is up to you. Indeed, his Heavenly Lord Source was destroyed back then. But, I\u2019m afraid you must have not known that Heavenly Lord Xin Feng had long predicted for those things to happen. That was just a fa\u00e7ade that he created, because he was afraid of you guys fighting over the Heavenly Lord Source. To think that you guys would have been deceived by him for a good hundreds of thousands of years. How tragic!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Boundless Future Buddha Lord suddenly thought back about that Heaven and Earth Sutra. He then looked at the black robed person. \u201cWhat\u2019s your point of telling me all this? What do you want\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>The black robed person laughed out coldly, \u201cI was thinking that perhaps we could\u2026 cooperate? I\u2019ll help you to become a Heavenly Lord.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Boundless Future Buddha Lord was filled with disdain. \u201cHmph! With just your capabilities?\u201d</p><br/><p>The black robed person laughed out before his tone darkened down sinisterly. \u201cOther than Heavenly Lord Xin Feng, there\u2019s no one in this world who knows the Dao of the Heavenly Lord better than I do. Even you are no match for my knowledge\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLaughable! Do you think that Your Buddha Lord is someone who can be scared off by a few mere words of hoaxes from you?! Unless you\u2019re trying to say that even Heavenly Lord Dao Comprehension can\u2019t compare with you!\u201d The Boundless Future Buddha Lord scoffed.</p><br/><p>The black robed person did not reply and merely removed his black cloak and hood. When the Boundless Future Buddha Lord caught sight of that face of his, he was entirely stumped, heaving in a deep breath of air. \u201cAlright! As long as you help me to attain the Dao of Heavenly Lord, no matter what you require, I can promise it to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, I\u2019m still doubtful of everything you\u2019ve said. Why is that lad so crafty then? Every single treasure he has is extremely underhanded. If he was truly the reincarnation of Heavenly Lord Xin Feng, he would definitely not behave as such.\u201d</p><br/><p>The black robed person was taken aback, as though he was struck by the question posed. He then replied calmly, \u201cEverything is but a fa\u00e7ade\u2026 It is naturally because he is afraid of being recognized by you guys.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Boundless Future Buddha Lord was deeply skeptical about this. Fa\u00e7ade? Wasn\u2019t there just a little too many facades?</p><br/><p>However, now was not the time for him to overthink things anymore. As long as he were to attain that Dao of the Heavenly Lord, he could give up everything else.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Heaven and Earth Sect\u2026</p><br/><p>After chasing the Boundless Future Buddha Lord for such a long time, Lin Fan was feeling a little worn out as well. However, the returns from this trip were simply fabulous.</p><br/><p>He had killed so many Master Gods of the Moon Shadow Mainland, and had caused such a huge ruckus that they were definitely suffering immense losses.</p><br/><p>If he were to head out there and kill them a few more times, wouldn\u2019t that be just crazy then? He would just skyrocket in strength, wouldn\u2019t he?</p><br/><p>Thinking all that, he entered the depths of the sect\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cOld Master, hurry and come check this out! Who are these bald monks here?\u201d Lin Fan took out the arm of the Boundless Future Buddha Lord.</p><br/><p>Right now, he was going to get to the bottom of this. As long as the Old Master were to say that he didn\u2019t recognize them, he would throw all of them into the Heaven and Earth Smelt to refine right away.</p><br/><p>Nine Immortal Kings and one Immortal Lord \u2014 rather decent!</p><br/><p>Who knew, his strength might even jump yet again!</p></div>\n</div>"}

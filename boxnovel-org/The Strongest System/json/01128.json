Honestly, it was really quite a stressful experience to speak the truth at times. This was especially the case when it was in front of someone like the Frost Master God, whose strength was so darned formidable. Given Lin Fan\u2019s current strength, he was truly not a match for her.</p><br/><p>Stunned for a moment, that supremely peerless face of the Frost Master God suddenly took on a stark change.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did you just say?\u201d The Frost Master God asked coldly, causing the entire place to feel as though there was an endless snowstorm ripping out all of existence. Compared to before, everything was even more threatening right now. In her mind, she could have never thought that this Indigenous Being before her would actually dare to spout out such words.</p><br/><p>Right now, Lin Fan expressed his exasperation. Honestly, he did not want to let this out. But, no matter what he said, the Frost Master God would not believe him at all. He had wanted to throw the blame onto the Boundless Future Buddha Lord. But well, well, well. Guess what? She had managed to knock down that entire accusation with a single statement.</p><br/><p>\u2018The Boundless Future Buddha Lord does not have the guts.\u2019</p><br/><p>The moment he heard that, he was just rendered helpless. If the Boundless Future Buddha Lord had heard that personally, he would have definitely tried his best to prove that he had the guts even if it would mean the end of his life. After all, which man would want to say that they did not have the guts?</p><br/><p>Lin Fan heaved in a deep breath of air and looked at the Frost Master God straight in the eye. \u201cI said that the Water Master God was killed by me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Right now, he was feeling really nervous in his heart, wondering if the Frost Master God would kill him for spouting out such words. However, he didn\u2019t reckon that that might happen. After all, the Frost Master God had made an oath, and it was something that was already set in stone. If the Frost Master God dared to strike out to suppress him, her Godhead would definitely be destroyed.</p><br/><p>The changes on the face of the Frost Master God were endless as the chilly aura in the air turned ever stronger by the moment. She then glared wide eyed at Lin Fan. \u201cYou\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan could feel an enormous killing intent being emanated from the body of the Frost Master God, as though she was bent on having him killed right here. But seemingly recalling something, the Frost Master God did not take action right away.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan asked her carefully, \u201cYou swore earlier on. You\u2019ll\u2026 keep that oath, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Frost Master God closed her eyes and heaved in deeply before jerking them wide open once more. \u201cI\u2019ll definitely abide by that oath and not kill you today for sure. You can leave.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan heaved a sigh of relief. Thereafter, not daring to linger for the slightest bit, he bolted off far into the distance. This Frost Master God was simply way too dangerous. However, his trip to the Northern region this time around could not be considered as a huge loss either \u2014 he had managed to find out that there was such a Master God that existed within the ranks of the Moon Shadow Mainland. If he did not know about this beforehand, there might have been a high chance that he could get himself f*cked over by these Master Gods the next time he went up against the Moon Shadow Mainland just because he would have ended up underestimating them.</p><br/><p>But, at that moment, the thing that had Lin Fan feeling shocked was that the Frost Master God had actually started moving as well! She was just following him side by side.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan came to a stop. \u201cFrost Master God, could we somehow be headed in the exact same direction? Or how about this? Perhaps, you can leave first and I\u2019ll look for another way to go?\u201d</p><br/><p>The thing that he was the most afraid of was happening right now. However, he still maintained his composure and commented.</p><br/><p>The Frost Master God looked at Lin Fan. \u201cI swore that I would not kill you today and will let you off from this Northern region as well. However, the moment the day is past, your death shall arrive. You can just walk your own way and I\u2019ll just follow you all the way. I\u2019m not breaking the oath at all.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck me\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>This was THE thing that Lin Fan was the most afraid of. From the very beginning, he had thought that this was an extremely normal oath. But, it was only after the oath was made that he noticed something was really off with it.</p><br/><p>She was going to let him off today. But, given the strength of the Frost Master God, she could just follow him all the way; and once tomorrow arrived, she\u2019d just f*ck him over. There was nothing wrong with that really.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied exasperatedly, \u201cHow can you do this? This is just reneging on your words.\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking at Lin Fan with her icy expression, the Frost Master God merely scoffed out a few times coldly without say anything more.</p><br/><p>Given her strength, if Lin Fan wanted to ditch her in the dumps, that was something just not possible.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Lin Fan felt his entire heart breaking down. The Frost Master God was no fool or retard. Perhaps, she was already prepared to have him killed from the very beginning.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan started thinking things through. Things were really getting dangerous now. No matter what, he would have to ditch this Frost Master God away. Otherwise, the outcome would really be unimaginable.</p><br/><p>\u201cFrost Master God, do you have to be this shameless? You\u2019ve promised to let me off, yet you\u2019re just following behind me all the way. Isn\u2019t that just lying blatantly?\u201d Lin Fan remarked once more, hoping that this could persuade the Frost Master God to leave.</p><br/><p>But once again, the Frost Master God said nothing more, choosing to just look at Lin Fan silently instead.</p><br/><p>Shaking his head, Lin Fan bolted into the void and started sprinting for his life. But, no matter how fast Lin Fan\u2019s speed was, he found that the Frost Master God just sticking to him the entire time. This was something that had him feeling totally stupefied. While the strength of the Frost Master God might be much stronger than hers, there was no need for her to mess with him like this, right?</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck this! I\u2019m going for it!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPower of Biggra!\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, the Power of Biggra burst forth as a rich mist of Biggra enveloped the entire Heaven and Earth with it. Instantly, the Frost Master God frowned as she increased the intensity of her chilling aura. To Lin Fan\u2019s astonishment, he was discovering that his Power of Biggra was actually showing signs of being frozen up, such that it could not approach the side of the Frost Master God at all!</p><br/><p>Holy f*ck! To think that it would be useless!</p><br/><p>Did he really have to resort to using that soap of his?</p><br/><p>But, he did not know whether the soap had any use on the Frost Master God as well.</p><br/><p>The strength of this Frost Master God before him was way, way stronger than the Boundless Future Buddha Lord. If he were to have her killed, perhaps his strength would be able to leap up instantaneously as well!</p><br/><p>Without any hesitation, Lin Fan took out the soap before turning around to face the Frost Master God. \u201cAre you going to leave or not? Do you know what this item in my hand is?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Frost Master God said nothing, neither did she reveal a single trace of fear or anxiousness on her face. Evidently, Lin Fan was nothing to her.</p><br/><p>F*cking hell!</p><br/><p>To think that even after he took out the Lin Brand\u2019s Soap, this Frost Master God would not even bat a single eyelid! She was clearly belittling him! Intolerable! Absolutely intolerable!</p><br/><p>Lin Fan contemplated for a moment. If he could have this Frost Master God f*cked over to death by the soap, then everything would be worth it.</p><br/><p>In that case, the number of experience points gained would be extremely astronomical. After that, even if he were to meet the Boundless Future Buddha Lord, he wouldn\u2019t have to fear the other party at all. In fact, he might even be able to slay him at that time.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Lin Fan did not think twice.</p><br/><p>\u201cGo on out, soap!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan tossed the soap out.</p><br/><p>Under normal circumstances, the Frost Master God would definitely pick up the soap, and with the slip of her hand, it would then drop down onto the ground.</p><br/><p>But all of a sudden, Lin Fan froze up.</p><br/><p>After he tossed out the soap, the Frost Master God did not even budge a single inch when a notification came forth from the System.</p><br/><p>\u2018Lin Brand\u2019s Soap cannot be used on the female sex. This is a gay item\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan heard the notification from the System, he was completely dumbfounded. Oh my god! What the flying shit! Did it really have to be this f*cked up? If it did not have a single use on the Frost Master God, how in the world was he supposed to escape?</p><br/><p>The soap flew back into Lin Fan\u2019s hand as he gave off an awkward laugh before holding onto it.</p><br/><p>But at that moment, Lin Fan thought of an idea! His eyes sparkled with a bright glint. \u2018That\u2019s right! I really have it now!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cFrost Master God, you swore that you will not kill me today. But, I did not swear that I will not kill you instead. If I were to strike out and you were to kill me, you\u2019d be disobeying your oath then, right?\u201d Lin Fan roared out in laughter before rubbing his hands together.</p><br/><p>He was ready to use his Twisting Heavens and Earth so that he could turn this Frost Master God into a male. By then, the Frost Master God would definitely be in tremendous pain, and would lose every single bit of fighting strength! Even if she didn\u2019t lose her will to fight, he would still have his backup plan with the Lin Brand\u2019s Soap!</p><br/><p>That was right!</p><br/><p>After coming up with this idea, Lin Fan sniggered out sinisterly.</p><br/><p>This was going to be a firm plan!</p></div>\n</div>"}

However, if someone were to ask them right now\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2018Who do you love most in this world?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Who do you want to present your body the most in this world?\u2019</p><br/><p>The unanimous answer would be that they would willingly give up their hearts and bodies for this peerlessly powerful man before them.</p><br/><p>One blow after another, these disciples were already on the brink of insanity. At that very last moment, they had already prepared themselves mentally to perish then and there.</p><br/><p>But who knew that things would take on such a dramatic turn.</p><br/><p>The noble posture of the powerful man before them would always be imprinted in their minds for the rest of their lives.</p><br/><p>\"SUPPRESS IT\u2026!!!!!!\"</p><br/><p>A loud roar erupted from Lin Fan. As though they had found a true home, the True Energy in the air culminated and surged into Lin Fan frantically. That all-encompassing giant palm was glowing even brighter right now.</p><br/><p>BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!</p><br/><p>The Heavens shook, while the Earth shuddered.</p><br/><p>A beam of light erupted from the void, as Heaven and Earth descended into a state of chaos.</p><br/><p>\"What strength\u2026\" All of the disciples laid flat on their sides while shuddering. The force was so immense that they couldn\u2019t even get up.</p><br/><p>This amount of power was enough to shock them out of their wits. Back in their respective sects, all of them were genius disciples as well. These were people who were afraid of nothing and no one in their sects, while looking down upon the rest of the world. But now that things had come to this, they finally understood what it meant by having a league out of one\u2019s own out in the world.</p><br/><p>That palm strike of True Energy covered the skies. Just like the Five-Fingered Mountain, it seemed to be able to bear the weight of the world on it, holding onto the ultimate shot of the Eternal Donger in its hand.</p><br/><p>\u2018GRAWHHHHHHHHH!\u2019</p><br/><p>Lin Fan pushed and grunted even louder. The palm strike moved steadily upwards, pushing past the layers of the void, and eventually striking hard onto the Eternal Donger.</p><br/><p>BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!</p><br/><p>A loud explosion ensued with a dull sound.</p><br/><p>Bursting out from the ground, Lin Fan bolted into the skies. The blanket of mini Eternal Dongers in the sky began to break apart. Slowly, these mini Eternal Dongers turned into bright glitters and disappeared into the skies.</p><br/><p>As for the main Eternal Donger? It was writhing. That stiff, long elephant nose started to soften. Blood started to ooze out from that black surface of the shaft.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan snorted coldly. If this weren\u2019t the time to do it, when would the time be?</p><br/><p>\u2018Balls Kicking.\u2019</p><br/><p>At first, Lin Fan had intended to use Twisting Heaven and Earth on it. But this Eternal Donger was simply too ugly for him to lay his hands on it. Therefore, he could only replace it with his leg. From this change in treatment attitude, one could tell how much Lin Fan looked down on this Eternal Donger.</p><br/><p>The skies which had regained its peace began to shudder once more.</p><br/><p>The rumbling of the True Energy in the air began to sound like little pops in the skies. One by one, they formed a chorus of popping sounds in the void.</p><br/><p>POP!</p><br/><p>A dull kick. There were no tragic cries this time round, just that dull popping sound.</p><br/><p>No matter how strong the Eternal Donger was, \u2018Balls Kicking\u2019 was a skill that revolted against heavenly rules. It was a skill without mercy. Disregarding any defense, its sole purpose was to doom one to the depths of hell.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026Balls Kicking experience points +10,000,000,000\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026Balls Kicking leveled up.

But to think that it would go to this extent! The crazy notifications from the system were already setting Lin Fan\u2019s mind off.</p><br/><p>How surreal was this?</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was dazed and stumped. True Origins Crushing Kick? What was that all about?</p><br/><p>But Lin Fan had no time to think about it. To think that this Eternal Donger still had the strength to be twitching after Balls Kicking?</p><br/><p>\"Heaven and Earth Smelt, take it in!\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan roared. By now, he was pretty familiar with how the smelt worked. No matter what it was, as long as he had touched it, he could bring it into the smelt. And if he couldn\u2019t touch it, then there was nothing the smelt could do about it.</p><br/><p>The Eternal Donger struggled, but Lin Fan was not daunted in the least bit. After all, even the Eternal Arm could be refined in the smelt. This donger stood no chance at all.</p><br/><p>\u2018Smelt!\u2019</p><br/><p>The Heaven and Earth Smelt churned. Lin Fan did not know what was happening within, but he could only imagine how unbearable the pain must be.</p><br/><p>Bang! Bang!</p><br/><p>Banging sounds came out from within the smelt. This must be the Eternal Donger\u2019s final attempts at struggling.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan\u2019s move had totally left everyone wide eyed.</p><br/><p>All the disciples just stood where they were, looking at this incredible smelt that had just popped out of thin air in the sky. From the smelt, they could sense an ancient and mysterious aura.</p><br/><p>Not only were there weird runes and markings embossed on the smelt, the drawings on the surface were curious as well.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026congratulations on refining Eternal Donger.\u2019</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smirked and opened the smelt.</p><br/><p>However, the moment it was opened, a thick black smoke gushed out from the smelt and shot at Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Momentarily shocked, he flicked his robes and contained the black smoke in his storage.</p><br/><p>Holy shit. To think that this huge donger would want to fuse with Yours Truly. Even though it was pretty darn strong, it was not worthy of Yours Truly. Some things were better left in their original forms.</p><br/><p>Looking at the Eternal Donger lying silently in his storage, Lin Fan let out a smirk. He would just keep it in there first and think of what he could do with it later.</p><br/><p>Now that everything was finally over, Lin Fan let out a sigh of relief.</p><br/><p>He swooped down from the skies and sat on the floor, huffing out heavily.</p><br/><p>What happened at the last second was that the Mythical Parasol Tree within him had activated at the last moment, rapidly sucking in all the True Energy of the world for him to use. If that had not happened, he might have truly died under the Eternal Donger\u2019s thick shot.</p><br/><p>But because of this, the Mythical Parasol Tree within him seemed to have gone down in size, as if it had taken some sort of tremendous blow.</p><br/><p>Seemed like he needed to be more mindful from now on. If this Mythical Parasol Tree was so powerful as a seedling, what would happen after it grew up?</p><br/><p>Lin Fan awaited that with anticipation.</p><br/><p>The stoned disciples hugged one another and bawled out. At long last, it was all over! Their lives were saved! Upon watching the powerful man descend, all of them rushed up in gratitude.</p><br/><p> \"Powerful man, thank you!\"</p><br/><p>\"I, Gao Song, shall regard you as my eternal benefactor!\"</p><br/><p>\"Boo hoo! This was the first time I\u2019ve felt so close to the death gods! If not for your presence, powerful man, we would have died long ago!\"</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>Towards the reverence of these disciples, Lin Fan could only chuckle. He then beckoned to the dumbstruck Yao Tian to come over.</p><br/><p>By now, Yao Tian had already lost his wits beyond anything else. His inner heart was in constant turmoil. From the start of all this, he had already lost all of his guts.</p><br/><p>\"Se\u2026senior!\" He stuttered, evidently recovering from the shock. Everything was way too horrifying than he could have ever imagined.</p><br/><p>By the looks of it, this man of horrifying strength must have requests of some sorts to have beckoned him over.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan rubbed his tummy. What a tiring battle that had all been. He was practically starving right now.</p><br/><p>\"You, go to the Dead Demon City and get me some food. Hurry up and don\u2019t waste time.\" Sitting there, Lin Fan ordered Yao Tian with just a mere gaze.</p><br/><p>\"Ah\u2026right, right!\" The stunned Yao Tian came back to his spirits.</p><br/><p>\"You guys, come over here and hammer on my shoulders. Massage my feet too while you\u2019re at it!\" Lin Fan ordered the rest of the disciples.</p><br/><p>Translator's Thoughts</p><br/><p>Lam Lam</p><br/><p>Hi guys! Yet another amazing chapter haha. Let me introduce some of the terms you all may be unfamiliar with. For the 5-fingered mountain, it\u2019s a reference to \u2018Journey to the West\u2019. This was the mountain that Buddha had imprisoned Sun Wukong under in that story. A mountain which could hold down anything in this world. Next, for our new skill, True Origins Crushing Kick. You may be thinking, why the word origins? In this case, they were referring more towards the origins of life and the likes of it in the raws haha. Also, I presume that the Eternal Donger has now ended up as a dildo inside Lin Fan\u2019s storage hahaha!</p><br/><p>Okay, and for this chapter, I would like to include the author\u2019s raw comments here because I think he is quite like Lin Fan in a way: \u201cSome people may claim that I have created this Eternal Donger to pollute the novel. But no, boys, no. Think about it. A donger is where the essence belongs to, where life originates from. The donger of an Ancient Being is therefore the most powerful body part of his entire body, isn\u2019t that right! And of course, Titties aren\u2019t gonna appear. The Ancient One is a male. How would Titties be useful to him? Not nutritious at all man.\u2019</p><br/><p>HAHAHA! So that\u2019s all from me here, cheers!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

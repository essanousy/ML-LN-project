How could this guy survive against that?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are the most impressive punching bag I have ever seen since I entered this sect.\u201d The light robed man said while laughing softly, after which his expression immediately changed. His previous mildly gently expression now became immensely fierce.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut, pure steel is easy to bend.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bam!</p><br/><p>Lin suffered another blow, as his body was sent flying and splatters of blood drifted through the air.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026 experience + 3000.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cHow refreshing,\u201d Lin Fan lied on the ground while feeling the experience increase, his heart almost bursting with excitement.</p><br/><p>The light robed man looked towards the collapsed Lin Fan, and a slight smile appeared on his mouth, \u201cA half powered strike of a third level precelestial\u2026 no matter how high his \u300aTitanium Grade Demon Body\u300b is, unfortunately, it won\u2019t be able to block that. But don\u2019t worry, you will not die as I also held back. Go, pick him up and come with me.</p><br/><p>The unparalleled pretty boy looked towards the collapsed Lin Fan, gloating as he said with satisfaction.</p><br/><p>\u201cCourting death.\u201d</p><br/><p>The light robed man turned around, preparing to leave. A talent capable of enduring a half powered strike of a third level precelestial\u2026 he wondered if senior-brother would be interested in recruiting him.</p><br/><p>The world contained numerous unusual people, to the point of being uncountable. The Saint Devil Sect has existed for thousands of years, what kind of disciples had it never seen before?</p><br/><p>This punching bag cultivated just the \u300aTitanium Grade Demon Body\u300b but managed to cultivate it to an even higher level. He undoubtedly was a talent, but this alone was not going to be enough.</p><br/><p>The light robed man already saw through him, this punching bag hadn\u2019t even reached the precelestial stage yet. In his eyes, he was merely a slightly special ant, nothing more than that.</p><br/><p>But at this moment, the light robed man\u2019s expression abruptly changed to that of slight disbelief.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, not bad, not bad\u2026 That was stronger than the previous one, but it\u2019s still not enough.\u201d Lin Fan once again stood up, brushing his chest, \u2018it was quite painful, but these kind of formidable free experience giving people were few. If I don\u2019t properly utilize this opportunity, in the future, I\u2019ll be full of regret of sure.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d The light robed man looked at Lin Fan in dismay, \u2018What was up with this guy? How could it be like this?\u2019</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the light robed man, feeling a trace of vulnerability. This counted as exposing himself. \u300aTitanium Grade Demon Body\u300b had a total of three levels, and it was impossible to defend against an expert precelestial\u2019s strike. But he had now let this guy beat himself to raise the experience of \u300aTitanium Grade Demon Body\u300b, which was also all to attain the power to defend himself.</p><br/><p>If he were to follow this light robed man, who knew what would happen; whether he would end up dead or alive was uncertain. The punching bags were not yet official disciples of the sect, and no one would care about their life or death.</p><br/><p>So Lin Fan would have to struggle and take his own chances. Since other people didn\u2019t find him special, he would then prove it himself.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, let\u2019s just see how long you can endure.\u201d The light robed man\u2019s momentum surged, as a full force precelestial strike slammed against Lin Fan\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026 experience + 4000.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026 congratulations \u300aTitanium Grade Demon Body\u300b leveled up.\u2019</p><br/><p>Currently, Lin Fan was ecstatic to the point of flying. This level up was way too fast; enduring a few hits and the result was a level up. Moreover, this experience treasure-trove even slowly raised his cultivation base, assisting his own efforts and allowing his experience to skyrocket.</p><br/><p>If the light robed man had used the full power of an eighth level precelestial from the start, even if his \u300aTitanium Grade Demon Body\u300b were at the seventh level, he would have immediately reduced to nothing.</p><br/><p>Seeing Lin Fan stand up once again, the light robed man\u2019s previous calm demeanor was now steadily becoming furious. He felt a sense of shame, and even though he was withholding his cultivation base and this guy was beaten to the point of spitting blood, nonetheless, he repeatedly stood up again and again. It was actually becoming unbearable now.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright then, I refuse to believe this superstition.\u201d The light robed man flared up.</p><br/><p>Seeing the light robed man flare up, Lin Fan felt even more delighted inside.</p><br/><p>\u2018Refusing to believe this superstition\u2026 that\u2019s right, wait until the end. Even if you don\u2019t believe, I will make you believe.\u2019</p><br/><p>Bam!</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was sent flying once again.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026 experience + 5000\u2019</p><br/><p>He stood up again.</p><br/><p>Bam!</p><br/><p>Sent flying again.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026 experience + 6000\u2019</p><br/><p>Bam!</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026 experience + 6000.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026 congratulations \u300aTitanium Grade Demon Body\u300b leveled up.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy can you still stand?\u201d The light robed man was slowly unable to maintain his demeanor. Because of Lin Fan who stood up again and again, his confidence was now deeply shaken and his ego offended.</p><br/><p>The unparalleled pretty boy on the side was completely dumbfounded, standing there entirely motionless as if he had seen a ghost.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome...\u201d Lin Fan beckoned with his finger, not wanting to say anything more.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn it, I refuse to believe\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI also can\u2019t believe, so you have to prove it yourself.\u201d Lin Fan looked at the light robed man and said comfortingly.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn it, in that case, let\u2019s see how you stand against my full power.\u201d The light robed man was also angered by Lin Fan. No matter what, he was just a young man in his twenties, so naturally he still possessed a bit of youthful arrogance.</p><br/><p>His years of training, at this moment, also disintegrated into a complete mess.</p><br/><p>Upon hearing the words \u2018full power\u2019, Lin Fan immediately jolted and was slightly scared.</p><br/><p>\u2018Don\u2019t mess around. A full powered strike of an eighth level precelestial\u2026 that would utterly decimate me into pieces.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cLight robed senior-brother, no so fast\u2026 You were just at third level precelestial. Now should be fourth level precelestial\u2026 one step at a time, you must not skip.\u201d Lin Fan shouted in a hurry.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan already had a plan in mind, if the other party still insisted upon using full strength, he would definitely kneel down and admit defeat. He couldn\u2019t be reduced to a dog just like that.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, a half-powered strike of a fourth level precelestial. Let\u2019s see how you defend against that.\u201d The light robed man roared and his body twisted. From the start to the moment of attack, Lin Fan didn\u2019t realize just how the light robed man carried out the move.</p><br/><p>\u2018Fast...it\u2019s too fast.\u2019</p><br/><p>Bam!</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was sent flying again. This time, Lin Fan was not immersed in the euphoric feeling of his ever increasing experience but was instead thinking about a problem. It seemed there was a need for him to re-evaluate the disciples of the Saint Devil Sect, and this piece of intelligence was a bit moving.</p><br/><p>At this point, Lin Fan looked towards the light robed man and couldn\u2019t help but feel a bit of love. Of course, this was an appreciative type of love, \u2018If more talents like him were to appear, in the future, what was there to worry about?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026 experience + 7000\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cGood, senior brother's strike made my blood circulation flip, throwing up a pot of blood, but it\u2019s not enough, again.\u201d Lin Fan wiped his mouth as if he were merely just eating and then refusing to pay.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn it, how can you still stand? I will let you experience my full power.\u201d The light robed man\u2019s long black hair flowed along with the wind.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, light robed senior-brother, you just used a half-powered strike of a fourth level precelestial. Now should be its full-forced strike\u2026 One step at a time, slowly\u2026 You must not go back on your word.\u201d Lin Fan shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright...\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing this, Lin Fan secretly wiped his tear, \u2018how touching!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026 experience + 8000\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026 congratulations \u300aTitanium Grade Demon Body\u300b leveled up.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026 experience + 9000\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026 experience + 10000\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026 congratulations \u300aTitanium Grade Demon Body\u300b leveled up.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding, congratulations \u300aTitanium Grade Demon Body\u300b leveled up.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding, congratulations \u300aTitanium Grade Demon Body\u300b leveled up.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Fourth level precelestial stage half-powered strike\u2026</p><br/><p>Fourth level precelestial stage full-forced strike\u2026</p><br/><p>Fifth level precelestial stage\u2026</p><br/><p>Sixth level precelestial stage\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>By this time, the unparalleled pretty boy was long on the ground with white foam frothing from his mouth, his entire body twitching.</p><br/><p>\u2018Impossible, this is completely possible.\u2019</p><br/><p>But at this time\u2026</p><br/><p>The light robed man had his black hair a mess, his two eyes completely red and his expression brutal.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh!!! Why can you still stand?\u201d The light robed man\u2019s demeanor had collapsed entirely, one strike after another raining down upon Lin Fan\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026 experience + 1000.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026 experience + 1000.\u2019</p><br/><p>Lin Fan sighed and looked at his character data.</p><br/><p>Name: Lin Fan</p><br/><p>Level: 9 (Precelestial stage waiting to be unlocked)</p><br/><p>Experience points: (0/1000)</p><br/><p>Martial Skills: \u300aTitanium Grade Demon Body\u300b 18th Level (0/1000000)</p><br/><p>\u300aMonkey Steals Peach\u300b 10th level (1000/10000)</p><br/><p>Lin Fan felt that he went a bit too far, really too far.</p><br/><p>The light robed senior-brother had long used the full power of his eighth level precelestial stage, but the current Lin Fan was entirely immune to it.</p><br/><p>Seeing the light robed senior-brother crazily beat him, Lin Fan could only endure the attacks and wait for after his heart to resign and him to quiet down.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

If he hadn\u2019t reacted in time, he would have really fallen under that move.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean underhanded? Senior brother, my technique is completely just and proper, though senior brother\u2019s last hit on me left my chest still hurts a bit, but I still have a technique left that I would like senior brother to advise me on.\u201d Naturally, Lin Fan wouldn\u2019t admit that his technique was underhanded. \u2018Though \u300aMonkey Steals Peach\u300b was a dubious technique, under Yours Truly, it will become upright and just.\u2019</p><br/><p>And just now, Lin Fan realized that the growth of \u300aMonkey Steals Peach\u300b was still very high.</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior brother, I would also like you to advise on this technique 18 Palms of the Dragon.\u201d Lin Fan gave a cackle, moving to his own rhythm and giving an exuberant display as he rushed forth at Yu Feng. And just when Lin Fan rushed right in front of Yu Feng, he leaned down and shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cMonkey Steals Peach.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Feng was surprised and struck forth again.</p><br/><p>\u201cNinth Turn of Mixed Element\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Bam!\u2019</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was sent flying away again.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026 congratulations \u300aEternal Demon Body\u300b experience + 6000.\u2019</p><br/><p>Lin Fan immediately got up upon hitting the ground, Yu Feng had suppressed his cultivation base to a ninth level precelestial, so one strike could only provide 6000 experience. Facing \u300aEternal Demon Body\u300b with an experience requirement of three million, this was essentially worthless. He needed to make him raise his cultivation base to maximize the benefits.</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior brother, I have been stuck at ninth level precelestial for many days and haven\u2019t been able to break through. Would senior brother please raise his cultivation base up to the third level postcelestial, so that way I can be pressured a bit.\u201d Lin Fan shouted.</p><br/><p>Yu Feng looked at Lin Fan and was momentarily speechless. The previous two times, Yu Feng had already been angered. But upon hearing this, he also felt that punishment was in order. The only issue was that his seniors were currently sitting up on the top watching, and if something were to happen, it would be difficult to explain.</p><br/><p>\u201cJunior brother, if I do that I am afraid there will be casualties.\u201d Yu Feng said. \u201cLife and death are common on the path to cultivation, so I would ask senior brother to accept my request.\u201d Lin Fan said with righteousness and without any fear.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, in that case, junior brother should be careful.\u201d Yu Feng gave a slight cold smile. Since he was seeking death himself, no one could blame him for what happened next.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan glanced at Yu Feng, \u2018As expected of an inner sect disciple, he is likely a veteran compared to these simple-minded outer sect disciples\u2026 the difference is like heaven and earth.\u2019</p><br/><p>After entering the inner sect, one would be able to go out, train and experience many things, causing even the personality to change. And upon entering postcelestial stage, one could also protect themselves outside. After all, the ones who hadn\u2019t entered postcelestials were just mere ants on the path of true cultivation.</p><br/><p>The Saint Devil sect didn\u2019t allow outer sect disciples to leave the sect grounds in order to protect them. And the inner sect was essentially part of the sect\u2019s core so they would be involved in more matters, and thus, have more experience.</p><br/><p>At that time, the senior sitting on the upper podium\u2019s stone seat narrowed his eyes, somewhat interested.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan then felt Yu Feng\u2019s presence grow. If one just compared power alone, the suppressed third level postcelestial Yu Feng was more than enough to send him flying. Though he had the protection of the \u300aEternal Demon Body\u300b, one strike from a third level postcelestial was still enough to make him cough up a potful.</p><br/><p>However, Lin Fan was not afraid at all, a mere third level postcelestial wasn\u2019t enough to kill him.</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior brother, take this, Buddha's Divine Palm! This is a legendary technique from the heavens.\u201d Lin Fan causally said, then bent his legs and jumped towards the sky with a loud sound.</p><br/><p>\u201cCompletely fake.\u201d Yu Feng muttered in his heart without paying any heed to the charade. Lin Fan, who was currently in the sky, became a little hurt upon seeing Yu Feng looking indifferent. As expected of an old timer, he was not falling for it at all. Lin Fan was in no hurry, as he refused to believe there wouldn\u2019t be moment where the opponent would falter.</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior brother, take this\u2026\u201d Lin Fan warned.</p><br/><p>Yu Feng\u2019s eyelids slightly moved and when Lin Fan drew near, he struck out. Lin Fan felt his chest become hot as the power was far stronger than the previous ones, and was sent flying away, crashing to the ground.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026 congratulations \u300aEternal Demon Body\u300b experience + 30000.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cPu\u2026\u201d Lin Fan spat forth a mouthful of blood. It really was strong, the difference between precelestial and postcelestial was indeed on an entirely different level.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was completely unable to see Yu Feng\u2019s movements.</p><br/><p>Precelestial was blood energy while postcelestial was true energy.</p><br/><p>And Lin Fan also felt a fierce flow of red true energy enter into his body, but the true energy was instantly absorbed not long after it rampaged about a little.</p><br/><p>Han Lu upon became utterly delighted seeing Lin Fan\u2019s condition, he was completely asking for it after all. But when he saw Lin Fan stand up, he became startled and in disbelief.</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior brother, that strike was very strong\u2026 I was completely unable to see it\u2026 Again\u2026\u201d Lin Fan gave a small sigh and said.</p><br/><p>Yu Feng was in disbelief that he was still able to stand up. That strike just now was suppressed, but it still shouldn\u2019t be something a precelestial could withstand.</p><br/><p>Yu Feng stepped forth with his momentum turning ferocious, \u201cWell then, junior brother is indeed surprising. I will just have to see what kind of moves junior brother has.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReturn of Thousand Swords.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan, of course, didn\u2019t know any of these moves. He was merely borrowing the name of techniques from novels to set off the mood. But the outer sect disciples off stage were watching in excitement, feeling that junior brother Lin had quite a good naming sense.</p><br/><p>Just what the hell was this \u201cReturn of Thousand Swords\u201d? Yu Feng obviously knew it was a bluff, so he naturally wasn\u2019t deceived.</p><br/><p>\u2018Bam!\u2019</p><br/><p>Yu Feng instantly caught Lin Fan\u2019s arm and sent him flying, not even giving him the slightest room for resistance.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026 congratulations \u300aEternal Demon Body\u300b experience + 40000.\u2019</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was sent flying into the sky, but his heart raced faster and faster. As expected, death brought no limits, continually pushing the limits was the way to go. This feeling of rapidly increasing experience was really the best.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, senior brother is strong. I am in full admiration. Again\u2026\u201d Lin Fan\u2019s momentum became stronger and stronger, fiercer and fiercer with each strike. Lin Fan\u2019s previously lightly colored robe became gradually splattered with blood.</p><br/><p>The previously rowdy outer sect disciples off stage became quiet one by one, not daring to believe the maniac on stage. He was already that injured, yet he was still like that?</p><br/><p>Yin Mo Chen was currently worried, \u2018Junior brother is far too rash. If this continues, he will really die.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior brother take this, Returning Energy of Three.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Bam!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026 congratulations \u300aEternal Demon Body\u300b experience + 40000.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior brother take this, North Star Sacred Arts.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Bam!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026 congratulations \u300aEternal Demon Body\u300b experience + 40000.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>At that point, the surrounding audience were utterly stunned and speechless as they saw Lin Fan engage in an endless cycle of falling to the ground and rising up, seemingly without any signs of stopping.</p><br/><p>Although Lin Fan was repeatedly beaten, his spirit of standing up yet, again and again, left even the inner sect disciples deeply surprised.</p><br/><p>Yu Feng was currently stunned.</p><br/><p>\u2018Bam!\u2019</p><br/><p>Yu Feng struck out again, but this time Lin Fan wasn\u2019t sent flying. \u201cSenior brother\u2026\u201d Lin Fan\u2019s hand grasped onto the arm of Yu Feng.</p><br/><p>\u201cPhew.\u201d Lin Fan opened his mouth, and a pool of blood surged forth.</p><br/><p>\u201cJunior brother, enough.\u201d Yu Feng was moved at this point.</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior brother, to be able to spar against a master like you, I\u2026phew\u2026I am fully satisfied.\u201d Lin Fan threw up twice already in that one sentence.</p><br/><p>\u201cJunior brother, this is a blood circulation pill. Eat it, and it will stabilize your injury.\u201d Although Lin Fan\u2019s cultivation base was low, he had taken on so many of Yu Feng\u2019s attacks that even he couldn\u2019t remember the number. And every time he was able to stand up, his willpower left even Yu Feng in admiration.</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior brother\u2026I\u2026\u201d Lin Fan initially wanted to refuse and instead just say some emotional words, but then suddenly changed his mind.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026 discovered rare healing medicinal pill, \u201cBlood circulation pill, after ingestion, experience + 100000.\u2019</p><br/><p>\"Thank you, senior brother.\u201d Lin Fan weakly raised his hand and brought the blood-red blood circulation pill to his mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cJunior brother, just based on your willpower alone, there will definitely be a place for you in the inner sect in the future.\u201d Yu Feng praised without any hesitation. This was the first time Yu Feng ever gave an outer sect disciple such a high evaluation.</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior brother\u2026\u201d Lin Fan looked gratefully at Yu Feng and then slowly opened up his arms, wanting to embrace Yu Feng.</p><br/><p>Yu Feng paused, then a slight smile appeared on his handsome face, \u2018Since junior brother wishes to embrace me I will grant him that wish.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior brother\u2026\u201d Lin Fan called softly.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior-brother, I will return today\u2019s favor in the future.\u201d Lin Fan\u2019s previous grayed out eyes began to gradually brighten, but Yu Feng didn\u2019t notice them.</p><br/><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter\u2026 it was just a mere blood circulation pill. Junior brother, rest up your body. I will wait for you in the inner sect.\u201d Yu Feng said.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that.\u201d Lin Fan slightly shook his head.</p><br/><p>\"What is it then?\u201d Yu Feng asked puzzled.</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior brother\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes\u2026\u201d Yu Feng quietly said in confusion.</p><br/><p>\u201cMonkey Steals Peach\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment the sky changed as if it were the end of the world.</p><br/><p>Life was full of shortcuts after all\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

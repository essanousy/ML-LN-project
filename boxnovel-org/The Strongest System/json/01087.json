Now that they were engaged in a battle, it did invoke a reminiscent feeling of how they had once fought years ago for a single treasure.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhite Saint, you\u2019ve got to watch out. That disciple of my sect has already entered the Kunlun God Sect. Perhaps your entire Kunlun God Sect might be in a state of chaos by now!\u201d Geng Yangtian\u2019s strikes were sharp, and he was assaulting through words as well to strike some nervousness into the other\u2019s mental state.</p><br/><p>However, in case of a powerful being at White Saint\u2019s state, how could he find his mental state rattled that easily? Naturally, he did not pay heed to the words of Geng Yangtian.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph! The foundation of the Kunlun God Sect is deep. Do you really think that there\u2019s no one left in my entire Kunlun God Sect?\u201d Of course, White Saint had faith in those Vice Grandmasters and the elders back in the sect. With them around, that lad might very well be suppressed if he had dared to do anything brazen.</p><br/><p>As for the battle between him and Geng Yangtian, he would definitely not let up until there was a clear victor.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>When the surrounding beings caught sight of Lin Fan, they started conversing in hushed whispers.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust what in the world happened? That lad has come out of the Kunlun God Sect.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCould it be that the Kunlun God Sect has no way of taking down that lad?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI think there\u2019s a high chance he was blocked off by them. Even though the topmost powerful beings of the Kunlun God Sect had already come out, there are still quite a number of powerful beings back in the sect similar to Tai Qiantian.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe must be returning with disappointment then. However, the situation has already spiraled to a state that\u2019s hard to recover from by now. This battle between the Immortal Kings is no longer something he can manipulate or have any control over.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>When Han Juntian caught sight of Lin Fan, he rushed forth immediately. He did not know just what the situation was like right now. However, when he caught sight of Lin Fan, he did not know what he should say any longer. This lad was way too good at causing trouble. For everything that was happening right now, who was going to be held responsible?</p><br/><p>A battle between the Senior Old Masters was no longer something of their level.</p><br/><p>The void was exploding, shattering into pieces. The void currents were swirling out, ripping the entire world apart.</p><br/><p>Anyone who was dragged into a battle of this level would most likely be shredded into pieces by the formidable aftershock before they could even get a chance to fight at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did you head over to the Kunlun God Sect for?\u201d Han Juntian asked.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled, \u201cI did something big. Right now, it\u2019s time to negotiate with them, Grandmaster. Now, what do you think I should ask for later on?\u201d</p><br/><p>Initially, Lin Fan had wanted to use the soap to f*ck over a few of them again. But, the current situation did not seem as though he would get a chance for his soap to make a play.</p><br/><p>There were so many Senior Old Masters of the Kunlun God Sect around. Not only that, they must definitely have made some preparations against him. There was no way all of these Senior Old Masters would let him f*ck them over so easily.</p><br/><p>Without a hundred percent confidence, Lin Fan would not just experiment for fun.</p><br/><p>This was a Legendary Weapon! It would be fine if it at least succeeded. But if not, he would have taken a huge loss!</p><br/><p>Right now, Lin Brand\u2019s Soap was his greatest killer weapon. No matter the sort of powerful being he would come across, he could absolutely knock the other party sprawling over.</p><br/><p>Han Juntian looked over at Lin Fan, not knowing what this lad had just done. However, by the look of his face, it seemed as though it was truly something big. Because of that, his heart was extremely curious as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust what sort of a big thing have you done this time around? Also, what\u2019s up with this negotiation or something as well?\u201d By now, Han Juntian was truly impressed with Lin Fan. This war between the Kunlun God Sect and the Heaven and Earth Sect was something that was never meant to have happened in the first place. But now that things had already reached this stage, wanting to change them was probably going to be impossible.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, a fight between the Old Masters of the Heaven and Earth Sect and Kunlun God Sect was not something they had the power to stop.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed out mysteriously, \u201cYou\u2019ll find out in a bit.\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, Lin Fan raised his head into the void and yelled out, \u201cAll of you, stop it\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>But what pissed Lin Fan off was the fact that no one gave a single bit of sh*t about him at all! The fight between the Kunlun God Sect and the Heaven and Earth Sect was still going on as the void crackled out in explosions, almost being destroyed entirely by this duel.</p><br/><p>\u201cOld Master, don\u2019t fight anymore! There\u2019s no point to it any longer! Right now, it\u2019s time to negotiate!\u201d Lin Fan yelled out again.</p><br/><p>\u201cHoly f*ck!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s still no one giving a single f*ck about me!\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, Lin Fan was truly angered as he let out the Heaven and Earth Smelt.</p><br/><p>\u201cKUNLUN GOD SECT! YOU HAD BETTER F*CKING STOP THAT RIGHT NOW! OR DO YOU GUYS WANT YOUR ENTIRE SECT TO BE ANNIHILATED?\u201d Lin Fan roared out. Thereafter, feeling as though he had used up quite a bit of strength, he whipped out a bunch of pills and stuffed them right into his mouth, chomping them happily.</p><br/><p>But now that his cultivation state had already been leveled to the Immortal Lord state, these Immortal Pills could hardly give him any bit of experience points. This was something that gave Lin Fan a huge headache.</p><br/><p>Uproar!</p><br/><p>When the Heaven and Earth Smelt was let out, the entire scene was filled with an uproar! All the disciples of the Kunlun God Sect who were stuck inside were slamming out at its sides, wanting to get out of it. And yet, there was no use to it at all!</p><br/><p>The Heaven and Earth Smelt was a product of the System, not something that could be broken apart so mother*cking easily!</p><br/><p>When White Saint, who was locked in battle with Geng Yangtian, caught sight of this, his entire mental state got rattled. His eyes then widened furiously as he repelled Geng Yangtian away with his palm.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow could this\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>When Geng Yangtian caught sight of that smelt, he was stumped as well.</p><br/><p>Unbelievable! This was simply way too unbelievable!</p><br/><p>Was the reason why that lad had infiltrated into the Kunlun God Sect just to kidnap all of their disciples?</p><br/><p>Lin Fan rested his palm on top of the Heaven and Earth Smelt, \u201cNow, fellow Senior Old Masters of the Kunlun God Sect\u2026 we can finally have a talk.\u201d</p><br/><p>White Saint spun his head around instantly and glared over at the Kunlun God Sect in the distance, unable to sense a single trace of life from within.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhite Saint Old Trash, don\u2019t bother looking anymore. All of the Kunlun God Sect disciples are right here and locked by me in this smelt. If you don\u2019t wish for your Kunlun God Sect to be annihilated entirely, it\u2019s best for us to have a good talk instead.\u201d Lin Fan chuckled out.</p><br/><p>\u201cYOU\u2026!\u201d White Saint was so enraged that his entire chest puffed up, as though he could not withstand this blow at all.</p><br/><p>All the surrounding spectators exploded in discussion at this moment as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cHorrifying! To think that this fella would have turned the entire Kunlun God Sect into a hotpot! This is way too horrifying, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are several dozens of thousands of disciples n the Kunlun God Sect! How did he do it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot only that, in there are all the elders and Vice Grandmasters as well! There\u2019s no way they would just sit by idly! Could this fella have just mowed them over without any of them being able to put up a fight against him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s truly the case, the strength of this fella must be way too terrifying isn\u2019t it?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cHAHAHA\u2026!\u201d Geng Yangtian roared out in laughter, \u201cUnimaginable! Truly unimaginable! To think that a single disciple could have created a scene as such today! Since when had the Heaven and Earth Sect ever produced such an impressive feat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSuppressing the Kunlun God Sect and throwing them all together like a hotpot? This is the most glorious feat of the Heaven and Earth Sect\u2019s history!\u201d</p><br/><p>Geng Yangtian was truly laughing out in excitement right now. Even though the differences between the Kunlun God Sect and the Heaven and Earth Sect weren\u2019t all that deep, they were somewhat set in stone by the time both sects became a part of the nine sects. While there hadn\u2019t been any major conflicts, there had indeed been countless small ones. But, now that a single disciple of the Heaven and Earth Sect disciple had managed to toss the entire Kunlun God Sect into a hotpot, this was way too scary, wasn\u2019t it?</p><br/><p>\u201cAm I impressive or what\u2026?\u201d Lin Fan raised his head while asking.</p><br/><p>\u201cImpressive indeed!\u201d Geng Yangtian wasn\u2019t the slightest bit stingy in his praises. After all, he could not deny that everything that Lin Fan had done was impressive.</p><br/><p>Acts as such, who else could have pulled them off?</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled out gleefully, \u201cIf I were to become the Grandmaster, the Heaven and Earth Sect would definitely skyrocket. Do you believe that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Geng Yangtian was stunned for a moment before chuckling out, \u201cLet\u2019s leave that matter aside first and settle the one right in front of us.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, Geng Yangtian\u2019s gaze was locked onto White Saint while his lips curled into a smile.</p><br/><p>That was one hell of a smug smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhite Saint, even though there was no clear victor between us, you can\u2019t deny that after you, there is no one in your entire Kunlun God Sect that\u2019s even a match for this disciple of my sect. Do you admit defeat now\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>White Saint looked at everything before him. Even though he was indignant in his heart, the situation right now was truly sticky.</p><br/><p>As for Lin Fan, HE was indignant as well. If he didn\u2019t become the Grandmaster, who else would be the Grandmaster? If he were to be the Grandmaster, all the disciples would definitely be brought into an extremely spectacular and magnificent life. How wonderful would that be?</p></div>\n</div>"}

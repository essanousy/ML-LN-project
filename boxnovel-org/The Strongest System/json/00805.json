Do you have many things that you wish to tell me about?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan walked out from the void and peered left and right. This was truly the first time he was here at this place. However, the thing that struck Lin Fan was the fact that there was another old man beside the old man!</p><br/><p>However, on second thought, it was only right that he would seek a partner, since it was lonely living alone.</p><br/><p>\"And this is your disciple? He's a talent indeed.\" The old man beside Feng Qingzi sized up Lin Fan from head to toe before speaking out.</p><br/><p>He had only heard about this disciple from Feng Qingzi before. He was especially startled when he heard that this disciple could create an earthshattering ruckus in front of the Utmost Beings of the Ancient race.</p><br/><p>Out of all the beings of the thousands of races, only the four Guardians of the Guarded Grounds could pit themselves against the Utmost Beings with their lives.</p><br/><p>While there were definitely other powerful beings with a formidable cultivation state, they were still far from being able to go up against the Utmost Beings.</p><br/><p>Of course, that was unless they were like the Fire Water Empress, who had a matchless potential without requiring the Eternal God Seat. But, how many savants like that could exist in this world?</p><br/><p>\"Hahaha! I'm no talent! I'm a prodigy! Old man, where has my dear Cruel gone to?\" Lin Fan chuckled out.</p><br/><p>\"Lad, you had better tell me honestly. What happened in the end? How is Saint now?\"</p><br/><p>Feng Qingzi did not reply to Lin Fan's question. Instead, he asked solemnly.</p><br/><p>This was a matter of imperative importance to Feng Qingzi.</p><br/><p>\"Oh, you wish to know?\" Lin Fan grinned out. At this moment, he had thought up of a good idea, \"Well, recently, I have been pretty lacking in Shengyang Pills. If only\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"Here. These are all the Shengyang Pills that Your Revered Master has.\"</p><br/><p>Without any hesitation, Feng Qingzi stretched out his hands as a Shengyang Pills river flowed out. Within it, multiple Shengyang Pills Dragons roared out and bolted out of his sleeves.</p><br/><p>\"Old man, you're so generous!\" Lin Fan was stunned. To think that this old man, Feng Qingzi, would be this generous before he had even finished his sentence! This was something that had him a little taken aback.</p><br/><p>With just a casual count, Lin Fan counted a trillion Shengyang Pills. This was something way too startling for Lin Fan!</p><br/><p>\"Alright, stop beating around the bush now. Hurry up and tell me.\" Feng Qingzi was feeling pained right now. That trillion Shengyang Pills was his entire life's savings!</p><br/><p>For all these years, other than the expenses of the Guarded Ground, this was all that he had managed to save up in the end.</p><br/><p>Even though Lin Fan did not say anything much on the front, he was secretly extremely grateful for this old man. Without hiding the truth, he spoke up right after.</p><br/><p>\"Regarding Saint, I've already killed him. I've also obtained the Ancient Saint Sacrificial Altar.\"</p><br/><p>\"Indeed!\"</p><br/><p>Feng Qingzi exchanged glances with the other old man. The guesses in their hearts had finally been affirmed! At the same time, they heaved a sigh of relief in their hearts.</p><br/><p>\"Dear good disciple, you truly gave Your Revered Master a great shock! What about that Eternal God Seat? You must have taken it, right?\"</p><br/><p>For Feng Qingzi, while it was naturally exhilarating to know that an Utmost Being of the Ancient race had been killed, the most important thing was still that Eternal God Seat.</p><br/><p>\"Huehue. Take a look at what this is.\"</p><br/><p>Instantly, the Ancient One appeared beside Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>The moment the Ancient One appeared, a formidable aura erupted forth.</p><br/><p>The expression of Feng Qingzi and the old man tensed up. They were instantly alarmed. However, they relaxed soon after.</p><br/><p>\"This\u2026!\" When Feng Qingzi looked at the Ancient race being before him, he could not help but gaze in wonder.</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan caught sight of the stupefied expression of both old men, he could not help but chuckle out.</p><br/><p>\"This is the Ancient One, the Utmost Being of the Ancient race from 10,000 years ago. However, he has already been subjugated by me.\" Lin Fan explained.</p><br/><p>Now that there were two Utmost Beings in his hands, this was a formidable force all on its own. Even if they were to face up with the Utmost Beings of the Ancient race, they would have a chance of winning.</p><br/><p>\"Great! This is simply way too great!\"</p><br/><p>Feng Qingzi yelled out, feeling extremely heartened. This was the most invigorating news they had had for the past 10,000 years!</p><br/><p>\"That's for sure. You can set your mind at ease towards anything I am to do. This time around, because of the Ancient Saint Sacrificial Altar, I made a trip back down to the Xuanhuang World. Right now, I've already cultivated the entire Xuanhuang World under me. I'm now nurturing the first batch of powerful beings within them. It's just that when I headed back up, I bumped into the Heaven's Will.\" Lin Fan continued.</p><br/><p>\"Heaven's Will.\"</p><br/><p>When Feng Qingzi heard this, his face could not help but turn stern.</p><br/><p>\"Given our strength right now, it's an even fight against the Utmost Beings of the Ancient race. However, the crux of the problem lies with the Heaven's Will now.\"</p><br/><p>\"That time around, I found out from the mouths of the Utmost Beings that the Guarded Grounds were only a place that was granted a brief respite of life for the beings of the thousands of races from the Heaven's Will. Once the Heaven's Will truly awakens, it's probable that the Guarded Grounds would cease to exist as well.\" Feng Qingzi replied.</p><br/><p>\"Why would that be?\"</p><br/><p>This was the first time Lin Fan was hearing about this. From what he had known, he had always thought that the Guarded Grounds were a reprieve from death and the dangers out there. To think that this reprieve would be granted by the Heaven's Will!</p><br/><p>\"Once the Infinite Worlds are to open up, what does the Heaven's Will stand to gain from it?\" Lin Fan asked.</p><br/><p>\"This is a question that has too many factors involved in it. However, at the very beginning of it all, the Infinite Worlds were a universe without any life within it. However, the Heaven's Will of the Ancient Saint World had already existed at that time. In order to strengthen himself, the Heaven's Will of the Ancient Saint World had allowed the Infinite Worlds to start breeding life of its own. At the same time, each time the Law of the universe was fully refined and completed, the Heaven's Will of the Ancient Saint World would devour the Infinite Worlds at the prime moment. At that time, he would break through his own personal barrier and transcend to a higher state.\"</p><br/><p>\"A long, long time ago, we could even trace it back to the chaotic riots of the Old Ancient Times, the beings of the thousands of races did not have to ascend at that time. The Ancient Saint World was filled with Ancient race beings. At that time, there were powerful beings that reigned supreme over their various worlds. When the Heaven's Will wanted to devour the Infinite Worlds, it was met with immense resistance. While the Heaven's Will might have failed back then, the powerful beings who survived were barely a handful. At the same time, because the Heaven's Will had expended way too much, he set down a rule right before he entered that deep slumber to prevent something as such from happening once more. All the beings of the Infinite Worlds, as long as their cultivation states hit a certain state, they would have to ascend.\"</p><br/><p>\"This was to ensure that the strength of the thousands of races remained in a feeble and weak state continuously. At the same time, this would allow the Ancient race beings to massacre and devour the living beings in order to strengthen themselves.\"</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan heard Feng Qingzi's explanations, everything became clear all of a sudden.</p><br/><p>So, this guy was just learning from his mistakes right now!</p><br/><p>It seemed like the Heaven's Will of the Ancient Saint World was once a dumbf*ck as well. But after that failure, he had decided to amend the rules.</p><br/><p>Seemed like the Heaven's Will of the Ancient Saint World had to succeed this time around for sure.</p><br/><p>But for Lin Fan, no matter if the Heavens were to topple down or the Earth were to be overturned, anyone who dared to act audaciously before him would be trampled down.</p><br/><p>\"So, that's the case. But old man, where's my Cruel?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan asked.</p><br/><p>\"Lad, couldn't you like give some suggestions or whatnot? Your Cruel is here with me, don't worry.\" Feng Qingzi's speech earlier on was quite solemn. He had thought that this lad would give out a well-thought response to it. To think that this lad was entirely uninterested! This had Feng Qingzi feeling a little exasperated.</p><br/><p>\"No matter how much we plan out or think about it right now, what use would that be? During the riots of the Old Ancient Times back then, did you experience it all personally?\" Lin Fan asked.</p><br/><p>\"No. I've heard this from the previous generation.\" Feng Qingzi replied.</p><br/><p>\"See, isn't that that then? Old man, let me tell you. People these days are gossipmongers. One will spread to ten, ten will spread to hundreds\u2026 At the end of the rumor spreading, everything will sound extremely horrific. So, you don't have to think too much about it. When the matter comes to hand, we'll deal with it then. When that time TRULY comes, we'll give it a good thought about what to do.\" Lin Fan waved his hand dismissively and shrugged it off.</p><br/><p>\"I've got to bring my Cruel out with me now. I'm in dire need of Shengyang Pills recently. I've got to find some powerful beings and have them dedicate their lives to cultivating Shengyang Pills for me.\"</p><br/><p>Right now, that was the only thought in Lin Fan's mind, finding some powerful beings and purifying them forcefully, so that they would cultivate out Shengyang Pills for him all day all night.</p><br/><p>And at the same time, he would rob some powerful beings of the Ancient race and swipe them entirely clean. Once he had accumulated enough Shengyang Pills, that would truly be the time when he would really soar.</p><br/><p>\"Alright, alright. I'm gonna head out soon. By the looks of it, these Guarded Grounds are not going to be safe for much longer as well. Are you chummy with the other three Guardians of the Guarded Grounds?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan asked.</p><br/><p>\"Why would you ask that?\" Feng Qingzi returned the question.</p><br/><p>\"If you're chummy with them, then talk to them and have them contribute some Shengyang Pills! If you're not, then I've got to scam them out of it.\" Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>Feng Qingzi stared wide-eyed at this disciple before him. He then shook his head silently, \"Not too chummy.\"</p><br/><p>\"O-oi\u2026!\"</p><br/><p>The moment Feng Qingzi was done with his words, Lin Fan left immediately.</p><br/><p>\"This lad! Gosh, he really doesn't know anything about respect at all.\" Looking at how that lad left without a single word, Feng Qingzi was left pretty speechless.</p><br/><p>\"Haha! This disciple of yours is pretty interesting.\"</p><br/><p>\"Hais! I don't even know how I took a liking to this lad back then.\" Feng Qingzi shook his head while saying.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

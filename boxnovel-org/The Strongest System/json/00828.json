Where did those guts you once had disappear to?\"</p><br/><p>\"Damned Wang Xiaoming! How dare you once deceive me to be my neighbor and steal my wife away? In fact, even that b*stard child of hers wasn't mine! How can I now seek revenge for this immense hatred of mine?\"</p><br/><p>All of the genius disciples out there were extremely infuriated as they recounted their bitter experiences.</p><br/><p>Looking at the dense cluster of people up in the skies, Lin Fan was at a loss of words for a moment or so.</p><br/><p>There were all sorts of vendettas here. Some of them were fighting over territories, some of them were bullied, some of them had their wives cheated on, while others were scammed out of something.</p><br/><p>For him to be able to do things to such an extent in a mere hundred years, even if Lin Fan didn't want to be impressed, he couldn't not be.</p><br/><p>His Eternally Hated Body of the Destined Child was no joke indeed! The amount of bad luck that he had in attracting hatred was just incomparable!</p><br/><p>If any baddie were targeted by even one of these genius disciples, they would have to worry about it their entire lives. But now, they had it easy. Wang Xiaoming just taunted all of them directly.</p><br/><p>This was something that even a god couldn't stop!</p><br/><p>Lin Fan had been curious all this while. He wondered how this lad had managed to tide through everything. With so many geniuses, it was practically impossible to escape all of them unless he had some heaven defying strength!</p><br/><p>And amongst these geniuses, the highest was a Divine celestial level 8, Universal Elixir state being. Wang Xiaoming's cultivation state must be comparable as well.</p><br/><p>At this moment, a booming sound roared out.</p><br/><p>\"All of you, don't go overboard now! I, Wang Xiaoming, had long retreated into hiding in the forests, and had excluded myself from secular affairs. But, you guys have been coming to give Your Great King trouble here year after year! Don't you guys think that that's too much?\"</p><br/><p>Wang Xiaoming's boomed out from within the base. However, he did not show his face at all.</p><br/><p>Wang Xiaoming knew that if he had dared to show his face, all of these fellas would definitely rush up and rip it to shreds.</p><br/><p>\"HAHA! Devil's Incarnate, you seized the chance when we were all weak to bully us in all sorts of manner! And now that our cultivation states are heaven revolting and we're powerful, you choose to cower in fear! Do you think doing that can wash away all your sins of your past crimes?\"</p><br/><p>\"That's right! I've waited for this day for a long time now! Ninety eight years ago, you humiliated me and crushed me under your feet harshly! You caused me to have no dignity left in front of the woman I loved! Back then, you should have considered an outcome as such!\"</p><br/><p>\"Seventy years ago, you scammed me out of an utmost treasure, cutting off my path to eternity! But, the Heavens did not give up on me, and allowed me to discover an even greater secret! Now that my cultivation is pretty accomplished, it's time for you to die!\"</p><br/><p>\"Sixty years ago, my brother had only insulted you with a single sentence, and yet, you broke all four of his limbs and nearly killed my Zhao Family! When I saw my father beg you for mercy before my very eyes, I, Zhao Wuji, swore at that moment that I'll eventually kill you with my bare hands one day!\"</p><br/><p>\"Fifty eight years ago, on that night, you said that you will bring me to elope with you! Yet, you took the opportunity to steal my family heirloom! I'll never rest till I take revenge for this!\"</p><br/><p>\"Fifty seven years ago\u2026!\"</p><br/><p>\"Fifty six years ago\u2026!\"</p><br/><p>Within this bunch of geniuses, there were both males and females. Each and every one of them hated Wang Xiaoming to the core, and could not wait to tear him apart.</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan, who was hidden in the void,, heard these complaints, he could not help but sigh out. This Wang Xiaoming was way too savage! In order to scam someone of their treasures, he had even cheated their emotions! If he had just taken the other party with him back then, wouldn't he have gotten their treasure as well!? Was there a need to take away the treasure and not the other party?!</p><br/><p>Brainless! He was way too brainless!</p><br/><p>\"Cough, cough\u2026!\"</p><br/><p>Wang Xiaoming coughed out lightly, implying his innocence.</p><br/><p>\"One should not always look back on the past. And even if one does, it should be just to reminisce over it. I've long forgotten about those things, so you guys should be more magnanimous as well! If there's anything, let us sit down and have a good talk about it slowly. In these past years, I've regretted countless of times as well, and had been wanting to repent before you guys. But, since you are all here, then come on in and listen to me explain through things. And, if you guys still have pent up anger, then come and chop me! Even if I die, I'll die without regrets.\"</p><br/><p>BOOM!</p><br/><p>The moment Wang Xiaoming was done with his words, the door to his base swung open.</p><br/><p>The geniuses exchanged glances with one another, and were flustered for a moment. They did not know what this Devil's Incarnate was up to once more.</p><br/><p>\"What are we afraid of? There're so many of us! It's not as though we could be afraid of him!\"</p><br/><p>\"That's right! We are not who we used to be! Even if it's a solo fight, we won't lose to him!\"</p><br/><p>\"Even if the Devil's Incarnate does not wish to fight, the hatred within our hearts have accumulated over days and night, and we can't ever get rid of it! If we don't vent it out now, it's going to be a huge obstacle in our path of martial arts moving forward!\"</p><br/><p>\"Go, let us go!\"</p><br/><p>Instantly, the masses landed on the ground. They then perked up their attention to prevent the Devil's Incarnate from sneaking in an attack on them.</p><br/><p>However, this time around, with their full force pushing forth, they had a formidable force to be reckoned with. How could they be afraid of a mere Devil's Incarnate?</p><br/><p>Hiding somewhere in the depths of the voids, Lin Fan did not know what Wang Xiaoming was up to. Could he truly have had a change of heart in these hundred years and was now ready to detach from these worldly affairs?</p><br/><p>But when Lin Fan cast his consciousness over the entire base, his face changed.</p><br/><p>This mother*cker! Wang Xiaoming was still the f*cked up Wang Xiaoming! He hadn't changed in the least bit!</p><br/><p>\"How are the preparations coming along?\" Wang Xiaoming was warming up at this moment. Later on, it would be one hell of an intense escape.</p><br/><p>\"Great King, we're all prepared. Everyone has already packed their things and are ready to escape!\"</p><br/><p>\"Good. These fellas are absolutely relentless. This time around, if I don't give them one hell of a harsh impression, they're going to think that Wang Xiaoming is a pushover!\"</p><br/><p>Wang Xiaoming hollered out as his entire body's aura skyrocketed.</p><br/><p>\"Long live the Great King!\"</p><br/><p>\"Our Great King is invincible!\"</p><br/><p>For all of these baddies, after they joined under Wang Xiaoming, there was no way out. Therefore, they could only stick with this road to the end.</p><br/><p>If he rose, they would rise. If he fell, they would fall. Therefore, if they wanted to keep their lives, they would have to fully cooperate with Wang Xiaoming.</p><br/><p>\"Have everyone get ready. We'll give them a good display of everything we've researched in all these years!\" Wang Xiaoming declared.</p><br/><p>\"Yes!\"</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>At this moment outside the doors, a group of people stood there.</p><br/><p>\"Do you guys feel like there's something wrong with the atmosphere around here?\"</p><br/><p>\"Doesn't it seem a little too quiet?\"</p><br/><p>\"There shouldn't be any dangers though. While Wang Xiaoming may be strong, faced with this many of us, he doesn't have the capabilities to fight against us.\"</p><br/><p>\"However, everyone should still watch out. This Wang Xiaoming is full of tricks. Who knows what's going to happen next?\"</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Rumble, rumble.</p><br/><p>At this moment, the sounds of gigantic boulders rumbling suddenly boomed out.</p><br/><p>\"What's that sound?\"</p><br/><p>\"Not good! Take a look above, guys!\"</p><br/><p>Instantly, everyone found that everything above their heads had turned pitch black. It was as though something had covered the sky.</p><br/><p>\"What's this?\"</p><br/><p>\"Not good! This thing can corrode our powers! It's no use shielding against it!\"</p><br/><p>\"The void has been sealed! This Wang Xiaoming is scamming us!\"</p><br/><p>\"Aiyah! What the f*ck is this? Why does it stink like this?!\"</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>\"HAHAHA!\"</p><br/><p>At this moment at a mountain peak faraway, Wang Xiaoming floated gently over there as he burst out laughing at this sight below.</p><br/><p>\"Look at you bunch of braindead f*cks trying to f*ck me, Wang Xiaoming, over! You're still way too much of greenhorns! Go back and cultivate for perhaps another hundred years?\"</p><br/><p>\"Wang Xiaoming\u2026 You'll die a horrible death!\"</p><br/><p>At this moment, the masses were enraged.</p><br/><p>\"Ha! Whether or not I die has got nothing to do with you guys. You had better take care of yourself first. What you have on your bodies right now is the ultimate weapon that I, Wang Xiaoming, have painstakingly researched over thirty years: Ultimate Sh*t! From this day forth, you guys will be covered with a putrid smell all over you. Even if you're 1,000 miles away from me, Your Great King will be able to sniff out the pungent smells from your bodies. Therefore, you must be dreaming if you think that you'll be able to sneak an assault on me next time! Bye bye now, smelly fellas!\"</p><br/><p>Wang Xiaoming burst out laughing and swept his robes before flying into the void.</p><br/><p>\"Hais! Seems like there's going to be a lot more single men and women in the Xuanhuang World from now on. The world has truly changed\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"ARGH! WANG XIAOMING\u2026!\"</p><br/><p>A series of furious roars burst out into the sky. However, at this moment, Wang Xiaoming had already brought everyone with him and fled far away.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Was this Indigenous Being sick in the head or something? Of all the people here to f*ck up, the latter chose him! Did that Indigenous Being see him as a pushover or what?</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just courting death!\u201d</p><br/><p>The powers of the Contract Master God burst forth as his God Core started channeling the God Powers within to ram out furiously. This was the power of a Master God. Within the Moon Shadow Mainland, the Master Gods were the absolute strongest existences. Against them, every other living being was nothing but an ant. For Lin Fan to taunt him as such, the Contract Master God had long been enraged, and was determined to have this damned Indigenous Being slain. He definitely had to teach this guy a lesson about how miserable his outcome would be after offending him.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan\u2019s lips curled into a cold smirk as he looked at the Boundless Future Buddha Lord with his side glance. Right now, he knew that he only had to watch out for this bald monk. As for the other Master Gods? He did not have to bother about them all that much.</p><br/><p>Doomsday Calamity!</p><br/><p>Destruction!</p><br/><p>Instantly, Lin Fan threw out a single punch that exploded forth with countless Immortal Arts and mystic skills. The tip of his fist was covered by a layer of destructive power that could make one shiver just by looking at it. With that, the entire void shattered apart, and time itself was on the brink of disintegrating.</p><br/><p>This was just how scary the might of Immortal Kings was. But, if that were the case, the might of Heavenly Lords was something that was just inconceivable at this point.</p><br/><p>BOOM!</p><br/><p>Power gushed over as a boundless pressure pushed against the Contract Master God. All of a sudden, his face changed entirely, realizing that the strength of this Indigenous Being had suddenly turned stronger than before! In fact, there was even a repressing force that was striking out at him, making him unable to defend against it!</p><br/><p>\u201cIndigenous Being! Your Master God is not someone you can humiliate!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Contract Master God was giving it his all right now as he bolted out toward Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>At the same time, the Boundless Future Buddha Lord roared out in a furious rage as an infinite Buddha light pierced through the entire Heaven and Earth, causing the Future Gear to revolve wildly before disappearing into the void and heading over in Lin Fan\u2019s direction.</p><br/><p>As he flipped his palm, Lin Fan\u2019s Eternal Axe flashed out, swinging out toward that Future Gear. The Splitting Heavens Three Stances was not something to be underestimated; once its strength was to reach a certain extent, it could even cleave the entire Heaven and Earth apart.</p><br/><p>Catching sight of an opportunity, the Void Master God and the Chasm Master God were both delighted. \u201cRight now, that lad is just completely disregarding us!\u201d</p><br/><p>BOOM!</p><br/><p>Two mighty God Powers slammed out onto Lin Fan\u2019s body, causing his blood to rumble furiously against that mighty formidable power. However, at that moment, Lin Fan was not bothered about that stuff. His gaze was still fixated on the Contract Master God as he roared out, \u201cGo to hell!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Boundless Future Buddha Lord had not expected that this lad would actually continue fighting despite his injuries; he was just completely ignoring the Void Master God and the Chasm Master God!</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn it\u2026!!!\u201d</p><br/><p>The blood drained out of the Contract Master God\u2019s face. He could suddenly feel an extremely tremendous amount of power that was crushing down from above his head, leaving him absolutely helpless in the face of it.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan opened his mouth as a gush of blood flowed out. Despite that, he was still roaring in a crazed laughter, \u201cContract Master God! If Yours Truly wants you dead in three seconds, he means three seconds. There\u2019s absolutely no way Yours Truly will grant you even a single second more!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSPLIT APART THEN!\u201d</p><br/><p>BAM!</p><br/><p>A fist was thrown out onto the body of the Contract Master God as that formidable power surged right in, shattering that God Core within.</p><br/><p>\u201cH-HOW COULD THIS BE\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>The face of the Contract Master God was aghast in disbelief. He could not believe that this would truly be the way things had turned out \u2014 indeed, he did not manage to last more than three seconds.</p><br/><p>How could this even\u2026?</p><br/><p>To think that despite being surrounded, that Indigenous Being could still have him killed! Even though he was the weakest Master God amongst all of them here, he shouldn\u2019t be THAT fragile!</p><br/><p>Crack!</p><br/><p>The body of the Contract Master God started breaking apart bit by bit, causing streams of light to shoot out of his body like thousands of banners that pierced through the entire Heaven and Earth.</p><br/><p>\u201cARGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!\u201d</p><br/><p>A tragic howl filled the entire world as the God Core of the Contract Master God shattered apart, causing the God Powers contained within it to seep out and dissipate.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026 Congratulations on killing Contract Master God.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026 Experience Points + \u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAAHA\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan reared his head and roared out in a crazed laughter. He had finally killed the Contract Master God, causing his experience points to surge up once more! And with that, he could sense his strength turning even more monstrous.</p><br/><p>Even though he was an Immortal King, he knew that he was clearly mightier than who he was moments earlier.</p><br/><p>\u201cNO\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>When the Void Master God and the Chasm Master God caught sight of the scene before them, their eyes were filled with rage. Clearly, they had already struck out at that Indigenous Being! However, the Physical Body State of the latter was simply way too strong, such that they could only cause him to cough out blood! If it were any ordinary Immortal King, they would have long been sliced apart upon taking on those God Powers! There was no way they could even remain standing like this!</p><br/><p>\u201cImpossible\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>The two Master Gods were not the only ones in disbelief \u2014 even the Boundless Future Buddha Lord was in a state of shock. He then glared at Lin Fan in rage. \u201cJust who in the world are you? How is it possible that your strength has gotten even stronger than moments before?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Boundless Future Buddha Lord was someone with a sharp perception. He had noticed that the powers of that lad had increased significantly from before.</p><br/><p>Unless\u2026!</p><br/><p>At that moment, the Boundless Future Buddha Lord was frozen. Could it be that\u2026this lad actually got stronger the more he fought?</p><br/><p>But, how could that possibly be? How in the world could an existence as such even appear between the Heaven and Earth?</p><br/><p>Lin Fan\u2019s foot stepped out as his life force gushed out furiously, healing up every single wound on his body. \u201cAlright! You guys don\u2019t have to think anymore. Currently, if you guys wish to kill Yours Truly, that is already absolutely impossible. Even if you guys surround and fight me, so what? All you accomplish is to give me a LITTLE more trouble. Bald monk, it\u2019s true that if you wanted to kill me in the past, it would have been as easy as squishing a single ant to death. But now? Ha! It\u2019s all too late now. In the eyes of Yours Truly, all of those weak chickens of Master Gods are people I can kill with extreme ease. Even if it\u2019s you, there will definitely come a day where you will die in the hands of Yours Truly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking at that wildly arrogant expression on Lin Fan\u2019s face, the Boundless Future Buddha Lord suddenly found his entire Buddha heart freezing all of a sudden. At that moment, his mind suddenly flashed with a single statement that his most abhorred existence in the world had once said to him.</p><br/><p>The Boundless Future Buddha Lord shook his head furiously while muttering, \u201cImpossible\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI, Boundless, refuse to believe in this sh*t!\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, the Boundless Future Buddha Lord roared out as an infinite golden body appeared around him. This was the body of a Buddha Lord; vast and dignified, it sat solemnly in the void. Every single motion of that body was filled with an endless amount of Buddhist Power. This was especially the case when those eyes were jerked open; with two golden beams of light shining all the way out.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan swung out with his palm, disintegrating those two golden beams of light. He then reared his head over and shouted. \u201cBoundless Future Buddha Lord, do you really think that you can take down Yours Truly just because you unleashed that Body of the Buddha Lord? You have got to be dreaming! However, I\u2019ve got no time to play with your right now. Those two Master Gods are mine!\u201d</p><br/><p>Uproar!</p><br/><p>The Void Master God and the Chasm Master God felt their hearts freezing up when they caught sight of the expression on the face of this Indigenous Being. They were feeling an extremely crazy pressure right now.</p><br/><p>This was a pressure that wasn\u2019t existent earlier on!</p><br/><p>\u201cIndigenous Being, you\u2019re being brazen\u2026!\u201d The two Master Gods hollered out together. They did not believe that this Indigenous Being would be able to kill them.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan merely chuckled out, \u201cLater on, you guys will get to experience the most horrifying scene ever in this entire world\u2026the interchange of Yin and Yang.\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking at that smile of the Indigenous Being, the hearts of the two Master Gods skipped a beat. They could feel that everything was starting to feel really treacherous.</p><br/><p>\u201cAmitabha! Both Master Gods, please make way and allow Your Buddha Lord to take him down.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, the Boundless Future Buddha Lord spoke up, his deafening Buddha voice filling and rattling the entire world.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan tossed his head around. \u201cBald monk, I\u2019ve been waiting for a long time now. Since the chance has come, you\u2019re not going to be able to escape!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSoap!\u201d</p><br/><p>With that, a white object suddenly appeared between the Heaven and Earth.</p><br/><p>When the Boundless Future Buddha Lord, who was just about to suppress Lin Fan, caught sight of that item, he was so petrified that goosebumps appeared all over his body while he froze up entirely. There was no way he would dare to linger any longer as he bolted right into the void to hide.</p><br/><p>Thud!</p><br/><p>Nothing special happened as that counterfeit floated gently in the void.</p><br/><p>\u201cHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan roared out in laughter, \u201cYou have fallen for it once again, bald monk! Let me have a good talk with these two Master Gods first then!\u201d</p><br/><p>When the Boundless Future Buddha Lord caught sight of this, he was entirely incensed.</p><br/><p>\u201cLad, you\u2019re courting death\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>He had not expected that he would be tricked by that lad once more. However, Lin Fan had already moved out toward those two Master Gods.</p></div>\n</div>"}

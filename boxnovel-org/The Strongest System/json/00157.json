Standing beside him was the young Lolita Zhiqiao; somewhat nervous, somewhat afraid.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan stretched his palms out in front of the young Lolita, eyes beaming cheerfully.</p><br/><p>Looking at Lin Fan, she carefully stretched out her tender, nimble hands and placed them onto his.</p><br/><p>Holding the hands of his young disciple, Lin Fan let out a smile of happiness.</p><br/><p>Fengtian Sect\u2019s Battle Ark\u2026</p><br/><p>The mood has been grim since Lin Ao was defeated by a disciple of Glory Sect in a split second.</p><br/><p>Fengtian Sect Elder\u2019s face had been dark the entire way, without any signs of life. He was incensed to the max.</p><br/><p>Lying on the deck was Lin Ao. The only thing on his mind was flashes of what happened before. His face was green as he tried to bear the terrible feeling on his crotch.</p><br/><p>Or perhaps it was better to say that there was hardly any feeling there other than the pain.</p><br/><p>Intense pain.</p><br/><p>Glory Sect\u2026Lin Fan!</p><br/><p>Lin Ao\u2019s eyes were sharp, furious beyond anything.</p><br/><p>He did not know when he had lost consciousness. All he knew was that it felt extremely strange.</p><br/><p>But this vengeance, he swore to pay it back in full.</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>Passing by countless mountain peaks and oceans, the sight of the Glory Sect finally appeared before them.</p><br/><p>The tall peaks of Glory Sect began growing larger as the gigantic ark approached back. Looking at the sect before them, the disciples were all filled with excitement in their hearts.</p><br/><p>\"Finally, we\u2019re back!\"</p><br/><p>\"That\u2019s right. After leaving the sect for so many days, I did feel kinda homesick.\"</p><br/><p>\"Even though we did not destroy them utterly, Fengtian Sect\u2019s Lin Ao did have a lesson taught to him! That\u2019s a pretty big victory as well!\"</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Holding onto Zhiqiao\u2019s tiny hands, Lin Fan pointed ahead, \"That\u2019s your home from now on.\"</p><br/><p>Cai Zhiqiao\u2019s bright little eyes sparkled as she saw the multiple peaks.</p><br/><p>For the journey in the past few days, Lin Fan had a pretty good relationship with this only disciple of his. At the very least, he had broken through the initial awkwardness.</p><br/><p>The main reason was because Lin Fan was smart. He had many ideas on how to keep a young Lolita happy.</p><br/><p>\"Master, will I be staying here in the future as well?\" Cai Zhiqiao opened her eyes widely and asked.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled as he fondled the little Lolita\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>Today, Glory Sect was bustling with excitement.</p><br/><p>Nobody in the sect knew what was going on for this expedition. They knew that Glory Sect had suffered a great loss in the previous forbidden grounds expedition and had lost face in front of many sects. They wondered if they had regained some respect through this expedition.</p><br/><p>\"Our great Master is coming back!\" Zhang Ergou stood within the crowds excitedly. He missed his Master dearly.</p><br/><p>\"Senior Brother, what you miss is Master\u2019s Biggra, isn\u2019t it?\" Feng Bujue rolled his eyes and exposed Zhang Ergou mercilessly.</p><br/><p>Towards this, Zhang Ergou was somewhat displeased, \u2018Goodness, since when have you become this straightforward? Can\u2019t you see that I\u2019m not the only one who misses it?\u2019</p><br/><p>Feng Bujue looked at Ye Shaotian in the distance and sighed helplessly as well.</p><br/><p>But deep in his heart, he did somewhat miss the wondrous feeling of having a Biggra as well.</p><br/><p>Even though their master had only been gone for half a month, it felt like years to them.</p><br/><p>At last, the gigantic ark floated stilly in the skies above them. The disciples below began counting the number of inner sect disciples who came down.</p><br/><p>1\u2026</p><br/><p>2\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>20\u2026!</p><br/><p>\"Look! They\u2019re all safe and sound! Not a single one was lost!\" A few conscientious disciples who were counting carefully exclaimed excitedly.</p><br/><p>\"Eh? Why\u2019s there a little girl!\"</p><br/><p>The disciples gathered questioned the presence of the young Cai Zhiqiao. But even more so, they wondered about the results of the expedition.</p><br/><p>\"Grand Master, Elder. We have returned safely.\" Elder Yu was the first to descend the ark and he reported to the Grand Master and Senior Elder.</p><br/><p>\"Good.\" Grand Master Yan nodded.</p><br/><p>Stepping forth, Lin Fan saw the number of disciples gathered and let out a grin. Regarding the morale of the current Glory Sect, he had to do something to boost it up.</p><br/><p>\"Come, let me through\u2026\" Lin Fan\u2019s voice came calmly through the crowds. From his storage, he pulled out the Snow Lion.</p><br/><p>On that empty field in the center, a massively humungous and brutal looking beast suddenly appeared, scaring the shit out of the disciples present.</p><br/><p>\"What\u2019s that beast! Isn\u2019t it way too huge!\"</p><br/><p>\"Could that be\u2026the Snow Lion?!?\"</p><br/><p>\"What! THAT lesser celestial upper-level Snow Lion?!?\"</p><br/><p>\"Such a complete carcass! Could it be that our Glory Sect has obtained it entirely for ourselves?!?\"</p><br/><p>Everyone was shouting exuberantly with discussions rife. But one thing was for sure: in every single one of their eyes was a look of happiness.</p><br/><p>Even Grand Master Yan and the Senior Elders were somewhat shocked. They returned with the entire carcass of the beast! Surely the other sects weren\u2019t THIS generous?!?</p><br/><p>\"Grand Master, Elder, Junior Master Lin\u2019s credit is tremendous for the expedition. If not for him\u2026not only would we have lost quite a number of disciples, we might even have returned with nothing entirely.\" Zong Hentian shouted immediately.</p><br/><p>Every single person\u2019s gaze turned to Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan let out a wide smile. Cai Zhiqiao beside him was somewhat afraid by the sudden gazes of the masses, and cowered timidly behind Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Grand Master Yan and the Senior Elders looked at Lin Fan with unfathomable amazement. They too knew about the Snow Lion\u2019s strength. It was ferocious and brutal. Even with their strengths, they may not be able to take it down too.</p><br/><p>But now, the entire carcass, full and undamaged, was here before their very eyes. How did they manage to convince the other sects to give in as such?!</p><br/><p>Looking at all their dumbstruck faces, Lin Fan lowered his chin slightly and looked around, as though everything was under his control, \"This carcass? Nothing much. In the hands of Yours Truly, she was defeated all the same. What matters most is about to come.\"</p><br/><p>Everyone was taken aback. Based on Junior Master Lin\u2019s words, this was not the most important reward still?! What else was there going to be?!?</p><br/><p>Grand Master Yan and the Senior Elders looked at each other and laughed gently. In their hearts, they thought, \"Isn\u2019t this Lin Fan just the cheeky young lad. Just like him to keep everyone in suspense as such.\"</p><br/><p>Looking at their faces of anticipation, Lin Fan grinned even wider. Opening his palms, a snow-white Snow Lion cub laid quietly asleep within Lin Fan\u2019s palms.</p><br/><p>When the cub appeared, every single disciple dropped their jaws.</p><br/><p>\"That\u2019s\u2026that\u2019s the Snow Lion\u2019s cub!!!\"</p><br/><p>\"Wow, how could this be? Not only did we obtain the Snow Lion\u2019s carcass, but we also obtained its cub! Then what did the other sects have?!?\"</p><br/><p>Everyone was dumbstruck beyond words. Everything was way too surreal.</p><br/><p>Even Grand Master Yan and the Senior Elders had a stir within their hearts. Just what had happened in the expedition?</p><br/><p>Translator's Thoughts</p><br/><p>Lam Lam</p><br/><p>Cai Zhiqiao is really pretty darn cute. Gosh.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

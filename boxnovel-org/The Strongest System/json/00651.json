To think that things would turn out to be so easy.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Sovereign King Qi was resisting fervently, killing everything everywhere. However, for these living beings, as long as they were within the Paradise, they were indestructible. Each time they were killed, they would simply revive.</p><br/><p>As for the tree branches of the Mythical Parasol Tree, they were like agile snakes that coiled around the Sovereign King Qi tightly.</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>\"B*stard! Where have you sent Sovereign King Qi to?\" Sovereign King Zheng bellowed out. To think that the methods of this Motherf*cking Human King would be this sinister!</p><br/><p>\"No hurry now. You'll be reunited with him before long.\" Lin Fan chuckled out as his hands grabbed out to that Green Hell Ancient Clock in the sky.</p><br/><p>\"So heavy.\"</p><br/><p>The moment he grabbed onto the Green Hell Ancient Clock, he could feel a vast energy emanating out.</p><br/><p>\"A Supreme Grade Dao Weapon is different indeed. Even the Weapon Spirit within knows how to fight back.\"</p><br/><p>At the very moment Lin Fan made contact with the Green Hell Ancient Clock, the Weapon Spirit within was resisting wildly. Once it turned into a Dao Weapon, it's a treasure that understood the Dao. As such, its methods were harsh, something that most people wouldn't be able to deal with at all.</p><br/><p>\"Motherf*cking Human King! You want to snatch the Green Hell Ancient Clock? That's a fool's dream!\" Sovereign King Zheng hollered out as he slammed out with a palm strike. This palm strike brought with it a sharp beam of light that pierced through everything before it. The entire world seemed to have been sliced by it.</p><br/><p>This was the Sovereign King Zheng's ultimate move, 'Big Dimensional Slash'.</p><br/><p>The moment he deployed it, he could instantly rip through the void and slice every single dimension cleanly into two.</p><br/><p>The Fox Emperor and the Evil Alliance Palace Master looked at the Green Hell Ancient Clock in the void thirstily as well. The aura that was being emanated from this treasure even held something similar to an Utmost Treasure.</p><br/><p>If they could accumulate enough resources for it, who knew if it could turn into a Lower Grade Utmost Treasure. By then, this would truly be a peerless treasure.</p><br/><p>But at this moment, both of them repressed the greed in their hearts. The crux of the situation was the Motherf*cking Human King before him. That guy had to be killed first.</p><br/><p>Once they were done with killing this Motherf*cking Human King, they would then steal the treasure away and retreat immediately. After all, the influence that was spreading from those eight old fogeys was pretty depressing, to be honest.</p><br/><p>Even up to this point of time, none of them knew where those eight old fogeys came from.</p><br/><p>It was just that since this Motherf*cking Human King chose to be this careless, they would have him pay the price for it.</p><br/><p>\"How is this possible?\" Sovereign King Zheng could not believe this. To think that his Big Dimensional Slash would dissipate into the winds the moment it made contact with the other party's body! There wasn't a single bit of damage at all!</p><br/><p>\"Green Hell Ancient Clock, you had better be obedient!\" Lin Fan's powers channelled into his hands as he suppressed down the Green Hell Ancient Clock in a single move.</p><br/><p>The sounds of the bell ringing burst out wildly, one louder than the other. The Green Hell Ancient Clock was resisting wildly right now.</p><br/><p>Even though Lin Fan's cultivation state wasn't that high, his powers were extremely mighty. A single strike was as vast as the boundless seas, rendering one unable to defend.</p><br/><p>Within the Paradise\u2026</p><br/><p>The rage of the Sovereign King Qi was endless, \"Damned Motherf*cking Human King! How dare you try to steal the treasure of Your Sovereign King here? Go to hell! Die!\"</p><br/><p>Even though this was within the Paradise, the Sovereign King Qi could still sense the signals of his Green Hell Ancient Clock.</p><br/><p>The Green Hell Ancient Clock was a Supreme Grade Dao Weapon. Naturally, its powers were not to be underestimated. However, in the hands of the Motherf*cking Human King, it seemed as though it couldn't hold on any longer. This was making the Sovereign King Qi feel a little frightful.</p><br/><p>If the Green Hell Ancient Clock were to truly be taken away by the Motherf*cking Human King, it would truly be over.</p><br/><p>\"Motherf*cking Human King, Lin Fan! I won't rest until I kill you!\" Sovereign King Qi howled out as his eyes turned redder by the moment. A massive aura burst forth from his body.</p><br/><p>\"Do you really think that you can kill Your Sovereign King here just because you took down Sovereign King Wei with a single punch? I'll have you know that Your Sovereign King here isn't someone to be compared with that trash Sovereign King Wei!\"</p><br/><p>At this moment, Sovereign King Qi was enraged. To think that this Motherf*cking Human King's Paradise would be this strong that the living beings were totally unkillable. Not only that, the tree branches of the Mythical Parasol Tree were constricting him. Each time they tightened, they would absorb the crystallized walls of his Paradise, his Law, and his Essence Spirit.</p><br/><p>\"Lights of the Universe, longevity of the Heavens! Burn, burn!\"</p><br/><p>In the blink of an eye, Sovereign King Qi's aura suddenly turned berserk. He abandoned his own body as a golden Universal Elixir burst forth with a godly glow.</p><br/><p>Wherever this godly glow touched, all living beings would cease to exist.</p><br/><p>\"Motherf*cking Human King, Your Sovereign King is going to wreck your entire Paradise!\" An illusory figure floated above this Universal Elixir as it howled out repeatedly.</p><br/><p>But just at this moment, something astonishing happened to Sovereign King Qi.</p><br/><p>\"What's going on?\" Sovereign King Qi suddenly realized that his body was trembling right now. The brilliant gleam of the Universal Elixir flickered nonstop, turning redder by the second.</p><br/><p>\"You bloody braindead f*ck. The Spirit Qi within this Paradise is all of my making.\" At this moment, the Spirit of Biggra floated out, showing an exasperated face.</p><br/><p>The moment Sovereign King Qi entered the Paradise, the Spirit of Biggra had been pumping out Spirit Qi relentlessly.</p><br/><p>The Power of Biggra was ferocious. Senseless and colorless. Even Sovereign King Qi did not realize that he was taking this thing in all the time.</p><br/><p>\"Damn it! Suppress!\"</p><br/><p>Feeling the changes in his body, Sovereign King Qi's face changed. He used his boundless energy to try and suppress this berserk energy within his body.</p><br/><p>However, the more he resisted, the more berserk the energy got. It seeped right into the depths of his soul.</p><br/><p>In the blink of an eye, the tree branches of the Mythical Parasol Tree ripped out as those thick branches wrapped themselves around the Sovereign King Qi tightly.</p><br/><p>\"Damn it! DAMN IT!\"</p><br/><p>Sovereign King Qi could feel the powers within his body diminishing rapidly. The tree branches were sapping at his strength.</p><br/><p>\"Do it!\"</p><br/><p>\"HAHA! It's training time for Your Trainer King!\" The Thunder Trainer King burst out laughing manically. His long whip lashed out of his hand.</p><br/><p>\"ALL OF YOU CAN GO TO HELL!\" Sovereign King Qi's might was unparalleled. Even at this moment, he wasn't giving up on fighting back at all.</p><br/><p>\"AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!\"</p><br/><p>Just at this moment, his expression changed yet again. He could feel a mushy sensation appearing within his anus.</p><br/><p>His face was turned into shades of red and white right now.</p><br/><p>\"WHAT'S THIS?\" Sovereign King Qi blared out.</p><br/><p>The moment Flying Heavens struck, it was the moment one's anus was destroyed.</p><br/><p>Seizing the opportunity when the Sovereign King Qi was distracted with resisting, the Flying Heavens which was hidden beneath the ground burst forth. Aiming straight at his butthole, it dashed into the sky.</p><br/><p>With an extremely high rotations per minute, it destroyed everything in its path. If it could even break through the penetrative barrier of an Utmost Being of the Ancient race, there was nothing to say about the defences of the Sovereign King Qi's anus.</p><br/><p>\"Brother Long Xuan, you guys hold it in for a little while. I've yet to start my training!\" The Thunder Trainer King was shocked right now.</p><br/><p>But, it was all too late for words right now.</p><br/><p>BAM!</p><br/><p>An exploding sound rang out.</p><br/><p>Sovereign King Qi's body burst into countless pieces of flesh and blood that sprayed out in all directions. That Universal Elixir looked extremely worn out as though it could be destroyed at any moment.</p><br/><p>\"DAMN IT!\"</p><br/><p>Amidst the countless pieces of flesh and meat, the voice of the Sovereign King Qi wailed out. However, multiple tree branches swooped in and pierced through these pieces, absorbing them up rapidly.</p><br/><p>Crystallized walls of the Paradise!</p><br/><p>Essence Spirit!</p><br/><p>Law!</p><br/><p>Every single last thing was taken in by the tree branches of the Mythical Parasol Tree. In the blink of an eye, there wasn't even a single piece of scrap left.</p><br/><p>\"AHHH!!! MY TRAINING PARTNER!\" The Thunder Trainer King was absolutely flabbergasted by the scene before him right now. He then lowered his head and covered it with his hands in extreme pain, showing that forlorn, helpless expression of his.</p><br/><p>Cruel! This was way too cruel for him!</p><br/><p>There was nothing left of that body at all for him!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

He had followed his consciousness over to put on an act in front of the five Utmost Beings. To think that he would be discovered by the Fire Water Empress!</p><br/><p>Now that he had reached the Divine celestial level 10, Eternal God state, Lin Fan was starting to discover just how ferocious the Fire Water Empress was.</p><br/><p>While he was only a Pseudo Eternal God state being, his power levels were still rising steadily. Even if he met an Utmost Being, he would have the strength to fight back unlike in the past, when he would have to fight with his entire life for a chance to win.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked up into the sky and cheered himself on secretly. Seemed like he had to work hard from now. Right now, other than the Heaven's Will, the strongest enemy was the Fire Water Empress.</p><br/><p>This b*tch was extremely savage. If she were to be let out, his days of tragedy would have arrived.</p><br/><p>However, he wasn't the type of person to just sit there and wait for death. He had to fight back! This Fire Water Empress wanted to toy with the body of Yours Truly? How could Yours Truly give her that chance? He had to do a farmer's revolution to turn the tides!</p><br/><p>How dare she call Yours Truly her Exclusive Property? Wasn't that just an insult to Yours Truly?</p><br/><p>If his powers were to increase by that much more, the moment the Fire Water Empress came out, he would suppress her below him and give her one hell of a rough lesson to teach her what a man truly was.</p><br/><p>Now that Lin Fan had laid such a heavy determination in his heart, he would definitely work toward this goal.</p><br/><p>\"Have you obtained the Eternal God Seat?\" The Female Empress rushed over hurriedly. That breathtaking face of hers let out a hurried look as she was dying to know the answer.</p><br/><p>\"I did not obtain the Eternal God Seat. The Eternal God Seat was destroyed.\" Lin Fan replied.</p><br/><p>Initially, in Lin Fan's opinion, he was one hell of a heaven revolting being. But, to think that he couldn't even obtain a single Eternal God Seat. This was one hell of an embarrassment.</p><br/><p>However, the Fire Water Empress did not obtain an Eternal God Seat either. Yet, her strength could rule over all living beings. If even that b*tch could have that strength, it was not as though Yours Truly with the system couldn't do it as well, right?</p><br/><p>\"I see. Indeed, that's the case.\"</p><br/><p>When the Female Empress heard this, she nodded her head involuntarily. Back when she was leveling up to Divine celestial level 10, the Eternal God Seat was right there above her head. However, there was nothing she could do, as she could only open her eyes wide and watch the Eternal God Seat get further and further away from her.</p><br/><p>And this was the case for all the thousands of races in the Ancient Siant World.</p><br/><p>By the looks of it, the Female Empress garnered that there should be some grand scheme behind this. Or perhaps, the Eternal God Seats were just controlled by the Heaven's Will entirely.</p><br/><p>If the thousands of races could have an additional Eternal God state being who had the Eternal God Seat, the ancient race would have long been destroyed. How else could they have held on till now?</p><br/><p>It was precisely because there was no additional Eternal God Seat that the Utmost Beings of the Ancient race could be this strong.</p><br/><p>\"How did you appear here?\"</p><br/><p>Back in the Xuanhuang World, this b*tch had set him up back and forth pretty badly. Therefore, back then, Lin Fan swore that once he got to the Upper World and found the Female Empress, he would definitely f*ck her over back and forth as well.</p><br/><p>But now that he saw her, for a moment or so, Lin Fan could not put his hands to it.</p><br/><p>If he were to f*ck her back and forth and f*ck out her pregnancy by accident, he would have to bear responsibility, wouldn't he?</p><br/><p>The Female Empress noticed that the way Lin Fan was looking at her seemed a little off. She furrowed her brows, having a bad feeling about this.</p><br/><p>\"This is the hometown of Xuan'er. The Sovereign King of the Ancient race came over to attack, and Your Empress had him killed, thus leading to the Utmost Being being getting attracted here.\" The Female Empress replied.</p><br/><p>\"Oh, so that's the case.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded his head. He then looked at a figure not too far in the distance and his lips curled into a smirk.</p><br/><p>\"Ah, Xuan'er, why aren't you calling me now that you're seeing me? I thought you enjoyed calling me so dearly back then?\" Lin Fan said with a long implying tone, as he looked at that little brat who was lowering her head and standing there. He sniggered in his heart.</p><br/><p>\"Xuan'er, you know this Great God?\"</p><br/><p>\"That's right!\"</p><br/><p>All the little comrades around Xuan'er asked in surprise.</p><br/><p>In their eyes, this Great God was simply way too powerful! Not only did he kill an Utmost Being of the Ancient race, when another Utmost Being had descended earlier on, he fled at the sight of this Great God without daring to act brazenly at all!</p><br/><p>To all of these young people who had been living under the oppressive regime of the Ancient race, this was something that was way too incredible!</p><br/><p>This guy was the absolute idol in their hearts right now!</p><br/><p>Xuan'er walked over briskly while lifting that cute little face of hers, with big eyes that were brimming with tears, \"B-Big Brother Lin, do you wish to hit Xuan'er\u2026?\"</p><br/><p>Looking at the state Xuan'er was in right now, Lin Fan truly did not know what to say for a moment or so. When this brat was young, she was all full of tricks and antics.</p><br/><p>But looking at her now, she seemed to have made quite a couple of new friends.</p><br/><p>\"What do you think?\" Lin Fan chuckled and reversed the question.</p><br/><p>The Female Empress stood there awkwardly. She knew that Lin Fan was referring to what happened five years ago.</p><br/><p>Five years ago, in the eyes of the Female Empress, Lin Fan was just an ant that was hovering around the boundaries of death. Who would have thought that in the short span of five years, he would have grown to this state that was practically so dazzling that it blinded the eyes of the masses?</p><br/><p>This potential, these capabilities, this fortune\u2026 They were practically invincible!</p><br/><p>\"King Lin, let us head back to the village first. If there's anything else, we'll discuss it slowly\u2026 Nice and slowly.\" The Female Empress said.</p><br/><p>\"Big Brother Lin, it's been many years since I've seen you! Xuan'er has missed you! Back then, Xuan'er did not want to agree to it! But\u2026but\u2026!\" Xuan'er secretly cast her glance at her Master. Her meaning was clear: This had nothing to do with me. My Master forced me!</p><br/><p>The Female Empress gave a clean cough. To think that this disciple of hers would betray her! This had her feeling a little saddened.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Now that the beings of the Fox race had barely escaped from the jaws of death, they were naturally extremely respectful towards Lin Fan. Towards the powerful beings, the beings of the Fox race would always bear a heart of reverence.</p><br/><p>Back when Xuan'er was brought away by the Female Empress, the beings of the Fox race had already felt that they would have a strong backing from there on.</p><br/><p>But by the looks of it, this Motherf*cking Human King seemed to have a pretty close relationship with Xuan'er as well. This was something that was exceptionally invigorating for the beings of the Fox race.</p><br/><p>With such powerful beings around, the safety of the Fox race had a guarantee from now on!</p><br/><p>The base of the Fox race was underground. However, there was a mysterious formation that was sustaining it. No one else could tell that it was underground because when they lifted their heads, all they would see were the clear blue skies and white clouds.</p><br/><p>Within a house\u2026</p><br/><p>\"Big Brother Lin, don't be angry now! Xuan'er has truly missed Big Brother Lin!\" Xuan'er said with a sweet tongue. For some reason, this little brat had learned how to act coquettishly somehow.</p><br/><p>And her tongue has gotten sweeter as well.</p><br/><p>Back in the past, she would call him Uncle. Now, she was calling him Big Brother.</p><br/><p>Seemed like Yours Truly must be growing younger by the day.</p><br/><p>\"This little brat... Seems like you've gotten naughtier these days. All of your words are practically sugar coated with honey and are getting sweeter. These are your friends here?\" Lin Fan asked while smiling.</p><br/><p>The moment Xuan'er heard this, she smiled sweetly, \"Yes! These are all the friends that Xuan'er has made while exploring outside!\"</p><br/><p>\"S-Senior! I am Zhang Tao from the Horn race!\" A little lad who was similar to Xuan'er stammered out nervously.</p><br/><p>\"Senior! I am Tian Yu from the Wings race!\" A little maiden who looked pretty decent spoke up. Those bright eyes of hers shone with awe. In the heart of this Tian Yu, this Great God before her was her idol!</p><br/><p>Thereafter, the other little comrades of Xuan'er made their introductions.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan could tell that while some of these little comrades had pretty trash potentials, they had a heart bent on pitting against the Ancient race with an unyielding will and a lack of fear.</p><br/><p>If they were cowards, they wouldn't have accompanied Xuan'er to this point after all.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

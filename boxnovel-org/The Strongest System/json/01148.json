How could this Indigenous Being be this cruel? He had killed the Nightmare Master God, blowing him up without leaving any part intact, and had even crushed his God Core! And that wasn\u2019t all \u2014 he had even dared to remark callously that it was so beautiful\u2026!</p><br/><p>The fundamental source of the Master Gods lay in their God Core!</p><br/><p>No! He could absolutely not die here!</p><br/><p>Absolutely. No. Way!</p><br/><p>He definitely had to make his escape and inform the other Master Gods about this!</p><br/><p>BAM!</p><br/><p>Flying off into the void, the Undead Spirit Master God seemed as though he had bumped into something hard, being blocked from moving forward.</p><br/><p>When he checked the void carefully, he discovered that there was a glimmering layer in the void that seemed like flowing water. This was\u2026 a seal! To think that those Indigenous Beings would have sealed up the entire place!</p><br/><p>By now, the guts of the Undead Spirit Master God were nearly smashed entirely by Lin Fan. When he turned around to look, he saw that Indigenous Being merely standing there without giving chase at all. Roaring out in rage, he hurled out a series of God Powers one after another to slam onto that seal. But, despite his greatest efforts, that seal remained firm and sturdy as though there was nothing that could take it down.</p><br/><p>\u201cNOOOOOOOOOOOOOO\u2026!\u201d The face of the Undead Spirit Master God grimaced in anguish as he pounded both his hands on the barriers of the void repeatedly. He wanted to leave this place; he must absolutely not die here!</p><br/><p>He did not want to die like the Nightmare Master God in such a miserable and tragic way, without even having a single chance of reincarnating!</p><br/><p>This Indigenous Being was a demon! He was even scarier than themselves!</p><br/><p>Looking at everything before him, Old Master Green Hell felt his spirits getting rattled. \u201cTo think that he would be strong to the point where that Nightmare Master God was blown to death with just a single punch of his! That\u2019s just utterly horrifying!\u201d</p><br/><p>Old Master Pu Xin lamented out as well, \u201cHe is the hope of our great calamity. Only, what\u2019s the situation right now? Why is he not striking out to have that Undead Spirit Master God suppressed?\u201d</p><br/><p>All of the other disciples were equally astounded.</p><br/><p>Naturally, all of them knew of Lin Fan \u2014 this man was the idol in their hearts! This was especially the case right now where they even had a sense of fear toward him. In the hands of Senior Brother Lin, that utterly formidable Nightmare Master God did not even stand a single chance of resisting! Just how strong was a power of that level?</p><br/><p>At this moment, none of them could settle down their nerves. They then started conversing amongst themselves.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow do you guys think Senior Brother Lin will deal with the Undead Spirit Master God?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you guys think that he\u2019ll just move on to smash him to death with a single punch?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat seems really likely. The way that Undead Spirit Master God had trampled on our dead comrades is a crime that\u2019s only pardonable with death!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTake him down entirely!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked over at the Undead Spirit Master God far in the distance, who was panicking his balls off, with a calm expression. Was he going to let someone like that off? Definitely not!</p><br/><p>However, killing him with just a single punch would be letting him off way too easily. Therefore, Lin Fan felt that he had the need to give him some good education.</p><br/><p>And right now, he had a need to craft weapons as well.</p><br/><p>Giving it a rough estimate, the distance between him and the Undead Spirit Master God was merely 5000 meters. Therefore, he had to create the most tyrannical weapon that the world had ever seen.</p><br/><p>He tossed all the Legendary Materials he had into the Heaven and Earth Smelt to select the type.</p><br/><p>Rumble, rumble!</p><br/><p>The Heaven and Earth Smelt started vibrating, and in an instant, the weapon was created.</p><br/><p>\u201cUndead Spirit Master God, get your a*s over here!\u201d Lin Fan looked at the Undead Spirit Master God over in the distance and shouted out.</p><br/><p>The Undead Spirit Master God was still trying his hardest to slam out at the seal with both his palms. However, no matter how hard he tried, he could not break it at all.</p><br/><p>Looking at that, Lin Fan could only shake his head gently in disapproval. Since the Undead Spirit Master God didn\u2019t want to come over, Lin Fan could only head over personally then.</p><br/><p>Taking a single step forward, he appeared before the face of the Undead Spirit Master God. When the latter saw that, he felt his entire body shivering in fear. \u201cJust what in the world do you want?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled out, \u201cOh, nothing really. All I want to do is play a game with you!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Undead Spirit Master God felt that this Indigenous Being before him was just some bloody psychopath, a complete nutcase! If the other party had wanted to take him down, all he had to do was to slam down with a single palm strike and he would be done with it once and for all. But, to think that he would actually request to play a game with him right now? Play his mother\u2019s game!</p><br/><p>\u201cJUST WHAT IN THE WORLD DO YOU WANT!\u201d The Undead Spirit Master God wanted to fight back. But for some reason, he found himself lacking the courage to even do that. It was as though he knew deep in his heart that he would die the moment he struck out.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan raised his hand gently and wiped the void. With that, the seal disappeared instantly. He then placed his hands behind his back and stood there calmly.</p><br/><p>As for the Undead Spirit Master God, his heart was skipping with joy right now when he caught sight of the seal disappearing. He then bolted out into the void, hell bent on getting out of this place.</p><br/><p>Old Master Pu Xin and everyone else was confused. They did not know what Lin Fan was thinking of doing. Was he thinking of letting the Undead Spirit Master God off? If he were to let that guy leave, wouldn\u2019t it be the same as letting the tiger out into the woods and creating future problems to face?</p><br/><p>Looking at the distance, Lin Fan counted the distance in his heart.</p><br/><p>1500 meters!</p><br/><p>2500 meters!</p><br/><p>4000 meters!</p><br/><p>4500 meters!</p><br/><p>The Undead Spirit Master God spun his head around. When he noticed that the Indigenous Being was not chasing after him, his heart skipped with joy. He was finally going to escape! All he needed was the time required for a blink and he would be thousands of miles away by then!</p><br/><p>Urgh!</p><br/><p>All of a sudden, the Undead Spirit Master God came to a stop. That expression of having just escaped death was fleeting from his face, being replaced with one of shock and disbelief.</p><br/><p>Lowering his head, he caught sight of a gigantic saber that pierced through his chest, its blade filled with an extremely destructive power. Turning around, he looked carefully.</p><br/><p>That Indigenous Being was still standing where he was!</p><br/><p>However, there was an extremely gigantic saber that he was holding in his hands.</p><br/><p>Looking at the target he had struck, Lin Fan smiled. \u201cHow about now, Undead Spirit Master God? This 5,000 meter saber of Yours Truly is rather decent, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><br/><p>The eyes of the Undead Spirit Master God glared wide open toward this Indigenous Being as he spurted out a mouthful of fresh blood. \u201cY-You\u2019re just toying with me\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan roared out in laughter, \u201cWow! You\u2019re smart, aren\u2019t you? Indeed, I AM toying with you\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cARGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Undead Spirit Master God howled out in rage, feeling infuriated beyond words in his heart. He was a great Master God! And yet, here he was being toyed around by an Indigenous Being! Even if he were to give it his all, he would have to make this Indigenous Being pay the price!</p><br/><p>But, just as he was about to strike out, the gigantic 5,000 meter saber in Lin Fan\u2019s hand twisted furiously, mincing that God Body of his into shreds. With that, the only thing left floating gently in the void was a single God Core that emanated an Undead Spirit God Power.</p><br/><p>Seeing this gigantic 5,000 meter saber that Lin Fan had crafted, he was truly extremely satisfied with it. If he were to meet with any enemies in the future, as long as they were within a distance of 5,000 meters, he would be able to kill them in a flash.</p><br/><p>Seeing that, Old Master Pu Xin and the others could only shake their heads helplessly. Indeed, Lin Fan was not a man who could be judged by conventional standards. Most people would be filled with nothing but fear if they were to come to face a Master God. But Lin Fan? All he wanted to do was toy with the other party! There was simply nothing anyone could say about that!</p><br/><p>Pulling the Undead Spirit God Core over, Lin Fan gave it a squeeze and had yet another Master God slain.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026 Congratulations on killing Undead Spirit Master God.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>His experience points had skyrocketed once more.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan observed his experience points \u2014 he was just getting closer to that Heavenly Lord state now. Perhaps, it would be enough once he were to kill a few more.</p><br/><p>However, given the situation right now and after everything that had happened here, Lin Fan was sure that it wasn\u2019t going to be that easy to kill those Master Gods anymore.</p><br/><p>Once he had everything here settled, Lin Fan returned back to the sect with Old Master Pu Xin and the others.</p><br/><p>A few days later\u2026</p><br/><p>Lin Fan realized that the entire Endless Mainland had quietened down significantly, and those Master Gods of the Moon Shadow Mainland had not taken any action; they were not even invading any places anywhere. This had him rather bothered; could they be trying to amass all of their powers to prepare a massive counterstrike?</p><br/><p>In order to verify his suspicions, Lin Fan left the Heaven and Earth Sect and started searching for those Master Gods. However, it was as though they had disappeared out of existence as he could not find even a single trace of theirs. Even in those areas of the Endless Mainland that were conquered by the Moon Shadow Mainland, he could only see living beings of the Moon Shadow Mainland scattered everywhere.</p><br/><p>It was truly as though they had evaporated from the face of the world \u2014 those Master Gods had disappeared completely.</p><br/><p>Upon returning to the sect, Lin Fan told Geng Yangtian and the others about everything. When they heard this, they had a hunch that something bad might truly be looming over them.</p><br/><p>There was no way they would believe that the Master Gods of the Moon Shadow Mainland would leave just like that. If that were the case, there was only a single possibility\u2026</p><br/><p>Those Master Gods of the Moon Shadow Mainland were concentrating their forces.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p></div>\n</div>"}

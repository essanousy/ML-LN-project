When Lin Fan saw this gigantic claw that was covered with gigantic, bloody red scales, his heart skipped a beat. He had a feeling that something horrifying was going to pop out from this coffin.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked over at the fainted Evil Lord and felt that he was the one being toyed with right now!</p><br/><p>\"You bloody fella! After half a day, Yours Truly thought that you were just trying to show your might! To think that you were seeking out help! Hurry up and get out! Yours Truly will fight you fairly one on one!\"</p><br/><p>This aura was a little sinister as though this was the origin of evil. At the moment the coffin opened up, the entire world seemed to have been consumed by evil.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan kicked the Evil Lord a few times. However, the Evil Lord, who had fainted entirely, did not react at all.</p><br/><p>\"Hurry up and get up! You bloody\u2026!\"</p><br/><p>Thump! Thump!</p><br/><p>Before Lin Fan could even finish his sentence, a furious heartbeat sounded out. When he raised his head and looked at the coffin, those wide open eyes of Lin Fan had its pupils dilated. It was as though he had just witnessed something unbelievable.</p><br/><p>\"What in the world is this sh*t?\"</p><br/><p>This evil creature was immensely huge, and its body was shrouded with the origin of evil. There were some curvy horns at the top of its head, with its entire body burning with blazing flames.</p><br/><p>Bzz! Bzz!</p><br/><p>The entire void seemed to be almost incinerated with the scorching heat.</p><br/><p>\"ROARRRRRRRRRRR!!!\"</p><br/><p>A maddened roar burst forth from that evil creature's mouth. All of a sudden, an immense suction force appeared out of it. The fainted Evil Lord on the ground seemed to be dragged by some extremely strong pull as he flew into the mouth of that evil creature.</p><br/><p>Initially, Lin Fan had wanted to grab onto the Evil Lord. But, the moment he touched the body of the Evil Lord, the black mist that was surrounding the body of the Evil Lord pounced on him. Lin Fan could even feel his skin being corroded by it!</p><br/><p>By now, Lin Fan's cultivation state was immensely strong, and his physical body state was even at the pinnacle state! But, to think that this black mist could cause Lin Fan to feel a little troubled over it. That was something pretty incredible.</p><br/><p>\"Just what in the world is this thing?\"</p><br/><p>While Lin Fan may have a pretty vast knowledge of the world, he hadn't seen anything like these evil things before. Seemed like this Chaos Coffin was a pretty good item! Lin Fan wanted to take keep this for himself. However, something that could contain an evil creature as such was evidently not that easy to subdue.</p><br/><p>Every treasure had a spirit within it. Lin Fan's eyes shone with a sharp glint as he looked into the Weapon Spirit of this Chaos Coffin. That spirit was extremely huge, similar to a huge blob of meat. However, this blob of meat was jet black, and even more vile than ordinary demons. It was as though being contaminated by just a single drop of this could turn a Buddha, who could cleanse the entire world, into the vilest Evil Buddha in the entire world.</p><br/><p> \"Motherf*cking Human King!\"</p><br/><p>And just as Lin Fan was contemplating about this, a long whip made out of a black light slashed through the void. This black light was extremely sinister looking. As it was swung through the void, a long cut appeared in the void, as it exploded out and was unable to heal back up for a long time.</p><br/><p>\"This seems pretty strong! I was nearly split into two by you!\"</p><br/><p>This was way stronger than the mystic art the Evil Lord had used to slice through the void earlier on. However, it was still useless on Lin Fan. The Evil Lord would win if he could even hurt Lin Fan a little bit.</p><br/><p>\"Motherf*cking Human King, how dare you purify all of my underlings? This is a grudge that Your Lord here must definitely reclaim! So what if your cultivation state is heavenly?! The Chaos Fiend Coffin is the source of all evils! As long as there is evil in this world, the power of Your Lord shall always be infinite! As for you, you can just perish in the hands of Your Lord!\"</p><br/><p>After devouring the Evil Lord, this giant seemed to have been replaced by the Evil Lord.</p><br/><p>\"Bow down! Bow down to Your Lord completely and Your Lord can spare your life! You shall be inferior to no one else but me, and together, we shall rule over the Infinite Worlds together!\"</p><br/><p>Right now, the Evil Lord no longer had a human form. This monster that was born from the Chaos Fiend Coffin howled out malevolently. All the aura that it spat out turned the Qi of the living around the entire area into Qi of the Chaos Fiend.</p><br/><p>While this was the energy required by the Outworld Fiends, it was akin to venomous poison for the beings of the thousands of races. It could cause the powers within their bodies to go berserk and cause their Paradises to wither down.</p><br/><p>\"You're getting a little irritating now. Do you think that you're a match for Yours Truly now just because of this?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan cast him a casual side glance, not bothered in the least bit.</p><br/><p>\"The Chaos Fiend's birth! Unbridled and unrestrained!\"</p><br/><p>All of a sudden, the Evil Lord yelled out a long cry, and an infinite amount of black mist was spat out of that mouth of his. These balls of black mist began to converge continuously, forming runic symbols one after another. These runes flashed with a ghastly light, emanating a boundless amount of evil powers. Instantly, they locked up the entire space around Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>\"Motherf*cking Human King\u2026 You don't have to hide it anymore! Your Lord has already seen through you! You are but a mere Divine celestial level 9, Eight Desolates United state being! And right now, all the eight desolates are sealed up! Let's see just what else you can do now!\"</p><br/><p>The Evil Lord laughed out wildly as though everything was within the palms of his control.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan blinked his eyes. Indeed, he could feel that the eight desolates had been sealed up, and he could no longer sense the gush of power that was rushing in. However, this meant jacksh*t for Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>\"Hmph! Evil Lord, Cut the crap! I'll play with you first.\"</p><br/><p>Clang!</p><br/><p>The Eternal Axe glided through the world, and a bright flash of axe light appeared. The Eternal Axe was a legendary weapon. However, it was a pity that it was in a damaged state right now. Lin Fan wanted to see just how strong this Evil Lord was right now.</p><br/><p>He had managed to take down the Evil Lord with ease earlier on. However, the strength of the Evil Lord had indeed increased considerably, and he was now stronger than ordinary Divine celestial level 10, Eternal God state beings.</p><br/><p>Destruction!</p><br/><p>Firmament!</p><br/><p>Lin Fan's aura was calm as he flicked his wrist. Two streaks of axe lights flashed out as though they were two dragons coiling together.</p><br/><p>BOOM!</p><br/><p>The axe light exploded, and two deep cuts appeared on the body of the Evil Lord. However, black mist filled up the injuries, and in the blink of an eye, they were healed up to be perfect as new.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan had not expected that the strength of the Evil Lord would become this tyrannical. That two axes just now possessed all of his powers. Even if it was a Divine celestial level 9 state powerful being, they would be minced into sludges of meat and blood!</p><br/><p>But, to think that this Evil Lord would be taking on the blow with such ease. This was something that Lin Fan hadn't expected.</p><br/><p>Seemed like the strength of this Evil Lord right now was indeed way stronger than before.</p><br/><p>\"Motherf*cking Human King, those two axes of yours were decent! However, it's a pity that they're useless on Your Lord. In the eyes of Your Lord, you are just like a speck of dust in this world that I can crush with ease!\"</p><br/><p>The Evil Lord laughed out coldly as an immense amount of power surged out of his body. His confidence was now over the roof, and he was filled with an endless amount of motivation.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan did not say anything else. Leaping up, he instantly appeared before the Evil Lord's face. Slamming out with his fist, it was as though the Gods and Ghosts had descended upon the world as the Doomsday Calamity Qi rippled through everything.</p><br/><p>The initial version of the Doomsday Calamity God Fist wasn't all that strong. However, this skill had now been raised by Lin Fan to a pinnacle state. With a single punch that rained out, the Calamity Qi from far away in the distant planes was pulled through the mysterious space-time towards this punch.</p><br/><p>If any powerful being were to be infiltrated by this Calamity Qi, their bodies would start to break down as though it was Doomsday. Even if it were a truly powerful being, they would still receive an immense pain.</p><br/><p>\"Calamity Qi! Good stuff! This is good stuff indeed!\"</p><br/><p>The Evil Lord opened up his mouth widely and formed a vortex that started sucking in these Calamity Qi and digesting it within his body.</p><br/><p>\"HAHAHA! Your Lord is an Outworld Fiend! Every single dark energy would be nothing but nutrient in the body of Your Lord! What else can you do?\" The Evil Lord howled out while grabbing out with his fiendish claw. A sharp blade that was shrouded in a black mist broke out of the void and pierced towards Lin Fan's chest.</p><br/><p>This sword was imperceptible and the black mist that shrouded it was filled with evil intents, spreading out all over the place.</p><br/><p>\"Go and die! Sword of Corruption!\"</p><br/><p>Clang! Clang!</p><br/><p>\"How could this be!?\" The moment the sword made contact with Lin Fan's body, it let out a series of metal clanging sounds.</p><br/><p>'Ding\u2026Eternal God Body Experience Points +1,000.'</p><br/><p>\"Hue!\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smirked and flicked with his finger, causing the entire black sword to shatter into pieces.</p><br/><p>\"Not bad! Yours Truly would acknowledge that you're strong. I'm afraid taking you down would require me to commit that bit of an effort. But, Yours Truly is tired of playing with you now. I'll take you down right now!\"</p><br/><p>\"With someone like you?\"</p><br/><p>The Evil Lord hadn't expected that this Motherf*cking Human King's physical body state would be this strong! To think that the single sword wouldn't be able to break through it!</p><br/><p>\"Well\u2026 of course, it's not just me! Alright, come on out!\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan swept his robes, and a series of boundless auras appeared within the world. When the Evil Lord sense these auras, he was completely dumbstruck as he yelped out involuntarily.</p><br/><p>\"I-IMPOSSIBLE!\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

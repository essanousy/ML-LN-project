He felt that he had truly been way too careless. If not for the fact that Junior Brother Lin had stepped in earlier on, he would have lost that little life of his in the hands of these Earth Demons for sure.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy thanks, Junior Brother Lin.\u201d Ever since he had tested out Lin Fan\u2019s strength, Hu Qing had never once belittled the former. And now that there was this lifesaving grace of his, Hu Qing was naturally immensely grateful.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing. Since we\u2019re a party, we\u2019ve got to help out one another.\u201d Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is the core of that leader of those Earth Demons. By all reasoning, this should belong to Junior Brother Lin.\u201d Su Hongchen dug out the core of that Earth Demon leader.</p><br/><p>Back in the sect, this core can be used to exchange for quite a significant amount of Contribution Points.</p><br/><p>\u201cKeep it and we\u2019ll split it fairly later on.\u201d Lin Fan replied.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan had no use for stuff like this. For Lin Fan, the most practical thing to take note of was to kill as many Earth Demons as he could right now.</p><br/><p>And not only that, it had to be those Earth Demons with the strongest strength. Only those types of Earth Demons could provide him with a continuous stream of experience points.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan\u2019s actions naturally curried favor with everyone around. A party mate as such was someone that everyone would love to be with.</p><br/><p>\u201cEven though these Earth Demons are not too strong, their cores should be worth some Contribution Points as well. We can\u2019t let them go to waste now.\u201d Su Hongchen dug up the cores of those other fallen Earth Demons.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>For the next few days, Lin Fan and the others had been slaying Earth Demons within this Earth Abyssal Demon Cave.</p><br/><p>As a result, the cores that they had obtained were numerous. However, to Lin Fan\u2019s disappointment, even the highest cultivation state of the Earth Demons they had encountered was only Immemorial Ancient state upper level.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan truly wanted to kill down to the deeper levels. However, when he considered that Su Hongchen and the others were with him, he gave up on that thought.</p><br/><p>After heading back this time around, Lin Fan had the intentions of heading over alone the next time.</p><br/><p>The deeper they got, the more the surroundings around them started changing.</p><br/><p>There were more corpses lying all over the place.</p><br/><p>Some of the corpses were from long ago while others could not have been there for that long. At best, they ended up here only recently.</p><br/><p>\u201cSuch a thick Demonic Qi!\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, Su Hongchen\u2019s brows furrowed as she could sense that the Demonic Qi here was truly detestable.</p><br/><p>Hu Qing and the others were equally surprised. They too had felt this Demonic Qi here. And not only that, the Demonic Qi was extremely vile compared to anything else. There was even a trace of Essence Blood that could be sensed in it.</p><br/><p>\u201cSomeone is cultivating here.\u201d Ru Wanshu remarked.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan raised his finger, \u201cThis Demonic Qi should be coming over from that place over there.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone exchanged glances, \u201cShall we head over to check it out?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was lacking powerful beings to kill right now; therefore, he immediately nodded his head, \u201cWe can try.\u201d</p><br/><p>These few people then hid their auras and slowly inched closer before hiding behind some boulders.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey are not cultivating some demonic skills, just cultivating their treasures.\u201d Su Hongchen said.</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan caught sight of the situation ahead, his interest was piqued slightly. Above a pool of blood was a young man who looked extremely devilish. Beside him was a blood red saber floating around him.</p><br/><p>There were a few blood red threads that extended out of the red saber. These blood threads seeped into the pool of blood and sucked out the Essence Blood within.</p><br/><p>As for the Earth Demons around, they were lying with their stomachs propped up. When they opened their mouths, an endless amount of Essence Blood sprayed out.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a disciple of the Blood Demon Sect. Cultivating their weapons with Essence Blood, that is a technique that only the Blood Demon Sect employs.\u201d Su Hongchen commented.</p><br/><p>The Blood Demon Sect was a Demonic Sect, and was one of the nine great righteous sects as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d</p><br/><p>All of a sudden, that disciple of the Blood Demon Sect jerked his eyes wide open and spat out a mouthful of Blood Qi that turned into a blood red streak of light, crushing the boulder they were hiding behind.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph! Here I was wondering who it was. Seems like it\u2019s the disciples of the Heaven and Earth Sect.\u201d That young man stood up as his eyes shone with a demonic gaze. There was a bone chilling feeling about him.</p><br/><p>\u201cNumber sixty seven on the True Immortal Substitute Roll, Xue Tianzi!\u201d At this moment, Hu Qing recognized who this person before him was.</p><br/><p>That long robe he was wearing which was red as blood, and that demonic gaze of his\u2026 This was a powerful being on the True Immortal Substitute Roll!</p><br/><p>\u201cGo, hurry and go! We\u2019re not his match!\u201d Hu Qing exclaimed out and dragged everyone along with him. For someone to be able to get on the True Immortal Substitute Roll, they must definitely be a powerful being.</p><br/><p>This wasn\u2019t an existence they could deal with!</p><br/><p>\u201cHAHA! Since you\u2019re here, why not stay here? What are you guys trying to leave for?\u201d Xue Tianzi laughed out as the sky vibrated. A series of blood red banners sealed up the entire sky and blocked off everyone\u2019s escape path.</p><br/><p>Back in the past, Lin Fan did not know what the True Immortal Substitute Roll was. But, he now knew clearly.</p><br/><p>This roll was the ranking of all the Immemorial Ancient state beings that had yet to enter the True Immortal state. Those who are able to have their names on the substitute roll were basically Immemorial Ancient state full cultivation state beings.</p><br/><p>But, even then, only paragons would be able to make it into the top 100 of the list with just an Immemorial Ancient state upper level.</p><br/><p>Since this Xue Tianzi was able to rank sixty seven, his strength must be stronger than most others for sure.</p><br/><p>Even though the cultivation state of Hu Qing and the others was pretty decent, compared to those on the True Immortal Substitute Roll, they were still too far off\u2026 way too far off.</p><br/><p>Thus, it was no wonder that they would have to make a run for it upon meeting someone from the True Immortal Substitute Roll.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis Scarlet Blood Demon Saber of mine is just short of that bit of Essence Blood to be upgraded to a Supreme Grade Utmost Treasure. Since you guys are here, then you shall contribute your Essence Bloods for Your Tianzi here!\u201d Xue Tianzi was someone of the Demonic Sect after all, and they leaned heavily towards killing.</p><br/><p>Since Lin Fan and the others had ventured here, he would naturally not let them off.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot good! Xue Tianzi\u2019s killing intent towards us has been activated!\u201d Bing Linxing\u2019s face was pale with fright.</p><br/><p>\u201cXue Tianzi! We are Inner Sect disciples of the Heaven and Earth Sect! If you dare to kill us, the Heaven and Earth Sect will definitely not let you off!\u201d Hu Qing warned harshly.</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe\u2026 Let me off? Well, have your Grandmaster make a trip over to the Blood Demon Sect then.\u201d Xue Tianzi roared out in laughter as he gripped that Scarlet Blood Demon Saber of his.</p><br/><p>With that, a torrential sea of blood surged up from behind his body.</p><br/><p>\u201cHundred Weapons Breaking Formation!\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, Bing Linxing roared out as a bedazzling gleam of light shone out from his body. Countless weapons flew out of it and formed up a Weapon Spirit.</p><br/><p>The figure of this Weapon Spirit was immensely huge. When he slashed out, the entire world shook along with it.</p><br/><p>\u201cInsignificant tricks!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xue Tianzi scoffed coldly as he sliced out with the saber in his hands. A blood shade tore through the firmaments. This Scarlet Blood Demon Saber brought out an endless streak of blood red light; it was so sharp that even the void shattered in its presence.</p><br/><p>Creak.</p><br/><p>The Weapon Spirit crumbled without even having a chance to fight back at all.</p><br/><p>Despite that, the speed of the Scarlet Blood Demon Saber did not diminish in the least bit! In fact, it got even faster!</p><br/><p>\u201cNot good\u2026!\u201d The faces of the group were stunned. Ru Wanshu even spat out a mouthful of his Essence Blood, hoping that the blood could draw in the righteous powers of the Heaven and Earth.</p><br/><p>But, in the face of this weapon that was about to turn into a Supreme Grade Utmost Treasure, all efforts were futile.</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone, I\u2019m afraid that we\u2019ll all have to fall here!\u201d Hu Qing was filled with immense regrets right now. If only they hadn\u2019t come forth due to curiosity, nothing like this would have happened then.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho determined that?\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, Lin Fan stood forth and raised his hand. He blocked the Scarlet Blood Demon Saber with his bare palms and gave it a simple grip. The saber then shattered and disintegrated into the air.</p><br/><p>\u201cNumber sixty seven on the True Immortal Substitute Roll? Do you really think that you\u2019re number one? And, even if you\u2019re number one, your outcome will still be the same.\u201d Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>Eh?</p><br/><p>The group looked at Lin Fan in astonishment. How could that Scarlet Blood Demon Saber break so easily? This was way too unreal!</p><br/><p>Lam_ Lam_ Why is the Blood Demon Sect described as a Righteous Sect as well? I have\u2026no idea. I\u2019ll update and change this if anything happens in the future. But mostly I blame our author for not giving me an extremely detailed explanation as usual. He just tossed a random \u20189 sects, 6 blah blah 3 blah blah blah blah blah.\u2019 <em>Rolls eyes</em> HAHA. Cheers!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

He had brought them into the forest then tied them to the trees using vines.</p><br/><p>\"Stop talking, it will be finished soon.\" Lin Fan directed the remaining minions to find a tree themselves and stand there without moving.</p><br/><p>Since their boss had been tied up, they didn\u2019t dare to defy him. Thus they could only beg for mercy.</p><br/><p>Qu Xiang Ge had been a bandit for some time now. He was cynical and knew how to protect himself under dangerous situations. His Tiger Blade was no ordinary weapon, although it wasn\u2019t comparable to a legendary weapon it was still an upper graded weapon. He had stolen it from a teacher from the Sky Heaven School. It was still a powerful high-class weapon. But now, the upper graded Tiger Blade had been destroyed by this person with just his mere body, and that too with no injuries. This had left Qu Xiang Ge speechless.</p><br/><p>The person in front of them was a master. To escape from the hands of a master was simply an idiotic dream.</p><br/><p>\"Senior, I know I was wrong, please let me go.\" Qu Xiang Ge begged. The strange actions of this person frightened him and left a nasty feeling. Just what was he planing to do by tying us to trees? Also, the person\u2019s unnerving smile made Qu Xiang Ge\u2019s quake with even greater fear.</p><br/><p>\"Don\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t take your life. I just want you to cooperate.\" After all the bandits had been tied, Lin Fan brushed off his hands in satisfaction.</p><br/><p>\"Senior, I will cooperate.\" Qu Xiang Ge hastily said. Since it had become like this, he was now at the mercy of this person. Nothing was important as long as they could survive.</p><br/><p>\"I say, how much assets do you all have. You bandits seem pretty capable, so you must have stolen many things.\" Lin Fan glanced at Qu Xiang Ge, then went forth and started checking himself, not even bothering to wait for a response.</p><br/><p>\"What\u2019s this, just this much money?\"Lin Fan had found some money on Qu Xiang Ge\u2019s body, but nothing else. A level four postcelestial bandit, at least try to live up to the level.</p><br/><p>\"Senior, I really don\u2019t have any. I am a bandit, but this is our first go in these past few months. I am wanted by the Sky Heaven School, so I didn\u2019t dare to come out.\" Qu Xiang Ge said.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked exasperatedly at Qu Xiang Ge and shook his head. Trying to be a bandit like this, what a disgrace. Lin Fan didn\u2019t say anything more and pocketed the silver, then looked carefully at Qu Xiang Ge.</p><br/><p>Qu Xiang Ge became nervous as Lin Fan observed him, afraid of upsetting the person and getting himself killed.</p><br/><p>\"I want to ask you a question, answer honestly. Do you think men are better or women are better?\"Lin Fan wanted to test Twisting Heaven and Earth and Black Tiger Steals Heart.</p><br/><p>After Twisting Heaven and Earth had upgraded, he still hadn\u2019t used it yet and didn\u2019t know its effects. But now, the perfect opportunity had come. A test subject had delivered himself, so Lin Fan wanted to experiment.</p><br/><p>But even so, Lin Fan was a professional person. Before experimenting, he would, of course, ask the person\u2019s opinion first.</p><br/><p>Qu Xiang Ge froze, not understanding why this question was asked. He then though about it and analyzed the current situation.</p><br/><p>Why did senior ask this question, what meaning does it hold?</p><br/><p>In this world, the strong eat the weak, women either became strong or fall prey to men.</p><br/><p>But Qu Xiang Ge couldn\u2019t actually say this because he saw a light within the eyes of this senior.</p><br/><p>\"Senior, I think men and women are equal in this world because, in my opinion, both men and women are good.\" Qu Xiang Ge said contrary to his true thoughts.</p><br/><p>Because Qu Xiang Ge had always treated women as playthings and had never actually properly evaluated them. But he could only respond like this and hope his words could touch this senior\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>If he could get the approval of this senior, perhaps he could escape unscathed.</p><br/><p>As Qu Xiang Ge saw the senior continually nodding his head, his heart jumped with joy. It seemed his words had been approved by the senior, what a relief.</p><br/><p>\"Good\u2026\" Lin Fan\u2019s face lit up. Not bad, not bad\u2026 He then looked at the surrounding minions and asked, \"What do you all think?\"</p><br/><p>Upon seeing the boss\u2019 words making the senior this happy, they naturally didn\u2019t say anything more and all started to nod their heads furiously, \"We also think so too.\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes, men and women are good.\"</p><br/><p>\"Ah, I even hate myself for not being a woman.\"</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded in satisfaction. He had initially thought these people would be reluctant, but after seeing them nod their heads in agreement, his heart felt no guilt.</p><br/><p>\"Alright, then, in that case, I will satisfy all your wishes.\"</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>\"Senior\u2026\" Qu Xiang Ge\u2019s expression changed because the senior\u2019s eyes had become intensely sharp.</p><br/><p>\"Twisting Heaven and Earth.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan didn\u2019t know what effect Twisting Heaven and Earth had, but according to the description Yin and Yang would be reversed, perhaps men would also change to women?</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan\u2019s hand reached out, he suddenly realized it was a bit different. An inexplicable idea instilled into his own hands as if it were changing the very rules of heaven and earth.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026 congratulations \"Twisting Heaven and Earth\" experience+ 100.\u2019</p><br/><p>Lin Fan knew a level four postcelestial wouldn\u2019t provide much experience, but he didn\u2019t think it would give one hundred experience. But this time, Lin Fan suddenly realized the ferocious face of Qu Xiang Ge was slowly changing.</p><br/><p>The previously ferocious face became weak, and even the Adam's Apple had begun shrinking.</p><br/><p>\"Twisting Heaven and Earth.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan then once again attacked, and the experience went up by 100 again.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan then realized Qu Xiang Ge\u2019s previous weakened appearance began changing again, but this time, the appearance had turned back to normal.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan froze upon seeing this.</p><br/><p>\u2018Is it possible that I can also change him back?\u2019</p><br/><p>To confirm his conclusion, Lin Fan attacked several more times, but each attack was accompanied by Qu Xiang Ge\u2019s screams.</p><br/><p>After numerous tests, Lin Fan was positive. Twisting Heaven and Earth could change yin and yang, thus changing a person\u2019s gender.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan sighed. To be substantive, Twisting Heaven and Earth was rather disappointing, as its damage paled compared to Monkey Steals Peach.</p><br/><p>\"Senior, what did you do to me?\"Qu Xiang Ge asked with a pale face.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shook his face, \"Nothing, just testing out a move. Alright, next up is Black Tiger Steals Heart.\"</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Currently, Zang Tianhao and his party had long escaped the danger zone and stopped gasping for breath.</p><br/><p>\"Senior, will he be alright?\"</p><br/><p>\"He should be, senior looked confident.\" Zang Tianhao trustfully said.</p><br/><p>\"Brother Zang, let\u2019s wait here for senior.\" Han Mengmeng said.</p><br/><p>\"Alright.\" Zang Tianhao nodded. They had no other options but to hope senior would be alright.</p><br/><p>\"Hey look, it\u2019s senior.\"</p><br/><p>Zang Tianhao, Han Mangmang, and the rest looked over, their expressions in joy as they immediately went forth, \"Senior are you alright?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan walked over slowly, his mind still on the experiment. He had discovered that the usage of Twisting Heaven and Earth and Black Tiger Steals Heart were both strange. Lin Fan concluded that Black Tiger Steals Heart could cause a person\u2019s chest to swell up, but he didn\u2019t know what it would be like when upgraded.</p><br/><p>Upon hearing the voices of Zang Tianhao and the rest, Lin Fan raised his head while smiling, \"I am fine, let\u2019s go.\"</p><br/><p>Seeing that senior hadn\u2019t mentioned Qu Xiang Ge and his party, Zang Tianhao didn\u2019t pursue the topic. They set off toward the Great Yan dynasty in peace, about to reach it finally with their current increased speed</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Allowing that gigantic dragon to escape might not be that bad of a deal as well. Who knew, he might be able to lure back a bigger group.</p><br/><p>\u201cStop shouting now. Hell, I\u2019m even feeling embarrassed for you. Bloody hell, calling yourself a Dragon Knight and whatnot? Even your dragon has abandoned you! You might as well change your name.\u201d Lin Fan sighed out, feeling a huge ton of sympathy for this fella. \u2018There goes a fine dragon abandoning him just like that. If anyone was in his place, they would definitely find it absolutely unbearable as well.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cOria! You are not fit to be a battle comrade of the great Jayce! From this day forth, I, Dragon Knight Jayce, shall officially sever all ties of comradeship with Oria!\u201d Dragon Knight Jayce roared out in shame and fury. After that, as though he had suffered some tremendous blow, he clutched at his chest in pain and declared.</p><br/><p>Then, he cast his sights toward Lin Fan and said, \u201cI, Dragon Knight Jayce, will definitely not fear an Indigenous Being such as yourself! Prepare to die!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDragon Knight\u2019s Battle Technique \u2013 Whirlwind!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jayce raised the spear in his hand up high and leaped up. With that, his entire body was wrapped up by a dragon whirlwind as he bolted out toward Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>\u201cI, Dragon Knight Jayce, am the strongest, loftiest, and bravest Dragon Knight in the entire Moon Shadow Mainland! Even though you are extremely strong, Indigenous Being, I am not afraid of you!\u201d The Dragon Knight Jayce roared out, making it seem as though his image was absolutely high up and incomparable. He was sounding as if other than Lin Fan, there was no one else in the world who could stand up against him.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan merely stood there and blinked his eye. Was this guy a moron or something?</p><br/><p>As he deployed his battle technique, the Dragon Knight Jayce was wrapped by a whirlwind completely.</p><br/><p>Toward an opponent as such, Lin Fan was too lazy to even slap him to death; his strength was simply way too weak. Even if Lin Fan were to slap this guy to death, it would do nothing for him at all. Although, he could definitely capture this guy over and have him purified. He could then take a look at just what was up in the Moon Shadow Mainland, and how many people they had sent for this invasion into the Endless Mainland.</p><br/><p>\u201cGet over here!\u201d Lin Fan spoke up and grabbed out at that whirlwind straightaway.</p><br/><p>All of a sudden, Lin Fan could feel some feedback coming from the void around him.</p><br/><p>\u201cI, Dragon Knight Jayce, have never ever known fear! However, you better stay there and wait! Once I get stronger, I\u2019m going to come and have my revenge!\u201d</p><br/><p>Piak!</p><br/><p>The whirlwind dissipated, and a scroll dropped from within.</p><br/><p>Looking at the scroll, Lin Fan picked it over.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026 Discovered used Teleportation Scroll.\u2019</p><br/><p>Lin Fan tossed it away immediately as he looked into the distance with a gaze of disdain, \u201cSo damned bloody shameless!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Good and Evil Buddha Sect\u2026</p><br/><p>The Boundless Future Buddha Lord looked down at the entire world with a contemptuous look on his face, gazing into the distance. As he opened his palm, ten Buddha Lords were seen sitting down cross-legged in the deepest parts of his palm. These ten Buddha Lords were linked with chains one after another, causing a mysterious Buddhist power to infuse into the body of the Boundless Future Buddha Lord from them.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Dao of the Heavenly Lord is one that is boundless without limits, profound with an infinite depth. It isn\u2019t something that you can enter just by depending on the evil path. Ancestor Master, you have entered the path of the devil.\u201d The Buddha Lords who were seated cross-legged within his palm called out.</p><br/><p>Closing his palms together, the Boundless Future Buddha Lord snorted out coldly before entering the void and heading toward the direction of the Ocean of Death, leaving a golden brilliance in its wake.</p><br/><p>Soon, the Boundless Future Buddha Lord arrived at the Ocean of Death. Walking into it, the Dimensional Portal activated, teleporting him right to the Moon Shadow Mainland.</p><br/><p>This was a new world right here, bearing a completely different outlook from the Endless Mainland.</p><br/><p>\u201cAmitabha.\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking at the countless of living beings here, the Boundless Future Buddha Lord muttered out the Buddhist chant softly, sending a boundless Buddhist Light seeping right into the Heaven and Earth. It was as though the light was trying to envelop the entire world within it.</p><br/><p>However, all of a sudden, the boundless Buddha Light seemed as though it was repelled by an obstruction of sorts, sending it bouncing and shrinking back into his body.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waited at the ruins of the Sword Qi Sect for several days. However, he saw no enemies arriving. Bored of it, he finally left the place.</p><br/><p>Boring\u2026 This was truly way too boring! To think that they wouldn\u2019t send any reinforcements even after a few days.</p><br/><p>Heaven and Earth Sect\u2026</p><br/><p>After returning, Lin Fan headed over to look for the Old Master right away.</p><br/><p>\u201cOld Master, I bumped into those outsiders once again. At the same time, I had a huge fight with one of the clones of the Undead Master God. I reckon that the strongest powers amongst those outsiders should be those Master Gods of theirs. They should also be of Immortal King states.\u201d Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>Geng Yangtian had already known of these affairs. \u201cAfter you left, I went over to some of the other sects and requested to browse through their records as well. At the same time, I went to visit some of the hermit seniors of the Immortal King state as well. I\u2019ve already found out the reason behind everything. The Moon Shadow Mainland is the place where these outsiders come from, a place which exists over the Ocean of Death.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded his head. \u201cOld Master, should we take the initiative to head over and strike at them so that we can give them a good beatdown right away?\u201d</p><br/><p>This was the very plan that Lin Fan had. Since the other party had already come knocking, why not just strike back at them directly? Who knew, they might even stand to gain something out of it.</p><br/><p>Geng Yangtian looked at Lin Fan before shaking his head, \u201cImpossible! The other side is way too strong. As for our sect, all the sects are divided, all fending for themselves. Unless we\u2019re united, there\u2019s most likely no way for us to defend against them at all.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already informed the other major sects regarding this affair now. I\u2019m sure they should understand what we should do.\u201d Geng Yangtian replied.</p><br/><p>With a situation as such, Lin Fan did not bear too much hope. Given those people right now, how could they possibly unite?</p><br/><p>This was especially the case for the Kunlun God Sect. If they were willing to join hands, that would be akin to bumping into ghosts right now.</p><br/><p>\u201cAmitabha!\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, a Buddhist voice traveled over.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood and Evil Buddha Sect.\u201d</p><br/><p>A tear appeared in the void from within the depths of the sect as a figure walked out.</p><br/><p>Looking at that fella, Lin Fan was somewhat taken aback, \u201cIt\u2019s you\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>He had not expected that it would be the Boundless Future Buddha Lord! How in the world did this fella manage to get out?</p><br/><p>Geng Yangtian\u2019s brows furrowed as he put up his guard right away. He knew of all the Old Masters from the Good and Evil Buddha Sect. But this guy here\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cOld Master, watch out. This is the Boundless Future Buddha Lord. He f*cked me over once in the past. To think that he would have gotten out.\u201d Lin Fan remarked.</p><br/><p>But, Lin Fan soon realized that this was merely a trace of the Boundless Future Buddha Lord\u2019s consciousness.</p><br/><p>\u201cGeng Yangtian, the reason for Your Buddha Lord\u2019s arrival here this time around is to clarify a certain matter. The affairs regarding the Shadow Moon Mainland is not something that concerns the Heaven and Earth Sect. After everything is done with, there will naturally be an encounter available for the Heaven and Earth Sect.\u201d The Boundless Future Buddha Lord spoke up.</p><br/><p>\u201cDoes not concern your mother! Bloody bald monk! How in the world did you get out?\u201d Lin Fan scolded him the moment he saw him.</p><br/><p>When the Boundless Future Buddha Lord caught sight of Lin Fan, he let out a slightly benevolent look, \u201cAh, it\u2019s you, Benefactor. Your Buddha Lord greets you politely.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck! Don\u2019t come here and act so hypocritically, you bloody devious bald monk! Your Daddy is here to tell you that I\u2019m definitely going to take this matter into my hands! As long as they dare to come, I\u2019ll destroy every single wave that they dare to send over!\u201d Lin Fan barked out angrily.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd also, bald monk, if you have got the bloody guts, send your true body over! Do you believe me when I say Your Daddy is going to whip you badly into shape?\u201d Lin Fan continued.</p><br/><p>\u201cBenefactor, that\u2019s insolent now.\u201d The tone of the Boundless Future Buddha Lord turned frosty. Initially, he wanted to strike out, but he then suddenly broke out into a faint smile. \u201cBenefactor, we\u2019ll meet again should affinity will it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*CK! You wanna run? Not so easy!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan hollered out as he threw a Supreme Grade Immortal Weapon over.</p><br/><p>\u201cSelf destruct!\u201d</p><br/><p>Geng Yangtian was startled, \u201cDon\u2019t\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>BAM!</p><br/><p>The depths of the sect began to quake. \u201cGosh, lad! Couldn\u2019t you wait! This place is extremely fragile, and cannot withstand the self destruction of a Supreme Grade Immortal Weapon!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAmitabha.\u201d The face of the Boundless Future Buddha Lord was still expressionless. Casting a final deep gaze over at Lin Fan, he dove into the void and got out of this place.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph! You\u2019re lucky you got away fast!\u201d Lin Fan scolded out.</p><br/><p>Geng Yangtian looked over at that area in the void where the Boundless Future Buddha Lord was standing moments earlier, \u201cBe careful from now on. That person\u2019s cultivation state is even higher than mine. He\u2019s most likely an Ancient Immortal King. That is an existence not to be underestimated.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded his head. He knew that the Boundless Future Buddha Lord was extremely strong. However, he wasn\u2019t afraid of him in the slightest bit.</p><br/><p>No matter what, the last chance of that soap was definitely saved for this guy here. This Boundless Future Buddha Lord had better start praying that he didn\u2019t bump into Lin Fan ever.</p></div>\n</div>"}

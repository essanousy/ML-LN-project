The key point was that having a bad attitude just wouldn\u2019t do. After all, Ni Mingyang\u2019s eggs felt quite painful even now.</p><br/><p>\u2018This junior brother's attack is a bit sinister\u2026 It seems there is a need to report this incident to senior-brother Meng.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cYes....yes.\u201d Lin Fan returned to himself and nodded while following Ni Mingyang inside.</p><br/><p>Along the way here, Lin Fan realized that the Saint Devil Sect was indeed a big sect; the size was rather too huge, to the point that one could get lost in it.</p><br/><p>\u201cOuter sect disciple, Ni Mingyang, recommending a talent\u2026 seeking an audience with Elder Li.\u201d Ni Mingyang said while standing respectfully outside the entrance.</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood\u2026\u201d At this time, a faint voice sounded from within the dark hall. This voice sounded a bit scary and cold, making one feel a chill deep down in the bones. Even the fearless Lin Fan involuntarily shuddered.</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior-brother Ni, how is the voice of elder Li this petrifying?\u201d Lin secretly asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cShhh, be cautious, junior-brother\u2026 Remember, in a moment, when you see elder Li, absolutely don\u2019t panic, understand?\u201d Ni Mingyang suddenly remembered something and was a bit regretful for not telling Lin Fan earlier. But now that they were already standing outside the hall, he couldn\u2019t really explain in detail either.</p><br/><p>\u201cPanic? What\u2019s there about panicking?\u201d Lin Fan was surprised for a moment and didn\u2019t quite understand, \u2018Was it possible this elder Li was a man-eating tiger? \u2018 But even so, Lin Fan was not scared. If it came down to it, one \u300aMonkey Steals Peach\u300b should do.</p><br/><p>\u201cShh, quiet, Elder Li has arrived.\u201d Ni Mingyang\u2019s expression slightly changed while he respectfully stood there. Lin Fan secretly glanced towards the person walking out from the darkness. Dressed in black robes, the figure was a bit burly.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, as a ray of sunlight shone on the face of Elder Li, Lin Fan\u2019s expression suddenly changed. His eyes were shimmering with disbelief while at the same time reflecting a bit of fear.</p><br/><p>\u2018This\u2026this...How could a human look like this?\u2019</p><br/><p>Half a human face, half a skeleton, such that one could even see the pulsing brain inside. Incredibly terrifying, it really was incredibly terrifying.</p><br/><p>Remembering Ni Mingyang\u2019s words, Lin Fan lowered his head, no longer observing Elder Li.</p><br/><p>Even if Lin Fan was open-minded, he had never faced this kind of situation before. If it weren't for Ni Mingyang\u2019s previous warning, Lin Fan would\u2019ve likely shouted out, \u201cA ghost!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Li, this is Lin Fan. His \u300aTitanium Grade Demon Body\u300b has been cultivated to a very high level, and can even defend against my eighth level precelestial full-powered strike.\u201d Ni Mingyang introduced in detail.</p><br/><p>The \u201cTalent Registration Hall\u201d was the Saint Devil Sect\u2019s foundation point. Countless talented disciples had been required to register with it, and from then tremendous investments allowed it to further develop.</p><br/><p>Earlier when the \u201cTalent Registration Hall\u201d was first created, the sect was highly attentive to the genius disciples, but as time went on, the number of geniuses continued to grow more and more. So the sect obviously couldn\u2019t provide an indefinite amount of resources, and thus even though the current \u201cTalent Registration Hall\u201d still received quite a lot of resources, it wasn\u2019t as crazy as it used to be.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, is that so? Then I would like to see.\u201d With this, Elder Li showed a hint of interest. Lin Fan stood there, and his weak body gave a sudden shudder.</p><br/><p>\u2018My God! Don\u2019t get so close to me.'</p><br/><p>.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan slightly raised his head, and his vision met with the flaring green of elder Li\u2019s eyes and the half skeleton face. \u201cAre you scared of my face?\u201d Elder Li smiled while observing the rather new midget sect member. Even though Lin Fan\u2019s expression was a bit disrespectful, Elder Li was not angry.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo...\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Don\u2019t joke around, I\u2019ll really be a complete idiot if I were to speak the truth now. But this elder Li\u2019s face really is rather bone-chilling.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cYou cannot blame the ignorant\u2026 In your path, you will meet people even scarier than me.\u201d Elder Li ridiculed and then rested one hand on Lin Fan\u2019s shoulder. Lin Fan immediately felt a stream of energy flow throughout his body, as if it were searching for something. Lin Fan was close to tears at this point.</p><br/><p>\u2018Being infiltrated by people twice in one day, you all will never obtain my virginity.\u2019</p><br/><p>Then, something that made Lin Fan even more panicked happened. The previous calm flaring green of elder Li\u2019s eyes suddenly began jumping and shining with much greater intensity than before, while staring at Lin Fan to the point of giving him goosebumps.</p><br/><p>\u2018My god, what are these people? Their stares make me feel so awkward. Penetrating, this glare has too much penetration power.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cGenius\u2026\u201dElder Li excitedly grabbed Lin Fan, \"Peerless genius\u2026To cultivate \u300aTitanium Grade Demon Body\u300b to such a level, a peerless genius that only appears once every thousands of years\u2026\u201d Ni Mingyang, who had been standing there respectfully the whole time, had previously just been thinking about how elder Li was really talkative today. But upon hearing Elder Li\u2019s first words, the corner of his mouth revealed a slight smile.</p><br/><p>\u2018Junior-brother is naturally a genius. Otherwise he wouldn\u2019t have been recommended here.\u2019 But when he heard the words that followed, Ni Mingyang was stunned.</p><br/><p>Peerless genius? Furthermore, a peerless genius that only appears once every thousands of years\u2026</p><br/><p>Upon hearing those words of elder Li, the already wide eyes of the fidgety Lin Fan became even wider.</p><br/><p>\u2018Haha...Genius\u2026Peerless genius\u2026A peerless genius that only appears once every thousands of years.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Elder Li, a peerless genius like myself that only appears once every thousands of years most definitely will receive the full protection of everyone in the entire sect right? Am I going to become the personal disciple of the sect head and receive personal guidance?\u201d Lin Fan was ecstatic at this point towards the Saint Devil Sect that treasured geniuses so dearly.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018A peerless genius that only appears every thousands of years like myself, won\u2019t I be treasured to the utmost? The various kinds of tremendous sect resources, on top of his own system, wouldn\u2019t that mean his days of becoming an invincible God are drawing near?</p><br/><p>Haha\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>As he continually thought about it, Lin Fan became thrilled, \u2018Who would\u2019ve thought that in this world, Yours Truly would be able to dine in such riches\u2026 The heavens are quite kind towards me.\u2019</p><br/><p>At this point, the previously excited elder Li suddenly calmed down.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, not bad\u2026 Come collect your outer sect necessities. Ni Mingyang, this is your reward for recommending a talent. Afterward, bring this newly initiated junior brother to the assigned residence and explain the Saint Devil Sect\u2019s commandments to him.\u201d Elder Li regained his calm and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Elder Li.\u201d Ni Mingyang respectfully received the reward and nodded. \u201cHuh\u2026?\u201dAt this moment, a basin of ice cold water poured over Lin Fan from head to toe, fully awakening him.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Li, but I am a peerless genius that only appears once every thousands of years, is this the only treatment I get?\u201d Lin Fan was frustrated, \u2018Was the previously excited expression just a lie? I was already prepared to meet the sect head, how did it become like this?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cAll things start from scratch\u2026 one step at a time. One must not be too hasty.\u201d With these words, elder Li\u2019s figure gradually disappeared into the darkness of the hall.</p><br/><p>\u2018F*ck\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was completely frustrated at this point, \u2018This shouldn\u2019t be how things go.\u2019 The peerless geniuses in novels, if they weren\u2019t hacked to death by people, then they would be cradled like a treasure by them. \u2018A peerless genius that only appears every thousands of years and this is the treatment I get...The heavens and great earth\u2026give me an explanation!\u2019</p><br/>\n</div>"}

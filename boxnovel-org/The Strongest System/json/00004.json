Upon listening more carefully, one could feel a kind of endless sorrow and grief contained in them.</p><br/><p>Currently, Lin Fan was repeating the same action repeatedly; bending his waist, reaching out his hand and crushing with his fingers.</p><br/><p>Again and again, even if the world were to end, nothing could stop Lin Fan\u2019s longing for experience.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou despicable little scumbag\u2026 using such a dirty move!\u201d The outer sect examination disciples were panicking in disarray, both hands covering their crotch, as a cold air rose from the bottom of their feet to the top of their head.</p><br/><p>Such terror\u2026 this was actually petrifying.</p><br/><p>\u201cDing\u2026 Two-bit martial skill \u300aMonkey Steals Peach\u300b raised to third level.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDing\u2026 defeated lousy two-bit disciple\u2026 experience + 5.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDing\u2026 defeated lousy two-bit disciple\u2026 experience + 3.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2018Oh!\u2019, Lin Fan heard these notifications, his heart throbbing wildly with ecstasy, \u2018Who would've thought this was how the experience for character level came from\u2026Seems like this is similar to a game, defeating a monster to level up\u2026Not bad, not bad.\u2019</p><br/><p>At this moment, the outer sect disciples that suffered greatly at the hands of Lin Fan all looked at this scumbag with despising eyes. But at this point, they suddenly realized that the said sc*mbag\u2019s eyes now had an intense glare that sent fear throughout their bodies, as if something even more terrible was about to happen.</p><br/><p>A group of outer sect examination disciples surrounded Lin Fan. Even though the scumbag in front of them utilized a foul move that they were unable to defend against, they still were unable to accept doing something like tucking their tails and running away.</p><br/><p>Even if they had to pay a great price, they needed to make this nasty scumbag fall here. Lin Fan stared coldly at both of his hands. This pair of hands was about to become tarnished, but if it meant gaining experience, merely staining his hands was utterly trivial.</p><br/><p>\u201cLook, his eyes!\u201d The front row of outer sect examination disciples exclaimed. They were carefully observing the dirty scumbag, and the moment Lin Fan\u2019s eyes flashed a sudden realization dawned upon them.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked up, a deep feeling of guilt within his eyes. He looked around at the group of outer sect examination disciples.</p><br/><p>\u201cInnocent lambs, you are all about to be tainted by this pair of wretched hands\u2026 But don\u2019t worry, I will hold back.\u201d Lin Fan stared intensely at the surrounding outer sect examination disciples.</p><br/><p>\u201cDirty scumbag, what did you say?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou think you alone can defeat the hundreds of us?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKneel down and apologize, then we\u2019ll spare your life.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph, don't be too presumptuous\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cMonkey Steals Peach\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly Lin Fan rushed into the group. A 5th level \u300aTitanium Grade Demon Body\u300b to these outer sect examination disciples was essentially a tank with perfect defense, rampaging about with no attacks being able to cause any damage.</p><br/><p>And even though \u300aMonkey Steals Peach\u300b was only at the third level, it now had reached a point of unstoppable perfection.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou dirty little scumbag, I will take you on.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOw, it hurts! Let go, let go\u2026 it\u2019s being crushed.....crushed.\u201d A certain outer sect examination disciple cried in misery. His vision began to blur, his body shuddered violently, both hands clutching his crotch, and tears containing thousands of indescribable emotions forming at the corner of his eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cA man must have face no matter what, but you have now destroyed my face. I will never let this go in this life.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cMonkey Steals Peach\u201d</p><br/><p>+5</p><br/><p>+5</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026 defeated lousy two-bit disciple\u2026 experience + 5.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026 defeated lousy two-bit disciple\u2026 experience + 2.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026 congratulations character leveled up.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>At this moment, Lin Fan was essentially like a wild demon, with both hands outstretched, bringing out the full potential of \u300aMonkey Steals Peach\u300b, as if writing a whole new law regarding the cultivation of \u300aMonkey Steals Peach\u300b.</p><br/><p>A sure-fire hit with each strike\u2026 no matter how one defended, one couldn\u2019t stop the God-like hands of Lin Fan from invading.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrothers, this wretched person uses such dirty moves. Even though we are members of a devil sect, we wouldn\u2019t stoop so low and attack like that.\u201d</p><br/><p>As the outer sect examination disciples began retreating one by one, one disciple who could be said to possess an unparalleled beauty began rallying his fellow brothers to unite and bring down Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Like a weaving dragon, Lin Fan moved back and forth between the outer sect examination disciples, and this particular outer sect examination disciple acting so arrogant caught his attention.</p><br/><p>The pretty boy suddenly felt an invasive gaze lock firmly upon him, and his heart jolted with a bad feeling. When his eyes met with Lin Fan\u2019s, the pretty boy began cowering back in fear. If Lin Fan\u2019s attacks weren\u2019t aimed at that unspeakable spot, it would be fine even if he were defeated. His strength may not match against him, but at least he wouldn\u2019t be scared.</p><br/><p>But right now he was terrified.</p><br/><p>Seeing so many of his fellow brothers fall at the hands of this guy, especially the look of utter tragedy within their eyes, he understood it definitely hurt a lot.</p><br/><p>As the pretty boy saw the clenched hands of Lin Fan, a cold air began to rise, and his two legs began to involuntarily shudder.</p><br/><p>\u201cMonkey Steals Peach\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo!!!!!!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh...It hurts!\u201d The vision of the pretty boy blurred, as he lightly called out and immediately fell down while twitching. This scene of horrible misery made people unable to even look.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>When all the outer sect examination disciples fell upon the ground, Lin Fan also had no more peaches to steal.</p><br/><p>Name: Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Level: 9 (Precelestial stage waiting to be unlocked)</p><br/><p>Experience points: (0/1000)</p><br/><p>Martial Skills: \u300aTitanium Grade Demon Body\u300b 5th Level (3000/10000)</p><br/><p>\u300aMonkey Steals Peach\u300b 10th level (1000/10000)</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at his character data panel and nodded with satisfaction. Now that his level had risen to nine, he was an invincible being to the outer sect examination disciples in front of him.</p><br/><p>A number was floating above the forehead of all the outer sect examination disciples; some had level 5, some level 6, some even level 8.</p><br/><p>None of these outer sect examination disciples had yet reached the precelestial stage.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan had seen the attacks of precelestial stage disciples before, their attacks were nothing like those of these outer sect examination disciples.</p><br/><p>Three days later was the outer sect examinations, and even though he didn\u2019t possess a competitive heart, he had to become an outer sect disciple. In the end, this place was too small for Lin Fan. If he wanted to become stronger, he would need an even bigger world.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan turned around and began to leave, but stopped after a few steps.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will come again tomorrow.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Those who previously saw this despicable scumbag beginning to leave had started to slowly stand up, but upon hearing those words, their legs lost the strength, and once again collapsed on the ground.</p><br/><p>After what happened today, they no longer had the heart to fight with him again. Dirty, despicable, shameless, how could such a person appear in this world? Lin Fan sighed. What these outer sect examination disciples thought of him was something Lin Fan also understood in his heart. But how could this all be his fault? After all, he only knew the move \u300aMonkey Steals Peach\u300b.</p><br/><p>There is a saying that describes this very well.</p><br/><p>\u201cOne move to rule them all.\u201d</p><br/><p>Since he only knew one martial arts technique for now, there was no point in minding it. Also, Lin Fan discovered that body training arts were different from martial arts.</p><br/><p>When \u300aTitanium Grade Demon Body\u300b rose to a certain level, it needed the help of stronger external forces to further upgrade it. But for martial arts, regardless of the opponent\u2019s strength, they all gave experience. Even though there was a difference between the amount strong and weak opponents gave, but no matter how weak or strong the opponent was, they all still gave some experience at least.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

The pain's killing me!\"</p><br/><p>The Crown Prince was wailing out relentlessly. His back was filled with red marks. Even though his skin did not tear, the pain was still tormenting him to no end.</p><br/><p>\"Crown Prince, the pills are here.\" A Pills Cultivation Master hurried over while holding onto an elixir.</p><br/><p>The cultivation state of the Crown Prince wasn't weak. If these were ordinary injuries, he could have healed them up with his own powers. But, to his great shock, no matter how hard he tried to channel his powers, he could not purge the pain away at all!</p><br/><p>\"Hurry up\u2026! Hurry up!\" The Crown Prince shouted out impatiently.</p><br/><p>At a moment as such, he could only give the elixir of a Pill Cultivation Master a shot.</p><br/><p>But, when the Crown Prince popped down the elixir and waited for it to take effect, he realized that there was no sh*t use at all!</p><br/><p>\"What is this pill that you've cultivated? How is it totally useless?!\" The Crown Prince blared out in rage. The Pill Cultivation Master was so scared that he collapsed to his knees and knelt down while his forehead was filled with sweat.</p><br/><p>The elixir was useless? How could it be? This elixir was something that was cultivated by gathering tons of godly medicines! How could it be useless?</p><br/><p>\"Son, what's wrong?\" Right at this moment, an authoritative voice boomed out. A man wearing a long yellow robe walked over with steady steps.</p><br/><p>When the Crown Prince caught sight of who it was, he started crying out immediately, \"Father! There's an owner of a Pill Shop in the city who had dared to offend beyond his status\u2026!\"</p><br/><p>\"To think that there would be something as such! That is an unpardonable crime!\" The moment the Emperor of the Solitary Heavens City heard of this affair, that mighty face of his was enraged. This was a downright provocation of the royal family!</p><br/><p>\"My son, you just take good rest! This matter, Your Father shall seek redressal for you!\"</p><br/><p>\"Thank you, father!\" The Crown Prince was elated beyond anything else. If his father were to head down personally, that damned fella would have no choice but to surrender!</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>But naturally, what the Crown Prince did not know was that after his father headed back, he had summoned the mercenaries over to him. When he clarified the entire affair, his face took on a myriad of expressions.</p><br/><p>\"Based on your word, that young man did not even go all out? It seems more as though he's intending to hide within the Solitary Heavens City!\"</p><br/><p>The mercenaries who had received Lin Fan's attack nodded their heads in response.</p><br/><p>\"That's right. The power of our strongest mercenary is already that of a Divine celestial level 9 state being. And yet, just like all of us, he could not make out how the other party had attacked at all. Even a Divine celestial level 10, Eternal God state powerful being would not be this strong. By the looks of it, he should be of Supreme state, or even higher.\" One of the mercenaries replied.</p><br/><p>Upon hearing these words, the Emperor naturally froze up. A powerful being that was at the Supreme state and above? This was some character that was absolutely heaven revolting!</p><br/><p>Even though they had the protection of the utmost powerful beings, the Solitary Heavens City was but a small little city! Whether it existed or was destroyed wasn't something that the Old Master would bother with at all.</p><br/><p>\"According to you guys then, do you think that this mysterious powerful being poses a threat to the Imperial City?\" This was the matter that the Emperor was the most concerned about right now.</p><br/><p>\"I don't think so. As a powerful being, he naturally has the magnanimity of a powerful being. Even though the Crown Prince and the Missy of the Shang Family had openly provoked him twice, they did not end up with any fatal injuries. Not only that, to us, he seemed to be only chasing us away, and did not do anything overboard. I suppose that he should be trying to keep a low profile and hide within the Solitary Heavens City.\"</p><br/><p>\"In the opinion of your subject here, I think that the fact that the Crown Prince was able to meet such a powerful being is a celebratory news tantamount to the Heavens. If that mysterious powerful being had truly wanted to kill the Crown Prince, none of us would have been able to stop him. After all, we're nothing but ants in the eyes of these powerful beings. If the Crown Prince were to settle this on his own, who knows if there might be any connection to be made out of this.\" The mercenary said.</p><br/><p>These words of the mercenary had the heart of the Emperor blossoming with happiness.</p><br/><p>A supreme powerful being! That was not half bad now!</p><br/><p>Initially, the Crown Prince had wanted to depend on his father for help. But by the looks of it, he had already been sold out by his father.</p><br/><p>It was the same for the Shang Family right now. The Family Head of the Shang Family had the same idea as the Emperor, that this was an affinity for them. Therefore, he just placated Shang Qingcheng a little and had her go settle the mess on her own.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>At this moment, Lin Fan was feeling joyous all over after having taught the Crown Prince and Shang Qingcheng a lesson. At times, it was pretty okay to find some things to do as well.</p><br/><p>And just at this moment, his brows furrowed as he looked over to the vast, boundless void.</p><br/><p>This was the aura of an utmost powerful being.</p><br/><p>\"Wantian, look after the shop.\" Lin Fan stood up and dove into the endless void. Yang Wantian looked at his Master who had disappeared and felt extremely astonished in his heart. He wondered just what sort of a background his Master had.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>\"Motherf*cking Human King, this is the first time we're meeting.\" The moment Lin Fan appeared in the void, a voice traveled into his ears.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan froze up. To think that he would have been discovered by someone!</p><br/><p>\"Motherf*cking Human King, you do not have to worry. I mean no harm.\"</p><br/><p>When the figure appeared before Lin Fan, he was even more petrified, \"The Power Demonic God of the Ancient race, Pangu!\"</p><br/><p>Pangu looked exactly like all the other Ancient race beings. However, his aura was extremely composed, and was nowhere as berserk as the others.</p><br/><p>At the same time, Lin Fan could tell that Pangu was the centrifuge of all power. There was an extremely boundless force that was emanated out from his body.</p><br/><p>This was the power of the extremes that could destroy everything. It was a power that could tear down the entire world.</p><br/><p>\"Demonic God Pangu, how did you find me out?\" Lin Fan asked.</p><br/><p>\"The moment you entered the Solitary Heavens City, I had already sensed it.\" Demonic God Pangu chuckled out while saying. However, because of the fact that he was still an Ancient race being, this laughter was still pretty scary to look at.</p><br/><p>\"You don't wish to kill me?\" Lin Fan asked again.</p><br/><p>Right now, he was the target that must be killed in the eyes of countless of utmost powerful beings. After all, he was someone who had stolen a whole bunch of Legendary Items.</p><br/><p>As for this Demonic God Pangu, he was probably the highest of all the existences amongst the utmost powerful beings.</p><br/><p>When his powers were accumulated to a certain extent, a fist could destroy everything in this world.</p><br/><p>If he were to fight with the other party, even this Immemorial Ancient full cultivation state physical body of his might not be able to withstand even a single blow of it.</p><br/><p>\"Haha! Why would I want to kill you? The only reason why I came forth this time around was because I wanted to see for myself just what sort of a person this Motherf*cking Human King is who had caused all the other utmost powerful beings to run around in circles in a fluster.\"</p><br/><p>\"Are you the one watching over these living beings here? But, you're a Demonic God of the Ancient race, right?\" Lin Fan asked curiously.</p><br/><p>\"This is the race of my Sworn Brother. However, my Sworn Brother has fallen several eras ago. Right now, I'm just helping him to take care of them thoroughly.\" Demonic God Pangu replied.</p><br/><p>Towards Pangu, Lin Fan was still slightly on his guard. As long as things didn't seem right, he would retreat immediately.</p><br/><p>When the Demonic God Pangu realized that Lin Fan was still being wary of him, he chuckled out as well and then spoke up, \"Your powers are decent. But, it's a pity that you haven't sought out the true source of power just yet. I'll gift this to you.\"</p><br/><p>A golden imprint flew out of the palms of the Demonic God Pangu. Within this golden imprint was a horrifying power.</p><br/><p>\"This\u2026!\"</p><br/><p>Right now, Lin Fan was completely dumbfounded. What in the world was this Demonic God Pangu doing here? Was he just here to give him an item?</p><br/><p>\"You don't have to think too much about it. This era is the final era. But, it's a pity that the others do not know that this has got nothing to do with their fortunes coming to an end. It's just that the Outworld Vessel is on its brink of destruction.\"</p><br/><p>\"If they could have transcended, they would have transcended a couple of eras ago.\" The Demonic God Pangu continued.</p><br/><p>\"What does that mean?\" Lin Fan's brains were starting to hurt right now. The influx of information was getting a little too much.</p><br/><p>\"Hahaha. You'll understand once you reach that level. The sooner you understand, the more pressure it will bring forth for you, that's all.\" The Demonic God Pangu laughed out before he tore through the void and disappeared from where he was.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan blinked his eyes as he stood on the spot. So, what in the world did he make the trip here for?</p><br/><p>However, when that golden imprint made contact with his hands, the notification from the System came through.</p><br/><p>'Ding\u2026Discovered Intent of Power.'</p><br/>\n</div>"}

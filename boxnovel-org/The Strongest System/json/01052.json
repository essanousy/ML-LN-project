The Kunlun God Mountain is a Supreme Grade Immortal Weapon! It has even gone through the ablution of the Kunlun God Sect\u2019s fortune! Even if we wanted to refine the Kunlun God Mountain, it wouldn\u2019t be an easy task!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan, who was in the midst of secretly refining the Kunlun God Mountian, raised his head and peered through the water surface. When he caught sight of how pained the expression on Tian Fengling\u2019s face was, his heart skipped with joy.</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe! Since you wanted to suppress Yours Truly, Yours Truly shall refine the Kunlun God Mountain today so that you can go bankrupt!\u201d The connection between the Kunlun God Mountain and Tian Fengling was still existent. Not only that, this Kunlun God Mountain was his true body. If it were to be refined, he would definitely have to take a huge amount of damage.</p><br/><p>\u201cDEGENERATE! YOU DEGENERATE! I MUST FIND HIM!\u201d Tian Fengling howled out madly. He had never once felt an anger of this level. He could no longer endure everything that had happened today.</p><br/><p>\u2018Refine!\u2019 Lin Fan yelled out in his heart.</p><br/><p>The Weapon Spirit of the Kunlun God Mountain within the Heaven and Earth Smelt was wailing out right now as well. Under this power of refinement, there was no chance of it fighting back at all. No matter how great its true body was, it was all rendered useless within this Heaven and Earth Smelt.</p><br/><p>\u201cARGH!\u201d</p><br/><p>The tragic cries were relentless and rang out through the entire Heaven and Earth. Right now, Tian Fengling\u2019s heart was traumatized and his face was pale as a sheet, looking as terrible as it could. At the same time, there was a mouthful of fresh blood that sprayed out while his body convulsed endlessly as though he could collapse at any moment.</p><br/><p>Tian Qiantian hurried up ahead to help support him, then took out an Immortal Pill and had him swallow it. The former\u2019s face was frighteningly scary at this moment as well.</p><br/><p>Urgh!</p><br/><p>When one consumed an Immortal Pill, it could change the fate of one\u2019s life. But at this moment, no matter what Immortal Pills Tian Fengling consumed, it was all useless. He spat out yet another mouthful of fresh blood as his spirit withered.</p><br/><p>Even at this point, Tian Fengling could not figure out just how the other fella did it at all.</p><br/><p>This was not something as simple as severing his connection with the Kunlun God Mountain! This was just completely destroying the connection altogether!</p><br/><p>For most powerful beings, even if they were to refine Immortal Weapons, they would not be able to achieve a connection as intense as that of Tian Fengling and the Kunlun God Mountain. If one fell, the other fell as well. There was no avoiding it.</p><br/><p>\u201cDAMN IT! GOD DAMN IT!\u201d Tian Fengling howled out and clenched his teeth. Eventually, he severed that connection he had with the Kunlun God Mountain entirely.</p><br/><p>Right now, he was already severely injured. If this were to continue on, being injured might be the least of his worries.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026Congratulations on refining success.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026Obtained Kunlun God Mountain\u2019s Power of Source.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026Obtained Kunlun God Mountain\u2019s Power of Fortune.\u2019</p><br/><p>Lin Fan discovered two balls of light floating within the Heaven and Earth Smelt. However, he was busy trying to keep his life right now. Therefore, he did not have the time to analyze these two items properly.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve severed your own connection with the Kunlun God Mountain!\u201d Tai Qiantian exclaimed out in shock. To think that this disciple of the Heaven and Earth Sect would have the capabilities to refine the Kunlun God Mountain without them being able to detect it at all! He had even forced Tian Fengling to manually sever his connection with the God Mountain! For the Kunlun God Sect, this was a tremendous loss!</p><br/><p>Tian Fengling was immensely weak right now as his Essence, Spirit, and Vitality were dissipating out of his body. If not for the Immortal Pill that was curbing the injury, he might have already fainted over.</p><br/><p>This was no simple injury this time around; it was an injury of his very Essence Spirit. Even his true body had been destroyed by someone else. This was probably a loss he could not withstand at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I didn\u2019t sever the connection, the outcome would have been even worse.\u201d Tian Fengling said, \u201cI\u2019m not done with the Heaven and Earth Sect for this matter just yet. But right now, I\u2019ve got to head back and retreat into seclusion. Otherwise, my cultivation state is going to be unstable, and might very well drop to a point where I can never progress any further in the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tai Qiantian was completely taken aback. Tian Fengling was a Vice Grandmaster of the Kunlun God Sect. If anything were to happen to him, it would be a tremendous loss for the sect as well.</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan, who had been hiding there the entire time, saw how the few figures up in the void had disappeared, he heaved out a sigh of relief momentarily. As long as they were gone, it was all good. But, given the situation right now, it\u2019d be best for him to wait and observe for a bit more. God knew if these fellas would have more tricks hiding up their sleeves or something.</p><br/><p>A few days later\u2026</p><br/><p>Only after confirming his safety did Lin Fan dare to move slowly. Following that, he swam freely through the lake like a fish before climbing up the shore sneakily and walking on. He did not even dare to fly at this moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cTruly a bunch of trashes! Even though their strength is so incredible, they couldn\u2019t even seek me out! And he even dares to call himself the Grandmaster of the Kunlun God Sect! Huehuehue\u2026!\u201d Lin Fan was extremely delighted right now.</p><br/><p>However, he still felt some lingering fears in his heart. If not for the flames of Pills Through Thought, it might have truly been difficult for him to want to break through this Kunlun God Mountain!</p><br/><p>Somewhere secretive\u2026</p><br/><p>Lin Fan took out those two balls of Powers.</p><br/><p>\u2018Source of Kunlun God Mountain: Connate Heavenly God Mountain. Master of the Earth Spirit. If one were to consume it, they would be able to bring any Earth related mystic skills to the full cultivation state.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Kunlun God Mountain\u2019s Power of Fortune: Can be consumed to get blessed with the fortune of the Kunlun God Sect and have a heaven defying fortune. Can be converted to an astronomical amount of experience points.\u2019</p><br/><p>To think that these two things would have such an effect! This was truly pretty decent! Without hesitating much, Lin Fan then consumed them both.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026Congratulations on consuming Source of Kunlun God Mountain. Earth based mystic skill attained full cultivation state. Connate Element of Earth upgraded.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026Congratulations on consuming Kunlun God Mountain\u2019s Power of Fortune. Converting into experience points.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026Experience Points +\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026Cultivation State leveled up.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Cultivation State: Golden Immortal full cultivation state.\u2019</p><br/><p>Right now, Lin Fan was way too exhilarated in his heart. The rate at which his cultivation state was rising at was way too fast! Now that he had already reached the Golden Immortal full cultivation state, wanting to turn into an Ancestor Immortal would most likely be nothing difficult anymore!</p><br/><p>In order to soothe that damaged mental state of his, Lin Fan had decided to rest here for an entire night. After all, everything that had happened today was way too dangerous. If not for the fact that he was quick-witted, he might truly have been dug right into a pit by that fella there.</p><br/><p>Coming out of the sect, Lin Fan\u2019s main motive was to meet powerful beings and have them killed so that he could gain a tremendous amount of experience points.</p><br/><p>The places he had obtained information about from the sect were all places that powerful beings would frequent. It was only there that Lin Fan could meet even more outrageous existences.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>At the very moment Lin Fan went into rest, something was going on in a far and distant section of spacetime \u2026</p><br/><p>An elderly man was holding onto a sparkling Immortal Brush and was writing something on a banner that exuded a godly aura. If some of the older powerful beings were to catch sight of this elderly man, they would definitely be astounded.</p><br/><p>This elderly man was the descendant of the Heavenly Lord Dao Comprehension!</p><br/><p>Heavenly Lord Dao Comprehension might be the weakest existence amongst the Heavenly Lords, but there was nothing within this entire universe that could escape his sight.</p><br/><p>The True Immortal Substitute Roll.</p><br/><p>The Golden Immortal Roll.</p><br/><p>The Ancestor Immortal Roll.</p><br/><p>These were all created by the hands of the Heavenly Lord Dao Comprehension.</p><br/><p>After the Heavenly Lord Dao Comprehension had fallen, he infused the wisdom of the Laws that he had comprehended into a brush so that it could be passed down, and have his descendants continue writing about everything that happened in the world.</p><br/><p>The cultivation state of this elderly man was profound and imperceptible. When he looked at the contents that were written out on the banner, he was completely startled.</p><br/><p>\u2018Heaven and Earth Sect Grandmaster Candidate disciple Lin Fan suppressed the Kunlun God Sect Vice Grandmaster, Tian Fengling\u2019s life Immortal Weapon, Kunlun God Mountain.\u2019</p><br/>\n</div>"}

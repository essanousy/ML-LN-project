Even if I were to lose it all today, I, Zhang Ergou, have to assist them!\" Zhang Ergou\u2019s blood was pumping with adrenaline. Flicking his robes, all sorts of f*cked up pills flew up towards the sky as well.</p><br/><p>However, the moment these pills came into contact with Han Yongyi\u2019s powerful aura, they dissipated into nothingness, leaving zero impact.</p><br/><p>Towards this, Zhang Ergou could only sigh helplessly.</p><br/><p>\"Seems like I\u2019m just too trash after all.\" Zhang Ergou was a little forlorn. To think that these pills he had cultivated with his heart and soul would just disappear into nothing before even coming into contact with the enemy. He was pretty disappointed indeed.</p><br/><p>However, looking at the look of respect from the other junior brothers around him, Zhang Ergou was secretly glad as well. Looking at the distance, he couldn\u2019t help but worry. His Junior Brother Mie was about to head into a treacherous situation after all.</p><br/><p>\"What are you guys here for? I can do it alone!\" Mie Qiongqi had a strong ego. Looking at these people who had leaped forth to lend a hand, he was somewhat displeased.</p><br/><p>\"Senior Brother Mie, now that the sect\u2019s in danger, we can\u2019t allow you to steal all the glory to yourself!\" Meng Hao forced out a smile on his face.</p><br/><p>\"What are we still chattering on about! The enemy ahead is already hard enough to deal with!\" Jian Wudi seemed to be gliding through the sky as his eyes were focused forward.</p><br/><p>\u2018All of you are my stepping stones! I won\u2019t allow you to die right here!\" Lu Yan said proudly.</p><br/><p>\"Good guts, junior brothers, good guts.\" Taking a glance, Mie Qiongqi laughed coldly as well.</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>\"Hmph. A small bunch of clowns and they dare to vie for light against a brightly shining moon like me?\" In the skies, Han Yongyi\u2019s face was filled with disdain, \u2018I\u2019ll show you that it\u2019s courting death for a bunch of ants to dare to fight against the Heavens!\"</p><br/><p>\"Hmph, even though I may be at a lesser celestial full cultivation base right now, I, Mie Qiongqi, shall see just how strong a greater celestial is then!\"</p><br/><p>\"Indestructible Body!\"</p><br/><p>With a maddened roar, Unkillable Indestructible began to churn furiously as a devastating aura began to be emitted. An illusion of an ancient figure appeared behind Mie Qiongqi momentarily as well. With a maddened growl, it sent out boundless amount of energy as well.</p><br/><p>\"Duel the Heavens and Destroy the Earth!\"</p><br/><p>Jian Wudi\u2019s sword style was bent on destroying the Heavens and Earth, as his immense Sword Will took on the form of an elderly man, who dashed up towards the skies.</p><br/><p>\"Suppress\u2026!\"</p><br/><p>Lu Yan shouted out. His body gleamed brightly as a figure of a Buddha sitting cross-legged with his palms closed together flew towards the strike, while chanting mysterious scriptures.</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>The sight of this seemingly unstoppable palm strike being stopped was enough to have the Glory Sect disciples watching in amazement.</p><br/><p>Despite his serious injuries, Yan Hongyu let out a smile inside his heart. \u2018Power be to Glory Sect indeed.\u2019 Now that Glory Sect possessed so many geniuses within their midst, there was no way it should go down just like this.</p><br/><p>\"Hmph, trash\u2026!\" Han Yongyi snorted coldly in the skies. Suddenly, thunder started rumbling as the power level of the palm strike increased as well.</p><br/><p>BAM!</p><br/><p>A sudden explosion appeared as Lu Yan\u2019s Buddha figure started breaking apart, and he spat out a mouthful of fresh blood. As for Jian Wudi\u2019s Sword Will, it started twisting and contorting until it turned into ashes as well.</p><br/><p>\"So\u2026strong\u2026!\" Everyone was aghast as they exclaimed. The power level of someone in the realm of a greater celestial full cultivation was seriously way too strong, wasn\u2019t it?!?</p><br/><p>There was simply no room for resistance!</p><br/><p>In the face of true power, even these geniuses were rendered helpless.</p><br/><p>\"I\u2019ll fight you till the bitter end! Ancient Destruction!\" Only one was left defending against the palm strike. Blood was gushing out from all parts of Mie Qiongqi\u2019s body as he screamed. With that, his aura grew even stronger. It was as if that ancient illusory figure behind him was bent on surpassing everything in this world in acknowledgment of its eternity.</p><br/><p>\"Interesting fella indeed. What a pity that the skills are wasted on someone like you.\" With another snort of contempt, Han Yongyi set loose yet another burst of energy.</p><br/><p>\"Urgh\u2026!!!\" With the increase of power once more, Mie Qiongqi could not stop spitting out blood. The ancient figure started to disintegrate as well. In the face of absolute power, even heaven-defying skills were no match for it.</p><br/><p>\"Junior Brother\u2026!\" Zhang Ergou shouted out worriedly as he rushed forth to help up his fallen junior brother.</p><br/><p>Usually cold and nonchalant to everything else, Mie Qiongqi\u2019s eyes were darting nonstop right now, as though he could break apart at any moment. \"Senior Brother, I\u2019ve tried\u2026my best\u2026I didn\u2019t lose\u2026Saint Devil Sect\u2019s\u2026face\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\u2018Junior brother, don\u2019t speak anymore! Please! You\u2019ve been strong for all of us! Even if Master were here right now, he wouldn\u2019t blame you at all! Not in the least bit!\" Looking at Mie Qiongqi\u2019s current state, tears flowed down uncontrollably from Zhang Ergou\u2019s face. Even though this junior brother might have been pretty cold usually, he was still respectful when he needed to be.</p><br/><p>\"No\u2026Master tasked me to\u2026protect Saint Devil Sect...Even if\u2026I\u2026die\u2026I mustn\u2019t let\u2026Master down!!!\u2019 At the end of his sentence, those feeble eyes of Mie Qiongqi reignited with passion once more. The dissipated energy from his body erupted out as well.</p><br/><p>\"Junior Brother!\" Looking at Mie Qiongqi, Zhang Ergou exclaimed out in shock.</p><br/><p>\"ARGH\u2026!!!\u2019</p><br/><p>Floating up into the skies again, Mie Qiongqi reared his head back and screamed, \"I shall protect Saint Devil Sect down to the last drop of my blood! No one shall dare to invade us! Ever!\"</p><br/><p>\"Junior Brother, enough! It\u2019s enough! Please don\u2019t go anymore! You\u2019ll die!\" Zhang Ergou yelled after Mie Qiongqi.</p><br/><p>\"NO! DOWN TILL MY LAST DROP OF BLOOD! I MUST ENSURE SAINT DEVIL SECT\u2019S SAFETY!\" Mie Qiongqi\u2019s determination was burning at its peak right now.</p><br/><p>\"Destruction of Worlds!\" Mie Qiongqi bellowed. The True Energy within his body spiked up massively. Spraying in all directions, his blood painted the entire ground.</p><br/><p>\"Hmph. A creature who doesn\u2019t fear death indeed.\" Han Yongyi chuckled coldly. He sent out another palm strike. Just from the feel of it, this palm strike was way more intense than the previous one.</p><br/><p>\"Even if my spirit and soul shall shatter, I\u2019ll die for Saint Devil Sect\u2019s safety!\" At this point, Mie Qiongqi emanated an aura he had never felt before. This was energy that was borrowed from the void.</p><br/><p>\"F*CK YOU!\" Burning with lifeforce right now, Mie Qiongqi darted towards Han Yongyi with a palm strike of his own in retaliation.</p><br/><p>Sensing the sudden burst of energy from the man he had thought to be an ant, Han Yongyi\u2019s face changed as well. He shouted in rage, \"Heaven Rumbling Palm Strike!\"</p><br/><p>Han Yongyi\u2019s aura was wild like a beast right now as his True Energy twisted maniacally. With his single palm strike, the structures of Glory Sect began to crumble.</p><br/><p>For the sake of protecting his sect, Mie Qiongqi had exerted the last of his energy and had prepared to die for it. However, his face suddenly changed. Looking at Glory Sect\u2019s grounds being destroyed rapidly, Mie Qiongqi yelled and changed direction towards the distance immediately.</p><br/><p>He had realized something. The destruction was going to reach Nameless Peak. His Master\u2019s most beloved junior disciple, Junior Sister Zhiqiao, was hiding inside there right now\u2026!</p><br/><p>Inside the secret chamber\u2026</p><br/><p>Cai Zhiqiao was huddled in Gong Bingye\u2019s embrace. They could hear the noises of the battle outside.</p><br/><p>\"Sister Gong, is everything going to be alright?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes, of course!\" Gong Bingye comforted Cai Zhiqiao. But she too, wasn\u2019t certain.</p><br/><p>After all, Glory Sect was a major sect. If someone dared to attack Glory Sect, then they must be pretty formidable themselves as well.</p><br/><p>\"Not good\u2026!\" Suddenly, Gong Bingye\u2019s face changed. She could sense a strong force heading towards their direction.</p><br/><p>Even at a distance, the force was strong enough to turn Gong Bingye\u2019s face pale as a sheet. She gritted her teeth and hugged Cai Zhiqiao tightly, covering her.</p><br/><p>\"What are you doing, Sister Gong?\"</p><br/><p>\"Don\u2019t be afraid.\" Gong Bingye\u2019s teeth were chattering right now as she shivered uncontrollably. She closed her eyes, waiting for the impending force.</p><br/><p>BOOM!</p><br/><p>The Heavens and Earth shattered as a tragic cry rang out.</p><br/><p>When Gong Bingye finally opened her eyes, she found Mie Qiongqi lying down beside them, fragile and weak. He had taken the blow for them.</p><br/><p>\"Mie Qiongqi\u2026!\" Gong Bingye stared at him in extreme shock.</p><br/><p>\"Protect\u2026junior\u2026sister\u2026\" Mie Qiongqi\u2019s breath grew weaker and weaker. Eventually, after finishing his sentence, he laid there, still and motionless.</p><br/><p>As Cai Zhiqiao stared at the scene before her, those bright happy eyes were gradually filled with horror upon this terrifying realization. To a fragile, young soul, this was a deadly trauma.</p><br/><p>\"Senior\u2026SENIOR BROTHER!!!\" Forcing herself out of Gong Bingye\u2019s embrace, she darted towards Mie Qiongqi\u2019s side. Even when the wind blew away her precious pouch, she paid it no heed as she shook Mie Qiongqi\u2019s wrist furiously, checking for his pulse.</p><br/><p>\"SENIOR BROTHER! YOU MUST WAKE UP\u2026!\" Tears began to brim on her big, wide eyes. In Saint Devil Sect, other than Lin Fan, her 2 favorite people were Zhang Ergou and Mie Qiongqi.</p><br/><p>Even though Mie Qiongqi was cold to everyone else, he was extremely doting towards his Junior Sister Zhiqiao. Every time no one was around, he would seize the opportunity to take her around to play and look at all sorts of interesting scenery and creatures.</p><br/><p>When everyone else gathered, he would return to his usual cold demeanor, as though warning everyone to not bother him.</p><br/><p>\"Senior Brother, please wake up\u2026please\u2026!\" Zhiqiao couldn\u2019t stop crying as she shook Mie Qiongqi\u2019s shoulders furiously. But, Mie Qiongqi laid there, lifeless and still. Spreading in all direction, the blood flow was representative of his death\u2026</p><br/><p>\"GRAWR!!!\"</p><br/><p>Growling furiously, the Snow Lion cub broke free of Cai Zhiqiao\u2019s embrace too and dashed towards the distance.</p><br/><p>\"Whitey, don\u2019t run\u2026!\" Cai Zhiqiao gave chase to her cub.</p><br/><p>\"Zhiqiao, no\u2026!\" Frantic as well, Gong Bingye chased after the 2 of them.</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>\"What just happened? Why did Junior Brother Mie change his direction?\" Zhang Ergou was puzzled. However, when he looked into the distance, his face changed as well.</p><br/><p>That was Nameless Peak\u2026</p><br/><p>Translator's Thoughts</p><br/><p>Lam Lam</p><br/><p>FUCK. SERIOUSLY. FUCK. I seriously knew Mie Qiongqi was a good guy. Like I could sense it. Like, maybe good would not be the right word but at least he was loyal to Lin Fan regardless of how he came to be so. Seriously, I just cant deal with deaths and losses. Dammit.</p><br/><p>On a side note, our discord is finally up!

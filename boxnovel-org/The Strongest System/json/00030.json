Although Lin Fan felt slightly guilty about Yu Feng, he had already decided that he would definitely pay him back in the future.</p><br/><p>Since obtaining this system and learning \u300aMonkey Steals Peach\u300b, if he were to say which peach was most rewarding out of all the peaches he stole, it definitely would be Yu Feng\u2019s peach.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan wasn\u2019t happy for too long before his expression changed, as an unstoppable surge of momentum rushed over him like a wave.</p><br/><p>Yu Feng\u2019s face was utterly pale with no color, and bright red flames suddenly appeared within his palms. Lin Fan\u2019s face became extremely hot as he was currently standing right in front of Yu Feng</p><br/><p>\u2018F*ck!\u2019</p><br/><p>Lin Fan turned pale at the moment. Yu Feng was trying to kill his rhythm, and if the full strength of a seventh level postcelestial attacked him, even if he didn\u2019t die, he would be a cripple for life.</p><br/><p>\u201cGo die\u2026\u201d Yu Feng lost all reason upon having his peach stolen by Lin Fan. That pain which could surpass all defenses\u2026 At this point, all he wanted to do was to kill the current person in front of him.</p><br/><p>\u201cBurning Palm.\u201d</p><br/><p>Though Burning Palm was a lower rank martial skill of the dark category, it still possessed immense power. A life extinguishing palm landed on Lin Fan\u2019s chest.</p><br/><p>\u2018Bam!\u2019</p><br/><p>Lin Fan\u2019s chest became hot, a burning hot energy surging crazily into his body. Even with the protection of \u300aEternal Demon Body\u300b the clothes covering his chest were burnt black.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan\u2019s entire body was lifted into the air and sent flying outside the stage, landing on the ground motionless.</p><br/><p>The outer sect disciples off stage were all dumbfounded. The momentum from Yu Feng releasing the power of his seventh level postcelestial stage had caused them to freeze, and it wasn\u2019t until after the attack was dealt did they all come back to themselves.</p><br/><p>This is bad, junior brother Lin\u2019s life must be in danger.</p><br/><p>\u201cJunior brother Lin\u2026\u201d Yin Mo Chen came back to himself and hastily ran over to Lin Fan. Upon seeing his junior\u2019s chest burnt black and scarred flesh, he went into full panic.</p><br/><p>Yu Feng also came back to himself and seeing Lin Fan lying far away, he couldn\u2019t believe what he had done.</p><br/><p>Yu Feng wanted to go forth and check, but his crotch was in a lot of pain, so he was unable to move. In the end, he could only half kneel onto the ground, clench his teeth and endure the waves of pain.</p><br/><p>After entering postcelestial and attaining the steel body of a postcelestial, normal knives or swords were completely unable to harm him. Yet, how was a mere ninth level precelestial able to do this to him?</p><br/><p>Yu Feng couldn\u2019t understand it at all</p><br/><p>\u201cYu Feng, as a fellow sect member, how could you attack so brutally?\u201d At this time, the second level pericelestial senior brother who had been sitting on top came drifting down. His previous calm face had become slightly angry.</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior brother, I\u2026\u201d Yu Feng didn\u2019t know what to say. He had been unable to control himself. That kind of pain would be impossible to understand if one didn\u2019t personally experience it themselves.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph, enough! You will receive your punishment when we go back to inner sect\u2019s correctional hall.\u201d Li Chujun scolded. He didn\u2019t think something like this would happen. As fellow sect members, to attack a junior with such force was not forgivable. The previous strike would be hard to withstand even for a postcelestial junior.</p><br/><p>It seemed that this outer sect junior\u2019s life could not be saved. Li Chujun sighed, then without giving Yu Feng another look, he rushed quickly over to Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior brother, please save junior brother Lin.\u201d Yin Mo Chen begged. Although Yin Mo Chen hadn\u2019t known Lin Fan for long, he felt the bonds of friendship between him and Lin Fan were still very deep.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all my fault. If I didn\u2019t call junior brother Lin out with me to watch the competition, none of this would\u2019ve happened\u2026 it\u2019s all my fault.\u201d Yin Mo Chen said full of regret.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet me see.\u201d Li Chujun had a serious expression as he checked on the status of Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>The insides were scarred by the burning energy, pubic region and tendons destroyed, vitality diminishing\u2026 essentially there were no hopes of saving him.</p><br/><p>\u201cPhew\u2026\u201d Lin Fan coughed up a mouthful of blood, his previously colorful complex becoming mud-like.</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior brother\u2026\u201d Lin Fan had just received the system\u2019s level up notification.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026 congratulations \u300aEternal Demon Body\u300b experience + 300,000,000</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026 congratulations \u300aEternal Demon Body\u300b level + 1.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026 congratulations\u300aMonkey Steals Peach\u300bexperience + 100000.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026 congratulations\u300aMonkey Steals Peach\u300blevel + 1.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026 congratulations\u300aMonkey Steals Peach\u300blevel + 1.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026 congratulations on defeating seventh level postcelestial Yu Feng, character experience + 200000.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026 congratulations, character rank upgraded to postcelestial stage.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026 the system will begin updating for 24 hours, the host will enter false death mode and then fully revive, countdown one minute.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201859.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cJunior brother, don\u2019t speak. Senior brother Li will save you.\u201d Yin Mo Chen began panicking upon seeing junior brother Lin became weaker and weaker.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan gave a slight smile in his heart. Just a moment ago, he nearly scared himself to death. He had thought he nearly did just get himself killed there for a moment.</p><br/><p>But unexpectedly, upon going from precelestial to postcelestial, the system would fully resurrect him, but it needed 24 hours to update.</p><br/><p>But before the final countdown ended, Lin Fan wanted to get a little emotional. When he entered false death mode, they would all really think he did die and would then bury him. After that, he would be able to leave the sect and secretly kill monsters on the outside and slowly level up. After he became all powerful, he would then come back and give them a surprise; that was also quite a proper plan.</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior brother, no need. I know my own situation, I just want to ask one thing of you right now.\u201d Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>\u201cGo ahead, junior brother.\u201d Yin Mo Chen endured the sadness in his heart and listened to the last words of Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan lifted his hand with difficulty and removed the storage bag from his waist and brought out two swords from the inside.</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior brother Yin, this is the lower graded sword I promised to make for senior brother Ni. The other one, please give it the newly initiated junior that I owe. Also, there\u2019s no point in me keeping this storage bag so I will give it to you. In the future, if you miss me, you can just look at this storage bag.\u201d Lin Fan\u2019s breath became weaker and weaker as if he were about to die soon.</p><br/><p>\u201cJunior brother\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior brother, I am sorry for attacking you before in the past\u2026 Do you hate me?\u201d Lin Fan asked emotionally.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, junior brother, as long as you live, I will let you attack me all you want in the future\u2026 no complaints.\u201d Yin Mo Chen said truthfully.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen senior brother, can I attack you once more\u2026that feeling is very nostalgic\u2026\u201d Lin Fan looked lifelessly at Yin Mo Chen.</p><br/><p>In Lin Fan\u2019s heart, no matter how small the fly, it was still meat.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, junior brother, come at me\u2026 I am prepared.\u201d Yin Mo Chen nodded without any hesitation.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan watched as Yin Mo Chen gave a smile, then slowly closed his eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior brother, I will always remember you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026 countdown ended, entering false death mode\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, Lin Fan went still and stopped breathing.</p><br/><p>\u201cJunior brother\u2026\u201d Yin Mo Chen shouted in grief.</p><br/><p>Hehh.\u201d Li Chujun shook his head helplessly. He already did all he could, but in the end, he was unable to revive the dead. Unless the sect head used some sort of supreme secret technique, nothing could be done.</p><br/><p>Only now it was too late to say anything\u2026</p><br/><p>The person was already dead.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Young Mister Xiao Yao! How could he have been defeated so easily?\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Qingshan was dumbfounded right now. His eyes were opened as wide as those of a cow, glaring ahead with a look of absolute disbelief.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat is a powerful being who is ranked number fifteen on the True Immortal Substitute Roll! Just where in the world did this leader spout out from? How could he be this formidable?\u201d</p><br/><p>All the disciples were extremely terrified at this moment as well. They had initially thought that the moment Young Mister Xiao Yao were to strike out, this leader of the beasts would definitely be subdued.</p><br/><p>But, it was only now that they understood the circumstances. In the face of this leader of the beasts, what was the Young Mister Xiao Yao? There were no fanciful tricks nor intense battle to be watched. He had lost just like that.</p><br/><p>In the next moment, Lin Fan landed in front of Liu Qingshan. , as far as he was concerned, it was time to just kill them and be done with it.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, great leader! Please spare my life!\u201d At this moment, Liu Qingshan was extremely nervous as he prostrated on the ground and begged miserably. He hoped that this leader before him could spare his life.</p><br/><p>And right at the moment when Liu Qingshan lowered his head, his gaze shone with a sinister aura. Those hands of his which were hidden beneath his body moved ever so slightly as though they were channeling some killer move.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan did not reply or budge. All he did was stand there ever so silently.</p><br/><p>\u201cSpare my life!\u201d Liu Qingshan pleaded out before sneaking a glance at this leader.</p><br/><p>At this moment, the leader was standing there stupidly as though he was hypnotized by something.</p><br/><p>By now, Liu Qingshan\u2019s killer move had been channeled to its peak.</p><br/><p>\u201cGO TO HELL!\u201d Liu Qingshan bellowed out as the sharp Sword Will in his hands burst forth. Even though it was only the size of a thumb, it punched straight out at Lin Fan\u2019s chest.</p><br/><p>Clang!</p><br/><p>A metallic sound rang out.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow could this be?\u201d Liu Qingshan\u2019s face was just totally astounded. How could this backstabbing move of his not have any effect at all?</p><br/><p>With that, Lin Fan opened up his palm and slapped down. To Liu Qingshan, it felt as though he was being crushed by a gigantic and boundless mountain.</p><br/><p>BAM!</p><br/><p>There were no bones or flesh left as he just evaporated into dust.</p><br/><p>\u201cAHHHHH!\u201d</p><br/><p>All of the other disciples panicked out in fright. They wanted to run; however, their legs were wobbling so tremendously in fear that they could barely open up their feet.</p><br/><p>\u201cLeader, please spare us! We\u2019re willing to be your slave!\u201d The women cried out and posed in all sorts of slutty manners. When Lin Fan caught sight of this, he broke into a cold shiver and felt like puking out in disgust.</p><br/><p>This was the repercussion of f*cking for many years in a row.</p><br/><p>BOOM!</p><br/><p>Just at this moment, there was some commotion coming from up ahead, causing Lin Fan to turn his head over. Seemed like something was going on over there as well. Only, he did not know what was happening.</p><br/><p>Urgh!</p><br/><p>Without holding back, Lin Fan killed all of these people here.</p><br/><p>Pshew!</p><br/><p>In the next moment, Lin Fan dove right into the void and headed off into the distance.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Within the Endless Mainland were many people who were keeping a watch on the rankings of the True Immortal Substitute Roll. It had been a long time since there had been any changes to this True Immortal Substitute Roll.</p><br/><p>And just at this moment, a change indeed took place.</p><br/><p>\u201cGuys, check it out! Liu Qingshan has just disappeared from the roll!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Could Liu Qingshan have turned into a True Immortal?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s impossible! The other possibility must be that Liu Qingshan has died.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Outside the secret ground, when various elders of different sects felt the changes of the True Immortal Substitute Roll, their faces changed as well. This was especially the case for the elders who were of the same sect as Liu Qingshan. Their faces changed starkly in disbelief.</p><br/><p>How could this be possible?! To think that Liu Qingshan would have died in the secret ground! Just what in the world was going on? Could it be that disciples from other sects had struck at him?</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>At this moment, Lin Fan was hidden in the void. When he caught sight of everything before him, his face tensed up slightly.</p><br/><p>There was a man who looked like a war god and was wielding a long halberd in his hands. He was fighting with three Demonic Gods of the Ancient race right now.</p><br/><p>And of all people, amongst the Demonic Gods of the Ancient race was the Death Demonic God Shi Yan! That was the chick that loved abusing him!</p><br/><p>The other two Demonic Gods were unrecognizable for Lin Fan. They looked to be in a weird shape, and were extremely hideous.</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior brother, just what sort of monsters are these? How come I\u2019ve never ever seen them before?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat woman looks extremely seductive and devilish!\u201d</p><br/><p>The man who seemed like a war god was filled with an extremely strong battle intent. The long halberd in his hands cleaved out at the entire world with an exceptional strength. For him to be able to stand up against three Demonic Gods of the Ancient race in a fight evenly, his strength was honestly pretty remarkable.</p><br/><p>And just at this moment, a red mist appeared up in the void, with a series of laughing sounds arising.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuang Tianji! To think that these three beasts would be evenly matched against you! Seems like there are many existences we do not know of within this secret ground, eh?\u201d This voice was extremely high pitched, and gave off an inexplicably creepy feeling when heard.</p><br/><p>Amongst the disciples that were standing behind Huang Tianji, some of the female disciples let out frightened looks because of it.</p><br/><p>Huang Tianji\u2019s brows furrowed, \u201cYoung Mister Huan Xi, what do you mean by that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha! I mean absolutely nothing! It\u2019s just that beasts who are able to stand up against THE Huang Tianji, who is ranked number two on the True Immortal Substitute Roll? Now that is something that piques the interest of Your Young Mister here.\u201d When the red mist dissipated, a devilish looking man stood floating up in the void.</p><br/><p>That seductive gaze of his shone with an infinitely evil look. He then cast his gaze onto the body of the Death Demonic God.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph!\u201d Huang Tianji scoffed out coldly. However, he was truly bewildered in his heart.</p><br/><p>Just what sort of changes had this secret ground undergone?</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t that he hadn\u2019t entered this secret ground before in the past. And yet, he had never ever bumped into beasts with such formidable powers.</p><br/><p>The powers of these beasts were of Immemorial Ancient full cultivation state. Even if it were on the True Immortal Substitute Roll, they would be able to reach top 10 in ranking.</p><br/><p>\u201cLeave that woman to me.\u201d Young Mister Huan Xi pointed out at the Death Demonic God with a sinister voice, sizing her up and down, \u201cNot bad, not bad! Her body is pretty hot, with unmatched features on her face. The ones I met earlier on were all extremely hideous more than anything else.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did you just say? You\u2019ve met with more of them?\u201d Huang Tianji asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cNaturally\u2026 All of them were great tonics. Compared to the crystal shards of the Earth Abyssal Flame Beasts, they were much thicker and nourishing!\u201d Young Mister Huan Xi laughed out before sweeping his robes and flinging out a dried up corpse.</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan caught sight of the corpse, his face changed. This was especially so after he caught sight of the green, putrid mist that was shrouding that corpse.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan knew that the owner of that corpse must be the Plague Demonic God!</p><br/><p>But, to think that the other party would be able to kill him! This was a huge blow to Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Just what sort of backgrounds did these guys have? To think that their strength would be formidable to such an extent!</p><br/><p>At the same time, there was something that pissed Lin Fan off greatly: the fact that this fella had slain the Plague Demonic God.</p><br/><p>That was the experience points of Yours Truly!</p><br/><p>Beast! This guy was a degenerate!</p><br/><p>And just as Lin Fan was contemplating about these things, both parties began to fight again once more.</p><br/><p>Ever since the appearance of this red robed man, the situation has taken a huge change. The Death Demonic God did not seem to be a match for the red robed man, and was being repressed on all fronts. Even if she burst forth with all of her strength, it was of no use at all.</p><br/><p>As for the other two Demonic Gods, the situation did not seem optimistic for them either. The man who was wearing a battle armor clearly had an unrivaled fighting prowess.</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe! Submit and accept defeat, little b*tches!\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, the Death Demonic God let out a frightened look. Young Mister Huan Xi spread out his palm and slammed down from the void above, bent on capturing the Death Demonic God.</p><br/><p>The heart of the Death Demonic God skipped furiously. She hadn\u2019t expected there to be such a strong living being in this secret ground!</p><br/><p>And, just as she was unable to fight back any longer, a figure appeared in front of her all of a sudden.</p></div>\n</div>"}

Once the Heart Demon Emperor woke up, the Blood World would definitely be filled with a tragic howl for sure.</p><br/><p>And just as Lin Fan predicted, after the Heart Demon Emperor woke up and took a look at his pitiful state, he was entirely stumped. Not only was his body's essence blood sucked dry, he didn't even know what the hell happened! The more he thought about it, the more confused he was.</p><br/><p>And with that, the Heart Demon Emperor, who was in charge of all the heart demons, had a heart demon spawned within his own heart as well.</p><br/><p>Of course, that was Lin Fan's fault, down to the very last bit.</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>Looking at the 56 drops of essence blood from the Blood Demon Emperor, Lin Fan's lips curled into a grin.</p><br/><p>This was an exhilarating affair!</p><br/><p>The 9th level of Blood Sea, Rebirth through Blood, should definitely show its glory once more in the hands of Lin Fan!</p><br/><p>'Swallow\u2026!'</p><br/><p>These little droplets of essence blood contained a violent form of energy. All of these were the powers of the Blood Demon Emperor. At the same time, there were a ton of negative emotions that were mixed within.</p><br/><p>If any normal person were to consume these, they would be overwhelmed by the power, and implode from within. Even if they didn't implode, they would definitely be taken over by all the negative emotions and feelings.</p><br/><p>After all, the Blood World was an evil and sinister place.</p><br/><p>Even though the Blood Demon Emperor might have prostrated before Lin Fan, one would be a fool to take the Blood Demon Emperor as a wimp.</p><br/><p>After all, any character that could be an overlord within the Blood World would definitely be far from ordinary. In fact, just that mix of negative energy would be enough to drag one into the depths of the abyss.</p><br/><p>If not for the fact that he had the system, even Lin Fan wouldn't dare to devour all the essence blood at one go. In fact, there was even the essence blood of the Heart Demon Emperor to be taken into account.</p><br/><p>In that instant\u2026</p><br/><p>Lin Fan's blood aura rumbled massively, as a tuft of blood colored mist spread out from his body. A massive surge of blood energy burst out from Lin Fan's body, coiling around the world.</p><br/><p>Streams of warm energy gathered together until eventually, they formed a massive ocean of energy.</p><br/><p>'Time to give it one more shot. It must definitely work!'</p><br/><p>He could feel the door of entry towards the 9th level of Blood Sea being loosened! Once he could achieve the 9th level, he would definitely be truly immortal!</p><br/><p>With this amount of essence blood, if he still failed to succeed, then he might truly have to spend some time accumulating further.</p><br/><p>BOOM!</p><br/><p>In that instant, a blood colored dragon coiled itself around Lin Fan's body. The blood within his body had boiled to a maximum point, and was rumbling continuously.</p><br/><p>BOOM!</p><br/><p>The combined essence blood of the Heart Demon Emperor and the Blood Demon Emperor churned immensely, producing a massive amount of energy. This surge of energy slammed at the door repeatedly.</p><br/><p>The doors started opening\u2026</p><br/><p>'Yes\u2026!'</p><br/><p>Just then, the void around Lin Fan started to ripple. A black robed figure appeared, emanating a strong blood aura across the sky.</p><br/><p>This aura was familiar, as though Lin Fan had felt it before somewhere.</p><br/><p>But right now, Lin Fan did not have the time to bother about this other party. His body was at a limit where it was ready to breakthrough! He definitely could not waste this opportunity! Success depended on this moment!</p><br/><p>At the same time, Lin Fan was relieved. He was almost very nearly misled by Blood Sea.</p><br/><p>To think that the difference in leveling between 8 and 9 was so great!</p><br/><p>If not for the fact that he had summoned the Blood Demon Emperor as well, he might not be able to get to this state with just the essence blood of the Heart Demon Emperor alone!</p><br/><p>\"Take your time and breakthrough. I am not an enemy.\" The figure that was floating in the sky told Lin Fan calmly.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shut his eyes gently and focused all his attention on the activity on hand.</p><br/><p>BOOM!</p><br/><p>A gigantic explosion imploded out from within Lin Fan's body.</p><br/><p>'Complete\u2026'</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was overwhelmed with joy. It was as though the blood within his body had been given a thorough upgrade! With the infusion of the essence into his bloodstream at this moment, it increased the activity of his blood flow.</p><br/><p>'Ding\u2026congratulations on leveling Blood Sea.'</p><br/><p>'Ding\u2026congratulations on comprehending Blood Sea's Rebirth through Blood state.'</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>At that moment, Lin Fan could feel an unspeakable joy within his heart. He had finally succeeded! With this, there was a greater sense of guarantee about his body from here on forth! At the same time, the thing that gave him an even greater sense of excitement was the fact that level 9 was not the final state of Blood Sea! Seemed like there was an even greater state that awaited him!</p><br/><p>All of this served to demonstrate the unlimited potential of the system that he possessed\u2026!</p><br/><p>The figure in the void creased her brows. She could feel a terrifying source of power emanating from Lin Fan. This power was mysterious and strange. She wondered what sort of skill or art he was cultivating for him to produce such an incredible usage of it.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan did not continue to delve into his state right now. He stood up and looked straight at the figure in the sky.</p><br/><p>\"Who are you?\" Lin Fan asked.</p><br/><p>\"It's been a long time since we've last met. Could it be that you've forgotten about me?\" The black robed person pulled down her robe, finally revealing her true features.</p><br/><p>\"It's you\u2026!\" Looking at the person before her, Lin Fan's memory was jolted. Wasn't this the woman who had paid his entrance fee into the Dead Demon City?</p><br/><p>He could already tell that she was hiding her true abilities back then. To think that she was this strong?! Wasn't this person in Dongling Continent? How the hell did she arrive at Cangling Continent?!</p><br/><p>If not for the fact that there was only a single Supreme Being Token, he would have thought that she had a token as well!</p><br/><p>\"Well, allow me to reintroduce myself then. Blood Kill Sect's 12th Level Master, Ye Han.\"</p><br/><p>\"Oh, so you're from Blood Kill Sect. I do have some sort of a connection with you guys I suppose.\" Lin Fan chuckled. At the same time, he used his system to check it out carefully.</p><br/><p>However, the results of his check had him creasing his brows.</p><br/><p>\"You broke through the barrier of Dongling Continent?\" Lin Fan was getting warier by the second.</p><br/><p>Dongling Continent had a barrier where no one could go beyond the cultivation state of a greater celestial full cultivation. However, this Ye Han before him had already broken through that limit and was an utmost celestial as well.</p><br/><p>\"Haven't you broken through the Heavenly Barrier too?\" Ye Han gave off an alluring and charming smile. However, the blood aura that was emanated from her was chilling and cold. This was definitely a ruthless person right here. She wasn't someone to be underestimated.</p><br/><p>\"What do you want with me?\" Lin Fan gave her a casual glance. He did not want to get too close to this person.</p><br/><p>\"I seek a cooperation.\" Ye Han smiled gently, giving off a feeble impression. However, all of this was a fa\u00e7ade. If anyone would dare to look down on her\u2026chances were, they wouldn't even know how they died.</p><br/><p>\"Cooperation? I think not. I'm used to being alone.\" Lin Fan rejected her straight up.</p><br/><p>\"No, for the safety of Xuanhuang World, I THINK that you should cooperate with me. At the same time, I need a helper.\" Ye Han looked at Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>\"Wait\u2026your body. You have the stench of the Blood World\u2026\" Suddenly, Lin Fan's face changed. His sharp senses immediately picked up something off with this Ye Han.</p><br/><p>Ye Han giggled softly, \"You're different indeed. To think that you could even sense that.\"</p><br/><p>\"Oh, I finally get it. You did not break down the barrier of Dongling Continent. You've entered the Blood World and communicated with the source. Using the power of the Blood World, you broke through the original cultivation state of Dongling Continent. At the same time, the reason why you're able to come here is due to you traveling through the Blood World.\"</p><br/><p>At this point, Lin Fan finally understood. This was the reason why the Blood Demon Emperor would say that someone had managed to communicate through to the core of the Blood World. It was all the doing of this Ye Han.</p><br/><p>\"That's right. And I'm sincere about working together with you. Since you've already guessed most of it, I won't continue with that. The current Heaven's Will of Dongling Continent is no longer the original Heaven's Will. That is something that I'm sure you can already feel. However, the reason why I'm here is to discuss with you about something that concerns Dongling Continent.\" Ye Han continued.</p><br/><p>\"Go on, I'm listening.\" Lin Fan replied.</p><br/><p>Ye Han's brows creased. This guy had no sense of danger at all. But they could just forget that. Right now, this was the only person within the entire Dongling Continent who could have the power to do something.</p><br/><p>\"One year ago, the Heaven's Will had sought me out and struck a deal with me\u2026\" Ye Han began nagging in front of Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was filled with drowsiness. It wasn't because the story was boring. It was because, after listening to the entire story\u2026what the f*ck had it got to do with him?!</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>\"Stop, stop\u2026stop right there! Gosh, even after everything you've said, I've got no idea what the hell you're even trying to express. Can you just get to the main point?\" Lin Fan waved his hand.</p><br/><p>Ye Han looked at Lin Fan a little bitterly. This was the first time she had spoken so much to anybody in so many years of her life. To think that this person wouldn't even allow her to finish! She did feel a little dejected within her heart.</p><br/><p>She then continued, \"I think that there's going to be a really big conspiracy that will be happening in the near future.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan sighed. Here it was, yet another woman with a persecutory delusional disorder.</p><br/><p>To put it simply, 'There's always a peasant that's plotting against the Emperor.'</p><br/><p>...</p><br/>\n</div>"}

If you don\u2019t want to miss out, hurry up and follow along.\"</p><br/><p>\"What? Xiaoze is fighting a teacher again?\"</p><br/><p>\"Why is this D class teacher fighting Xiaoze? Isn\u2019t that practically suicidal?\"</p><br/><p>The Sky Heaven School was currently bustling at the moment. There were two types of matches when competing, one was determined by winning and the other by death.</p><br/><p>Whenever Xiaoze had a match with someone, it was always the one determined by death and not by winning.</p><br/><p>It seemed that the fate of this D class teacher was likely ominous. With Xiaoze\u2019s vengeful personality, this D class teacher\u2019s chance of survival was near zero.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan stood onstage, his expression calm as he exuded a teacher-like aura.</p><br/><p>\"Sign this.\" Xiaoze signed his name onto the life and death declaration, then threw it towards Lin Fan. Lin Fan received the life and death declaration, glanced it over and smiled. It seemed Xiaoze was going to fight him to the death.</p><br/><p>Xiaoze looked despisingly at Lin Fan, \"If you don\u2019t want to sign it, then scamper offstage. Remember, it\u2019s \"scamper\" off.\"</p><br/><p>Xiaoze didn\u2019t pay any heed to the D class teacher. For him, the D class teacher was a mere chicken, and today, he was going to kill this chicken as an example.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed, then signed his name on the declaration.</p><br/><p>\"The Sky Heaven School is the Yan Dynasty\u2019s top school. The strength of the teachers are quite good, but your minds aren\u2019t good enough. They need to be honed a lot more.\" Lin Fan had a disappointed expression. To Zang Tianhao and Han Mengmeng, senior Lin looked as if he was hurtful.</p><br/><p>Mind?</p><br/><p>When Zang Tianhao heard senior Lin\u2019s words, he felt as if he had gained some insight. Recalling how he had previously been unable to withstand the humiliation and not cared about his life, wanting to fight Xiaoze, it was a completely suicidal act.</p><br/><p>\"Enough nonsense.\" Xiaoze was taken aback, but then he drew out a pitch-black halberd from his storage bag. Xiaoze held the double-edged halberd with one hand and stood there imposingly like a God of war.</p><br/><p>The spectating students then began gasping, it seemed Xiaoze was going for real.</p><br/><p>The halberd was named Heaven Shaking Halberd and was one of the Xiao family\u2019s legendary weapons. Forged from black gold, it was a genuine upper graded weapon, only a bit away from reaching dark class legendary weapon.</p><br/><p>\"Brother Zang, senior Lin will be alright, won\u2019t he?\"Han Mengmeng was watching the scene onstage and began worrying. Xiaoze was a level six postcelestial, the skills he cultivated were the Xiao family\u2019s top martial skills, and the halberd was forged from the Xiao family\u2019s master blacksmith. It had the ability to increase the circulation of one\u2019s true energy.</p><br/><p>\"He will be alright.\" Zang Tianhao looked unwaveringly at the scene onstage. He didn\u2019t think Xiaoze would be this strong. A level six postcelestial expert, just the momentum alone was enough to make him uncomfortable. If he had really gone onstage, he would\u2019ve likely been killed in one move.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>\"Don\u2019t say that I didn\u2019t give you a chance. Make your move.\" Xiaoze flourished his halberd, with a momentous force, as it tore through the air with hissing sounds.</p><br/><p>Hah, too proud.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shook his head. Xiaoze\u2019s abilities were quite good, but to be able to reach level six postcelestial with this sort of a mentality, it most likely cost the Xiao family many resources.</p><br/><p>\"You are the junior, I should let you go first. Alright then, for three moves, I will stand here without moving.\" Lin Fan stood there calmly and said.</p><br/><p>\"What?\"</p><br/><p>The spectating students immediately became noisy. Was this D class teacher perhaps really stupid? To stand there without moving for three moves? He was seeking death.</p><br/><p>Zang Tianhao eyes flashed in surprise. He didn\u2019t think senior Lin would stand there for three moves, how was this possible?</p><br/><p>Xiaoze\u2019s halberd was an upper graded weapon, it could easily slice through steel like nothing. Even without the enhancement of true energy, one attack could slice open the body of a postcelestial.</p><br/><p>Xiaoze became livid. This garbage D class teacher was looking down on him.</p><br/><p>\"Alright, since you are seeking death yourself, don\u2019t blame me.\" At this moment, the halberd in Xiaoze\u2019s hand surged with momentum, and he struck forth with it like an arrow towards Lin Fan\u2019s chest.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was currently motionless as he smiled slightly, not paying any heed towards Xiaoze\u2019s momentous strike.</p><br/><p>\"Senior\u2026\" Han Mengmeng gasped and covered her eyes, afraid to watch any longer.</p><br/><p>At the moment the halberd touched Lin Fan, Xiaoze gave off a cry, and his energy circulated rapidly around the halberd\u2019s tip. The space around the tip looked as if it were warping, as it drew out multiple white air currents.</p><br/><p>\"Hmph, suicidal.\" Xiaoze laughed coldly, but his laugh didn\u2019t last long, and his expression instantly changed.</p><br/><p>\"How is this possible?\"</p><br/><p>Xiaoze was currently in disbelief, and even the spectating students offstage were the same.</p><br/><p>Zang Tianhao had been watching from the start without batting an eye, but upon seeing the current spectacle, he also became surprised.</p><br/><p>\"That halberd is not bad, just the ferocity isn\u2019t enough.\" Lin Fan smiled, and gently flicked the halberd\u2019s tip.</p><br/><p>\"Ding\u2026 congratulations \"Eternal Demon Body\" experience + 4000.\u2019</p><br/><p>Currently, leveling Eternal Demon Body was becoming harder and harder. A normal postcelestial in the end would provide far too little experience.</p><br/><p>Xiaoze was enraged, \"Bastard, I will make you regret this.\"</p><br/><p>Xiaoze roared out and his energy circulated crazily. The pitch-black halberd was covered in a bright light, and his style changed from stabbing to slashing.</p><br/><p>\"Sweeping Eight Barren.\"</p><br/><p>Xiaoze was hailed as a genius of the Xiao family, and one of the Sky Heaven School\u2019s strongest. He had never faced such a degrading situation before.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t even look up to A class teachers, and now this mere D class teacher had dared to act presumptuously in front of him?</p><br/><p>\"Bang\u2026\"</p><br/><p>The exuberant blow landed on Lin Fan\u2019s shoulder as a strong recoil made Xiaoze flinch.</p><br/><p>\"Ding\u2026 congratulations \"Eternal Demon Body\" experience + 4000. \u2018</p><br/><p>\"This isn\u2019t possible\u2026 I don\u2019t believe it!\" Xiaoze roared out angrily, his energy exploding all out. His halberd warped the air as the entire stage became filled with the halberd\u2019s figure.</p><br/><p>\"Ding\u2026 congratulations \"Eternal Demon Body\" experience + 4000.\u2019</p><br/><p>\"Ding\u2026 congratulations \"Eternal Demon Body\" experience + 4000.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The experience wasn\u2019t much, but no matter how small the fly, it was still meat. The future leveling path would likely be even slower than now.</p><br/><p>Xiaoze indeed had quite good abilities. To have such a cultivation base at such a young age, if nothing unexpected happened to him, it was very likely he would reach pericelestial stage.</p><br/><p>On the path of cultivation, blood energy was the key. The younger one was, the faster could their cultivation base rise, and more open their future paths would be.</p><br/><p>But for those with poor abilities, they could only reach postcelestial around their middle ages. If they didn\u2019t have any good fortune, it was unlikely they could go beyond that in their lifetime. It was because the blood energy inside their body would have already precipitated and become cemented.</p><br/><p>\"I don't believe it\u2026\" Xiaoze\u2019s long hair were unkempt, his eyes burning with rage. His previous aura from when he stepped on stage was long gone.</p><br/><p>\"Halberd.\" Xiaoze roared out angrily and leaped up, his halberd erupting with a violent momentum.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan then shook his head.</p><br/><p>\"That's enough.\" Lin Fan sighed lightly and slowly extended his finger.</p><br/><p>\"Deflowering finger.\"</p><br/><p>As the halberd came crashing down, Lin Fan\u2019s finger traced its blade, and with a gentle stroke, a surge of energy coursed through, causing the halberd to vibrate and hum noisily.</p><br/><p>Xiaoze became numb, and in an instant, his halberd ended up in Lin Fan\u2019s hands.</p><br/><p>\"This\u2026\" Xiaoze looked at his empty hands and was overwhelmed.</p><br/><p>\"Do you realize your wrongs?\"Lin Fan was calm. There was no need to act tough, and he had now entered the noble profession of teacher. If a student ended up going astray, it was up to him as a teacher to properly correct them.</p><br/><p>It didn\u2019t matter if other people believed this or not, but Lin Fan surely believed this.</p><br/><p>\"You bastard, I'm going to\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"Hah, it seems my teaching isn\u2019t enough.\" Lin Fan heard Xiaoze\u2019s previous words and knew his teaching still hadn\u2019t broken through. Lin Fan then looked up towards the sky and felt a heavy responsibility.</p><br/><p>\"Deflowering finger.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan then gently stroked Xiaoze\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>\"Clank\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Xiaoze felt as if all the bones in his body had become loose and he was unable to exert any strength at all.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan then took a small stool out of the storage bag senior brother Meng Yangquan had given him, then lifted Xiaoze up and laid him on it.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan always remembered this phrase, although a small stool was a simple craftwork, it was an essential home travel equipment. It allowed one to rest anywhere, and it allowed one to spectate a match anywhere.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

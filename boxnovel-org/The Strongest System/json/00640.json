However, the feeling of having more than enough Shengyang Pills to cultivate with was extremely wonderful as well.</p><br/><p>Before he knew it, he had been there for three whole years now. With that, the connate Paradise Imprint had also manifested 13,000 living beings.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Lin Fan's Paradise was bustling with life, akin to a small world of its own.</p><br/><p>At the same time, the surface area of the Paradise was expanding rapidly as well. Even those initially crystalized walls from before were broken away to make way for new and stronger ones to form.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Lin Fan almost had a sense of delusion about his strength. He felt as though he could rain down chaos onto the world with a single lift of his palms.</p><br/><p>PSHEW!</p><br/><p>Instantly, he tore out of the ground and floated gently in the skies. That intimidating aura, that calm expression of his, it seemed as though they had stabilized quite a bit after cultivating for three whole years. In fact, he seemed even more mature as a person right now.</p><br/><p>However, the moment Lin Fan opened his mouth, that entire image crumbled away immediately. While his powers might have increased, Lin Fan was still the same Lin Fan from before.</p><br/><p>\"Bloody balls! To think that I would have f*cking disappeared from the world after going into some se-f*cking-clusion! Three whole damned years! It's been so long since Yours Truly has trodden in the world! Who knows if everyone might have already forgotten about Yours Truly by now!\" Lin Fan thought in retrospect.</p><br/><p>However, the only feeling that Lin Fan was feeling right now was that his powers were around hundred times stronger than he ever was before. This feeling was way too scary.</p><br/><p>Divine celestial level 6, Law state beings? He could kill them with one punch.</p><br/><p>Divine celestial level 7, All to One state beings? He could kill them in two punches.</p><br/><p>Divine celestial level 8, Universal Elixir state beings? He could kill them with three punches.</p><br/><p>After cultivating for such a long time, the true powers of his body right now were giving him a surreal feeling of hallucination.</p><br/><p>\"Now that things have come to this, I've got to go and find all of my connate Five Elements. In this period of time, the Big Ancient Demon had also been cultivating on his own. With that, his cultivation state has also rocketed upwards. If I can gather the last two remaining Elements, I can definitely let him grow up. Who knows if he might even evolve to be an Utmost Treasure by then.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan did not think too much about this. He instantly delved into the void and headed into the distance.</p><br/><p>Those eight old fogeys were trained up by the Thunder Trainer King for an entirety of one whole year. Towards the perversion of the Thunder Trainer King, Lin Fan was helpless as well.</p><br/><p>However, in this period of time, the Shengyang Pills that were cultivated out by the Mythical Parasol Tree and the eight old fogeys were 100,000,000.</p><br/><p>Compared to Lin Fan in the past, this was still a great fortune.</p><br/><p>However, now that he had witnessed the three trillion Shengyang Pills, Lin Fan's view of the world had opened up. What could this 100,000,000 Shengyang Pills amount to? Man, they were not even 1% of that sh*t.</p><br/><p>The current Lin Fan was exploding with confidence. This feeling of being filled with power from head to toe was simply way too amazing.</p><br/><p>A single fist that rained out was akin to a dragon of infinite powers. Who could be a match for him at all?</p><br/><p>\"Eh? To think that there are some Ancient race beings up ahead!\" Lin Fan eyed his surroundings. Every sweep he took was around 1,000 miles away.</p><br/><p>In a desolate ground somewhere, Lin Fan caught sight of a bunch of Ancient race beings who were laughing out wantonly. A group of unfortunate beings of the thousands of races had been captured. Each of their faces were terrible, without a single bit of hope in them.</p><br/><p>\"Who can come and save us?\"</p><br/><p>\"To think that we would have been discovered by the Ancient race even after hiding so deeply! Someone must have sold us out!\"</p><br/><p>\"Damn these vicious Ancient race beings!\"</p><br/><p>To these beings of the thousands of races, the moment they were discovered by the Ancient race, the only thing that awaited them was death. There was no way out at all.</p><br/><p>BOOM!</p><br/><p>Suddenly, a gigantic explosion rang out. A colossal palm descended from the sky and slapped these living Ancient race beings to death instantly.</p><br/><p>'Ding\u2026Congratulations on killing Desolate celestial full cultivation Ancient race being.'</p><br/><p>'Ding\u2026Experience Points +1'</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>These Ancient race beings were way too weak. So weak that Lin Fan did not even feel like commenting about them at all.</p><br/><p>As for these beings of the thousands of races, those extremely horrifying Ancient race beings that were before them had just disappeared in the blink of an eye.</p><br/><p>\"Someone's here to save us!\" All of a sudden, this was the only thought that struck in their minds.</p><br/><p>The moment they raised their heads into the sky, they saw a figure clad in white robes floating there. This man had his hands behind his back, and had an outstanding aura. A single glance was enough to tell that he was someone powerful.</p><br/><p>\"Thank you for your lifesaving act, senior!\" The beings started prostrating on the ground, exclaiming.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan frowned, and was a little hurt in his heart.</p><br/><p>What? These comrades of the thousands of races had truly forgotten all about Yours Truly? Back then, Yours Truly was on the screen, wasn't he? All of these beings of the thousands of races must have caught sight of that as well! If that were the case, why had all of them forgotten all about him in just three years?</p><br/><p>This feeling was terrible!</p><br/><p>\"Hais, forget it. Who knows, maybe these beings of the thousands of races had not caught sight of that light screen back then.\" Lin Fan could only console himself this way. Without saying a second word, he left the place.</p><br/><p>But, a few moments after Lin Fan left, he couldn't bear it in anymore. How could he not let these living beings know about his great name?</p><br/><p>\"It's alright. You don't have to thank me. Yours Truly is the Motherf*cking Human King, Lin Fan, who takes it upon myself to watch over you guys.\"</p><br/><p>By then, Lin Fan's figure had already disappeared. The only thing that rang out was his voice. All of those beings of the thousands of races whom he had rescued were still prostrated on the ground.</p><br/><p>\"Many thanks to the Motherf*cking Human King!\"</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>By the time Lin Fna had left the place entirely, the beings of the thousands of races stood up and were excited beyond words.</p><br/><p>\"We're finally fine! Hurry up and leave! We mustn't be caught by the Ancient race beings yet again!\"</p><br/><p>\"Motherf*cking Human King, Lin Fan... That name is really familiar!\"</p><br/><p>\"Aiyah! What familiar and whatnot! We had better just get out of this place first.\"</p><br/><p>\"Oh, right. Right!\"</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>\"Seems like after hiding from the world for three whole years, everyone out there has already forgotten about me cleanly. I guess I've got to start from scratch once more.\" Lin Fan complained in exasperation.</p><br/><p>Not long later, he came across a mysterious place.</p><br/><p>According to Fairy Hongyun's markings, before reaching the place that possesses the connate Element of Metal, one had to tide through an area of turbulent void. The moment one came into contact with it, they would immediately be shredded into pieces.</p><br/><p>Even if it were a divine celestial cultivation state powerful being, they would have to make the appropriate preparations first.</p><br/><p>After all, they did not know how long this chaotic current in the void would last. If they didn't have the stamina to hold it through, they would fall straight into the face of danger.</p><br/><p>This was a dangerous trial. However, Fairy Hongyun knew that this chaotic current of the void couldn't be considered as anything tough given Lin Fan's strength.</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>At this moment, a group of people stood at the entrance of the chaotic currents of the void. They started discussing about this chaotic current here.</p><br/><p>\"Big Senior Brother, you're extremely powerful. Furthermore, your Seventh Metal Sword Will has already reached a point of unpredictability. You should most definitely be able to pave out a path for us in this chaotic current of the void here.\" A young man looked at the berserk chaotic currents in the void before him and remarked pretty exasperatedly.</p><br/><p>\"Junior Brother Ye, you're going to have me dead one day with all your praises. Beware of me spanking your little butty!\" Looking at his junior brother, the Big Senior Brother replied helplessly.</p><br/><p>This fella was just hailing praises about him all day and night.</p><br/><p>Just what sort of a place was this chaotic current void? Even if it were a powerful being of divine celestial level 5 or 6, they might not even dare to claim that they would be able to cleave out a path for everyone.</p><br/><p>\"Big Senior Brother, I'm just kiddinggggggg!!! Alright, didn't we bring some stuff with us when we came forth this time around? We should be able to tide through this alright.\" Junior Brother Ye replied cheekily.</p><br/><p>The surrounding masses chuckled out as well.</p><br/><p>If not for the fact that there was the Ancient race in this world, how carefree would life be?</p><br/><p>\"Senior Sister, I want to be in the same group as you later on! If I can't hold out later on, you've got to help me out, alright?\" Ye Tao came before his senior sister and started pleading.</p><br/><p>\"Gosh, you! Each time we ask you to train up, you'll just skive your days away. Do you finally know the importance of power at a moment like this?\" This senior sister was sweet looking with a petite figure. Her disposition was elegant and her cultivation state was decent as well, at divine celestial level 2, Realm state.</p><br/><p>\"Alright, I've got it. I've got it!\" Ye Tao shrugged his head. However, this wasn't what he was thinking in his head. Why would he have to bother with cultivating and training up with his senior brothers and sisters around? No matter what, even if the skies were to topple, they'd be able to save him with their strength.</p><br/><p>\"Eh? Big Senior Brother, Senior Sister, check it out. There's someone coming from the distance. He can't be from the Ancient race, right?\" Suddenly, Ye Tao caught sight of a streak of light that had appeared in the distance as he exclaimed out in astonishment.</p><br/><p>The moment everyone heard this, their faces flushed over in unison as well.</p><br/><p>If it were truly from the Ancient race, things would be disastrous.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

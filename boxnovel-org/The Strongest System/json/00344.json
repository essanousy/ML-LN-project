That\u2019s why you\u2019ve got to proceed with caution. You think you\u2019re really good at bullsh*tting? Now that you\u2019ve met with some real sh*t, you know how it feels, eh?\" Lin Fan slowly retracted his feet.</p><br/><p>True Origins Crushing Kick was the evolved form of Balls Kicking.</p><br/><p>Anything else, Balls Kicking was almost impossible for someone to bear, to begin with. Hence, one could just imagine the sort of destructive power that True Origins Crushing Kick wielded.</p><br/><p>\"ARGH\u2026!\" The suave and elegant Chen Xuan was kneeling on the ground. He no longer had the disposition of someone who possessed forty energy grid line chains. Instead, he was bending over, hands at his crotch and rolling all over.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026congratulations on defeating greater celestial full cultivation being Chen Xuan.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026experience points +300,000,000\u2019</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shook his head in disappointment. The difference in experience points for defeating and killing someone was just worlds apart. This meager amount of experience points could barely amount to anything!</p><br/><p>Han Mei\u2019s devilishly beautiful face was just dumbstruck right now. She had not expected that mighty looking Chen Xuan to fall just like this.</p><br/><p>Energy grid line chains! That was a powerful being who possessed those incredible chains!</p><br/><p>Though she hadn\u2019t counted them carefully, by the looks of the numerous amounts, there were at least 30+ chains right there!</p><br/><p>Even though the Han Family wasn\u2019t an enormously powerful family or anything, Han Mei knew what energy grid line chains were due to their close relationship with the Heaven Sea Sect.</p><br/><p>And for someone that powerful with more than 30 chains to fall just like that, no one could have any explanations for a scene like that.</p><br/><p>At the same time, just who was Chen Xuan? Why would someone that powerful want to enter Heaven Sea Sect?</p><br/><p>And also, who was this man?! How could he be this demonically strong?!</p><br/><p>Sha Dulong and the others got up with a mouthful of blood after being sent flying by Chen Xuan\u2019s massive eruption, feeling jittery all over.</p><br/><p>Strong! That was some inhumane strength!</p><br/><p>But when they saw Chen Xuan who was bending over with hands on his crotch, they were equally shocked beyond words.</p><br/><p>What the hell was going on right now?</p><br/><p>How did that mighty imposing Chen Xuan turn into this state in the blink of an eye?!</p><br/><p>\"Boss, what happened to that guy?!\" Sha Dulong asked.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled widely, revealing rows of sparkling white teeth, \"Alright, don\u2019t ask so much now. Today, your Boss shall show you what it means to get a lucky break in robbing! We\u2019re going after a rich man now! Gather up and watch carefully, boys!\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan walked beside Chen Xuan. With a single foot on him, he held Chen Xuan down while awaiting Sha Dulong and the others to gather around.</p><br/><p>\"So\u2026obedient! This guy was so cocky earlier on! How does he look like he\u2019s dying right now? Our Boss is the Boss indeed! Extraordinary!\" The pygmy Sha Miexiong said with a look of respect.</p><br/><p>\"Alright, alright! Do you need to lick the Boss\u2019s a*s anymore? We can all see his strength right here!\" Sha Daotian was still a little heartbroken over his broken axes.</p><br/><p>\"Alright, you guys, hold up his hands and feet. This guy isn\u2019t too good a target when he\u2019s rolling all about!\" With Lin Fan\u2019s order, a group of people gathered around Chen Xuan.</p><br/><p>\"Oh ho!\" Sha Miexiong chuckled out while gripping Chen Xuan\u2019s leg tightly.</p><br/><p>But just as someone was about to grab hold of Chen Xuan\u2019s hand, they met with a tremendous resistance.</p><br/><p>It was as though someone would pay for the price of taking Chen Xuan\u2019s arm off of his crotch right now.</p><br/><p>\"Boss, he\u2019s fighting back!\" Sha Daotian reported.</p><br/><p>\"Fight my a*s! Give him two tight slaps to get him to wisen him up!\" Lin Fan was sizing up Chen Xuan carefully. Gosh, he reeked of treasures.</p><br/><p>Great\u2026great!</p><br/><p>\"Oh.\" Sha Daotian nodded his head. Taking in a deep breath, he rewarded Chen Xuan with two tight slaps.</p><br/><p>\"Wow, well done. Do you know what that guy\u2019s cultivation state is?\" Looking at Sha Daotian slapping down, Lin Fan asked in a calm voice.</p><br/><p>\"Huh? What\u2019s his cultivation state?\" Sha Daotian looked at his boss in a confused manner.</p><br/><p>\"Heh. Let me tell you then. This fella here is a greater celestial full cultivation being with 40 energy grid line chains.\" Lin Fan chuckled.</p><br/><p>\"Ah\u2026!!!\" Sha Daotian was not the only person in shock. Every single one of the other bandits was equally flabbergasted.</p><br/><p>\"Ah, what ah? So what if he\u2019s that? He was still whooped over by Boss. Acting surprised for no reason. Right, Boss\u2026?\" Sha Dulong gulped down his saliva and acted as though he still had his composure.</p><br/><p>Everyone looked at Sha Dulong with a look of awe. Big brother was big brother indeed! Exceptionally calm!</p><br/><p>Even though they had not reached the state of a greater celestial, they had some understanding of them based on the legends.</p><br/><p>Sha Daotian especially was trembling right now. He had not expected to be able to whack a greater celestial being smack right in their face! Now, he could end this life without any regrets!</p><br/><p>\"Boss, what should we do now?\" Everyone asked.</p><br/><p>To them right now, the Boss\u2019s orders were everything.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan rubbed his chin and remained silent for a moment, \"Strip him first. These clothes are far from simple. They\u2019re definitely some form of great defense. It\u2019s like when you spin silk out of a cocoon, you mustn\u2019t let anything go at all!\"</p><br/><p>Everyone nodded in agreement to their Boss\u2019s wise words.</p><br/><p>Han Mei looked at the bandits who were surrounding Chen Xuan, and shot her guards a look. She wanted to make use of this commotion to make her escape, but she dared not to make any big movements in front of this powerful man.</p><br/><p>\"Oh, don\u2019t even think about leaving. You can leave when Yours Truly allows you to. Otherwise, don\u2019t blame me for anything that happens.\"</p><br/><p>Just as Han Mei was in the midst of contemplating, Lin Fan\u2019s voice rang over. She shivered through her entire body and nodded immediately, not daring to try anything funny anymore.</p><br/><p>For something such as stripping, Lin Fan naturally did not have to do it himself. Each of the fourteen sand bandits were pros in stripping others. In the blink of an eye, Chen Xuan was stark naked.</p><br/><p>\"Aiyo! Boss! What happened to this fella\u2019s little brother?!\"</p><br/><p>\"Holy fuck! That\u2019s right! Both of his balls seem to be deflated!\"</p><br/><p>\"Even that sausage seems to be swollen! It seems to be leaking out water right now!\"</p><br/><p>\"Eww, this is the first time I\u2019m seeing something like this. And he calls himself a martial arts master? How could he be so disgusting?\"</p><br/><p>\"I don\u2019t want these clothes anymore! Who knows if he\u2019s got some incurable disease!\"</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was a little exasperated. These guys were like clowns!</p><br/><p>But with this, he had a greater understanding of True Origins Crushing Kick as well. This was definitely way stronger than Balls Kicking!</p><br/><p>This was because Lin Fan could feel a mysterious energy coursing in that area around Chen Xuan, causing him to feel pain over and over again.</p><br/><p>\"You\u2026you guys\u2026!\" Chen Xuan had not fainted over. He knew exactly what was going on. However, the pain was so unbearable that he was almost breaking down, let alone say anything out.</p><br/><p>\"These clothes are worth a fortune! If I\u2019m not wrong about it, these clothes could allow one to block a complete blow of someone from a greater celestial full cultivation state!\" Lin Fan commented.</p><br/><p>\"Woah! That\u2019s strong!\"</p><br/><p>\"I couldn\u2019t tell at all! Seems like these clothes are totally tarnished by a guy like this!\"</p><br/><p>\"Whoever said they didn\u2019t want these clothes, give it to me! I don\u2019t mind!\"</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>Before long, everyone started rummaging through Chen Xuan\u2019s belongings once more.</p><br/><p>Looking at the items within his storage, Lin Fan could not help but sigh out. What a rich man indeed! There were quite a number of precious valuables within his storage!</p><br/><p>Only, Lin Fan did not know where this man hailed from. How could someone like that exist within Dongling Continent?</p><br/><p>Weird. It was totally illogical.</p><br/><p>If there were people like him all around, how could Glory Sect remain as one of the greatest sects against such terrifying powers? Seemed like there was a deep mystery that was awaiting him right here.</p><br/><p>\"Sha Daotian, didn\u2019t you say that your axes are broken? There are two pretty decent axes here. You can have them.\" Lin Fan said while ransacking Chen Xuan\u2019s storage rings.</p><br/><p>\"Thanks, Boss!!!\" The moment Sha Daotian caught sight of the axes, he beamed widely.</p><br/><p>\"Oh, what\u2019s this Destruction Sutra skill? You guys can go train if you\u2019ve got time. It looks pretty decent.\"</p><br/><p>\"Eh? There\u2019s a bottle of pills here that seems good as well. You guys can have it.\"</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>The fourteen sand bandits were trembling in their hands as they received the items from their Boss. This was the first time they had robbed someone so affluent in their entire lifetime of robbing!</p><br/><p>With just one look, everyone could tell how precious these items were!</p><br/><p>One could hardly turn into a wealthy person with just a single thought or notion.</p><br/><p>But someone as rich as Chen Xuan who met this demonic Lin Fan had turned into a pauper overnight.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

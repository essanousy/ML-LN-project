An energy grid line chain swam around his body. Entering the void from one side of his body, it reappeared on the other side. Coiling round and round, it went on and on.</p><br/><p>\"Ergou, what happened?\" Lin Fan asked in confusion at the scene before him.</p><br/><p>Zhang Ergou shook his head, equally stumped, \"Master, I\u2019ve got no idea too. All I did was feed the pill to Junior Brother! Immediately after that, a violent whirlpool erupted from within him, coiling him up. He has been floating up in midair ever since.\u2019</p><br/><p>Zhang Ergou was nearly scared to death as well, thinking that he might have harmed his Junior Brother. Even though Junior Brother Mie may have been cold to most people, Zhang Ergou could tell that that was just how he was on the outside. He was actually really warm on the inside. Just the way he sacrificed himself to rescue their little junior sister was enough for anyone to tell.</p><br/><p>This aura was really damn strong\u2026!</p><br/><p>Lin Fan frowned. The aura being emitted from Mie Qiongqi was really strong. It was as though a mysterious force was surging through his body.</p><br/><p>As for the energy grid line chain, it was slowly wrapping itself onto Mie Qiongqi\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>Bloody hell, he had just left for a short while. How did this happen in such a short period of time? To think that he was walloped to his last breath moments earlier, and yet now, he was crossing such a huge bottleneck!</p><br/><p>\"Evidently, Senior Brother Mie is undergoing a breakthrough! But how is he still unconscious right now?\" Tian Yu was frowning as well. This was the first time he was seeing such a situation.</p><br/><p>But Lin Fan knew that the skill Mie Qiongqi carried was an absurdly overpowered one.</p><br/><p>\u2018Unkillable Indestructible.\u2019</p><br/><p>Just the name itself was tell-tale of how bullsh*t this skill was. Lin Fan wanted to learn this skill for himself as well. Unfortunately, Mie Qiongqi was the only one who knew how to cultivate it, but he was unable to teach it.</p><br/><p>Towards this, Lin Fan was pretty frustrated as well. Seemed like this was a skill that might be dedicated to a single person. But oh well, Mie Qiongqi was a disciple of Saint Devil Sect after all. No matter what, he was Lin Fan\u2019s own.</p><br/><p>What Saint Devil Sect lacked right now was someone strong to hold the fort.</p><br/><p>And Mie Qiongqi was exactly the guy with the potential to do so.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, a massive aura erupted from Mie Qiongqi, causing everyone\u2019s heart to reverberate. The void around him turned chaotic beyond measure.</p><br/><p>\"Kill\u2026!\"</p><br/><p>Mie Qiongqi shouted out fiercely with a domineering force. That single \u2018kill\u2019 word seemed to possess a thousand emotions within it. The faces of Zhang Ergou and the other disciples changed immediately. Within their consciousness, dozens of images began to appear.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan coughed gently. Within Mie Qiongqi\u2019s \u2018kill\u2019 word was a strong mental aura. Those with a weak cultivation base would find themselves immersed in a series of hallucinations.</p><br/><p>In a daze, Zhang Ergou and the others finally sobered up with Lin Fan\u2019s thunder like cough rumbling within their consciousness.</p><br/><p>\"Master, is Junior Brother Mie alright?\" Zhang Ergou asked worriedly. Just what were those images in his consciousness just now? He was nearly lost within those hallucinations of the killing aura.</p><br/><p>\"He\u2019s alright, but you guys were nearly not. Alright, let him continue to shout on his own. All of you go and move out to let the Earth Demons repair our place.\" Lin Fan replied.</p><br/><p>\"Oh.\" Nodding their heads, everyone else carried on to get busy, ignoring the floating Mie Qiongqi.</p><br/><p>From afternoon till night, Mie Qiongqi continued with his \u2018Kill\u2026Kill\u2026Kill\u2026!\u2019</p><br/><p>Looking at his Junior Brother Mie in midair, Feng Bujue could not help but sigh, \"Say, Big Senior Brother, what do you think is wrong with Junior Brother Mie? Why does he keep going on about killing and killing and killing? Do you think he\u2019s dreaming about some enemy or foe right now?\"</p><br/><p>Zhang Ergou blinked his eyes, \"Who knows. But Junior Brother Mie is not young anymore. Perhaps this is just that puberty stage thing that Master was talking about?\"</p><br/><p>\"What\u2019s puberty?\" Feng Bujue asked in confusion. He had no idea what this new term his Master came up with meant.</p><br/><p>\"How would I know? According to Master, it means that his hormones are exploding.\"</p><br/><p>\"And what're hormones?\"</p><br/><p>\"Go and ask Master yourself. I\u2019ve got no idea, gosh! Master has asked for me to make a trip over to his place later. Just follow me along then.\" Zhang Ergou dismissed Feng Bujue away. Gosh, wasn\u2019t Junior Brother Feng just annoying? This guy just couldn\u2019t stop with his questions.</p><br/><p>Late at night, the Earth Demons were burning the midnight oil as well. Judging from the cling clang sounds coming from the bottom of the hill, these guys were trying to make good use of time as well.</p><br/><p>Now, the only headache for Lin Fan was this Gong Bingye. Just how did this woman pop up in here? Furthermore, by the looks of it, she seemed to be really chummy with Zhang Ergou and the others!</p><br/><p>Bloody hell, just what the hell happened to this place in the months when he was gone?</p><br/><p>\"Master, I\u2019m here.\" Zhang Ergou stopped outside his house and whispered gently.</p><br/><p>\"Yes, get the hell in.\" Lin Fan shouted.</p><br/><p>Even though Zhang Ergou did not know the exact reason why his Master had summoned him, his hunches were pretty accurate most of the time. It must be the matter about Miss Gong.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan did not bother beating around the bush and got straight to the heart of the matter, asking about Gong Bingye\u2019s situation around here. Zhang Ergou replied his questions accordingly, reporting to him about the happenings and changes of Nameless Peak for the past few months as well.</p><br/><p>By the time Zhang Ergou was done, Lin Fan was feeling pretty exasperated.</p><br/><p>Bloody hell! Through history, he had only heard of men kidnapping village women to be their wives. This was the first bloody time that a girl had come knocking on the door herself.</p><br/><p>\"Erm, Master, actually, Ergou here has something to say. Just that I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s appropriate\u2026\" Zhang Ergou stammered here and there. He seemed to have a lot on his mind, but did not know how to voice them out.</p><br/><p>\"Speak your mind then. Stop being a sissy.\" Goodness, just a few months in and this Zhang Ergou was acting like a little sissy. Did he change his sex?</p><br/><p>\"Well\u2026 Master, you see\u2026 the thing is, our sect is rapidly expanding right now. And you\u2019re not getting any younger, you know? Actually what we need right now is a Mistress of the sect. The best is if you could pop out a Young Master within this year as well. I\u2019ve evaluated her with all the other junior brothers. All of us agree that she\u2019s a peerless beauty with a perfect figure as well. In the words of my home\u2019s old folks: A woman with a huge bum can rear many kids\u2026\" Before Zhang Ergou could finish his words, he found himself the target of a killing aura locked onto him. In a moment of shock, he found himself booted with a heavy kick on the butt straight out of the door.</p><br/><p>\"Get lost! Seems like you\u2019re getting out of hand without me personally TRAINING you for a long period of time, eh?\" Kicking Zhang Ergou\u2019s butt, Lin Fan scolded him, albeit a little jokingly.</p><br/><p>Zhang Ergou cried out in pain and scurried out. Upon hearing the word \u2018training\u2019, he was scared stiff. Rubbing his butt in pain, he continued to run on.</p><br/><p>\"Alright, alright. You can let me know if you don\u2019t want to. You don\u2019t have to kick my a*s. But seriously, as your specially appointed Big Senior Brother of the sect, I\u2019ve really checked her out properly with my junior brothers! She\u2019s really pretty decent!\"</p><br/><p>\"You still wanna continue\u2026?\"</p><br/><p>\"No, no, no! I\u2019ll shut up\u2026!\" Breaking into a sprint, Zhang Ergou ran off with his bum swaying as he ran.</p><br/><p>Next day\u2026</p><br/><p>Mie Qiongqi\u2019s shouts continued through the entire night. It was until morning when another massive aura erupted from within his body. Two energy grid line chains clanged onto one another loudly in the skies.</p><br/><p>Zhang Ergou, who was still deep in his sleep, was shocked out of bed by this loud sound. Turning his eyes towards the sound, he was completely stupefied.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Mie Qiongqi was like the monk in Journey to the West, albeit a darker version. Bald, with the clothes of his upper body ripped off, his upper torso was imprinted with countless pitch black runes and markings. Those two energy grid line chains intertwined with one another and coiled around his body, energy flowing on them rapidly.</p><br/><p>Shining brightly, both of them then swam into Mie Qiongqi\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>\"Bloody hell, that\u2019s even flashier than me.\" Lin Fan squinted his eyes. He could not deny that this short transformation of Mie Qiongqi was pretty cool.</p><br/><p>Just then, Mie Qiongqi\u2019s eyes shot wide open. A bright light swept out across the lands with him as a center, causing the void to vibrate gently for a moment.</p><br/><p>Comprehending the power of energy grid lines, fusing them into energy grid line chains.</p><br/><p>He had completed the path to a greater celestial.</p><br/><p>\"He had just barely stepped into the path of a greater celestial being, and he already has two energy grid line chains? That\u2019s a little too fast, isn\u2019t it?!? Bloody hell, isn\u2019t Unkillable Indestructible way too overpowered and heavenly defying?\" Lin Fan\u2019s heart tugged a little in envy.</p><br/><p>How many people had to craft their own energy grid line chains after entering the greater celestial state and slowly comprehending the way of the energy grid lines?</p><br/><p>And this man could just craft two chains overnight just like that. Furthermore, by the looks of it, those two energy grid line chains seemed a little special.</p><br/><p>When Mie Qiongqi finally landed on the ground and regained consciousness, his face turned into a look of excitement the moment he caught sight of his Master. However, when he tried to call out to Lin Fan, all he could do was hoarsely make some sandy sounds.</p><br/><p>\"Ah\u2026ah\u2026!\" Mie Qiongqi pinched at his own throat, realizing that he had lost his voice.</p><br/><p>\"Alright, stop \u2018ah\u2019-ing. You\u2019ve been \u2018killing\u2019 for an entire night now. Even if your throat were made of steel, it\u2019d be killed off as well.\" Lin Fan waved his hand in acknowledgment.</p><br/><p>Mie Qiongqi had no recollection of anything that had happened. All he knew was that his power level had spiked up dozens of folds.</p><br/><p>\"\u2018Senior Brother! You\u2019re not wearing clothes! Shame, shame!\" Zhiqiao was wearing her animal styled pajamas as she rubbed her half sleepy eyes.</p><br/><p>Mie Qiongqi shrugged his head awkwardly before breaking out in a laugh.</p><br/><p>All smiles, Lin Fan nodded his head heartedly.</p><br/><p>\"Alright, I\u2019ll head over to the Grandmaster for a bit. You guys go and get busy on your own.\"</p><br/><p>He had just received a summon over by the Grandmaster. He garnered that something must be up. As for Gong Bingye, he would deal with her matters after her injuries had healed completely.</p><br/><p>Translator's Thoughts</p><br/><p>Lam Lam</p><br/><p>Whew, what a happy ending finally. Though I still don\u2019t really wanna see Gong Bingye go sigh. And also, doesn\u2019t it feel so warm to have Lin Fan back at the sect? It really kinda feels like home in a way doesn\u2019t it haha. And we have our lovely Cai Zhiqiao with her animal styled pyjamas aww!</p><br/><p>Oh by the way, happy ending for the novel, but not so happy for our author! Imma give a synopsis for his raw comments. So apparently, he had a clique of 7 friends in university. And they just found out that one of his dear friend\u2019s husband was having an affair?!? So the males of the clique were going to confront the husband or the mistress?!? WOW? DRAMA MUCH? I hope he gives me an ending to this \u2018side story\u2019 though HAHA. I\u2019ll keep you guys update if he updates on this!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

It will forever be limited to be twelve. However, all that will be for naught! Since our Boss wants to attain an Eternal God Seat right now, how dare they stop him? Even if we have to snatch at it, we'll grab one back for our Boss!\" The Demon Emperor yelled out.</p><br/><p>\"That's right! So what if it's the rule of the Heaven and Earth? It's not as though we'll be afraid of that!\" The boundless strength of the Ancient One turned into a rope that tugged out at the Eternal God Seat.</p><br/><p>\"Let's just fight them! A mere twelve? That's not even enough to fit between my teeth!\" Lin Fan bellowed out. Just like that, four powerful beings were going at it fighting to get that Eternal God Seat.</p><br/><p>BOOM!</p><br/><p>A series of lightning flashes appeared. Each thunderbolt seemed to contain an unbridled power of destruction.</p><br/><p>\"Brazen! We are all Eternal Utmost Beings, and you think a few thunderbolts are enough for you to act so audaciously?\" The Ancient One opened up his mouth and swallowed the few thunderbolts. It neither hurt nor scratched him; there was no feeling about it at all.</p><br/><p>Three utmost powerful beings and a half utmost powerful being... The might of their actions was not one to be underestimated. And just like that, they were on even grounds with the existence that was controlling the Eternal God Seats from the unknowns. For a moment or so, neither side relented as they just expended their energies awkwardly there.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan bellowed out as his aura rumbled with a gigantic palm strike that slammed out at the Heavens, \"GET OVER HERE!\"</p><br/><p>BOOM!</p><br/><p>Lin Fan grabbed that Eternal God Seat with a single hand, causing the entire world to tremble because of it.</p><br/><p>This was a robbery, a downright robbery!</p><br/><p>The existence within the unknowns was having an extremely huge headache.</p><br/><p>For the beings of the thousands of races, each time one of them was leveling up to Divine celestial level 10 state, he would release the Eternal God Seat. But in reality, this was just for them to see and recognize how the Eternal God Seat would always be up in the sky yet beyond their reach. They could only lust for it with their eyes.</p><br/><p>But, the current situation was something that was thoroughly unexpected. He hadn't expected that these uncouth creatures would actually be so uncivilized, and would just snatch it forcefully!</p><br/><p>\"YOU HAD BETTER RELEASE IT! OTHERWISE, ONE OF THESE DAYS, I'M GOING TO WHACK YOU UP SO BAD EVEN YOUR PARENTS WOULDN'T RECOGNIZE YOU!\" While both sides were just expending their strength endlessly, there was a limit to Lin Fan's patience. Pointing out at the Heavens, he burst out, scolding in rage.</p><br/><p>BOOM! BOOM!</p><br/><p>Hearing Lin Fan's insults, the existence within the unknowns could only send a few thunderbolts out as a form of protest against his words.</p><br/><p>\"Damn it! No matter what sh*t you are, not allowing Yours Truly to ascend means that you're not giving Yours Truly face! And, since you're not giving Yours Truly face, there's no need for Yours Truly to stand on courtesy with you! Spirit of Biggra, rush over and take a look at just what kind of nonsense is pitting themselves against Yours Truly!\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved out and released the Spirit of Biggra.</p><br/><p>Instantly, a thick mist rose out and covered the entire world. It passed through the Eternal God Seat directly and continued ascending.</p><br/><p>Creak.</p><br/><p>But just at this moment, something unbelievable happened. That Eternal God Seat that gave off a boundless might suddenly gave off a cracking sound as multiple cracks appeared!</p><br/><p>\"It can't be, right?!\" Lin Fan opened his mouth wide with astonishment.</p><br/><p>Pok!</p><br/><p>And just like that, the Eternal God Seat exploded out entirely right in Lin Fan's face. A series of sparkling essence glitters scattered down from the sky before dissipating entirely.</p><br/><p>\"HOLY F*CK!\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shouted out what he was thinking. After fighting for a good half a day, this was all he had?</p><br/><p>\"Holy f*ck! In order to refuse Yours Truly from obtaining the Eternal God Seat, you would destroy it? Fine, I'll give it to you being savage this time Around! But, this seed of grudge is sowed between us now!\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan did not say anything more. Since the Eternal God Seat was already broken, what else could he say?</p><br/><p>The moment the Eternal God Seat was broken, the world returned to normal. However, the leveling had to resume.</p><br/><p>'Ding\u2026Congratulations on leveling to Divine celestial level 10, Eternal God state.'</p><br/><p>'Cultivation State: Divine celestial level 10, Eternal God state. (Pseudo)'</p><br/><p>'Experience Points: (0/6,000,000)'</p><br/><p>This personalized information panel, on the other hand, had Lin Fan nearly spitting out a mouthful of old blood. To think that at the end of it, there would be a 'Pseudo' tag! This was way too scammy!</p><br/><p>However, Lin Fan could feel a world of difference between his strength.</p><br/><p>His own power had climbed up step after step, reaching a point where he could have never ever mounted to in the past.</p><br/><p>The boundless amount of power cruised through his entire body as though a single fist of his would be enough to crush an entire world.</p><br/><p>And just at this moment, a strange series of voices came forth from all directions.</p><br/><p>\"Motherf*cking Human King\u2026!\"</p><br/><p>Someone was talking about him!</p><br/><p>While the name came forth from the mouth of the other person, he could feel it with his heart. Was this an ability that he had gained after reaching Divine celestial level 10 state?</p><br/><p>Lin Fan raised his head and looked over into the distance. A strand of his consciousness bolted out and headed towards that direction.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Eventually, the five Utmost Beings of the Ancient race decided to not think about this matter anymore.</p><br/><p>\"This Motherf*cking Human King\u2026\" One of the Utmost Beings wanted to say something when his brows furrowed all of a sudden. To think that this strand of Lin Fan's consciousness would have arrived over here!</p><br/><p>Seemed like if one continuously prayed, their prayers would definitely be answered. The stronger one was, the more they would be able to sense these connections.</p><br/><p>\"Who's there? How dare you send your consciousness over here?\" The Utmost Being barked out fiercely.</p><br/><p>\"Oh! So, it's the last five of your remaining Utmost Beings that are missing me right now! Yours Truly had thought that something big had happened, so I decided to come take a look!\"</p><br/><p>As Lin Fan's consciousness descended, even if he were faced with these five Utmost Beings, he did not show any signs of nervousness at all.</p><br/><p>\"Utmost Being Desolate, to think that you would be here! Back when you came to visit Yours Truly, why didn't you say anything and run off just like that? Could you have been scampering here to look for reinforcements?\" Lin Fan looked at Desolate and could not help but chuckle out.</p><br/><p>\"Motherf*cking Human King, you've obtained the Eternal God Seat?\" One of the Utmost Beings asked with a cold voice.</p><br/><p>\"No, he hasn't. Even though that cultivation state is a Divine celestial level 10, he did not manage to obtain the Eternal God Seat.\"</p><br/><p>\"HAHAHA! Anyone without the Eternal God Seat is but an ant!\" Another Utmost Being laughed out wildly.</p><br/><p>\"Hmph! How dare you send your consciousness over here. Stay here then!\"</p><br/><p>The Utmost Being Desolate struck out immediately, wanting to crush Lin Fan into dust. But instantly, Lin Fan pointed out with his finger, causing the void to turn into a mirror that cracked out part by part, dissipating the powers of the Utmost Being Desolate immediately.</p><br/><p>\"Gosh, don't get all violent just on seeing me! Even though Yours Truly hasn't obtained an Eternal God Seat, my powers are not that much weaker than you guys.\"</p><br/><p>\"The next time we meet, you guys had better wipe your butts clean and prepare for Yours Truly to reap you guys in!\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan burst out laughing loudly as though everything was within his control.</p><br/><p>\"Oh? Has my Exclusive Property arrived?\"</p><br/><p>At this moment, a voice that was filled with an endless authority boomed out from the distance.</p><br/><p>The moment Lin Fan heard this, he kept back his smile. Why did this voice sound so familiar?</p><br/><p>\"To think that you would have reached this state after just a few years of not meeting. You're not the Exclusive Property of Your Empress here for nothing! Once Your Empress breaks out of this place, I'll definitely grace you with a good visit by then.\"</p><br/><p>\"HAHAHA!\"</p><br/><p>This demonic laughter had Lin Fan shivering with chills running down his spine. All the pores on his body seemed to be exploding wide open.</p><br/><p>This was the f*cking Fire Water Empress!</p><br/><p>Lin Fan would never forget that scene from all those years ago. That was a humiliation of a lifetime for him to get pushed on forcefully by a girl in reverse. Not only that, he had to turn into the Exclusive Property of the other party! How could Lin Fan tolerate something as such?</p><br/><p>\"Your Empress' Exclusive Property, just wait patiently. Wait for Your Empress to break out of this place.\"</p><br/><p>The voice of the Fire Water Empress rang out once more as though she had just met with something fun. However, her tone suddenly turned frosty, \"But, I hope that you've kept your body pure all this while. Otherwise, I'll have you know of the consequences.\"</p><br/><p>The moment Lin Fan heard this, his goosebumps stood up. Without saying anything more, he retracted his consciousness into his main body instantly.</p><br/><p>\"HAHAHAHA\u2026!\" The Fire Water Empress' laughter boomed out across the entire Ancient race base.</p><br/><p>The faces of the five Utmost Beings were extremely terrible right now. Seemed like it was only a matter of time before the Fire Water Empress broke out of her seal.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Me?</p><br/><p>Translator: Lam Editor: Hitesh</p><br/><p>Mie Qiongqi followed closely behind Lin Fan with his heart thumping furiously. The only things he felt were elements of fear and nervousness. What was master going to do to him? He harbored intentions of running away. But the presence of master\u2019s forceful aura melted away any courage he had.</p><br/><p>Mie Qiongqi had wanted to ask himself why he was this afraid of this man before him. But no matter how he racked his brains, he could not find an answer. On the other hand, Lin Fan was filled with excitement, as though he was anticipating something great to happen soon.</p><br/><p>Within the house\u2026</p><br/><p>Lin Fan and Mie Qiongqi gazed at one another. Those all-seeing eyes filled with motives made Mie Qiongqi ever more nervous.</p><br/><p>\"Mas\u2026master! Is there any issue?\" Mie Qiongqi asked carefully.</p><br/><p>Now that he was alone with master in an enclosed space, his mind was only flooded with memories back in the locked cell. He did not ever want to go through the same experience ever. That shameful, tragic and horrifying experience. Never again.</p><br/><p>\"Come on. Hit me.\" The moment Lin Fan opened his mouth, Mie Qiongqi was stunned.</p><br/><p>What. The. F*ck?</p><br/><p>\"Hit me with 10% of your strength.\" Looking at Mie Qiongqi\u2019s stupefied expression, Lin Fan repeated once more.</p><br/><p>Now that he had a disciple with a Lesser Celestial Upper-Level cultivation base, naturally he had to make full use of this fella. Otherwise, he\u2019d be a fool to let such a gem go to waste.</p><br/><p>At this point, \u2018Eternal Demon Body\u2019 was hard leveling up anymore.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was determined. He was not going to head down the peak until this boy leveled up his \u2018Eternal Demon Body.\u2019</p><br/><p>\"Mas\u2026master! No\u2026I\u2019m\u2026afraid\u2026!\" Mie Qiongqi quivered in fear. He did not dare to imagine how badly he would be hung to be whacked if he landed a punch on master.</p><br/><p>Looking at Mie Qiongqi\u2019s cowardice, Lin Fan got frustrated. Standing up, he looked around the room, as though in search of something.</p><br/><p>\"Master, what are you looking for?\"</p><br/><p>\"A whip, obviously. If you don\u2019t whack me, I\u2019ll hang to whack you.\" Lin Fan replied coldly.</p><br/><p>\"NO! I\u2019LL WHACK!\" Mie Qiongqi almost broke down at the words \u2018Hang to whack\u2019.</p><br/><p>\"Ok, hurry up. 10%.\" Lin Fan hurried him. With Mie Qiongqi\u2019s powers, 10% should be just right. If he ordered Mie Qiongqi to whack with full force, he himself might just die at Mie Qiongqi\u2019s hands.</p><br/><p>Mie Qiongqi was utterly confused at this point. He had seen all sorts of people. But this was the first time he saw someone who begged to be whacked.</p><br/><p>Against the master who had tortured and whipped him \u2026to land a blow back at him... Mie Qiongqi could only swallow his courage and do as ordered.</p><br/><p>\"C\u2019mere.\" Lin Fan was ready. Whether or not \u2018Eternal Demon Body\u2019 could level up was up to this boy here.</p><br/><p>\"Master, here I come.\" Mie Qiongqi raised his hands and pushed his palms onto Lin Fan\u2019s chest. Looking at Mie Qiongqi\u2019s oncoming palms, Lin Fan was extremely gleeful and excited. Come on, let the waves of experience points flood Yours Truly!</p><br/><p>The palm came across like a dragon sieving through the seas, ferocious and domineering. While the speed was somewhat slow, Lin Fan could feel the energy behind the palm strike.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding...Eternal Demon Body experience points +10.\u2019</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled, awaiting his tidal waves of experience points. But these savage 10 points awarded nearly crushed Lin Fan\u2019s heart. Mie Qiongqi shirked his body timidly and continued to gently slap palm after palm on Lin Fan\u2019s chest.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding...Eternal Demon Body experience points +10.\u2019</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>Initially ecstatic, Lin Fan was now squinting his eyes and glaring at Mie Qiongqi sternly. His intent to kill flooded the air.</p><br/><p>\"You. F*cking. Kidding. Me?\" Lin Fan\u2019s voice was firm yet gentle. But this soft voice was enough to roar like thunder in Mie Qiongqi\u2019s ears. In this gentle aura emitted by Lin Fan, Mie Qiongqi could sense something else. It was danger. It was a feeling of dissatisfaction.</p><br/><p>\"Mas\u2026master! I was wrong! Please forgive me! For real now, 10%!\" That very second, an explosive force exploded from within Mie Qiongqi. The initially ordinary strike of Mie Qiongqi now landed on Lin Fan\u2019s chest after slicing through thin air.</p><br/><p>\"I\u2026!\" Just as Lin Fan was about to speak, the heavy strike landed on him, and he was knocked back flying. A spit of blood flew through the air.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026Eternal Demon Body experience points +300,000.\u2019</p><br/><p>\"Master\u2026!\" Looking at Lin Fan flying through the air, Mie Qiongqi was absolutely horrified. He had caused his master to bleed! What sort of cruel punishment awaits him after this?!?</p><br/><p>\"F*ck\u2026.!\" Lin Fan took a spin in midair and landed back gracefully, a wide smile on his face.</p><br/><p>\"Good! Just like that, bring it on!\" Lin Fan could truly feel the experience points about to flood his world. \u2018Eternal Demon Body\u2019 was definitely going to level up thanks to this boy!</p><br/><p>Towards Lin Fan\u2019s behavior, Mie Qiongqi couldn\u2019t help but shudder.</p><br/><p>\u2018What\u2019s up with master? Why would he keep asking to be whacked? Furthermore\u2026why does he look like he\u2019s enjoying this thoroughly!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Unless\u2026unless\u2026!\u2019</p><br/><p>Mie Qiongqi did not dare to ponder any further. Everything seemed to be treading on danger grounds. But since master asked for the beating, in order to please his master, he had to accede to the request.</p><br/><p>\"Master, be careful.\" Mie Qiongqi struck again.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding...Eternal Demon Body experience points +300,000.\u2019</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>\"Hurry it up!\" Lin Fan steadied his body as he took in blow after blow.</p><br/><p>\"Yes.\" Mie Qiongqi raised his palms. After that, the only things which could be seen in the air were the shadows of Mie Qiongqi\u2019s swift motions. Lin Fan felt like he was in heaven. This feeling of pleasure came so quickly that he was hardly ready for it.</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>Nameless Peak. On the path up\u2026</p><br/><p>The skies had turned grey.</p><br/><p>\"Junior Sister, what were you talking about with Sister Yulan?\" Zhang Ergou asked.</p><br/><p>The only reason why Zhang Ergou and Feng Bujue could enter Jialan Peak was due to Lin Fan. If not for him, the two of them would have long been tossed off the peak.</p><br/><p>Riding on Zhang Ergou\u2019s shoulders, the bright eyes of Cai Zhiqiao gleamed in the evening skies, \"Nothing much! Sister Yulan said that Senior Brother is very handsome and she likes him a lot!\"</p><br/><p>The casual expression of Zhang Ergou took a change as he stopped on the spot. With a look of disbelief in his eyes which turned into happiness, he carried down his Junior Sister from his shoulders.</p><br/><p>\"Junior Sister! Is that true?!!?\" Zhang Ergou could not believe that he could feel such happiness.</p><br/><p>Zhang Ergou had long harbored some feelings towards Yulan. But he too knew that he did not have what it took. So, he was just satisfied in being able to see her every now and then.</p><br/><p>The tender hands of Cai Zhiqiao reached into the small pouch she was hanging on her waist and took out something. It was a bronze mirror, given as a gift by the sisters of Jialan Peak.</p><br/><p>\"Senior Brother, you can check it out yourself with this!\" Cai Zhiqiao stretched the mirror in front of Zhang Ergou. He did not understand, but still took hold of the mirror. Looking at it, he couldn\u2019t help but rub his chin.</p><br/><p>\"Indeed, I do look somewhat handsome I suppose.\" Zhang Ergou muttered to himself confidently. Standing at the side, Feng Bujue couldn\u2019t help but feel a sorry heartache in his heart.</p><br/><p>Cai Zhiqiao blinked her eyes and took back the bronze mirror before carefully placing it in her small little pouch. She then climbed back onto Zhang Ergou\u2019s shoulders.</p><br/><p>\"Junior Sister, do you think I\u2019m handsome?\" Zhang Ergou asked.</p><br/><p>\"I don\u2019t know!\" Cai Zhiqiao replied innocently.</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>Translator's Thoughts</p><br/><p>Lam Lam</p><br/><p>Hey guys! If you guys remembered how people referred to Zhang Ergou as Brother Gou. The same goes for Sister Yulan. It\u2019s a closer term used rather than a formal one. And I suppose that\u2019s what Cai Zhiqiao refers to them as, since she\u2019s still a young kid.</p><br/><p>Speaking of which, I would like to remind you guys again that. Goodness, this girl is cute. HAHAHA.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

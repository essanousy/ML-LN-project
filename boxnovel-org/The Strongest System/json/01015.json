Who was the one who bloody shouted for it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was speechless right now. This death was way too fast, wasn\u2019t it? It was so fast that one could barely react to it!</p><br/><p>It didn\u2019t even take a single second!</p><br/><p>Or perhaps, the Three Horned Golden Dragon did not even know how it died so quickly and in such a horrendous way as well.</p><br/><p>Split up all over, it wasn\u2019t even left with an intact corpse!</p><br/><p>At this moment, Lin Fan was not the only one who was stunned. Qiu Zhanyu and Jin Zhengu were equally stumped.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is way too cruel, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Qiu Zhanyu remarked with some lingering fears.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan had just reacted to it when the void started trembling out. One after another, figures bolted down and fought for everything in a frenzy, as though they had just caught sight of some treasure or something.</p><br/><p>\u201cHoly mother*cker\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>Everything else aside, Lin Fan had just thoroughly given in to the situation right now. This was the first time he had seen such a mad rush in vying for items.</p><br/><p>The blood of the Three Horned Golden Dragon was still floating up in the void. But, all of those people could not care less as they rushed in and grabbed everything they saw.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha! I\u2019ve obtained the dragon\u2019s head!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHand it over!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow dare you take away my dragon\u2019s head? I\u2019ll fight it out with you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve obtained a dragon\u2019s tendon! With it, I can craft out yet another treasure! Haha! Wait, holy f*ck! Who was the one who has bloody snatched away my dragon\u2019s tendon?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The entire scene was in a state of chaos. Initially, Lin Fan had wanted to strike out. But, looking at everything right now, there was no way he could strike at all. These people were way too inhumane!</p><br/><p>This was a complete sweep of the place! The Three Horned Golden Dragon was way too pitiable, wasn\u2019t it? It had just tided through the calamity successfully to transform into a Three Horned Golden Dragon, having a bright future ahead of it. But all of a sudden, there was nothing left.</p><br/><p>The next thing that awaited it was a death without a corpse. And even after dying, it could not rest in peace as these fellas here were grabbing out at every single part of its body to either craft weapons or cultivate pills with them. In fact, even that golden blood of it was being snatched by the people.</p><br/><p>Beasts! These guys were all beasts!</p><br/><p>BOOM!</p><br/><p>A fight broke out. Anyone who lost out in snatching the items fought, and anyone who couldn\u2019t win in a fight ran. For all of these powerful beings, all they wanted was to earn a quick buck and get off. There were no ties to be spoken of here.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha! I\u2019ve gotten the Inner Pill! This is the most valuable item! Heaven and Earth Sect, retreat!\u201d A young elder of the Heaven and Earth Sect roared out in laughter. In his palms was a round shaped Inner Pill.</p><br/><p>This Inner Pill was where the essence of the Three Horned Golden Dragon belonged.</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior Brother Liu has obtained the Inner Pill! We\u2019ve also gotten some stuff for ourselves! Retreat! Don\u2019t fight for any more stuff!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTo think that our Heaven and Earth Sect would be the one to earn the most in the end! We\u2019ve really earned it big!\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone from the Heaven and Earth Sect retreated immediately. The plunder this time around was way too pleasurable!</p><br/><p>As long as they were to bring home the Inner Pill of the Three Horned Golden Dragon, that would be considered as a huge merit under their name!</p><br/><p>Liu Feng, who had obtained the Inner Pill, roared out in endless laughter. However, the void froze up all of a sudden as a Sword Will was flung out.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Inner Pill does not belong to the Heaven and Earth Sect!\u201d</p><br/><p>Urgh!</p><br/><p>An invisible Sword Qi sliced out and tore through the void. There was no room for anyone to react at all. By the time Liu Feng had even realized what happened, that arm of his which was holding onto the pill was sent flying in the air as another gigantic arm from the void grabbed it.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha! Not bad, not bad!\u201d At this moment, a man stood there laughing out loudly. Waving the pill in his hands right now, he let out a gleeful look.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn it!\u201d When Liu Feng caught sight of who it was, his face changed as his heart burned with a fiery rage.</p><br/><p>The place where his arm was severed from was bleeding nonstop right now. He consumed a single pill which caused the powers within his body to rumble out. With that, his broken arm was regrown. However, it consumed a large amount of power.</p><br/><p>\u201cBroken Heaven Sect, Qing Liantian.\u201d Liu Feng gritted his teeth and snarled at the person up ahead.</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior Brother Liu, are you alright?\u201d Some of the disciples who had retreated looked over at the disciples of the Broken Heaven Sect up ahead warily. They hadn\u2019t expected that the Broken Heaven Sect would strike out to snatch over the Inner Pill forcefully.</p><br/><p>\u201cLiu Feng, you don\u2019t have to glare at me like that. All of these things are dependant on one\u2019s abilities. Both of us are Golden Immortal state lower level beings. I\u2019m not bullying anyone by doing this.\u201d Qing Liantian laughed out.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis Inner Pill, I\u2019m keeping it then!\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Feng stared at Qing Liantian before him with a burning wrath in his heart. However, there was nothing he could do.</p><br/><p>Everyone else surrounding them had obtained what they wanted and had retreated off. Some of them had just bolted off from the start. After all, this place was overly dangerous, and it was better for them to not linger here.</p><br/><p>Heaven and Earth Sect and Broken Heaven Sect were both amongst the nine major sects. Some of the people around knew that these guys were not to be trifled with, and did not wish to get involved with this mess.</p><br/><p>\u201cLiu Feng, honestly, what\u2019s with that expression you\u2019re looking at me with? Are you indignant? However, I CAN give you a chance though. Let us fight it out. If you win, you can have this Inner Pill. But, if you were to lose\u2026\u201d After his sneak attack had succeeded, Qing Liantian was naturally excited beyond anything else right now.</p><br/><p>All of a sudden\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you really think that the Heaven and Earth Sect members are pushovers?\u201d</p><br/><p>Pshew!</p><br/><p>A single straight line streaked through the Heaven and Earth as an aura erupted forth.</p><br/><p>Qing Liantian was startled. He clearly hadn\u2019t caught sight of the other party\u2019s figure. Yet, that edged aura was already pressing close to him.</p><br/><p>Liu Feng was alarmed, not knowing what was going on as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy sword\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, one of the Heaven and Earth Sect elders exclaimed out. The Lower Grade Utmost Treasure in his hands had suddenly darted out towards Qing Liantian.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d Liu Feng was taken aback.</p><br/><p>At this moment, a figure bolted out in a flash and appeared right beside Qing Liantian.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026!\u201d Qing Liantian was startled. All of a sudden, he found himself being caged up by an extremely sharp Sword Will.</p><br/><p>It was as though he was living in an endless Sword Will right now. The pressure exerted onto Qing Liantian by this Sword Will was immense, something he had never experienced before.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan\u2019s lips curled into a cold grin. In the next instant, his figure had disappeared as though he had never once appeared before.</p><br/><p>Golden Immortal state lower level?</p><br/><p>While other people might not be able to skip through levels, it was extremely simple for Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Everything had happened so quickly that even everyone present could not make out clearly what was going on.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan had already appeared before the masses of the Heaven and Earth Sect while tossing the Inner Pill that was now in his hands over to the dumbstruck Liu Feng. He returned the sword as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd you are?\u201d Liu Feng was astonished. He did not know what was happening right now.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan took out his token, causing Liu Feng to be stunned, \u201cYou are Remnant Lin Fan!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cB*stard! How dare you snatch my Inner Pill!\u201d At this moment, Qing Liantian had still not figured out what was going on as he roared out toward Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>\u201cHAHA! Qing Liantian, this Inner Pill is no longer yours! It was snatched back by my Junior Brother Lin!\u201d Liu Feng said.</p><br/><p>\u201cCourting death\u2026!\u201d Qing Liantian was enraged now as he took a step forth. But, this single step forth had him absolutely horrified.</p><br/><p>In fact, he wasn\u2019t the only astounded one. Even Liu Feng and the others were just completely flabbergasted right now as though they had just seen a ghost.</p><br/><p>Thud!</p><br/><p>Both his legs fell off.</p><br/><p>At the same time, both of his arms were severed.</p><br/><p>He had turned into a Human Rod completely.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince you had dared to sever an arm of someone from my sect, I shall sever four of your limbs. This is quite the reasonable deal.\u201d Lin Fan chuckled out.</p><br/><p>However, he was secretly hating it in his heart. If only he could kill this guy, how nice would that be?</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019M GOING TO KILL YOU!\u201d Qing Liantian bellowed out as he churned his powers, regrowing all four of his limbs.</p><br/><p>\u201cHAHA! Qing Liantian, that\u2019s just retribution. You should be thankful that my Junior Brother Lin did not kill you.\u201d Liu Feng roared out in laughter.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan, who was still in the midst of regretting, suddenly froze up when he heard those words.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did you just say?\u201d Lin Fan asked.</p><br/><p>Liu Feng was stunned, \u201cWhat? Retribution?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, not that. The line after.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThankful that you did not kill him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes! That line! What would happen if I were to kill him?\u201d Lin Fan asked.</p><br/><p>Liu Feng blinked his eyes, \u201cErm, nothing? If you kill him, then so be it. The only thing would be to watch out for the other side taking revenge in the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI will not bring any trouble for the sect?\u201d Lin Fan had suddenly realized that there was a huge problem to this.</p><br/><p>\u201cNopes! After all, they can only blame themselves for their lack of skills. They can\u2019t force the grudge on any\u2026one?\u201d Before Liu Feng was even done with his words, he had suddenly realized that Lin Fan\u2019s figure was gone.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy sword!\u201d The elder who had lost his weapon earlier on exclaimed out once more. But, by the time everyone had come to their senses once more, they saw something horrifying happening up ahead.</p><br/><p>Thud!</p><br/><p>Thud!</p><br/><p>Lin Fan took the longsword and stabbed it straight into Qing Liantian\u2019s body violently.</p><br/><p>Qing Liantian, who was in the middle of his mad rage, stared up ahead at the person who was stabbing him with a blank expression as he spoke up in disbelief.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026really dared\u2026 stab me\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Feng was confounded as well. Did Junior Brother Lin really just stab Qing Liantian to death?</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was completely in ecstasy right now. Initially, he did not want to cause any trouble for the sect. But, after hearing the words of Liu Feng, what was there to be afraid of?</p><br/><p>The one thing he was least afraid of in this lifetime was revenge.</p><br/><p>No matter how many people were to come at him, he would chop them all down. The best would be for them to come together, so that he could chop all of them to death.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026 Congratulations on killing Golden Immortal lower level powerful being.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026 Experience Points +\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was truly elated right now. This feeling was way too awesome!</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Lin Fan cast his sight over at those disciples from the Broken Heaven Sect.</p><br/><p>When the disciples realized that Lin Fan was looking at them, they were all so scared that their limbs were breaking out into shivers. They had not expected that Senior Brother Qing Liantian would be stabbed to death by the other party!</p><br/><p>Lin Fan frowned. All of them were trash, and did not have much experience points to give. Even if he were to chop them up, it would be a waste of time. He might as well save the effort.</p><br/><p>\u201cLeave all of your things behind and scram!\u201d</p><br/><p>The disciples of the Broken Heaven Sect left their belongings behind immediately and ran off with frightfully pale faces like the wind.</p></div>\n</div>"}

Wearing a black cloak, Elder Li seemed as if he could disregard the darkness, as he searched for a book from the top of the bookshelf. This book recorded the experience of the sect founder's entire life.</p><br/><p>In the darkness, only those pair of green flames hidden within the black cloak moved. The surroundings were completely silent, except for the sound of Elder Li flipping open books.</p><br/><p>\"Why can that disciple cultivate \"Titanium Grade Demon Body\" to such a high level? This has never happened before .\" Elder Li said to himself. The \"Titanium Grade Demon Body\" recorded in the book was merely a body training method causally written by the sect\u2019s founder, specially made for the punching bags to train. And yet, a person actually managed to train it to that level.</p><br/><p>The next day\u2026</p><br/><p>Lin Fan sat up, and the first thing he did was pull down his pants and check. Seeing his brother entirely lively, safe, and sound, he was relieved. From now no, Lin Fan promised that he would never do such a thing again. This sh*t was practically life-threatening.</p><br/><p>At that time, a knock came from the door. Lin Fan was a bit suspicious, \u2018Just who would come see me? Did Han Lu come over?\u2019</p><br/><p>But that wouldn\u2019t do. With the severe thing he did yesterday, if Senior brother Han Lu didn\u2019t just directly kick down his door, it would be rather sorrowful. Lin Fan didn\u2019t think much and got ready before opening the door.</p><br/><p>\"Hm, you are?\" Lin looked at the unfamiliarperson in front of him, a bit doubtful.</p><br/><p>\"I live next door. You\u2019re the newly initiated outer sect Junior brother Lin, right?\" The person had a smile, looking at Lin Fan like an older brother looking at a younger brother.</p><br/><p>\"Oh, so you are a Senior brother! Come come\u2026 Senior brother, please enter.\" Lin Fan heard this and was suddenly ecstatic\u2026 Experience delivering itself\u2026</p><br/><p>\"Hehe, Junior brother Lin is quite polite. Senior brother Ni told me yesterday to take good care of Junior brother Lin. Right now is the outer sect\u2019s dining time. Since Junior brother Lin is newly initiated, you probably don\u2019t know where it\u2019s at, so I will lead you.\" Yin Mo Chen looked at Ling Fan and felt this newly initiated junior brother was a pretty good person. He was very warm towards other people. In the future, if there is a chance he should visit him more.</p><br/><p>\"Alright, then I will rely on Senior brother.\" Lin Fan said joyfully. The entire way, Lin Fan was rather buoyant, and Yin Mo Chen answered all his questions.</p><br/><p>\"Senior-brother Yin, this dining hall is a bit big.\" Lin Fan looked around and saw a sea of people, each head having a cultivation level floating above their heads. To Lin Fan, they were all just experience.</p><br/><p>\"Junior-brother Lin, all the outer sect\u2019s disciples dine here. So naturally, this dining hall is huge.\" Yin Mo Chen replied.</p><br/><p>\"Oh\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Under Yin Mo Chen\u2019s lead, Lin Fan received some food from the dining hall\u2019s catering area. \u2018There is meat and vegetables, so it\u2019s pretty bountiful. Just what kind of vegetable is this, and what kind of meat is this? I have never seen these before, and the food also smells very delicious\u2026 It arouses my appetite greatly.\u2019</p><br/><p>Lin Fan\u2019s stomach was empty, and after entering precelestial stage, Lin Fan\u2019s appetite also increased greatly. So without any words, he quickly finished off all the food. As expected, this was not regular food. After Lin Fan had finished eating the food, his experience increased a little bit.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked up, and saw Yin Mo Chen staring dumbfoundedly, \"Senior brother, why are you staring at me like that?\" Whenever Lin Fan saw eyes full of such expression, he would feel his entire body shudder, as if there was someone thinking about his innocent body. Yin Mo Chen smiled, \"It\u2019s nothing. Just Junior brother Lin\u2019s ravaging eating method was an eye-opener for me.\"</p><br/><p>\"Senior-brother Yin, can each person only receive one serving of this food?\" Lin Fan asked.</p><br/><p>\"Yes, these are all prepared in advance.\" Yin Mo Chen said while smiling. Lin Fan heard this, and suddenly was ecstatic.</p><br/><p>Since to Lin Fan, everyone was merely experience, it just wouldn\u2019t do if he didn\u2019t initiate mocking mode. After receiving this confirmation from senior-brother Yin, Lin Fan decisively started mocking.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked with a calm expression, then took Senior brother Yin\u2019s food and placed it in front of himself, and then looked towards Senior brother Yin, awaiting his anger</p><br/><p>.</p><br/><p>\"Senior-brother Yin, I am still not full, so you just watch me eat.\" Lin Fan said. At this moment Lin Fan\u2019s inner heart was fully anticipating, \u2018Senior brother Yin, hurry up and attack me\u2026 hurry up, flip the table, and beat me up. Though your personality is quite nice, who can blame me since your Junior brother relies on this to level up?\u2019</p><br/><p>What Lin Fan didn\u2019t expect was that after Senior brother Yin appeared startled for a bit, he then smiled. \"Right, this is your Senior brother\u2019s fault. Since Junior brother is still not full, Senior brother doesn\u2019t mind giving his food to Junior brother.\" Yin Mo Chen said.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan heard this and exploded, \u2018This\u2026this\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Suddenly Lin Fan realized, \u2018Mocking nowadays is so hard\u2026 What\u2019s up with people nowadays? Why are their hearts so generous?\u2019</p><br/><p>\"Senior brother Yin\u2026 aren\u2019t you hungry?\" Lin Fan asked.</p><br/><p>\"I am hungry.\" Yin Mo Chen nodded.</p><br/><p>\"Then, since I took your food, aren\u2019t you angry?\" Lin Fan felt a sudden urge to cry, \u2018Can\u2019t you just cooperate and beat me up?\u2019</p><br/><p>Ni Mo Chen smiled while shaking his head, \"As a Senior brother, it is necessary to take care of Junior brother. Since Junior brother is hungry, your Senior brother will, of course, let Junior brother eat his fill.\"</p><br/><p>\u2018I concede\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>If there weren\u2019t any people in the surroundings right now, Lin Fan definitely would have cried a lot. \u2018Why are all the people in the outer sect like this, so saintly\u2026? Where am I supposed to go for mocking from now on?\u2019</p><br/><p>\"Senior brother, I suddenly don\u2019t feel hungry anymore. Here\u2019s your food back.\" Lin Fan pushed the food in front of him back.</p><br/><p>\"Junior brother, if you really are hungry, your Senior brother is completely fine.\" Yin Mo Chen said.</p><br/><p>\"No need.\" Lin Fan said while shaking his head.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>At this moment, the sound of a table being slammed came from ahead.</p><br/><p>\"Give me your food.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked towards the sound and saw a mountain-sized guy standing there, stealing another person's food. \"Senior brother, that is mine.\" From the crowd, a bell-like voice traveled over. Judging from the voice it must be a girl.\"</p><br/><p>\"Now it\u2019s mine. Do you have any problem with that?\"</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Lin Fan stood up at this moment, his heart filled with joy. Finally meeting this type of person\u2026 Lin Fan wouldn\u2019t believe that among more than eight thousand disciples, there wouldn\u2019t be a single arrogant one.</p><br/><p>\"Junior-brother Lin, don\u2019t cause trouble\u2026 He is senior-brother Yi\u2019s person.\" Yin Mo Chen said a bit fearfully. Lin Fan heard this and was even more joyful, \u2018So, he even has someone backing him! Not bad, not bad.\u2019</p><br/><p>Senior brother Yin, who is this Senior brother Yi?\" Lin Fan asked.</p><br/><p>\"He is one of the outer sect\u2019s top ten geniuses like Senior brother Meng. His standing in the outer sect is very high. This person is one of Yi Zhongtian\u2019s people. Though this type of thing doesn\u2019t usually happen in the outer sect, it\u2019s not nonexistent. Junior brother, listen to Senior brother\u2019s words and don\u2019t mind other people\u2019s business.\" Yin Mo Chen warned.</p><br/><p>\"Oh.\"\"Lin Fan nodded his head. Yin Mo Chen felt relieved, he was afraid that Junior brother Lin would be utterly fearless and unable to ignore injustice. Although the sect strictly prohibited in-fighting, but where there were people, there would be clashes. It was impossible to fully prohibit it.</p><br/><p>But when Yin Mo Chen raised his head, he realized that Junior brother Lin was already walking over there. Startled, he hurriedly shoveled a few mouthfuls of food and immediately followed him.</p><br/><p>\u2018Just what is Junior brother Lin trying to do? Absolutely don\u2019t get involved in this.\u2019</p><br/>\n</div>"}

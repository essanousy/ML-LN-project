However, even if he was an ant, so what? Even if he wasn\u2019t a match for this guy, he still had to give it his all!</p><br/><p>His will surged as his fighting strength was unparalleled right now. At this moment, Lin Fan\u2019s eyes turned serious while that absolutely dauntless spirit of his radiated throughout the world.</p><br/><p>BOOM!</p><br/><p>A punch that contained his fullest strength was sent forth.</p><br/><p>BAM!</p><br/><p>The devastating power tore through everything and slammed over, causing that punch of Lin Fan to disintegrate and disperse just like dust.</p><br/><p>Creak!</p><br/><p>Lin Fan\u2019s heart skipped a beat. He could feel that boundless strength ripping in through his right arm as though it wanted to infiltrate his body and lay ruins to it entirely.</p><br/><p>Sever!</p><br/><p>Without any hesitation, Lin Fan\u2019s right arm exploded off immediately.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, lost sheep in the seas of torments\u2026 Repent and you shall be saved.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even after severing his right arm, Lin Fan could not stop the relentless assault from the Boundless Future Buddha Lord as a Buddhist voice descended down from the sky and shrouded him within.</p><br/><p>This Buddhist voice possessed a power of Purification within it, as though it wanted to purify Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>\u2018Damn it!\u2019 Lin Fan yelped out in his heart. To think that this Boundless Future Buddha Lord would be this ruthless!</p><br/><p>\u201cYou want to purify Your Daddy? You\u2019ve got to be bloody dreaming!\u201d Lin Fan roared out.</p><br/><p>\u201cGreat Buddha\u2019s Light of Purification!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAll living beings in the world carry a Bodhisattva heart by nature!\u201d</p><br/><p>Within the Buddha race, the most profound mystic skill to cultivate of all was this right here. With a Golden Buddha encircling him, Bodhisattvas looked down onto the masses of the world.</p><br/><p>BOOM!</p><br/><p>A brilliant golden light shone out, seeming bedazzling beyond comparison.</p><br/><p>\u201cEH?\u201d</p><br/><p>An exclamation of astonishment rang out.</p><br/><p>\u201cHeavenly Lord Xin Feng is able to take in all the endless mystic skills. This is a mystic skill that stems from the Buddha race, and yet surpasses it! To think that a mere mortal such as yourself would know of this mystic skill! But, it\u2019s a pity that your cultivation of it is not perfect enough!\u201d The Boundless Future Buddha Lord exclaimed out before revealing a tone of disdain.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are the Boundless Future Buddha Lord?\u201d Lin Fan breathed out heavily as he raised his head and looked at the endless void. However, he could not catch sight of the Boundless Future Buddha Lord\u2019s figure.</p><br/><p>\u201cMortal, I am the Boundless Future Buddha Lord. Repent, and you shall be saved. You have already descended into the boundless Avici. Let me be the one to salvage you and bring you out of that sea of torment.\u201d The voice of the Boundless Future Buddha Lord sounded metallic.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck your mother\u2019s a*s! Your Daddy doesn\u2019t need the salvation of anyone!\u201d Lin Fan hollered out as the Mythical Parasol Tree within his body rumbled out furiously, causing a boundless amount of lifeforce to surge out. The severed right arm was regrown once again.</p><br/><p>\u201cVery well! Doesn\u2019t need the salvation of anyone\u2026 Your Ancestor loves that reply of yours! The Boundless Future Buddha Lord is a despicable person to begin with! Hahaha\u2026!\u201d The Selfless Demon Ancestor who was trapped in the sealed mountain roared out with laughter.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph! Selfless Buddha Ancestor, you have already been sealed here by me for dozens of thousands of years by now. But, you have yet to come to a realization. Unless you\u2019re waiting for me to kill you for real before you\u2019re pleased, are you?\u201d The Boundless Future Buddha Lord questioned harshly.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha! Don\u2019t come acting now! It\u2019s only now that I understood the truth. I suppose you aren\u2019t living too good of a life either, are you? Your Ancestor has been wondering why you hadn\u2019t come to kill me for the past so many years. But now I know\u2026 It\u2019s because your true self can\u2019t head over, right? I presume that you must have suffered quite a consequential loss in that duel back then, eh?\u201d The Selfless Demon Ancestor burst out in laughter once more.</p><br/><p>It was as though the Selfless Demon Ancestor had seen through every single trick and ploy of the Boundless Future Buddha Lord right now.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph, demon!\u201d The Boundless Future Buddha Lord scoffed out coldly.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo what if I\u2019m a demon? As the Selfless Demon Ancestor, I\u2019ve let a life of integrity, owning up to everything I do. If I killed your entire family, I would admit to it and not try to backstab anyone else. As for you, Boundless Future Buddha Lord? All you do is mess around with the hearts of others and deceive the masses. Look at those few who trusted you and ended up being scapegoats for you to sacrifice! But, it\u2019s a pity that your outcome will be nowhere decent either! Utmost Heavenly Lord state? You will never be able to come close to it in your life! HAHAHAH\u2026!\u201d The Selfless Demon Ancestor laughed out contemptuously.</p><br/><p>\u201cSHUT UP!\u201d The Boundless Future Buddha Lord felt his heart surge with fury. He did not want to waste his breath with the Selfless Demon Ancestor any longer.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan stood there breathing in deeply while trying to recover the powers he had lost.</p><br/><p>Strong\u2026 This was truly, extremely strong!</p><br/><p>The Boundless Future Buddha Lord was so darned strong\u2026 Lin Fan was certain that he was no match for the former. His heart felt like being hit by a surging tidal wave, especially after hearing the words of the Selfless Demon Ancestor.</p><br/><p>To think that this wasn\u2019t even the true body of the Boundless Future Buddha Lord! If the true body were to come forth, how strong would that be then?</p><br/><p>Perhaps, a single look would be enough for him to take down Lin Fan himself!</p><br/><p>He must absolutely not die here. Absolutely not!</p><br/><p>\u201cHeaven and Earth Smelt! Return!\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, Lin Fan shouted out, wanting to summon the Heaven and Earth Smelt back to him.</p><br/><p>But, how could the Boundless Future Buddha Lord allow Lin Fan to do as he wished?</p><br/><p>He pointed out at the void with his finger.</p><br/><p>One Flower, One World\u2026</p><br/><p>Millions of flowers blossomed out and interlinked countless of worlds together. To think that the Heaven and Earth Smelt would be trapped within them!</p><br/><p>\u201cMortal, it\u2019s time for you to convert.\u201d The Boundless Future Buddha Lord sighed out gently as a boundless Buddha power surged forth from the Heavens and crushed down toward Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>\u201cConvert your mother! Your Daddy will never ever convert over to anyone!\u201d Lin Fan had not expected that things would turn out as such.</p><br/><p>\u201cHeaven and Earth Sutra!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan yelled out as the Heaven and Earth Sutra that was imprinted on his back burst forth with a blinding brilliance before transforming into a series of distorted text characters.</p><br/><p>\u201cLad, if you don\u2019t wish to die, hold on steady! He will not be able to last for that long either!\u201d The enemy of an enemy was a friend after all, so the Selfless Demon Ancestor advised out.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was slightly taken aback for a moment. Without any hesitation, he channeled out his powers as the Heaven and Earth Sutra\u2019s text characters wrapped themselves around him and protected him thoroughly.</p><br/><p>When the Boundless Future Buddha Lord caught sight of those text characters, his face changed slightly, \u201cJust what are you to the Heavenly Lord Xin Feng?! How are you in possession of the Heaven and Earth Sutra as well?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed out coldly, \u201cIf Yours Truly is your daddy, then Heavenly Lord Xin Feng must be your grandfather then!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCOURTING DEATH!\u201d The Boundless Future Buddha Lord bellowed out as his palm encompassed the entire sky. That golden Buddha palm suppressed every single thing in the area, and even an imprint of a swastika was visible on it!</p><br/><p>BOOM!</p><br/><p>Quakes rippled out as the entire piece of sky seemed about to collapse at any moment.</p><br/><p>Urgh!</p><br/><p>Lin Fan spat out a mouthful of fresh blood.</p><br/><p>The Heaven and Earth Sutra wrapped around his body disappeared instantly. Even if this wasn\u2019t the true body of the Boundless Future Buddha Lord that had descended, it still wasn\u2019t something that Lin Fan could possibly handle.</p><br/><p>This Boundless Future Buddha Lord had surpassed everything he knew of. Given his current strength, there was no way he could possibly withstand it.</p><br/><p>The Boundless Future Buddha Lord came to a stop as though he had no more moves left.</p><br/><p>However, the frightening power of his was still gathered all over the place without disappearing, as though awaiting the final moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome at me if you\u2019ve got the guts! If Your Daddy blinks even once, I\u2019ll take on your surname instead!\u201d Lin Fan shouted out.</p><br/><p>But at this moment, something that shocked Lin Fan happened.</p><br/><p>A Buddhist palm appeared between the Heaven and Earth all of a sudden!</p><br/><p>And on that Buddhist palm were two figures.</p><br/><p>Qiu Zhanyu and Jin Zhengu!</p><br/><p>Both of them were still in a daze right now. Weren\u2019t they doing alright outside just moments earlier? How were they sent here all of a sudden?</p><br/><p>\u201cBig Bro\u2026!\u201d When Qiu Zhanyu caught sight of Lin Fan, he rushed up immediately. However, that Buddha palm closed up and trapped the two of them within the center of its palm.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you wish for them to die?\u201d The Boundless Future Buddha Lord spoke up.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026!\u201d Lin Fan had not expected that this Boundless Future Buddha Lord would be this devious!</p><br/><p>\u201cBoundless Future Buddha Lord! You are as despicable as always! Why did the Infinite Buddha Ancestor decide to save you back then? I\u2019m afraid he must be regretting immensely right now as well. You are a complete humiliation of his legacy!\u201d The Selfless Demon Ancestor spoke up.</p><br/><p>\u201cDemon Ancestor, you can shut up now. He is no longer existent. For all eternity from now on, he shall reincarnate within this Buddha heart of mine.\u201d The Boundless Future Buddha Lord laughed out.</p><br/><p>\u201cMortal! Lay down your sins and repent, and you shall become a Buddha! With that, I can spare your life! Otherwise, prepare to watch both of them vanishing into smoke!\u201d The Boundless Future Buddha Lord demanded.</p><br/><p>Qiu Zhanyu and Jin Zhengu had not understood what was going on at the start. But at this moment, it all became clear to them.</p><br/><p>Someone was using them to threaten their Big Bro!</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed out before turning around to glare at the Boundless Future Buddha Lord, \u201cYou fear me\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFear? I am never afraid of anyone!\u201d The Boundless Future Buddha Lord replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you do not fear, there is no way you would resort to using such underhanded techniques!\u201d Lin Fan continued.</p><br/><p>\u201cARGH!\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Qiu Zhanyu and Jin Zhengu shrieked out tragically, \u201cIT HURTS\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLay down your sins and repent, and you shall become a Buddha. Otherwise, prepare to enter an endless state of reincarnation!\u201d The boundless voice of the Boundless Future Buddha Lord rang out once more as though this was his ultimatum right now.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan stood there and raised his head with an extremely sharp gaze, \u201cEven if you are stronger than me, so what? You still have to resort to these cheap tricks to get at me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI, Lin Fan, shall never ever be threatened by anyone!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cQIU ZHANYU! JIN ZHENGU!\u201d Lin Fan roared out.</p><br/><p>\u201cBig Bro\u2026!\u201d The both of them looked at Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>\u201cI HOPE THAT YOU GUYS DO NOT BLAME YOUR BIG BRO! AFTER YOU GUYS DIE, EVEN IF I HAVE TO PAY WITH MY LIFE, BIG BRO WILL TAKE REVENGE FOR YOU GUYS!\u201d Lin Fan screamed out madly. He knew that even if he were to bow down right now, his outcome would still be the same nevertheless. He might as well fight it out to the bitter end.</p><br/><p>\u201cBig Bro! We are not afraid! I, Qiu Zhanyu, had never once thought that I would ever turn this important one day! To think that I could be used as a hostage to threaten you with, Big Bro!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI, Jin Zhengu, as well! Hehe!\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, both Qiu Zhanyu and Jin Zhengu started laughing out. It felt as though everything was worthwhile right now. That laughter of theirs bore no regrets in it, and came from the bottom of their hearts.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked over at the Boundless Future Buddha Lord before lowering his head. He took out the Eternal Axe and muttered in his mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if I have to pay with everything I have, I will kill you.\u201d</p><br/><p>That sharp gaze of Lin Fan turned frenzied all of a sudden as the powers within his body started boiling like scorching lava. Every single fragment of power within his body was converged onto this Eternal Axe at this moment.</p><br/><p>A brilliant glare flashed and extended out just like a banner.</p><br/><p>Every drop of Essence Blood within Lin Fan\u2019s body started exploding out before being converted into the most berserk power possible.</p><br/><p>\u201cI, Lin Fan, and everyone who follows me, are all dauntless beings unafraid of death! You, the Boundless Future Buddha Lord\u2026 you are nothing more than a clown in my eyes! Even if I can\u2019t kill you today, I will definitely kill you one fine day! Heavenly Lord and whatnot? Through all ancient times and whatnot? ANYONE WHO DARES TO SOW A SEED OF VENGEANCE WITH ME, LIN FAN, SHALL FIGHT WITH ME TILL THE BITTER END!\u201d</p><br/><p>PSHEW!</p><br/><p>The bright light flashed out and transcended everything before bolting out and attacking the Boundless Future Buddha Lord.</p><br/><p>\u201cCourting death!\u201d The Boundless Future Buddha Lord snorted out coldly.</p><br/><p>\u201cHAHAHA! Lad, you better remember these words of yours! To the bitter end\u2026!\u201d At this moment, the Selfless Demon Ancestor burst out into a wild laughter as the sealed mountain started to quake and tremble out violently.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026!\u201d When the Boundless Future Buddha Lord sensed this, his heart skipped a beat as though he could not believe what was happening.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

As though each of its fingers were interconnected with one another in some manner, they formed an indestructible light barrier that had Lin Fan trapped within them.</p><br/><p>\"To think that Yours Truly would be able to fight against the Utmost Being of the Ancient race, Cruel, to this extent with just my strength right now. This is pretty unimaginable.\" Lin Fan was pretty satisfied with his behavior. He felt that he was way too cool right now.</p><br/><p>Even though there was that bit of luck that had attributed to this as well, Lin Fan wouldn't admit to it no matter what. After all, to Lin Fan, it was all because he was way too awesome.</p><br/><p>However, at this moment, Lin Fan wanted to seize the opportunity when Cruel was too preoccupied to bother about him and make his escape out of this place.</p><br/><p>These five fingers looked extremely menacing just on the surface itself. Seemed like it wasn't going to be easy to get out of this. He would probably have to go out with all he had.</p><br/><p>\"Xiguang, Long Xuan, I'm counting on you guys.\" Lin Fan turned over to the both of them.</p><br/><p>\"Master, don't worry. We'll definitely give it our best.\" Xiguang and Long Xuan nodded seriously.</p><br/><p>\"Alright, it's time for me to perform now!\" Lin Fan burst out laughing.</p><br/><p>\"Burn! 100,000,000,000 Shengyang Pills!\"</p><br/><p>Boom!</p><br/><p>At this moment, Flying Heavens was practically going nuts entirely. Lin Fan grabbed onto Flying Heavens and cultivated out a hand conveniently as well.</p><br/><p>With that, the 'Flying Heavens Electric Drill' was completed. Whether or not this succeeded would depend on this thing now.</p><br/><p>'Clang, clang, clang\u2026!'</p><br/><p>Lin Fan wielded the Flying Heavens Electric Drill as it began to start rotating. The mighty vibration caused Lin Fan's body to tremble along with it as well.</p><br/><p>\"Aiyo! Seems like it's a little tough, eh?\"</p><br/><p>To think that even after burning up 100,000,000,000 Shengyang Pills, Lin Fan couldn't burst a breach in it with one single strike! However, looking at how there was some signs of damage on the five fingers, his heart heaved a sigh of relief. As long as there was some impact, he was sure that it would definitely succeed eventually.</p><br/><p>Time passed gradually\u2026</p><br/><p>Lin Fan's heart was elated right now. He was getting closer and closer to success.</p><br/><p>\"Break!\"</p><br/><p>Bam!</p><br/><p>The five fingers suddenly erupted out. Lin Fan stood up and wiped off beads of sweat from his forehead, revealing a heartened smile.</p><br/><p>\"Haha! Trap me here? You're way too na\u00efve for that!\" Right now, Lin Fan was full of equipment for all sorts of situations. He could definitely make his way out of all sorts of sticky situations with ease!</p><br/><p>However, the current situation right now had him pretty confused. Cruel had suddenly disappeared. Lin Fan did not know where he had gone to, neither did he know what he was supposed to do right now.</p><br/><p>\"Bloody hell, f*ck it!\" Lin Fan did not want to think anymore at this moment. Since this was the case, then he was just going to have to give it his all and try to get out of this place.</p><br/><p>\"Qi of Biggra!\"</p><br/><p>Without any single bit of hesitation, Lin Fan slapped out with his palm. An endless amount of Biggra seeped out and permeated the surroundings.</p><br/><p>Even though Cruel was an Utmost Being of the Ancient race, so what? The Qi of Biggra was an invincible existence. As long as one was a living being, one would definitely be unable to pull oneself out of it.</p><br/><p>This dense amount of Qi of Biggra filled up the entire place. Even though his surroundings were vast, it was no problem for the Qi of Biggra at all.</p><br/><p>After all, this Qi of Biggra right now was acting as Lin Fan's eyes; it could seek out an exit for him.</p><br/><p>\"True Origins Crushing Kick!\"</p><br/><p>\"Black Tiger Steals Heart!\"</p><br/><p>\"Twisting Heaven and Earth!\"</p><br/><p>These three great evil moves had long reached a state of extraordinary impact. A single use of any one of them was enough to devastate the entire world and cause gods and ghosts to weep in its presence, rendering anyone unable to resist them at all.</p><br/><p>The sky was filled with imprints of his feet as palm slaps slammed out all the way as well.</p><br/><p>\"One day, I, Lin Fan, am going to be an Utmost Existence in this world! This little, puny place shall not even dream of keeping me in here!\" Lin Fan roared out while sending an immense amount of force that wanted to rip this unknown place.</p><br/><p>Of course, all of this was overthinking on Lin Fan's part.</p><br/><p>\"Ahhhh!!!\"</p><br/><p>\"It's so hot!\"</p><br/><p>\"Scarlet Rainbow Demon! What are you doing! Stop!\"</p><br/><p>\"I can't take it anymore! I can't take it no longer!\"</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>Just as Lin Fan was about to give up resisting, he heard this series of murmurs.</p><br/><p>\"Holy f*ck! Could it be them?\" Suddenly, Lin Fan's heart leaped with joy. He was feeling insane right now. To think that he could already have gotten those Shengyang Pills. Could it be that he could possibly take away with him ten divine celestial level 10, Eternal God state beings from this place as well?</p><br/><p>\"Brothers, attack!\" Lin Fan beckoned with his hands. He sprinted forth into the distance with a heart of excitement.</p><br/><p>The Thunder Trainer King was long dying of lust to train these powerful beings. Therefore, he followed after Lin Fan fervently.</p><br/><p>\"Master, wait for me! Bring me with you for this pleasure ahead!\"</p><br/><p>\"Alright!\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan had not expected that this vent of frustration at the walls would have broken through to some unknown place! And with that, the Qi of Biggra then seeped in, causing those ten old fogeys to enter a berserk state right now.</p><br/><p>By the time Lin Fan came before these ten old fogeys, he was completely blinded due to the sight before him.</p><br/><p>The image of ten old fogeys huddled up together\u2026 Well, honestly, it would be up to the listeners and readers to imagine if they wanted to.</p><br/><p>\"Holy f*ck! This is utterly savage! This single image\u2026 This is worse than beasts could ever be!\" Lin Fan was enraged right now. This was a degeneracy of morals right here!</p><br/><p>\"Y-you guys\u2026! H-how could you\u2026?\" Lin Fan pointed out with his trembling fingers at this unbelievable sight before his eyes.</p><br/><p>\"What's this?! What's in this mist?\"</p><br/><p>\"Why are things happening like this? Scarlet Rainbow Demon! You had better stop right now!\"</p><br/><p>\"You asked me to stop? Then why are YOU touching me!\"</p><br/><p>\"I can't hold it in anymore!\"</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>\"Master, how's my new masterpiece? Ever since I fused more skills into it, my medicinal effects have gotten way stronger! All of these impressive looking but ultimately useless Eternal God state powerful beings? I can seduce even their hearts right now!\" The Spirit of Biggra declared proudly.</p><br/><p>Divine celestial level 10, Eternal God state beings\u2026 Which one of them weren't beings that were resolute and firm in the heart? Most charm tactics and tricks wouldn't work on people like them at all.</p><br/><p>However, the Spirit of Biggra had evolved. He could even lure away the hearts of these people now.</p><br/><p>\"It's you! You're the one who did this!\"</p><br/><p>\"Hurry up and release us from this! You beast!\"</p><br/><p>\"I hate you! Utmost Being, please save us!\"</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>The moment these old fogeys heard the words of the Spirit of Biggra, they started bellowing out madly. Even though they did not wish to do so in their hearts, their bodies were betraying them right now, causing them to engage in such shamelessly despicable acts.</p><br/><p>\"Master, these guys\u2026 How should we deal with them?\" The Thunder Trainer King looked at the bodies of these old fogeys with an insatiable hunger. How nice would it be if he could bring all of them back to his Academy for Electroconvulsive Therapy?</p><br/><p>Perhaps he might even be able to come up with some new training methods from their bodies. After all, one must always move with the times and create more gimmicks.</p><br/><p>\"Keep eight of them and we'll kill two.\" Lin Fan opened up the panel of his system and checked it out. The experience points that he required for leveling up were just about there. He should be able to level up by killing two of them.</p><br/><p>As for the others, he would just have to whip them into shape and toss them into his Paradise, training them to cultivate Shengyang Pills for him day and night.</p><br/><p>This plan seemed extremely sturdy to Lin Fan. There shouldn't be any issues with this.</p><br/><p>\"Our Master is wise!\" The moment the Thunder Trainer King heard these words, he leaped with joy immediately. This meant that he would be able to train up eight of them! Exciting! This was just pure euphoria!</p><br/><p>\"No, don't kill me! Don't kill me!\"</p><br/><p>\"I'm willing to submit to you!\"</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>The moment these old fogeys heard that Lin Fan was going to kill two of them, they were suddenly extremely nervous in their hearts. They were shackled down by the locks of Cruel, rendering them unable to resist at all. At the same time, they did not know what was happening to the Utmost Being right now.</p><br/><p>\"Then, that's going to be difficult.\" Lin Fan looked over at the old fogeys who were in a series of tears and snot right now, feeling helpless. Just who should he kill?</p><br/><p>After that, Lin Fan's brows twitched as a plan entered his head, \"I've got an idea.\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

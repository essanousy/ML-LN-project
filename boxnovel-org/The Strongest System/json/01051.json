I\u2019ve never experienced this feeling in the past hundreds of years. My mental state has already long been purified, without any fear or cowardice. How could something as terrifying as such happen right now?\u201d In the depths of the Kunlun God Sect, Tian Fengling\u2019s mental state was going crazy. This was a situation that had never happened in a long time now, especially not since he had cultivated himself to such a state. By right, he should be void of all weak emotions of the outside world at this point. Even when faced with the most dangerous possible scenarios, he would still be able to maintain his composure.</p><br/><p>And yet, Tian Fengling was feeling extremely unsettled. He couldn\u2019t even calm his heart down any longer.</p><br/><p>Tian Fengling swept his robes, sending forth countless stars to line the skies. He then deployed an unparalleled mystic skill and started calculating his fate, trying to determine just where this uneasy feeling of his was coming from.</p><br/><p>As for Lin Fan right now, he did not dare to act overly brazen.</p><br/><p>The core of this Kunlun God Mountain lay in its middle. If he were to alert the Weapon Spirit of the Kunlun God Mountain, Tian Fengling would most probably be the first to come killing over and take his little life along with it.</p><br/><p>Steady\u2026 He had to hold firm and steady.</p><br/><p>The flames of Pills Through Thought incinerated everything around it. As though he was just following through a tunnel, Lin Fan was heading forward slowly as well.</p><br/><p>One meter!</p><br/><p>Two meters!</p><br/><p>Three meters!</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was keeping an extremely low profile right now as he slowly leveled the ground around him\u2026No acting tough, no getting brazen or whatnot. The main reason for that was because Tian Fengling was way too domineering.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>After a long time, Lin Fan finally exited from the Kunlun God Mountain.</p><br/><p>Standing outside, he sucked in a deep breath of air; the air outside seemed simply way too fresh! But when he caught sight of the scenery before him, he was totally stumped.</p><br/><p>In Lin Fan\u2019s memory, this entire place should have been empty and spacious! But, why was there a mountain range before him?</p><br/><p>Shocking! This was simply way too shocking! At the same time, Lin Fan felt that this range was just comprised of normal mountains. There was nothing different about them at all!</p><br/><p>Even though this Kunlun God Mountain was a Supreme Grade Immortal Weapon, it was Tian Lingfeng\u2019s initial true body that was cultivated into this Immortal Weapon. Using his Laws to cultivate it day and night, the mystical effects it possessed had gone way beyond that of a normal Supreme Grade Immortal Weapon right now.</p><br/><p>Perhaps, it might not be impossible for this to break through beyond the Supreme Grade Immortal Weapon state.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan pondered for a moment. If he were to just leave right away, that might probably be the safer option. However, what sort of a person was he? One should not leave their grudges overnight. This Tian Fengling had dared to suppress him as such; if he didn\u2019t teach this guy a lesson or two, he might probably think that Yours Truly was a pushover, wouldn\u2019t he?</p><br/><p>Thinking that, the Heaven and Earth Smelt was summoned, which floated out in the world instantly.</p><br/><p>Larger!</p><br/><p>Larger!</p><br/><p>The Heaven and Earth Smelt which was initially only the size of Lin Fan\u2019s palm started enlarging endlessly just like a blanket. At this moment, the entire skies were being covered up by it.</p><br/><p>In Lin Fan\u2019s eyes, the Heaven and Earth Smelt was the most formidable existence ever. As long as it was a material thing, one could stuff it right into the Heaven and Earth Smelt and refine the bollocks out of it.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan swept his robes and had the Heaven and Earth Smelt descend from the sky, collecting the entire range of mountains within it.</p><br/><p>BOOM!</p><br/><p>The earth suddenly started quaking. The Weapon Spirit of the Kunlun God Mountain, which was deep in slumber, was momentarily jerked awake by the shock. \u2018What\u2019s going on? What just happened!\u2019</p><br/><p>He knew that he was supposed to keep someone imprisoned for a hundred years. Therefore, it felt bored and entered into an endlessly deep sleep. But all of a sudden, a reverberating boom shocked it into awakening.</p><br/><p>\u201cSmelt, come back! Time to leave!\u201d Without hesitating, Lin Fan kept back the Heaven and Earth Smelt. In fact, he hadn\u2019t even begun to smelt the Kunlun God Mountain within it yet as he slipped off and disappeared.</p><br/><p>There was a lake in front of him. Leaping down, Lin Fan retracted his aura and entered Stealth mode before hiding inside without daring to budge even a single inch.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>At this moment, an enraged roar boomed through the entire Kunlun God Sect. \u201cKunlun God Mountain! My Kunlun God Mountain!\u201d Tian Fengling roared out in anger.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Tai Qiantian asked perplexedly. The commotion caused by Tian Fengling had attracted the other Vice Grandmasters as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve lost connection with my Kunlun God Mountain! That disciple has escaped from beneath my Kunlun God Mountain! I\u2019ve got to head over to check it out right now!\u201d Without waiting any further, Tian Fengling ripped through the void and headed over in that direction.</p><br/><p>Tai Qiantian exchanged glances with the other few Vice Grandmasters and followed close behind.</p><br/><p>This was something that did not seem possible to them at all. The Kunlun God Mountain was the true body of Tian Fengling! Tian Fengling was initially a living spirit given birth by the Kunlun God Mountain. After he became an immortal, he cultivated the Kunlun God Mountain into an Immortal Weapon of his own life.</p><br/><p>But now that he was claiming that his connection with the Kunlun God Mountain was severed, that was something absolutely inconceivable in their minds.</p><br/><p>The Kunlun God Mountain was impossibly large and incomparably heavy, spanning over hundreds of thousands of miles! It was also the toughest Immortal Weapon to snatch over in the entire Endless Mainland.</p><br/><p>If someone wanted to refine the Kunlun God Mountain, there was no way Tian Fengling could have no idea about it! How could his connection with the Kunlun God Mountain be severed within a moment?</p><br/><p>However, they might never ever know that the Kunlun God Mountain was covered by Lin Fan\u2019s smelt and uprooted entirely.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Time and space vibrated as a few figures appeared where Lin Fan had disappeared. When Tian Fengling caught sight of everything before him, he felt his heart tightening up in pain, \u201cARGH\u2026! My Kunlun God Mountain!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn it! DAMN IT! COME ON OUT!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tian Fengling roared out in rage as a berserk aura burst forth from him. That aura shook the entire world, blanketing the area in a radius of 10,000 miles.</p><br/><p>Right now, he was completely stupefied, especially after witnessing this empty place right before his eyes. His inner heart felt as though it was about to break down. This was the Immortal Weapon of his life!</p><br/><p>From the moment he was born, it had been following him around! But to think that it would have disappeared at this moment!</p><br/><p>That was the Kunlun God Mountain which had a chance of breaking through beyond the Supreme Grade Immortal Weapon state!</p><br/><p>\u201cLIN FAN OF THE HEAVEN AND EARTH SECT\u2026!\u201d Tian Fengling reared his head and bellowed. Both his eyes were baleful right now.</p><br/><p>Tai Qiantian observed everything around him, \u201cThere\u2019s some activity in the void up ahead. The kid has run off in that direction.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cChase!\u201d</p><br/><p>How could Tian Fengling remain waiting right here? He naturally chased in that direction. No matter what, he would have to retrieve the Kunlun God Mountain. The only thing was that he did not know what sort of methods that fella was using to actually be able to break off his connection with the Kunlun God Mountain!</p><br/><p>At this moment, Lin Fan, who was hiding in the lake, felt his face tense up. Someone had already appeared in the sky above him.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was still filled with confidence toward his concealment methods. As long as he wanted to hide, he was sure that these fellas would not be able to find him.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust where has he gone to? The ripples in the void ended right here!\u201d Tai Qiantian focused his sight and looked around, his expression filled with suspicion.</p><br/><p>Even though the Kunlun God Mountain was an Immortal Weapon of Tian Fengling, it bore a huge relationship with the sect. It was a treasure that was used to solidify the fortune of their sect.</p><br/><p>Now that it had disappeared, Tian Fengling was not the only one worried. They were all extremely worried as well.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was just lying there with his head raised, looking at the few figures up in the void. At this point, there was no way he could run anymore. It was time to see who could outlast the other then.</p><br/><p>At the same time, the Kunlun God Mountain was struggling furiously within the Heaven and Earth Smelt. However, there was no f*ck use of it at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cRefine!\u201d</p><br/><p>Since there was nothing for him to do right now, Lin Fan might as well start refining the Kunlun God Mountian. Who knew, it might even bring forth some surprise for him.</p><br/><p>At this moment, the power of refinement shrouded the entire Heaven and Earth Smelt. Even though the Kunlun God Mountain was an Immortal Weapon, at a time like this, it could only bear the outcome of being refined.</p><br/><p>\u201cARGH!\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly, a tragic cry rang out from the void above. Tian Fengling was starting to break down.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

LEVEL UP!</p><br/><p>Translator: Lam Editor: Hitesh</p><br/><p>Lin Fan prayed fervently. All he needed was a few more pericelestial beasts, and he\u2019d be done.</p><br/><p>Once his 100,000,000 experience points were filled, he\u2019d be able to enter the middle level of the postcelestial stage, receiving a boost in fighting strength immediately. In fact, he could even try reaching the pericelestial level.</p><br/><p>\"Junior Master, here it comes!\"</p><br/><p>Just then, a gigantic carcass flew over at Lin Fan. Even just staring at the size of it shocked him.</p><br/><p>\"Catch my finger!\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shouted and pierced the beast\u2019s skull.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026congratulations on killing postcelestial upper-level beast: Snow Tiger.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026experience points +100,000.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026\u2018Deflowering Finger\u2019 has leveled up.\u2019</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>\u2018Wait a moment. Something\u2019s not right! How could such a high-level beast only give so little experience points! That\u2019s bullshit! Complete bullshit!\u2019</p><br/><p>But, Lin Fan gradually understood. Even though his cultivation base was at postcelestial initial level, his fighting strength was comparable to that of a pericelestial. Therefore, in his hands, this postcelestial upper-level beast wouldn\u2019t be of any threat.</p><br/><p>Hence, it only gave off so little experience points in the system.</p><br/><p>Upon realizing this, Lin Fan no longer wanted to kill all these small little critters. He shouted over, \"Junior Disciples! Look for pericelestial beasts! These postcelestials are of not much use!\"</p><br/><p>Zong Hentian, who was leading the search, shuddered helplessly. How could there be so many pericelestial beasts available?</p><br/><p>To begin with, Floating Snow Peaks was not even a forbidden ground. Therefore, it didn\u2019t even contain too many beasts usually. The presence of these beasts now was because they were attracted here by the appearance of the Snow Lion. If not for that, there probably wouldn\u2019t even be a single pericelestial beast present.</p><br/><p>\"Alright, Junior Master. We\u2019ll try looking!\" Zong Hentian replied.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan felt better instantly. All he needed was 30,000,000 more experience points to level up.</p><br/><p>At the same time, Lin Fan understood a point. To level up, he needed a group of highly skilled teammates to give him assistance.</p><br/><p>If he were to just depend on himself, it\u2019d take way too long.</p><br/><p>\"ROAR!\"</p><br/><p>Just then, a furious roar rang over. Lin Fan leaped with joy. Such a vibrant roar! This must definitely be a high leveled beast!</p><br/><p>\"Senior Brothers, please render your assistance! There\u2019s a pericelestial upper-level beast over here! I can\u2019t deal with it alone!\" A call of distress came over from a distance.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was overcome with joy. Pericelestial upper-level beast?! He\u2019d be rich with experience points if he could land the killing blow!</p><br/><p>Suddenly, a bunch of trees ahead of them collapsed onto the ground in a swoop, and a strong aura could be sensed.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan rushed ahead, observing the situation from a distance.</p><br/><p>The beast looked like a western dragon. It was around 10 feet tall, with the stature of a small mountain itself.</p><br/><p>Zong Hentian and the other disciples had rounded it up and were bashing on it viciously from all sides.</p><br/><p>\"Buck up, Junior Disciples! Give him a good wallop! I\u2019ll come in soon!\" Lin Fan\u2019s eyes widened as he waved exuberantly. He MUST kill this thing!</p><br/><p>\u2018Whether or not Yours Truly can level up depends on this!\u2019</p><br/><p>The beast was filled with blood from head to toe, as it let out another roar of wrath. It was determined to fight Zong Hentian and the rest of them to death.</p><br/><p>Amongst the 15 of them, Zong Hentian had the highest cultivation base, and he firmly suppressed the beast.</p><br/><p>When he heard the beast\u2019s roar of wrath, he too shouted back at it with rage. Raising his palms, he leaped into the air. His palm was filled with True Energy, and a golden glow enveloped them. Crashing down from the skies with an unstoppable force, he struck the beast.</p><br/><p>Just then, the air was filled with the sounds of bones cracking, as the beast fell, kneeling on the floor immediately. Its breath gradually grew weaker, as it laid there breathing heavily, with a deep imprint of a palm on its body.</p><br/><p>\"Junior Master, here you go!\" Zong Hentian shouted over.</p><br/><p>\"Here I am!\" Lin Fan leaped excitedly towards the beast, jabbing his finger into its skull.</p><br/><p>A destructive force filled the beast\u2019s skull, rampaging within it.</p><br/><p>\"BOOM!\"</p><br/><p>The beast collapsed heavily on the ground with bloodshot eyes wide open. His grievance was that he had traveled thousands of miles from the forbidden ground over here, but it died before catching sight of the Snow Lion.</p><br/><p>Such injustice\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2018Killed it\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was ecstatic. He had f*cking finally killed it.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026Congratulations on defeating pericelestial upper-level beast: Blood Horned Violet Flying Dragon.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026experience points +30,000,000\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026congratulations on breaking through the bottleneck.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026cultivation base is now postcelestial middle level (0/200,000,000)\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026congratulations on unlocking fusion function.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026congratulations on obtaining Blood Dragon\u2019s Horn.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026congratulations on obtaining 1 drop of Blood Horned Violet Flying Dragon\u2019s Essence Blood.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Blood Horned Violet Flying Dragon\u2019s Essence Blood: Upon consumption, one turns into a semi dragon.\u2019</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>Lin Fan felt a powerful force surge through his body. It was stronger than anything he had ever felt before.</p><br/><p>But what Lin Fan could not understand was why the experience points required did not go down. In the past, it was a bottleneck. As long as he tided over it, the experience points required would decrease in fact!</p><br/><p>Not only did it not decrease, but it also jumped up by twice! Lin Fan was utterly speechless.</p><br/><p>But, that fusion function unlocked got him pretty curious. He wondered how it worked.</p><br/><p>But, this was not the time for it. After all, his junior disciples were waiting for him.</p><br/><p>\"How was it, Junior Master?\" Zong Hentian asked.</p><br/><p>They had not expected to bump into a pericelestial upper-level beast. Seemed like with the presence of the Snow Lion, many beasts had come along for the ride.</p><br/><p>\"Wonderful. The ingredients were great. It\u2019s all thanks to you Junior Disciples. Once we get back, I\u2019ll be sure to reward you boys with something good.\" Lin Fan laughed.</p><br/><p>Zong Hentian and the other disciples laughed along as well. As to Lin Fan\u2019s breakthrough in cultivation base, none of them felt anything at all, because the system hid his aura entirely. Unless he himself were to show it, no one would be able to detect it on their own.</p><br/><p>They carried on slaying beasts, but they were all low leveled beasts from there on. Lin Fan did not pay much attention to them, and they just continued clearing the area.</p><br/><p>\"Junior Master, it\u2019s getting late. We should head back. I suppose Elder Yu has already communicated with the other sects. I wonder how we\u2019re going to deal with the Snow Lion tomorrow.\" Zong Hentian let out a hint of worry in his voice.</p><br/><p>After all, the Snow Lion was a lesser celestial beast. These pericelestial beasts weren\u2019t even comparable to it. Even if its cubs were of lower cultivation base, they wouldn\u2019t be easy targets either.</p><br/><p>\"We must not rush head-on. Even if the time comes to it, we\u2019ll let the other sects take the frontlines. Remember not to show off.\" Lin Fan warned.</p><br/><p>\"How can we do that, Junior Master Lin! The expedition this time round, other than to deal with the Snow Lion, it\u2019s to show off our sect\u2019s prowess. How can we let the other sects take the attention?\" Zong Hentian replied.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at Zong Hentian and rolled his eyes. You god*mn bloody greenhorn. It\u2019s a miracle you could live to this day with that attitude.</p><br/><p>\"Just listen to my instructions tomorrow.\" Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>Even though Zong Hentian did not agree entirely, he nodded his head.</p><br/><p>Translator Notes:</p><br/><p>Alright guys, so apparently there\u2019s been a miscommunication earlier with the glossary as made evident through this chapter.</p><br/><p>So, apparently, now that they\u2019re in Dongling Continent, the leveling system seems to have changed. In every cultivation base, there seems to be lower level, middle level, upper level and full cultivation.</p><br/><p>But do forgive my mistake on not making this point as clear as possible earlier on as the novel did not indicate it clearly as well.</p><br/><p>And also, the portion about the western dragon, I hope you guys understand the difference between the Chinese dragon and the Western dragon.</p><br/><p>Chinese Dragon is like a giant snake with claws and scales. Western Dragon is like a gigantic lizard with wings.</p><br/><p>Cheers!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

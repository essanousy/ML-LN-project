Did you hear the words of our Big Bro? Our Big Bro is here to collect your life!\u201d Qiu Zhanyu hollered out.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan\u2019s brows furrowed. This Demon Lord was a little overbearing now, wasn\u2019t he? To think that he wouldn\u2019t budge even a single inch. Was he looking down on him, Lin Fan?</p><br/><p>Then that would be bloody awkward!</p><br/><p>\u201cBig Bro, that fella seems to be belittling us!\u201d Jin Zhengu said in a small huff.</p><br/><p>They had not thought that they would one day be this domineering. Following along with their Big Bro, they could shout out and go against a Mystic Immortal! This situation was simply way too domineering!</p><br/><p>\u201cCourting death!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan\u2019s brows furrowed as he burst forth with the Sword Wills that he had cultivated out recently. A penetrating Sword Will sliced through the world and instantly bolted out towards the Demon Lord who was sitting there in the void.</p><br/><p>The sharp Sword Will was unyielding, causing the void in the entire underground abyss to vibrate.</p><br/><p>\u201cBig Bro, you\u2019re so strong!\u201d Qiu Zhanyu and Jin Zhengu exclaimed out in shock.</p><br/><p>Urgh!</p><br/><p>Wherever the Sword Will passed by, nothing could stand in its way as it slew the Demon Lord instantly. The corpse even ruptured out violently, turning into a splash of blood that sprayed out in the entire world.</p><br/><p>\u201cBravo, Big Bro!\u201d The both of them cheered.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was slightly taken aback right now. Bloody hell! This was just like bumping into a ghost! Was this the legendary Demon Lord or something? But, wasn\u2019t that just way too bloody weak?</p><br/><p>To be sliced to death through a single sword of his\u2026 Easy! This was way too easy!</p><br/><p>It was easy to the point of even being somewhat unbelievable.</p><br/><p>However, there was something odd. Since he had killed the Demon Lord, why was there no notification that came from the System?</p><br/><p>At this moment, Lin Fan\u2019s mind opened up.</p><br/><p>Could it be that the Demon Lord had already succumbed to death from his grave injuries earlier on? Perhaps that Fey woman up above did not know about it and was still blindly seducing people, thinking that the Demon Lord was not dead!</p><br/><p>Holy f*ck!</p><br/><p>Then this would be a huge loss! To think that he would have gotten nothing out of this! Bloody dog sh*t!</p><br/><p>\u201cWho\u2019s there\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>And just at this moment, an earthshaking bellow boomed out furiously from the confines of the void around them. Even though it was just a mere voice, the entire void was quaking intensely under its might.</p><br/><p>A torrential Demonic Qi burst forth from deep underground. Slowly, the Demonic Qi materialized and eventually formed a pair of eyes of a demon. This pair of Demonic Eyes looked down on the entire world in disdain before sweeping over to where Lin Fan and the others were.</p><br/><p>\u201cTo think that there would be people who would choose to come in and send themselves to death\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>Initially, Lin Fan was still somewhat bewildered. But, when he caught sight of the pair of Demonic Eyes, he was just completely stunned.</p><br/><p>As for the two brothers, Qiu Zhanyu and Jin Zhengu, who were still feeling domineering early on, their legs were already wobbling after they heard the voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cB-big Bro\u2026! T-this\u2026 What is this!?\u201d Qiu Zhanyu stuttered out.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan gulped down and even had thoughts of suiciding right now.</p><br/><p>It was only now that Lin Fan understood the fact that the thingy earlier on wasn\u2019t the Demon Lord at all! It was just a tribute that was used to help the Demon Lord recuperate from his wounds!</p><br/><p>\u2018Holy f*ck his f*cking father\u2026!\u2019 Lin Fan cussed out in his heart. He then picked up the both of them and shouted, \u201cRUN!!!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Even though he had yet to witness the true body of the Demon Lord, just that pair of Demonic Eyes and the Demonic Qi that was emitted earlier on was enough for him to be convinced.</p><br/><p>This was definitely not something that he could deal with at all.</p><br/><p>This was a bloody huge a*sed baddie!</p><br/><p>\u201cSince you\u2019re already here, enter then! Seems like you guys have already seen through the ruse that Your Lord here had set up earlier on. Why now? Did you guys think that a few mere ants such as yourselves could actually take me down even if Your Lord was injured?\u201d</p><br/><p>BOOM!</p><br/><p>The ground caved in as a series of gigantic black pillars bolted up from beneath and sealed up the place from all directions.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet us fly!\u201d Without thinking twice, Lin Fan rose up into the void immediately.</p><br/><p>But, just as he raised his head and was prepared to head up into the void, he realized that there were a series of red banners streaming around in the void.</p><br/><p>Just like pythons, those red banners swam everywhere; thick and clustered, they intertwined with one another. It was as though if anything dared to make contact with them, the only path awaiting them would be death.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Lin Fan swallowed his saliva and felt his nuts hurting. This mother*cker just wanted to play him out and have him die here, didn\u2019t he?</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a misunderstanding, Demon Lord! We\u2019re here to bring medicine for you!\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, Lin Fan who had remained relatively silent the entire time screamed out at the top of his lungs.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuehue\u2026 Do you take Your Lord for a fool?\u201d The voice boomed out from beneath the ground once more. There was a hint of contempt in that tone of his.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s really a misunderstanding, Demon Lord! The three of us are true and faithful to you, Demon Lord! We\u2019re truly here to bring medicine for you! Here is a Heaven and Earth Invincible Healing Saint Pill that can help you to heal up your wounds, Demon Lord! If you do not believe me, you can try it for yourself, Demon Lord!\u201d Lin Fan did not hesitate as he tossed the Damage Leaving Pill over.</p><br/><p>The pill vanished within the void as though it was being grabbed over by an invisible hand.</p><br/><p>Thereafter, the void went silent once more.</p><br/><p>The silence ensued for a long time.</p><br/><p>\u201cBig Bro, what should we do?\u201d Qiu Zhanyu whispered and asked somewhat timidly.</p><br/><p>Jin Zhengu nodded his head repeatedly as well. This was so damned bloody scary!</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t fret.\u201d Lin Fan held his breath and wiped the beads of sweat off his forehead right now.</p><br/><p>Just this aura alone was enough for him to know that the Demon Lord wasn\u2019t someone he could fight with.</p><br/><p>This aura definitely surpassed that of a Mystic Immortal. As for how strong it truly was, Lin Fan truly had no idea. If he couldn\u2019t get a sight of this guy for himself personally, he might never be able to find out.</p><br/><p>Indeed, it didn\u2019t take long before a voice that was filled with glee and authority boomed out from the void.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre there any more of those pills?\u201d The Demon Lord roared out as though he had just discovered the wondrous effects of the pill.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, yes! The reason why we\u2019re here this time around is to help you heal up your wounds, Demon Lord!\u201d Lin Fan yelled out loudly.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood! Very good indeed! As long as you provide enough pills for Your Lord, Your Lord can take you guys under my wings and have you guys become a strong Demon within this world!\u201d The Demon Lord spoke up.</p><br/><p>\u201cMany thanks, Demon Lord! We\u2019re so touched we\u2019re basically crying out right now!\u201d Lin Fan wiped the side of his eyes before taking out a bunch of pills, \u201cThis are the last of the bunch now, Demon Lord! I hope that they will be useful to you, Demon Lord!\u201d</p><br/><p>As he tossed that bunch of pills over, they disappeared from the face of the world.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan lowered his head at this moment as his head whirled with thoughts.</p><br/><p>\u2018What should I do? Just what should I do? If this were to mother*cking not work, we would really be in for deep sh*t now!\u2019 Lin Fan thought in his mind.</p><br/><p>This was just one hell of an unfortunate encounter for their roaming exploration! Initially, he had killed a True Immortal state middle level being to become a True Immortal himself. But, who would have thought that after entering this underground abyss to obtain some cheap, quick gains, he would have met with this sicko of a Demon Lord! This was way too unexpected!</p><br/><p>Qiu Zhanyu and Jin Zhengu were stumped right now as well. The situation had changed against them way too quickly, hadn\u2019t it?!</p><br/><p>To think that right after they acknowledged someone as their Big Bro, they were going to die along with their Big Bro right now!</p><br/><p>BOOM!</p><br/><p>Indeed, it wasn\u2019t long before an overbearing aura burst forth.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood! To think that these pills would be able to help Your Lord recover by a good twenty percent! Very good\u2026!\u201d The voice of the Demon Lord traveled over. This was a voice filled with ecstasy.</p><br/><p>Initially, the wounds of the Demon Lord were extremely grim. Without these pills, he would require at least a hundred years before he could recover from them. But right now, he had already healed up by a good twenty percent!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is your name?\u201d At this moment, a figure appeared on the face of the world.</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan caught sight of that figure that had appeared, he was stunned. What a devilish looking man!</p><br/><p>If this man were put onto Earth, he would definitely be an existence who would make every single teenage girls and old aunty to crawl over and lick him all over with their tongues!</p><br/><p>But right now, this was the Endless Mainland. And not only that, it was evident that this Demon Lord was an extremely vicious being.</p><br/><p>\u201cReplying to the Demon Lord, this little one here is called Lin Fan!\u201d Lin Fan shouted out before taking a stealthy peek at him.</p><br/><p>Holy f*ck\u2026!</p><br/><p>Golden Immortal full cultivation state!</p><br/><p>This was an existence that was even more outrageous than Mystic Immortals!</p><br/><p>Motherf*cker! A powerful being of Golden Immortal full cultivation state? This guy could kill them with ease even with his injuries!</p></div>\n</div>"}

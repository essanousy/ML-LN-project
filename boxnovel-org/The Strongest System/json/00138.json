Facing the sea of experience points required, even massively gulping down a lot of pills continuously did not help that much at all.</p><br/><p>While the number of pills he took daily could not be considered little, most of them were low graded pills. Even after consuming them, they did not help much with his experience points.</p><br/><p>\"No, I have to head out to experience more waves.\"</p><br/><p>The peaceful and idle life was causing Lin Fan to feel uncomfortable, as though he was stagnant.</p><br/><p>He was far, really far, from his ultimate goal. And now that he was living so idly within the sect, that furiously burning heart he once had was starting to grow stale.</p><br/><p>Waves\u2026waves\u2026</p><br/><p>In his life, he did not need the help of the smooth sailing winds. All he needed was tumultuous waves of events. And now that nothing was happening, was he still himself at all?</p><br/><p>Postcelestial Level 1 (60,000,000/100,000,000)</p><br/><p>This experience points required left Lin Fan speechless.</p><br/><p>But, if he could cross the barrier, this barrier of level 1 postcelestial, the experience points required should drop.</p><br/><p>And now, within Glory Sect, he was already a highly regarded master. How could he continue milking experience points from his junior disciples. If word were to spread, wouldn\u2019t he just be a laughing stock?</p><br/><p>Besides, the world was so big. He ought to head out to experience it for himself.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan stood up. Opening his house doors and gazing at the clear blue skies, he made up his mind.</p><br/><p>He was going to leave the sect grounds and check out the world outside, bringing up his cultivation base.</p><br/><p>\"Junior Master.\" Just then, Tian Yu exited from his house. Upon seeing Lin Fan, he immediately stepped up and greeted.</p><br/><p>During his stay here, Tian Yu had experienced deep care and heartfelt concern. Furthermore, he had established a strong relationship with Zhang Ergou and Feng Bujue.</p><br/><p>Especially Zhang Ergou, the two of them were exceptionally chummy.</p><br/><p>Tian Yu recognized that Zhang Ergou\u2019s cultivation base was low, and that he had no talent at all. In the past, he would not have even bothered with such a disciple. But upon discovering Zhang Ergou\u2019s care and concern towards himself, it made him recall back to the times when he was just a mere mortal, and the love of brothers in a family.</p><br/><p>\"Yes. Your cultivation base has reached postcelestial level 1. I doubt it will be long before you will return to your peak.\" Lin Fan\u2019s gaze focused at Tian Yu.</p><br/><p>In this period of time, Tian Yu\u2019s cultivation foundation had been retrieved by Lin Fan by a huge portion. Furthermore, given that he had a good foundation in the past, his cultivation speed was all the more faster than the rest.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan realized that indeed, a talent was a talent.</p><br/><p>Even though he had a system, there were pros and cons.</p><br/><p>As long as there was sufficient experience, one could level up as many times as they\u2019d like to without the need for a good body or mental foundation. For those of them without the system, as long as they could overcome this obstacle, they could level up.</p><br/><p>When comparing the two methods, each had its strengths.</p><br/><p>Now, of course, the con of the system would be the leveling aspect. But that was about it. Other than that, everything else surpassed everything within this world.</p><br/><p>\"It was all because of Junior Master, who granted me a new life. This debt, I will etch it in my heart for the rest of my life.\" Tian Yu greeted thankfully.</p><br/><p>The longer he spent around Lin Fan, the more he realized about Lin Fan\u2019s mysteriousness.</p><br/><p>But what Tian Yu did not know was that within those seemingly godly and omnipotent eyes of his Junior Master was a world of worries. Because, in order to leave a good impression in front of Tian Yu, Lin Fan had to put on his best act every time he saw him. He could not even give himself space to relax lest he let up on his act.</p><br/><p>But to Lin Fan, this was all worth it. Based on Zhang Ergou\u2019s frequent reports, Tian Yu\u2019s attitude was gradually changing. As long as Lin Fan persisted, poaching this man from the main sect was not impossible.</p><br/><p>\"Master, we\u2019re back!\" Zhang Ergou and Feng Bujue\u2019s voices rang out from a distance.</p><br/><p>On their master\u2019s orders, both of them headed out to scout out some news.</p><br/><p>A few days earlier, Lin Fan already had the notion of leaving the sect grounds. So, he first sent these two out to find out more about the current situation within the sect.</p><br/><p>\"How, is there anything?\" Lin Fan asked.</p><br/><p>\"Yes! I just heard from within the inner sects that the sect is sending inner sect disciples up to the Floating Snow Peaks!\" Zhang Ergou replied.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan took a glance at Tian Yu. Since he was an inner sect disciple, he should know of the place.</p><br/><p>Receiving Junior Master Lin\u2019s gaze, Tian Yu explained, \"Junior Master, the Floating Snow Peaks lies within the Sky City. It snows continuously on the Floating Snow Peaks all year long, and is a place where many ferocious beasts gather. The Sky City belongs to all the major sects, and we take turns guarding it against the ferocious beasts.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded understandingly, \"So, did you guys find out what\u2019s their intentions of heading up to the peak?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes! But I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s real or not. It seems like a beast with a cultivation base of a Lesser celestial has appeared. But as for the actual situation, I\u2019m not too sure.\" Zhang Ergou answered.</p><br/><p>\"Junior Master, I suppose our sect has sent people out to slay the beast. While the lesser celestial beast\u2019s body may contain countless treasures, it is also wildly dangerous. Each of the major sects is probably planning to take action as well.\" Tian Yu elaborated. He had once taken part in such an operation. Thus, he was clear of what was happening.</p><br/><p>\"I see. Alright, you guys head back to rest.\" Lin Fan waved his hands and headed down the peak.</p><br/><p>He was going to head over to the Grand Master and ask for permission to hitch on this ride.</p><br/><p>Things like slaying beasts and the likes were Lin Fan\u2019s favorite. Not only were the experience points aplenty, so were the treasures. If he were to stay cooped within the sect, he wondered when he could finally level up.</p><br/><p>.</p><br/><p>\"What\u2019s master up to?\" Zhang Ergou shrugged, unable to understand his master\u2019s actions.</p><br/><p>\"Junior Master should be keen on heading there as well.\" Tian Yu remarked as he looked at Lin Fan\u2019s leaving back.</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>Heading down from the Nameless Peak, Lin Fan nodded his head to the outer sect disciples he passed by. These outer sect disciples\u2019 dream now was to be able to enter the Nameless Peak as a disciple.</p><br/><p>But, Junior Master Lin had not made any attempts to recruit any disciples. So, while they were anxiously waiting, they could do nothing.</p><br/><p>How could they have not seen Nameless Peak\u2019s potential back when they were starting up?</p><br/><p>But now, they were the ones on the begging end.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan traveled briskly towards the Grand Master\u2019s Great Hall. He was determined to follow the Grand Master down out of the sect grounds.</p><br/><p>\"Lin Fan requests an audience with the Grand Master.\"</p><br/><p>\"Enter.\"</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>Entering the Great Hall, there were a group of Senior Elders gathered as well. Revealing his most charming smile, Lin Fan greeted, \"Greetings, my Senior Brothers.\"</p><br/><p>\"Ahh, it\u2019s Junior Brother...\"</p><br/><p>Calling him Junior Brother did not leave a good taste in their mouths. After all, they were all a bunch of aged old men. Calling a young fella as Junior Brother was kind of weird.</p><br/><p>Yet, there was nothing wrong based on seniority. Now that Lin Fan was the master of the Nameless Peak, and had established his own sect, based on position, he was the same as them.</p><br/><p>And to regard seniority, those who entered after them were naturally Junior Brothers. Thus, in technical terms, Lin Fan was in no way unworthy of being called Junior Brother.</p><br/><p>Looking at Lin Fan, Grand Master Yan revealed a smile, \"Yes?\"</p><br/><p>.</p><br/><p>\"Master, I heard that you chose a few inner sect disciples to head up to the Floating Snow Peaks? I would like to follow as well.\"</p><br/><p>\"No.\" Just as Lin Fan had finished his words, the Senior Elders present rejected him immediately.</p><br/><p>Now that Lin Fan possessed \u2018Pills Through Thought\u2019, he was a darling of the sect. How could they let him take such a risk in the Danger Grounds?</p><br/><p>Furthermore, while the other sects might not bear any grudges against Glory Sect\u2026once they discovered that Glory Sect had a disciple who could perform \u2018Pills Through Thought\u2019, it was hard to guarantee that they would not try to assassinate him in case he became a threat in the future.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

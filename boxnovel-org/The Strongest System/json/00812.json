And then, as though something important had just struck her, she bolted off into the distance.</p><br/><p>\"How could things have turned out as such?\"</p><br/><p>At this moment, the Dragon Empress Shen Wu's mind was in a mess right now. What in the world was going on with her?! Why would she have such feelings?</p><br/><p>Once upon a time, the Dragon Empress Shen Wu was just a female of the Colossal Dragon race that was belittled by everyone. She was weak and wasn't given any recognition at all.</p><br/><p>Growing up in that environment of being belittled, the Dragon Empress Shen Wu's heart was firmer than any other being of the Colossal Dragon race. At the same time, she also turned colder and more aloof.</p><br/><p>'If anyone weren't happy, fight then!'</p><br/><p>As long as they would dare to touch her, she would smite down their entire races.</p><br/><p>That was the perfect description of the Dragon Empress Shen Wu. By the time she had grown stronger, there was no Colossal Dragon who would dare to act brazenly before her.</p><br/><p>Every single Colossal Dragon that caught sight of the Dragon Empress Shen Wu carried a look of respect on their faces.</p><br/><p>But at this moment, the Dragon Empress Shen Wu was discovering that something seemed to have invaded that heart of hers. It was something that was extremely conflicting with the character she once had in the past!</p><br/><p>\"That's just a mere human! Furthermore, he's my enemy! How could I possibly entertain such thoughts?\"</p><br/><p>The Dragon Empress Shen Wu struggled within her heart. However, each time she closed her eyes, the only thing that appeared was that final smile that appeared before the void closed up.</p><br/><p>That smile was like a sharp blade that pierced its way straight into the heart of the Dragon Empress Shen Wu.</p><br/><p>At this moment, the speed of the Dragon Empress Shen Wu was extremely fast. In the blink of an eye, she was thousands of miles away. The entire void was even showing signs of collapse due to the intense speed of the Dragon Empress Shen Wu.</p><br/><p>After god knows how long\u2026</p><br/><p>Far in the distance, an immense amount of Dragon Qi surged right into the Heavens. There were countless Colossal Dragons that were dancing in this Dragon Qi. The scene was exuberant and vast. This was the base of the Colossal Dragon race.</p><br/><p>When a Colossal Dragon caught sight of the Dragon Empress Shen Wu, he came forth and greeted her.</p><br/><p>\"Dragon Empress.\"</p><br/><p>\"Get lost!\"</p><br/><p>The Dragon Empress Shen Wu roared out before pushing this Colossal Dragon away instantly.</p><br/><p>The Colossal Dragon who was pushed away was stunned for a moment, unable to comprehend what was going on as he wondered what was up with the Dragon Empress. Could something have happened for her to be in such an irritable mood?</p><br/><p>Within the base\u2026</p><br/><p>\"Eh? What's wrong with the Dragon Empress today? Didn't she head out with Ancestor Dragon Wan Zun?\"</p><br/><p>\"Seems like something must have happened. Let us try to not speak about it. Otherwise, if we were overheard, things would definitely be bad for us.\"</p><br/><p>The members of the Colossal Dragon race whispered softly. When the Dragon Empress Shen Wu crossed through the skies above them, all of them shut up.</p><br/><p>Before a gigantic Dragon Tower\u2026</p><br/><p>The Dragon Empress Shen Wu landed from the sky ferociously. She kneeled down on the ground with one knee and said in a pressing tone.</p><br/><p>\"God of the Dragon Ancestor, Ancestor Dragon Wan Zun has betrayed us. There was someone who stood in to rescue me and is in deep peril right now! I implore for the Twelve Dragon Gods to step forth and help me with rescuing that human!\"</p><br/><p>All of a sudden, an alarmed voice rang forth from the gigantic and tall Dragon Tower.</p><br/><p>\"What did you just say?\"</p><br/><p>\"Ancestor Dragon Wan Zun has defected over to the Ancient race! I implore the God of the Dragon Ancestor to command the twelve Dragon Gods to follow me out so that we can suppress the Ancestor Dragon Wan Zun!\"</p><br/><p>The Dragon Empress Shen Wu lowered her head as she pleaded. For some unknown reason, she seemed to be extremely anxious about the wellbeing of that human right now.</p><br/><p>Within the Colossal Dragon race, Ancestor Dragon Wan Zun was one of the strongest there was. Even with the twelve Dragon Gods, there was no absolute confidence to defeat him. But, there should be a good chance of saving that human out of his hands.</p><br/><p>\"Shen Wu, everything you said is real?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes, it is. Absolutely. Time is ticking right now. Please give me an answer, God of the Dragon Ancestor.\" The Dragon Empress Shen Wu pressed on anxiously.</p><br/><p>\"The strength of Ancestor Dragon Wan Zun is not to be underestimated. Even the twelve Dragon Gods may not be enough to take him down. We have to think this through at length.\"</p><br/><p>\"No! Time is pressing right now! Otherwise, that human is not going to be able to hold out for much longer!\" For some unknown reason, the Dragon Empress Shen Wu had suddenly gained the courage to talk back against the God of the Dragon Ancestor.</p><br/><p>And the moment she said out with such words, the Dragon Empress Shen Wu snapped back to her senses.</p><br/><p>\"Hmph!\"</p><br/><p>\"Shen Wu, seems like you're really gutsy now eh? To think that you would dare to refute the words of the great God of the Dragon Ancestor?\"</p><br/><p>All of a sudden, harsh voices boomed out from all over the void.</p><br/><p>\"No, I wouldn't.\"</p><br/><p>The heart of the Dragon Empress Shen Wu was worried right now, not knowing what she should do.</p><br/><p>\"You guys, head with her and take a look.\"</p><br/><p>At this moment, the voice of the God of the Dragon Ancestor boomed out.</p><br/><p>The moment the Dragon Empress Shen Wu heard this, she felt her heart leap with a slight joy, \"Thank you, God of the Dragon Ancestor.\"</p><br/><p>She hadn't expected that the God of the Drago Ancestor would ask the Ancestor Dragon Hong Huang to follow her! This was an existence even greater than the twelve Dragon Gods!</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>At Lin Fan's area right now, the situation was pretty intense. With two Utmost Beings taking one side, the atmosphere was a little frightening.</p><br/><p>The few Colossal Dragons around the Ancestor Dragon Wan Zun were now walloped so badly that their knees were wobbling. While their cultivation states might be Divine celestial level 9 state, in front of the two Utmost Beings, they were nothing but ants.</p><br/><p>\"Spare us!\"</p><br/><p>\"We're willing to bow down!\"</p><br/><p>\"We were all forced by Wan Zun! We don't want to serve the Ancient race!\"</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Looking at these three Colossal Dragons, Lin Fan thought for a moment. While the strength of Divine celestial level 9 state powerful beings was pretty decent, Lin Fan was quite a bit of distance away from turning into a Divine celestial level 10 state being. Seemed like he had to top up some experience points now.</p><br/><p>BOOM!</p><br/><p>Lin Fan moved out instantly as he gripped his fingers tightly together, taking on the shape of a fist. Tossing his hand out, it was like a gigantic hammer that was pummelling down from the Heavens, caging the three Colossal Dragons within.</p><br/><p>\"N-NO! NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO\u2026!!!\"</p><br/><p>The moment the three Colossal Dragons saw this, they yelped out in horror. They had suddenly realized that under the might of this incredible power, the powers within their bodies could not be unleashed at all!</p><br/><p>BOOM!</p><br/><p>The three Colossal Dragons were squished by Lin Fan into scraps instantly.</p><br/><p>\"To think that my strength would be this strong right now. A single punch and I can kill all three of them? Not bad, not bad!\"</p><br/><p>Seeing this move of his, Lin Fan was extremely pleased.</p><br/><p>It wasn't that Lin Fan did not want to keep them alive. It was just that their strength is somewhat lacking now. They weren't even Divine celestial level 10 state beings! What fart use could they be of?</p><br/><p>'Ding\u2026Congratulations on killing Divine celestial level 9 state Colossal Dragon race being.'</p><br/><p>'Ding\u2026Experience Points +\u2026'</p><br/><p>Each time Lin Fan killed someone, he would forcefully snatch away everything from them. Their Blood, Essence Spirit, Powers, Universal Elixir et cetera\u2026Anything that was useful was all sucked in by Lin Fan instantly.</p><br/><p>And right now, Lin Fan's Paradise was already incomparably strong. His Universal Elixir had long been fused within his Paradise as well, and had turned into a raging sun that was shining a light in every single part of the Paradise. It was churning endlessly, emitting a tremendous energy all the time.</p><br/><p>\"Y-YOU\u2026!!!\"</p><br/><p>When Ancestor Dragon Wan Zun saw how his three underlings were killed by a single fist of this guy, he was completely dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>\"Alright, now that I'm done with the ants, let us gang whack him!\"</p><br/><p>Even though the Ancestor Dragon Wan Zun's strength might be formidable, for the Utmost Beings, killing him was something as simple as squishing an ant.</p><br/><p>However, Lin Fan loved to gang up and f*ck them up. Whether or not the other party liked it, it was something that was certain to happen.</p><br/><p>\"Traitor Wan Zun, here comes Yours Truly!\"</p><br/><p>The moment Ancestor Dragon Wan Zun caught sight of this, his heart was filled with despair. However, he wanted to fight with the last bit of strength he had.</p><br/><p>\"DAMN IT! SINCE YOU GUYS REFUSE TO GIVE ME A CHANCE TO LIVE, EVEN IF I DIE, I'LL DEFINITELY NOT LET YOU GUYS HAVE AN EASY TIME!\"</p><br/><p>\"ARGHHHHHHH!\"</p><br/><p>At this moment, a loud roar boomed out as the Ancestor Dragon Wan Zun used up all his powers.</p><br/><p>\"Hehe!\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan sniggered while he took out a large saber from his storage.</p><br/><p>The moment this saber appeared, the heart of Ancestor Dragon Wan Zun shivered. That saber gave off a bone-chilling aura.</p><br/><p>\"Dragon Slayer Saber! Specializes in chopping down Colossal Dragons!\"</p><br/><p>\"RUSH!!!\"</p><br/><p>Cruel, Ancient One, and the Big Ancient Demon rushed forth and clustered around Ancestor Dragon Wan Zun. Every single punch hit its mark as they whacked out with immense violence. They whacked the Ancestor Dragon Wan Zun so badly he was crying out for mercy with every single hit.</p><br/><p>\"Blood Bursting Fist of the North Star!\"</p><br/><p>\"B*obs Bursting Fist of the North Star!\"</p><br/><p>\"True Origins Crushing Kick!\"</p><br/><p>\"ARGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!\"</p><br/><p>At that moment, a series of tragic wails rang out one after another. The wails were extremely sorrowful to even take in one's ears. In fact, just by listening, one could almost feel their hearts breaking.</p><br/><p>\"Great Buddha's Light of Purification! Purify, purify\u2026!\"</p><br/><p>\"N-NOOOO! NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO\u2026!!!\"</p><br/><p>\"The Purification is not working! Seems like he's not walloped bad enough! Continue whacking him\u2026!\"</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

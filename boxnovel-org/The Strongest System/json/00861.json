For An Invincible Force!</p><br/><p>Translator: Lam_ Editor: Hitesh_</p><br/><p>\"How could this be?\"</p><br/><p>In the blink of an eye, the Shark Ancestor discovered that every single treasure ground and locked door within the Colossal Shark race had been forcefully opened up by a mysterious power! As though they weren't under any restrictions, all the treasures within flew out on their own.</p><br/><p>That calm water surface began to move a little. One after another, light spots rose from the depths of the ocean and came up, densely packed together.</p><br/><p>\"This\u2026!\"</p><br/><p>When the Shark Ancestor caught sight of these light spots, his face changed, \"These are Shengyang Pills!\"</p><br/><p>When Ling Wuwei saw these, he too was equally stumped. He hadn't expected for these treasures to come popping up by themselves!</p><br/><p>He then looked over at that figure floating up in the void with that long white robe that was fluttering in the air. That calm expression was unchanged, as though everything that was happening right now was within his expectations.</p><br/><p>\"Shark Ancestor, you're really quite the dishonest man, aren't you?\" When Lin Fan caught sight of these light spots, his lips involuntarily curled into a smirk.</p><br/><p>\"You\u2026!\" The heart of the Shark Ancestor began to rumble as a flame of rage started burning up.</p><br/><p>\"Are you bent on leaving my entire race with no way out of this?!\" The voice of the Shark Ancestor was turning coarse. He hadn't expected that this human would do this at all!</p><br/><p>This was just forcefully pillaging all the riches of the Colossal Shark race!</p><br/><p>\"Huehue!\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled out, \"Well, you're looking at what's going on yourself, right? Do you need to ask me?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed out. If he hadn't done this on his own, he wouldn't have known how dishonest this Shark Ancestor was! There were obviously thirty trillion Shengyang Pills here! To think that the Shark Ancestor would lie to him! This was way too scammy!</p><br/><p>Countless light spots bolted up into the sky. Lin Fan swept his robes and swallowed all of them up. The dense sky of light spots now started converging before flying off toward Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>One trillion!</p><br/><p>Two trillion!</p><br/><p>Three trillion!</p><br/><p>The endless amount of Shengyang Pills came down like stars right now, and were all kept by Lin Fan in his storage.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was exhilarated in his heart right now. Honestly, the best way of accumulating Shengyang Pills was through unethical means! If he had to depend on himself to produce this many Shengyang Pills, that would undoubtedly be just a fool's dream!</p><br/><p>With all of these Shengyang Pills, Lin Fan could activate Precious Treasure descends from the Heavens and cause the strength of the Xuanhuang World to be raised as a whole once again!</p><br/><p>Within the Xuanhuang World\u2026</p><br/><p>Lin Fan's boundless voice boomed out. Everyone in Glory Sect raised their heads to look over.</p><br/><p>\"Precious Treasures are going to start descending from the Heavens. All of you shall have to rely on your own affinity and destinies.\"</p><br/><p>PSHEW!</p><br/><p>The disciples of Glory Sect turned into a series of light beams and streaked out of Glory Sect.</p><br/><p>BOOM!</p><br/><p>The void of Xuanhuang World was suddenly shrouded by rainbow colored beams of light. All of the Shengyang Pills that were reaped in were exploding out continuously before turning into a dense, thick amount of Spirit Qi that was then absorbed by the system.</p><br/><p>Like shooting stars scattering all around the entire Xuanhuang World, these light spots that contained treasures shot down into the world. Countless new secret grounds appeared and were hidden within mountains and rivers.</p><br/><p>The locations of the treasure drops were all random. For anyone to be able to find them, it all depended entirely on affinity.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan's consciousness was spread out across the entire place as he grinned. This Precious Treasure descends from the Heavens was extraordinary indeed.</p><br/><p>Among these precious treasures, there were elixirs and miraculous pills, Dao Weapons, and even Utmost Treasures.</p><br/><p>Within these secret grounds, there were even heritages of extremely powerful beings. While they were only the legacy of Divine celestial cultivation state beings, this should be more than enough for the masses of the Xuanhuang World.</p><br/><p>In fact, there were even some secret grounds where legacies of Divine celestial level 10, Eternal God state beings could be found. This was something that completely made the ten trillion Shengyang Pills spent worthwhile in Lin Fan's opinion.</p><br/><p>\"Accursed Motherf*cking Human King, you're cutting off any route left for the Colossal Shark race to walk on in the future!\" The Shark Ancestor roared over this. His face had turned extremely grim and scary as well.</p><br/><p>He had finally understood. The Motherf*cking Human King had had no intentions of letting off the Colossal Shark race at all.</p><br/><p>\"That's right. The moment you decided to side with the Ancient race, there was no longer a need for the Colossal Shark race to continue existing.\" Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>\"Damn it! You f*cking bastard!\"</p><br/><p>Suddenly, the Shark Ancestor howled out and burst forth furiously, \"GO TO HELL!\"</p><br/><p>The stance of the Shark Ancestor was extremely imposing. Every single move he made was even more ferocious. It was as though he was bent on chewing Lin Fan to death.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan gripped his knuckles, \"Hmph! Watch my fist.\"</p><br/><p>Blood Bursting Fist of the North Star!</p><br/><p>While the Shark Ancestor was a Divine celestial level 10 state powerful being, his strength was far stronger than any average Divine celestial level 10 state beings. With a flip of his hands, countless mystic skills of martial arts were sent bolting forth.</p><br/><p>There were images of dragons, sharks, tigers\u2026a myriad of transformations as the mystic arts channeled.</p><br/><p>The Shark Ancestor could be considered as a powerful being that had trodden over all of ancient times. Therefore, his powers were naturally profound. When he deployed them, there was an earthshattering impact to be seen. If it were any ordinary powerful beings caught up in his hands, the only thing that awaited them was death.</p><br/><p>At this moment, the Shark Ancestors had truly been angered by Lin Fan thoroughly. While he knew that he wasn't a match for the Motherf*cking Human King, there was no intentions of the Motherf*cking Human King to let the Colossal Shark race go at all from the start.</p><br/><p>Since that was the case, he could only give it a dying shot.</p><br/><p>BAM!</p><br/><p>Countless mystic skills burst forth from the Shark Ancestor. However, Lin Fan was only casually throwing out punches left and right in return.</p><br/><p>BAM!</p><br/><p>BAM!</p><br/><p>Fresh blood sprayed all over as the skies exploded, and the shark head of the Shark Ancestor was left oozing with blood.</p><br/><p>\"ARGHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!\"</p><br/><p>A tragic cry rang out as the Shark Ancestor barked in rage, \"DAMN IT! GOD DAMN IT! MOTHERF*CKING HUMAN KING! YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A HORRIBLE DEATH!\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan gripped his knuckles. When he punched out these specially tailored gloves on his hands, the impact was truly outrageous.</p><br/><p>Firm and steady impacts!</p><br/><p>\"Shark Ancestor, just come forth with your true form and allow Yours Truly to slice away those Heaven Fins of yours.\"</p><br/><p>\"You guys of the Colossal Shark race have eaten up quite a number of Spirit race beings. Right now, Yours Truly is making the preparations to invite the Spirit race beings for a great Heaven Fins Feast. We're just waiting to see if you're going to accommodate along.\" Lin Fan chuckled out as though he had just said something extremely casual.</p><br/><p>\"YOU\u2026!\"</p><br/><p>The heart of the Shark Ancestor skipped a beat. He had already witnessed the outcome of the Shark God. His Heaven Fins were sliced off extremely tragically. And at this moment, the eyes of the Motherf*cking Human King were glaring straight at him. The meaning that was revealed through that gaze of the Motherf*cking Human King was extremely obvious.</p><br/><p>The Motherf*cking Human King clearly wanted to sever his Heaven Fins as well.</p><br/><p>No! Absolutely no way!</p><br/><p>He was the Shark Ancestor of the Colossal Shark race!</p><br/><p>\"GO TO HELL!\"</p><br/><p>The Shark Ancestor howled out as that menacing looking shark head roared out endlessly.</p><br/><p>\"MOTHERF*CKING HUMAN KING! EVEN THOUGH THIS OLD ONE HERE ISN'T YOUR MATCH, YOU CAN DREAM ON ABOUT HAVING IT EASY AS WELL!\"</p><br/><p>\"Tribute!\"</p><br/><p>BOOM!</p><br/><p>A thick beam of light shot up into the sky and pierced the Heavens with the Shark Ancestor in the middle of it all.</p><br/><p>\"Aiyoh! Holy f*ck! This Shark Ancestor is quite something! He knows how to make tributes as well!\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was startled before chuckling out. Wasn't this motherf*cker quite the clown?</p><br/><p>At this moment, dark clouds filled the sky with a momentous feeling that was descending and pushing down from the Heavens.</p><br/><p>When the hundreds of beings from the Spirit race felt this aura, their faces changed all of a sudden. They could feel an extremely frightening aura that was channeling up into the void.</p><br/><p>\"This is not good! The Shark Ancestor is making a tribute!\"</p><br/><p>\"MOTHERF*CKING HUMAN KING! I'LL HAVE YOU DEAD! EVEN IF THE ENTIRE COLOSSAL SHARK RACE HAS TO PERISH TODAY, I'M GOING TO DRAG YOU DOWN TO HELL WITH US!\"</p><br/><p>\"SACRIFICE THE BLOODLINE OF YOUR ANCESTOR HERE ALONG WITH EVERY SINGLE LIVING BEING ASSOCIATED WITH THIS BLOODLINE!\"</p><br/><p>The Shark Ancestor screamed out. This was quite the tribute he was making here! Using his bloodline as a basis, this meant that he was sacrificing every single being of the Colossal Shark race that had ever existed!</p><br/><p>The amount of power that could be exchanged for this was unusually horrifying.</p><br/><p>\"PLEASE DESCEND FORTH, INVINCIBLE EXISTENCE! I'M WILLING TO SACRIFICE EVERYTHING TO HAVE THIS MOTHERF*CKING HUMAN KING BEFORE ME KILLED!\"</p><br/><p>The eyes of the Shark Ancestor were bloodshot red and were filled with an endless amount of hatred.</p><br/><p>SHING!</p><br/><p>All of a sudden, a bright beam of light descended.</p><br/><p>The Ancient Saint Sacrificial Altar began to tremble.</p><br/><p>'Ding\u2026There is a powerful being sacrificing everything in exchange for an invincible force to be summoned forth. Please arrange and see to it.'</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was stunned. He then shrugged his head. Wasn't this just talking about him\u2026?</p><br/><p>\"Since that's the case, alright then. Let Yours Truly come down upon the world in exchange then.\" Lin Fan accepted it in order to make things difficult.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

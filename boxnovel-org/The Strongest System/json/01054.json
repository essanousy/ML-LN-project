The formidable Sword Will was surging through Long Jinfei\u2019s body and destroying every bit of life within it. This was especially the case for that little bird at his groin which was just swaying along with the wind right now.</p><br/><p>There was a final trace of consciousness left in Long Jinfei by now. His mind was entirely blank save for this thought: he had just been stabbed to death by someone.</p><br/><p>Thud!</p><br/><p>In less than a thousandth of a second, Long Jinfei collapsed onto the ground as his eyes gradually lost the life in them.</p><br/><p>All the surrounding martial artists were completely shocked.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh! Dead! He\u2019s dead!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe is a Grandmaster Candidate of the Kunlun God Sect! To think that he would be stabbed to death! This is going to be a big issue here!\u201d</p><br/><p>When the people who were accompanying Long Jinfei caught sight of this scene, they stood rooted where they were in a daze.</p><br/><p>The man who had gotten into a conflict with Long Jinfei was startled as well, making a run for it immediately. Something big has just happened! He couldn\u2019t linger here any further or he was going to get implicated in it!</p><br/><p>This was especially the case given that Long Jinfei was a Grandmaster Candidate of the Kunlun God Sect! Not only had he just been stabbed to death, he was even lying there stark naked! This was just a wholesome embarrassment for the Kunlun God Sect!</p><br/><p>If the Kunlun God Sect were to catch wind of this, they would definitely go crazy!</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026Congratulations on killing Ancestor Immortal lower level powerful being.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026Experience Points +\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026Obtained Storage Ring.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026Congratulations on obtaining Lower Grade Immortal Weapon, Heavenly Fire God Spear.\u2019</p><br/><p>The rewards were pretty decent. To think that there would even be a Lower Grade Immortal Weapon to be found here! Although, these things did not have much use in Lin Fan\u2019s case.</p><br/><p>Opening the storage ring to peek inside, he found the sight to be truly pretty decent. There were quite a number of pills, and even Lower Grade Immortal Pills were aplenty.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan continued walking forward carefreely. When the surrounding martial artists caught sight of him, all of them dispersed in fear.</p><br/><p>Savage! This was a savage man!</p><br/><p>Lin Fan peered left and right, feeling immensely joyous in his heart. Honestly, the fortune of his life was simply way too good at times! To think that he could bump into a disciple of the Kunlun God Sect in some random city! If this were in the past, he would definitely not have taken that guy\u2019s life. But right now? Hell, everyone from the top to the bottom of the Kunlun God Sect were already trying to do him. So, why should he get all friendly with them? Yours Truly was not afraid of neither the Heavens nor the Earth. If he met them, he\u2019d just f*ck them over. Why should he bother what status they had back in the Kunlun God Sect?</p><br/><p>Taking out a bunch of pills from Long Jinfei\u2019s storage rings, Lin Fan stuffed them all into his mouth and chomped down on them. Yummy and fragrant, there were quite a number of these pills! Seemed like Long Jinfei must have gotten some pretty decent returns from the secret ground.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026Congratulations on consuming Lower Grade Immortal Pill.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026Congratulations on consuming Lower Grade Immortal Pill.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The experience points skyrocketed up furiously. However, it was naturally not as fast when compared to stabbing powerful folks.</p><br/><p>The Grandmaster Candidates of the Kunlun God Sect were simply way too good as kills! Not only that, all of them were especially wealthy! Lin Fan could not agree more that this was yet another way of getting rich.</p><br/><p>He was actually hoping that every sect would sow some seeds of grudge with him so that he could start killing them wantonly. If he could kill all them together in a wave, it would definitely be amazing.</p><br/><p>His mouth was still filled with the lingering fragrance. The taste of Immortal Pills was simply extraordinary!</p><br/><p>At this moment, there was a stall that was selling items to eat. Lin Fan stepped up, wanting to inquire about the price. But, when the boss caught sight of Lin Fan and then the corpse that lay far up behind him, he sprinted off as fast and as far as he could, leaving his stall behind. He could not care about it anymore.</p><br/><p>Everyone nearby knew that this man was a lunatic. To think that he would even dare kill a Grandmaster Candidate of the Kunlun God Sect. This guy was just playing with his life!</p><br/><p>\u201cBoring.\u201d Lin Fan felt that it was probably about time for him to leave this place.</p><br/><p>God knows if those people back at the Kunlun God Sect would know of what was happening here at this place. What should he do if they did know and came rushing over?</p><br/><p>But just at this moment, Lin Fan stopped in his tracks and turned his head around, \u201cWhat are you guys following me for?\u201d</p><br/><p>The bunch of people who had been with Long Jinfei were following behind Lin Fan furtively. It was as though they wanted to know where Lin Fan was headed for so that they could tell on him.</p><br/><p>Those people were stunned as they let out a horrified look on their faces, \u201cN-no! We\u2019re not following you!\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, Lin Fan took out the Heavenly Fire God Spear. A ball of flames burst forth at the tip, causing the entire void to distort.</p><br/><p>When the bunch of people caught sight of this, their entire face turned frightfully pale as they screamed out in fear, \u201cDon\u2019t kill us! Please don\u2019t kill us!\u201d</p><br/><p>In the blink of an eye, those fellas scrammed off as fast as they could without leaving even a single trace.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled out before continuing to walk up front.</p><br/><p>After he took his leave, a few figures walked over from the distance.</p><br/><p>Their leader was a woman wearing a black shawl on her face. Even though her features could not be seen completely, from the general outline of hers, this seemed like a beautiful chick. However, the aura she was emanating was quite frosty, as though she was a witch from the Nine Spirit Hells.</p><br/><p>\u201cGo and check out what\u2019s going on!\u201d The woman spoke up and commanded.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d A burly man who was following behind her nodded his head and headed up before rushing back hurriedly, \u201cMadam! The Grandmaster Candidate of the Kunlun God Sect, Long Jinfei, is up ahead. However, he has been killed by someone and is just lying there naked.\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment the woman heard this, her face changed slightly. Everyone following behind her gave off the same expression.</p><br/><p>Long Jinfei was a Grandmaster Candidate of the Kunlun God Sect, with a cultivation of Ancestor Immortal lower level. He could be considered as a talented genius. But now that he was killed by someone, this was a shock for all of them.</p><br/><p>When the surrounding martial artists caught sight of this woman, they made way as well. It wasn\u2019t because they were afraid of this woman; they were afraid of the token at her waist.</p><br/><p>That purple token which gave off a sinister and cold aura had only four words written on them.</p><br/><p>\u2018Suppressing Demons Heaven Faction.\u2019</p><br/><p>They were from the Suppressing Demons Heaven Faction, which was one of the six major factions, and belonged to a Demonic sect. Their style of doing things was extremely sinister, as they were quick and decisive in killing. Therefore, most people would not dare to mess with them.</p><br/><p>At this moment, the people who were trailing Lin Fan were running away frantically.</p><br/><p>When the woman caught sight of those people, she ordered, \u201cCapture them over and ask them what is happening.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d The burly man nodded his head and spread out his fingers. Instantly, those few figures were sucked over as though their bodies were no longer under their control. This was an extremely tyrannical palm move that could suck over a few Golden Immortal powerful beings just like that. One could imagine just how horrifying this level of strength was.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t kill us! We\u2019re not following you! We\u2019re really not!\u201d The few people shouted out in fear.</p><br/><p>\u201cI know these few people. Golden Immortal Chi Jiao and Golden Immortal Tian Ci\u2026 To think that they would be frightened to such a state.\u201d When the burly man caught sight of these people, his eyes shone with disdain.</p><br/><p>\u201cSpeak! How did Long Jinfei die?\u201d The burly man asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cSomeone killed Long Jinfei!\u201d Golden Immortal Tian Ci replied with a frightfully pale face.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow did he kill Long Jinfei?\u201d The burly man asked once more.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s like this! That man patted on Long Jinfei\u2019s shoulder and he suddenly had a dagger which he used to stab into Long Jinfei\u2019s tummy! Just like that, once, twice, and thrice! He then gave another pat and poof\u2026all of Long Jinfei\u2019s clothes were gone! That man is simply way too horrifying! He knew that Long Jinfei was a Grandmaster Candidate of the Kunlun God Sect, and even then dared to kill him! He must be a lunatic!\u201d Golden Immortal Chi Jiao exclaimed out in horror.</p><br/><p>Out of the nine sects, there wasn\u2019t a single one that was to be trifled with.</p><br/><p>The other party had clearly known of Long Jinfei\u2019s identity, and yet he chose to strike out. He had complete disregard of his own life!</p><br/><p>\u201cInteresting!\u201d The deep eyes of the woman shone with a surprised expression.</p><br/><p>The burly men then looked at these people and hollered, \u201cScram.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cY-Yes\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMadam, I think that man is definitely far from simple. Long Jinfei is an Ancestor Immortal lower level being. For this guy to kill him so easily, his cultivation state is definitely not weak.\u201d The burly man spoke up.</p><br/><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter. We\u2019ll just go take a look.\u201d While the voice of the woman was gentle and soft, there was a cold intent hidden underneath it.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

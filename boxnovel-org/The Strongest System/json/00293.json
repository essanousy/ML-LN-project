Why\u2026why are you here\u2026?\" Xinfeng could not believe his very own eyes. To think that Brother Lin would appear before him at this juncture!</p><br/><p>But how could he have? Like, Glory Sect and Jiuxiao Sect were extremely far apart!</p><br/><p>Descending from the skies, Lin Fan landed beside Xinfeng. Patting his shoulders, he continued, \"As a brother, I\u2019ve been feeling really uneasy lately. I haven\u2019t been able to eat nor sleep. I just had this ominous feeling that something had happened to you, Brother Feng. In order to verify the facts for myself, I made this trip all the way from Glory Sect especially to keep my heart at peace.\"</p><br/><p>\"Brother Lin, I\u2026\" The moment Xinfeng heard this, tears poured down his face. He was touched beyond words. To think that Brother Lin would make such an arduous journey just to ensure his safety!</p><br/><p>\"It\u2019s alright, Brother Feng. Don\u2019t cry. After I regain your court for you, we\u2019ll have a good gathering.\" Lin Fan patted Xinfeng\u2019s shoulders once more.</p><br/><p>The Jiuxiao Sect disciples were shocked when this man descended from the skies. Upon knowing that this man was Lin Fan, they were extremely exhilarated.</p><br/><p>All of them knew about Lin Fan as well! Ever since Big Senior Brother had returned previously, he had mentioned umpteen times about this strongest genius of Glory Sect. Lin Fan was mentioned so much that these disciples had started revering him without even meeting him</p><br/><p>Looking over, he was every single bit as their Big Senior Brother had described.</p><br/><p>Magnanimous and benevolent, righteous and just.</p><br/><p>\"Senior Brother Lin\u2026!\"</p><br/><p>As Lin Fan passed by, these Jiuxiao Sect disciples stepped out of the way, forming a path for him to walk through while greeting him courteously.</p><br/><p>Looking at these disciples, Lin Fan nodded his head and praised, \"You\u2019re all good kids. Don\u2019t worry, your Senior Brother here will help you regain the playing field. Just sit back and relax. Leave it all to your Senior Brother here.\"</p><br/><p>Hearing Lin Fan\u2019s words, the disciples were trembling with gratitude.</p><br/><p>\"Senior Brother, good luck!\"</p><br/><p>\"Senior Brother Lin!\"</p><br/><p>\"Senior Brother Lin will definitely avenge our dead brothers!\"</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>Looking at the man walking towards him, Gu Tianhao shuddered momentarily as well. He could not see through this man\u2019s cultivation base, and his heart clenched for a moment on seeing those disciples who were crushed by the gigantic palm earlier.</p><br/><p>Extremely strong.</p><br/><p>Even though he could not make out this man\u2019s cultivation, that single palm slap was putting a great amount of pressure on Gu Tianhao\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>\"Do you know how grave your sins are?\" Lin Fan asked coldly.</p><br/><p>Gu Tianhao looked at Lin Fan and did not reply. He was contemplating hard in his head. If he weren\u2019t this guy\u2019s match, then he could just make a run for it.</p><br/><p>\"Why, did a cat get your tongue?\" Lin Fan\u2019s face grew even colder at Gu Tianhao\u2019s silence. Flicking his robes, he continued, \"Let me tell you then. You\u2019ve sinned gravely indeed, gravely.\"</p><br/><p>\"How dare you touch a brother of mine? How about you head out and ask around just who the f*ck is Lin Fan?\" Lin Fan barked.</p><br/><p>Upon hearing Lin Fan\u2019s words, Xinfeng was nearly brought to tears once more. This was akin to an elder brother standing up for his younger brother who was bullied!</p><br/><p>All the other Jiuxiao Sect disciples glanced side-eyed at Gu Tianhao as well. Wasn\u2019t he so bloody cocky just moments earlier? What happened to that now, huh?</p><br/><p>Gu Tianhao looked back at these people grimly before asking, \"Who are you?\"</p><br/><p>He could not figure out this mysterious man before him at all, neither his background nor his cultivation base.</p><br/><p>Right at this moment, all the powerful masters of Jiuxiao Sect were headed towards Glory Sect with Grandmaster Han. If he were no match for this guy, then there would be no one left in Jiuxiao Sect to take down this man.</p><br/><p>\"Oh? You don\u2019t even have the rights to know who I am.\" Lin Fan snorted coldly.</p><br/><p>\"Go and die!\" Waving his hand, Gu Tianhao\u2019s aura exploded as he disappeared into the voids, reappearing before Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>\"Die!\" His killing intent was certain as he threw a powerful punch straight at Lin Fan\u2019s chest.</p><br/><p>\"Brother Lin, watch out!\" Xinfeng was shocked at the teleportation.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled contemptuously. Giving Gu Tianhao a tight slap, he roared, \"GET LOST!\"</p><br/><p>BAM!</p><br/><p>Being struck by the Eternal Arm was no joke. No matter how powerful Gu Tianhao was, he was bound to fall right here and then.</p><br/><p>Plop!</p><br/><p>Everyone\u2019s jaws dropped in disbelief. They could not believe their own eyes! With a single slap by Senior Brother Lin, Gu Tianhao collapsed onto the ground with his head entirely bent out of shape.</p><br/><p>How could this be\u2026?</p><br/><p>Xinfeng was shocked at this development as well. He had thought of the multitudes of possibilities that could happen, like a fierce and deadly fight, or something like that. But he had not expected victory to be determined in a split second!</p><br/><p>\"Hmph.\" Snorting coldly, Lin Fan tossed Gu Tianhao\u2019s body into the Heaven and Earth Smelt.</p><br/><p>\"Alright there, done.\" Lin Fan turned around with a bright smile.</p><br/><p>Sobering up, the disciples erupted into a series of cheers.</p><br/><p>\"We won\u2026!\"</p><br/><p>\"That darned b*stard\u2019s finally dead\u2026!\"</p><br/><p>Looking at these elated disciples, Lin Fan smiled as well. Turning towards Xinfeng, he continued, \"That\u2019s right, where\u2019s the Grandmaster?\"</p><br/><p>As though he had suddenly recalled something, Xinfeng replied hurriedly, \"Oh crap! The Grandmaster\u2019s headed towards Glory Sect!\"</p><br/><p>\"What?!?\" Lin Fan\u2019s face of glee slowly turned into one of disbelief. \"You mean to say that Grandmaster Han\u2019s going to Glory Sect?!?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes, I\u2019ve heard it from my Junior Brother. The info shouldn\u2019t be wrong.\"</p><br/><p>\"Senior Brother Lin, Big Senior Brother Xinfeng, it\u2019s true! The Grandmaster gathered everyone two days ago and headed towards Glory Sect!\" A disciple stepped forth.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan frowned. He truly had an ominous feeling now.</p><br/><p>He wasn\u2019t afraid of Grandmaster Han clashing head-on with Glory Sect. He was afraid that Grandmaster Han might resort to some underhanded or dirty tricks.</p><br/><p>\"Brother Feng, I don\u2019t think I have time for a gathering anymore. I\u2019ve got to hurry back to Glory Sect.\" Lin Fan replied anxiously.</p><br/><p>\"Brother Lin, calm down first. We\u2019ve got to think up of a plan! Grandmaster Han and the others are of greater celestial full cultivation and can traverse through the voids and the skies. There\u2019s no way we can catch up with their speed just like this!\"</p><br/><p>Xinfeng\u2019s words were like cold water being poured right on Lin Fan\u2019s head right now.</p><br/><p>That was right. How could he make it in time?</p><br/><p>Jiuxiao Sect was so far apart from Glory Sect! Even though his fighting strength was incomparable right now, his cultivation base was only at a lesser celestial! There was no way he could catch up with them in traversing speed!</p><br/><p>F*ck man!</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was thoroughly enraged by now. Why did things like these have to keep happening to him!</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026congratulations on smelting 5 energy grid line chains.\u2019</p><br/><p>The Heaven and Earth Smelt was done with its work, but Lin Fan did not have the energy to be bothered with it.</p><br/><p>Eh?</p><br/><p>That was right\u2026</p><br/><p>A thought suddenly struck Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>\"Brother Feng, sorry to let you down. But your Master\u2019s body, I\u2019ve got to be selfish just this once.\" Lin Fan thought to himself regrettably.</p><br/><p>He then tossed Liang Yichu\u2019s corpse within the Heaven and Earth Smelt as well.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026congratulations on smelting 10 energy grid line chains.\u2019</p><br/><p>\"Brother Feng, we\u2019ll leave in a bit. I\u2019ve got a plan.\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes.\" Xinfeng nodded in agreement, though he did not know what Lin Fan had come up with. Even if they were to take the gigantic ark, they\u2019d require 10-14 days to arrive at Glory Sect.</p><br/><p>Unless he was able to rip through the void and travel through it\u2026 But was that even possible?</p><br/><p>Translator's Thoughts</p><br/><p>Lam Lam</p><br/><p>Oh no Liang Yichu :(</p><br/><p>But seriously, the story got me laughing at the start when Lin Fan came with all the oh I\u2019ve been thinking about you all these while. But suddenly it took yet another sharp turn gosh. Please don\u2019t let Saint Devil Sect repeat itself. Though I doubt it would with Lin Fan being so strong right now!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

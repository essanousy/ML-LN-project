Even after being stowed away for 10,000 years, there is no sign of it rotting at all.\" He Yuhan showed no signs of shock. She was calm as though she\u2019d seen all of these before.</p><br/><p>Standing behind her, those disciples who had long gotten their fill of the treasures were completely rooted.</p><br/><p>Even though half of the head were still buried in the ground, just the half that was revealed was more than chilling enough. The purple eye of the demon\u2019s head that was above the ground was even more sinister-looking.</p><br/><p>\"Yuhan, let\u2019s go, eh? I don\u2019t feel really comfortable about this.\" Xia Youtian lowered his head gently, not daring to make direct eye contact with the purple eye. Just a single look was enough to send shivers down his spine.</p><br/><p>\"Senior Sister, how about us leaving first? We\u2019ve already had more than enough treasures!\" Some of the disciples behind her called out.</p><br/><p>Completely disregarding these disciples, He Yuhan looked at Xia Youtian and continued, \"Trust me, Brother Xia. This is really important for you.\"</p><br/><p>\"Even though the ancient demons and demon royalty were destroyed through the rivers of time, this big demon had remained intact all this while. This Demon God Bloodline will ensure that you become an unparalleled existence. This world requires your powers as a shield.\" He Yuhan continued.</p><br/><p>\"Yuhan, I\u2019ve got no idea what you\u2019re talking about. But how about let\u2019s leave this place? The feeling that this place gives off is really repressing.\" Standing beside the gigantic head, Xia Youtian\u2019s face was a little pale. This aura caused him to feel really uneasy. The same went for his junior brothers. But for some unknown reason, He Yuhan was unnaturally chill.</p><br/><p>Shaking her head, He Yuhan placed her palm on the head which did not rot after 10,000 years. Gently closing her eyes, her palms gave off a warm glow.</p><br/><p>An unknown power surged through the layer of void and descended upon He Yuhan\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>\u2018Concentrate!\u2019</p><br/><p>Suddenly, a drop of purple blood with a tinge of black floated gently upon He Yuhan\u2019s palms.</p><br/><p>\"Look, Brother Xia! This is the Demon God Essence Blood! Once you swallow this, you will possess the Demon God Bloodline!\" She said while looking at Xia Youtian.</p><br/><p>\"This\u2026\" Looking at the drop of blood floating gently above Yuhan\u2019s palms, his face changed. There seemed to be a berserk consciousness that was lying within the blood.</p><br/><p>Looking at this drop of blood, He Yuhan let out a grin. With a flick of her finger, the black impurities were separated out from the blood. As if they had a life of their own, they flew towards the disciples and fused with them.</p><br/><p>The negative emotions of the big demon had now been removed by He Yuhan. In a blink of an eye, she reappeared before Xia Youtian and knocked him out cold.</p><br/><p>\"What are you doing, Senior Sister?\" Looking at their Senior Sister causing their Senior Brother to faint, these disciples asked in bewilderment.</p><br/><p>\"Oh. If I kill you guys before him, that will cause unnecessary misunderstandings.\" She replied calmly.</p><br/><p>\"What do you mean, Senior Sister?!\" All of their faces turned pale with shock. However, all of them suddenly collapsed onto the ground, writhing around as though something was about to break out from their bodies.</p><br/><p>\"The Big Ancient Demon has conquered countless battles and had an unparalleled killing intent. Therefore, the negative emotions that he possessed were simply way too much. The reason why I brought you guys in here is so that I can find a home for these negative emotions.\" He Yuhan continued coldly.</p><br/><p>\"Senior Sister, you\u2026!\" The disciples were in disbelief.</p><br/><p>\"But, don\u2019t blame me as well. I didn\u2019t force any of you guys to come. All of this was fated by the Heavens.\" He Yuhan had zero emotions at all. With a flick of her finger, the essence blood then bounced into Xia Youtian\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>\"Ah\u2026Senior Sister, you\u2026!\"</p><br/><p>Before these disciples could even finish, a black mist exploded out as pitch-black bone-like spikes protruded out of all of their bodies.</p><br/><p>\"It\u2019s time to send you guys on your way. If I let you carry on, you\u2019ll bring harm upon this world.\" Without hesitation, He Yuhan slashed down on all these disciples who had just turned into monsters cleanly.</p><br/><p>BOOM!</p><br/><p>Suddenly, a shock rippled through the ground. He Yuhan\u2019s face changed.</p><br/><p>\"Seems like you haven\u2019t frozen up with death. In fact, you have even reborn through it? You\u2019re not called the big ancient demon for nothing indeed. Seems like you\u2019ve planned all of this. Even I was tricked by you.\" He Yuhan looked at the half head that was protruding out of the ground. Right now, the purple eye was flashing with a sinister light.</p><br/><p>\"But 10,000 years have already passed. Since you have already fallen, then you should just obediently continue as such. Don\u2019t think about coming out then.\" He Yuhan\u2019s face changed again as two rainbow beams burst out of her palms, trying to suppress the big ancient demon.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, a bright burst of light shot out from the purple eye, destroying the rainbow beams entirely.</p><br/><p>He Yuhan stumbled back a few steps with a look of disbelief, \"How could that be?\"</p><br/><p>\"Oh, you can\u2019t even save yourself now, and you\u2019re thinking about suppressing me? Know your place, fool.\" Suddenly, a loud voice boomed out across the void. The Ancient Demon Grounds began to shake as the ground caved in, collapsing the nearby structures.</p><br/><p>He Yuhan stood there undecided. Eventually, she caught hold of Xia Youtian and ripped through the void, escaping out of this place.</p><br/><p>The head that was buried in the ground extended out continuously. Eventually, a gigantic head appeared, looking down upon the rest of the world in disdain.</p><br/><p>\u2018GRAWRH\u2026!\u2019</p><br/><p>The big ancient demon growled loudly. Opening his big mouth, the putrid aura in the vicinity were vacuumed by a strong invisible force within it.</p><br/><p>The monsters that were roaming the Ancient Demon Grounds shrieked sharply before turning into a putrid aura, and were sucked into the big demon altogether.</p><br/><p>\"What\u2019s happening? What\u2019s going on with this place?\" Some of the disciples who were training at the place looked astounded as they felt the vibrations, wondering what was happening.</p><br/><p>\"Ah, don\u2019t kill me\u2026!\" A disciple who was defeated by a monster was now covering his head and cowering while screaming out in fear. But as he opened his eyes gently, he found the monster turning into the putrid aura and floating towards the distance.</p><br/><p>Disciples of the sect who were outside the Ancient Demon Grounds right now were pale with fright.</p><br/><p>The putrid aura of the forbidden grounds seemed to be decreasing rapidly. At the same time, there seemed to be a vortex that was sucking in this aura from the center of the place.</p><br/><p>\"Elder, what\u2019s happening? There are still disciples within there!\"</p><br/><p>\"Well, if you\u2019re asking me, then who should I ask? The Ancient Demon Grounds has existed for a really long time, but nothing like this has ever happened before.\"</p><br/><p>\"Then what should we do!\"</p><br/><p>The Elders of the sect were in a flurry of nerves right now. They did not know what sort of scary thing was happening within there right now.</p><br/><p>\"You guys hurry up and leave. The Big Ancient Demon within has revived! The only chance we have at killing that thing is if we gather all of Dongling Continent\u2019s strongest powerhouses!\" Dragging Xia Youtian along with her, He Yuhan suddenly appeared in the sky and passed on this warning to the people below.</p><br/><p>\"Xia Youtian, He Yuhan\u2026 How are you guys\u2026\" The Elders of the sect looked at these two in shock. Weren\u2019t these two disciples inside as well just now? And both of them are just lesser celestial beings. How could they have the power to rip through the void?!</p><br/><p>\"Hurry up and leave if you do not want to waste your life here. This Big Ancient Demon is not something you guys can handle.\" Looking at the distance, He Yuhan\u2019s face was grim. She then disappeared into the void once more, not wanting to stay here any longer.</p><br/><p>\"Elder, how did those two disciples\u2026?\"</p><br/><p>\"Nevermind that now. Let\u2019s just leave first!\"</p><br/><p>\"But what about the disciples within?\"</p><br/><p>\"What else can we do? Do we look like the Big Ancient Demon\u2019s match? To think that the rumors were real all along\u2026!\"</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>Seven Saint\u2019s Secret Chamber\u2026</p><br/><p>The moment the Big Ancient Demon was revived, Lin Fan felt this maniacal aura bursting out.</p><br/><p>This was a shocking aura to withstand.</p><br/><p>Bloody hell, why was it that there were bloody perverted f*cks everywhere Yours Truly appeared at?!</p><br/><p>\"Chicky, don\u2019t play anymore! Time to come back!\" With a wave of his hand, he kept both Chicky and the black dog in his storage.</p><br/><p>\"This aura is far from normal\u2026Even Yours Truly may not be able to deal with that\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Translator's Thoughts</p><br/><p>Lam Lam</p><br/><p>Wow, plot hype! Anyways, here\u2019s the author\u2019s actual comments: \u2018Well, you guys should know who this character, He Yuhan is, so I wont explain about her any further. But lets just say that Xuanhuang World is just a starting point.\u2019</p><br/><p>Wow. That comment though. Do we have any idea who she is? You guys, any clues?!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

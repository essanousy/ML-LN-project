The scoundrel still got away! That mysterious arm seems pretty strong indeed. I wonder where it came from.\" Lin Fan kept the Eternal Donger back in his storage.</p><br/><p>The Eternal Donger was an incredible item indeed. Coupled with the True Origins Crushing Kick and Biggras, it was definitely formidable. A pity that it looked like that though.</p><br/><p>Boom! Boom!</p><br/><p>The mysterious arm which was pierced apart seemed to have some lifeforce remaining as it slammed against the ground furiously.</p><br/><p>Immediately, Lin Fan tossed the arm into the Heaven and Earth Smelt to let it proceed with smelting.</p><br/><p>That person chosen by Heaven\u2019s Will.</p><br/><p>Heavens.</p><br/><p>These two bloody fellas were mysterious indeed.</p><br/><p>An existence which the Eternal Arm could not even break through... That was pretty scary indeed. But what Lin Fan could not figure out was why this person would not come down to face him if he were this strong. If he had revealed his true self, perhaps Lin Fan might not even be a match for him.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026congratulations on smelting (Fake) Arm of Heaven\u2019s Will\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026congratulations on obtaining a strand of Consciousness of Heaven\u2019s Will\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Consciousness of Heaven\u2019s Will: A strain of consciousness from Xuanhuang World\u2019s Heaven\u2019s Will. Consumable.\u2019</p><br/><p>The moment Lin Fan heard the smelting results, he was befuddled. What in the world were these?! Looking at the beautiful colors that were emitting within the Heaven and Earth Smelt, Lin Fan was overwhelmed with joy.</p><br/><p>But what was this Consciousness of Heaven\u2019s Will?</p><br/><p>Was that fella just now truly Heaven\u2019s Will?</p><br/><p>But wait a minute. (Fake) Arm of Heaven\u2019s Will?! There must be something more that he didn\u2019t know about this.</p><br/><p>\"Boss\u2026\" Looking at their Boss standing there silently, Sha Dulong and the others wanted to ask him just what was going on.</p><br/><p>\"Hush. Wait.\" Lin Fan raised his hand to stop them. His mind was still filled with questions right now. He couldn\u2019t really rest until he could figure them out.</p><br/><p>\u2018Consume.\u2019 After hesitating for a moment, Lin Fan consumed that strain of consciousness. Lin Fan wasn\u2019t worried nor afraid of anything that came from his Heaven and Earth Smelt.</p><br/><p>Instantaneously, that strain of rainbow colored light flew into Lin Fan\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Lin Fan\u2019s body shuddered as an inexplicable feeling surged through his mind.</p><br/><p>It was as if he were flying up in the skies. This was a wondrous feeling.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan could vaguely feel the existence of another underworld of some sorts within his mind. Perhaps the link wasn\u2019t that strong because this was just a single strain of consciousness.</p><br/><p>But suddenly, a feeble voice appeared within Lin Fan\u2019s mind.</p><br/><p>\u2018Save me\u2026save me\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shook his head a few times. It was as though he was hallucinating.</p><br/><p>Who was asking him for help?</p><br/><p>\u2018Who are you?\u2019 Following the feeling, Lin Fan asked.</p><br/><p>\u2018Save me\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Shit you. Who are you? Save your mother. Could you give me some hints!\u2019 Lin Fan shouted in his mind.</p><br/><p>What the hell was going on? Without a single hint, how did it expect Yours Truly to save you from anything?</p><br/><p>BOOM!</p><br/><p>Suddenly, a massive thunderbolt exploded within Lin Fan\u2019s mind.</p><br/><p>That chaotic nothingness gradually brightened up. Lin Fan seemed to be in a third person point of view right now.</p><br/><p>Within the void that was split open, a shadow caused Lin Fan\u2019s heart to skip a beat. That was the Supreme Being who had eventually fallen after splitting the entire Xuanhuang World into two!</p><br/><p>But even more mysteriously, there was someone who was standing opposite the Supreme Being.</p><br/><p>Who in the world was that?</p><br/><p>Not only was the Xuanhuang World split into two, but even the Heaven\u2019s Will between Xuanhuang World was also split into two.</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>Not long after, Lin Fan shrugged his head and sobered up. His face was filled with bewilderment. What in the world had just happened? He couldn\u2019t get anything at all.</p><br/><p>His mind was in a state of chaos as well. He could make nothing out of just the image he saw in his mind.</p><br/><p>Who was the good guy? Who was the bad guy?</p><br/><p>Forget it. He would let it be for now. He better focus on himself first.</p><br/><p>\u2018Build a wall if the soldiers come, build a dam if the flood comes.\u2019 Things that he couldn\u2019t understand for now, he would just leave it for later.</p><br/><p>Now that the strand of Consciousness of Heaven\u2019s Will was absorbed by Lin Fan, his sensitivity towards the energy grid lines of Heaven and Earth was only going to grow from now on.</p><br/><p>Seemed like he still gained something out of this battle after all.</p><br/><p>Not only did he whack that wolf in sheepskin into submission, he even took that mysterious arm. Not a bad trade after all.</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>Within a patch of void\u2026</p><br/><p>Chen Xuan stood there stark naked, his face malevolent. The hatred in his heart was reaching its limit by now.</p><br/><p>In front of Chen Xuan was a chaotic swirl of a shadow. It looked like a liquid that was distorting itself non-stop, where a figure laid within.</p><br/><p>\"DIDN\u2019T YOU SAY THAT I WAS CHOSEN BY THE HEAVEN\u2019S WILL? WHY WAS I HUMILIATED TO SUCH AN EXTENT BY A MERE ANT?\" Chen Xuan shouted in anger towards this chaotic shadow.</p><br/><p>\"RIGHT?! 100 YEARS AGO, YOU TOLD ME THAT I WAS CHOSEN BY THE HEAVEN\u2019S WILL AND THAT I WOULD COURSE THROUGH THIS LIFE WITH EASE! BUT WHAT HAPPENED NOW?\"</p><br/><p>\"DIDN\u2019T YOU SAY THAT YOU\u2019RE THE HEAVEN\u2019S WILL? AND YOU COULDN\u2019T EVEN TAKE DOWN THAT PUNY HUMAN?!\"</p><br/><p>Chen Xuan was like a demon right now as he howled at the chaotic shadow wildly.</p><br/><p>\"INSOLENT.\" Suddenly, the figure within the chaotic shadow lashed out in anger. Streaks of lightning bolted out across the chaotic shadow.</p><br/><p>But in a moment, it regained its composure.</p><br/><p>\"When demons descend upon this world, you shall still be the Messiah that was chosen by Heaven\u2019s Will. Are you unable to even tread across this small setback before your path right now?\"</p><br/><p>Chen Xuan had finally calmed down. Perhaps he had vented everything he needed to with that outburst. But at the moment, he was just filled with fear towards the figure in this chaotic shadow.</p><br/><p>The chaotic shadow looked at Chen Xuan and said gently, \u2018Don\u2019t worry. You ARE chosen by Heaven\u2019s Will. Naturally, you would live life with ease. Once you take down these demons in my place, you will become the highest being in this entire world.\"</p><br/><p>Chen Xuan\u2019s body shuddered momentarily at these words. He then looked towards the chaotic shadow with gleaming eyes.</p><br/><p>\"Just as you\u2019ve witnessed yourself. I\u2019m about to exorcise the demon. The demon which humiliated you shall fall before your hands as well.\" The chaotic shadows reassured Chen Xuan.</p><br/><p>\"What should I do?\" Chen Xuan asked.</p><br/><p>\"Find me the Supreme Being Token Shards and bring them to me.\"</p><br/><p>\"But, that man\u2026\" Chen Xuan was still harboring hatred towards the man who had humiliated him. At the same time, he was filled with fear. What should he do if he bumped into that man once more?</p><br/><p>\"Doesn\u2019t matter. He will be your stepping stone at the end of the day. I\u2019ll send you to the Nine Spirits Realm now for you to look for the remaining token shards.\" With an arm, the figure within the chaotic shadow ripped apart the void to reveal a gap that seemed to lead to another world.</p><br/><p>Gripping his fists tightly, Chen Xuan entered the void and left the place.</p><br/><p>The moment Chen Xuan left, the figure within the chaotic shadow howled into the skies.</p><br/><p>\"B*STARD! ONCE I DEVOUR THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF DONGLING CONTINENT, I SHALL MAKE SURE YOU DIE A HORRIBLE DEATH!\"</p><br/><p>\"Consciousness, I know that you\u2019ve sought help from that human. But what can he do? You shall belong to me eventually.\"</p><br/><p>\"HAHA\u2026!\"</p><br/><p>Within the chaotic shadow, a rainbow colored light seemed to be shrinking ever smaller under the surrounding darkness.</p><br/><p>\"Looking down on the Heavens and Earth, you\u2019re intolerable.\" The consciousness of Dongling Continent which was slowly being devoured sent out a feeble voice.</p><br/><p>\"HAHA! You\u2019re the Heaven and Earth, but what can you do to me? My plan of 10,000 years is finally coming to fruition. You will be replaced by me entirely!\"</p><br/><p>\"Consciousness, give it up. Your ideology is wrong. Mankind needs to defy against the will of the Heavens, just like He did.\"</p><br/><p>\"No, He was right. You\u2019re the one who\u2019s misunderstanding things\u2026\" The feeble voice of Dongling Continent\u2019s consciousness replied.</p><br/><p>\"Stubborn after all this time\u2026\"</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>Translator's Thoughts</p><br/><p>Lam Lam</p><br/><p>Wow. The plot is really getting thicker and deeper. If some of you are confused by Heaven\u2019s Will, or the Consciousness aspect, don\u2019t worry, it IS confusing. In this case, they seem to have taken Heaven\u2019s Will as a living thing that is embodied by a singular being. As for the Consciousness aspect, I guess you can kind of see it as a form of energy that is the spirit and energy of the world. It\u2019s a really spiritual way of looking at things. So a powerful being can send down a strain of their consciousness that's disaparate from their entire self. Hopefully that makes sense!</p><br/><p>Also, the portion of the speech which the chaotic shadow said to Chen Xuan about a demon humiliating him. I\u2019m not sure whether it refers to Lin Fan or an actual demon itself. That portion is not clarified. So we can only wait and see. Hope this clarifies things up! Cheers!</p><br/><p>6. Surprise!

So, have a Happy 2018!</p><br/><p>Also, I would like to let you guys know that I may not be able to like and comment on your comments so much for the next few days because I'll have festivities to celebrate and houses to visit since I'll be celebrating my CNY as well!

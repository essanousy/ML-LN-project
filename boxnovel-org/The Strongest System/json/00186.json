Zhang Ergou is your Big Senior Brother, but he seems to be in a daze recently. Not eating well, not sleeping well, not focusing\u2026 While these are small issues, they would gradually become big issues over time. Hence, the purpose of gathering you guys here is to inform you all about one thing.\"</p><br/><p>\"The only way to help your Big Senior Brother recover from this state, the only way to change this stalemate\u2026 That is, he needs to win over the world with his grace and demeanor, since he obviously can\u2019t do so with his face.\" Lin Fan whispered to his captive audience.</p><br/><p>Mie Qiongqi, Tian Yu, and Feng Bujue nodded in agreement. They were all clear in their hearts that this was no small matter.</p><br/><p>They were all clear of Senior Brother Zhang\u2019s conditions. Even though he seemed normal on a day to day basis, from time to time, they would find him in an occasional daze, spacing out to the skies.</p><br/><p>Even though neither of them had been rejected by a girl before, they could feel and empathize with the pain just by looking at Zhang Ergou.</p><br/><p>\"Well, what do you propose we do then, Master?\" Tianyu asked.</p><br/><p>\"Yes, that\u2019s my intentions of gathering you guys here today: to discuss this issue in depth. Firstly, I would like all of you to brainstorm for any good ideas for your Senior Brother to have an overhaul in person. And then, we\u2019ll talk about it and think about the best way to go about it.\" Even though Lin Fan was full of quirky ideas, he was quite at a loss for what to do regarding this situation.</p><br/><p>If Zhang Ergou were not his Big Disciple, he would not have given a dog sh*t about this.</p><br/><p>Feng Bujue looked at his master, \"First, for Senior Brother Zhang to change, we must first understand what sort of a person he is.\"</p><br/><p>\"Then what sort of a person is he, Senior Brother Feng?\" Tianyu asked curiously.</p><br/><p>Feng Bujue hesitated, \"You guys promise not to rat on me?\"</p><br/><p>\"Of course! Relax! This concerns Senior Brother Zhang\u2019s life as a whole! Besides, do we look like snitches to you?\" Tianyu continued.</p><br/><p>\"Alright fine then. For Big Senior Brother, his good point is that he has too many bad points to speak of. Firstly, he\u2019s ugly. I\u2019m sure everyone knows this in their heart. Especially those bead-like eyes of his and that weird face shape\u2026 I, Feng Bujue, swear to god that he\u2019s the ugliest person I\u2019ve ever met in my life.\" Feng Bujue continued without hesitation.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan stared at Feng Bujue, stunned. He then stared at the door entrance before turning back his gaze onto Feng Bujue\u2019s report.</p><br/><p>\"Furthermore, Big Senior Brother\u2019s character is simply dodgy. It\u2019s not just plain dodgy, he\u2019s extremely dodgy. If he weren\u2019t my Big Senior Brother, I wouldn\u2019t want to be near someone like him.\u2019</p><br/><p>\"And yes, timid. Extremely lustful yet timid.\"</p><br/><p>\"Based on these observations of mine, if Big Senior Brother were not to change over, then it would be impossible for him to not remain single.\"</p><br/><p>Everyone nodded in constant agreement to Feng Bujue\u2019s criticisms of Zhang Ergou. Their expressions changed slightly as well, and their only hope was that things would not get too bad later on.</p><br/><p>Especially Lin Fan, he was the one whose jaw was the most agape. These words had surpassed Lin Fan\u2019s expectations, and he was in some disbelief.</p><br/><p>\"So, what do you guys think about what I\u2019ve said?\" Feng Bujue asked.</p><br/><p>\"Wonderful\u2026\" Lin Fan took a deep breath and nodded his head while looking at Feng Bujue. He was starting to pity this guy.</p><br/><p>\"It\u2019s actually nothing much. Just my common observation. But you guys must swear not to let this leak out.\" Feng Bujue said embarrassedly.</p><br/><p>And just then, the door sprang right open. When Feng Bujue saw who it was, he was scared shitless.</p><br/><p>\"If you don\u2019t want others to find out, then it\u2019d be best if you didn\u2019t do it in the first place. Well done, Feng Bujue, well done. Your Senior Brother, I, have treated you always pretty decently, to think that you\u2019d talk about me as though I wasn\u2019t worth a single crap. Seems like if I do not exert some authority as a Senior Brother, you\u2019d only get more out of hand from now on!\u2019 Zhang Ergou stood at the doorway, his chest puffing up and down heavily.</p><br/><p>He was entirely enraged by this point. If his great Master had not pulled him aside in the morning and told him about this matter, he would not have dared to believe such a thing.</p><br/><p>Listening to everything from outside the house, listening to his very own Junior Brother talking as though he was worth nothing, goodness! How could he tolerate this?</p><br/><p>Thinking back to his master\u2019s words, his master was right after all.</p><br/><p>\"Ah, Ergou. You\u2019re now the big disciple of Saint Devil Sect. If you do not show some authority as a Big Disciple, then how would you expect the others to submit to you?\"</p><br/><p>Initially, Zhang Ergou had still thought that how could his Junior Brothers not submit to him? After all, he was pretty nice to them. But after hearing Feng Bujue\u2019s words, he agreed with his master. After all, if even his closest Junior Brother would not submit to him, he could give up hope for anyone else.</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>Feng Bujue was totally stumped. Looking at his incensed Senior Brother, his small little heart started thumping furiously as he slowly retreated backward.</p><br/><p>\"Senior Brother! Don\u2019t get angry! No no. It\u2019s all a misunderstanding! Misunderstanding!\" Feng Bujue was on the brink of tears. What was happening? Why would his Senior Brother be eavesdropping outside!</p><br/><p>\"Misunderstanding your head! If I don\u2019t tear off your skin layer by layer today, then I\u2019ll no longer be your Senior Brother!\" Zhang Ergou took out a heavy club and swung it towards Feng Bujue\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>\"Ah! Senior Brother! I was wrong! I\u2019m wrong! It\u2019s really a misunderstanding! Save me, master!\" Feng Bujue ran off outside as Zhang Ergou gave chase.</p><br/><p>Curses, swearing and shouts rang through the entire Nameless Peak.</p><br/><p>Looking at the pitch black night with those two figures running off, Lin Fan eventually closed the doors. He then turned around to the remaining 2, \"Alright, Plan A has succeeded. Let\u2019s continue discussing the follow-up.\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes, Master.\" Mie Qiongqi and Tian Yu nodded their heads.</p><br/><p>To Lin Fan, Feng Bujue was the best man to execute out Plan A.</p><br/><p>First and foremost, even though Feng Bujue\u2019s cultivation base was higher than Zhang Ergou, he would definitely not dare to throw any punches back at Zhang Ergou to retaliate. If it were Mie Qiongqi, who knew when he might lose control and kill Zhang Ergou with a single slap.</p><br/><p>And of course, this wasn\u2019t suitable for Tianyu either. Even though Tianyu had been on Nameless Peak for quite some time, it was entirely not in his character to say that speech above.</p><br/><p>Therefore, Feng Bujue was the only one who could suffer this ordeal.</p><br/><p>The remaining three dug their heads deep in discussions to see how they could perfect the plans. At this point, Tianyu was somewhat distracted with a tinge of hurt in his heart.</p><br/><p>Could it be that him remaining at Nameless Peak was just part of a plan as well?</p><br/><p>But forget it. Since he was already here, what was the use of thinking so much about it?</p><br/><p>For the residents of Nameless Peak, this was going to be a sleepless night.</p><br/><p>Cai Zhiqiao was stirred awake by the commotion. Sprawling by her window and rubbing her big, bright eyes awake, she stared at the two people playing catch in the darkness like a movie.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

He just had to see where this Fire Water Empress was going to take him to.</p><br/><p>However, the thing that had him curious was the methods used by the Fire Water Empress, which were somewhat different. Just the way she was traveling across the void was different from how Lin Fan did it usually.</p><br/><p>It was as though she was just gliding through the long rivers of time.</p><br/><p>In the blink of an eye, the scenery before him changed.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis place\u2026\u201d When Lin Fan caught sight of everything before him, his expression changed slightly. To think that in a single blink of an eye, they had arrived at the Imperial Palace of the Fire Water Empress. Wasn\u2019t this too damned bloody fast?</p><br/><p>Lin Fan knew where the Imperial Palace of the Fire Water Empress was. This was 108,000 miles away from where he was, and required them to cross a decent number of worlds! Yet, to think that he would arrive here in the blink of an eye. This was pretty tyrannical indeed!</p><br/><p>When he caught sight of the maids before him, Lin Fan merely grinned. They could be considered as acquaintances now.</p><br/><p>And, when those maids looked at Lin Fan, their eyes shone with a look of respect. They knew that this man was the Exclusive Property of the Empress, and therefore, they naturally did not dare to dilly dally.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome along with Your Empress.\u201d The tone of the Fire Water Empress was unquestionable, but Lin Fan did not say anything. He was used to this by now.</p><br/><p>Following the Fire Water Empress, he came into a luxurious house. There was an exceptionally eye-catching gigantic bed in the middle.</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan saw the Fire Water Empress who was standing there without making a single sound, he consciously walked to the side of the bed. He then slowly stripped off his clothes and laid down on the bed.</p><br/><p>\u2018Hais! What must happen, must happen. One can never avoid fate. But, since I can\u2019t avoid it, I might as well just enjoy it.\u2019</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shut his eyes and said out, \u201cCome on then. I\u2019m all prepared now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d At this moment, the Fire Water Empress, who was just standing there, frowned. Her tone wasn\u2019t all that friendly.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you mean to f*ck me?\u201d Lin Fan opened his eyes and asked in bewilderment.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph! Since when did Your Empress say that she was going to pamper you?\u201d The Fire Water Empress scolded out harshly.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Say so earlier man! That gave me quite the scare!\u201d Lin Fan stood up hurriedly and wore his clothes, \u201cThen, what are we here for?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Empress had wanted to tell you that the place I\u2019m taking you to this time around is a secret ground where only the absolute powerful beings can enter. This is also the most mysterious place in this entire world. When we\u2019re there, you had better not create any trouble. Otherwise, even if it\u2019s Your Empress, I might not be able to guarantee your safety.\u201d The Fire Water Empress spoke strictly. However, she could not hide that trace of worry within her eyes.</p><br/><p>It was not as though the Fire Water Empress still did not know what this guy was like, right? However, this secret ground was a place which no one else would find out about unless they were utmost powerful beings.</p><br/><p>Initially, she had thought of not informing this fella. But on second thought, she decided to do it still. Since this man already had something going on with her, she could not bear to not let him know of this.</p><br/><p>However, what the Fire Water Empress did not know was that even if she did not inform him, the Great Sage and the Demonic God Pangu would also try their best to let him know. But, whether or not they could find Lin Fan was another issue altogether.</p><br/><p>\u201cI never ever create any trouble. Furthermore, I\u2019m no weakling myself. Even if those utmost powerful beings want to kill me, that would depend on whether they have the capabilities to do so.\u201d Lin Fan said out in indignance.</p><br/><p>Your Father was a god damned bloody manly man! It was not as though he would need the protection of a b*tch!</p><br/><p>This girl was just belittling him!</p><br/><p>\u201cThat had better be the case then.\u201d The long, beautiful lashes of the Fire Water Empress moved nimbly, \u201cRemember now, the secret ground is fraught with dangers. Even those utmost powerful beings would not dare to be careless within it. Even though your strength is pretty decent, you still have to watch out within this secret ground.\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, Lin Fan suddenly came to the realization that this Fire Water Empress seemed to be caring for him quite a bit. Could this be the legendary \u2019emotions blossoming with time\u2019? And, when he came to think about it, there WAS the possibility of that as well.</p><br/><p>After all, the previous encounter was one that lasted for a few years straight. There must definitely be some feelings blossoming from that.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, Little Water\u2026 I\u2019d say, you can\u2019t be developing feelings for me, can you?\u201d Lin Fan asked softly. However, the moment the words came out of his mouth, the Fire Water Empress flew into a rage.</p><br/><p>\u201cOuch, ouch! Don\u2019t start getting physical now! Alright, fine! Fine! I\u2019m not going to spout any more nonsense! No more!\u201d Lin Fan waved it off with his hand hurriedly. Didn\u2019t he just make a joke? Did she have to get physical over it?</p><br/><p>Really now! Some people just didn\u2019t have a sense of humor! How boring!</p><br/><p>However, the mention of this secret ground by the Fire Water Empress did have Lin Fan feeling excited beyond anything else. He truly did not know what sort of a place this would be for even the Fire Water Empress to turn so serious.</p><br/><p>The Fire Water Empress was an utmost powerful being! Not only that, her strength was extremely sick. But, if even SHE felt that this was dangerous, could this be some sort of Hell on Earth?</p><br/><p>At this moment, Lin Fan\u2019s heart was filled with anticipation. He truly did not know what sort of treasures would lie within this secret ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll come and fetch you three days later.\u201d After the Fire Water Empress said these words, she dove into the void and left the place.</p><br/><p>\u201cActing all mysterious and all.\u201d Lin Fan pursed his lips. By habit, he then observed everything in the Xuanhuang World from a God\u2019s point of view. The development of the Xuanhuang World was progressing really smoothly, and there weren\u2019t any huge problems.</p><br/><p>The Devil\u2019s Incarnate, Wang Xiaoming, had not let down on Lin Fan\u2019s efforts on him. He was doing tremendously well in there, and by now, he was already a Divine celestial level 10, Eternal God state being.</p><br/><p>As for all of the other Destined Children, they were doing pretty decent as well. Under the whipping of Wang Xiaoming, they had no choice but to progress and improve.</p><br/><p>Wang Xiaoming would basically take the initiative to harass these Destined Childs every month and cause a blistering headache for all of these Destined Children. They would then break down and yell in indignation, then enter a state of cultivating.</p><br/><p>Those two disciples of his, Zhiqiao and Jiuling, were working hard at cultivating as well. Their cultivation states were pretty decent; they were just short of an opportunity right now from reaching the Divine celestial level 10.</p><br/><p>But, the one who had Lin Fan surprised the most was Mie Qiongqi. He had been hiding in seclusion the entire time, and to think that his cultivation state would reach the Supreme state lower level!</p><br/><p>Perhaps, Mie Qiongqi was the strongest existence in the entire Xuanhuang World right now.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan then looked over at Xuan Yunxian, his wife. She was also locked up in seclusion at this moment. Perhaps, it was because she knew that there many dangers outside the Xuanhuang World, and the only way she could help out Lin Fan was by raising her own strength.</p><br/><p>However, all of this was still ever so insignificant when compared to the utmost powerful beings.</p><br/><p>Right now, Lin Fan was in possession of four worlds. And, the strongest living beings were the ones that were in his Paradise. Following closely after was the Bat World, the Xuanhuang World, and finally, the Earth.</p><br/><p>Regarding Earth, Lin Fan did not have any plans for the beings there. That was because the living beings there were simply way too weak. Even if he gave them sufficient time right now, they might not even be able to get up to speed.</p><br/><p>After all, time wasn\u2019t the only factor when it came to the difference. There was also one\u2019s resources to consider.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Three days later, the Fire Water Empress appeared before Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome with me. Remember now, do not create any trouble.\u201d The Fire Water Empress reminded Lin Fan once more.</p><br/><p>\u201cGot it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Although he did not know how long it had been, Lin Fan knew that it definitely had been quite some time. If even an utmost powerful being such as the Fire Water Empress who could even glide through the rivers of time had to spend such a long time to travel, the distance required must definitely not be any mere normal distance.</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan caught sight of everything before him, his inner heart froze up entirely.</p><br/><p>\u201cBloody hell! Just where is this place again?\u201d</p><br/><p>In front of Lin Fan were two stone doors which he could not even figure out the height of, sealing up the Heaven and Earth. There were countless mysterious runic symbols that were etched on it. In fact, there was even an unknown God Chain that was locking up both of these stone gates tightly.</p><br/><p>An eternal and ancient aura emanated out from behind those doors.</p><br/><p>This aura could have anyone feeling insignificant in the face of it, and just succumb to it entirely.</p><br/><p>\u2018Just what in the bloody world is this?\u2019</p><br/><p>Lam_ Lam_ Alright now, I hope to have some GODLY SECRETS hidden in this place to satiate my lust for a good plot. LETS GO!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

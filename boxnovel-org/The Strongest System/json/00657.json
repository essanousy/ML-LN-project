A gigantic and ancient looking smelt stood tall between the Heavens and Earth, repelling the severing power completely. The moment that amount of energy made contact with the Heaven and Earth Smelt, it dissipated entirely.</p><br/><p>\"What's this treasure?\" The faces of the Evil Alliance Patriarch and the Old Master of the Fox race change immediately. They now bore a look of greed in their eyes.</p><br/><p>To them, this human was like a piece of fish meat on their chopping boards, ready to be sliced up easily.</p><br/><p>\"Bloody hell! These guys are really way too troublesome. Indeed, Eternal God state beings are extremely powerful. Even if I can f*ck up divine celestial level 7 powerful beings, I'm really not a match for Eternal God state beings.\"</p><br/><p>\"What should I do?\"</p><br/><p>At this moment, Lin Fan began pondering. He had to think up of a plan, no matter what.</p><br/><p>\"Patriarch, given your wide knowledge, what do you suppose this treasure is?\" The Old Master of the Fox race asked.</p><br/><p>\"I've got no idea. But, if it can defend against our attacks, it's evidently an Utmost Treasure. I'm supposing that human should be hiding within it right now.\" The Evil Alliance Patriarch replied.</p><br/><p>\"That's just as well. Time for me to check out just what sort of a treasure it is then.\" The Old Master of the Fox race spread out his fingers with one hand, pushing forth with a boundless amount of power. He wanted to seize this mysterious smelt. However, the moment his fingers made contact with it, they exploded out immediately as though it had caused some sort of a reflective reaction.</p><br/><p>\"Indeed, it's a treasure! To think that I couldn't even lift it up.\" The Old Master of the Fox race felt excited as he remarked in glee.</p><br/><p>\"Old Master of the Fox race, let's join our forces and cultivate this smelt for ourselves. Since that fella doesn't want to come out, we'll cultivate him along with it!\" The Evil Alliance Patriarch commented.</p><br/><p>\"Alright.\"</p><br/><p>Instantly, the Evil Alliance Patriarch and the Old Master of the Fox race flipped their hands together, forming all sorts of mysterious hand seals.</p><br/><p>These hand seals surrounded the smelt, bringing with them a strong power of refinement.</p><br/><p>\"Fox God Refinement!\"</p><br/><p>Instantly, the illusory image of the gigantic red Nine-Tailed Fox opened its humongous mouth, spitting out an endless amount of fire that burnt the Heaven and Earth Smelt.</p><br/><p>\"Bloody hell! These bunch of brain-dead f*cks! This Heaven and Earth Smelt belongs to the system. You guys think that you're enough to refine it? Retarded!\" Lin Fan had utmost confidence in his Heaven and Earth Smelt. Therefore, he wasn't worried in the least bit.</p><br/><p>However, even if this were to carry on, nothing would change.</p><br/><p>\"Alright, since this is the case, Yours Truly will have to go all out against you guys!\" Lin Fan was feeling extremely upset. The losses that would follow were definitely going to be extremely costly.</p><br/><p>\"Motherf*cking Human King! If you get the hell out now, we can still spare your life!\" The voice of the Evil Alliance Patriarch rang out.</p><br/><p>\"You're farting! You guys have got to be dreaming!\" Lin Fan scolded them. This time around, they had truly pushed him to the edge.</p><br/><p>\"Hmph, bloody insolent thing!\" The Evil Alliance Patriarch scoffed.</p><br/><p>\"Patriarch, let's not waste any more time talking nonsense with him. We've got to hurry up and refine this! There're many dead Ancient race beings here. Who knows if this may attract the Utmost Being of the Ancient race over.\" The Old Master of the Fox race said.</p><br/><p>\"Ok.\"</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>At this moment, Lin Fan recalled something horrific as well. That was right! The Utmost Being of the Ancient race might appear here!</p><br/><p>He had killed so many Ancient race beings here! Not only that, he had a duel with the doppelganger of the Utmost Being three years back. Who knew whether that fella had the knowledge that he might be here right now? If he did, he might truly come over and have him killed personally!</p><br/><p>\"Old fogeys! I'm sorry! Seems like I can only have you guys sacrifice yourselves today. You had better blow up these two fellas!\" Sensing the aura of the eight old fogeys, Lin Fan ordered them.</p><br/><p>\"Self-destruct!\"</p><br/><p>The Evil Alliance Patriarch and the Old Master of the Fox race were busy refining at this moment. However, they suddenly sensed a horrifying aura that was encompassing the entire sky.</p><br/><p>\"Not good! They're going to self-destruct!\" Looking at the elderly figures who were guarding over all directions, the face of the Old Master of the Fox race took a huge turn.</p><br/><p>Even though these guys were at the Eternal God state, they did not have the equivalent strength to match. But with that said, if they were to self-destruct right now, it would be an entirely different story to tell.</p><br/><p>\"Has this human gone entirely batsh*t nuts?\"</p><br/><p>\"Every single powerful being who has cultivated up to an Eternal God state had to undergo all sorts of trials and tribulations! Why would these old fogeys here self-destruct?\"</p><br/><p>\"Hurry up and leave! Don't stay here any longer! Otherwise, if these old fellas were to self-destruct, we might truly die here!\"</p><br/><p>Looking at how the eight old fogeys were going to self-destruct, the Evil Alliance Patriarch and the Old Master of the Fox race were scared sh*tless right now. They no longer had the same imposing demeanor as before.</p><br/><p>The self-destruction of an Eternal God state being was nothing to be scoffed at.</p><br/><p>Their Paradise, flesh and meat, Universal Elixir, etc\u2026 If all of these were to blow up, the impact would definitely be devastating.</p><br/><p>\"Go and explode!\"</p><br/><p>BOOM!</p><br/><p>Instantly, the entire world began to vibrate intensely. The eight old fogeys blew themselves up just like that. The radius of the detonation was extremely wide and boundless.</p><br/><p>The scene right now was akin to a doomsday. That massive amount of energy rippled through the entire world. Even the void was tearing up layer by layer. Everything descended into a state of complete darkness.</p><br/><p>Even while he was hidden within the Heaven and Earth Smelt, Lin Fan could feel the formidable amount of energy ramming itself against the walls of his smelt.</p><br/><p>If he hadn't been hiding within this place, he would have been disintegrated into ashes within a split second.</p><br/><p>\"You madman!\"</p><br/><p>Those were the last words that Lin Fan heard while he was within the Heaven and Earth Smelt. Following that, pure silence ensued.</p><br/><p>\"Could they be both dead?\" Lin Fan did not know how the situation was outside right now. However, he felt his heart clenching really tightly.</p><br/><p>Just like that, eight powerful beings of an Eternal God state were gone!</p><br/><p>It'd be useless if he were to just have one of them self-destruct. The radius of the explosion would be way too wide, and the other seven would undoubtedly be implicated as well.</p><br/><p>Since that was the case, he might as well have all of them self-destruct. If that could have the Evil Alliance Patriarch and the Old Master of the Fox race dying because of it, then he wouldn't be making that much of a loss either.</p><br/><p>\"Everything should be fine now.\" Lin Fan snuck his way out of the Heaven and Earth Smelt.</p><br/><p>\"S-so vicious!\"</p><br/><p>Looking at the scene outside, Lin Fan was shocked silly.</p><br/><p>The void was gone. Everything was totally dark. A breeze of a turbulent energy current blew by him, tugging at his body.</p><br/><p>The Earth was gone. The skies were gone. Every single last thing had been annihilated.</p><br/><p>\"T-this\u2026!\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was speechless right now. This was the first time he saw the aftermath of an Eternal God state being's self-destruction.</p><br/><p>Every single Eternal God state powerful being treated their lives as a precious gem. How could they be willing to blow themselves up?</p><br/><p>That was because it's immensely difficult if one wanted to attain the Eternal God state. It could be said to be calamitous in fact.</p><br/><p>\"Could the Evil Alliance Patriarch and the Old Master of the Fox race truly be dead just like this?\" Lin Fan swept the surroundings. However, he did not catch sight of any presence of the Evil Alliance Patriarch and the Old Master of the Fox race.</p><br/><p>But just at this moment, Lin Fan noticed something at the far reaches of the void.</p><br/><p>A mess of blood and flesh was rumbling furiously, as though it was trying to make its escape. Also, this mess of blood and flesh was howling in a maddened rage as well.</p><br/><p>\"Patriarch, you beast! How dare you use me as a shield?\" This mess of blood and flesh belonged to the Old Master of the Fox race.</p><br/><p>The moment when the eight old fogeys were about to self-destruct, the Evil Alliance Patriarch and the Old Master of the Fox race were scared beyond their wits. Instantly, they delved into the void to escape.</p><br/><p>However, how scary of a thing was a self-destruction of an Eternal God state being? In order to ensure his own safety, the Evil Alliance Patriarch seized an opportunity when the Old Master of the Fox race was distracted and slapped him out ahead to serve as a blockade against the aftershock of the explosion.</p><br/><p>\"BEAST! YOU'RE TRULY A BEAST!\" The Old Master of the Fox race was howling madly right now. Just this one move has caused him to lose quite a bit of essence from his body.</p><br/><p>The half crippled body of the Old Master of the Fox race had already made his escape. This mess of blood and flesh was the only thing he left behind here.</p><br/><p>However, this mess of blood and flesh still possessed a part of the boundless powers of the Old Master of the Fox race. Lin Fan naturally could not let this go.</p><br/><p>\"Haha! Old Master of the Fox race! To think that an old geezer like you would still leave something behind for me!\" Realising that this mess of flesh and blood belonged to the Old Master of the Fox race, Lin Fan was delighted.</p><br/><p>It wasn't as though he could possibly lose out to this mess of blood and flesh right now, could he?</p><br/><p>Even though this was just a mess of blood and flesh, this piece of meat contained a portion of that infinite strength the Old Master of the Fox race possesses.</p><br/><p>If he were to be able to refine this, it would be pretty decent as well!</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

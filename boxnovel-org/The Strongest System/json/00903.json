Do you wanna head there together, Great Sage?\" Lin Fan chuckled while asking.</p><br/><p>\"Nah. It's fine even if this era ends just like this. I no longer want to fight and contest for anything anymore.\" The Great Sage shook his head as though he had seen through everything, and was no longer desiring anything in this world.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Lin Fan could only feel multiple powerful auras emanating out from the distance.</p><br/><p>\"Great Sage, I'll take my leave then!\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said while cupping his fists.</p><br/><p>Chicky cried out a few times before leaping onto Lin Fan's shoulders.</p><br/><p>'Legendary Items, here I come!'</p><br/><p>A long streak of light bolted out as Lin Fan dove into the endless void instantly.</p><br/><p>When the world was glorious, it would bring forth benefits for all the living beings within. But, for all the utmost powerful beings, what they needed the most were the top tiered Legendary Items.</p><br/><p>Be it the 3,000 Demonic Gods of the Ancient race or the utmost powerful beings of the thousands of races, all of them were in contest for those Legendary Items.</p><br/><p>Within the void\u2026</p><br/><p>All the powerful beings were just waiting quietly. Their interests weren't piqued with the faintly glowing lights that were flowing by in the world right now.</p><br/><p>Those were just common treasures that were akin to scrap metal for them. But. for the normal powerful beings, these were the most precious things in the world.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Lin Fan was hidden within the endless void as well. When he caught sight of these powerful beings before him, his heart skipped a beat.</p><br/><p>The auras of these utmost powerful beings were extremely profound and imperceptible. Every single one of them was an unrivaled existence.</p><br/><p>If he wanted to snatch away those Legendary Items from the hands of these powerful beings, that might be quite the difficult task.</p><br/><p>The normal items that had descended from the Heavens had already caused fights to break out amongst the thousands of races. But, Lin Fan wasn't bothered about those items at all. For him, the Legendary Items that were yet to emerge were the most precious ones.</p><br/><p>Seemed like there was definitely going to be a huge battle again this time around.</p><br/><p>Gradually, Lin Fan started to sink into his thoughts. He had to make his preparations properly. Otherwise, even if he managed to snatch the Legendary Items and failed to leave, that would be extremely awkward by then.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Lin Fan immediately controlled the Spirit of Biggra and lined it through the endless rivers of the void, making it concentrate continuously.</p><br/><p>Shing!</p><br/><p>All of a sudden, the void vibrated as a mysterious and extremely formidable aura permeated it. Any single living being in the face of this would be nothing but an ant.</p><br/><p>The Yin and Yang of the Heavens and Earth were separated while the Five Elements started churning. The entire void seemed to be sealed up by this formidable might as time, fortune, and everything else stopped moving under this noble force.</p><br/><p>All the utmost powerful beings held their breaths awaiting the arrival of the final moment.</p><br/><p>\"It's finally going to begin. This time around, Your Ancestor is going to grab hold of everything!\" The Lord of the Lion race with a lion head and a human body roared out. Those sharp teeth of his gnawed at the void and swallowed it into his tummy as his eyes were filled with an unparalleled battle intent, glaring around with a death stare.</p><br/><p>As long as the Legendary Items descended, he would definitely seize the chance and snatch it over for himself.</p><br/><p>The Extreme Yin Demonic God, Extreme Yang Demonic God, Sin Demonic God, Time Demonic God\u2026All of these utmost powerful beings were just camping in wait right here.</p><br/><p>As for those powerful beings that were within the sects right now, they were also feeling the formidable power that was channeling in the void.</p><br/><p>Pairs of lustful eyes stared at the endless void. However, they knew that the final Legendary Items that descended weren't something that they could get their hands on. They belonged to those utmost powerful beings.</p><br/><p>\"Lord of the Lion race, greed will not enable a snake to swallow an elephant. Be careful of choking to death later on.\" A man with sixteen pairs of pitch black wings that were fluttering rapidly said in a grim tone.</p><br/><p>\"Hmph! Lucifer, we'll just wait and see then. This time around, anyone who fights with Your Ancestor here for it shall be an enemy.\" The Ancestor of the Lion race's wild aura was starting to emanate out.</p><br/><p>\"Fufufu,\" Lucifer chuckled, unbothered in the least bit.</p><br/><p>All of a sudden, a tear ripped in the void as a brilliant radiance shone out. The item that was wrapped within this shining light dazzled with a godly glow that lit up the entire place.</p><br/><p>\"That's the Universal God Key!\"</p><br/><p>An utmost powerful being recognized this item immediately as he howled out.</p><br/><p>\"That's mine!\"</p><br/><p>A gigantic, golden arm that covered the entire area with five fingers which were as huge as mountains stretched out and grabbed the Universal God Key in his hands immediately.</p><br/><p>\"HAHAHA! I've got it!\"</p><br/><p>The one who had obtained the Universal God Key was the Golden Demonic God of the Ancient race Demonic Gods. He had been awaiting this Legendary Item for the longest time now.</p><br/><p>Some of the other utmost powerful beings were just conserving their energies, waiting for the Legendary Item they wanted the most to appear before going for it.</p><br/><p>ROAR!</p><br/><p>All of a sudden, a dragon's roar filled the entire region as a ten million feet long Colossal Dragon tore through the void with a furious spiral.</p><br/><p>That ten million feet long Colossal Dragon's true body was actually just the single word 'Dragon'!</p><br/><p>BOOM!</p><br/><p>All of a sudden, multiple utmost powerful beings made their move.</p><br/><p>A long whip tore through the void and tied up that ten million feet long Colossal Dragon, trying to drag it over.</p><br/><p>\"This the Legendary Item of my Colossal Dragon race! Who dares to touch it?\"</p><br/><p>An even more ferocious dragon roar boomed throughout the entire region as the Ancestor of the Colossal Dragon race, Ying Long, tore through everything. That gigantic Colossal Dragon mouth of his devoured the entire world and instantly swallowed that 'Dragon' character into his tummy.</p><br/><p>All of these earlier waves of Legendary Items had not attracted the attention of most of the utmost powerful beings.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was just camping in wait as well. He realized that all of these utmost powerful beings seemed to still be waiting patiently right now.</p><br/><p>Even though the Universal God Key and the text character from earlier on were pretty strong, even Lin Fan wasn't moved by it at all, let alone the utmost powerful beings.</p><br/><p>However, that 'Dragon' text character bore some similarities with Lin Fan's own Heaven and Earth Sutra. But, if he had to compare the both of them, there was still too much difference.</p><br/><p>BOOM!</p><br/><p>All of a sudden, a tremendous explosion boomed out within the entire world. The Legendary Item no longer appeared one by one. Instead, they gushed out like a wave.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan realized that at the end of the boundless void was actually a blister that was appearing! This blister seemed to contain an endless number of Legendary Items that were trying to burst forth!</p><br/><p>\"F*ck! The chance is now!\"</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan caught sight of this, he knew that there was no way he could continue waiting! Immediately, he went into Stealth mode and summoned out the Heaven and Earth Smelt before the blister exploded.</p><br/><p>Instantly, the Heaven and Earth Smelt blocked away that blister. As long as any Legendary Items were to appear, they would all belong to him!</p><br/><p>\"Who is he?\"</p><br/><p>The moment Lin Fan appeared, countless utmost powerful beings reacted to it.</p><br/><p>\"Damn it! He's trying to steal away all of our Legendary Items! Kill him!\"</p><br/><p>\"Human! That fella is of the Human race!\"</p><br/><p>\"Suppress!\"</p><br/><p>At this moment, countless utmost powerful beings struck out. How could they allow this human to snatch away all of their Legendary Items?</p><br/><p>BAM!</p><br/><p>Suddenly, the blister exploded as an endless amount of Legendary Items spilled out from it.</p><br/><p>As for those Legendary Items outside of the blister, Lin Fan was no longer bothered about them by now. Greed would not allow a snake to devour an elephant. If he wanted to reap in all the Legendary Items that spilled out of the other places as well, he might end up with nothing in his possession.</p><br/><p>'I'm rich!' With a single thought of his, Lin Fan swept in all of the Legendary Items within his Heaven and Earth Smelt.</p><br/><p>Dense and clustered, only God knew how many of them were there.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Lin Fan did not want to linger on any longer. The most important thing to do right now was to make his escape!</p><br/><p>All of the killing strikes of those utmost powerful beings rained down on Lin Fan's body. Instantly, his blood rumbled. However, other than that, there wasn't much damage that was caused to him.</p><br/><p>\"HAHAHA! Everyone, all of these Legendary Items shall belong to me\u2026!\"</p><br/><p>Under the infuriated gazes of all these utmost powerful beings that were surrounding this place, Lin Fan roared out. When he spread out his five fingers, the Spirit of Biggra erupted forth from him instantly in a violent haze.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

There were countless strange looking figures that were surrounding this dilapidated sect right now.</p><br/><p>\u201cROAR!\u201d</p><br/><p>A gigantic dragon with two wings on its back was growling out furiously. Spanning a hundred feet tall, each time it opened its mouth, a ferocious dragon breath shot out. Wherever the breath passed, everything was evaporated into nothingness. Standing on the body of this gigantic dragon was a man wielding a long spear and donning an ornate piece of armor. He was just like the king of the Nine Heavens, looking down on the rest of the world in disdain.</p><br/><p>Below the gigantic dragon stood figures draped with black robes one after another. All of them were chanting out some incantations in their mouths, causing the pitch black magic wands they were wielding to emit off a vile and sinister power.</p><br/><p>The ground quaked as though there was an endless legion of howling Undead Spirits underneath.</p><br/><p>One after another, sets of white bones were revived from under the ground. Some of these white bones shone with a silvery glow, some with a golden glow while others having a rainbow glow to them. It was a bedazzling gleam; however, their aura was an exact opposite, being frosty and chilling. They were just like the vile demons of the Nine Hells themselves.</p><br/><p>\u201cTo think that the bodies of these Indigenous Beings would be this strong. The Undead Spirits created from them are pretty darned strong indeed!\u201d An elderly figure waved out the wand in his hand, and all of a sudden, those disciples that had died in the battle seemed as though they were possessed by something and bolted upright. At the beginning, the movements of these corpses were somewhat rigid. But gradually, they began to regain some fluidity. At the same time, their eyes were pitch black, looking extremely horrifying.</p><br/><p>When the Dragon Knight riding on the dragon looked down on everything before him, he remarked in a bright voice, \u201cTo think that everything was real. After 10,000 years, they had finally arrived here and laid down the Dimensional Portal. For the sake of our Master, we shall bring down glory on the rest of the world. Everyone shall have to bow down under the magnificent brilliance of our Master.\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment he lifted his hand, the elderly figure which could summon the undead looked over at the Dragon Knight with a pair of lifeless eyes, \u201cDragon Knight Jayce, we have to wait for the arrival of the great army and must not act brashly. Because of you, we were already forced to have all the Indigenous Beings here slain. If this were to arouse the attention of all the other Indigenous Beings in this place, that would definitely impede our march.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAndrew, don\u2019t you think that all these Undead Spirits of the Indigenous Beings that you are controlling over right now are the spoils of war?\u201d Dragon Knight Jayce asked.</p><br/><p>The place where they were from was called the Moon Shadow Mainland. There were initially many races in that place. However, after the development over countless of years, it had already been unified as all the different races bore a single universal identity.</p><br/><p>All of them had absolute faith toward the seventy two Master Gods. As a part of the Dragon Knight Denomination, his faith lay in the Dragon Knight Master God. Bringing with him the glorious splendor of the Dragon Knights, he would ensure that he spilled over a little of that same glory onto every single Indigenous Being he encountered. They would be given the honor of becoming slaves to dedicate their entire lives to the great Master God.</p><br/><p>Andrew was satisfied right now, \u201cBut of course\u2026 The bodies of these Indigenous Beings are simply way too strong. The mysterious power that they wield is even more fascinating. I suppose that I should definitely research on them properly after heading back to see if I can create even stronger Undead Spirits with them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn it\u2026DAMN IT!\u201d At that moment, a young man struggled to crawl up and stand in the ruins, wielding a longsword in his hands. His entire body was stained with nothing but fresh blood. However, the moment he caught sight of everything before him, his heart sank as though he had just lost every single last bit of hope.</p><br/><p>\u201cWHO IN THE WORLD ARE YOU GUYS? WHY THE HELL DID YOU HAVE TO DESTROY MY SECT?\u201d The young man howled out as his body was coiled by an unrivaled killing intent.</p><br/><p>A torrential wrath burst forth from him and pierced right into the skies above, causing the entire Heaven and Earth to quake because of it.</p><br/><p>When Andrew looked at this Indigenous Being that was still alive at this very moment, his lips curled into an extremely sinister and creepy smile, \u201cTo think that the strongest Indigenous Being isn\u2019t dead yet. That must be the reason why the strongest Undead Being isn\u2019t created just yet.\u201d</p><br/><p>The gigantic dragon that Dragon Knight Jayce was riding on sneezed out slightly, as though it wanted to have this Indigenous Being killed in a single breath.</p><br/><p>Andrew stood forth and stopped it, \u201cDon\u2019t strike out. The research value of this Indigenous Being is extremely high. I have to preserve his full corpse.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIndigenous Being, bow down and declare your allegiance to me, Andrew. I can bring you to witness the glorious brilliance of the Undead God personally.\u201d Andrew spoke up.</p><br/><p>\u201cUndead God?\u201d</p><br/><p>This young man was none other than the Grandmaster of the Sword Qi Sect. The longsword in his hand was quivering slightly in fear, as though it was being afraid of this unknown terror awaiting them. However, his heart wasn\u2019t fearful in the slightest bit; instead, it was filled with wrath.</p><br/><p>\u201cEVEN IF I DIE, I WILL MAKE SURE YOU GUYS PAY THE PRICE!\u201d The young man bellowed out as the hatred within his eyes shot out endlessly. It was as though he could explode at any moment right now.</p><br/><p>Andrew shook his head before lifting his hand and chanting out slightly.</p><br/><p>Click!</p><br/><p>Clack!</p><br/><p>All those disciples of the sect that Andrew had transformed into Undead Spirits took up their swords and surrounded this young man lifelessly.</p><br/><p>When the young man caught sight of all his previous disciples, his heart clenched up tightly as though he was in a deep pain.</p><br/><p>\u201cELDERS\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDISICPLES\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWHAT\u2019S WRONG WITH YOU GUYS\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>The young man reared his head into the sky and howled out. He could not feel any bit of life from these disciples of his at all. All of these people who were just filled with life earlier on were now gone with the wind.</p><br/><p>\u201cARGHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!\u201d</p><br/><p>The eyes of the young man were bloodshot as he raised his sword and slashed out toward these disciples of his that had turned into Undead Spirits.</p><br/><p>Shing!</p><br/><p>Wherever the Sword Qi passed by, everything was destroyed.</p><br/><p>He stabbed the longsword deep through the chest of an Undead Spirit disciple.</p><br/><p>\u201cGrandmaster\u2026\u201d The Undead Spirit disciple extended his hand and grabbed the longsword in his hands.</p><br/><p>The young man\u2019s head bolted up right away as he looked at this disciple before him, eyes streaming with tears of blood. \u201cYes, Grandmaster is here\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy do you have to kill me\u2026?\u201d The Undead Spirit disciple opened his mouth and spoke out softly. But, when the voice traveled into the ears of the young man, it exploded out like thunder.</p><br/><p>The young man\u2019s head dropped low right away as he cried out, \u201cWhy\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He then lifted his head, \u201cDon\u2019t worry! Your Grandmaster will take revenge for you!\u201d</p><br/><p>BAM!</p><br/><p>Sword Qi sliced out as that Undead Spirit disciple shattered apart right away.</p><br/><p>\u201cDEGENERATES! I\u2019M GOING TO KILL YOU GUYS!\u201d The young man howled out in wrath. No matter how severely injured he was right now, he would definitely have to take revenge for his disciple.</p><br/><p>Andrew\u2019s eyes sparkled with a glint of surprise, \u201cTo think that the will of this Indigenous Being would be this strong! If I were to refine him into one of my Undead Spirits, he would definitely make a remarkable Undead Spirit slave!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSWORD SLAYS THE MOUNTAINS AND RIVERS!\u201d</p><br/><p>The young man bellowed out as his longsword streaked right into the void and sliced at it. That formidable Sword Intent pierced through the void and struck out at Andrew.</p><br/><p>When Andrew caught sight of this, his lips curled into a grin, \u201cOh, mighty Undead God! Do allow your noble might to descend upon this place!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSealing Technique!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAbysmal Swamp!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLand of Undead Spirits!\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, gigantic star pentagrams floated out one after another in front of Andrew, with a terrifying darkness and a horrifying aura of death reeking out of them.</p><br/><p>Broop!</p><br/><p>Broop!</p><br/><p>All of a sudden, the firm ground beneath the young man turned into a patch of swamp that was bubbling with a jet black liquid! From within, skeletal hands appeared one after another that grabbed out at the legs of that young man, trying to drag him down into this endless abyss.</p><br/><p>At the same time, that Sword Qi that he had struck out into the air was suddenly grabbed onto by demonic pitch black hands one after another, dragging it into that Land of the Undead Spirits.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow could this be?\u201d When the young man caught sight of this, his heart was anguished beyond anything else. Why must the enemies be this strong and yet he was only this weak?</p><br/><p>\u201cSpear of the Undead!\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, Andrew\u2019s finger pointed out into the void, causing it to tremble slightly. A penetrative power that was filled with an aura of death burst forth from it.</p><br/><p>With that, a pitch black spear pushed itself out of the void bit by bit.</p><br/><p>\u201cGO!\u201d</p><br/><p>Pshew!</p><br/><p>That Spear of the Undead exploded forth, darting right for the chest of that young man.</p><br/><p>When the young man caught sight of that Spear of the Undead, his heart was filled with grief, indignation, and despair at the same time.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

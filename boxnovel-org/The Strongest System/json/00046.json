The profession of teaching was so sacrosanct; every word, every movement would affect a student\u2019s future development. Thus, Lin Fan was very serious.</p><br/><p>And now he had unlocked the teacher profession, which made Lin Fan a bit curious. Just what use did it have?</p><br/><p>\u2018Profession: Teacher</p><br/><p>Effects: Every word, every sentence will greatly influence the students who hear them. Your each word is sacred for students\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Lin Fan scratched his head when he saw the description. He still didn\u2019t understand just what use the teacher profession was for.</p><br/><p>Although he didn\u2019t understand the use for the teacher profession, his current situation was clear. As an honorable teacher, he needed to prepare his next lesson for these cheeky eager students.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan had read many novels before. Although he didn\u2019t remember them clearly, he was still able to talk about the earlier chapters. He was right now talking about chapter one of \"Fighting Through The Sky\" to bring these students that had lost hope of the future a full bowl of chicken soup for the soul.</p><br/><p>The students looked at the new teacher up at the podium. Just what was this teacher doing? And just what is this \"Fighting Through The Sky\"?</p><br/><p>Lin Fan gave a light cough, \"In the far distant continent of Doqi was a very small city, and a young boy called Xiao Yan\u2026\"</p><br/><p>The students didn\u2019t understand what the teacher was talking about. Just where was this continent of Doqi. But as the teacher continued his story, they gradually became immersed. The teacher\u2019s voice was spell-like and directly touched their hearts.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the students and nodded in satisfaction. It seemed the effects weren\u2019t bad, so he continued his lesson.</p><br/><p>\"Xian Yan was a genius\u2026 proud and confident. People admired him and envied him, but no one could surpass him. But one day, the acclaimed genius Xiao Yan lost his cultivation base overnight and became useless, and the people who had tried to curry his favor before turned and mocked him. His past glory was all gone in just one night\u2026\" Lin Fan was confident of his eloquence. Although he didn\u2019t remember the plot in detail, just talking about the outline was still doable.</p><br/><p>He continued on for a while, then stopped, and the immersed student then looked anxiously at Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>\"Teacher, what happened next?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes, teacher, what happened after Xian Yan became useless?\"</p><br/><p>The students became impatient seeing the teacher not continuing.</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan saw the students\u2019expression, he knew the effect had been achieved. He then smiled, \"Don\u2019t be hasty. Now you all can discuss and say your opinions.\"</p><br/><p>\"Zhu You, you start first.\" Lin Fan pointed to a round-faced boy sitting in the back.</p><br/><p>\"Teacher, my name is Zhu Di, not Zhu You.\"</p><br/><p>\"Hm.\" Lin Fan frowned, slightly unhappy.</p><br/><p>\"Okay, teacher, my name is Zhu You. My opinion is that after this genius Xiao Yan became useless, he felt very sad and lost hope in life.\" Zhu Di said after thinking.</p><br/><p>\"Yes, you are right. He had become even more useless than all of you, becoming insignificant in his family, losing everything he once had. He lost all hope, and for three years suffered countless humiliation and ridicule. But the tragic days were far from over, and something even more devastating then happened\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"His former fianc\u00e9e\u2026then withdrew her engagement. Alright, now again say your opinions.\" Lin Fan then stopped before getting to the main point and instantly pointed to a student.</p><br/><p>\"Cao Tian Jiao, you answer.\"</p><br/><p>The students were a bit exasperated. Why was the teacher like this and kept stopping halfway, this made them restless.</p><br/><p>Ciao Tian Jiao looked at the teacher while feeling a bit down. His name wasn\u2019t Ciao Tiano Jiao, but after seeing the teacher\u2019s expression, even if it weren't, it would be from now on.</p><br/><p>\"Teacher, I believe this is a great disgrace for any man. Aside from public humiliation, he even suffered the humiliation of his fianc\u00e9e breaking off their engagement. If it was me I\u2026I\u2026\" Ciao Tian Jiao felt it was injustice, but when he started talking about himself, he then stopped.</p><br/><p>\"If it were you, what would you do?\"Lin Fan asked with a smile.</p><br/><p>Ciao Tian Jiao looked at the teacher and then scratched his head in embarrassment, \"I think I would accept it. I am not good enough for the other party after all.\"</p><br/><p>When Ciao Tian Jiao said this, the surrounding students began laughing.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan motioned them to settle down and continued the story.</p><br/><p>\"Then, Xiao Yan using his blood as ink and wrote a letter canceling the engagement. Life has its ups and downs, but don\u2019t look down on poor youths\u2026 this saying expressed Xiao Yan\u2019s inner rage and resentment. At the same time, it also carried the full fury of his past three years.\" Lin Fan\u2019s tone also changed with the scene.</p><br/><p>The students listened, and at the end, their hearts felt like they had been moved, as if an invisible force had begun assaulting their heart that had lost all hope in the future.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026 teacher profession experience + 10.\u2019</p><br/><p>Lin Fan then realized that his experience had increased. He paused in a bit of confusion. It hadn\u2019t increased earlier, but why did it increase now.</p><br/><p>It seemed he would need to carefully inspect the teacher profession later.</p><br/><p>\"The expression \u2018don\u2019t look down on poor youths\u2019 is so accurate. I will also work harder from now on. So what if my talent can\u2019t compare to them, at the very least, I have to live up to myself.\" Zhu Di clenched his fist, his plump face flushed red.</p><br/><p>\"That\u2019s right, I will also work hard from now on.\"</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Lin Fan paused, was it that easy to make them regain their confidence? This didn\u2019t make sense. Was it perhaps the effect of the teacher profession?</p><br/><p>Lin Fan didn\u2019t understand, but continued on, \"Xiao Yan suffered such humiliation, so he wanted to become stronger&gt; But he had become essentially useless, so how would he achieve that? Just when Xiao Yan didn\u2019t know what to do, a mighty and powerful master emerged, who was swayed by Xiao Yan\u2019s unyielding heart. He believed Xiao Yan had potential, and took him under his wing, and assisted with his growth\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan then summarized, Xiao Yan worked hard and raised his cultivation base, then reattained his position within society and regained his glory. Of course Lin Fan had changed several areas of the story, as just using the original plot wouldn\u2019t do.</p><br/><p>After Lin Fan finished, the thirtheen students were now brimming with motivation. Boys and girls clenched their fists and were flushed red, feeling an unlimited power towards the future.</p><br/><p>After the lesson, the previous dead-like atmosphere had disappeared. The depressing attitude now replaced with an unyielding confidence.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was satisfied, he had been thinking of saying more, but who would\u2019ve thought just this little would have so much effect.</p><br/><p>\"Alright, the story of Xiao Yan is finished. Now, after hearing the whole story, what do you all think the main point is?\" Lin Fan crossed his hands and smiled confidently at the students.</p><br/><p>\"Teacher, I think the most important point is to have an unyielding heart.\"</p><br/><p>\"To be strong, endure humiliation, never give up.\"</p><br/><p>\"Work hard and strive.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the talking students and shook his head, disagreeing with their words.</p><br/><p>\"Teacher, what do you think the most important point is?\"Liu Miaomiao asked in puzzlement when she saw the teacher shaking his head.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at Liu Miaomiao, \"Liu Shuishui and everyone else, what you said are also important. But I believe the most important point is that Xiao Yan met a good teacher, a good teacher just like me\u2026 What do you think?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan felt that this group of students wasn\u2019t particularly smart. It lost all meaning if he had to say it, to not even know the main point.</p><br/><p>Liu Miaomiao froze, apparently caught off guard.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shook his head, \"You see, Xiao Yan had become useless. How could he rise up by just himself? It\u2019s all because he met a good teacher. That\u2019s why this teacher is crucial to why Xiao Yan was able to regain his glory. Without the teacher guiding Xiao Yan, he wouldn\u2019t have been able to achieve all the later stuff. Do you agree with what I say?\"</p><br/><p>Liu Miaomiao and the rest reevaluated their opinions after hearing the teacher\u2019s analysis, feeling that the teacher\u2019s words made sense. After everyone glanced at each other, they all immediately stood up respectfully and then bow to Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>\"Teacher, please take care of us. We also want to become like Xiao Yan. We don\u2019t want to be looked down on by others for our entires lives.\"</p><br/><p>\"Please, teacher.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded very in satisfaction. They were worth teaching; they understood the story\u2019s most important point. That wasn\u2019t an easy task.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026 congratulations teacher profession, experience + 10.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026 congratulations teacher profession, experience + 10.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026 congratulations teacher upgraded to mentor.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026 congratulations unlocked mentor.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

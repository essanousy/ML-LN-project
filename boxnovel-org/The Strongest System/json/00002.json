As long as we pass the examination, we can become outer sect disciples. A mere punching bag dares to say that to us? Despicable!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhich one of us isn\u2019t a dragon amongst men, descendants of nobility. This puny punching bag dares to insult us! My fellow brothers, don\u2019t worry, I will teach this ignorant fool a lesson.\u201d</p><br/><p>At this point, these outer sect examination disciples were completely infuriated. They never would have thought a person of the lowest category in the sect would dare defy them. It was essentially seeking death.</p><br/><p>At the same time, the hearts of the battered punching bags were filled with gratitude after hearing those hate seeking words.</p><br/><p>\u201cBro!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBoss!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFather!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan stood there watching the person draw near, \u201cBrat, you are far too arrogant. Even though I won\u2019t take your worthless life, I will still let you understand that arrogance is wrong.\u201d</p><br/><p>These outer sect examination disciples, even though they had yet to learn the Saint Devil Sect\u2019s martial arts, the strength they possessed was impressive compared to average people. Although it wasn\u2019t at the point of cracking metal and splitting stone, they could still destroy trees of the thickness of a bowl with one punch.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh.....\u201d Prepared to teach Lin Fan a lesson, the outer sect examination disciple took a stance and let out a cry, attacking with full force.</p><br/><p>Bam!!!</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the person in front of him as his lips curled into a smile.</p><br/><p>+2</p><br/><p>As expected, this guy is stronger than the previous on\u2026 Not bad, not bad.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, I said you guys are trash, and you all wouldn\u2019t believe me. Completely useless! Can\u2019t you use more power?\u201d Lin Fan stood there brushing off his chest in disdain.</p><br/><p>\u201cAgain\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBrat, don\u2019t get cocky, eat this!\u201d The outer sect examination disciple was unwilling to believe this outcome.</p><br/><p>+2</p><br/><p>+2</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>At this point, the outer sect examination disciple had both hands shaking, and was heavily gasping for breath, as his forehead began dripping with sweat.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up, can\u2019t continue?\u201d Lin Fan smiled while looking at the guy in front of him. \u2018Not bad, not bad\u2026 He gave me around a hundred experience. Even though the attacks, later on, became powerless and didn\u2019t really increase experience, the initial attacks were still okay.\u2019</p><br/><p>At this moment, the outer sect examination disciple looked up at Lin Fan with his eyes filled with utter disbelief. This guy, was he possibly made of steel or something?</p><br/><p>\u201cYou......\u201d Seeing the guy before him acting so arrogant, the outer sect examination disciple could feel his heart filled with indignation, but he was unable to do anything. He then roared out,</p><br/><p>\u201cBrothers, beat him to death......\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was awaiting this very moment. To achieve the 5th level of the \u300aTitanium Grade Demon Body\u300b, he would need to rely on these guys. Who knew just how many levels this \u300aTitanium Grade Demon Body\u300b had. Currently, the attacks of this group of outer sect examination disciples on his body already felt like nothing. If he were to raise the \u300aTitanium Grade Demon Body\u300b to the 100th level, then wouldn\u2019t he become invincible?</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, come at me trash, bring out all your strength.\u201d Lin Fan laughed out loud. At this point, countless numbers of fists rained down upon Lin Fan\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrat, don\u2019t get so cocky.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cToday we\u2019ll let you know our power.\u201d</p><br/><p>+2</p><br/><p>+1</p><br/><p>+1</p><br/><p>+0</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>At this moment, Lin Fan saw a guy\u2019s fist land on his body without giving any experience, and yet he stood there taking up space and acting like he was doing something. This greatly displeased Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>This guy was essentially standing there doing nothing, and thus he immediately kicked him aside, making room for others.</p><br/><p>Seeing the experience for \u300aTitanium Grade Demon Body\u300b continue to skyrocket made Lin Fan feel incredibly pleased. \u2018As expected, with more people, the experience also rises quicker.\u2019</p><br/><p>The hearts of the surrounding punching bags, who were collapsed on the ground, were further overwhelmed with gratitude seeing Lin Fan being beaten by a group of people.</p><br/><p>\u201cBig Bro, rest in peace. After you die, we will continue to remember you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWuwuu...Why do I feel like crying seeing this? From now on, you are our Big Bro.\u201d</p><br/><p>The outer sect examination disciples continued to attack mercilessly, all blows accurately hitting the mark.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrat, let\u2019s see you be cocky now. Today, we will beat you until you beg for mercy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph, how dare you challenge us. If we don\u2019t punish you today, you won\u2019t know the difference between heaven and earth.\u201d</p><br/><p>At this point, in order to receive the blows more efficiently, Lin Fan was directly lying face-down on the ground. According to Lin Fan\u2019s analysis, whether it be toes or fingers, as long as the blow was strong enough, the experience would increase.</p><br/><p>Soon...soon\u2026</p><br/><p>2850/3000</p><br/><p>\u201cJust 150 experience points left. Please give a little more effort.\u2019</p><br/><p>As for after reaching the fifth level, who knew if these guy\u2019s attacks would give \u300aTitanium Grade Demon Body\u300b any further experience.</p><br/><p>\u2018Originally, at the first level, these outer sect examination disciples\u2019 hits could bring ten experience points. But with each increase in level, the amount of experience began to decrease more and more. After reaching the fourth level, it was essentially one-two points per hit. Sometimes, there were even no points. Seems like after the level rises, a new method will be needed.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cOh crap! Who kicked my butt*ole?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, don\u2019t get too ahead of yourselves, or I will get mad.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHoly!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ding\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2018\u300aTitanium Grade Demon Body\u300b has risen to the fifth level.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cDing\u2026 Activation startup of \u2018The Strongest Upgrade System\u2019 met\u2026 Entering adjustment state\u2026will fall unconscious for 24 hours.\u201d</p><br/><p>5</p><br/><p>4</p><br/><p>3</p><br/><p>2</p><br/><p>1</p><br/><p>\u201cEntering unconscious state\u2026 \u2018The Strongest Upgrade System\u2019 entering activation mode.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>At this point, Lin Fan had lost all consciousness, but he was really looking forward to the capabilities of \u2018The Strongest Upgrade System\u2019 after its activation.</p><br/><p>Currently, the outer sect examination disciples had long exhausted all their energy. They were angry, but as for the punching bag that dared provoke them, it was likely that he had long died already.</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone stop, this guy is likely dead already.\u201d</p><br/><p>That moment, a fairly sturdy looking outer sect examination disciple, with his face completely beet-red and forehead full of sweat, called out.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, he\u2019s completely motionless. It looks like he actually died.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if it were an ox, it wouldn\u2019t be able to withstand all that beating.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, a disciple came forward and checked Lin Fan's breath, then suddenly exclaimed, \"Hey, he is still breathing! He\u2019s not dead yet!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis guy is a monster, even after all that, he\u2019s still not dead.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph, we have shown him what happens to people who act arrogant. If he dares to insult us again, we will take his worthless life.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, it\u2019s getting late. Three days later is the outer sect examination. We still need to train some more and go all out.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d</p><br/><p>When the outer sect examination disciples left the training grounds, the punching bags that had been hiding afar all hurried over.</p><br/><p>\u201cHurry, bring Big Bro back and take care of his wounds.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBig Bro is a real man! I, Ergou-dan, have never in my entire life looked up to anyone, but I respect Big Bro.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat can those outer examination disciples do. In the end, they had to group together to defeat Big Bro.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBig Bro must have trained the \u300aTitanium Grade Demon Body\u300b to the third level. Those so-called outer sect geniuses are nothing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEnough nonsense, hurry up and carry Big Bro back.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, Big Bro you must hold on!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

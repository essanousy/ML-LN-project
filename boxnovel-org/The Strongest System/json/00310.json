They had already discussed before this as to how they would divide up Jiuxiao Sect amongst themselves. And if Jiuxiao Sect had anything to say about that, they would just go with brute force.</p><br/><p>But if Jiuxiao Sect knew their place and accepted the terms, they wouldn\u2019t have minded allowing Jiuxiao Sect to continue existing.</p><br/><p>Now that another unknown presence was approaching, it looked to them as though they would be getting less of their initial share.</p><br/><p>If it were just any normal sect, they wouldn\u2019t have given a shit.</p><br/><p>But looking at the size of this gigantic battle ark, this was definitely far from a small sect.</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>Lin Fan stood on the battle ark and gazed down. The Grandmaster\u2019s battle ark was a fabulous object indeed. To think that he would arrive at the far west in just mere days! What an unrivaled speed!</p><br/><p>However, even this battle ark paled in comparison to the Roc.</p><br/><p>Thinking back at how the Roc had arrived at Glory Sect with just a flap of its wings, THAT speed was truly godly.</p><br/><p>But thinking back at the cost of summoning the Roc, Lin Fan\u2019s heart was breaking apart as well.</p><br/><p>\"Eh? There\u2019s an event going on?\" Lin Fan looked down outside the main hall of Jiuxiao Sect where a large crowd was gathered.</p><br/><p>But Lin Fan was no fool either. With the current situation right now, it was already a big deal for Jiuxiao Sect to not be torn apart by the other sects.</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>\"Senior Brother, bear with it and forget about it.\" Feng Xiaoling whispered behind Xinfeng.</p><br/><p>All of these sects were glaring at Jiuxiao Sect with covetous eyes. If they really declared war, Jiuxiao Sect might truly perish right here.</p><br/><p>Xinfeng did not reply. His heart was clearer than anyone else. But thinking back to how the glorious Jiuxiao Sect had fallen to such circumstances, his heart could not hold back the gushing sorrow.</p><br/><p>To be left with no fighting strength in the entire sect at all\u2026 If they had even a single greater celestial full cultivation being, things would be extremely different right now.</p><br/><p>But as things were, the strongest person within the sect, which was himself, was only a lesser celestial. What a tragedy this was!</p><br/><p>The Jiuxiao Sect disciples were amazed by the sight of this battle ark floating atop Jiuxiao Sect as well. What a magnificent and shiny battle ark!</p><br/><p>The 38 sects\u2019 disciples glared at the ark with envious eyes. They had never seen before such a huge battle ark in their own sects.</p><br/><p>As for the 38 Grandmasters, they looked at one another with worried eyes. Just which sect was this?</p><br/><p>Yan Hongyu\u2019s ark was platinum plated on the outside, without any emblem or indication. This was because Yan Hongyu felt that one should remain humble and keep a low profile. Even though Glory Sect was a huge sect, he would rather not show off when he was traveling out.</p><br/><p>\"Brother Xinfeng, how could you? Tsk! Not even a single notice when you\u2019re hosting a ceremony. If not for the fact that I was coming over to settle some stuff, I might not have even found out!\"</p><br/><p>The voice rang out across the skies as a shadow descended from the ark.</p><br/><p>When Xinfeng saw who it was, his face changed immediately as he rushed forward.</p><br/><p>The expressions of the 38 Grandmasters turned grim as well. They had not expected this to be Xinfeng\u2019s friend.</p><br/><p>Fine, whatever. Even then, this would not hinder their plans.</p><br/><p>As for the Jiuxiao Sect disciples, they were just getting really excited one by one.</p><br/><p>\"Holy f*ck! Senior Brother Lin is here!\"</p><br/><p>\"Shit! It\u2019s Senior Brother Lin! Hold on, hold on! I\u2019ll go get the best tea we have in our storage!\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes, hurry up and go! Now that Senior Brother Lin is here, these 38 sects can no longer remain so impertinent!\"</p><br/><p>Those disciples who knew who Lin Fan was had their indignant spirits slowly turning into joy.</p><br/><p>And of course, they knew about Senior Brother Lin\u2019s relationship with their Grandmaster! They were close as blood brothers!</p><br/><p>Feng Xiaoling\u2019s heart heaved a sigh of relief as well. He had requested for his Senior Brother to ask for Senior Brother Lin\u2019s help, but Xinfeng was adamant against it.</p><br/><p>Now that Senior Brother Lin had turned up himself, this was definitely going to turn the tides around for them.</p><br/><p>\"Brother Lin, why are you here?\" Even though Xinfeng was overwhelmed with joy at Lin Fan\u2019s arrival, he was extremely confused as well, wondering why his Brother Lin would turn up here.</p><br/><p>\"Why? Am I not welcome here? Aiyoh, look at you now! Are those the Grandmaster\u2019s robes? Nice! Impressive, impressive! Well, as a brother, it\u2019s not that I want to complain, but not informing me about a grand occasion such as your ascension? How could you do that? Now, I\u2019m a little pissed about that.\" Looking at Xinfeng wearing the Grandmaster robes, Lin Fan was extremely happy right now. At least, they were going to continue with the traditions of Jiuxiao Sect.</p><br/><p>\"Well, that's because it\u2019s just a small matter, Brother Lin! Come, come up here and sit!\" Xinfeng dragged Lin Fan by his robes.</p><br/><p>Tactful and sharp, Feng Xiaoling immediately pulled out a chair from within the main hall and placed it right beside the seat of the Grandmaster.</p><br/><p>Bloody hell, who was Lin Fan? He was the strongest person there is!</p><br/><p>Thinking back at how Senior Elder Li Yuanqi was squashed like a little ant by him, Feng Xiaoling could remember every bit of Lin Fan\u2019s dominance.</p><br/><p>Some of the Jiuxiao Sect disciples were bewildered at what was happening.</p><br/><p>\"Hey Senior Brother, who\u2019s this Senior Brother Lin guy? How come he\u2019s seated right beside the Grandmaster?\" This disciple had a low cultivation base, so he was not in the loop with many things that happened with the sect.</p><br/><p>\"Just keep your eyes peeled and keep quiet. All I can tell you is that Senior Brother Lin\u2019s presence is the downfall of these 38 Grandmasters here. That\u2019s all.\"</p><br/><p>\"Huh? Are you for real, Senior Brother? All of these 38 Grandmasters are greater celestial beings\u2026!\" The disciple replied in bewilderment.</p><br/><p>\"Ha? Greater celestial beings? I have no time to waste explaining to you, just wait right there. I\u2019ve got to hurry and get some dessert for Senior Brother Lin! Has that Junior Brother gone to prepare tea for Senior Brother Lin already?!?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes, Senior Brother, he\u2019s already rushed there\u2026\" The disciple was absolutely stunned. Looking around at his busy Senior Brothers, his mind was even more befuddled right now. All of these Senior Brothers were furious with rage just moments ago, but why were they all smiles now?</p><br/><p>All the 38 Grandmasters were extremely puzzled right now. Just who was this man who was seated beside Xinfeng right now? And the next scene was even more shocking.</p><br/><p>What were these Jiuxiao Sect disciples doing? They were\u2026crazily passionate!</p><br/><p>\"Senior Brother Lin! This is the best tea that Jiuxiao Sect has to offer!\" A disciple was propping the tea up carefully from afar before putting it down on the table beside Lin Fan courteously. In fact, he followed up by taking out a handkerchief to wipe away the water stains on the teacup.</p><br/><p>\"Senior Brother Lin! Here are some desserts!\"</p><br/><p>\"Senior Brother Lin! Are your shoulders aching? Shall I rub them for you?\"</p><br/><p>\"Senior Brother Lin! Are your feet sore? Should I help you to soak them in warm water?\"</p><br/><p>\"Senior Brother Lin\u2026!\"</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>Everyone from the 38 sects stared at this scene with their jaws wide open. Just what in the world was happening right now? Just who in the world was this person for the Jiuxiao Sect disciples to serve him as such?!</p><br/><p>Thinking back at how they were treated and how this man was being treated right now, what a world of a difference this was!</p><br/><p>Everyone from the 38 sects were thoroughly riled up right now. Did Jiuxiao Sect look down on them?!?</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was also caught in a flurry by these disciples.</p><br/><p>\"Alright, alright. What\u2019s with you guys? Your sudden passionate behavior has Yours Truly a little awkward y\u2019know?\" Lin Fan chuckled out.</p><br/><p>Standing at the side, Xinfeng also smiled out helplessly. He couldn\u2019t help but feel a tinge of jealousy in his heart. Even he himself had not received treatment as such before. To think that the arrival of his Brother Lin would cause such a commotion.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan took up the teacup and sipped carefully. \"Brother Xin, your ascension ceremony\u2019s pretty grand indeed for so many people to be present! Come, introduce them to me\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Just as Xinfeng was ready to do a proper introduction, the 38 Grandmasters looked at one another and nodded together.</p><br/><p>\"Screw the introductions. The terms we laid out previously, do you agree with it or not.\"</p><br/><p>Just then, everyone\u2019s gaze was flushed towards Xinfeng.</p><br/><p>On the other hand, Lin Fan took up a dessert as a smile curled at the side of his lips.</p><br/><p>Translator's Thoughts</p><br/><p>Lam Lam</p><br/><p>Actually, as someone who is following Lin Fan along this journey, I\u2019ve got to say I\u2019m pretty proud of him right now. As in, back when Xinfeng first appeared, I never really thought that he would care so much about this person. But now that he was taking Xinfeng as his own brother, I don\u2019t know why but it makes me really touched and it feels like our Lin Fan is really a true bro. What do you guys think?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

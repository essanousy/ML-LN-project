Although the lower graded sword wasn\u2019t worth that much, Yi Zhongyu didn\u2019t care anymore in order to maintain his pride.</p><br/><p>The surrounding outer sect disciples watching the current scene were all in amazement, this kind of situation was a first for some people. This was a fight between the sect\u2019s top ten geniuses. Even if they wanted to see one, it wasn\u2019t that easy to come across. Lin Fan stood to the side in a good mood, the more fiercely the two competed, the better for him.</p><br/><p>\u201c4000 pills.\u201d Meng Yangquan said causally. Circulation pills were a necessary medicinal pill for the newly initiated in order to train. But for Meng Yangquan, whose true cultivation base was at the sixth level pericelestial, they meant nothing.</p><br/><p>\u201c4500 pills.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cJunior brother Yi, us competing like this is meaningless. I will bid 10,000 pills.\u201d The two had been slowly raising their bid, but Meng Yangquan felt that this was a waste of time. Hene, he directly went straight to 10,000 pills.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan who was standing to the side nearly wet himself after hearing this. One pill was 100 experience, 10,000 pills would be one million experience.</p><br/><p>\u2018Holy crap, jackpot, this is a complete jackpot.\u2019</p><br/><p>The surrounding outer sect disciples were all shocked after hearing the bid as well and stared at Lin Fan with unmasked jealousy.</p><br/><p>10,000 pills for a mere lower graded sword, this\u2026this.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at Meng Yangquan, his two eyes prideful and extravagant, very extravagant. Spending that much for a single girl\u2026 At what time would a man be most attractive? The hypocritical ones would say when they were working, but what all girls really thought was that a man was most attractive when he spent money on them.</p><br/><p>Yi Zhongyu\u2019s expression became cold. He couldn\u2019t afford to bring out 10,000 pills. It wasn\u2019t that Yi Zhongyu was poor, rather he just hadn\u2019t saved up that high a number of this kind of a medicinal pill.</p><br/><p>And Yi Zhongyu wasn\u2019t foolish enough to bring out his advanced medicinal pills. Those were hard to come by even for him.</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior brother Meng is prideful, willing to spend that much for junior sister Chenyu. I will concede and take my leave.\u201d Yi Zhongyu saw that the remaining weapons on Lin Fan\u2019s stand weren\u2019t swords, so he was uninterested.</p><br/><p>\u201cJunior brother Yi, please wait a moment.\u201d Meng Yangquan said. Ying Zhongyu\u2019s expression slightly changed as he was preparing to leave, \u2018Does he perhaps want to humiliate me?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cIt looks like junior brother is in need of a lower graded sword. I happen to also have one if junior brother doesn't mind, I can give this to you.\u201d Meng Yangquan took out a sword and said.</p><br/><p>Yi Zhongyu was surprised for a bit, then said in an utterly cold voice, \u201cNo, senior brother should keep that for himself. I will take my leave.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing the enraged junior brother Yi leave, Meng Yangquan also slightly shook his head, then reached down into a pocket near his waist, \u201cJunior brother Lin, this bag contains 10,000 circulation pills.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan received the bag and was slightly startled, \u201810,000 circulation pills inside this measly bag? Stop lying!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026 discovered beginner space bag.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Used for storing items, made from small sky crystals.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cJunior brother Lin, you can also have that bag too.\u201d Meng Yangquan said.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was very joyful at this moment. He only then realized that senior brother Meng was an utterly amazing guy.</p><br/><p>\"Thank you, senior brother Meng.\u201d Lin Fan naturally didn\u2019t need this beginner space bag as he had his own bag which could store even more items than this one. But since it was a token of goodwill from his senior brother, he couldn\u2019t turn it down. So he planned on waiting for a perfect time to exchange it for circulation pills instead.</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior brother, here is the Heaven-Piercing Sword.\u201d Lin Fan handed the lower graded sword to senior brother Meng. Senior brother Meng received it and praised, \u201cNot bad! Exquisite craftsmanship! It\u2019s a lot better compared to the average lower graded sword. Just this name is a bit\u2026how about this? This sword is very sleek, and the surface is also smooth like water, I believe it\u2019s more appropriate to call it \u201cLingdong Sword.\u201d Junior sister, what do you think?</p><br/><p>\u201cI will go with whatever senior brother wants.\u201d Mu Chenyu blushed slightly and lightly nodded.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the two people, \"A beautiful sword paired with a beautiful woman\u2026 what a perfect match.\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Yangquan smiled upon hearing this. Ni Mingyang looked at him in surprise. Today senior brother smiled a lot more in front of outsiders than he usually did, it was quite rare.</p><br/><p>\u201cJunior brother, I do have to warn you though. You are actually prohibited from setting up a stall here. If the sect\u2019s patrol were to catch you, it would be a bit troublesome.\u201d Meng Yangquan said.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was startled upon hearing this, \u2018Are there perhaps law enforcement in this world too?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you for the warning senior brother, I will keep that in mind.\u201d Lin Fan clasped his hands together and gave thanks.</p><br/><p>Meng Yangquan nodded, then said to Ni Mingyang, \u201cMingyang, you stay here and help our junior brother sell the rest of his weapons. If the patrol team comes, you can also help out.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, senior brother.\u201d Ni Mingyang nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cJunior sister, let\u2019s go.\u201d Meng Yangquan said.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, senior brother.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph, succubus.\u201d When senior brother Meng left, Ni Mingyang cried out angrily. Lin Fan heard this and was shocked, \u2018Was it possible Ni Mingyang really did have some sort of relationship with senior brother Meng?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior brother, is that junior sister perhaps senior brother Meng\u2019s partner?\u201d Lin Fan asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph, she\u2018s just a succubus! Alright, enough of her. Junior brother, let\u2019s hurry up and sell the remaining two weapons. If the patrol team catches us, it will be quite troublesome.\u201d Ni Mingyang said.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright\u2026\u201d Although Lin Fan liked gossiping, for now, business was more important.</p><br/><p>Now that he had obtained 10,000 circulation pills, with just a bit more effort, he would be completely satisfied.</p><br/><p>The remaining two weapons were named \u201cMoonlit Mace\u201d and Heaven-Splitting Axe, the names of these two weapons being, of course, dominating as usual.</p><br/><p>Though the price they were sold for couldn\u2019t compete with senior brother Meng\u2019s 10,000 circulation pills, but since it was a first time sale, the items were in serious demand, and at the same time there were many rich outer sect disciples.</p><br/><p>The two weapons were sold for a total of 7,000 pills.</p><br/><p>The outer sect disciples who didn\u2019t have enough circulation pills were all regretful. With this, all the amazing lower graded weapons were gone. As for whether there would be any more next time, there was no need to think about it. Obviously, there wouldn\u2019t be more of these, lower graded weapons weren\u2019t your average vegetables after all. There was no way they could be obtained that easily.</p><br/><p>As Lin Fan was preparing to pack up and leave, a familiar voice reached his ears.</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior brother, my sword\u2026\u201d This voice sounded very pitiful and also a bit choked up. Lin Fan also felt a bit uneasy, \u201cJunior brother, you\u2019re still here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior brother, that is my sword I just received yesterday.\u201d The newly initiated junior brother was really pitiful as he spoke with teary eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, alright. A man shouldn\u2019t be crying. Wait for me here tomorrow at this time. I will compensate you with a lower graded sword. How\u2019s that now?\u201d Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior brother, you can yell at me, hit me, but you may not insult my intelligence\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan rolled his eyes, \u201cI am not insulting your intelligence. Senior brother Ni is also here as a witness, how can I lie to you?\u201d Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>In the end, due to Ni Mingyang being there, the newly initiated junior brother left half-heartedly.</p><br/><p>This also made Lin Fan feel a bit exasperated. Lin Fan also had a good item in hand, a middle graded weapon he crafted using Yin Mo Chen\u2019s broken sword.</p><br/><p>But Lin Fan didn\u2019t bring it out this time because, with just a mere outer sect, it was unlikely they could afford it. So he was planning to wait until he had entered the inner sect and met with the rich ones in there.</p><br/><p>On the way, Ni Mingyang repeatedly questioned.</p><br/><p>\u201cJunior brother, where did you get these weapons?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI made them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\"Really?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHonestly, it\u2019s not a lie.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJunior brother, you see we are also pretty close, so how about also making one for me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSure, prepare your own materials and let me steal a peach.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo problem, what kind of materials?\u201d</p><br/><p>\"Fine iron\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cHm, senior brother, where did you go?\u201d When Lin Fan had turned around, he realized Ni Mingyang had disappeared.</p><br/><p>\u201cJunior brother wait for me. I will go get some fine iron right now.\u201d From far away, Ni Mingyang\u2019s slightly excited voice could be heard.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Everyone watched anxiously, not knowing what the current situation was. Han Lu gloated gleefully within the crowds and then left.</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior brother, is it really impossible to save junior brother Lin?\u201dYin Mo Chen asked relentlessly.</p><br/><p>Li Chujun shook his head, \u201cIt\u2019s hopeless\u2026 Even the sect head wouldn\u2019t be able to do anything now. Take him and bury him.\u201dLi Chujun had experienced similar situations many times, but this kind of situation was a first.</p><br/><p>The previous outer sect competitions were all joyful, the outer sect disciples would all be satisfied. Although there were sometimes injuries, there would never be any deaths. But today, an incident had occurred.</p><br/><p>\u201cJunior brother Lin\u2026\u201d Yin Mo Chen was in disbelief, his previous lively junior was now suddenly dead, \u201cSenior brother, you have to take to responsibility for junior brother\u2019s death.\u201d Yin Mo Chen snapped.</p><br/><p>Li Chujun\u2019s expression slightly changed and he cast his sleeves, \u201cAlright, this incident is now over. I will take care of it myself\u2026 bury the person now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Feng was a seventh level postcelestial and a core disciple within the inner sect. Although no one wanted such a thing to happen, still, who would dismiss a seventh level postcelestial core inner sect disciple for a mere outer sect disciple?</p><br/><p>Yin Mo Chen was crestfallen and helpless. He understood the meaning of Li Chujin\u2019s words; this incident was now over. Yi Mo Chen lifted Lin Fan\u2019s body up, \u201cJunior brother Lin, I am incompetent, not even being able to obtain justice for you\u2026 I am so useless.\u201d</p><br/><p>On the way.</p><br/><p>The passing outer sect disciples pointed at them while whispering amongst themselves. They knew what had happened previously, and felt pity towards Lin Fan\u2019s unfortunate demise.</p><br/><p>Although the person was a bit of a scum, other than that he was alright.</p><br/><p>Ni Mingyang hastily ran over upon hearing the situation. His face paled when he saw the body on Yin Mo Chen\u2019s shoulder, \u201cJunior brother Yin, what happened to Junior brother Lin?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior brother\u2026\u201d Yi Mo Chen looked at Ni Mingyang and shook his head.</p><br/><p>Ni Mingyang lowered his head, his heart as heavy as Yi Mo Chen\u2019s.</p><br/><p>He already knew what had happened; this situation wasn\u2019t something an outer sect disciple could interfere in.</p><br/><p>The water was very deep here.</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior brother, before junior brother Lin died, he asked me to give this sword to you. Also, he asked me to give this other sword to a disciple that you know of.\u201d Yin Mo Chen\u2019s hand shook as he brought out two lower graded swords from the storage bag.</p><br/><p>Ni Mingyang looked at the sword in hand, and his eyes turned red.</p><br/><p>\u201cJunior brother Yin, we are powerless regarding this situation. We can only send junior brother Lin off respectfully.\u201d Ni Mingyang said after a moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Lin Fan\u2019s death left a considerable impact upon Yin Mo Chen.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The Saint Devil sect had nine peaks, nine peaks towering above the clouds like a celestial plane within the human realm. Each peak consisted of clean cut stone steps. Originally, outer sect disciples were not allowed to go down the mountains, but since something like this had happened, the disciples guarding the sect\u2019s entrance gave grace and let them go.</p><br/><p>The foot of the mountain was green and lush.</p><br/><p>Yin Mo Chen and Ni Mingyang dug a grave for Lin Fan under a vast tree, then slowly lowered the coffin into it.</p><br/><p>\u201cJunior brother, rest in peace. When I enter the inner sect, I will come see you.\u201d Yin Mo Chen looked at the black coffin with puffy red eyes and said.</p><br/><p>Ni Mingyang patted Yin Mo Chen\u2019s shoulder, \u201cJunior brother, one must still walk the road. Death is inevitable, our junior just left a bit earlier than us\u2026 in the future, we will meet again.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Yin Mo Chen nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s bury him.\u201d Ni Mingyang said.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>After it was all over, Yin Mo Chen and Ni Mingyang stood in front of Lin Fan\u2019s grave for a long time before finally heaving a sigh and leaving.</p><br/><p>At the moment, the surrounding was peaceful and quiet.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, in front of Lin Fan\u2019s grave, ripple patterns began appearing as if space itself was distorting.</p><br/><p>A pair of jade-like feet slowly stepped out from the distortion, and a beautiful figure appeared in front of Lin Fan\u2019s grave.</p><br/><p>The clothes of the woman were that of the Saint Devil sect\u2019s outer disciples. She raised a finger, and a flash of light appeared.</p><br/><p>The dirt covering Lin Fan\u2019s grave began rising into the air as if someone were controlling it. Gradually, a dark coffin began rising up from the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cClank...\u201d</p><br/><p>The nails sealing the coffin began dropping to the ground. The coffin opened, and Lin Fan\u2019s body floated slowly towards the woman. A trace of regret appeared on the beautiful face of the woman.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnother genius falls\u2026 the world possesses many geniuses but only a few can truly grow\u2026 what a waste of a Supreme pill\u2026hah.\u201d</p><br/><p>A sigh that ran deep sounded, giving off the impression of helplessness and loneliness.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Night.</p><br/><p>Complete silence.</p><br/><p>For the Saint Devil sect that had thousands of disciples, losing one didn\u2019t have much effect.</p><br/><p>In some people's hearts, Lin Fan\u2019s death brought pain, but for some people, who was Lin Fan? His death had nothing to do with them.</p><br/><p>Inside the sect, Yin Mo Chen lied on his bed for a long time, unable to sleep, looking at the storage bag in his hands, as if he sensed the scent of Lin Fan. Ni Mingyang obtained a martial skill from Meng Yangquan, and from today onward, he vowed to work hard to reach postcelestial stage and enter the inner sect to obtain justice for the death of Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Han Lu was joyous and poured a glass of liquor to celebrate. The arrogant Wang Tianfeng was not himself today. He lit three incense sticks in the courtyard before heaving a sigh and returning back to his room.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The next day at night.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026 system update complete.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026 unlocking true energy function.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026 martial skill classification feature.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Lin Fan, who had lied in the coffin for 24 hours, began opening his eyes. Although the insides of the coffin were pitch black, he could ignore this due to his current cultivation base.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan gave a heavy smack, and as a result, the ground shook. He then climbed out from the inside. Lin Fan took a deep breath and inhaled some fresh air. \u2018Ah, I nearly got myself killed\u2026 that was way too dangerous.\u2019</p><br/><p>Lin Fan wiped the sweat from his forehead, thinking back to what happened on the fighting stage, feeling a bit scared now.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan carefully observed his surroundings, particularly the nine peaks behind him, and then understood he had now left the Saint Devil sect.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan felt very favorable towards the Saint Devil sect, but since he was already outside, he might as well play around a bit. Once he obtained a powerful cultivation base, he would then go back and surprise them.</p><br/><p>As for Yu Feng trying to kill him, Lin Fan didn\u2019t take it to mind. One of the side-effects of \u300aMonkey Steals Peach\u300b was that the ones who had their peach stolen would feel a sudden impulse of wanting to kill the other party after all.</p><br/><p>And Yu Feng contributed greatly in helping him enter the postcelestial stage. Such a contribution, how could he not pay him back in the future?</p><br/><p>Lin Fan eagerly opened his data panel. The current system had upgraded, so he wanted to know what kind of new tricks it had, feeling extremely excited.</p><br/><p>Name: Lin Fan</p><br/><p>Level: 20 (First level postcelestial)</p><br/><p>Experience points: \uff080/2000000\uff09</p><br/><p>True Energy: 100</p><br/><p>Storage experience: 0 (Can upgrade character level, can upgrade martial skill level)</p><br/><p>Body Training Skills: \u300aEternal Demon Body\u300b 2nd level\uff08200000/4000000\uff09</p><br/><p>Mental Cultivation: None</p><br/><p>Martial Skills: \u300aMonkey Steals Peach\u300b 15th level (0/60000\uff09</p><br/><p>Tactics: None</p><br/><p>Professions: Advanced Blacksmith level two\uff081000/10000\uff09</p><br/><p>Equipment: Nine-Five Red Brick (Legendary Weapon)</p><br/><p>Title: Not conceding so just do it (Cultivation base is doubled, time limit is one incense candle, one-time use)</p><br/><p>\u2018What are true energy, mental cultivation, and tactics?\u2019 Lin Fan was clueless. However, his character level up experience had decreased and only required two million experience points now.</p><br/><p>\u2018It seems Senior brother was right\u2026 Precelestial and postcelestial are two different planes, a boundary that is very difficult to cross.\u2019</p><br/><p>Since he needed to cross the plane from precelestial to postcelestial, the amount of experience he needed would be very high. But once he crossed over, the experience would then return to normal.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan restored his grave to normal. He was dead now after all, and if he were to leave his grave like this, who knows what would happen. After that, Lin Fan ran eastward deep into the forest.</p><br/><p>There was a huge dynasty in the east, called the Great Yan dynasty. And Lin Fan\u2019s current destination was there, after all where there were people, there would be fun.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

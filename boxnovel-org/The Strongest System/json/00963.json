Liu Qingshan was truly trying to agitate him.</p><br/><p>The True Immortal Roll was a list that was set down by some almighty being from the Endless Mainland, and those on it could be considered as substitutes for True Immortals. This roll could communicate with the Heaven and Earth, and could see through one\u2019s potential.</p><br/><p>This Young Mister Xiao Yao was ranked fifteen on the True Immortal Substitute Roll, and his strength was way stronger than that of Liu Qingshan, being at the Immemorial Ancient full cultivation state.</p><br/><p>Right now, this mysterious leader that was coming along with the Earth Abyssal Flame Beasts was seeming extremely formidable. Even after using everything that he had learned over his life, Liu Qingshan wasn\u2019t even a match for him!</p><br/><p>And now that this Young Mister Xiao Yao had arrived, it brought for Liu Qingshan a glimpse of hope. If this Young Mister Xiao Yao were to just stand by the sidelines and do nothing at all, Liu Qingshan and his junior disciples might very well fall here.</p><br/><p>The thing that Liu Qingshan was most concerned about was this life of his. Within the sect, he was a genius disciple who had an unlimited potential and a great life before him. If he were to die in the hands of these beasts, he would definitely be filled with indignance in his heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cLiu Qingshan, beg me to save you and Your Young Mister will save you. Otherwise, just be prepared to get shredded by these beasts here. I reckon that your death would probably delight many people to no ends.\u201d Young Mister Xiao Yao remarked casually.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026!\u201d The face of Liu Qingshan was angered right now. But, he bore with it in his heart. Given the current situation, he had no other choice but to let Young Mister Xiao Yao have his way.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow?\u201d Young Mister Xiao Yao spread out the hand fan in his palms. There was a painting of mountains on that hand fan of his, and he gave off a sturdy and remarkable aura.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Lin Fan observed everything that was going on before him. Things seemed to be getting a little complex right now. He knew that these fellas were conversing. However, as for the general situation and topic of their conversation, he knew jacksh*t about it.</p><br/><p>But, to Lin Fan\u2019s surprise, the white-robed man actually had a cultivation state of Immemorial Ancient full cultivation level!</p><br/><p>This was something that didn\u2019t make any sense at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cBloody hell! Don\u2019t you guys know how to speak in Human tongue at all?\u201d Lin Fan hollered out.</p><br/><p>However, this single holler of Lin Fan came across as nothing but a mad roar in the eyes of Liu Qingshan and the others.</p><br/><p>Liu Qingshan felt his heart skip a beat. \u2018Where the forest lives, there will be wood to burn.\u2019 The humiliation he received today, he would definitely pay it back one day.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease render your assistance in saving me, Young Mister Xiao Yao.\u201d Liu Qingshan spoke up.</p><br/><p>\u201cHAHAHA\u2026!\u201d Young Mister Xiao Yao roared out in laughter. He then looked over at the people around him, \u201cTo think that ranking number fifty of the True Immortal Roll, Liu Qingshan, would actually beg me for help! Since that\u2019s the case, Your Young Mister here shall come forth with a heart of benevolence to save that dog life of yours!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHAHAHA\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>All the surrounding disciples burst out into laughter that was mixed with disdain as well.</p><br/><p>Liu Qingshan was filled with extreme grievances. But at this moment, there was nothing he could do about it except enduring. He had to endure through it. As for the junior disciples around him, they were feeling flustered in their hearts as well. To think that Senior Brother Qingshan would actually seek help from Young Mister Xiao Yao.</p><br/><p>However, they understood that the strength of Young Mister Xiao Yao was far from ordinary. He was someone who was ranked number fifteenth on the True Immortal Substitute Roll.</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it just the Earth Abyssal Flame Beasts? Mere bunch of ants.\u201d The face of Young Mister Xiao Yao tightened up as he smirked out. He then gave the hand fan in his palms a slight wave.</p><br/><p>And yet, that simple and casual wave of his fan burst forth with an incredibly tremendous aura.</p><br/><p>An Astral Wind swept across the Heaven and Earth just like a surging wave that gushed out to suppress all the Earth Abyssal Flame Beasts before him.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the Infinite Mountain Landscape of Senior Brother Xiao Yao\u2026 A single fan strike that bears an unpredictable amount of power!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe fates of these Earth Abyssal Flame Beasts had long been laid down. They are to become mere crystal shards. However, the leader of those beasts is somewhat strange. To think that he could actually materialize into a body.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGuys, take a look at that leader. He\u2019s just standing there motionlessly. He must have been scared silly by the aura of Young Mister Xiao Yao!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHahahaha\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The innumerable cluster of Earth Abyssal Flame Beasts roared out in fury. They could feel an extremely strong killing intent that was pushing down against them. Even though they were beasts, they possessed intellect. But at this moment, no matter how enraged they were, they could not defend against it at all.</p><br/><p>And just at this moment, Lin Fan moved steadily. Slapping out with a single palm, he shattered the Infinite Mountain Landscape.</p><br/><p>\u201cEH?\u201d</p><br/><p>The face of Young Mister Xiao Yao changed as he let out a surprised look.</p><br/><p>\u201cInteresting! To think that that leader could have held off my move. Seems like he\u2019s got some capabilities.\u201d Young Mister Xiao Yao smirked out before stepping forth as his white robes exploded out.</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, it all ends now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Young Mister Xiao Yao closed his hand fan and drew a few lines with it within the void. It was as though he was drafting out a cage from thin air.</p><br/><p>\u201cMountainous Earth Jail! Boundless caging forever!\u201d</p><br/><p>Shing!</p><br/><p>At this moment, the void vibrated out. By the time Lin Fan reacted to it, his body had been captured by a gigantic hand.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan\u2019s brows furrowed. This fella has got some skill, doesn\u2019t he?</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha! An ant will always be an ant!\u201d Young Mister Xiao Yao laughed out suavely.</p><br/><p>\u201cBravo, senior brother! Even though this beast had walloped Liu Qingshan to such a state, senior brother was still able to capture him just like that and subdue him down!\u201d The surrounding disciples cheered on.</p><br/><p>The moment Liu Qingshan heard these words, his eyes shone menacingly. Damn it! God damn it!</p><br/><p>This was a grudge that he would definitely avenge one day.</p><br/><p>Young Mister Xiao Yao curled his fingers and pulled Lin Fan over, then gripped at his throat with it, \u201cThis leader is quite something though. Interesting!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan did not resist at all. These ridiculous living beings were making him pretty curious about them now.</p><br/><p>At this moment, as Lin Fan was being gripped at his throat by Young Mister Xiao Yao, he was at an extremely close distance from this Young Mister Xiao Yao.</p><br/><p>\u201cBloody hell! Can you f*cking understand what Your Father is saying here or not?\u201d Lin Fan asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior brother, look! This beast is still roaring out. By the looks of it, he seems to be wanting to break free from your grasp, senior brother! Honestly, that\u2019s just a fool\u2019s dream!\u201d A disciple remarked.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s only natural now. What sort of an existence is our senior brother? The powerful being ranked number fifteen on the True Immortal Substitute Roll! He isn\u2019t someone that Liu Qingshan can hope to compare against!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHAHAHA\u2026!\u201d When Young Mister Xiao Yao heard the adulations of the crowd, he burst out laughing momentarily. But right at this moment, that smile of his froze up.</p><br/><p>That extremely dashing face of Young Mister Xiao Yao suddenly grimaced as though he had just received an unavoidably huge damage of sorts to his body.</p><br/><p>The only thing that could be seen right now was Lin Fan\u2019s leg that was stuck right in the middle of the Young Mister Xiao Yao\u2019s crotch.</p><br/><p>\u201cBloody hell! Just where in the world did these guys spout out from? To think that they could be THIS retarded! To think that he believed he could hold down Yours Truly with just a single hand! And not only that, allowing Yours Truly to get so close to him? Isn\u2019t this just courting death?\u201d</p><br/><p>Without saying anything more, Lin Fan deployed his True Origins Crushing Kick. This was a supreme god skill that basically crippled anyone who was struck by it no matter who they were.</p><br/><p>\u201cARGH!\u201d</p><br/><p>The face of Young Mister Xiao Yao was terrible beyond anything else right now. That initially fair skin tone of his was now flushed red like a pig\u2019s liver, as a tragic wail rang out.</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior brother\u2026!\u201d All the disciples panicked.</p><br/><p>\u201cGet the hell away!\u201d Lin Fan instantly took out his Nine Five Legendary Brick and slammed the Young Mister Xiao Yao into fainting right away, then tossed him into his Paradise.</p><br/><p>He would take a good look and do some research on this fella later on.</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan looked at the other people before him, he frowned slightly. And just as he was still trying to think of what to do, all of those disciples struck out, and countless of moves rained down on his body.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Lin Fan was thoroughly enraged.</p><br/><p>\u201cBLOODY F*CK YOUR MOTHER HOLY SH*T! YOURS TRULY DIDN\u2019T PROVOKE YOU GUYS, AND NOW YOU\u2019RE ALL COMING AT ONCE? GET THE F*CK LOST!\u201d</p><br/><p>Feeling frustrated, Lin Fan slapped out with his palm. He did not even care whether there were chicks amongst them. He just slapped all of them to death with his palm.</p><br/><p>BAM!</p><br/><p>Explode!</p><br/><p>With that, a blood mist shrouded the area.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Liu Qingshan and the others were absolutely flabbergasted.</p></div>\n</div>"}

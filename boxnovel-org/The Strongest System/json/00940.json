Wasn't the Great Sage crippled by the Old Master Thunder? Without hundred years or so, how could he have possibly recovered?</p><br/><p>But right now, it was all too late for those questions.</p><br/><p>\"Old Master Bat, hand your life over!\" After the Great Sage had recovered, he slammed out at the Old Master Bat with his most berserk attack ever. Even though the Old Master Bat was an utmost powerful being and had the confidence that his powers would be enough to defend against this, his body still exploded back as he spat out a mouthful of blood under this formidable might.</p><br/><p>His flesh and meat scattered out all over the void, \"Impossible! How could this be? How could you have recovered so quickly, you damned monkey?\"</p><br/><p>The Old Master Bat roared out in rage. A series of utmost powerful Law God Chains burst out and swiveled through the void to encircle and protect his body. However, the cudgel of the Great Sage was something far from simple. Bringing forth with it an unrivaled godly power that burst forth, even if it were the Old Master Bat or any other utmost powerful beings, they wouldn't be able to defend against it.</p><br/><p>When the Great Sage came out of the Paradise, he wielded the godly cudgel in his hands and stood tall within the world. A torrential aura infected the entire world; even the aura of the Old Master Bat had no choice but to be repressed by that of the Great Sage.</p><br/><p>\"Old Master Bat, your death day shall be today!\" The Great Sage roared out as the motion of his hands did not let up at all. Seizing the time now when he had the advantage, he was determined to have the Old Master Bat killed for sure.</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan caught sight of this, he got hurried. The Great Sage mustn't kill him!</p><br/><p>If he were killed, that would be an enormous amount of experience points gone!</p><br/><p>\"Great Sage, you make way! Let me do it!\" Lin Fan yelled out and hurried over to whack it all up. He then took out the Eternal Axe from his storage.</p><br/><p>\"Old Master Bat, your life shall be reaped in by Yours Truly!\" Lin Fan shouted out as his eyes shone with an endless brilliance. Bloody hell! All of those experience points!</p><br/><p>As long as he could take down the Old Master Bat, he was going to level up like hell!</p><br/><p>\"YOU'D DARE\u2026?\" The Old Master Bat bellowed out, and then channeled his powers, causing his flesh and blood to rumble out furiously. However, that single slam of the Great Sage was filled with his Heaven Duelling Intent, and wasn't something that could be fended off so easily.</p><br/><p>\"I'll cleave!\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan raised the Eternal Axe up high and slammed down on the flesh and blood of the Old Master Bat one cleave after another. It was as though he was a butcher chopping up pork into mincemeat right now!</p><br/><p>The Old Master Bat wailed out tragically, \"BEAST! YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A TERRIBLE DEATH\u2026!\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan used up all of his strength, and every single slam of the axe brought with it a devastating aura.</p><br/><p>Bam!</p><br/><p>Bam!</p><br/><p>Lin Fan did not care about how miserable the Old Master Bat was right now. For him, it was all just bloody experience points!</p><br/><p>However, this Old Master Bat had one hell of a resilient life indeed. To think that he wouldn't die yet after being cleaved by so many attacks of Lin Fan by now! However, none of that mattered anymore. For Lin Fan, all it meant was that it would require yet another few more cleaves, that was all.</p><br/><p>A series of tragic wails rang out through the entire world. Those sounds were extremely anguishing to hear.</p><br/><p>Right now, Lin Fan was just like a butcher that was cruelly mistreating a pitiful bat.</p><br/><p>The Old Master Bat was panicking at this moment. He hadn't thought that he would actually die in the hands of this Human. All of the utmost Laws within his body were breaking apart as though they could not deal with the chopping of the other party.</p><br/><p>\"You can't kill me! I'm an utmost powerful being! I'm the utmost powerful being of the Bat race\u2026!\" The Old Master Bat screamed out as his mental state started quivering. For countless of eras, he had never once felt fear. But, all of that was bursting out of his body at this moment.</p><br/><p>\"Please spare my life, Motherf*cking Human King! I'll never dare to do it ever again! As long as you don't kill me, I'll definitely be willing to be your slave from now on forth!\" The Old Master Bat did not wish to die. He had finally reached this level after countless of eras. How could he bear to die just like this?</p><br/><p>He wanted to conquer over the world and transcend into eternity!</p><br/><p>\"Huehue. Old Master Bat, your death shall come today. Even if you don't dare to do it ever again, that's of no f*cking use. You can just be a dead soul for Yours Truly's axe obediently!\" Lin Fan roared out in laughter. His heart was ecstatic right now. This was going to be yet another bountiful round of reaping!</p><br/><p>As long as he were to fight alongside the Great Sage hand in hand from now on, they could definitely kill more utmost powerful beings!</p><br/><p>If his strength could reach Immemorial Ancient full cultivation state, wouldn't that just be totally awesome?</p><br/><p>\"Damn it\u2026! Motherf*cking Human King, don't you get too cocky now! You'll never be able to kill Your Ancestor here! Even if Your Ancestor has to give up his lifetime of cultivation, I will definitely find a way to come back and kill you one day!\" The Old Master Bat screamed out. For him right now, there was only a single way left. He had to give up all of his cultivation of this life and reincarnate with his consciousness.</p><br/><p>\"Old Master Bat, you wish to reincarnate with your consciousness? You're just dreaming right now!\"</p><br/><p>\"Slay!\"</p><br/><p>At this moment, Lin Fan hollered out as the aura of the Reincarnation skill erupted forth furiously. That single axe sliced through time and space and slew away the past life of the Old Master Bat.</p><br/><p>\"How do you know of the Ancestral Buddha's Triple Lifetime Reincarnation Sutra?\" The Old Master Bat yelped out in shock.</p><br/><p>The greatest trump card that the Old Master Bat had was this mystic skill of the Ancestral Buddha. But, to think that this Motherf*cking Human King before him would be in possession of it as well! This was something that had the Old Master Bat revealing a look of shock.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled out. He was the very person who had scattered out this mystic skill of the Ancestral Buddha after all. And yet, this Old Master Bat here was asking him why he had it? How laughable was this?</p><br/><p>The second slaying, the slayinging of his future life.</p><br/><p>Well, the future of the Old Master Bat\u2026had no future any longer. That was because he was going to die right here today.</p><br/><p>The Old Master Bat was panicking right now. From the unknowns, he could feel two mysterious connections that were disappearing from his body right now.</p><br/><p>This damned Motherf*cking Human King had really gone ahead and slain away his past and future life!</p><br/><p>\"You\u2026!\"</p><br/><p>\"Goodbye now, Old Master Bat! The third slaying, your present life!\"</p><br/><p>Thud!</p><br/><p>An axe flash streaked through the entire world as the flesh and blood of the Old Master Bat burst forth with an incredible blood gleam before erupting out thereafter.</p><br/><p>\"YOUR ANCESTOR IS INDIGNANT! OLD MASTER THUNDER, SEEK REVENGE FOR ME\u2026!\"</p><br/><p>Right at the brink of his death, the grudges of the Old Master Bat pierced right into the Heavens. That was the last bit of his life that was transmitted into the endless void.</p><br/><p>'Ding\u2026Congratulations on killing Old Master of the Bat race.'</p><br/><p>'Ding\u2026Experience Points +\u2026'</p><br/><p>'Ding\u2026Cultivation State leveled up.'</p><br/><p>'Cultivation State: Immemorial Ancient middle level state.'</p><br/><p>At the moment of the Old Master Bat's death, the notifications of the System rang out as well.</p><br/><p>Pleasurable!</p><br/><p>This was what it truly meant to receive a bloody sea of experience points!</p><br/><p>The rise of his strength gave Lin Fan an incredibly boundless confidence towards his future.</p><br/><p>Immemorial Ancient middle-level cultivation state... Even though this wasn't the pinnacle state just yet, he knew that with his current strength, it would be enough for him to fight it out if he met an utmost powerful being.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Lin Fan found a sparkling shard that had appeared in the void. Seemed like there was even something that had popped out after killing the Old Master Bat!</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan took this in his hands, the notification from the System came through.</p><br/><p>'Ding\u2026Congratulations on obtaining Core of the Bat World. Do you wish to cultivate?'</p><br/><p>\"Cultivate!\"</p><br/><p>'Ding\u2026Congratulations on cultivation success. Obtained Bat World.'</p><br/><p>After Lin Fan cultivated the core of the Bat World, the void trembled slightly as a beam of light penetrated into Lin Fan's body.</p><br/><p>'Creator: (4/1,000).'</p><br/><p>Right now within Lin Fan's Inner World, the Bat World was revolving around the Source of Power as well. Seemed like the Old Master Bat had also cultivated the entire Bat World before he descended here.</p><br/><p>That was something that saved Lin Fan a lot of trouble.</p><br/><p>\"It's time for us to leave. That final burst of consciousness from the Old Master Bat must have alerted the Old Master Thunder and the others.\" After witnessing the death of the Old Master Bat, the Great Sage's face was calmer as though the fury in his heart had subsided by quite a bit.</p><br/><p>\"Yes.\" Lin Fan nodded his head.</p><br/><p>The strength of the Old Master Thunder was extremely formidable. If he knew that Lin Fan was here, he would definitely gather a few other utmost powerful beings.</p><br/><p>Instantly, Lin Fan and the Great Sage dove into the void and headed off into the distance.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

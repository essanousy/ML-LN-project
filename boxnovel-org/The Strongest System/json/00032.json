Lin Fan was generally fearless, but he still felt a bit scared of the eerie forest. If a ghost were to suddenly emerge, it would really be scary.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have been walking for a few hours. It should be far enough already from the Saint Devil sect. Let\u2019s take a good rest and head north tomorrow.\u201d Lin Fan found a spot and placed some tree leaves on the ground. He lied down, closing his eyes and preparing to rest up.</p><br/><p>As for whether this forest was dangerous, Lin Fan couldn\u2019t really say. Back when he was in the sect, he had only heard some rumors. The rumors said that this forest was very dangerous\u2026as for what precisely was dangerous about it, he didn\u2019t really understand since he had never experienced it before.</p><br/><p>Saasaa\u2026</p><br/><p>The surroundings were quiet. Lin Fan lied underneath a huge tree, his breathing light. In a patch of dark grass, a pair of red eyes flashed by. This pair of red eyes was filled with a vicious blood-thirst, but the sleeping Lin Fan didn\u2019t sense the gradually approaching danger.</p><br/><p>The owner of those pair of red eyes was a wild beast. The height of this wild beast was around half a human, with a horse-like tail, four rough and powerful legs, sharp curved claws, and two strands of red hair standing upright on its back. The row of sharp teeth seemed able to tear anything apart. From the front, looked somewhat like a dog.</p><br/><p>The Moon-Devouring Demon Hound was a common wild beast around the vicinity of the Saint Devil sect. If postcelestial or precelestial disciples were to run into one, they would definitely die.</p><br/><p>The Moon-Devouring Demon Hound stood mightily on the ground, its red eyes glaring at the human underneath the tree.</p><br/><p>It was previously interacting with another beautiful Moon-Devouring Demon Hound under the moonlight and was now exhausted, when it suddenly caught the scent of a human. So it naturally didn\u2019t hesitate to come over.</p><br/><p>Although wild beasts are cruel and bloodthirsty, they were still somewhat intelligent. The Moon-Devouring Demon Hound had been observing from the shadows for a long time. Its sensitive nose was able to detect the enemy\u2019s weapon and tell from the smell of a person whether they were strong.</p><br/><p>The Moon-Devouring Demon Hound had smelled Lin Fan for about a minute and came to the conclusion that this was a free dinner.</p><br/><p>The Moon-Devouring Demon Hound moved forward step by step. When it was just a few steps away from its prey, it bent its hind legs and pounced forth savagely.</p><br/><p>\u2018Clang...\u2019</p><br/><p>The Moon-Devouring Demon Hound\u2019s sharp teeth bit forth mercilessly towards its prey, but the unexpected happened.</p><br/><p>A snapping sound was heard, and the Moon-Devouring Demon Hound\u2019s teeth began chattering.</p><br/><p>'How was this possible? Once bitten by it, it\u2019s prey would normally reveal its soft and delicious flesh, but what was this current situation?</p><br/><p>At that moment, the Moon-Devouring Demon Hound became enraged. Its prideful sharp teeth couldn\u2019t even tear through a mere human, it was a complete disgrace.</p><br/><p>Bite.</p><br/><p>Bite.</p><br/><p>Bite\u2026 chomp\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026 congratulations \u300aEternal Demon Body\u300b experience + 1000.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026 congratulations \u300aEternal Demon Body\u300b experience + 1000.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The stream of system notations sounded and the sleeping Lin Fan felt his head almost explode from the racket.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo noisy.\u201d Lin Fan sat up disgruntled, but he was startled seeing the creature in front of him.</p><br/><p>\u2018Where did this dog come from?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026 discovered level one postcelestial wild beast, Moon-Devouring Demon Hound.\u2019</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was surprised. It was not like he had never heard of wild beasts before. When he became an outer sect disciple, the booklet provided by the sect had an introduction of wild beasts.</p><br/><p>They were ferocious and brutal creatures that roamed the earth, and even the weakest wild beasts were at the postcelestial stage. Aside from that, the postcelestial wild beasts held an advantage over similar cultivation level humans.</p><br/><p>Currently, the Moon-Devouring Demon Hound was becoming more and more violent, biting relentlessly onto Lin Fan\u2019s arm as if it were fighting him to the death.</p><br/><p>\u201cWoof woof..\u201d</p><br/><p>The Moon-Devouring Demon Hound then realized the human had woken up and gave a fierce howl.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the Moon-Devouring Demon Hound and blinked. Who would\u2019ve thought that even a wild beast biting him would provide experience for \u300aEternal Demon Body\u300b? Just that drool was a bit smelly and disgusting.</p><br/><p>\u201cWoof woof\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The Moon-Devouring Demon Hound became even further enraged. The black horse-like tail suddenly erupted into black flames, as if it wanted to burn this human alive.</p><br/><p>\u201cA brick to the head.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan took out the legendary \u201cNine-Five Red Brick\u201d from his bag without another word, and smacked it onto the head of the Moon-Devouring Demon Hound.</p><br/><p>The previously ferocious Moon-Devouring Demon Hound instantly fainted.</p><br/><p>Then Lin Fan brushed off his body, \u2019Too dangerous, way too dangerous\u2026 this sleeping habit still hasn\u2019t changed. Once I sleep, it\u2019s nearly impossible to wake me.\u2019</p><br/><p>Lin Fan dragged the leg of the Moon-Devouring Demon Hound while looking for a vine. If nothing else, at least he had breakfast for tomorrow.</p><br/><p>During his search for vines, whenever the Moon-Devouring Demon Hound woke up, Lin Fan would smack the brick over its head.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>When the Moon-Devouring Demon Hound woke up again, it began howling and prepared to rush forth to shred Lin Fan into oblivion. But then the Moon-Devouring Demon Hound realized it was unable to move it\u2019s limbs.</p><br/><p>\u201cShut up! You\u2019re tied up to a tree, so do you really think you can still move?\u201dLin Fan couldn\u2019t help but admire the beauty of nature. The vines he had found were strong to the point where even a postcelestial like him could not break them, quite sturdy indeed.</p><br/><p>The sky gradually became lighter. Lin Fan was completely awake now as he glanced at the Moon-Devouring Demon Hound tied to the tree, carefully observing it.</p><br/><p>Black fur covered its entire body, but the area around the stomach was white, and it was a male.</p><br/><p>\u201cA day can\u2019t be wasted. Since you took the liberty of delivering yourself, I will use you as practice.\u201d Lin Fan rolled his neck, warming up in advance.</p><br/><p>The Moon-Devouring Demon Hound looked at the human in front of him, his heart pounding rapidly. What was this human trying to do? Why was his stare even eviler than his own?</p><br/><p>\u201cWoof woof\u2026\u201d The Moon-Devouring Demon Hound howled, warning the human to not act too arrogantly.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan came in front of the Moon-Devouring Demon Hound, his eyes locked directly onto the bottom middle part of Moon-Devouring Demon Hound, and then he took a deep breath.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe training begins\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Under the ferocious stare of the Moon-Devouring Demon Hound, Lin Fan moved. The movement was completely natural, and although it was only one move, it was gradually reaching the path of true mastery.</p><br/><p>\u201cMonkey Steals Peach!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWoof!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly, a piercing cry rang through the entire forest.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026 congratulations\u300aMonkey Steals Peach\u300bexperience + 500.\u2019</p><br/><p>The moment the system notification sounded, Lin Fan smiled pleasantly. It was just like he thought, \u300aMonkey Steals Peach\u300bwas a godly technique. Any male opponent of the world would suffer greatly from it.</p><br/><p>\u201cMonkey Steals Peach.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026 congratulations\u300aMonkey Steals Peach\u300bexperience + 500.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cWoof!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Then Lin Fan began his path of experience farming.</p><br/><p>The Moon-Devouring Demon Hound\u2019s body trembled, its ferocious eyes looking confused and regretful. The bursts of piercing yelps told just how much pain the Moon-Devouring Demon Hound was in.</p><br/><p>It was getting bright. A ray of sunlight shone through the tree leaves onto Lin Fan\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the data panel. The experience of \u300aMonkey Steals Peach\u300b was now at 40,000, about 10,000 points away from leveling up.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan brushed off his hands, \u2018Let\u2019s end it here for today,\u2019 then looked towards the Moon-Devouring Demon Hound and sighed, \u2018For experience, I can\u2019t even let this mutt go\u2026 it\u2019s quite heartless\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cWoof\u2026\u201d The Moon-Devouring Demon Hound was now deeply regretful. How did it turn out like this? It then looked at the human in front and wailed loudly.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan took out a middle graded sword from his bag and looked reluctantly at the Moon-Devouring Demon Hound.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Hound, I will return today\u2019s favor in the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDing\u2026 defeated level one postcelestial wild beast, Moon-Devouring Demon Hound.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026 experience + 5000.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026 dropped unconventional martial skill \u300aBlack Tiger Steals Heart\u300b.'</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Zhang Ergou\u2019s grooming plan was slowly coming into shape within his mind. As for the specifics, he needed time to go through it thoroughly.</p><br/><p>After all, Zhang Ergou had received a huge blow in life, and was going to be reclusive for quite some time.</p><br/><p>In the evening, before the sun had set, a group of unwanted guests arrived at Nameless Peak.</p><br/><p>\"Lin Fan, the sect has nowhere else to house them. Hence, I offered them residence at yours.\" Senior Elder Wuya came and explained things personally.</p><br/><p>\"No problem! They\u2019re most welcome!\" Upon hearing Senior Elder Wuya\u2019s request, Lin Fan was delighted. He was a wonderful host. Of course, he\u2019d welcome these foreign friends with open arms.</p><br/><p>\"Rest assured that I\u2019ll take the best care of them, Elder.\" Lin Fan said solemnly. He then turned to the group of Jiuxiao Sect disciples and smiled widely as a kind host should.</p><br/><p>\"You don\u2019t have to do that either. The sparring takes place tomorrow. They\u2019ll only be here for one night.\" Wuya nodded and smiled.</p><br/><p>Even though what happened in the noon had caused Jiuxiao Sect to lose face tremendously, Wuya believed that Lin Fan did not mean it.</p><br/><p>\"Sure, no problem still. After all, it\u2019s quiet around here at Nameless Peak. Things would get lively with these guys around!\" Lin Fan then called out to Zhang Ergou, \"Hurry up and prepare the premises! Remember, bring out all of the best stuff we have for the guests!\u2019</p><br/><p>Even though Zhang Ergou was dealt a heavy blow, he hid it rather well as he headed forth with a smile on his face.</p><br/><p>\"Here, here. Senior Brothers, please follow me!\" Even though Zhang Ergou\u2019s face was somewhat pitiful, his exuberant and welcoming expression still gave off a good feeling to the guests.</p><br/><p>Xinfeng looked at Lin Fan with bitterness on his face. He was once again reminded of what had happened today. Even though the feast was sumptuous, it tasted like nothing to Xinfeng. The only thing on his mind were the events of the day.</p><br/><p>Now that he was on Nameless Peak and caught sight of this guy again, he was naturally displeased.</p><br/><p>\"Brother Yichu, please stay here temporarily tonight then.\" Senior Elder Wuya laughed.</p><br/><p>\"Alright, this seems like a pretty decent place as well. I\u2019ll let my disciples have a good rest so that they can have a good showing tomorrow.\" Liang Yichu had long thrown the earlier events to the back of his head. Even though Jiuxiao Sect had lost face earlier on, the results of tomorrow\u2019s sparring would determine the truth.</p><br/><p>To be able to regain face was something glorious as well.</p><br/><p>\"Senior Elder Wuya, leave this place to me. I\u2019ll show these guys the wonderful ways of a good host of Glory Sect. It\u2019ll be sure to leave an everlasting memory!\" Lin Fan patted on his own chest.</p><br/><p>Senior Elder Wuya nodded in approval. For the sect to have a disciple such as Lin Fan was a great fortune for Glory Sect indeed.</p><br/><p>\"Have a good rest then, Brother Yichu.\" Wuya bid Liang Yichu goodbye as he left.</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>The moment Senior Elder Wuya left, Lin Fan\u2019s face of sincere assurance changed instantaneously as he started laughing evilly.</p><br/><p>Of all places these guys could land at, they ended up at Nameless Peak. Of course, Lin Fan had to \u2018host\u2019 them nicely. Otherwise, he\u2019d let down the honor of Nameless Peak!</p><br/><p>Since the sparring was tomorrow, as a member of Glory Sect, he had to do his part to allow his fellow Juniors to obtain a good result.</p><br/><p>But, as everyone would know, Lin Fan was not a despicable, shameless and devious man. Such underhanded tricks were, of course, troubling for him.</p><br/><p>\"Master! There are so many people!\" Cai Zhiqiao clapped happily at the sight of all the crowd at the quiet Nameless Peak. Lin Fan did not say anything as he fondled his darling disciple\u2019s head. His eyes glinted as he looked at the crowd.</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>Nightfall\u2026</p><br/><p>The Jiuxiao Sect disciples were gathered in a hall as Liang Yichu was discussing tomorrow\u2019s events.</p><br/><p>\"For tomorrow\u2019s sparring, all of you need to showcase your utmost strength to obtain good results!\" Liang Yichu was extremely confident. After all, the geniuses present for this sparring this time round were all Jiuxiao Sect\u2019s elites.</p><br/><p>Especially his own disciple, who was a genius amongst geniuses. Even though the mishap in the afternoon went awry, he believed that it was just a slip of carelessness on his part.</p><br/><p>For tomorrow\u2019s stage, where the competition was going to be fair, things would be different.</p><br/><p>\"Don\u2019t worry, Elder. We\u2019ll definitely put in our very best tomorrow to obtain the highest honors!\" The Jiuxiao Sect disciples echoed together.</p><br/><p>\"Yes, very good. Head back to recharge yourselves and gather your mood. We\u2019ll go for a good one tomorrow!\"</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>Within Lin Fan\u2019s house\u2026</p><br/><p>Lin Fan, Zhang Ergou, Mie Qiongqi and Feng Bujue sat in a circle, and were deep in whispers.</p><br/><p>\"Master, what are we to do tonight?\" Zhang Ergou was clear of his Master\u2019s capabilities. For these guys to have a peaceful night at Nameless Peak, that was probably close to impossible.</p><br/><p>Looking at the brightly lit houses outside, Lin Fan let out a smile. Waving for them to gather closer, all 4 of them bent their heads in a huddle as Lin Fan whispered out his plan. In the end, the 4 of them looked at each other as each of them let out an evil laugh.</p><br/><p>The night was dark.</p><br/><p>Very dark.</p><br/><p>Nameless Peak was mostly quiet, except for the occasional chirp of the birds. The houses on the west were where the Jiuxiao Sect disciples resided.</p><br/><p>Between the houses of every disciple were a couple of other houses.</p><br/><p>Wang Yanglin was a genius of Jiuxiao Sect. While he was definitely nothing much compared to Xinfeng, he was still nothing to be scoffed at in terms of cultivation base or innate potential.</p><br/><p>Therefore, he was naturally ready for this time\u2019s genius sparring. Even though Senior Brother Xinfeng was strong, Wang Yanglin too craved for battle.</p><br/><p>Wang Yanglin was seated cross-legged on his bed in cultivation state. Streams of energy emitted from his nose as he breathed out, and swirled around his body before culminating above his head again.</p><br/><p>Just then, some noises came from outside. Alerted, Wang Yanglin shot upright as he opened his eyes wide.</p><br/><p>\"Senior Brother\u2026is it true? Do we really have\u2026ghosts on Nameless Peak?!?\"</p><br/><p>\"How would I know! But you should at least have heard of Nameless Peak\u2019s history, right?\"</p><br/><p>\"What\u2026history!!\"</p><br/><p>The men who spoke sounded extremely nervous.</p><br/><p>\"Nameless Peak used to be called Graveyard Peak and buried the bodies of disciples who died for Glory Sect. Even though their bodies have since been shifted, it\u2019s been said that when night falls, the temperature tends to dip down as these ghosts start roaming the lands\u2026!\"</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>\"Please don\u2019t scare me, Senior Brother. I\u2019m a timid man!\"</p><br/><p>\"Don\u2019t worry, even if these ghosts were to appear, they wouldn\u2019t harm you nor me. After all, we\u2019re their Junior Brothers even if they\u2019re in the afterlife!\"</p><br/><p>\"Oh, right! Right!\"</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>Even though the noises outside gradually went away, they remained ringing within Wang Yanglin\u2019s ears.</p><br/><p>Graveyard Peak? Burial grounds for disciples who had died?</p><br/><p>This\u2026!</p><br/><p>Wang Yanglin could not help but feel goosebumps appear up his neck and arms. Surveying his surroundings, the temperature did seem somewhat cold!</p><br/><p>Could there really be\u2026ghosts?!?</p><br/><p>Wang Yanglin stood up from his bed as he looked around warily...</p><br/>\n</div>"}

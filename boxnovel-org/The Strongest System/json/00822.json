After all, the three perverted sons of Chicky were pretty f*cked up. She had better not get scared into losing her mind or something if she were not mentally prepared for it.</p><br/><p>This was specially mentioned out loud for the God of the Dragon Ancestor. When he first saw Chicky, he was already not taking too much of a liking to his appearance. If he were to see those three perverted sons, wouldn't he just spit out a mouthful of old blood?</p><br/><p>\"It's my three grandsons! Why can't I take a look at them?\" Zi Feng, on the other hand, did not think that much. All she wanted to do was to see her grandchildren.</p><br/><p>\"Dearest Mummy, these three sons of mine are one better than the other! This is my proudest achievement in my entire life to have these three sons of mine!\" Chicky said in pride.</p><br/><p>\"Naturally, naturally! How can the descendants of my son be any bit poor? If our old ancestors were to find out about this, they'd be overwhelmed with joy!\" Zi Feng replied happily.</p><br/><p>Looking at how this family had already been mentally prepared, Lin Fan did not say anything more. Since they wanted to take a look, then they might as well take a good and fine look!</p><br/><p>Lin Fan let out Chicky's three sons straight from his Paradise.</p><br/><p>Instantly, a bright flash of light appeared. The moment Zi Feng saw this, she could not help but sit upright a little. She wanted to take a clearer than ever look.</p><br/><p>The curiosity of the God of the Dragon Ancestor was peaked as well. He wanted to see what sort of geniuses these three grandsons of his might be like!</p><br/><p>\"Cuckcuckoo!!!\"</p><br/><p>Before their figures had even presented themselves, their voices came through first. But, the moment the voices appeared, the heart of the God of the Dragon Ancestor froze up a little. He had a bad feeling about this. However, Zi Feng's expression was only anxious with anticipation.</p><br/><p>All of a sudden, a bright golden light blinded the eyes of everyone present. A bedazzling golden chicken stood there stood there haughtily. Tossing his head around, it was as though every single living being in this world above and beneath the Heavens must bow down to him in subservience.</p><br/><p>That rich, jewel-like aura of his coupled with those shining golden shades\u2026 This was the Baller Chicken that had appeared.</p><br/><p>\"Dearest Mummy, this is my son, Chicken Big. Doesn't he just look like a talent through and through?\" Chicky presented with satisfaction.</p><br/><p>Chicky was extremely pleased with these three sons of his. All of them had inherited his good genes.</p><br/><p>\"Good, good! Extraordinary disposition! This is undoubtedly my good grandson! Come and give your Grandma a hug!\" At this moment, Zi Feng was smiling so widely she couldn't even close her lips.</p><br/><p>\"Chicken Big, this is the Dearest Mummy of your Daddy here. So, she's your Grandma. Hurry up and go give her a hug!\" Chicky ordered.</p><br/><p>Chicken Big rubbed those golden necklaces on his neck before strutting forth while twerking his butt. He crowed out a few times and rubbed against those legs of Zi Feng.</p><br/><p>At this moment, the eyes of the God of the Dragon Ancestor were instantly dilated. It was as though his heart had just been hammered immensely. A dazzling myriad of colors shone through the world as the world was now infected with that wild chicken hairstyle.</p><br/><p>The non-mainstream Chicken Two tossed those fabulous long hair of his around and crowed out slowly. He then did a catwalk as though this was a fashion show.</p><br/><p>\"Dearest Mummy, this is Chicken Two. He stands out from the rest with his rainbow shades.\" Chicky presented proudly once more.</p><br/><p>These three sons of his were one more outstanding than the other. At times, Chicky would even lament to himself with pride. With superior genes such as his, the type of descendants that would be produced were honestly just heaven-defying!</p><br/><p>\"Chicken Two, this is your Grandma here. This is Grandpa. Hurry up and go give your Grandfather a hug!\" Chicky commanded.</p><br/><p>Chicken Two tossed his head around as that hipster hair of his covered one eye of his. He then strutted over to the God of the Dragon Ancestor through his catwalk.</p><br/><p>\"Grandpa!\"</p><br/><p>This single voice had the inner heart of the God of the Dragon Ancestor shattering instantly.</p><br/><p>Creak.</p><br/><p>He was playing with a dragon's pearl in his hands that suddenly cracked at this moment. For the God of the Dragon Ancestor, this was a blow that was way too big right now.</p><br/><p>\"My son, look at how excited your father is by looking at his grandsons! That dragon pearl was your father's favorite treasure!\" The moment Zi Feng saw this, she chuckled out.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan held up his head with a single palm. He could relate to the pain in the heart of the God of the Dragon Ancestor right now. If he had grandsons as such, he might even just take up a saber and chop them up before throwing them into the smelt for a makeover.</p><br/><p>BOOM!</p><br/><p>The moment Chicken Fat took a single step out, the entire ground trembled. Each time he appeared, there would be a piece of meat hanging from his beak.</p><br/><p>On Chicken Fat's neck was a storage ring. This storage ring contained nothing else except pieces of meat.</p><br/><p>\"Dearest Mummy, this is Chicken Fat here, the third child of your dear child. But, it's just that he's a little too good at eating. Hence, he's slightly plump.\" Chicky said.</p><br/><p>Looking at that rotund shape of Chicken Fat, Zi Feng pursed her lips and smiled.</p><br/><p>\"Good, it's a good thing that one's able to eat well! He looks better with some meat on him as well! Huang Wusheng, you lucky man! These three grandsons resemble you so much!\" Zi Feng said.</p><br/><p>The moment he caught sight of his three grandsons, the face of the God of the Dragon Ancestor was extremely pale. He had led an impeccable life, with a remarkable name for himself. And now, he felt that there was a high probability that his reputation would be ruined in the hands of these three grandsons.</p><br/><p>When he heard the last sentence Zi Feng said, the God of the Dragon Ancestor's face was entirely flushed red. He spat out a mouthful of old blood.</p><br/><p>\"Dearest Mummy, what's wrong with Daddy?\" Chicky asked.</p><br/><p>\"Your Daddy is just happy right now! This is especially the case after he saw his grandsons. Now that he has a successor, he does not have to worry over the Colossal Dragon race any longer!\" Zi Feng said.</p><br/><p>\"OH!\" Chicky nodded his head in acknowledgment.</p><br/><p>The God of the Dragon Ancestor felt as though he must have sinned gravely in his past life for him to have three perverted grandsons like these.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked over at the God of the Dragon Ancestor and cast him a consoling gaze. While others might not understand the pain of the God of the Dragon Ancestor, Lin Fan understood.</p><br/><p>The God of the Dragon Ancestor had an unparalleled potential, and was the leader of the Colossal Dragons race! But now, he suddenly had a son popping out of nowhere? If his son didn't look like him, so be it. But, what in the world was up with these three grandsons right now?</p><br/><p>One bloody baller who was just wearing gold and silver all over!</p><br/><p>One non-mainstream hipster with all sorts of colors!</p><br/><p>One that was as fat as a mountain, with meat hanging off his beak!</p><br/><p>Each one of them was so damned perverted! If the outside world were to catch wind of this, he would definitely end up as the laughing stock for everyone!</p><br/><p>The heart of the God of the Dragon Ancestor was going through an immense rollercoaster right now. Even if his cultivation state were beyond the Heavens, this was a moment he could barely endure any longer.</p><br/><p>Swipe\u2026 swipe.</p><br/><p>At this moment, the God of the Dragon Ancestor realized that there was a single head that was swiping left and right around at the bottom of his pants. When he looked down, he spat out a mouthful of blood once more.</p><br/><p>Chicken Fat had swallowed that piece of meat at his beak. His beak was then covered with oil stains, which he wiped directly at the bottom of the God of the Dragon Ancestor's pants. This saved him a lot of trouble!</p><br/><p>When the both of them exchanged glances, that innocent looking Chicken Fat opened his eyes widely. As though he could hardly take in all that love from his Grandpa's endearing gaze, Chicken Fat stuffed his head right up the pants of his Grandpa coquettishly.</p><br/><p>He was so bashful right now\u2026!</p><br/><p>At this moment, God of the Dragon Ancestor leaned onto a pillar. His face held an expression that no longer bore any hope for life.</p><br/><p>'What type of sins has Your God here ever committed?'</p><br/><p>The God of the Dragon Ancestor had an urge to slap all of these grandsons to death. However, he did not dare to do it, nor could he bear to.</p><br/><p>That was because he could truly sense that the bloodlines of these three grandsons were extremely similar to his. They all came from the same source.</p><br/><p>However, there was something that bugged the God of the Dragon Ancestor. The bloodlines of his three grandsons seemed a little mixed up.</p><br/><p>\"My son, why is my daughter-in-law not around?\" At this moment, Zi Feng asked.</p><br/><p>When Chicky heard this, it was as though he had suddenly recalled something as his mind pondered. He then replied sadly, \"Dearest Mummy, she's dead\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

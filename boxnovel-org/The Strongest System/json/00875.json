This bloody Earth did not give birth to any Heaven's Will at all! Otherwise, how could the Human race be this weak?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at everything before him. The space was dusky, and gray currents were seeping out all around a small little void.</p><br/><p>Within that void was a spherical light ball that floated gently. On the surface, there were mysterious runes that were etched on it while faintly giving off an aura of the Heaven's Will. On the inside, the Heaven's Will was still slowly gathering and brewing.</p><br/><p>If Earth truly had a Heaven's Will, the power level of the Human race would have skyrocketed back when the Insect race descended down. How else would there be a situation where the Humans were being oppressed so badly?</p><br/><p>But, even though the Earth hadn't given birth to a Heaven's Will yet, to Lin Fan, there was still something really odd about the Earth.</p><br/><p>For it to be able to block out powerful beings from coming in, just that capability alone was something one could not deny.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan's cultivation state right now was at the Divine celestial level 10, Eternal God state. But, he was no ordinary Eternal God state being. Therefore, breaking through this barrier was naturally something he could do with ease.</p><br/><p>And right now, the only thought on Lin Fan's mind was to cultivate the entire Earth under him. This Creator tag was something that had followed him for a long time now. And yet, he had only cultivated a single world under him. That was something pretty awkward now.</p><br/><p>Since Earth hadn't even given birth to a Heaven's Will, cultivating it would be something of extreme ease for Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Instantly, a power of refinement burst forth, wrapping around the entire Earth.</p><br/><p>And just as Lin Fan thought that everything was coming to completion, numerous black God Chains burst forth from that ball of light all of a sudden.</p><br/><p>These God Chains were extremely thick, and brought with them a boundless aura. They caused Lin Fan's power of refinement to dissipate immediately.</p><br/><p>\"Eh? There seems to be a problem.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan's face changed, feeling somewhat incredible. This was something that had shot right through Lin Fan's expectations! How in the world could something like this happen when he was trying to cultivate Earth that had no Heaven's Will?</p><br/><p>\"Holy f*ck! Playing mysterious and all! Yours Truly will just have to see how mysterious you can get!\" Lin Fan was indignant right now. If he couldn't even cultivate a single Earth that had no Heaven's Will, wouldn't he just be a laughing stock if word of this were to get out?</p><br/><p>\"Reform Buddha Lord!\"</p><br/><p>\"Great Buddha's Light of Purification!\"</p><br/><p>\"Power of the Creator!\"</p><br/><p>At this moment, Lin Fan's body burst forth with three massive powers that struck out at these God Chains.</p><br/><p>\"Yours Truly refuses to believe that I can't cultivate you!\"</p><br/><p>BOOM!</p><br/><p>A loud explosion boomed out as the entire void exploded out. That gray current went all berserk in a sudden.</p><br/><p>The God Chains started emitting out a series of godly glows and blocked out all three of Lin Fan's massive powers. This was pretty tyrannical now.</p><br/><p>\"Aiyoh! Your Buddha Lord truly refuses to believe that he can't even reform a single ball of light!\" The Reforming Buddha Lord came forth from the Paradise and rolled up his sleeves, all ready to go for a good fight.</p><br/><p>\"Just get the hell over.\" Lin Fan did not say anything more and pulled the Reforming Buddha Lord into the space immediately. Bloody hell! This mother*cker was still putting on an act at such a critical moment!</p><br/><p>Couldn't he see that even with the tremendous strength of Yours Truly, Yours Truly still could not take down the other party? What fart use could a mere Buddha Lord such as him be!</p><br/><p>But right at this moment, something that shocked Lin Fan happened. That bright ball of light started spinning rapidly as a black vortex appeared in Lin Fan's face.</p><br/><p>\"What?\" Lin Fan was stunned, not knowing what was going on. All of a sudden, a crazy suction force appeared and burst forth.</p><br/><p>\"Holy f*ck!\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan's body could no longer hold steady as he was sucked into it.</p><br/><p>Right now, Lin Fan was a Divine celestial level 10, Eternal God state powerful being! But, to think that he could even stand firm against a vortex! If word of this were to get out, would anyone believe it?</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan next opened his eyes, he checked out his surroundings warily. All of a sudden, his face changed into one of disbelief.</p><br/><p>\"Just where in the world is this?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan had not expected for Earth to be this odd and have a place such as this!</p><br/><p>His surroundings were pure chaos, yet there wasn't even a single peep of sound, nor was there any Spirit Qi. It was as though this was just an empty void that didn't exist.</p><br/><p>Shing!</p><br/><p>At this moment, the void shimmered. Lin Fan stumbled backward, thinking that something was about to happen.</p><br/><p>But to his surprise, a tombstone appeared before his face!</p><br/><p>'Tomb of the Great Sage, Equal of Heaven of the Monkey race.'</p><br/><p>\"Holy f*ck! Isn't this just Sun Wukong? This is some mother*cking big sh*t!\" Lin Fan was stunned and had a strange look on his face. Just what in the motherf*cking world was all this?</p><br/><p>And just as Lin Fan was ready to examine it properly, the void started trembling out once more.</p><br/><p>In front of Lin Fan's very eyes, more tombstones started appearing.</p><br/><p>When he saw the names on the tombstones, his mind was practically blown away\u2026</p><br/><p>'Tomb of Nuwa, the Mother Goddess of the Snake race.'</p><br/><p>'Tomb of Lucifer God of the Wings race.'</p><br/><p>'Tomb of Rulai Buddha of the Buddha race.'</p><br/><p>'Tomb of King Kua Fu of the Giant race.'</p><br/><p>'Tomb of Father Huang Zhang of the Succubus race.'</p><br/><p>'Tomb of Ancestor God Ying Long of the Dragon race.'</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Lin Fan blinked his eyes, feeling that everything was so damn bloody strange. All of these dense clusters of tombstones lined the void. But all of a sudden, Lin Fan's face changed as though he had just discovered something shocking.</p><br/><p>Underneath these tombstones were many black tombstones. All of these tombstones gave off an endlessly sinister aura of bloodlust, gloom, and cruelty.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan focused his attention over. When he caught sight of the text on the tombstones, he nearly jumped right where he was.</p><br/><p>'Tomb of the Dimension Devil Yang Mei of the Ancient race.'</p><br/><p>'Tomb of the Death Devil Shi Yan of the Ancient race.'</p><br/><p>'Tomb of the Extreme Yin Devil Yin Ming of the Ancient race.'</p><br/><p>'Tomb of the Extreme Yang Devil Yang Zhuo of the Ancient race.'</p><br/><p>An endless number of devils ranging from soul devils to destructive devils\u2026</p><br/><p>All of these dense tombstones had Lin Fan gulping down his saliva.</p><br/><p>\"I seem to have stumbled across someone outrageous.\" Lin Fan did not fear the Heavens or the Earth. But at this moment, he could feel himself almost jumping at the sight of this many tombstones.</p><br/><p>They were not bloody taking him for a ride now, were they?</p><br/><p>Weren't these the 3,000 Devils? The characters of the legends told on Earth?</p><br/><p>All of a sudden, Lin Fan's mind turned towards a single Devil. If this were also a Devil of the Ancient race, he would have really f*cked it up big time this time around.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked around. Out of the black tombstones, there were a total of 2,999. There was one short.</p><br/><p>He then looked at the tombstone right on top. All of a sudden, he found the one he was looking for.</p><br/><p>'Tomb of the Power Devil Pangu of the Ancient race.'</p><br/><p>\"Just what the f*ck is going on right here? Why the hell are there so many tombstones? Aren't these all things that should belong in the legends? Why the hell are they all connected with the Ancient race?\"</p><br/><p>At this moment, Lin Fan felt an extremely huge headache. Back when he had crossed over to the Xuanhuang World, Lin Fan had always thought that he was living in a parallel universe.</p><br/><p>But right now, he realized that something was off.</p><br/><p>There were so many hidden powerful beings on Earth. And at the same time, all of the legends and tales were always told with such fluency that they had always seemed to be real.</p><br/><p>If that were the case, there was only a single possibility right now\u2026Everything must have been\u2026real!</p><br/><p>\"Holy f*ck! A single look and one can tell that all of these are invincible characters! If they were to all awaken just like that, wouldn't Yours Truly turn into a weak chicken in their faces?\"</p><br/><p>\"No please\u2026!\"</p><br/><p>At this moment, Lin Fan could not be bothered with anything else other than his own safety.</p><br/><p>He had finally gotten to a Divine celestial level 10, Eternal God state after much difficulty, and was at a point where he could kill any gods that stood in his path. But all of a sudden, when Lin Fan caught sight of all of these sick tablets, even that gut of his could barely handle everything right now for a moment or so!</p><br/><p>Suddenly, the tombstones vibrated.</p><br/><p>\"It can't be, right\u2026?!\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan could only stand there watching blankly, feeling as though he had just done something absolutely outrageous. But to be honest, what the f*ck did he even do to begin with\u2026?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

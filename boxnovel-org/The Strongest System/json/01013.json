When you use it against your enemies, there will be a force of a legion standing behind you. Even if it were a True Immortal state being, they would definitely be repressed down by a Killing Qi if they were sucked into it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is a Supreme Grade Utmost Treasure, the Green Skies Blue Robe. It can defend against a single full powered strike of a True Immortal state being.\u201d</p><br/><p>The elderly man introduced a variety of treasures for Lin Fan. When Qiu Zhanyu and Jin Zhengu caught sight of these treasures, they were completely bedazzled. These were good stuff here!</p><br/><p>But, Lin Fan did not have much of an interest in them. He could craft out these treasures here as well. And, even if he couldn\u2019t, these were merely decorative items for him that wouldn\u2019t be able to make it on the battlefield at all.</p><br/><p>When the elderly man noticed how Lin Fan didn\u2019t seem to have too much of an interest towards these items, he led them to yet another area.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?\u201d</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan caught sight of the items before him, his interest was piqued.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is a strand of Lower Grade Immortal Herb, the Blue Skies Yellow Hell Grass. Born from the Yellow Hells Dead Grounds, this is something good for cultivating pills.\u201d The elderly man said.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan took a quick glance at the price: 1,000,000 Immortal Crystals. This was a little expensive. But of course, the price was expensive for most other people, but not for Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Ordinary Pill Cultivation Masters would not be able to achieve a success rate of hundred percent when using Immortal Herbs to cultivate pills. Therefore, spending such a huge amount of money to purchase an Immortal Herb would be a tremendous loss if they failed in their attempt.</p><br/><p>\u201cGive me ten of this.\u201d Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>\u201cSure!\u201d The elderly man nodded his head.</p><br/><p>They then continued to shop around. Nothing else caught Lin Fan\u2019s attention other than Spirit Herbs and Immortal Herbs.</p><br/><p>Eventually, after making a full round of the entire place, there was nothing left of the 60,000,000 Immortal Crystals.</p><br/><p>However, Lin Fan was satisfied right now. He had bought so many herbs and could cultivate out plenty of pills.</p><br/><p>Right now, he was a Mystic Immortal full cultivation state being. If he could break through to the Golden Immortal state, that would definitely be a soar into the Heavens as he would become an overlord of a part of the world.</p><br/><p>After the elderly man sent Lin Fan off, he returned to his house.</p><br/><p>Nan Yangzi entered and asked, \u201cSir, I could have attended to them earlier on. Why did you have to go through the trouble to attend to them personally?\u201d</p><br/><p>The elderly man looked at Nan Yangzi and chuckled out, \u201cIf I hadn\u2019t been the one attending to them personally, how would I know what herbs he had bought as well as the quantity?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSir, your subordinate here doesn\u2019t understand.\u201d Nan Yangzi asked again curiously.</p><br/><p>\u201cEvery single strand of herb, as well as the quantity, has been remembered in my heart. With that, we can try to cultivate out the pills that he was selling. Also, we can also have a rough grasp of the ratio required for the herbs to turn into pills.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf our Shen Yuntian Trade Association can cultivate a pill of this quality, what else would that Jun Baoxuan Trade Association have to compete with us?\u201d The elderly man said.</p><br/><p>When Nan Yangzi heard this, he came to a realization, \u201cSir, your foresight is brilliant!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha.\u201d The elderly man laughed out.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, should I send people to follow those three from earlier on?\u201d Nan Yangzi asked.</p><br/><p>The elderly man waved it off with his hand, \u201cNo. The cultivation state of that man is higher than mine. Furthermore, he is a huge client of ours. If we were to piss off the other party, the losses would be immense.\u201d</p><br/><p>If Lin Fan had known that this elderly man had placed so much emphasis and passion toward him, he would have definitely exploded out.</p><br/><p>Cultivate your mother\u2019s pills!</p><br/><p>All of those herbs that Lin Fan had purchased were based on which ones were the cheapest or which ones had more uses.</p><br/><p>In fact, the type of pills that could be cultivated from them was something that even Lin Fan himself might not know just yet.</p><br/><p>If he didn\u2019t have the System, with his current strength, there was no way Lin Fan could cultivate out pills of this level. The elderly man could just wait to fail for now!</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cBig Bro, what are we buying so many herbs for?\u201d Qiu Zhanyu asked.</p><br/><p>Right now, he was thoroughly impressed with Lin Fan to every single fiber of his body. He felt that he had truly not followed the wrong person.</p><br/><p>This Boss of theirs was simply way too tyrannical!</p><br/><p>\u201cCultivate pills.\u201d Lin Fan chuckled out.</p><br/><p>For Lin Fan, those 60,000,000 Immortal Crystals had no use at all. They were not even as valuable as these herbs here.</p><br/><p>Soon, they found a hotel and settled in, and Lin Fan dove right into his trade of cultivating pills straight away.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan tossed all the Spirit Herbs and Immortal Herbs within a single pot.</p><br/><p>Sizzle, boil, crackle!</p><br/><p>Pills Through Thought purged out all the impurities within those herbs.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026Congratulations on pill cultivation success.\u2019</p><br/><p>Opening the pot, a series of sparkling pills floated out within the void. Lin Fan grabbed a bunch of those pills and stuffed them into his mouth.</p><br/><p>Crunch, nom, munch!</p><br/><p>Pleasurable!</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026Experience Points +10,000,000.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026Experience Points +30,000,000.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026Experience Points +50,000,000.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Continuous and endless, the experience points rose up in a never-ending fashion. Lin Fan could feel as though he was about to fly up into the sky right now.</p><br/><p>This feeling was simply way too pleasurable.</p><br/><p>The 60,000,000 Immortal Crystals spent were simply way too worthwhile!</p><br/><p>\u201cMy experience points have grown by 10%. That\u2019s pretty decent now.\u201d Lin Fan nodded his head in satisfaction. He then took the two remaining Lower Grade Immortal Pills in his hands and opened up the door before heading over to the side of Qiu Zhanyu and Jin Zhengu.</p><br/><p>The Lower Grade Immortal Pills that Lin Fan had cultivated were not pills that the normal Lower Grade Immortal Pills of the Endless Mainland could compare with! The difference between the two was immense.</p><br/><p>\u201cThese two pills here\u2026 both of you can have one each.\u201d Lin Fan handed over the pills to Qiu Zhanyu and Jin Zhengu.</p><br/><p>They could be considered as his Little Bros now. So, he naturally had to give them some benefits.</p><br/><p>When Qiu Zhanyu and Jin Zhengu caught sight of the pills before them, they let out a startled expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre these Immortal Pills?\u201d</p><br/><p>When both of them saw how there were threads of the Law of the Immortal Dao on the surface of the pills, they naturally knew that these were genuinely Immortal Pills!</p><br/><p>The two of them looked at Lin Fan in disbelief, and were so emotional that they were about to cry out right now.</p><br/><p>\u201cBig Bro, you\u2019re simply way too nice to us!\u201d Qiu Zhanyu and Jin Zhengu remarked emotionally.</p><br/><p>\u201cWith this Immortal Pill, you guys will not be able to unleash its full potential for a moment or so. Let me use it for you guys then.\u201d Lin Fan swept out his robes and deployed the Source Sealing Technique, causing the entire room to be sealed, so as to prevent even a slight bit of aura from leaking out.</p><br/><p>If he were to unleash it for them, they would be able to break through to the True Immortal state.</p><br/><p>Qiu Zhanyu and Jin Zhengu were both at Immemorial Ancient state upper level. Because they did not have too many martial arts mystic skills with them, leveling up to the next phase did not pose much of an issue.</p><br/><p>They sat cross-legged, filled with excitement.</p><br/><p>When an Immortal Pill entered one\u2019s tummy, their lives were controlled by themselves, and not by the Heavens anymore.</p><br/><p>This was the mystifying effects of Immortal Pills.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan\u2019s powers rumbled out furiously as they were infused into the bodies of both of them.</p><br/><p>Given their current strength right now, there was no way they would be able to make use of the Immortal Pill completely right now. That required every single fiber and powers of theirs to strike out at the Immortal Pill at every single second and moment.</p><br/><p>However, with Lin Fan\u2019s help, they were able to shatter the Immortal Pill and turn it into a stream of boundless medicinal power.</p><br/><p>The powers then guided them along, allowing the medicinal power to cruise through their entire bodies and fill up their limbs.</p><br/><p>The aura of Qiu Zhanyu and Jin Zhengu rose up furiously as their bodies shuddered along with it as well. Their skin seemed as though it was burning with fire, flushing red all over their body.</p><br/><p>\u201cLevel up!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan roared out, causing the medicinal powers to enter every single cell of the two.</p><br/><p>Immemorial Ancient state full cultivation state\u2026</p><br/><p>Their auras were still rising; this was not the end yet.</p><br/><p>Within the Inner Worlds of both of them was a Heaven and Earth Door that opened up. But, compared to Lin Fan\u2019s Heaven and Earth Door, theirs was simply way too insignificant.</p><br/><p>A surge of powers galloped out and rammed at the Heaven and Earth Door.</p><br/><p>BAM!</p><br/><p>With a loud bang, the Heaven and Earth Door opened up. Qiu Zhanyu and Jin Zhengu had truly entered a True Immortal state right now.</p><br/><p>The Laws of the True Immortal wrapped around them, which was the sign of a True Immortal.</p><br/><p>Done!</p><br/><p>Without Lin Fan\u2019s help, if they both wanted to enter the True Immortal state, they would have had to go a long, long way still.</p><br/><p>But, as Lin Fan\u2019s Little Bros, this was the type of welfare they could receive.</p></div>\n</div>"}

This made many outer sect disciples fear for themselves, not knowing when the crazy peach stealing demon would target them.</p><br/><p>And lately, many strange incidents have been occurring in the outer sect. In a single night, entire walls were stolen. This made everyone wonder who in the world would go and steal bricks?</p><br/><p>Some disciples feared they would end up like Fang Han, waking up and discovering their entire house had disappeared. So before going to sleep, they would set up bells around their walls. If the wall demolition thief appeared and triggered the traps, they would be sure to capture him on the spot.</p><br/><p>\u201cGuys be careful, the crazy peach stealing demon has come.\u201d At this moment, the peaceful outer sect dining hall broke into an uproar because one disciple had discovered that the crazy peach stealing demon was heading their way. Several outer sect disciples had suffered his attacks and had been reduced to lying in their rooms for the entire day, unable to move. This kind of pain was completely unbearable for an ordinary person.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan, who was carrying a big bag, walked over from afar. To the fellow brothers that were avoiding him, Lin Fan paid them no heed, because he believed in a few moments they would all come running over to him begging and revering him as a treasure.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan then came to an empty spot next to the dining hall entrance and lowered the bag he was carrying. He then took out a banner from within his chest and tied it to one of the entrance pillars.</p><br/><p>\u201cThose who are passing don\u2019t miss out. Lower graded weapons flash sale\u2026\u201d Lin Fan stood there and shouted. The surrounding outer sect disciples saw him crazily shouting and expressed their disdain, but upon hearing the words \u2018lower graded weapons flash sale,\u2019 they all became enticed.</p><br/><p>At this point, though the surrounding outer sect disciples were attracted by Lin Fan\u2019s words, not a single person dared to step forth to ask, as they were afraid that upon being attracted over, their peaches would be stolen.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shouted with all his might, and seeing that he had caught everyone\u2019s attention, he nodded in satisfaction. But a certain matter left Lin Fan speechless, \u2018Why aren\u2019t any of these guys coming forth? Perhaps low-grade weapons aren\u2019t attractive enough?\u2019 Lin Fan knew that for outer sect disciples, possessing a graded weapon was an extremely impressive feat.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan refused to accept this and started glancing around, then found a disciple who was standing near him. \u201cYou, come here\u2026\u201d Lin Fan beckoned.</p><br/><p>That disciple froze for a bit and retreated a few steps in fear, but Lin Fan did not give him a chance and directly went forth and started dragging him. \u201cCome with me.\u201d Lin Fan wanted to make this guy believe his words.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, senior brother, I just entered the outer sect a few days ago. Please don\u2019t steal my peach.\u201d The outer sect disciple dragged by Lin Fan was scared stiff. Although he had just entered the outer sect, he was familiar with the dining hall\u2019s infamous crazy peach stealing demon.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan rolled his eyes, not caring how this junior brother cried or begged, and directly dragged him in front of his stand, then removed the sect weapon on his back.</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone take a look, behold, this is the weapon made by the outer sect blacksmith.\u201d Lin Fan held the weapon up high while shouting and then picked up a sword from his stand.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow look over here, this is a lower graded weapon. You are about to witness a miracle, so don\u2019t blink.\u201d Lin Fan glanced at the outer sect disciples whose interest he had attracted and smiled, \u2018I refuse to believe you all aren\u2019t interested.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cWatch carefully\u2026\u201d Lin Fan shouted out as the two swords clashed.</p><br/><p>\u2018Clang\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>The sword crafted by the outer sect blacksmith was instantly sliced into two pieces, as one piece fell to the ground nosily.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow\u2019s that? There are only three, to the highest bidder.\u201d Lin Fan then threw the other piece of the broken weapon onto the ground before returning to his stand, awaiting everyone to rush up.</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior brother, my sword\u2026\u201d The junior brother who saw his weapon being sliced into two by his senior brother was about to cry.</p><br/><p>\"Your sword is my sword\u2026\u201d Lin Fan replied with indifference. It was then that the surrounding outer sect disciples who were watching all came rushing forth crazily. They had all seen clearly what had just happened. The weapon crafted by the outer sect blacksmith had been easily sliced in half as if it was slicing through clay.</p><br/><p>At the same time, the sword gave off a shiny and sleek appearance. It was obviously a graded weapon from one glance.</p><br/><p>\u201cJunior brother Lin, how are you selling this sword?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJunior brother Lin, you name a price I\u2019ll buy it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>At this moment, seeing the outer sect disciples scrambling in front of him, Lin Fan let out a bright smile within his heart, \u2018I already said Yours Truly would become a hot commodity.\u2019 It was difficult to rely on them to level up now, so he could only rely on medicine, \u2018When Yours Truly reaches postcelestial and applies for admission into the inner sect, at that time this entire world will be mine to enjoy.\u2019</p><br/><p>At the same time, Lin Fan also expressed deep resentment for these despicable disciples who hadn\u2019t broken through to the postcelestiial stage yet, \u2018It\u2019s because of these guy Yours Truly has such difficulty leveling up.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Heaven-Piercing Sword, starting off at thirty circulation pills, goes to the highest bidder\u2026\u201d Lin Fan held up the sword in his hand and shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Heaven-Piercing Sword, what a good name! Such domination! I must have this sword.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI bid thirty-one pills.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph, only thirty-one pills and trying to get a lower graded weapon! In your dreams, I bid forty pills.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cForty-five pills.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFifty pills.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing his fellow brothers fiercely bidding away, Lin Fan gave off a brilliant smile within his heart, \u2018Just slightly fix up a pile of scrap metal and I can then sell it. This is such a steal!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cI bid one hundred pills.\u201d</p><br/><p>As soon as this person shouted out one hundred pills, everyone went silent. The outer sect disciples were able to collect thirty circulation pills each month. Though the circulation pill was a common item in the outer sect, because it was a pill that assisted with training, many disciples usually just ate them all within the days. So, very few disciples saved up that many.</p><br/><p>\u201cOne hundred and fifty pills.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan glanced at the disciple that bid one fifty pills. He had never seen him before. Although he stood there calmly, Lin Fan could tell from his eyes the desire he had for this sword. Though Lin Fan had only been in the sect for more than a year, he still understood one thing.</p><br/><p>In this world, everyone only cared about one thing.</p><br/><p>There was no end to cultivation, to begin with, so who would spend time cultivating something else? Cultivators were cultivators, blacksmiths were blacksmiths, alchemist were alchemist\u2026</p><br/><p>Cultivation didn\u2019t have much to do with becoming the last two unless one was one of those top level experts whose cultivation base had already reached a certain level and couldn\u2019t go any further in the meantime. Only then would one usually focus on other areas.</p><br/><p>Though the Saint Devil sect was a big sect, they still couldn\u2019t provide every disciple with a graded weapon.</p><br/><p>\u201cTwo hundred pills.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTwo hundred fifty pills.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The bidding became very intense. Lin Fan realized many disciples weren't bidding and were only silently standing there watching. It seemed like they were waiting for the next weapon.</p><br/><p>\u201cOne thousand pills\u2026\u201d And at this time, a man wearing white robes who was standing far away slowly walked over. The expressions of the surrounding outer disciples changed instantly upon seeing this person. Then everyone stepped aside, opening a path while staring in awe.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s senior brother Yi.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOne of outer sect\u2019s top ten geniuses, Yi Zhongyu.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLooks like there is no hope for us. Since senior brother Yi has bid, there is no room for us. If we continue senior brother Yi will take offense.\u201d</p><br/><p>Many onlooking outer sect disciples understood that this lower graded weapon now had a master. But at this moment, Lin was thinking of one problem, \u2018Isn\u2019t this a loss for me?\u2019</p><br/>\n</div>"}

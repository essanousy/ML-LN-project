He was entirely fine though. \u2018Looks like staying inside this sect to level up is rather unreliable. I should probably think about going outside and trying my luck. But the sect rules state outer sect disciples aren\u2019t allowed to leave the mountain\u2026 this is also quite troubling.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cHehh\u2026\u201d Lin Fan sighed, then dumped the medicinal pill left by senior brother Ni onto his hand.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026 discovered healing medicinal pill, \u201cRejuvenation pill,\u201d after ingestion, experience + 50.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Rejuvenation pill: Saint Devil Sect\u2019s common medicinal pill, made from blue vanilla extract.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cHehh\u2026\u201d Lin Fan sighed once again, then stuffed the medicinal pill into his mouth and gulped it down instantly. Lin Fan then opened up his character data panel.</p><br/><p>Name: Lin Fan</p><br/><p>Level: 11 (Second level precelestial stage)</p><br/><p>Experience points: (7000/50000)</p><br/><p>Martial Skills: \u300aTitanium Grade Demon Body\u300b 19th Level (6000/2000000)</p><br/><p>\u300aMonkey Steals Peach\u300b 10th level (1400/10000)</p><br/><p>Title: Not conceding is dry (Cultivation base is doubled, time limit is one incense candle, one-time use)</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the experience of\u300aTitanium Grade Demon Body\u300b and felt his head hurt, \u2018Two million experience! Relying on these outer sect disciples to beat me up will take me years.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cHehh\u2026\u201d Lin Fan sighed yet again, and then closed his eyes, deciding to take a good rest and wait till nighttime before proceeding.</p><br/><p>After an unknown amount of time passed\u2026</p><br/><p>Lin Fan sensed a light scent within his room; this light scent made Lin Fan very suspicious. \u2018I am a straight up man, so I never use goods like perfume. Where in my room would this scent come from?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Strange\u2026 strange.\u2019 Lin Fan opened his eyes, and there was not a single soul inside his room, not even a ghost. \u2018Hm, then this light scent, where is it coming from? Perhaps it\u2019s some girl who snuck into my room, trying to take advantage of me being asleep and take off my pants, lift up my brother and turn the world upside down?\u2019</p><br/><p>Upon thinking this Lin Fan felt a bit scared, then looked down at his crotch. Thankfully, it was safe and sound and had not been infiltrated. Otherwise, he wouldn\u2019t know who to go crying to.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh\u2026\u201d Lin Fan jolted again, and then lift up a jade bottle next to his bed, \u2018What\u2019s this thing?\u2019</p><br/><p>The jade bottle was very normal, didn\u2019t have any patterns, and seemed unlikely to hold any treasure. Lin Fan held it then shook it, causing the insides to rattle about as if there was something inside. Lin Fan was sure that before he went to sleep, there was nothing like this next to his bed. Who put this here then?</p><br/><p>Lin Fan got up and opened the door. It was pitch black outside, and not a single person could be seen. The confused Lin Fan then returned inside, sat on his bed and thought it over, but was unable to come up with anything. So Lin Fan then dumped out the contents of the jade bottle.</p><br/><p>A golden medicinal herb with a powerful scent came into sight, upon smelling which brought about a refreshing feel.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026 discovered Saint Class medicinal pill, \u201cSupreme pill,\u201d after ingesting + 4 million experience.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Supreme pill: Formed through a collection of ghost dimension thousand year ice crystals, dozens of high quality thousand year monster materials.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Effects: acquiring thousand year ultimate qualification, comprehension.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Haha\u2026\u2019 The previously still hazy Lin Fan, suddenly opened his eyes wide. \u2018What the hell. What kind of medicinal pill is this, how is it so overpowered? 4 million experience points! Sh*t, 4 million experience points! Wow!\u2019</p><br/><p>Currently, Lin Fan felt like he was about to go crazy. This was basically a cookie from the heavens.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan, who was desperately trying to become stronger, directly threw the medicinal pill into his mouth without a second thought and started chewing ferociously. \u2018Oh, it\u2019s a bit hard. I can\u2019t chew it, well Yours Truly refuses to believe this. Whatever, let\u2019s just directly swallow it instead then.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026 ingested Saint Class medicinal pill, \u201cSupreme pill\u201d + 4 million experience.\u2019</p><br/><p>At this moment Lin Fan felt an irresistible thunderous energy within his body as if his entire body was about to explode.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding, activating experience upgrade function bar.\u2019</p><br/><p>His previous practically stuffed body suddenly returned to normal. Lin Fan was stunned, and stiffened a bit, then opened his character data and inspected it closely.</p><br/><p>Name: Lin Fan</p><br/><p>Level: 11 (Second level precelestial stage)</p><br/><p>Experience points: (7000/50000)</p><br/><p>Storage experience: four million. (Can upgrade character level, can upgrade martial skill level)</p><br/><p>Martial Skills: \u300aTitanium Grade Demon Body\u300b 19th Level (6000/2000000)</p><br/><p>\u300aMonkey Steals Peach\u300b 10th level (1400/10000)</p><br/><p>Title: Not conceding is dry (Cultivation base is doubled, time limit is one incense candle, one-time use)</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the extra 4 million experience and smiled brighter than anyone else, just like a sunflower. His cultivation base was still only second level precelestial, so he couldn\u2019t quite stand it. As a man completely full of swag, how could he allow his own cultivation base to remain so low?</p><br/><p>\u2018No, I must upgrade.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026 congratulations character level 12, third level precelestial.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026 congratulations character level 13, fourth level precelestial.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026 congratulations character level 14, fifth level precelestial.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Lin Fan clicked crazily, feeling as if he were to meet a God, he would kill God, meet Buddha kill Buddha; in other words completely unstoppable.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026 insufficient experience, unable to level up.\u2019</p><br/><p>Lin Fan, who was clicking away happily, was suddenly startled in a bit disbelief. He had merely reached ninth level precelestial and he already couldn\u2019t level anymore, this was a complete rip-off.</p><br/><p>But when Lin Fan carefully inspected it, he realized that to go from ninth level precelestial to postcelestial, it actually needed 10 million experience points. At this point Lin Fan was dumbfounded, this was too scary.</p><br/><p>Even though Lin Fan didn\u2019t really look, he couldn\u2019t help but wonder, \u2018From eighth level precelestial to ninth level precelestial should have only required around two hundred thousand experience points or so. How come when it reached here, it needs ten million experience points? This\u2026this!\u2019</p><br/><p>If this upgrade system had a customer service, Lin Fan would definitely complain, ferociously complain. This was a complete rip-off product. Looking at the remainder two million experience points, Lin Fan was speechless.</p><br/><p>\u2018Whatever, let\u2019s use the remainder on leveling up the martial skills. In an instant, I became an expert ninth level precelestial, so it was not so bad. If other people were to find out, they most definitely would be coughing up blood and die.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cHehehe\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026 congratulations \u300aTitanium Grade Demon Body\u300b leveled up.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026 congratulations \u300aTitanium Grade Demon Body\u300b leveled up to 20, martial skill advanced to \u300aEternal Demon Body\u300b.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026 \u300aEternal Demon Body\u300b 1st level (0/3000000)\u2019</p><br/><p>Upon seeing \u300aTitanium Grade Demon Body\u300b convert to \u300aEternal Demon Body\u300b, Lin Fan\u2019s heart almost jumped out. \u2018As expected, the martial skills can automatically advance, and from the looks of it, it\u2019s probably unlimited. If I gather enough experience, then in the future I will essentially become a walking tank.\u2019</p><br/><p>Then, Lin Fan directly added the remaining experience to \u300aMonkey Steals Peach\u300b. Although \u300aMonkey Steals Peach\u300b was a very garbage martial skill, Lin Fan was a very nostalgic type of person. \u300aMonkey Steals Peach\u300b had achieved illustrious merits for himself, so as a person with a good conscience, how could he give it up? In the future, he would make \u300aMonkey Steals Peach\u300b flourish greatly and become a legendary existence.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026 congratulations \u300aMonkey Steals Peach\u300b level up.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026 congratulations \u300aMonkey Steals Peach\u300b level up.\u2019</p><br/><p>At this point, Lin Fan was very happy and looked once again at his character data panel.</p><br/><p>Name: Lin Fan</p><br/><p>Level: 18 (Ninth level precelestial stage)</p><br/><p>Experience points: (0/10000000)</p><br/><p>Storage experience: 400 (Can upgrade character level, can upgrade martial skill level)</p><br/><p>Martial Skills: \u300aEternal Demon Body\u300b 1rst level\uff080/3000000\uff09</p><br/><p>\u300aMonkey Steals Peach\u300b 12th level (1400//30000)</p><br/><p>Title: Not conceding is dry (Cultivation base is doubled, time limit is one incense candle, one-time use)</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled contently, trying hard to calm his excited heart. This cookie from the heavens, Lin Fan swore to the heavens he wouldn\u2019t tell anyone about it. Just as Lin Fan prepared to continue lying down and fantasize for a while, he discovered a note next to his bed. Lin Fan picked up the note, glanced through it, and then nodded.</p><br/><p>The handwriting was beautiful, but somehow it also had a dominating feel to it. No, he must be overthinking it.</p><br/><p>It must be so.</p><br/><p>But when Lin Fan finished reading the contents of the note, his expression changed, then he threw the note aside and bitterly murmured.</p><br/><p>\u201cScrew it, I already ate it all. What\u2019s the point of saying anything\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>At this moment, in the dark night sky, a pair of bright eyes sparkled dazzlingly, just like the stars in the sky.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, stupid, that\u2019s not meant for eating.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

In fact, it was so formidable that they could hardly muster up any courage to resist this.</p><br/><p>\"Just where is this source of energy coming from?\" The Grandmaster of Heaven and Earth Sect could feel his heart surging like a tsunami in the face of this weird occurrence. Even if he were to die right now, he would not believe that this massive energy was created by that retarded boy before him.</p><br/><p>The same went for the Grandmaster of Mountain Sea Sect. He felt like a tiny ant in the face of this terrifying force.</p><br/><p>All the other Grandmasters could no longer maintain their sideline positions as they stood up one by one, casting their gazes at this figure standing there.</p><br/><p>Could it be that this tremendous energy was summoned by that silly boy there?</p><br/><p>\"Yunxian, this\u2026!\" The previous Grandmaster of Xuanjian Sect did not know what to say. Everything was happening way too quickly.</p><br/><p>\"I have no idea what this is either. Unless there's a mysterious enemy that's striking at us right now.\" Xuan Yunxian asked in a daze.</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>\"HAHA! Whack me? I'm telling you, my Daddy's watching over me right now! The two of you better start trembling in fear!\" Liu Linfeng shrieked out loudly.</p><br/><p>\"DADDY\u2026!!!\"</p><br/><p>BOOM!</p><br/><p>The energy grid line dragon that was coiling around the energy vortex howled wildly. Finally, it spiraled down rapidly towards Liu Linfeng.</p><br/><p>\"FENG, MOVE! IT'S DANGEROUS!\" The moment Xuan Yunxian saw this, her face changed entirely.</p><br/><p>\"It's alright.\" Looking at the energy grid line dragon that was descending from the skies, Liu Linfeng did not have a single strain of fear. In fact, he was filled with anticipation.</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>BOOOOOOOM!</p><br/><p>In that instant, a bright flash erupted, blinding everyone present. This flash was simply too dazzling, such that no one could see anything beyond it at all.</p><br/><p>By the time the light dispersed, everyone was completely stumped by the scene before them.</p><br/><p>Just what in the world was that?</p><br/><p>\"This\u2026!\" Xuan Yunxian looked at that massive figure that appeared behind Liu Linfeng and she shuddered, losing her balance. In fact, she might have fallen over if there weren't anyone there helping her up.</p><br/><p>\"It's him\u2026!\"</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>Liu Linfeng did not feel any changes happening to his body. But the moment he cast his gaze behind him, he was totally stunned. Finally, he screamed out emotionally.</p><br/><p>\"DADDY\u2026!!!\"</p><br/><p>The energy grid line dragon finally formed into an illusory figure of Lin Fan, as he floated gently behind Liu Linfeng.</p><br/><p>\"Hmph, do you guys see it now? This is my Daddy! How dare the two of you act so boldly in front of me? I wonder where you get your courage from!\" Raising his head tall, Liu Linfeng swept his robes and hollered out domineeringly.</p><br/><p>\"You\u2026!\" The faces of the two opposing Grandmasters changed. But, they watched the figure behind Liu Linfeng right now cautiously.</p><br/><p>Just what in the hell was this? How could this happen?</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>\"Do you see now, Master? I told you! Daddy's watching over Xuanjian Sect! Who do we have to be afraid of?\" Liu Linfeng chuckled.</p><br/><p>Xuan Yunxian looked at the illusory figure behind Liu Linfeng. She then looked around in all directions, as though she was searching for something.</p><br/><p>\"COME OUT!!! I KNOW YOU'RE NOT DEAD!!!\" Xuan Yunxian screamed out into the sky.</p><br/><p>All the various Grandmasters who were here to attend the ceremony had no idea whom Grandmaster Xuan was talking to right now. They did not know what those words meant as well.</p><br/><p>\"COME ON OUT\u2026!!!\" Xuan Yunxian did not believe in this so-called protective barrier of Liu Linfeng. That was evidently created by energy grid line chains!</p><br/><p>And if energy grid line chains were appearing, that meant that the person it belonged to must be alive!</p><br/><p>But she had just gone to Glory Sect the month before. His body was still lying motionless within that crystal coffin!</p><br/><p>Just what in the world was going on right now?</p><br/><p>Xuan Yunxian was in a flurry and needed to find out!</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>Hidden within the void, Lin Fan let out a sigh. Damn! He had wanted to give Liu Linfeng a chance to act for a little bit. But seemed like he could no longer do so the way things were turning out.</p><br/><p>Xuan Yunxian's agitated and peerlessly beautiful face right now was urgent and worried.</p><br/><p>At that moment, a figure appeared in the sky and gently floated down below.</p><br/><p>Xuan Yunxian stared blankly at that slowly approaching figure, as though she could not believe her very eyes.</p><br/><p>It had been an entire year. Day after day, night after night, each time a little bit of hope even rose in her heart, it would immediately be shattered the moment she caught sight of that lifeless body within the crystal coffin once more.</p><br/><p>He was never coming back anymore.</p><br/><p>But now that this person of her endless hopes and dreams had appeared right before her\u2026was this reality anymore?</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at Xuan Yunxian. Even though it had only been a single year for him, she had spent every day thinking of him, as though they were years.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan did not know what else he could say. Eventually, he just smiled.</p><br/><p>\"Ah\u2026haha! My apologies! I've just revived, so\u2026\" Before he could finish, a figure had thrown herself entirely within his embrace.</p><br/><p>Caught surprised, Lin Fan was stunned for a moment. He then chuckled out briefly before holding onto her tender waist and patting her back. There was nothing more he could say right now.</p><br/><p>Perhaps, one needed some time alone to take in a fact such as this.</p><br/><p>\"As long as you're back\u2026\" At this moment, Xuan Yunxian carried zero airs of being a Grandmaster. The look of happiness on her face was just like a satisfied demure wife.</p><br/><p>Standing at the sides, Liu Linfeng started wailing emotionally. Lei Yifeng stepped forth to try to console his good friend. However, the moment he walked over, Liu Linfeng hugged Lei Yifeng tightly and started sobbing on his shoulders.</p><br/><p>Lei Yifeng's jaws nearly dropped down to the ground...Brother Liu! Image! Our image\u2026!!!</p><br/><p>All the other Grandmasters present were equally lost.</p><br/><p>What in the world was going on right now! Just what sort of relationship did Grandmaster Xuan share with this man?!</p><br/><p>And who was this man to begin with?!</p><br/><p>At this moment, the feeling of that formidable force earlier was still on their minds. That was a horrifying aura indeed.</p><br/><p>\"Alright, there's so many people present right now. Today's the day of your grand ascension. We can talk about other stuff later on. I'll be here for a while.\" Lin Fan spoke up.</p><br/><p>\"Yes.\" Xuan Yunxian nodded her head and wiped her eyes. Noticing the gazes of the various Grandmasters, she flushed a little bit shyly.</p><br/><p>\"Daddy! You're finally here! I've been bullied by these two!\" Liu Linfeng ran up and hugged Lin Fan's thighs, bawling out. Looking at Liu Linfeng who was at his thighs, Lin Fan chuckled out exasperatedly, \"If you're bullied, just fight back!\"</p><br/><p>\"But, I can't beat them!\" Liu Linfeng replied.</p><br/><p>\"Oh, don't worry. If I say you can beat them, you can.\" Lin Fan replied casually.</p><br/><p>\"Okay!\"</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked over at the two Grandmasters. Within that seemingly normal gaze, there was a frosty chill enough to send shivers down their spines.</p><br/><p>The moment the two Grandmasters caught Lin Fan's gaze, their hearts skipped a beat.</p><br/><p>\"Hmph, how dare you bully me? Eat my punch!\" Liu Linfeng's trust towards Lin Fan was blind and faithful. No matter how strong the opponent was, he threw a punch over.</p><br/><p>BAM!</p><br/><p>The Grandmaster of Heaven and Earth Sect flew far into the distance.</p><br/><p>\"HAHA! Let's see if you still dare to bully me! Watch my punches!\" Looking at the scene before him, Liu Linfeng was excited beyond words.</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>For the two Grandmasters, it was an extremely simple task for them to squash an ant like Liu Linfeng. However, at this moment, they did not dare to retaliate at all.</p><br/><p>Even though that mysterious man did not strike at all, that gaze earlier had caused their blood to freeze. They could barely stir up any energy to resist this man.</p><br/><p>They firmly believed that if they had retaliated, their lives would have ended entirely and completely in that very instant.</p><br/><p>... </p><br/><p>Special Translator Thoughts: </p><br/><p>Hi guys, I'm sorry I've got to add in my translator notes in this manner because my message was so long that it exceeded the Translator Thought's word limits.</p><br/><p>Okay, back on the Premium situtation. So, I hope you guys know and understand by now that Qidian is actually paying for our translators without having anything in return. I know some of you may claim that ad revenue is something which they can earn money from, but let me assure you that the amount of money earned from ad revenue is far from enough to pay for the loss they are making. In the long term, Qidian's webnovel side will simply be forced to shut down as with any other non-profiting company and there will be no one else to properly provide translations at an acceptable pacing. I understand the frustrations some of you may have regarding the translation quality and speed of certain novels despite being those translators being paid as well. But trust me when I say that I've spoken to them about it and I can say with utmost assurance that they are trying to do something about it to ensure that you are getting your money's worth. But of course, the team is small for now and compared to the amount of problems they are facing, we really need to give them our faith and understanding that things will work out in the long run. While certain fan translations from the past may have worked out well in terms of speed and quality, Qidian is taking the tough road of trying to regulate the market to make it viable by forking out money on their end as an investment for things to pan out. Premium Program may not be a perfect project by all means, but it is still a good concept that was conceived that allows the Translators, Authors and Company to benefit together in the long term. Give them time to refine and work out the creases in the system and together, we can help build a better future for the scene.</p><br/><p>Now, for the Premium Program, there will be a burst release of chapters to come along with the inception of TSS into the project. I have just met with them today (For those of you who dont know, I've just arrived in Shanghai recently) and I have requested for even more chapters to be released than they had originally planned. This is the most I can do for you guys for now!</p><br/><p>If I have to comment ONE bad thing about the Premium Program, it would be that with the mass release and availability of chapters, that would mean that I would have to spread my attention span across the comments of TONS of available chapters. As such, reading on your comments and interacting with you guys would definitely face an inevitable drop as well. But at the very least, I'll make sure that MOST of my attention will be spent towards the latest chapters of BOTH locked and unlocked chapters. Hopefully that'll help me keep up with you guys more!</p><br/><p>So, that's all I have to say about it guys! Thank you for staying with me all these while and always listening to my long rants! I'll still be here as always, and if you need extra attention, there is always my discord where you can tag and reach out to me at any moment. Here's hoping that you guys enjoy the chapters available tomorrow and lets wait to see what the future holds for us! Cheers!</p><br/><p>Translator's Thoughts</p><br/><p>Lam Lam</p><br/><p>Lei Yifeng though. HAHAHA! He\u2019s like the Feng Bujue who\u2019s always caught in weird situations.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

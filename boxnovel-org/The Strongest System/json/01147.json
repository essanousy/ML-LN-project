From beneath the ground, hands that were ghastly gray in color climbed out one after another as a series of low grunts drifted out as well.</p><br/><p>When the disciples that were keeping watch on this area caught sight of this, they felt their spirits rattled entirely. This was the scene that they were the most afraid of coming to face; it was truly the most terrifying scene that could ever materialize.</p><br/><p>The Undead Spirit Master God of the Moon Shadow Mainland had summoned out all of those people who had already passed away from the Endless Mainland, turning them into horrifying existences who had no consciousness and only a single thought on their minds \u2014 kill.</p><br/><p>Within that group of Undead Spirits, those disciples of the Endless Mainland caught sight of people from their own sects; even brothers and sisters whom they had fought alongside in the past.</p><br/><p>At that moment, a shrill and deep sound boomed out, \u201cIndigenous Beings of the Endless Mainland\u2026when I, the Undead Spirit Master God, descend, all of you will have no chance at life anymore. Lay down your resistance and just submit to me entirely and completely.\u201d</p><br/><p>Old Master Green Hell looked at everything up in the distance. \u201cThis is it. The methods of that Undead Spirit Master God are extremely crafty, able to summon all of those Undead Spirits. However, the difference is that while they retain a large portion of their powers before their death, they do not fear pain at all! The only way to kill them is to crush them into dust entirely!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the sea of Undead Spirits before him. It was truly rather horrifying. All of those Undead Spirits carried with them an aura of death. In fact, there was even a rather putrid aura; a characteristic that corpses would possess after dying.</p><br/><p>\u201cOld Master Pu Xin, this will have to depend on you then.\u201d Lin Fan spoke up.</p><br/><p>Old Master Pu Xin nodded his head, \u201cDesecrating on the spirits of our founders is an extremely heinous crime. Buddha is merciful. Let me send them back to where they belong.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAmitabha!\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, Old Master Pu Xin shut his eyes gently, muttering his Buddha Chants with a single palm placed forward. Instantly, a bright Buddha Halo appeared behind him, emanating a bedazzling Buddha radiance. Thereafter, it pierced through the Heaven and Earth just like a banner as a series of benevolent Buddhas appeared in the vicinity of Old Master Pu Xi one after another. As they chanted out their Buddhist Sutras, the Buddhist Voices started getting ever closer, just like millions of mosquitoes that were buzzing around the entire place.</p><br/><p>\u201cGreat Benevolent Radiance!\u201d</p><br/><p>The highest of the Good and Evil Buddha Sect\u2019s Immortal Arts could purify every single bit of evil in this world.</p><br/><p>At that moment, the entire sky filled with a blanket of Buddhist Light that was slowly extending into the distance. It was so vast that it seemed as though every single bit of darkness in the world was slowly being consumed by the light, as rivers and mountains alike were swallowed up by this brilliant Buddhist Light.</p><br/><p>When the Undead Spirits up ahead were touched by this Buddha Light, they started wailing out tragically in pain. Balls of black smoke effused out of their bodies before dissipating into entire world.</p><br/><p>When the Undead Spirit Master God caught sight of this, his expression changed. \u201cHow could this be? What sort of power is that? Could the Radiant Master God have defected over to the side of these Indigenous Beings? But no, the Radiant Master God is dead! Besides, this power does not belong to the Radiant Master God either! This\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking at everything, the Nightmare Master God frowned as well. \u201cUndead Spirit Master God, I think we should leave this place first. This time around, we can be considered to have failed. The power of that Indigenous Being counters ours. If we were to continue lingering here, we might very well end up falling here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn it! This is simply way too infuriating! Why are there Indigenous Beings as such existing?\u201d The heart of the Undead Spirit Master God was filled with indignance. The only Master God whose powers countered his was the Radiant Master God. But, since the Radiant Master God had been slain by those Indigenous Beings, he was naturally out of the question. If that were the case, it should be impossible for any existence to bring out the kind of power that could fight against the might of his Undead Spirit Army!</p><br/><p>But, he would have never imagined that there could indeed be something like that out there.</p><br/><p>\u201cGo! Let us return! The War Master God has already gathered the entire War Army to prepare for a total attack soon, right? It won\u2019t be long before all these living beings of the Endless Mainland are annihilated entirely.\u201d The Nightmare Master God declared.</p><br/><p>The Undead Spirit Master God nodded his head in agreement. But, just as they were prepared to leave, a figure appeared right before them.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe two of you are thinking of leaving before even paying us some greetings? That\u2019s not too polite now, is it?\u201d Lin Fan appeared in a flash and hurled out a punch onto the face of the Nightmare Master God.</p><br/><p>BAM!</p><br/><p>Amongst the Master Gods, the strength of the Nightmare Master God was not considered the strongest. On the other hand, Lin Fan\u2019s strength was much stronger than most of the Master Gods right now. After all, even the Boundless Future Buddha Lord had no choice but to fear the current him. For someone at the caliber of this Nightmare Master God, there was no way he could survive in front of Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>With that single punch, the head of the Nightmare Master God spun for a good 360 degrees such that the spine at the nape of his head had even snapped apart. For the Nightmare Master God, it was only natural that a damage of this level was not something he could not deal with.</p><br/><p>However, to the horror of the Nightmare Master God, he discovered that half of his face had been blown apart by the other party!</p><br/><p>Grabbing onto the head of the Nightmare Master God with a single hand, Lin Fan commented, \u201cYou think that you can just come and leave as you wish? How rude would that be? Even if you guys want to leave, you\u2019ve got to offer something in return, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><br/><p>The eyeballs of the Nightmare Master God floated up gradually as they faced Lin Fan in absolute fright. He had not thought that this Indigenous Being would be so strong that he could not even fight back when that single punch was thrown at him!</p><br/><p>\u201cLET ME OFF\u2026!\u201d The Nightmare Master God howled out in rage as a formidable Power of Nightmare struck out at Lin Fan\u2019s consciousness, trying to push him into the depths of nightmares so that he would be lost within it forever.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Lin Fan could feel the strain of Power of Nightmare that was circulating within his body. However, it was suppressed down by the System almost instantaneously.</p><br/><p>\u201cYOU\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Nightmare Master God was completely taken aback. He had not imagined that his Power of Nightmare could have been defeated in the blink of an eye! How could this be\u2026?</p><br/><p>Lin Fan raised his fist as his lips curled into yet another smirk. \u201cDo you know what this is?\u201d</p><br/><p>Half of the Nightmare Master God\u2019s lower jaw was gone by now. However, in that broken jaw of his, a series of light traces shone out \u2014 that was his God Power. Looking at Lin Fan\u2019s fist, he replied nervously, \u201cF-Fist\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled out, \u201cAren\u2019t you stupid or something? This ain\u2019t no fist! This is a fist the size of a sandbag!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYOU\u2026!\u201d The Nightmare Master God clearly felt that the other party was just toying with him. But all of a sudden, that \u2018fist the size of a sandbag\u2019 appeared right before his eyes, imprinting itself into his memory as it slammed down onto his face and smashed his entire head in.</p><br/><p>Blood sprayed out everywhere as his God Core emitted an endless stream of God Power, trying to repair that caved-in head.</p><br/><p>\u201cAll of you Master Gods are clearly so weak. How is that you would have the courage to come and invade the Endless Mainland! Tell Yours Truly! Who gave you such courage?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan\u2019s hands closed together and pummelled all the way down from above just like a hammer.</p><br/><p>A berserk source of power ruptured out and smashed the God Body of the Nightmare Master God into pieces immediately. At that moment, the God Core of the Nightmare Master God floated gently into the void as a thunderous roar boomed out of it.</p><br/><p>\u201cDEGENERATE! YOU ARE A DEGENERATE! SAVE ME, UNDEAD SPIRIT MASTER GOD! SAVE ME\u2026!\u201d The Nightmare Master God bellowed out in rage. He had not expected that this Indigenous Being could actually be this ruthless, such that he would shatter his God Body entirely!</p><br/><p>Looking at everything before him, the Undead Spirit Master God felt his entire heart shivering in fear. Without lingering for a moment further, he bolted right into the void and tried escaping.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan peered at the Undead Spirit Master God before turning his gaze back onto the God Core of the Nightmare Master God and grabbing it into his hands. \u201cNightmare Master God, no one will be able to save you anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>BAM!</p><br/><p>As he closed his fingers tightly, the God Core of the Nightmare Master God shattered into pieces right away as streams of light flowed out.</p><br/><p>Looking at everything in front of him, Lin Fan could not help but remark, \u201cHow beautiful\u2026!\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

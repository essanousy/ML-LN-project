To think that you wouldn\u2019t even let me chop you down at your death!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was enraged right now. Who knew how many neurons he had destroyed in order to plan out everything. And yet, this Old Master Devouring Heavens\u2026 Good job! In just that split fraction of a millisecond, just that sliver of time and those heaven revolting experience points had escaped the grasp of his hands!</p><br/><p>This was a severe pain! Lin Fan had never once felt a pain as such.</p><br/><p>Now that two out of the seven utmost powerful beings were already dead, there were only five of them left alive. If all five of them were to die just like this, Lin Fan would even harbor thoughts of committing suicide.</p><br/><p>It was only now that Lin Fan realized that everything was far from what he had imagined it to be.</p><br/><p>The strength of the Old Master Thunder was simply way too strong, so strong that even Lin Fan was feeling a little fearful right now.</p><br/><p>Amongst the utmost powerful beings, the strength of Old Master Devouring Heavens wasn\u2019t all that weak. But, to think that even he would be blown up to death! This was something that Lin Fan hadn\u2019t expected at all.</p><br/><p>He was in a crazed search right now.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan did not have high expectations. As long as there were three utmost powerful beings alive, that would do as well! Alright, fine! Even if it were a little less, even TWO would do!</p><br/><p>If there were only one or none left, Lin Fan would truly have to puke out blood. That would mean that all the hard work that he had put into this was all for naught!</p><br/><p>\u201cUtmost powerful beings, where are you guys! I\u2019m here to save you guys!\u201d Lin Fan yelled out.</p><br/><p>Within this pitch black darkness, it was really no easy task to look out for those surviving utmost powerful beings.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs there no one left alive?\u201d Lin Fan shouted out while searching. There wasn\u2019t even a single ghost in this pitch black darkness here.</p><br/><p>And just at this moment, at a black place not too far from him, a small piece of bloodied meat was pulsating.</p><br/><p>\u201cDAMNED MOTHERF*CKING HUMAN KING! I\u2019M GOING TO KILL YOU!\u201d The Old Master Crocodile was roaring at this moment.</p><br/><p>However, because his injuries were way too severe, that rendered the Old Master Crocodile incapable of crossing the void to leave this place.</p><br/><p>He hadn\u2019t expected the self destruction of the Old Master Thunder to deal him this much damage. If not for the fact that his skin was tough by nature, he would most probably have already been dead by now!</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn it! Given the current injuries sustained, I will definitely not be able to recover fully without at least 10,000 years or so.\u201d The Old Master Crocodile was filled with hatred in his heart. His Paradise had crumbled down, resulting in a huge loss for him.</p><br/><p>However, right now, even if it were an ant, the Old Master Crocodile might very well be killed by that.</p><br/><p>If he were discovered by the Motherf*cking Human King, the consequences would be unimaginable.</p><br/><p>\u201cMOTHERF*CKING HUMAN KING, JUST YOU WAIT!\u201d The Old Master Crocodile swore to the Heavens that he would never ever trust anybody from now on forth.</p><br/><p>This Motherf*cking Human King was simply way too crafty.</p><br/><p>That dogsh*t Old Master Thunder! If he wanted to die, he should have just died alone! To think that all of them would be dragged into this mess. Damn it! God damn it!</p><br/><p>And just as that pulsating bloodied meat of the Old Master Crocodile was slowly trying to crawl its way into the distance, he felt a chilling feeling appearing behind his back all of a sudden.</p><br/><p>At the same time, there was a disturbing gaze that seemed intent on devouring him down entirely. That was something that was extremely frightening.</p><br/><p>\u201cOld Master Crocodile\u2026 You\u2019re quite the good example!\u201d After searching for a good, long time, Lin Fan had finally discovered a square piece of bloodied meat that was trying to crawl away slowly! That had Lin Fan in a state of total ecstasy.</p><br/><p>Finally, after all this time, he had found one!</p><br/><p>\u201cM-motherf<em>cking Human King\u2026!\u201d The voice of the Old Master Crocodile was filled with fear right now. He was in a state where he was totally defenseless and helpless. Facing the Motherf</em>cking Human King now would leave him with no other path but death.</p><br/><p>\u201cM-motherf*cking Human King, h-how about we talk things out p-properly? C-can\u2019t we just get a-along in peace?\u201d The Old Master Crocodile begged out sorrowfully and pleaded. He truly did not want to die!</p><br/><p>If he were to die right here, he would be left with nothing at all!</p><br/><p>All those powers that he had accumulated over countless of eras would vanish like smoke, and that path of transcending up ahead would be cut off from him forever!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d Right now, Lin Fan\u2019s mood was awesome. The fact that he was even able to find one meant that he wouldn\u2019t make a loss at least.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease let me go, I beg of you! I\u2019m willing to be your helper\u2026 No, I\u2019m willing to be your slave! Anything as long as you let me go!\u201d The Old Master Crocodile begged out.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan sniggered out and held the bloodied piece of meat of the Old Master Crocodile in his hands.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not the simple guy, are you? The fact that you\u2019re able to survive the self destruction of the Old Master Crocodile means that you\u2019ve got some capabilities! However, all of that is just nice to complement the achievements of Yours Truly.\u201d Lin Fan sighed out.</p><br/><p>The Old Master Crocodile could sense that there was no way the Motherf*cking Human King was going to let him off now. With that, he started getting agitated.</p><br/><p>\u201cMOTHERF*CKING HUMAN KING! YOUR ANCESTOR IS NEVER GOING TO LET YOU OFF! YOUR ANCESTOR\u2026YOUR ANCESTOR\u2026!\u201d But just at this moment, the voice of the Old Master Crocodile seemed to be getting hurried.</p><br/><p>That scattered consciousness of his that he had only managed to regroup after much efforts was actually showing signs of breaking down once more!</p><br/><p>\u201cAiyoh! Holy f*ck! I can\u2019t let you die for nothing!\u201d Lin Fan could sense that the feeble aura of the Old Master Crocodile seemed as though it could dissipate at any moment now. Without hesitating, he used some strength and squeezed the piece of meat to sludge instantly.</p><br/><p>With that, the only remaining consciousness of the Old Master Crocodile vanished like the air.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026Congratulations on killing Old Master Crocodile.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026Experience Points +\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cTo think that I didn\u2019t get to level up. That\u2019s quite a pity now.\u201d Lin Fan expressed his exasperation.</p><br/><p>At the same time, there was nothing that popped out of him killing the Old Master Crocodile. Evidently, everything of his had already been destroyed in that single explosion just now.</p><br/><p>\u201cEH?!\u201d</p><br/><p>All of a sudden, Lin Fan realized that there seemed to be some commotion happening up ahead.</p><br/><p>He saw two pieces of bloodied meat trying their best while pulsating up ahead.</p><br/><p>\u201cOld Master Water Dragon, help me to block first! Once I\u2019ve recovered, I will definitely gather all the Demonic Gods of the Ancient race to help you take revenge!\u201d This piece of bloodied meat was the Drought Demonic God.</p><br/><p>He hadn\u2019t expected that this would be the final outcome of things. If not for the fact that he had used the Extreme Heavens Demonic God as a meat shield, he might have long been blown up to death.</p><br/><p>For the Drought Demonic God, it was a right choice for him to dupe the Extreme Heavens Demonic God over this time around. At least, that was a move that helped him keep his life.</p><br/><p>In the past, there had been utmost powerful beings who had self destructed as well. Even though he knew that the self destruction of utmost powerful beings was extremely powerful, he hadn\u2019t experienced it for himself. But now that he had, he knew that it wasn\u2019t extremely powerful\u2026 It was just bloody downright sick!</p><br/><p>To think that even with their cultivation state, they wouldn\u2019t be able to defend against it! How sick was that?</p><br/><p>\u201cScram, Drought Demonic God! YOU help Your Ancestor to block first and Your Ancestor will help you seek revenge in the future!\u201d The injuries of the Old Master Water Dragon were extremely grave. Although he was in tremendous pain, he did not dare to cry out. If he cried out, he was afraid that that horrifying Motherf*cking Human King might be lured here!</p><br/><p>This time around, he had truly comprehended just how underhanded that Motherf*cking Human King was.</p><br/><p>This bloody motherf*cking dog of an Old Master Thunder! Bloody hell! He just HAD to drag them down into the waters after he was dead meat himself. He was worse than a beast!</p><br/><p>To think that he had trusted the Old Master Thunder so much in the past, and yet he had sold them out!</p><br/><p>\u201cOld Master Water Dragon, your life\u2019s Essence Energy has already been depleted and destroyed! If you want to recover, you wouldn\u2019t be able to do so unless it takes you 10,000 years or so! Just protect me and let me leave this place! Once I get back to the Ancient race, with the help of the other Demonic Gods, I will only require a couple of years to recover! By then, I\u2019ll help you take revenge and have this Motherf*cking Human King killed mercilessly!\u201d The Drought Demonic God said.</p><br/><p>\u201cScram!\u201d</p><br/><p>After the Old Master Water Dragon scolded out with that single roar, he started crawling ahead with all his strength as he cussed in his heart. This time around, the losses were simply way too great that he could barely deal with it any longer.</p><br/><p>If he were to be discovered by that Motherf*cking Human King, the only path left for him was definitely that of death, without a single scrap of him left.</p><br/><p>And just at this moment, an eerie snigger traveled over that had the both of them freezing up immediately.</p><br/><p>\u201cTo think that there are two more\u2026\u201d Lin Fan was overwhelmed with joy.</p><br/><p>Lam_ Lam_ Make it four in total please! Make him level up!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

At the same time, all the dilapidated houses were turned into dust. The ground had a wide crack, as though someone had torn it apart.</p><br/><p>The forbidden ground Ancient Demon Grounds had disappeared completely.</p><br/><p>\u2018Roar\u2026!\u2019</p><br/><p>A roar of boundless hatred roared out across the skies, shaking the entire world to its core.</p><br/><p>\u2018Just what is this thing?\u2019 Lin Fan stood on a patch of barren grounds, looking at some massive figures which rose like mountain peaks.</p><br/><p>There were two purple horns that were growing on its head. On its body were patches of scales. Each scale was like a mountain peak by itself, pitch black and sharp.</p><br/><p>Those rough arms were like pillars that supported the Heavens. There were dense mysterious symbols and runes which were carved on it. A gigantic chain was dragging across the ground, as though this was a demon which had just crawled out of Hell.</p><br/><p>But the thing which caused Lin Fan to feel turned off was this.</p><br/><p>How dare this gargantuan thing stand between Heaven and Earth stark naked? What sort of impact would this cause to anyone who saw this?</p><br/><p>\u2018Weird, to think that it has no energy grid line chains!\u2019</p><br/><p>Using the system to check, Lin Fan could not find any energy grid line chains on this fella. Could it be that they were just not showing up on the system?</p><br/><p>But this aura was causing Lin Fan to hesitate.</p><br/><p>The skies were stained red like blood. With an unparalleled fighting intent, the aura of royalty permeated the air, causing everyone\u2019s heart to feel repressed.</p><br/><p>\u2018Unless, all of that was real? The Ancient Demon Grounds is truly a place where a big ancient demon had fallen\u2026 And, could this be that so-called big ancient demon?\u2019 Lin Fan wasn\u2019t too certain of the facts, so he wasn\u2019t quick to strike out as well.</p><br/><p>\"I\u2019m Yao Huangtian! I want to wage war over the ancients once more!\" A savage roar spread through the entire place. His boundless hatred rippled out through the place, causing shivers to go down everyone\u2019s spines.</p><br/><p>Even as he was standing at this place that was pretty far away, Lin Fan\u2019s robes rose and bobbed with the shockwave.</p><br/><p>Yao Huangtian\u2019s purple eyes shone with boundless anger. Every single step he took was a few thousand feet in distance.</p><br/><p>To him, Lin Fan looked like nothing more than an ant, something he couldn\u2019t bother paying any attention to.</p><br/><p>\u2018Even though I don\u2019t know what in the world you are, but there\u2019s definitely no way you can just walk by Yours Truly so extravagantly!\u2019 Lin Fan thought in his head. After that, he followed along Yao Huangtian\u2019s steps.</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>\"Hurry up and run! That\u2019s too scary!\"</p><br/><p>\"Is this the big ancient demon? Just that body alone causes one to feel too fearful to resist that!\"</p><br/><p>\"Isn't the big ancient demon long dead? How did he revive? Goodness, the skies are changing!\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan caught sight of a few disciples of the sect who were training in the forbidden grounds earlier, and made haste to catch up with them.</p><br/><p>\"Say, who\u2019s that fella?\" Like a ghost, Lin Fan appeared right before the person, scaring the other party sh*tless. But when he realized that it was a human, he heaved a sigh of relief.</p><br/><p>\"Hurry up and run! That\u2019s the big ancient demon! No one can fight that!\" The person who was halted by Lin Fan exclaimed loudly as though he was in shock. He then broke free of Lin Fan\u2019s grasp and ran off into the distance with his sect.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, a voice boomed out within Lin Fan\u2019s mind. Or rather, the voice was permeating the skies itself.</p><br/><p>\"The Ancient Demon Ground\u2019s Big Ancient Demon has revived. The entire Dongling Continent needs to band together against it or face total annihilation.\"</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>Lin Fan raised his head at the skies in bewilderment. And what the hell was this all about?</p><br/><p>Why the hell were the Heavens talking?!?</p><br/><p>And just as Lin Fan was busy figuring this thing out, every single sect within Dongling Continent heard this frightening news as well.</p><br/><p>Glory Sect\u2026</p><br/><p>\"This is the voice of the Heavens! To think that the Big Ancient Demon of the Ancient Demon Grounds would revive! How could this be?!\"</p><br/><p>\"Gather every single disciple who is of greater celestial cultivation state and above to follow me out!\"</p><br/><p>Upon hearing this voice, Grandmaster Yan sent down the orders immediately. An affair of this scale that concerned the entire Dongling Continent was definitely far from ordinary.</p><br/><p>Even though he had not witnessed it for himself, it was inscribed in the records of Glory Sect that the powers of the big ancient demon was extraordinarily formidable.</p><br/><p>Fengtian Sect.</p><br/><p>Xuanyang Sect.</p><br/><p>Taiyi Sect.</p><br/><p>Jiutian Sect.</p><br/><p>Nine Heavens Sect.</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>One by one, the sects of Dongling Continent started moving.</p><br/><p>The great sects had once made an agreement that if the time came when Dongling Continent was in danger, they would let go of whatever squabble they had ever had. And by the looks of it, this voice of the Heavens was something they had never heard before.</p><br/><p>To these sects, this was a battle that only disciples of greater celestial cultivation base and above could take part in. Any other disciple would probably just be cannon fodder.</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at that huge chunk of rock, \"Yao Huangtian! What a cocky name indeed. And you\u2019re a big ancient demon as well. Seems like I must definitely give it a good one with you.\"</p><br/><p>Following behind the big ancient demon all the way, Lin Fan just wanted to grasp the situation regarding this big ancient demon clearly.</p><br/><p>Along the way, he understood something as well.</p><br/><p>This big ancient demon was strong, and his strength was far superior compared to those Blood Demon Emperors and the likes.</p><br/><p>Wherever he passed, grass would not grow, the rivers would stop flowing, the mountains would crumble flat. Even some of the beasts who were too ferocious would disintegrate into dust by just his pressure alone.</p><br/><p>Somewhere in Dongling Continent\u2026</p><br/><p>A ripple appeared in the peaceful void as two figures suddenly came out of it.</p><br/><p>He Yuhan\u2019s face was grim. She had committed a grave mistake this time around. For the sake of obtaining the Demon God Essence Blood, she had unintentionally awakened the Big Ancient Demon.</p><br/><p>All of this was a trap laid down by the Big Ancient Demon.</p><br/><p>But no matter what she would say now, it was all too late. There was nothing she could do about this.</p><br/><p>\"Hais, if this were in the past, I would still be able to suppress this demon. But now, it\u2019s all too late.\" Looking up into the skies, He Yuhan gave off a long sigh. She then looked at Xia Youtian, who was still fainted, with determined eyes.</p><br/><p>At least there was still a strand of hope.</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>Just then, Xia Youtian woke up.</p><br/><p>\"Yuhan, where am I?\" Xia Youtian\u2019s mind was confused, as though he could barely remember some things.</p><br/><p>\"It\u2019s all alright, Brother Xia. Can you feel the energy of the bloodline that\u2019s surging through your body?\" He Yuhan smiled at him.</p><br/><p>Xia Youtian looked at He Yuhan as he gradually felt the changes that were happening in his body.</p><br/><p>\"Yuhan, I feel a strange power coursing through my body\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Upon hearing this, He Yuhan smiled gently and placed her palm on his shoulder, \"Of course. This is\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Suddenly, before she could continue, her face changed abruptly as she gripped her fist tightly.</p><br/><p>To think that this was just 1/3rd of the Demon God Bloodline?!</p><br/><p>\"Yuhan, what\u2019s wrong?\" Xia Youtian asked, puzzled.</p><br/><p>\"Nothing, Brother Xia. We\u2019re running out of time. Let\u2019s head to the next place.\" Standing up, He Yuhan stared into the distant skies.</p><br/><p>Even though they were quite a distance away from the forbidden grounds and everything seemed peaceful, in He Yuhan\u2019s eyes, the skies were filled with demonic energies.</p><br/><p>But, there was truly nothing she could do now. No matter what she did, she had to keep the bigger picture in mind. She could only hope that those big sects would be able to seal the Big Ancient Demon.</p><br/><p>Translator's Thoughts</p><br/><p>Lam Lam</p><br/><p>Oh gosh. Why does this mysterious woman seem so important now? I feel like there\u2019s A LOT of mysteries that\u2019s going on. Like I\u2019m actually really excited for every single chapter right now?! And the great battle with all the sects?!?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

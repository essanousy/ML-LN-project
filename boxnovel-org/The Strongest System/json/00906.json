No matter how strong a powerful being was, if he or she were to be caught in between these two Sword Wills, he or she would definitely be minced into shreds.</p><br/><p>All of a sudden, the Ancestor of the Sword race realized that the other party's Sword Will also had the Triple Lifetime Reincarnation Sutra merged with it! But, how could that be possible? The Triple Lifetime Reincarnation Sutra was a mystic skill of the Ancestral Buddha, and there was only a single one of that in the entire world! How could this human possess it as well?</p><br/><p>A brilliant radiance shone out as the Sword Wills burst forth, causing the entire firmament to tremble in front of their might and gray clouds to rumble. The moment they made contact with one another, the Sword Will emanated out sliced through the entire area with a radius of 10,000 miles.</p><br/><p>\"To think that it would be a draw.\" Lin Fan chuckled out.</p><br/><p>\"How do you possess the Triple Lifetime Reincarnation Sutra?!\" The Ancestor of the Sword race exclaimed out.</p><br/><p>\"Huehue\u2026 Maybe it's because the Triple Lifetime Reincarnation Sutra was disseminated by Yours Truly?\" Lin Fan smiled out calmly.</p><br/><p>However, this smile was unusually creepy in the eyes of the Ancestor of the Sword race.</p><br/><p>\"How could that be\u2026?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan did not say anything more as he tossed the longsword in his hands into his Paradise. The Ancestor of the Sword race seized the opportunity to point out his finger at Lin Fan's chest.</p><br/><p>\"DIE!\" The Ancestor of the Sword race roared out.</p><br/><p>BAM!</p><br/><p>To the fright of the Ancestor of the Sword race, he realized that his finger did nothing to the other party. But all of a sudden, the former's eyes turned towards a red brick that was slamming out towards his head.</p><br/><p>The Ancestor of the Sword race did not dare to be careless. This human was exceptionally devious. He then dodged it swiftly.</p><br/><p>\"You\u2026!\"</p><br/><p>\"Aiyoh! So powerful! To think that you would have dodged that!\" Lin Fan was a little disappointed. To think that this Ancestor of the Sword race would be this cautious, and wouldn't even dare to try the taste of being hit by a mere brick!</p><br/><p>\"Come, continue.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan beckoned to the Ancestor of the Sword race with his hands, indicating for him to continue with his performance.</p><br/><p>Seeing this humiliating hand signal, the Ancestor of the Sword race was naturally enraged. A single sword swept through the entire area and shone with a chilling flash as it sliced out towards Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Clang!</p><br/><p>The sword landed on Lin Fan's body, though there was naturally no damage done. But, in his eyes, this was yet another mother*cking good chance!</p><br/><p>\"Go on, Nine Five Legendary Brick.\"</p><br/><p>Failed!</p><br/><p>\"Ancestor of the Sword race, can you please not be so cowardly? If you've got the guts, come and fight this single brick of Yours Truly!\" Lin Fan yelled out in an exasperated tone.</p><br/><p>His current strength was nowhere that of the Ancestor of the Sword race. If he wanted to kill the other party, he would have to resort to some tricks.</p><br/><p>However, this Ancestor of the Sword race was extremely dodgy. The moment he noticed that something was off, he would dodge away instantly. This was something that had Lin Fan in a spot.</p><br/><p>This was one hell of a dog f*cking!</p><br/><p>\"Human! Don't you dare go overboard!\" The Ancestor of the Sword race howled out as a Sword Will burst up into the sky. The Intents of the Eight Desolates were all gathered within it as a bedazzling flash of light streaked by.</p><br/><p>\"Criss Cross!\"</p><br/><p>The body of the Ancestor of the Sword race split into eight, each of which burst out with a torrential aura; there was no way to identify his true body at all.</p><br/><p>\"Holy f*ck! Seems like I've got to work harder at slapping then.\"</p><br/><p>\"I'll slap!\"</p><br/><p>Failed!</p><br/><p>Failed!</p><br/><p>Failed!</p><br/><p>At this moment, Lin Fan was just like a practice target that was being whacked out by the Ancestor of the Sword race as he wanted to. However, Lin Fan just couldn't get his brick touch the Ancestor of the Sword race, which had him somewhat speechless.</p><br/><p>\"F*cking cowardly Ancestor of the Sword race\u2026 Don't move if you've got the guts! Come and fight Yours Truly one on one!\" Lin Fan shouted out. However, no matter how hard he tried to humiliate him, the Ancestor of the Sword race still wouldn't give him a single chance.</p><br/><p>Time passed by the seconds and the minutes\u2026</p><br/><p>The heart of the Ancestor of the Sword race was accumulating rage with each passing moment. He realized that the Physical Body State of this Human was too damned strong!</p><br/><p>Bam!</p><br/><p>Bam!</p><br/><p>The ground cracked as the void went into chaos. Everything in the vicinity had already been destroyed by the Ancestor of the Sword race.</p><br/><p>Urgh!</p><br/><p>Right at this moment, Lin Fan spat out with a mouthful of old blood as his body was flung backward and buried into a deep pit.</p><br/><p>When the Ancestor of the Sword race caught sight of this, his heart leaped with joy. That sword from earlier on was the culmination of his essence, spirit, and vitality. The amount of power that ruptured forth from it was definitely nothing to be scoffed at.</p><br/><p>Initially, the Ancestor of the Sword race had thought that this human was practically made of steel, and there was no way to have him killed. But right now, he was finally seeing some hope.</p><br/><p>\"Damn it! To think that the Defensive Legendary Weapon of Yours Truly would have been destroyed!\" Lin Fan yelled out with a look of fear in his eyes. The expression that he was giving off right now was as though this was a fact that was truly happening.</p><br/><p>'This Ancestor of the Sword race is simply way too bloody dodgy! Unless I resort to dirty tricks, there's truly no way to deal with him!' Lin Fan lied in the deep pit and cursed in his heart.</p><br/><p>\"HAHA!\" Naturally, the Ancestor of the Sword race had heard Lin Fan's words and burst out laughing wildly. In his eyes, his chance had finally come.</p><br/><p>\"Human! That Defensive Legendary Weapon of yours is obviously unable to withstand the might of Your Ancestor's Sword Dao! Now that you no longer have the Legendary Weapon, I'll see what else you can do!\" The Ancestor of the Sword race said triumphantly.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan gave off a slightly frantic look before turning around to look at the other, \"Dogsh*t! Yours Truly's physical body is invincible! I don't require any Legendary Weapon!\"</p><br/><p>\"Hmph! To think that you would still try to hoodwink Your Ancestor even at death's door. If you hand over the Legendary Items, Your Ancestor can spare your life.\" The Ancestor of the Sword race scolded harshly. That initially dimmed Sword Will of his was starting to show its glory once more.</p><br/><p>\"Dream on! Do you really think that you can kill Yours Truly?!\" Lin Fan replied as though he was out of breath. His expression seemed as though he was trying to somehow find a way to make an escape.</p><br/><p>But, what sort of a character was the Ancestor of the Sword race? How could he not notice the changes in Lin Fan's expressions?</p><br/><p>\"With just a single sword, Your Ancestor will be able to have you slain. A mere ant like Human without his Defensive Legendary Weapon... What capabilities do you have to defend against the Sword Will of Your Ancestor?\"</p><br/><p>\"Human\u2026 This single sword shall send you to the Heavens.\"</p><br/><p>The wrist of the Ancestor of the Sword race jerked as his palm held onto to a ball of unparalleled Sword Will. As he turned his palm around, a bedazzling radiance shone out.</p><br/><p>From within this bright radiance, an unparalleled Sword Will sliced out.</p><br/><p>\"ARGH!\" Lin Fan yelped out as he dodged left and right. As for the Ancestor of the Sword race, he could now be sure that this Human was truly at his wit's end.</p><br/><p>\"Slay!\"</p><br/><p>In a millionth of a second, the Ancestor of the Sword race appeared before Lin Fan's face as he pointed that shining finger of his towards the latter's chest.</p><br/><p>\"HAHAHA!\" The Ancestor of the Sword race laughed out maniacally. But all of a sudden, his expression changed slightly. That was because he realized that this human before him had just let off an extremely sinister and menacing smile!</p><br/><p>'This\u2026!'</p><br/><p>\"Very good.\" Lin Fan chuckled out.</p><br/><p>But for the Ancestor of the Sword race, this was, in fact, not good at all! He had realized that he had just been tricked!</p><br/><p>'Retreat!' That was the only thought in his head right now. But right at this moment, an incomparable surge of pain rushed up into his mind.</p><br/><p>\"OUCH!\"</p><br/><p>\"How about now? What do you think of Yours Truly's Twisting Heaven and Earth?\" Since God knows when, Lin Fan had his hands grabbing at the crotch of the Ancestor of the Sword race. As he squeezed with his fingers, the only thing that rang out was the tragic cry of the Ancestor of the Sword race.</p><br/><p>\"OUCH! S-STOP!!!!\"</p><br/><p>Thud!</p><br/><p>Unable to endure a pain of this level, the Ancestor of the Sword race knelt down onto the ground on one knee. Both of his hands grabbed his head while trembling as he reared his head and howled out into the skies.</p><br/><p>\"LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOSEN YOUR GRIP!\"</p><br/><p>The Ancestor of the Sword race screamed out with an anguished look. To think that this Human would resort to such a despicable method!</p><br/><p>\"Hehe!\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed out at this moment. 'A ball in hand and the world shall belong to him.' A killing move of such savageness wasn't something that ordinary people could ever hope to understand.</p><br/><p>Now, he could slowly have his fun with the Ancestor of the Sword race.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

How dare you swallow Your Majesty into your tummy? Alright then, Your Majesty shall devour your entire consciousness and take over your body then! Everything you have shall belong to Your Majesty! Your wealth, fortune, body, cultivation state, and women! Hehe! That's right, especially your women! Oh, Your Majesty will take extra care to train them up well!\" Sovereign King Wei sniggered sinisterly as though he had not expected this human to swallow him in.</p><br/><p>\"Dumb f*ck.\" Lin Fan did not have anything much to say anymore. All he felt was that this Sovereign King Wei was way too dumb.</p><br/><p>\"YOU\u2026!\" To think that this human would dare to remain so brazen even in the face of death! Sovereign King Wei was so angered that even his essence spirit was rattling right now.</p><br/><p>\"Alright then! I shall let you know of Your Majesty's true powers! Devour! Devour!\" The essence spirit of the Sovereign King Wei bellowed out consistently. He had it up till here. He was bent on devouring this darned human's soul altogether!</p><br/><p>1!</p><br/><p>2!</p><br/><p>3!</p><br/><p>'Time's up.'</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was counting down silently. How could all these living beings in the world dare to consume just about anything they saw before them, without even having what it took?</p><br/><p>\"ARGH! WHAT'S THIS? IMPOSSIBLE! NO\u2026!\"</p><br/><p>Indeed, as Lin Fan had expected, the tragic wails of the Sovereign King Wei rose up at that instant.</p><br/><p>\"Oh! You're truly a dumb f*ck.\" Lin Fan sighed. Yours Truly had the system with him. What in the world was the system? It was a bloody invincible existence! Just this mere Sovereign King Wei wished to devour Lin Fan? What a fool's dream that was!</p><br/><p>'Ding\u2026Congratulations on killing a trace of Sovereign King Wei's essence spirit.'</p><br/><p>'Ding\u2026Experience points +200,000'</p><br/><p>'Ding\u2026Congratulations on leveling up.'</p><br/><p>'Cultivation State: Desolate celestial full cultivation state.'</p><br/><p>'Wow! This was the best!' Right now, Lin Fan was practically floating on the heavens itself. To think that a single trace of essence spirit from Sovereign King Wei could produce these many experience points! This was fabulous!</p><br/><p>If he could kill the Sovereign King Wei for real, wouldn't the amount of experience points truly skyrocket by then?</p><br/><p>But, the only feeling of pain that Lin Fan had right now was that all those Shengyang Pills that he had painstakingly saved up were all exhausted in an instant. He could have been considered a pretty wealthy man earlier on. However, he became a pauper in the blink of an eye.</p><br/><p>And, the one responsible for all of this? Mu Longtian.</p><br/><p>The moment Mu Longtian realized that the Motherf*cking Human King was looking over at him, his heart skipped a beat on sensing that something was amiss. However, that was not right either. He didn't have any sort of bad blood with the Motherf*cking Human King. So, why would the Motherf*cking Human King bear any grudges or anything against him?</p><br/><p>\"Long live the Motherf*cking Human King!\" With that, Mu Longtian was the first one to cheer out. Those former captive beings of the thousands of races, who were doused in shock right now, snapped back into their senses and hurrayed.</p><br/><p>\"The Motherf*cking Human King is ferocious without a worthy opponent!\"</p><br/><p>\"The Motherf*cking Human King is the greatest!\"</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>For the beings of the thousands of races, they were truly blinded this time around by the awesomeness. That was way too exhilarating, way too imposing!</p><br/><p>To think that the Sovereign King Wei, such a powerful being of the ancient race, would find himself being slain by the Motherf*cking Human King! Who else could be a match for the Motherf*cking Human King?</p><br/><p>By now, all the beings of the thousands of races had been converted into brain-damaged fans of the Motherf*cking Human King, as they cheered with their lives.</p><br/><p>As for Dulong and the others, they remained in a state of shock.</p><br/><p>\"Motherf*cking Human King.\" Dulong looked up at Lin Fan who was floating gently in the sky. Suddenly, his face changed ever so slightly. Before anyone knew it, he was cheering out like the beings of the thousands of races, \"LONG LIVE\u2026!\"</p><br/><p>Whoever said that anyone mature would never turn into a brain-damaged fan of an idol would only say that because they had yet to meet with someone so captivating.</p><br/><p>In the Ancient Saint World, strength reigned supreme over everything else.</p><br/><p>And, the kind of prowess that was displayed by Lin Fan had long convinced all of them entirely. Furthermore, it wasn't just his power that had them convinced. It was his courage as well.</p><br/><p>Looking at everything calmly, Lin Fan eventually submerged into the pleasure of all the adoration and cheers.</p><br/><p>\u2026..</p><br/><p>In a secret chamber of the royal city somewhere far away\u2026</p><br/><p>Sovereign King Wei's eyes jerked open suddenly. That initially malevolent expression of his turned ever more sinister.</p><br/><p>\"DAMN B*STARD. HOW DARE HE KILL OFF MY ESSENCE SPIRIT?\" This time around, the Sovereign King Wei was truly angered.</p><br/><p>He was at the bottleneck of breaking through to the next cultivation state. Right at the critical juncture, he felt his bloodline tingle. After that, he realized that his child had been killed by someone else.</p><br/><p>Blood was thicker than water after all. Therefore, he was naturally enraged. Separating a single trace of essence spirit from himself, he then gave chase to that location.</p><br/><p>But to think that the darned human would dare to kill off his essence spirit! Damn it! GOD DAMN IT!</p><br/><p>In the beginning, Sovereign King Wei was genuinely startled by Lin Fan for a moment. After all, he did not know whether the other party might be some powerful being. If he were and they had exchanged blows, the other party could have used his essence spirit as a basis and tracked down his true body.</p><br/><p>If that were the case, his plan of breaking through to the next state of cultivation state would definitely be destroyed.</p><br/><p>However, upon realizing that this human was just playing tricks on him, he was entirely incensed. Without a single bit of hesitation, he then fought the human straight on, determined to crush him mercilessly.</p><br/><p>To think that this human would have these many tricks up his sleeves! Because of that, he took a huge loss of having his essence spirit go down.</p><br/><p>The moment he recalled that cocky expression on the face of that human, Sovereign King Wei burned with rage.</p><br/><p>\"Damn it! DAMN DAMN DAMN DAMN DAMN IT! Your Majesty has trodden over the eight districts for tens of thousands of years. Since when have I been subjected to such humiliation?\"</p><br/><p>\"Alright, since that's the case, then Yours Truly shall give up on breaking through to the next cultivation state for now and kill you, f*cker! Only then can I truly ease this feeling of hatred in my heart!\" Sovereign King Wei seethed with frustration.</p><br/><p>\"BREAK!\"</p><br/><p>With that single holler, all the energy around his body began to gather immediately, congealing altogether. A single golden pill that was formed in the void burst open immediately, converting into a huge amount of energy and flowing back into his body.</p><br/><p>Instantly, the gaze of the Sovereign King Wei's eyes shone brightly. This essence light pierced through the Heaven and Earth, looking down on everything in this world.</p><br/><p>\"Human! As you have wished for it, Your Majesty shall head down there personally! It's time for you to shiver under the might of Your Majesty!\" Sovereign King Wei's eyes were filled with loathing.</p><br/><p>Slicing through the void with his hands, he dived right in and headed straight for the Despair City.</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>At this moment, Lin Fan's demeanor was maxed out as he engaged in casual conversation with the elders of the six major sects. Looking at their looks of reverence towards him, he did feel a bit of glee in his heart.</p><br/><p>The adoring gazes of the masses and the respect of them all...</p><br/><p>What an amazing feeling this was?</p><br/><p>Back in the Xuanhuang World, Yours Truly had always been such a high profile figure. Upon entering the Ancient Saint World, this should be the way things should continue being.</p><br/><p>Seemed like if one had the capabilities, no matter where one went, they would be met with the same treatment.</p><br/><p>Initially, the elders of the six major sects had extended their invitations for Lin Fan to be a guest at their sects. After all, Lin Fan was such a powerful being in their eyes. It'd be good if they could string some ties with him so that they could seek his help lest they meet with any trouble in the Ancient Saint World in the future.</p><br/><p>However, to Lin Fan, time was of the essence. He did not have the spare time to indulge in enjoyments as such. It'd be good if he could use the time to kill some more ancient race beings.</p><br/><p>Because of that, he rejected them politely.</p><br/><p>Naturally, the elders of the six major sects were somewhat dejected. However, the thought that there was a Motherf*cking Human King within the beings of the thousands of races who would stand up against the ancient race instilled greater confidence in them for their future. Because of that, they still cheered up nevertheless.</p><br/><p>Looking at the elders of the six major sects deploying their own secret techniques to send their disciples back to their sects, Lin Fan prepared to leave this place as he headed forth as well.</p><br/><p>Now that he had overthrown the entire Despair City, there was still a Sovereign King Wei awaiting him. He would continue pushing forth one step at a time, till he had killed the utmost being of this district himself. That was the time when he would truly have what it took to challenge the ancient race outright.</p><br/><p>Humming his favorite tune, Lin Fan skipped happily, ready to leave this place.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, the void exploded open.</p><br/><p>\"HUMAN. Your Majesty's true self is here\u2026!\"</p><br/><p>\"EHHHHHH\u2026?\" Lin Fan stopped in his tracks. That happy smile on his face was wiped off entirely and replaced with a dumbstruck look.</p><br/><p>'Why the hell would there be an ancient race being in this world who took things so seriously?' Beads of perspiration began to drip down Lin Fan's forehead.</p><br/><p>\"Elders! I want to head to your sects as a guest!\" Right now, Lin Fan seriously regretted his actions. Why did he not agree to their invitations earlier on? If he had, he would have left this place successfully!</p><br/><p>However, it was all too late right now.</p><br/><p>After all, Sovereign King Wei was here personally.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

This lad was way too despicable, wasn\u2019t he? But at this moment, none of them had the luxury to think that much. This was a battle that they could not avoid anymore. Escaping was not going to be an option either. Although, it was not like they had nothing to gain out of this either.</p><br/><p>They had already calculated this through. Now that the Kunlun God Sect was short of a Senior Old Master, they were going to fight with a huge loss on their side. There was no reason why the Heaven and Earth Sect was going to take on a huge loss in this battle.</p><br/><p>A fight between Immortal Kings was not something that could be decided in a single instant. As to what the eventual outcome would be like, that much was obvious. The battle would naturally come to an end eventually with the Kunlun God Sect\u2019s fighting strength taking a major dip in the future. This was a battle that Heaven and Earth Sect would profit from for sure.</p><br/><p>The fact that Han Juntian had leveled up into the Immortal King state was already an extremely wonderful affair for the Heaven and Earth Sect. This was not even including this lad of theirs that had been producing an exceptionally stellar performance this entire time.</p><br/><p>Naturally, White Saint\u2019s wish right now was to have Lin Fan killed. However, Geng Yangtian blocked him in his way firmly.</p><br/><p>\u201cDO YOU REALLY WISH TO HAVE THINGS GET TO THIS POINT?\u201d White Saint howled out.</p><br/><p>Geng Yangtian was equally helpless right now. But at this moment, a fiery battle intent surged from the depths of his heart, \u201cIf you want to fight, fight. What\u2019s with all the nonsense you\u2019re spouting?\u201d</p><br/><p>BOOM!</p><br/><p>The entire world was suddenly filled with nothing but sounds of explosion.</p><br/><p>All the spectating beings retreated one after another; none of them wanted to be collateral damage.</p><br/><p>Right now, things were really beyond the point of madness. It was so mad that it left everyone frightened.</p><br/><p>A battle between the highest echelons of two major sects was not something normal they could have themselves dragged into at all. If any one of them were implicated, they would have no one to complain to even if they were to die.</p><br/><p>Looking at everything before him, Lin Fan\u2019s heart skipped with joy. At the same time, he started analyzing as well. The current situation was extremely chaotic. Given his strength, there was no way he could possibly be of much help. However, that Lin Brand\u2019s Soap that he had still possessed an incredible effect no matter what. Even though there were only two charges left, he would definitely be able to f*ck over some Senior Old Masters still.</p><br/><p>Although, there was really no hurry. Firstly, he had to earn a big, lump sum out of all of this. He would just let the Senior Old Masters from both sides duke it out with their guts for a round first while he reaped in the benefits like a fisherman.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Lin Fan cast his sight toward the headquarters of the Kunlun God Sect. There must naturally be no more powerful beings there right now!</p><br/><p>Given his current cultivation state as an Immortal Lord, he would definitely be able to barge his way in with force!</p><br/><p>Pshew!</p><br/><p>Without thinking more, Lin Fan dove right into the void and rushed toward the Kunlun God Sect.</p><br/><p>White Saint was naturally the first one to spot Lin Fan\u2019s shadow \u2014 he had been keeping an eye out for that fella the entire time. Now that he noticed that lad rushing for the Kunlun God Sect, his heart was naturally getting anxious.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhite Saint\u2026your opponent is me! Don\u2019t get careless now!\u201d Geng Yangtian chopped down with his palm, causing the void around them to explode. A battle between him and White Saint was one that was hard to have the dominant side determined. As for who would stand victorious if they were to continue fighting as such, no one could be the wiser.</p><br/><p>But, one thing was for sure: victory could definitely not be determined without an extended period of time.</p><br/><p>Powerful beings of the Immortal King state all had extremely profound foundations \u2014 there was no way of determining who was stronger than the other directly. And of course, Geng Yangtian had also noticed that lad out toward the Kunlun God Sect. His heart chuckled out \u2014 seemed like it was going to be a round of bad luck for the headquarters of the Kunlun God Sect now.</p><br/><p>Even though that lad\u2019s cultivation was not at the Immortal King state, given his strength right now, all the remaining fellas in the Kunlun God Sect would naturally not be a match for him.</p><br/><p>As for the other Immortal Lord state beings? Who knew, they might probably all have to take a huge loss in the hands of this disciple as well.</p><br/><p>At this moment, all disciples of the Kunlun God Sect felt as though they had just seen a ghost.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat fella is coming out for us!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHurry and retreat! We are not his match!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSave us! Who can come and save us, please?\u201d</p><br/><p>The scene earlier on was something that all of these disciples had witnessed personally. This person was way too savage and inhumane!</p><br/><p>Their Grandmaster had died in his hands. Heck, even Old Master Qi Tian had died in his hands!</p><br/><p>BAM!</p><br/><p>Lin Fan soared down from the void and landed right in the Kunlun God Sect. When the surrounding disciples caught sight of this brute, they yelped out and retreated instantly.</p><br/><p>At this moment, those Immortal Weapons behind Lin Fan were not used up just yet, floating behind him dense and clustered. Ordinary people would definitely be scared silly just by the sight of that.</p><br/><p>This fella was simply not a human!</p><br/><p>Looking at everything before him, Lin Fan\u2019s lips curled into a smile. This was the Kunlun God Sect! Now that all of their Senior Old Masters were out fighting with the Old Masters of the Heaven and Earth Sect, there was definitely no powerful being who could stand in his way!</p><br/><p>\u201cAs long as the Kunlun God Sect does not die, I\u2019m going to fight it out with you!\u201d At this moment, a single disciple crowd burst out of them to attack Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan took a single glance at him, unbothered at all as he sent a slap flying over, \u201cYou look decent, so I\u2019m not going to kill you.\u201d</p><br/><p>For a disciple to still be able to come forth at a moment as such was something that Lin Fan could not help but feel impressed with. Therefore, he naturally had mercy in his strike and did not kill the other party.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, it was not as though he was some mass massacring maniac. Only the truly powerful beings were his targets. As for the rest of the shrimps, he might as well forget it. They should be allowed to have a good chance to grow. Who knew, perhaps one of them might just turn out to become a powerful being somewhere!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere is the treasure ground of the Kunlun God Sect? One of you come and tell me.\u201d Lin Fan looked at the surrounding disciples and asked.</p><br/><p>However, all of them kept their guards up while staring back at him. How could they possibly let him know of the most important place in their sect? Therefore, all of them kept their lips sealed.</p><br/><p>\u201cHeaven and Earth Sect! You guys are really overboard with your bullying!\u201d At this moment, a long streak of light bolted down from the void.</p><br/><p>When the disciples of the Kunlun God Sect caught sight of who it was, they exclaimed in joy, \u201cVice Grandmaster Xing Tian\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan focused his gaze over as his lips curled into a grin. Decent cultivation state there, Immortal Lord state. However, he was far weaker compared to Tai Qiantian.</p><br/><p>\u201cOi, don\u2019t you get things mixed up now. Our Heaven and Earth Sect will never ever bully others. It was a fair fight, get it? But, I suppose it\u2019s time for you to let me know where the Treasure Chamber of the Kunlun God Sect lies, eh?\u201d Lin Fan asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cDream on!\u201d Vice Grandmaster Xing Tian roared out. He was equally infuriated as everyone else here. To think that the Heaven and Earth Sect would be this audacious and really declare war against the Kunlun God Sect! Furthermore, the status of the battle outside was extremely intense right now, and the Kunlun God Sect wasn\u2019t even at an advantage!</p><br/><p>\u201cHais! Truly uncooperative!\u201d Lin Fan shook his head helplessly. These fellas were truly way too uncooperative with his line of work. He did not even have the intention of taking their lives, yet none of them knew what was good for them!</p><br/><p>Aiyoh, aiyoh\u2026!</p><br/><p>Right then, Vice Grandmaster Xing Tian struck out instantly in front of Lin Fan. Hurling out a single fist, he shattered the air in front of him.</p><br/><p>\u201cDIE\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>All of the surrounding disciples of the Kunlun God Sect yelled out excitedly.</p><br/><p>\u201cFight on, Vice Grandmaster!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet this fella know of the power of our Kunlun God Sect!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right! You must definitely seek revenge for our Grandmaster!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGrandmaster died such a terrible death! He was a really good man, and yet, he was slain by this person so mercilessly!\u201d</p><br/><p>The eyes of Vice Grandmaster Xing Tian shone with an infinite gleam. He definitely had to bring out his fullest strength to try and get revenge for the Grandmaster!</p><br/><p>Looking at the fist that was expanding continuously in his pupils, Lin Fan\u2019s lips curled into a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cTrue Origins Crushing Kick\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>This was move that he had not deployed for a long time now, so much so that he had almost forgotten about it.</p><br/><p>But, given the situation right now, there was no way he wouldn\u2019t use it! The other party had split his feet wide open, revealing that preciously vulnerable place of his! This was just forcing Lin Fan to use this ultimate move of his!</p><br/><p>BAM!</p><br/><p>Right at that moment, a clean, crushing sound rang out.</p><br/><p>The entire Kunlun God Sect fell silent. All of those once cheering disciples went silent as well as they looked over at Lin Fan in stupefaction. It was truly as though they had bumped into a ghost right now.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p></div>\n</div>"}

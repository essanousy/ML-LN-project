The strength of Your Master God isn\u2019t something that someone like him can possibly break through! The Power of Whirlwind can shred even the Heaven and Earth apart! With just his mere physical flesh body, what capabilities could he have?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan\u2019s face tensed up as he exuded a ferocious aura. \u201cShred the Heaven and Earth? Who are you trying to bluff?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSHRED!\u201d</p><br/><p>BAM!</p><br/><p>As Lin Fan extended his hand into that whirlwind, the sharp Power of Whirlwind sliced out at it repeatedly.</p><br/><p>Slice!</p><br/><p>Slice!</p><br/><p>Fresh blood sprayed out everywhere. Even though Lin Fan\u2019s Physical Body State was already at the Immortal King state, it was rather surprising that his entire arm would still have wounds sliced out under the effect of that razor sharp whirlwind.</p><br/><p>\u201cHAHA! How is that? Soon, your arm is going to disappear entirely!\u201d The Whirlwind Master God roared out in laughter. Being wrapped by the whirlwind, he felt no fear at all. He knew that his powers were unrivaled. For an Indigenous Being as such to dream of going against his whirlwind with just his flesh body alone was definitely just a dream!</p><br/><p>Looking at everything before him, the Boundless Future Buddha Lord spoke out to the other three Master Gods around him, \u201cStrike\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The auras of the Chasm Master God, Contract Master God, and the Void Master God exploded out with a ferocity that blanketed the entire world in an extremely sharp power, intending to crush Lin Fan\u2019s back.</p><br/><p>Right now, Lin Fan\u2019s only thought was to have the Whirlwind Master God crushed. But all of a sudden, he sensed a strong surge of power from the Boundless Future Buddha Lord and the other few Master Gods coming from behind him. Those powers coming from four sources were extremely formidable. If he were to be struck by it, that would definitely pose some troubles for him.</p><br/><p>Sensing that, Lin Fan\u2019s aura took on a stark change, causing a great amount of power to gush into that Heaven and Earth Sutra on his back. Thereafter, golden text characters flew out into the skies one after another and burst forth with a brilliant gleam of light.</p><br/><p>For a long time now, Lin Fan had not used the Heaven and Earth Sutra. But now that his strength had already reached that of an Immortal King, the powers within his body were definitely enough to sustain the Heaven and Earth Sutra at this point.</p><br/><p>When the Boundless Future Buddha Lord caught sight of those text characters, his expression changed slightly. As for the other three Master Gods, they did not let it bother them at all as their powers continued to pour out just like a raging river.</p><br/><p>Clang!</p><br/><p>A metallic sound rang forth as the combined powers of the Boundless Future Buddha Lord and the three Master Gods made contact with the Heaven and Earth Sutra.</p><br/><p>The \u2018Kill\u2019 text character started encircling the Boundless Future Buddha Lord as an extremely sharp killing aura shot out at him, who roared out in rage, \u201cDamn it! Do you think that you will be able to hold back Your Buddha Lord with just these alone?\u201d</p><br/><p>Right now, Lin Fan did not even have the spare energy to pay any attention to the Boundless Future Buddha Lord. He sent a surge of powers to gush right into the Heaven and Earth Sutra, bringing forth ten text characters to hold the Boundless Future Buddha Lord off.</p><br/><p>With that, Lin Fan turned his gaze toward the Whirlwind Master God. \u201cYou will definitely have to die today.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Whirlwind Master God merely scoffed out on hearing that remark, totally unfazed by Lin Fan in the slightest bit. \u201cIndigenous Being, before you talk about killing Your Master God, I would ask you to check out your arm properly first.\u201d</p><br/><p>Right now, a series of cuts were already starting to shred Lin Fan\u2019s arm that was in the middle of the whirlwind. In fact, the flesh and blood that was exposed was even starting to pulsate out.</p><br/><p>The experience points for Lin Fan\u2019s Physical Body State were shooting up furiously at this moment. However, he did not have the mood to be bothered about raising that at this moment. Instead, he just wanted to have the Whirlwind Master God killed.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan roared out as the Mythical Parasol Tree within his body burst forth with a formidable amount of life force. \u201cWhirlwind Master God, do you really think that you can keep Yours Truly away with just these capabilities?\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, that arm of Lin Fan which was filled with wounds healed up all of a sudden. Once more, the razor sharp whirlwind ripped out at it; however, each time a single wound was created, it would be healed back by the life force, leaving not even a single scar behind.</p><br/><p>As for the Boundless Future Buddha Lord, he was being pestered by the Heaven and Earth Sutra at this moment. With the sustenance of Lin Fan\u2019s profound powers, one text character would rush forth and strike at the Boundless Future Buddha Lord each time he managed to suppress the previous one.</p><br/><p>Sensing this, Boundless Future Buddha Lord roared, \u201cWhirlwind Master God, hurry and retreat! The strength of this lad is not something you can defend against!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too late\u2026!\u201d Lin Fan howled out as his arm jerked out momentarily, sending forth an endless stream of Immortal Arts that penetrated through that whirlwind.</p><br/><p>Catching sight of this, the Whirlwind Master God was stunned. He had realized that the strength of this Indigenous Being had suddenly increased! Right now, he could understand why the Boundless Future Buddha Lord was warning him earlier on to retreat. However, it was all too late by now.</p><br/><p>BOOM!</p><br/><p>With a maddened roar, the Boundless Future Buddha Lord shouted out and suppressed Lin Fan\u2019s Heaven and Earth Sutra. Right after, a bright flash of Buddhist light shone out, suppressing all the Heaven and Earth Sutra characters that were bothering the other three Master Gods as well. He then barked out, \u201cKill that lad!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan\u2019s mighty strength was just pummelling down, cutting through the whirlwind entirely before grabbing out at the brains of the Whirlwind Master God.</p><br/><p>\u201cArgh! Damn it!\u201d The face of the Whirlwind Master God changed. He had not expected that this Indigenous Being would actually be this formidable to be able to pierce through his Power of Whirlwind!</p><br/><p>The Whirlwind Master God yelled out, causing the power from the God Core within his body to burst forth. With that, an even sharper whirlwind erupted forth from the top of his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cTo think that you would even dare to dream of defending at a moment like this. You\u2019re just absolutely trying to court death.\u201d Lin Fan was totally disregarding the three other Master Gods as well as the Boundless Future Buddha Lord right now. Within his palm, a tremendous amount of power erupted forth that repressed the powers of the Whirlwind Master God\u2019s God Core entirely.</p><br/><p>Spreading his fingers wide open, Lin Fan grabbed the head of the Whirlwind Master God with a single palm while an enormous force emanated from it.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhirlwind Master God, you can go and die now!\u201d Lin Fan roared out in laughter. At this moment, the powers that were sent forth by the Boundless Future Buddha Lord and the three other Master Gods had exploded out at Lin Fan as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cINDIGENOUS BEING, YOU\u2019D DARE!\u201d</p><br/><p>BAM!</p><br/><p>Lin Fan did not hesitate as he tightened his grip with his fingers, caving in the head of the Whirlwind Master God and smashing it right away. At the same time, a boundless amount of power rushed down from his head area as well, causing his God Core to be shattered.</p><br/><p>This was a Master God, an Immortal King state being. Smashing his head into sludge wasn\u2019t going to kill him \u2014 the only way to have him killed was by destroying his God Core entirely.</p><br/><p>BAM!</p><br/><p>Powers from four sources struck out and shot right into Lin Fan\u2019s body. As a result, he wobbled over while the four different powers cruised their way around his entire body. Without thinking twice, he bolted away in a flash to increase the distance between him and the four of them. At the same time, he coughed out a mouthful of fresh blood, spraying it out into the air.</p><br/><p>When the Void Master God caught sight of the slain Whirlwind Master God, he howled out, \u201cINDIGENOUS BEING, YOU\u2019RE F*CKING LOOKING TO DIE\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan\u2019s back was in an extremely terrible state; this was especially the case when the four different powers were running rampant and wreaking havoc in his entire physical body.</p><br/><p>\u2018Ding\u2026 Discovered four different destructive powers contained in the body. Suppressing them right away.\u2019</p><br/><p>At that instant, a notification from the System rang out, and the four different powers were repressed down immediately.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smirked out with joy as he wiped away the fresh blood from the sides of his lips. He then raised his head. \u201cHow about now? Yours Truly has just slain that Whirlwind Master God right in front of your faces. But, what could you do about that? Next up, it\u2019s the turn for you three Master Gods. And of course, the last will be you, Boundless f*cking Future Buddha Lord.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you really think that you will get the chance to do so?\u201d The Contract Master God barked out furiously.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan gave a nonchalant smile as his life force gushed out and began healing his body entirely. \u201cHow do we know unless we give it a shot?\u201d</p><br/><p>The brows of the Boundless Future Buddha Lord furrowed. He had not expected that this lad would be so difficult to deal with. And not only that, his strength was even greater than before! This was truly unexpected.</p><br/><p>\u201cFellow Master Gods, we must definitely combine forces later on. This time around, we must absolutely not let this lad escape. Otherwise, he will definitely be a thorn in our flesh.\u201d The Boundless Future Buddha Lord remarked.</p><br/><p>The Contract Master God glared at Lin Fan and declared with a baleful expression, \u201cThis person has got to die today!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan curled his fingers into fists, giving off cracking sounds at the same time. His body then trembled out, causing a strong aura to gush out from within his body. \u201cVery well! Let\u2019s give it a shot today then. Time to see if I can get all of you guys butchered!\u201d</p><br/><p>This time around, Lin Fan somehow did not make any preparations to run at all.</p><br/><p>Since this was how things were going to be, he might as well slaughter at them till the entire world was shrouded in a veil of darkness.</p></div>\n</div>"}

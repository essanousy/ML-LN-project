Right now, he was fighting against the strongest enemy within the loops of reincarnation.</p><br/><p>Within a patch of nothingness, Lin Fan stood upright. Before him was a gigantic golden Buddha that was emanating a boundless might. The light at the back of his head was exceptionally blinding.</p><br/><p>It was like the scorching sun that shone down on the entire world, purifying the Heaven and Earth.</p><br/><p>This was the Light of Buddhist Nature, an intrinsic light which revelled and grew in its own power. Everything about it was at a state of completion, with no shortcomings and obstacles in its way: it was free.</p><br/><p>If this were the true Infinite Buddha Ancestor, the Light of Buddhist Nature would naturally be able to shine down on the entire world and permeate through all worldly desires and lies. But, because this was the Light of Buddhist Nature from the Boundless Future Buddha Lord, it was filled with a crafty and sinister nature, placing its priority in bewitching the masses.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour sins are deep, and you are shrouded by the fires of evil karma. At the same time, you are caged by the Three Poisons: Desire, Anger, and Foolishness. The only way for you to have hope for life is if you place down the butcher\u2019s knife and convert under me.\u201d The Boundless Future Buddha Lord spoke up.</p><br/><p>That solemn face of his emitted a radiant golden gleam. This was especially the case for that swastika symbol on his forehead, which further emanated a boundless power.</p><br/><p>The Boundless Future Buddha Lord could peer through the future and seize control of it, dodging everything ranging from karma and retribution.</p><br/><p>Within the Buddha race of the Endless Mainland, he was one of the top three powerful beings.</p><br/><p>\u201cBullsh*t! Yours Truly is filled with poison from my five viscera and six bowels! Every single being in this entire world is tainted. That is what nature is all about, what the true world is! Your sort of \u2018seeing through everything\u2019 is nothing more than a form of escapism! And yet, you dare to speak of teachings to Yours Truly?\u201d Lin Fan roared out. At this moment, Lin Fan was no longer expending his powers for this. He was just at an optimum state of being right now.</p><br/><p>BOOM!</p><br/><p>The tremendous power gathered in thousands of mystic skills of martial arts. In the blink of an eye, all of these mystic skills were deployed. One after another, they turned into a series of mystic skill dragons that coiled around the entire void.</p><br/><p>A single palm to shock the Heavens!</p><br/><p>A single palm to rattle the Earth!</p><br/><p>\u201cYours Truly is the true Master of all!\u201d Lin Fan roared out as he entered a massacre against the Boundless Future Buddha Lord straightaway.</p><br/><p>In this place, Lin Fan was omnipotent. But, it was the same case for the Boundless Future Buddha Lord as well.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Maple Leaf City\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cTo think that after all this time, we would return to where we came from.\u201d When Qiu Zhanyu looked at this familiar city, he could not help but lament out.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d Jin Zhengu nodded his head. Everything here was ever so familiar.</p><br/><p>At the city entrance, when the guards saw that it was the princess\u2019 convoy that had returned, they naturally let down their guards.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh? I remember that there were no victims of disasters or anything like that in the Maple Leaf City back when we had left, right?\u201d Qiu Zhanyu looked out and saw many refugees with yellowed skin and tattered clothes sitting on the city walls, their faces filled with a look of despair.</p><br/><p>When Jin Zhengu caught sight of this, he turned around at Feng Yanyun questioningly. He did not know just what had happened here.</p><br/><p>\u201cHais\u2026!\u201d Feng Yanyun shook her head helplessly, \u201cIn the recent years, there have had been many wars and stuff that happened in the Maple Forest City. The areas at the borders of the city were all destroyed. These people are all refugees who escaped over from there. I\u2019ve already arranged for people to take care of them. I\u2019m sure we will be able to settle them down before long.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qiu Zhanyu and Jin Zhengu were not people without knowledge of the world. When they heard the words of Feng Yanyun, they understood the things as well. The martial artists who were well versed in mystic skills of the martial arts would be satisfied as long as they could achieve a higher cultivation state. But, these commoners could only endure the descent of calamity and tragedy.</p><br/><p>The two of them exchanged glances with one another as they understood in their hearts why the princess had wanted them to come over to the Maple Forest City.</p><br/><p>She wanted to seek their help.</p><br/><p>At this moment, both of them hesitated. How could they do this? They had to ensure that their Big Bro was safe! With that, how could they be embroiled in this?</p><br/><p>Thinking that, the both of them were stuck in a dilemma.</p><br/><p>When Feng Yanyun caught sight of the expression of the both of them, she spoke up, \u201cThe reason why I invited the both of you sirs back is that I hope that you guys can lend us your assistance.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Qiu Zhanyu and Jin Zhengu heard that, their hearts froze. Indeed, it was as they had thought.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat should we do?\u201d Jin Zhengu did not know what he should do at this point.</p><br/><p>Maple Forest City was their hometown. Now that they were here and had seen the state it was in right now, they knew that even if they wanted to leave, no one would stop them. They would just harbor the unwillingness in their own hearts.</p><br/><p>Qiu Zhanyu did not say anything, but eventually nodded his head silently.</p><br/><p>\u201cPrincess, we\u2019ll agree to it. However, you must first get us to a spacious place.\u201d Qiu Zhanyu said.</p><br/><p>The moment Feng Yanyun heard those words, she leaped with joy, \u201cSure, sure\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>That expression of hers was emotional beyond anything else. She knew that the two men before her were truly willing to stay now!</p><br/><p>Maple Forest City had True Immortal state powerful being. But, there was only one of them, and it was this person beside her.</p><br/><p>If there were three True Immortal state powerful beings in the Maple Forest City, they would definitely have more confidence in their ability to protect themselves!</p><br/><p>And, the reason why Qiu Zhanyu and Jin Zhengu wanted a spacious place was so that they could build an underground secret chamber to settle Lin Fan down within. If there were truly any hiccups, they had to ensure that their Big Bro was protected still.</p><br/><p>Three years later\u2026</p><br/><p>Qiu Zhanyu and Jin Zhengu had already resided within the Maple Forest City for three years now. At the same time, they had become the pillars of support for the Maple Forest City.</p><br/><p>Any intruders they met with were all sent retreating under the might of Qiu Zhanyu and Jin Zhengu.</p><br/><p>Even if they met a powerful being, both of them used their Supreme Grade Immortal Weapon, the Heaven and Earth Net. Therefore, there was practically no one who was their match.</p><br/><p>Time and again, they sent the enemies retreating. At the same time, staying in the Maple Forest City year after year had both of them growing even deeper feelings toward this hometown of theirs.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Qiu Zhanyu and Jin Zhengu looked at Lin Fan, who was lying on a bed, and let out a disappointed expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt has been three years, and Big Bro has yet to wake up.\u201d Jin Zhengu said.</p><br/><p>\u201cHais! If only we knew what was going on, that\u2019d be nice. Big Bro is really way too irresponsible! Couldn\u2019t he at least tell us just how long he was going to sleep for?\u201d Qiu Zhanyu remarked as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go. We don\u2019t even know if we can make it back this time around at all.\u201d Jin Zhengu continued.</p><br/><p>Qiu Zhanyu nodded his head before pressing down on a switch. With that, the bed before him gradually descended into the ground deeper by each moment until it disappeared from sight completely.</p><br/><p>Qiu Zhanyu then took out broken rocks one after another from his storage ring to seal the entrance of the secret chamber tightly, such that it looked the same as the outside world\u2019s surroundings.</p><br/><p>If both of them did not lead the way, no one would be able to tell that there was a secret chamber at this place.</p><br/><p>After that, Qiu Zhanyu and Jin Zhengu flew into the void.</p><br/><p>In the past three years, both of their cultivation states had improved tremendously, and they were now True Immortal full cultivation state beings. They were the two most powerful beings in the entire Maple Forest City, and were respected by all the people here.</p><br/><p>In the hearts of many commoners, Qiu Zhanyu and Jin Zhengu were their protectors.</p><br/><p>At the Main Hall of the Maple Forest City\u2026</p><br/><p>With the help of Qiu Zhanyu and Jin Zhengu, Feng Yanyun had managed to eradicate the issues they had within the city internally and taken over as the ruler. As for Qiu Zhanyu and Jin Zhengu, they became the top tiered existences of the city.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs everything settled properly?\u201d Feng Yanyun\u2019s face was filled with some slight worries. But, when she looked at Qiu Zhanyu and Jin Zhengu, it was still a face that had immense gratitude on it nevertheless.</p><br/><p>It was because these two had helped the Maple Forest City to defend against countless powerful beings back then that the city was able to get to where it was today.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Qiu Zhanyu and Jin Zhengu nodded their heads.</p><br/><p>Feng Yanyun knew that the Big Bro of these two had been deep in slumber for a long time now. She had heard that the strength of this Big Bro of theirs was extremely formidable. If he were to awaken, any issues would become insignificant.</p><br/><p>However, she bore a skeptical attitude toward this fact.</p><br/><p>\u201cSet off.\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, there was already a huge army that was gathered outside the Maple Forest City. The aura of this army was far from ordinary, bearing with them an extremely sharp Killing Qi.</p><br/><p>This was a Killing Qi that had an extraordinary impact. It was absolutely not something that ordinary people could possess.</p><br/><p>In the depths of this army\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior brother, you\u2019re full of ideas indeed! To think that you would seek out the Massacring Qi, Despair Qi, Fright Qi, Calamity Qi, and Killing Qi from inciting the wars of mere mortals. With the five Qi gathered, the \u2018Five Qi True Demonic Skill\u2019 we\u2019ve been cultivating will be able to break through to the next level, and reach a full cultivation state!\u201d A malevolent-looking man sniggered.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph! For all these years, we\u2019ve caused so many wars to break out, and have long gathered a robust amount of the Five Qi. From this day forth, this Maple Forest City shall vanish into smoke entirely!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, senior brother, I\u2019ve heard that the two people from the Maple Forest City possess an Immortal Weapon with them. Could it be that you have found some way to counter them or something, senior brother?\u201d The man asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s of course. When the time comes, you will find out for yourself.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

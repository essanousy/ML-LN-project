Number of usages: 3.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll f*ck your mother! Why are you always crafting all these nonsensical items?\u201d Lin Fan was stunned. He was a bloody Saint Immortal powerful being at the very least right now! Anything else aside, just that strength alone would put him as one of the powerhouses of the entire Endless Mainland! And yet, he was still crafting out stuff like this! Was the System trying to do him in?</p><br/><p>What should he do when he faced an enemy in the future? Throw the soap at them? That image might actually be rather pretty. High! The System must be high right now!</p><br/><p>Lin Fan sighed out, truly not knowing what he should say anymore. At times, he clearly wanted to just craft out something good, yet one could look at the things crafted out instead. That Nine Five Legendary Brick was a perfect example of something good. One could take it out easily, and it looked tyrannical and mysterious as well.</p><br/><p>Even though this soap that he had crafted out wasn\u2019t a one-time use object, what was the difference between three times and one time? Also, he did not even know what the effects would be like.</p><br/><p>Looking at the snow white bar of soap in his hand, Lin Fan secretly took a whiff. Holy sh*t! F*cking hell! This aroma was tyrannical! To think that it would bring this kind of serious fragrance along with it! Lin Fan then tossed the soap into his storage.</p><br/><p>Arranging the Immortal weapons he had crafted, Lin Fan was pretty pleased.</p><br/><p>Ten Supreme Grade Immortal Weapons.</p><br/><p>Fifty Upper Grade Immortal Weapons.</p><br/><p>Hundred Middle Grade Immortal Weapons.</p><br/><p>Two hundred Lower Grade Immortal Weapons.</p><br/><p>The Legendary Items for crafting weapons within that Triple Emperor Heaven Cache were just heaven revolting! For it to possess that many Legendary Items, was it trying to mass produce Immortal Weapons?</p><br/><p>However, what Lin Fan definitely did not know was that if those Legendary Items for crafting weapons were to be truly used for crafting, there would be a huge rate of failure. Even being able to craft a single Supreme Grade Immortal Weapon out of those would have been pretty decent already.</p><br/><p>For someone as sick as Lin Fan who could create an Immortal Weapon with every single casual craft, he could practically become an Immortal Weapon wholesaler right now! Sick! Way too sick!</p><br/><p>\u201cEh? There\u2019s news from the sect?\u201d At this moment, Lin Fan realized that the token from the sect was flashing with a bright light. Other than a symbol of his identity, this token acted as a medium for transmitting messages as well. If there were any major issues, the sect would make use of the token to transmit it to every single disciple.</p><br/><p>Upon receiving the news, Lin Fan\u2019s brows furrowed. \u2018Interesting!\u2019</p><br/><p>The Heaven and Earth Sect and the Kunlun God Sect had broken out into a full-scale war.</p><br/><p>Even though it was not yet at the point where everyone from the top to bottom of the sect was gathered to attack the Kunlun God Sect, it was still at a state whereby any single Kunlun God Sect disciple met outside was to be slain without any mercy.</p><br/><p>At the same time, there was a private message from Han Juntian\u2019s consciousness in the token.</p><br/><p>\u201cLad, the sect has really stuck out for you this time around. If you don\u2019t grow to a state Your Grandmaster can be pleased about, Your Grandmaster will definitely teach you a good lesson.\u201d</p><br/><p>After receiving the message, Lin Fan\u2019s face was filled with exasperation. What the hell did this have to do with him again? But, based on everything that had happened earlier on, he could more or less guess that this issue must have truly had a great deal to do with him.</p><br/><p>He had killed four of the Grandmaster Candidates from the Kunlun God Sect in a row. If it were any person who had a bad heart, they might have even died of a heart attack over the news. Naturally, this was definitely not something that the Grandmaster of the Kunlun God Sect, Tai Qiantian, could ignore.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked far into the distance. Since this matter had something to do with him, he naturally could not just ignore it. If this were him in the past, he would definitely go into hiding. With that weak strength of his, wouldn\u2019t he just be killed if he were to go out?</p><br/><p>However, things were different now. With his strength being raised to this extent, coupled with the few hundreds of Immortal Weapons, even in just dragging the fights on, Lin Fan could outlast all of those fellas.</p><br/><p>Seemed like the most tyrannical battle of his entire life was about to begin. Lin Fan\u2019s heart was filled with an endless thirst as well.</p><br/><p>Pshew!</p><br/><p>Without thinking much about it, he dove right into the void and headed toward the Heaven and Earth Sect.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>After a long time, Lin Fan came across someone familiar somewhere. In the void, he saw a figure that was escaping frantically.</p><br/><p>\u201cBeasts! You guys are really beasts! I, Ling Wuzun, did not even bother you guys! What are you guys trying to do?\u201d Ling Wuzun was wailing out terribly. After coming out of the sect to cultivate, he had been through quite a number of things and had met quite a lot of people. All of those things gave quite a boost to his cultivation state.</p><br/><p>Back in the sect, Lin Fan was just like a gigantic mountain that was crushing down on his body, leaving him totally incapable of fighting back.</p><br/><p>Earlier on, he had met some disciples of the sect. Ling Wuzun had even let down his pride as a Remnant to travel along with them. But to think that he would bump into bloodthirsty Kunlun God Sect disciples along the way!</p><br/><p>Without saying anything, those Kunlun God Sect disciples started whacking him straight up. Their methods were extremely ruthless as well, leaving him with no chance to speak up at all!</p><br/><p>It was only later on that he understood the reason why \u2013 the Heaven and Earth Sect had declared war against the Kunlun God Sect.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat fella is a Remnant of the Heaven and Earth Sect! If we were to kill him, we would be able to obtain a reward from the sect!\u201d A bunch of disciples from the Kunlun God Sect had a bright glint in their eyes as though they had just caught sight of a huge prey.</p><br/><p>Ling Wuzun\u2019s strength wasn\u2019t weak at all. However, neither were these disciples of the Kunlun God Sect! Every single move they made caused lightning to crackle out. There was even a Mystic Immortal full cultivation state powerful being amongst them!</p><br/><p>Ling Wuzun didn\u2019t run far before he was rounded up by those disciples. When he looked at them all, he felt his heart skip a beat, \u201cWhat are you guys trying to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Wuzun gulped down his saliva. The world outside was extremely treacherous. Initially, as long as he depended on his own strength and did not mess with any sick and twisted powerful beings, he would not run into any troubles. But right now, he was no longer the one looking for trouble with others; others were the ones who were knocking up his door.</p><br/><p>\u201cHeaven Encompassing Palm!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Mystic Immortal disciple of the Kunlun God Sect struck out immediately as he slapped out with his palm and covered the entire sky, shrouding Ling Wuzun within it. That formidable power found itself gushing right into the depths of Ling Wuzun\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>It was impossible to defend against\u2026absolutely impossible!</p><br/><p>\u201cScorching Sun\u2019s Blaze!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Wuzun roared out as a gigantic Sun appeared behind his back, scorching the entire world with its flames.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph! Remnant Ling Wuzun of the Heaven and Earth Sect, you shall die here!\u201d</p><br/><p>Creak!</p><br/><p>Under the might of that palm, that blazing Sun was breaking apart gradually before turning into bright sparks that dispersed in the void.</p><br/><p>Ling Wuzun\u2019s face was aghast right now. He had not expected that things would come to such a state! He was absolutely no match for the other party at all!</p><br/><p>The other party\u2019s cultivation base was at the Mystic Immortal full cultivation state, a little bit higher than his.</p><br/><p>\u201cLing Wuzun, how has your strength not grown at all?\u201d</p><br/><p>Just at his moment, a voice traveled out of the distant void. When Ling Wuzun raised his head to check it out, he was stunned and his expression changed slightly.</p><br/><p>When the disciples of the Kunlun God Sect heard this voice, they turned their heads over and leaped with joy, \u201cHAHA! To think that it\u2019s another disciple of the Heaven and Earth Sect! As long as we kill him, the rewards would be even more fabulous!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan floated out gently in the void and looked at these disciples of the Kunlun God Sect. Lifting his hand casually, he crushed down with a strength that withered everything in its path, slapping them to death immediately.</p><br/><p>With noobs as such, Lin Fan did not even want to waste his breath on them.</p><br/><p>But for Ling Wuzun, this was quite a huge blow. Those fellas had chased him half to death, and yet, they were all killed instantly in the hands of Lin Fan! Just how great a difference did they have in strength?</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior Brother Lin\u2026\u201d After barely escaping death, Ling Wuzun\u2019s face was totally helpless as he greeted politely.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan came beside Ling Wuzun and sized him up from head to toe, \u201cThere\u2019s some slight improvement in your strength, but it\u2019s not great. You\u2019ve got to work much, much harder.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Wuzun bowed his head low and replied, \u201cYes, I will always remember your teachings, senior brother.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p></div>\n</div>"}

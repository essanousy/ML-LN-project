Mingming's Heart Hurts!</p><br/><p>Translator: Lam_ Editor: Hitesh_</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the widely infamous Devil's Incarnate of the Xuanhuang World, Wang Xiaoming, bawling his eyes out at his thighs. If anyone else were to see this, they would definitely be so shocked their jaws would drop right down on the spot!</p><br/><p>\"Xiaoming, ah! Don't cry anymore!\" Lin Fan fondled his head gently, consoling him.</p><br/><p>\"No, uncle! You don't have to console me! Xiaoming really feels like crying right now!\" Wang Xiaoming was truly feeling aggrieved in his heart. All these years had really been way too trying for him!</p><br/><p>\"No, what I meant is that even if you want to cry, can you not do it while hugging your uncle's thighs? All your snot and tears are being rubbed on me!\" Lin Fan remarked in wild disdain.</p><br/><p>Wang Xiaoming raised his head and blinked his eyes while looking at Lin Fan. Feeling that was being ocstracized at this moment because of his actions, he commented out in sorrow.</p><br/><p>\"Uncle! Xiaoming feels miserable inside his heart!\" Wang Xiaoming said out sadly.</p><br/><p>\"What are you miserable about? Haven't you led a flamboyant life in the past hundred years? There is a whole bunch of geniuses out there who've been bullied by you. And you even turned into the cuckold next door hooking up with the chick of some other family. Heck, even the child is yours! And you are telling me you're miserable?\"</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan heard Wang Xiaoming complaining, he felt a little helpless. How could this guy be this shameless? He toyed around with those geniuses like they were monkeys for a full hundred years!</p><br/><p>And for him to mess with 10,000 people, it was needless to even elaborate on the process!</p><br/><p>This was especially the case for those female geniuses. Lin Fan wouldn't believe that Wang Xiaoming didn't take liberties with them even if it would cost him his life!</p><br/><p>The moment Wang Xiaoming heard this, his face froze up as he could not understand, \"Uncle Lin! What cuckold next door? What child? They're framing me!\"</p><br/><p>\"I tell you! A long time ago, there was a fella who kept insisting that I stole his wife! I told him I didn't, and he refused to believe me. He even struck at me! Because I could not take that lying down, I retaliated. It was only later on that I found out that someone had impersonated my name! And because of that, I bore this blame on me for dozens of years! No matter who I told it to, no one would believe me!\"</p><br/><p>Wang Xiaoming's eyes were brimming with tears, \"Uncle, the pain in the heart of this baby is something that I can tell no one to!\"</p><br/><p>\"I see.\" Lin Fan truly had not expected that Wang Xiaoming would be accused of the blame for no reason. And by the looks of it, the crime planted on him was pretty ridiculous.</p><br/><p>\"As for those geniuses, how are there so many of them? You can't have been bullying people everyday, right?\"</p><br/><p>Seeing this sheer number of people, Lin Fan was finding it hard to believe as well. If he had bullied one per day, he would only accumulate 365 in a single year! A hundred years meant that there would be 30,000+. Given the 10,000 geniuses, if Lin Fan were to divide them out, that was an average of one per three days!</p><br/><p>But, it was better when Lin Fan did not mention this. The moment he did, Wang Xiaoming cried out once more.</p><br/><p>\"Uncle! I've been wronged! Even after I count the max of the max, I would have bullied 6-7,000 people at most! The rest of them are just hopping onto the bandwagon for commotion, and talking about wanting to get rid of me! I didn't even provoke them at all! Now, don't you think that I'm having a hell of a bad luck life?\"</p><br/><p>Wang Xiaoming sobbed endlessly. Now that he had met Lin Fan, he could finally pour out all the grievances in his heart.</p><br/><p>By now, no one even knew who were the ones who were provoking the others! Out of nowhere, Wang Xiaoming had 3-4,000 extra enemies to deal with. If one did not know the truth, they might have thought that he had massacred their entire families!</p><br/><p>\"Hais! Seems like it has really been tough on you!\"</p><br/><p>After hearing the explanations of Wang Xiaoming, Lin Fan truly felt that the former was a tragedy. To think that even something as such could happen to him! However, since things had already come to this, he could only allow it to continue then.</p><br/><p>\"Uncle, can we just end it like this? Honestly, it was still pretty fun at the starting few dozens of years. But, the last dozens of years were practically tugging at my life!\"</p><br/><p>\"I miss my parents and everyone back home! However, I can't even return home right now! Look at this, uncle! As long as I were to head out, I would definitely be met with a group assault within half a day. Goodness! Is there even time for freedom anymore!?\"</p><br/><p>\"In the past hundred years, I couldn't even get myself a wife! By now, the Wang Family could even be considered as having no more descendants! For the sake of how pitiful I am, please help me, uncle!\"</p><br/><p>Wang Xiaoming teared up with deep emotions. This was so heartwrenching and emotional to watch!</p><br/><p>\"Weren't you the one who had let off a genius from your grasp personally? If you had taken her away along with the treasure, wouldn't that have all been fine and dandy?\" Lin Fan was still feeling that this was all because of Wang Xiaoming himself. He obviously had so many chances that were laid right before his eyes. Yet, he did not cherish them. Who else could he blame for that?</p><br/><p>\"Uncle, now that isn't right as well! Did you take a look at that female genius? She was absolutely ghastly! Those features of hers were so hideous you could practically shiver in her face! If not for the fact that she had a treasure back then, how could I even stick my face up there to lie to her?!\"</p><br/><p>\"Just that one occasion, I had to face that horrendous face of hers for three days and three nights! That was so scary that even Mingming's heart now has a scar within!\"</p><br/><p>The moment they spoke about that female genius, Wang Xiaoming's inner heart shivered in fear. That was a sin! She was a sin that no one in this world should bear!</p><br/><p>If not for the fact that his heart was firm enough, he might have been scared to death by her face!</p><br/><p>Lin Fan had not expected that the days of Wang Xiaoming in the past hundred years had been spent amidst such splendor and amazing things.</p><br/><p>\"Do you truly wish to head back? After you head back, what do you wish to do?\" Lin Fan asked.</p><br/><p>\"Yes, I truly wish to head back, uncle! If I give it a count, it's about time for me to head home and take over the seat of the Family Head from my father! I'll then simply enjoy life, maybe marry a few wives, have a few kids. That would be pretty enjoyable as well!\"</p><br/><p>After thinking for a moment, Wang Xiaoming felt that those type of days were the type that he really wanted.</p><br/><p>\"And, you never want to bully anyone ever again?\" Lin Fan asked.</p><br/><p>Wang Xiaoming waved his hands away hurriedly, \"No more, no more! After the past hundred years, the moment I bully anyone, I already feel like puking! Once I head back, I'm going to be a good man and help others regularly!\"</p><br/><p>'F*ck me!'</p><br/><p>The moment Lin Fan heard this, he was totally stumped. This was someone who had bullied out a sense of guilt from bullying others! He was completely turning over a new leaf right now!</p><br/><p>But no, that couldn't do either. Without this special body type of Wang Xiaoming, the progress of those Destined Children may be pretty slow. He had to let this continue on.</p><br/><p>\"Alright, uncle will bring you back now.\"</p><br/><p>Instantly, Lin Fan swept his robes and caged up Wang Xiaoming. He then dove through the void. The next moment, they appeared in the Wang Family manor.</p><br/><p>After a hundred years, the Wang Family was still standing strong, and had expanded their family strength. However, they kept their growth within the city.</p><br/><p>Right now, the Wang Family had grown to a terrifying extent. There were many family members and factions under their family.</p><br/><p>\"Eh? Uncle! Where's my father? Who is that fella! How is he the Family Head of the Wang Family now?\" Wang Xiaoming looked down at a middle aged man there in surprise.</p><br/><p>\"Xiaoming, it has been a hundred years. This is your sixth generation now. That is probably your great, great grandson's\u2026grandson.\" Lin Fan pointed out as a light screen appeared before Xiaoming.</p><br/><p>\"Take a look. Your father, your brother, your nephew, your nephew's son\u2026they're all cultivating in seclusion. Tell me, if you were to head back now, are you going to fight for the seat of the Family Head with your younger generations?\" Lin Fan asked.</p><br/><p>\"I-I\u2026!!!\" The moment Wang Xiaoming caught sight of this, he was thoroughly frozen. He could not even breathe properly right now. All he wanted to do was to cry.</p><br/><p>\"Uncle! This is not fair! I didn't even get the chance to experience what it's like being the Family Head! And now, there are already so many descendants! This sucks\u2026!\"</p><br/><p>Everything had changed too quickly, so quickly that Xiaoming was finding it hard to come to terms with.</p><br/><p>Hadn't he just not returned home for a mother*cking hundred years, and that was all? Why in the world did everything have to change this much?</p><br/><p>Lin Fan patted the shoulders of Wang Xiaoming and said in a deep, understanding tone, \"Ah Xiaoming, listen to your uncle here. Go on back and continue to bully others. Uncle promises you that once the time is ripe, uncle will give you an entire world. You can then be the World Head instead. How about that?\"</p><br/><p>With his Creator function now, Lin Fan would definitely collect more worlds in the future. By then, it would naturally not be an issue for him to give one of them to Xiaoming.</p><br/><p>\"Xiaoming, you aren't satisfied? Make it two then.\"</p><br/><p>Looking at Xiaoming's silence, Lin Fan thought that it was because one wasn't enough. Hence, he added one more to the deal.</p><br/><p>However, what Lin Fan did not know was that the moment Xiaoming heard that his uncle was going to make him a World Head, his heart was so overwhelmed with joy it was practically thumping out! Just as he was about to agree to it, he heard his uncle increase it to two! With that, he was so happy he nearly fainted!</p><br/><p>\"Uncle, three. As long as you agree to give me three, I'll continue to bully others.\" Wang Xiaoming said craftily.</p><br/><p>\"Sure, no problem! Isn't that just three? Uncle can afford it.\" At this moment, Lin Fan chuckled out. What a great child this was! He agreed to it with a mere discussion. Obedient! Good!</p><br/><p>\"Thank you, uncle\u2026!\" Wang Xiaoming was grinning ear to ear right now. The pains of the past hundred years had long been cast to the back of his head. For the current Wang Xiaoming, all that was in his mind was being the World Head!</p><br/><p>\"Sure.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled with satisfaction, then flicked out with his finger. A drop of blood vibrated intensely in the air before entering Wang Xiaoming's body.</p><br/><p>By now, all of those Destined Children had had their potentials raised by him personally. If he didn't give Wang Xiaoming some cheats to play with, this guy might truly be killed back and forth by those geniuses!</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

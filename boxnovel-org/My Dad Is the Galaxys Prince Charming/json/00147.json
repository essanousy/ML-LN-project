In less than a minute, the lower half of his body was soaked.</p><br/><p>Er\u2026 His water broke!</p><br/><p>(\u2299 o \u2299)</p><br/><p>Was he really going to give birth?</p><br/><p>\u201cB-boss, I was wrong, please save me\u2026 I\u2019ll die from the pain.\u201d He quivered in agony as he crawled towards Yao Si. When he finally exhausted his energy, his hands went soft and he fainted.</p><br/><p>Everyone continued to stare on dumbfound by the sight before gradually shifting their focus to Yao Si.</p><br/><p>She shuddered from the sudden attention. \u201cWhy are you looking at me? I don\u2019t know anything about delivering babies!\u201d She hurriedly turned toward Lu Chen. \u201cStop spacing out and carry him to the medical centre now!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh? Oh!\u201d Lu Chen regained his cool and signaled for a few employees to join him. Together, they frantically carried the bleeding Feng Xiao to the medical clinic.</p><br/><p>The medical standards of the Galaxy could indeed be trusted. Even after a huge blood loss, Feng Xiao was visibly better once he was sent into the surgical cabin.</p><br/><p>Yao Si and the clueless crowd could only wait patiently for updates.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis\u2026 What happened?\u201d Lu Chen stood in a daze, disregarding his blood-soaked palms. \u201cBoss, what\u2019s wrong with Feng Xiao\u2019s stomach? Why does he need you to save him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know!\u201d Yao Si was just as clueless as everyone else. \u201cI used my ability on him just now while he was escaping.\u201d Even though it was probably her ability\u2019s fault, how could a new life be formed out of nowhere! Wasn\u2019t such an ability too much?</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was indeed because of your ability.\u201d Mu Xuan frowned, then provided a resolute answer, \u201cSimilar to an explosion, your ability is able to destroy a person\u2019s genetic makeup. It can also cause the rapid splitting of the cells, which allowed his stomach to grow so big in such a short amount of time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d <em>F*ck, I really have the ability to impregnate others with a stare. </em></p><br/><p><em>Wait a minute!</em></p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you guys looking at me like that?\u201d Her lips twitched, and she howled at them, \u201cThe baby isn\u2019t mine!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p><em>Er, you weren\u2019t asking whose it was? </em></p><br/><p>\u201cMu Xuan\u2026\u201d She tugged onto his sleeve. \u201cHe\u2026 Is he really going to deliver a child?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow can delivering a baby be that easy?\u201d Mu Xuan caressed her head reassuringly, using a sincere gaze to calm her down. \u201cHis genetic makeup was modified, which resulted in a surge of oestrogen and cell reproduction. Even if there are eggs in his body now, there is no way he could have impregnated himself. It\u2019s probably just a huge tumor; it can\u2019t be\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWaaah!\u201d</p><br/><p>Before he could finish his sentence, two loud cries pierced through the silence.</p><br/><p>[Di! Congratulations, a pair of paternal twins were born! A joyous occasion indeed!]</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Yao Si.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Mu Xuan.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Lu Chen.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Supervisor Yuan.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d The crowd.</p><br/><p>Flips table!</p><br/><p>(\u256f\u2035\u25a1\u2032)\u256f\ufe35\u253b\u2501\u253b</p><br/><p>Didn\u2019t Mu Xuan say he wasn\u2019t going to give birth? Wasn\u2019t it just a tumor? How did it become twins?! Buy one get one for free?!</p><br/><p>Mu Xuan was left speechless as well, he then turned to the surgical room\u2019s screen to inspect the data. His face darkened with each passing second. After a few minutes, he turned the screen off, looking at her with a perplexed expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Yao Si shuddered from his gaze. <em>Is the child really mine? Don\u2019t scare me like that! </em></p><br/><p>\u201cSomething\u2019s wrong\u2026\u201d His expression looked odd. He paused before selecting a suitable term, \u201cCoincidence!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d What coincidence?</p><br/><p>\u201cYour ability had indeed altered his genetic makeup and allowed him to posses reproduction features.\u201d He coughed, struggling to maintain a straight face. \u201cThis means he is practically a female now, but since there were remnants of male\u2026 <em>cough\u2026 </em>that\u2026 what is required for reproduction. Because of your ability, his cells multiplied rapidly, forming a pair of twins.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Could you simplify your explanation? English is fine as well!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhich means\u2026\u201d He inhaled deeply before concluding. \u201d He really gave birth to a pair of twins.\u201d</p><br/><p><em>What? What? What? What are you saying? Why can\u2019t I understand a thing? </em></p><br/><p>\u201cWait a minute, let me process this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mu Xuan meant that\u2026 her ability turned the rebellion\u2019s leader Feng Xiao into a half woman with reproduction abilities. Still, he couldn\u2019t have impregnated himself. He would have had to participate in some R-rated act with a male for something like that to happen. However, coincidentally, there was such a substance from someone else still within him, resulting in a pregnancy.</p><br/><p>So the main point was\u2026</p><br/><p>A light bulb flashed Yao Si\u2019s mind as everything connected, and her eyes went wide in shock. \u201cFeng Xiao is a gay!\u201d</p><br/><p>Mu Xuan nodded.</p><br/><p><em>F*ck!</em></p><br/><p>Feng Xiao had to have had a rendezvous recently, and he hadn\u2019t taken a bath afterwards, so remnants of their time were still present. This allowed the impregnation to be possible.</p><br/><p>It was indeed a drama scene come to life!</p><br/><p>This also emphasized\u2026 the importance of personal hygiene!</p><br/><p>\u25cb|\uffe3|_</p><br/><p>More problems had surfaced!</p><br/><p>\u201cSupervisor Yuan\u2026\u201d Yao Si turned to the others who seemed more informed about the situation, but at some point, they had retreated five meters away from her. Only Mu Xuan was near her, \u201cWhy are you guys doing so far away?\u201d There were all crammed into a corner.</p><br/><p><em>F*ck, even Lu Chen is gone! </em></p><br/><p>\u201cB-boss! Do you need anything?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si\u2019s lips twitched. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t use my ability on you guys!\u201d Besides, hers was a passive ability, so she couldn\u2019t summon it even if she wanted. \u201cYou guys should be better acquainted with him. I wanted to ask, do any of you know the father/mother of the children?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis\u2026 I\u2019m not sure either.\u201d Supervisor Yuan stumbled back meekly as he shook his head. \u201cBoss, beasts normally retain their beastly characteristics which explains their level S physique, but their personal life\u2026 <em>cough\u2026 </em>can be a little complex. Since Feng Xiao is considered an aggressor in the race, he\u2026 <em>cough\u2026 </em>This can be considered a trait of their race.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d <em>Understood! It means that he has many backups, and it could be anyone. </em></p><br/><p>Having multiple sleeping partners could\u2026 cause lives! Two lives in this case.</p><br/><p>\u201cA test will have to be done to find the other parent.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si glanced over at Feng Xiao who was still unconscious. Since everything had been set in stone, there wasn\u2019t a need for her to get involved anymore. She passed all the proceedings over to the galactic police before turning around to leave.</p><br/><p>The moment she stepped out of the clinic, a collective sigh came from the male crowd behind her. It was as though they had been freed.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Yao Si.</p><br/><p>o(\u256f\u25a1\u2570)o</p><br/><p>She suddenly wanted to head back and take good at each one of them!</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>Yao Si and Mu Xuan stayed at the Ore Planet for about five days to tie up the loose ends. All the beasts that had participated in the rebellion had been brought into custody, and the moment Feng Xiao regained conscious, he was brought away as a criminal of high level danger. According to the reports, he had completely broken down and wasn\u2019t willing to acknowledge the twins that he had born.</p><br/><p>In order to ensure the safety of the twins, the police had sent them to the beasts planet and placed them up for adoption as orphans. No one would know of their parentage.</p><br/><p>After multiple tests had been conducted, it was discovered that the father of the children was the poor guy that Feng Xiao had pushed in front of himself to escape.</p><br/><p>This was indeed a shocking revelation. Even though Feng Xiao had killed him, he had used his own body to bore his children. It could be seen as a form of retribution.</p><br/><p>After all the events, the manpower on the Ore Planet was reduced by half, forcing it into a temporary closure. As the boss, Yao Si was required to remain a few more days to inspect the new employees.</p><br/><p>Yet ever since the news about the pregnancy had spread, she seemed to have met with an even bigger problem!</p></div>\n</div>"}

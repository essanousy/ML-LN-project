After a few chants by Old Liu, the blood on his palm flew towards the green flower, turning it red. The next instant a white one appeared beneath his feet, and just like in some kind of ritual, her optical computer floated up, merging with the flower.</p><br/><p>The whole scene was\u2026 magical.</p><br/><p>Where was the promised advanced technology, did she accidentally enter a fantasy filming set..?</p><br/><p>-_-|||</p><br/><p>\u201cThe celestial race requires more time to add the storage component.\u201d The manager thought Yao Si minded the long wait, so he diligently explained to her what was happening. \u201cBut Old Liu is experienced, with his skills, the stability will be assured.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh\u2026\u201d Old Liu was part of the celestial race, which then explained the whole mystical act! <em>I guess it isn\u2019t easy to do this\u2026</em></p><br/><p>Yao Si was reminded of a certain someone that had brought her sword on a sword to Red Planet. This was the most perfect blend of technology and cultural uniqueness. This galaxy\u2026 was just right. She had to just get used to it and everything would be fine.</p><br/><p>Yao Si waited patiently by the side, but after almost half an hour, she was starting to get bored. Her eyes wandered to the sides, and she caught sight of a button on the empty wall ahead.</p><br/><p><em>What\u2019s this?</em></p><br/><p>She couldn\u2019t help pressing it, and the wall before her lifted, exposing the luxurious buildings among the thick and fluffy clouds.</p><br/><p>\u201cOur store is located in the heart of Eternal Brightness,\u201d the manager explained when he saw her curiosity. \u201cWe have the best view in the entire city center.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si nodded. The view was indeed amazing, and it wasn\u2019t just because of the majestic buildings in front of her. Below the dense layer of clouds, one could faintly see a green field and some lakes, even a person flying over was in full sight\u2026</p><br/><p><em>Eh! Wait a minute.</em></p><br/><p><em>A person?</em></p><br/><p><em>F*ck, there is really a person flying over!</em></p><br/><p>\u201cSir, will that person flying over get hit?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss Yao, you\u2019re being humorous now. Eternal Brightness has strict regulations, no one is allowed to fly up to the stratosphere\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p><em>Gong!</em></p><br/><p>Before the manager could finish his sentence, a loud sound erupted, the glass in front of them shattering into pieces.</p><br/><p>A man in black entered, tumbling several times.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Yao Si</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d the manager.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Old Liu.</p><br/><p><em>Darn! </em>The glass from the future was so poorly made! If she had known, she would have hid somewhere!</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026 Who are you?\u201d the manager asked after a moment, his face filled with terror, and even Old Liu paused.</p><br/><p>The person in black stood up. After he glanced over the three of them, his gaze came to rest on Yao Si.</p><br/><p>Yao Si suddenly had an ominous feeling\u2026</p><br/><p>As expected, the next moment he rushed towards her, grabbing her by the neck. He then pulled out a red and golden weapon which he pointed to the other two. \u201cDon\u2019t move or she\u2019s dead.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si was speechless.</p><br/><p><em>F*ck! </em> Why was it her, she was the farthest away! Why was she so unlucky?</p><br/><p>After the man in black shouted his commands, a group of people rushed in. Unlike the one holding Yao Si, these wore a standard uniform. Their hands moved to their weapons, in unison, and they pointed them at the man.</p><br/><p><em>They should be the police, </em> she guessed.</p><br/><p>\u201cHei Shi, you\u2019re under arrest. Put your weapon down and surrender,\u201d the lead officer commanded.</p><br/><p>\u201cStep away or she\u2019s dead.\u201d The man in black wasn\u2019t the least bit affected. He pushed the weapon he held towards Yao Si\u2019s head, his grip tightening.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHei Shi, you committed so many crimes already. Do you really think you can escape Eternal Brightness?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStop moving, if i die she won\u2019t live either.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be rash, you won\u2019t be able to escape today, so what\u2019s the point in harming an innocent.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHeh, I\u2019ve already killed so many people, one more won\u2019t matter much.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if she dies, you won\u2019t be able to escape. Put down your weapon.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not certain yet. If you let <em>me </em> go, I\u2019ll let <em>her </em>go.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNever! You\u2019re awaiting a death penalty.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I can\u2019t live, she will die with me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRelease the hostage!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll die together!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey\u2026\u201d Yao Si raised an arm. \u201cCan you guys change a term? Stop saying the word die, okay?\u201d <em>It\u2019s making me anxious. </em>\u201cI might be late in mentioning this, but I\u2019m a bloodling.\u201d <em>The kind that\u2019s immune to death, you know?</em></p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Silence!</p>\n</div>"}

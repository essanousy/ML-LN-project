Notify Yao Qian,\u201d Yao Si shouted, gripping Qu Ze\u2019s collar with one hand. Her patience had completely evaporated and she didn\u2019t want to stay with this troublemaker any longer.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t.\u201d Qu Ze waved the hand that was covered in flower mucus innocently. \u201cOther than the ability to digest, this flower\u2019s juice also probably has the function of blocking out signals.\u201d Besides, he didn\u2019t have that man\u2019s contact number anyways.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what should we do?\u201d Surely that wasn\u2019t to stay here and be digested by the flower.</p><br/><p>\u201cSet your heart at ease, your highness,\u201d he replied carelessly. \u201cThe Gluttony can\u2019t digest bloodlings, soon it will realize we\u2019re not delicious and will spit us out.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Next time say such things earlier!</p><br/><p>Oh, the tired heart! Ever since Yao Si got involved in the civil war of the bloodlings as an innocent bystander, she had never been this tired. Yellow haired people were certainly no good folks.</p><br/><p>This time Qu Ze hadn\u2019t lied to her. After two hours being trapped inside the bud, Gluttony, as expected, opened up with a \u201cwah\u201d, vomiting the two people covered in mucus out. A root even extended from the ground to push them away in disgust.</p><br/><p>After being released, Yao Si turned on the optical computer on her hand at the first opportunity, wanting to get in contact with either Yao Qian or Yan Xuan. However, no matter how many times she clicked on their contact number, there was no response.</p><br/><p><em>What\u2019s happening? Did the optical computer break?</em></p><br/><p>\u201cOh, so the messages were not blocked by the flower juice!\u201d Qu Ze face was full of amusement, his energy showing no signs of him being anxious, on the contrary, he seemed to be slightly excited. \u201cIt looks like the magnetic field of this forest is quite special.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about your particle transmitter?\u201d Yao Si asked. \u201cTransport us again.\u201d A shower when they got back would be good, she really couldn\u2019t stand this body-full of mucus.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh, didn\u2019t I tell you?\u201d The bloodling was alarmed. He took out the box, which he had previously showed her, and chucked it away randomly. \u201cParticle transmitters are single use.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p><em>Hell!</em></p><br/><p>Yao Si took a deep breath, she really wanted to have a cow <sup>1</sup> now.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what should we do?\u201d They didn\u2019t know their own location and they couldn\u2019t get in contact with anyone.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems we can only wait on the spot! Or\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOr what?\u201d Maybe he has an idea?</p><br/><p>\u201cAccording to the designated distance of the particle transmitter, the transported distance wouldn\u2019t exceed two hundred thousand kilometers. So we could try to\u2026\u201d He paused, then said each word out with a rare seriousness, \u201cWalking. Back!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Goodbye!\u201d Yao Si turned and left. If she ever believed in this lunatic again, then she was an idiot, two hundred thousand kilometers! That was enough to freaking travel through half of the Earth, all right?</p><br/><p>\u201cEh, ancestor where are you\u2026 Ancestor, your highness!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si honestly hadn\u2019t thought that there would be such an odd man among the bloodlings. Other people would only cheat their father, yet he would deceive his ancestor. What was even worse was that once he got stuck onto you, you couldn\u2019t get rid of him, being unlucky to this level was quite impressive.</p><br/><p>However, soon Yao Si realized what it really meant to dig a hole for your ancestor to fall in. It was hard to say if Qu Ze had his luck set to negative when he was born, but he was either eaten by a flower, grabbed by a tree, or captured by an unknown bird all the time.</p><br/><p>Anyhow, it was like all the unfortunate things were waiting in line for him to patronize. Yao Si spent all her time not walking out of this forest but just saving another person.</p><br/><p>Result?</p><br/><p>Qu Ze had not a scratch on him, whereas Yao Si got swallowed by a flower, whipped by a tree, and pecked at by a bird. She was tired to death from saving their two little lives.</p><br/><p>She had generated an unshakable doubt about her race\u2019s mental capabilities. Who would freaking keep these kind of dangerous flora and fauna on their own mother planet, allowing them to grow everywhere? What kind of imbecilic taste is that? Is there still time for her to make the request to be turned back into the blue planet person?</p><br/><p>\u201cAncestor, why are we hiding here.\u201d Qu Ze poked Yao Si who was lying on her belly under a bush.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan\u2019t you see the flowers ahead?\u201d She pulled him down with no hesitation and pointed forward.</p><br/><p>\u201cFlowers?\u201d Qu Ze followed her pointing finger and looked, his eyes suddenly brightening up. \u201cHuh, isn\u2019t that Gluttony? Why are there so many?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow should I know?\u201d Yao Si rolled her eyes, even the name \u2018Gluttony\u2019 she had learned from him. Though unlike the single flower they saw before, there were dozens them here. At first glance, it looked like a white pond.</p><br/><p>Yao Si was in an difficult situation. It was clear that if they got across the field of the giant flowers, they would reach the end of this forest. However, if they did take such a path, they would definitely be swallowed a time or two. Or if being truthful, N number of times.</p><br/><p>\u201cI wonder what these flowers are gathering here for?\u201d</p><br/><p>She could clearly recall that Qu Ze had said they weren\u2019t gregarious. Taking a closer look, she realized that the flowers were gathering in a circle in an orderly manner. Compared to the motionless, waiting for prey to knock on it\u2019s door Gluttony they\u2019d met first, these were all slowly moving, as if passing something to the center before retreating, and in the center of them all\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cEh, it looks like there\u2019s a purple orb inside?\u201d</p><br/><p>It was only the size of a fist, and if its color didn\u2019t contrast so much to the flowers\u2019, Yao Si wouldn\u2019t have even noticed it.</p><br/><p>The two bloodlings could see that each flower moved to the spot of the orb, then lowered their flower buds and dripped something on the orb before backing away again. Right after, another flower would come up, doing the same. It was like some kind of a holy ritual.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey\u2019re probably feeding that orb.\u201d It could only be food that they spat out of the flower buds. \u201cJudging by the looks of it, that orb is either the king of the flowers or their young offspring. Let\u2019s take a detour, we must not touch\u2026 Huh, where did the he go?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wasn\u2019t Qu Ze standing right beside her a second ago?</p><br/><p>Yao Si\u2019s heart sank, and she instantly had an ominous feeling about it.</p><br/><p>Like she expected, the next moment she heard the person\u2019s confused yet excited voice. \u201cYour highness, is this the orb that you were talking about?\u201d</p><br/><p>Someone was standing in the middle of the sea of flowers, smiling brightly while holding the purple orb.</p><br/><p>Yao Si could feel the dull thud of her heart.</p><br/><p><em>Oh shoot!</em></p><br/><p>Suddenly, as if a light switch had been flicked on, each flower turned bloody red. The flower buds cracked open and uniformly turned to Qu Ze who had trespassed into their circle. Inside the Gluttony\u2019s something shone with a white shimmering light.</p><br/><p>\u201cRun!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si didn\u2019t know where that burst of energy came from, but she ran into the cluster of flowers, caught a particularly thick-headed person, dug her heels, and bolted madly away.</p><br/><p>The next moment, the sky was filled with ice, \u2018clack clack clack\u2019 firing at them like machine guns. Each blade of ice was as thick as a human arm, and when they were fired at a force that they even damaged the surrounding woods upon shattering on hit.</p><br/><p>Yao Si had an extremely tough time running, for she had to dodge the ice blades while also avoiding being smashed by the falling trees as well. What was even more critical was that in her hand she was still holding an idiot. If it weren\u2019t for the experience she\u2019d gained over the last few days from being tricked by Qu Ze, there would have been no way she could\u2019ve ducked so skillfully.</p><br/><p>For a heartbeat, she had the illusion that she had been transported into the game of Plants vs. Zombies, behind them were the field of plants and they were the zombies.</p><br/><p>In a moment like this, she only wanted to scream a sentence: \u201cQu Ze, I want to eat your brain!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hell, this fool\u2019s brain was clearly not for thinking, it was probably for water storage!</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>Yao Si dashed feverishly for half an hour until finally leaving the range of the flower attacks. Rolling her eyes at a certain culprit for her misery, she rested her hands on her knees for support. She didn\u2019t even have the energy to curse at him. Luckily those flowers were slow moving, otherwise they would have been stabbed until they looked like sieves.</p><br/><p>\u201cWow wow wow, I would have never guessed that those flowers other than eating people can also attack like that. So scary!\u201d Qu Ze\u2019s mouth pronounced words of fright, yet his expression was filled with enthusiasm. It was probably because he\u2019d gotten used to digging holes for her over the past few days, so there was no shame of having done anything wrong on his face.</p><br/><p>\u201cScary and you go and bother them! Are you insa\u2026\u201d Wait, she\u2019d already decided he\u2019s insane.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour highness\u2026\u201d He looked sideways at her as if he had suffered from an injustice. \u201cI thought that your highness liked it, that\u2019s why I wanted to get the orb and show it to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho would like such a thing!\u201d It was obvious that it was him looking for trouble without saying a single word!</p><br/><p>\u201cReally\u2026 Don\u2019t like it?\u201d His eyes softened, and injured expressions took shape on his face.</p><br/><p>This again. Every time he did something wrong he would have this \u2018little poor puppy\u2019 look, making her boiling anger stop at her throat, and she wouldn\u2019t be able to stay anymore. It was fine once or twice, but when he did it every single time, she grew immune to it.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t. Like. It!\u201d Her words were resolute and decisive.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh\u2026 I think this orb is quite pretty.\u201d He flew the purple orb up and caught it again \u201cBut if your highness doesn\u2019t like it, then never mind.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy do you even still have it?\u201d Yao Si\u2019s heart tightened, how carefree was this person\u2019s heart? If they still had it in their possession and those flowers caught up, what would happen then? \u201cThrow it away, quickly!\u201d She moved directly towards him, planning to grab and throw the orb away.</p><br/><p>However, Qu Ze\u2019s hand suddenly pulled back, ducking away. Maybe because he didn\u2019t have a firm foothold, he took a step back and a cube fell from his body. Yao Si could faintly hear the long tone of \u2018beeeep\u2019.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis fell from\u2026\u201d She instinctively bent and picked the cube up.</p><br/><p>Qu Ze\u2019s expression changed, and he suddenly yelled out, \u201cDon\u2019t touch it!\u201d</p><br/><p>But she had already picked it up. Immediately a line of black letters projected from the cube and took form of words in her eyes.</p><br/><p>\u2013Stimulation setting shutdown!</p><br/><p><em>What?</em></p><br/><p>\u201cHumph, I\u2019d have never thought that you would find out so soon!\u201d said a familiar yet much colder than usual voice.</p>\n</div>"}

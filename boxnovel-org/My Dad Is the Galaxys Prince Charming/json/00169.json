Turning to a certain nanny dad, she asked stiffly, \u201cWould you believe it if\u2026 I told you he wasn\u2019t referring to me?</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Mu Xuan.</p><br/><p>\u201cAhem, who could that possibly be? Go straight to the point.\u201d Yao Si coughed, diverting the topic of the conversation. \u201cWhy exactly did you harvest the king beast? When you said you wanted to go back, what did you mean by that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Long pouted as he slumped back lifelessly. Without hiding anything, he began to explain in a low voice. \u201cWhere else could I go back to? My home! Back to my universe. Since I can\u2019t find my contractor here, doesn\u2019t it mean that she\u2019s elsewhere?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnother universe!\u201d Even though Yao Si had held her suspicions, she hadn\u2019t expected him to really be from another world.</p><br/><p>\u201cHeh! You\u2019re speaking as though it wasn\u2019t where you came from.\u201d He rolled his eyes. \u201cI understand if you refuse to return since you found your contractor, but why the f*ck are you stopping me? Didn\u2019t I just borrow your contractor for a while? Did she loose a strand of hair or some fur? Was there a need to take revenge against me? Are you trying to kill us single dogs?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Yao Si\u2019s face was full of confusion. \u201cWhat do you mean by Mu Xuan refusing to return?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t all the bloodlings that have found their contractor have no intention of going back?\u201d His voice increased in volume, but when he turned around, he was startled by confusion written all over both their faces. \u201cWait a minute! Don\u2019t you guys know that the real bloodlings originate from another universe? Aren\u2019t you a pure breed?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI was originally a fourth generation bloodling,\u201d Mu Xuan replied truthfully when he sensed that something was wrong.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an earthling!\u201d Lin Long jumped, staring at Mu Xuan in disbelief. \u201cHow can that be? Your aura\u2026 is clearly that of a pure bloodling! How could you be an earthling converted by the old man, and a f*cking fourth generation at that! Where did your perverted abilities come from?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI awakened the ancestral bloodline.\u201d Mu Xuan frowned, pulling Yao Si behind him subconsciously. He had to cherish the young cub and avoid doing anything stupid!</p><br/><p>\u201cNonsense! What f*cking ancestral bloodline!\u201d Lin Long exclaimed in agitation and began pacing about in the room. \u201cDid I not know your ancestor? That old man was a complete weakling that was constantly wreaking havoc for me to clean up! You\u2019re trying to tell me you used his ability to win against me? That\u2019s nonsense!\u201d The memory of the one sided beating from three days ago brought an ache to his bones. \u201cHow can you not be a pure breed?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat does pure breed mean?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou really aren\u2019t?\u201d Lin Long was clearly in shock, disbelief clouding his vision. Sucking in a deep breath, he started to explain everything in detail.</p><br/><p>There were countless universes present at one time, and the universe he came from only had one race\u2014bloodlings. The pure breeds weren\u2019t like the various races in the Galaxy who needed reproduction or an inheritance. They were produced naturally by their universe.</p><br/><p>They were similar to the present day bloodlings in terms of their immortality, but they didn\u2019t possess single or double abilities like the average bloodlings. Instead, they were all full series bloodlings just like Lin Long. Simply put, that universe had an entire nest of ancestors.</p><br/><p>Yao Si felt as though she had become a cabbage.</p><br/><p>-_-|||</p><br/><p>The only difference between the two types of bloodlings was that the ones on another universe didn\u2019t possess bloodline suppression among themselves. Even though there were still differences between each individual\u2019s ability, self-healing was possible. In theory, they embodied the true meaning of an immortal being.</p><br/><p>Similar to the bunch on the Red Planet who wrecked their brains trying to convert a cub for themselves, their people spent their entire lives trying to find their one true contractor. But they were hit a lot worse since they had no idea where their contractor could be or who they were. They could be of any race, and the only way to find them was to locate them.</p><br/><p>It was purely coincidental! If one managed to bump into their contractor, they\u2019d lose their single status, but if not, they\u2019d continue to bark by themselves.</p><br/><p>Due to their long lifespan, the technology in their universe had reached an unbelievable state. It was thus commonplace for bloodlings to travel through the different universes to look for their contractors. Lin Long and Wang Erma were like that, but even so, the chances of finding their contractors were akin to locating a needle in a haystack. There was only the tiniest chance of succeeding.</p><br/><p>That explained the common consensus within the race to treat contractors that had appeared with unbelievable tolerance and to spare no effort in their protection. It was regardless of how the contractor treated them!</p><br/><p>It also explained why even though Lin Long had insulted Yao Si since the beginning, he had still went through with her requests.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy must you find your contractor?\u201d she asked. The bloodlings on the Red Planet did it due to the bloodline connection they would gain, but it probably didn\u2019t exist for the contractors, right? There had to be a reason why they held the contractors in such high regard.</p><br/><p>Lin Long paused, then glanced over at her with a surprisingly solemn expression. She could even catch a glimpse of something sacred there. \u201cBecause the contractors\u2026 are the only ones in the world that can grant us death.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p><em>What?</em></p><br/><p>(\u2299_\u2299)</p><br/><p>\u201cOnly with the contractor\u2019s approval can we conclude the blood contract.\u201d He raised his fingers toward the marking on her forehead. \u201cThere isn\u2019t an end to our lives, but those that have concluded the blood contract can pass on with their contractors, entering an eternal rest. That is the highest form of honor for our people.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d <em>What\u2019s with that ridiculous stipulation? Doesn\u2019t it mean you spare no effort in search for a contractor ultimately because you\u2019re seeking death?!</em></p><br/><p><em>Aren\u2019t you guys too big-hearted? And you call yourselves real bloodlings? You should be renamed to people that have grown frustrated with their long life! </em></p><br/><p>There was still a glazed look in Lin Long\u2019s eyes. \u201cThe contractor is the one true partner in our lives. They are a person that cannot be replaced.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p><em>Wait a minute! Mu Xuan, why are you nodding? Don\u2019t be influenced by this maniac! </em></p><br/><p>\u03a3(\u00b0\u25b3\u00b0|||)\ufe34</p><br/><p>Lin Long sighed, sinking back into his lifeless state. He then glared at Mu Xuan, his gaze full of hatred.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen I first saw him, I thought he had sealed his memory due to boredom and so had the misconception that he\u2019s a bastard. After all, it\u2019s quite a common practice. I was waiting for him to recover so that I could tap into his ability to open up a portal back. But after I realized that you were actually his contractor, I continued with my research on the king beast, hoping its space ability could be used to open up a universe portal.\u201d</p><br/><p>The anger within him thickened as he explained everything. \u201cAs a fellow pure breed, I could forget about how you didn\u2019t help, but how could you kill my king beast? Do you think it was easy for me to rear that pet? Who gave you the right to kill it!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you sure\u2026 that\u2019s the correct way for rearing pets?\u201d <em>Weren\u2019t you rearing pets as big as a planet? </em></p><br/><p>\u201cWhat was wrong with it?\u201d he as in a rage. \u201cAll I did was dig a bit in a few planets to build the breeding farms! After they started to form, I didn\u2019t let them roam around the planet but rather sent them over here to the uninhabited abyss to grow.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut you dug\u2026 other race\u2019s mother planets.\u201d <em>It isn\u2019t right to rear your pet on someone else\u2019s planet, right? </em></p><br/><p>\u201cBullshit!\u201d he exploded. \u201cThose breeding farms have been around for a few million years, and those races weren\u2019t even around at the time they were built. How can you blame me when they decide to plant themselves over my farms?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d <em>F*ck, those breeding farm have been around for such a long time? He\u2019s the real indigenous race! </em></p><br/><p>\u201cThose lowly races killed off two or three of my galactic beasts that decided to go for a stroll, but I endured it since I was breeding a ton of them. But you f*cking killed my king beast this time, and what for? Who did I offend? Why are you bullying a single dog?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>So the yearly trips for galactic beasts happened when he let his pets out for a stroll? Why was the truth so absurd?</p><br/><p>Yao Si had the sudden urge to go forth and soothe Lin Long\u2019s ruffled dog hair.</p><br/><p>\u25cb|\uffe3|_</p><br/><p>\u201cHeh! If the old man didn\u2019t get into trouble, we would have opened a portal to another universe together and I might have already found my contractor. This is all your fault!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOld man?\u201d Yao Si was suddenly reminded of the ancestor with the odd name. \u201cOh right, aren\u2019t you guys immortal? How did the ancestor\u2026 die?\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

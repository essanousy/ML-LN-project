He nodded as he stroked her hair. \u201cI remember.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen who exactly am\u2026\u201d She had always been curious.</p><br/><p>\u201cYaoyao.\u201d His expression became a little darker. \u201cBefore you became a bloodling, your blood type was AB RH negative, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, the legendary panda blood.\u201d She nodded. \u201d Because of my rare blood type, I\u2019ve always been cautious, worrying about my safety since there might not be enough supply if I were to meet with an accident.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMmh.\u201d His gaze grew brighter, and his whole being seemed to radiate a joyful aura. \u201cMe too!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou too? What do you mean?\u201d Yao Si exclaimed. \u201cYou mean\u2026 you have the same blood type?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou could say that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut how does that relate to the conversion? I haven\u2019t seen you before, and I\u2019ve certainly have never been bitten by you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYaoyao, think about it carefully.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI really haven\u2019t, I thought about it multiple times before. Anyways\u2026 why are you calling me Yaoyao? Before you, the only person who addressed me this way was\u2026\u201d She stopped mid-sentence as a thought struck her. Her eyes went wide in disbelief as she looked him up and down. \u201cYou-you are the hateful person from the hospital!\u201d</p><br/><p>His smile froze, but he still managed to nod.</p><br/><p><em>F*ck!</em></p><br/><p>The most hated person in her life was the person who stole her first kiss when she visited the hospital during high school.</p><br/><p>Those with her blood type would always leave their contact details in the hospital in case their blood was required during an accident. She remembered that year as her third year in high school; it was the first time she received a call from the hospital seeking help\u2014a gravely ill patient required a blood transfusion. Without a moment\u2019s hesitation, she had rushed over with a worried heart.</p><br/><p>The boy was a bag of bones as he lay on the hospital bed with multiple wires connected to him, leaving him almost unrecognizable. According to the doctor, he had been sent to the hospital by a kind soul and was almost at his last breath. He was probably an orphan since they couldn\u2019t seem to get in contact with any family members.</p><br/><p>As an orphan herself, Yao Si could relate to his plight. Without another word, she pushed back her sleeve and declared coolly that they should take it! As much as was needed!</p><br/><p>Because of that, she had stayed at the hospital for a day. The boy woke up during lunch time, but perhaps due to his illness, he had difficulty speaking and was only able to force out the word \u2018Yaoyao\u2019. Despite that, his eyes were unusually bright as he stared at her.</p><br/><p>Yao Si associated his actions to feeling unsafe in his new environment. In order to ensure he maintained a positive state to recover quickly, she then skipped her lessons to accompany and chat with him. Initially, everything was alright as she rambled on while he listened attentively. But the moment she was prepared to return to school, the boy who was supposedly on his last breath pounced on her with sudden strength. Before she could react, he had already bit her lip.</p><br/><p>If she were to be objective, that couldn\u2019t be considered a kiss as both of them were left with blood smearing their mouths and the coppery stench clouding their senses. Yao Si couldn\u2019t even distinguish whose blood it was at that time. She didn\u2019t know about his condition, but her lips hurt so badly she wanted to curse. The doctor who came in afterwards wasn\u2019t convinced it was him who had attacked her, and his disapproving gaze annoyed her to this day.</p><br/><p>Since then, the hospital had never contacted her for blood again.</p><br/><p>Instead ,she was left with a wound that left her lips swollen for two whole weeks. Coincidentally, all of this happened at the period she was most sensitive about love; as a young girl, she had fantasies about her relationship which made losing her first kiss in such a fashion extremely distressing. That boy was definitely a dark portion of her past!</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry!\u201d Mu Xuan caressed her head tenderly. \u201cI didn\u2019t know you hated me back then.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt would be odd if I didn\u2019t hate you after you attacked me.\u201d Besides, at the time, he looked nothing like he did right now. If he had his current looks, she probably wouldn\u2019t have reacted the same way since looks triumphed justice after all!</p><br/><p>\u256e(\u256f\u25bd\u2570)\u256d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not right!\u201d She suddenly remembered something. \u201cI remember reading a news report about the boy\u2019s death.\u201d Since the hospital couldn\u2019t contact his family members, they had sought media assistance. There was a report after he passed away, and it was only after it that she gradually forget about their dark history.</p><br/><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t fully awakened at that time,\u201d Mu Xuan explained. \u201cI was forcefully awakened in the mid of my hibernation, but I managed to see you\u2026\u201d He tightened his grip around her waist. \u201cThe moment I laid my eyes on you, I knew you were the one I\u2019ve been waiting throughout all the years.</p><br/><p>\u201cI was weak and could fall back into hibernation at any moment, so I was worried. When you were about to leave, I had a feeling I would never meet you again once I woke up so\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p><em>So you decided to just convert me? Isn\u2019t that a little too absurd?</em></p><br/><p>\u201cI fell back into hibernation after that.\u201d It was then that the hospital confirmed his death. \u201cI only fully awakened during the last phase of Earth\u2019s time, but by then, I had forgotten about everything before.\u201d</p><br/><p>That explained why he wasn\u2019t aware of her existence earlier.</p><br/><p>\u201cYaoyao.\u201d He lowered his head to press his forehead against hers as he stared straight into her eyes. With a seriousness he had never showed before, he said, \u201cEven though I\u2019m sorry for causing you harm at that time, choosing to convert you was the best decision in my life.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si\u2019s heart shook. The incident had happened such a long time ago that she no longer harbored the old fury. Instead, warmth spread from the bottom of her heart when she realized that they had known each other since so many years ago.</p><br/><p>With a chuckle she couldn\u2019t suppress, she reached over to return his embrace. \u201cIt\u2019s my honor!\u201d</p><br/><p>If he hadn\u2019t converted her back then, she probably wouldn\u2019t have lived to this day or even till he awakened. This meant that good deeds would be repaid in ways such as\u2026 leaving singlehood!</p><br/><p>\u201cOh right, does that mean you are really a pure breed from Lin Long\u2019s universe?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Long had mentioned that they would often seal their memory before going into hibernation in order to live a brand new life. Was that the reason Mu Xuan couldn\u2019t remember the past after he awakened? Was that also why a fake bloodling like her could hibernate for such a long time?</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Mu Xuan didn\u2019t nod as she predicted; instead, he had a blank look and a frown. \u201cMy memory\u2026 is a mess!\u201d</p><br/><p>He knew that he had lived for an extremely long time, from when the the world had just began, but those memories didn\u2019t have much color as they flowed through his mind like a stream. They didn\u2019t seem real, since everything only started to come to life from the moment he met Yao Si.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy memory isn\u2019t complete so I can\u2019t confirm if I really am from the other universe, but I\u2019m definitely not an earthling, and you\u2026 are my only contractor.\u201d</p><br/><p><em>Enough, that\u2019s all I need! </em>Yao Si buried herself in the familiar embrace of the man who loved to caress her hair all the time. She didn\u2019t care about where he was from, just that he was really hers.</p><br/><p>\u201cYaoyao\u2026\u201d There was a slight tremble in Mu Xuan\u2019s deep voice; he seemed to have been suppressing himself for a while. He tightened his hands around her, then lowered his head to press his lips against hers. The kiss deepened gradually as his hands roamed around her body.</p><br/><p>Yao Si felt herself drowning in the tenderness. Her mind went blank as his heavy breathing clouded her senses.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan I?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCan you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Her mind was blank, and her reply had been purely out of instinct. The next second, she felt the world rotate, and their positions swapped\u2014Mu Xuan\u2019s imposing figure was now pressing down on hers.</p><br/><p>He landed lingering, feather-like kisses on her without any restraint from before, his actions now resembling a violent flood. The heavy pants served as an encouragement, motivating his thirst\u2026</p><br/><p>Thud! The door flew open.</p><br/><p>\u201cBeloved dad, the grand prince is awake\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Mu Xuan.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Yao Si.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Li Zheng.</p><br/><p>After half a minute\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t see anything, you guys go on, continue\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Without another word, he turned and bolted out the door as though he were in a one hundred meter race.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Was it too late to break off all ties?</p></div>\n</div>"}

Even after stuttering for a long while, he still wasn\u2019t able to articulate clearly.</p><br/><p>Yao Si sighed. \u201cJust call me Yao Si!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d He straightened, agreeing instantly as though he had received a command.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you the person Yao Qian mentioned?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He took a deep breath, trying to calm his nerves before replying. \u201cI-I\u2019m a bloodling from\u2026 the 720 generation\u2026 I\u2019m called\u2026 Gu-gu-gu Shucheng. Elder Yao personally instructed me to ensure that you are escorted to-to the academy safely.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHello.\u201d Yao Si reached out her hand instinctively. \u201cNice to meet you.\u201d</p><br/><p>The boy stilled, his eyes going wide. As though he had received a heavenly gift, he suddenly took hold of her hand and went down on one knee. He leaned forward to tap her nails with his forehead, which was a special greeting by the bloodlings. In a respectful manner, he responded, \u201cIt\u2019s my honor, Your Highness.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si brought back her hand. She was already used to the anxiety bloodlings felt when they met her.</p><br/><p>\u201cSend me to the academy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d Gu Shucheng stood up, directing her towards the school gate.</p><br/><p>Since this place was The First Academy, there was a huge crowd in front of the its gate even though it was already the third day of reporting. The students formed groups of either threes or fives, although there were also some that were there by themselves just as Yao Si. There were students of every race here, and there even more different races here than she had seen in Eternal Brilliance.</p><br/><p>After they passed through the gates, a person waved at them from afar.</p><br/><p>\u201cSis, Sis!\u201d Huo Qi panted heavily as he ran over. \u201cYou\u2019re finally here, I waited almost the entire day.\u201d</p><br/><p>He had rushed over anxiously, so Gu Shucheng took a step in front of Yao Si protectively, worried that he might hit her.</p><br/><p>Three months earlier, she had told Huo Qi that she was going to apply for the First Academy, but she never expected him to be waiting for her.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe is?\u201d Huo Qi glanced at Gu Shucheng curiously. \u201cSis, you have a date?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you saying?!\u201d Yao Si\u2019s lips twitched, and she pondered for a while before providing a suitable response. \u201cHe\u2019s\u2026 a child\u2026 from an uncle\u2019s house.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gu Shucheng was indeed the youngest cub with Yao Qian\u2019s ability.</p><br/><p>\u201cUncle\u2019s house? Your nephew?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEr\u2026\u201d How did his thoughts run? She was now an aunt?</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, a distant relative.\u201d Huo Qi quickly moved on, continuing on animatedly, \u201cI never expected you to really make it! It\u2019s fate, indeed, Yao\u2026Yao\u2026 Mmh, what\u2019s after Yao?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYao Si.\u201d Even though she was aware that his impression of her was blurred because of Mu Xuan\u2019s mental strength, they had been online friends for a few months. How could he forget her name?</p><br/><p>\u201cYao\u2026 Yao.. Little Sis Yao!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Y <em>ou better remember it!</em></p><br/><p>\u201cOh right, I\u2019m currently in class C of high school here,\u201d he added enthusiastically. \u201cI\u2019ve been here for two days and have already familiarized myself with the entire place. Which level are you at? The middle or high school? And which class did you get into?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si\u2019s mouth twitched once more, and she weakly pointed to a building on the extreme left. \u201cThat one\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Huo Qi turned, his eyes widening instantly.</p><br/><p>\u201cElementary school!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHehehe\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you try for the middle school?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d <em>Get lost! If I could enter it, would there be a need for me to join the elementary school! </em>His words reminded her of the horrifying scores on her entrance exam.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut\u2026 elementary school is\u2026 good too.\u201d Huo Qi smiled stiffly. Just then, he tapped her shoulders as though he had remembered something. \u201cWith your ability, it would be good to build a solid foundation. Which series and class are you in? I\u2019ll have your back from now on!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBiological series, third level of Class D.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBiological series!\u201d</p><br/><p>A concerned expression appeared on Huo Qi\u2019s face. People with abilities were natural warriors, and the series they were sent to would aid in teaching them how to better their abilities. The biological series was actually a class that taught other knowledge to races that didn\u2019t have abilities. For instance, their subjects included machinery, space, finance, etc. For someone with an ability, entering the biological series was basically incomprehensible.</p><br/><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you from the water series? Why are you in the biological series?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEr\u2026 I wanted to learn other stuff.\u201d She actually wanted to gain some common knowledge here.</p><br/><p>Huo Qi was incredulous. He took a deep breath. \u201cAll right, if you have any problems, remember to look for me, okay? Since we both fought the same galactic beast, you shouldn\u2019t feel shy. I\u2019ll\u2026 charge you a bit less than others.\u201d</p><br/><p><em>You were expecting to charge me! You miser!</em></p><br/><p>\u201cOh right, do you need me to direct you to the reporting area?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine!\u201d Yao Si was worried she couldn\u2019t afford his services. She pointed to Gu Shucheng by her side. \u201cMy nephew will bring me there.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, all right\u2026\u201d Huo Qi murmured with regret, upset to have lost his money making opportunity. \u201cGo on then, I\u2019ll leave now, see you at the ceremony later.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si nodded. After sending off that money-minded person, she followed her nephew Gu over to the reporting area.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t like the reporting area in the Blue Planet. There weren\u2019t any teachers around, just a simple detection door that she could walk through. After walking through it, the reporting would be complete. There would also be a friendly announcement. Her was \u201cStudent Yao Si, welcome to Galactic Academy\u2019s elementary school!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Highness, here\u2019s your Student ID.\u201d Nephew Gu passed her a transparent card. \u201cYou\u2019ll need it when you enter the school and during the exams.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, thank you.\u201d She reached for it, taking a quick glance at it. Her name was imprinted on the card with a photo of her beside. Below was a bunch of numbers which were probably her student number.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Highness, you can add it to your optical computer.\u201d Nephew Gu pointed to the bottom left of the card which had an optical computer symbol.</p><br/><p>Yao Si nodded, and the tiny card disappeared. Her optical computer beeped, acknowledging the action. This was indeed quite convenient.</p><br/><p>Before she could take a closer look around, though, Nephew Gu hurriedly pushed a bunch of things over, and all she heard next was continuous beeping from her optical computer.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Highness, these are the notes that you need for school.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Highness, here\u2019s your textbook.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Highness, here are the notes that I prepared for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Highness, I studied the books for elementary school at least ten times, here are my thoughts.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Highness, these are the important analysis for the first six lessons.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Highness, these are the 108 basics on machinery.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Highness, here are the histories of the main races in the Galaxy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Highness\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>-_-|||</p><br/><p><em>This is just my first day\u2026 How much time did you spend on this? How much work did Yao Qian give you?</em></p><br/><p>\u201cYour Highness, one more thing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s more?\u201d <em>My optical computer is about to explode!</em></p><br/><p>\u201cElder Yao emphasized that this is the most important point.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease be punctual for your meals at home.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p><em>Enough!</em></p><br/><p>She gritted her teeth. Once everything was stored in her optical computer, a clear sounding announcement came from the skies of the academy,</p><br/><p>[All students, please proceed to the Teacher Appreciation Hall to participate in the Galactic Academy\u2019s 9518th Opening Ceremony and election assembly.]</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p>\n</div>"}

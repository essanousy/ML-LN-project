There was no way that Yao Si could reject her either as any harshness was met with an ever-ready torment of tears.</p><br/><p>\u201cSister Lian Yu, listen to me, my ability is\u2026 a little unique.\u201d Yao Si inhaled deeply, preparing to expose everything, letting her know that her current infatuation was only due to her ability.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou mean you have the ability to let someone fall for you at first sight?\u201d Lian Yu stilled.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d She nodded vigorously. \u201cYour attraction is only due to the influence of my ability. It will disappear after a while and you won\u2019t be feeling this way anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>The queen frowned, trying to process her words. \u201cThen\u2026 the two guys that were following you around, were they also affected by your ability?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot really! Lu Chen is my employee, and Mu\u2014 Mo Xuan.\u201d Yao Si corrected herself instantly, before his real name slipped out. \u201cHe\u2019s my guider so he isn\u2019t with me because of my ability.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhich means\u2026 you only directed your ability at me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMmh, mmh, mmh.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>The queen\u2019s eyes brightened as she reached forward to grab onto Yao Si\u2019s hands. \u201cAs expected, Sisi, you are interested in me after all, even to the point of using your ability on me\u2026 That\u2019s great, since we feel the same way, shall we register our marriage?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p><em>What logic is that? How did that become your main point?</em></p><br/><p><em>Eh, this is getting increasingly difficult.</em></p><br/><p>\u201cForget it, we can talk about it next time.\u201d Yao Si massaged her temples. \u201cEr\u2026 Can you explain the fog out there?\u201d The fog that had clouded the entire planet didn\u2019t look normal at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat.. It comes from\u2026\u201d The queen went still, twiddling her fingers as guilt inched onto her face. \u201cI made the heavenly tree open the limitation for the Rainbow Pond so\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRainbow Pond\u2019s limitation?\u201d What did that mean?</p><br/><p>\u201cThis planet is called Heavenly Planet because of the Rainbow Pond.\u201d The queen hesitated slightly before explaining everything in great detail.</p><br/><p>Basically, Heavenly Planet wasn\u2019t originally like it was now. It was a planet engulfed in fog from from the Rainbow Pond, which made it seem mystical and brought about its name. Rainbow Pond originated from the planet\u2019s core, its water possessing a rare chemical that could unleash one\u2019s potential in terms of an ability\u2019s mental strength.</p><br/><p>It was a natural stimulant, which explained its popularity. However, if one were to stay too long in the fog, they would be trapped in their own world. The only ones who could defend against the fog were heavenly sylvian which came from the trees. They were able to restrict the fog to a certain region, preventing it from spreading, which led to the success of the Heavenly Planet.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo\u2026 you mean to say\u2026 Mu\u2014 Mo Xuan and the others are stuck in the hallucination caused by the fog?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMmh.\u201d The queen raised her head with a hint of anger. \u201cIt was to find you Sisi\u2026 He was at fault for bringing you away, and even destroying my flower of the heavenly tree. If I hadn\u2019t found the heart of the tree in time, you wouldn\u2019t have been able to see me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d So it\u2019s his fault? \u201cWhen do you intend to release them?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to!\u201d The queen cocked her head to the side, throwing a childlike tantrum. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t easy for me to keep those bastards out. If he were released, he would definitely snatch you away! Isn\u2019t it recorded in history books that all female side characters are there to snatch the male lead? I won\u2019t ever make that mistake!\u201d</p><br/><p><em>Who ever told you to learn from those novels\u2026 Besides, how is Mu Xuan a woman?</em></p><br/><p>\u25cb|\uffe3|_</p><br/><p>\u201cForget it, I\u2019ll save them myself.\u201d Yao Si turned to leave the room .</p><br/><p>\u201cSisi!\u201d Lian Yu stilled slightly before reaching out haphazardly to take hold of her. \u201cYou-you like that bastard so much? In what way am I not good enough? Why are you going to him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLian Yu\u2026\u201d Yao Si took a deep breath. \u201cI apologize for destroying your aircraft, but that was only because you prevented us from leaving. Mu\u2014 Mo Xuan is my guider, and if you investigated bloodlings, you should be aware what a guider means to a bloodling, right?</p><br/><p>\u201cI am honored to have gained your attention, but regardless of whether the love is due to my ability or your heart, I\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t like you. Not the least bit. But this has nothing to do with Mu\u2014 Mo Xuan. I would never leave him in a pinch, even if he didn\u2019t require my assistance.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lian Yu stilled, her gaze darkening gradually, her excitement dissipating as she looked stricken.</p><br/><p>Yao Si didn\u2019t have time, so she sighed once more before leaving the room. She had to get to Mu Xuan. Just as she left the room, Lian Yu started to sob.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t that way, it\u2019s here.\u201d She suddenly lifted her finger toward the other side of the pond with a pout, \u201cThe Rainbow Pond has hallucination inducing effects. Even if he really is inside, you won\u2019t be able to see him unless you reactivate the restrictions. If you really insist on going, I-I can bring you there.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Thank you.\u201d Yao Si heaved a sigh of relief while heading out.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet me make this clear,\u201d the queen added. \u201cI\u2019m only doing this because of you Sisi. That bastard ruined my flower of the heavenly tree, and you should know its importance to me. I\u2019m not going to let him off easily, but-but if you were to get angry and hate me because of that, wouldn\u2019t it make it too easy for him? I will never let myself down like that!\u201d</p><br/><p>Was she trying to forcefully save her pride?</p><br/><p>Yao Si sighed once more, the anger for being separated from Mu Xuan gradually fading away. \u201cYes, yes, yes! Dear queen, you are wise.\u201d <em>I shall reward you with compliments. </em></p><br/><p>\u201cObviously!\u201d The aves lifted her head arrogantly, her eyes brightening. \u201cDoes that mean you are starting to fall for me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Alright!\u201d She fumed, turning to walk ahead. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust one thing\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHave you changed your mind about marrying me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Yao Si\u2019s lips twitched, and she pointed to the woman\u2019s lower half. \u201cThat\u2026 could you first put something on?\u201d <em>Your towel fell off a long time ago\u2026 Didn\u2019t you feel airy? </em></p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>A second later.</p><br/><p>\u201cAhh!\u201d</p><br/><p>A shrill cry pierced the air\u2026</p><br/><p>Yao Si suddenly had an impulse to pray for Lian Yu.</p><br/><p>(\u02c7?\u02c7)</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>Lian Yu had mentioned that the restriction was in the centre of the house. She bypassed it and headed toward a silver pathway through the surroundings which seemed to have become much foggier than before.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s right in front.\u201d Lian Yu pointed ahead as she explained, \u201cOnly the heavenly sylvians are able to enter there.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si stopped, discovering a transparent light wall that kept her out. She wouldn\u2019t have noticed it unless she inspected the place closely.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait for me here, I\u2019ll be back after I turn the switch on.\u201d Lian Yu took two steps before turning back worriedly. \u201cYou must wait over here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Only after repeated reassurances did Lian Yu leave. Right away, her figure disappeared into the fog.</p><br/><p>Yao Si had assumed that she needed some time, but less than two minutes later, a frantic shout sounded. Lian Yu who had just entered came flying out as though struck deeply.</p><br/><p>Yao Si reached out instinctively to catch her, but was struck by her weight and collapsed onto the ground.</p><br/><p><em>It hurts\u2026 I\u2019m going to be flattened\u2026</em></p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happen\u2014\u201d</p><br/><p>Just as she was about to ask, Lian Yu bolted upright, her face pale. \u201cThe heavenly tree\u2019s\u2026 heart is in trouble!\u201d</p><br/><p><em>What?</em></p><br/><p>Yao Si stilled as a distinct snap could be heard in the distance. Turning, she inhaled deeply at the sight.</p><br/><p><em>F*ck!</em></p><br/><p>(\u2299 o \u2299)</p><br/><p><em>Dear queen, what exactly did you just do? </em></p></div>\n</div>"}

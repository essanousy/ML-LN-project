Don\u2019t worry about it, when the time is up, you\u2019ll be back to normal.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Yao Si stilled, suppressing her inner shock.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re also a training customer of the celestials, right?\u201d the green ball asked.</p><br/><p>Yao Si nodded, remembering her ball status. She then swiftly asked, \u201cI\u2019m one, are you guys too?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d The green ball bounced. \u201cWe were here before you to get the gift!\u201d</p><br/><p>Gift? That word sounded like toothache to her now!</p><br/><p>\u201cIs the Soul Eating Flag really the gift they mentioned?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYea!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere are we now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cInside the Soul Eating Flag!\u201d The green ball replied somewhat arrogantly while bouncing about. \u201cWhen you first came in, didn\u2019t you realize that my awareness is much greater than that of others? It\u2019s best to train your mental strength here!\u201d</p><br/><p>She could indeed feel her awareness getting livelier, and the ability to exert it seemed much smoother as well, but\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about our bodies?\u201d With their awareness gone, weren\u2019t the empty shells of their bodies left outside?</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry about that.\u201d The green ball floated to the side, allowing a blue ball to take shape. \u201cCome come, blue ball, you\u2019re one of the celestials, you can explain it to this sister.\u201d</p><br/><p><em>Achem\u2026 </em> The blue ball first cleared his throat. \u201cSis, you don\u2019t have to worry, we celestials always ensure the best customer service. Inside the beginner guide, there is an automated protective function. Once your awareness leaves your body, the optical computer will provide a temporary storage space for your body,\u201d he explained in a service-like manner. After a moment, he added, \u201cOf course\u2026 the storage will be charged on an hourly basis, and it is linked to your bank account. If you would like to leave or if the account balance isn\u2019t enough, the awareness will automatically return to your body.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d <em>You\u2019re going to charge for this?!</em></p><br/><p>The level up gift suddenly seemed like another of their money making schemes.</p><br/><p>\u201cAll right, all right, there\u2019s officially four of us now, let\u2019s start!\u201d the white ball rushed them impatiently.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Yao Si was an image of confusion. \u201cWhat are we starting?\u201d</p><br/><p>The three balls took a corner each, with the green ball looking exceptionally excited. \u201cSis, since there is so much free time, why don\u2019t\u2026 we all play some mahjong? We were lacking one player!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d <em> Excuse me?</em></p><br/><p>\u201cSis, you have no idea how long we\u2019ve been waiting for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, yes, I\u2019ve been in this horrid place for seven days,\u201d the blue ball replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is seven days? I\u2019ve been waiting for a month!\u201d the white ball stated acidly. \u201cAfter an entire month, you\u2019re finally here.\u201d</p><br/><p>They cornered her so enthusiastically just to play mahjong? She face-palmed internally. <em>Can\u2019t you be more ambitious!</em></p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about the training?\u201d <em>Can you really be so lax?</em></p><br/><p>\u201cWhen the awareness leaves the body, you just have to get used to the feeling, there isn\u2019t much you can do in that state,\u201d the blue ball explained, his face mysterious. \u201cSis, you must not have heard of the game \u2018mahjong\u2019, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d <em>No, I know of it, and I\u2019m quite well-versed in it as well </em>!</p><br/><p>\u201cLet me tell you, in the past, this was the most popular form of entertainment on Earth. A friend of a friend of my friend went through great lengths just to catch a glimpse of it in the bloodling museum. He heard from the keeper there that mahjong had a few million years worth of history!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d What great sentiments for mahjong!</p><br/><p>\u201cShut your trap, you\u2019ve been flaunting it for the past half a moment. Hurry, let us take a look at it,\u201d the white ball ordered impatiently.</p><br/><p>\u201cAll right, take a good look!\u201d The fog separated, and the originally basketball-sized fog shrank into a small knuckle, then formed a weird arrangement of white-based blue\u2026 bamboos, dots and characters.</p><br/><p>-_-|||</p><br/><p>The blue ball started to introduce every tile, and as he did so, he elaborated on the rules of the game while he fog beneath him continuously morphed into the different tiles. \u201cLet\u2019s start with a trial run, I\u2019ll explain again when we meet with any difficulties. Mahjong can get a little complex, since there are one hundred forty-for tiles in total\u2026\u201dSuddenly, he stopped, cursing softly. \u201cF*ck, I don\u2019t have enough awareness, I can only form one hundred forty tiles. Hey! Green ball, help me form the others.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMe?\u201d The green ball stilled. \u201cHow can I form them if I\u2019ve never even seen them before?</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what do we do, we won\u2019t be able to play like that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need that many.\u201d Yao Si couldn\u2019t help interrupting. \u201cWe can play Chang Sha mahjong, it only needs one hundred and eight tiles.\u201d</p><br/><p>The three balls stilled, looking over at her in shock.</p><br/><p>\u201cSis, you know about this?\u201d The blue ball bounced over excitedly.</p><br/><p>\u201cEr\u2026 a little.\u201d She floated aside while explaining the rules of the game.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an expert, sis!\u201d The blue ball formed a thumbs up with his fog. \u201cLets play it that way then!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cErr\u2026\u201d <em>Wait a moment, why did I tell them all this? </em></p><br/><p>\u201cCome, come, let\u2019s open a table.\u201d</p><br/><p>They were really going to play? Could she reject the offer?</p><br/><p>Yao Si looked around, trying to change the topic, only to realize that they were in an endless space without any light. The entire space place was in darkness, and there wasn\u2019t any greenery or plants here, making it seem empty and hollow-like.</p><br/><p>However, they were surrounded by zombie-like gray balls of energy that were floating about aimlessly. Even though they looked similar to them, they didn\u2019t seem to be able to talk or move freely.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are those?\u201d she asked.</p><br/><p>The blue ball moved a bit, as though considering how to answer. After a moment, he replied in a low voice, \u201cOh, those are the other awareness that had been sucked in by the Soul Eating Flag.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe other awareness!\u201d Yao Si exclaimed. \u201cThen why\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Soul Devouring Flag can indeed be used to devours souls. If a soul is unable to withstand the force, it would be sucked in by the Flag , becoming gray and lifeless which is similar to death,\u201d he replied lightly. \u201cBut don\u2019t worry, these Soul Devouring Flags can only suck in the souls of those from the indigenous race in the Shadow Planet; it has no effect on celestials or other races. We won\u2019t be put under any form of danger.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si frowned, glancing at the countless number of gray balls around them. Her heart sank as she wondered how many souls the Soul Devouring Flag had taken.</p><br/><p>\u201cThese are all part of their experience.\u201d The blue ball seemed to have understood her thoughts, for he added. \u201cThe process of becoming a celestial is indeed cruel. Those who are capable will succeed, becoming celestials in the future, but those who aren\u2019t strong enough will end up as nourishment for the flag. It\u2019s not just the celestial lands that are like that, evolution is the same for every race.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si recalled the bloodling history that Mu Xuan had once told her. It was true that the progression of every race would definitely be accompanied by sacrifices, even the might bloodlings couldn\u2019t prevent the extinction of earthlings, which resulted in their reproduction difficulty today.</p><br/><p>\u201cFive bamboo!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPong!\u201d Yao Si took the tile, tossing her thoughts away as she focused her attention back onto the mahjong table. As a pure quintessence of national culture, how could she lose in mahjong, such a wide-ranging and profound art that was part of her culture\u2019s heritage.</p><br/><p>\u201cHu!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTouch!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHu!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTouch!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAll in one!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPong, pong, hu!\u201d</p><br/><p>The entire time, only her winning cheers could be heard.</p><br/><p>The three balls could only stare.</p><br/><p>\u201cSis, you real job is actually the study of the history of Earth, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, I studied a little!\u201d</p><br/><p>How could an ignorant alien compare with the quintessence of a culture such as herself? It would be an offence if she lost. Haha.</p><br/><p>Ah? Wait a moment!</p><br/><p>Wasn\u2019t she here to train her mental strength? Why did she actually end up playing mahjong with them? And she had played for more than an hour!</p><br/><p>When she regained her senses, the three balls were already soaked in defeat!</p><br/><p>\u25cb|\uffe3|_</p><br/><p>The quintessence of the national culture was indeed skillful\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cHu!\u201d</p><br/><p>The white ball pushed his tile downwards enthusiastically as he bounced on the spot, taking several turns. \u201cI win, I win, I finally win for the first time! When we leave, remember to send me Galactic currency, Galactic currency!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Was there a need to be so happy about just one win?</p><br/><p>\u201cWait a minute!\u201d Yao Si took a closer look at the tiles, pulling three of them out. \u201c356? This isn\u2019t a win! You\u2019ll have to pay the other three players for this false alarm.\u201d</p><br/><p>The white and green balls became gleeful at their friend\u2019s misfortune. \u201cHahaha! White ball, hurry and pay up.\u201d</p><br/><p>The white ball froze, his entire ball darkening, as though he had turned into a dark rainy cloud. After freezing for a moment, the entire space shook, and the originally dark space turned bright red.</p><br/><p>All of the balls turned red.</p><br/><p>\u201cLets go, let\u2019s go!\u201d The three balls threw the tiles away before flying at the sky excitedly.</p><br/><p>What are they doing?</p><br/><p>Yao Si stilled, following behind them. When she reached the top, she realized they had reached the area that was the brightest.</p><br/><p>\u201cWah, it\u2019s been three days, that silly kid is finally out of the cave.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI wonder who he will meet this time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSomeone seductive? Someone pure? Or someone cunning?\u201d</p><br/><p>The three balls started their heated discussion, while Yao Si looked at them in confusion. What did they mean?</p><br/><p>Before they could clarify the matter, a faint shadow appeared near the red glow. The shadow started to focus, turning clearer as though there was a layer that was unveiling. In a moment, a familiar\u2026 pig head appeared.</p><br/><p>Wasn\u2019t he the one who had attacked her in the cave, the one who had called himself the best demonic cultivator?</p><br/><p>They could actually see what was happening outside\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s here, he\u2019s here, how will the next person look like?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI liked the previous one with the big chest.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019d prefer the cold one from before her! The visuals were amazing, everything was just right!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI really envy that dumb kid out there. There\u2019s a new girl every few days, where else in the Galaxy can you find such treatment?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, right! He kills everyone he finds, such a heartless person. It really is a waste of such precious creatures.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you know, the skill he is learning requires him to gather the Yin energy to supplement Yang. If he didn\u2019t engage in such activity, how would he be able to advance! Ay, I should have gone the demonic path!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow long do you think it\u2019ll be this time, half an hour?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI guess twenty minutes, how can this silly guy go on for so long.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI guess ten minutes!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si stilled, vaguely sensing something perverted about to happen.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p><em>F*ck! </em> They had rushed over just to watch such things\u2026 <em>Where are your morals? Were they eaten by the mahjong tiles? </em> The group seemed to be very familiar with the process, so there must have been many opportunities during this past month for them to have enjoyed all sorts of performances!</p><br/><p>The man outside suddenly lit a candle, seemingly having no clue that he had a large audience. He must also have no idea that ever since he had obtained the Soul Devouring Flag, which was probably be a while ago, many customers must have come for training\u2026 which meant that he was probably famous across all the celestials\u2019 lands. Wait, no, probably the whole Galaxy!</p><br/><p>He lit the candle once more!</p><br/><p>Yao Si covered her face and began floating away as a ball of mist as though she hadn\u2019t heard anything.</p><br/><p><em>Mmh, my thoughts are still pure!</em></p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a demonic cultivator!\u201d An infuriated voice that seemed vaguely familiar sounded, and Yao Si turned her head violently to see familiar face!</p><br/><p><em>Zan Zichen! Why is it you?! </em></p><br/><p>This unlucky child, how many more misfortunes was he going to be met with?! How could he have bumped into this demonic cultivator?</p><br/><p>\u201cEh, why is it a male?\u201d The blue ball sighed in disappointment, and the three balls started to lament.</p><br/><p>\u201cHeh, after three days of wait, its actually a guy, I didn\u2019t know he swings both ways.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYea, return me my hot babe!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat a waste of my three days!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAy, let\u2019s leave, there isn\u2019t much to look at.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with a guy?\u201d Their criticism and displeasure seemed to have angered the protective Yao Si, for she even added, \u201cWho said a guy can\u2019t do it?</p><br/><p>All three balls turned around to stare at her.</p><br/><p><em>Err\u2026 Did I say something revolutionary just now?</em></p>\n</div>"}

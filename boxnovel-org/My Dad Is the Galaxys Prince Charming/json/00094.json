She contracted Senior Qin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe can even contract a cultivator?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDemon girl\u2026 No, she is from the demonic clan. It has to be them!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHurry, let\u2019s go! I don\u2019t want to become a contracted demonic beast, I don\u2019t want to!\u201d</p><br/><p>A series of squeals pierced the air. As the mental strength controlling them was gradually released, they hurriedly escaped on their flying swords without a second glance back. The area was cleared in a matter of seconds.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait a moment!\u201d Yao Si was full of confusion. \u201cWhat exactly is happening? Isn\u2019t someone going to explain it to me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior, don\u2019t you know?\u201d Zan Zichen stilled.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat don\u2019t I know?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat person\u2026\u201d\u2014he pointed to the weird guy as articulated each word carefully\u2014\u201dis now yours!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>What?</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>After Zan Zichen\u2019s explanation, Yao Si finally understood what about the contracts. It was a specialty on the planet of Shadows which consisted of all sorts of demonic beasts. They made useful ingredients for crafting medicine and weapons, and they spawned quickly so there was always a large amount of them.</p><br/><p>The indigenous tribes would often keep a few of the demonic beasts to use either as ingredients to make weapons or as support during a duel. However, most demonic beasts were hard to tame and would devour their owners at times. Hence, cultivators came up with a controlling method\u2014the owner and slave contract.</p><br/><p>When a demonic beast was in a weak state, the owner would send its consciousness into the demonic beast\u2019s mind to read its thoughts to prepare for the attack and to prevent the demonic beast from having any rebellious intentions.</p><br/><p>Moreover, contracted beasts were not able to disobey. The moment they thought of rebellion, the mark left during the contract would automatically destroy their consciousness.</p><br/><p>Yao Si\u2019s previous actions clearly matched the conditions above.</p><br/><p>\u201cOnce a contract has been established, the beast\u2019s life will be in its owner\u2019s hands,\u201d Zan Zichen concluded. \u201cSo\u2026 he is officially yours.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCould you\u2026 use other terms?\u201d <em>What do you mean by yours? That\u2019s such a misleading term! </em> \u201cIsn\u2019t it a contract between a demonic beast and a person? Both of us are humans!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn theory, the contract can only work on demonic beasts\u2026\u201d Zan Zichen was equally puzzled.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what happened to me?\u201d Yao Si was starting to develop a headache. Was it really not her mahjong tile on the weird guy\u2019s head?</p><br/><p>\u201cThis\u2026 I\u2019m not sure either.\u201d Zan Zichen shook his head. \u201cDemonic beasts and human cultivators are from completely different races. Cultivators have larger consciousness than beasts so cultivators are able to contract them during at their weakened state. Both of you are humans, I don\u2019t\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWait a moment!\u201d Yao Si\u2019s heart sank. Different race? They really weren\u2019t from the same race\u2026</p><br/><p>Was it because of the difference in their race? Was her luck that bad?!</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can kill me, but I won\u2019t let you humiliate me!\u201d The leader lifted his head, glaring at her with a murderous look, but somehow, he was rooted to the ground. \u201cI will never be your contracted beast, so kill me if you dare!\u201d The marking on his forehead shone as he lay down his threat.</p><br/><p><em>You don\u2019t want to be my contracted beast? I don\u2019t want a burden like you either!</em></p><br/><p>Yao Si rolled her eyes. \u201cSeeking death? I\u2019ll grant your wish!\u201d She reached for the sword on the ground, tossing it toward him while taking the time to soothe her mental strength. \u201cHurry! I\u2019m in a rush.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou-you\u2026\u201d He stilled slightly before straightening up. He glanced over at the sword, but couldn\u2019t seem to reach out for it. \u201cAre you trying to avoid your responsibility after contracting me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d <em>What the f*ck? Hey, don\u2019t make it seem like I\u2019m being unfaithful! </em></p><br/><p>\u201cHeh, let me tell you, if you don\u2019t remove this blasted contract, I\u2019ll follow you to the end of the world! Forever and ever, till death do us part!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d <em>Who wants to be with you forever? Where is this absurd conversion going? </em> \u201cI don\u2019t know how to remove this f*cking contract!\u201d She retrieved her mental strength.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care. As long as the contract is valid, I will be by your side.\u201d He caressed his forehead, smirking coldly. \u201cHeh, if you hadn\u2019t coveted my physical body, why would I, the eldest disciple of the Heavenly Cultivation Sect, give myself to you?\u201d</p><br/><p><em>Give yourself\u2026 </em></p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t sprout rubbish!\u201d <em>Who coveted your physical body? Is this how you use this term? You failed your language test, right?! </em></p><br/><p>\u201cYou are stuck with me so don\u2019t you dare leave me behind.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d <em>This is getting weirder by the second\u2026 </em> \u201cWait a minute, we have to set this straight! You were the one who stole our soul-devouring beast\u2019s organ, so we had to take action.\u201d <em>Don\u2019t you deserve what happened?</em></p><br/><p>\u201cWho said I stole it?\u201d He grew increasingly more panicky, bolting upright with a face full of anger. \u201cWe are a reputed and honorable sect, so there is no way we would do such a dishonorable thing. I have been chasing the soul-devouring beast for a few hours and had lured it to the cloud swallowing beast herd to expend it\u2019s energy.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhile chasing after the cloud swallowing beasts, a large chunk of its energy had been used up. We had laid down traps about fifty meters away to capture the beast, but all those plans were foiled by you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si stilled, glancing at the distance There was indeed a glow that came from magic there. Was it really from them?</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not right! That was just a small beast and it wasn\u2019t injured at all.\u201d The demonic beast they had defeated was filled with life and energy which was completely unlike in the description. Besides, the man was the one chasing the beast.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt can be!\u201d he replied firmly. \u201cWe have been eyeing it for the past few hours so how could it be wrong?\u201d He headed over to the defeated soul-devouring beast and directed an attack at its body. \u201cBesides, we have already marked it with magic, so we can just check it now\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He paused mid-sentence, focusing on the motionless beast. He stilled then, testing it several more times, but the beast remained the same without any marking.</p><br/><p>His face paled at rapid speed as he muttered with horror, \u201cWhy\u2026 why is there another one. Where is the one we were chasing then?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow do I know?\u201d Yao Si rolled her eyes.</p><br/><p>Heh, wasn\u2019t it clear? They had been going after the wrong beast. The soul-devouring beast they had injured previously wasn\u2019t the same as the one that she had just defeated, so the entire situation was a misunderstanding. Yet the price the man had to pay was far to heavy\u2014he became a beast that could be summoned at will.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs this a beast you deliberately released in order to get me?\u201d he asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cGet lost!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>Yao Si had gained a contractor that sprouted rubbish out of nowhere\u2026 <em>What sort of experience is this?! </em> She felt a murderous urge.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince its a misunderstanding, I\u2019ll let bygones be bygones, but you\u2019ll have to bear responsibility for this contract.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d <em>Responsibility? How did I wrong you?! </em></p><br/><p>\u201cEven though your cultivation isn\u2019t high and you don\u2019t have the looks, this is after all the first time I\u2026 Ah! I can only accept my fate.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d <em>First time you what? Clarify yourself! </em></p><br/><p>\u201cDragging this out won\u2019t be ideal, besides, I\u2019m not a demonic beast. This has to be resolved or I won\u2019t have a choice but to follow you for the rest of your life.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d <em>Who wants to be followed by you for the rest of her life?!</em></p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m after all a living being, after doing\u2026 you need to provide me with an explanation.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d <em>What explanation do I need to give you? </em></p><br/><p>\u201cOh right, my name is Qin Changle. I should be a few years older than you so you can either call me Changle or Brother Qin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Brother\u2026 Qin?</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, I\u2019m after all the eldest disciple of the Heavenly Cultivation Sect, even if I now have to give myself to such a woman. It\u2019s\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShut up!\u201d Yao Si finally lost it and interrupted his monologue.</p><br/><p>Can the chatterbox just shut up? Back when they were still fighting, why didn\u2019t she realize how absurd his mouth was?! Why would he call himself Qin Changle when he was clearly Chatterbox Qin! If she had known, she would have never snatched the beast from him.</p><br/><p>How was he a beast that could be summoned at will? He was more like a nagging machine\u2014every sentence he sprouted was enough to craft a movie scene!</p><br/><p>Yao Si was starting to miss home\u2026</p><br/><p>After they got to know each other along the way and some physical interactions, Yao Si finally managed to shut the man up. She wasn\u2019t able to come up with a solution regarding what to do with him, so she had no choice but to bring the burden along with her.</p><br/><p>An originally two player game had become a family\u2026 ay, three player game. Yao Si assumed that this would be the last of such absurdities, but she had clearly underestimated their luck. Zan Zichen was no doubt a jinx, for the amount of bad luck he yielded was astounding!</p><br/><p>They met with a demonic beast while picking level five mystical grass.</p><br/><p>They met with another demonic beast while picking level four mystical grass!</p><br/><p>They met with yet another demonic beast while picking level three mystical grass\u2026</p><br/><p>They could even meet a demonic beast\u2026 doing his business while picking the tiny grass along the road.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Yao Si.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Zan Zichen.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Qin Zhangle.</p><br/><p>One guy was a chatterbox and the other a jinx! Yao Si was starting to become suspicious about her life. What kind of people was she meeting?</p><br/><p>\u201cDemon girl\u2026 did you just intrude on the nest of a demon beast?\u201d Chatterbox Qin asked while panting heavily.</p><br/><p>Yao Si glanced at the person beside her. \u201cEh, Jinx\u2026 Zan Zichen, is this why Shi Fang sect leader schemed to kick you out?\u201d</p><br/><p>In just a short span of time, they had managed to see more species of demonic beasts than there were planets in the celestial realm. There were small level one beasts and big ones of level eight and nine; there wasn\u2019t any they hadn\u2019t encountered. At the start they would be cautious at the sight of level five beasts, but by then, they could calmly defeat level nine beasts without a moment\u2019s hesitation.</p><br/><p>The constant fights continued to strengthen Yao Si\u2019s mental strength. At the start, she had to struggle just to produce a single mahjong tile, but by then, she could tell which tile came out with her eyes closed. It wouldn\u2019t be long before she could produce a whole set at once.</p><br/><p>Her improvement had to be credited to Zan Zichen\u2019s bad luck. While thinking about that, she was starting to pity Shi Fang Sect. How did that child manage to survive till such age?</p>\n</div>"}

After going through the immigration records of all celestials, he had managed to narrow the search to that planet.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, Master.\u201d Number 27 floated over after bouncing up and down on Qu Ze\u2019s shoulders. \u201cI hacked into every celestial\u2019s optical computer. Even though this Heavenly Demon is a country bumpkin that doesn\u2019t have an optical computer, I managed to find photos of him in the neighboring planet. There is a 99% chance that he is on this planet.\u201d</p><br/><p>Country bumpkin\u2026</p><br/><p>Yao Si was speechless and unconvinced, thanks to Qu Ze\u2019s previous bad record. Even though he had proven himself, she still couldn\u2019t help turning toward the only person with insight. \u201cMaiden Yue, what do you think?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Yue felt his face stiffen. Maiden Yue??</p><br/><p>Even since the day he had been dragged to the Red Planet in the middle of his bath, everyone, including Yan Xuan, had started to see him in a different light. He felt that there was a need to justify himself. With a cough, he turned to Yao Si with a serious expression. \u201cYour Highness, I think you might have a slight misconception about me. As a celestial of the Nine Heavens, I am a man. Please do not doubt my preferences. Could you change the way you address me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, don\u2019t sweat the small things.\u201d Yao Si waved her hand dismissively. <em>Aren\u2019t you just a guy who likes pink? </em>\u201cThen let\u2019s go with Pink Yue. Do you really think Xing Chong is here?\u201d She smoothly changed the way she addressed him.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d <em>What\u2019s wrong with liking pink? Does it make you less of a celestial?</em></p><br/><p>Besides, wasn\u2019t it a bloodling matter? Why did they have to drag him along to the demonic realm?</p><br/><p>Li Yue, who had always been cold and elegant, started to feel frustrated. Yet\u2026 he had to maintain his graceful smile!</p><br/><p>o(&gt;\ufe4f&lt;)o</p><br/><p>\u201cAccording to the environment here, it is indeed suitable for demonic cultivation. It is highly likely that he will be here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d Mu Xuan instructed, pulling onto his cub\u2019s hands as he led the pack.</p><br/><p>Little Ball brought them to an uninhabited planet which had barely a soul in sight. It was littered with volcanos; the temperature horrifyingly high. Yao Si couldn\u2019t understand why anyone would come there for cultivation.</p><br/><p>But to Little Ball, who could hack into anything, tracing a demon that didn\u2019t even try to conceal himself was a piece of cake. In order to maintain an element of surprise, they decided not to walk the official road but opt to visit him personally. Together with Mu Xuan, Li Yue, and Qu Ze, she reached the planet to thoroughly investigate what had happened in Nirvana.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe demonic powers seem to congregate at the front. Heavenly Demon Xing Chong should be right ahead.\u201d Li Yue pointed toward the tall volcano ahead. He then seemed to think of something as he explained awkwardly, \u201cXing Chong is currently in cultivation. Besides, we have a private score that is unsettled. I\u2019m worried he won\u2019t meet us\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s head in first then!\u201d Before he could finish his sentence, he felt an overwhelming mental strength enveloping all of them, and the scenery started to change. The spell was broken, and a small pathway showed up, leading into the volcano.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Li Yue.</p><br/><p>All right, he seemed to have forgotten the presence of the bloodling king whose mental strength was one of the greatest in the Galaxy. It instantly boosted Li Yue\u2019s confidence.</p><br/><p>Xing Chong was positioned in the middle of the volcano that was surrounded by lava. The moment they entered, the scenery changed, creating a stark contrast to the exterior. Even the overwhelming temperature vanished.</p><br/><p>Celestials were indeed a progressive race. If the activation of mental strength was considered a trait, the high technology inside was the trait of the Galaxy\u2014lasers, poison gas, both cold and hot weapons, without any one missing.</p><br/><p>However, with Mu Xuan around, no trap was strong enough. The four of them walked without any obstruction holding them back. Even when occasional spells ambushed them, all of them were deflected away. The technologically advanced weapons could have become a hassle, but with Nr. 27 Little Ball and Qu Ze\u2019s coordination, they weren\u2019t an issue either.</p><br/><p>The smooth journey bored Yao Si, and she suddenly felt like she was wasting her time. Why did she have to come along anyway?</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re here!\u201d They finally reached the deepest part of the volcano.</p><br/><p>Yao Si inhaled deeply, tightening her grip around Mu Xuan\u2019s hand before they entered. The last barrier was a waterfall. With just one strike from Mu Xuan, it fell apart, but Yao Si couldn\u2019t help worrying. With such a tight security, she started to feel cautious of the Heavenly Demon. He might even be in cahoots with Euphoria, doing despicable business here\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cMmh\u2026 Ah\u2026 Hurry, give me\u2026 Harder!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHeavenly Demon, don\u2019t rush, I\u2026 will pleasure you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo\u2026 there, don\u2019t\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHeavenly Demon, don\u2019t what?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHateful\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>R21 voices started to drown their senses. The room had a massive bed upon which two naked bodies lay\u2014one on top of the other\u2026 both male.</p><br/><p>(\u2299 o \u2299)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Yao Si. <em>Is it too late to retreat?</em></p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Qu Ze, +1!</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Little Ball, +2!</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Li Yue. <em>We need to break off ties with them!</em></p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Mu Xuan. <em>There\u2019s always someone who wants to taint my cub\u2019s mind!</em></p><br/><p><em>Eyes hurt! I\u2019m going to go blind!</em></p><br/><p>Yao Si stiffened and turned to the person beside her. \u201cMaiden Yue, do all celestials have such\u2026 unique preferences?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Yue froze. <em>What\u2019s with your insinuating gaze?!</em></p><br/><p>He felt a serious need to justify himself. He immediately said resolutely, \u201cHe belongs to the demonic clan. We aren\u2019t the same! Besides, my disciple is a female!\u201d</p><br/><p><em>Eh\u2026 I never asked about the gender of your disciple? Did you just expose yourself?</em></p><br/><p>(\u2299_\u2299)</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Before Yao Si could clarify the situation, Li Yue howled and successfully managed to divert everyone\u2019s attention.</p><br/><p>The person at the bottom hurriedly shoved the person on top away. With a wave, a long red sword appeared in his hands and he glared at the intruders. When he saw Li Yue, he froze before smirking. \u201cLi Yue! Heh, I never thought you\u2019ll come all the way here!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si was speechless. So he was the one at the bottom? <em>You have indeed shamed the Heavenly Demon\u2019s name!</em></p><br/><p>Such strong tastes! No, no, no, she needed to get the image out! She needed to maintain her composure.</p><br/><p>\u201cXing Chong, I haven\u2019t yet gotten an explanation from you for hurting my disciple.\u201d</p><br/><p><em>Wow! </em>Li Yue really had something against him? Yao Si took a glance at the man hiding behind Xing Chong, and the jarring scene from a moment ago filled her mind again\u2026 She could feel a heartbreak coming.</p><br/><p>\u201cHeh! So what if I had even killed her?\u201d Xing Chong was so preoccupied by the sudden appearance of an enemy that he simply disregarded the three others on the side.</p><br/><p>With an arrogant smile, he released a dark aura. It was in stark contrast to the flirtatious bantering from before. \u201cThat b*tch is just an earth celestial with poor skills. It wouldn\u2019t have been a waste even if she had died.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShut up!\u201d Li Yue fumed. \u201cEven though Yu Er is just an earth celestial, she\u2019s my only disciple!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDisciple? Don\u2019t try to sugarcoat it!\u201d Xing Chong fumed, bolting up in agitation. The half covered body came in full view as the blanket slipped off. As the HD figure appeared, Mu Xuan hurriedly covered his cub\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p><em>Mmh, I\u2019m definitely going to go blind!</em></p><br/><p>But f*ck, the lights had dimmed at the crucial moment! She shouldn\u2019t have brought her guardian along. Yet even though the graphics had been removed, the sound still managed to reach her ears.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat disciple?! If that b*tch hadn\u2019t seduced you, how could you have decided to break up with me so heartlessly!\u201d</p><br/><p>Eh? This was starting to feel weird! The three in the audience stilled; there seemed to be more to the story than they thought!</p><br/><p>\u201cYu Er is my one and only true love. I love her! What does that got to do with you?\u201d Li Yue shouted out, deciding to come clean.</p><br/><p>\u201cTrue love\u2026 Y-y-you\u2026\u201d Xing Chong started to tremble in fury. \u201cIf she is your true love, then what about me? Have you forgotten about the friendship we forged after the thousand years we spent in cultivation?\u201d</p><br/><p><em>Cultivation? What cultivation? What kind of cultivation? Please clarify!</em></p><br/><p>\u201cYour persistence is too extreme and may cause you to fall in too deep.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe that after so many years, you still haven\u2019t fallen for me!\u201d He walked forward with aggressiveness.</p><br/><p>Li Yue\u2019s face twisted. \u201cAll this while we have only been friends.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho the f*ck wants to be your friend?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYu er is\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShut up, shut up!\u201d</p><br/><p>The audience stayed speechless. What should they do? The scene before them seemed to belong to the ridiculous soap dramas.</p><br/><p>Celestials sure were wild.</p><br/><p>The plot was starting to turn into a poorly written drama as Xing Chong ran over with a devastated expression. It would have been a sad scene if\u2026 he wasn\u2019t completely naked.</p><br/><p>Mu Xuan\u2019s face darkened, the last string of control snapping as his mental strength came exploding out. In an instant, other than a certain someone who had her eyes covered, everyone else fell on the ground with a thud.</p><br/><p>\u201cPut on clothes before you quarrel!\u201d</p><br/><p><em>Can\u2019t you see that there are children here? What if my cub grows astray?</em></p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Xing Chong, who noticed the presence of others.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Li Yue who had gone overboard.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Young Cub Yao Si.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Qu Ze and Little Ball. Even though they had no idea why they were being punished as well, they couldn\u2019t help feeling impressed.</p></div>\n</div>"}

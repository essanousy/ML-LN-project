If he didn\u2019t say it out loud, she could still feign ignorance.</p><br/><p>Tears were on the verge of falling down her cheeks. Such sorrow!</p><br/><p>\u201cPretty lady, don\u2019t worry.\u201d Xijin misunderstood her expression as shock from the scene and hurriedly stepped in front of her to block her view. \u201cThe police will be here soon. Even though I\u2019m not sure what the intruder wants, I\u2019ll be protect you from it all. Everything will be fine!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI think\u2026 he\u2019s here to get me.\u201d Yao Si raised her arm weakly.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Xijin stilled, turning over to her in shock. \u201cYou actually know\u2026 that ugly guy!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEr\u2026\u201d <em>How is he ugly, stop using your absurd sense of beauty to insult me!</em></p><br/><p>The Aqua Planet was indeed horrifying. Yao Si wanted to leave as soon as possible.</p><br/><p>She took two steps forward, waving her arms at Mu Xuan. \u201cI\u2019m here!\u201d</p><br/><p>The next instant, he was right beside her. With a tightening around her waist, she collapsed into his embrace. He crushed her with his hold while inspecting her anxiously. \u201cAre you alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m alright.\u201d She nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet her go, she\u2019s mine,\u201d the little merman shouted in fury at Mu Xuan. Why did everyone want to snatch his wife?</p><br/><p>Mu Xuan averted his gaze from her to the crowd in front of him. The air around him chilled instantly, and the water at his feet started to freeze into blocks of ice. Gradually, the surroundings began to freeze over as well. Everything in a few hundred meters radius became ice, even the registration behind them turned into an igloo.</p><br/><p>It was those people, they had abducted his precious cub!</p><br/><p>\u201cWait a minute!\u201d Yao Si jumped and took hold of Mu Xuan who was on the verge of a craze. <em>Calm down, calm down! </em>\u201cIt\u2019s a misunderstanding.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xijin and Manager Carp stumbled backwards, clearly shocked by the ice. Even little merman was frightened, the scales below their fish heads paling, but even so, Xijin didn\u2019t forget about her. \u201cLittle sis, this man is scary and ugly. He must be a bad person, so hurry over here!\u201d</p><br/><p><em>Please retract the word ugly, thank you! </em></p><br/><p>-_-|||</p><br/><p>\u201cErm\u2026 He\u2019s here to find me,\u201d Yao Si explained. \u201cThat\u2019s the reason why I can\u2019t stay here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re married to him?\u201d Xijin turned to look at Mu Xuan.</p><br/><p>\u201cEr\u2026\u201d <em>Does a game wedding count? </em> In order to dash their hopes, she nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d</p><br/><p>The minute she acknowledged it, she could feel Mu Xuan stiffening. His arms tightened around her.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow can that be?\u201d the three mermen exclaimed in disbelief. They then glanced at Mu Xuan with disgust while their faces clearly said: He must have saved an entire village in his previous life to have been able to marry such a beautiful wife.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Yao Si chose to remain silent.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s alright, little sis!\u201d Xiye took a step forward, his eyes bright. \u201cEven if you\u2019re married, Xiye is willing to be with you. I don\u2019t mind at all.\u201d</p><br/><p><em>What?</em></p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d Xijin was influenced by Xiye and turned to gaze at her lovingly. \u201d Since you can even accept someone that looks like.\u2026 Please, accept me as well! I don\u2019t mind as long as I can be with you, even as the mistress\u2026 No, even as the second mistress, I\u2019m willing.\u201d</p><br/><p><em>Hey, hey, hey! Are you guys being serious? I could understand if the young boy was being ridiculous, but are you as an adult joining the ruckus?</em></p><br/><p>Manager Carp stood at the corner nodding seriously. \u201cAh, it\u2019s perfectly normal for a lady with your looks to have a few lovers.\u201d</p><br/><p><em>How the f*ck is that normal! Stop spouting rubbish and throwing your morals and sense of beauty away! </em></p><br/><p>\u201cCome on little sis, shall we resume our marriage registration?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, for your sake, we are willing to live together harmoniously!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle lady, won\u2019t you accept the two Highness?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>(\u256f\u2035\u25a1\u2032)\u256f\ufe35\u253b\u2501\u253b</p><br/><p><em>Who would want to stay in such a weird planet?!</em></p><br/><p>Mu Xuan\u2019s face darkened. A vein was pulsing on his forehead, on the verge of eruption. Yao Si sucked in a deep breath before exclaiming, \u201cI\u2019m a bloodling!\u201d</p><br/><p>A grim silence fell upon the group.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>One minute later\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cPrestigious bloodling lady, may I know if you have chosen a flight out of our planet? If you haven\u2019t, we can arrange one right away just for you!\u201d Manager Carp suggested.</p><br/><p>\u201cPrestigious bloodling lady, have you prepared your luggage? Do you need any local specialties? We have all sorts of fish here! Do you need fish meat, fish sauce, or dried fish?\u201d Xijin asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle sis, please mind your steps and have a safe journey back!\u201d Xiye said seriously.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Yao Si.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Mu Xuan</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Lu Chen, the audience.</p><br/><p>-_-|||</p><br/><p><em>Isn\u2019t the change a little too drastic? Had I known about it, I would have said it earlier\u2026 </em></p><br/><p>\u201cI have already informed the immigration pier.\u201d Manager Carp pointed to his optical computer, remaining calm and composed as though unaffected by the turn of events. He would have been an exemplary service personnel, if he just wasn\u2019t trembling so much.</p><br/><p><em>F*ck! </em>He had thought they managed to secure a good deal with the little beauty, but who would have know that she was a bloodling. It explained the man\u2019s horrifying show of power! To snatch a bloodling\u2019s wife was definitely seeking death, no wait\u2026 seeking the extinction of one\u2019s race.</p><br/><p>If only they could forget about the whole affair.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you want to leave on the flight in two hours?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s alright, we\u2019re here with a friend.\u201d Yao Si was suddenly remembered something and turned to glance at the person beside her. \u201cLu Chen, could we use your aircraft? Do you mind?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Chen stilled momentarily before breaking into a radiant smile and jumping up maniacally. \u201cI don\u2019t mind, of course I don\u2019t mind! I welcome you with open arms!\u201d Sis was indeed loyal. \u201cLets go, we can leave right this instant.\u201d</p><br/><p>He scooted behind her immediately, as though worried someone would stop him.</p><br/><p>The three mermen sent them to the pier politely, even providing Lu Chen\u2019s aircraft with a servicing.</p><br/><p>Xiye, who stilled possessed a childlike demeanor, was full of regret as he stared at Yao Si pitifully. In contrast, the other two mermen had radiant smiles and were acting compliantly as though prepared to volunteer their life\u2019s fortune to her if she just asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cGoodbye, little sis!\u201d Just as the doors were about to shut, the little merman couldn\u2019t help dashing forward to wave at her.</p><br/><p>\u201cGoodbye!\u201d Yao Si waved back.</p><br/><p>Mu Xuan stationed himself by the door to take one last look at the Aqua Planet. Even though his cub insisted that it was all a misunderstanding and nothing detrimental had happened, he still felt the need to move them away.</p><br/><p>The aircraft soon left the Aqua Planet. By then, Yao Si had thoroughly lost interest in it. Besides, the disgusted expressions given by the three mermen as they flew off the planet left her feeling anxious and choked up inside. The main point was that they saw her as a pretty flower while Mu Xuan as dung. This meant that\u2026 the dung was actually\u2026</p><br/><p>Her heart was bleeding!</p><br/><p>She couldn\u2019t help turning to focus on Lu Chen who was driving the aircraft.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother, let me ask you a question, but you have to be honest with me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGreat sis, you\u2019re my life\u2019s savior! I will definitely tell you anything you want to know!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you think about\u2026 how I look?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEr\u2026 Sis, would you beat me if I told the truth?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p><em>I\u2019m sorry, I want to beat you even if you don\u2019t answer!</em></p></div>\n</div>"}

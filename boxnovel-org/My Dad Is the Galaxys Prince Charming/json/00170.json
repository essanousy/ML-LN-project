When I returned, he was already dead. The specifics on how he dead might be\u2014\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe found his contractor,\u201d Mu Xuan said.</p><br/><p>Lin Long face stiffened, and he started his endless cursing once more. \u201cYes, yes, yes, all of you have a contractor and I\u2019m the only one without her, happy? F*ck. If it weren\u2019t for you guys, would I still be here?\u201d</p><br/><p>To find a contractor on the same universe was considered a miracle. He had already suspected that it was the reason behind the old man\u2019s death hence he wanted to try his luck in another universe, but till now, he still hadn\u2019t found a way out. It was Yao Si\u2019s appearance that had confirmed to him that he couldn\u2019t find his contractor here. But at the same moment, the king beast that he had reared with difficulty was killed as well\u2026</p><br/><p>Yao Si and Mu Xuan shared a glance, starting to feel embarrassed. Even though their actions were understandable, it was after all their fault.</p><br/><p>\u201cAhem\u2026 that someone.\u201d Yao Si was suddenly reminded of someone. \u201cDidn\u2019t you mention that two pure breeds can travel through the universe without the help of the king beast? Why not\u2026\u201d She turned toward Mu Xuan. Even though she wasn\u2019t sure about his bloodline, they could still try it. \u201cWhy don\u2019t\u2026we help you test it out?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>In the end, Lin Long remained around, but it wasn\u2019t because he wanted to do it. Even with Mu Xuan\u2019s ability, certain preparations were still necessary. He needed to find a primer, a point similar to something in his original universe. Only then would he be able to open a space portal accurately.</p><br/><p>This primer was the Blue Planet, which was quite similar to his mother planet . He needed it to return, and it was the reason why he\u2019d spent quite a lot of effort in reconstructing it. But now, it\u2026 was in shambles.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, the fragments were still floating around, making the reconstruction much easier. But with the large number of fragments, it\u2019d still take a while to piece everything together. Mu Xuan promised to send him back after he managed to piece the planet back, then brought Yao Si back to the Red Planet.</p><br/><p>A tumultuous period tided over just like that. However, from then on, there were no longer any sightings of galactic beasts, causing many businesses that centered around it to go down. The Alliance which prided itself on having the best hunters could no longer monetize this segment of their income.</p><br/><p>Yao Si couldn\u2019t help her longing for something ever since the galactic beasts disappeared. Hence, she silently sent a message\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat has your cravings for galactic beast curd have to do with me? Why are you telling me when you aren\u2019t even my contractor? What? The ones I raised?! Are you blind? Didn\u2019t you see all of them die? Where do you expect me to get them then? I already told you there are no more! Not a single drop left! If you\u2019re that great, why don\u2019t you go up to the Heavens and get them!\u201d With a thud, he then slammed the phone shut.</p><br/><p>Three days later\u2026 Yao Si received a gigantic parcel with three huge bottles of fresh galactic beast blood. It was piping hot and would last her for up to three weeks.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p><em>Having special treatment is great! </em></p><br/><p>\u256e(\u256f\u25bd\u2570)\u256d</p><br/><p>As the galactic beasts industry went into its sunset years, a new business plan blossomed. Once the planets holding the breeding farms were proven to be safe, they were developed into tourist attractions. Due to the special benefits from the ponds, those that visited left with amazing reviews, bringing about even more traffic and boosting the planets\u2019 economy. With the fall of some, there were joys for others.</p><br/><p>Yao si couldn\u2019t\u2019 help being reminded of the special red fluid within the Red Planet. It seemed slightly different from the water in the breeding farms.</p><br/><p>Lin Long told her that it was his past hibernation spot, so the main purpose of it was that of a pillow. It was unlike the breeding farms which could bring about special benefits.</p><br/><p>It was common for single dog bloodlings to develop a hibernation habit. Previously, Mu Xuan would often sink into hibernation for a few hundred years, but not one bloodling would hibernate to the extent as Lin Long who sometimes slept for a few thousand years. It was thus understandable for him to create a blood fog for a more comfortable sleep.</p><br/><p>Besides, according to Lin Long, ancestors like them would hibernate often to seal their memories so they could restart as a brand new people when they woke up.</p><br/><p>Yao Si could understand their intentions. Even the bloodlings on the Red Planet would sometimes feel an urge to take revenge against the society due to their long lifespans, let alone ancestors like Lin Long who couldn\u2019t die. If they kept remembering every single detail of their life, it would definitely drive them crazy.</p><br/><p>Yao Si was then reminded of Mu Xuan\u2019s identity issue. Lin Long had been confident about him being a pure breed, since it was the only explanation for having an ability that was greater than his. As for his insistence on being a fourth generation, he had to have implanted that memory and sealed a considerable amount of his ability before his hibernation. This was probably how he ha managed to pass off as a fourth generation when he awakened. However, during the doomsday, the powers within him had awakened, explaining his current abilities.</p><br/><p>This was also the reason behind his inability to convert others. It wasn\u2019t because of his earlier assumption on how his bloodline was thicker, making it impossible for an average an earthling to withstand it, but because he already had a contractor, making his body automatically resistant.</p><br/><p>This meant that Mu Xuan was a legitimate ancestor.</p><br/><p>As the cub of the ancestor, didn\u2019t it mean that Yao Si was a\u2026 first generation?</p><br/><p>She suddenly felt herself swelling with pride inside!</p><br/><p>\u256d(\u256f^\u2570)\u256e</p><br/><p>Yao Si lounged at home for two whole months, her main tasks being eating, sleeping, playing games, and staring at Mu Xuan\u2026</p><br/><p>She was positive that he had developed a post-traumatic stress. Ever since the day she had sneaked away and met Lin Long, who held her captive for three days, a sense of alarm had shrouded Mu Xuan\u2019s mind. He as though the whole world was trying to snatch his young cub. He was beside her at all times, never leaving her hands alone and hugging her whenever possible. He couldn\u2019t even take his eyes off her while preparing their meals.</p><br/><p>He would nag on relentlessly, sparing no efforts to educate her about the perils in the Galaxy. It was to the point that Yao Si\u2019s common knowledge had morphed into \u2018100 ways to contact your guardian\u2019, \u2018Cultivation through staying home\u2019 , \u2018Follow your guide\u2019, \u2018Where\u2019s the young cub\u2019, and etc.</p><br/><p>Mu Xuan acted as though she would disappear the moment he turned his back to her. The intensity of his gaze made Yao Si feel\u2026 satisfied!</p><br/><p>\u201cMu Xuan, it\u2019s been a while since we laid out the cards. Don\u2019t you think its time for some advancement? Perhaps we should sleep together?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cD-don\u2019t make a fuss, be obedient\u2026 slee-sleep tight!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, but if I\u2019m by myself at night and someone comes to get me\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>In a flash, a certain someone climbed into the bed.</p><br/><p>\u256e(\u256f\u25bd\u2570)\u256d</p><br/><p>Yao Si suddenly found a remedy for Mu Xuan\u2019s bashfulness.</p><br/><p><em>Mmh, such days could last a little longer\u2026</em></p></div>\n</div>"}

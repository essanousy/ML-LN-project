However, she couldn\u2019t understand the level of hatred they held for him, to the point that team \u2018Kill Running Qu\u2019 seemed to be a norm around there.</p><br/><p>Yao Si had intended to retaliate at first, but despite her capabilities, she wouldn\u2019t be able to match up to millions of attackers!</p><br/><p>On the hundred and first time she had avoided their attacks, her bloodling power started to falter, and she fell on the floor in exhaustion. What exactly had Qu Ze done to incur such fury?</p><br/><p>\u201cAren\u2019t we NPCs? Shouldn\u2019t there be a resting mode?\u201d she asked. They were in a game, so was it really alright for the NPCs to be chased with such relentlessness?</p><br/><p>Qu Ze was too exhausted to respond. Instead, Bai Yi volunteered, \u201cYour Highness, this is a real-life game. Even though there is a program installed, it\u2019s different from the awareness web. There isn\u2019t a chance for revival, and this applies to NPCs as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhich means that if we die here we really die?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p><em>F*ck! If everything here is real, why did they even call it a game? </em>She felt like beating someone up again!</p><br/><p>After taking several deep breaths, she finally calmed down and turned to glare at Qu Ze who was panting like a dog. \u201cSpeak, why did you kidnap me here? It couldn\u2019t just be to take revenge against me, or to have me experience the game life, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>It definitely wasn\u2019t possible with his intelligence. It didn\u2019t make sense for him to take revenge against her when she had Mu Xuan as her support.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, Your Highness, could you stop doubting my sincere heart.\u201d Qu Ze turned to look at her, the cheeky smile still plastered on his face. \u201cI really missed you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si sent a punch his way.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d He altered his words hurriedly, shielding his face subconsciously. \u201cI just wanted Your Highness to help me out on a small matter.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou want my help?\u201d Yao Si stilled. <em>Are we that close?</em></p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s like this.\u201d Qu Ze coughed, swapping his cheeky smile with a solemn expression. \u201cI used the past two years to understand Nirvana\u2019s map and experienced the game\u2019s NPC and player roles.\u201d</p><br/><p>He seemed to have thought of something, for he coughed loudly to shield his thoughts. Heh, she could already imagine how he had experienced being a player.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot long ago, I found a hidden area on this planet. There is a formula that allows me to reset the program hidden there. Your Highness, you probably aren\u2019t aware of it, but I seem to have run into some trouble on this planet\u2026 So this lifeline that allows me to reset the program is crucial! With the formula, I won\u2019t be Running Qu anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou mean\u2026\u201d Yao Si\u2019s lips twitched. \u201cYou brought me all the way here from the First Academy just to help you get your formula?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, Your Highness! You\u2019re so intelligent!\u201d He stuck his thumb up in encouragement.</p><br/><p>\u201cGet lost!\u201d <em>I would need to be dumb to believe that. </em>\u201cAfterall, you\u2019re still a thirteenth generation bloodling. How can you not be able to deal with a simple formula in a game? Besides, you could get someone else, so why bring me here from such a faraway place?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t have a choice, since I\u2019m unable to enter that place.\u201d Qu Ze didn\u2019t seem to feel the least bit guilty as he continued, \u201cThat area is hidden behind a special mental barrier surrounding the area. I once announced a program mission for players to try and had even gotten NPC to try, but not one of them succeeded. I have no idea how to deal with that area.\u201d He turned to glance at her, his eyes aglow.\u201dSince the mental strength in our race is the strongest within those who are the oldest\u2026 There aren\u2019t many bloodlings that have a stronger mental strength than me hence\u2026 the first person that came to mind was you, Your Highness.\u201d</p><br/><p>Indeed, since he was a thirteenth generation bloodling, the only ones with higher status than him was her and Mu Xuan. He didn\u2019t dare to approach Mu Xuan, so he came for her?</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe\u2026\u201d Yao Si glanced at him with a smile. \u201cNot going!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Highness\u2026\u201d He placed his palms together and looked at her full of expectation. \u201cPretty please! You just have to enter the hidden map, and I promise to send you back to the Red Planet the moment after.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBack to Red Planet?\u201d Yao Si rolled her eyes. \u201cDidn\u2019t you just mention that we have to wait a month before we can contact the service staff?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s the normal procedure.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have another solution?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, I have been here for a few years after all. I\u2019m experienced!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHeh\u2026 Do you think I\u2019ll believe you?\u201d After being tricked so many times, she would rather believe in ghosts than in him!</p><br/><p>\u201cI swear on the bloodling ancestor.\u201d Qu Ze straightened abruptly, his right hand covering his heart. In a solemn voice Yao Si had never heard from him, he recited, \u201cI, Qu Ze, will go to any lengths to protect the safety of Your Highness, even if it takes my life.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si remained unconvinced. She wanted to run her mouth once more, but she heard Bai Yi take in a sharp breath while looking at Qu Ze in shock.</p><br/><p>Was something wrong?</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you really believe him?\u201d Yao Si asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut\u2026 Your Highness, he made a blood oath\u201d</p><br/><p><em>Blood oath, what\u2019s that?</em></p><br/><p>\u201cYour Highness.\u201d Bai Yi seemed troubled as he elaborated. \u201cBloodlings\u2019 oaths on the ancestor can never be taken back.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even it was just an oath? Was it really that serious? She had never thought that bloodlings were superstitious\u2026</p><br/><p>Yao Si had no faith in such an oath, especially when it came from Qu Ze.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Highness, the hidden map is here.\u201d Sensing her hesitation, Qu Ze hurriedly added, \u201cWhich means as long as we enter the map, regardless of whether they were players or NPC, anyone outside would not be able to find us.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si frowned, picturing a scene with aggressive attackers. Heading to the hidden map didn\u2019t seem like that bad of an idea. Besides, it was better than getting chased by a whole planet of enemies.</p><br/><p>In the end, she relented, agreeing to head over to the \u2018hidden area\u2019. She decided to first take a look, though. Somehow, she had her reservations about Qu Ze\u2019s suggestion.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great, Your Highness. Come, come, come. Let\u2019s first prepare ourselves. The hidden area is rather far away, so we might encounter a few small bosses.\u201d Qu Ze smiled radiantly while pulling out a few defensive mechanisms from his storage bag and tossing over a blue sword to her.</p><br/><p>Yao Si glanced at it. The sword had a row of words on it: Imperial Heaven Sword. There was even a date behind.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d She suddenly wasn\u2019t curious about the sword\u2019s origins.</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>Qu Ze was right. The hidden area was indeed far away. Only after passing through several transportation portals and avoiding a group of players did they finally reach a deserted forest.</p><br/><p>With Qu Ze\u2019s equipment, they no longer looked as haggard as before.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re here!\u201d Qu Ze lowered his head to glance at the map in his hands. \u201cThe hidden area I marked previously is right in front of us.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si turned toward the forest. Ahead of them was a massive green structure. It wasn\u2019t tall, with only about two or three floors. Hidden within the forest, it seemed like part of the forest.</p><br/><p>There was a small path with rows of ancient pillars lining its sides. Next to them, red, white, and purple flowers were blooming. All of them looked to have been nurtured with someone\u2019s effort.</p><br/><p>Just as Yao Si was about to head over, Bai Yi took a step, walking straight into a pillar.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?!\u201d Yao Si hurriedly grabbed for his hand, but while she spoke, Qu Ze walked head first into a pillar. His action was followed by a loud thud.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you blind?\u201d Yao Si mocked. \u201cHow could you walk straight into a pillar?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPillar? What pillar?\u201d Bai Yi turned to her in confusion.</p><br/><p>\u201cObviously it\u2019s the row of them ahead of us\u2026\u201d Yao Si stilled, her eyes going wide. \u201cCan\u2019t you see it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Yi was still a face of confusion, but Qu Ze headed over to hera in excitement, forgetting about the bruise on his head. \u201cThe mental barrier here indeed has no effect on Your Highness!\u201d He grabbed onto her excitedly. \u201cYour Highness, what do you see?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA pillar\u2026 A house.\u201d Yao Si pointed ahead of them. \u201cYou really can\u2019t see it?\u201d It was directly in front of them.</p><br/><p>\u201cAll I can see is a tree,\u201d Bai Yi replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be easy now that you can see. It means that Your Highness\u2019 mental strength is greater than that of the one who made this barrier, thus rendering the illusion ineffective.\u201d Qu Ze frowned. \u201cYour Highness, can your mental strength be brought out externally?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEhh\u2026\u201d Yao Si froze, recalling a certain country treasure. Could she say no?</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Highness, can you give your mental strength a tangible form so we can carry it around? This would allow us to see as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Highness, please!\u201d He nodded, and even Bai Yi looked at her in anticipation.</p><br/><p>Yao Si was speechless. Biting down on her lip to spread the mental strength, she morphed it into something tangible, like a mahjong tile, and placed one in each of their palms.</p><br/><p><em>Two bamboos and two dots. Mmh, it is indeed suitable for them.</em></p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d Bai Yi asked, lifting the biscuit with hunger in his eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cCough\u2026 It\u2019s a Chinese treasure from the ancient blue planet,\u201d Yao Si explained her nonsense seriously. Clearly, before her was a child that didn\u2019t patronize museums. \u201cIt\u2019s normal that you youngsters aren\u2019t aware.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh!\u201d Bai Yi nodded, his eyes brightening as he embraced the tile with an excited expression. Even though he couldn\u2019t understand what she meant, he figured that he was holding an antique.</p><br/><p>Even the bastard Qu Ze took several curious glances at the biscuit in his hands.</p><br/><p><em>Great! What a beautiful lie! </em></p><br/><p>\u256e(\u256f\u25bd\u2570)\u256d</p><br/><p>Yao Si heaved a sigh of relief.</p><br/><p>With the help of her mental strength, Bai Yi and Qu Ze were able to see the three-story building in front of them. They exchanged glances before heading over carefully.</p><br/><p>It was indeed a beautiful place. The flowers had a nice scent and bloomed all over the area. There were roses, lilies, lavenders\u2026 and every other flower out there! It seemed like a private garden.</p><br/><p>The place was scenic, but somehow it gave off an ominous vibe Yao Si couldn\u2019t explain.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think\u2026 it\u2019s too quiet?\u201d she couldn\u2019t help asking. Near a big house and a scenic view, it would be normal to find either a BOSS or at least an NPC. However, the entire time, they hadn\u2019t seen a single soul, neither human nor animal.</p><br/><p>\u201cLook over here!\u201d Bai Yi shouted abruptly, pointing toward the back of the house.</p><br/><p>Yao Si turned and inhaled sharply.</p><br/><p><em>F*ck!</em></p></div>\n</div>"}

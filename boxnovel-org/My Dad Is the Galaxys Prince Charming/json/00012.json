The next time he appeared before her was on her fifth day on the Red Planet.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy baby, do you want to learn things?\u201d Yan Xuan patted her on the shoulder. \u201cHow about uncle takes you to school so you can make some new friends?\u201d</p><br/><p>School! Yao Si\u2019s eyes suddenly brightened.</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t expect that there would be compulsory education in the galactic era. \u2018 <em>As an illiterate, this baby expresses that new knowledge is a must, it is indeed time to go to school and get some common sense!\u2019 </em></p><br/><p>\u201cThanks, Uncle Yan.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Xuan had a pleased smile on his face, showing acknowledgment for her studious attitude. He didn\u2019t delay, leading her straight out the door. Compared to when they arrived at the Red Planet, that cool sword wielding flight, this time Yan Xuan chose a more likely high-tech instrument.</p><br/><p>He led her straight to the side of what appeared to be a street and stood with her on a white cross sign. As soon as they stood still, the cross on the ground lit up and a faint operating noise could be heard. The ground shook and the floor in a quadrangle that was two meters around them suddenly rose up, resembling an elevator. It moved forward at a much faster speed though, and it looked like the floor was rushing ahead on it\u2019s own.</p><br/><p>This was really high-tech from the future.</p><br/><p>Before Yao Si had the opportunity to exclaim, they turned into a street block. Only now did she discover that there were many people that were on the side of the road but traveling in a different direction than they.</p><br/><p>On top of that, everyone else was moving at lightning speed, compared to their tortoise like movement. It was hard to say if this type of traveling was meant to let her know this planet better, maybe, since Yan Xuan introduced her to different things at the same time.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s the town hall, that\u2019s the Inspection and Quarantine Institute, on the other end was the Galactic Port. He introduced everything that they saw on the way to her clearly.</p><br/><p>The more Yao Si listened, the more amazed she felt, until she finally formed a blurry prototype in her mind of this galactic world that was completely different from the sci-fi movies. Looking at rows and rows of buildings that surpassed her imagination as they flashed past, she moved on from her initial astonishment to being amazed, and being amazed even more, and eventually\u2026 She got used to it!</p><br/><p>Since she didn\u2019t understand anything anyways. \u256e(\u256f\ufe4f\u2570\uff09\u256d</p><br/><p>That was until a giant green castle floating in mid-air turned up in her line of sight. It was different from all the other strangely shaped buildings. This castle was covered in green plants on the outside, and the building was in a small, rigid high-rise building style from Earth that she was familiar with.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that place?\u201d</p><br/><p>Whether it was because of the familiar style or something else, she felt an odd intimacy with that place from first sight. It made her unable to resist the urge to go over and take a look</p><br/><p>Yan Xuan\u2019s eyes shifted to the direction she was pointing. \u201cThat\u2019s the Majestic Palace, the place where his imperial highness hibernates.\u201d</p><br/><p>His imperial highness?</p><br/><p>Yao Si was confused, didn\u2019t the bloodlings enter the liberal democratic galactic era long ago? Maybe they had kept the constitutional monarchy! Just as she wanted to gain some comprehensive knowledge, the flying floor suddenly stopped.</p><br/><p>\u201cHere we are!\u201d Yan Xuan took a stride with his long legs and walked off the raised ground.</p><br/><p>Yao Si had no choice but to push her questions back inside her heart. May as well let it pass, since she will definitely learn such things in school; she had to start from the beginning regarding all the galactic stuff anyways. Hence she followed him out and stopped before a large gate.</p><br/><p>She subconsciously raised her head to take a look at the name of the school, and went stiff on the spot.</p><br/><p>The corner of her mouth twitched, and she felt as if ten thousand alpacas <sup>1</sup> had trampled across her heart forming one phrase \u201cf*ck you\u201d.</p><br/><p>There were three big, bright red words that were visible at the top.</p><br/><p>\u201cBloodling Royal Kindergarten!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si suddenly had an impulse to throw her university certificate of graduation at Yan Xuan\u2019s face. This starting from the beginning was way too back in the beginning! Even if she was a pure illiterate, she at least qualified to be sent to year one, what the hell was sending her straight to kindergarten for?</p><br/><p>\u201cMinister Yan, welcome.\u201d</p><br/><p>A forty to fifty years old looking woman walked out from inside the door and moved towards them to greet them very politely. She turned and took a look at Yao Si, and a smile that looked as gentle as water immediately bloomed on her face. She tilted her body slightly. \u201cThis is the baby that will be enrolling today?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, principal Yu.\u201d Yan Xuan moved to the side and let her come closer. \u201cIt\u2019s the one we just picked up from No. 333 space station.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHello, my baby.\u201d Principal Yu\u2019s expressions became even more tender. She moved closer again, extending her hand and caressing Yao Si\u2019s head. Using a pitch that was clearly a few notes higher than before, she introduced herself, \u201cMy last name is Yu, my baby, you can call me Mrs. Yu.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si was speechless from this strangely awkward, used-on-infants tone\u2026</p><br/><p>She immediately gripped the hand that the person was about to reach out to the top of her head and shook it. \u201cHello principal Yu, nice to meet you, my name is Yao Si.\u201d She must correct her, otherwise she will really be treated like a baby.</p><br/><p>Yu Jing was stupefied. As if surprised by her reaction, she turned and looked with confusion at Yan Xuan.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaybe it\u2019s because she woke up too early, a part of the genetic memory which she retained still hasn\u2019t faded away yet,\u201d Yan Xuan explained.</p><br/><p>Light dawned upon principal Yu, and the eyes which looked at Yao Si were suddenly filled with sympathy, as if they were about to tear up the next moment. \u201cWhat an unfortunate child. Minister, you must ask the space station thoroughly and make them give us an explanation.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, it\u2019s been taken care of.\u201d Yan Xuan\u2019s smile made his eyes narrow into a thin line.</p><br/><p>Yao Si couldn\u2019t help but to silently light a candle inside her heart.</p><br/><p><em>\u2018Brother Lu, I tried!\u2019 </em></p><br/><p>\u201cHer bloodline test results aren\u2019t out yet,\u201d Yan Xuan continued to explain the situation to principal Yu. \u201cWe\u2019ve searched all the files of hibernating bloodling members, especially those who sired newborns that were in hibernation. We haven\u2019t found who her sire is as of yet, it might still need some days, until then we will have to trouble you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, minister.\u201d Principal Yu nodded and took a look at Yao Si. \u201cWe will take good care of her.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Xuan finished talking then turned and looked at her again. He instructed with slight worry, \u201cMy baby, you must be good, you can make a lot of friends in here. Uncle will come and pick you up when holidays come, how\u2019s that?\u201d</p><br/><p><em>\u2018Is this foreshadowing for a boarding school?\u2019 </em>Yao Si allowed her mind one second to wonder back to the entirely pink room that she had been living in for the last five days, and nodded her head firmly.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood girl!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Xuan still wasn\u2019t satisfied. He glanced her up and down with the expression of a reluctant and loving father. After some time, he took a bangle-like object from his pocket. He took her hand and explained while putting the object around her wrist, \u201cThis is the newest model of optical computer, my contact number has been saved in there already. If you miss Uncle Yan, promise to use this to find me, alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si was shocked, ever since she was at the space station she had been a little curious about this advance optical computer bangle which almost everyone had. However, she would have never thought that Yan Xuan would just give her one.</p><br/><p>She couldn\u2019t help but feel warm at heart. Looking at Yan Xuan\u2019s gentle eyes she suddenly felt her nose grow sore as she held back the tears. Although Yan Xuan had treated her like a baby all this time, he was truly good to her. Without him being neither a kith nor kin, nothing could be said about him, a high-rank bloodling official picking her up and organizing everything for her on political grounds.</p><br/><p>Nevertheless, him doing everything by himself was far beyond where his duties lay, let alone giving her this optical computer, since one has to know by now that she was poor and knew nothing. According to her knowledge, this thing wasn\u2019t cheap. No matter how good the bloodling welfare was, it was not in the position of gifting optical computers randomly.</p>\n</div>"}

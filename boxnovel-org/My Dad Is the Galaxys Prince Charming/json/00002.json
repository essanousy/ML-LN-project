Peeping at the streets beneath that were ablaze with light, she found a black overcoat and prepared to go out, but then her phone suddenly rang.</p><br/><p>She fished it out of her pocket only to see the two words \u201cUnknown Number\u201d on the display. Her heart tightened, and she stared at the two words for a few seconds before taking a deep breath and picking up the call.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYao Si?\u201d A flat voice with no fluctuation in tone sounded from the other end. It contained a thorough coldness that could be felt across the distance.</p><br/><p>Yao Si felt her ankles weaken at the sound. \u201cYes\u2026 Yes, that\u2019s me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour death certificate has been granted.\u201d The other person didn\u2019t have any desire to exchange courtesies with her and straightforwardly said, \u201cThe process is finished. Where do you want it to be sent?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUmm\u2026\u201d The corner of Yao Si\u2019s mouth twitched, for she had almost heard it as \u2018Where do you want to die?\u2019. Although this was all expected, it still felt like she was picking a spot for her grave. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, just send it to me. I\u2019m an orphan so I have no family.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d the person gently responded. There was still no rise or fall in his voice. \u201cAlso, the verification that you demanded has been done, and the result is fifth generation.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFifth generation\u2026\u201d Yao Si immediately felt a sense of hopelessness. Needless to say, this result was quite disappointing.</p><br/><p>\u201cRight now is a troubling time, so we are unable to investigate in regards to who sired you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, I\u2019m used to it.\u201d She was an orphan since a young age, so this was just another time that she got orphaned.</p><br/><p>Perhaps because of her quick acceptance, the indifferent voice had two seconds of rare silence, then it suddenly opened its mouth and warned, \u201cThe great war is about to begin. Scattered newborns like you better not leave the house; otherwise, you won\u2019t even know how you have died.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAll right, thank\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour identification has been sent. From now on you are one of the bloodlings. Do be responsible for your actions.\u201d</p><br/><p>Before Yao Si could reply, the beeping tone from the phone rang out. <em>Are all bloodling civil servants this blunt?</em></p><br/><p>Yao Si looked at her phone for a few seconds without uttering a word. Right then, the doorbell rang.</p><br/><p>It was a delivery outside the door. She signed for the parcel and opened it up. There was only a bat-shaped card lying inside the box, and it was her identification. The bloodlings were indeed efficient at handling affairs. On the card was a large mark with the number \u201c5\u201d, proving that she was a fifth generation bloodling. Beneath that was her name and a long strand of numbers. She made a safe guess that it was something close to a social security number.</p><br/><p>She carefully scanned the identification card a few more times before tucking it into her inside pocket and letting out a long sigh. It was hard to believe that in a short span of a month she had changed from a pure human that lived under the sunlight and was raised beneath the red flag of socialism into a vampire that roamed in the darkness of night and lived on blood, especially the kind that had an official identification.</p><br/><p>Her stomach rumbled again in protest as Yao Si looked again at the sky outside that had gone completely dark. Only then did she relax and walk out the door with her wallet and keys. Her teeth itched in the dark and windy night. It was time for her to go out and eat some\u2026 Duck blood curd.</p><br/><p>\u2570(\uffe3\u25bd\uffe3)\u256d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, Sister Sisi, you\u2019re here.\u201d Just as she arrived at the marketplace, the eyes of Brother Li who sold duck blood gleamed. He waved at her, the vigorous smile making his face crumple together so it looked like a chrysanthemum.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Li.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat took you so long today?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe sun\u2019s too bright, I didn\u2019t want to leave the house,\u201d Yao Si responded carelessly. She crouched before the stall, diligently looking at the row of red, appetizing-looking duck blood curd, unable to prevent her mouth from watering.</p><br/><p>It smelled so good, so good, so good\u2026 She felt herself grow even hungrier.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou newborns!\u201d</p><br/><p>Brother Li chuckled, his expression that of a person who had experienced it all, and shook his head. He surveyed his surroundings, making sure that no one nearby could hear them talk. He then lowered his voice and said, \u201cInitially it\u2019s like that, you don\u2019t want to go out in daylight, but you will get used to it after some time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I know, thank you Brother Li.\u201d Yao Si nodded. If she had not met him, she wouldn\u2019t even know that she was no longer a human.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right, Brother Li was a vampire too. His full name was Li Zheng, and he was converted much earlier than Yao Si; it had been more than a hundred years since then.</p><br/><p>That day, when Brother Li told Yao Si that she was a vampire too, she thought that he was a maniac and almost called the police. However, a few days later, she began to realize that the transformations her body was undergoing matched his descriptions, even to the point of two retractable fangs in her mouth appearing\u2026</p><br/><p>It took her a month to finally accept the truth that she was no longer a human. As to the basics regarding the bloodlings, Brother Li had been filling her in. Different to the vampires on television that needed to hide and live on human blood, the actual bloodlings lived quite\u2026 carefree lives.</p><br/><p>Although they still lived on blood, there were many varieties from which they could choose \u2013 chicken blood, duck blood, pig blood, cow blood\u2026 As long as it was blood, it could be consumed as food that filled their stomach. Besides, there were all sorts of distinctive dishes that branched out of blood, duck blood curd being the most common vampire food. From that, it could be seen that there was no \u2018body\u2019 that drank human blood.</p><br/><p>Yao Si had asked Brother Li for the reason behind it, and he gave her a look as if he was looking at an idiot. He retorted, \u201cHave you ever seen any species that only eats one kind of food? Plus, is human blood even edible in this age? Humans nowadays eat tons of additives, melamine, preservatives, gutter oil, and other god knows what. What would happen if we got food poisoning from drinking human blood?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>It was so reasonable that Yao Si fell short of words to respond to it.</p><br/><p>To sum it up, the bloodlings, despite differences in lifestyle, diet, and physical characteristics, were not so different from humans. Their society also had organizations and laws, the kind that required every newborn to register for identification.</p><br/><p>If one insisted on asking Yao Si what was different from before, it would probably be that she had changed from spice lover to spicy-blood-curd lover!</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Li, let\u2019s have five kilograms.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOn it!\u201d Li Zheng rolled up his sleeves and began to pick fresh ones to package. As he was doing that, he asked, \u201cBy the way, Sisi, did your identification arrive yet?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s done, the ID was delivered today.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally!\u201d His eyes suddenly brightened. Carrying a bag in his hands, he walked out from inside the stall. \u201cWhat\u2019s the result? Did you find out your lineage? Have you found the bastard that bit you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Yao Si shook her head, picking out a piece of duck blood curd and placing it into the bag in his hands. \u201cBut I have already been verified, fifth generation.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFifth generation!\u201d Li Zheng was shocked, his face filled with disbelief. \u201cHow can that be? You look like you\u2019re full of potential.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true.\u201d Shaking away the water on her hands, Yao Si pulled out the card with the number \u20185\u2019 from her pocket.</p><br/><p>Li Zheng took a look at it, and his eyes revealed some sympathy as he patted her shoulder in comfort. \u201cDon\u2019t let your hopes die. There are advantages to being a fifth generation. At least you won\u2019t need to participate in the great war this time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGreat war?\u201d Yao Si was dumbstruck. \u201cWhat great war?\u201d</p>\n</div>"}

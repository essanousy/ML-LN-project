After the video was aired, she had gained a small following, so it was a must to maintain her image.</p><br/><p>Second, she was to report to him daily for at least half an hour. Also, once the two months were up, she was to return immediately.</p><br/><p><em>Mmh.. This is agreeable too.</em></p><br/><p>Third, she had to be home for her meals\u2026</p><br/><p><em>Definitely not! </em>She violently opposed this rule right away. She was about to enter a planet not recorded in the Galaxy, so there wouldn\u2019t be a portal for her to return through. How could she then come back for her meals every day?</p><br/><p>After this, Mu Xuan reluctantly agreed to change the rule \u2013 have the meals on time.</p><br/><p>On the day of her departure, Mu Xuan instructed her for two whole hours at the pier before stuffing her bag with a huge pile of things \u2013 mainly food. He was only satisfied after she had successfully missed the flight.</p><br/><p>Yan Xuan was there, too, with a pretty little girl by his side. He handed Yao Si a jade-like object. \u201cYour Highness, bring this along, it\u2019s from a friend. It should come in handy in an emergency.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Yao Si placed the object into her optical computer, then turned back to the frowning Mu Xuan.</p><br/><p>\u201cDad.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMu Xuan!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m leaving.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMmh.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll keep your rules in mind.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMmh.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be back once the holiday ends.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMmh.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just two months, everything will be fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMmh.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEr\u2026 Can you let go of my hands?\u201d <em>You\u2019ve been hold onto them for the past few hours, how can I enter the ship like that!</em></p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d A certain someone unwillingly released her hands.</p><br/><p>Yao Si took large strides to the ship. After she entered it, she turned back to wave goodbye. She had already missed the flight, so if she didn\u2019t board now, she would be left behind.</p><br/><p>After a short while, the ship\u2019s engine started, gradually rising in volume. Mu Xuan stood rooted at the same position as he stared at the ship until it disappeared.</p><br/><p>The next moment, he said, \u201cAre the preparations done?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes! Yes!\u201d Yan Xuan replied instantly. \u201cThey\u2019ll leave in ten minutes and will reach right after Her Highness lands.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMmh.\u201d Mu Xuan nodded, with no intention of leaving as he continued to stare in the direction the ship had disappeared.</p><br/><p>\u201cDad, was that Her Highness?\u201d the pretty female beside Yan Xuan asked excitedly.</p><br/><p>\u201cYea.\u201d Yan Xuan nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cEven though she doesn\u2019t look the same as in the video, but\u2026\u201d she added enthusiastically, \u201cshe\u2026 she\u2019s so handsome.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Was handsome used to describe a woman?</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Her Highness no doubt, to be able to venture into such a treacherous place by herself.\u201d She looked genuinely touched. \u201cIf-if it was me, I would never be able to leave my mentor.\u201d She then flew into Yan Xuan\u2019s embrace.</p><br/><p>Yan Xuan\u2019s gaze turned gentle instantly. \u201cMe too, I couldn\u2019t bear to leave you as well, not even for a second\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Before he could finish his sentence, a chilling glare landed on his person. At some point in time, Mu Xuan had turned around and was staring straight at them. The atmosphere around them froze, beginning to emit a frosty chill.</p><br/><p>It was\u2026 scary!</p><br/><p>\u201cYour\u2026Your Majesty?\u201d <em>What\u2019s wrong?</em></p><br/><p>Mu Xuan\u2019s gaze sunk. He glared at Yan Xuan frostly before saying coldly, \u201cShe\u2019ll be back soon!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh? Ah!\u201d <em>Who? Her Highness? What is he mentioning her for?</em></p><br/><p>Mu Xuan turned, waved his hand in the air, and disappeared into a space portal.</p><br/><p>Both Yan Xuan looked at each other, confusion written in both their eyes.</p><br/><p>They\u2026 did something wrong?</p>\n</div>"}

The moment Yao Si stepped into the lounge, a long and heavy sigh reached her. She turned in that direction and discovered a lifeless man in the corner. He slouched dejectedly, seemingly experiencing a deep trauma.</p><br/><p>He waved in greeting when she entered. \u201cGreat, you got cheated into marriage as well?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCheated?\u201d Yao Si stilled. She wasn\u2019t hallucinating after all!</p><br/><p>\u201cThose horrible aquas!\u201d He scowled, patting the seat beside him. \u201cCome take a seat! I\u2019m called Lu Chen. Since we\u2019re both brothers that got cheated, why not share how you got here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Was he also a foreigner that was forced into marriage? Yao Si settled beside him. \u201cI met a young merman who gave me a bunch of items. After accepting one\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow could you be so careless? Young mermen are also aquas! Didn\u2019t your parents teach you never to accept anything from the aquas?\u201d he chastised her resentfully.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Er, he didn\u2019t actually.</p><br/><p>\u201cEr\u2026 But i don\u2019t have the right to scold you since I got dragged into the same hole as well.\u201d He sighed, turning even more lifeless than before.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Yao Si didn\u2019t fathom the situation. Was aquas\u2019 weird custom widely advertised?</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know?\u201d Lu Chen glanced at her in shock.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d <em>What don\u2019t I know? </em></p><br/><p>\u201cI applaud your courage for coming here clueless.\u201d He gave her a once over before explaining everything. \u201cAquas don\u2019t have estrogen. If they want to reproduce, they have to find someone from a different race, gender not being part of the consideration,\u201d he spat out.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn order to exist, they are willing to use any means to trap foreigners here. The most notorious method is through an engagement\u2014as long as you accept anything from any aqua, the two parties will be considered engaged.\u201d</p><br/><p><em>Er\u2026 isn\u2019t this a forced marriage? </em></p><br/><p>-_-|||</p><br/><p>Lu Chen gritted his teeth. \u201cYour story is considered a little better than mine. F*ck, all I did was drink a cup of water! That\u2019s how I ended up here, about to register for my marriage. Had I known, I would have never landed in this planet regardless on how low my stores were.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d It was indeed a bad predicament.</p><br/><p>He shook his head, his face clouded with despair. \u201cEr, we\u2019re trapped here. The aquas are under protection from the bloodlings, and no one can offend them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBloodings?\u201d Yao Si froze. What did that have to do with her?</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you know? Bloodings and Aquas have a tight relationship.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Why didn\u2019t she hear anything about it before? This was also the first time she had ventured into this planet.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Aqua Planet is the closet to the Red Planet. Even though Aquas\u2019 wedding customs are quite ridiculous, the Alliance isn\u2019t able to object in fear of offending the Bloodings.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d So this was really her kind\u2019s fault.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh right, I forgot to ask. Sis, what should I call you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m\u2026 Siyao!\u201d Just before she exposed herself, she recalled the pseudonym she had created before the trip.</p><br/><p>\u201cSiyao sis, I\u2019m a Yao. What about you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEr\u2026 Blooding.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p><em>What?</em></p><br/><p>The lounge sank into silence for three seconds\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cSis, save me!\u201d Lu Chen hugged Yao Si, finally having found a savior. \u201cSince we are both in the same predicament, could you please help me out? I have a lover on my mother planet and I don\u2019t want to give birth to any aquas!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t bring me out, I\u2019ll be doomed the moment the aqua gets pregnant!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cChild support fees!\u201d he explained with agitation. \u201d I\u2019m just a measly trader so how would I afford to support children from the aquas?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow much is it to raise an aqua?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot much, it\u2019s similar to the Galactic standard.\u201d He grimaced with tears about to run down his cheeks.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey are able to give birth to a hundred at a time! I wouldn\u2019t be able to afford it even if the price was much lower!\u201d</p><br/><p><em>What? A hundred!</em></p><br/><p>(\u2299_\u2299)</p><br/><p>The aquas were really like fish?</p><br/><p>\u201cThe aquas reproduce by spawns, a few hundred each time, which means they\u2019re more fertile than the legendary bugs!\u201d It was the main reason why other races were so repulsed by the idea of visiting the Aqua Planet. He scratched his head while adding, \u201cThe aquas are very loyal and true to their lovers, but it\u2019s just that their fertility is too much for an average person to handle. Those that get cheated into marriage all end up in a dire financial situation.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>So there was probably a whole lot more princes who couldn\u2019t find a partner and had to resort to such underhanded tactics?</p><br/><p>-_-|||</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you tell them that you already have someone in your heart, maybe\u2026\u201d If he were to explain nicely, maybe they would let him leave?</p><br/><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t that easy, the aquas\u2026\u201d He was just about to elaborate when suddenly, the entire seabed rocked tremendously. Numerous shouts pierced the air.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Lu Chen bolted upright with a glance at her. \u201d Why don\u2019t we have a look outside?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si nodded and headed out of the room. The main dining area was deserted, but the sight revealed then startled them.</p><br/><p>The sea bottom was split into two halves, the water streaming sideways to form a pathway.</p><br/><p>Yao Si lifted her head, and as expected, a familiar figure came floating downward.</p><br/><p>Her nanny dad was finally here.</p><br/><p>Any later and she would have gotten \u2018remarried\u2019.</p><br/><p>(\u2565\u256f^\u2570\u2565)</p><br/><p>\u201cMu\u2026\u201d She walked forward instinctively. However, someone grabbed her arm the next moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cWife, be careful!\u201d Little Xiye held onto her tightly, his expression grave. \u201cA hideous man just came from the skies. Don\u2019t go over, or you might be startled by his looks.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p><em>What? </em>Yao Si\u2019s lips twitched. <em>Are your eyes alright? Do you know he\u2019s the Galaxy\u2019s number one male god? Even if he\u2019s using his mental strength on you, he shouldn\u2019t be that ugly? </em></p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d Xijin came over with a nod, agreeing with his brother like never before. \u201cI have never seen such an ugly person before. You should shield your eyes.\u201d He passed a kerchief to her.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>What\u2019s going on? Yao Si couldn\u2019t help looking at the crowd. Besides Lu Chen, everyone else was turning away in obvious disgust.</p><br/><p>Her mind blanked out for a moment, a horrifying thought emerging slowly.</p><br/><p>Mermen sense of beauty\u2026 was completely opposite of everyone else in the Galaxy?</p><br/><p>To be called a beauty by them meant\u2026</p><br/><p>Yao Si\u2019s breath came in a shudder as she pulled at the big fish beside her an</p></div>\n</div>"}

God Mu actually touched her head!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si felt her heart clench. Ever since she became the president, she hadn\u2019t once felt the pressure or difficulties that she had imagined herself about to face. The entire academy remained civil and respectful toward how things turned out, and even members of the student union were blindly obliging toward her demands. The president\u2019s words were basically an ultimatum. Even if someone disapproved occasionally, it didn\u2019t matter. They would have to change their views!</p><br/><p>What? What if something went wrong?</p><br/><p>Rubbish! How could the person chosen by God Mu be wrong! There was one basic value every God Mu fan had to have, and that was blind trust in him. Questioning the president was akin to questioning God Mu!</p><br/><p>President is a newcomer?</p><br/><p>What\u2019s wrong with being a newcomer? Aren\u2019t newcomers allowed to be popular? She had been chosen with votes from the entire school! Besides, which academy in the Galaxy had a student union president that had been personally chosen by God Mu?</p><br/><p>Mu Xuan\u2019s diehard fans were spread far and wide, and their ability to brainwash themselves to suit his wishes was undeniably remarkable. Yao Si had originally planned on quitting the committee using her lack of capability as an excuse, but that was no longer an option now. The very thought of it\u2026 was so frustrating!</p><br/><p>\u201cPresident, president\u2026\u201d The department head at the side tapped onto her arm.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh?\u201d Yao Si had been in a trance while working. She now stopped her hands and lifted her head from the pile of documents, then glanced at the crowd in front of her that was having a meeting. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s regarding the Zhuo Feng Academy. They would like to have a friendly competition with us,\u201d the department head said seriously. \u201cThe proposal is ready, we just have to confirm the location and date.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFriendly competition\u2026\u201d It sounded familiar. Out of habit, Yao Si turned to the side. \u201cIsn\u2019t Nephew Gu\u2026 <em>Cough. </em> Vice President Gu in charge of that\u2026 Eh?\u201d The seat next to her was empty. \u201cBai Yi, why isn\u2019t Shucheng here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow would I know?\u201d Bai Yi stopped playing with his pen. \u201cHey, President, even though me and Shu Cheng are from the same generation and we\u2019ve been playing together since we were young, I\u2019m not psychic, I can\u2019t read his thoughts. Besides\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEnough. Luo Ying, what do you know?\u201d Yao Si interrupted, no longer able to withstand his chatter\u2026 If it continued, even the readers might misunderstand and think the author was trying to increase the word count.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure either.\u201d Luo Ying was the long-legged female from before. She was the head of the entertainment department. After Bai Yi, she was the closest to the vice president. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t been home for the past few days and hasn\u2019t informed me about his whereabouts, but\u2026 he returned to the Red Planet a while back, I\u2019m sure it has something to do with that! President, you don\u2019t have to worry, it\u2019s normal for a bloodling to disappear once in a while.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Was there really such a tradition?</p><br/><p>\u201cOur race has always been withdrawn and aloof, we rarely stay in one place for a long period of time,\u201d she explained. \u201cEven sinking into hibernation for a couple of years os considered a norm, much less skipping a few days of school.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI think\u2026\u201d Bai Yi interrupted. \u201cShucheng must have\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, we\u2019ll it end here!\u201d Yao Si stood up. \u201cWe\u2019ll discuss the friendly battle when Vice President Gu is back.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEy, I\u2019m not done yet\u2026\u201d Bai Yi was still planning to continue. \u201cPresident\u2026 President\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si was already at the door. Fortunately, she left swiftly, for just after a few days, she could no longer withstand Bai Yi\u2019s incessant chatter.</p><br/><p>She lowered her head to glance at the pile of documents in her optical computer. With a deep sigh, she reminisced on how it used to be taken care of by Nephew Gu.</p><br/><p>A wave of worry stirred, and an ominous vibe ate at her. According to Luo Ying, the bloodlings were always a carefree bunch, sinking into a hundred-year hibernation at random, because of which disappearing for a few days was considered a norm. Yet even though this might be normal for others, it was definitely not so for Nephew Gu!</p><br/><p>Especially not when he was still in charge of her safety in the academy! Based on Yao Si\u2019s observations during the last couple months, his responsible and serious nature would never allow him to do such a thing. Previously, regardless of the matter they had at hand or the weather conditions, he would punctually escort her back home for her meals. If she was late for even a second, her optical computer would be flooded with his messages. It was as though he was monitoring the time all throughout the day.</p><br/><p>Thus, would someone who held the Elders\u2019 words with such importance skip out on the weekly meeting?</p><br/><p>Was there an emergency?</p><br/><p>Yao Si frowned and sent Gu Shucheng several messages before diving into her large pile of documents.</p><br/><p>At the next weekly meeting, he was still missing!</p><br/><p>Her message to him had been sent half a month ago, but it seemed to have drowned in the sea, getting lost before anyone could reply to it.</p><br/><p>There were so many unread documents in her optical computer that she was about to collapse. Yao Si made a decision. Regardless of whether Nephew Gu was in trouble or not, she was going to get him back.</p><br/><p>Now, this very instant!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy did you pull me out?\u201d Bai Yi asked as he was being dragged outside against his will.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s cause I have no idea where he stays!\u201d Why else would I bring such a chatterbox along! \u201cLuo Ying hasn\u2019t been around as well, so you\u2019re the only one I can use.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou were going to get Luo Ying?\u201d Bai Yi\u2019s eyes went wide, and his eyes roamed up and down her, an unknown emotion clouding them. \u201cYou-you\u2019re so brave!\u201d He shook his head. \u201cLet me warn you, though, you better stay away from her, or\u2026 <em>Tsk tsk tsk! </em>\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Yao Si stilled. She didn\u2019t seem to have offended her? Besides, that woman seemed like an easy going person.</p><br/><p>Bai Yi glanced at her sideways. \u201cLet me put it this way, Shucheng is Luo Ying\u2019s mentor.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMentor!\u201d Yao Si\u2019s eyes went instantly wide. \u201cGu Shucheng is Luo Ying\u2019s father?!\u201d <em>F*ck! Both father and daughter are in the same school and on the same level?!</em></p><br/><p>\u201cYea.\u201d He nodded. \u201cEven though Luo Ying is still a cub, she has already awakened her ability, so you better be careful.\u201d</p><br/><p>What did that mean? Even though it was weird that he would have a daughter at such a young age, but\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat has that got to do with me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Yi was left speechless. He turned and glared at her. \u201cAre you dumb? Do you think his cub would be happy that you\u2019re getting so close to him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy would she be upset?\u201d All he did was remind her to go back for dinner, and it wasn\u2019t even held at his home.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Bai Yi almost choked on anger. After a moment, he scoffed, \u201cForget it, didn\u2019t you want to go his house? Hurry!\u201d In large strides, he left the academy.</p><br/><p>Yao Si had on an incredulous expression as she followed behind. <em>Why is he so temperamental\u2026 Is he perhaps on his period? </em></p><br/><p>Gu Shucheng didn\u2019t live on the Red Planet. He instead stayed in a tranquil area near the school. Galaxy\u2019s advanced transportation allowed them to reach their destination in less than five minutes. The area there was indeed a prime spot. The lush greenery was well attended to, and the surroundings were peaceful. There was barely anyone on the roads, with just three well built men passing by them.</p><br/><p>Maybe due to the peaceful surroundings, they could smell a faint floral scent.</p><br/><p>Just as Yao Si was staring at the signboard, Bai Yi stopped abruptly.</p><br/><p>Yao Si almost bumped into him. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Yi focused on a corner, seemingly in deep thought. Gradually, a hint of worry clouded his relaxed expression. The knot on his temples deepened, and after a moment of hesitation, he said, \u201cYou can\u2019t\u2026 have hit the jackpot, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Yao Si stilled. Without explaining anything, Bai Yi ran fir the house in front of them.</p><br/><p>Yao Si hurriedly followed after.</p><br/><p>When they reached it, the door opened with just a light push. In the Galaxy with highly advanced security, this was definitely a red flag. What even worse was that the interior was pitch black. It looked as though it had been burnt by a humongous flame.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe three men were the ones that caught Shucheng!\u201d Bai Yi stated suddenly. \u201cMy ability is mind reading! I heard their thoughts when they passed by us. Let\u2019s go!\u201d</p>\n</div>"}

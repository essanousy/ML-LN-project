Mu Xuan, I\u2019m not you. I wasn\u2019t given that luxury. For the past million years, I have never been at peace. So how could I have slept?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter all these years\u2026 you still haven\u2019t put it behind you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo!\u201d He shook his head. \u201cAs you mentioned, a million years have passed, so how could I have not put it behind me?\u201d He lowered his head to glance at the Red Planet, his gaze cold and unfeeling. \u201cI just understood that immortality is a curse, and because of it, I have been in pain for a million years. Soon, all of them will walk down my path.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou want to wipe out the entire race?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI just want to free them from this endless life.\u201d The man\u2019s gaze turned colder as he looked at Mu Xuan while articulating his words clearly. \u201cBesides, they will feel the same way soon, just like\u2026 the me from before.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey are not you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey will soon be.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI told you\u2026\u201d Mu Xuan\u2019s face fell. \u201cI don\u2019t care what you want to do, but you cannot harm our kinsman!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHeh\u2026\u201d He smirked. \u201cIt\u2019ll depend on whether you can stop me like the last time.\u201d</p><br/><p>He raised his arm, summoning multiple fire dragons to charge at Mu Xuan who used a transparent barrier to shield himself from the attack. The next second, their figures flashed, disappearing into the fields and leaving only the sound of fighting in their wake.</p><br/><p>The camera could no longer catch their figures, showing only flashes of light in the skies. Yao Si grew more anxious with each passing moment. Even though she had utmost confidence in her ex-dad, it wasn\u2019t a fair match. Mu Xuan had to look out for the other bloodlings while engaging in mind control, and if that wasn\u2019t enough, the enemy wasn\u2019t weak either.</p><br/><p>Yao Si could already conclude that his opponent was most likely Euphoria\u2019s leader. She had assumed that his motives for forming Euphoria were to rob the bloodlings of their immortality, but it was only then that she realized that he wanted to wipe out the entire race. Based on their conversation, the BOSS against them was also a bloodling, and probably one that was within the first five generations.</p><br/><p>Yao Si was full of worry as she looked at a few screens at once, afraid to miss out on anything. Mu Xuan and the BOSS were gone, but the sounds of the fight were growing more and more intense, even affecting the people below. Many houses had started to tremble as though an earthquake was about to occur. The cities and the mountainous areas were all crumbling, rock and building fragments flying everywhere.</p><br/><p><em>Mu Xuan\u2026</em></p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Your Highness!\u201d Qu Ze had to have seen her anxiety, for he reassured her with a pat on her shoulder. \u201cEven though I can\u2019t tell his identity, but His Majesty is the only one that managed to awaken the ancestor\u2019s bloodline. Even a first generation bloodling wouldn\u2019t be his match.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si nodded. She was obviously aware of that, but\u2026 how could she not worry? Who knew if the maniac that created the doomsday virus and wanted to eliminate all the bloodlings had any other tricks up his sleeve?</p><br/><p>But she was helpless and could only focus on the camera\u2019s feed.</p><br/><p>Qu Ze was right. The BOSS was indeed no match against Mu Xuan. Even if Mu Xuan had spread his mental strength to prevent the other bloodlings from being embroiled in the mess, he wasn\u2019t in any sort of a disadvantage. Besides, the sounds of the fight started to fade away as they rose higher into the air and no longer caused a problem on the ground.</p><br/><p>The two figures started to grow smaller until they could no longer be seen. Fortunately, there was still Little Ball. It switched on the feed from outer space.</p><br/><p>As expected, the screen once again filled with various abilities. Even though the other planets weren\u2019t affected, the spaceships that were circling around them faced a disaster from which they couldn\u2019t escape alive.</p><br/><p>Yao Si sighed. Mu Xuan was indeed her ex-dad! She gave him a big thumbs up internally. From the looks of it, the Red Planet would be free of danger in no time.</p><br/><p>The fighting went on for about ten minutes before finally stopping. Mu Xuan and the Boss reappeared on the screen once more. Yao Si hurriedly inspected Mu Xuan through the feed. <em>Phew\u2026 He seems fine. Besides his messy hair, there doesn\u2019t seem to be anything wrong with him.</em></p><br/><p>The other person, on the other hand, was covered in wounds and blood. His right arm was angled oddly at the side.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs expected, I still can\u2019t defeat you!\u201d The Boss remained unfazed though; instead, he gave a mysterious smile. \u201cIt\u2019s better this way! But\u2026 do you really think I came all this way just to have a fight with you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Mu Xuan stilled, his frown deepening. What else did he want?</p><br/><p>\u201cMu Xuan, I once told you that I\u2019ll let you feel the same pain I felt.\u201d A wide smile spread across his face. It seemed to be hiding something, like an unaccomplished wish or a promise to go all out. It was full of satisfaction yet chilling to the bone, and Yao Si\u2019s heart sank.</p><br/><p>She thought of something then and said, \u201cLittle Ball, return the image back to the Red Planet!\u201d</p><br/><p>With a flash, the screens once again showed the Red Planet. Explosions could be heard from the spots in which the meteorites had fallen, and a blue fog was rising from them.</p><br/><p>Was that\u2026 the virus?</p><br/><p>\u201cQu Ze, hurry up! Inform the Elders Council! Get everyone to evacuate the Red Planet.\u201d Even though the meteorite situation had been settled, the virus filled fog still rose from within them. No one could fathom the consequences of it.</p><br/><p><em>F*ck, that bastard truly had another plan up his sleeves! Did he deliberately lure Mu Xuan out of the Red Planet?</em></p><br/><p>Mu Xuan had to have suspected the precarious situation as he turned toward the Red Planet. What was weird was that no one followed him. Instead, Li Zheng\u2019s smile deepened. The instant Mu Xuan turned his back to him, he made a slit in the air. Yao Si\u2019s heart sank as she thought that he was going to ambush Mu Xuan. But instead, the air beside him started to split open, and a black portal took shape.</p><br/><p><em>Is this space teleportation? What is he going to do?</em></p><br/><p>Before she could come to a conclusion, she felt a chill on her back as an overwhelming eerie force came rushing towards her. The big BOSS on the screen was suddenly beside her, his low voice ringing in her ears. \u201cI caught her!\u201d</p><br/><p><em>F*ck! His plan wasn\u2019t about the virus but her!</em></p><br/><p>She felt her vision darken. The last thing she saw was the opening of a portal and Mu Xuan running towards her maniacally.</p><br/><p>\u201cSisi!\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

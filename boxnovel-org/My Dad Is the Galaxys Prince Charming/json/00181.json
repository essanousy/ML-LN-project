Her frustration grew the more she looked at him. \u201cLin Long, do you have any idea what you are doing? If you dare to complete the ceremony, I will castrate\u2026 myself!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck,\u201d Lin Long snarled, his expression sinking instantly. He then threatened her, \u201cYao, if you dare touch my body, I\u2019m going to destroy you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare!\u201d Before she could respond, Mu Xuan took a step forward, shielding her behind him protectively while glaring at Lin Long coldly, his anger radiating off him in waves of cold.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck, try me!\u201d As compared to his past self which carried a single dog\u2019s aura, he was basking in confidence. He held onto Lian Yu\u2019s hand, prepared to show the entire world. \u201cHeh! What\u2019s so great about having a contractor? Who doesn\u2019t have one?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs Lian Yu really your contractor?\u201d Yao Si asked, not expecting her suspicions to be confirmed.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat-that\u2019s right!\u201d Lin Long coughed, straightening to appear pleased, but he couldn\u2019t stop the flush rushing through him.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow can that be? Haven\u2019t you guys met before?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe contractor verification method for my race differs for individuals. I only managed to verify it at the space station,\u201d he replied firmly. \u201cXiao Yu is my contractor, the one and only!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright!\u201d Yao Si inhaled deeply. It was a joyous event indeed but\u2026\u201dI don\u2019t care if you found your contractor, but why the f*ck are you trying to marry her with my body? Did you perhaps develop an addiction to being a woman after staying a man for such a long time?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho the f*ck is addicted?!\u201d Lin Long exploded instantly and took two steps forward to howl at her. \u201cDo you think i became this ghostly thing willingly?! Isn\u2019t it your f*cking fault? Appearance aside, you can\u2019t even make it in the height department! Every time I have to reach for something, I need to use a stool.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are constantly clothed in so many layers that I can\u2019t even remove them when I\u2019m hot! Your self-healing isn\u2019t satisfactory, and you get a f*cking tummy ache every month. Do you really think I\u2019d want this troublesome body?! If-f it wasn\u2019t because of Lian Yu, do you really think I would want to marry with this shell?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou should clarify it with her!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you really think I\u2019d keep her in the dark? I already told her about it, but\u2026\u201d Lin Long turned to glance at Lian Yu. Something seemed to have come to his mind, for he flushed a deeper shade of red. \u201cShe-she said that she\u2019ll like me regardless of what I become and we can be together forever as long as we get married.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck forever!\u201d Yao Si was on the verge of exploding too. Judging from Ergou\u2019s infatuated expression, he was probably blinded by love.</p><br/><p>Lian Yu remained nonchalant, not the least bit convinced by his explanation since such an absurd situation had never happened before. \u201cFollow me back to the Ability Planet, so we can change the bodies back! This instant, right now!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo! I already promised Xiao Yu that I would get married to her first thing, and a bloodling never breaks a promise to his contractor.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are using my body right now!\u201d <em>F*ck your promise, how is that any of my business? </em> \u201cIf you want to get married, do it after our bodies have swapped back. By then, you can do it a hundred times for all I care.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho wants to do it a hundred times? I only have one contractor!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo whatever you want, but first, lets change our bodies back.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m going to marry first then change back.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck, I\u2019m going to kill you!</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck, do you think I\u2019m afraid of you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si stomped over while pushing her sleeves upwards. \u201cHit me if you dare and I\u2019ll change my sex tomorrow.\u201d</p><br/><p>F*ck!</p><br/><p>Lian Yu grabbed onto Lin Long. \u201cDon\u2019t snatch my Sisi!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLian Yu\u2026\u201d Yao Si started, but Mu Xuan took a step forward to pull her back.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait!\u201d he said softly while raising his hands. An overwhelming force rushed over like a violent tsunami wave and split the gigantic fig tree into several pieces with a loud explosion.</p><br/><p>The massive tree crashed around Lin Long.</p><br/><p>Ten minutes later\u2026</p><br/><p>Lin Long was securely enclosed within the branches. Even though he didn\u2019t suffer any physical damage, his consciousness seemed badly bruised. He hugged his head wailing in pain, a stark contrast to his previous confident appearance.</p><br/><p>Mu Xuan let his power go and turned to Yao Si.\u201d You can talk now. They will listen.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si was finally enlightened: Don\u2019t restrain your in matters that can be settled with violence!</p><br/><p>She calmed down and turned to the trapped Lin long and Lian Yu who was trying to save him.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat-what are you going to do with Sisi?\u201d Lian Yu asked cautiously while trying to pull Ergou out. \u201cIf you dare harm her, I-I will fight to the end!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Yu\u2026\u201d Lin Long stopped howling, touched by her words.</p><br/><p>Goosebumps started to form on Yao Si\u2019s arms. She finally understood what people meant by saying the phrase \u2018foul smell of love\u2019.</p><br/><p>\u201cEnough, enough! He will be fine! Lian Yu, there\u2019s something that needs to be clarified.\u201d Yao Si exhaled and tapped the tree root at the side, signaling her to take a seat. She then explained the entire incident about how her body had been swapped with that of Lin Long.</p><br/><p>Lian Yu fell into a daze for five minutes before turning toward her with a glazed look. She then looked back at Lin Long who was trapped like a dumpling by the vines. Shortly after, she started to speak.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou mean that whatever she\u2026 he said before was true?\u201d Her eyes went wide, full of disbelief. \u201cHe isn\u2019t Sisi?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMmh, mmh.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d She nodded her head gravely.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou became a man?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEr\u2026 for the moment!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis-this is\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know this might be hard to understand. but it really happened.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMmh, that\u2019s right, I\u2014 What! What?!\u201d Was she hearing things now?!</p><br/><p>(\u2299_\u2299)</p><br/><p>Lian Yu tossed Er Gou\u2019s hand aside and turned to pull Yao Si into her embrace while jumping up and down in joy. \u201cThat\u2019s great, we are more suited for marriage now! Let\u2019s not wait any longer and register for our marriage, alright? Come on, I\u2019ve already filled up the registration form, so you just have to sign.\u201d</p><br/><p>She switched open her optical computer, and the alliance marriage registration form appeared before them.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Yao Si.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Mu Xuan,.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Lin Long.</p><br/><p>This reaction, wasn\u2019t it somehow not right?!</p><br/><p>\u03a3(\u00b0\u25b3\u00b0|||)\ufe34</p><br/><p>\u201cSisi, we are indeed a match made in heaven. It\u2019s great that you became a man. Now the old men in the Aves parliament won\u2019t be able to object! Isn\u2019t it just a successor? I\u2019ll give birth to a dozen, hahaha. Sisi, what do you think about having ten kids, or maybe eight? Do you like boys or girls? I\u2019ll listen to anything you say!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao-Xiao Yu\u2026\u201d Lin Long froze, looking at his empty palm in a daze.</p><br/><p>Lian Yu lowered her gaze. \u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si could hear the sound of a heart shattering.</p><br/><p>Should she say: Lian Yu was really not deserving of her queen title?</p></div>\n</div>"}

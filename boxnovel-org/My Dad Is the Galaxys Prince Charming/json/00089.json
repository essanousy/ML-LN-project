Even though if was blazing hot outside, her entire arm went down in goosebumps.</p><br/><p>Cold! Cold!</p><br/><p>In order to improve the beginners\u2019 training, there would occasionally be gifts in the third district. An encounter with the gift could effectively boost the beginner\u2019s mental strength, but that would depend on the individual. An encounter with the gift would also bring about a considerable amount of risk for the beginner, so Yao Si had never harbored much hope.</p><br/><p>Somehow though, her luck was over the charts. She was actually going to encounter the gift.</p><br/><p>The beginner guide mentioned that the gifts were all different, hence she had no idea what it consisted of. As she ventured into the cave, the temperature continued to drop, and the surroundings turned darker with each step. She was suddenly reminded of the gigantic bug in the demonic realm. Was there a beast in this cave?</p><br/><p>\u201cHehehe\u2026 Someone is here on their own accord,\u201d a sinister voice said.</p><br/><p>The voice was low, frosty. The main problem was however that Yao Si had no idea where it was coming from.</p><br/><p>She couldn\u2019t help raising her hand in greeting. \u201cHi!\u201d With a 360\u00b0 scan, all she could see was pitch darkness and all she could hear was the dripping of water.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy is it another human without spiritual energy?\u201d the voice continued, his tone filled with disgust. Just then, a figure appeared from the darkness. It wasn\u2019t tall but incredibly thin, the bone structure of his arms visible to the eye. He had on a long robe that covered his face, shielding his appearance.</p><br/><p>The instant he appeared, a nauseating rotting stench filled her senses.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello, may I\u2014\u201d She was just about to enquire about the gift when the man interrupted her.</p><br/><p>He smirked, disregarding her entirely. \u201cForget it, it\u2019ll be better without any spiritual energy, just another soul to fill me up. I guess meeting me was your own misfortune.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWait a minute!\u201d <em>What\u2019s with this situation? </em> \u201cI\u2019m\u2014\u201d <em>Here to collect the gift!</em></p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll collect your little gift.\u201d A devilish smile covered his face, and the eerily cold wind became stronger.</p><br/><p>Yao Si felt the temperature drop once more, and it was the same feeling as before in the demonic realm \u2013 multiple invisible objects seemed to be colliding with her body, trying to pull her apart.</p><br/><p>Yao Si eye went wide; she now understood the situation.</p><br/><p>He\u2026 He was from the indigenous tribes!</p><br/><p><em>F*ck!</em></p><br/><p>\u201cAh?\u201d He stilled, the surrounding wind stopping as well. \u201cYou are resistant to the Soul Devouring Wind!\u201d He started to feel excited, and his maniacally bright eyes went even wider. \u201cGreat! To think I could encounter someone with such an amazing external consciousness. I just have to suck your soul for my soul devouring flag to be fully cultivated, hahahaha!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSoul eater?\u201d What\u2019s that?</p><br/><p>Isn\u2019t this a little extreme? Where\u2019s my level up gift? This was totally not mentioned!</p><br/><p>The man lifted his hands abruptly, gesturing weirdly, and the flag that was floating in midair turned bright red all of a sudden, brightening the entire cave. An enormous suction force came out from within.</p><br/><p>Yao Si felt herself getting lighter, her awareness turning unstable, struggling within her, attempting to escape into the flag.</p><br/><p>Her heart sank, understanding the situation.</p><br/><p><em>F*ck! Is this the gift? Since my awareness cannot be exerted, they got an indigenous person to force it out? </em></p><br/><p>This method was indeed effective in allowing her to experience what it felt like to have her awareness exerted, but the main point\u2026</p><br/><p>Once her awareness was out, how was it going to go back?</p><br/><p>He was obviously an indigenous person and not a NPC of the celestials. After taking her consciousness, there was no way he was going to release it!</p><br/><p>What kind of gift is this? Yao Si face-palmed internally.</p><br/><p>Celestials\u2019 advertisements were indeed unreliable, especially since they promised many things free of charge.</p><br/><p>This was bad!</p><br/><p>Yao Si felt her insides churn. She had been too rash, entering this place all by herself. It was really bad. What could she do now?</p><br/><p>She bit down on her lip, struggling to retain her consciousness, preventing it from escaping while stumbling backwards.</p><br/><p>\u201cTrying to escape?\u201d The man smirked, sensing her movements. \u201cWith such a precious material at hand, do you think you can leave?\u201d He snapped both palms together, murmuring a chant.</p><br/><p>A bright glow struck Yao Si, and the next instant, she felt herself paralyzed, the weight of a step increasing by a few million fold.</p><br/><p>Yao Si\u2019s heart lifted, he had finally used an ability!</p><br/><p>The next moment, a familiar surge of energy erupted within her. It sent a piping hot sensation throughout her body, which was in stark contrast to the eerily cold air in the cave. The heat chased away the frost inside her, and the heaviness of her body changed into lightness and swiftness as her power gushed out.</p><br/><p>With just a step, her entire body rushed forward like an arrow, away from his restriction. Just like a flashing shadow, she glided through the cave, heading forward at full speed. She could barely be seen, until\u2026</p><br/><p>She hit a wall!</p><br/><p><em>F*ck!</em></p><br/><p>\u201cThat f*cking hurts\u2026\u201d She grabbed onto her head while kneeling onto the ground. When she touched the back of her head, there was indeed a bulge there.</p><br/><p>Why was a speed ability awakened at this time? Just because she was paralyzed at that moment, the counter to it was speed? This kind of ability was useless to bloodlings who were already blessed with physical qualities that were out of this world! The main problem was just that she wasn\u2019t familiar with it!</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are indeed someone with an ability!\u201d the man said, having frozen for a moment. \u201cLet\u2019s see where you can run to.\u201d He waved his arms once more, and this time, several black spiritual swords appeared. They all seemed to have eyes as they headed toward her.</p><br/><p>Yao Si\u2019s heart sank. With her newly gained lighting speed, she hid within the cave, her figure becoming yet another shadow.</p><br/><p>The spiritual swords continued to chase after her continuously, but all she could do was utilize the unfamiliar speed ability to change her directions, avoiding the attacks.</p><br/><p>The swords headed to the left, she escaped to the right, casually punching the man in the middle \u2013 then proceeding to hit a wall.</p><br/><p><em>Ai! Ouch\u2026 </em></p><br/><p>The swords headed to the right, she escaped forward, casually punching the man once more \u2013 then proceeding to hit a wall.</p><br/><p><em>Ai! Ouch\u2026</em></p><br/><p>The sword headed forward, she escaped backward, casually punching the man in the middle \u2013 then proceeding to hit a wall.</p><br/><p><em>Ai! Ouch\u2026</em></p><br/><p>Loud banging sounds rang in the cave for a time. After about ten minutes, multiple wounds had formed around Yao Si\u2019 head. At this rate, it was soon going to be filled with buddha-like bumps.</p><br/><p>The man was almost at his end as well. Under her relentless attacks, his plight was similar to hers; they both ended up looking like pig heads.</p><br/><p>The cave started to gain an odd sense of liveliness due to the noise of combat, and the two opponents with pig-like swollen heads glared at each other as they panted uncontrollably!</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck.\u201d <em>Pant, pant. </em> The man caressed his face as he panted continuously. \u201cHow dare you hit my face!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with hitting you?\u201d</p><br/><p><em>Pant. Pant. </em></p><br/><p><em>He is speaking as though it was an easy feat! Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch. It was so painful! Why did that pig head want to make things difficult for this pig head?</em></p><br/><p>\u201cYou-you- If I don\u2019t defeat you today, I won\u2019t be worthy of my Best Demonic Cultivator title!\u201d The man glared at Yao Si as though he\u2019d been forced to his wit\u2019s end. He raised his arm then and did a weird gesture. The red glow within the cave intensified, and with a violent swing, a huge gush of dark energy erupted from his body.</p><br/><p>Bone-chilling temperature spread through the cave, and cold wind swept toward Yao Si. It also became even harder to see in the already dark cave.</p><br/><p>Was this\u2026 going to be a strong move?!</p><br/><p>Yao Si\u2019s heart sank. Even though she wasn\u2019t sure what the black air was, it was definitely something bad. She instinctively turned to run; she had to escape! Without wasting a moment, she turned around and bolted.</p><br/><p>Just then\u2026 she smashed right into something that felt soft against her face, and her entire consciousness seemed to have been caught.</p><br/><p>A spiritual light flashed, and she understood what had happened \u2013 she had smashed right onto the Soul Eating flag!</p><br/><p><em>F*ck!</em></p><br/><p>She had actually headed right into the flag all by herself!</p><br/><p>(\u256f\u2035\u25a1\u2032)\u256f\ufe35\u253b\u2501\u253b</p><br/><p>A certain someone who had prepared for his finishing blow was left speechless.</p><br/><p>And so was Yao Si.</p><br/><p><em>F*ck this speed ability! </em></p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>After half a minute\u2026</p><br/><p>The man in the cave summoned the Soul Eating flag with mixed feelings. His tone of his words was a mix between joy and perplexity. \u201cHeh, serves you right for going through this calamity, but your initiative indeed saved me some energy.\u201d</p><br/><p>He kept his dark energy, returning the cave back to its original brightness. He then glanced at the ground suspiciously as though trying to find something. After a while, he frowned. \u201cWhere\u2019s the corpse?\u201d Did the body perhaps get sucked into the Soul Eating flag together with the soul? His Soul Eating ability must have risen to another level. At that thought, his face brightened with joy, and with a badly bruised face, he returned to the depths of the cave with his flag.</p><br/><p>Outside the cave\u2026</p><br/><p>Gu Shucheng glanced down at the time, counting the minutes silently.</p><br/><p>It was currently five hours, twenty-seven minutes, thirty-six\u2026 thirty-five\u2026 thirty-four seconds\u2026 from Her Highness\u2019 dinner time.</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>Yao Si felt her body become light, as though all her weight had disappeared. It was just as how she\u2019d felt when she had first entered the Galactic Web. She could distinctively sense her awareness leaving her body, barely feeling its presence, yet she could still sense everything around her.</p><br/><p>It looked like a fog was floating towards her\u2026 Was it made up of\u2026 humans?</p><br/><p>Her heart clenched, and her eyes went wide. Was she all right?</p><br/><p>\u201cHeh, you\u2019re awake!\u201d a mocking voice asked with a scoff. \u201cAnother one is here.\u201d</p><br/><p>A white ball of fog suddenly appeared before her, floating around like a cloud.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat-what are you?\u201d Yao Si jumped backwards in shock, but just as she was about to lift her hand, she felt a layer of fog around her. Instinctively, she lowered her head and discovered another ball of white fog. \u201cWhat the f*ck!\u201d</p><br/><p><em>Flips table! </em></p><br/><p><em>Where\u2019s my body? Why is it just fog below me?</em></p>\n</div>"}

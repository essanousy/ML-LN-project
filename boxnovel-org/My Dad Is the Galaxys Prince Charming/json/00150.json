With a height advantage, she pressed Yao Si deeply into her bosom.</p><br/><p>Before Yao Si could react, her body weakened. She couldn\u2019t breathe\u2026</p><br/><p>Save\u2026 me!</p><br/><p>At the crucial moment, her dependable nanny dad came forward to forcefully tear her away from the queen, allowing air to enter her lungs once more. Yao Si took in a long deep breath; women with big bosom were sure freaky.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d The queen flew into a rage, glaring at Mu Xuan. \u201cWhy did you separate me from dearest?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d <em>Who is your dearest? It hasn\u2019t been five minutes since we met! </em></p><br/><p>Mu Xuan\u2019s face sank, his brows deeply furrowed as he spat, \u201cShe is mine!\u201d She was HIS cub.</p><br/><p>The queen froze, her expression as though she had just received devastating news. Her entire body swayed as she trembled, and even her wings paled. She seemed in great agony as her eyes reddened with unshed tears. Her pitiful, shattered expression was quite sympathetic\u2026</p><br/><p>After half a minute, she turned an accusatory glare at Yao Si. \u201cDearest, you\u2026 you\u2026 I love you so much, how could you\u2026 how could you\u2026\u201d Before she could even finish her sentence, huge droplets started to stream down her face.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026 don\u2019t cry!\u201d Yao Si was instantly engulfed with guilt. She instinctively inched forward, prepared to comfort her.</p><br/><p>\u201cSisi!\u201d Mu Xuan tightened his grip around her, pulling her back.</p><br/><p>Yao Si took a moment to regain her senses.</p><br/><p><em>Wait a minute!</em></p><br/><p>Why was she even guilty? She barely knew that woman! As expected, those with good looks always got the easy way out.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Majesty, you must have mistaken me for someone else?\u201d Yao Si inhaled, struggling to disregard her devastated look before adding calmly, \u201cI don\u2019t even know you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m called Lian Yu!\u201d the queen said hurriedly.</p><br/><p><em>Er\u2026 I\u2019m sure this isn\u2019t just about a name?</em></p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re called Sisi, right?\u201d She inched closer, love and admiration apparent in her gaze. \u201cLian Yu\u2026 Sisi, doesn\u2019t it sound like a couple!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d <em>How does it sound like a couple! Stop forcing such a pairing! </em></p><br/><p>\u201cDearest, why don\u2019t you return to the feather folk with me? Don\u2019t be swayed by the stray flowers out there, I\u2019m your true love.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Stray flower Mu Xuan.</p><br/><p>Yao Si\u2019s lips twitched, and she said slowly, emphasizing each syllable, \u201cI am a woman!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind!\u201d Lian Yu continued to gaze at her without blinking.</p><br/><p><em>But I mind!</em></p><br/><p><em>F*ck! What is going on, how did the queen fall for me?! </em></p><br/><p>\u201cFrom the moment I set my eyes on you, I was sure that you are the one I\u2019ll spend the rest of my life with. Sisi, come home with me!\u201d the queen confessed bashfully.</p><br/><p><em>Wait a minute!</em></p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you capture me for my ability just now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat was awhile back, I don\u2019t need it anymore!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d <em>How could you be so fickle! </em></p><br/><p>\u201cPreviously\u2026 I sought you out for your ability. Since I\u2019m the last feather royal of the feather folk, I\u2019m afraid that there will no longer be any pure blooded royals in our family. I heard that you have the ability to impregnate someone so I\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>She raised her palms to shield her embarrassment, her face blazing a fiery shade of red. \u201cBut I never expected\u2026 you to be so amazing! So I decided\u2026 I don\u2019t need any pure blooded royals. Sisi, let\u2019s get married! Let me\u2026 bear you kids!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d <em>Shouldn\u2019t a queen be resolute and responsible? How could you be so fickle and reckless! Are your people even aware of what you\u2019re thinking?!</em></p><br/><p>\u201cEnough!\u201d Mu Xuan was grim. He glared at the queen coldly as though he was at his last straw. \u201cGet lost.\u201d</p><br/><p>With a wave of his hand, a flash of light flew over. The queen stumbled backward while Mu Xuan held onto Yao Si, and the next moment they were back on the aircraft.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou guys are back!\u201d Lu Chen exclaimed, bolting upwards.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, the aircraft shook. Above them, the gigantic lotus aircraft had split into two and was floating toward them.</p><br/><p>It\u2026 split apart?</p><br/><p><em>Er, nanny dad.. is that angry?</em></p><br/><p>\u201cThis\u2026 What happened?\u201d Lu Chen looked on in disbelief. \u201cThe flower of the heavenly tree, how\u2026\u201d <em>Isn\u2019t it the most advanced aircraft in the Galaxy?</em></p><br/><p>\u201cMy aircraft!\u201d Lu Chen was still in a daze when a screen suddenly popped up. The queen\u2019s enraged expression filled the screen, and she glanced around before focusing on Mu Xuan. \u201cYou despicable bastard, you dare destroy my aircraft! Return Sisi back to me now!\u201d she screamed before sending a tender and pitiful look to Yao Si. \u201cSisi, are you really going to leave me? I entrusted you with my heart, so how could you believe him? All men are bad!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d <em>I didn\u2019t abandon you! </em></p><br/><p>\u201cStart the aircraft!\u201d Mu Xuan disregarded the woman entirely, directing a chilling glare at Lu Chen.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh? Ah! Alright!\u201d Lu Chen trembled from his intense gaze and started the aircraft almost instinctively. He had no idea how the situation had become like that.</p><br/><p>\u201cStop! Where are you bringing my Sisi?\u201d the queen screamed frantically. \u201cYou can\u2019t leave! Did you hear me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEnter the galactic portal, we\u2019re heading to the next realm,\u201d Mu Xuan instructed.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh?!\u201d Lu Chen stilled. Didn\u2019t they want to explore the main planets of the various races? Why were they leaving so abruptly? However, he kept silent after catching sight of Mu Xuan\u2019s intimidating aura. It seemed as though any resistance would send him to his grave!</p><br/><p>\u201cYou..\u201d The queen started to panic at Mu Xuan\u2019s disregard, and she turned toward Lu Chen. \u201cDoes the Yao really want to go against my people?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis\u2026 this\u2026\u201d Lu Chen trembled and accidentally hit a wrong button. How did it escalate into a race issue? He wasn\u2019t ready to bear such consequences!</p><br/><p>Sensing him wavering, Lian Yu added, \u201cOpen the portal for your aircraft now and I won\u2019t pursue the destruction of my aircraft\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Before she could even finish her sentence, Mu Xuan lifted his hand. Once again, a ray of light flashed, and the aircrat that had split into two was dissected into countless tiny pieces, it\u2019s original appearance no longer visible.</p><br/><p>Mu Xuan\u2019s expression darkened. \u201cWe\u2019re the Yao, but bloodlings!\u201d <em>You can declare war if you dare!</em></p><br/><p>Without waiting for her reaction, he tapped on the screen. With another flash of light, the aircraft entered the portal. Far in the distance, a faint infuriated cry could be heard.</p><br/><p>Half a minute later, Lu Chen spoke up. \u201cBoss, can I use a month\u2019s salary to ask what happened just now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 I\u2019ll give you three months of your salary to shut you up!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p><em>Employee has a grievance, but employee dare not complain! </em></p></div>\n</div>"}

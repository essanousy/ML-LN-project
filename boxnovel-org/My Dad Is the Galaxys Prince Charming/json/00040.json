The flower pot fell from Lao San\u2019s grip, shattering into pieces. A shard scratched his feet, forming a cut, and then he finally reacted.</p><br/><p>\u201cBlood- Blood- Bloodling!\u201d Lao San legs weakened, and he felt on the verge of collapsing.</p><br/><p>\u201cRun!\u201d the man in the middle shouted out all of a sudden, pulling Lao San upwards and running towards the door at lighting speed.</p><br/><p>Yao Si nodded in approval, that man was sure acting as their boss \u2014 Too bad he smashed right into the door!</p><br/><p>They seemed to have grown complacent from their previous easy successes and forgot that they had shut the door after entering. They hit it now extremely hard.</p><br/><p>From the resounding thud, even Yao Si couldn\u2019t help wincing on their behalf.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou guys\u2026\u201d She was about to tell them that there was no escape since Yao Qian was already on his way, but a sound interrupted her.</p><br/><p>Lao San burst into tears, his body shivering as he held onto the other two with a death grip. \u201cLao- Lao- Lao- Da!\u201d</p><br/><p>Even Lao Er, who had decoded the security code awhile ago, was in a daze, his eyes so wide they seemed on the verge of bulging out. He stared straight at her, his face clouded with horror as he held onto the interface of the lock, trembling.</p><br/><p>Yao Si was starting to have questions about her appearance, was she really this horrifying? But she just wanted to reason things out with them!</p><br/><p>At this moment, the man called Lao Da still maintained a sound mind. Ignoring his wounded head, he took hold of the other two burglars and instructed them, \u201d Let\u2019s go!\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly a weird sensation flooded him\u2014it was an invisible force that wrapped the three of them, pulling them inwards. The space outside the door started to distort, and a whirlpool appeared in front of them, sucking them in.</p><br/><p>The three of them then disappeared.</p><br/><p>Was this.. a space controlling ability?</p><br/><p>He actually possessed a space summoning ability, was that how they were able to enter the Red Planet so easily\u2026 But Yao Si didn\u2019t waste time pondering and instead focused on how to capture them. In that instant, she felt an unknown strength filling her up.</p><br/><p>This was the same feeling she had felt when she first activated her ability.</p><br/><p><em>My ability is back </em>!</p><br/><p>Yao Si was exuberant, and she couldn\u2019t help raising her arms to test it out as a wave of energy flowed into her. She was expecting a water ball to appear, so she positioned herself in the direction of the window.</p><br/><p>In the end, a black portal about four to five meters high took shape, and the next moment there was a loud thud.</p><br/><p>Three familiar figures had fallen to the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck, that scared me.\u201d Lao Si caressed his sore bottom as he muttered, \u201cHow could we have bumped into a bloodling, thankfully Lao Da has the space ability\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHi~\u201d Yao Si waved toward the three man. \u201cWe meet again.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Lao San.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Lao Er.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Lao Da.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Yao Si was confused. <em>Alright, it seems\u2026 maybe\u2026 my ability changed from the water series to the space series?</em></p><br/><p>After a moment\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cAh! Ghost!\u201d A sharp wail pierced the air.</p><br/><p>\u201cLao Da!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRun!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d Lao Da shouted once more, using his ability again, and a dark portal appeared once more, teleporting the three of them away.</p><br/><p>The very next moment, with a loud thud, the three of them landed in the right corner of the house.</p><br/><p>\u201cAhhh!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d</p><br/><p>Again, for the third time\u2026 Left corner.</p><br/><p>The fourth time\u2026 By the kitchen door.</p><br/><p>The fifth time\u2026 The study room door.</p><br/><p>The sixth time\u2026 The toilet door.</p><br/><p>The seventh time\u2026</p><br/><p>Yao Si took a deep breath. She couldn\u2019t help heading toward a certain Lao Da, who was as pale as a sheet and was panting uncontrollably as though he was about to stop breathing the next moment. \u201cHey\u2026 You tired?\u201d</p><br/><p>The three of them just stared at her.</p><br/><p>The house sank into silence.</p><br/><p>The next moment, the three despairing figures collapsed onto their knees and lifted their heads up.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Highness, we have sinned! We will repent, please forgive us!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, you\u2019re so powerful, it was our mistake to ever dare offend you. Your Highness, please forgive us, just treat us as air.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, regardless of what you do, please spare our worthless lives!\u201d</p><br/><p>If this continued, Lao Da\u2019s ability was going to be ruined, so the next instant three thuds sounded as their foreheads hit the floor once more.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Highness, are you\u2026.\u201d Yao Qian had rushed over hurriedly, but when he reached Yao Si\u2019s home, all he saw was three people kowtowing to her highness. He wanted to ask what had happened but the question got stuck in his throat.</p><br/><p><em>What\u2019s going on here?</em></p><br/><p>\u201cYour\u2026 Your highness?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t ask me, I know nothing.\u201d Yao Si covered her face. She really had no idea what she had been doing just now\u2026 Was that really her ability? Space control? But why was others\u2019 able to send people to far distances, even to other planets, but hers could only bring them in front of her!</p><br/><p>What a weird ability; she was now confused and upset!</p><br/><p>Her Highness seemed to be upset, so Yao Qian didn\u2019t ask any more. He tapped on his optical computer, and a couple glowing chains fell out, arresting the three of burglars.</p><br/><p>Yao Si stared at the three of them with mixed feelings: They had actually dared to enter the king\u2019s, Mu Xuan\u2019s, imperial palace to commit burglary. Should she be applauding them for their courage, or shaking her head at their stupidity?</p><br/><p>\u201cI shall not disrupt Your Highness\u2019 rest any more. Would you like me to send the three of them to the police?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Qian tugged onto the three obedient people toward the door, but when he reached it, he stopped once more. \u201d Oh right, Your Highness, you mentioned that they were petty burglars, where\u2019s their loot?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEr, this, I\u2019m not\u2026\u201d Before she finished her sentence, a thought struck her. She waved her hand, and a white gleam shone. Her personal safety space burst open, and just like an endless stream, a bunch of objects poured out into the living room.</p><br/><p>The big items included antique furniture while the tiny ones went as small as crystal accessories, but one thing that united them was that they were all priceless.</p><br/><p><em>Hmph! There\u2019s no need to find anymore, everything here is their loot.</em></p><br/><p>The three burglars trembled uncontrollably.</p><br/><p><em>Mama, these bloodlings are scary!</em></p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>Yao Si was convinced that she had awaken two abilities: a water series one and a space series one. But both of them seemed to be a little unique, the space one being especially so. Yet ever since that night, it disappeared just like her water ability. Was her ability really a one use only?</p><br/><p>It was indeed a depressing answer. Thankfully, Mu Xuan, who had disappeared for a long time, finally came back.</p>\n</div>"}

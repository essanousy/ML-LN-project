After some thought, she added, \u201cI will pay you back when I have the money.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSilly child, don\u2019t say such a thing.\u201d He smiled in delight and explained, \u201cThis was purchased with your money, how does it have anything to do with Uncle Yan?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMine?\u201d Yao Si was confused. No way, Earth was gone, how could she have any money? Besides, RMB probably didn\u2019t circulate here.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is part of the psychological damage compensation that the Lu family wired to your account a few days ago.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Lu family?\u201d The corner of Yao Si\u2019s mouth twitched. \u201cIs it\u2026 Commander Lu?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Xuan nodded. \u201cThe Lu family guards many energy-mining planets, they can be counted as one of the wealthiest magnates in the galaxy. Since they insist on giving you half of their properties to apologize, then my baby you should accept it no matter how difficult it is.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Awkward  <sup>1</sup> \u2026 Do you really have to make looting a burning house sound so impressive?</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, by the way, uncle has already deducted your accommodation and living expenses from your account, my baby,\u201d he said cheerily. \u201cThis way when we find your sire, it will save everyone the trouble of sending him the bills.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Give me back my affections, *sshole!</p><br/><p>No wonder he was a high official of bloodlings! The longest road that she had ever traveled on was definitely his path of trickery.</p><br/><p>______</p><br/><p>Yan Xuan didn\u2019t stay for too long, he gave principal Yu some instructions then left in a hurry.</p><br/><p>Principal Yu didn\u2019t immediately take Yao Si to the classroom but to a place that resembled a garden. Inside the garden were a few people who stood or played around in groups of twos or threes. They appeared to be of different ages: some were young people like her, others looked forty or fifty like the principal, there was even one who was hoary-headed.</p><br/><p>The principal suddenly clapped her hands and announced loudly, \u201cCome over here, my babies, I\u2019m going to introduce you to a new classmate!\u201d Everyone fell silent. Seven or eight pairs of eyes all looked over at her in unison right then.</p><br/><p>WTH?</p><br/><p>Classmates?</p><br/><p>These people!</p><br/><p>The scarred and battered common sense that Yao Si owned suddenly fell to pieces with a crash.</p><br/><p>She was dumbstruck and didn\u2019t even notice the principal Yu leaving. When she came back to her senses, she was already surrounded by a bunch of \u2013 very large kids.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re the new baby?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t even look cute, I\u2019m the prettiest baby.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNew baby, what blood do you like to drink? I like the blood of the starry sky beast.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI like the blood from the beast of the alien planets.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph, you all don\u2019t know a thing, the most delicious is the peeping beast.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLiar, you can\u2019t drink peepie\u2019s blood.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCan!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCan\u2019t, my daddy said you can\u2019t\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI said you can, so you can. Humph, I\u2019m not playing with you anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph, I\u2019m not going to play with a liar either!\u201d</p><br/><p>All of them joined in, and in the end, they even had an argument. Their attention was no longer on her and they began to disperse in twos and threes again, but that conversation\u2026 Wasn\u2019t it somewhat odd? It was as if they were really kindergarten children.</p><br/><p>She examined them carefully. These \u201cbabies\u201d looked bigger than real ones, and she was left confused as hell.</p><br/><p>Then she at once recalled Yan Xuan\u2019s words. He\u2019d said that newborn bloodlings were all clones that initially had genetic memories which as time passed would eventually fade away and be forgotten. Was it because the clones\u2019 intelligence quotient was also completely erased, that\u2019s why they had to study from kindergarten?</p><br/><p>Then how did one explain the disparaging age gaps? Was it because the Blue Planet genes that were found were all different?</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, you have the newest model of optical computer.\u201d</p><br/><p>A big kid suddenly pressed near her. Because he had dashed over, he almost bumped right into her face. Yao Si had backed away just in time.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s so cool.\u201d This big buddy was obviously over-nourished, the fat on his face was almost bulging out, and he had really become round like a ball. His eyes gleamed as he stared at her optical computer. With a face full of envy he puckered his lips, and like a born conversationalist he said, \u201cI asked mom many times and she didn\u2019t buy it for me. Your daddy is so nice to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mom? Looks like his sire was a female bloodling.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey hey hey, new baby.\u201d He extended his arms and pushed her, but his eyes were still glued to her optical computer. \u201cWant to be friends?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause you have the new optical computer,\u201d he answered like it was a matter of fact, not even slightly embarrassed.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d The children\u2019s words are certainly straightforward.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, new baby!\u201d He shoved her. \u201cIf we become friends, can you lend me your optical computer for me to play games on?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUhmmm\u2026 Probably!\u201d</p><br/><p>Fair enough, this was a baby who was into games. Just as she thought, no matter what age they were in, fat otaku always had an inseparable connection with electronic games.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great.\u201d The fat classmate clapped his hands. \u201cThen from now on we are friends, my name is Zhu Hang! Everyone calls me Baby Zhu, what\u2019s your name?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu <sup>2</sup> \u2026Baby.</p><br/><p>The corner of Yao Si\u2019s mouth throbbed. Looking at the proud fatty, she thought, <em>\u2018My friend, you will cry in the future!\u2019 </em></p><br/><p>\u256e(\u256f\ufe4f\u2570\uff09\u256d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy name is Yao Si.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYao\u2026Shi\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p><em>If you dare make the sound of the word \u201cpoo\u201d <sup>3</sup> , I will whip your ass!</em></p><br/><p>\u2192 . \u2192</p><br/><p>Fatty tried for a while and appeared to come to a conclusion that two words was way too hard to pronounce, so he gave up without any reservedness. He then suggested with a face of excitement, \u201cNew baby, want to grind your teeth with me?\u201d</p><br/><p>What the hell was grinding teeth together? Was that a new game that was trending among kids from the future?</p><br/><p>Fatty didn\u2019t show any signs of waiting for her response. He straightaway pulled down a green button-like thing from his collar and pressed it with force. Suddenly, a palm-sized hole appeared on the empty space on the ground.</p><br/><p>This\u2026 This was surely the dimensional button of the legends, future technology was so amazing.</p><br/><p>Fatty immediately extended his hand inside it and began to fumble around. Few moments later he revealed two identical objects and extended one to Yao Si. \u201cHere, my mom bought these for me, they\u2019re in my favorite color.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si looked at the round-ended long white object in his hand and the corner of her mouth began to jerk.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p><em>Who wants to chew bones with you! </em> *Smash* (\u256f\u2035\u25a1\u2032)\u256f\ufe35\u2534\u2500\u2534</p><br/><p>So the teeth grinding he mentioned was literally it!</p><br/><p>\u201cHere here!\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing that she didn\u2019t take the bone, Fatty extended it towards her again.</p><br/><p>Yao Si looked at that piece of bone which still had the remnants of his teeth marks and saliva, and she felt an uneasy awkwardness. \u201cNo\u2026 No thanks.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t.\u201d Fatty pouted with disapproval. \u201cMom said that a good baby must grind their teeth everyday, otherwise their teeth will grow into the meat,\u201d he said as he pointed at the fangs in his mouth.</p><br/><p>Yao Si felt that her entire person was unwell, wasn\u2019t the fangs of bloodlings retractable? Since when did you need to rely on teeth grinding, though the main problem was that he\u2019d picked a bone. They were vampires, not dogs!</p><br/><p>\u201cI tell you, this is my favorite stick. Mom bought it specially for me, it feels really comfortable when you grind your teeth on it,\u201d Fatty continued to persuade her.</p><br/><p>Stick\u2026 Was it really appropriate to call it by such a dirty name?</p><br/><p>\u201cCan I not grind?\u201d Yao Si took a step back.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t grind then you are not a good baby.\u201d Fatty had became impatient. He persistently shoved the bone in his hands to her. \u201cTry it, try it, it\u2019s really easy! Really, if I lie to you then I\u2019m a dog,\u201d he said as he demonstrated, shoving the bone inside his mouth and intentionally taking a bite with an \u201carhwooo\u201d.</p><br/><p>At that moment, the dripping saliva was like a waterfall, flowing like poems had described: \u201cStraight down three thousand feet, the white spraying torrent does run <sup>4</sup> \u201c, \u201d How could heroes not wet their sleeves with tear on tear!\u201d <sup>5</sup></p><br/><p>Yao Si felt the veins on her forehead pop, and her hands unconsciously clenched tightly.</p><br/><p>With a crack, she had snapped straight in two the bone that Fatty had forcibly given to her.</p><br/><p>Fatty was stupefied, his entire fat face was filled with confusion. The bone was still in his mouth and the saliva was still dripping. His eyes slowly moved to the broken bone in her hand, and in that moment a large amount of water vapor clouded his crack-like eyes, his lips pouted, his nose snuffed\u2026</p><br/><p>Hold on! You\u2019re not going to\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cWahhhhhhhhh\u2026 My stick\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>A loud wail pierced the air, heading straight above the clouds and destroying any peacefulness.</p><br/><p>Uhhhh\u2026 She might be in trouble.</p>\n</div>"}

I get it, I get it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nephew Gu exhaled deeply as though he had unloaded a heavyweight off his chest.</p><br/><p>Yao Si\u2019s lips twitched. <em>That\u2019s going too far, why can\u2019t he forget that matter! It\u2019s decided, salary retracted!</em></p><br/><p>\u201cOh right, aren\u2019t you waiting till the end of the semester before you graduate?\u201d Yao Si glanced at the various forms they were holding. \u201cWhy are you here now?\u201d Shouldn\u2019t they bid their farewell at the end of the semester?</p><br/><p>They glanced at each other. \u201cGraduation classes aren\u2019t held within the academy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot within the academy?\u201d Yao Si stilled. Did the Galaxy also have graduation internships?</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, for those with abilities, graduation classes are held in other planets. We chose Nirvana,\u201d Nephew Gu explained.</p><br/><p><em>Nirvana? That sounds familiar. Where did I hear it before?</em></p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s about time, let\u2019s head out.\u201d Nephew Gu glanced at the time on his optical computer. \u201cYour Highness, we have to go.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, bon voyage!\u201d Yao Si waved, staying till the couple entered the aircraft and flew off into the distance.</p><br/><p>Eh, when was she going to graduate? She was suddenly reminded of the red marks on her report card\u2026</p><br/><p>It definitely wasn\u2019t because she hadn\u2019t put in the effort, but because she had been occupied. That was right, it was all Euphoria\u2019s fault; it thoroughly murdered her passionate desire to learn. What a malicious organization!</p><br/><p>Just as Yao Si entered the academy, Bai Yi came running from the back, glancing around frantically. \u201d Your Highness, did you see Gu Shucheng?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI saw him, he left!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck!\u201d Bai Yi\u2019s face darkened, his mood dimming. \u201cThat bastard just threw the vice president job to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Eh? He had no clue?</p><br/><p>\u201cThe three of us promised to graduate together, so how could he just run away with Luo Ying!\u201d Bai Yi started to fume. \u201cHeh, what\u2019s so good about having a cub! In the past, they kept flaunting their love, and now they just thoroughly abandoned me. This can\u2019t happen. I need to chase after them. I will not let them live so peacefully.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d <em>Hey, hey, hey! Isn\u2019t your resentment going a little overboard?</em></p><br/><p>\u201cYour Highness, do you know to which planet they are heading for their graduation classes?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s\u2026 Nirvana?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Yi immediately opened his optical computer to check for the flight details.</p><br/><p><em>You\u2019re really going after him?! Is Nephew Gu your true love?</em></p><br/><p>Bai Yi glanced at the screen, where there was only one flight with a single red word beside it\u2014Left.</p><br/><p>His soul seemed to fly away at that moment, leaving his body an empty shell.</p><br/><p>\u201cForget it! Forget it!\u201d Yao Si gave a comforting pat on his shoulder. \u201d You\u2019ll get your own cub one day!\u201d <em>Here\u2019s to hoping you leave your bachelor status soon.</em></p><br/><p>\u201cYour Highness\u2026\u201d he cried indignantly.</p><br/><p>\u201cBesides, there is only one flight to Nirvana each month.\u201d Nephew Gu must have chosen that planet precisely for that reason. \u201cNow that the aircraft has left, you won\u2019t be able to chase after them. You can\u2019t just find a random aircraft to bring you over\u2014\u201d</p><br/><p><em>Buzz.</em></p><br/><p>Before she could finish her sentence, a sudden white glow surrounded her. Her body started to feel lighter, and the next moment, she disappeared. Yao Si saw the sight in front of her change, and then was faced with a metal room.</p><br/><p>An excited voice reached her ears.</p><br/><p>\u201cBoss, I caught them! I caught it! No one saw me, I\u2019m going to be rich!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShut it, we have to hurry to Nirvana!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Yao Si</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Bai Yi</p><br/><p>F*ck her jinx mouth!</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>For the first time in her life, Yao Si was kidnapped! She didn\u2019t feel much variation in her emotions; there was even an impulse to do her school work. But the trio outside already started to fantasize about their future.</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter this kidnapping, I\u2019ll definitely head over to Heaven for a few months!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWith that money, you\u2019ll be able to stay there permanently, not to mention a few months!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI doubt so, Heaven is such an expensive planet!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s there to worry about? With these two, we will be able to obtain the 200 000. Heaven aside, we will even be able to enter the Alliance\u2019s main planet!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHahahaha, that\u2019s right. I really wish there were more such easy money-making tasks like this!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs 200,000 considered a lot?\u201d Yao Si couldn\u2019t help interrupting. From what she remembered, student committee\u2019s semester pay was around that amount. She had always assumed that the amount was due to inflation.</p><br/><p>Since the academy was student-operated, every member of the committee received a salary.</p><br/><p>\u201cObviously!\u201d The three rolled their eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s an amount that ordinary people will never earn\u2026\u201d He stopped, finally realizing their sudden appearance. \u201cYou-you\u2026 Where did you come from?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere!\u201d Yao Si pointed toward the open cell door. The person beside her was a highly experienced hacker, so how could they be kept in captivity?</p><br/><p>The three stilled, then pulled out their knives frantically. \u201cDon\u2019t\u2026 Don\u2019t move! Hurry and return to the cell or we won\u2019t be kind.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha\u2026\u201d Yao Si laughed. \u201cWhat a coincidence, I don\u2019t intend to be kind either! Bai Yi I\u2019ll hand it to you.\u201d It was time to vent his frustration!</p><br/><p><em>Pikachu, I choose you!</em></p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Your Highness!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si had enough knowledge of bloodlings to be confident that they could deal with the three even without using any abilities, but she never expected it to be that quick\u2026</p><br/><p>After three minutes\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, we were wrong, we are aware of our mistakes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes master, please forgive us. Anymore and we\u2019ll be disfigured\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, could you pardon us? It\u2019s our first crime!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe had no idea our victims would be S ranked. If we had known earlier, we would have never dared to do it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, you should seek out the real mastermind. We were just forced into it\u2026 Please forgive us\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si looked at the three who were kneeling in tears after getting beaten by Bai Yi. Her lips twitched. Wasn\u2019t it a bit too fast? Where was their kidnapper dignity? Did they spend all their time on talking? Did they not graduate from kidnappers\u2019 academy? Even their begging pleas seemed trained and eloquent.</p><br/><p>Yao Si massaged her temples, then took a deep breath. \u201cSpeak! What exactly happened? What were your intentions? Why did you kidnap us?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, this has nothing to do with us.\u201d The thin and tall leader lifted his swollen face. Inhaling, he stuttered, \u201cIt\u2019s-it\u2019s someone on Nirvana\u2026 He offered a high price to kidnap you\u2026 No, to invite you back.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNirvana?\u201d Yao Si stilled. She didn\u2019t seem to have visited that planet? \u201cWho is that person?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2026 We aren\u2019t sure of his identity.\u201d The person then quickly added, \u201cThe other party sent us a video message, instructing us to bring you to Nirvana unharmed.\u201d He switched on his optical computer, and indeed, a 3D version of her image popped up. \u201cIn order to aid our operation, he\u2026 helped to modify our aircraft, so you could enter the aircraft without any of the Galactic detectors being activated.\u201d</p><br/><p>That explained why no one had gone after her even though she had been gone for quite awhile. She eyed them suspiciously. \u201cYou guys\u2026 don\u2019t know who I am?\u201d</p><br/><p>They glanced at each other before shaking their heads in unison.</p><br/><p>That was indeed a surprise. After her video was publicized, her identity as Mu Xuan\u2019s cub had spread throughout the entire Galaxy. Even the dumbest kidnappers knew not to kidnap a fifth-generation bloodling. Thus, she had assumed that they belonged to Euphoria, but their words revealed to her that they were just clueless.</p><br/><p>But\u2026 who exactly had gotten these three ignorant people to kidnap her?</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care what you want, turn the aircraft back!\u201d Regardless of who the person was, it was best for her to return due to her current dangerous circumstances. Curiosity killed the cat, and she was determined not to get herself killed.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, this\u2026 this\u2026\u201d Their faces paled. \u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 not possible.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d Yao Si stood up.</p><br/><p>They shrank in fear. \u201cMaster, the aircraft has a specialized route installed, so until we arrive at our destination, we-we won\u2019t be able to change it\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Yi\u2019s face darkened, and he turned toward the control table. After playing with it for a while, he looked over at her in disappointment. \u201cYour Highness, they aren\u2019t lying! It isn\u2019t possible to change the route.\u201d</p><br/><p>She opened her optical computer, preparing to contact Mu Xuan only to realize that there wasn\u2019t any reception. A message popped up: Unable to connect.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe aircraft has a firewall installed to block all transmissions. I\u2019m not able to connect to the galactic web,\u201d Bai Yi added.</p><br/><p><em>F*ck! </em>How could she have met with such a misfortune?</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t break through the firewall?\u201d It seemed like an experienced hacker was needed for such a task. \u201cWe can just head over to Nirvana.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, we can, but\u2026\u201d\u2014he pointed toward the front\u2014\u201dwe\u2019re already here.\u201d</p><br/><p><em>What?</em></p><br/><p>Yao Si turned. At some point,, they had passed through the space portal into a gigantic green planet. The aircraft descended gradually to the ground.</p><br/><p>In less than two minutes, it landed on a grass patch, and the gates on the right opened with a loud noise.</p><br/><p>Ech, the inevitable had happened.</p><br/><p>Yao Si exchanged a glance with Bai Yi before they headed toward the gates. Outside was a vast grass field whose end could not be seen. There wasn\u2019t a single sign of Galactic technology anywhere around them. Yao Si started to believe the kidnappers\u2019 words. Why did the mastermind choose such a spot? Who exactly was he?</p><br/><p>While she was in deep thought, a figure dashed over. Before she had time to react, the person pounced on her.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Highness, long time no see! I\u2019ve missed you so much. Days without you feel so empty, lonely, and cold!\u201d A familiar figure stuck to her like a plaster, pressing her head into his embrace, caressing it haphazardly, messing her hair up. \u201cAren\u2019t you surprised to see me? Did you miss me? I\u2019ve missed you all this while!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si felt her face stiffen. Veins on her temples throbbed violently, threatening to explode. She took a deep calming breath, pushing the frustration down before ripping herself away from him and punching his smiling face.</p><br/><p>\u201cQu! Ze!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p></div>\n</div>"}

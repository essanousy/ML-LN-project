She used to sleep like a brick, so even roaring thunder couldn\u2019t affect her slumber. But oddly enough, she couldn\u2019t seem to fall asleep for the last couple days, and what was even more strange was that she felt energetic and in good spirits despite the sleepless nights.</p><br/><p>Her back was no longer sore, her legs weren\u2019t weak, and even menstruation which had been bothering her for years ceased to visit her. She could climb ten flights of stairs effortlessly in one breath.</p><br/><p>Her diet was even more magical. She used to love chili pepper all her life, but now her stomach got cramps at the sight of their bright red color.</p><br/><p>Initially, she thought it was just weakness in the stomach and spleen induced by her insomnia, but as time passed, she realized it wasn\u2019t that simple. It wasn\u2019t only pepper that she no longer could stomach. She had lost her appetite for food as if she had anorexia. Food tasted as dry as dust in her mouth, retaining of its original flavor. There was, however, an exception. It was something which she wouldn\u2019t have even spared a look for before, let alone consume it \u2013 duck blood curd.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey girl, you\u2019ve been staring at my duck blood for half an hour already, are you going to buy it or not?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?!\u201d Sisi was stupefied. Her eyes were glued to the red substance on the stall, and she was unable to come to her senses. \u201cBuy it\u2026 or not?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s there to hesitate about? If you want to eat it, then buy it.\u201d The owner pounced at every possible hint of business and began to promote his products with a burning passion. \u201cSister, I must say you have a good taste. My duck blood is the best in the entire market, just look at this color, you can\u2019t buy this elsewhere. It\u2019s delicious when you make it into a curd.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, all the blood is freshly collected from the ducks butchered today.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 quite fresh, hahaha\u2026\u201d Plus, it smelled so delicious.</p><br/><p>\u201cTwo dollars for half a kilo, cheap and affordable.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d It smelled so good, so good, so good.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis opportunity comes and goes, my duck blood crud is in quite great demand. If you had come in the afternoon, there wouldn\u2019t have been any left.\u201d The owner lifted a piece of duck blood curd and weighed it in his hands while saying, \u201cI promise you, once you taste it, you will come back for more.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow about a kilogram, sister?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut\u2026\u201d Sisi\u2019s lip corners went down. \u201cI am allergic to duck blood!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Huh?\u201d The owner was dumbfound. The duck blood curd in his hand slipped off and landed into the water with a thud, splashing onto Yao Si\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>\u201cGirl, are you playing around with me? If you\u2019re allergic to duck blood then why are you standing over here for so long?\u201d Unable to sell anything, the owner was choked with anger.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to either!\u201d Just the thought of it filled Yao Si with grievance. \u201cI haven\u2019t eaten or slept for dozens of days, I can\u2019t hold anything down, and I only desire this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you fooling with me, girl?\u201d The owner was clearly not pleased. \u201cYou don\u2019t look like you haven\u2019t slept for a dozen days.\u201d Obviously not. She looked like she was bursting with energy. Besides, how could she have the strength to stand here after not eating anything for that long. \u201cHow about you check out something else?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious.\u201d Yao Si still couldn\u2019t control herself, and her eyes were stuck to the duck blood in the water. \u201cI smelled its fragrance from three blocks away.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow\u2019s that possible if it\u2019s so far away. That aside, you\u2019re not even a\u2026\u201d The owner\u2019s voice suddenly dropped as if he had recalled something. His eyes went wide when he scanned her from head to toe. Something flashed in his eyes and he immediately changed his words. \u201cSister, I have something even more fresh inside the room. Maybe you won\u2019t be allergic to that once you have a taste. Why don\u2019t you follow me inside?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally?\u201d There was duck blood that could combat allergies?</p><br/><p>\u201cCome along,\u201d the owner said and walked into the backroom. There, he turned around and gestured for her to come over.</p><br/><p>Yao Si followed him inside. Just as she entered the room, the owner drew the curtains closed, forming a closed-off space. The initial bright room darkened in a split second, shielding off the noise from the market outside.</p><br/><p>Yao Si\u2019s heart made a thump, and she timidly looked at the owner who had become so warm to her. \u201cBrother, you don\u2019t happen to have a side-job as a human trafficker, do you?\u201d This couldn\u2019t be another mini \u201cRujia\u201d incident.</p><br/><p>The happiness on the owner\u2019s face cracked, and his lips twitched. \u201cWhat nonsense is running up your head, sister? I\u2019m not a bad person.\u201d He glared at her with slight discontent, unable to understand her suspicions. He walked over to the right of the room, picked a cup, and poured in the remnants of what was inside an intricate container nearby. He then passed the cup to her. \u201cHere, sister, try this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Yao Si extended her hand and held the cup. It was half-full, containing a bright-red liquid that hadn\u2019t solidified yet. It was dazzling and brilliant like a ruby, and a strong whiff of blood-like fragrance greeted her, recovering her stagnant senses. Saliva pooled in her mouth, and even her stomach began to resonate with waves of rumbling.</p><br/><p>It smelled so good\u2026</p><br/><p>Yao Si couldn\u2019t resist it and wolfed down the entire cup. The odorous liquid felt silky as it rolled against her tongue, appeasing her taste buds. She was stolen away by the brilliant aftertaste. It was more enjoyable than a feast of Malatang, and even her teeth started to itch as something went down the corn of her lips.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust as I thought\u2026\u201d The owner let out a heavy breath.</p><br/><p>This finally snapped Yao Si from the heavenly aftertaste, and she realized that she had drank a whole cup of raw blood and even wanted another cup. Eerily, she didn\u2019t even feel disgusted, which was more than just confusing.</p><br/><p>Seeing the shocked expression on the owner\u2019s face, she set down the cup, gave a dry cough, and asked, \u201cHey boss, this anti-allergy duck blood ain\u2019t too shabby. How much for a kilogram? Give me five kilos.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSister\u2026\u201d The owner didn\u2019t move an inch, his eyes suddenly turning sympathetic as if he didn\u2019t know how to begin. \u201cI heard that you haven\u2019t slept or eaten for weeks?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYep!\u201d Yao Si nodded. Did this have anything to do with her buying duck blood?</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you feel like there\u2019s something wrong with your body?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA little.\u201d</p><br/><p>To be honest, she had already went to the hospital for a comprehensive check-up. She did it three times, but everything seemed to be fine. Even the doctors couldn\u2019t believe that she had really not slept or eaten for such a long period of time and had silently passed her business card to some psychiatrist.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you know why you\u2019re like this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Yao Si shook her head, then gave a look to the mysterious person. \u201cBoss, even if the anti-allergy duck blood costs four dollars for half a kilo, I will still buy it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not raising the price.\u201d The owner gawked at her snappishly. \u201cDon\u2019t you want to know what\u2019s happening to you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course!\u201d But even the hospital couldn\u2019t diagnose it. \u201cYou mean you know?\u201d she casually said.</p><br/><p>\u201cHold on.\u201d The owner looked around sneakily, then walked over and drew the curtain even tighter before returning with a stern face. \u201cSister, I want to ask you, have you encountered anything out of the ordinary in the past few weeks? \u201d he inquired.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean anything out of the ordinary\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLike being bitten or getting injured?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si shook her head vigorously. It would be difficult for a homebody like her to be injured.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid any stranger come to look for you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOnly takeout service and delivery.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen how about dreams? Have you had any strange dreams? Or something that you can\u2019t remember?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI dreamed of winning a five million lottery, does that count?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d The owner was speechless. In the end, he let out a long sigh, mumbling beneath his breath, \u201cWho cares, it\u2019s probably an accident. It\u2019s not a surprise in a troubled time like this\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>His expression filled with even more pity. If the look that he gave her before could be compared to a person looking at a lost child, then this would be the look for an orphaned child.</p><br/><p>Yao Si felt panicky under his eyes, even though she was indeed an orphan. \u201cBoss, just spit it out, would you? What\u2019s wrong with me?\u201d</p><br/><p>The owner composed himself. He pulled over two stools from the side, signaling for her to take a seat. Then, with his brows knit into a frown, he told her the truth.</p><br/><p>\u201cSister, you\u2019re dead.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p><em>F*ck!</em></p>\n</div>"}

Ah!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si could feel herself reacting instinctively, releasing the sudden force within her out. The power gushed forward aggressively, and the situation was instantly reversed. The ground shook vigorously as gigantic vines sprouted out toward the sky, their thick green stems almost beast like. Yao Qian\u2019s thorns were crushed instantly as the vines rose high and wide, spreading across the entire field.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Highness, this is the wood ability\u2026 Aiya!\u201d Before he could finish his sentence, he was suddenly lifted by a vine, left dangling in mid air.</p><br/><p>Everything happened in an instant. Before anyone could react, the entire practice grounds was filled with gigantic stems that were crawling in all directions, on the verge of destroying the entire venue.</p><br/><p>Yao Si realized\u2026 that she couldn\u2019t stop! Her body was like an open tap, pouring endless power out.</p><br/><p>\u201cIndeed!\u201d Mu Xuan\u2019s figure flashed, appearing out of a sudden. \u201cIt\u2019s enough.\u201d</p><br/><p>He reached out to place his hand on her shoulder, and the next moment the energy within her dissipated. The stems froze in midair and started to wither.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis\u2026\u201d Yao Si glanced at the mini forest in front of her with a face full of confusion. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d Wasn\u2019t her ability from the water series or negative space series? How did it become the wood series out of nowhere, and it was even getting stronger after each activation. \u201cMu Xuan, what exactly is my ability?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cInversion!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d <em>Excuse me?</em></p><br/><p><em>Can you explain yourself?</em></p><br/><p>\u201cYour ability isn\u2019t restricted to just one series and it can\u2019t be summoned at will.\u201d Mu Xuan pulled her over, and after finding a thicker stem, he sat down. \u201cBut whenever someone around you activates their ability, you\u2019ll be able to awake whatever is best offensively.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWait? What is that best offensively?\u201d Did her ability perhaps have the power to detect others\u2019 abilities?</p><br/><p>\u201cThe first ability you awoke was from the water series, which was because the opponent was using a fire ability. The second one you awoke was a space ability and so yours became the negative space. A while ago, Yao Qian used the earth ability and you used wood .\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhich means, my ability\u2026 depends on the opponents ability and will be the best series against it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMmh.\u201d He nodded. \u201cAfter getting the specifics down, it\u2019s called inversion.\u201d</p><br/><p>This meant that all abilities out there would be vulnerable in front of hers, right? That\u2019s awesome!</p><br/><p>\u201cWait!\u201d She suddenly had another thought. \u201cIf\u2026 the opponent doesn\u2019t activate their ability, doesn\u2019t that mean my ability won\u2019t exist, either?\u201d</p><br/><p>Mu Xuan stilled, the thought having never crossing his mind. After a moment of hesitation, he nodded. \u201cIndeed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhich means my ability is a passive ability?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 You can say that.\u201d</p><br/><p><em>F*ck! Isn\u2019t that pathetic </em>? And she actually thought she had a cool ability. She could already predict what her next opponent would say to her: Try and hit me!</p><br/><p>\u03a3(\u00b0\u25b3\u00b0|||)\ufe34</p><br/><p>\u201cBut\u2026\u201d Yao Si thought of yet another question, and she glanced at Mu Xuan. \u201cIf my ability reacts against the opponent\u2019s ability, then why\u2026 didn\u2019t I have any reaction when you displayed so many of your abilities before?\u201d She couldn\u2019t even feel his energy when he activated his ability. It only worked when Yao Qian came along.</p><br/><p>Mu Xuan frowned, caressing her head comfortingly. \u201cThis\u2026 probably has something to do with my ability.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Previously he used the fire and earth abilities, was it that there was something special about his ability besides it being so diverse?</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not like other members of our race, my energy originates from the bloodline that awakened the second time,\u201d he replied gravely. \u201cOther bloodlings\u2019 abilities are passed down from\u2026 I\u2019m basing it on a theory now, but all of them should have been passed down from the ancestral bloodline.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si was startled. \u201cSo\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have the full ability.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d A full ability! That was a truly amazing skill, so was that why he could summon so many different series? \u201cBut how does that answer my question on why I didn\u2019t feel anything\u2026\u201d Yao Si froze, her eyes widening. <em>Omg! </em> Based on her inverse ability\u2026 \u201d So if you\u2019re a full ability, then the opposite of that\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo ability.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p><em>F*ck! </em> That could actually happen! Why did it seem like the end of her ability\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough.\u201d Mu Xuan pulled her up. \u201cYour ability isn\u2019t stable yet, that\u2019s why you couldn\u2019t control it well just now. You need more practice. Maybe you can work on your passive ability.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally!\u201d Yao Si\u2019s eyes gleamed.</p><br/><p>\u201cMmh.\u201d He nodded. \u201cLet\u2019s head back to rest.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d Yao Si followed him out, but just as they were about to leave, she couldn\u2019t help taking another look at the practice ground.</p><br/><p><em>Hmm\u2026 Why does it feel like I\u2019m forgetting something?</em></p><br/><p>Forget it, she could deal with it after a nap!</p><br/><p>A certain someone who was left hanging could not utter a word.</p><br/><p>What was he here for in the first place?</p>\n</div>"}

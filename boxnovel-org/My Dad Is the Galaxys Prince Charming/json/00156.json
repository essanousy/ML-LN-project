We\u2019ll swim over!\u201d Yao Si dived into the stream with her breath held. However, the water flow passed her body instead, forming a bubble around her.</p><br/><p>She almost forgot about the water avoiding pearl the tiny merman had forced upon her. She reached out to pull Lian Yu into the bubble before heading toward the green seedling.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s there! Xi Mu\u2026\u201d Lian Yu exclaimed, preparing to swim over.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait a minute!\u201d Yao Si\u2019s heart clenched, and she pulled Lian Yu back to her side. \u201cThere\u2019s someone there!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lian Yu stilled, taking a closer look. There was really someone beside the tiny seedling. He had light blue clothes and seemed to be one with the water, which made it hard to spot him.</p><br/><p>That man had to have noticed them for he turned to face them. Even though he wasn\u2019t far, Yao Si wasn\u2019t able to distinguish his features. Was it mental strength?</p><br/><p>\u201cWere you the one who threw this here?\u201d he asked. Even though they were submerged in the water, Yao Si could hear him clearly, his voice deep and chilling. Suddenly, he reached out toward the seedling.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Lian Yu asked frantically, dashing out of the bubble. \u201cReturn my brother.\u2026 <em>Argh! </em>\u201d</p><br/><p>Before she could finish her sentence, she choked on the water. The corner\u2019s of Yao Si\u2019s mouth twitched, and she pulled the queen back into the bubble. <em>Don\u2019t you know that we\u2019re underwater? </em></p><br/><p>\u201cBrother?\u201d He scoffed. \u201cYou lowly races that dare to dirty my water, you deserve to be punished.\u201d He suddenly reached forward to pinch the seedling in his hands tightly.</p><br/><p>The seedling started to twitch. It was felt by the gigantic tree, and a painful shriek pierced through the water.</p><br/><p>That man was really going to kill the jade tree!</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Mu!\u201d Lian Yu\u2019s eyes went wide. Without caring about getting soaked, she spread her wings out, summoning up thousands of veins, and dashed forward without regard for anything.</p><br/><p>Yao Si started to panic, summoning up a fire ability to help.</p><br/><p>But it was useless. The man seemed to be surrounded by a protective barrier which prevented the ability from coming close to him.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a bloodling?\u201d His gaze turned cold, and he released the seedling to turn toward her.</p><br/><p>The moment he lay eyes on Yao Si, a chill ran through her, and even her bones filled with a chilling frost. She took a step backwards, a horrifying fear running through her. The man was\u2026 dangerous.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs compared to these lowly races, your blood is a little thicker.\u201d His sinister voice rang out, and the next instant he was behind her. \u201cBut lowly races are still lowly. You don\u2019t deserve to be a bloodling.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSisi!\u201d Lian Yu screamed.</p><br/><p>Before Yao Si could even turn around, she felt a menacing cold force pressure her as a white light zoomed toward her back. It wasn\u2019t a foreign sight, since she had seen it multiple times on Mu Xuan during his fight with Li Zheng that had caused the destruction of multiple planets.</p><br/><p>When the exact same ray ran got close to her, her mind blanked out.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, a red light flashed and a crimson wall surrounded her whole, blocking the white ray. A force tightened around Yao Si\u2019s waist, pulling her into a familiar embrace.</p><br/><p>\u201cSisi?\u201d A frantic caress wandered around her face, anxiously checking on her. \u201cBe good now, breathe!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMu\u2026 Xuan?\u201d Yao Si finally reacted, taking in a deep breath before starting to gasp for air, her body starting to tremble uncontrollably. It was the first time that she had had such a close encounter with death. Even when Li Zheng had stabbed her in the chest, it hadn\u2019t been so painfully real. The ray seemed like a force that she had no defense against.</p><br/><p>She tightened her grip on his clothes. \u201cMu Xuan, Mu Xuan\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be scared, I\u2019m here. Don\u2019t be scared!\u201d He hugged her tighter, repeatedly reassuring her, and gradually, the fear within her started to calm.</p><br/><p>\u201cHeh, another one.\u201d The person didn\u2019t panic at his missed attempt, disregarding the both of them. As he smirked, disdain entered his gaze. \u201cYou so-called bloodlings are indeed the most hate deserving in the world\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Before he could finish his sentence, Mu Xuan frowned, and a terrifyign pressure fell onto the man. It was so great that even the Rainbow Pond started to bloat up.</p><br/><p>Hundreds of rays appeared, forming a tightly knitted light web that flew toward the man.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is\u2026\u201d The disdain on the man\u2019s face froze, his eyes widening as he turned toward Mu Xuan. \u201cYou are a pure bloodling.\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment he said that, the rays reached him, and the entire planet shook from a loud eruption. Mu Xuan held onto Yao Si, and the next moment they were in outer space.</p><br/><p>Due to the rays, the entire Heavenly Planet was lacerated into pieces which went flying in all directions. Yao Si knew Mu Xuan\u2019s power\u2026 but she had an urge to weep. Hadn\u2019t she told him not to take revenge on the whole society even if he was angry?</p><br/><p>\u201cThe people on the planet?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey are fine,\u201d Mu Xuan replied immediately as though having awaited her question.</p><br/><p>Yao Si stilled, taking a closer look. Multiple bubbles were floating upwards from the planet with people who had been in the fog. Lian Yu had to have evacuated most so there weren\u2019t many left. Mu Xuan opened up a portal, sending all of them to the nearest planet.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, a man drenched in blood came flying out from the planet.</p><br/><p><em>F*ck, that pervert is still alive!</em></p><br/><p>\u201cPure bloodling, there is actually a pure bloodling in this world.\u201d As opposed to his previous sinister aura, the man seemed excited. His gaze fixed on Mu Xuan. \u201cCome with me, I will show you what a real bloodling is.\u201d</p><br/><p>Real bloodling?</p><br/><p>What did that mean? Were there still fake bloodlings?</p><br/><p>Mu Xuan frowned deeply, completely disregarding his words. \u201cSince you dared to threaten my cub, you aren\u2019t going anywhere!\u201d He raised his hands once more to summon the light rays.</p><br/><p>\u201cCub? Wait\u2014\u201d The man stilled, but before he could finish his sentence, Mu Xuan had already released his attack. The man scooted to the side, barely avoiding it. \u201cYou!\u201d He seemed enraged as he turned to glare at Yao Si, then instantly understood the situation and smirked. \u201cI never expected a pure bloodling to fall to such a state. You\u2019re with a bastard now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d <em>Who you\u2019re calling a bastard?</em></p><br/><p>\u201cForget it, there is no rush.\u201d The man smirked before turning to look at Yao Si. He started to dissipate, becoming fainter and fainter. \u201cOne day, you\u2019ll come begging for me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mu Xuan\u2019s hands tightened to attack once more, but the man was gone already.</p><br/><p>A bad feeling started to form within Yao Si.</p><br/><p>\u201cMu Xuan, is he perhaps a\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBloodling,\u201d he replied confidently. \u201cFirst generation.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

Ah?\u201d Qu Ze was dumbstruck, his expression that was aflame with indignation suddenly stiffened on his face, as if he couldn\u2019t instantly grasp what he\u2019d heard.</p><br/><p>\u201cQu Ze, are you treating me like an idiot?\u201d Yao Si sneered. \u201cThe Union, the Zergs, and the catastrophes that the bloodlings endured, did I cause any of them? What has it got to do with me? Even this \u2018Your Highness\u2019 and the thing of summoning you back to the Red Planet, did I do any of them? I\u2019ve never forced you to do anything, so don\u2019t even freaking think about pretending to have the moral ground on me! You\u2019re not living comfortably so you think the whole world is to blame. You think everyone is your mom!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d He was speechless.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care what intentions you have, but the things that happened the last few days, even if you did have absolutely justifiable reasons, they have nothing to do with me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d He seemed to want to say something else, but rumbling sounds suddenly began to ring above them.</p><br/><p>Qu Ze blanked out, then chuckled and corrected himself. \u201cThey arrived so quick\u2026 Not bad!\u201d He clicked something on his palm and immediately the surrounding white walls receded like a light curtain, exposing the outside world.</p><br/><p>Only then did Yao Si realize that the place they were at was a patch of red-grass lawn. One she also knew since it was close to her current residence; she had taken a stroll through here before.</p><br/><p>In the sky overhead hovered dozens of air crafts filled with bloodlings who looked worried sick.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Highness!\u201d Yao Qian was the first to hop down and stride next to her. \u201cAre you alright?\u201d He took a look at her, then immediately held up a detector like device to check her condition. \u201cYou have suffered and it\u2019s all my fault, only realizing now that you\u2019re here.\u201d He looked as if he was about to break into tears.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d Yao Si could only reply to him with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow can you be fine, you\u2019ve been missing for so long, and was with\u2026\u201d It looked as if he suddenly remembered something and turned and yelled at Qu Ze, \u201cGreat elder, you\u2019ve gone too far! How could you take her highness away like that, and intentionally blocking out all the signals as well. What have you done to her highness?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha, little thirteen, isn\u2019t she alright?\u201d <em>Isn\u2019t it clear that I\u2019m the one in a worse situation?</em></p><br/><p>\u201cYou call this alright!\u201d Yao Qian pointed at Yao Si who was covered in dust and mud, and wanted to cry even more. He turned back and looked towards Qu Ze as if he had just realized his strange state. \u201cGreat elder, what\u2019s wrong with you, why are you bowing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh\u2026 There\u2019s been a small accident.\u201d Qu Ze raised his hand and indicated just how small with the gap between his thumb and index finger. Recalling the beating which he just took, he felt that his crotch was in even more distress. No wonder she was their race\u2019s ancestor, even when beating people up she was so\u2026 professional!</p><br/><p>Yao Qian was still a little confused, but Yao Si lifted Qu Ze up straight away and shoved him over. \u201cI\u2019m handing him to you, deal with him however you like, just inform me when you do.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Qian promptly caught him and handed him over to the other elders who had followed behind.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Highness, it\u2019s a relief that you\u2019re fine,\u201d one of those elders said after taking a look at her. He then exhaled a long breath and turned to glare at Qu Ze. \u201cGreat elder, in view of your self-appointed task, and its consequences, you\u2019ve greatly displeased all our kind. You will have to take full responsibility for this incident.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, okay, okay!\u201d Qu Ze raised both of his hands and made a surrendering motion. \u201cI\u2019ll follow you guys back and you can deal with me however you wish,\u201d he said right after, and then, covering his crotch with one hand, struggled up some elder\u2019s aircraft. While he did that he didn\u2019t forget to turn and wave at Yao Si, saying \u201cGoodbye, Little highness.\u201d</p><br/><p>Once the elders saw that he had the look of a \u2018dead pig not fearing the heat of boiling water\u2019, their faces darkened. They greeted Yao Si in a hurry, then after repeatedly instructing Yao Qian, they boarded their own aircraft and flew in the direction of the Elders\u2019 Committee.</p><br/><p>Right then, there were only Yao Qian and Yao Si left on the lawn.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow will you people punish him?\u201d Yao Si couldn\u2019t help but ask. Judging by the serious looks of the elders, it appeared that taking her away for so many days was actually a grave matter. \u201cIt couldn\u2019t be eternal sleep, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Highness\u2026\u201d Yao Qian looked at her strangely. \u201cWhy would you ask?\u201d</p><br/><p>She told him the words that Qu Ze had just said. \u201cHe said he kidnapped me because he was dissatisfied that I hadn\u2019t protected the bloodlings yet still have such a high status.\u201d</p><br/><p>After hearing all this, Yao Qian\u2019s expression changed. It became even more odd, and it almost looked as if he had constipation.</p><br/><p>Some time passed before he said, \u201cYour Highness, do you think\u2026 with our kind\u2019s special traits, do we need people to protect us?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si was stupefied, and her whole person suddenly became stiff.</p><br/><p><em>Shit! Shit! Shit! Shit! So all those words filled with indignation were all just nonsense like I guessed?</em></p><br/><p>\u201cFrom my understanding of him, the great elder was probably\u2026 just purely manipulating you for an experiment.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Is there still time for me to catch up and beat him up again?\u201d</p>\n</div>"}

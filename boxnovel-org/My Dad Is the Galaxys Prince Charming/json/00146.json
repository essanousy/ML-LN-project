He stared at them for a moment before a thought stuck him, and he turned to Mu Xuan frantically.\u201dYou have an ability!\u201d</p><br/><p>His face fell. He struggled up to escape, but before he could do so, he was forced back down by Mu Xuan\u2019s mental strength.</p><br/><p>He paled, staring at them with large, frightened eyes; however, he remained stubborn and shouted out, \u201cIt\u2019s too early to be arrogant. Once the other bests find out, the hundreds in District 3 will never let you off\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Before he could finish his sentence, Mu Xuan opened another space portal. It was about four to five times bigger than the previous one. The next instant, a bunch of people came falling out like dumplings, all of them armed bests.</p><br/><p>Once the room was filled, Mu Xuan turned to Feng Xiao, articulating each slowly. \u201cAnymore?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Everyone</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Feng Xiao who was clearly petrified.</p><br/><p>Yao Si silently praised her nanny dad; his methods were indeed suave! The group of beasts remained motionless, unable to process the situation.</p><br/><p>\u256e(\u256f\ufe4f\u2570\uff09\u256d</p><br/><p>Since Feng Xiao seemed to have gone into a daze, Mu Xuan had no intention of pursing his interrogation. Instead, he walked to the control table and started to type rapidly, his fingers flying across the keyboard. After five minutes, he switched it off and turned to caress Yao Si\u2019s head. \u201cSisi, the safety systems are back in place.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally!\u201d Yao Si exclaimed when his meaning sunk in. She hurriedly tapped the shoulder of a dazed person beside her. \u201cManager Yuan, the signal is back. Hurry and contact the galactic police.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh? Ah!\u201d Manager Yuan took a moment to close his mouth that had fallen open. \u201cAl-alright!\u201d Trembling, he opened his optical computer once more and dialed for the police while repeatedly peeking at the \u2018dumplings\u2019 on the ground.</p><br/><p>Wasn\u2019t the matter almost finished? Was there a need for the police? What kind of talent did the boss bring along? He seemed like someone capable enough to save the world. And it wasn\u2019t even an exaggeration, but all truth! When compared to such a person, the galactic police paled in comparison!</p><br/><p>Manager Yuan and Lu Chen proved to be worthy their status. Even though the matter had escalated, they could deal with it efficiently. After gathering a group, they found the devices that could restrict one\u2019s movements and captured all the \u2018dumplings\u2019 that were forced down by Mu Xuan\u2019s mental strength.</p><br/><p>In half an hour, the galactic police sent a reply that they had come.</p><br/><p>Yao Si joined the typing gang. As the new boss, she felt a need to take the lead. She reached for the restriction device from Lu Chen, but just as she was about to fasten it onto the nearest \u2018dumpling\u2019, she felt a surge within her.</p><br/><p>This feeling\u2026 was of an ability?!</p><br/><p>Her heart sank. Turning toward the employee that was heading for Feng Xiao, she shouted out, \u201cBe careful!\u201d She then hurriedly reached to pull that person back.</p><br/><p>As expected, the next moment an intense gust of power burst out from Feng Xiao, and he tossed an immobile beast toward her.</p><br/><p>\u201cSisi!\u201d Mu Xuan frowned as the beast tumbled toward them. He formed his mental energy into a ball of strength and directed it at the tumbling bestial. It was enveloped by the mental strength, which made it groan, and seconds after, his tummy exploded, flesh and blood spurting everywhere.</p><br/><p>Almost instinctively, a surge of power formed within Yao Si, which she directed toward Feng Xiao. The energy bolted straight at him, building up a vigorous gust of wind.</p><br/><p><em>Bullseye! </em>But Feng Xiao disappeared.</p><br/><p>\u201cParticle transportation device!\u201d Lu Chen exclaimed/ \u201cI never expected him to posses such equipment.\u201d</p><br/><p>So\u2026 he was transported away?</p><br/><p>\u201cMu Xuan..\u201d She turned to him. \u201cCan we bring him back?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot at the moment.\u201d Mu Xuan shook his head. \u201cI need to know his general location to transport him, but the particle transportation device transports at random.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si frowned. It wasn\u2019t safe for such a person to be roaming about.</p><br/><p>She turned toward the dead beast trapped in the mental strength bubble. After just a short glance, she couldn\u2019t help turning away. It was gruesome! The beast which had been part of the rebellion was missing a good chunk of his body in the stomach area, and the shock on his face was still intact after his death.</p><br/><p>Feng Xiao had deliberately exploited the explosion to escape. If Mu Xuan had been any slower, the everyone in the room would have been drenched in the beast\u2019s flesh and blood. No one could have guessed that his hardheartedness was strong enough to use his own people to escape.</p><br/><p>His last stunt was enough to leave everyone, even his comrades traumatized. The employee Yao Si had pulled aside was distraught, all the color stripped off his face.</p><br/><p>At the time, Yao Si had sensed the surge of her passive ability, and Manager Yuan had also mentioned that the leader of the rebels had an ability, which had led her to the thought that he might be about to do something .</p><br/><p>\u201cThis\u2026 what ability was that?\u201d She had never witnessed an ability that could explode someone internally. Before she could lift her head again, darkness clouded her vision as Mu Xuan shielded her from the sight.</p><br/><p>\u201cExplosion!\u201d he replied gravely. He lifted his other hand, sending the dead beasts into an empty room before taking his other one from her hands. \u201cHis ability can alter the water molecules in one\u2019s body into something explosive, so\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>So the stomach would just explode? It was a frightening ability, so was that how he was able to control the employees of the Ore Planet? He definitely wasn\u2019t someone to be looked down upon.</p><br/><p>But\u2026 if his ability was explosion, what would the counter ability be?</p><br/><p>Feng Xiao had escaped too quickly so she wasn\u2019t able to see the results!</p><br/><p>\u201cThe galactic police is here!\u201d Lu Chen exclaimed as an alarm sounded. The remaining employees heaved a sigh of relief while a number of them ran out to welcome the officers.</p><br/><p>Without waiting for them to leave the room, a huge group of uniformed and armed men came rushing in.</p><br/><p>The galactic police took care of the situation efficiently, capturing all the beasts. According to Lu Chen, a large troop had arrived and was spread out through the various districts. It had been mentioned what had happened when they contacted the galactic police to ensure speed and so the other districts wouldn\u2019t cause unnecessary trouble.</p><br/><p>In less than two hours, the catastrophe had been dealt with and all the employees released. However, there was still no news of Feng Xiao. He wasn\u2019t in any of the districts, and despite scouring the planet multiple times, he was still nowhere to be found.</p><br/><p>With such a sinister person on the loose, it was quite worrying.</p><br/><p>Tensions were strung tight, but after three hours, Feng Xiao came back voluntarily.</p><br/><p>With a personalized transportation ship, he suddenly appeared in front of Yao Si.</p><br/><p>What was weird was his expression\u2014he no longer had the haughty menacing scowl, but instead his face was tear-stained. The moment he caught sight of Yao Si, he dropped to his knees and started to wail pitifully, huge droplets pouring down his cheeks without end.</p><br/><p>\u201cBoss, I was wrong, I was really wrong. I should have never preyed on your things. I was blind! I\u2019m not a human. Please, have a heart, save me! I-I-I really can\u2019t take it anymore!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>(\u2299_\u2299)</p><br/><p><em>Ah?! What\u2019s with this situation!</em></p><br/><p>\u201cBoss! I beg you, please retract the ability you cast on my body! Even though my personal life can be messy, I\u2019ve never harmed married women or teased innocent ladies. I have also never let the female kind down in anyway.\u201d He wept as his body convulsed. \u201cI-I-I\u2019m a fully grown man, I-I don\u2019t wish to give birth!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si took a closer look at him and saw a huge bump was on his originally muscular body. On closer inspection, there seemed to be something kicking within it.</p><br/><p>\u201cAhah\u2026 Pain, pain, pain\u2026 I-I\u2019m about to give birth! Save me!\u201d Feng Xiao shrieked as he tumbled around.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Yao Si.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Mu Xuan.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d The audience surrounding them.</p><br/><p>This\u2026 What\u2019s with this situation!</p><br/><p>(\u2299 o \u2299)</p><br/><p>Feng Xiao was preganant? Who did it?</p><br/><p>No wait! How did Feng Xiao get pregnant in the first! Wasn\u2019t he a man?!</p><br/><p><em>F*ck!</em></p><br/><p>Yao Si remembered\u2026 Feng Xiao had an explosion ability and could erupt other people\u2019s stomachs. Since her ability was his counter\u2026 the counter of an empty tummy is\u2026 a full tummy!</p><br/><p>Her ability was\u2026 to impregnate anyone she looked at?!</p><br/><p>Flips table!</p><br/><p>(\u256f\u2035\u25a1\u2032)\u256f\ufe35\u253b\u2501\u253b</p><br/><p><em>How is that even possible!</em></p></div>\n</div>"}

Other than the Flower of the Heavenly Tree that was left stationed conspicuously in mid-air, there wasn\u2019t a single trace left behind.</p><br/><p>More and more loopholes started to emerge, and the entire situation seemed rather odd, as though it wasn\u2019t as simple as they had originally anticipated.</p><br/><p>Yao Si could understand Lian Yu\u2019s intentions for leaving the Flower of the Heavenly Tree behind, since she probably already guessed that they tracked them through it. With the presence of the lighting sylvani king, the Flower of the Heavenly Tree\u2019s safety could be guaranteed, and without the burden of it, they couldn\u2019t locate her anymore.</p><br/><p>But Yao Si couldn\u2019t understand why Lin Long would indulge in her willfulness. According to his stubborn personality, seeking his cooperation would be harder than ascending to the heavens!</p><br/><p>Even with the contractor\u2019s name on her, he had deliberately agitated her, forcing her to endure his vicious mouth and endless nagging. But Lian Yu was a stranger and a member of a race he despised and deemed to be inferior.</p><br/><p>In Galactic N, in that fleeting encounter, Lin Long hadn\u2019t unleashed his explosive personality, but instead seemed rather cooperative with Lian Yu who was his kidnapper.</p><br/><p>Previously, when Yao Si had accidentally pulled him onto Ability Planet while he was frantically trying to mend the planet, he complained the entire journey. So this time, why was he so cooperative with Lian Yu\u2019s game of hide and seek spanning the whole Galaxy? On top of that, he allowed her to station the Flower of the Heavenly Tree on the Blue Planet he spent so much time to reconstruct. Something was certainly amiss!</p><br/><p>Was he really that bored or did Lian Yu manage to convince him with her eloquence, moving this ancient single dog heart into obedience?</p><br/><p>When did the person who would create planets on impulse and keep galactic beasts as pets become so easy-going? Wasn\u2019t their race filled with ruthless and uncompromising bloodlings who despised other races except for\u2026</p><br/><p>A bold assumption came to mind, and Yao Si\u2019s eyes went wide.</p><br/><p>\u201cMu Xuan, do you think Lian Yu is\u2026 Lin Long\u2019s contractor?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Mu Xuan stilled, and his frown deepened. The thought seemed to have crossed his mind as well. \u201cIt\u2019s possible.\u201d Lin Long had once mentioned that bloodlings would never be able to disobey their contractor\u2019s wishes. The only reasonable explanation for his compliance would be that\u2026 he had bade his single dog life farewell!</p><br/><p>(\u2299_\u2299)</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not right!\u201d A thought struck Yao Si. \u201cThis isn\u2019t Lin Long and Lian Yu\u2019s first encounter; they had already met before on Heavenly Planet. Besides, there was a dispute between the both of them because of the Flower of the Heavenly Tree. If she is really his contractor, why didn\u2019t he recognize her back then?\u201d</p><br/><p>Besides, if it was really so easy to find one\u2019s contractor, he wouldn\u2019t have been single for such a long time.</p><br/><p>\u201cSisi,\u201d Mu Xuan said in a low voice. \u201cDid Lin Long ever tell you how the pure breeds identify their contractors?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t!\u201d She shook her head while caressing her temples. \u201cHe only mentioned that this ink represents a blood deed and that a pure breed would only have a blood deed with his contractor. Yes! I kept forgetting to ask you, what exactly is a blood deed? Why did you suddenly give it to me?\u201d</p><br/><p>She could only remember him biting her before he had left for the abyss. She had brushed it off as lack of experience, but on further thought, he seemed to have done it deliberately. The blood deed had to have been left behind at that time.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis\u2026 I\u2019m not too sure.\u201d Surprisingly, Mu Xuan had a blank look. He reached out to caress the mark on her forehead. \u201cAt that time, it just felt like\u2026 something I should do.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Long\u2019s claim about Mu Xuan being a pure breed that had sealed up his memory to live a brand new life seemed almost possible at that moment. Even without remembering anything, he still possessed the instinct that probed him into sealing the blood deed on his contractor.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d Yao Si didn\u2019t spare much thought for the details. \u201cRegardless of whether Lian Yu is Lin Long\u2019s contractor, the most pressing matter right now is to locate them. The issue will be clarified once we find them. Besides, I have no intention of staying like this for much longer.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMmh.\u201d Mu Xuan\u2019s expression sank, and he caressed her head again. \u201cI instructed the Red Planet to notify all the piers in the alliance to sound an alarm when they enter. Sisi, try to recall if the Aves queen ever mentioned any special place or anywhere she wants to bring you .\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t!\u201d Yao Si shook her head. \u201cWe only met three times, so how could our conversation go so far? Besides, every time we met, she would be either trying to kidnap me or proposing, so how would I know\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si paused mid-sentence, a possibility striking her. She turned to head toward a certain someone who had secretly shrank and hidden the Flower of the Heavenly Tree.</p><br/><p>\u201cLighting sylvani king.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh! Ah?\u201d The lighting sylvani king trembled so much he almost dropped the heart in his hands. Sweat started to stream down his face. \u201cHehehe\u2026 What else can I do for you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLian Yu is your niece, so you know a lot about Aves, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEr, I\u2026 do!\u201d Could he say he didn\u2019t? He was on his way to severing all ties with them, though.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere do Aves register their marriage?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d The lighting sylvani king was struck with shock, but he still replied obediently, \u201cFor Aves marriages, they would have to go to the fig tree in the royal aves planet\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Before he could finish his sentence, Mu Xuan\u2019s face went thoroughly black. He opened a portal to the royal aves planet. \u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d He tugged onto Yao Si and entered.</p><br/><p>Yao Si wasn\u2019t well acquainted with Lian Yu, but in their three fleeting meetings, the woman had kept harping repeatedly about one thing: Let\u2019s register our marriage!</p><br/><p>Hence, the location Lian Yu most wanted to go to and was probably at should be\u2014marriage registration point.</p><br/><p>If they were really there, after such a long time, then\u2026</p><br/><p>Yao Si felt her heart clench, but she tossed the thought aside and headed into the black space portal that Mu Xuan had opened. They were transported from Blue Planet to their location almost instantly.</p><br/><p>She caught sight of a massive tree at first glance. Even though it wasn\u2019t as big as the lighting sylvani tree\u2019s real form, it was tall enough to reach the clouds. The branches were plentiful, and the leaves luxuriant, but they were colorless and slightly transparent. Under the bright sun, the leaves reflected sunlight, forming a mesh of colors akin to the aurora and creating a dream like atmosphere.</p><br/><p>Directly below the tree were two figures. The one on the left was Lian Yu, and the one on the right was an immensely familiar face\u2014the one Yao Si had been looking at for over thirty years.</p><br/><p>The moment they reached them, familiar vows were being read.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss Yao Si, are you willing to take Miss Lian Yu as your wife, to have and to hold, from this day forward, for better or for worse, for richer or for poorer, in sickness and in health, to love and cherish forever?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si\u2019s heart shook, and before Lin Long could answer, she shouted out, \u201cWhat the f*ck you mean by you do!\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

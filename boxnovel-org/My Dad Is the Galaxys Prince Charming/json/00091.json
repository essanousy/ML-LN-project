That\u2019s not what I meant! </em>Yao Si hurriedly regained her senses. \u201cWhere are your thoughts straying to, I meant that I know him!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you knew\u2026\u201d The three balls took in a deep breath. \u201cSis\u2026 that\u2019s extreme, can we ask how did you guys meet?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck! I meant\u2026\u201d <em>Can your thoughts be any dirtier? </em> \u201cF*ck, why are you guys so far away?\u201d The three balls that were nearby were about a metre away now.</p><br/><p>\u201cSis, we\u2019re straight,\u201d said the white ball.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s right, straight like a pencil,\u201d the blue ball agreed.</p><br/><p>\u201cStraighter than a pencil,\u201d exclaimed the green ball.</p><br/><p>\u201cScram!\u201d Yao Si then took a deep breath and explained in a resigned voice, \u201cI know that man out there.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs he really someone you know?\u201d the blue ball asked, then stilled and sighed. \u201cHe\u2019s going to be in big trouble, the demonic cultivator is a Nascent Soul while he is just a Golden Core! There is no way he can defeat the demonic cultivator. In less than half an hour, his soul will be sucked in here.</p><br/><p>The blue ball was right. Zan Zichen was indeed an unlucky child that couldn\u2019t defeat the demonic force. The very next instant, he was filled with bruises but still persisted on brandishing his sword.</p><br/><p>\u201cEven though you\u2019re just a Golden Core, you\u2019ll be enough for my Soul Devouring Flag.\u201d With a slight rotation of the man\u2019s palms, a thousand demonic swords flew out.</p><br/><p>Zan Zichen tightened his grip on the sword, defending himself relentlessly, but in just a few strikes, they managed to pierce his body. Fresh blood splattered out, staining his long robe, turning it into a ghastly sight.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh, this Golden Core seems to be quite skilled. Logically speaking, even if he isn\u2019t able to win against the demonic cultivator, he should still be able to escape,\u201d the blue ball mumbled in confusion. \u201cWhy is he struggling so unnecessarily?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si stilled, focusing on the image.</p><br/><p>Just then, Zan Zichen asked loudly, \u201cI can sense Senior Si\u2019s energy from that flag, you demon, what did you do with her?\u201d</p><br/><p><em>F*ck! </em>This kid was still here because of her?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat senior?\u201d The demonic cultivator smirked. \u201cI\u2019ve killed many people, how would I remember them? But just half an hour ago, my Soul Devouring Flag indeed sucked in a strange woman without any spiritual energy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zan Zichen\u2019s face paled, and fury drenched his soul. He then tightened his grip on the sword and attacked a thousand times in succession. \u201cI\u2019m going to kill you to avenge her!\u201d</p><br/><p>When yet another fight erupted, Yao Si grew increasingly more worried.</p><br/><p>\u201cBlue ball, you\u2019re one the celestials, don\u2019t you have any way to save him?\u201d she asked, recalling the lifeless gray balls around them. \u201cHe\u2019s an indigenous tribe member, if he loses, his consciousness will end up being eaten by the flag.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no choice!\u201d the blue ball waved his hand dismissively, without a hint of emotion in his voice when he spoke. \u201cHe\u2019s just unlucky, even though the demonic cultivator isn\u2019t smart, we can\u2019t get out. It isn\u2019t that this bro doesn\u2019t want to help you, but there really isn\u2019t a solution!\u201d he explained in a sincere manner.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right! Sis, even if we could go out, that\u2019s a bad idea before our money is used up.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYea, it wasn\u2019t easy to get this gift, so it\u2019d be a waste it if we didn\u2019t train our awareness enough!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s just an indigenous tribe member, why bother saving him?\u201d</p><br/><p>Member of an indigenous tribe\u2026</p><br/><p>What\u2019s wrong with the indigenous tribe? Even if they were considered to be of lower status, what did it matter? He was still someone she recognized as a friend, so what\u2019s wrong with standing up for him!</p><br/><p>\u201cIs there really no way?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo!\u201d the threw instantly answered together.</p><br/><p>Yao Si bit down on her lip, then took a deep breath to calm herself down. \u201cIt\u2019s such a pity, I was just about to reduce the debt accumulated from the mahjong for whoever came up with a solution\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have a plan you can try!\u201d Before she could even finish her sentence, the blue ball immediately changed his stand. In a serious voice, he said, \u201cIt would definitely be safe, effective, and without any pain. Sis, how about I help you then?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck, you schemer!\u201d the green ball that was a step too late scolded. \u201cSis, don\u2019t listen to his words, I however have a plan\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMe, me, me! My plan is the best!\u201d the white ball squeezed in.</p><br/><p>It was completely different from the nonchalant scene from before, now that they fought to get their solutions approved.</p><br/><p>Di-di-di! Suddenly, an alarm rang from the white and green ball simultaneously.</p><br/><p>Their faces lit up, turning agitated\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cI have an amulet in my space, you can use it, reduce my debt\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have a life-saving pill\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Before they could even finish their sentences, they disappeared with a shuffling sound.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat just happened?\u201d Yao Si jumped.</p><br/><p>\u201cTheir training period just ended, they were transported back to their bodies and will be sent out of the Shadow Planet.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m a celestial so I get to enjoy a special rate!\u201d the blue ball replied proudly before waving his hand in hesitation. \u201cOh right, sis, can I really have my debt reduced?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBefore that, how are we going to get out?\u201d If she\u2019d known about celestials\u2019 greed, she would have monopolized on it sooner. The sis here is rich!</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s easy,\u201d he said. \u201cEven though this space is where devoured souls are left, it\u2019s considered a prize for us. If you want to get out, you just have to give up on the prize prematurely of your own accord.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s that simple?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cObviously we need a little something more.\u201d He grinned. \u201cIf we go out prematurely, we would end up in a random location. If it\u2019s too far away, we won\u2019t be able to save your friend. But I have an amulet that will allow us to choose our location when we get out. The amulet can only be used once. I\u2019ll be kind and give you a 5% discount. For an indigenous person to advance to a celestial, they have to withstand immense pressure on their ability. I\u2019ll help you deal with the demonic cultivator and act as the cleanup, what do you think?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you a thirty percent discount on your debt!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDeal!\u201d</p><br/><p>The blue ball begun to spin, itching toward the camera at the top. Suddenly, he started to glow, the light rays almost blinding. \u201cI give up this prize.\u201d The blue ball then turned to Yao Si. \u201cSis, hurry!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si flinched slightly before announcing, \u201cI give up the prize.\u201d</p><br/><p>The blue glow stretched to her as well. She then gradually felt herself turning weightless, but the very next moment, she seemed heavier. Her ears buzzed and the scenery started to spin before they landed in a forest.</p><br/><p>At that moment, the demonic cultivator was in the process of tossing his Soul Devouring Flag toward a paralyzed Zan Zichen</p><br/><p>\u201cBlue ball!\u201d Yao Si shouted.</p><br/><p>The person beside her reacted then. With a wave of his hands, a huge gust of wind stirred, blowing the Soul Devouring Flag away. A pressuring force enveloped them, and it was a force similar to bloodlings\u2019 bloodline suppression. Yao Si wasn\u2019t affected but the demonic cultivator was already on his knees with his head buried into the ground. It was as though his body was being forced downward.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho-who are you?\u201d The demonic cultivator lifted his head, but he didn\u2019t seem to be able to move any more than that. As he was paralyzed, fear shrouded his entire being.</p><br/><p>The blue ball that had come out with Yao Si stepped forward. He was dressed in a blue robe, standing with his celestial aura apparent, his face shinning with righteousness. In an authoritative voice, he said, \u201d You don\u2019t have an inch of remorse for all the wrongdoings you\u2019ve been indulging in. Today, justice will prevail, it\u2019s time for your retribution.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s-it\u2019s you!\u201d The demonic cultivator\u2019s eyes went wide. \u201cIt can\u2019t be, I clearly collected your soul! Who exactly are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou know who I am?\u201d The blue bal\u2014no, the blue celestial scoffed, his voice tightening slightly. \u201cI gave you a chance previously, pretending to be sucked into the Soul Devouring Flag, but you remain remorseless, free of guilt for your evil doings. Today, I shall bring the justice of heavens onto you.\u201d</p><br/><p>His fingers twitched slightly, and a blue ray darted out from between them, heading straight for the demonic cultivator\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo-no!\u201d His eyes flew open, his body flailing in a defensive manner. \u201cYou-you\u2019re a celestial\u2026\u201d Before he could finish his sentence, the ray struck his face, silencing him.</p><br/><p>Yao Si remained nonchalant as she hurried over to Zan Zichen with single-minded focus. He was soaked in blood, his body seriously wounded. She inhaled sharply at the gruesome sight</p><br/><p>\u201cFinished your heroic act?\u201d she asked with a roll of her eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cHehehe\u2026 Sis, what are you saying, I was just feeling righteous.\u201d He had to maintain a celestial demeanour.</p><br/><p>\u201cEnough, if you\u2019re done acting, you can tell me how to save him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zan Zichen was down to his last breath. If they were in the Galaxy, they could send him to a treatment room where he would fully recover in less than five minutes. But there was no such thing here, so what could she do?</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d The blue ball caressed his chin. After a short moment, he turned with a troubled expression/ \u201cHis injuries are quite serious: There\u2019s damage to his heart and all the arteries are broken. With the medical capacity of Shadow Planet, er.\u2026 it\u2019s difficult!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll remove your entire debt!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry sis!\u201d His expression took a hundred and eighty degree change. With a pat on his chest, he pulled out a bunch of tubes. \u201cI have here a bone-linking pill, vein-continuation pill, energy gathering pill, blood-circulation pill, blood supplement, red supplement , blue supplement, so even the dead could be resurrected! Sis, which one would you like to start from?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWake him up first!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAll right!\u201d He took a red pill and fed it to Zan Zichen.</p><br/><p>In less than half a minute, he started to react, his brows furrowing as he regained consciousness. \u201cSe-senior?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStop moving, yous injuries are very serious.\u201d She hurriedly pressed him down, preventing him from getting up.</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior\u2026 you-you\u2019re all right?\u201d He glanced at her worriedly.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, you\u2019re the one that isn\u2019t!\u201d Yao Si sighed. He sure was an unlucky kid.</p><br/><p>Zan Zichen heaved a sigh of relief. \u201cThat\u2019s great\u2026 <em>Cough, cough </em>!\u201d His entire body shook abruptly as he spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><br/><p>Yao Si started to panic. \u201cBlue ball!\u201d <em>Didn\u2019t he just take the medicine?</em></p><br/><p>\u201cThis- He- His veins have been severed. Spitting blood is quite normal for such a serious injury.\u201d Blue ball looked a face of innocence as he passed another pill over. \u201cEven though my pills are fascinating, they can only save his life. It\u2019ll be impossible for him to return to his original state.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTell me, how much money do you want!\u201d Yao Si immediately opened her optical computer.</p><br/><p>He froze, scratching his head in embarrassment. \u201cThis\u2026 It isn\u2019t about money, I really have no idea how to treat him. His organs are shattered, which can only be salvaged with special pills of at least the tenth grade, and that\u2019s beyond my abilities.\u201d</p><br/><p>Was there really no solution?</p><br/><p>\u201cIt-it\u2019s alright!\u201d Zan Zichen shook his head nonchalantly. \u201cI\u2019m lucky to even be alive. Senior, you don\u2019t have to worry.\u201d</p><br/><p><em>How is this all right? </em> Yao Si tightened her hands into fists. If she\u2019d known that something like this might happen, she would have bought the pills from the elderly man before. Yet now she didn\u2019t\u2026</p><br/><p>Wait!</p><br/><p>\u201cBefore I came, someone gave me this, stating that it would come in handy during an emergency.\u201d She took out the jade tablet that Yan Xuan had entrusted to her previously.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs this a space jade tablet?\u201d The blue ball took a glance. \u201cThere should be something inside it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWill it be useful?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet me take a look!\u201d While holding onto his own bottles of pills he chanted, then softly tapped the tablet, and a gold ray lit up. Out of it, a jade bottle flew out.</p><br/><p>\u201cNi-nine soul-calling pills!\u201d The blue ball\u2019s eyes went wide, the bottles in his hands slipping to the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre they useful?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Are you f*cking kidding me?\u201d</p>\n</div>"}

As the name suggests, they\u2019re pills that can even bring back a soul that has already left the body it inhabits. This kind of pill can only be crafted by master alchemists who have profound cultivation talents. There are no more than five of this kind of people in the entire Galaxy, and they are either in some high position or the bosses of parts of heaven. It\u2019s easier to climb up to the sky than to ask them to turn on the stove and practice alchemy.</p><br/><p>The blue ball who was a celestial had never seen these pills in his life, yet the girl in front of him not only had one, but a full bottle! Something like this could only meant one thing \u2013 she was one with connections!</p><br/><p>\u201cAre those pills of any use?\u201d Yao Si was a little impatient. \u201cCan they save him or not?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe can be saved, he sure as hell can be saved.\u201d This kind of minor injury in the Dantian was nothing, even ten of Zan Zichen could be saved with one pill.</p><br/><p>Yao Si immediately took one pill out and fed Zan Zi Chen. As expected, the wounds on his body healed at the speed that could be detected by the naked eye. At the centre of his chest, a white light seemed to converge. Ten minutes later, he could already stand up, eat, jump about, and do anything else that he might want. If it weren\u2019t for the bloodstains on his clothes, there\u2019d be no way to tell that he had been injured.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you Senior Si, and\u2026 and this senior for saving my life.\u201d Zan Zichen bowed to them at the first opportunity, with devotion evident in his actions.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d Yao Si let out the breath she\u2019d been holding. \u201cAs long as you\u2019re okay! Don\u2019t be so obstinate in the future, if you can\u2019t beat them, run, all right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, senior!\u201d he answered in a loud and earnest voice.</p><br/><p>Yao Si nodded with satisfaction; the child could still be taught.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha\u2026 Hey, sister!\u201d The blue ball pushed his way over, his attitude having changed drastically. He asked carefully, \u201cAre you familiar with the Heavenly Emperor of the Four Realms?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Heavenly Emperor of the Four Realms? Who\u2019s that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t know?\u201d The blue ball stared blankly. This shouldn\u2019t be right\u2026 \u201cWhat other celestials do you know?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si thought about it. \u201cI only know one that\u2019s called Li Yue.\u201d To be exact, Yan Xuan knew him.</p><br/><p>\u201cHis Immortality Li Yue !\u201d His legs became a little flabby\u2014this figure was even more formidable than the Heavenly Emperor of the Four Realms! His heart immediately trembled. \u201cSister, are you lacking in leg accessories? The kind that have already ascended to heaven?\u201d <em>This sure is a coattail worth holding onto! </em></p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Before Yao Si could answer, there was a familiar buzzing sound; the blue ball\u2019s training time was up. His face turned pale, and he grabbed onto her and yelled, \u201cSister, that Mahjong debt that I just owed, I\u2019ll repay it to you double, no, ten times! Let\u2019s be friends, my name is Lan\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He disappeared in a flash before he could finish speaking.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Hmm\u2026 <em>So his name is Lan something? </em></p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>Zan Zichen explained that he originally intended to go to a place called the Mystic Dimension of Grand Clouds, seeking for opportunities to enhance his cultivation. However, he had unfortunately encountered the demonic cultivator midway. He said that the mystic dimension was a boundary of land independent of this world, and it only opened once in a hundred years. It was extremely dangerous there, full of all sorts of demonic beasts and spiritual plants, but risk was accompanied by opportunity. This path was often used to surge in cultivation and ascend to the heavens, but there would always be plenty of those who were never heard from again .</p><br/><p>Due to the problems with Shi Fang Sect, Zan Zichen wanted to go in there and try his luck.</p><br/><p>Yao Si\u2019s interest began to grow when she heard about this so-called mystic dimension. After experiencing that deceiving reward, she did find that her consciousness was now more flexible. She could now release her mental energy outward, and it even appeared to have a trend of beginning to condense into a solid form. Now, all she needed was to exercise it in actual combat.</p><br/><p>So she made an important decision \u2013 to escape.</p><br/><p>She would get rid of a certain group of four people and go to that mystic dimension with Zan Zichen. After all, the four had come here just to make trouble. With them around, she more than likely wouldn\u2019t be able to have the peace of mind to train. Luckily, the demonic cultivator had taken the other exit when leaving the cave, so they didn\u2019t even meet the four that were guarding the mouth of the cave. It was the best time to go solo.</p><br/><p>She discussed it with Zan Zichen, then hailed a swan to bring them to the entrance to the Mystic Dimension.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t too far away, so they flew for less than half an hour before reaching their destination. From a distance, they could already see a lot of people, both men and women, huddled together in groups of three and five, with a few being alone. There were some who were dressed in black, having wrapped themselves up like zongzi, a traditional Chinese rice pudding. Cold and gloomy aura was emitted by them.</p><br/><p>\u201cThose are demonic cultivators,\u201d Zan Zichen explained.</p><br/><p>Yao Si was stupefied. \u201cThen why\u2026\u201d <em>Are they not fighting? Isn\u2019t the generic novels\u2019 plots always centered around the good and evil never being able to coexist? </em></p><br/><p>\u201cThis is the entrance to the Mystic Dimension, so temporarily they aren\u2019t!\u201d Zan Zichen explained. \u201cTo avoid missing the opportunity to get inside the Mystic Dimension, everyone waits here peacefully until they can go inside\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t continue, but if one thought about it, then it was obvious that once everyone went inside, it would be time to quarrel.</p><br/><p>In less than ten minutes after they landed, a bright white light suddenly illuminated the sky. A round door appeared out of nowhere, and if one was attentive, they could see a layer of silver slowly covering the centre of the door like water spreading out in ripples.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s\u2026the Stargate! So the so-called Mystic Dimension goes to another planet?</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Mystic Dimension has opened, quickly!\u201d She didn\u2019t know who said that, but at once, everyone present rode their swords and clouds, rushing through the door one after another.</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior Si?\u201d Zan Zichen turned and looked at her.</p><br/><p>Yao Si hesitated. Although she didn\u2019t know what planet this door led to, but guessing based on the people who\u2019ve been waiting here it should not leave the boundaries of the celestials\u2019 territories. <em>Guess I\u2019ll have to go and see. </em>She decided to send a message to Nephew Gu, informing him of her decision to go solo before stepping through the gate.</p><br/><p>The scenery changed the moment she put her foot down on the other side, the wide grassland having become a forest. The mob fight that she thought would happen when they came in didn\u2019t occur, however. Everyone just scattered away, especially the demonic cultivators. They flew like mad in every direction without stopping, clearly aware that couldn\u2019t stay if they didn\u2019t want to be beat up!</p><br/><p>There were only a few people on the site.</p><br/><p>The instant Yao Si walked out of the Stargate, she received a message in her optical computer.</p><br/><p>[The Galactic Tourism Network informs you that you have reached SP 4, have a pleasant trip!]</p><br/><p>SP 4? The fourth secondary planet of the Shadow Planet? Just as expected, they weren\u2019t teleported too far away.</p><br/><p>\u256e(\u256f\ufe4f\u2570\uff09\u256d</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior, which direction should we go?\u201d Zan Zichen asked.</p><br/><p>Just as Yao Si thought about opening a map, two words suddenly appeared on the navigation system \u2013 Restricted Map. Based on that, she suddenly had a feeling that the danger here wasn\u2019t small at all. She clicked to call the swan, and just as expected, an error message was displayed: Your map has aviation restrictions, so swans are unable to arrive!</p><br/><p>Yep, she didn\u2019t even have any transportation anymore. This left her with not choice but to let Zan Zichen pick a random direction and wander aimlessly with him.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, so where\u2019s the fifth level demonic beast you were talking about?\u201d she asked, having pulled on his sleeve. Only demonic beasts that were over the fifth level would have external consciousness domains, and she needed that to train. It was the only reason she\u2019d come here.</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior, don\u2019t worry, we\u2019re still outside the bounds of the Mystic Dimension,\u201d Zan Zichen explained. \u201cHigh level demonic beasts are all at the centre, so we won\u2019t meet them for the time bei\u2014\u201d</p><br/><p><em>Rawr! </em></p><br/><p>Before he could finish, a roar suddenly came from afar. Large patches of trees fell down right in front of their eyes, and they were surrounded by bird calls. Soon, a gigantic beast appeared not far away, slowly closing in on them.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat voice\u2026 It\u2019s a fifth level cloud-swallowing beast!\u201d Zan Zi Chen exclaim in shock. How could it have appeared so soon?</p><br/><p>\u201cFifth level!\u201d Yao Si\u2019s eyes immediately brightened.</p><br/><p>Zan Zichen was a little worried. \u201cSenioir, a fifth-level demonic beast is equivalent to a cultivator at the peak of Jindan stage. The cloud-swallowing beast is extremely powerful. Its is impenetrable whether you use force or weapon, so they are extremely difficult to deal with.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, leave it with me!\u201d <em>It\u2019s just a small monster! </em>Yao Si hit her chest with one hand, battle thirst lighting up in her heart. \u201cSafe and sound!\u201d</p><br/><p>She took a deep breath and enthusiastically mobilized her mental power. Just as she had wished for an opponent, one instantly came; what a great opportunity to practice! Her eyes followed the lump of shadow in the distance until it got closer, growing in size\u2026</p><br/><p>And then it became two lumps!</p><br/><p>Soon, the two lumps became three, three became a group\u2026</p><br/><p>A second later, she could see a large group of silhouettes running toward them as a rumbling reached their ears and even the ground began to vibrate.</p><br/><p><em>This\u2026 what is this situation? I was promised just one! </em></p><br/><p>(\u2299_\u2299)</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a swarm of cloud-swallowing beasts!\u201d Zan Zichen turned pale. Hesitantly, he turned to her, trying to surreptitiously examine her expression. \u201cSenior\u2026 do we fight?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFight\u2026 Your *ss!\u201d Yao Si didn\u2019t hesitate for a split second. She grabbed the hand of the person next to her while shouting \u201cRun!\u201d</p><br/><p><em>This isn\u2019t a fight, it\u2019s a mass brawl! The demonic beasts here are so unfriendly, starting with a group strike! </em></p><br/><p>Yao Si pulled the person while dashing away madly as the rumbling came closer and closer. The loud stomps made it seem like the ground would flip over at any moment.</p><br/><p>Yao Si\u2019s heart twisted with worry. If she had known this, she wouldn\u2019t have set such a flag. Now, they will either die by being torn apart or trampled to death, there didn\u2019t seem to be a way for them to outrun those beasts.</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior, why don\u2019t we get on the sword?\u201d Zan Zichen asked softly.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si came to a standstill, almost hitting the tree with her head. <em>Damn! </em>She had completely forgotten that there was a pilot with her.</p><br/><p>\u201cUse it, use it! Hurry up and use it!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zan Zichen didn\u2019t waste time and immediately summoned the flying sword and brought her up. Almost at the same time, the forest that was initially beneath their feet was trampled into a flat plain by the large herd of cloud-swallowing beasts, only then was she able to see these creatures clearly.</p><br/><p>They were pitch black all over, looking somewhat like cows but with four pairs of long sharp horns orderly arranged on their head and back. Their hooves were all burning with flames. The creatures themselves were hug, going through the forest like tanks.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe cloud-swallowing beasts never move in groups\u2026\u201d Zan Zi Chen looked with confusion in the direction the herd had come from. \u201cI wonder what happened.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho cares!\u201d Yao Si didn\u2019t care about it at all, being more concerned about the hard won training opportunity that had come knocking on her door but now was nowhere to be seen\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh? There\u2019s one beast that\u2019s staying behind!\u201d</p><br/><p>She pointed at the back. There, a silhouette of the cow-like beast was lurching over. On a closer examination, it was slightly smaller than the rest of the herd, because of which it must\u2019ve fallen behind.</p><br/><p><em>Take the life while it\u2019s weak! </em></p><br/><p>\u201cCome, let\u2019s go scavenging!\u201d Yao Si patted the person next to her with excitement and they flew over in that direction.</p>\n</div>"}

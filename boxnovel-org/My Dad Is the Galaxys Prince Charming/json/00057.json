Can\u2019t we talk about it later?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo!\u201d <em>I know all about your inner wretched thoughts! </em> \u201cListen! First, I don\u2019t harbor any improper thoughts toward Gu Shucheng and see him solely as a younger nephew. Second, I\u2019m a bloodling just like you. Got it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are a bloodling?!\u201d Bai Yi sized her up. \u201cIf you\u2019re a bloodling, why did you enter the academy\u2019s elementary branch?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEr\u2026\u201d Yao Si froze. <em>Why did you have to mention that? </em> \u201cThat\u2026 is complicated, you can see it as me wanting to experience life.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t we receive any notification about a bloodling entering the academy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSince it\u2019s a\u2026 life experience, I deliberately concealed my identity.\u201d Yao Si instantly tossed away the exam result slip which had floated into mind before continuing to explain seriously. \u201cGu Shucheng\u2019s preferential treatment is solely due to my higher rank. He is doing it out of respect.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStop joking around!\u201d Bai Yi wasn\u2019t the least bit convinced. \u201cThere are other bloodlings with higher rank than him in the academy, but he doesn\u2019t revolve around them every day.\u201d <em>He is practically a nanny for you. </em></p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because my rank is a little higher.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhich generation are you from?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si raised a palm with her fingers splayed out. \u201cFifth generation!\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Yi was taken aback at first, then his mouth started to twitch. He probed, \u201cIs your guider perhaps\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMu Xuan!\u201d Yao Si replied decisively. \u201cThat\u2019s why he came on the first day.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Yi sank into silence, sizing her up once more before saying in a daze, \u201cOh\u2026 Oh! I see.\u201d He didn\u2019t think the response was enough, so he nodded firmly, a sharp glint flashing through his gaze as he added, \u201cI understand, I won\u2019t misunderstand anymore. But let\u2019s get Shucheng out first.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si heaved a sigh of relief, but the moment she glanced up, she froze, anger choking her throat.</p><br/><p><em>What do you mean by understand?!</em></p><br/><p>(\u256f\u2035\u25a1\u2032)\u256f\ufe35\u253b\u2501\u253b</p><br/><p>The words above him were:</p><br/><p>[Bai Yi is very confused. He hadn\u2019t known that love could blind someone to the point that they could abandon their race. The girl in front of him had to be crazy from love, even picturing herself as the cub of the bloodling ruler, His Majesty. Ah~ What an insane choice. Ah~ What a devastating love. Ah~ What deep love. Ah~]</p><br/><p>\u201cStop with your ahs!\u201d <em>You\u2019re the crazy one, your entire family is crazy! </em>\u201cI\u2019m really a bloodling.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI understand, I understand!\u201d</p><br/><p><em>What do you understand, listen to me!</em></p><br/><p>\u201cSomeone\u2019s here!\u201d Bai Yi\u2019s face tightened, and he pulled her into the corner.</p><br/><p>A row of people came soon after, but they weren\u2019t like the scattered guards. The group of consisted of about seven people, all dressed in the standard white coats with black cases in their hands. Their gaze were focused ahead as they entered the ship which seemed about to leave.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe need to find Shucheng soon.\u201d Bai Yi\u2019s expression grew serious.</p><br/><p>Yao Si inhaled deeply, suppressing the curses within her. She pointed in the direction from which the group had come. \u201cThe door is there.\u201d She held onto the card tightly, swiping it accurately against the security lock.</p><br/><p>After a bend, they were in a completely different place. The entire area was a sea of white, with white walls and walkways while weak lighting set a grim and bleak atmosphere. There also was a sour stench in the air.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that smell?\u201d Bloodlings had sharp senses, and Yao Si was forced to pinch her nose tight.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s medicine.\u201d Bai Yi frowned. \u201cIs the ventilation here that bad?\u201d He glanced around, pushing up his sleeves. \u201cThis building is rather complex; they may have specifically designed it to mimic a maze. Any wrong move and we will end up in a dead end, triggering an alarm. There\u2019s some people over there, so I\u2019ll use my ability just in case\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTurn right.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?\u201d Bai Yi stilled. To the right, there was another corridor branch. \u201cWhy do you say that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe\u2026\u201d Yao Si\u2019s mouth curled slightly. <em>I glanced above the guy\u2019s head\u2026</em></p><br/><p>[Guard A has been standing at his post for a day. He wishes to sit and rest for a while, but what he doesn\u2019t know is that the guards stationed in the three walkways to the right on the second level are all seated while working!]</p><br/><p>With such clear directions, it would be hard for her not to know, right?</p><br/><p>\u201cI told you I\u2019m a bloodling! It\u2019s normal for me to have special abilities.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Yi frowned, going forth without probing her more.</p><br/><p>Five minutes later.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s another cross road, let me read\u2014\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTurn left!\u201d</p><br/><p>[The guard thought of his parents at home, but he wasn\u2019t aware that on the second floor, after taking a left turn and passing two doors, there were guards who could visit their parents during their time off.]</p><br/><p>On the left turn, the coast was clear.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>After ten minutes.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe passcode here\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c08175\u201d</p><br/><p>[Employee B is an avid fan of lottery. He buys a ticket every day, but he doesn\u2019t know that the passcode for the door, 08715, is also the winning number for today\u2019s Galactic lottery.]</p><br/><p><em>Ding! Access granted!</em></p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>After fifteen minutes.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe electrical trap here\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a switch on the left wall at about 1.9m height.\u201d</p><br/><p>[Dashing and tall employee D prides himself for being 1.88m tall, but he doesn\u2019t know that the company\u2019s corridor closure button is at 1.9m; he\u2019d need heels to reach that height.]</p><br/><p><em>Ding! The trap is disarmed, access granted!</em></p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cPresident Yao.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMmh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m partially convinced you are a bloodling.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh.\u201d <em>I\u2019m anyways.</em></p><br/><p>\u201cCan I ask you something?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs your ability called\u2026 plug-in?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>At that time, Yao Si\u2019s passive ability was more reliable than ever before. It was akin to having an all-rounded navigator. In the beginning, they had to be careful around the guards, but soon, she was met with the words: [Invaders would never know that the exclusive licence card from the equipment room would ensure that they would not be caught]. After that, they abandoned all secrecy, going forth without obstruction. It was as though they had entered an undercover mode which allowed them to reach the fourth floor with ease.</p><br/><p>The entire process was so smooth that they lost the fundamental anxiety of being in the enemy\u2019s lair.</p><br/><p>Until\u2026 they encountered a door which was tightly shut.</p><br/><p>\u201cPresident, how do we open this door?\u201d Bai Yi glanced at her with bright eyes, expecting her to provide him with a solution. Ever since his comrade had activated her plug-in, he had completely given up on using his own brain.</p><br/><p>Yao Si glanced at their empty surroundings. There wasn\u2019t a person in sight, only a door so bright she could see her own reflection, and even the words above her head.</p><br/><p>[Now that Yao Si met with another problem, she was reminded about the amazing ability of Master of Subtitles. She wanted her ability to tell her how to open the door, but what she didn\u2019t know was that even Lord of Subtitles couldn\u2019t figure it out.]</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Is the door hard to open?\u201d Bai Yi couldn\u2019t help rushing her after seeing her lack of progress.</p><br/><p>\u201cWould you believe it if I said that\u2026 the plug-in stopped working?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p>\n</div>"}

So that was how you left the demonic realm, by seducing one of them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey hey hey!\u201d Yao Si could no longer keep it in. \u201cYou\u2019re too much, now\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Junior Geng had no intention of listening to her. He pulled out a talisman and tossed it over at them. \u201cCapture the traitor and the demoness.\u201d</p><br/><p><em>F*ck! Listen to me!</em></p><br/><p>\u201cBe careful of your surroundings Senior Si,\u201d Zan Zichen reminded. \u201cHe\u2019s from the individual series \u2013 spiritual root, so beware of the grass below you.\u201d</p><br/><p>The minute he finished saying that, the ground beneath them started to shake and finger-sized vines sprouted from below. They grew with the wind, swaying towards them.</p><br/><p>Behind the perpetrator, the other members started to gesture weirdly, and the next moment, icicles appeared suspended in mid-air, with rows of transparent swords hanging to the right \u2013 all directed towards them.</p><br/><p>But that wasn\u2019t the main point. Once the man pointed at Yao Si, she felt the familiar energy surging within her. The spiritual root Zan Zichen had mentioned was actually an ability! That was\u2026 great!</p><br/><p>\u201cHey\u2026\u201d Yao Si raised her hand, then took a deep breath and shouted out, \u201cListen to me!\u201d</p><br/><p>A gigantic fire dragon bolted into the skies, a stream of red flames forming behind it. Regardless of whether it was icicles, swords, or the vines, everything turned to ashes. Yao Si only summoned the dragon back after ensuring that everyone\u2019s faces were a soot filled mess. She then added to her previous line, \u201cOr\u2026 I\u2019ll beat you up.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zan Zichen, Junior Geng, and everyone else stared at her silenlty.</p><br/><p><em>You already did it! </em></p><br/><p>\u3012\u25bd\u3012</p><br/><p>Yao Si walked forward, grabbing onto Junior Geng whose face was covered with soot, his hair exploding in all directions. \u201cCan we talk now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSe-Senior!\u201d He coughed while giving a shaky nod. \u201cGeng Zhi was wrong, Geng Zhi hopes to seek your forgiveness.\u201d</p><br/><p>Geng Zhi? This name\u2026 How is he upright?</p><br/><p>She turned to glance at Zan Zichen and beckoned him closer, then pulled them to a seat. \u201cCome come, take a seat! Tell me you story.\u201d</p><br/><p>Thus, he proceeded to tell her all the details. The situation was simple but outrageous. Zan Zichen was originally a second-ranked disciple in Shi Fang sect. He was widely known to be hopeless as the fifth spiritual root, but due to his hard work, he managed to forcefully improve his ability, becoming the strongest among the disciples of the same rank.</p><br/><p>After that, it was heard that the sect\u2019s treasure, the combat transformation pill, disappeared. There were only three people present there at the time \u2013 the sect leader, a senior disciple, and him. Both the sect leader and senior disciple testified against Zan Zichen, claiming his skills grew because of the pill. Because of that, he was exiled to the demonic realm which is equivalent to a death sentence in these parts.</p><br/><p>\u201cNaturally, he should be punished for his hideous crime.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t steal it!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe evidence is clear, how dare you deny, you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEnough enough!\u201d Yao Si interrupted. \u201cDon\u2019t you have evidence, lets clarify once more then.\u201d The crucial witnesses were the sect leader and the elder senior, after all.</p><br/><p>But to call Zan Zichen the thief seemed unbelievable. He was clearly brutally honest. Even though he knew of the dangers he would face, he still insisted on bringing her over. How could such an innocent child have committed a crime?</p>\n</div>"}

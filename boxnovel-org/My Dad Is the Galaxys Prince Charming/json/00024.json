The mountains, the earth, the sky, and the vast red plants were all being wiped away as if a blackboard was being cleaned. It then gradually turned transparent and disappeared in the end. In less than ten seconds, the forest which Yao Si had spent days trying to cross and still weren\u2019t able to leave transformed into a boxy white space under twenty square meters in size.</p><br/><p>Less than two steps behind here were dozens of \u201cGluttony\u201d opening their gigantic flower maws. But they were all trapped inside glass pillars, and she could faintly see white ice blades in their insides, not melted.</p><br/><p>This\u2026What was happening here?</p><br/><p>Yao Si froze on the spot, unable to regain her senses for a long while.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, what a pity.\u201d Qu Ze tossed the little purple orb in his hand with a regretful look. \u201cI still have dozens of foreign plants, which I brought back from other planets, that haven\u2019t been tested.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTest?\u201d Yao Si\u2019s mouth twitched, a rising fury surging from the bottom of her heart. \u201cYou mean\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe weren\u2019t transported to a forest?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere were no cannibal plants?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere were no human binding trees?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd we weren\u2019t almost stabbed into sieves?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you\u2019ve been fooling me around the entire time?\u201d She took a deep breath.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes\u2026 Ahh, don\u2019t say it so harshly, your highness.\u201d Qu Ze switched back to the simple-minded look in a second, but the sense of innocence was missing from his eyes. \u201cIsn\u2019t everyone trying to welcome you with your return to our kind? I, as one of the great elders, wanted to express my friendliness and made a harmless joke.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHarmless!\u201d Yao Si felt that the string called \u2018reason\u2019 snap in her mind. She clenched her fingers into a fist and swung it right at his face. \u201cQu Ze! Screw your grandmother!\u201d</p><br/><p>For the past few days, she had really treated him like a newbie, putting her own life on the line to save him. Yet in the end he told her that it was all for a test, that all of it was fake, f*ck!</p><br/><p><em>If I don\u2019t beat you until your mother can\u2019t recognize you, then my last name isn\u2019t Yao!</em></p><br/><p>\u201cYour highness.\u201d Qu Ze was still smiling brilliantly, as if he couldn\u2019t be bothered to treat her fist seriously. He flicked his finger and two vines suddenly burst out from the ground, winding around Yao Si\u2019s flying punch.\u201dA gentleman uses his tongue, not his fists. You can\u2019t hit me with\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Bam!</p><br/><p>The next moment, an angry fist smashed fiercely into his face. Qu Ze felt his nose becoming heavy, and two streams of vividly red liquid ran down his face.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow\u2026 How is this possible?\u201d His eyes widened, and he revealed an expression filled with disbelief.</p><br/><p>Yao Si didn\u2019t have time to explain it to him. Her punches fell incessantly, like raindrops, onto him, and they were all aiming for the face and any other place that hurt most. The fury in the depth of Yao Si\u2019s heart exploded with full force, burning all her reason, forgiveness, and demeanor of an elder to hell. There was only one thought left in her mind, punch that asshole!</p><br/><p>\u201cWait wait\u2026 How can you, ouch!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t only aim for the face, hurts hurts hurts\u2026 Ah.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, sorry, isn\u2019t that enough\u2026 Wait, can you not kick there.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAwhhhh~~~~\u201d</p><br/><p>At that instance, the entire room was echoing with someone\u2019s soul-stirring screams.</p><br/><p>When Yao Si no longer had the energy to throw another punch, the burning anger within her heart finally dissipated a little. She then stopped, inhaled a deep breath, then kicked the person on the ground again. \u201cSpit it, what do you really want?\u201d</p><br/><p>She had no old feuds or new hates with him, so she didn\u2019t believe for a second that he\u2019d wasted so much effort of dragging her here just for some bloody experiment.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour highness\u2026\u201d Qu Ze\u2019s originally goblin-like beautiful face was now swollen, reminding of a pig. He tried with great effort to get up but was unable to stand, so he could only sit on the ground. He wanted to squeeze out an innocent expression, but it caused the injuries on his face to throb and he inhaled sharply. \u201cHawl kan yau doo dis, Qu Ze sow apsit. (How can you do this, Qu Ze so upset).\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si lifted the corner of her mouth and rolled her eyes at him. \u201cI was only making a harmless joke at you too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUm\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough, stop pretending.\u201d If she ever fell for it again, then she\u2019d be an idiot. \u201cSay it, what do you really want.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qu Ze was stupefied. He put away the merry expression and looked straight into her eyes, as if trying to make sure of something. After staring for a long time, he lowered his voice and asked, \u201cYou really want to know the reason?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si felt a little uncomfortable being stared at by him, but she had no way to escape it, so she nodded firmly again. \u201cSay it!\u201d <em>Let\u2019s see what story you can come up with this time!</em></p><br/><p>\u201cOkay!\u201d He nodded, slowly stood up, and raised his head to look directly in to her eyes. He was so close that they were almost touching, and standing like that he clearly spelled out his next four words. \u201cI. Don\u2019t. Like. You!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha\u2026\u201dYao Si sneered, pushing away the pig-head in front of her. \u201cWhat a coincidence, me too!\u201d</p><br/><p>His face turned rigid for a second, but then he continued, \u201cI received the notice, that\u2019s why I had to travel thousands of miles, all the way from another galaxy, to rush back. I was researching a very important project at that time, but I was forced to stop and return just because you\u2019re a fifth-generation bloodling.\u201d His swollen eyes were filled with displeasure. \u201cHow ridiculous, why should I? Just because we\u2019re of younger generation, we must set everything aside and hold you above everything?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be a joke. What have you done for us bloodlings? Do you have any major contributions? Who decided that I must be friendly to you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI am an elder of the thirtieth generation and can count as one of the oldest of us.\u201d The corner of his lips turned upwards as he caressed the purple orb in his hand. \u201cFrom the Zergs to the fourth Union of the current galaxy, I\u2019ve lived for hundreds of thousands of years. Every battle of the bloodlings, every catastrophe I witnessed, because I am a thirtieth generation bloodling, that\u2019s my duty. I\u2019ve guarded the bloodlings for so many years\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He took a long breath, then tilted his head and looked at the white room. \u201cEveryone in our kind is like this, even thirteen is like this. We\u2019re trying to make the bloodlings a better race, that\u2019s why\u2026 I\u2019m thegreat elder of our kind. But you, what do you deserve?\u201d</p><br/><p>He looked at her with great defiance. \u201cYou\u2019ve been hibernating for tens of billions of years, you\u2019re only an outsider who relies upon her antique bloodline to assume great airs. You\u2019ve not done a single thing for the bloodlings, why should we recognize you as our ancestor? Address you as you as \u2018your highness\u2019?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t even know your background, your character, and you don\u2019t even know the most basic language of the galaxy.\u201d His brows knotted when he exhaled. \u201cYes! I did offend you, but as the great elder, I must do it for the bloodlings. I must make sure your arrival won\u2019t affect the entire bloodling race. If you really want to call me accountable for this, then I\u2019m willing to accept your disposition. Even if it means that my bloodline will be canceled and I\u2019ll fall into eternal sleep.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEternal sleep?\u201d Yao Si was surprised. Eternal sleep was capital sentence. Due to the special physique of the bloodlings, they were immune to all harm but the attacks of their own kind. If they were killed by their own, then that was really death, and the bloodlings called this method eternal sleep.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a fifth-generation bloodling, naturally you have the right to exercise this privilege, even if it is without reason.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh\u2026\u201d Yao Si looked at him from top to the bottom, the powerful self-healing ability of the bloodlings had already healed half of the damage to his pig head. She stood up and flicked the dust off her clothes, then with a cold expression said carelessly, \u201cThen you can go to eternal sleep now!\u201d</p>\n</div>"}

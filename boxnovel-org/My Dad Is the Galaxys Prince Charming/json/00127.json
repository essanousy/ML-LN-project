Fortunately, the virus carrying meteorites weren\u2019t as contagious as everyone had expected. After all, the virus wasn\u2019t airborne.</p><br/><p>Ever since the beginning, Li Zheng\u2019s motives had never been to kill off the bloodling race with the virus. He had only been targeting Yao Si so that Mu Xuan would be triggered and destroy everything.</p><br/><p>Thanks to the persistent efforts of the bloodlings, the virus was thoroughly eradicated. The Alliance troops who had joined in the fight didn\u2019t leave unscathed either. Without Li Zheng\u2019s mental strength suppressing the bloodlings, they had gone all out with revenge.</p><br/><p>In order to defend against the misuse of the doomsday virus for evil, the Elders started to mass produce the vaccine. Mu Xuan mentioned that it had been created a long time ago or the bloodlings would have never lasted that long. However, ever since they had entered the Galactic period, the doomsday virus vanished, rendering the vaccine unnecessary.</p><br/><p>It was, however, not the end for Euphoria. Bloodlings weren\u2019t people who easily let go\u2014those who offended them would definitely be repaid the favor! This had always been their motto. Even though Euphoria\u2019s head was Li Zheng, many other races had played important roles in it. The final battle had publicly exposed the organization to the world, and in time, every single soul would be caught.</p><br/><p>Qu Ze grabbed such a perfect opportunity to act presumptuously and started to spread havoc! Not one race was left untouched. He even called for war against the races who had participated actively in the fight.</p><br/><p>This made the Galaxy remember that even though the bloodlings acted neutral about the worldly affairs, they were never afraid!</p><br/><p>Both Yao Si and Mu Xuan steered clear of it, however. Neither of them participated in such matters, entrusting them to the Elders Council. In truth, Mu Xuan had tossed away all his duties, even chasing Qu Ze away when he had come to report about the latest happenings.</p><br/><p>He dedicated his time to being a good and wholehearted father.</p><br/><p>[News: There was a large scale explosion at W985, which is at the edge of the Galaxy. There was a total of 368 asteroids, 187 of which were destroyed. Among them were three stars and fifty-seven satellites\u2026 This explosion caused millions of species to go extinct and unparalleled damage. Fortunately, there weren\u2019t any fatalities. Currently, the source of explosion still remains a mystery! Please take a look below for the latest update from the civilized planets nearby\u2026]</p><br/><p>Yao Si grimaced. Her heart sank as the scenes flashed through the screen. She then turned to glance at the culprit.</p><br/><p>\u201cMu Xuan\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMmh?\u201d He lifted his head to look at her, his gaze bright and deep.</p><br/><p>\u201cEr\u2026 nothing!\u201d <em>Whatever makes you happy.</em></p><br/><p>He continued to look at her calmly as though he hadn\u2019t hear the news report. Instead, he focused on pushing wayward strands of hair behind her ear before passing her a drink.</p><br/><p>He sat down beside her and pulled her into his embrace.</p><br/><p>Yao Si was at a loss, but she had already given up on resisting. Ever since they came back, he was a changed person, craving desperately for closeness, always pulled her into his embrace. If she left his sight for more than five minutes, he would definitely appear before her the next moment.</p><br/><p>He was\u2026 a complete nanny dad from hell.</p><br/><p>Yao Si, his victim, could only to get used to it\u2026</p><br/><p>\u256e(\u256f\ufe4f\u2570\uff09\u256d</p><br/><p>She had slept for five short minutes, but he nearly destroyed the entire Galaxy. She couldn\u2019t imagine what the situation would have been like if she had awakened any later\u2026</p><br/><p>Bloodlings were indeed the race which loved their cubs the most, one could even say to the point of insanity. It was hard to imagine how a kind and friendly being such as Li Zheng could have ended up at the state he was in because of the loss of a cub.</p><br/><p>That daunting experience had fortunately ended without much trouble, but Yao Si couldn\u2019t figure out how she had managed to survive.</p><br/><p>\u201cMu Xuan, are the test results out yet?\u201d</p><br/><p>After they had returned, Mu Xuan had anxiously led her to the research center for a full checkup with almost all the tests available. Only after multiple reassurances that she was fine and healthy did he finally heave a sigh of relief.</p><br/><p>As for the reason for her survival, they had to wait till the results were out.</p><br/><p>Mu Xuan switched open his optical computer, and right then a message popped out. It held her tests results.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow is it, how is it?\u201d Yao Si leaned over, watching as he opened the file. Her heart started to race even though they already had a rough idea about it. Mu Xuan mentioned that he had once experienced a similar incident during the doomsday war period. Back then, he had awakened his ancestral bloodline. Since she was his cub, it\u2026</p><br/><p>Yao Si pulled the document out to look at the last row stating her bloodline \u2013 Fifth Generation!</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Why was she still a fifth-generation bloodling? Where was the promised prowess? She hadn\u2019t awakened the ancestral bloodline, so how did she awaken?</p><br/><p>\u201cNo worries.\u201d Mu Xuan caressed her head, pulling the document back to the front page to take a closer look at every line. As he read, his frown deepened. As a thought struck him, he turned toward her with a troubled expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d The screen was filled with data, but there shouldn\u2019t be anything wrong, right? Why then did he look in pain, as though there was much to be said?</p><br/><p>\u201cSisi\u2026\u201d He paused, trying to figure out how to speak the question before continuing, \u201cDo you remember\u2026 how you became a bloodling?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t remember?\u201d She straightened. What\u2019s with this sudden question? \u201cDidn\u2019t you ask this before? I just suddenly no longer wanted spicy food and switched to duck blood curd.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBefore that, did you experience\u2026 anything big?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNope!\u201d She shook her head.</p><br/><p>\u201cNothing at all?\u201d he verified once more. \u201cCar accident, natural disaster, or any major injuries?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNone at all!\u201d She used to be a homebody who barely left her place. \u201cI told you before, I have no idea when I was converted by you.\u201d <em>Didn\u2019t you forget it as well?</em></p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not asking about that.\u201d He sighed and glanced at her with a grave look. \u201cSisi, do you know how\u2026 earthlings are converted into bloodlings?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBy the transfusion of blood.\u201d Wasn\u2019t that common knowledge?</p><br/><p>\u201cHow else?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh?\u201d <em>There\u2019s more to the conversion process?</em></p><br/><p>\u201cAfter the transfusion of blood, the earthling has to experience something before turning into a bloodling.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSomething?\u201d What something?</p><br/><p>\u201cDeath!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOnly when the earthling self dies will one embark to be a full-fledged bloodling. That is the true process of conversion!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou mean\u2026.\u201d Yao Si was slightly confused. \u201cAfter the blood transfer, one can only become a blooding after dying?\u201d</p><br/><p>He nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not right, I didn\u2019t die, I just suddenly changed\u2026\u201d She stopped mid-sentence and inhaled sharply as understanding struck her. Wide-mouthed, she turned toward Mu Xuan. \u201cYou mean\u2026 I have been an earthling all this while and only just converted?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>All these years, she had been a fake bloodling!</p><br/><p>(\u256f\u2035\u25a1\u2032)\u256f\ufe35\u253b\u2501\u253b</p></div>\n</div>"}

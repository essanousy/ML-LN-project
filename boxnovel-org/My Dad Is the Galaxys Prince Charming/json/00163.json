Surprisingly, she could breathe normally while submerged in the blood pool. Even though it seemed like a liquid, it felt as light as air. With the pervert clearing the way, the fluid lost all of its aggression, slipping past her as smoothly as silk.</p><br/><p>Shortly after, they were at the heart of the fluid. Suddenly, a black patch appeared before them. The area emitted an eerie and sinister vibe, it\u2026 was the portal Yao Si had seen on the Heavenly Planet!</p><br/><p>Her heart sank, and she took a few steps back. But with a forceful tug, the man pulled her forward, and the momentary imbalance knocked her off her feet. Just before she smashed into the ground, the pervert seemed to have sensed it, and like a gust of wind, he caught her.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you blind? Can\u2019t you walk properly?\u201d He spat the moment he opened his mouth while glancing her up and down. \u201cHurry up! This old man won\u2019t care even if you injure yourself.\u201d</p><br/><p>He turned and continued with dragging her forward. Still, it seemed like he had slowed down slightly.</p><br/><p>The pervert brought them into the black portal, and Yao Si felt a shiver run through her. The next second, light poured over them, the glaring glow invading her eyes, forcing them shut.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re here!\u201d the pervert announced, finally releasing his grip on her.</p><br/><p>Yao Si opened her eyes cautiously. They were in a fully furnished room that had been tided so meticulously that she could even see her reflection on the ground. The place was clearly meant for a long term stay.</p><br/><p>Why did the pervert bring her here?</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be staying here until I finish my experiment!\u201d He pointed toward the room before sweeping a glance at her. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, since you are the contractor, I won\u2019t touch you, but you better not mess around or\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He smirked threateningly, but when compared to the sinister demeanor from before, it fell short and skewed more toward\u2026 a false bravado.</p><br/><p>A strange thought emerged in Yao Si\u2019s heard. Perhaps his tolerance towards a \u2018contractor\u2019\u2026 was quite high?!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat exactly is a contractor?\u201d she asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know?!\u201d He stilled, glancing at her as though she was retarded.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201dEr, was she supposed to know?</p><br/><p>He waved his hand, not intending to explain. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you ask the pure breed next time? I have no intention to educate others.\u201d He glanced at the time on the optical computer. \u201cI\u2019m busy. We aren\u2019t on the Red Planet anymore, so you better stay here obediently and don\u2019t stir up any trouble.\u201d</p><br/><p>He gave her another warning look before turning to leave the room. The second he reached the door, he turned abruptly, his face scrunched up. After half a minute, he clenched his jaw and cursed under his breath, \u201cF**k.\u201d</p><br/><p>He returned to the room, found a control table on the right and started to retrieve a bunch of items from it. He placed everything in front of Yao Si.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s duck blood curd snacks, have them when you are hungry.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThese are galactic novels, read them when you are bored.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThese are games I downloaded. You can play them if you want to.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThese are soft pillows, they\u2019ll prevent a sore neck.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd this a flexible pet. You can alter its appearance to your preference!\u201d</p><br/><p>He then stuffed a woollen rabbit about the size of a dog into her embrace.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, that\u2019s all. If you need anything else, just let me know.\u201d He exhaled deeply as though having accomplished something grand and folded his arms to look at her inquisitively.</p><br/><p>Half a minute later\u2026 the corners of Yao Si\u2019s lips twitched. She recalled the question she had been inching to ask since a while ago.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cY-you\u2019re sick, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wasn\u2019t she a hostage? Why did he feel more like a nanny?</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>The pervert had issues, serious issues. It was the weirdest experience since she had been kidnapped to the foreign planet. From the moment of her arrival, he had been treating her unlike a captive that she had envisioned. No! It was the opposite extreme!. Rather than being called a hostage, it would be more appropriate to call her an ancestor, the kind that was worshiped.</p><br/><p>He tended to even the most minute issues, taking extremely good care of her! Even though his words could be harsh and he often put on a scary front, he would answer any of her requests. He was so unbelievably obliging that it brought her back to\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you f*cking retarded?\u201d He bolted into the room like a tornado/ \u201cDidn\u2019t I already prepare food? What do you mean by only craving for \u2018spiritual beast blood curd\u2019? Will it kill you to eat something else? Don\u2019t you know my experiment is currently in a crucial stage so I can\u2019t be disturbed? How can you call for me at such a time? Are you seeking death?\u201d He seemed like a firecracker that had been lit up as he jumped about in exasperation.</p><br/><p>Then, with a loud thud, he slammed a bottle of the Red Planet\u2019s hot seller\u2014\u2019spiritual beast blood curd\u2019.</p><br/><p>-_-|||</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Yao Si completely disregarded his rage, gulping the entire bottle down in one go. <em>Mmh, not bad! </em> With just one sip, she could tell that it had been manufactured just that day. \u201cOh right, pervert, did you only bring one bottle?\u201d She swept a suspicious glance at him.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy name is Lin Long! Haven\u2019t I already told it to you a thousand times? If you call me pervert one more time, I\u2019m going to make you perish!\u201d</p><br/><p>He grew increasingly aggravated. It looked as though smoke was about to emit from his head at any moment. Even so, he didn\u2019t forget to retrieve another three identical bottles of \u2018spiritual beast blood curd\u2019 from his optical computer\u2019s storage. With another thud, he slammed them in front of her once more. \u201cI hope it kills you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si immediately unscrewed another bottle; she was starving. She seemed to have gotten immune to Lin Long\u2019s continuous threats.</p><br/><p>She gulped down the three bottles, but just as she was about to reach for the last bottle, he snatched it away.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you really intend to kill yourself?!\u201d He glared at her while unscrewing the bottle. \u201cAre you dumb? This drink is \u2018cooling\u2019, so you\u2019re going to die from diarrhoea!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m a bloodling, so how can I die from diarrhoea?!\u201d Yao Si rolled her eyes before sweeping a look of disdain at the other dishes. \u201cBesides, what\u2019s with all this fast food? Back at home, Mu Xuan would always cook my meals yet I didn\u2019t once complain to you. Who are you to pity me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGet lost, why should I pamper you when I\u2019m not even your contractor?\u201d Lin Long downed the bottle in his hand and turned to the chair at the side for an apron before fastening it around himself. \u201cAre you the only one with a contractor? Are you guys the only ones that can cook? Heh! What\u2019s the big deal with knowing how to cook? I can cook too! Today, I\u2019ll have you dumb bastard open your eyes and understand the true meaning of culinary skills.\u201d After saying that, he busied himself in the kitchen.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u256e(\u256f\ufe4f\u2570\uff09\u256d</p><br/><p>Such upright behavior\u2026 Was he alright?</p><br/><p>Yao Si sighed, turning to look at the busy figure. She then said, \u201cI want it extra spicy!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShut up!\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

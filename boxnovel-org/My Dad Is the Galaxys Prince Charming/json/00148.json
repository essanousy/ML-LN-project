She wasn\u2019t satisfied with a wasted trip. However, she realized that she wouldn\u2019t be able to remain for long.</p><br/><p>Because\u2026 she was about to be buried in the Galactic currency. Ever since the news about the pregnancy had erupted and operations were terminated temporarily, the employees were left idle. Their attitude toward her were of two extremes: one half would bolt at the sight of her while the other would use all means to get close to her. Te latter would always approached her in pairs.</p><br/><p>Regardless of how much Yao Si explained, everyone still carried on with the misconception, seeing her as a celestial that everyone wanted to get hold of.</p><br/><p>With groups of couples chasing after her, even using the toilet was a challenge. Yao Si was at her wits end as she hid at home. But that couldn\u2019t stop the passionate requests for her blessings. It started escalating from a casual touch to tossing galactic currency in her direction. Whats was worst was the thick stacks they tossed. In less than three days, her yard was flooded with golden shimmery galactic money, to the point that even the grass could no longer be seen.</p><br/><p>o(\u256f\u25a1\u2570)o</p><br/><p>Please! She wasn\u2019t a wishing well nor a fertility goddess!</p><br/><p>Yao Si was rendered helpless. Once the galactic police settled the issue, she immediately took off on Lu Chen\u2019s aircraft. The moment they left the Ore Planet, she sighed, a weight finally having been lifted from her shoulders.</p><br/><p>She was finally out of there! Any longer and they would have started to offer her joss sticks!</p><br/><p>\u201cBoss, the Alliance has taken care of the rebellion,\u201d Lu Chen said while opening a screen professionally. \u201cThe beasts are willing to compensate the damages incurred on the Ore Planet. All the necessary works will be completed within the next month.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Yao Si had no clue what he was saying. \u201cLu Chen, why don\u2019t you just do whatever you deem is best. Besides, haven\u2019t you always been in charge of the planet\u2019s operations? You can just continue what you have been doing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, boss!\u201d Lu Chen nodded. He then pointed to the screen once more. \u201cOne more thing, even though the beasts have agreed to compensate us for the loss, the damage caused to our reputation is posing a much greater problem.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Yao Si stilled.</p><br/><p>\u201cDue to the incident, we weren\u2019t able to fulfil three shipments punctually and these three clients happen to be our most important clients.\u201d His expression turned grave. \u201cThe late shipment cost them huge losses, prompting them to terminate their cooperation with us. This will reduce our profits by up to 80%!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat much! Er\u2026 Are you trying to tell me that I\u2019m about to go bankrupt?\u201d Don\u2019t do this\u2026 It hasn\u2019t been that long since I discovered my newfound fortune! How can it disappear in a few months?!</p><br/><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t to that extent!\u201d Lu Chen shook his head. \u201cI held several meetings with the various departments and reported back to the headquarters. With them, we decided to have an emergency change of plans which would probably cover some losses!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the plan?\u201d Yao Si asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe bought the Galactic web headlines for the next three months.\u201d Lu Chen\u2019s eyes brightened, and he reached out to tap the screen. The next moment, a blinding headliner jumped out instantly.</p><br/><p>[Can\u2019t conceive? Same sex marriages? Fertility issues? Shocking: In the Ore Planet on Galactic T, District 95, a mythical work of fate has occurred. A 35-year-old male was able to conceive twins asexually! Professionals have spoken, and this could be due to the special effects of the ores on the Ore Planet.

Wasn\u2019t it a fertility advertisement? Weren\u2019t the ores harvested here for mental strength? When did they become a treatment for fertility problems? Isn\u2019t it just a marketing scam?</p><br/><p>\u201cWill this advertisement really work!\u201d You got to be kidding me!</p><br/><p>\u201cWithin five days of the release\u2026 order requests for the next five years have been completely filled out.\u201d There was barely no excess space on the screen to tap.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Tell me! How many gays are there in the Galaxy? Do you dare to provide the real number?!</p><br/><p>\u201cIn the future, we intend to open up the Ore Planet for leisure, and the tourists will be charged according to the duration of their stay. Reservations will be made through the Galactic web! There would also be membership point exchange services,\u201d Lu Chen added enthusiastically as he pulled out a stack of proposals. \u201cAccording to the current calculations, in less than half a year, the Ore Planet will definitely become the hottest new addition to the planet tour.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201dF*ck, you did the budgeting already?!</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry boss, I instructed the various departments to stop spreading the truth behind Feng Xiao\u2019s pregnancy. You won\u2019t be exposed!\u201d Lu Chen slammed his chest confidently. \u201cBut\u2026 boss, if you\u2019re free, could you help me write a few blessings? I want to sell them as limited edition amulets. You don\u2019t have to write much since it isn\u2019t for mass production. Just a few like \u2018blessing you with many children\u2019 or something similar along the those lines!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLu Chen\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMmh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI finally understand how the Lu Family earned their fortune!\u201d</p><br/><p>Their money making ability was\u2026 over the charts!</p><br/><p>\u201cAh?\u201d Lu Chen glanced at her nonchalantly as he continued to introduce the other products.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, an alarm went off!</p><br/><p>[Warning! Foreign aircraft located, unable to detect registration data.]</p><br/><p>[Warning! Foreign aircraft located, unable to detect registration data.]</p><br/><p>What\u2019s this situation?!</p><br/><p>Yao Si froze. A gigantic aircraft suddenly appeared before them. It was about five times the size of their aircraft and was unlike anything they had seen before.</p><br/><p>It was shaped like a gigantic lotus and seemed to be opening up petal by petal in their direction while its core glowed brightly.</p><br/><p>What\u2019s that?</p><br/><p>(\u2299_\u2299)</p><br/><p>\u201cFlower of the Heavenly Tree?\u201d the silent Mu Xuan suddenly exclaimed.</p><br/><p>Flower?</p><br/><p>Yao Si stilled. That big thing was really a flower?! Not an aircraft?</p><br/><p>The alarm intensified as large petals suddenly multiplied across the screen. They seemed almost alive, floating out of the screen and filling the entire aircraft.</p><br/><p>\u201cMu Xuan,this\u2026 this\u2026\u201d Yao Si\u2019s heart clenched, and she grabbed onto Mu Xuan\u2019s arm instinctively.</p><br/><p>She had a bad feeling about it!</p></div>\n</div>"}

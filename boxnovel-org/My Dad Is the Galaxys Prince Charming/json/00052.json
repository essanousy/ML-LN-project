Yao Si covered her ears instinctively, feeling as though the roof was going to collapse.</p><br/><p>\u201cGod Mu! It\u2019s God Mu!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always heard that God Mu is the Principal of Galactic Academy, but I never took it seriously.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn the seven years I\u2019ve been here, it\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve seen him in real life.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAhahahahah\u2026 I must be dreaming!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSomeone, punch me. Someone with an ability.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si stood speechless. She finally caught a glimpse of the world without his mental adjustments.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Majesty!\u201d All the bloodlings on the right greeted Mu Xuan.</p><br/><p>\u201cMmh.\u201d He nodded in response.</p><br/><p>After a closer look, Yao Si realized that there was someone behind him \u2013 a bearded old man and another middle-aged one dressed in the standard teacher uniform. He was probably one of the academy\u2019s teachers.</p><br/><p>\u201cPrincipal\u2026 Mu, this is where the opening ceremony is held.\u201d</p><br/><p>The middle-aged man moved his hand away as he introduced the hall with a smile. There was a glazed look, one with a hint of dreaminess, on his face.</p><br/><p>Galactic Academy had been established more than a thousand years ago and the bloodlings had produced the initial funds for it, so their ruler was always considered as the principal. It was mostly for symbolic purposes, so the middle-aged man had never expected the royal personage to actually come one day to inspect the school.</p><br/><p><em>Right, I must be dreaming.</em></p><br/><p>Mu Xuan disregarded him, heading straight towards Yao Si.</p><br/><p>Glancing at the endless chatter in the audience, he frowned and growled, \u201cSilence!\u201d</p><br/><p>His voice wasn\u2019t loud, to the point that it was negligible to those who weren\u2019t paying attention, but it possessed an undercurrent of mental strength that made it echo in every corner of the hall, reach everyone\u2019s ears.</p><br/><p>The whole hall sunk into silence.</p><br/><p>Mu Xuan turned away in satisfaction. He came to Yao Si and caressed her head out of habit. In a much warmer voice, he told her, \u201cI think you\u2019re suitable.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSui-table!\u201d the audience repeated after him.</p><br/><p>The next instant, the votes under her name rose, and Gu Shucheng\u2019s votes dropped to zero.</p><br/><p><em>F**k! A bunch of dumb fans! </em></p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>Unexpectedly, Yao Si had become the president of the student union. At the thought of it, she could feel her insides collapsing. Moments after entering she had successfully garnered the hatred of the entire student body. It didn\u2019t take a lot of imagination to foresee how dreadful her future school life was going to be.</p><br/><p>When she was about to leave home the next morning, she had an impulse to skip school entirely. After deliberating at the door for a long while, she still couldn\u2019t head out. What should she do? The election was indeed exciting, but what about her future?! Should she transfer elsewhere?</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you want me to accompany you?\u201d the main culprit asked.</p><br/><p>Yao Si immediately took a large step forward. \u201cIt\u2019s okay!\u201d <em>That\u2019ll make everything even worse!</em></p><br/><p>She dragged her heavy heart toward the academy, preparing to face unending judgment, but instead\u2026 the situation was a little off? No! It was totally different from what she expected!</p><br/><p>\u201cHi, President!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHi\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHi, President!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHi\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHi, President!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHi\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Almost every student she passed greeted her politely. The disgust and judgment from before had somehow morphed into excitement.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right, excitement! It was as though they could barely resist pouncing on her! It sent chills down her spine.</p><br/><p>What\u2019s with the situation? Were the students in Galactic Academy of such high moral values? How could they be so civil to this president that popped up out of nowhere?</p><br/><p>She was met with herds of enthusiastic and friendly students. Some of them even followed behind her, the group growing larger and larger as everyone within it stared at her with excitement filled eyes. In just a short few minutes, there was already a large following behind her.</p><br/><p>Filled with confusion, Yao Si entered her classroom.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2019s here, she\u2019s here!\u201d someone announced the moment she entered.</p><br/><p>Instantly, she was surrounded by yet another huge crowd.</p><br/><p>\u201cPresident Yao, you\u2019re finally here!\u201d A familiar looking female dressed in a long pale dress walked over. Yao Si lifted her eyes toward her hair. Wasn\u2019t she the girl with two buns the day before?</p><br/><p>\u201cHello,\u201d she greeted her. It seemed like they were classmates.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello, hello!\u201d The girl was visibly agitated, but the forcefulness from the day before had disappeared. With a frighteningly bright glow in her eyes, she said, \u201cI-I\u2019m Chu Jing, we\u2019re both in class 3D.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cChu Jing, I\u2019m Yao\u2014\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know, I know!\u201d Chu Jing interrupted enthusiastically. \u201cYou\u2019re Yao Si, our president! Everyone knows you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStudent Yao, could I trouble you with something?\u201d she asked carefully.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCa-ca-can I touch your hair?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Yao Si\u2019s face stiffened. <em>Are you kidding? What kind of a request is that?</em>\u201cYou\u2026 can\u2026 But\u2014\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you!\u201d Chu Jing suddenly bowed deeply, her eyes lighting up even more.</p><br/><p>Er\u2026Was touching her hair worth such excitement?</p><br/><p>The girl took a deep breath before slowly lifting her hand towards the tip of Yao Si\u2019s head. At that moment, the originally calm girl seemed to have contacted the Parkinson\u2019s disease, for her hands were trembling uncontrollably. After a long while, she finally came into contact with Yao Si\u2019s head. She then instantly brought her hand back.</p><br/><p>Ahhhhh!!!</p><br/><p>A sharp shriek pierced the air.</p><br/><p>Chu Jing screamed at the top of her lungs as she clenched onto her chest. After her banshee moment, she muttered while panting, \u201cI touched it, I touched it! I touched the hair that Mu Xuan touched. AHHHHHHH!\u201d</p><br/><p>Huh?</p><br/><p>-_-|||</p><br/><p>The girl was panting rapidly. When she could no longer handle the excitement, her head tilted to the side, and she passed out.</p><br/><p>\u201cChu Jing!\u201d Yao Si exclaimed, but just as she was about to help the girl up, the surrounding crowd squeezed in. After someone had taken the lead, the others anxiously requested the same.</p><br/><p>\u201cPresident, can I touch it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMe too, it seems like an indirect handshake with God Mu! Ahahah, I\u2019m excited!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t just a handshake. President was beside him for such a long time, we might be breathing the same air as Mu Xuan right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOur President is the only one in a few centuries that has had intimate contact with God Mu, I\u2019m so excited!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, God Mu actually touched our President\u2019s head! Ahahah! I need to announce this to the entire Galaxy!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re so lucky to be classmates with President!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt feels like I picked up a billion Galactic coins!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si stared at them, speechless.</p><br/><p><em>Excuse me!</em></p><br/><p>So\u2026 that was the reason behind their friendliness?</p><br/><p><em>Could you guys just get over it, someone just fainted!</em></p><br/><p><em>Besides, how could the main takeaway from yesterday\u2019s election be her dad touching her head?</em></p><br/><p>She seemed to have turned into a lucky charm, what a burden!</p><br/><p>\u25cb|\uffe3|_</p>\n</div>"}

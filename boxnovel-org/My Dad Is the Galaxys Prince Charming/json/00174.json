She glanced at the black portals ahead. Since they were all at their wit\u2019s end, she could only go all out!</p><br/><p>Yao Si inhaled deeply, gathering the power that was accumulating within her. With the previous horrid experiences with her ability, she didn\u2019t just unleash all the power at once. Instead, she raised a cautious hand upwards, letting just a little out. As expected, a spiral appeared, which was about the size of her palm.</p><br/><p>Joy spread through her; she knew about her space ability. Mu Xuan had mentioned that her space ability was a counter which meant that she could retrieve anything that was sucked into a portal.</p><br/><p>Bai Yi had been right. The two powers would counteract each other, eradicating themselves in the process. Once she opened the portal to counteract the black hole in front of her, they could leave with ease.</p><br/><p>Besides, there wasn\u2019t anyone unleashing anything else here, so there wasn\u2019t anything else that could be countered. The worst scenario was for the checkpoint to reappear, but there wasn\u2019t going to be any other problem\u2026</p><br/><p>Most likely?!</p><br/><p>Yao Si\u2019s nerves were strung tight as she enlarged the portal gradually/ Soon after, it was almost the size of the hidden portal.</p><br/><p>Once it fully opened, the devouring black hole stopped as they had predicted. Its power started to diminish as well.</p><br/><p>Success!</p><br/><p>Yao Si\u2019s heart trembled, but she continued to focus on the devouring portal as it grew smaller. It was only when it had completely disappeared into the one she had created that she finally relaxed. Waving her hands, she stopped using her ability.</p><br/><p><em>Great, great! There weren\u2019t any mishaps this time, so my counter ability was\u2026 </em></p><br/><p>\u201cAh!\u201d</p><br/><p>Just as she was in the mid of her exhale, the portal that had closed up reopened once again with a loud thud that sounded like bones cracking. The black portal was spat out together with a human figure.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Useful\u2026 was it?!</p><br/><p>(\u256f\u2035\u25a1\u2032)\u256f\ufe35\u253b\u2501\u253b</p><br/><p>How could something that had been swallowed be spat out?! And what was with the person that came out ? Buy one get one for free?</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you f*cking crazy?\u201d The figure appeared in front of Yao Si like a whirlwind, glaring at her with fury in its eyes. Wait\u2026 it looked familiar \u201cI was busy reconstructing my planet at home, so why did you drag me here? Didn\u2019t I send you the spiritual beast blood curd? What else do you want?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLin-Lin Long!\u201d</p><br/><p>(\u2299 o \u2299)</p><br/><p><em>F*ck! Didn\u2019t we promise not to spit out random things? </em> It seemed like the nature of her space ability was: It won\u2019t be comfortable unless it spit something out? But why Lin Long?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re asking me?! Who the f*ck should I ask then? Didn\u2019t you suddenly open a portal that pulled me in forcefully?\u201d he fumed, seemingly about to eat someone up. \u201cIt took me so much effort to piece the planet together. I was about to test the space connection, so how could you just drag me over without any prior notice?! You\u2019re doing it on purpose, aren\u2019t you?! Did I offend you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEr\u2026 It\u2019s a misunderstanding.\u201d</p><br/><p>When she had opened the counter space portal, he happened to be testing out his own space portal, so\u2026 he was dragged over purely by coincidence? Was that even possible?!</p><br/><p>(\u2299_\u2299)</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Highness!\u201d Bai Yi shouted out abruptly while taking a look at her before glancing over at Lin Long who had suddenly appeared. He seemed to have remembered something as he pointed in front of them anxiously. \u201cHurry and look at that black hole\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si glanced over. <em>F*ck! </em>Her previous attempt at space ability usage had failed, and the black hole had grown even larger. It had even started devouring the surrounding black holes. If all of them joined it, the planet would be in trouble.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere the f*ck is this place?\u201d Lin Long frowned, disdain apparent on his face. \u201cHey! The one with the surname Yao, someone else\u2019s contractor, what exactly do you want from me after dragging me all the way here?\u201d</p><br/><p><em>What sort of greeting is that!</em></p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll explain to you in a moment.\u201d Yao Si pointed toward the black hole anxiously. \u201cYou have a space ability as well right? Could you help me close that hole up?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy should I help you? Who are you?\u201d Lin Long scoffed with an insufferably arrogant look on his face. \u201cI haven\u2019t even gotten even with you! So why should I help you? Do you really think you are amazing just because you are a contractor?!</p><br/><p>\u201cHeh! What do you mean by space ability? My abilities are stronger than you can ever imagine. Don\u2019t forget, I\u2019m a pure breed, so what do you bastards know? In the entire Galaxy, my abilities are considered\u2026 the second best! It\u2019s just a few black holes, so what\u2019s the big deal!\u201d</p><br/><p>He waved his hands.</p><br/><p>Several loud thumps rang out as large space portals opened up. In less than half a minute, all the black holes and unstable portals in front of them disappeared.</p><br/><p>The entire area was cleared, and the surroundings sunk into silence!</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Bai Yi.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Li Zheng.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Yao Si.</p><br/><p>\u201cYo-your Highness, he is?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA pro sent by a monkey!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m going back to my tests.\u201d Lin Long waved his hand, prepared to open up a space portal, but a thought struck him then. He turned back to glare at Yao Si with an \u2018extremely scary\u2019 expression as he spat through clenched teeth, \u201cIn the future, don\u2019t ever drag me over out of nowhere, or I will kill you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWait a minute!\u201d Yao Si tugged at his sleeve.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat else do you want?\u201d He pushed her hands away with contempt.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince you\u2019re here, you should stay a little longer!\u201d Yao Si smiled\u2014a pro that had come willingly should not be wasted. \u201cThis planet is rather dangerous, but we have to visit a few more spots. Since your ability is the world\u2019s\u2026 second best, why don\u2019t you go along with us?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy did you drag me here?\u201d He glanced at her with suspicion. \u201cWhere\u2019s your pure breed? Did he burn his brain and decided to toss you here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si coughed into her hand. \u201cThe situation is a little special.\u201d</p><br/><p>Who would have known that this planet was so deceptive? Besides, it was after all a coming of age test, so if she were to seek help from Mu Xuan, she would probably never escape the status of a young cub. Because of that, she couldn\u2019t seek help from him. Plus, she had brought along two burdens. \u201cJust say the word, will you help me out?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot helping!\u201d he replied firmly. \u201cI finally understand it\u2014nothing goes right whenever I meet you, huh? I just want to head home right now and can\u2019t be bothered with you guys\u2019 business. You can do whatever you want!\u201d</p><br/><p>Without another word, he turned to leave!</p><br/><p>Yao Si remained still, counting down silently: one, two, three\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck!\u201d Even before he made it ten meters away, Er Gou came back with clenched teeth. \u201cSpeak, where else do you need to go?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u256e(\u256f\u25bd\u2570)\u256d</p><br/><p>So\u2026</p><br/><p>Yao Si taped open the map and pointed to the next checkpoint. Lin Long waved a portal open and headed inside. When they didn\u2019t rush in after, he turned and glared at them. \u201cAre you guys dumb, why are you still standing there? Move!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Bai Yi.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Li Zheng.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour\u2026 Highness, he is\u2026 he a little\u2026\u201d Bai Yi lowered his voice, but he still couldn\u2019t spit the words out.</p><br/><p>Yao Si sighed deeply, then patted his shoulder. \u201cYoung man, get used to it!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Arrogance is considered an illness and has to be treated!</p></div>\n</div>"}

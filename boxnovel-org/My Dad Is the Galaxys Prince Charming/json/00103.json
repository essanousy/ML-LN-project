She then continued, \u201d But\u2026 does it have anything to do with you? Does your acceptance have anything to do with us? Must a race inform you of its strength and weaknesses? No matter how strong we bloodlings are, we have always maintained our strict values. There isn\u2019t a need to cheat. You can\u2019t even cheat properly, so how dare you fire another race?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d he said, choking on his words.</p><br/><p><em>An arrogance competition? Who\u2019s afraid, heh. </em></p><br/><p>\u201cEquality is the most important aspect in a competition! You broke the rules by using an S grade robot, this means I have the right to deem your results and participation rights as invalid. You will never be the champion, even if just as you mentioned, we had participated by using underhanded means or our kind is pulling ranks! If you aren\u2019t convinced\u2026 Heh, is that my problem?\u201d <em>If you have the capability, bite me! </em></p><br/><p>Yuan Han\u2019s face sank, but he was no longer able to retort, and he dragged himself out the competition grounds.</p><br/><p>Yao Si quickly disregarded the extremist, turning towards President Zhuo Feng. \u201cPresident, about the competition\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe results don\u2019t count, they don\u2019t count!\u201d</p><br/><p>President Zhuo Feng broke into cold sweat. Today seemed like a horrible day, cheating was already a major scandal for the academy, but the cheater didn\u2019t even stop there, but had to direct his anger elsewhere. The president could already predict how badly his academy was going to be bashed once this news hit the Galactic Web. The registration rate next year was definitely going to fall into the dumps!</p><br/><p>He wiped the cold sweat off his forehead and added weakly, \u201cThe champion title for this competition belongs to your academy\u2014\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cForget it!\u201d Before he could finish his sentence, though, Nephew Gu interrupted with a solemn expression, his every word devilish. \u201cWe, The First Academy, have always been reputable and with strict values. In order to prevent others with ulterior motives from naming us an academy that bullies those weaker with force, or an academy that secretly controls the competition with underhanded methods, we will pull out from the competition.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cold sweat was now pouring down President Zhuo Feng\u2019s back. If the First Academy pulled out, what would then be the point in competing. \u201cNo, no, no, how can you do that? This\u2026 Everyone is watching, on account of our many years of friendship\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Gu Shucheng was prepared to direct more hatred toward the man in an attempt to appease Her Highness. <em>How dare this bastard without any ability speak in front of Her Highness? Who gave him the right? Does he think I won\u2019t give him trouble?</em></p><br/><p>\u201cOur academy isn\u2019t as skilled, we won\u2019t partic\u2014\u201d He stopped abruptly, his eyes going wide as color washed off his face.</p><br/><p>Even Yao Si could sense his abnormality.</p><br/><p>\u201cNephew Gu, what\u2019s wrong\u2014\u201d</p><br/><p>Just as she started to ask, he turned around and grabbed Luo Ying who was at the side before using the other hand to grab Yao Si. \u201cWe must leave!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Before she could get back to her senses, she was already hauled away, only managing to pull Mu Xuan who was still seated nearby. Holding onto them, Nephew Gu sprinted down the stairs.</p><br/><p>Everyone on the stage wore a face of confusion as they glanced at each other. Thinking that something big was going to happen, they followed after.</p><br/><p>\u201cNephew Gu!\u201d Yao Si tried to get a clarification as she rushed away by his side.</p><br/><p>However, Gu Shucheng had no intention of replying, focused on running away with a death grip on her arm, the strength exerted by which was starting to hurt her. Mu Xuan, who was originally emotionless, broke into a deep frown, heading forward to rip their hands apart.</p><br/><p>Turning, he held onto her waist with one hand and lifted Nephew Gu by the collar with the other, Luo Ying dangling behind. Like a grape vein with three berries, he jumped off the stage. All Yao Si could feel was a strong gust of wind engulfing her, and the next moment the four of them landed softly like a feather into the middle of the freshly cleaned competition grounds.</p><br/><p>\u201cNephew Gu, in such a pressing situation, how did you\u2026\u201d Before she could finish her sentence, a familiar surge of energy pulsed within her, this was\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cYou used your ability?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wait a minute! Nephew Gu\u2019s ability is\u2026 foresight!</p><br/><p>The reason he had pulled her down so anxiously was because\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cIs something going to happen?\u201d Her heart froze. \u201cWhat did you see?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure either!\u201d Nephew Gu\u2019s face was still ashen, his expression a mixture of horror and bewilderment as he continued to stare at the seat on the stage.</p><br/><p>Due to their abrupt departure, the various academy presidents had followed after in curiosity. There was no longer anyone up there.</p><br/><p>Yao Si glanced at the empty stage. Why did it seem like an evacuation? She asked casually, \u201cDid you perhaps see the stage exploding?\u201d</p><br/><p>The second she finished her question, a deafening explosion erupted.</p><br/><p>A gigantic blue glow fell from the skies, spilling the stage. The originally white stage was thoroughly enveloped by a blue glow, splitting into pieces.</p><br/><p><em>F*ck, it really exploded!</em></p><br/><p>She lifted her head. There was a black ship in the skies, directly above the stage.</p><br/><p>It was Yuan Han who had just left!</p><br/><p>\u201cRemember, this is just a punishment! You poisonous creatures, I\u2019ll definitely be back to get my revenge for the humiliation you brought me today.\u201d He spat from above at the crowd. \u201cSo what if you\u2019re bloodlings, I, Yuan Han, am not afraid.\u201d</p><br/><p>This biting of teeth, this hateful tone\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>This guy\u2026 must be a maniac!</p><br/><p>(\u256f\u2035\u25a1\u2032)\u256f\ufe35\u253b\u2501\u253b</p><br/><p>Wasn\u2019t it just losing a competition? Why did it seem like such a deeply ingrained abhorrence. Besides, wasn\u2019t he the one that cheated?</p><br/><p>\u201cPresident Zhuo Feng\u2026 Are the students from your academy all such odd characters?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d President Zhuo Feng.</p><br/><p>Yao Si took a step forward unconsciously, and Mu Xuan bolted forward, holding onto her. In a low voice, he said, \u201cDon\u2019t go over.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si stilled. Just then, the blue glow enveloping the stage started to change \u2013 darkening, materializing. In less than a second, a gigantic circle was formed. Just like a flower bud, it opened into a massive blue flower that was glowing, its petals translucent. The flower smashed down, thoroughly destroying the already half-ruined stage.</p><br/><p><em>What kind of weapon is that? </em></p><br/><p>She glanced up at the sky, and in a flash, the black ship disappeared.</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>Yuan Han\u2019s rift thoroughly wrecked the peaceful competition, pushing it to the level of a major affair. His final blow could be considered as an attempted murder, while with Yao Si around, it gradually leveled up into a terrorist attack.</p><br/><p>The Galactic Alliance was quick to order for his arrest, Zhuo Feng Academy to expel him, while the bloodlings to list him as a wanted criminal.</p><br/><p>However, he seemed to have vanished into thin air.</p><br/><p>The gigantic blue flower left behind by his suspicious looking robot had vanished abruptly, turning into dust. No one knew the weapon that was used, no one having seen it before, thus a commotion rose up regarding that.</p><br/><p>Zhuo Feng Academy blasted itself into fame with this incident, but it wasn\u2019t a pleasant one. People started to discuss Yuan Han\u2019s identity, guessing who he might be. But regardless of how much they investigated, they could only conclude that he was an average student, the only exception being that he\u2019d become the disciple of a robot expert. Besides that, before the competition, no one knew of his ability to control robots.</p><br/><p>As for the black lighting account on the Galactic Web, no one had accessed it before.</p><br/><p>Yao Si had an odd feeling about him, both the way he dealt with things and the way he acted during the competition. He had been insistent and confident about his nonsensical logic, and this behaviour seem oddly familiar..?</p><br/><p>Yet she couldn\u2019t pinpoint the origin of this feeling. Even though she had never encountered him, there was an odd sense of familiarity mixed with a rising wave of worry.</p><br/><p>The biting sense of unease kept eating at her, but even after three long months, he was still not found. A whole semester had already passed, but he still remained missing.</p><br/><p>The hunch Yao Si had kept gnawing at her more and more. She then recalled the times when the bloodlings could not be found, and at that time, the disappearance was linked to a special organization.</p><br/><p>If these two events were linked, then those people should be prepared, so she decided to have a discussion with Nephew Gu on a major plan. If Yuan Han wasn\u2019t going to appear, she was going to take action.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Highness, your wish for me to use my ability to pinpoint Yuan Han\u2019s position?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si nodded her head aggressively. After causing such a ruckus, he shouldn\u2019t be able to hide forever. Besides, all his accounts and information were being monitored . Soon, he would be forced to appear.They just had to predict his possible location in advance.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood idea!\u201d Fanboy Bai Yi was the first to complement her. \u201cIf the other party\u2019s actions can be predicted, we can easily go on the offense.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si nodded, that was exactly her intention. She then turned to Nephew Gu and asked, \u201cIs it possible?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is possible\u2026\u201d As opposed to their excitement, Nephew Gu wore a frown. He shared a glance with Luo Ying, seemingly troubled.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet me explain!\u201d Luo Ying took a step forward, sighing. \u201d Your Highness, even though father has the ability to predict\u2026 he is not able to control the visions, which means he might not be able to see what you desire.\u201d</p><br/><p><em>His mind reading ability comes at random? Isn\u2019t that even worse than my passive ability? </em></p><br/><p>\u201cThen try a few more times if you can\u2019t see anything at once!\u201d Bai Yi said enthusiastically, tapping Nephew Gu\u2019s shoulder without any worry. He had on a confident smile. \u201d Shucheng, your ability is one in a million, we may actually be able to find that crazy guy with it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gu Shucheng rolled his eyes, and after a bit of thinking, he nodded at Yao Si. \u201cI\u2019ll try.\u201d</p><br/><p>He shut his eyes, trying to sense something. At the same moment, Yao Si felt a familiar force rushing through her body. It was her passive ability! She was suddenly intrigued, since Nephew Gu\u2019s ability was foresight, what would hers be?</p>\n</div>"}

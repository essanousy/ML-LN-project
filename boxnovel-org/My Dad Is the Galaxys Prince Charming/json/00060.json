In less than a minute, the sampling room\u2019s door flew open and ten men rushed in. Without a moment\u2019s hesitation, they directed red lasers at the trio who was hiding beneath neat rows of various weapons.</p><br/><p>\u201cPresident, what should we do?\u201d Bai Yi looked towards Yao Si instinctively.</p><br/><p>Yao Si\u2019s lip twitched. Could they just surrender?</p><br/><p>Without giving them time to consider it, the leader of the guards waved his hand forward. \u201cGet rid of those intruders!\u201d</p><br/><p>The next moment, a white light flashed in front of Yao Si, flooding her vision. The guards had activated their weapons.</p><br/><p>Hey! How could you be so impatient, we have a hostage with us!</p><br/><p>While they were shooting, Yao Si bit down on her lip, convincing herself that a fight was inevitable. Besides, she was immortal, so what did it really matter.</p><br/><p>Moments later, something exploded beside her. It sent a bright glow hurling toward the guards. The light burst into numerous sparks and landed as a web. Instantly, a scent of charred meat flooded Yao Si\u2019s senses, and the row of guards collapsed to the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cLuo Ying!\u201d Bai Yi held onto the exhausted Luo Ying. The attack had been clearly summoned by her.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Luo Ying shook her head, and her face paled a touch more. In a worried voice, she said, \u201cShucheng\u2026 He\u2026 he\u2019s here, I can feel him, he\u2019s in danger.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you know where he is?\u201d</p><br/><p>She shook her head, and Bai Yi turned to Yao Si.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s leave this place first,\u201d she said in a hurry</p><br/><p>If reinforcement arrived, they\u2019d be goners. Luo Ying was the only one among them who could fight, but she had just awakened and hadn\u2019t yet regained her full strength. She wouldn\u2019t be able to withstand it if she summoned her ability once more.</p><br/><p>Yao Si supported the visibly exhausted Luo Ying, but just as they were about to leave, she remembered something. \u201cWait a minute, bring him along!\u201d She pointed towards Professor Fu, who was clearly frightened by the lightning ability.</p><br/><p>\u201cWha-what do you want with me?\u201d Professor Fu asked with a stammer. \u201cI-I don\u2019t know anything. Besides, you saw it, they don\u2019t care about me at all, even if you bring me along, I won\u2019t be of any use.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not for you to decide.\u201d Bai Yi grabbed him and dragged him out as well.</p><br/><p>They made a frantic escape. While they were doing so, Yao Si took a quick glance at the rows of words above everyone\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>Basement five was ridiculously big, so even after trying several routes, they still weren\u2019t able to find a way out or any useful information regarding Nephew Gu. The alarm overhead, though, increased in urgency and intensity with each passing second.</p><br/><p>Professor Gu lamented, \u201cBasement five has been closed down completely . Even I won\u2019t be able to leave now.\u201d He sighed heavily, a defeated expression on his face. \u201cEven if you manage to find the other bloodling, they\u2019ll still destroy the entire base without a second thought.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Bai Yi asked, violently tugging at his collar.</p><br/><p>Professor Fu let out a bitter smile. \u201cThis research base is a secret of the highest level. Researchers who were brought in came with a knowledge that they\u2019ll have to stay here till the day they died. The alarm we\u2019re hearing now is the most critical one. Once it begins ringing, all the ships will begin evacuations. If the alarm isn\u2019t turned off in an hour, the whole research base will self-destruct, destroying everything within it. Nobody will be able to leave.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you think to frighten me?\u201d Bai Yi scoffed.</p><br/><p>At this, Professor Fu added anxiously, \u201cI know that bloodlings are immortal, but the research base naturally has ways to kill those of your kind.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Yi froze, his grip tightening on Professor Fu\u2019s collar. \u201cWhat do you mean? What kind of research are you guys doing here?\u201d</p><br/><p>The man remained silent, his face paling even more.</p><br/><p>\u201cClearly its a research on bloodlings,\u201d Yao Si said.</p><br/><p>If one added all they\u2019ve encountered so far\u2014Gu Shucheng\u2019s disappearance, the substance that could affect Bai Yi, the research laboratory in basement five, Luo Ying who had been tied to a surgical table\u2014there could only be one explanation. This research base was made to specifically target bloodlings.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why he said that the research base will stop anyone from leaving at all cost\u2026 For if the matter was leaked, they would experience the wrath of the entire bloodling race.\u201d</p><br/><p>Professor Fu lowered his head, his face reaching a terrifying shade of white.</p><br/><p>\u201cShucheng\u2026\u201d Bai Yi\u2019s face darkened. His hands tightened into fits unconsciously, and his expression clouded with worry. \u201cNo! We have to find him!\u201d</p><br/><p>He turned, preparing to look for Shucheng, but Professor Fu sighed at this moment. \u201cIt\u2019s too late, no one can leave.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment the question was spoken, a loud noise erupted above them. Yao Si\u2019s heart quivered. \u201cCareful!\u201d She grabbed onto Professor Fu and Luo Ying and dragged them both back. The next moment, the ceiling opened up.</p><br/><p>The floor started to tremble as though the research base was being ripped apart, and the walls began to collapse. A shattering sound filled their ears as large blocks of stone fell from walls and ceiling, smashing into each other. Numerous shards reached the group, grazing their skin. At this moment, the research base on the verge of total collapse.</p><br/><p>\u201cPresident!\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Yi hurried over to grab the three of them, and with a high jump, they exited through the whole in the ceiling. Right then, the research base was no longer the peaceful calm lab it was before but a danger ground with fallen out floor.</p><br/><p>\u201cI was wondering who could have enter ed basement five.\u201d A foreign voice soaked with mockery came from nearby. \u201cIsn\u2019t it some research specimens that came to join the fun?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si\u2019s heart sank. Turning, she saw a huge crowd ahead, at the front of which was the speaker. He was a man dressed entirely in black. Behind him stoof four guards and a crowd of at least ten people dressed in over-sized coats. Strangely, all of them were gazing weirdly over here.</p><br/><p>\u201cProfessor Fu, you\u2019re still alive.\u201d The man disregarded Yao Si and her companions, turning instead to Professor Fu who was coughing continuously. \u201cWeren\u2019t you always complaining about the lack of specimens? Now there\u2019s more.\u201d</p><br/><p>Professor Fu froze, forgetting to cough as his eyes widened in fright. He stammered out, \u201cMr-Mr Lu, I-I didn\u2019t want to escape, it\u2019s them\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cProfessor Fu, of course I believe you.\u201d He smiled, and his eyes turned into crescents, yet the way he gazed was full of murderous intent. He waved his hand then, barely giving Yao Si and her fellow students a glance. \u201cKeep those specimens.\u201d</p>\n</div>"}

Not too bad at all, I give your act a 101 points, that additional point is for you to flaunt!\u201d He patted her shoulder casually. \u201cYou could actually scare that perverted Lu to such an extent, not bad indeed! I\u2019m thoroughly convinced by your abilities, president!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBai Yi!\u201d Gu Shucheng struggled to sit up as he glanced over in warning. \u201cMind your words.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did I do?\u201d</p><br/><p>Nephew Gu ignored him and turned to face Yao Si. \u201cThank you, Your Highness\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201d Yao Si took took a long look at him. Thankfully, he had started to heal after Luo Ying had brought him down. His inability to heal previously must have been caused by some medication.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey! Hey! Hey! Stop acting already.\u201d Bai Yi looked at them incredulously. \u201cWasn\u2019t she just lying to that Perverted Lu? Shucheng, why are you calling her your highness?\u201d</p><br/><p>Gu Shucheng ignored him, turning to glance afar. \u201cYour Highness, why are they\u2026\u201d He pointed towards the zombiefied bloodlings that were on their knees.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201d Yao Si shook her head, her face full of confusion. \u201cI\u2026 It happened after I got angry\u2026\u201d She recalled the unfamiliar strength that had erupted from within her.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 the suppression of your bloodline,\u201d Luo Ying explained softly, her gaze lightening up. Her eyes now had that same expression as the the elders had upon meeting her, with a hint of worship\u2026 and envy? \u201cYour Highness\u2019s suppression\u2026 I-I could sense it\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Bloodline suppression is an irresistible power coming from their bloodline that bloodlings are defenseless against.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait!\u201d The very next instant, Bai Yi trembled as a thought struck him. His legs weakened in disbelief, and he stumbled away from Yao Si as thought she was a ghost. \u201cThat horrifying oppression was the suppression of your bloodline? Y-you released it? Y-you really are\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fake!\u201d Yao Si rolled her eyes at his delayed reaction, then turned to Luo Ying. \u201cSister Luo Ying, since the suppression of the bloodline can eliminate Perverted Lu\u2019s influence on them, can it also awaken them?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cY-yea!\u201d Luo Ying nodded vigorously, a hint of red finally warming her pale face. She then added, \u201d You can do it, Your Highness! They chose to close up their minds because due to the immense pain. Now, you just have to instruct them out for them to awaken.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAll right, I\u2019ll try!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si took a moment to sense the power, and indeed, the familiar strength came flowing outwards. It wasn\u2019t the same as when her ability activated whenever she met another source, but possessed a strange familiarity. Just then, she recalled that before her hibernation, when she had witnessed the war between the yellow and black, she seemed to have felt the same surge of energy. It had actually been a suppression of her bloodline.</p><br/><p>She released the strength within her, and the next second, the power engulfed the entire research base. All the bloodlings present went down on their knees, and even Gu Shucheng and Luo Ying had involuntarily knelt down. Only Bai Yi, who was still in a daze, remained standing.</p><br/><p>His eyes widened, and with his mouth hanging open, he stared at her with disbelief. \u201cY-you\u2019re really\u2026 you\u2019re..\u201d Before he could finish his sentence, his eyeballs rolled backwards and he fainted.</p><br/><p>Gu Shucheng, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Luo Ying, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t have time to bother with him at the moment. With a quick glance at the bloodlings present, she shut her eyes to calm herself down. Deep within her, she could distinctly sense each one, and so she deliberately connected the energy to them. It was a miraculous sensation, as though everyone\u2019s thoughts were transparent and open, without any obstruction. She was about to do as Luo Ying had mentioned, wake them up, but just then, their thoughts gushed out, drowning her mid.</p><br/><p>Images flashed past her, one by one, and she felt herself alive in each one. The sensation was so clear, she could have sworn she was the actual victim whose mind she was now seeing. Before her was the stone cold laboratory, the sensation of her suppressed abilities, the gleaming surgical knife, the overflowing blood that didn\u2019t seem to ever stop, and what was worst, she had to witness the organs being ripped from her body\u2026</p><br/><p>Once\u2026 then again\u2026 and again\u2026</p><br/><p>Just as the wound healed, it was ripped open once again\u2026</p><br/><p>It seemed like there was no end\u2026</p><br/><p>Even the pain started to numb\u2026</p><br/><p>They wanted to die, but they couldn\u2019t!</p><br/><p>Sorrow, despair, fear, pain, and the desire to die\u2026</p><br/><p>Her thoughts were swallowed by these negative emotions. It was so painful she started having trouble breathing. She finally understood why the alarm could bring the bloodlings so much pain. It was the sound that played whenever they removed a part of the victims\u2019 body.</p><br/><p>The images kept gushing in. But at this moment, Yao Si clenched her teeth and restrained them from flowing in. Only then could she keep her sanity.</p><br/><p>With the strength of her bloodline, she placed an order in their minds\u2014it was to forget all that happened here. They would only remember being captured, but not what happened after. It was just like anesthesia before a surgery. Those memories\u2026 would definitely drive them crazy if they were to remain.</p><br/><p><em>Erase the memories! Now, wake up. </em></p><br/><p>Once that was done, she opened her eyes. She felt as though she had just been fished out of water; she was both soaked and exhausted.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Highness!\u201d Gu Shucheng and Luo Ying hurried over with worry.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine!\u201d Yao Si said, panting heavily, then recovered slightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou probably haven\u2019t yet gotten used to using the power of your bloodline.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh\u2026What\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere am I?\u201d</p><br/><p>The bloodlings began to awake, and they were all filled with confusion.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid I get caught?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh right, experiment\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is that research base.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho are you? This force\u2026 force is\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA-are we saved?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine, everything is fine!\u201d</p><br/><p>They finally reacted, and the dead gazes in their eyes flooded with joy and excitement, though they still remained in a kneeling position. All of them were looking at Yao Si curiously, waiting for her next instructions.</p><br/><p>\u201cHi!\u201d Yao Si retrieved the bloodline suppression and waved towards them. \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re all awake. But\u2026 does anyone know about Euphoria? What kind of organization is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>The crowd glanced at each other, while a few sunk into deep thought before speaking up with hesitation.</p>\n</div>"}

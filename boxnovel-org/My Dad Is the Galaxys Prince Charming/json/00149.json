Aren\u2019t you going to explain? Are the floating petals really alright? </em></p><br/><p>In contrast to her anxiety, Mu Xuan remained calm and reached out to caress her head. \u201cThis should be an invitation.\u201d</p><br/><p>Invitation?</p><br/><p>Yao Si stilled. In less than half a second, their aircraft headed toward the middle of the flower which was filled with silver leaves that unfurled outwards.</p><br/><p>In a flash, the scenery changed. Instead of the control room, they were now submerged in a sea of flowers of every color and variety. A woman with hair long enough to touch the ground and skin as pale and flawless as snow stood in front of them. She was excruciatingly beautiful; it was as though she had walked out of a painting. Her exquisite looks made her seem like a precious artwork that collectors yearned to treasure, if only\u2026 she wasn\u2019t eight meters tall.</p><br/><p>Yes, she was a giant, the kind that rivaled high-rise buildings.</p><br/><p>Yao Si lifted her head to take a closer look.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt really is the flower\u2026 Aves queen!\u201d Lu Chen exclaimed, the shock visible on his face.</p><br/><p>Queen!? So this giant was a female.</p><br/><p><em>You sure are tall, sis. </em></p><br/><p><em>Wait a minute </em>! Yao Si remembered some details about Aves from the notes Mu Xuan had passed to her: They were a technologically advanced and civilized race. They were one of the leading races in the Galactic and were extremely democratic.</p><br/><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t the commander-in-chief have the highest authority in the Aves?\u201d When did they have a queen?</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is a single royal family among Aves, but they have never appeared publicly before. However, I never believed it! Ahhhh\u2026 I\u2019m so lucky! I actually met the queen of Aves! After God Mu, she\u2019s the second most popular person in the Galaxy I wonder if I\u2019ll be able to see God Mu one day!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Er, you already saw him.</p><br/><p>\u201cYao from the Ore Planet.\u201d The almighty queen flickered her eyes open, and a hollow airy voice echoed in the space. Her azure eyes had a magnetic pull that swept across the three of them. \u201cTell me, which one of you possesses the ability which impregnated the beast?\u201d</p><br/><p>Eh?</p><br/><p>Was the queen seeking a child as well?</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s our boss.\u201d Before Yao Si could react, Lu Chen had already volunteered the answer.</p><br/><p>\u201cLu Chen!\u201d <em>Didn\u2019t we promise not to expose the truth? How could you betray your comrades like this! </em> Lu Chen pointed at Yao Si, totally disregarding her protest. \u201cRevered queen.\u201d</p><br/><p><em>What\u2019s wrong with you?</em></p><br/><p>\u201cGreat!\u201d The queen nodded, turning toward Yao Si.</p><br/><p>She could feel a force descending upon her, and a power surged within her .</p><br/><p>Was it\u2026 an ability?</p><br/><p>\u201cHe is bewitched by her seduction ability!\u201d Mu Xuan frowned and activated his mental strength. The vigor of his strength sent a ripple through Yao Si as it radiated outwards.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2026\u201d The queen frowned. \u201cYou\u2019re not necessary.\u201d She waved her hands, and both Mu Xuan and Lu Chen started to distort before disappearing.</p><br/><p>\u201cMu Xuan!\u201d Yao Si exclaimed. What had the woman done?</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I merely sent them back,\u201d the queen explained before focusing back on Yao Si. The pressuring force came crashing onto her once again. \u201cGirl of the Yao, I need your help on a small matter.\u201d</p><br/><p><em>Help? What do you mean?</em></p><br/><p>The queen took a step forward, and a pair of wings spread out behind her massive figure. The wings were shaped like those of a butterfly. They were colourful and patterned, and about four-five times larger than her. They occupied a large space and seemed to posses a certain pull that sucking her in.</p><br/><p>Yao Si felt her brain buzz, and she was suddenly engulfed by an impulse to sacrifice her entire soul for the queen\u2019s needs. It was an odd thought that appeared abruptly, and she could feel her mind growing heavy.</p><br/><p>The queen\u2019s hollow but clear voice entered her thoughts. \u201cYao girl from the Ore Planet, please use your special ability on me and give me the ability to conceive.\u201d</p><br/><p><em>What?!</em></p><br/><p>Yao Si stilled, her mind clearing.</p><br/><p><em>F*ck, the supposedly mighty queen is really seeking a child\u2026 So I\u2019m being treated as a fertility god again?</em></p><br/><p>An advertisement flashed in Yao Si\u2019s mind: [Aves queen with a voluptuous figure, riches beyond your belief, and ethereal looks is willing to heavily reward the one who possesses the ability to impregnate in hopes to conceive and carry on the royal bloodline.]</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>\uff08\uff1d\uff3f\uff1d\uff09</p><br/><p>\u201cUnleash your ability!\u201d</p><br/><p>Before the advertisement could finish airing, the queen suddenly spread her wings. Yao Si felt her mind turning heavy as it sunk lower and lower, her body spiraling out of control.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait a minute, my ability\u2026\u201d <em>Is passive! F*ck, I can\u2019t just impregnate anyone! </em></p><br/><p>But it was too late; the queen couldn\u2019t bear to wait any longer. Against her own will, Yao Si lifted her hands and summoned all the force within her and sent it toward the queen.</p><br/><p><em>Wait a minute! I don\u2019t even know what this ability is!</em></p><br/><p>\u201cSisi!\u201d With a loud snap, something broke. Mu Xuan returned to the sea of flowers, and Yao Si felt herself relaxing, the uncontrollable force dissipating.</p><br/><p>He was finally here!</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you alright?\u201d Mu Xuan held onto her.</p><br/><p>Yao Si nodded. She was fine, but her ability\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are actually able to break my illusion!\u201d The queen frowned, starting to fume.</p><br/><p>Mu Xuan\u2019s face fell. He hugged Yao Si with one hand while making a wave with the other. A huge sea of flames rose up, and the bed of flowers started to convulse before disappearing. The scene then returned to the empty pilot room.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Yao actually possess such a powerful individual.\u201d The queen quivered in shock, thoroughly infuriated. \u201cBut\u2026 you chose the wrong opponent!\u201d Her large wings flapped, creating a gust of frosty air. Rows of ice shards started to form in mid-air.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat girl, I\u2026\u201d She suddenly stilled, a glazed look in her eyes. It could have been a hallucination, but the queen\u2019s eyes trembled, and her frosty authoritative tone turned tender and soft. \u201cI\u2026 I want to marry her!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p><em>Ah?</em></p><br/><p>Before Yao Si could react, she felt her vision blur, and the gigantic queen shrunk down to a normal height. She came in front of Yao Si and took her head in her palms tenderly. Suddenly, the queen inched closer and pecked Yao Si\u2019s cheek\u2026</p><br/><p>(\uffe3\uffe3)!!</p><br/><p><em>What\u2019s with this situation? Weren\u2019t you seeking a child? Why did your goals change so abruptly? </em></p></div>\n</div>"}

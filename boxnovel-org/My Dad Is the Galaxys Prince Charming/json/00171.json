After expending an immense effort, she had finally managed to elevate him from a pure, naive boy who would blush at the slightest touch to a man that could share the same bed with her without a flinch. He even managed to button up her deliberately opened top.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>But even after sharing the same bed for a couple of months, nothing exciting had happened. Everything remained innocent.</p><br/><p>\u25cb|\uffe3|_</p><br/><p>From the start, Yao Si had been dropping hints aggressively, but as time passed, her shyness morphed into anger, her actions turning more forceful. However, Mu Xuan would always stop her at the very last second, putting a stop to all her advances. There were times he would even tap on his ability.</p><br/><p>Yao Si could feel a dagger ripping through her heart every night, the blood loss enough to fill a river.</p><br/><p>Even though Mu Xuan was affected by her advances, he still held onto his defence. With his actions, Yao Si sometimes felt like she was a pervert that preyed on young, naive ladies.</p><br/><p>Mu Xuan\u2019s only excuse was\u2026 her young age!</p><br/><p>(\u256f\u2035\u25a1\u2032)\u256f\ufe35\u253b\u2501\u253b</p><br/><p><em>F*ck that! </em>She hated when people called her young. <em>You better clarify yourself, which part of me looks too young? </em></p><br/><p>Just as Yao Si was trying to figure out what had caused the misconception, Bai Yi sent her an urgent message.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Highness, are you heading to the Ability Planet the day after tomorrow?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAbility Planet?\u201d <em> I have never even heard of it. </em>\u201cWhy would I go there?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Luo Ying\u2019s coming of age ceremony.\u201d He pulled out an invitation for her. \u201cShu Cheng sent me the invitation a few days ago, so didn\u2019t you receive one as well? It can\u2019t be. It isn\u2019t possible for him to miss you .\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si paused, remembering that she hadn\u2019t opened her inbox in a long while, since the planet they were on previously hadn\u2019t had any reception. With a quick search, she found the invitation.</p><br/><p>\u201cI received it.\u201d She waved the invitation about. \u201cBut\u2026 why is there a coming of age ceremony? Isn\u2019t she already of age?\u201d It couldn\u2019t be hasn\u2019t she hadn\u2019t registered her marriage with Nephew Gu?</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course not, and it\u2019s not even my turn yet!\u201d Bai Yi seemed to have been reminded of something, for his speech filled with indignation. \u201cI planned to join her, but after her graduation test on Nirvana, she went over without any notice. She\u2019s really too much! And to think Gu Shucheng actually agreed! I was only informed after she had passed the coming of age test,\u201d he fumed, itching to bash him up.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait a minute! A coming of age test? What do you mean?\u201d Yao Si was growing increasingly confused. Wasn\u2019t the coming of age ceremony a formality when friends and family would gather for a meal? \u201cWhy is there a need to head over to Ability Planet? Are there any other standards or requirements for coming of age?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course there are! Why else would I still be a single dog, one that has been enduring the flaunting of love from two heartless beings for so many years?\u201d he said, sneaking in a complaint into his explanation. \u201cBut Your Highness, it\u2019s normal that you aren\u2019t aware of such a formality, since it hasn\u2019t been long since you awakened.\u201d</p><br/><p>As usual, he started to fill up the gaps in her knowledge.</p><br/><p>A bloodling wasn\u2019t considered of age no matter their years since awakening or what education they had completed. They were required to pass a series of stringent tests to ensure they possessed sufficient abilities to protect themselves before they were considered of age.</p><br/><p>Once they were recognized as adults, they were no longer required to study, but more importantly, they would be able to send a cub request to the Elders Council. This would then place them in the queue for a converted clone.</p><br/><p>This explained why Gu Shucheng had Luo Ying while Bai Yi was still alone even though both of them belonged to the same batch of converted bloodlings,</p><br/><p>\u201cBack then, Gu Shucheng went off to Ability Planet secretly, without me, and Luo Ying did the exact same thing! They really are too much!\u201d Bai Yi remarked while holding onto a grudge. \u201cIf Ability Planet didn\u2019t focus mainly on the attack power of one\u2019s ability, I would have passed eons ago. There\u2019s no way I would be without a cub to this day.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si was suddenly reminded of his mind reading ability. There was indeed not much attack power in it.</p><br/><p>She silently lit up a candle for him.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that place about?\u201d she asked then.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the only uninhabited planet in Galactic E,\u201d Bai Yi answered. \u201cThe atmosphere and terrain there is highly unusual. Even though the environment is suited for life and has dense forests, the climate can change drastically in just a day. The airflow is extremely erratic as well, sometimes emitting even ability-like phenomena.</p><br/><p>\u201cIts harsh and unpredictable environment is the reason why the Elders Council has chosen it for the coming of age test. Those who can survive in the planet for a month are said to have passed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOne month?\u201d That explained why Luo Ying hadn\u2019t been with Nephew Gu recently.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, Luo Ying has already been there for about thirty days, and the day after tomorrow will be the last.\u201d Bai Yi pouted. \u201cHeh, Gu Shucheng invited us over purely to flaunt it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you sure you can be considered an adult bloodling once you pass the coming of age test?\u201d Yao Si confirmed once more.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course!\u201d He nodded.</p><br/><p>Joy spread through her, and she turned toward a certain someone who was serving her drinks on the side. \u201cMu Xuan, I want to go to the Ability Planet this instant! Immediately!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>She was finally going to get rid of the young cub title! Wasn\u2019t it just surviving in a deserted place for a month? She would do it, and no one would call her a baby ever again!</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>Mu Xuan was against her impulsive decision, spending two days in the same sorrowful state of: My young cub wants to drive herself to her death again, seeking urgent help! However, he relented under her insistence and constant coaxing.</p><br/><p>After congratulating Luo Ying hastily, Yao Si immediately headed over to Ability Planet. At the last moment, a certain someone started going through all the minute details with a sunken expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs your optical computer fully charged?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt can last for three years.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHave you brought the defensive equipment?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI brought it, ten sets.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about food? Spiritual beast blood curd, abnormal beast blood curd, duck blood curd\u2014\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI brought everything. They\u2019re all piping hot in the thermos flask.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about clothes? Have you brought enough? Did you bring your favorite black and white set\u2014\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, yes, yes, I have everything! I can wear three completely different sets each day!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHave you brought emergency medications?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m a bloodling, I can self-heal.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSelf-healing isn\u2019t fail proof. What if something goes wrong? What if you encounter a situation you can\u2019t handle! What if\u2014\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, alright, alright, I\u2019ll bring some.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMmh, you\u2019ll also need a simple housing for accommodation, a heater, a backup navigator, games for entertainment, sleeping\u2026 Ah! There\u2019s so many things you\u2019ll need that I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll be able to handle all the weight. I\u2019ll go with you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p><em>Enough!</em></p><br/><p>(\u256f\u2035\u25a1\u2032)\u256f\ufe35\u253b\u2501\u253b</p></div>\n</div>"}

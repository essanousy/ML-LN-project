Besides, who would have a good impression of someone who had cheated them? Also, this was the second time he had cheated her, so it was unforgivable!</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Highness, you have no idea how much\u2014eh? Your Highness, what are you doing? No, no, no, let\u2019s be civil and talk it out! No, not the face! It hurts, hurts, hurts\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si had launched her attack straight at his face, which resulted in Qu Ze\u2019s cries resonating throughout the whole field. She stopped only when his smiling face was disfigured beyond recognition.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince you look like you were itching for a beating, I decided to grant your wish!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYooour Highnassss\u2026\u201d Qu Ze slurred, holding onto his swollen face while tears welled up in his eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re so evil! Little Qu Ze has been hurt\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSay another word if you dare!\u201d Yao Si lifted her fist threateningly while grinding her teeth. She didn\u2019t mind giving him another beating.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, no, no\u2026\u201d Qu Ze jumped, wiping away nonexistent tears. \u201cAii\u2026 After so many years, Your Highness, you have changed. You are no longer that innocent little cutie.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGet lost!\u201d Did he mean to say she deserved to get tricked? \u201cSpeak, why did you get the three of them to kidnap us?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUs?\u201d Qu Ze glanced at Bai Yi in confusion, then squinted his eyes. \u201cEh? There\u2019s an additional freebie. Your services aren\u2019t too bad!\u201d He turned to nod at the three kidnappers in satisfaction.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Three kidnappers.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Bai Yi, the freebie.</p><br/><p>\u201cE-elder!\u201d Bai Yi inhaled, going forward to greet Qu Ze. He was the extremely detestable and notorious elder that was constantly mentioned by older generations. Due to his popularity, every time bloodlings wanted to scare their young cubs, they would definitely use this line: If you don\u2019t behave, Elder Qu Ze will kidnap you!</p><br/><p>Because of that, he became a traumatic part of every bloodling\u2019s childhood. Yet it was still the first time Bai Yi had seen him in person. He was a little frightened, subconsciously hiding behind Yao Si.</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t seem to notice his action as she continued to glare at Qu Ze. \u201cHurry up and answer me, what\u2019s your motive?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Highness, you\u2019re too much,\u201d Qu Ze said indignantly. \u201cHow could I have any ulterior motives when I respect you so much? Am I such a person in your heart?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d Yao Si nodded without hesitation.</p><br/><p>Qu Ze\u2019s lips twitched, his indignant expression cracking as he laughed awkwardly. \u201cYour Highness, you must still remember the incident from before! Ai\u2026 let bygones be bygones! I sought you out this time with a sincere heart.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSought?\u201d Yao Si smirked.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh\u2026 Haven\u2019t I been here for a long time? I\u2019ve been incredibly bored, and recently I thought of you. That\u2019s why I got the three of them to bring you here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si continued to smirk. \u201cYou really expect me to buy that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m telling the truth, I really missed you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd I really want to bash you up!\u201d She raised her fist up once more.</p><br/><p>What to do when an Elder does something wrong? What happens when an Elder misbehaves? They need to get a good beating!</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t, don\u2019t\u2026 Wait a moment! Your Highness\u2026 Noooo!\u201d</p><br/><p>When the violence erupted, the three kidnappers huddled together in a corner, trembling as they glanced at one another nervously. Taking in a deep breath, they all inched toward the door discreetly.</p><br/><p>\u201cMasters, you all can chat! We\u2019ll be leaving now!\u201d Without another word, they ran to the door, shutting it behind themselves.</p><br/><p>Yao Si\u2019s heart sank and she turned in a hurry, but it was too late; the aircraft was already in the air. In less than a second, it disappeared, leaving only the three of them behind.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p><em>F*ck!</em></p><br/><p>\u201cEh! That was fast, they didn\u2019t even ask for their money!\u201d Qu Ze stared at the aircraft while sighing. \u201cSuch benevolent people, leaving without giving their names after doing such good deeds!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cQu! Ze!\u201d What conscience! He had deliberately latched onto her so the aircraft would leave them behind.</p><br/><p>Without the aircraft, how could she go back? The bastard was always bringing her trouble.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Highness, don\u2019t worry, actually\u2014\u201d Before he could continue, an explosion erupted in the air, and a black dot appeared far ahead. On closer inspection, it was an aircraft flying back toward them.</p><br/><p>Yao Si\u2019s spirits lifted; they just needed an aircraft! But just as she was about to head forward, the explosion could be heard again, and the single black dot multiplied\u2026 In less than a minute, the sky was littered with flying objects. Compared to the miniature aircraft from before, the newcomers looked like they were much more prepared for battle.</p><br/><p>Yao Si had an inauspicious omen. Something wasn\u2019t right.</p><br/><p>\u201cQu Ze! What have you been doing here all this while?\u201d She glared at him.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey aren\u2019t from Nirvana,\u201d Qu Ze replied innocently. \u201cNirvana is a game plane, but we haven\u2019t officially entered it yet. We are currently in the welcome area!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho are they?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey could be players that left the planet previously. There aren\u2019t many people here, and as an NPC, I didn\u2019t see many live ones, only chancing upon them once in a while. Thus, I might have gone a little overboard.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si stiffened. \u201cYou fought against them before?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t that serious. It was just an ordinary interaction between NPC and players, an opportunity to exchange pointers.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou mean\u2026 they are here for revenge?\u201d <em>Judging from the crowd, you must have offended many people!</em></p><br/><p>\u201cHehehe\u2026\u201d He smiled arrogantly. \u201cI seldom come out, so that\u2019s why\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p><em>F*ck! </em>She knew it!</p><br/><p>More battleships gathered in the sky. In less than a minute, black dots littered half the sky. <em>How many people did he offend? </em>Some of the aircraft had already begun their attack, their guns aiming in their direction.</p><br/><p>Yao Si felt her heart fall. Grabbing onto Bai Yi, she bolted forward frantically!</p><br/><p>\u201cRun!\u201d</p><br/><p>Just as she expected, the ground behind them erupted from an explosion, mud and gravel rising into the sky with the stench of something burnt. Yao Si in the meantime ran relentlessly; her life was at stake!</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Highness, enter the mystical barrier! They won\u2019t be able to follow,\u201d Qu Ze shouted as he pointed to the front. With a slight buzz, he ran past her.</p><br/><p><em>F*ck! </em>He was so experienced at escaping that even his speed seemed to have been specifically trained for that.</p><br/><p>Yao Si glanced in the direction he had gone. There was indeed a transparent wall surrounding the forest there, separating the two areas into two worlds.</p><br/><p>Explosions behind her continued to rumble, the noise increasing in intensity. Several times, the lasers brushed past them. Yao Si then turned to look at Bai Yi, signaling for him to head toward the wall after her.</p><br/><p>There was a splash as though she had passed through a water curtain. The next moment, she seemed to have entered a vacuum, all the noise and rumbling outside were silenced. It was just like another world. The chaotic noise had turned into the silent night with occasional bug melodies.</p><br/><p>She turned to take a glance back. The battleships were still there, but were blocked by the mystical barrier. Even their attacks couldn\u2019t seem to penetrate the barrier!</p><br/><p>Many of the aircraft had landed. People had come out of them and were pointing toward Qu Ze while shouting in fury. Even though Yao Si couldn\u2019t hear them, she was sure it wasn\u2019t pleasant.</p><br/><p>\u201cAhh, that was close!\u201d Qu Ze dropped onto the floor as he panted. \u201cThe mystical barrier is the safest after all. If it wasn\u2019t to welcome you, I wouldn\u2019t have gotten out at all. Your Highness, aren\u2019t I good!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck you!\u201d She was going to get killed because of him one day. She rolled her eyes, her anger reaching its highest point. She opened her optical computer to look at the map, in search of the player service center. Grabbing the confused Bai Yi, she declared, \u201cBai Yi, let\u2019s go!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh? Your Highness, where are you going?\u201d Qu Ze bolted after her.</p><br/><p>\u201cGoing home!\u201d Even though Nirvana was huge, it was just a game planet for the celestial race. Even if there weren\u2019t any aircraft, as long as they reached a service center and clarified their situation, she could return home.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Highness, you can\u2019t go back now.\u201d Qu Ze shook his head.</p><br/><p>Yao Si froze. What did he mean?</p><br/><p>Just as she was about to ask him about it, her optical computer buzzed, showing some red words.</p><br/><p>[Nirvana system installation complete!]</p><br/><p>Yao Si\u2019s heart sank. What was that Nirvana system?</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Highness, only registered players can enter the mystical barrier to start the game,\u201d Qu Ze explained in a cheerful voice. \u201cIn order for you two to enter the mystical barrier, I replicated my system into both of your optical computers.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou mean\u2026 we\u2019re now players in Nirvana?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Highness, you should know that when I was exiled, I became an NPC! How could I have the player\u2019s system.\u201d His smile grew more radiant.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou guys aren\u2019t players but NPCs!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd NPCs are not allowed to exit the game!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck, he needs a beating!\u201d</p><br/><p>If she didn\u2019t bash him into a ball, she wouldn\u2019t be called Yao Si!</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>Yao Si felt her frustration rise. After being kidnaped so abruptly, she was now forced into being an NPC. Even though the NPCs in Nirvana were every bit like a person with a high level of freedom, it didn\u2019t change the fact that she was trapped.</p><br/><p>She headed toward the customer service center, but indeed, there was only an NPC in that place. Regardless of what she said, it did not believe that she was a bloodling, treating her mechanically as it had been programmed.</p><br/><p>According to Qu Ze, the game company had an employee come down for a check only once a month.</p><br/><p>This meant that Yao Si was stuck for a month! Everything in the game was closed off, so she wasn\u2019t even able to contact anyone.</p><br/><p>Once again, she felt the urge to beat Qu Ze into a swollen ball.</p><br/><p>But there were more pressing matters, like the vengeful players.</p><br/><p>[World]FromPlanetW: Did anyone see Running Qu?

Didn\u2019t it make it too easy? Now that she couldn\u2019t use her ability, she had no clue what to do next.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you smash something?\u201d she suggested. <em>Aren\u2019t you good at smashing doors?</em></p><br/><p>Bai Yi rolled his eyes. \u201cNot all doors are\u2026\u201d He stopped abruptly and pulled her into a corner. \u201cSomeone\u2019s here.\u201d</p><br/><p>The next moment, the door ahead burst open, revealing how abnormal it was. It retracted from the middle in all four directions, and had at least four layers of laser nets, while behind the nets was an even thicker door.</p><br/><p>Yao Si suddenly realized why there wasn\u2019t a need for guards. With this kind of defense system, not even a fly could enter. What was in basement five to warrant such security?</p><br/><p>They hid in the corner for two whole minutes before spotting a woman in a white coat bringing something out.</p><br/><p>Yao Si studied the person\u2019s head, and as expected, there was a pile of words atop it.</p><br/><p>[The researcher was prepared to endure a scolding from Boss Qu once she submitted the latest results. She was no longer willing to participate in this pointless experiment that brought no results. When she walked out the door, she was unaware that intruders had broken into the base. Or that she would soon be passing through the DNA secured door back into the basement five instead of delivering her results our, for she was about to faint from an attack by the intruders.]</p><br/><p>=.=!</p><br/><p>Yao Si\u2019s mouth twitched. She took a deep breath and ordered, \u201cBai Yi, stop her!\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Yi had utmost confidence in her ability, and without hesitation, he bolted forward, decisively striking the person\u2019s neck and knocking her out.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s next? How do we open the door?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe doors here are DNA secured, only the researchers can open it,\u201d Yao Si explained.</p><br/><p>Bai Yi frowned and brought up the woman lying on the floor. Just as he was about to pull her fingers toward the sensor, he hit the tray in her hands and scattered some of the test tubes. They were all crystal clear, and each of them had a different colored substances within them, though red substances formed the majority.</p><br/><p>Yao Si wasn\u2019t sure if she was hallucinating, but she could almost smell a floral scent from the test tubes.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d Bai Yi picked one up and gave it a press. The cap at the top of the test tube popped open, sending a sickly sweet scent into the air. \u201cIt.. smells good.. smells good.\u201d His gaze suddenly turned hazy.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Yao Si grabbed his hands when he was about to pour the liquid into his mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cTrying it!\u201d Bai Yi tugged his hands free, then told her hurriedly, \u201cIsn\u2019t this blood? It\u2019s the most fragrant one I\u2019ve smelled!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow can you drink an unknown substance like that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d He tossed her hands aside. \u201cI\u2019m a blooding, this won\u2019t kill me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStill, you can\u2019t drink it!\u201d Yao Si pressed his hands down once more. The subtitles had mentioned that these tubes were with research outcomes, so who knew what they really contained.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m hungry! Don\u2019t you know that bloodlings can\u2019t go hungry? Let go!\u201d Forcefully, he pushed her away.</p><br/><p>Yao Si stilled, her blood boiling up. <em>You won\u2019t listen? </em></p><br/><p>\u201cBai. Yi.\u201d She punched the back of his head, a burst of energy surging out instinctively when she hit him. \u201cShut your greedy mouth.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Yi froze, then unwitting shattered the test tube by exerting some strength. Only then did he regain his senses. His gaze cleared up, and a thin layer of sweat coated his forehead. He turned toward her, looking as if he had just woken up from a dream. \u201cI\u2026 just now\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cThe substance in the test tube must have contained hallucinogens.\u201d It must be the reason he had been tempted into trying out the unknown substance.</p><br/><p>\u201cHallucinogens?\u201d His face darkened. He flicked his arm violently, trying to get rid of the remainder of the substance. \u201cWhat\u2019s that? Why does it work against bloodlings?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid\u2026 it works not just on bloodlings\u2026\u201d Yao Si had a bad feeling about this. \u201cLet\u2019s take a look inside.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Yi nodded and switched his relaxed demeanor for a more serious and alert attitude.</p><br/><p>He placed all the test tubes back on the shelf before pulling the researcher\u2019s hand to the door. The next moment, the door burst open, the laser defense disappearing.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d Bai Yi stuffed the fainted researcher into the corner they were hiding before and rushed into the next room.</p><br/><p>Yao Si instantly followed behind him.</p><br/><p>They had an inkling about what research was being done in basement five, and all their doubts were assuaged once they entered it.</p><br/><p>The floor this basement was on was a few times bigger than the other floors. Even the first room they entered was the size of five soccer fields. At a glance, the room was filled with transparent containers filled with light yellow substance, inside which were familiar and unfamiliar looking organs. Some of them were even pulsing rhythmically.</p><br/><p>When they ventured forward, they saw containers filled with not just organ but entire body samples. They were bloated and had a white cast to them, having clearly been placed here a long time ago. There were more than a thousand such containers in this room.</p><br/><p>Yao Si\u2019s heart sank lower and lower, the ominous aura flooding her entire being.</p><br/><p>This base was\u2026 doing research on the bodies of different races.</p><br/><p>\u201cPresident!\u201d Bai Yi\u2019s face fell when he turned to glance at her.</p><br/><p>Yao Si nodded in understanding as they rushed forward, passing through this place that seemed like a exhibition grounds for the organs of various races. In front of them were several wide walkways leading to different places.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait! Let\u2019s head to the right.\u201d After reading the words above each walkway, Yao Si turned to the right. \u201cWe should be able to find Shucheng\u2019s location in the main control room.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d</p><br/><p>The main control room wasn\u2019t far, they could see it after just a short run. Bai Yi took a a step forth, and several screens appeared before him, each of them showing a different location.</p><br/><p>Yao Si scanned the screens, trying to spot Nephew Gu, just then a man\u2019s voice came from behind her.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho are you? Why are you in the main control room?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si\u2019s heart sank. What should she do?</p><br/><p>\u201cApologies!\u201d <em>Forget it. </em>She imitated Bai Yi and lifted her hand to hit the newcomer\u2019s neck. Once he fainted, they\u2019d have another man down.</p><br/><p>Just then, her hand bounced off. It was as though his neck was made of cotton candy, receding inwards with her hand. She could even hear a squishing sound. The moment her hand left, his neck bounced outwards to its original form. There was barely any bruise, much less any signs of him fainting.</p><br/><p>Yao Si, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The man, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p><em>F**k! Why is your neck so bouncy! Are you some sort of gummi bear? </em></p>\n</div>"}

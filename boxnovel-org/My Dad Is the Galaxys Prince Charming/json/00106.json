Hurry up and help Luo Ying!\u201d Yao Si tugged onto his hand. \u201cI promise I\u2019ll be home on time, not stray outside, and eat at least five bowls of duck blood curd every day! No, ten bowls!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat nonsense!\u201d Mu Xuan tapped her head, amusement brightening his eyes. \u201cWhat if you get a tummy ache?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDad\u2026 No, Mu Xuan, you treat me the best, you\u2019re the best father in the whole world!\u201d she hurriedly complimented. \u201cThen\u2026 Luo Ying?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou wish to save her?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEn, en, en!\u201d Very much, without a doubt!</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll save her!\u201d Mu Xuan sighed. Yes, I have to be the one to pamper my cub. He walked towards Luo Ying and inspected her.</p><br/><p>After that, he turned around and commanded, \u201cKnife.\u201d</p><br/><p>The three of them froze, turning over to the shelves in unison before turning back with a surgical knife in each of their hands.</p><br/><p>Mu Xuan\u2019s face darkened when he saw the three surgical knives that were being offered to him. Frowning, he sighed once more before grabbing the knife from Yao Si\u2019s hands. Focusing back on Luo Ying, he held out the arm that had been injured by Yuan Han.</p><br/><p>Yao Si held her breath, staring intently at his every move. The surgery is going to start just like that? What about cleaning and sterilizing the equipment or wearing the surgical gown?</p><br/><p>Mu Xuan decisively lifted the surgical knife, but instead of directing it at Luo Ying\u2019s arm, he made a cut in his own arm, and blood oozed out.</p><br/><p>\u201cMu Xuan!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Majesty!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Majesty!\u201d</p><br/><p>The three of them were in shock when Mu Xuan lifted his arm to pour some blood over the wound on Luo Ying\u2019s arm. In a few seconds, the blue glow surrounding her started to diminish rapidly, as though being forcefully suppressed. In less than two minutes, it was completely gone.</p><br/><p>\u201cOww, I\u2026\u201d Luo Ying started to shift in her bed, her eyes slowly opening.</p><br/><p>\u201cYing!\u201d Gu Shucheng hugged her tightly, as though she might fall at any moment. \u201cThat\u2019s great, that\u2019s great!\u201d The tears he had suppressed all along finally gushed out.</p><br/><p>\u201cFather?\u201d Luo Ying was in a daze, her face full of confusion. \u201cI\u2014 What happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou were infected by a virus,\u201d Gu Shucheng explained, \u201cbut you\u2019re fine now. It\u2019s all thanks to His Majesty\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He turned to his side to express his gratitude, but Mu Xuan was already at the door with his cub as though he couldn\u2019t bear to stay here any longer. \u201cWe\u2019re going home for dinner.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>Yao Si was dragged all the way back to Xuan Ying palace, which had been newly built! Initially, she had wanted to ask Mu Xuan about the virus, but his displeased look put her off. Obediently, she finished two bowls of duck blood curd.</p><br/><p>Now that Luo Ying was cured, a weight seemed to have been lifted off Yao Si\u2019s shoulders. Even her food seemed tastier than usual as she downed an extra bowl of rice.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m full!\u201d She placed the bowl down, turning toward a certain someone who was monitoring her, only to realise that he wasn\u2019t even looking in her direction. Mu Xuan was leaning back against the sofa. He seemed to be asleep, with an exhaustion she had never seen present in his features.</p><br/><p>Her heart sank when she remembered how he had used his blood to cure Luo Ying. Bloodlings were dependent on bloodline inheritance, so would there be any side effects?</p><br/><p>\u201cDad\u2026 Mu Xuan!\u201d She ran over, grabbing onto his hand anxiously. \u201cYou\u2026 What\u2019s wrong with you? Is it because I asked for you to cure Luo Ying\u2019s virus? Is that why\u2014\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine!\u201d Mu Xuan lifted his palm to caress her head. \u201cI\u2019m just a little tired.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally?\u201d She grew increasingly more worried. If it was really her request that had endangered him, she would feel like hell. \u201cDon\u2019t scare me, are you really alright? I\u2019ve never seen you like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>He lifted his eyelids to glance at her, and she thought she saw amusement in his eyes. In a deep voice, he said, \u201cI\u2019m fine, blood is indeed important to bloodlings, but it isn\u2019t that impactful. I\u2019m just exhausted from searching for you, I\u2019ll be fine after a short rest.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally?\u201d She inspected him, glancing around and poking him randomly, since his words didn\u2019t reassure her that much. His breathing seemed fine, his pulse seemed normal, and his heartbeat seemed all right as well. Was it really fine then? \u201cIs\u2026 is there anything I can do to help you? I\u2019ll remain fretful if I don\u2019t do something to alleviate this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mu Xuan pondered for a moment before nodding. \u201cThere\u2019s something.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>He abruptly reached his hand out and pulled her into his embrace before collapsing onto the sofa. Pressing close to her ear, he said warmly, \u201cBe good and accompany me for a while, I\u2019ll be fine tomorrow.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si froze, unsure if her burning face was due to his slightly warm body or something else. After taking a look at his exhausted self, she decided to stay motionless, curling tightly into a ball so that he could have more space.</p><br/><p>Ever since she was young, she had never slept beside a male. Originally, she believed that she would not be able to fall asleep, but that was not the case. It might have been because she was worn out from the day\u2019s events, or maybe because she was too comfortable in Mu Xuan\u2019s arms, or maybe even because the heartbeat beside her ear sounded like a lullaby.</p><br/><p>In less than two minutes, her eyelids started to droop, and she swiftly sunk into a deep sleep. When she woke up, she was clinging onto a certain someone like an octopus with its tentacles!</p><br/><p>Ehhhh\u2026</p><br/><p>Her lips twitched. Even though her sleeping posture had never been exemplary, this was the very first time it had gone so overboard.</p><br/><p>\u201cMu\u2026 Xuan?\u201d She glanced over at him awkwardly.</p><br/><p>\u201cMmh,\u201d he replied calmly. Clearly, he had been awake for quite some time, but hadn\u2019t woken her up or pushed her elsewhere.</p><br/><p>Guiltily, Yao Si glanced at how her limbs trapped him. Mmh, it was possible that he couldn\u2019t put her elsewhere.</p><br/><p>\u201cAwake?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEn!\u201d She nodded violently, retracting her paws in embarrassment. She had been sleeping like a log yesterday!</p><br/><p>Mu Xuan\u2019s face was calm, and he didn\u2019t seem to have any intention to blame her. He tugged at his badly wrinkled top. Near his collar, there were two barely visible red marks.</p><br/><p>What\u2019s that? Did I bite him? At such an intimate area?!</p><br/><p>She felt her cheeks burning. Even though she hadn\u2019t dated back on Earth and was considered to be single for a million years, was she really that desperate?</p><br/><p>This was her dad! Even though they weren\u2019t blood-related, he was still her dad! Besides, he was under the weather. Was she really a beast deep inside?</p><br/><p>No, no! I must be hallucinating. She should stop her wild thoughts. They had a pure and innocent relationship, that of father and daughter.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right!</p><br/><p>She inhaled deeply, counting upto a thousand internally: Rich and powerful, democratic, fair, harmonious\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you hungry?\u201d After arranging his top, Mu Xuan caressed her hair out of habit before pushing a stray hair behind her ear. The warmth from his finger brushed past her face, and as if a pebble had been tossed into calm waters, an unknown emotion was born within her.</p><br/><p>She trembled and took two steps back.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d His expression sunk, and he frowned instinctively.</p><br/><p>Yao Si stilled. Oh right, what\u2019s wrong with me? Isn\u2019t it a very normal action? It wasn\u2019t the first time he did it, so why was her heart racing like that\u2026 Why was there so much rubbish in her head?</p><br/><p>Yao Si gave up when she couldn\u2019t seem to figure things out. She inhaled deeply, tossed the pile of rubbish out of her mind, and calmed her racing heart. \u201cNothing\u2019s wrong, nothing\u2019s wrong. Dad, are you okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMmh.\u201d He nodded, then repeated the correction, \u201cMu Xuan!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMu Xuan, I\u2019m really hungry. What are we having today?\u201d she asked smoothly.</p><br/><p>He stood up and went straight for the kitchen. \u201cIt\u2019ll be ready in a bit.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>Yao Si finished her breakfast while making sure again and again that Mu Xuan was all right. When she was reassured that he was just exhausted the night before, she started to ask about the virus.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s called doomsday virus.\u201d Mu Xuan frowned when a seemingly upsetting thought occurred to him. After a moment, he added, \u201cThis virus originated in the Blue Planet about a billion years ago.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEarth!\u201d Yao Si\u2019s eyes went wide as she remembered the introduction given by Yan Xuan a while ago. \u201cDoomsday virus\u2026 You mean the virus that killed off all the earthlings?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMmh.\u201d He nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not right!\u201d Yao Si stated. \u201cAren\u2019t bloodlings immune to the virus?\u201d</p><br/><p>If they weren\u2019t, bloodlings would have perished with the earthlings many years ago. Besides, at the later stage, the virus had taken over all of the Earth, so there was no way that bloodlings could have survived and entered the Galaxy with the invasion of the bug race.</p><br/><p>\u201cBloodlings are indeed immune to the doomsday virus,\u201d Mu Xuan told her, \u201cbut not against the doomsday seed virus.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDoomsday seed virus?\u201d Yao Si stilled.</p><br/><p>Mu Xuan sighed, a thought seeming to have entered his mind. After a moment, he said, \u201cSisi, do you know how the first thirty generations of bloodlings, particularly the first ten, disappeared?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWasn\u2019t it\u2026 because of an internal war?\u201d Back when she was about to enter her hibernation, all the bloodlings seemed to be busy preparing for a war.</p><br/><p>\u201cInternal war?\u201d Mu Xuan stilled, pondering slightly before seeming to recall something. \u201cThe bloodline suppression of the first ten generations wasn\u2019t as severe. Before doomsday, there were indeed several internal wars, but the results weren\u2019t very impactful. At that time, even I wasn\u2019t qualified to battle.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what happened?\u201d When she had confirmed her bloodling status, there had been an order preventing all bloodlings below the fourth generation from participating in the war.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was because of the doomsday seed virus.\u201d Mu Xuan\u2019s face darkened. \u201cInitially, bloodlings were immune to the virus, so no one expected the virus to drive the bloodlings into extinction, and conversions had been rare. This was so until the day the doomsday seed virus appeared.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

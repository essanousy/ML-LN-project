Hurry, bring the supervisor of District 9 to identify the person.\u201d</p><br/><p>A leopard-headed man left instantly. In less than half a minute, he dragged over a middle-aged man of about forty years . The man was clothed entirely in blue working attire, his ash-colored hair an utter mess. He seemed to be in great fear as he trembled uncontrollably.</p><br/><p>Leopard-head dragged him to the front and shoved him onto the ground. He raised his head meekly, and his eyes widened when he caught sight of Lu Chen. \u201cManager Lu, you are here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSupervisor Yuan!\u201d They were obviously acquainted. \u201cThis\u2026 What exactly happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you are the manager of the Ore Planet.\u201d Before another word could be uttered, tiger-head\u2019s eyes lit up. He took a few steps forward to sweep Lu Chen up and down before he started to grin widely, even exposing his sharp teeth. \u201cYou must be a Lu Family member since your first name is Lu. I never expected to catch such a big fish! Hahaha!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWh-who are you? What exactly do you want?\u201d It was Lu Chen\u2019s first encounter of such a tricky situation, and he started to panic. \u201cDon\u2019t do anything rash; we can talk things out!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHeh, I\u2019m sure a manager like you is not be able to recognize measly workers like us.\u201d Tiger-head completely disregarded the weakling like Lu Chen and smirked. \u201cBut it\u2019s fine, soon, we beasts will get what we deserve.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cManager Lu, all the districts from 1 to 9 have been taken over by them,\u201d Supervisor Yuan explained while lying limply on the ground. \u201d The employees of the Ore Planet are all locked up. They wanted to entice bo\u2014\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShut up!\u201d Tiger-head struck him, cutting him off mid-sentence. \u201cThis is all because of your Lu Enterprise! Our race has been working diligently for so many years, but why do all the profits go to your people?! Isn\u2019t this considered slavery? We were forced into this rebellion!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true!\u201d Lu Chen rebutted anxiously. \u201cWe have a written agreement with all the beasts that we employ, and it\u2019s a legal employer-employee relationship. If you aren\u2019t willing, you can quit at any time. How is that slavery?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBullsh*t, it\u2019s all just talk. The pathetic amount of salary you pay us is nothing compared to the profits the Ore Planet brings.\u201d Tiger-head grabbed Lu Chen\u2019s collar. \u201cThe ores are all harvested by my race, so they belong to us. You guys didn\u2019t do anything but robbed the fruits of our labour. You\u2019re just a bunch of vampires trying to leech of us bests.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d The real vampires, Yao Si and Mu Xuan.</p><br/><p><em>It\u2019s alright to sprout rubbish, but no discrimination, please! </em></p><br/><p><em>What does this have to do with us?</em></p><br/><p>(\u256f\u2035\u25a1\u2032)\u256f\ufe35\u253b\u2501\u253b</p><br/><p>\u201cYou guys are just wearing a fake philanthropic mask to cheat my race into slaving away for you. Let me tell you, we bests have pride. From this moment on, we will get what we deserve and won\u2019t be exploited by your company anymore. We will not be slaves!\u201d tiger-head declared loudly, ending with his slogan.</p><br/><p>His words were followed by loud chants by the other bests.</p><br/><p>\u201cBeasts shall never be slaves!\u201d</p><br/><p><em>Enough! You could even drag another race into this\u2026 Isn\u2019t that line copied from someone else?! I could sue you for copyright issues! </em></p><br/><p>At least everything made sense now for Yao Si. The event was ignited due to the employee displeasure with their wages\u2026 so they decided to go on strike. But how did it escalate to their whole race and why were weapons being utilized in the process? She couldn\u2019t seem to understand. Was this the local Galactic custom?</p><br/><p>-_-|||</p><br/><p>\u201cErm\u2026\u201d Yao Si couldn\u2019t help raising her hand to interrupt. \u201cWhat exactly is your aim after such a lengthy discussion? Can you come to a conclusion already?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tiger-head stilled as though suddenly remembering his motives. He turned to signal the crowd with his gaze before pointing a gun toward Lu Chen. \u201cYou are a member of the Lu Family, so you must have the contacts of the owner of the Ore Planet. Call him immediately! As long as you transfer all the rights of the planet over to us beasts, we will assure your safety.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou want the Ore Planet? That\u2019s impossible!\u201d Lu Chen smirked, turning his head resolutely. \u201cThis planet is just managed by Lu Enterprise, but we do not have any shares in it. Besides, what you\u2019re doing is illegal! Anyways, I don\u2019t have the contacts of my boss, but even if I did, I wouldn\u2019t give them to you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood\u2026 good job there!\u201d Tiger-head narrowed his eyes at him. \u201cIf you don\u2019t cooperate, I\u2019ll kill everyone on this planet besides my kind. I\u2019ll see how Lu Enterprise will handle that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s start with you.\u201d He suddenly grabbed a large gun and aimed it at the ground with his hand on the trigger.</p><br/><p>\u201cSupervisor Yuan!\u201d Lu Chen\u2019s eyes went wide in disbelief.</p><br/><p><em>Hey, hey, hey, this is going too far </em>! Yao Si frowned. Even though the group\u2019s problems were a little eccentric, they could still be considered as part of internal conflict and not something in which she should interfere. But dragging innocent bystanders into this and threatening their lives was considered kidnapping and blackmail!</p><br/><p>\u201cI have activated the signal. Hurry and connect to the communicator!\u201d the tiger-headed man threatened once more. \u201cOr I will kill him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, alright, I-I\u2019ll connect\u2026\u201d Lu Chen paled, completely forgetting the two skilled bloodlings behind him. He gingerly tapped open the communicator and scrolled toward an account which was marked with high importance. \u201cLu Family prohibits anyone from disrupting the boss. Even though I have their number, I have never dialed it, so I can\u2019t be sure if anyone will pick up.\u201d</p><br/><p>That mysterious? Yao Si started to feel intrigued. Who could this unlucky boss who was about to be robbed be?</p><br/><p>Lu Chen clicked onto the account, and there was a light beep!</p><br/><p>The next moment\u2026 Yao Si\u2019s optical computer beeped.</p><br/><p>[Di! You have a new message request from Ore Planet on T Galactic, District 95]</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Yao Si.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Mu Xuan.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Lu Chen.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Crowd of beasts.</p><br/><p>(\u256f\u2035\u25a1\u2032)\u256f\ufe35\u253b\u2501\u253b</p><br/><p>This can\u2019t be happening\u2026 she is that unlucky boss!</p><br/><p>In an instant, everyone\u2019s attention shifted to her. Yao Si grimaced. How could that be? She opened her optical computer to take a closer look, but it was really a message from Lu Chen.</p><br/><p>She lifted her head toward him. Was he perhaps get himself out of the tricky situation?</p><br/><p>\u201cB-boss?!\u201d Lu Chen\u2019s eyes lit up like light bulbs.</p><br/><p><em>Hmm\u2026 the shock seems genuine. Alright, it was probably not an act after all! </em></p><br/><p>Then\u2026</p><br/><p><em>F*ck! When did I acquire the Ore Planet unknowingly? </em></p><br/><p><em>Wait a minute! </em>She suddenly remembered an incident from the past.</p><br/><p>\u201cErm\u2026 Lu Chen, do you happen to know Lu Ren?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lu?\u201d He stilled. \u201cHe\u2019s the current head of the Lu Family, the CEO of the Lu Enterprise.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>(\u2299_\u2299)</p><br/><p><em>F*ck!</em></p></div>\n</div>"}

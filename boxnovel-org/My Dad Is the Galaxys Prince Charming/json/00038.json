You chose the wrong hostage!</p><br/><p>The police officers in front that had been trying to persuade the criminal rushed forward without hesitation, swiftly advancing on him. A white gleam shone, brushing past Yao Si\u2019s ears. Thud! With a loud sound, it struck the person behind her.</p><br/><p>She felt the grip on her neck loosen and the person behind her collapsing weakly onto the floor.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss, are you okay?\u201d the head officer asked, looking at her with concern.</p><br/><p>Yao Si shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d She was just a little disappointed by this first kidnap experience.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good, that\u2019s good.\u201d The officer sighed in relief before breaking into a smile. \u201cThank you for your assistance, we\u2019ve been chasing him through a couple planets, and finally we have him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even though he sounded magnanimous, he often turned to look at her with guilt, as though afraid she would request something horrifying.</p><br/><p>Yao Si glanced at the culprit who had fainted. \u201cWhat crime did he commit?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a galactic pirate, he will often rob commercial vessels around F37, taking many lives in his wake.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh.\u201d He, indeed, seemed like a really bad person.</p><br/><p>\u201cEr\u2026 About this person, Miss Bloodling, do\u2026 do you have any more questions?\u201d</p><br/><p>Can victims of the galactic era have requests? Yao Si stood in a daze, then turned to look at the frightened manager. \u201cEr\u2026 Will you guys pay for the damages caused?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, of course.\u201d The officer nodded. \u201cI would like to express my utmost appreciation for these two citizens, if not for them, the process wouldn\u2019t have been so smooth.\u201d He nodded towards the other two. \u201cIt\u2019s a little urgent so I\u2019ll leave with the culprit now, what do you think\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh?!\u201d Yao Si was confused but still nodded. \u201cAlright.\u201d Why are they asking me?</p><br/><p>The head officer took a deep breath, as though having just unloaded a large burden off his shoulders. Turning to the group behind, he waved his arm. \u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d</p><br/><p>Half a moment later, another officer came forward and bent down toward the culprit. But just as he was about to push him into the aircraft, Yao Si felt a sudden irritable heat spreading through her. Faintly, she caught sight of a red gleam on the culprit\u2019s hands.</p><br/><p>Her heart sank. \u201cCareful!\u201d</p><br/><p>But it was too late. The next instant a blazing flame emerged from the man in black\u2019s body, diving down toward all of them.</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if I die, I\u2019ll drag everyone with me,\u201d he howled.</p><br/><p>The entire wall and the neighboring spacecraft were swallowed by the fiery inferno. Yao Si\u2019s heart sank, feeling doom settling over it.</p><br/><p>\u201cHeh, we were prepared for your ability.\u201d The head officer scoffed. He raised his arm to press a button, and the next moment a white light begun shining among the fire, a white protective layer forming around the policemen and the spacecraft.</p><br/><p>The blazing fire from the man in black was reflected from the white layer, bouncing back violently\u2026</p><br/><p>Just like that\u2026 It turned around\u2026</p><br/><p>Heading in Yao Si\u2019s direction!</p><br/><p>This was indeed an unlucky day.</p><br/><p>F*ck! Who did she offend to deserve such treatment!</p><br/><p>The scorching flames flew towards her, itching to engulf her. Yao Si cursed and swore internally, her heart going cold. Just then, a sudden unfamiliar energy gushed upwards, bursting from her tiny frame. Instinctively, she straightened her hands, releasing that frightening force.</p><br/><p>The room cleared in an instant! Only the sound of dripping water could be heard.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d What just happened? Yao Si thought.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Bloodlings sure are scary, the manager decided.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Do we still need to add on the space? wondered Old Liu.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d A certain overprotective father seemed to have sensed something wrong and entered the room. When he saw the drenched room, he headed towards Yao Si.</p><br/><p>His presence calmed her instantly, and an overwhelming sense of exhaustion and fatigue washed over her. Darkness clouded her vision, and she fainted.</p><br/><p>\u201cSisi!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>Recently, the members of the Galaxy had noticed that bloodlings that had been committing evil all most of the time suddenly had a change of nature. They no longer fought at the slightest displeasure and had even began to do good.</p><br/><p>At the beginning, a few crews of commercial vessels who sailed near F37 had been hijacked by galactic pirates, but just when they were certain that all hope was lost, a few bloodlings came out of nowhere. They used their abilities against the pirates, wiping all of them out before leaving.</p><br/><p>Initially, everyone assumed that the bloodlings were bored and wanted some fun.</p><br/><p>But these occurrences started to increase, and the bloodlings started to venture past F37 into other parts of the Galaxy. It grew to the point that as long as there were pirates, there would definitely be some bloodlings around to make them pay.</p><br/><p>The entire Galaxy was shocked.</p><br/><p>But that wasn\u2019t all, a few days later, the headquarters of The Galactic Alliance received a letter from the Red Planet\u2019s army. The letter only had a few words\u2014Where is the bastards nest?</p><br/><p>The Alliance marshal was full of confusion? Bastards? What bastards? This was after all an official letter, couldn\u2019t they be more serious and state the specifics? Even though the marshal was clearly annoyed, he didn\u2019t dare to confront them, worried of implicating the whole alliance.</p><br/><p>He panicked the entire night. The last time the alliance had received a notification from the bloodlings, it was before the zerg entered the museum. The marshal held an emergency meeting with the heads of the various races to analyze the bloodlings\u2019 latest mission, and together finally came to a conclusion.</p><br/><p>It seemed\u2026 that piracy seemed popular these days. Were the bloodlings perhaps referring to their nest?</p><br/><p>The marshal hesitated. If someone was going to die, it was better if it would be of benefit to everyone. The various races gave their support. Besides, galactic pirates were an old and pressing issue. However, due to their wide spread , unforeseeable approach, and distant location in the middle of the common galactic region, The Galactic Alliance was unable to to clear them out.</p><br/><p>The marshal decided that regardless of what the bloodlings were referring to, he would point them in that direction.</p><br/><p>Hence, he sent all the distant locations of the galactic pirates. He waited for the reply in apprehension, preparing for a response in case they weren\u2019t asking for the pirates but rather a certain clan.</p><br/><p>The response came swiftly, and with just one word\u2014Noted!</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>What did they mean? Why couldn\u2019t they specify! Who communicates like that?</p><br/><p>However, a week later the marshal finally got his answer. The galactic pirates that had been bothering the Galaxy for as long as a thousand years and against which the alliance had been helpless were wiped out in one night.</p><br/><p>The bloodlings who had always kept to themselves and avoided trouble had actually went to the trouble of wiping out all the pirates. The ruler of the bloodlings, Mu Xuan, had even personally headed to F37 to destroy one of their nests.</p><br/><p>The greatest plague of the Galaxy was uprooted by bloodlings just like that. It was even said that the bloodlings\u2019 internal department no longer greeted by asking \u201cHave you eaten?\u201d but rather \u201cAre you bored? Want to fight some pirates?\u201d</p><br/><p>From that moment on, no one dared to attack commercial vessels. Those that managed to escape death were the ones in prison, having already been caught. But even there, they trembled in fear at the thought of the bloodlings. Instantly, the bloodlings\u2019 image took a swift turn for the better. Mu Xuan, who was already a godly figure to the bloodlings, became even more revered and held in deeper regard, becoming the idol of the Galaxy.</p><br/><p>In contrast to such an event, something minor happened as well: The ruler of the bloodlings bought the Eternal Brightness planet. Since then, it was no longer the main planet of the Galactic Alliance but rather the bloodlings.</p>\n</div>"}

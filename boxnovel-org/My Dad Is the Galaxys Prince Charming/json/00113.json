Little Ball is bored, can Little Ball enter the Galactic web?]</p><br/><p>[Beloved dad! This Galactic web just can\u2019t do! Little Ball only used five seconds to break the firewall; it took ten seconds in the past!]</p><br/><p>[Beloved dad! The defence mechanism at home is too weak, can I hack into it?]</p><br/><p>[Beloved dad! Can Little Ball use your Galactic currency to buy a new shell? Little Ball wants a new set of clothes.]</p><br/><p>[Beloved dad\u2026]</p><br/><p>Ever since the smart system called Little Ball came back, he didn\u2019t stop yapping. The tiny ball was creating a ruckus, seemingly overjoyed at the prospect. The entire house was bustling with his childlike voice.</p><br/><p>Beloved dad\u2026</p><br/><p>Yao Si was displeased by the noise. Even though she understood that Mu Xuan was the creator, so the way he was being addressed was normal, but it had been her personal term before. To hear someone else calling him dad was uncomfortable.</p><br/><p>There was more than one child in the house now.</p><br/><p>The ball toured the entire house before returning to circle her curiously.</p><br/><p>[Eh, beloved dad, who\u2019s this person that followed us back?]</p><br/><p>Who followed you back! You\u2019re the one that followed us back!</p><br/><p>\u201cNumber 27.\u201d Mu Xuan reached out to grab the ball, stopping him from circling around. He then stuffed the ball into Yao Si\u2019s hands. \u201cSisi is my cub, register her dna data into your system. She will be your new master.\u201d He caressed her head affectionately, his face indulgent. \u201cHere\u2019s the ball you wanted, you can play with it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u25cb|\uffe3|_</p><br/><p>Yao Si was speechless. She had indeed mentioned that she liked the machine, but she hadn\u2019t been referring to the overly energetic ball! She glanced at it again. Hmm, it was better as a machine.</p><br/><p>[Cub?]</p><br/><p>Little Ball was motionless for a time, then turned around several times as though inspecting her. At that moment, a bright light grazed past her, exciting the ball.</p><br/><p>[Ding! Inspection complete! Wa, it\u2019s real, it\u2019s real! Your stats are the closest I\u2019ve seen to those of beloved dad! That\u2019s great, beloved dad really has a cub!]</p><br/><p>Little Ball started to jump and roll around her rapidly. When he finally thought of something, he returned back to her palms obediently, snuggling lovingly against her before shouting.</p><br/><p>[Beloved mum!]</p><br/><p>(\u256f\u2035\u25a1\u2032)\u256f\ufe35\u253b\u2501\u253b</p><br/><p>Beloved mum? They both addressed Mu Xuan as dad, so why did he push her up by one generation!</p><br/><p>Perhaps\u2026 Even the metal ball was aware of the common knowledge among bloodlings that she hadn\u2019t been aware about?</p><br/><p>At that instant, she could feel herself lowering the average intelligence level of the entire Galactic!</p><br/><p>[Beloved mum, Little Ball will be yours from now on; till death do us part!]</p><br/><p>[Beloved mum, Little Ball is very useful. As long as there is reception, I\u2019ll be able to hack anywhere.]</p><br/><p>[Beloved mum, is there anything you want to hack into? Galactic data or the Alliance? I\u2019m able to hack past any firewall.]</p><br/><p>[Beloved mum, with me around, the entire galactic is in your hands.]</p><br/><p>Yao Si face stiffened, remembering something, she said, \u201cErm\u2026 Was this how you talked to Yuan Han?\u201d Was Yuan Han\u2019s arrogance because of this system?</p><br/><p>[Er\u2026]</p><br/><p>Little Ball froze, suddenly remembering his \u2018ex\u2019. Its light dimmed. Looking devastated, the ball muttered weakly, [Little Ball wasn\u2019t fully awake at that time. I could only operate based on my data\u2014to protect anyone with pure earthling DNA. Only when I was awakened by beloved dad that my consciousness came back. Little Ball didn\u2019t mean to go against beloved mum\u2026]</p><br/><p>\u201cEarthling DNA?\u201d Yao Si turned to Mu Xuan in confusion.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat is the first rule of the primary program,\u201d Mu Xuan explained. \u201cWhen I designed him, I guessed that he would gain consciousness, so I added a few rules that he wouldn\u2019t be able to disobey without the master\u2019s orders. He wasn\u2019t allowed to harm bloodlings and was to use all possible means to protect anyone with earthling DNA. The latter holding priority over the former.\u201d</p><br/><p>This meant that in the face of both bloodlings and earthlings, Little Ball would prioritise the latter. This was easily understood since unconverted earthlings required more protection as compared to the immortal bloodlings.</p><br/><p>This explained why Little Ball had been protecting Yuan Han so relentlessly. But since Mu Xuan\u2019s orders was the highest order, Little Ball was able to awaken.</p><br/><p>Yuan Han was starting to sound increasingly more pathetic. Even though Number 27 hadn\u2019t been fully awake, Yuan Han could still be considered half of an ex-owner. Yet Yao Si had never expected that Number 27 might have treated him as an endangered species that required protection rather than a real owner!</p><br/><p>Time to light him a candle!</p><br/><p>\u201cOh right, why are you number 27?\u201d Yao Si asked. \u201cWere there 26 others before you?\u201d</p><br/><p>[Nope, Little Ball is unique.] Little Ball jumped up before continuing to speak. [Little Ball is called Number 27 because beloved dad was lonely. He felt that this number sounded like\u2026]</p><br/><p>Ding\u2026</p><br/><p>Before he could finish his sentence, Mu Xuan reached out to press a button, and the ball dimmed, falling motionless.</p><br/><p>Was he\u2026 switched off?</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s getting late. Let\u2019s eat!\u201d Mu Xuan said solemnly.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh?\u201d Yao Si looked down at the time. \u201cBut it\u2019s only two!\u201d Didn\u2019t they just finish their lunch?</p><br/><p>Mu Xuan froze for a while, then in a more solemn tone, \u201cI\u2019ll need time to prepare dinner, so I\u2019ll start now.\u201d He turned hurriedly and took the ball from her hands.</p><br/><p>Did duck blood curd really require four hours of preparation time? Yao Si was confused, feeling that Mu Xuan had entered the \u2018nanny\u2019 mode. She glanced at the bustling man and wondered if she was hallucinating again? Why did his neck look like there was an allergic reaction again?</p><br/><p>Yao Si was about to search for some medicine tackling allergies when the doorbell rang. She glanced at the screen\u2014Yao Qian.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you looking for Mu Xuan?\u201d She opened the door and turned on reflex, preparing to call Mu Xuan.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo! No!\u201d Yao Qian shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m here to find you, Your Highness.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMe?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d Yao Qian frowned. After a moment of hesitation, he said, \u201cFourth Elder\u2026 wishes to see Your Highness.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMe?\u201d Yao Si was surprised. Ever since they came back from Heavenly Bestowed Yard, both Fourth Elder and Yuan Han had been handed over to the Elder Council. Betrayal by a bloodling, especially one that was an elder, sent the entire Elder Council into a state of shock.</p><br/><p>Besides their detachment from the worldly affairs, their unity was another reason for their long-standing survival and instilled fear in the other races. Due to the suppression of the bloodline, the younger generations weren\u2019t able to harm the older generations.</p><br/><p>Betrayal by their own kin was something that had never happened before, so even the other Elders in the Elder Council weren\u2019t aware of the reasons behind Fourth Elder\u2019s actions.</p><br/><p>But why did he want to see her? Yao Si had never interacted with him a lot, their only private conversion being the day Luo Ying was contracted with the doomsday virus. Even though she was a fifth generation bloodling, shouldn\u2019t he be seeking Mu Xuan if he required someone of authority? So why her?</p><br/><p>\u201cDid he say why?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Qian shook his head. \u201cNo, since the day he came back from Heavenly Bestowed Yard, he has refused to speak, only requesting for your audience.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si formed her hands into fists. \u201cAlright, I\u2019ll go!\u201d After a brief consideration, she added, \u201cInform Bai Yi that I would like for him to accompany me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBai Yi?\u201d Yao Qian asked with confusion before remembering who he was. \u201cYes, Your Highness.\u201d He then turned around anxiously and headed out.</p><br/><p>Yao Si returned to inform Mu Xuan of the matter. Surprisingly, he merely instructed her to take care of her safety before continuing with his dinner preparations.</p><br/><p>When she was out, Mu Xuan turned to the ball. It was time to clear Number 27\u2019s memory.</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>Yao Si could barely recognise the Fourth Elder when they met. Even though she had seen him a few hours ago, he seemed to have aged drastically in that time, becoming smaller. His age and exhaustion became apparent; it was as though his entire spirit had been sucked away, leaving just the shell. Soulless and empty.</p><br/><p>He sat lifelessly on the chair, as motionless as a statue.</p><br/><p>Only when Yao Si appeared outside his cell did he finally lift his head to glance at her. He lifted the sides of his lips, seemingly breaking into a smile albeit looking bitter. \u201cYour Highness, you\u2019re here!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMmh.\u201d Yao Si sat down on the chair nearby, still unable to believe how he had managed to torture himself to such an extent in just a short few hours. \u201cI heard that you wanted to see me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fourth Elder fell into a short daze before regaining his senses. He stared at her for a long while, his gaze heavy. It made her heart sink.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can only tell Your Highness about it.\u201d His gaze started to falter, losing its focus. \u201cYour Highness, what do you want to know? I\u2019ll tell you everything. \u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si inhaled deeply. At least he was talking. \u201cWhy did you bribe Yuan Han?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause he is worthy of research.\u201d Fourth Elder then added, \u201cHe has perfect human DNA, which is exactly what the Heavenly Bestowed Yard needs. If we could replicate his DNA, we could potentially bring earthlings back.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou mean he really is an earthling?\u201d Yao Si exclaimed.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Surprisingly he denied her claim. \u201cHe is actually a clone from Heavenly Bestowed Yard.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA clone!\u201d This was indeed unexpected. Yao Si thought that he was like herself and had been sealed, only to be awakened not long ago. Or it may have been something more magical, such as being propelled through time. \u201cBut why?\u201d Why did he address himself as an earthling?</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not clear on the specifics yet, but he isn\u2019t the same as the other clones. He was able to gain sentience before conversion. Besides, he has a complete set of DNA memory. Thus, the day he woke up, he escaped from Heavenly Bestowed Yard and has been in hiding for five years.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cComplete set of DNA memory?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d The elder sighed. \u201cWhen we cloned him, we used an ordinary bloodling\u2019s separated earthling DNA, but somehow, he didn\u2019t inherit the bloodling\u2019s memory but instead got the original earthling\u2019s memory. He treated that memory as his own and saw himself as the person in the memory. Thus, he assumed that he was the last surviving human in the Galaxy.\u201d</p><br/><p>This meant that Yuan Han\u2019s memory wasn\u2019t his, but had been inherited, which resulted in a misconception. He had to really think that he was the main character of a time traveling drama!</p><br/><p>Er\u2026 then why does it seem like he\u2019s been suffering under a spell of bad luck?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

He immediately informed the Elders Council, sending people to the Heavenly Planet for investigation.</p><br/><p>A first generation bloodling that had ambiguous views about his own race was indeed worth the attention. Besides, it had been such a long time since the bloodlings had left earth, so why hadn\u2019t anyone heard of him? Where exactly did he come from?</p><br/><p>Yao Si started to form conjectures. Perhaps he was like her and had accidentally fallen asleep for many years, which allowed him to go unnoticed.</p><br/><p>However, Mu Xuan shot it down due to the Rainbow Pond in Heavenly Planet. Rainbow Pond had always been a mystery, with a general presumption being that it was a natural occurrence. However, that man had said that he was harvesting something there\u2026 and the half-formed beast had to have been connected to him. It was probably taken care of by him. For something like that to go unnoticed, he had to have technology that surpassed the current galactic standards.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t something a recently awakened bloodling would be able to do.</p><br/><p>Ever since they returned, Yao Si could sense Mu Xuan\u2019s anxiety. It was unlike before with Li Zheng, since Li Zheng was just a fourth generation bloodling. The newcomer was a first generation! Even though Mu Xuan had awakened the ancestral blood and would definitely defeat him in a battle, he had an Achilles heel\u2014her.</p><br/><p>Even though that man had called her a bastard, he didn\u2019t seem to hate the entire bloodling race since revenge at this point in time would be a little late. Instead, he seemed nonchalant, even if his disgust was apparent. However, his attitude toward Mu Xuan was totally different. Besides, he had mentioned\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cMu Xuan, what\u2019s a pure blood?\u201d Yao Si couldn\u2019t seem to figure it out. She had never come across such a term. Wasn\u2019t the only difference between the bloodings their generation?</p><br/><p>\u201cHe was probably referring to the ancestral blood that runs in me.\u201d Mu Xuan frowned while taking her hands into this. \u201cI\u2019m the only bloodling that awakened the ancestral blood while his blood\u2026 seemed weird.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWeird?\u201d Yao Si stilled. <em>What does that mean?</em></p><br/><p>Mu Xuan\u2019s brows slammed downwards. After half a minute, he seemed to have found a suitable explanation. \u201cBloodlings are all connected by the bloodline. Younger bloodlings aren\u2019t able to resist the control from senior bloodlings, but he\u2026 didn\u2019t have any connection! He seemed\u2026 totally different from us.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDifferent?\u201d Yao Si exclaimed. \u201cHe isn\u2019t a bloodling?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe is indeed a bloodling, but\u2026\u201d His face sunk as he sighed. He caressed her head. \u201cMaybe I\u2019m confused since it\u2019s been a while since I last saw bloodlings from the first generation? I can only be sure after we manage to find him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si was getting increasingly confused. Their problems seemed to be escalating. When she remembered how the person had just disappeared, she couldn\u2019t help asking, \u201cOh right, what exactly is his ability?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s mirage! His real body wasn\u2019t on the Heavenly Planet.\u201d It was how he managed to disappear so suddenly, his form had been just an illusion he had created. \u201cBut\u2026 he definitely has more than one ability.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe has other abilities?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat isn\u2019t all.\u201d Mu Xuan\u2019s expression turned grave. \u201cHe should have a full-series like me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Full-series!</p><br/><p>(\u2299_\u2299)</p><br/><p>Yao Si suddenly felt as though a strong boss had made its appearance.</p><br/><p>\u201cEven though I can\u2019t be sure of his motives, his attitude toward the bloodlings is definitely hostile. Sisi\u2026\u201d Just as he was about to start nagging, the notification of a message rang.</p><br/><p>He switched open his optical computer. Yao Qian, who had been tasked to investigate the matter, appeared on the screen.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Majesty, the results of the Heavenly Planet investigation are out!\u201d Yao Qian reported anxiously once the call went through, fully aware of Yao Si\u2019s presence.</p><br/><p>\u201cResults?\u201d Mu Xuan asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Majesty, you were right, that black hole is indeed a portal.\u201d Yao Qian pointed to the black hole in the middle of the planet\u2019s fragments. \u201cBut after running some tests, we found that the location isn\u2019t fixed under normal frequencies. We can only get a rough estimate of the location\u2014near the border of the Galaxy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBorder\u2026\u201d Mu Xuan sank into a moment of silence before saying, \u201cWhat about the beast? How\u2019s the investigation?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s even weirder.\u201d Yao Qian\u2019s expression crumbled as he reported the data with a hint of surprise. \u201cWe restored the beast\u2019s data and evaluated its genes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mu Xuan opened the data, and his frown deepened.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a young beast, no\u2026 to be exact, it\u2019s an embryo that is about 50% developed. It should have been fully formed in about two years. By then, it would be at least ten times bigger. A beast this size could only be\u2014\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGalactic beast,\u201d Mu Xuan interrupted.</p><br/><p>Yao Si stilled, sucking in a cold breath. A Galactic beast? Wasn\u2019t those only found in the abyss zone since they could grow big enough to engulf a planet? Why was it on the Heavenly Planet? Even though it was public land, it was considered to be in a centralized region that was eons away from the abyss zone.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe suspect that the black hole would be used to transport the beast over to the border.\u201d Yao Qian\u2019s face darkened, \u201cThat beast wasn\u2019t from the abyss.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhich means\u2026\u201d\u2014Mu Xuan sighed\u2014\u201dHeavenly Planet has always been a harvesting farm for the Galactic beasts.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Yao Si.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Mu Xuan.</p><br/><p>Yao Si could feel her heart sink. Even though she had considered the idea that the bastard had been using the Rainbow Pond as a harvesting farm, she had never expected the beasts he raised to be Galactic beasts!</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Majesty\u2026\u201d Yao Qian\u2019s face fell as he hesitated. \u201cAccording to my tests, the half-formed Galactic beast that you killed is of SSS level and above. A beast of this level has never been seen in the abyss, which means that they have been experimenting and advancing their knowledge. Besides, based on how often the Galactic beasts appear, there should be more than one of such harvesting farms.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI understand. Inform the Alliance and get them to investigate similar planets!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Your Majesty!\u201d Yao Qian did a salute upon completion of the report. However, his gaze suddenly flickered over to Yao Si.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnything else?\u201d Mu Xuan frowned.</p><br/><p>He hesitated slightly, taking another peek at Yao Si before stuttering, \u201cIt isn\u2019t anything important, but someone wanted me to pass a message to Her Highness\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Before he could finish his sentence, he was pushed out of the screen. A stunning face replaced him.</p><br/><p>\u201cSisi! You\u2019re Sisi, right? Sisi\u2026 I\u2019m Lian\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p><em>Thud!</em></p><br/><p>Mu Xuan turned the call off in a flash.</p><br/><p>He should have split the aves planet as well!</p></div>\n</div>"}

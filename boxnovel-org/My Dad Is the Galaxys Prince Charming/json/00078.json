But how could Yao Si complain when it had been so difficulty just to escape that gigantic sand beast\u2019s attack range. When she could, she couldn\u2019t resist switching on her optical computer to check the rank of the beast that was almost out of their sight.</p><br/><p>A few red words appeared: Level S+!</p><br/><p><em>F*ck! </em></p><br/><p><em>Something must have gone wrong, what is an S+ rank beast doing here, it isn\u2019t logical!</em></p><br/><p>Zan Zichen flew for half an hour, only landing when he made sure that the beast was no longer in sight. Once on the ground again, he leaned against a rock, panting heavily.</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks bro!\u201d Yao Si swiped the sweat off her forehead. Under such a critical situation, he still had went out of his way to bring her along, so he had to be a nice guy.</p><br/><p>Zan Zichen seemed to have exhausted all his energy. With a nonchalant wave, he brushed her off. When he finally calmed his breathing down, he said, \u201cIt\u2019s fine, you seem to be immune to the demonic energy, so with you around I won\u2019t have to worry about being invaded by that energy. I should really be the one thanking you.\u201d</p><br/><p><em>He\u2019s making sense! </em></p><br/><p>The oppressing sensation from before had stopped at some point. It seemed to have realized her resistance against its constant invasion. Zan Zichen had stopped waving his sword against his surroundings as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m\u2026\u201d Just then, she recalled the promise made with Daddy Mu and swiftly changed what she was planning to say. \u201cSi Yao, you can call me Si Yao!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss Si Yao.\u201d He sighed. \u201cThe demonic region runs far and wide, it\u2019ll be hard for us to leave. Besides, we don\u2019t even know the way, so we have to be extra careful\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know the way!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBesides, the demonic beast\u2026 Wait, what did you say?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have the map of the area, I can find the way out.\u201d To be more exact, she had a GPS.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>After a short while, Zan Zichen said, \u201cMiss Si Yao! This may seem a little rude, but\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you perhaps a spy from the demonic race?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>Yao Si struggled to describe the Optical Network GPS in terms he would understand. As she did so, he stilled, then after a long while he nodded with a somewhat confused expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou mean you have a magical device that can lead us to our destination?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEr\u2026 It\u2019s something like that!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it perhaps\u2026 the map of Mountain He Luo!\u201d His eyes widened. \u201cThat\u2019s a mythical device! I heard that it was created by a priest from above, only those of a certain rank are able to utilize it. \u201d He wrapped his hands in a greeting while adding enthusiastically, \u201cI apologize for my ignorance, do forgive this junior for not recognizing your rank.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe, hehe, hehehe\u2026\u201d Isn\u2019t the Optical Network GPS a standard accessory? \u201cYou\u2019re too kind, lets leave this place for now.\u201d She couldn\u2019t be sure what other beasts were present in this S+ area.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, my senior?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSpare the formalities, you can just call me by my name.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Senior Si.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d <em>All right, whatever floats your boat. </em></p><br/><p>When she switched on the GPS, a screen popped up, showing the entire map of the Shadow Planet. There were even name markings on the various regions. She took a specific look at her location and couldn\u2019t help cursing. They really sent her to the wrong location! She was actually in the ninth region, whose area spanned over half of the planet. What\u2019s worst was that the four week old beasts were all at least rank S. Fortunately though, she was at the edge of the region.</p><br/><p><em>The celestials\u2019 transportation can actually go wrong! </em> She had to complain about it when she got back!</p><br/><p>Yao Si tapped onto the third area, and the image made a rotation before it popped up from the screen. A soothing voice announced, [Welcome to the Virtuous Planet, it\u2019s my pleasure to be your guide! Your current trip is estimated to be 5567.33 kilometer long! I advise you to proceed with a miniature flying device!]</p><br/><p><em>What? Er\u2026 This seems like an interesting map!</em></p>\n</div>"}

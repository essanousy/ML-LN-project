She played the grand prince into a mess!</p><br/><p>If Mu Xuan hadn\u2019t suddenly fainted, she would have went on forever. Anyway, when she regained her senses, the conceited and stuck up grand prince was a mess\u2014blood and exposed flesh covering his whole face.</p><br/><p>Yao Si grew increasingly anxious when Mu Xuan didn\u2019t wake up even after three whole days, and her desire to bash the grand prince up began to burn within her once more.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry!\u201d Lin Long told her calmly. \u201cIf pure breeds could die so easily, we wouldn\u2019t suffer so much just to find our contractors. He\u2019s just in a temporary slumber after overexerting his ability and mental strength.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen will he wake up?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201d Lin Long shrugged.\u201d But with you around, he definitely won\u2019t be able to sleep for long. It\u2019s because of the over exertion, not his injuries, that he\u2019s like that. Once his ability recovers, he will awaken. His condition is much better than the grand prince\u2019s.\u201d</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t help trembling at the thought. \u201cThat reminds me, what\u2019s up with your mental strength? Isn\u2019t it a little too scary? Even the grand prince was defeated. You didn\u2019t just puncture his mental walls, but destroyed his whole consciousness. I\u2019m not sure if his ability will even be able to recover!\u201d</p><br/><p>After witnessing the scale of her wrath, he started to feel relief that she hadn\u2019t raged at him back when he had opposed Mu Xuan.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201d Yao Si shook her head. When she saw Mu Xuan being punctured by the red light ray, anger and anxiousness had drowned out all her logic, leaving only one thought: Kill! Like that, how could she have noticed anything else?</p><br/><p>\u201cAt that moment I\u2026\u201d When she regained her senses, the grand prince was already a mess!</p><br/><p>\u201cWas it perhaps an outburst of your mental strength?!\u201d Lin Long looked her up and down.</p><br/><p>Mental strength was basically one\u2019s consciousness, and under critical situations, it was possible to unleash an astonishing amount of it. He halted his questioning and instead adjusted his expression to one of utmost seriousness.</p><br/><p>\u201cEven though we successfully prevented the grand prince from delivering the message, it will be a matter of time before the others find out. We should start taking precautions since there will most probably be more than one grand prince visiting the next time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t there just one of them?\u201d The corners of Yao Si\u2019s lips twitched. \u201cHow many grand princes does your clan have?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen I left my world\u2026 If I were to add in the three elder grand princes, there would be\u2026\u201d He took a moment to calculate before providing an accurate number. \u201cFifty-six of them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFifty-six!\u201d Yao Si exclaimed. F*ck! She had expected a maximum of around ten, but there were fifty-six?! Fifty-six different communities, fifty-six flowers, fifty-six brothers\u2026 Ah! \u201cWhy are there so many?!\u201d It felt as though she had poked a grand prince nest.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey are called grand princes because their abilities being much stronger than those of the average pure breeds,\u201d Lin Long explained. \u201cThere are fifty-six such bloodlings, the most impressive of them being the three elder grand princes. Legend has it that their abilities are much stronger than even those of the grand princes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si frowned. If one grand prince was this hard to tackle, if they were to come all at once\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are they insisting on taking over this universe?\u201d She couldn\u2019t wrap her mind around it. \u201cJust because you and\u2026 Wang Erma managed to find your contractors, it doesn\u2019t mean the others would be able to find their contractors here, right?\u201d Judging from the grand prince\u2019s words, they intended to send their entire clan over to this universe.</p><br/><p>\u201cI suspected that in the past\u2026\u201d Lin Long\u2019s face sank, and his voice lowered. \u201cBut when I saw the grand prince, I started to feel that the other contractors might really all be in this world.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?!\u201d <em>F*ck, don\u2019t scare me. </em> \u201cWhy do you think so?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause\u2026 this could be our twin universe.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d <em>What the f*ck?</em></p><br/><p>\u201cEverything has two sides: Yin and Yang, Light and Dark, Life and Death,\u201d Lin Long explained. \u201cBut our clan is an exception. We never die, everyone living eternally in our world. Hence, we have a legend that in the infinite universes out there, there is one that is our twin, the one which would solve our immortality.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou mean\u2026\u201d Yao Si\u2019s heart sank. \u201cThey are convinced that this universe is their twin.\u201d</p><br/><p>He nodded. \u201cEvery pure breed that transcends to another universe is tasked with two other missions other than to find their contractor. The more important of the two is to find the twin universe, the universe where the majority of the contractors reside, but no one has succeeded thus far. It is considered a miracle to find a contractor among the infinite universes, but\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut you, Wang Erma, and Mu Xuan managed to find your contractors all in the same universe!\u201d Yao Si said. \u201cSo\u2026 they are convinced that this is the twin universe they have been looking for?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d</p><br/><p><em>F*ck! </em>This meant that regardless of whether the grand prince were to return, the others would still come over just because the contractors they had been looking for their entire lives might really be here.</p><br/><p>It was a f*cking stalemate!</p><br/><p>\u201cWait a minute!\u201d Yao Si said. \u201cDidn\u2019t you say you had two missions? What\u2019s the other one?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, the other one isn\u2019t related to this.\u201d He frowned slightly in confusion before explaining himself in a low voice. \u201cIt\u2019s to find the king of our clan. Legend has it that he is the strongest pure breed. He is the only other person other than our contractors who can grant us death. But this is just a legend. No one has ever seen him before, not even the grand princes. Hence we can\u2019t be sure of his existence.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si nodded. She stopped pursuing the topic as there were more pressing matters at the moment, like how was she going to deal with the impending war.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs there really no other solution?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaybe\u2026\u201d Lin Long frowned. \u201cThe grand prince might have a solution, but\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si understood. The prince had been battered to a bloody pulp and hadn\u2019t even recovered yet, not that he would ever tell them anything.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll need some thinking. For now, I\u2019ll check on the grand prince\u2019s condition.\u201d Lin Long pointed outside.</p><br/><p>Yao Si nodded and saw him out. Her nerves were all bundled up. Were they really going to fight a war? But with those perverted ancestors, even if all the bloodlings were summoned, they wouldn\u2019t stand a chance. The only one who could have a chance was Mu Xuan\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cYaoyao?\u201d A familiar voice called from behind.</p><br/><p>\u201cMu Xuan!\u201d Yao Si\u2019s heart leaped, and she turned to look at the person who had awakened on the bed. Her tensed up nerves from before soothed instantly, and she pounced straight on him.\u201dYou\u2019re finally awake!\u201d Suddenly, all the grievances went away, the past three days that had been both gruelling and unbearable.</p><br/><p>Reminded of his injury though, Yao Si straightened to inspect him. \u201cAre you alright? How is it? Do you feel unwell anywhere?\u201d</p><br/><p>Mu Xuan pulled her into his lap easily as he sat up. He hugged her with one arm and caressed her hair with the other. \u201cMmh, I\u2019m fine! I just\u2026 missed you.\u201d Without any warning, he suddenly lowered his head to kiss her.</p><br/><p>Yao Si stilled as the familiar face came closer, unable to process the situation. Whilst she was in a daze, his tongue probed into the depths of her mouth. It was totally unlike his past half-hearted attempts that were brief and bashful. His actions now were filled with tenderness and limitless supply of affection, sentiment. and adoration. Even an experienced Yao Si couldn\u2019t help but feel her heart race as her mind blanked out.</p><br/><p>What was wrong with Mu Xuan? Was he perhaps enlightened by the sleep?</p><br/><p>She couldn\u2019t be certain for exactly how long the kiss lasted, but when they finally stopped, she was slightly out of breath. All she could hear was Mu Xuan\u2019s rapid breathing as though he was struggling to suppress something. After a while, he spoke in an usually low tone. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d He tightened the hand over her waist while slowly pulling the other one that had at some point crept into her clothes.</p><br/><p>Yao Si took a while to process the situation. \u201c\u2026\u201d <em>Why are you apologizing? Continue, don\u2019t stop!</em></p><br/><p>\u201cYaoyao\u2026\u201d He caressed her face tenderly as his eyes shone with an inner light. \u201cI suddenly remembered some things from before Earth was destroyed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p><em>What?!</em></p><br/><p>(\u2299_\u2299)</p></div>\n</div>"}

Just as Yao Si was thinking what to do now, Bai Yi pried open a small opening and signaled her over. \u201cHere here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si followed behind instantly. The opening was tiny and could only fit one person at a time; it was most likely an air vent. They crawled into the ship and moved through it until they reached a store-like room. Bai Yi seemed familiar with the structure of the ship, for he tapped a button on the wall and closed the air vent. The moment they got more comfortable, the ship shook, probably taking flight to an unknown destination.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d Bai Yi seemed to have sensed her worry. \u201cI learned about the structure of such small ships three years ago. They aren\u2019t suited for long journeys and can\u2019t enter space portals. I\u2019m sure our destination isn\u2019t far.\u201d</p><br/><p>The ship shook once more, and a sea of white was the only thing one could see through the windows. The next moment, an electronic reminder popped out on the screen.</p><br/><p><em>Ding!</em></p><br/><p>[The ship is about to enter a space portal.]</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d <em>Didn\u2019t you say it can\u2019t go through portals?</em></p><br/><p>Bai Yi froze. He could vaguely hear a mocking laugh by his ears.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck, this ship must have been illegally modified,\u201d Chatterbox Bai said, attempting to retain his pride. The mistake was definitely not because of his limited knowledge.</p><br/><p>Yao Si dismissed him and thought to update Yao Qian about the situation, but she then realized that there wasn\u2019t any reception.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey should have a device that reflects signals,\u201d Bai Yi said, not the least bit worried as he found a box to sit on. \u201cLet\u2019s wait, we\u2019ll know what they\u2019re up to once the ship lands.\u201d Reaching into his pocket, he brought out a Popsicle like object. \u201cWant some instant duck blood curd? My treat.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d <em>Is this the time for that?</em></p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t like it?\u201d He reached into his pocket and started to fiddle around it once more. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, I also have other flavors. There\u2019s a floral one, seafood, fruit, and savory as well, want any of them? I also have the latest 5T drama downloaded, so it\u2019ll keep us occupied for the next four-five days, interested? Floating in space is the best time to watch dramas. My favorite ones is\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d <em>Is this a rescue mission or a vacation! Where\u2019s your sense of urgency? Isn\u2019t the person held captive your good friend? </em> \u201cDid you hear anything from your mind reading?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNothing\u2026\u201d Bai Yi answered calmly. \u201cI hadn\u2019t fully activated my ability, so I could only hear some random thoughts: The last bloodling we caught was\u2026 half a month\u2026 We don\u2019t have to monitor, he\u2019s dangerous. Stuff along those lines, and Gu Shucheng and Luo Ying are the only ones living near that area.\u201d</p><br/><p>This meant that Gu Shucheng was not on their ship but had been held captive for a long time now. Nephew Gu had been missing for almost half a month now. The time he was captured couldn\u2019t be much earlier than that. These three were most likely here to examine the situation, afraid that other bloodlings might have noticed something. Was this why Bai Yi decided to wait with her and follow them to their nest?</p><br/><p>\u201cThe very thought of a pathetic Gu Shucheng excites me!\u201d Bai Yi clenched his fists, his eyes bright. \u201cYou have no idea, ever since we were young, that guy was already an old soul, often poking his head into the business of others. Even though we\u2019re of the same generation, he would often chastise me as though I was his son. This time, it\u2019s finally his time to be the pathetic one one! I must be the first to ridicule him! <em>Hahaha! </em>\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEr\u2026\u201d Was that the only reason behind his hurry? \u201cAren\u2019t you worried?\u201d They were , after all, bosom friends since their birth.</p><br/><p>\u201cWorried?\u201d He stilled.</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause of his plight!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat a joke.\u201d He rolled his eyes. \u201cDo you think anyone can inflict harm on a bloodling?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEr\u2026\u201d <em>That sounds reasonable.</em></p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, even great danger does not matter much. We\u2019re immortal.\u201d He waved his hand and passed her another treat. \u201cYou really don\u2019t want one?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIts\u2026 okay.\u201d With such a nonchalant friend, should she help Newphew Gu by lighting a candle for him?</p><br/><p>The ship left the space portal after less than ten minutes inside it. Outside the window, there was an unfamiliar sight, vastly different from what Yao Si had seen in the Galaxy before. There were many tiny planets and star belts scattered around, but not many were fully formed. They were like an incomplete puzzle, many parts of which were missing.</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t this the Forgotten Dreams Galaxy?\u201d Bai Yi asked as he ate the duck blood curd.</p><br/><p>\u201cForgotten Dreams! Is this where the bus\u2019 mother planet was?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wasn\u2019t it a deserted planet now?</p><br/><p>\u201cMmh!\u201d Bai Yi nodded. \u201cSo this is where they hid them, I wonder if\u2014 Eh, quick, look there.\u201d</p><br/><p>He pointed toward the front, and Yao Si turned in the direction of his finger. In front of them was a place covered in pitch black darkness. Suddenly, though, that darkness was ripped apart, and a blue planet appeared before them. It was exceptionally small, like a big space station.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen did this Galaxy have a fully formed planet?\u201d When bloodlings joined the Galaxy, this place already on the verge of destruction. There was no way a formed planet could still be around here.</p><br/><p>Just then, footsteps came from outside. \u201cSomeone\u2019s here!\u201d Yao Si whisper-shouted and instinctively pulled Bai Yi into the air vent.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait, you can\u2019t!\u201d Before Bai Yi could finish his sentence, he was pushed in\u2026 successfully blocking the opening.</p><br/><p><em>F*ck, this isn\u2019t logical! We could clearly crawl through it a while ago! </em> The footsteps came increasingly closer, and Yao Si panicked. She pushed Bai Yi evne more aggressively.</p><br/><p>\u201cI told you I can\u2019t\u2026 Ouch, oww! It hurts\u2026 Can\u2019t we hide in another spot?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too late, why did you eat so much just now!\u201d His stomach probably hadn\u2019t been so stuffed before.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow you blame me, don\u2019t you know that bloodlings can\u2019t be starved?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI really had no clue.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026 you\u2026 outside.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShut your trap, hurry in!\u201d She pushed him in with all her might.</p><br/><p>With a pop, as though a carrot was pulled out, she finally managed to push him inside.</p><br/><p>The next moment, she rushed in after him, slamming the vent closed behind her.</p><br/><p>Two familiar figures\u2014they were part of the three men they had seen on the street\u2014walked into the room. They scanned the surroundings, then headed toward the overflowing boxes and each picked two before leaving.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Yao Si became aware of another problem. How was she going to pull the carrot out again?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you doing? Put down the staff, wait a minute\u2026 Not here! Ouch\u2026 It hurts\u2026 No!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShut up!\u201d</p>\n</div>"}

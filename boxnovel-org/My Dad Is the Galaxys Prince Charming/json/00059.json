He actually fell for that. \u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 gone.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d He heaved a sigh, worry still etched on his face. He swiped his collar a few more times. \u201cRight, judging from your clothes, you must be a guard from above? Are you here to deliver more resources?\u201d</p><br/><p>It only now dawned on Yao Si that she had changed into the guard\u2019s uniform.</p><br/><p>\u201cYea, yes!\u201d She nodded frantically. They just might be able to escape this successfully.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen why are you guys in the main control room? Don\u2019t you know that only researchers are allowed in basement five?\u201d He frowned, then added, \u201cAre you lost? Is that why you\u2019re here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si glanced at Bai Yi, nodding.</p><br/><p>\u201cI knew it.\u201d He nodded as well, now that his doubt was cleared. \u201cThe defense system of all five floors renews every ten minutes, even if you come to the main control room, you won\u2019t be able to find your way.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother, could you direct us?\u201d she asked smoothly.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can exit after turning right, even though I\u2019m just a small assistant here, I can still give an entry pass to you.\u201d He tapped his optical computer while casually walking toward the door.</p><br/><p>Yao Si heaved a sigh of relief, then took a good look above his head. Her heart sank. \u201cHe\u2019s going to sound the alarm! Bai Yi, stop him!\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Yi rushed forward, pinning the man to the floor so violently his shoulders went flat.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re one of the Elastics.\u201d Bai Yi pressed down on his squishy shoulders.</p><br/><p>Elastics? Squishy? The man seemed like a gummi!</p><br/><p>\u201cYou, what are you going to do?\u201d he asked frantically. \u201cI was going to offer you a way out, why are you capturing me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si walked forward. \u201cStop lying!\u201d The words above his head had long ago betrayed him. \u201cYou were clear that we don\u2019t belong here, so tell me, where\u2019s the bloodling you caught?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBloodling? What bloodling?\u201d He shook his head vigorously, pretending to be dumb.</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard that your race doesn\u2019t have any bones, just one slight weakness\u2026\u201d Bai Yi said in a wondering tone, his gaze shifting downwards to a certain area.</p><br/><p>The man shivered and brought his hands to shield himself. \u201cYou, what do you want? I don\u2019t know where they are.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you think I want to do?\u201d Bai Yi broke into a devilish smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be reckless!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I know my limits, you won\u2019t be hurt.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><br/><p><em>Eheheh?! Isn\u2019t this conversation getting weird? Why is there agitation on the man\u2019s face?</em></p><br/><p>Yao Si turned to stare at Bai Yi\u2019s actions. He had raised his hands toward the guards \u2013 bellybutton!</p><br/><p>He wailed in pain. \u201cOw! Ow! \u2026 It hurts, hurts!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si stared, speechless. <em>Erm, this is what you do after removing his pants?</em></p><br/><p>She would much rather read the words!</p><br/><p>Lifting her head towards the guard\u2019s head, she did just that.</p><br/><p>[As a timid Elastics researcher, he was terrified, but regardless of how scared he was, he would never reveal to the intruders that the the bloodlings were in the sampling room to the right of the main control room.]</p><br/><p>\u201cThey are in the sampling room on the right.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Yi froze. He then opened the door to the right, and the sampling room was indeed right there.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026 How did you know? Don\u2019t be reckless!\u201d</p><br/><p>[The researcher was not the least bit worried. Even if they knew the location, they would never know to close the poison gas before entering.]</p><br/><p>\u201cWait! There\u2019s a poisonous gas device there.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Yi instantly took several steps back.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow did you know that!\u201d he exclaimed.</p><br/><p>[The researcher still wasn\u2019t worried. Even if they knew about the poisonous gas, they would never know that its control was below the control table.]</p><br/><p>\u201cThe switch is below the control table.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Yi knelt down, there was indeed a red control button there.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>[The researcher still wasn\u2019t worried. Even if they managed to turn off the defense, they would never know that his DNA was required to enter the sampling room]</p><br/><p>\u201cHis DNA is required to open the sampling room\u2019s door.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>[The researcher was starting to worry. The intruders knew this base like the back of their hands, though could never know that he was Professor Fu who was in charge of this whole base.]</p><br/><p>\u201cBring him along, he\u2019s the person in charge of this experimental base!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d <em>I shouldn\u2019t have gone to the toilet\u2026</em></p><br/><p>Yao Si glanced at Elastic professor\u2019s words as she switched off the various defensive systems according to what she read in the subtitles.</p><br/><p>A certain someone remained in a daze the entire time, only regaining his senses later. Trembling, he pointed at her. \u201cYou-you have an ability. It\u2019s to read minds, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>The real mind reader Bai Yi did not have anything to say. Why did he seem like somebody of lower level?</p><br/><p>[The researcher began to randomize his thoughts to prevent Yao Si from reading his mind, but he didn\u2019t know that her ability was to form subtitles, not to read minds. It was just like how it could only form the passcode for the sampling room: 00769]</p><br/><p>\u201cThe code is 00769!\u201d <em>Thanks, Elastic professor. </em></p><br/><p>Mr. Candy was in a daze.</p><br/><p>Bai Yi sighed, then tapped the man\u2019s chest. \u201cTrust me, she can\u2019t read minds. It\u2019s an external ability, so all those distractions you\u2019re planting in your mind won\u2019t affect her.\u201d He himself wasn\u2019t interested either\u2026.</p><br/><p>Elastic professor did not have a way to respond to that.</p><br/><p>After a few creeks, the sampling room\u2019s door unlocked.</p><br/><p>Yao Si entered first. Inside, there were a couple people in white gowns around an operating table, preparing to start their work. When they heard the door open, the whole group turned in unison, and this time Bai Yi did not need a reminder. He rushed forward and incapacitated all of them.</p><br/><p>Luckily, there wasn\u2019t anyone else from the Elastic race.</p><br/><p>Yao Si\u2019s heart tightened. She had never expected the researchers to have harmed the bloodlings. In a hurry, she ran toward the operating table.</p><br/><p>\u201cNephew Gu, you\u2026 Luo Ying!\u201d</p><br/><p>There was a person lying on the lit up transparent operating table, but it wasn\u2019t Nephew Gu. It was his cub, Luo Ying, instead, and she was clearly held in captivity.</p><br/><p>Why was she here?</p><br/><p>\u201cLuo Ying! Luo Ying!\u201d Bai Yi came over and tapped her face, but she remained unresponsive, as though fast asleep. \u201cWhat should we do?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si turned to look toward the professor. The subtitles were as reliable as wever. \u201cShe\u2019s been injected with an inhibitor. The blue needle contains the antidote.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Yi grabbed the blue needle on the right and jabbed it into Luo Ying\u2019s arm. Once the liquid entered her system, she finally reacted, by taking a deep breath and waking up.</p><br/><p>\u201cBai Yi?\u201d She hesitated, confusion flashing past her eyes. She then turned and saw Yao Si. \u201cPresident? What are you\u2026 Right! Shucheng!\u201d She bolted up abruptly. \u201cDid you see Shucheng? I thought I saw him fainted near\u2014\u201d</p><br/><p><em>Diiiiiiiiiiiiing!</em></p><br/><p>Before she could finish her sentence, a siren sounded through the base.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p>\n</div>"}

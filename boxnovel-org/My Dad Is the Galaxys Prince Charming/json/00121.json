You actually have partners among celestials!\u201d Qu Ze teased.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder\u2026 They are just friends, not partners!\u201d Yan Xuan stiffened. <em>Why would I need a partner. I have a cub, alright?</em></p><br/><p>\u201cAye, don\u2019t sweat the small stuff.\u201d Qu Ze tapped his shoulders before donning his detestable signature smile.</p><br/><p>Yan Xuan felt a chill run his back and backed away discreetly. His gut was telling him to stay away if he cherished his life.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince you have friends, hurry and get them for questioning\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He nodded before switching on his communication device. In less than a second, a familiar voice came through.</p><br/><p>\u201cYan Xuan? Why are you calling at this hour?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Xuan glanced at the crowd, coughing once. \u201cLi Yue, there are some matters about which I would like to ask you in person. Could you come to Red Planet?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRed Planet?\u201d The person remained silent for a while. \u201cWhat\u2019s with the sudden invitation? Do you need me to care for another trouble-making cub?\u201d</p><br/><p>Trouble-making cub? Yao Si stilled. Was that fired toward her?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat rubbish!\u201d Yan Xuan\u2019s heart raced as he took a glance at His Majesty. How could he badmouth His Majesty\u2019s cub in front of him! \u201cIt\u2019s something important, so could you hurry?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s possible\u2026\u201d Li Yue seemed to have met with a difficulty. \u201cBut not now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause\u2026\u201d He coughed once, seemingly caught in an awkward situation. After half a minute, he added, \u201cAnyway, I\u2019m busy. Give me\u2026 a while.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat urgent matters are you tending to?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI really have something going on!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you up to Li Yue? Let me tell you, this is an extremely important affair. It concerns both bloodlings and celestials!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRegardless of the importance, it has to wait for thirty minutes\u2026 No, about an hour\u2026\u201d He coughed once more before explaining, \u201cAs you know, my disciple Li Jie recently went through his experience, because of which I suffered some injuries. I won\u2019t be able to travel with my sword, so\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can take a Galactic aircraft.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRecently, the flights to Red Planet have been delayed by three hours at the least.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Yan Xuan\u2019s lips quivered. How could that happen at such an important time? What kind of partner was he? Psh, friend.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, you can come\u2014\u201d He was going to say \u2018in a while\u2019, but was cut off.</p><br/><p>Mu Xuan suddenly instructed, \u201cIt\u2019s not necessary.\u201d With a wave of his hand, he summoned a black space portal which pulled the person over. With a loud thud, a figure came falling out and landed on the ground. It was followed by a loud splash of water.</p><br/><p>Yes, a splash of water, the kind that came with bubbles.</p><br/><p>Bubbles covered the ground, and in the middle of them was a figure about five foot tall, with hair reaching its waist. The person wasn\u2019t wearing a single piece of clothing as he gawked at them with his mouth open.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Yan Xuan.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Yao Qian.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Qu Ze.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Yao Si.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Mu Xuan.</p><br/><p>They finally understood his reluctance; it was because he was bathing! He even had a cartoon shower cap on and was holding a yellow rubber duck while soaking in a pink bubbly bath.</p><br/><p>Silence engulfed the room, and everyone seemed to have understood something. This celestial was\u2026 unique!</p><br/><p>(\u2299_\u2299)</p><br/><p>The next moment, Yao Si\u2019s vision darkened, for a large palm covered her eyes. A low and chilly voice spoke by her ear.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot for kids!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si started cursing internally. <em>Do you know what you\u2019re saying?! You\u2019re the kid!</em></p><br/><p>(\u256f\u2035\u25a1\u2032)\u256f\ufe35\u253b\u2501\u253b</p><br/><p>Clearly startled, Li Yue froze for a few seconds. Even the hand that was scratching an itch on his leg stopped moving. After half a minute, he cursed loudly, \u201cF*ck!\u201d</p><br/><p>He fished a towel out of thin air and wrapped himself, disregarding the pink bubbles that covered his body. Glaring at Yan Xuan, he began to scream. \u201cYan Xuan, are you f*cking kidding me? What kind of friend are you? What did you pull me over for? Who the f*ck created the portal?! I\u2019m going to f*cking kill him!\u201d</p><br/><p>All eyes turned in unison toward a certain someone who was covering his cub\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cBlood\u2026 bloodling\u2026 king!\u201d Only then did Li Yue become aware of the other people in the room, and his anger extinguished instantly. Even though he couldn\u2019t recognize most people, he knew how Mu Xuan looked like\u2026 Everyone in the Galaxy grew up with his image.</p><br/><p>Li Yu\u2019es expression twisted, and he clenched his fists, then offered a polite bow. \u201cLi Yue is at your service, Your Majesty.\u201d</p><br/><p>As expected, his persona switching abilities were superb.</p><br/><p>Mu Xuan looked him up and down before commanding, \u201cPut on some clothes!\u201d</p><br/><p>-_-|||</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u201cNirvana?\u201d To make himself presentable, Li Yue wrapped three layers of clothes around himself. \u201cIsn\u2019t that the demonic clan\u2019s region?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDemonic clan?\u201d <em>What is that?</em></p><br/><p>\u201cBefore celestials advance, they are simple cultivators. We are thus categorized into either celestials or demons according to the different abilities we practice,\u201d Li Yue explained. \u201cAfter advancing, celestial cultivators become celestials while demonic cultivators become demons.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you all belong to a single race?\u201d Yao Si asked. She had only heard of celestials, but never demons.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe are one indeed. But every ten years, there would be an internal election to decide on the name of the race, and we would go with the majority. However, these few years, there haven\u2019t been many people who managed to successfully cultivate into becoming demons,\u201d Li Yue explained solemnly.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d <em>Aren\u2019t you a little too willful?!</em></p><br/><p>\u201cEh\u2026 Both celestials and demons originate from the same roots. Even though we seem to be on good terms, there is actually turmoil. Mmh, it can be considered as internal conflict.\u201d He glanced over at Yan Xuan before adding, \u201cNirvana, which you mentioned before, may belong to celestial company on the surface, but it is actually a property of Heavenly Demon Xing Chong.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHeavenly Demon Xing Chong?\u201d Yan Xuan stilled, a thought striking him. \u201cThat bastard you always talk about?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d Li Yue nodded. \u201cHe is skilled in rituals and hallucination spells, and often uses his powers to bewitch others. Before he advanced, he was already considered a monster in the prehistoric planet. His motive for creating real-life game planets was purely to increase his cultivation,\u201d Li Yue explained with a disgusted expression. The dispute between the two clans seemed to be rather serious.</p><br/><p>\u201cRituals and hallucinations?\u201d Yao Si stilled, a sudden thought striking her. \u201cIs there any that could affect one\u2019s thoughts, something that is effective against bloodlings and would obstruct them from entering?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Yue pondered it before replying with some uncertainty. \u201cThat\u2019s a conscience hallucination. With Heavenly Demon Xing Chong\u2019s cultivation, there is no doubt that he would be able to do that. But in the face of someone with higher mental strength, the spell would not be useful.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si\u2019s spirits lifted, and she exchanged a glance with Qu Ze before they asked in unison, \u201cWhere is he?\u201d</p><br/><p>The mental barrier in Nirvana was definitely a conscience hallucination!</p></div>\n</div>"}

Once the crisis had been dealt with, there would be tons of opportunities. Erm\u2026 hopefully?</p><br/><p>The grand prince was locked in the most secure and guarded cell in the whole bloodling prison. The cell was made from a material that could restrict the use of abilities, preventing even the strongest powers from being activated.</p><br/><p>On top of that, the battle from before had left the grand prince\u2019s mental strength in shambles, and it would take him a few hundred years to recover from it. Without his mental strength, he would not be able to activate his ability, making an escape impossible.</p><br/><p>After Li Zheng and Bai Yi had completed their coming of age test, they were coincidentally allocated to taking care of this cell, which was why they had been in charge of delivering news to Yao Si.</p><br/><p>Before she reached the cell, she could already hear the grand prince\u2019s disdainful voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cHeh, you lowly people dare to negotiate with me? There isn\u2019t a way out of this. And even if there was, why would I tell you? It\u2019s only a matter of time before this universe belongs to us.\u201d</p><br/><p>His tone was enough to paint an image of his insufferable arrogance. Yao Si\u2019s expression sank, and she exchanged a glance with Mu Xuan before opening the door to enter.</p><br/><p>The room was separated into two by a transparent protective wall in the middle. The grand prince was locked inside while Li Zheng and Bai Yi were standing guard by the wall. Lin Long sat at the corner on their side.</p><br/><p>Upon their entrance, the imprisoned man happened to look up. The moment he laid eyes on Yao Si, he was visibly startled, and his legs shook as though suppressing an innate reaction to bolt upright. The disdain on his face paled slightly, replaced by caution. \u201cIt\u2019s you! You\u2026 What do you intend to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>Was Yao Si mistaken? Didn\u2019t he seem afraid of her? When she recalled his plight before\u2026 Mmh, there was enough reason for him to be afraid.</p><br/><p>\u201cDad, you\u2019re here!\u201d Li Zheng glanced at her in surprise. \u201cThat\u2019s fast!\u201d He turned to glance meaningfully at Mu Xuan.</p><br/><p>\u201cGet lost!\u201d She kicked him aside. \u201cWe rushed over immediately.\u201d <em>How dare you still make a remark, you unfilial son. </em></p><br/><p>She ignored him and headed toward Lin Long who was sitting in front of the grand prince. \u201cErgou, how is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Long shook his head, the grand prince obviously wasn\u2019t being cooperative.</p><br/><p>\u201cGive up!\u201d The grand prince smirked. \u201cWe would never let go of this universe, so there isn\u2019t any meaning in holding me captive? They\u2019ll come down when they figure out that I\u2019ve met with trouble.\u201d He glanced at Yao Si in a provoking manner that held a hint of resentment. \u201cSo what if your mental strength is strong? Even if you manage to stop me, can you stop millions of people like me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He was right, which was her greatest worry. If they really mobilized their entire clan, her world was doomed.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I\u2019m not wrong, there aren\u2019t many people in this universe with mental strength comparable to yours!\u201d The grand prince grew increasingly aggressive, looking over everyone in the room as though they were already dead. \u201cEven if you destroyed the portal, we can create ten more or even a hundred more from that planet. No one can stop us.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPlanet!\u201d Yao Si\u2019s heart quivered when she detected his slip. \u201cDoes the portal have to be opened in the Blue Planet?\u201d</p><br/><p>The grand prince stilled, his expression freezing.</p><br/><p>This further confirmed her point, and she remembered Lin Long mentioning that he reconstructed the Blue Planet to serve as an anchor point to link back to his universe.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe blue planet is the key!\u201d She turned to Mu Xuan. \u201cWe have to destroy the reconstructed planet as soon as possible.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Long\u2019s face lit up, and he prepared to leave with them.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait a minute! Even if you destroy the planet, how long can you last?\u201d The grand prince scoffed with resentment. He seemed to have calmed from his previous frantic state, and his tone returned to being sour and condescending. \u201cEven if you stop us this time, can you stop us forever?\u201d He glanced at Lin Long. \u201cEven a normal pure breed can reconstruct the planet, so do you think no one else can? Heh! It\u2019s just a matter of time, and that\u2019s precisely what we have in abundance!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour actions would only serve to further infuriate my clan.\u201d He adjusted his clothes, treating them as a joke. \u201cLet\u2019s make a bet on the first thing they would do when they arrive\u2026\u201d He scanned the crowd before focusing on Li Zheng and Bai Yi. \u201cWe would go all out to kill all of you ignorant bastards.\u201d</p><br/><p>F*ck! Why was he so annoying? Unfortunately, the truth was as he had told it.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou in particular!\u201d He turned abruptly to glare at Yao Si with a murderous intent. His smile turned sly. \u201cI\u2019ll definitely repay your previous care. So what if you are a contractor? Those who betray the clan would never be able to escape.\u201d</p><br/><p>He seemed unaware of everyone\u2019s darkened face as he continued on with arrogance as though victory was in his hands. His gaze was freezing cold. \u201cAt that time, I\u2019ll let you personally witness the death of your loved ones.\u201d</p><br/><p>F*ck! Yao Si was on the verge of exploding. <em>Don\u2019t even try stopping me, I\u2019m going to murder this little b*tch! </em></p><br/><p>Her hands curled into fists, but just as she was about to step forward, someone else beat her to it.</p><br/><p>\u201cShut up!\u201d Li Zheng who was the nearest rushed forward. He raised his fist and smashed it straight against the irritable face. \u201cF*ck you! You little punk better show some respect. How dare you lowly prisoner threaten Her Highness! You haven\u2019t gained permission from the bloodlings!\u201d</p><br/><p>His punch held no mercy, sending the grand prince flying with a resounding thud when he smashed against the wall.</p><br/><p>\u201cLi Zheng!\u201d Yao Si\u2019s heart clenched. F*ck, was that guy seeking death? He wasn\u2019t this filial before this! They were faced with an ancestor grand prince, so even if he couldn\u2019t use his ability right now, he might still have other tricks up his sleeve.</p><br/><p>But Li Zheng continued to go after him fearlessly, yanking his collar up, prepared to continue his beating. \u201cGrandpa, I\u2019ll teach you how to be a good person!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d The grandprince caught hold of Li Zheng\u2019s arm before his punch fell, stopping him midway. \u201cYou\u2026 Are you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p><em>F*ck!</em></p><br/><p>Yao Si shook, prepared to save him only to be halted by the grand prince\u2019s suddenly agitated voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are Li Zheng? How old are you? Are you married yet? Do you have a girlfriend? I\u2019m Yu Zhe, what are your thoughts on getting a boyfriend?</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Li Zheng.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Yao Si.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Mu Xuan.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Lin Long.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Bai Yi.</p><br/><p><em>This is absurd!</em></p><br/><p>(\u2299_\u2299)</p></div>\n</div>"}

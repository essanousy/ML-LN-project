He took a look at the giant black mass in front of him, then turned to look at the deputy who was reporting to him. \u201cWhat about planetary scan? Have you done it yet?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been completed,\u201d the deputy commander replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow many times?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThree times, no evidence of life signs.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLife signs?\u201d His brows stitched together.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t discovered any biological signs either.\u201d Understanding what he was asking, the deputy immediately added another sentence.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d Lu Ren was finally able to ease his heart. \u201cYou must be thorough with these scans, if you missed anything, neither of us could bear the responsibility, understood?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes! I will make sure nothing goes wrong.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not good enough!\u201d Lu Ren exclaimed. \u201cIt must be hundred percent that no mistakes are made.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, commander.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Only then did Lu Ren nod in satisfaction. \u201cBy the way, how\u2019s the unconscious person that we found not long ago? Have you found out what race she\u2019s from?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe has been awake for a few days.\u201d The deputy commander clicked the optical computer on his hand and transferred the documents over. \u201cThe medical team has already examined her. She doesn\u2019t have any external injuries, but due to her long coma, her brain doesn\u2019t seem to function well. Temporarily, she can\u2019t recall her own race.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf she can\u2019t remember then test her genes, I don\u2019t believe that we can\u2019t figure it out.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d The deputy saluted, then turned and pointed at the planet before him that began to crack on the surface. \u201cAnd the planet termination plan\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Ren lurched forward, straightening his seating posture. \u201cLet\u2019s initiate the plan!\u201d he said and slapped with his palm the red button in front of him.</p><br/><p>An emotionless machine frequency immediately sounded.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe planet termination plan initiated, one minute count-down, 59, 58, 57\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>_______</p><br/><p>At the same time Yao Si was in the infirmary\u2026</p><br/><p>Her face was filled with confusion, and she really wanted a watermelon to calm herself.</p><br/><p>\u201cDoctor, come again, what year is this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight now is the year 9516 of the galactic calender, today is the eighth of June.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGalactic calender, what\u2026\u201d She had only heard of the lunar calender, the solar calender, the Julian calender, and the Georgian calender, what the hell was this galactic calender?</p><br/><p>\u201cYear 9516!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen can I ask, how far is this galactic calender date from year 2017 of the Julian calender?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Julian calender? Aren\u2019t those pre-historic years?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPre\u2026Pre-historic!\u201d</p><br/><p>No way, she was there just yesterday!</p><br/><p>\u201cHave you remembered anything? Don\u2019t worry, you\u2019ve been asleep for too long. You are suffering from neural damage in the brain, there will be a period of time where your memories are jumbled up,\u201d the female doctor in white comforted. \u201cDon\u2019t rush yourself trying to remember things, everything will be better once you rest a bit more and get in contact with people\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si thought that she probably was not going to get any better, because she seemed to have accidentally\u2026 slept through the end of time.</p><br/><p>As a person who had recently been informed that she wasn\u2019t human, she had now woken up after god-knows how many years in the blink of an eye.</p><br/><p>\u2018Do we really have to be so fast paced? You barely leave enough time for the readers to react!</p><br/><p>And where in the world is this place?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is the No.333 space station of the T region.\u201d Probably realizing her questions, the female doctor comforted her in a gentle voice. \u201cMy last name is Wang, I\u2019m your physician. Let your heart calm down, you are perfectly safe in\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Before she had the opportunity to finish her sentence, a beeping warning tone boomed through the entire room, accompanied by the sound of a countdown.</p><br/><p>Yao Si had a jump scare. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?!\u201d What about the safety you promised?</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s finally starting.\u201d Dr. Wang had an overwhelming sense of excitement.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2026What has began?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe planet termination.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPlanet termination?\u201d What is that?</p><br/><p>\u201cPlanet termination is\u2026 Oh, let me just show you since you need to walk about anyways, it\u2019s good for your condition.\u201d After saying that, Dr. Wang pulled her hand to drag her out. \u201cDon\u2019t forget the translation device, otherwise you won\u2019t understand the commentaries.\u201d</p><br/><p>Having been reminded, Yao Si took the silver earring-like object from the bedside and followed her out. When she had just woken up, she couldn\u2019t understand what the people around her were saying until the girl placed this beside her bed. Thanks to this high-tech device, she could then finally understand what everyone was speaking about.</p><br/><p>Dr. Wang took her onto a very vast platform that was surrounded by pitch-black sky filled with stars. It seemed to be endless at a glance, with some small and big planets floating around. Although Dr. Wang had told her that this was a space station, she was still unable to comprehend that for the longest time. Only when she saw the starry sky did she have the real sense of what it felt like being out in the galaxy. She also suddenly understood what \u201cthe sea of stars\u201d meant!</p><br/><p>This wasn\u2019t a dream, she had really slept till the galactic ages!</p><br/><p>\u201cHey girl, over here, here, quickly.\u201d</p><br/><p>The platform was already filled with many people. Dr. Wang had found a good spot and was now waving at her to come over.</p><br/><p>Yao Si went to her. She only realized while she was walking around and squeezing through the crowd that there was an enormous planet before them, filling up half of their view. Its entire body was a dull black color, and there was a huge crack that ran from the left to the right of the entire sphere. There were some minor cracks as well that were spreading in every direction.</p><br/><p>A bunch of thin lines and strange characters floated around the planet.</p><br/><p>With a closer inspection, Yao Si realized that they were enclosed by a giant semi-spheric optical dome which loomed above them. The lines of characters she saw were explanations displayed on the see-through surface.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you putting it on?\u201d The doctor took the translation device from her hands and wound it around her ear. \u201cIf you don\u2019t wear it now, when the planet collapses later, you won\u2019t be able to differentiate which piece is which.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si heard a beep next to her ear, and the characters she wasn\u2019t able to understand previously were transformed before her eyes into the familiar Chinese. On the huge crevice of the planet floated these words \u201cThe Great Fission\u201d while around it were some statistics and data which she was unable to perceive.</p><br/><p>So this translation device not only allowed you to understand languages when held in hand, but it could also translate words when you wore it. No wonder it was a piece of future\u2019s high-tech.</p><br/><p>Unable to withhold her curiosity, Yao Si asked, \u201cWhat happened to this planet?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIts time is up,\u201d Dr. Wang replied carelessly. \u201cThis planet existed for billions of years and now it has reached its end, destruction is just a matter of time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><br/><p>The so-called termination of planets actually meant the destruction of planets, who would have thought\u2026 A moment earlier, she was still thinking about whether she\u2019ll boil or braise the duck blood, and now she was about to witness the perishing of a planet.</p><br/><p>Looking at everything before her, Yao Si was forced to accept the truth that she had really traveled to the future, a time N years later.</p><br/><p>The planet continued to break down, cracks covering its whole surface. The scene suddenly fell quiet, everyone attentively staring at the planet that was beginning to disperse.</p><br/><p>The black sphere was like a ripe dandelion, disintegrating into millions of fragments and scattering in every direction. The sunlight seeped through the cracks, splitting into thousand of rays of golden light, decadent yet beautiful.</p><br/><p>This show of the collapsing planet only lasted for half an hour. In that time, the originally pure-black planet had turned into a pile of dispersing debris.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s finished, come on.\u201d Dr. Wang patted Yao Si\u2019s shoulder.</p><br/><p>Yao Si was stupefied, recuperating from the shocking sight before her. She turned around, and as expected, the people that were on the platform had already left one after another.</p><br/><p>She nodded and was prepared to turn away, but she suddenly saw an intense white light streaking across from the right, heading straight towards the pile of broken rocks ahead. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSpace canon, it\u2019s for cleaning the galaxy.\u201d The girl cast an uncaring look at the white light and pointed to the series of rock piles in front of them. \u201cThese disintegrated miniature planets cannot stay here, it will affect our space station.\u201d</p><br/><p>As her voice fell silent, the white light had reached the debris, instantly forming a large whole with the bright light from before. The initially shattered rocks around it seemed to be experiencing some chain reaction and were all sucked into it, disappearing into nothingness. In less than a minute, one third of the rocks had already disappeared.</p><br/><p>Yao Si sighed with emotion. That big of a planet had disappeared without a sound, yet it seemed to her like there should have been something. This made her think of the eventuality of everything, and she began to miss her home dearly.</p><br/><p>\u201cHold on Dr. Wang, can I ask where did you find me?\u201d</p><br/><p>She had already woken up some time ago. Other than yesterday when she couldn\u2019t understand their language, the two days before that she had been in a muddle. Anyone who woke up after a sleep to find themselves in the future would probably also need some time to react. Until now, she didn\u2019t know how she had unknowingly moved from Earth to this high-tech space station. She could clearly recall that she was buried underground by the black-haired vampire.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure about this.\u201d The girl shook her head. \u201cAll I know is that the search team found you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh.\u201d It looked like she needed to ask the people who had rescued her. \u201cThen, do you know Earth? Is it far from here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEarth?\u201d The girl hesitated.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou mean the third planet of the solar system?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, yes! You know it?\u201d It was good news that the doctor had heard of it before. Maybe she could even go home, although she wondered if it was still the same as she remembered.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course I know, because\u2026\u201d \u2014the girl pointed behind them\u2014\u201dthe one that we just blew up was it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>What?</p>\n</div>"}

The entire time, the guards remained silent without even a single glance being exchanged. The silence and lack of interaction seemed odd, provoking a suspicion within Yao Si.</p><br/><p>The guards brought the four earthlings to a room that was slightly bigger than the one they were in before. It was filled with various equipment, and there were more passing guards as well as several people dressed in white.</p><br/><p>Yao Si\u2019s heart sank. She felt as though she had returned to the research base. Before her, there was the same unidentifiable equipment and the similar researchers dressed in white.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re finally back.\u201d The minute the earthlings entered, one of the men dressed in white who seemed to be the leader came forward to welcome them. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d The man took a closer look at the four earthlings, but instead of addressing them directly, he turned to the guards.</p><br/><p>The guards shook their heads.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnother failure?\u201d The man\u2019s face darkened, his lips quivering with unsaid words.</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you, you will never succeed.\u201d A mocking sneer came from behind, and a familiar figure dressed entirely in black walked forward.</p><br/><p>\u201cYuan Han!\u201d, \u201cThat b*tch!\u201d Yao Si and Bai Yi exclaimed in unison. F*ck, he really is here!</p><br/><p>\u201cSo this is where he has been hiding!\u201d Bai Yi fumed, preparing to rush over, but Yao Si reached out her hand to stop him.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait a minute! Let\u2019s watch.\u201d</p><br/><p>The man in white and Yuan Huan were obviously acquainted. He had have done something for the researcher to be kept save and free to roam around with the entire Galaxy seeking him as a wanted criminal. Who exactly was that man then?</p><br/><p>\u201cImpossible.\u201d The man in white switched on his optical computer to inspect the figures. As he looked at them, he said almost maniacally, \u201cI clearly duplicated your DNA, so how can they be unresponsive?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re comparing me to these puppets?\u201d Yuan Han seethed, glaring at him. \u201cI told you I\u2019m the last earthling. None of these puppets will react regardless of how many you try to clone them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Earthling!</p><br/><p>Yao Si\u2019s eyes went wide. Yuan Han was an earthling! She turned toward the two people at her side, and they too wore faces of shock.</p><br/><p>How could Yuan Huan exist? Weren\u2019t all earthlings extinct? Besides, based on the Galaxy\u2019s data, he belonged to another race?</p><br/><p>\u201cThe data may have been changed,\u201d Mu Xuan explained. Regarding Yuan Huan\u2019s earthling identity, he had his reservations. After all, he had experienced the doomsday period and was most acquainted with the situation.</p><br/><p>Yao Si was in a daze from the news while the two before them started a debate.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis cannot be, the data is identical, so the genes are the same. Why can\u2019t they be awakened?\u201d The man in white flipped through the documents in a frenzy, then shifted to face Yuan Han. \u201cNo, I want to try again.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yuan Han grew increasingly more infuriated. \u201cGet this straight, we already made things clear back then. You will provide me with a safe place while I provide you with my genes to allow you to create clones. Now that the clones are here, why should I do it all over again?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI must have missed something. It will definitely be a success this time.\u201d the man in white insisted anxiously.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou clearly know that there is something wrong with the cloning techniques.\u201d Yuan Han scoffed. \u201cCloning earthlings only creates shells without a mind of their own. They only awaken after conversion. Regardless of how many times you attempt it, the result will always stay the same.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t, they will definitely awaken. You just have to let me try once more. Weren\u2019t you awakened as well?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not your clone!\u201d Yuan Han bellowed, his eyes filling with fury from the insult. \u201cDon\u2019t lower me to their level! I will never offer up my genes again, give it up.\u201d</p><br/><p>Was this why he was here? Yao Si knew that earthlings cloned by bloodlings were just empty bodies, since it was common knowledge. It was only after conversion that the bodies started to possess some consciousness.</p><br/><p>The man in white hid just to give the clones consciousness? But why did he have to do it in secrecy? Wasn\u2019t it a good thing? If the clones gained consciousness, they would be earthlings.</p><br/><p>But where did Yuan Han get the virus?</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d The man in white seemed to have something to say, but then he stopped, clenching his teeth in anger. After a moment, he smiled coldly. \u201cDon\u2019t forget that you have nowhere else to hide.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re threatening me?\u201d Yuan Han glared at him, fury simmering within him.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou should understand the reason why the organization decided to save you,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you aren\u2019t cooperative\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Organization! A chill ran down Yao Si\u2019s spine. Did Euphoria really control this place?</p><br/><p>Even though the sentence hadn\u2019t been completed, its meaning was clear. Yuan Han burst out like an infuriated lion, grabbing the person in front of him. \u201cYou think you could stop me if I wanted to leave this place?\u201d</p><br/><p>He waved his hand, and the next moment, a familiar machine appeared behind him. It was clearly in better shape than before when its arm had broken off. Besides, it was different now, the originally black body was tainted by a faint red glow.</p><br/><p>This machine\u2026 had been upgraded again?</p><br/><p>It hadn\u2019t even been that long!</p><br/><p>\u201cYou-your machine!\u201d The man in white jumped back in fear, pushing the other aside. When he took a look at the machine, he seemed to realize something. \u201cYour machine has grown! This\u2026 This is impossible!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s impossible?\u201d Yuan Han smirked. \u201cMy lightning is a growing machine, every battle allows it to grow in strength.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHeh, do you really think your machine can take you out? We are bloodlings after all!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can try!\u201d The moment Yuan Han said this, the machine behind him waved its arm, and the red scythe appeared. The machine then directed the scythe in front of itself, radiating a threatening aura.</p><br/><p>The man in white stilled for a moment, then his eyes widened as he glanced between Yuan Han and the machine in disbelief. \u201cYou-you didn\u2019t even do anything, so how did it move. It\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right! It has a mind of its own.\u201d His laughter became arrogant, mocking the other man. \u201cYour clones are a bunch of puppets while I and my machine have a mind of our own.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA machine with a mind of its own\u2026\u201d The man in white suddenly became excited, his eyes gleaming at the machine before him. \u201cThat\u2019s great, that\u2019s great! You must stay, and the machine must stay too!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat depends on your ability!\u201d The machine directed a light at Yuan Han, transporting him inside its cockpit.</p><br/><p>The man in white immediately sounded the alarm, and numerous blooding guards came rushing in.</p><br/><p>Was this\u2026 an internal betrayal?</p><br/><p>Yao Si was still debating on whether to stop these people when Yuan Han suddenly pointed his scythe at the sky. A loud clap of thunder erupted, exploding a gigantic hole. He flew upwards.</p><br/><p>\u201cStop him!\u201d the man in white shouted.</p><br/><p>Around ten guards ran over at him while channeling their abilities. The scene turned into chaos, with various abilities flying at the machine in midair.</p><br/><p>\u201cMu Xuan!\u201d Yao Si turned to the person beside her, wondering if they should help. What if Yuan Han escaped? His confidence had to be backed by his knowledge about his machine.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s wait a little more!\u201d My Xuan replied, his tone much deeper than before, akin to a calm before a storm. Yao Si\u2019s heart sank.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happened? Why did you sound the alarm!\u201d a familiar voice asked, and a new person appeared on the scene.</p><br/><p>\u201cFourth Elder!\u201d Bai Yi exclaimed.</p><br/><p>The familiar voice indeed belonged to Fourth Elder!</p><br/><p>Why was he here?</p><br/><p>A shiver ran Yao Si\u2019s back as she connected the dots. Heavenly Bestowed Yard was under Fourth Elder\u2019s care, but she had originally assumed that he was not aware of Yuan Han\u2019s presence\u2026 Yet it showed up that he was even part of it!</p><br/><p>\u201cJi Yang, we can\u2019t allow anything here to be exposed, so why did you sound the alarm?\u201d Fourth Elder headed straight for the man in white.</p><br/><p>So\u2026 he was the reason Elder Council couldn\u2019t find anything?</p><br/><p>But\u2026 Why? Wasn\u2019t he an Elder?</p><br/><p>Yao Si didn\u2019t listen to their conversation in detail since her mind was a mess. Not long later, more people went after Yuan Han.</p><br/><p>The skies were filled with an array of abilities, but due to certain considerations, their attacks were restrained. Unlike them, Yuan Han went all out. His machine was indeed impressive, for in the face of so many attackers, he didn\u2019t seem to be on the losing end.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s time to end this.\u201d Mu Xuan sighed, taking a step forward.</p><br/><p>The next instance, a familiar force exploded from him, spreading across the entire Heavenly Bestowed yard. Yao Si\u2019s heart trembled, and her legs started to weaken. This was a force she had no power to fight against\u2014the bloodline suppression.</p><br/><p>The next instant, all the abilities stopped, and all bloodlings in the room, besides Yao Si and Bai Yi, fell to the ground as though a strong force had pushed them down. Mu Xuan\u2019s conscience was released at that moment as well</p><br/><p>\u201cYou-your highness!\u201d Fourth Elder fell on his knees from the pressure, his face full of shock as he looked at the three of them. He seemed to have figured something out. One side of his lips pulled up, and a bitter smile filled his face. \u201cYou\u2026 you found out after all.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mu Xuan frowned, keeping his silence.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s you guys!\u201d The only one that wasn\u2019t affected by the bloodline suppression was Yuan. Even though his expression couldn\u2019t be seen, his infuriated snarl showed that he had recognized Yao Si and Bai Yi. \u201cWhat great timing! You saved me the trouble of having hunting you down.\u201d</p><br/><p>He waved the red scythe in his hand. \u201cHeh, so what if your king is here, today I shall avenge my previous defeat. None of you will escape!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si was appalled. Was his ignorance that serious? He was the first person who dared to speak to Mu Xuan like that\u2026</p><br/><p>You should get yourself treated if you\u2019re mentally sick!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

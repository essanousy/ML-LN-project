How about this, I\u2019ll give you a discount and a free anti-fire talisman, will that do?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI really don\u2019t need it!\u201d Yao Si rejected once more.</p><br/><p>The elderly pouted, waving the thick stack of talismans in his hand, clearly displeased. He looked her up and down mockingly, then scoffed as a glint flashed past his eyes. He pointed at the booth with a sigh. \u201cWhatever! Go back and queue, that counter is going to open soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si didn\u2019t take offence. With a quick look, she realized that the clouds covering the closed booth were starting to dissipate. She hurriedly thanked him before going over to queue up.</p><br/><p>After the registration was done, a yellow talisman slipped out from the booth. It contained only a simple instruction for her to proceed to the dispatch area on the left.</p><br/><p>Yao Si headed over with the talisman that looked a transport ticket in her hands. She was totally clueless of the smug expression the elderly at the back was wearing now. <em>Heh, since you didn\u2019t buy my things, I\u2019ll make sure you end up crying.</em></p><br/><p>The dispatch area was just a spot with a drawing on the ground. Yao Si was intrigued as she walked onto it with the talisman in her hands. The moment she stood on the drawing, the talisman began to glow and disappeared.</p><br/><p>The next moment, the drawing lit up and she started to levitate. Just as she was impressed by the magical skills of the celestials, a white glow flashed in front of her, transporting her to an entirely different location.</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>Ten minutes later, there were people speaking in the VIP lounge.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy isn\u2019t Her Highness here yet?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe could have been slower than us!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut didn\u2019t the attendant mention that we\u2019re the first batch to reach the lounge.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBad news! The port just mentioned that the mystic beast in charge of welcoming the first batch of VIPs had been injured. Her Highness must have headed directly to the normal entrance and should already be on the training planet!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHurry, we need to reach her immediately!\u201d</p><br/><p>After two minutes, the crowd that reached the training planet\u2026</p><br/><p>Didn\u2019t they mention that others had arrived? Where are they!</p><br/><p>(\u256f\u2035\u25a1\u2032)\u256f\ufe35\u253b\u2501\u253b</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2026 might not be able to make it back to the Red Planet!\u201d <em>We\u2019re going to get beaten to death!</em></p><br/><p>The three of them shivered uncontrollably as they gripped onto each other!</p><br/><p>At this moment, Yao Si\u2026</p><br/><p><em>Is it dark already?</em></p><br/><p>Yao Si scanned her surroundings. Everything was pitch black, without a single glow of light anywhere. She could vaguely sense how deserted the place was as the wind howled all around.</p><br/><p>Even though the wind wasn\u2019t fast, it seemed to smash against her continuously, forcing her forward. There was barely anything around, only the ground covered with sand. If she opened her mouth, she would definitely taste little bits of it picked by the wind. The entire place was unusually calm, almost suspiciously so. There didn\u2019t seem to be any presence in this place.</p><br/><p>Advertisements indeed couldn\u2019t be trusted. Weren\u2019t they boasting moments ago about how every corner of the celestial region was as scenic as a painting? Besides, there wasn\u2019t a single attendant around here to welcome her\u2026 <em>Or has the training already began?</em></p><br/><p>Yao Si searched for a flat ground before settling down. It was supposed to be training, but all she was doing was moving about without a clue about what she was doing. The information on the Galactic web was limited. There hadn\u2019t been any mention of the training details, hence she could only figure it out on her own.</p><br/><p>Before she came over, she had consulted Mu Xuan regarding the various aspects of mental strength. Based on his words, it was basically a person\u2019s awareness, while attacking with mental strength was just emitting that awareness externally.</p><br/><p>Mu Xuan mentioned that awareness could only be nurtured with time. After being in hibernation for such a long time, her awareness was naturally much stronger than that of others. However, due to her lack of experience, she could only perform the most elementary skill \u2013 entering the Galactic web with her awareness.</p><br/><p>The celestial region could help with one\u2019s mental strength, since it was entirely different from the Galactic. She shut her eyes to sense any differences.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, an infuriated shout broke her thoughts.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs long as I, Zan Zichen, am still alive, I\u2019ll never succumb to you demonic races!\u201d</p>\n</div>"}

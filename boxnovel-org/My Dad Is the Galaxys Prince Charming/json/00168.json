Lin Long dashed toward Mu Xuan without any regard, unleashing his attack. A white glow filled their vision, sending tremors through the entire space.</p><br/><p>Yao Si had assumed before that Lin Long was a first generation bloodling, but now that she had learned that he was an ancestor, she started to worry for Mu Xuan. Moreover, Lin Long was mad from fury. If he wasn\u2019t careful\u2026</p><br/><p>Thump!</p><br/><p>Suddenly, with a kick from Mu Xuan, a certain someone went flying like a shooting star\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si swallowed her words silently.</p><br/><p><em>Alright! As proven, dad will always be dad. </em></p><br/><p>\u256e(\u256f\u25bd\u2570)\u256d</p><br/><p>How did it look like Mu Xuan was losing? He definitely had the upper hand, taking full control in less than five minutes. Rather than calling it a match between two equally matched ancestors, she should call it a beating from Mu Xuan.</p><br/><p><em>Too\u2026 brutal! </em> Yao Si shielded her eyes silently, having an urge to lit Lin Long a candle.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s impossible, how can I lose to you?! F*ck! Are you a f*cking pervert? How can you have such a strong force?</p><br/><p>\u201cAw\u2026 F**k, f*ck, f*ck! Are you bullying a single dog now? Are you looking down on me? Wait a minute! Not the face\u2026 Aw! F*ck\u2026 I won\u2019t forgive you heterosexual couple!</p><br/><p>\u201cAwwwww\u2026 It hurts, hurts, hurts\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The air was filled with a certain someone\u2019s anger-filled grievances, a hint of helplessness and ugly sobbing.</p><br/><p>-_-|||</p><br/><p>Ten minutes later\u2026</p><br/><p>They finally came to a stop, each of them taking up a side. It was as though an entire universe separated them.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou-you guys!\u201d Lin Long panted, trembling uncontrollably. He seemed to be in a confusion from pain and anger, even his intense healing powers unable to save his badly bruised face. He glared at Mu Xuan in fury before turning his death stare over to Yao Si. \u201cI\u2019m going to blame it on my bloody luck!\u201d</p><br/><p>In a flash, he disappeared.</p><br/><p>Mu Xuan didn\u2019t persist with a chase. Instead, he appeared in front of Yao Si with anger still tainting his features. He reached out, pulling her into his embrace before heaving a sigh of relief, caressing her head in comfort. \u201cGood girl, everything is alright.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d But there wasn\u2019t anything wrong\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go home.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t chasing after him?\u201d Yao Si asked. It was totally unlike Mu Xuan\u2019s style.</p><br/><p>His face sank. He seemed to have sensed something as he spoke resolutely. \u201cHe isn\u2019t the same as us, I\u2026 can\u2019t kill him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Without explaining, he opened a space portal back to the Red Planet.</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>Once they reached home, Yao Si reported her suspicions and everything that had happened. Even though Lin Long had done a lot, he didn\u2019t seem to be doing anything against the bloodlings or anything bad at all.</p><br/><p>She talked most about his identity\u2026</p><br/><p>In the beginning, he had mentioned that the bloodlings originated from \u2018the old man\u2019 and he seemed to have converted a whole lot of earthlings. He also mentioned that he was the only ancestor left in the Galaxy.</p><br/><p>He had later mentioned about his race, if it could be called a race. There had to be more than two people for that, and he was definitely not referring to the bloodlings that existed today. Where were the others then?</p><br/><p>Next was his attitude toward Mu Xuan. Initially, he had treated the bloodlings with disdain and repulsion, adamant that they were created by his ancestor friend, so he had even refused to acknowledge their identity. But he remained insistent on Mu Xuan\u2019s pure breed status! Even though Mu Xuan had awaken the ancestral bloodline, he was originally an earthling as well.</p><br/><p>Lin Long had also used the term \u2018this world\u2019. Initially Yao Si had assumed that it was another name for the Galaxy, but from the conversations, it didn\u2019t seem as such. He seemed to have completely removed himself from the scope, but if he didn\u2019t belong to this world\u2026 where was he from?</p><br/><p>If everything was true, a bold suspicion started to form within Yao Si. If it could be confirmed, perhaps Lin Long\u2019s real motives could be figured out.</p><br/><p>\u201cHis bloodline is a little odd.\u201d Mu Xuan seemed to have thought of something. \u201cI can\u2019t feel any connection with him.\u201d That was the reason he couldn\u2019t kill him. Even though Lin Long had been attacked by another bloodling, he was still able to self-heal. \u201cMaybe his ancestor claim is true.\u201d</p><br/><p>The corners of Yao Si\u2019s lips twitched as she was reminded of the two ancestors\u2019 ridiculous names.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid he\u2019s the only one with the answers.\u201d Mu Xuan frowned. \u201cIt won\u2019t be easy for us to investigate by ourselves.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t we\u2026 ask him,\u201d Yao Si suggested.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Mu Xuan.</p><br/><p>Yao Si\u2019s assumption was simple. Even though Lin Long was mysterious, wasn\u2019t there a portal to his nest in the heart of the Red Planet? The other bloodlings weren\u2019t able to enter, but that didn\u2019t mean that Mu Xuan would be held outside as well. Besides, three days had passed since they had fought, the king beasts was killed, and blue planet was destroyed. Regardless of how angry he was, he should have calmed down\u2026 Probably?</p><br/><p>As for that incident, even though it was Mu Xuan who had killed the king beast and coincidentally slashed the blue planet apart, Yao Si couldn\u2019t help the guilt that rose within her.</p><br/><p>Previously, once they met with a disagreement, they would fight to their deaths. But as a weakling with level zero ability, there was no way Yao Si could stop anyone.</p><br/><p>Initially, Mu Xuan was against the idea of walking into the lion\u2019s den, but after she assured him continuously that nothing bad was going to happen and mentioned her special identity as a contractor, he garnered up an incredulous amount of tolerance before agreeing to give it a shot.</p><br/><p>As expected, the blood fog that kept everyone away had no effect on Mu Xuan. They managed to enter successfully, and in a short while, they arrived at the house she had stayed in for about three days.</p><br/><p>Yao Si had thought that they would need some time to find Lin Long, but he had no intention of hiding. The instant they arrived and lifted their heads, the sight of him splayed on a couch like a dead fish came into full view.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you guys what?\u201d He glanced at them, his body lifeless on the couch, showing no intention of being about to stand up. \u201cWhat is it? Is beating me once not satisfying enough, or you want to be an eyesore?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Mu Xuan who had been in high alert and prepared to attack at any moment.</p><br/><p>The ancestor wasn\u2019t what they had expected.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you here to laugh at me?\u201d Lin Long asked then. \u201cAre you happy now that I can\u2019t go back?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGo back?\u201d Yao Si exclaimed. \u201cWhere do you want to go?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you know?!\u201d Lin Long bolted upright while looking at them. \u201cThen why the f*ck would you kill my king beast?\u201d</p><br/><p><em>Er\u2026</em></p><br/><p>\u201cYou kidnapped my young cub,\u201d Mu Xuan replied coldly.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you f*cking think I liked keeping your contractor!\u201d Lin Long exploded and pointed at Yao Si before starting on a series of complaints. \u201cShe\u2019s arrogant, a picky eater, and f*cking made me download Danmei novels for her every single day while forcing me to evaluate which one is better. I\u2019m a perfectly straight guy, so how would I know? Take her away! I never want to see her again!\u201d</p><br/><p><em>Er\u2026 </em></p></div>\n</div>"}

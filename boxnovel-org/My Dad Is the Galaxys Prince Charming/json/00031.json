With a hint of pride and another indescribable emotion, the crowd followed him into the Majestic Palace.</p><br/><p>Yao Si deliberately slowed down, tugging at Yao Qian. \u201cErr\u2026 Were my eyes playing tricks on me? Did Mu Xuan really split the planet in half?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe did,\u201d Yao Qian replied nonchalantly. After a moment, he added, \u201cBut the Thunder Sylvani clan has always had a vigorous vitality, even if their planet was split in half, the root system would still be alive.\u201d</p><br/><p>But she wasn\u2019t asking about that\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cMu Xuan\u2026 is he really a fourth generation bloodling?!\u201d With just a casual strike, he was able to split a planet into two, something even first and second generation bloodlings weren\u2019t able to do. Back then, a young second generation bloodling could only cause a minor crack at best.</p><br/><p>\u201cYea.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Were all the fourth generation bloodlings this amazing? She really needed to learn all the common knowledge of bloodlings.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut\u2026\u201d Yao Qian seemed to have recalled something. \u201cHis Majesty is a little special.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSpecial?\u201d <em>In what way?</em></p><br/><p>\u201cHis Majesty is the only one in our clan that managed to awaken the ancestral bloodline, so technically he isn\u2019t considered to be the fourth generation.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAncestral bloodline?!\u201d <em>What\u2019s that? </em>\u201cThen is he\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe first generation!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Did she unknowingly ask the most clueless person..?</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u201cCome here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mu Xuan led the crowd into the house with no intentions of making them feel welcome. He just waved towards Yao Si, signaling her in. When he saw her seated by the table, he brought a bowl of noodles over. \u201cEat while it\u2019s hot.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Yao Si reached for the bowl, but she couldn\u2019t eat like this\u2026</p><br/><p>In front of her was a group of people standing in an orderly fashion, facing in the direction of Mu Xuan. The one at the very front was the ruler of the Thunder Sylvani.</p><br/><p>Honestly, his human form was quite dashing. He had a head full of long green hair, which seemed as soft as a green grass, while his face was young and clean, just like that of a pretty boy from a cartoon strip. His appearance was nourishing to the eye.</p><br/><p>==!!</p><br/><p>Mu Xuan seemed to have forgotten about their existence, not giving them even a glance. Because of this, no one dared to speak, standing with their backs as straight as a rod and their heads lowered as though they had done something wrong and were awaiting punishment. For a moment, Yao Si felt as though she had accidentally entered the discipline master\u2019s office.</p><br/><p>\u201cErm\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Mu Xuan caressed her hair, reminding her, \u201cHurry and drink it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si felt embarrassed, yet if she didn\u2019t finish the soup, she was sure that Mu Xuan would continue to disregard everyone else, hence she lowered her head to down the bowl. During it, no one said a word, and the sound of her drinking echoed in the silent room.</p><br/><p>Gulp\u2026 Gulp\u2026 Gulp\u2026</p><br/><p>The whole thing was exceptionally embarrassing.</p><br/><p><em>Is it necessary for there to be such a big audience when I\u2019m just drinking soup?</em></p><br/><p>(\u256f\ufe4f\u2570\uff09</p><br/><p>Yao Si finished the bowl in just three gulps and placed it back down. Before waiting for Mu Xuan to ask, she said, \u201cI\u2019m full.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mu Xuan took a glance at her. Satisfied, he reached for the table, and the next moment the meal\u2026 No, the bowl and utensils disappeared. He seemed to think for a moment, and then the out of place vintage furniture transformed into the galactic state of the art equipment, and even the stool Yao Si had been sitting on became a velvety and lush crystal chair.</p><br/><p>Mu Xuan turned to look at the group that was standing around. He frowned deeply and spat out, \u201cSolve it yourself.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, without offering them another glance, he opened his optical computer and sent Yao Si a few documents regarding the history of bloodlings. It was as though he had returned back to the parenting mode.</p><br/><p>Yao Si stilled, glancing at the man in front of her. Was he not willing to solve his own problems yet found it too noisy and so offered them a space to talk things out instead of fighting?</p><br/><p>Uh\u2026 Alright, it\u2019s fatherly indeed!</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Majesty, Mu\u2026 Mu Xuan?\u201d Thunder Sylvani ruler was trembling, but when he saw Mu Xuan\u2019s disinterest, he sighed in relief. He\u2019d better face anyone than Mu Xuan\u2019s silent pressure. Thinking this, he turned sideways and looked towards the other elders, then took a deep breath and started to explain himself.</p><br/><p>\u201cActually\u2026 I didn\u2019t intend to start a war with the bloodlings.\u201d If he\u2019d known that the ruler of the bloodlings had awakened, no amount of courage would have brought him back to the Red Planet. \u201cI only came with my clan because one of yours stole my \u2018Royal Seed\u2019. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRubbish!\u201d the second elder snapped. \u201cWhat \u2018Royal Seed\u2019, who doesn\u2019t know that my clan has no interest in other kinds of food, why would we steal your Seed?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow would I know?\u201d the ruler of Thunder Sylvani snapped back. \u201cI personally saw the bloodling Qu Ze bringing it out. After chasing him through four galaxies, I landed here. Just a moment ago, I sensed that the \u2018Royal Seed\u2019 was seriously damaged.\u201d</p><br/><p>Visibly agitated, he added, \u201cEveryone in the galaxy knows that my clan is born from the royal tree and each of us only have one descendant, \u2018Royal Seed\u2019.\u201d Thunder Sylvani ruler tone deepened, tears streaming down his face uncontrollably. His face darkened, looking grieved and upset. \u201cYour clan ruined my only \u2018Royal Seed\u2019, isn\u2019t that equivalent to ruining my entire clan?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cQu Ze\u2026\u201d The elders froze, glancing at each other nervously. If it was anyone else, they could stand firm, but if it was him, the possibility of him being a thief was quite high.</p><br/><p>\u201cI know that the bloodlings are strong and I don\u2019t intend to push the blame.\u201d Thunder Sylvani ruler choked on his last words as he wiped his tears. \u201cNow, I beg your clan to return my \u2018Royal Seed\u2019. Even if the shell is damaged, I won\u2019t blame anyone and I\u2019ll leave immediately. I\u2019ll even be willing to repay ten times the worth of damage caused to the Red Planet.\u201d</p><br/><p><em>Shell is damaged? </em>Yao Si\u2019s heart sank, and she reached for the broken purple little ball. \u201cAre you\u2026 referring to this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Thunder Sylvani ruler turned. His eyes went wide, and his miserable shriek pierced the air. \u201cMy son!\u201d</p><br/><p>He pounced over to snatch the ball in her hands, totally disregarding Mu Xuan\u2019s presence. He held the ball in his palms, staring at it as though witnessing a tragedy, tears pouring out of his eyes. \u201cMy son\u2026 My son\u2026 How did you get so hurt?\u201d Abruptly, he lifted his head to glare at Yao Si. \u201cIt\u2019s you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si jumped, startled by his murderous gaze. Subconsciously, she stumbled backwards, and the next moment she felt something touch her hand. Mu Xuan pulled her behind himself before turning to look at Thunder Sylvani ruler. \u201cMy cub\u2026 what\u2019s wrong?\u201d He spoke slowly, his tone so cold it seemed to drip icicles, freezing the air around him.</p><br/><p>The entire room fell silent.</p><br/><p>Thunder Sylvani ruler trembled, his legs softening. He almost fell to the ground, forgetting the tears he was shedding. The ruler of the bloodlings had a child, how could he have not known about it!</p><br/><p>\u201cEr\u2026 I just received that Seed,\u201d Yao Si clarified. \u201cI didn\u2019t harm it. It just cracked randomly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s impossible.\u201d Thunder Sylvani ruler shook his head, his rebuttal as soft as that of a mouse. \u201d Not even a person with 3S ability can harm the shell of the Royal Seed, how could it\u2026 crack by itself?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure exactly.\u201d Yao Si frowned. \u201cIt was given to me by Qu Ze. Initially I wasn\u2019t aware that it was your Royal Seed, so you\u2019ll have to ask him for the specifics.\u201d</p><br/><p><em>Urgh, all in all, this was an incident caused by some crazy dude. </em>Yao Si hadn\u2019t expected that Qu Ze would harm her like that.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy\u2026 My poor son.\u201d Thunder Sylvani ruler hugged the Seed, bursting into tears once more. His dashing superior aura was already gone, and his entire soul was on the verge of a breakdown.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s the Great Elder?\u201d Second Elder turned away, no longer able to watch the scene.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe left the Red Planet early this morning.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s less than half a day ago, I\u2019m sure he hasn\u2019t yet left the R galactic radius, inform the customs to send the ship back.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Third elder opened his optical computer to investigate. The next moment, his face paled. \u201cThe ship escorting the Great Elder has already left our galaxy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat! Confirm his location and chase him back.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe ship disappeared once it left the galaxy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Second Elder felt a coming headache, yet he couldn\u2019t determine whether it was because of anger or because of the endless sobbing of Thunder Sylvani ruler. He took a deep breath before saying gravely, \u201cThunder Sylvani ruler, if it\u2019s true, then our clan will take full responsibility. We\u2019ll get in contact with the Great Elder to investigate this issue.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Before Thunder Sylvani ruler could even reply, Mu Xuan interrupted, glancing lightly at the crowd. \u201cIt\u2019s too troublesome!\u201d</p><br/><p>With a wave of his hand, the air seemed to converge, turning into a vortex, and a black hole appeared out of a sudden. Within it, a figure soon took shape.</p><br/><p>\u201cSpace summoning!\u201d the Second Elder shouted out, his eyes wide in awe.</p><br/><p>Mu Xuan lowered his hand, and the figure fell out from the black hole.</p><br/><p>\u201cAah!\u201d it shrieked painfully, and a certain culprit that was said to have disappeared a few million light years away landed on the floor.</p><br/><p>The crowd stared in silence.</p><br/><p>\u201cFather?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMmh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCould you teach me that move?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p>\n</div>"}

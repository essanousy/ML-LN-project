She went from in the beginning only being active near the village to now exploring the entire forest inside out. However, the number of rabbits grew smaller and smaller, they went from visible near the outskirts of the village to now being absent even in the depths of the forest. It would be rare for her to find one or two.</p><br/><p>She thought that it must be the fault of the game designer. As the beginner creature of the newbie village, shouldn\u2019t it respawn <sup>1</sup> in seconds? She had already went into the forest to hunt rabbits, but the rabbits near the village still hadn\u2019t respawned; this speed was way too slow.</p><br/><p>Yao Si thought about how she would provide feedback on this issue to the customer services when she exited the game while placing the five thousandth rabbit into the backpack. As she prepared to return to the village, she suddenly heard a \u201cting\u201d noise from the sky and a solemn voice boomed through every single corner of the world.</p><br/><p>[Ting! The Celestial Realm\u2019s Swordwielding Bulletin: The human life contains genuine feeling, the human life has true loves. The cultivator \u201c*#38\u201d has extended her helpful hands and successfully managed the rabbit plague issue that had been bothering the Village of Mystic Rabbits for thousands of years. The villagers will no longer be tormented by this rabbit plague. To honor this cultivator\u2019s selfless actions, the celestial realm decided to grant this cultivator the title of the \u201cHealing and Helpful Force\u201d, and aggravation point will remain -10% forever as a reward! From now on the Village of Mystic Hares will be renamed \u201c*#\u201d Village.]</p><br/><p>Yao Si had a fright from the voice that rang out of nowhere, but then she reasoned that this must be something normal. This was probably the game\u2019s public announcement, or probably a local tycoon who had spent money and bought a speaker or something like that. She quickly poised herself and continued on her way back to the village to finish the mission.</p><br/><p>She had no clue that the world channel had exploded.</p><br/><p>[World (Green Dress in the Misty Rain): Even the newbie village had such an unbelievable hidden accomplishment, how come I didn\u2019t know? ]</p><br/><p>[World (The Last Zerg): Didn\u2019t know either, feels like I missed out on a hundred million galactic currency! ]</p><br/><p>[World (Galactic Conqueror): The main point is that reward, aggro <sup>2</sup> -10% forever. Every time from now on that she kills she will only get 1% of aggro. With her properties, even if she got pissed and slaughtered the entire city, she would probably not experience the Divine Wrath? ]</p><br/><p>[World (Umekawa Kulei): Upstairs, your focus point is wrong. According to the reverse overlay of the system\u2019s own property effects, if anyone dares to blindly touch her in the wild, their aggro will immediately go to 11%. I feel like the Divine Wrath can chop you right back to the revival point. ]</p><br/><p>[World (Galactic Conqueror): Oh shit!]</p><br/><p>[World (Brainless Fangirl of Prince Charming Mu): Oh shit! +1]</p><br/><p>[World (Red Red Red Red Red): Oh shit! +2]</p><br/><p>[World (Forever Dandy): Am I the only one who\u2019s curious why that ID is in gibberish? What about the special characters being forbidden? I feel very pissed about someone being cooler than me.]</p><br/><p>[World (Pour-pour): The system\u2019s biological child, authentication complete!]</p><br/><p>Yao Si didn\u2019t know how to open the world channel, and even if it was opened, she still wouldn\u2019t understand what was being said. So she was completely unaware that she had any extraordinary properties. Instead she was orderly placing the hundred rabbits which she had finally collected at the butcher stall owner\u2019s stall front.</p><br/><p><em>What will the reward be this time? </em></p><br/><p>?\uff08????\uff09?</p><br/><p>Qin who had already broken the bank didn\u2019t have anything to say.</p><br/><p>\u25cb|\uffe3|__</p><br/><p>Yao Si realized that compared to the decisiveness of previous missions, this time the owner dawdled for a long time. His facial expression was also particularly strange, transitioning from green to red to black and eventually fading to white. Finally, with a look of his own flesh being cut, he took out a small booklet with a trembling hand and passed it to her.</p><br/><p>Yao Si extended her hand to receive it, but strangely the owner latched onto the booklet with all his might. She pulled at it for a long time but still had no success.</p><br/><p>Was it because the mission objective number was short?</p><br/><p>She took another two hundred rabbits out of her bag straight away.</p><br/><p><em>Don\u2019t know about others, but I have plenty of rabbits! </em> \u256e(\u256f_\u2570)\u256d</p><br/><p>The owner\u2019s hands quivered, the booklet in his hands fell to the ground with a thud.</p><br/><p>Luckily, she still had some stock!</p><br/><p>Yao Si picked up the booklet from the ground, patted the dust away, and headed out the village again. On her way, she turned to look at the rabbits piled into a tall mountain in the village square. With a sigh, she wondered when these creatures would respawn.</p><br/><p>Looking down at the booklet in her hands, Yao Si speculated that this must be a beginner\u2019s skill book or something like that. She opened it up, and as expected, she couldn\u2019t understand a single word, so she didn\u2019t dwell on it and threw it straight inside the backpack.</p><br/><p>Naturally, she didn\u2019t notice that the system\u2019s public announcement had rang again in the sky.</p><br/><p>[Ting! The Celestial Realm\u2019s Swordwielding Bulletin: cultivator \u201c*#38\u201d of an unknown map has an enormous celestial virtue, thus it is no coincidence she received a copy of \u201cThe Celestial Training Scroll\u201d. The path of higher achievement has been outlined, ascendance to an immortal will happen in no time!]</p><br/><p>As soon as this announcement was released, it ignited the world channel again.</p><br/><p>[Wold (The Grassland): Holy shit! What did I just see? The Heavenly and Earthly training scrolls from each level\u2026 Even the top ranked god of the entire server has only obtained the earthly training scrolls! What in the world is the celestial training scroll?]</p><br/><p>[World (The Girl-picking Mushroom): Who is this \u201cmessy code 38\u201d? Could it be an internal worker of the game!]</p><br/><p>[World (Otherworldly Beauty): Just received an accomplishment and now a \u201cCelestial Training Scroll\u201d. There\u2019s definitely something fishy behind it!]</p><br/><p>[World (Umekawa Kulei): Does anyone know this scrambled code? Can you let me ride on her coattails, even a walkthrough <sup>3</sup> would be enough!)</p><br/><p>[World (Baby of the Mu Family): PM her already, the other end turned off communication.]</p><br/><p>[World (Umekawa Kulei): Is anyone in the newbie village, see if the \u201cscrambled code 38\u201d is still there or not?]</p><br/><p>[World (Seed Seed Seed Seed Seed): Been leveling up too quickly, let the newbie village within ten minutes after entering the server.]</p><br/><p>[World (Bean Bean Bean Bean Bean): Left there in eight minutes!]</p><br/><p>[World (I Have Already Gotten The Fruits): Five minutes!]</p><br/><p>[World (Little 8): Three minutes!]</p><br/><p>[World (Celestial Realm Conqueror): The server has been open for so many days, how could there still be any noobs, that messy code probably already left long ago.]</p><br/><p>[World (Umekawa Kulei): \u2026]</p><br/><p>While the world actively discussed the possible plans of riding coattails, the NPCs in the newbie village were also discussing the matter of life and death of the newbie village.</p><br/><p>\u201cVillage chief, she has already killed all the rabbits in the entire village. Our village was indeed plagued by them, but if she doesn\u2019t leave now, all the rabbits will probably go extinct.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you give the talismans for leveling-up?\u201d People of Level 10 of Qi Refining could be teleported right out of the newbie village.</p><br/><p>\u201cI did, but she didn\u2019t use them!\u201d Qin was about to cry. \u201cI really didn\u2019t know what to do, I don\u2019t have any other rewards from my shabby little stall. I almost took off the roof beam to give it to her.\u201d However, due to game rules, he had to give even something precious. \u201cI even gave her the Celestial Training Scroll. If this continues, I will have no choice but to give her relics.\u201d</p><br/><p>The old village chief who had a white beard realized the seriousness of the situation. Moving his head and looking at the mountain-like pile of rabbits in the village, he felt distressed. \u201cIsn\u2019t there any other way to make her leave here?\u201d Go torture some other city\u2019s NPCs.</p><br/><p>\u201cChief, I have an idea,\u201d Aunt Li from the tailor stall suggested. \u201cIf she doesn\u2019t leave herself, why don\u2019t we kick her out.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou mean\u2026 summoning the demonic beast.\u201d As a high intelligence NPC, the village chief immediately understood what she meant. He pondered it over then shook his head. \u201cNo no, we have boundaries in our village, demonic beasts above the level of Qi Refining cannot enter, let along be summoned.\u201d (Newbie protection zone)</p><br/><p>\u201cSummoning a level 10 Qi Refining demonic beast is better than nothing,\u201d Aunt Li continued to suggest. \u201cSince she hasn\u2019t even reached Qi Refining, she\u2019s just a beginner with her basic physical qualities. Unless her physical conditions are better than those of normal people, level 10 of Qi Refining will suffice.\u201d</p><br/><p>The village chief took a look at Qin who appeared to have nothing to live for, then at the other villagers who were without any ideas, and ground his teeth. \u201cOkay! Let\u2019s try it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Therefore, Yao Si who had long been looking for rabbits had a white light flash before her eyes.</p><br/><p>Dong!</p><br/><p>A 55 inch wide super bunny appeared before her, it\u2019s roar making the surrounding plants shake.</p><br/><p>\u201cHa, you cruel-natured villain. How dare you do such a thing to the descendants of the rabbit race, I will avenge all my rabbit children and grandchildren today!\u201d it said, then raised a huge carrot in its hands and smashed it.</p><br/><p>Yao Si who understood nothing had a gleam in her eyes.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s the boss!</p><br/><p>(\u2299 o \u2299)</p><br/><p>So\u2026</p><br/><p>Half an hour later, she dragged a mutant bunny back.</p><br/><p>Qin \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Village chief \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Aunt Li \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Fellow villagers \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>System \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>[Ting! Player \u201c*#38\u201d has outstanding talents and extraordinary perception. She is hereby gifted a relic: Celestial Robe with Phoenix Feather Decorations. The road of cultivation is a long road, but those who travel its length shall ascend.]</p><br/><p>Fellow villagers were thinking only one thing. <em>Take it, take it, take it all, was that not enough? </em></p><br/><p>(?_?)</p><br/><p>From then on, Yao Si\u2019s mission content had progressed from killing rabbits to killing a rabbit boss.</p>\n</div>"}

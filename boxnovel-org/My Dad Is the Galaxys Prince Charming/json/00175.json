Even though they had taken twenty days to reach the first checkpoint, the next eight were all completed in less than a day.</p><br/><p>[Total number of checkpoints completed: Nine!]</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Highness, we are left with one more.\u201d Bai Yi broke into a radiant smile and waved his optical computer excitedly before turning toward Lin Long. \u201cThanks so much bro, this is the first time I have completed nine checkpoints.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho\u2019s your bro?\u201d Lin Long took a step back in disgust before scoffing. \u201cHeh, isn\u2019t it just opening up several space portals? Is there a need to be so happy? I\u2019m not trying to brag, but this is just transporting people within a planet. I could even open up portals to send myself to any planet I desire. So why would I care about the gratitude of bastards like you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p><em>Isn\u2019t your smile a little too bright for someone who doesn\u2019t care? </em> Even though his words were relentless, his body sure was honest.</p><br/><p>\u256e(\u256f\u25bd\u2570)\u256d</p><br/><p>Throughout their journey, Bai Yi and Li Zheng couldn\u2019t understand what Lin Long meant by bastards but they seemed to have grown accustomed to his haughty ways and obvious disdain, and weren\u2019t the least bit offended. They laughed loudly. \u201cThere\u2019s just one last checkpoint, bro\u2026 That boss, we\u2019ll leave it all to you! Whether I\u2019ll be able to get a cub or not is all in your hands now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho\u2019s cub?\u201d Lin Long stilled.</p><br/><p>Just as he was about to ask, Yao Si yanked him aside, taking him away from the explanation. \u201cNothing, it\u2019s nothing! Lin Long, let\u2019s hurry to the last stop?\u201d</p><br/><p><em>Are you seeking death? How could you talk about cubs in front of a single dog for a million years? Isn\u2019t that just rubbing salt on his wound? </em> If he knew the coming of age test was actually a requirement for obtaining a cub, the legendary certificate to quit the singles club, there was a possibility he would turn hostile and fall out with them. <em>Do you no longer want your expert? </em></p><br/><p>Yao Si hurriedly opened the map, pointing toward a random checkpoint in an effort to divert the topic. \u201cThis! Let\u2019s head over here next. Once we sign into the last checkpoint, our mission will be complete, and you will be free to continue with your reconstruction.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Lin Long shot her a suspicious gaze, but he didn\u2019t pursue the cub topic anymore. He glanced down at the map to confirm the location. \u201cAre you sure this is the last checkpoint? There won\u2019t be anything else afterwards?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, it\u2019s definitely the last point. Do you\u2026 you have any problems with it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou must be joking!\u201d He smirked. \u201cWhat problems could I have? Isn\u2019t it just opening a transportation portal? That wouldn\u2019t be able to able to trouble me at all, and we\u2019ll settle with this point\u2026\u201d With another wave, a ray of light shone, and a tiny opening appeared. But just as it was about to widen, it suddenly closed shut, disappearing. \u201cF*ck! We really can\u2019t enter.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow can that be!\u201d Lin Long frowned and raised his hand to try again. Just like before, the space portal disappeared before it could fully form.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Yao Si asked.</p><br/><p>Lin Long frowned, his brows forming a tight knot. \u201cThere seems to be a force inhibiting the space ability, so there isn\u2019t a way to open a space portal directly.\u201d He waved open another portal to the side, and this time, it appeared successfully. \u201cI opened a portal in the nearest possible location. I\u2019m curious to find out what exactly do they have there.\u201d</p><br/><p>With a step forward, he took the lead.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh? Wait a minute!\u201d Yao Si\u2019s heart clenched. She wanted to stop him, but it was too late. They could have just headed for another checkpoint if there was something wrong with that one. Why was there a need to travel all the way to that one?</p><br/><p>She glanced back at Bai Yi and Li Zheng before sighing. They could only follow along with their teeth clenched. The moment they entered the portal, hey were transported from a dense forest to a huge deserted land.</p><br/><p>The horizon was extremely vast, but there wasn\u2019t anything other than an endless stretch of deserted land.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe checkpoint is still nine hundred kilometers away.\u201d Bai Yi pointed ahead after glancing at the map.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you waiting for, let\u2019s go!\u201d Lin Long turned to head forward, determined to find out what was ahead of them.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait a minute.\u201d Yao Si acted swiftly this time and grabbed hold of him. She pulled out the flying devices she had picked up when Lin Long had appeared from the space portal. \u201cThese flying devices still have some power, so we should use them.\u201d There was still 900 km to go, so was he really planning on walking all that way?</p><br/><p>Lin Long glanced at the damaged flying devices scornfully. \u201cHeh, only you bastards would use such outdated devices that travel at a few thousand meters per second.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d F*ck, don\u2019t take it if you don\u2019t like it!</p><br/><p>Yao Si told Bai Yi and Li Zheng to board the flying devices, and they started toward the checkpoint. They passed through the deserted surroundings where even the horizon couldn\u2019t be seen.</p><br/><p>The flying devices moved quickly, and in less than five minutes, they are arrived at their destination.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou guys better be careful, since there should be something with at least a level S ability for it to block my space portal. No, it should be even higher than that!\u201d Lin Long declared firmly.</p><br/><p>The three of them inhaled sharply, their hearts fluttering as they grew extra cautious toward the location\u2026</p><br/><p>But there was nothing!</p><br/><p>-_-|||</p><br/><p>The deserted land only gave way to another stretch of nothing with only a lonely checkpoint floating in the middle.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Yao Si.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Bai Yi.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Lin Long.</p><br/><p>Yao Si could vaguely hear someone\u2019s heart tumbling to the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis-this can\u2019t be!\u201d Ergou was full of disbelief. \u201cThat protective barrier must have hidden itself.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSure, sure, sure, take your time and find it while I\u2019ll get the last checkpoint signed,\u201d Yao Si told him on her way toward the checkpoint . After two steps, she lifted her head, but Bai Yi and the other two were still in front of her. \u201cEh, you guys came here so quickly?\u201d she murmured unconsciously, without much thought. Since Bai Yi had been single for such a long time, his anxiety was understandable.</p><br/><p>The three of them glanced at her in shock.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Why were they looking at her like that?</p><br/><p>\u201cYo-your Highness!\u201d Bai Yi\u2019s eyes went wide as he looked at her with shock. He turned back toward the checkpoint machine. \u201cThis\u2026 this\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Yao Si could not understand what was happening. \u201cIf you\u2019re in a rush, you could get it signed first! You are both here anyway.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not it!\u201d Bai yi replied. \u201cWe didn\u2019t go over, but it\u2019s you who appeared behind us!\u201d</p><br/><p>Huh?</p><br/><p>What did that mean?</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is indeed a problem here!\u201d Lin Long frowned, then took a step forward. After less than two steps, his figure started to waver, and he suddenly disappeared in front of their eyes. The next second, a familiar voice came from behind them. \u201cThat explains why my space portal wasn\u2019t able to open up.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si took a glance ahead before turning around toward Lin Long who was behind her before gaining enlightenment. The same thing had happened to her; once she had reached the checkpoint, she had been transported away.</p><br/><p>(\u2299_\u2299)</p><br/><p>Was that a revolving space portal?</p></div>\n</div>"}

The one that just disintegrated was a black planet. Wasn\u2019t Earth the Blue Planet? This one had no single bit of blue on it!</p><br/><p>However\u2026 the space station that Yao Si was on was on the backside of the planet. It was the side without light, so it was very normal for it to look black. Besides, if she had really come to the future, after all these years, the resources on Earth would have been used up, so it changing to a different color didn\u2019t seem to be\u2026</p><br/><p>No, there was no way Yao Si was accepting this horrifying truth. She still had a whole hard-drive of TV shows she hadn\u2019t finished watching; a wall full of anime she hasn\u2019t seen yet; a whole phone full of novels she hadn\u2019t taken a peek at yet. She had been in a rush when she left the house, so she hadn\u2019t even fed the cat yet.</p><br/><p>Has anyone considered the cat\u2019s feelings? Do your hearts not ache?</p><br/><p>The main thing was that even though she was this old, she hadn\u2019t left the boundaries of F city before. There was a whole wide world out there that she hadn\u2019t seen yet, so how could it be gone?</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss Yao, Miss Yao?\u201d Her shoulder became heavy as she was suddenly pushed by someone.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh\u2026\u201d Yao Si was shocked and finally retraced her thoughts. Her brain was still a mess, so it took her a while to look up at the person next to her. \u201cDr. Wang?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCommander Lu and the deputy commander are here.\u201d Dr. Wang pointed to the door. \u201cThey have some questions they want to ask you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Commander and deputy commander, weren\u2019t they the first and second in charge of this place?</p><br/><p>Yao Si turned around to take a look, and a face filled with agitation and accusations stared right at her. This person was in a black uniform, and there was a sense of \u201cI\u2019m not someone you mess with\u201d about him.</p><br/><p>It made Yao Si\u2019s heart sink, ummmm\u2026 She didn\u2019t owe this commander any money, right?</p><br/><p>\u201cNice to meet you, commander Lu.\u201d She waved her hand and greeted him.</p><br/><p>Upon a closer inspection, she realized that there was another person behind him. Compared to the \u201cyou owe me money that you haven\u2019t yet repaid\u201d commander, the deputy commander behind him looked much kinder. With a face full of smiles, he responded with a nod.</p><br/><p>The commander\u2019s with the last name of Lu line of sight flew right past Yao Si, and he asked the person beside him, \u201cIs the genetic examination done?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been done, the results will come out in a few minutes,\u201d Dr. Wang answered.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d He waved his hand over his forearm and pulled up an optical screen. Yao Si guessed that it was probably something like a portable computer.</p><br/><p>He seemed to have opened up some file, for with a look of \u201cbusiness is business\u201d, he cast his eyes at her again and asked, \u201cYour name is Yao Si?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIdentify your gender, race, age, planet, and the person in charge of that planet.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si was dumbstruck, was this\u2026 a census survey? Still, she replied obediently, \u201cFemale, Chinese, 28, lived on the planet\u2026 Earth, person in charge\u2026\u201d Who should she name\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you joking around?\u201d</p><br/><p>Before she had the chance to finish, commander Lu\u2019s brows twisted into a knot. If back then he had been owed five million, then the amount had just increased to ten million.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss Yao, if you want to be acquitted of a charge, please at least find a better excuse.\u201d With a \u201cbeep\u201d, Commander Lu shut the optical screen in his hands down and stared with a great disapproval at her. \u201cThe third planet Earth has been unsuitable for living since tens and thousands of years ago, the entire galaxy knows this. Using this excuse to avoid punishment, are you treating my No.333 space station as nothing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAcquitted of a charge?\u201d Yao Si was a little confused. \u201cWhat charge?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNeed I remind you?\u201d Commander Lu chuckled sarcastically. \u201cEntering without permission into the locked level-ten dangerous planet, seriously affecting the planet termination plan of the Union, wasting the Union\u2019s search resources. Every single one of these violations is enough for me to report you to the galactic law court.\u201d</p><br/><p>What was this galactic law court?</p><br/><p>\u201cHold up!\u201d She needed to clear this up. \u201cThe level-ten dangerous planet that you just mentioned\u2026You\u2019re not referring to Earth, are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat other level-ten dangerous planet is there in the solar system?\u201d The accusation in the commander\u2019s voice deepened. \u201cYoung people like you really don\u2019t know the immensity of heaven and earth, what do you think planet termination is? A scenic planet for tourism? Can you fool around there?</p><br/><p>\u201cHow could you ignore the galactic union\u2019s law at such a young age. No matter what race you belong to, your ministry of foreign affairs needs to give us an explanation.\u201d</p><br/><p>Oh shoot! How did this escalate to the ministry of foreign affairs? Growing up, the most important official Yao Si had ever seen was just a university dean.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou mean\u2026 I trespassed onto Earth and affected your work, so I have committed a crime?\u201d The commander didn\u2019t reply, the answer was obvious. \u201cBut\u2026 I was originally on Earth? I was born there, it\u2019s you guys who\u2026\u201d Dug me out.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough, no more quibbles.\u201d Commander Lu impatiently cut off her sentence. \u201cRelax, you won\u2019t be locked up for too long, but you\u2019re not going to get away from the two percent maximum jail time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat I said was all true!\u201d She was really wronged for goodness sake! And what was this two percent jail time? Didn\u2019t they go by years at this place?</p><br/><p>\u201cMy dear commander, my brother, please listen to me. I have been asleep underground for a long time, maybe even thousands or tens of thousands of years. I still don\u2019t know how to calculate the exact time yet, but it\u2019s definitely before your plans even\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEnough!\u201d Lu Ren clearly didn\u2019t believe her words. He turned and walked out with no hesitation. \u201cIf you have anything to say, then say it in the galactic law court.\u201d</p><br/><p>Oh hell, things weren\u2019t going well for her. Being turned into a vampire was acceptable, but waking up from a nap to learn that Earth was gone? And the next thing awaiting her was jail\u2026 Was she really that unfortunate?</p><br/><p>\u201cNo wait, commander\u2026\u201d Listen to me, let me explain!</p><br/><p>\u201cCommander.\u201d The deputy commander that was standing silently nearby turned and gave her a \u201cdon\u2019t worry\u201d look. He extended his arm and stopped commander Lu Ren who was about to walk through the doorway. \u201cFrom what I see, I don\u2019t think she\u2019s lying, maybe\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaybe what?\u201d Commander Lu\u2019s hard face didn\u2019t change. \u201cEven if she\u2019s truly healthy and robust, you saw what the environment on the third planet was like. In that condition, no race can survive for more than two days, so how could she have been there before the planet termination plan?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not\u2026 completely impossible.\u201d The deputy commander\u2019s voice became coarse.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Lu Ren\u2019s brows twitched. As if he had remembered something, his eyes suddenly widened. \u201cYou mean\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The deputy commander nodded. \u201cWe found her in a place a few thousand meters underground, and that place was the third planet\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cImpossible, it\u2019s not like you don\u2019t know how protective that race is of their own people? If they knew they had any of theirs unconscious for a few days, they would have sent people over here a long time ago.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut\u2026 they do have the tradition of going into hibernation.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Ren folded his brows, then turned again and looked at her. His expressions was extremely weird. He was so attentive that it was like he was going to stare a flower out from her face.</p><br/><p>Yao Si had goosebumps from being stared at by him and moved uneasily. However, the next moment that person turned around in a haste again, shaking his head firmly.</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if they do, it still wouldn\u2019t be her.\u201d Lu Ren felt that he was having some groundless worries. \u201cYou\u2019ve heard her, she said she was only 28. You think about those people, how can this age be possible?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s always wise to play it safe.\u201d The deputy continued to persuade him, \u201cHer race still remains a question, and besides, she\u2019s not the only trespasser that we caught this time, how about \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo! It was because of our previous connivance that there was so much added difficulty to our work. No matter what, this violation must be treated with seriousness.\u201d The commander seemed to be angered by his words, for his voice had reached ten notes higher. \u201cThis is a matter of our space station\u2019s glory! How can you cave in to some minor external uncertainties, where\u2019s your dignity as the deputy commander?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d The words that were about to roll out of the deputy\u2019s tongue were forced back down his throat.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh, I don\u2019t believe this. A big space station like ours can\u2019t even dispose of a violating trespasser. Didn\u2019t you do the genetic test? What\u2019s the result?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCommander, it\u2019s out,\u201d Dr. Wang replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cSend the result over to me!\u201d When the commander finished speaking, he slapped the deputy\u2019s shoulder. \u201cWang, you always like to worry for nothing. If she\u2019s really from that race\u2026\u201d He turned and gave a look at Yao Si, then humphed with contempt. \u201cHumph, I will eat poop right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>He said those words while turning on the optical screen on his arm with great force.</p><br/><p>He took a look.</p><br/><p>Then\u2026</p><br/><p>His face turned pale\u2026</p><br/><p>Then it flushed green\u2026</p><br/><p>And then it deepened to black\u2026</p><br/><p>Even his hands began to tremble, and his eyes widened and widened as if they were about to fall out from the sockets.</p><br/><p>And just like that, he stared at the optical screen for whole ten minutes, then turned it off with a beep\u2026</p><br/><p>The next instant, Yao Si felt like wind was about to rise, and a smiling face that looked like it was about to crack suddenly appeared before her eyes. Commander Lu held her right hand in both his hands and asked with a voice that sounded as sweet as dripping honey, \u201cHonorable lady of the bloodlings, are you hungry? Are you thirsty? Would you like some duck blood curd?\u201d</p><br/><p>His attitude was very amiable, the voice so lively, with innumerable raises and falls in intonation. \u201cDo you want me to eat hot poo, or cold\u2026 Pah! Do you like to eat fresh blood curd or the quick-freeze ones? I have both.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Huh????</p>\n</div>"}

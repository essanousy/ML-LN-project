It could be said that no one could rival him. What was even more rare was that even his IQ was the highest. It was because of this that he was more inclined to winning using his smarts compared to the bloodlings who fought without any extra word.</p><br/><p>If he used ordinary trickery, that would be easily dealt with. However, what corresponded to his astonishing abilities were his shrewdness, it was even more shocking than anything else about him.</p><br/><p>In Yao Qian\u2019s words, he was an unprecedented, purely natural, free of any impurity \u2013 a lunatic!</p><br/><p>If someone lined up those he\u2019d tricked, from planet sovereigns to one or two year old children, they could circle the planet numerous times. He had tricked almost every person, and his motto was: \u2018I see. I come. I trick\u2019.</p><br/><p>The best proof of that would be that as the saviors of the galaxy who had extinguished the Zergs, the bloodlings had for a long time been upheld as the existence of a hero-like species. That was until he appeared\u2026</p><br/><p>In less than a century\u2019s time, the bloodlings had become a terrifying species that caused headaches whenever barely their name was mentioned.</p><br/><p>Initially, no one among bloodlings cared about this, since no matter what he was still part of the family. Besides, as an immortal species they lived for so long, it was needless to say that they all found some way to have fun, who didn\u2019t have one or two hobbies.</p><br/><p>Thus, the bloodlings had a careless attitude towards this person who let himself himself loose in the outside world. As long as he didn\u2019t commit things like exterminating a whole planet or killing off an entire species, which went above personal feuds, he could do whatever he wished.</p><br/><p>Moreover, the species in the galaxy lasted for at most for thousands of years, while some died off in less than a couple hundred, so what dispute couldn\u2019t death solve? The galaxy is so vast, so no matter how badly some people are tricked, how clear they remember it, there will always be a day when it all fades away.</p><br/><p>However, this point was realized not only by the bloodlings but also Qu Ze! He plotted for so long to trick people into great confusion, yet in the end they forgot or their entire race died out. Qu Ze felt that this strongly impacted his enthusiasm for deception, and for a high IQ lunatic like him, this was clearly unacceptable.</p><br/><p>To ensure that his ability to deceive maintained a continual and stable progress, he shifted his line of sight on his own species. That\u2019s right, he wouldn\u2019t even let his own people off the hook. This kind of thing had now lasted for billions of years, and all the people of the bloodlings, no matter young or old, female or male, thirtieth generation, fortieth generation, or even seven or eight hundredth generation newborns that were still in kindergarten were all tricked by him with no exception.</p><br/><p>Some he tricked mildly once or twice, while some were so serious that his victims were still recovering from it even though few hundred years had passed.</p><br/><p>His personality was so bad that it made people\u2019s blood boil!</p><br/><p>It also just so happened that those that were being tricked didn\u2019t realize that they had been fooled until the last moment. And when they finally came to grasp it, he was already on the run. It was because of this that Qu Ze had become the first subject whose entry all species strongly opposed to, including the bloodlings.</p><br/><p>\u201cSecond elder was tricked by him into hibernating for three hundred years; third elder mistook someone else for his wife because of him, which almost led to a divorce; fourth elder wanted to add some volume to his hair, but now there\u2019s not a single strand of hair on his head; the prettiest spirit animal owned by fifth elder has not gotten over its depression yet; sixth elder\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Qian listed a certain person\u2019s crimes in detail, and the more Yao Si listened the more embarrassed she got. Although these weren\u2019t anything major, not some national hatred or family bad blood that needed to be resolved with death, but each gave people the impulse to crunch their teeth and give him a beating.</p><br/><p>If there\u2019s one word which could be used to describe him then it would be \u2013 annoying!</p><br/><p>Really freaking annoying. So should she be glad that he only dragged her to a few days\u2019 long experiment?</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why we said that he returned specially for\u2026 for Your Highness!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShit!\u201d So he really did come all the way just to trick her. \u201cSeriously!\u201d He was so annoying!</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve all been deceived by him, so\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo I was the one with the lowest level of difficulty?\u201d Because he had tricked so many people, idiots had become scarce, that\u2019s why he found her. F*ck! Why did she feel like this reason was so messed up!</p><br/><p>Yao Qian nodded, and after seeing her looking as if there was nothing to live for anymore, he couldn\u2019t help but add, \u201cAfter this, he won\u2019t do anything to Your Highness in a short while.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShort while?\u201d <em>Don\u2019t stop me, I need to erase one asshole!</em></p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Your Highness, the Elders\u2019 Committee will escort the Great Elder out of the planet in no time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si let out a long sigh, but there was still something that she was unable to figure out. \u201cHe has tricked so many people, hasn\u2019t there been anyone that sued him?\u201d No matter how small the matter, many a little makes a mickle, he must have violated some regulations, right? \u201cWhy can he still walk about free and unfettered in the galaxy?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Qian\u2019s facial muscles twitched. He answered with a solemn expressions, \u201cBelieve me, Your Highness, keeping him inside the Red Planet is far scarier than deporting him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>In the Elders\u2019 Committee someone said, \u201cHave you got eyes on the person?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s already been brought to the top security interrogation room, it has 24-hours non-stop scanning.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOnly surveillance and scanning?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, seventh and ninth elders are also there to keep a close watch on him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s reassuring, when is the earliest flight to the W galaxy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTomorrow morning at nine.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood, send him away immediately when the time comes! Don\u2019t delay.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood, Second Elder.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow\u2019s her highness? Has she been examined?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHer health is fine, she\u2019s now asleep.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s excellent! This incident is our negligence at work. Her Highness has just woken up, she\u2019s still puzzled about everything in this world, so we must not let Qu Ze have any more contact with her.\u201d</p><br/><p>Third Elder frowned. With his face full of distress, he asked, \u201cWe will send him away this time, but if he still won\u2019t give up the idea, the next time\u2026\u201d Who will be able to stop him?</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone fell silent.</p><br/><p>A good while passed\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cHow about\u2026 Let\u2019s go the the Majestic Palace and wake up his majesty. Only he can\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>All the elders looked at each other, seeing the approval in the other person\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen that\u2019s settled!\u201d Second Elder stood up. \u201cLet\u2019s go\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Before he could finish saying his sentence, a person suddenly forced open the conference room door and rushed in.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is not good! His Majesty is gone!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>Right then, Yao Si awoke with a start from her sleep</p><br/><p>Full of confusion, she looked at the man who had suddenly appeared next to her bed. Was she encountering psycho number two?</p><br/><p>The corners of her lips jerked and she sat up straightaway, staring at the person who was half hidden by the shadows. She was far from being scared, since her racial advantages were very obvious in such a situation.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you sleepwalking?\u201d</p><br/><p>The silhouette paused, then shook its head.</p><br/><p>\u201cToo full from midnight snacks?\u201d</p><br/><p>The head was shaken again.</p><br/><p>\u201cWalked to the wrong room while looking for a bathroom?\u201d</p><br/><p>Still the figure shook its head.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what are you doing in the middle of the night not sleeping and pretending to be a ghost in my room?\u201d</p><br/><p>The other person stayed silent for a moment, then took a stride out of the shadow, exposing a face that could take a person\u2019s breath away. Just by standing there, it was as if he had lit up the entire night sky. Black hair that swept the floor and were as smooth as high-quality silk, a pair of blood-red pupils which didn\u2019t look exceptionally glamorous but gave off a sense of calmness that felt like the surface of the ocean after thousands of boats had passed.</p><br/><p>Yao Si was unable to respond right away, and even her displeasure for being woken up had suddenly disappeared without a trace. She could only subconsciously stare at that face, unable to pull her eyes away.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho\u2026 are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>He walked over, his eyes glued to her the whole time, then opened his mouth and said with a cool but indisputable voice, \u201cI am your father!\u201d</p><br/><p>The corner of her mouth twitched. \u201cHaha, then I\u2019m your great uncle!\u201d</p>\n</div>"}

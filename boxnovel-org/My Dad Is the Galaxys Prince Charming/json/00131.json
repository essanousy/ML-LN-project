For an inheritor to only receive 80% of such memory\u2026</p><br/><p>Yao Si felt her heart tremble. She shielded her eyes with a hand in pity.</p><br/><p>The other inheritors started off from nothing to gaining half a life worth of knowledge. But for Li Zheng, he started with all the knowledge, but ended with limited one\u2026 What a tragedy.</p><br/><p>In conclusion, the person which obtained her information would probably be the most pitiful inheritor out there!</p><br/><p>\u201cThere isn\u2019t any precedence I can refer to, so I\u2019m not sure how to deal with it\u2026\u201d Yao Qian appeared at a loss.</p><br/><p>The \u2018new\u2019 Li Zheng wasn\u2019t able to communicate effectively without the translator, which was exactly how Yao Si had been after she had awakened. However, back then, Yao Si had His Majesty with her, so she was able to pick up the language fairly quickly. But Li Zheng was just an inheritor\u2026</p><br/><p>Yao Qian shivered, not willing to continue the thought.</p><br/><p>\u201cSend him over!\u201d Yao Si instructed.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh! Ah?\u201d Yao Qian stilled, his eyes going wide in disbelief.</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t he my inheritor?\u201d If she had caused it, she had to deal with it. \u201cEven though I\u2019m not too confident in my skills in Galactic language, I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll be able to help him out. Besides, Mu Xuan will be around to aid me as well!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHi-his Majesty?\u201d Yao Qian was clearly taken aback. <em>Are you sure His Majesty will teach him and not strangle him? Does Your Highness not know how bloodlings feel toward their cubs\u2019 inheritors?</em></p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, it\u2019s decided. Besides, I don\u2019t trust\u2026 the others.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Zheng had indeed gone overboard. But no one else other than Yao Si and Mu Xuan knew about his invasion, so even Yao Qian was mostly in the dark.</p><br/><p>Now that Li Zheng had become a completely different person, they just wished for him to have a fresh start. If they buried the matter. It would be the best for both the bloodlings and Li Zheng.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs for his schooling, I\u2019ll deal with it myself.\u201d Yao Si was the committee president of the school, afterall, even if she didn\u2019t do much.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome have your meal.\u201d Mu Xuan walked out of the kitchen and waved her over.</p><br/><p>Yao Si immediately sat down, since she had already started to feel hungry. With all the things that had happened, she had missed out on a few days\u2019 worth of school and had been trying desperately to catch up.</p><br/><p><em>Eh, being a good student is hard indeed. </em></p><br/><p>In the mid of their meal, the doorbell rang.</p><br/><p>Just as Yao Si was about to stand up, Mu Xuan went to the door. Yao Si had an idea who it might be, so she followed behind with her bowl.</p><br/><p>As expected, Li Zheng stood outside with a radiant smile on his face.</p><br/><p>Maybe due to his inheritor background, he greeted them in order. \u201cHi dad, I\u2019m here!\u201d He then turned toward Mu Xuan to greet him solemnly. \u201cGrandfather!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Yao Si.</p><br/><p>With a loud thud, Mu Xuan smashed the door shut.</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>After exerting her entire life\u2019s worth of brainpower, Yao Si in the end managed to gain Mu Xuan\u2019s approval for Li Zheng to learn the Galactic language from her for a short while.</p><br/><p>But ever since he entered the house, the aggressive aura around Mu Xuan had intensified, and he glared at Li Zheng threateningly. Yao Si had assumed that Li Zheng\u2019s second conversion would have resolved any ill feelings but\u2026 it seemed to have made the situation worse?</p><br/><p>Even the oblivious Li Zheng seemed to sense Mu Xuan\u2019s displeasure. He struggled to reduce his presence, to minimize his 1.89 m height. As he rubbed the goosebumps on his arms, he lightly tapped Yao Si\u2019s arm and asked in a low voice, \u201cDad, does grandfather hate me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si face muscles twitched. \u201d He will hate you more if you continue to call him grandfather.\u201d For a middle-aged to call someone grandfather\u2026 How could that feel all right! \u201cAnyways, who taught you to address him like that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe old Chinese physician from the hospital!\u201d He pointed in the direction of the research facility.</p><br/><p><em>Old Chinese physician\u2026</em></p><br/><p>Yao Si was left at a loss for words. After some thought, she asked, \u201cYou mean Yao Qian?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d Li Zheng nodded, turning to glance at Mu Xuan weakly only to receive a cold glare. With a shiver, he lowered his head and averted his gaze before saying,\u201dAll bloodlings call their mentors dad, so isn\u2019t your mentor my grandfather?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p><em>Alright, seems logical, nothing wrong here. </em> \u201cBut I\u2019m not your mentor.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh? No?\u201d He stilled.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an inheritor, not my cub, which means you don\u2019t have a mentor\u2026\u201d Yao Si made sure to emphasize that point. \u201cYou should call me by my name instead, Yao Si.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, I see. That\u2019s great!\u201d Li Zheng wasn\u2019t the least bit disappointed. He instead heaved a sigh of relief. \u201d Sis, you should have told me earlier! Addressing you as my dad seemed a little awkward, but I was afraid that you would be offended if I didn\u2019t address you properly! Oh, Yao Si, that\u2019s the name in my memory!\u201d</p><br/><p>He broke into laughter, his entire being relaxing. He seemed to have transported back to the days when he sold duck blood curd. Out of habit, he even raised his arm to pat Yao Si\u2019s shoulder.</p><br/><p>Before he could touch her though\u2026 he was stopped by Mu Xuan!</p><br/><p>With his sharp reflexes, he grabbed Li Zheng\u2019s hand. With his eyes darkening, he looked almost like a reaper.</p><br/><p>\u201cOuch,ouch,ouch\u2026\u201d Li Zheng\u2019s face twisted as he struggled to pull his hand back.</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter you finished with transferring the information?\u201d <em>Take your paws away from my cub! </em> Mu Xuan tossed his hand away with disgust before turning toward Yao Si who was on her optical computer.</p><br/><p>She was confused, but nodded. \u201cI\u2019m\u2026 done.\u201d</p><br/><p>She had transferred Li Zheng the information that Mu Xuan had prepared for her. It consisted of the Galactic language with Chinese words to learn, and it was probably the only copy in the whole Galaxy. It was perfectly suitable for Li Zheng\u2019s use.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can leave now.\u201d Mu Xuan tapped onto the room\u2019s automatic control. A door opened, which was a clear sign for the other to get lost.</p><br/><p>\u201cBu-but I don\u2019t have anywhere to go!\u201d Li Zheng was full of confusion as turned to look pleadingly at Yao Si.</p><br/><p>\u201cMu Xuan\u2026\u201d she started. <em>He\u2019s someone familiar, so you can\u2019t just cast him into the streets. </em> \u201cCan we\u2014\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d <em>I haven\u2019t even finished asking!</em></p><br/><p>Mu Xuan frowned, then switched on his optical computer to send a few messages. \u201cSomeone will come pick him up.\u201d</p><br/><p>Indeed, a person came after a short while. When they opened the door, Bai Yi stood there.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Highness, Your Majesty, you wanted me to get someone?\u201d Bai Yi smiled enthusiastically. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I will take good care of him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mu Xuan nodded and pushed the confused Li Zheng onto the aircraft.</p><br/><p>After half a minute, Li Zheng asked, \u201cHey.. bro, do bloodlings have something against inheritors?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt depends on who is it, but you just have to get used to it.\u201d Bai Yi patted his shoulders. \u201cOh right, who are you? Why did His Majesty emphasize that you\u2019re an inheritor? Who converted you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYao Si.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Bai Yi stumbled, almost falling off the aircraft. \u201cYao-Yao Si, Her Highness!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMmh, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Yi inhaled deeply before taking a closer look at him and exclaiming in disbelief, \u201cYou\u2019re still alive?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

Isn\u2019t it the Red Planet that\u2019s in danger?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t!\u201d His brows slammed downwards. \u201cWe investigated according to the data sent back by the Thirteenth Elder, but not long ago, Bai Yi swapped out the data and found something else about the Red Planet.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSomething else?! What is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t be sure yet\u2026\u201d He shook his head while starting to grow increasingly frantic. \u201cNo one has seen it before, but you\u2019ll understand once you get a look at it.\u201d</p><br/><p>The aircraft increased in speed, sending them to the Elders Council in less than two minutes. Surprisingly, the elders hadn\u2019t been awaiting their arrival. Nephew Gu went straight in and got a square object for her to pin to her chest.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a particle transportation device,\u201d he explained. \u201cThe location has been set, so you will be sent there directly. The elders are already there, waiting.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si didn\u2019t doubt his words and activated the object at the same time as him. In the blink of an eye, they were transported to another location. The space was huge and enclosed, the surroundings filled with black mud. The sky was covered with equipment to light up the place so that it wouldn\u2019t be too dark.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Highness, why are you here?\u201d The moment they arrived, a group of people closed in on them. On closer inspection, Yao Si realized that there were other people besides the elders involved in the investigation.</p><br/><p>Just as Gu Shucheng was about to explain, Second Elder\u2019s face darkened, and he turned to Shucheng with anxiousness. \u201cThis is absurd, Her Highness is still young. How can you bring her to such a dangerous place? If anything\u2026\u201d <em>His Majesty will kill all of us.</em></p><br/><p>\u201cForget it, forget it, I made him bring me over.\u201d Yao Si stepped forward to explain Mu Xuan\u2019s whereabouts before shifting the conversation. \u201cOh right, you mentioned that something special was found. What exactly is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>The elders\u2019 faces paled, and they exchanged glances with each other. In the end, Second Elder turned to point at the back. \u201cYour Highness, take a look over there.\u201d</p><br/><p>Her gaze followed his fingers, but it was pitch black there. At first, she assumed it was so because there weren\u2019t enough lights, but on closer inspection, her eyes went wide.</p><br/><p><em>F*ck! What\u2019s that?</em></p><br/><p>(\u2299 o \u2299)</p><br/><p>The pitch black darkness wasn\u2019t an empty space. It seemed to be occupied by something that kept fidgeting, its movements resembling water ripples that glistened. Yao Si immediately associated it to the harvesting water, but as she concentrated, she realized the water wasn\u2019t blue but red. Large patches of red fluid covered the space. It seemed like\u2026 blood?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2026 what\u2019s that?!\u201d Even though it was a fluid, it was definitely not the same harvesting water she had seen on the Heavenly Planet.</p><br/><p>\u201cWithout any samples, we aren\u2019t able to determine what it is.\u201d Second Elder frowned. \u201cBut it has taken over a large area, almost a tenth of the Red Planet.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a lot!\u201d Yao Si exclaimed, recalling the situation on the Heavenly Planet. \u201cHas the area been scanned? Are there any Galactic beasts?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNone.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cAfter we found this, we did a thorough scan of the entire planet, but there aren\u2019t any signs of life.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d Yao Si heaved a sigh of relief. Shaking her head, she glanced at the red blood before taking a few steps back. \u201cBack what exactly\u2014\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Highness!\u201d Several cries rang out together before she could finish her sentence.</p><br/><p>Yao Si turned to see a sea of shocked faces. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d She didn\u2019t do anything, right?</p><br/><p>\u201cY-your Highness, can you go in?\u201d Nephew Gu asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cGo in?\u201d She stilled. What did he mean? \u201cWhat do you mean by go in? Where do I go?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Highness, can\u2019t you feel it?\u201d His shock intensified. Gu Shucheng took a step forward, stopping about three to four steps away from her. He reached out to feel the space in front of him. \u201cThere\u2019s a barrier here. None of us can pass through it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Barrier? The corners of Yao Si\u2019s lips twitched. <em>There\u2019s such a thing?</em></p><br/><p>She walked back to where Nephew Gu was and reached out. \u201cThere isn\u2019t!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI guess this doesn\u2019t affect Her Highness.\u201d The elders frowned. \u201cNone of us can get close to that thing, even the sensor can\u2019t get through.\u201d</p><br/><p>That explained why there were looking over at it from afar. \u201cIs this a mental barrier?\u201d She remembered the research base on Nirvana Planet.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid not.\u201d Second Elder shook his head. \u201cWe can\u2019t be sure what it is at the moment. Your Highness, could you help us extract some of that substance? We would like to test it to determine what it is.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d Yao Si reached out for a transparent test-tube and headed toward the pile of blood. As she got closer to the fluid, a familiar feeling started to surge within her. It seemed\u2026 like she knew it? But where had she seen it?</p><br/><p>She tossed the ambiguous emotions aside and followed Second Elder\u2019s instructions. After opening the test-tube, she reached for the fluid. But suddenly, she heard agitated screams.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Highness, be careful!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si\u2019s heart sank, and she took several steps back before lifting her head up. The calm fluid seemed to have been triggered, bubbling furiously and sending huge red waves into the air. It seemed as though a large hand was reaching out toward her.</p><br/><p><em>F*ck!</em></p><br/><p>She took a few more steps back, but it was too late. The blood seeped past her body and trapped her like a snake, rendering her paralyzed.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Highness!\u201dthe elders exclaimed. They activated their abilities at once, preparing to save her, but despite the number of times they tried it, everything stopped midway. It was only then that Yao Si saw the barrier. It was transparent and split the space into two separate areas.</p><br/><p>\u201cHeh, I never expected you to seek me out even when I didn\u2019t go looking for you myself,\u201d an eerie voice said from behind her.</p><br/><p>This voice\u2026 That f*cking pervert!</p><br/><p><em>F*ck, this can\u2019t be true. Why is he here?! Why do all these radicals like hiding on the Red Planet?!</em></p><br/><p>Yao Si stilled, a chill running through her. She turned and shouted to the crowd that was still trying to save her, \u201cLeave this place!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too late!\u201d A tall and lanky figure came out from the blood. He lifted his lashes and gave her a narrow-eyed look\u2014it was the same arrogant gaze from before. Disdain and scorn oozed from his eyes. \u201cI wanted to leave you bunch of bastards alone, but since you dared to disrupt my peace, you should be prepared to die.\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

Using its big coppery eyes, it seized them up, growling threateningly.</p><br/><p>Its growl sounded much sharper than before when he was in a crowd. With each growl it made, a familiar energy rippled through the air, heading toward them.</p><br/><p>Excitement bubbled through Yao Si as she felt the ripples of energy for the first time. She tapped her mental strength, exerting it outward. It was an unusual experience, as though everything was in her sight: she could even see Zan Zichen\u2019s expression when he was standing behind her. Her mental strength spread out like a huge web, blanketing the beast.</p><br/><p>When the web was inches away from its antlers, the beast seemed to caught wind of something and fell backward abruptly with a loud squeal. A layer of shiny scales shot out from its black body, and the next second, its whole body went aflame. It reflected everything, including Yao Si\u2019s mental strength, back.</p><br/><p><em>Eh, so these cloud-swallowing beasts have fire series abilities? </em></p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s bad!\u201d Zan Zichen paled. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a cloud-swallowing beast, but a soul-devouring beast! The group of cloud-swallowing beasts were trying to escape from him just now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEscape? Then\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRank seven!\u201d</p><br/><p><em>F*ck! Why didn\u2019t you mention it before? </em></p><br/><p>It made sense then that it was able to reflect her mental strength. What was she going to do, though? She was confident about level five beasts, but level seven\u2026</p><br/><p><em>Is it too late to escape?</em></p><br/><p>The beast seemed to have sensed her intention and suddenly widened its mouth, directing a scorching fireball toward her.</p><br/><p>\u201cBe careful!\u201d Zan Zichen warned, summoning a wall made from earth to shield them from the attack. The fireball spread across the wall, sending the ground ablaze. It was becoming a sea of flames.</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior!\u201d Zan Zichen summoned a transparent barrier. \u201cThe soul-devouring beast\u2019s innate skill is camouflage. It is able to change into any form it desires, that\u2019s why I-I couldn\u2019t recognize it previously. Are-are you alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si released a water ability to extinguish the flames. The beast they\u2019ve met wasn\u2019t simple at all; in such a short time, it was able to retaliate and force out her mental strength. The short second she hadn\u2019t been paying attention resulted in a throbbing headache.</p><br/><p>Was that how mental strength was used for attacks? It had to be coagulated and given form before it could attack? Yao Si immediately recalled her mental strength. \u201cZan Zichen, stop him from attacking for a while.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Senior.\u201d He dashed out. With a quick manoeuvre, several swords headed for the creature.</p><br/><p>The soul-devouring beast stumbled backward from the force, then with a howl, it went straight for Zan Zichen.</p><br/><p>Yao Si calmed herself and started to morph the mental strength she released into physical form. Mu Xuan had mentioned that mental strength was a representation of one\u2019s consciousness. Since everyone underwent different experiences, the physical form their mental strength took on would differ and would only be seen during an attack.</p><br/><p>Yao Si quickened her pace, following the instructions in the guidebook\u2014concentrate, compress the released mental strength, and it will congregate into the physical form. Yao Si was slightly emotional as she wasn\u2019t sure how her mental strength looked. With a deep breath, the gigantic web started to come together, and when it finally condensed into a line, it slowly morphed into\u2026 two dots!</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>(\u256f\u2035\u25a1\u2032)\u256f\ufe35\u253b\u2501\u253b</p><br/><p><em>Why is the physical form of my mental strength a mahjong tile?! Even if it\u2019s random, it can\u2019t be this odd! </em></p><br/><p>Was it perhaps because she was playing mahjong when her mental strength began to form? It couldn\u2019t be so absurd, right?! Blue Ball, you better watch out!</p><br/><p><em>Howl!</em></p><br/><p>The beast roared once more, swinging its tail at Zan Zichen. He barely dodged it, almost at his wit\u2019s end.</p><br/><p>Yao Si clenched her teeth\u2014she had to persist! She consolidated all her mental strength and directed it at the beast\u2019s conscience.</p><br/><p>Still! Her mental strength couldn\u2019t be a mahjong tile!</p><br/><p>With a loud thud, the beast\u2019s conscience exploded, and its massive body burst into a ball of flames. On closer inspection, a tiny sign started to form in the middle of the beast\u2019s forehead, but it wasn\u2019t two dots\u2026 it was two bamboos!</p><br/><p>\u25cb|\uffe3|_</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior, you are amazing! That was a level 7 beast!\u201d Zan Zichen exclaimed, his face filled with joy. \u201cBut, I wonder what sorcery you used\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t ask me\u2026 I don\u2019t wish to divulge much!\u201d <em>If I said I used a mahjong tile, would you believe me?</em></p><br/><p>Zan Zichen stopped, not persisting any further. He released the sword in his hand and directed it at the beast\u2019s head. He reached his hand in and pulled out a red bead.</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior, this is the beast\u2019s organ.\u201d</p><br/><p><em>Beast\u2019s organ? What\u2019s that? </em> Yao Si glanced at the blood soaked bead. Before she could ask anything, a sudden ray of light skittered past Zan Zichen\u2019s hand, and the bead that he had been clutching onto flew out, lending in another person\u2019s palm.</p><br/><p>\u201cHeh, you\u2019re just two rogue cultivators and you dare eye my beast organ?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Several men had made their way over, and they were dressed in white robes with blue bases. The leader of the group held the red bead Yao Si had just been examining.</p><br/><p>Did he\u2026 come to snatch their bead?</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been chasing this soul-devouring beast for days only to be interrupted by you two lucky fellows.\u201d The leader pinched the bead in his hands with a smirk as he continued, \u201cSince it\u2019s your first offense, we, the Hundred Cultivation Clan will not make a fuss over it. I\u2019ll keep the level seven beast organ.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHundred Cultivation Clan?\u201d Yao Si asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior, the Hundred Cultivation Clan is now the top clan in the celestial world.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTop? What are they top at? Having the thickest skin?\u201d Yao Si glanced at the person before them. She hated people who took her things. \u201cTo be honest, even though I\u2019ve met people who didn\u2019t care about their face, this is the first time I\u2019ve seen anyone who would take it to such extremes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did you say?!\u201d The man glared at her, his whole body emitting a murderous aura.</p><br/><p>\u201cI mean, why are you dragging in your clan when it\u2019s clearly your own stuff? How could you defame your clan like this? Do your parents know about your behavior?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou- you-\u201d The man stuttered before flicking his sleeves back aggressively. \u201cHow dare you humiliate my clan! I\u2019ll make sure to give you a good lesson!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCome on, who\u2019s afraid! Didn\u2019t you want to snatch other people\u2019s belongings? Who the f*ck is afraid?\u201d</p><br/><p>Her mental strength could defeat beasts, but she had yet to try it out on people. However, since the man offered himself so willingly, it would be rude to decline.</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior and Juniors, let\u2019s punish this maniac who humiliated our clan!\u201d the man shouted out. The crowd behind him brought out their weapons, directing all kinds of spells at the two \u2018rogue cultivators\u2019.</p><br/><p>Yao Si inhaled deeply, releasing all her mental strength at once. It morphed into a gigantic web that trapped the whole crowd. She felt her surroundings magnify instantly, to the point that even a strand of hair was crystal clear. She could even sense the unusual energy around her.</p><br/><p>Was this\u2026 their thoughts?</p><br/><p>She was aware that mental strength could affect people\u2019s thoughts, since Mu Xuan had done it many times before by preventing others from making out his features. But it was the first time she experienced someone else\u2019s thoughts. Even though it wasn\u2019t a very distinct feeling, it was still a huge step forward.</p><br/><p>Joy spread through Yao Si, and she used her mental strength to infiltrate the group\u2019s thoughts. Everyone froze at that moment, as though they had been faced with a huge immovable force. Even the spells that were half-released fizzled out.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou-you\u2026 What is this sorcery?\u201d The leader paled. He started to struggle, but he couldn\u2019t move at all. \u201cWha-what are you trying to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat am I trying to do?\u201d Yao Si chucked. \u201cOf course I\u2019m\u2026 going to do you!\u201d She turned toward Zan Zichen and said, \u201cWalk around and strike their butts!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Senior!\u201d Zan Zichen nodded. He then walked around them with the sword in his hand and struck one of them straight on their butt.</p><br/><p>An endless stream of cries pierced the air.</p><br/><p><em>Eh\u2026 he really is doing it! What an obedient child. </em></p><br/><p>Yao Si gradually released her mental strength from each person after Zan Zichen had dealt with them. Zan Zichen had controlled his strength, ensuring that the men\u2019s lives weren\u2019t at risk and only their butts were targeted. Blood had still splashed everywhere, though.</p><br/><p>\u201cJunior! You-you demonic girl\u2026\u201d The leader trembled with fury. He somehow managed to muster up some energy even though he was still being controlled by Yao Si\u2019s mental strength and jumped upright. He headed toward her with his sword. \u201cI\u2019m going to kill you!\u201d</p><br/><p><em>F*ck! </em>Did he perhaps have some spinach?</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior!\u201d Zan Zichen exclaimed. He wanted to rush to her side, but it was too late.</p><br/><p>The sword with an eerie aura was approaching rapidly, ready to split Yao Si into two. She felt her heart sink, and instinctively, her control loosened. The mental strength linking her to the enemy exploded within him.</p><br/><p>Just as she was about to escape, the murderous man collapsed. The sword lightly grazed her sleeve, falling on the ground along with its owner.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p><em>What\u2019s with this situation?</em></p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d The man was also a face of confusion. He struggled to stand but was restrained by an invisible force. His head went downward the moment he lifted it slightly.</p><br/><p>Gradually, a faint reddish-green marking of a bird started to appear over him. And it seemed rather familiar\u2026</p><br/><p><em>F*ck, isn\u2019t that the young bird marking on mahjong tiles? The legendary bird with feathers on it\u2019s head!</em></p><br/><p>(\u256f\u2035\u25a1\u2032)\u256f\ufe35\u253b\u2501\u253b</p><br/><p>An inauspicious aura came flooding over!</p>\n</div>"}

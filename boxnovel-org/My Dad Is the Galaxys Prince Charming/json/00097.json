It was of the highest priority.</p><br/><p>Yao Si turned toward the others, and saw that they didn\u2019t seem against the idea. \u201cThen you can go ahead with this.\u201d But just as she was about to head back home, she realized that no one else were moving. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Is there anything else?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Highness\u2026\u201d Sister Luo Ying said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t decided on the award for this competition.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAward?\u201d Yao Si paused. \u201cIsn\u2019t there a precedence we can follow?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is the first ever robot competition.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d <em>Er, this is tricky </em>. How could she have any idea on what award was good? A trophy, a medal, or prize money?</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is to motivate the students. So according to the academy\u2019s tradition, the president is responsible for preparing the award which should be special and memorable.\u201d Sister Luo Ying glanced at Yao Si with anticipation. \u201cThere isn\u2019t any restrictions on the object; it would be given together with the prize money.\u201d</p><br/><p>I have to personally decide on an award? What a wasteful tradition!</p><br/><p>\u201cPresident, anything is fine. It doesn\u2019t have to be anything valuable since the prize money is always generous,\u201d a department head added.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnything is fine?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m sure anything you prepare will be well received.\u201d Everyone looked at her with anticipation, clearly in fan mode. Their gazes were burning with sincerity.</p><br/><p>Yao Si lips twitched. \u201cHaha\u2026 Are you guys expecting Mu Xuan\u2019s signature?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Silence fell over the crowd for a moment, but just as Yao Si was about to change her mind\u2026</p><br/><p>All the department heads came rushing over to her .</p><br/><p>\u201cPresident, can I participate too? Those with inside news should be able too!\u201d After she showed the way, others came flooding in as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cPresident! Is it too late for me to transfer to the mechanics department?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMe too, President! I\u2019m originally from the mechanics department.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPresident, can we exchange the prize money for two signatures instead?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p><em>You crazy fans, enough! </em></p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>The robot competition details were finalized just like that. The student committee gave an unusually enthusiastic response toward a competition held by another academy. The news about Mu Xuan\u2019s autograph being set as an award spread like wildfire once the meeting ended.</p><br/><p>The entire academy went into a frenzy!</p><br/><p>A sudden wave robots swept through the academy with almost everyone selecting the robotics field as their optional course. For the very first time, the robotics office wasn\u2019t able to keep up with the influx of interested students. No slots were available after a few days.</p><br/><p>Moreover, it wasn\u2019t just the First Academy which was plagued by such a phenomenon, for the news went viral throughout the entire galactic web. After that\u2026 the entire Galaxy was filled with students trying to squeeze their way into the First Academy.</p><br/><p>Countless people applied for the robot competition, increasing the qualifying matches from the original one to ten rounds. After all, almost 95% of the students had chosen to participate.</p><br/><p>There was also a huge wave of orders on the galactic web\u2019s black market, offering to purchase the competition prize at any price!</p><br/><p>In a blink of an eye, an original friendly competition between academies became an affair that was closely followed by the entire Galaxy. The common greeting among people morphed into: Have you heard about the robot competition by the First Academy?</p><br/><p>The First Academy\u2019s name was sent to another level. They were more like the organizing committee than just a participant and had cast the actual organizer Zhuo Feng Academy aside.</p><br/><p><em>A prayer for Zhuo Feng Academy!</em></p><br/><p>Yao Si had never expected that a casual statement could cause such a series of events, but was it bad? She didn\u2019t really care much about the prize.</p><br/><p>Isn\u2019t it just an autograph? Was this due to her dad\u2019s fame or hers?</p><br/><p>But she was really intrigued by the robot competition after coming across the wide range of robots during the fight with the caterpillar beast. Even though the attack power of robots was not comparable to that of abilities, they offered more protection than blood and flesh.</p><br/><p>Besides, they were new technology!</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Highness, do you want to see the fields available for the optional course?\u201d Luo Ying asked curiously when she sat down beside her.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d Yao Si agreed casually.</p><br/><p>They were allowed to choose other fields in the high school branch. There wasn\u2019t a restriction to the number of courses and the length of the school term, so students were free to learn as much as they desired. However, once the decision was finalized, they would have to pass the final year examination to qualify for the graduation.</p><br/><p>With a high-level mentor Mu Xuan and the bloodling training programme, there wasn\u2019t a need for Yao Si to hone her abilities through the academy. Hence, she could only opt for something else.</p><br/><p>\u201cSuch diligence is as expected of Her Highness,\u201d Luo Ying remarked with a proud expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cI intend to choose three courses, but have only decided on one since there are so many choices. Do you have any suggestions?\u201d Yao Si asked in a conversational manner.</p><br/><p>Luo Ying blushed and her eyes sparkled. \u201cYour Highness, the music department seems like a good choice. With your talent, you would definitely attain galaxywide fame as a singer. There\u2019s also the art department. Your Highness, you look like an extremely artistic person. You can choose to specialise in drawing, directing movies, or design. These are all great courses for women. It\u2019s all good as long as it isn\u2019t something like the manly mechanics department. Oh right, Your Highness, what\u2019s the course you picked?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEr\u2026 Robot Operating\u201d</p><br/><p>Sister Luo Ying froze slightly before saying with a serious face, \u201cYour Highness, this\u2026 is a really great decision! As expected of Her Highness to have such ambition even in the robotics field.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d <em>What an awkward attempt at diverting the topic! </em></p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll pick robot operating as well then.\u201d Luo Ying happily tapped open the course application and selected the option she had just mentioned.</p><br/><p>Could she be any more obvious? Wasn\u2019t girls supposed to do something more feminine?</p><br/><p>\u201cOh right, why did you look for me?\u201d Yao Si asked. Luo Ying should have been having lessons around that time.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, it isn\u2019t anything important.\u201d She waved her hand dismissively. \u201cHelping you choose your course is of greater importance.\u201d</p><br/><p>She continued to describe the other courses in the academy. The First Academy differed from the technical specialization schools in Blue Planet in that there was an extensive range that covered all the subjects in the Galaxy. The high level of technology was probably the reason why teachers weren\u2019t necessary for lessons; everything was taught with the use of technology. Hence, the First Academy offered everything, be it medicine, art, technology, robotics, etc.</p><br/><p>Based on recommendations, Yao Si chose cultural history and biological geography which would aid her in understanding the Galaxy. She clicked the two options and turned to glance at Luo Ying.</p><br/><p>On a closer inspection, she realized the girl was typing in a chat group with several familiar figures. At the very top of the chat was a red row of words.</p><br/><p>[Luo Ying: Attention! Her Highness has already picked mechanics, cultural history, and biological geography so those who wish to admire her from a close proximity, hurry! There\u2019s no time to waste!]</p><br/><p>\u201cYou-your Highness!\u201d Luo Ying flushed a deep shade of red upon noticing Yao Si\u2019 gaze. She explained uneasily, \u201cThese\u2026 these are bloodlings from the academy. They wish to enroll in the same courses as Your Highness, but they didn\u2019t dare to ask you. Since we are somewhat closer\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d <em>You are part of the crazy fan club! </em></p><br/><p>\u201cYour Highness, don\u2019t worry, only a small group of bloodlings will know about it. I won\u2019t sell your information to anyone else!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si lips twitched. \u201cSell?\u201d <em>You sell information as well\u2026</em></p><br/><p>\u201cEr\u2026\u201d Luo Ying froze, her face flushing a deeper shade of red as she stuttered, \u201cYou-your Highness\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cForget it, but make this the last time.\u201d Yao Si sighed. In the end, it wasn\u2019t like it was some sort of secret. \u201cI\u2019ll head home now.\u201d She glanced at the time on the optical computer and saw that it was almost time for lunch.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Your Highness, take care.\u201d Luo Ying perked up instantly, bolting upright.</p><br/><p>Just as they were about to reach the door, the young woman suddenly thought of a question. \u201cOh, Your Highness, may I know when my dad is coming back from the trip he took with you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour dad?\u201d <em>Who is he?</em></p><br/><p>\u201cGu Shucheng.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p><em>F*ck! </em>Yao Si finally realized what had slipped her mind: She had totally forgotten all about Nephew Gu and the others on planet Shadow!</p>\n</div>"}

Ever since the deleting episode, Lin Long had never allowed her inside the lab. Even though she had sneaked in twice intending to cause disruption, it never worked out. He had made a copy of everything!</p><br/><p>\u256e(\u256f\ufe4f\u2570\uff09\u256d</p><br/><p>Hence, till this day, she had no clue what he was doing.</p><br/><p>Just as she was pondering about it, the door suddenly flew open, and Lin Long came into the room. He seemed to have encountered a pleasant event, since his usually infuriated expression was gone. Instead, his brows were relaxed as he gifted her with a rare greeting.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, someone else\u2019s contractor!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, dumb pervert!\u201d Yao Si retorted.</p><br/><p>Lin Long\u2019s lips twitched, his joyful expression stiffening momentarily before returning back to normal as though he\u2019d gotten used to her behavior. \u201cHaven\u2019t you been complaining about being bored? I\u2019m in a good mood today, so let me bring you around.\u201d</p><br/><p><em>Bring me around? Am I your dog?!</em></p><br/><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLets go!\u201d He pulled her off the sofa. \u201cYou will know when we\u2019re there.\u201d</p><br/><p>He made a curve in the air, a black hole appeared. It was space transportation!</p><br/><p>Yao Si stilled. It was the first time she had seen someone other than Mu Xuan use this ability.</p><br/><p>Lin Long dragged her into the portal, and in the blink of an eye, they were no longer on the ground but rather floating in midair. The area before them was pitch black, with only two faint glows in the distance.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere are we?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe boundaries of the abyss.\u201d</p><br/><p>Abyss! Wasn\u2019t that near the borders? Why did he bring her there?</p><br/><p>Yao Si stilled. His words explained the lack of planets around them. She recalled Mu Xuan mentioning the abyss being a deserted galactic with little planets since the majority of them had been eaten up by the Galactic beasts.</p><br/><p>But what was odd was that the surroundings weren\u2019t all dark.</p><br/><p>She turned toward the glowing lights instinctively, but all she could see was a gigantic blue planet. The nearest one allowed her to vaguely make out the vast oceans and the familiar outlines of dry lands and towering mountains.</p><br/><p>\u201cEarth!\u201d she spat, her eyes widening.</p><br/><p>This was clearly the planet she was most familiar with, but how could it be?! When she awakened, she had witnessed the destruction of Earth firsthand, so why was it here? Wasn\u2019t it in the milky wave?</p><br/><p>\u201cYou know the Blue Planet?\u201d Lin Long turned to glance at her inquisitively, then a thought seemed to strike him as he looked her up and down. \u201cWere you an ancient earthling?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si turned her head to glance at him. Was it odd that she was an earthling? Wasn\u2019t it well-known in the Galaxy?</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck, you really are!\u201d His expression was full of disbelief. \u201cI can\u2019t believe there\u2019s still converted earthlings around! I assumed you were a clone created by the pure breed. I was wondering where he got his luck, to meet a real contractor like that. F*ck, f*ck, f*ck!\u201d</p><br/><p>He cursed repeatedly, jealousy and hatred clouding his face, but gradually his expression started to morph as a hint of mockery surfaced. \u201cOld man worked for so many years, even to his death, only for someone else to find the contractor. What a joke.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOld man?\u201d Yao Si stilled. This was the second time she had heard this term from him. \u201cWhat old man? What do you mean?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Long glanced at her, his expression complex. After a long sigh, he said \u201cI guess it\u2019s okay to tell you.\u201d He sunk into a moment of silence as though pondering how to begin. \u201cDo you know where the so-called bloodlings originate from?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAren\u2019t they from the Blue Planet?\u201d Yao Si pointed to the planet at the back. All the bloodlings, including the first generations, were originally earthlings.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat isn\u2019t the Blue Planet, it\u2019s just something I reconstructed that looks exactly the same,\u201d he explained casually.</p><br/><p>Yao Si\u2019s spirits started to rise. \u201cThen this planet\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo!\u201d he objected as though he could predict her question. He then mockingly added, \u201cHow can life begin so easily? If the Blue Planet really could be revived, why would you guys still be cloning people?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh\u2026\u201d Her spirits dampened. It was after all her most familiar place, her home.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou guys indeed originated from this planet,\u201d he said. \u201cBut bloodlings have always been dependant on bloodline inheritance, and the second generation can only come about with the first generation, but where did the first generation come from?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAncestor?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, it\u2019s from the ancestor, but\u2026 who is the ancestor?\u201d</p><br/><p>This\u2026 Yao Si really had no clue. Regardless of it being back when she was on Blue Planet or in the bloodling history, there had always only been the term ancestor. Even though she knew it as the beginning, the knowledge was limited to just the term. Lin Long\u2019s questioning\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve met the ancestor!\u201d Yao Si looked at him in shock.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe aren\u2019t just acquainted, I had been cleaning his *ss for thousands of years.\u201d His lips twitched.</p><br/><p>\u201cWere you guys close?\u201d Yao Si started to feel agitated. That person was after all the ancestor of all the bloodlings. \u201cHurry, tell me! What exactly was he called?\u201d Aggressive and regal names floated in her mind: Cain, Dracula, or Lingo, Houqing, Marmot, Jiangchen? Was it western or oriental?</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s called\u2026\u201d He turned to look at her, his expression solemn as he announced, \u201cWang, Er, Ma <sup>1</sup> !\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p><em>What?</em></p><br/><p>(\u256f\u2035\u25a1\u2032)\u256f\ufe35\u253b\u2501\u253b</p><br/><p><em>You must be f*cking kidding me! </em></p><br/><p>Wang Erma! How can the ancestor of the bloodlings be called Wang Erma? \u201cWhy isn\u2019t he called Zhao Ergou <sup>2</sup> ?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Long\u2019s eyes went wide, surprise clouding his face. \u201cHow did you know I was called Zhao Ergou in the past?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si wanted to puke at the absurdity.</p><br/><p>_(??`\u300d\u2220)_</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, goodbye!\u201d <em>I\u2019m not going to believe this rubbish. </em></p><br/><p>\u201cWait a minute, where are you going?\u201d He grabbed onto her wrist. \u201cF*ck! I\u2019m telling the truth. I wasn\u2019t lying.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLie, continue lying!\u201d Let me see what lies you are going to weave next.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck! Back then, if Wang Erma hadn\u2019t thought of such an incredulous plan to find his contractor, how would I have ended up in such a state?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWait a minute! The old man you are referring to is the ancestor!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho else could I be referring to? He was a f*cking nutcase.\u201d His jaw clenched as he grew increasingly infuriated.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere is he? Is he still alive?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s dead!\u201d He scoffed coldly, his face distorting. \u201cHe was a complete nutcase, converting every earthling in sight just like a mad dog. He claimed it was the fastest way to find the contractor, but he just got himself killed.\u201d</p><br/><p>So\u2026 this was the beginnings of the first generation bloodlings? Because the ancestor had gone bride crazy?</p><br/><p>What rubbish logic was that?</p><br/><p>(\u256f\u2035\u25a1\u2032)\u256f\ufe35\u253b\u2501\u253b</p><br/><p>\u201cWait a minute! Aren\u2019t you a first generation bloodling?\u201d Logically thinking, he should have also been converted by the ancestor, right? But his hateful demeanor didn\u2019t seem characteristic of a cub at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho told you I\u2019m a first generation bloodling?\u201d He rolled his eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m from the same generation as Wang Erma. According to your ways\u201d\u2014he turned to face her\u2014\u201dI\u2019m an ancestor.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p><em>F*ck!</em></p></div>\n</div>"}

Some of them included the dining table, galactic web, the toilet\u2026</p><br/><p>It would always catch Yao Si off guard. With such a persistent pursuer, both her and Mu Xuan were starting to feel mentally lethargic. The one hit the worst would be Lin Long though. He was the one who did not voice any objection, but had instead supported Lian Yu throughout. Even if he was bashed up by Mu Xuan every single time, he remained conscientious without any complaints.</p><br/><p>Yao Si had only heard about people being cuckolded by others, not about people getting themselves cuckolded!</p><br/><p>Was he dumb?!</p><br/><p>However, Lin Long had a logical response. \u201cOnce you have found someone you spent such a long time trying to find, would you bear to reject their requests? Would you? I definitely have to indulge her in all ways!\u201d</p><br/><p>He seemed to make sense, which left Yao Si at a loss for words. She started to recall her interactions with Mu Xuan. Even though he hadn\u2019t pampered her to the same extreme as Lin Long his contractor, he never rejected her anything she desired, even if it had been life-threatening.</p><br/><p>Lin Long\u2019s problem could only be resolved from the root.</p><br/><p>\u201cDearest, do you have thoughts of marrying me today?\u201d Lian Yu smiled radiantly as she left the space portal.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s alright, I\u2019ll ask again next time. Why don\u2019t we spend five minutes on a date? Maybe that would change your mind.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Okay.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLin Long can still last for awhile, so how about five\u2014 What! What?\u201d Lian Yu\u2019s eyes went wide, disbelief clouding her face. \u201cSisi, you\u2026 you agreed!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have something to tell you. If you have time, wait for me in the living room. I\u2019ll be there shortly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFor you, I\u2019ll always have time,\u201d she exclaimed joyously. \u201cSisi, you can tell me everything. I\u2019ll listen to anything you say\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2026\u201d Yao Si could feel a vein bulging on her forehead, on the verge of erupting. \u201cCould you let me use the washroom in f*cking peace!\u201d</p><br/><p>(\u256f\u2035\u25a1\u2032)\u256f\ufe35\u253b\u2501\u253b</p><br/><p><em>Can\u2019t you see that I\u2019m still using the toilet?</em></p><br/><p>Why did she always have such unconventional entrances? She was either climbing through the window, drilling through a wall, or crawling in from underground. That wasn\u2019t a way to get girls, but a terrifying attack\u2026</p><br/><p>If you weren\u2019t a woman, I would definitely beat you up!</p><br/><p>\u201cBut\u2026\u201d Lian Yu hesitated, taking several glances at the toilet door.</p><br/><p>\u201cHurry up and get out! Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ve spoken to Mu Xuan, and he won\u2019t be back so soon.\u201d <em>That is if you don\u2019t drag me away forcefully. </em></p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll be waiting.\u201d Reassured, the queen opened the door to head out. At the last moment though, she turned back bashfully and gave her a coquettish glance.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Yao Si suddenly felt constipated.</p><br/><p>After settling her personal issues with much difficulty, she found a certain someone sitting on the sofa, waiting for her return obediently. In front of her was a screen, and on closer inspection, Yao Si found a marriage registration and another screen with articles like top ten things to do when dating, guide to a honeymoon trip, adoption guide for aves, interactions of old couples, etc.</p><br/><p>The corners of Yao Si\u2019s lips twitched uncontrollably. Should she praise the queen for thinking so far?</p><br/><p>-_-|||</p><br/><p>\u201cSisi\u2026\u201d Lian Yu\u2019s eyes gleamed when she reappeared. \u201cHurry over and help me choose! There are so many guides on the web that I\u2019m spoilt with choice. If we start now, we\u2019ll be blissful in the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>She pulled onto Yao Si\u2019s hand and inched over. Yao Si felt a weight hanging against her, two lumps pressed against her non-existential chest.</p><br/><p>A wave of emotion surging within her. F*ck, was Lian Yu teasing her lack of substance?</p><br/><p>\u201cLian Yu.\u201d She pushed the other aside, then sucking in a deep breath before channeling her most serious expression. \u201cWe need to talk.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMmh, I\u2019m all ears.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you sure the one you like\u2026 is really me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course!\u201d She nodded without a second\u2019s thought.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you like about me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy do you need a reason? I just like you,\u201d she said, giving a political response. \u201cLove needs no reasons.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho says there isn\u2019t a reason for love?\u201d Yao Si retorted before enunciating her next words carefully. \u201cI like Mu Xuan because he is handsome, strong, and most importantly, his care for me is genuine. He pampers me, protects me, and provides me with something reliable in this foreign world.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have been an orphan since young, so I don\u2019t have an understanding of family, but now my home is wherever Mu Xuan is. I finally have a place I can return to. That is something he has given to me, and that\u2019s why I like him. I\u2019m the only one in his heart, and I would like for him to be the only one in mine. Do you understand?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut-but I like you too.\u201d Lian Yu rushed to explain herself. \u201cI want to be with you and stay by your side. I feel happy when I see you and feel sad when I leave you. If that isn\u2019t liking someone, then what is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLian Yu, I have explained this before, but my ability is the reason behind your feelings for me. I\u2019m sorry but I don\u2019t have a solution to reverse this, but if you were to think it through, other than the feelings forced upon you by the ability, are you really that bent on being with me? In the past few months, we have met quite frequently, but do you know me? Let me ask a simple question, do you even know what I like to eat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI-I.\u201d She was stumped for words.</p><br/><p>\u201cLook, you never even thought about trying to know me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, this question doesn\u2019t count since we haven\u2019t even eaten together before!\u201d Lian Yu retorted. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you tell me? I\u2019ll remember it once we get married I\u2019ll-I\u2019ll know you better with time, I definitely will!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI like spicy food and this is something the entire bloodling race knows.\u201d Yao Si sighed. \u201cLian Yu, your understanding of me is worse than of any bloodling out there. It really isn\u2019t as you persistently assume, that I\u2019m the only one for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true.\u201d She shook her head firmly. \u201cYour ability aside, Sisi, you are such a nice person and have helped me out in the Heavenly Planet. So how could I not fall for you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLin Long has helped you before!\u201d Yao Si stated. \u201cAnd not just once! Besides, he has been helping you to this very moment. So do you like him too?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2026 he did it willingly!\u201d Her eyes flashed as she shunned the question aside. \u201cI didn\u2019t force him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t like Lin Long at all?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course! Who would like such a burly man?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d <em>Back then, who was the one who cheered when I had become a man? </em></p><br/><p>\u201cHe is hateful, always sticking to me to the point that I can\u2019t seem to chase him away. Moreover, he giggles like a retard every day while hovering around me. Every time I instruct him to divert Mu Xuan\u2019s attention, he returns with a body full of injuries which I then have to tend. What a useless person!\u201d</p><br/><p>She grew increasingly agitated as she scolded him, listing a whole list of his shortcomings. \u201cAlso, he\u2019s a clean freak. He needs to change his clothes several times a day and can\u2019t seem to tolerate even the least bit of dust, cleaning my entire home repeatedly. It\u2019s so irritating! Even though he\u2019s a grown man, he loves small animals, gifting them to me and boosting about his ability to create every species in existence.</p><br/><p>\u201cHeh, such arrogance! Who cares about that? I\u2019m the queen of the aves, so how could such trickery amuse me? After I prohibited him from the royal planet of the aves, he created a planet nearby to become my neighbor. But who wants to be his neighbor?! Sisi, you don\u2019t know\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si realized that she had unknowingly unleashed a chatterbox. She covered all grounds for about half an hour before stopping. It was only then that she noticed Yao Si\u2019s smile and froze, sinking into a daze. She couldn\u2019t quite comprehend her vast understanding of Lin Long.</p><br/><p>\u201cSee, you know Lin Long much better than you know me.\u201d <em>And you say there\u2019s nothing going on!</em></p></div>\n</div>"}

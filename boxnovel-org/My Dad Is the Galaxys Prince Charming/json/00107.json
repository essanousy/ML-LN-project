There were still many who pressed on with finding a cure for the virus, but in the end, they did not discover a realf antidote.\u201d He sighed, his face darkening. \u201cInitially, one vaccine could indeed suppress the virus. But as time went by, the virus mutated within the infected person\u2019s body, evolving. It transformed into a more deadly virus that killed at a faster rate. The infected victims would turn entirely blue and lose all sanity, turning into an unfeeling monster that could only kill.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cZombies!\u201d Yao Si exclaimed.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can say that.\u201d He nodded. \u201cBut when the news spread, many had already been infected. What\u2019s worse was that anyone who got bitten by someone like that would die, including bloodlings.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen\u2026 what happened next?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn order to control the situation, bloodlings had to step in. The entire race was mobilized to eradicate the source, but there were too many people that had been injected with the vaccine. With their sanity eradicated, they could no longer feel pain and could only go forward attacking others. We\u2026 lost a lot of people at that time.\u201d He sighed once more. \u201cOnce an entire generation was killed, another generation would be sent over and then another, and another\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Her heart clenched.</p><br/><p>\u201cAfterwards\u2026 we realized that at the rate we were perishing, we would end up extinct before the humans. Hence, we converted the remaining humans into bloodlings.\u201d Mu Xuan caressed her head for reassurance. \u201cAt that time, I entered hibernation due to an incident. When I finally woke up, the first thirty generations were no longer around, and the number of bloodlings remaining was small. I was in the last batch that was sent to battle.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWere you alright, did you come back\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He stilled, the corners of his eyes lifting slightly. \u201cSilly!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Yao Si sunk into embarrassment when she realized what she had asked. Her question was indeed silly. If he hadn\u2019t come back, how could he be here with her?</p><br/><p>\u201cI joined the war with the last batch, clearing the planet for three whole months. At the very end, I was bitten by an infected, but at that critical moment, my ancestral bloodline was miraculously awakened, allowing me to survive the ordeal,\u201d he explained briefly as though it wasn\u2019t anything important. Unlike him though, Yao Si was tense and bunched up. \u201cAfter I awakened, I realized that my blood was able to suppress the virus, transforming the entire crisis around.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>So his blood was the only cure for Luo Ying?</p><br/><p>\u201cBut it was a pity that due to that I lost the ability to convert humans into bloodlings. But thankfully, I have you!\u201d He leaned closer, and her figure seemed to take over his entire vision as though\u2026 she was the only one left on Earth.</p><br/><p>Before she could stop it, her heart skipped a beat.</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>The situation was getting out of hand\u2014the virus had originated from Earth? But didn\u2019t it disappear along with Earth a few million years ago? The day she had woken up from her hibernation, Earth was already gone. It gave her a tingling suspicion that someone was plotting something big.</p><br/><p>However, besides the words of Yuan Han, that weirdo, there weren\u2019t any other clues. And even that guy was missing. The Elder Council was left in a frenzy due to the virus, and even Mu Xuan had to personally tend to the matter, but there didn\u2019t seem to be any improvement. They were out in the open while the enemies lurked in the dark. Such a helpless situation was starting to unnerve her.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Highness!\u201d Luo Ying, who rarely came by, glanced at Yao Si bashfully. She opened her mouth but then stopped herself, two visible red marks tainting her cheeks. \u201cI was wondering\u2026 are you free next weekend?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si was thrown off guard by her words. Luo Ying had a straightforward personality, so such restraint from her was out of character.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a holiday and I don\u2019t have anything planned,\u201d Yao Si said with a nod. But when she saw Luo Ying\u2019s eyes brighten, she hurriedly added, \u201cBut due to the virus, Mu Xuan doesn\u2019t allow me to go out by myself.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh\u2026\u201d Luo Ying\u2019s spirits dampened.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Yao Si couldn\u2019t help but ask. When she remembered the encounter with the virus, her heart clenched once more. \u201cOh right, have you fully recovered from the virus? Are there any side effects?\u201d</p><br/><p>Luo Ying appeared visibly touched. \u201cI\u2019m alright now! Fully recovered without any side effects, and it\u2019s all thanks to His Majesty that\u2026\u201d She stilled, as though a thought had just struck her. She then asked with nervousness, \u201cYes, is His Majesty free this weekend? If he came to accompany you, you wouldn\u2019t be out alone.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026 guess so?\u201d Yao Si couldn\u2019t be sure, but recently, Mu Xuan seemed to be really busy, leaving early in the morning and only returning late at night. \u201cIs there something important?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si glanced at Luo Ying seriously, because of which her face blushed a deep shade of red. She started to squirm slightly, biting down on her lip before passing a card over weakly. The card wasn\u2019t the commonly used digital version, but was made from a prehistoric material \u2014 paper. It was a flamboyant shade of red.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d Yao Si reached over. On the card, there were two words in a striking shade of gold \u2013 Wedding Invitation.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re getting married!\u201d Yao Si\u2019s eyes went wide in disbelief. <em>What\u2019s with the rush, aren\u2019t you just a student? </em>No wait, a bloodling\u2019s age was not based on their appearance. Besides, the schools in the Galaxy weren\u2019t the same as on Earth; they didn\u2019t just accept the younger generations. Many adults were enrolled in the academies to learn.</p><br/><p>\u201cMmh.\u201d Luo Ying seemed extremely embarrassed, her entire face red as a tomato. \u201cOriginally, I wanted to wait till the graduation\u2026 But after the incident, he was clearly startled. Even though we are bloodlings, there are still unforeseen circumstances. Besides\u2026 besides, I won\u2019t fall for anyone else. Hence\u2026 we decided to bring it forth.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI see.\u201d Yao Si was still startled. She had never expected the obedient Luo Ying to throw such a bomb out of nowhere. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, this is a grand occasion, I\u2019ll definitely be there.\u201d</p><br/><p>She took a sip of the tea to calm her nerves. Luo Ying was going to get married, so naturally, she had to be there, but she couldn\u2019t seem to figure out when this girl had started dating. After being classmates for a whole year, she never once saw her being intimate with another guy.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh right, who\u2019s the groom, do I know him?\u201d she asked casually.</p><br/><p>Luo Ying\u2019s face turned a deeper shade of red when she glanced at Yao Si bashfully. \u201cYour Highness, you\u2019re teasing me again.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?\u201d <em>I wasn\u2019t teasing\u2026 </em>Yao Si flipped the invitation card open, and two names stared straight at her.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho else other than Gu Shucheng?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ptui!</p><br/><p>(\u2299_\u2299)</p><br/><p>Yao Si spat a mouthful of tea, then coughed a number of times. \u201cGu Shucheng!\u201d<em>She is going to be Nephew Gu\u2019s wife?</em></p><br/><p>\u201cMmh.\u201d Luo Ying nodded, patting her back with suspicion. \u201cEven though it\u2019s a little rushed, both me and Shucheng aren\u2019t that big on formalities.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWait a minute!\u201d Yao Si was confused, her words slipping from her mind without thought. \u201cBut\u2026 but, isn\u2019t he your father?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYea,\u201d Luo Ying replied confidently, even with a hint of pride. Her face then flushed once more. \u201cSo\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p><em>What? What do you mean by so? Explain yourself!</em></p><br/><p>Before Yao Si could ask for clarification, Luo Ying\u2019s optical computer started to beep, and she took a peek before taking a step away with a smile. \u201cI\u2019m sorry Your Highness, the wedding materials that we ordered have arrived, so I need to go back to take a look. I really hope you\u2019ll be there next weekend.\u201d</p><br/><p>With a blissful smile on her face, she exited, leaving Yao Si still in shock from the news.</p><br/><p>Yao Si remained in a daze for five minutes before realizing something\u2026 She seemed to have misunderstood some matters! Immediately, she dialed Bai Yi. She needed an urgent answer!</p><br/><p>Bai Yi picked up almost instantly. In less than a second, he appeared on the screen.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour\u2014\u201d</p><br/><p>Before he could finish his sentence, Yao Si cut him off. \u201cDo you know that Nephew Gu and Luo Ying are getting married next weekend?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Yi stilled before breaking into a radiant smile. \u201cYour Highness, you must have received the wedding invitation? I never thought that they would drag it on for so many years. Originally, I was convinced that they would really wait till Luo Ying\u2019s graduation, so I never expected for them to see the light so quickly. If I knew\u2014\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWait a moment, I can\u2019t seem to understand something.\u201d She inhaled deeply, then said, \u201cIsn\u2019t Nephew Gu Luo Ying\u2019s father?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Yi replied without hesitation, \u201cYea, so\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018So\u2019 again? Why is it always this word, what exactly do you all mean?</p><br/><p>o(\u256f\u25a1\u2570)o</p><br/><p>\u201cAren\u2019t they father and daughter?\u201d If someone is a father to another, it means that they\u2019re related, so how can they get married? Even though bloodlings don\u2019t die and age doesn\u2019t matter, their morals should be intact!</p><br/><p>\u201cFather and daughter?\u201d Bai Yi stilled, confusion washing over his face. \u201cWhat father and daughter? Bloodlings aren\u2019t able to reproduce, so new bloodlings all originate from Earth.\u201d</p><br/><p><em>Oh right! </em>She totally forgot that they weren\u2019t biologically related. Besides, if she were to recall the relationship between Gu Shucheng and Luo Ying, it was clear that they seemed more like\u2026 a couple than a family!</p><br/><p>Her mind was in a mess.</p><br/><p>However, Bai Yi had no clue of the mental trauma she was experiencing as he added in high spirit, \u201cYour Highness, you have no idea how long this couple has dragged on. We were starting to worry that there was something wrong with Shucheng and that they would end up as the first guider pair that didn\u2019t end up together.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst pair!\u201d Yao Si exclaimed, her eyes widening in disbelief. \u201cYou mean\u2026 all the bloodling couples are\u2026 the guider and their cub?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d Bai Yi nodded. \u201cBloodlings always appear in pairs. I even heard that Second Elder drags his cub along even when he leaves for groceries! Ai, only singles like me who haven\u2019t gotten their cub\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si started to panic internally. The bloodlings were actually a race that brought up their other half? The truth was hitting home far too quickly.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo exceptions?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFrom what I know\u2026 it\u2019s quite rare.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRare?\u201d That meant that there were exceptions.</p><br/><p>\u201cEven though there aren\u2019t many bloodlings and we live long lives, there are always a few anomalies.\u201d He gave her a knowing look. \u201cI heard about one casanova who fought with his other half, and there was someone who had gotten someone from another race, but those usually don\u2019t last long. From what I know, there is always a special bond between the guider and the cub, so neither party is able to tolerate a long separation with the other. Singles like me aren\u2019t able to comprehend what that feels like though!\u201d</p><br/><p>She suddenly remembered Mu Xuan\u2019s look the night before, and her heart started to race, the resounding beat echoing in her ears. Minute details from her daily life then started gushing into her mind.</p></div>\n</div>"}

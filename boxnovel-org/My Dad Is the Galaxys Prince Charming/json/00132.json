Ever since that day, he had been glued to her, even glancing at her repeatedly while making their meals. His anxiety started to scare her when he advanced from being a nanny dad who used to only caress her head to a dad that would grab her hand occasionally and even kiss her forehead. Initially, she couldn\u2019t help feeling awkward, but gradually\u2026 she got used to it.</p><br/><p>It got to the point that she started to enjoy his little actions. She definitely wasn\u2019t losing out since he was a hottie after all!</p><br/><p>\u256e(\u256f\u25bd\u2570)\u256d</p><br/><p>Ever since the incident, Yao Si hadn\u2019t attended school, and even Li Zheng\u2019s admission had been arranged by Bai Yi. One of the reasons was the truckload of repercussion actions that were necessary due to the severity of the losses in the battle.</p><br/><p>Even though the bulk of the work was allocated to the Elders Council, there were still documents streaming in for Mu Xuan. Being old foxes, the elders sent all the documents to Yao Si in case Mu Xuan wasn\u2019t willing to respond.</p><br/><p>They turned her into a professional messenger. Whenever she had some free time, she would enter the net which was constantly flooded with all sort of gossip about Qu Ze. That guy seemed to have completely forgotten what restraint meant and published everything onto the Galactic web. Yao Si then understood why he had wanted to borrow Little Ball before leaving.</p><br/><p>As Yao Si settled into her homebody lifestyle, she had the impression of returning to her past self. But then she remembered that the school holidays were in a few days and that returning back at such a timing would seem like an insincere gesture.</p><br/><p>Besides, it was great staying at home, and there was a capable parent who supported her unwillingness to attend school, prepared her meals, served her drinks\u2026 But the main point was that this person also happened to be the Galaxy\u2019s male god. He was extremely protective and had incomparably good looks that served as an eye candy! With such comfort and luxury within her reach, how could Yao Si bear to leave?</p><br/><p>(\u02c7?\u02c7)</p><br/><p>After sinking deep into such a lifestyle, it was hard to escape. Yao Si could feel her drive and motivation for learning fall into shambles. By the time she regained her senses, two months had flown by.</p><br/><p>She couldn\u2019t act this way any longer! She had to set her life straight! She had to work hard!</p><br/><p>Yao Si rejected an elder\u2019s message, determined to fully devote her weekends to her studies. As the most unprincipled parent in history, the intellectual Mu Xuan switched over to his educator mode. He helped her organize all the notes according to the different subjects and fields. He also added easy to read examples for her reference.</p><br/><p>The notes he compiled surpassed what the academy had and were much more comprehensive and understandable. Yao Si\u2019s previous doubts were all cleared after taking a quick look at them.</p><br/><p>She then became stunned. Abilities, machinery, science, common knowledge\u2014was there anything Mu Xuan did not know? He was practically an encyclopedia.</p><br/><p>With a book in her hands, the Galaxy was within her reach!</p><br/><p>Yao Si glanced over at her nanny dad that naturally started explaining what she had asked and her heart grew warm. The capable, all-rounded person was her mentor, her personal mentor! She had to have saved the whole galaxy in her previous life to deserve that!</p><br/><p>Wait a minute!</p><br/><p>Yao Si was suddenly struck with a question: If Mu Xuan knew everything, why did she have to study back then?</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>-_-|||</p><br/><p>Alright, it wasn\u2019t an important question. What was important was that she managed to successfully fill the gaps in her education. She felt confident to take the year end exams.</p><br/><p>After studying, Yao Si sent the notes to both Li Zheng and Bai Yi. The two had been staying together since they had left.</p><br/><p>Yao Si felt confident about leaving Li Zheng with Bai Yi. Even though that youth could be naggy, he was after all a technical whizz. Even if other\u2019s weren\u2019t able to compile a comprehensive study notes for him, she was sure Bai Yi would be able to do it.</p><br/><p>Yao Si sent all her notes over to him and instructed him countless times to ask her if he had any queries. However, she wasn\u2019t sure if it was due to Mu Xuan\u2019s dislike for Li Zheng, but didn\u2019t once come to ask her about the notes she sent over.</p><div class=\"dhwju5c93f8b281a61\"></div><br/><p>Even so, she was still reassured. With Bai Yi\u2019s ability, he would definitely be able to set Li Zheng straight and turn him into a model youth\u2026 eh, uncle. She continued to hold onto that confidence until\u2026 the day she received a message from him.</p><br/><p>[Your Highness, it\u2019s an emergency! Commanding Celestials, District Ten, hurry over! Save us ahhhh\u2026]</p><br/><p>With the message came an invitation.</p><br/><p>Yao Si\u2019s heart sank as she processed the situation\u2014Li Zheng was in danger.</p><br/><p>\u201cMu Xuan!\u201d She turned toward the person beside her instinctively. \u201cSomething\u2026 seems to have happened.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go take a look.\u201d His expression sank slightly, but he nodded and switched open his optical computer.</p><br/><p>Yao Si accepted the invitation. The next second, her awareness sank, and a familiar notification rang out.</p><br/><p>\u201cWelcome to The World of Commanding Celestials!\u201d</p><br/><p><em>Why does it sound so familiar?</em></p><br/><p>A white glow flashed, and she entered an ancient looking area that looking very similar to what she had seen in the celestial lands. Two figures dashed over to her with the one in t he front shouting, \u201cYour Highness, you\u2019re finally here\u2026 Eh?\u201d He paused abruptly, and his eyes went wide in shock. \u201cWhy are you still level 10?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBai Yi?\u201d Yao Si stilled, not able to process the situation.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, a huge crowd appeared behind them. The next second, the sky burst with purplish red powder as weapons rained down onto the group.</p><br/><p>\u201cSh*t!\u201dBai Yi paled.</p><br/><p>All Yao Si heard was a <em>ding </em> before she turned transparent and entered a gray world. Beside her were two other people, transparent just like her. A row of gray words popped out before her.</p><br/><p>[Both success and failure is common, comrade please start over!]</p><br/><p><em>I\u2026 died?</em></p><br/><p><em>What situation is this?</em></p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>As Yao Si popped a pill to regain her blood, she glanced at the two completely foreign faces next to her. One of them belonged to a voluptuous woman.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happened? Where the f*ck is this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe celestial galactic web game!\u201d With a glowing sword on his back, Bai Yi stuffed another pill into his mouth as he explained, \u201cYour Highness, haven\u2019t you played this before?\u201d</p><br/><p>Game? Yao Si stilled, understanding the situation and why the name was seemed so familiar. Wasn\u2019t this the web game in which she had spent three months fighting bunnies? She glanced at her human persona and saw that its name was really Ancestor38.</p><br/><p>It was even in simplified Chinese.</p><br/><p><em>It\u2019s really that game!</em></p></div>\n</div>"}

The bubble helped keep the water out as the little merman pulled her deeper and deeper.</p><br/><p>Gradually, she started to make sense of the surroundings. Unlike what she had imagined, there was a huge city down underwater. With a sweeping glance, she took in the assortment of architecture and crowded roads filled with mermen of many unknown species swimming in big groups. Some species were even as big as whales!</p><br/><p>Yao Si felt as though she had been transported into a sci-fi movie. By the time she regained her senses, the little merman had dragged her to a crystal-like palace with a big sign at the front: Mermen Marriage Registration Centre</p><br/><p>He was serious about registering their marriage!</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle boy\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Just as Yao Si was about to hold the little merman to a stop\u2026 a taller merman who seemed to be part of the service crew walked over. With a face lit with excitement, he asked \u201cYour Highness, what are you doing here??\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si stilled. The little merman was a prince?!</p><br/><p>(\u2299 o \u2299)</p><br/><p>\u201cRegister, register!\u201d The little merman raised her hand as he exclaimed toward the taller merman in excitement. \u201cI found a partner, and she agreed to marry me.\u201d</p><br/><p>The taller man froze, turning to take a look at Yao Si.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a misunderstanding.\u201d She wasn\u2019t a child trafficker!</p><br/><p>Yao Si never took his words seriously and was about to clarify the situation when the taller merman shouted in joy.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great! Your Highness, you\u2019re amazing, you managed to find a wife even before coming of age! You are indeed worthy to be our prince. I\u2019ll get the registration done right this moment. \u201d</p><br/><p><em>What?</em></p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Hey, hey, hey! You believed him just like that? Isn\u2019t he just a child? Shouldn\u2019t you be seeking his parent\u2019s approval first?</p><br/><p>\u201cWait a minute \u201d Yao Si pulled her hand out of his grip. \u201cYou misunderstood. I never agreed to marry him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you accept my wedding gift?\u201d The little merman turned to glance a her, a hint of displeasure evident in his soulless gaze.</p><br/><p>Yao Si\u2019s lips twitched. <em>You didn\u2019t speak the entire time so who would know that those random items were wedding gifts!</em></p><br/><p>\u201cYou have accepted the wedding gift.\u201d When the taller merman turned to her, his tone was regretful. \u201cThis is your fault miss. Marriage is considered an event of high importance to our aquatic people. Since you accepted the wedding gift, you shouldn\u2019t be causing any trouble.\u201d</p><br/><p>Who was the one causing trouble!</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is my first time in your planet and I really had no clue he was proposing!\u201d Yao Si sighed. She started to regret not reading through all of the notes Mu Xuan had prepared for her about the aquatic people. Lack of knowledge could indeed kill.</p><br/><p>She pushed the bead toward the youth. \u201cWhat if I return it to him? Besides, isn\u2019t he underage? I doubt he can get married!\u201d She didn\u2019t have such unique tastes.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry miss.\u201d The tall merman seemed to have grasped the situation, and his manner turned grave. \u201cFor our race, ten is the legal marrying age. Since His Highness is already twelve, his marriage can be registered. Come,come, you just have to press this for the system to capture your DNA. After that, both of you will be a legal couple recognized by the Alliance. Everything will be legalized and accepted!\u201d</p><br/><p>(\u256f\u2035\u25a1\u2032)\u256f\ufe35\u253b\u2501\u253b</p><br/><p><em>Legalized and accepted! Isn\u2019t your marrying age a little too much?</em></p><br/><p>\u201cNo\u2026 I don\u2019t even know him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFeelings can be nurtured,\u201d the tall merman insisted. \u201cBesides, His Highness is the most accomplished merman in his generation.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t about his credentials.\u201d <em>Aren\u2019t you too open about this? </em>\u201cI don\u2019t even know his name.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy name is Xinye!\u201d the little merman volunteered immediately while taking a peak at her. The scales on his neck started to flush as he added, \u201cYou can call me Little Ye and I\u2019ll call you wife.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Was it really good for such a young boy to know so much?</p><br/><p>\u201cLook, aren\u2019t we well acquainted now?\u201d the taller merman didn\u2019t seem bothered at all; instead, he inched the registration screen closer to her. \u201cCome now, press here and you\u2019ll be a bride of the aquatic people.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI really can\u2019t!\u201d Yao Si took a huge step back.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s all the ruckus about?\u201d A tall figure suddenly appeared. He had a white top that wasn\u2019t buttoned, exposing perfectly bronzed muscles that could rival those of a professional model, if only\u2026 he didn\u2019t have a fish\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Highness, what are you doing here?\u201d The employee turned over instantly.</p><br/><p>\u201cManager Carp, what\u2019s\u2026\u201d The merman glanced over lazily, his gaze stopping on Little Xinye. \u201cHey! Isn\u2019t this my worthless little brother? What are you doing here and not at school?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Highness!\u201d Manager Carp greeted politely. \u201cLet me explain, His Highness managed to cheat\u2026 <em>cough </em>\u2026 find a willing partner and is here to register his marriage.\u201d</p><br/><p>Was she hallucinating or did he say \u2018cheat\u2019?</p><br/><p>-_-|||</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat!\u201d The muscular prince was clearly startled by the news. \u201d How can that be? Isn\u2019t he just twelve. Who exactly is she?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si heaved a sigh of relief. She finally found someone who shared the same views on the age issue. Impatiently, she interrupted, \u201cErm\u2026 Your Highness\u2026 it\u2019s all a misunderstanding, I never intended to marry him.\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment the muscular merman settled his gaze on her, he seemed to be left in a trance, his entire being freezing, his pupils dilating in shock. His scales started to vibrate intensely. With a deep inhale, he stammered, \u201cYou-you-you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Er\u2026 Was she that frightening?</p><br/><p>Just Yao Si was about to continue, he dashed over, intruding into her bubble to grab her hand. \u201cPretty lady, I\u2019m Xijin. Nice to meet you! If you aren\u2019t willing to marry my little brother, why don\u2019t you\u2026 marry me instead?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>(\u256f\u2035\u25a1\u2032)\u256f\ufe35\u253b\u2501\u253b</p><br/><p><em>What the f*ck?</em></p><br/><p><em>You can even fool around with a marriage certificate?! </em></p><br/><p>\u201cI was the one who found her!\u201d Little merman Xiye started to panic. He dashed in to push Xijin out of the bubble. \u201cGet out! I brought her over so she\u2019s my wife.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour scales haven\u2019t even faded entirely so what would you know?\u201d Xijin blocked his advances effortlessly, turning to smile radiantly at Yao Si. \u201cPretty lady, marry me instead! I\u2019m of legal age as well as strong and healthy. I\u2019m a much better candidate when compared to that little boy. Besides, after I ascend the throne, you\u2019ll be the queen of the aquatic people.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d <em>Er, I prefer being an ancestor\u2026 Thank you very much! </em></p><br/><p>\u201cYou baddie, she already accepted my wedding gift so she\u2019s mine, mine!\u201d The little merman started to jump around anxiously.</p><br/><p>Xijin stuffed the pearl from her hands back into those of the little merman. \u201cYou can have your gift back. In the future, she will be your sister-in-law.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo!\u201d The little merman waved his arms, dropping the bead. \u201cShe isn\u2019t my sister-in-law, she\u2019s my wife. Mine!\u201d He spat another bubble. It wasn\u2019t like the previous two and shattered instantly, turning into multiple ice daggers that flew toward his brother.</p><br/><p>Xijin took a step back calmly, the water around him vibrating slightly, freezing the daggers in place.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Was violence the solution to their conflict? And how did she become that conflict\u2026</p><br/><p>This was the first time she had created trouble just by being a woman. It seemed\u2026 almost unbelievable.</p><br/><p>\u256e(\u256f\ufe4f\u2570\uff09\u256d</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss, it\u2019s getting dangerous here. Why don\u2019t we head over to the lounge ?\u201d Manager Carp suggested calmly with no intention to break up the two\u2019s fight.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBoth princes have been blessed with abilities so their fight will take about an hour or two. Don\u2019t worry about it!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh\u2026\u201d Was it really alright to just leave them? Was this how it worked here?</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is the lounge.\u201d Manager Carp stopped in front of a room. With one last look at the two fighting mermen, he sighed. \u201cEh, I guess with your beauty, their obsession is not a surprise.\u201d</p><br/><p><em>Beauty? Mine?</em></p><br/><p>Yao Si blushed. Manager Carp had on a serious and sincere expression\u2014he didn\u2019t seem like he was lying so she grabbed onto his hands.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour people have superb taste!\u201d</p><br/><p>After being a wallflower for so many years, she had finally found someone appreciative of her beauty. Hahahaha! She really wasn\u2019t that happy\u2026 Hahaha!</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t want to leave this place anymore!</p><br/><p>~(\u2267\u25bd\u2266)/~</p></div>\n</div>"}

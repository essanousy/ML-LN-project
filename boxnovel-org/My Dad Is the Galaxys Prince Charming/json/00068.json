Mu Xuan had been occupied the entire time, barely returning to the house. However, every single time the thought of going out crossed Yao Si\u2019s mind, he would immediately appear to stuff her back in place, even forbidding her to attend school.</p><br/><p>With a parent that helped his child play truant, Yao Si was thoroughly defeated.</p><br/><p>What\u2019s remarkable was that after the destruction of Euphoria\u2019s research base, the organization seemed to have vanished into thin air. Despite all the efforts of the Alliance and the Red Planet, they weren\u2019t able to trace anything. Even the bases they infiltrated weren\u2019t able to provide them with any clue.</p><br/><p>Yao Si grew increasingly worried. Had the video she sent out from the research base pushed the organization into a defence mode?</p><br/><p>\u201cDefinitely not!\u201d Mu Xuan refuted. \u201cThe video you sent out was broadcast through a separate channel. Due to the fields around the planet, it would take at least ten days for them to receive it. The bloodlings had only headed to the planet after the danger had been eliminated.</p><br/><p>This meant that they would first receive information that their base had been exposed to the bloodlings before receiving her video.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou did the right thing!\u201d</p><br/><p>Mu Xuan reached out to caress her head. Even if her identity as a fifth-generation was exposed, it was for the best. Besides, with her volatile ability, she would be useless in certain circumstances, but no one knew that! With the identity of a fifth-generation bloodling and his cub, she would be of important status, which would form protective barrier around her.</p><br/><p>After all, even if she was ambitious, the knowledge that she was his cub and so they shared a unique connection would deter enemies from preying on her. Hence, anonymity was no good. She should be advertised publicly instead. \u201cRather than engaging in underground protection, why not thoroughly expose you under the sun.\u201d</p><br/><p>Thoroughly? <em>Er\u2026 what do you mean?</em></p><br/><p>Yao Si remained confused for a long time. Only after three months did she finally gain enlightenment. While she was out kite flying, she chanced upon the main screen in the heart of the Bloodling capital, where a video of her was playing on repeat.</p><br/><p>\u201cRemember my words, they\u2019re no warning or threat, we <em>are </em> coming!\u201d</p><br/><p>What kind of experience is spotting yourself on such a screen? Yao Si had no idea, but at this moment, she had an urge to blind her eyes.</p><br/><p>How shameful! How embarrassing!</p><br/><p>What was the video doing here? Was this what Mu Xuan had meant by putting everything under the sun? But\u2026 isn\u2019t this too much?! Most importantly\u2026 why just that portion? She had definitely never sprouted such a cringe-worthy sentence before! However, the entire street of bloodlings seemed to have been touched.</p><br/><p>\u201cSuch charisma\u2026 It\u2019s Her Highness indeed!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, so charismatic! Ahahah\u2026 Marry me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes yes! I never knew Her Highness had such vigor!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph, who cares about the organization, with Her Highness around, they\u2019re just paper tigers!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s how the bloodlings do it!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHer Highness is right! All against them!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si froze, speechless. Her heart shattered. Somehow, she had transformed from a weakling into a superwoman. <em>My image is in tatters now! I\u2019m a girl, a girl! How am I supposed to get married now? </em></p><br/><p>The video was all over the streets, and even the first thing that popped up once one opened their optical computer. Yao Si could already imagine everyone in the entire Galaxy watching her video.</p><br/><p><em>What a nightmare\u2026</em></p><br/><p>She pushed her cap farther down, to the point that it covered all her face. <em>You can\u2019t see me, I\u2019m invisible\u2026</em></p>\n</div>"}

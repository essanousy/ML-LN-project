What exactly was the bloodline bond? She had never felt it before. \u201cCan you tell me?\u201d</p><br/><p>She tugged onto his hands, her face filled with solemn sincerity. At that moment, a certain someone\u2019s entire neck flushed.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Did his young cub have any idea what she was asking? Bloodlings\u2019 emotions were closely linked to their bloodline, and this question to a bloodling was akin to asking\u2026 asking if he loved her. As a \u2018dog\u2019 that had been single for millions of years and no dating background, Mu Xuan was momentarily flustered. He had no clue how to handle such a suggestive and intimate question\u2026 hence\u2026 he escaped.</p><br/><p>\u201cCough. You\u2019ll know when you\u2019re no longer a young cub.\u201d He stood up abruptly, and ignoring the thoroughly flushed neck area, he maintained his usual cold demeanor. \u201cI\u2019m a little tired, I\u2019ll go rest now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?\u201d Yao Si stilled. \u201cMu Xuan\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe can talk tomorrow.\u201d He turned, taking steady steps, not once exposing his inner feelings, except that\u2026 the direction was wrong.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s to the toilet\u2026\u201d Wasn\u2019t he going to rest?</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d He stopped, immediately changing his direction.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my room.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d He changed the direction once more.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the living room\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d He changed once more.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you heading toward the main door?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d He turned once again.</p><br/><p>After trying all the directions possible, he finally found the correct door.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait a minute, Mu Xuan, you haven\u2019t\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Mu Xuan shut his door in a hurry.</p><br/><p>Yao Si was left speechless. You haven\u2019t made lunch yet!</p><br/><p>(\u2299_\u2299)</p><br/><p>Was she\u2026 going to go hungry today? I want my daughter treatment back!</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>Yao Si was confused. She wasn\u2019t sure how she was going to face Mu Xuan again sine she wasn\u2019t clear of her own emotions. Even though she didn\u2019t feel a strong repulsion, she couldn\u2019t just accept it with ease and just walk out of the daughter role. Her mind was in a mess, and for the first time, she wasn\u2019t sure how to face the situation.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, this was the first time in two years she had gone hungry. She flipped back and forth as she wrecked her brain, but in the end, all she felt was hunger!</p><br/><p>o(&gt;\ufe4f&lt;&gt;</p><br/><p>How she wished she could go back to being a baby\u2026 Back then, she at could still have duck blood curd.</p><br/><p>After prepping herself for a few days, she was prepared to have a good talk with a certain someone. But that could wait till after her meal! At that moment, she realized something amiss with Mu Xuan\u2014he suddenly seemed extremely busy, leaving before she woke up and only coming back late into the night. Even though he would bump into her once in a while, he would only leave a few quick words before rushing off.</p><br/><p>Even when she forcefully held onto him, he would find an excuse to leave. At Luo Ying\u2019s wedding day, he remained emotionless the entire time. In the past, he would always have his eyes on her, but now, he looked everywhere except at her.</p><br/><p>Even though he never forgot to feed her again and there wasn\u2019t much difference in his tone and expressions, there still seemed to be something amiss. His neck would often flush a deep shade of red.</p><br/><p>What was wrong?</p><br/><p>Initially, she thought that he had eaten something he was allergic to, but then she noticed that the flush only came when he spoke to her.</p><br/><p>Did\u2026 it mean that he was only allergic to her? She thought through their meals for the past few days, and there didn\u2019t seem to be anything out of the ordinary there.</p><br/><p>\u201cMu\u2014\u201d</p><br/><p>Just as she was about to clarify, Mu Xuan took a step back, pushing the hands that had made their way to his neck. He gripped his hands into tight fists before heading to the door in a hurry. \u201cI have to go.\u201d</p><br/><p>Before he could reach the door, though, someone came running in.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Highness, I found\u2026\u201d Bai Yi rushed in anxiously, but just as he was about to continue, he raised his head and saw Mu Xuan. He stilled, so startled he almost fell forward. Trembling, he greeted, \u201cYo-yo-your Majesty.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si was at a loss. Since Nephew Gu was a newlywed, she could only investigate the Yuan Han matter with Bai Yi. He would drop by often to update her on the investigation progress. In the past, Mu Xuan would leave the house very early thus he had never bumped into him.</p><br/><p>\u201cMmh.\u201d Mu Xuan nodded, his brows furrowed and his displeasure apparent. Not rushing off anymore, he blocked the door. \u201cWhy are you here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWh-why am I here?\u201d The most respected royalty of his race had just asked Bai Yi a question, and he couldn\u2019t wrap his head around it. His mind went blank!</p><br/><p>\u201cBai Yi, is there any progress?\u201d Yao Si remembered the matter at hand and headed to the door.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh?!\u201d Bai Yi frozen, then snapped back to his senses. \u201cYes, yes, yes, Your Highness, I chanced upon something, at-at-at\u2026\u201d His expression turned panicky, as though he had trouble explaining himself. \u201cAnyways, Your Highness, come along and you\u2019ll understand.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si\u2019s heart clenched. \u201cAlright, let\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><br/><p>Just as she was about to leave, Mu Xuan pulled her back violently. \u201cWe\u2019ll go together.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh?\u201d Yao Si was confused. \u201cWeren\u2019t you on your way out?\u201d Aren\u2019t you going to continue hiding from me?</p><br/><p>\u201cYour matters are more important!\u201d he justified righteously. What a joke! How could he allow his cub to go out with another man by herself. All the times something bad had happened, it was because of this youth\u2019s bad influence. He turned to Bai Yi. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, yes!\u201d Bai Yi straightened, leading the way enthusiastically as though he was the general of an army.</p><br/><p>Mu Xuan took large steps after him. When they reached the road side, a thought struck him. He gingerly bumped Yao Si\u2019s hand before taking it into his own. Of course I have to hold my cub\u2019s tiny hand, mmh, this is normal.</p><br/><p>Yao Si glanced at the person beside her who had grabbed onto her hand and was walking at the speed of light. Just one look, and she could see the red patch inching up his neck toward his face.</p><br/><p>Was he\u2026 showing allergies again?</p><br/><p>What exactly did he eat?</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>Bai Yi lived on the Red Planet, and in less than twenty minutes, they reached his place. In impatience, he lost his manners, bringing both of them to the basement.</p><br/><p>The moment they entered it, Yao Si jumped at the array of different electronics. The entire room was lit up with multiple screens, and even the ground was brightly lit. There wasn\u2019t a single dark area anywhere.</p><br/><p>The place seemed like a mini Galactic net, misleading Yao Si into believing that she had entered it.</p><br/><p>\u201cI never knew you were such a tech savvy person,\u201d Yao Si marveled as she glanced around the room, taking in the sea of numbers.</p><br/><p>\u201cI got into it recently.\u201d Bai Yi laughed bashfully. \u201cYour Highness, you must know that my ability\u2026 Doesn\u2019t hold much power, so I spent a lot of my time in the Galactic net, investing various data.</p><br/><p>This was a nice way of saying he was a hacker. It was unexpected indeed! He actually possessed other abilities aside from being a nag.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh right, Your Highness, Your Highness!\u201d Bai Yi suddenly remembered the matter at hand. He walked to the middle of the room and began working, his hands flying about as if they were dancing. Moments after, all the data disappeared, leaving only a gigantic screen with endless columns of red figures. \u201cIt\u2019s like this\u2026 a few days ago, I chanced upon this space data and discovered an anomaly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSpace data?\u201d Yao Si stilled. Space could actually be represented by data? She glanced at the jumping numbers in curiosity. Eh\u2026 she was clueless.</p><br/><p>\u256e(\u256f\ufe4f\u2570\uff09\u256d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, when I saw him, he was just a data that inflated abruptly before quickly deflating.\u201d Bai Yi\u2019s expression took on an unfamiliar seriousness. \u201cI thought that someone nearby was using space storage facilities, but then I realized that the change in figures was just a ploy, it was actually due to the appearance of a space distortion.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh\u2026\u201d Yao Si nodded. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d She couldn\u2019t understand such technical terms.</p><br/><p>\u201cI mean,\u201d\u2014Bai Yi grew increasingly more agitated\u2014\u201dan ordinary space storage is not able to cause such a scenario. The appearance of a space distortion could only be due to\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTeleportation!\u201d Mu Xuan said.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat right!\u201d Bai Yi\u2019s eyes lit up, filled with excitement of being understood. \u201cThat isn\u2019t all, though, I also found that the data wasn\u2019t nearby, but from planet T33!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cT33?\u201d Clueless Yao Si leaned over in confusion.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a planet near our academy,\u201d Bai Yi supplemented.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh!\u201d I see. \u201cGo on.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Planet T33 is an advanced planet, so the whole planet envelops a Galactic doorway, which means there is no need to utilize teleportation.\u201d Bai Yi\u2019s face turned increasingly more grim while keeping the hint of agitation. \u201cI chased after the signal and realized that the position was within the vicinity of our academy. For a period of time, there was only one person utilizing this teleportation.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si stilled, then her eyes widened, and the answer slipped out. \u201cYuan Han!\u201d</p><br/><p>Alright Bai Yi, even though you look clueless normally, you can do big things with just a little hard work. \u201cYou found that b*tch!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMmh, you can say that!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere, where? Which planet is he on? Is it far?\u201d</p><br/><p>He stilled, his face frozen, and even Mu Xuan sighed.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Did she ask a stupid question?</p><br/><p>\u201cSisi.\u201d Mu Xuan tightened his grip on her hand and explained, \u201cSince he found the data with the source originating from T33 here, the end point would\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si fell into a short daze before processing what he said!</p><br/><p>\u201cYou mean to say\u2026 that he\u2019s on the red planet?!\u201d</p><br/><p>F*ck, how can that be? He voluntarily came into the lion\u2019s den. Wasn\u2019t that too bold?</p><br/><p>\u201cDoes he really think that the most dangerous place is actually the safest?\u201d But for the past few days, bloodlings and the Alliance were indeed not able to find him.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe exact position?\u201d With such a terror on the Red Planet, it was indeed worrying. Besides, that guy wasn\u2019t sane and seemed to be carrying a special virus. \u201cBai Yi, did you find it?\u201d</p><br/><p>He stilled slightly, awkwardness flashing onto his face. \u201cThis\u2026 I went to get you the moment I tracked the source, so I didn\u2019t have the time to trace the trail. I\u2019ll do it this instance!\u201d</p><br/><p>He turned back to the screen, and the room flashed with light and data points.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

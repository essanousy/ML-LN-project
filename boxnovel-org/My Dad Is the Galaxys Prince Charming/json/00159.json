Galactic beasts were never considered a threat due to their distance from civilization. No one thus expected their nests to be almost within their backyards, which sent everyone on high alert. Among the many harvesting farms, there was a particular one named Mother Planet.</p><br/><p>Within it were beasts that could easily swallow an entire planet! Even though they would be sent to the borders after being fully harvested, no one knew when the bloodling would stop transporting them out.</p><br/><p>If the beasts were to appear in the Galaxy where the various races resided\u2026 it would be a catastrophe.</p><br/><p>The situation caused a state of hysteria with everyone living on the edge, but despite the situation, the main culprit was nowhere to be found. The bloodlings mobilized almost all their troops to find the first generation bloodling, but it came down to nothing.</p><br/><p>Even Mu Xuan was starting to get frustrated as he worked endlessly through the night. His face never brightened and seemed to be constantly on the brink of an eruption.</p><br/><p>Yao Si was certain that the beasts were sent to the borders for a reason. <em>There will probably be clues there.</em></p><br/><p>\u201cMu Xuan.\u201d Yao Si felt a need to remind him about it. \u201cI want to\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo!\u201d he objected before she could even ask anything.</p><br/><p>Yao Si stilled. \u201cI haven\u2019t even started my question?!\u201d</p><br/><p>(\u30fe????)</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to. I know what you\u2019re going to ask, and I\u2019m not going to allow it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d <em>Hey, what do you even know?</em></p><br/><p>\u201cSisi.\u201d He spoke with a solemn expression. \u201cIt\u2019s dangerous outside. You have to be within my sight for me to feel at ease. Before everything is settled, you are not allowed to go anywhere.\u201d</p><br/><p>Alright, she didn\u2019t have to go.</p><br/><p>\u201cMu Xuan, I want\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEven thinking about it is forbidden!\u201d His face grew stiff, his grip on her tightening. \u201cSisi, you\u2019re still young. There are some things you don\u2019t understand. Be good now, that person isn\u2019t nice at all.\u201d</p><br/><p><em>F*ck, stop treating me as a child!</em></p><br/><p>\u201cIf I can\u2019t go, then you can!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, if I go, what about you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat can happen when I\u2019m here on the Red Planet?\u201d</p><br/><p>His face fell. He stared at her so deeply, he seemed to be able to see her very soul. \u201cSisi, I feel uneasy if you leave me but for a second.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Yao Si\u2019s heart shook, her face burning. Hurriedly, she turned her face away. F*ck, why was her heart beating so fast? Was he teasing her? He had to have been, right? When did he get so skilled at it? Wasn\u2019t he going for the pure, innocent lover approach?</p><br/><p>\u201cAhem, then\u2026 alright! We will both not go.\u201d <em>Steady there, I\u2019m experienced. </em>\u201cThis isn\u2019t that urgent, so you can just get one of the elders to go.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Mu Xuan\u2019s face darkened. He seemed on the verge of explosion as he bolted upwards abruptly.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Yao Si was startled. This was the first time he had reacted with such aggression. He was never a parent that disregarded his cub\u2019s opinion. \u201cWait a minute, what exactly did you think I was going to say?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRegardless of what you say, I won\u2019t allow it.\u201d His face sank before he added resolutely, \u201cI can agree to anything else but this! I will definitely not agree to let in that aves to meet you. No, not just here, I will not allow it anywhere else in the Galaxy as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Eh? Aves? Lian Yu?! When did she mention anything about her coming to the Red Planet?</p><br/><p>Once he started, he became increasingly agitated. From a person that barely spoke ten words a day, he was now a firecracker that had gone off, nagging endlessly as he paced about the room.</p><br/><p>\u201cSisi, you have to set your sights further. She is an aves and you are a bloodling. There aren\u2019t genuine feelings between different races, but it\u2019s easy for you to get misled due to your lack of knowledge.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSisi, the aves aren\u2019t a benevolent race. Thunder Sylvani King from the previous generation was blessed with two heavenly seeds which is considered a miracle for the royal family whose only had one heir before. It was also an opportunity for them to flourish; however, one of the heavenly seeds ended up marrying the aves queen which ended their dreams of flourishing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSisi, you are my only cub and she\u2019s decided to direct her intentions onto you, but since you are still young, you can\u2019t see her ill intentions.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSisi, I\u2019ve restricted the movement of all aves that want to come to the Red Planet, but she still managed to intrude several times. This shows just how cunning these aves can be.\u201d He frowned, his jaw tightening. \u201cHeh, I guess restricting their entrance isn\u2019t enough. I\u2019ll have to lock down the entire Galaxy.\u201d The more he spoke, the more assured he became. Turning on his optical computer, he started to go through with his plans.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si was left speechless, before suddenly processing the situation.</p><br/><p>All this while, his constipated face and the endless buzz wasn\u2019t because of the first generation bloodling on the Heavenly Planet\u2026 but rather because of trying to keep Lian Yu from finding her on the Red Planet?</p><br/><p>(?\u0414?)\u30ce</p><br/><p><em>Where\u2019s your bloodling ruler pride?!</em></p><br/><p>\u201cMu-Mu Xuan\u2026\u201d Her brain was too small, and she needed time to process such a revelation.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, the Galaxy too wide, which makes it susceptible to intrusion. To ensure complete safety\u2026 I guess a war is necessary!\u201d He found the number for all the elders.</p><br/><p>He was about to make the order when Yao Si grabbed his hands to stop him.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><br/><p>She finally found the source to the bloodlings\u2019 horrible habit of calling for war whenever there were disputes.</p><br/><p>Now she had finally gotten the explanation for his moodiness and sunken face in the past few days. It had seemed as though he was on his period the entire month. And she had blamed everything on the first generation bloodling.</p><br/><p>But instead it was because of\u2026 Lian Yu?</p><br/><p>He\u2026 had been jealous all that while?!</p><br/><p>(\uffe3\u25a1\uffe3;)</p><br/><p>For the past few weeks, he had been on the verge of an eruption, and all that was because of Lian Yu?!</p><br/><p>The truth was too unexpected, but\u2026 it seemed kind of cute?</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, this matter has to be resolved as soon as possible.\u201d Mu Xuan was oblivious to Yao Si\u2019s internal shock. He pushed her hands aside and pressed firmly onto the call button.</p><br/><p>\u201cMu Xuan!\u201d <em>Your persona will be ruined if you continue with this fit!</em></p><br/><p>With a racial war at stake, Yao Si started to panic. She reached forward to grab his face and pressing her lips against his.</p><br/><p>Mu Xuan froze, paralyzed. She then sensed his tension going out, a red slush tainting his flawlessly white skin.</p><br/><p>The moment he seemed to have calmed down, she lifted her fingers to explain everything word by word.</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst, I do not like Lian Yu. We aren\u2019t even close enough to be considered friends, and this has nothing to do with her being an aves.</p><br/><p>\u201cSecond, I am straight, so I would definitely go for a guy.</p><br/><p>\u201cThird, I only like you. Understood?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Mu Xuan remained frozen, unmoving.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, say something!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCould you react?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck, why is your nose bleeding? It\u2019s just a kiss!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

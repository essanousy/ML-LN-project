So were they perhaps right? But everything seemed so unreal. After being a weakling for such a long time, she couldn\u2019t get used to the sudden change in her identity. Besides, she couldn\u2019t remember anything from before she was an earthling.</p><br/><p>She couldn\u2019t seem to fill up the gaps, so she decided to temporarily toss the problem aside.</p><br/><p>\u201cEnough, enough, enough!\u201d She raised her palms to stop Lin Long and Qu Zhe from continuing. She pointed toward the black mess outside/ \u201cLet\u2019s put this queen discussion aside for the time being. How are we going to deal with that bunch out there? We can\u2019t just leave them in this universe!\u201d</p><br/><p>They were a huge crowd of madmen that resorted to violence at the slightest disagreement. Even though most of them had their abilities obliterated by her, who knew what they could come up with. After all, they had traveled through their universe just to find their contractors and were high-risk individuals. If she left them to their means, there was a possibility they would destroy the whole Galaxy.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey won\u2019t go back.\u201d Qu Zhe shook his head firmly. \u201cYour Majesty, we\u2019ve been looking for you for such a long time. Now that we have found you, you are no longer just a queen, but also the only option when seeking death for all those without a contractor.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck that!\u201d <em>F*ck you, maniacs! Are you really in such a rush to die? Even if you were, couldn\u2019t you seek it elsewhere? </em>\u201cDidn\u2019t you say it was a legend? I might not be able to grant them death!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPreviously I assumed it was a legend as well\u2026\u201d Qu Zhe paused, then glanced at Li Zheng intensely.</p><br/><p>In response, Li Zheng started to tremble in fear, covering his mouth firmly while trying to force the bile down his throat as he dashed behind Yao Si for shelter. He crouched low behind her, struggling to shrink behind her 156cm height. Qu Zhe appeared wounded by his actions. \u201cBut now\u2026 I\u2019m sure that you can grant us with an end.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure as well!\u201d Lin Long added enthusiastically.</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe\u2026\u201d <em>Hey, how could you guys have been affected by those madmen?</em></p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true, Your Majesty!\u201d Lin Long explained seriously. \u201cYour Majesty, haven\u2019t you realized? All the pure breeds around you have found their contractors.\u201d</p><br/><p><em>Eh?!</em></p><br/><p>The pure breeds around her, weren\u2019t they Lin Long and Qu\u2026</p><br/><p>F*ck! Could it be true? Was that what granting death meant?</p><br/><p>She finally understood the gaze exchanged by Li Zheng and Qu Zhe.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs the queen perhaps Yue Lao <sup>1</sup> ?!\u201d</p><br/><p>(\u256f\u2035\u25a1\u2032)\u256f\ufe35\u253b\u2501\u253b</p><br/><p><em>Whoever wants this throne can have it! </em></p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>A full-fledged war was prevented and instead a bunch of overaged singles came to the Red Planet. Yao Si who was forced into the Yue Lao role only had one response: F*ck! Why did she have to bother with that bunch of crazy single dogs?</p><br/><p>In order to deal with the large crowd of \u2018single dogs\u2019 that stayed around her house, the Red Planet held an emergency meeting. Fortunately, the Galaxy was filled with a diverse mix of different races, providing the elders with tons of experience on how to manage disputes among races. However, due to the unique nature of these ancestors, the elders spent almost a whole week before coming up with a preliminary proposal.</p><br/><p>After both Yao Si and Mu Xuan read through it, the \u2018Leaving Singlehood Pact\u2019 was finalized.</p><br/><p>Yes, that was what it was called! The motive of the pure breeds was only one, and it was to find their contractor. If it wasn\u2019t for the violent and maddening declaration of war against their universe, they wouldn\u2019t have had to waste so much effort in resisting.</p><br/><p>Couldn\u2019t they have been like Lin Long, coming and leaving silently?! Was there a need to stir up such a big fuss? Since they went so far, they deserved to be punished.</p><br/><p>The pact consisted of only three conditions:</p><br/><p>First, all pure breeds from the other universe (also known as: pure breeds) are allowed to apply for access to the Red Planet through legal channels. Once the application has been approved, the immigration permit pass can be obtained.</p><br/><p>A temporary bloodling identity card can be applied simultaneously for them to become Red Planet\u2019s bloodlings. In order to prevent chaos within the Red Planet, their generation number would follow the current generation and be 765th.</p><br/><p>Second, pure breeds were to have their abilities sealed by the respected queen of the bloodlings: Yao Si (also, queen of the pure breeds) before they pass through immigration. After it happens, pure breeds are prohibited from participating in activities that may provoke other races.</p><br/><p>They are not allowed to expose their pure breed identity unless in critical situation. Pure breeds are to abide by all the laws of the Red Planet and are prohibited from any activities that would disrupt the harmony among races or the Galaxy\u2019s peace. Anyone caught breaking the rules would be restricted entry permanently.</p><br/><p>Third, the immigration application lasts for ten years. Once expired, extension is allowed in the Red Planet.</p><br/><p>These three conditions were the best solution to the current situation, providing the pure breeds with an opportunity to search for their contractors while controlling their maniacal mentality. The gist of the rules was: Don\u2019t cause trouble, don\u2019t cause trouble, don\u2019t cause trouble!</p><br/><p>But the sealing of their abilities was a little hard. They were a bunch in love with violence, so for them to lose their ability and be relegated to normal beings seemed\u2026 like an almost impossible task!</p><br/><p>\u25cb|\uffe3|_</p><br/><p>Unexpectedly, once the three conditions came out, the crowd which previously insisted on taking over the whole universe agreed without any objections. Everyone nodded obligingly, not one having a second opinion. They even asked when the queen was going to seal their abilities.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Majesty, what should we do? We will listen to all your demands.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Majesty, when you make your attack, would you prefer if I fall on my side, my back, or on my stomach? I\u2019ll be prepared.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Majesty, do those who seal their abilities first have a priority in finding their contractor? Why don\u2019t you seal mine first?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Majesty, I love peace, really! Look at my\u2026 muscles, they are small than those of the others, so could you introduce me to a contractor first?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Majesty\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p><em>Get lost! I\u2019m not Yue Lao! </em></p><br/><p>(#\u2035\u2032)</p><br/><p>Yao Si spent a whole week sealing the pure breeds\u2019 abilities to the normal bloodling level. Ever since the battle, she could control that power and her mental strength with ease.</p><br/><p>Her ability was still really odd though. At times it could be everything while at other times it wasn\u2019t anything, like\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cA mixture of energy,\u201d Mu Xuan blurted out.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cI just found the term rather fitting.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si didn\u2019t pay much attention as she continued to seal the pure breeds\u2019 abilities. While doing so, she realized that those pure breeds who had their abilities obliterated weren\u2019t completely without any power, it was just recovering extremely slowly and would probably take a few hundred years to return to normal. Still, she used the bloodling suppression as an additional seal.</p><br/><p>After all their abilities had been sealed, Yao Si left the follow up things to Elders Council since they were more proficient in such tasks.</p><br/><p>For a time, the crammed mess in front of the Majestic Palace was gone. Yao Si could feel her energy being on the low, and together with Mu Xuan, she lay on the sofa motionlessly, trying to recuperate.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m tired\u2026\u201d She finally understood the pains of racial issues.</p><br/><p>\u201cYaoyao.\u201d Mu Xuan pulled her into his embrace before passing her a piping hot bowl from out of nowhere. \u201cCome on, have some blood curd for nourishment.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si downed the entire bowl instantly, and as expected, Mu Xuan had the best culinary skills. She licked her lips and placed the bowl down before turning to hug him. She lifted her head to glance at Mu Xuan who had been much busier than her, and a warm, fuzzy feeling spread through her. It was a serenity she had never experienced before.</p><br/><p>\u201cMu Xuan\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMmh?\u201d He reached his hand out to wipe soup from the corner of her lips, and his face filled her vision.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid I\u2026 really convert you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Mu Xuan stilled before bending down to place a light kiss on her lips. \u201cWhy do you say so?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause I had a dream\u2026\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

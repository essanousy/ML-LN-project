Due to the DNA inspection incident, he was brutally cheated by Yan Xuan. At that time, other than some Galactic currency, he seemed to have mentioned an ore planet, but she didn\u2019t understand the situation and had never expected that would really receive a whole planet.</p><br/><p>Er\u2026 she suddenly had an impulse to find out what else she had received\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cMmh.\u201d Mu Xuan nodded, not the least bit alarmed by her declaration as though the planet was just another lollipop she had acquired. With a step forward, he pulled her behind him before glaring at the bests with a chilling gaze. \u201cThis means that you\u2026 intend to take my cub\u2019s planet?\u201d</p><br/><p>Even though there wasn\u2019t a change in his tone, his cold demeanor sent a chill down everyone\u2019s spine, and a thick silence fell over them.</p><br/><p>After half a minute\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cShe-she\u2019s the boss of the Ore Planet!\u201d Tiger-head snapped out of his shock. With a wave of his hand, all the guns were directed toward her. \u201cHurry and hand over the rights to the planet or I\u2019ll have to kill all of you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d <em>Mmh, this is indeed a courageous tiger-head.</em></p><br/><p>She shifted her head to the side\u2026 she was probably not needed.</p><br/><p>As expected, in less than two seconds, the threatening crowd of bests collapsed onto the ground, whining in pain. But it was considered mild since none of the injuries were fatal.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you alright?\u201d Yao Si walked over to Supervisor Yuan who was selling her out just a second ago. In that short second, his entire demeanor had changed.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh?!\u201d Supervisor Yuan stilled. Was he alright? What had just happened? Who was he? Where was he? The events were too shocking; he couldn\u2019t seem to process the situation.</p><br/><p>Lu Chen who had witnessed Mu Xuan\u2019s prowess before regained his calm faster. \u201cOh right, where are the others? Where are they now?\u201d There were at least a few hundred employees in each district.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey\u2026 Oh right, they are locked up on the second floor of the office.\u201d Supervisor Yuan paused, turning to glance worryingly at the bunch of people whining on the ground</p><br/><p>Yao Si understood his worry and turned to glance at Mu Xuan.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey won\u2019t be able to escape.\u201d He nodded, unleashing his mental strength once more. The group stopped tumbling abruptly as though suppressed.</p><br/><p>There was indeed a few hundred employees trapped on the second floor, and the majority of them were Yao with a sizeable number of bests as well. In contrast to the tiger-head and lion-head bests, the ones in captivity were a more docile bunch which consisted of cat-ears, bunny-tails, and dog-noses.</p><br/><p>After communicating, they found out that it was a kidnapping and blackmail. The poor employee treatment mentioned by tiger-head was all fabricated and completely untrue. Lu Enterprise had always been among the top ten companies within the Galaxy and thus would never allow employee dissatisfaction to mar their exemplary records.</p><br/><p>Due to the distance and relative lack of civilization on the Ore Planet, the wages here were a few times higher than in other industries. The reason Lu Family decided to employ the beasts who were notorious for their poor reputation was due to their physique and to boost the company\u2019s image. It served as an advertisement for the company\u2019s philanthropic and equal ways, so there was even less reason for them to ill-treat their employees.</p><br/><p>It had always been a harmonious situation that yielded benefit to both parties until the appearance of a radical claiming that the Lu Enterprise were treating beasts as slaves and trying to obliterate their pride. Gradually, his words started to influence the other workers, and he gained a following. Not all the beasts signed up, but since there were less of them, no one dared to stand up against the rebels.</p><br/><p>Like that, the matter blew out of proportion.</p><br/><p>The rebels didn\u2019t just hack into the security system, causing the loss of contact with the other planets, but also took hostage all of the employees in the various districts. Before the three of them had entered the planet, they were plotting on ways to take over the entire planet.</p><br/><p>That was\u2026 until they hit a brick wall!</p><br/><p>\u201cBoss, I just informed the galactic police; they\u2019ll be here soon.\u201d Supervisor Yuan heaved a sigh of relief, his expression serious. \u201cThe other employees will be released once the police arrives.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si nodded. It would be better for the police to handle the matter since there was a sizeable number of districts on the planet. \u201cOh right, who is the radical you spoke of? Which district is he from?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe is from District 3.\u201d Supervisor Yuan said. \u201cHe\u2019s called Feng Xiao. I heard that he can be quite dangerous with his S level physique and an ability! But no worries, District 3 is a distance away, so he probably doesn\u2019t know about the situation here and won\u2019t pose any threat\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Before he could finish his sentence, a sudden buzz could be heard. Their surroundings lit up in red as a screen popped out before them.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you the boss of the Ore Planet?\u201d a person asked from the screen. \u201cYou are finally here. Nice to meet you, I\u2019m Feng Xiao!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p><em>Didn\u2019t you say he wouldn\u2019t pose a threat?</em></p><br/><p><em>Is eating their words a unique custom of the Yao? </em></p><br/><p>\u256e(\u256f\ufe4f\u2570\uff09\u256d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou dare touch my man? I must say, you sure have guts!\u201d Feng Xiao scoffed. When compared to the tiger-head and lion-head, he had more human features. He only had two large fin-like ears and a pair of horns at the top of his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you think it\u2019s over just because you got back one district? I have retracted your call for help. No one will come to save you.\u201d</p><br/><p>He then broke into a fit of chilling laughter. \u201cI had hoped for a peaceful handover, but your lack of cooperation is making that difficult. But it\u2019s alright, everything will be fine after I kill you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He suddenly pointed toward Yao Si, his face clouding with a sinister murderous intent. Yao Si remained unaffected, but Mu Xuan frowned deeply.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think you\u2019ll be fine hiding in District 9. This whole planet is mine. In less than three days, I will head over personally to get you. By then\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cForget it!\u201d Mu Xuan could no longer suppress himself. He waved his hand and opened a space portal from which he forcefully pulled something out.</p><br/><p>With a loud thud, Feng Xiao who had been in District 3 fell face first on the ground in front of the group\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Yao Si.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Yuan Chen.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Supervisor Yuan.</p><br/><p>Those who want to flaunt\u2026 shall all perish!</p><br/><p>\u256e(\u256f\u25bd\u2570)\u256d</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p></div>\n</div>"}

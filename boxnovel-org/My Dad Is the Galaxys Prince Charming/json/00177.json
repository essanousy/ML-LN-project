Judging from their reactions though, the person in front of her was probably telling the truth and her body had been swapped with Lin Long\u2019s.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow do I know?\u201d She saw herself roll her eyes. \u201cI have been like this ever since I woke up.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow can we change back our bodies?\u201d Yao Si was starting to feel uneasy. She had never expected to turn into a man and definitely not Long Ergou.</p><br/><p>Silence fell upon them; it was obviously the first time they had experienced such a situation.</p><br/><p>\u201cSisi.\u201d Mu Xuan frowned, and his voice was grave. \u201cTell me what exactly happened? Don\u2019t skip on anything.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat could have happen? We were attacked by the force field in the last checkpoint, and Lin Long insisted on using his fire ability to forcefully break through the barrier. In the end, the force field swallowed and sent it back. Under that critical situation, I\u2014\u201d Yao Si stopped midway through her speech. Her eyes went wide when a sudden possibility struck her. \u201cMy ability!\u201d</p><br/><p>F*ck, could the situation be because of her absurd ability?</p><br/><p>Back when she had activated it, Lin Long had been using a fire ability, so she had assumed that with her counter ability, a water ability would appear. However, she had forgotten that he had a full-series ability which meant that she was supposed to have no reaction at all.</p><br/><p>Her current predicament\u2026 was it perhaps caused by her ability countering the force field and not because of Lin Long?</p><br/><p>Since it had been a revolving portal, could the counter ability be\u2026 reincarnation?! Returning her back to her human state?!</p><br/><p><em>F*ck! This is ridiculous!</em></p><br/><p>(\u256f\u2035\u25a1\u2032)\u256f\ufe35\u253b\u2501\u253b</p><br/><p>Before she fainted, the fire dragon in front of her had turned into a ball of flame. At that time, Lin Long should have been the only one facing the fireball, which meant that their bodies had already swapped by then.</p><br/><p>Everything\u2026 was really caused by her ability!</p><br/><p>Mu Xuan seemed to have come to the same conclusion, and he turned to face Lin Long. \u201cDo you have an ability now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Lin Long took a cautious step back. \u201cYou still want to fight? Let me tell you, don\u2019t assume I\u2019m afraid of you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhich means you don\u2019t.\u201d Mu Xuan ignored him, and turned toward the person at his side. \u201cSisi?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si understood his question and took a moment to sense within herself. Even though her body was different, it was still empty without the hint of any ability. She shook her head.</p><br/><p>Mu Xuan heaved a sigh of relief. Their abilities seemed to have swapped together with their consciousness, so Lin Long still had a full-series ability and Yao Si still had that absurd ability of hers.</p><br/><p>Since their abilities hadn\u2019t changed and they were in their current predicament because of her ability, if they were to return to the original location and activate it once more, there was a possibility they could return to normal.</p><br/><p>\u201cBai Yi, where\u2019s the last checkpoint you guys went to?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Yi tapped open the map and pointed toward the bottom left of the planet. \u201cYour Majesty, this is the checkpoint.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go, we\u2019re heading back to Ability Planet.\u201d He grabbed onto Lin Long and headed out.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are we going back?\u201d Lin Long asked in confusion. \u201cHey, hey, hey! Put me down, I\u2019m not going back to that ghostly place! What if something else happens? Hey Mu, put me down!\u201d</p><br/><p>Mu Xuan paid him no heed. Once he reached the door, he turned to call for Yao Si. \u201cSisi.\u201d</p><br/><p>She went after feeling a little odd when she witnessed Mu Xuan pulling \u2018her\u2019 out the door, but his intentions were clear. Even though her ability was absurd, it could always be summoned. There was a chance they could swap back if she were to activate it once more.</p><br/><p>Since the last checkpoint couldn\u2019t be entered through a space portal, they headed over in a ship. Fortunately, they were in a space station close to the Ability Planet and not far from the checkpoint.</p><br/><p>Mu Xuan dragged the unwilling Lin Long with one hand while Yao Si followed after. His expression was solemn and frosty as he passed through the lengthy passageway toward the ship.</p><br/><p>A common sight seemed almost paradoxical now that their bodies were swapped. All the employees were unconsciously attracted, causing a strange atmosphere to blanket over the space station as an endless stream of conversation could be heard.</p><br/><p>\u201cHis Majesty looks fierce, what\u2019s wrong? Did they argue?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCan\u2019t you see him dragging her? Poor thing\u2026 Isn\u2019t Her Highness still a young cub?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard she was injured during the coming of age test, so is His Majesty perhaps angry that she didn\u2019t pass?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t His Majesty know how to treasure his cub? It\u2019s been so many years after all\u2026 Do you guys understand?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s possible! But whose cub didn\u2019t fail a few times before passing? It\u2019s Her Highness\u2019 first failure.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh, didn\u2019t you hear the rumor from the Elders Council? Back when His Majesty first woke up and heard that Her Highness was a fifth generation, he immediately acknowledged her as his cub. There seems to be\u2026 an inside story!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWith his current temper, do you think His Majesty would\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c100%\u2026 Poor Her Highness!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHer highness really is pitiful +1\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Mu Xuan.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Lin Long.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Yao Si.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck! Why are these people looking at me like that?\u201d Lin Long could feel his hair standing up from all the sympathetic gazes. He cursed, then rubbed the goose bumps forming on his arm before turning toward Mu Xuan. \u201cWhat exactly did you do when you awakened?\u201d</p><br/><p>Mu Xuan\u2019s face darkened. \u201cShut up!\u201d He hastened toward the ship. He had finally learned where the rumor about how he had randomly grabbed a fifth generation cub from desperation originated. Those guys in the Elders Council needed to be taught a lesson!</p><br/><p>\u201cAy, slow down!\u201d Lin Long complained without end while being dragged by Mu Xuan. He then started cursing again. \u201cF*ck! I have short legs right now, so why are you walking so fast? Don\u2019t think I\u2019m afraid of you! Let\u2019s have a match if you dare, you @&amp;^@&amp;^\u2026@&amp;@^\u201d</p><br/><p>An endless string of vulgarities sprouted from his mouth continuously without a breather, leaving Yao Si speechless. She leaped forward and sealed his mouth shut.</p><br/><p><em>Any more and you\u2019ll ruin my reputation!</em></p><br/><p>After enduring odd stares from the people in the space station, they finally reached the ship, but just as they were about to board it, the floor started to tremble. The space in front of them started to distort, and the ship that was originally in front of them disappeared. It looked as though something had eaten it up.</p><br/><p>A gigantic ship that looked like a lotus suddenly appeared in the space station. It was snowy white and almost the size of the entire space station. Yet it seemed\u2026 oddly familiar?</p><br/><p>Wasn\u2019t it\u2026 the Flower of the Heavenly Tree?</p><br/><p>(\u2299_\u2299)</p><br/><p>Before Yao Si could react, the ground started to crack, inching open slowly. She lost her footing momentarily, and fell in with Mu Xuan and Lin Long who was beside her.</p><br/><p>\u201cSisi!\u201d Mu Xuan raised his hands, and the next second, a transparent bubble floated over, about to engulf her.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, a familiar voice drenched in excitement rang out. \u201cSisi, I finally found you!\u201d A massive figure appeared, and stunningly beautiful pair of butterfly-like wings spread open before them.</p><br/><p>\u201cLian Yu!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDearest, I won\u2019t let anyone take you away this time.\u201d The next second, light shone from the lotus. It bypassed Mu Xuan\u2019s transparent bubble, speeding over at high speed.</p><br/><p>With a loud splash\u2026 it engulfed Lin Long who was beside Yao Si and disappeared instantly!</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Yao Si.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Mu Xuan.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d The stupefied crowd.</p><br/><p>The next moment, both the Flower of the Heavenly Tree and Lian Yu were gone, leaving a half-ruined space station and a bunch of ridiculed bloodlings.</p><br/><p>Lian Yu\u2019s oath continued to ring without end.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe have the true love\u2026 love\u2026 love\u2026 love!\u201d</p><br/><p><em>F*ck your love! Return me my body!</em></p><br/><p>(\u256f\u2035\u25a1\u2032)\u256f\ufe35\u253b\u2501\u253b</p></div>\n</div>"}

The lanky one on the right asked in surprise, \u201cYou can tell?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat rubbish!\u201d The four of them had been so supportive in the hall, she would have needed to be blind and deaf to not tell they were die-hard fans from her own race!</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Highness, you could recognize us at first glance\u2026 It\u2019s so touching!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo doubt you\u2019re our highness, just because of it, I\u2019m willing to brave any dangers for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, any amount of danger, through both flames and daggers!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Highness, who did you want to kill?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStop stop stop!\u201d <em>What rubbish is this? </em> \u201cWho exactly are you guys? What is your purpose here?\u201d</p><br/><p>They glanced at each other once more, then one on the extreme right nodded. They then activated their optical computers. After less than a minute, a gleam of light washed over them, changing their appearances.</p><br/><p>Once Yao Si took a closer look, she almost choked. \u201cBai Yi!\u201d <em>Why is it him! </em></p><br/><p>\u201cPresident\u2026 No, Your highness.\u201d Bai Yi scratched his head in embarrassment. He seemed agitated as though he had more to say but wasn\u2019t sure where to start. \u201cLo-lo-lo-lo-long, time no see!\u201d</p><br/><p>If Bai Yi was here, then Nephew Gu\u2026</p><br/><p>Indeed, Gu Shucheng stood to the right of Bai Yi.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Highness, we decided to come for summer training just like you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si\u2019s face muscles twitched while she looked at the other two familiar faces. \u201cThey\u2019re here for training too?\u201d They were clearly two of those that Yao Qian had gotten to help her train. One of them was a water series, while the other belonged to the wood series. Their abilities were so much better than hers and they had graduated a few hundred years ago, so why would they even need training!</p><br/><p>\u201cEr\u2026\u201d Gu Shucheng \u2018s eyes flashed, finding yet another righteous excuse. \u201cThey need to strengthen up.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTell. The. Truth!\u201d She activated the power of her bloodline.</p><br/><p>They gave up. \u201cIt was the order from the Elder Council.\u201d</p><br/><p><em>I knew it! It probably wasn\u2019t an order from the Elder\u2019s Council either, but a certain father! </em>Yao Si originally had a \u2018do or die\u2019 attitude, but in an instant, she lost the majority of her drive.</p><br/><p>It is tiring to have a parent that continuously aims to break a student\u2019s drive.</p><br/><p><em>Daddy Mu, you\u2019re going to pamper me into a useless cub at his rate! </em>Yao Si started to feel a deep sense of worry.</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>The next day, Yao Si left Shi Fang sect, while Zan Zichen had left even earlier than her. He probably could sense the dissatisfaction the sect leader had towards him and had bade her farewell early in the morning.</p><br/><p>Yao Si seized the limited time, heading over to the first training location. In the beginning, everyone\u2019s mental strength was the same, but with time, it would start to grow, until it hit the peak of the individual\u2019s body. In theory, if one\u2019s age was the same, their mental strength would be the same.</p><br/><p>Mental ability that spanned across the Galaxy was similar to abilities. It could be ranked from E to 3S, with the majority of mental strength being in rank C. This was obviously excluding bloodlings that lived for such a long time. Unless there was a major change, the abilities would only depend on the individual.</p><br/><p>Yao Si needed to learn to control her mental strength. Mu Xuan had mentioned that she had been in hibernation for many years, hence her mental strength wasn\u2019t weak, it just lacked practice.</p><br/><p>Celestials had another term for mental strength \u2013 External Consciousness. And the best way to train it was to exert it.</p>\n</div>"}

Even though she had been on a ban from leaving home for the past few months, she hadn\u2019t spent that time in vain. She still did her school work and had learned a lot through the Galactic web. In general, all the common knowledge that she lacked she managed to learn during the last couple months. \u201cOh, what\u2019s this?\u201d</p><br/><p>She pointed toward the most striking document in the middle. It didn\u2019t seem the same as the others \u2013 there were three photos at the top of it, each of them containing a profile of a person with a flashing medal.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s a friendly competition between The First Academy and Zhuo Feng academy. It\u2019s held in the 31st district of Demon Planet. These are the top three participants who were able to protect the safety of all the members while at the same time improving their mental strength.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMental strength?\u201d Yao Si grasped the main point swiftly. \u201cIsn\u2019t that an ability? Why is the third student from the elementary level biological series?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStrictly speaking, mental strength isn\u2019t an ability, since every race can posses mental strength,\u201d Nephew Gu explained. \u201cIt differs only in it\u2019s intensity. Mental strength is linked to one\u2019s awareness, so a stronger sense of awareness would lead to a stronger mental strength.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou mean\u2026 mental strength has nothing to do with our abilities?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou could say it that way.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si stilled, a thought forming.</p><br/><p>She was reminded of Euphoria. Recently, they seemed to have vanished into thin air. This could normally mean only two things. The first possibility was that they wasn\u2019t as big of an organization as she had predicted, so they had already all died out. This would be the \u2018good\u2019 possibility.</p><br/><p>The other was\u2026 quite terrible in comparison. It would mean that Euphoria\u2019s management is massive, and highly secretive, to be able to operate without alerting both the Alliance and the bloodlings.</p><br/><p>This would then lead to the fact that they could fight on equal ground against the entire Alliance and the Red Planet. There would be no need to speak of having grasped their limits, let alone come close to their heart.</p><br/><p>If this was the actual situation, their disappearance could potentially mean a great danger brewing in the dark, waiting for the right time to spring out. If Euphoria was really this good, then Yao Si might be in danger after having revealed her fifth generation bloodline.</p><br/><p>This might have be the main reason why Mu Xuan had refused to let her out during the last couple months! Even though they had won the battle at the base, luck had played a large role in the outcome. If she hadn\u2019t been able to summon her ability, if she hadn\u2019t been facing bloodlings, if the power of her bloodline hadn\u2019t erupted, she would have never won with such ease. Basically, her ability was too volatile; she was too weak.</p><br/><p>She made up her mind then. She was going to do summer training!</p><br/><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Mu Xuan vehemently objected after hearing her thoughts.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Yao Si asked, startled. \u201cI heard that it\u2019s the best place for training one\u2019s mental strength.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too dangerous.\u201d It hasn\u2019t been long since she had come back from the research base, yet here she was ready to risk herself again. Besides, the places she was choosing to go to were getting increasingly more dangerous. She was just a cub, so how could he allow that.</p><br/><p>\u201cMu Xuan.\u201d Yao Si sighed, looking at him seriously. \u201cYou know about my ability\u2026 I should actively seek out ways to protect myself.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s me!\u201d <em>Who would dare to bully my cub with me around?</em></p><br/><p>\u201cBut you can\u2019t always be by my side.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He sunk into silence. His cub was right, of course. Self-defence was the best form of defence. Yet even though he was clear on that, he couldn\u2019t help a wave of sorrow rising within him. His cub was all grown up and ready to leave. What should he do? This was an emergency!</p>\n</div>"}

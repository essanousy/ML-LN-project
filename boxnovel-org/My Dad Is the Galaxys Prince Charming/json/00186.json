He slouched down in exhaustion, leaning almost his entire weight onto her. With a deep exhale, he reassured her. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>Her heart clenched as she tightened her hands around him.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Yu, lets go home!\u201d Lin Long wasn\u2019t the least bit interested in their lovey-dovey actions. He hugged Lian Yu and headed toward the portal with excitement.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Before Lian Yu could react, she was already midway to the portal. Both surprised and embarrassed, she swatted his arm away while chiding, \u201cI can walk, put me down.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, yes, yes, my Xiao Yu.\u201d Lin Long broke into a radiant smile. Yet even though he agreed verbally, he tightened his hands around her. He looked as satisfied as if he had conquered the whole world.</p><br/><p>Yao Si could almost see pink hearts surrounding him. Their bickering seemed paradoxically harmonious, and a term floated into her mind: illicit love affair!</p><br/><p><em>Don\u2019t ever come back, heh! </em>She tightly clenched onto her nanny dad.</p><br/><p>o(\ufe36\ufe3f\ufe36)o</p><br/><p>Just as the two were about to enter the portal, the white glow suddenly started to flicker. They seemed to have met with a barrier that bounced them back.</p><br/><p>Lin Long was caught off guard, and both of them were flung backward. Fortunately, Mu Xuan went forward on time and cushioned their fall with an air wall.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Yao Si asked in confusion. \u201cThe portal failed?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not it!\u201d Lin Long helped Lian Yu stabilize. His gaze filled with shock and cautiousness when he focused on the portal ahead. \u201cSomeone is coming over from the other side.\u201d</p><br/><p><em>What?</em></p><br/><p>Yao Si stilled, unable to process his words. It took her a while to figure out that since the portal was to Lin Long\u2019s world, then what he said meant\u2026 other ancestors were coming over!</p><br/><p>Her heart sank, and she glanced over at the portal. As expected, it suddenly started to morph as though someone was trying to break through it.</p><br/><p>Less than a minute later, a pale hand appeared, fumbling about experimentally before gradually emerging from within.</p><br/><p>An unfamiliar man appeared at the entrance of the portal. He was clothed in a black retro-looking robe made from an undecipherable material that was smooth and form-fitting.</p><br/><p>The man had a healthy complexion that was horrifyingly white. His head was slightly lifted. As if from habit, he looked both solemn and unapproachable. His chilly gaze stood out in particular. It didn\u2019t seem like anything in the world was worthy enough for him.</p><br/><p>Yao Si couldn\u2019t help feeling guarded against him; he seemed to have come with ill intentions.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you the one I assigned to search this universe?\u201d The man\u2019s gaze narrowed as it fell on Lin Long; his head remained lifted in what looked like contempt.</p><br/><p>Lin Long stilled, frowning in displeasure. \u201cThat\u2019s right, I\u2019m Lin Long. And you are?\u201d</p><br/><p>The newcomer smirked, dismissing his question; instead, he started caressing the ring with a rose carving on his right thumb.</p><br/><p>Lin Long\u2019s eyes went wide suddenly as though he had came across something unbelievable. \u201cYou-you are\u2026\u201d He went down on one knee, performing a greeting Yao Si had never seen before and saluting politely. \u201cGrand prince!\u201d</p><br/><p><em>Grand prince? Who\u2019s that?</em></p><br/><p>(\u2299_\u2299)</p><br/><p>Everyone was full of confusion.</p><br/><p>The pompous man nodded, his expression still one of disdain. \u201cWe have received your report so I\u2019m here to verify.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cVerify?\u201d Lin Long stilled slightly, full of confusion.</p><br/><p>What was there for him to verify? Even though he hadn\u2019t completed the mission, it wasn\u2019t grave enough to warrant a punishment. Besides, in all the years, many other clansmen had been assigned the same mission and not one of them had managed to complete it successfully.</p><br/><p>There also wasn\u2019t a reason for the clan to be prejudiced against him. It certainly wasn\u2019t serious enough for them to assign someone of the grand prince level to head down for him!</p><br/><p>\u201cYou found your contractor?\u201d the man asked, not intending to explain himself.</p><br/><p>Lin Long glanced over at Lian Yu unconsciously before nodding. \u201cYes, grand prince.\u201d</p><br/><p>The man smirked, then turned to Lian Yu with a frown before moving his gaze to Yao Si and Mu Xuan. Suddenly, he stilled and his body flashed, appearing right before her.</p><br/><p>His gaze fixed on Yao Si, or rather the marking on her forehead.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are a contractor too!\u201d His eyes lit up instantly when he caught sight of her, and his lips curved upwards into a smile. \u201cThere are indeed two contractors here!\u201d The flame in his gaze started to intensify even as he tried to suppress an overwhelming surge of excitement.</p><br/><p>Yao Si took a step back instinctively. The grand prince was making her uncomfortable!</p><br/><p>\u201cGreat, that\u2019s great!\u201d His smile brightened, and he diverted his satisfied gaze back to Lin Long. \u201cEven though you are an ordinary clansman, you have accomplished an amazing feat. You can just wait here, no need to report back.\u201d He waved his hand, attempting to suppress the excitement within him as he glanced around at the surroundings. \u201cFrom today onwards, this universe belongs to us.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si felt her heart sink. This seemed like an an inauspicious omen. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI meant it literally,\u201d the grand prince explained in a rather jolly mood. \u201cOur clansman have been traveling through different universes our whole lives just to find their contractors, but the success rate is far too low, not even hitting 5%. There has never been an instance when two contractors were found in the same universe. No! There could even be three of them!\u201d</p><br/><p>He grew increasingly excited. \u201cThis has never happened before, so there might be four, five, six\u2026 or even more! This universe is of utmost importance to our race, which is why I was sent here to verify the phenomenon. If it is true, our whole race will head over.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si\u2019s heart tightened. She was certain it definitely wouldn\u2019t be just about finding partners.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do with this universe?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTo aid our people in finding their contractors, naturally we would have to capture everyone!\u201d the grand prince replied flippantly.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou intend to invade our universe!\u201d</p><br/><p>F*ck! A war was on the line!</p><br/><p>His words stunned everyone present.</p><br/><p>Just one ancestor could destroy their world, let alone a whole bunch of million year old single dogs!</p><br/><p>Who in their universe could stop them?</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a small universe, so what\u2019s the big deal?\u201d The grand prince narrowed his eyes, disregarding the magnitude of waging a ward on the whole world. Instead, he waved at Lin Long. \u201cWait here, I\u2019ll head back to announce the good news.\u201d</p><br/><p>He turned as he spoke, preparing to enter the white portal.</p><br/><p>\u201cStand there!\u201d Yao Si shouted out anxiously.</p><br/><p>Mu Xuan reacted swiftly, and with a flash of his hand, a bright light smashed against the portal, destroying it instantly.</p><br/><p>The grand prince definitely couldn\u2019t go back!</p></div>\n</div>"}

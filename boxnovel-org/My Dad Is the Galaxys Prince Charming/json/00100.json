Hahaha. This is definitely something new.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, this is the first time someone challenged him; he has always been the one initiating the challenge.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho exactly is Ancestor? Have you heard of her before?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHave you seen her stats? She has 0% victory rate! Where did she get the courage to initiate a challenge?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI bet one spicy slice she will be thrashed.\u201d</p><br/><p>The discussion intensified, and Yao Si could feel her intestines churning. So\u2026 that button was to initiate a challenge? Her mischievous hands were to blame! How could she know about challenges? Was it too late to just admit defeat?!</p><br/><p>[The opponent rejects your request to surrender.]</p><br/><p>F*ck! He was being serious.</p><br/><p>[The battle will begin in 9,8, 7\u2026]</p><br/><p><em>Is this for real?! It\u2019s just going to start like that?</em></p><br/><p>Yao Si could feel her limbs freezing, the four familiar operation bands appearing on her limbs. A row of words appeared before her: [Data for a bound robot not found. Please choose a suitable robot!]</p><br/><p>How could she have any idea about robots?! As the seconds continued ticking, the black robot prepared itself, going into an offensive stance. Yao Si in the meantime gritted her teeth, choosing the familiar fat and short-limbed model.</p><br/><p>\u201cHahahaha, check this out, she actually chose a defensive robot. This newbie sure has guts.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaybe she given up on healing and had specifically chosen to get beaten up.\u201d</p><br/><p>The crowd broke into a chorus of laughter at the appearance of the challeger robot, but Yao Si no longer had the time to care as the battle had started. The moments ago stationary black robot started to move about so only his afterimage could be seen.</p><br/><p>He is definitely worthy of being called lighting!</p><br/><p>The wind around Yao Si grew stronger as though a hurricane was stirring with a loud swooshing noise. Her opponent was testing the waters. If she didn\u2019t hide, she would be at the mercy of his finishing blow.</p><br/><p>But\u2026 she couldn\u2019t move!</p><br/><p><em>F*ck </em>. Based on her pathetic robot destroying experience, there was no way she\u2019d know such high-end operations.</p><br/><p>The Galactic web was clearly part of the future technology, since even the awareness controlled space was so realistic. Just like in reality, Yao Si wasn\u2019t able to operate the robot as she pleased.</p><br/><p>The opponent was a stark contrast to her. His swift and complex operations could make one believe that he had merged with the robot; he skittered around her in circles with his eyes shut, enjoying the moment. The difference in their skills was apparent.</p><br/><p>He moved at high speed without care. After struggling to make a turn, he disappeared from her sight, clearly playing with her. He was simply flaunting his skills.</p><br/><p>The rise in temperature indicated the end of his tests, and Yao Si\u2019s surroundings morphed into a sea of flames. Her opponent raised his weapon, which instead of being one of the popular weapons that robots used was a blue glowing sword. Lightning leaped up , his sword lifted high in preparation.</p><br/><p>Yao Si gritted her teeth. Even though victory was impossible, it wouldn\u2019t sit well to just lose without a fight. She gave up trying to make small movements and instead blasted all of her mental strength toward the robot\u2019s limb in a final attack.</p><br/><p>Familiar energy surged through her, and light spread through the robot. It sprinted forward and crashed straight into the wall ahead, creating a huge depression.</p><br/><p>A somewhat familiar row of words appeared before her then. [Your robot has been fully destroyed, and you are no longer able to compete. Battle over.]</p><br/><p>As usual, she had managed to destroy yet another robot!</p><br/><p>\u256e(\u256f\ufe4f\u2570\uff09\u256d</p><br/><p>[Buzz, congratulations in winning the competition. Your robot is now in third place with a 100% winning rate!]</p><br/><p><em>What? </em>Yao Si stilled. <em>What the f*ck?</em></p><br/><p>The next second, the crowd burst into loud cheering.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck, this can\u2019t be right, she actually\u2026 won?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck +1. This world is changing way too fast, and I can\u2019t seem to catch up. Hurry, punch me once to know if it\u2019s real.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBlack Lighting actually lost, and in one blow\u2026 I never knew a defence machine could be used like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, can you see that? Her winning rate was zero just minutes ago but now is 100%. Could she have only fought this one battle? Yet she actually challenged the third position on her first try. That\u2019s so impressive!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho exactly is this Ancestor? Is she a robot expert in real life? Does anyone have inside news?\u201d</p><br/><p><em>What exactly happened here? </em>Yao Si grimaced and glanced down instinctively.</p><br/><p>On the ground, between her and the wall, was a wrecked black robot that clearly had lost all ability to fight. That flattened and distorted position\u2026 Was it possible\u2026 that maybe\u2026 she had crashed it?</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Yao Si felt a surge of emotions.</p><br/><p>Er\u2026 Aren\u2019t you an expert? How could you just be rammed into like that? Why didn\u2019t you dodge?</p><br/><p>If she thought about it\u2026 He had to have been before her, so when she crashed into him and destroyed his robot, he would have suffered the damage first. That meant she\u2026 had won?</p><br/><p><em>What the f*ck?</em></p><br/><p>(\u256f\u2035\u25a1\u2032)\u256f\ufe35\u253b\u2501\u253b</p><br/><p>But she had just destroyed another robot as she always did!</p><br/><p>\u201cShe managed to defeat the agile Black Lighting with a defense model; she must be a robot master in reality!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, that\u2019s just a beginner mode. Oh gosh, she must be a master!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster do you need to modify your robot leg? Please teach me, please punch me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c+1, Master, which planet do you originate from? Do you need help heading back? I can check back again later if you don\u2019t need it now.\u201d</p><br/><p>The crowd started singing a different tune as it speculated about her. A swarm of friend requests flooded her vision, drowning it out.</p><br/><p>Yao Si\u2019s lips started to twitch, and she took a glance at the wreckage at her feet. Next, she proceeded by making a technical decision\u2014logging out.</p><br/><p>What a joke! It\u2019d be bad if they found out that destroying robots was her only move! As a fifth generation bloodling, she had to hold onto her dignity.</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>Ever since that day, Yao Si never once headed back to the battleground or pestered Mu Xuan for more robots to destroy. Instead, she buried herself in the other two courses she had picked.</p><br/><p>Whilst she immersed herself in her studies, the selection for the \u2018Academy Cup\u2019 robot competition began. After Yao Si\u2019s choice of the award, the competition became a focal point of the Galaxy.</p><br/><p>The academy went into a hyped up mode with daily discussions revolving around the competition. Since the first ten preliminary rounds garnered such a huge crowd, the academy specifically segregated an area for participants to practice and battle.</p><br/><p>The moment Yao Si set her eyes on the grounds, she couldn\u2019t help feeling proud about her academy. It was showing off extravagance that comes with wealth!</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Highness, these are the top three candidates from our academy.\u201d Gu Shucheng pointed toward three bashful youths before continuing. \u201cThey are also the candidates representing our academy in the \u2018Academy cup\u2019 robot competition.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHello!\u201d She stretched out her arm for them to take. \u201cGreat work so far, and good luck in the competition.\u201d</p><br/><p>Their eyes lit up and willed with enthusiasm, but they remained cautious as they shook her hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cPresident, don\u2019t worry, we will do our best.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right president, we will definitely get first place.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone has a part to play for our academy\u2019s glory!\u201d</p><br/><p>The youngsters were indeed hot-blooded. \u201cJust do your best. The rank isn\u2019t important.\u201d</p><br/><p>They nodded in unison then followed her into the ship that served as the competition grounds.</p><br/><p>The academy had actually chartered a private ship! Everything seemed unreal to Yao Si. Such extravagance wasn\u2019t fitting for a school, and looked more like it belonged to a conglomerate.</p><br/><p>Because of that, she wasn\u2019t the least bit surprised when she heard about the specialized battle planet which Zhuo Feng Academy had arranged for the competition.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh right, out of the three of them, who is the first for the preliminaries?\u201d Yao Si couldn\u2019t help asking Gu Shucheng after they entered the ship.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo one was given first place yet,\u201d Gu Shucheng replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh? Shouldn\u2019t there be a ranking among them?\u201d Yao Si stilled.</p><br/><p>\u201cDue to the unique nature of the prize, it\u2019s better to reveal it later as not to kill their fighting spirit,\u201d he replied seriously. \u201cThose that receive a better ranking in this upcoming competition will naturally become the champions of the preliminaries. This was a decision made by the committee.\u201d</p><br/><p><em>Mmh, it does seem to make sense. </em></p><br/><p>Nine out of ten of the participants were Mu Xuan\u2019s crazy fans. If the first place was revealed straight away, those that didn\u2019t make it would definitely feel demoralized, and it would affect their performance during the competition.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are 350 academies participating in the competition so we\u2019ll need a total of three days,\u201d Gu Shucheng explained. \u201cThis time, the competition will be using real robots. Participants can either use robots they made themself or the ones commonly used in the Galaxy. The charges will be covered by the academy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey get to choose?\u201d Yao Si froze. There was a diverse selection with similar functions and abilities, so what if they chose opposing ones? Wouldn\u2019t that be bad?</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, but the grade would be capped at B rank.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh.\u201d That would make it more fair. \u201cOh right, why aren\u2019t you with Luo Ying today?\u201d Weren\u2019t they inseparable?</p><br/><p>\u201cBai Yi\u2019s in a bad mood so Luo Ying wil come back after placating him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBai Yi?\u201d Yao Si stilled. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with him?\u201d</p><br/><p>Gu Shucheng paused slightly before replying seriously, \u201cHis fragile heart broke when he lost in the competition.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Eh, why wasn\u2019t she told that the chatterbox participated? She could roughly guess what would hurt his fragile heart, but wasn\u2019t it just an autograph? Wasn\u2019t it going a little too far?</p><br/><p>\u201cThat aside\u2026\u201d Gu Shucheng glanced at her with a complex expression. \u201cYour Highness, is it really alright for you to leave the Red Planet for three days?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEr\u2026\u201d Her lips twitched. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I came after gaining approval from Mu Xuan.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Gu Shucheng was full of suspicion. \u201cHis Majessty really agreed? Don\u2019t you\u2026\u201d need to head home for your meals?</p><br/><p>\u201cMmh, mmh, mmh.\u201d</p><br/><p>She glanced to the side at a certain someone who was trying to appear nonchalant. How could he not have agreed when he followed her all the way here?</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good!\u201d Nephew Gu sighed. After a moment\u2019s thought, he added, \u201cJust to be careful though, let\u2019s head back when its nearing lunch time?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d <em>Enough!</em></p><br/><p><em>Your favorite majesty is standing right beside you! Can\u2019t you see?!</em></p><br/><p>\u201cCome!\u201d Mu Xuan passed her a cup of red liquid. \u201cIt\u2019s to quench your thirst.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si\u2019s lips twitched, but she downed the contents of the cup in a few gulps without a word.</p>\n</div>"}

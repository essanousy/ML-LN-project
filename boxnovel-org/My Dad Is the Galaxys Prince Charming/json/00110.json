Your Highness, please give me a moment.\u201d Bai Yi sped up, his fingers flying around at a faster pace; however, after a long while, he was still at it.</p><br/><p>It must be hard.</p><br/><p>Just as Yao Si was hesitating whether to come back at a later time so that they wouldn\u2019t be a disturbance, Mu Xuan, who had been holding onto her hand the entire time, suddenly released her. He headed to the middle of the data and started to operate. Suddenly, the red numbers appeared once more.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh! That\u2019s a new way of tracing!\u201d Bai Yi exclaimed in shock, joy clouding his features. \u201cYou deserve to be His Majesty, indeed, but these figures\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Thus, the two of them resumed their work, sending endless figures throughout the room with occasional beeping.</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know you could do that! You can actually count space data?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck, i don\u2019t believe this!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, yes, yes, this right, it\u2019s this formula.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Majesty, I think\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Audience Yao Si.</p><br/><p>She had no idea what they were saying\u2026 Eh\u2026 nothing seems logical.</p><br/><p>She felt as though she would always be a young cub. What was she going to do then?</p><br/><p>This is tiring!</p><br/><p>After half an hour\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cI found it!\u201d Bai Yi exclaimed, jumping up toward her in excitement. \u201cI found it, I found the position, look, look\u2026\u201d He pointed at a tiny glow on the map. \u201cIt\u2019s right here, I\u2019m sure of it!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si inched closer but wasn\u2019t able to recognize the place. \u201cWhere is this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Yi stilled, leaning over and staring up at the skies blankly as he muttered, \u201cEh, it\u2019s weird. Isn\u2019t that the back of the Red Planet? Isn\u2019t that a forest? Why haven\u2019t I seen this map before?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the Heavenly Bestowed yard,\u201d Mu Xuan said, his face grave and his brows furrowed. Yao Si\u2019s heart clenched. Was that a special place?</p><br/><p>\u201cHeavenly Bestowed yard? What place is that?\u201d Bai Yi asked, equally confused.</p><br/><p>Mu Xuan\u2019s face fell as though remembering a grave event. After a while, he responded, \u201cEarth\u2019s gene research centre. It\u2019s a reproduction centre\u2026 where the newborn bloodlings are born.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat!\u201d Bai Yi was clearly in shock, his eyes widening, anxiety and worry spreading out. \u201cF*ck! That maniac, how can it be such an important place, no way! I have to inform the Elder Council!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si understood the meaning behind his expression, her entire body turning cold.</p><br/><p>Bai Yi was already out the door.</p><br/><p>\u201cStand there!\u201d Yao Si shouted, using her bloodline suppression to paralyse him.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Highness?\u201d Bai yi went still. \u201cManiac Yuan has a virus that even bloodlings are not able to resist. Plus, that is such an important place. There may be fragile beings there that are yet to be converted. I haven\u2019t even gotten my cub yet, so there is no way anything can go wrong there. Hurry and inform the Elder Council. If we get someone over\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBai Yi!\u201d Yao Si sighed, then carefully articulated her next words. \u201cIf you are aware of the importance of the place, will the Elder Council not be?\u201d</p><br/><p>He froze. \u201cYour Highness, what\u2026 do you mean?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Heavenly Bestowed yard is bloodling breeding ground, which means it possess the tightest security within the Red Planet.\u201d She articulated each word carefully, feeling a chill inching up her back. \u201cIf even you are able to find its location, do you really think the Heavenly Bestowed yard isn\u2019t aware of it?\u201d</p><br/><p>His eyes widened as though about to fall out. \u201cYou-you mean that within the Elder Council\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a snitch!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>At closer inspection, issues started to surface. Since bloodlings were stronger even than the Alliance, how could there be no news of Yuan Han\u2019s whereabouts?</p><br/><p>There was also the so called Euphoria organization. They had clearly destroyed a massive research base, but after an entire year, the Elder Council had somehow found nothing. Yuan Han was clearly linked to the organization, since the virus most probably originated from Euphoria. That organization had to be of a considerable scale to be able to revive a virus that had vanished millions of years ago. Besides, there was no way an organization of such a large scale would be able to leave no traces even if it had been careful.</p><br/><p>The only possibility was the presence of people hindering progress. Yao Si didn\u2019t wish to point fingers, but that snitch was definitely a member of their kind.</p><br/><p>A chill brushed her heart. Her hatred and persistence in fighting against the organization was due to their threat toward bloodlings, so she would have never guessed that it already had deep ties with her kind.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need to inform the Elder Council,\u201d Mu Xuan said solemnly. \u201cI\u2019ll go.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si\u2019s heart shook. \u201cI\u2019ll go too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo!\u201d In Mu Xuan\u2019s mind, there wasn\u2019t any room for discussion. \u201cIt\u2019s too dangerous.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I can\u2019t let you go alone,\u201d she told him seriously. \u201cI\u2019ll be worried about you too.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mu Xuan stilled, the flush inching up toward his face once more. He turned his head awkwardly to cough before taking her hand in a tight grip. \u201cThen\u2026 follow me, don\u2019t stray.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d She lifted her free hand in a form of promise.</p><br/><p>Mu Xuan nodded. He waved in the air, opening a space teleportation. Holding onto her, he went in.</p><br/><p>Bai Yi stared blankly after them. \u201c\u2026\u201d Wait a minute! Was he supposed to follow them? Just before the space portal completely disappeared, he gritted his teeth and rushed in</p><br/><p>The image Yao Si had of Heavenly Bestowed yard was similar to that of Elder Council\u2019s base or even the research base, but the moment she lay her eyes on the yard, she realized how off she was. The Heavenly Bestowed yard took up a huge amount of land space, and it looked nothing like a yard. Instead, it seemed more like a small town. This was the first time she saw such a place in the Red Planet.</p><br/><p>They were here to find the b*tch Yuan Han and investigate the location, so shouldn\u2019t they have been more mindful of their tracks and chosen a more inconspicuous entrance? Instead, Mu Xuan dragged her toward the main door\u2026</p><br/><p>His gaze was straight and unwavering, his stance confident without shame as he entered through the main door. Worry started pooling in Yao Si\u2019s heart, but just as she was about to remind him about their goal, she detected people at the side. The guards stood as usual, not bothered by their appearance. They didn\u2019t look over once, as if nothing out of order could be seen.</p><br/><p>Yao Si\u2019s originally frantic heart calmed down instantly.</p><br/><p>Alright, she seemed to have forgotten about her dad\u2019s frightening amount of mental strength! Her worries seemed to have been in vain. Yet his abilities were a jarring reminder of her own deficiencies. Comparison was, indeed, the root of unhappiness.</p><br/><p>Once they entered, the enormity of the place was apparent; the town\u2019s end could not be seen. Since this place was the breeding grounds of the bloodlings, security here was tight, with guards stationed all around while many more patrolled the streets. If it wasn\u2019t for Mu Xuan\u2019s mental ability, it would have been impossible to enter without notice.</p><br/><p>Just as they were about to head over, a voice came from behind, \u201cYour Highness, I have zeroed in on the location. It should be two hundred meters to the right.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBai Yi.\u201d Yao Si jumped, turning to glance at him. \u201cWhy are you here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d I was always here, okay? How can you just disregard a single dog like me, what\u2019s the big deal about having a cub!</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d Mu Xuan tugged Yao Si in the location Bai Yi had mentioned.</p><br/><p>It was a gigantic building with an oval top. There weren\u2019t any guards stationed at the door, but it was tightly shut. To the right, there was a screen with a bunch of complicated numbers flickering about. Just one look was enough to tell the level of difficulty for anyone who might want to get through it.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is the most advanced security in the Galactic.\u201d Bai Yi\u2019s face fell, and he muttered, \u201cThis has a totally individual coding mechanism, it\u2019ll be a little difficult, but I\u2019ll try my best.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d Mu Xuan took a step toward the screen. After a few taps of his finger, the screen turned black, and the door opened.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s amazing! Bai Yi was entranced as he directed a glittery stare at Mu Xuan, the fanboy in him advancing to another level.</p><br/><p>\u201cMu Xuan, are you a hacker too?\u201d It was obvious that he was on a higher level.</p><br/><p>Mu Xuan turned to glance at Yao Si, reaching out to caress her head out of habit. He replied lightly, \u201cAfter living for such a long time, you\u2019ll learn it naturally.\u201d</p><br/><p>Eh, I\u2019ve also lived a long life, so why don\u2019t I know it!</p><br/><p>Yao Si could feel the pain\u2026</p><br/><p>She followed after him silently. In this entire journey, she seemed to have understood what a prodigy was. Regardless of the field or the problem, Mu Xuan was able to successfully solve the issue in less than a minute. The rest of the path seemed to be smooth, and for a moment, she even forgot that they were intruders.</p><br/><p>\u25cb|\uffe3|_</p><br/><p>After ten minutes, they finally reached the heart of the yard. As expected, there was a transportation tool that looked like a miniature galactic door that was about three-to-four meters high. A silvery material seemed to be flowing out of it.</p><br/><p>This place was vastly different from the other areas. There was a particularly heightened security here, and everyone wore intense and solemn expressions as though they were guarding a precious treasure.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s-it\u2019s real!\u201d Bai Yi paled, staring at the door in disbelief.</p><br/><p>Yao Si\u2019s heart sank, and a mixture of emotions poured out \u2013 anger, disappointment, and a bit of hurt.</p><br/><p>Heavenly Bestowed yard was considered the most important place to the bloodlings, so there was no way a transportation portal would be placed here. The risk would simply be way too high. There would be no guarantee that no one unwelcome wouldn\u2019t pass through. Besides, this was the place where all bloodlings were born and earthlings were cloned. Even a dumb person would know not to keep a threat so close to here.</p><br/><p>The presence of a teleportation portal was enough evidence\u2026 The entire Heavenly Bestowed yard was in danger. Someone must have taken control of the yard or the entire Heavenly Bestowed yard had turned into traitors. Neither of which was favorable news.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe teleportation door has opened!\u201d Bai Yi exclaimed.</p><br/><p>Yao Si lifted her head, and the door was indeed shaking. The next second, four people came from somewhere in the building. The four of them were a little different from the guards, each of them wielding a different weapon in their hands.</p><br/><p>A tingling suspicion began to form in Yao Si\u2019s mind, but she couldn\u2019t seem to pinpoint the issue.</p><br/><p>Bai Yi verbalised his confusion. \u201cThat\u2019s strange, they\u2026 don\u2019t seem like bloodlings.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Yao Si stilled and took a closer look at the four of them. \u201cAre you sure, they seem like it though. What are they if not bloodlings?\u201d They clearly had a similar aura.</p><br/><p>\u201cEarthlings,\u201d Mu Xuan replied, his voice deep. \u201cThose that haven\u2019t been converted.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey are humans!\u201d Yao Si burst out as she stared at them. Was what why she felt familiarity?</p><br/><p>The newcomers had black eyes and yellow skin, and Yao Si asked, \u201cAren\u2019t humans extinct?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey are clones from Heavenly Bestowed yard.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cClones!\u201d Bai Yi exclaimed in agitation, his gaze focused on them. \u201cThey-they-they are\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Mu Xuan nodded. \u201cThe newest batch of cubs.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWait a minute!\u201d Yao Si grabbed onto a certain single dog that was dying to head over. \u201cWhy would the earthling clones be brought over from elsewhere?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Yi stilled, calming down slightly. Even Mu Xuan was frowning. Bloodlings placed high emphasis on cubs and the converted earthlings, so how could it be possible for them to have left for a time?</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s follow them.\u201d Mu Xuan grabbed onto Yao So as the four earthlings were preparing to leave.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

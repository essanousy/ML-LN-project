How could she be their queen? With her absurd ability that could go wrong at any second\u2026 If she really was their queen, wouldn\u2019t the entire race be in jeopardy?!</p><br/><p>No, no, no, it was definitely not real. She would rather believe the throne belonged to Mu Xuan.</p><br/><p>As it was, all the pure breeds became extremely emotional, glancing up at her with a burning gaze that seemed on the verge of bursting into flames. Hence, their battle for survival ended on a strange note.</p><br/><p>All her resistance was useless. The pure breeds were convinced that she was their queen and had instantly converted into loyal fans. Regardless of whether they were scolded or if their abilities were obliterated, they were willing to accept everything.</p><br/><p>They were completely at her mercy, prepared to fulfill her any wish. Other than their unwillingness to return to their world and persistence on addressing her by the gloried name: Your Majesty. They had to go wherever the queen went!</p><br/><p>The bloodlings followed her everywhere, and all the way back to the Red Planet. Yao Si could probably remember forever the stunned faces of the Elders Council when they caught sight of thousands following behind her.</p><br/><p><em>Who are they? The defeated troops? Captives?</em></p><br/><p>(\u2299 o \u2299)</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is a conspiracy, it definitely is a conspiracy.\u201d Yao Si glanced out of the Majestic Palace. There were thousands of troops dressed in black armor scattered everywhere obediently. If there wasn\u2019t a sign stating \u2018Single dogs not allowed!\u2019, they would have definitely taken over her whole house.</p><br/><p>Those rascals, acting obedient wasn\u2019t going to get them anywhere.</p><br/><p>\u201cWould they conspire something internally after taking me as their queen?\u201d Previously, the elder grand prince broke his promise, so based on his intelligence, there was a high chance of a hidden conspiracy.</p><br/><p>That was certainly evil!</p><br/><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t like that, queen\u2026 Uhm , Your Majesty.\u201d Lin Long stood up anxiously while glancing at her nervously. \u201cI don\u2019t think they are mistaken.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cErgou, you too?\u201d Yao Si swept a glance at Lin Long who wore the same agitated expression as the thousands outside. \u201cWhose side are you on? Why are you changing your alliance? F*ck, why are you trembling?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI-I-I can\u2019t control it!\u201d He didn\u2019t want to, but when he glanced at Yao Si now, his legs couldn\u2019t help but soften, forcing him to his knees. He couldn\u2019t seem to foster any resistance within himself. Everything seemed inevitable and right.</p><br/><p>It was a strange feeling that started ever since Yao Si exerted the power to obliterate the pure breeds\u2019 abilities. It wasn\u2019t easy for him to even be standing at such a close proximity to her. \u201cYour Majesty, the power you are emitting is way too strong; you are definitely our queen. There isn\u2019t a doubt about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, Your Majesty,\u201d Qu Zhe confirmed firmly. \u201cOur race is the only ones who can sense this suppressing force, and the only one who can exert it on us is the queen.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat suppressing force?\u201d Yao Si stilled. She took a moment to sense within her and realized that she seemed to have forgotten to pull back the power she had released during the battle. It was still releasing waves till this moment.</p><br/><p>She stopped it, and almost instantly both Lin Long and Qu Zhe heaved a sigh of relief. Lin Long stopped trembling as well.</p><br/><p>ao Si turned towards the exit, and as predicted, the others seemed much more at ease as well. A few of them started walking around to release the tension in their legs, but none of them left.</p><br/><p>F*ck, they hadn\u2019t been kneeling to prove their submission but rather because of her suppressing force.</p><br/><p>This scene was\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cBloodling suppression!\u201d she blurted out, but it wasn\u2019t the same as the bloodline suppression from before, right? The previous suppression was exerted on the bloodlings of the Red Planet and not the pure breeds.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d Lin Long nodded vigorously. \u201cThat\u2019s why elder grand prince Yuan Jian isn\u2019t wrong.\u201d</p><br/><p><em>F*ck!</em></p><br/><p>\u201cBut I was clearly converted by Mu Xuan!\u201d This information was too much for her to handle, and she gripped onto Mu Xuan for support. \u201cIsn\u2019t that right? Mu Xuan has already recalled how I was converted by him.\u201d</p><br/><p>He tightened his grip around her palm, but before he could speak, Lin Long spoke up. \u201cYour Majesty, since you are our queen, who do you think is the converter?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Yao Si was confused.</p><br/><p>Oh right, if she really was the queen of the bloodlings and could even convert Li Zheng the second time, then the only time she donated blood\u2026</p><br/><p><em>F*ck!</em></p><br/><p>(\u2299_\u2299)</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Majesty, you must have sealed your memory and abilities before hibernating in this universe, which resulted in this memory loss. The seal can only be unraveled with time, which is normal for pure breeds,\u201d Lin Long added. It was a technique all the pure breeds had used before.</p><br/><p>This meant that Yao Si had accidentally converted Mu Xuan when she donated blood? But since she had sealed up her memory and abilities, she wasn\u2019t able to awaken him, resulting in his hibernation.</p><br/><p>Afterwards, even though her bloodline gradually awakened, it was sealed back up by accident while Mu Xuan\u2019s ability awakened. Since he was in hibernation for a longer period of time, he was detected to be a fourth generation which was a rank higher than her. His ability was then fully exposed during the Blue Planet\u2019s doomsday.</p><br/><p>It did seem to explain how Mu Xuan was much stronger than the ancestors and even the elder grand prince. All of it was because of\u2026 her?</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not right!\u201d Yao Si traced back to the most fundamental problem. \u201cI can distinctly remember the events from my childhood. I was the same as the other earthlings, growing from a tiny self.\u201d She could even remember herself being sent to the orphanage by a police officer who was drenched after falling into a pit.</p><br/><p>If she had sealed her memory before hibernation, shouldn\u2019t she have awakened as an adult? Her physique should have been the same! Those memory couldn\u2019t be fake too.</p><br/><p>Lin Long exchanged glances with Yu Zhe who took a step forward to explain. \u201cYour Majesty, bloodlings who are of grand prince rank and above posses a special ability called camouflage!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d <em>What the f*ck?</em></p><br/><p>\u201cIn order for a bloodling to better adjust to the world after hibernation, we enter a state of camouflage before falling asleep. This ability allows us to turn into any form we want.\u201d His body suddenly lit up, turning into different beings at the speed of light. In less than two minutes, he morphed into countless different beings: shorter, slimmer, and\u2026 curvaceous. He changed from an artistic youth into an artistic young lady.</p><br/><p>F*ck, he camouflaged!</p><br/><p>(\u2299 o \u2299)</p><br/><p>This left all of them stunned, but Li Zheng in particular. He stared at the stunning beauty with his mouth agape.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut of course that\u2019s just mimicry and my actual gender would remain the same,\u201d Qu Zhe explained in a completely different voice, one that was soft and feminine. \u201cBefore we sink into hibernation, we seal our abilities and before it awakens, the camouflage takes a long time to disappear. For instance, elder grand prince Yuan Jian\u2019s current form is a camouflage as well.\u201d He then changed back into his original form.</p><br/><p><em>Yuan Jian? You mean that little rascal? His child form isn\u2019t his true form?</em></p><br/><p>\u201cYour Majesty, you must have camouflaged into a baby before entering hibernation.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Was that why she could still distinctly recall her childhood memories, even those from when she was a baby?</p><br/><p>Was she really the queen of the pure breeds?!</p><br/><p>\u03a3(\u00b0\u25b3\u00b0|||)\ufe34</p></div>\n</div>"}

He opened the map and froze, his pupils dilating. \u201cF*ck, it\u2019s a level 100 map! Could the legendary demonic dragon be a level 100 beast?\u201d</p><br/><p>The next second, a sudden howl from the mountaintop reverberated through the air in reply. A gigantic dragon flew into the clouds, making a couple circles in the sky before landing on a volcano. There were a few words in bright red displayed above its head: Ancient Demonic Dragon (Lv. 102).</p><br/><p>\u201cLevel 102!\u201d Bai Yi\u2019seyes widened in shock. \u201cIsn\u2019t the level discrepancy a little extreme? How are we going to fight that monster?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBai Yi, this map is draining our blood continuously.\u201d Li Zheng pointed toward the solidified lava on the ground.</p><br/><p>As expected, their blood level was dropping by a hundred points per second. In a short while, their blood supply was halved. Li Zheng waved the fan in his hands, restoring it. However, the next second, with a snap, his fan broke into two.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s another piece of equipment down.\u201d Li Zheng sighed. \u201cThat was my last one.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIndeed, this mission is proving to be a real challenge.\u201d Bai Yi frowned, rummaging through his bag. \u201cSince it\u2019s the only mission, we won\u2019t be able to give up or go offline. Now that all the equipment is gone, what are we going to do? Not that any normal equipment would do us any good now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have a few things in my bag,\u201d Yao Si volunteered, recalling her full bag.</p><br/><p>\u201cI guess beginner stuff will do too. Pass something to Li Zheng so that he can restore our blood supply. We need to stay alive.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si opened her bag and pulled out a fan that was glowing with all the colors of the rainbow. \u201cIs this alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>Four gleaming words appeared above the fan\u2014Mythical equipment: Time Immemorial Fan!</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Bai Yi.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Li Zheng.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy-mythical\u2026 mythical weapon! Oh god! What did I just see? Is this a dream? Forget about the Scroll of Poetic Saga, how did the legendary mythical equipment end up in Her Highness\u2019 hands?! Wasn\u2019t it supposed to appear after the great war?</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Highness, where did you\u2026 get this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFrom the NPC in newbie village,\u201d Yao Si replied. \u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you it\u2019s a beginner item?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d The two of them blinked. Is the NPC in beginner village your relative?!</p><br/><p>\u25cb|\uffe3|_</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Their silence caused a momentary disappointment within Yao Si. <em>I guess beginner items aren\u2019t good after all </em>. \u201cCan it be used?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Highness\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMmh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you still have other beginner equipment? Could you take them all out?\u201d<em>One is scary enough!</em></p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have much\u2026\u201d Sensing their interest, Yao Si removed the equipment from the bag one by one.</p><br/><p>Mythical equipment: Phoenix Feather Celestial Coat.</p><br/><p>Mythical equipment: Phoenix Feather Celestial Shoes.</p><br/><p>Mythical equipment: Phoenix Feather Hairpin.</p><br/><p>Mythical equipment: Heavenly Erupting Hammer.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The entire ground was littered with equipment with a golden glow\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Bai Yi.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Li Zheng.</p><br/><p>Silence fell upon them.</p><br/><p>Her Highness\u2026 did she kill an entire celestial race?</p><br/><p>After a second, Yao Si dusted off her thighs.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go! Off to chase that dragon!\u201d</p><br/><p>Her Highness was indeed the most reliable comrade, one in a million. With all the mythical equipment, they would be able to eliminate the entire demonic race, not just the level 102 dragon.</p><br/><p>After equipping themselves, they entered the volcano entrance confidently. Amid a pile of lava stones, the black dragon, which had been sleeping, opened its eyes.</p><br/><p>The fight began.</p><br/><p>[Ancient Demonic Dragon: Hahaha! Did the heavenly king send you guys here to die? He must be dreaming. How can you babies (Lv 80) have any chance of defeating me? Heh! Today, I\u2019m going to kill the apple of his eye, The Prettiest Celestial of the Seven Seas, Han Yue, in front of you. It will serve as a reminder to those ignorant celestials who the real master of the three worlds is!]</p><br/><p>With a sway of its tail, a transparent bubble started to ascend with the words \u2018Celestial Han Yue\u2019 at the top of the white figure inside.</p><br/><p>Even though it was just an NPC, Yao Si couldn\u2019t help feeling her anticipation rise as she focused on the ascending bubble. What could the Beauty of the World look like? The person inside seems to be clothed in a gray male outfit, a ribbon wrapped around him, his face taut and stripped off any emotion. He looked like\u2026</p><br/><p>Eh?</p><br/><p>\u201cMu Xuan?\u201d</p><br/><p>(\u2299 o \u2299)</p><br/><p>Why did this NPC look so much like Mu Xuan? Wasn\u2019t the Beauty of the World supposed to be a female celestial? How did the gender change?</p><br/><p><em>Perhaps\u2026 this was made by another of Mu Xuan\u2019s brainless fans?</em></p><br/><p>[Sisi?] a familiar voice asked.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Yao Si.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Bai Yi.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Li Zheng.</p><br/><p>(\u256f\u2035\u25a1\u2032)\u256f\ufe35\u253b\u2501\u253b</p><br/><p>F*ck!</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t an NPC, but it was really him! How did he end up there? That explained why he hadn\u2019t found her after such a long time\u2026 he had turned into an NPC and was now the beauty of the\u2026 world?</p><br/><p>This was too much to handle!</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>At the game company, someone asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Isn\u2019t the Beauty of the World supposed to be Celestial Han Yue, an NPC? How did a player end up in her place?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGive me a moment, I\u2019m getting it checked\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>After ten minutes.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh, there seems to be a problem with this player\u2019s stats\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the problem?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCelestial Han Yue has the highest charisma level in the system. Logically speaking, there is no way a player could exceed that, but this player\u2019s charisma level\u2026 seems odd, but during the transportation, the system was confused and ended up sending him in Celestial Han Yue place.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Why is his charisma level so high? Isn\u2019t the basic data based on Mu Xuan\u2019s looks?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis\u2026 I don\u2019t know, could he have been using additional software?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck! What should we do? Poetic Saga can\u2019t just end here or the advancement won\u2019t succeed. There should be enough time for us to get Celestial Han Yue over.\u201d</p><br/><p>Silence reigned in the room.</p><br/><p>\u201cShould we\u2026 just go on with the mistake?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Han Yue was just a minor plot point which was required to push the player. She wasn\u2019t a BOSS so it wasn\u2019t a big deal. Besides, it was the weekend\u2026 so they wouldn\u2019t be able to get their marriage certificates!</p><br/><p>Which meant\u2026 they should just cover up the entire incident.</p><br/><p>\u256e(\u256f_\u2570)\u256d</p><br/><p>The two operators switched off the warning silently.</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>[Ding! Poetic Saga begins! Brave cultivators, please defeat the beast and save Celestial Han Yue to win amazing rewards and the world\u2019s gratitude. You would also be able to receive love from the celestial herself!]</p><br/><p>The corners of Yao Si\u2019s lips twitched. The celestial\u2019s love?</p><br/><p>Without much time for them to process the situation, the \u2018ready for battle\u2019 notice popped up. The next second, the dragon opened its mouth, spitting multiple lighting daggers toward them.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe have to save him!\u201d Yao Si\u2019s heart sank as she turned around. \u201cBai Yi, you\u2019re a front damage dealer. Go close in and attack. Li Zheng, continue to restore our health. I\u2019ll serve as backup.\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

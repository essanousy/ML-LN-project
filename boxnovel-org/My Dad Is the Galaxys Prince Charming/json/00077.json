The only thing in sight less than a hundred meters to the right was a man in a long vintage outfit. The darkness made it hard for her to decipher the details, but in his hands, she could see a sword that he was using to attack the surroundings ferociously. His long hair was already in a mess. He seemed to be injured, for a pungent coppery blood smell filled the air that the wind brought over.</p><br/><p>As the man swung the sword, he shouted at the surroundings in agitation.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy life is in my own hands, not the heavens\u2019!</p><br/><p>\u201cWith its tiny size, the demonic race has no rights for arrogance, I Zan Zichen won\u2019t give up until I die!\u201d</p><br/><p><em>That line seems rather familiar\u2026</em></p><br/><p>Self-fulfilling prophecy?</p><br/><p>Yao Si grew increasingly more frustrated by the ruckus he was making. Taking a step forward, she called out, \u201cHey\u2026 young man!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho is that?\u201d He turned, trying to spot her. His expression was cautious as he gripped his sword, while his gaze did not seem to be a friendly one.</p><br/><p>\u201cHere, here!\u201d Yao Si took another two steps forward, waving her hands in front of him.</p><br/><p>He turned in the direction of her voice. With his sword, he flicked her hand away before taking a step back. \u201cHow audacious, where did you come from, you demonic woman?\u201d</p><br/><p><em>Demonic woman? You\u2019re the demonic woman, your entire family are demonic women!</em></p><br/><p>\u201cHey, Mister Zan Zichen, could you please keep it down a little?\u201d</p><br/><p>His face sunk and he glared at her intently. \u201cHow do you know my name?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou shouted it out just now!\u201d With such a loud voice, how could she not know?</p><br/><p>He stilled, seemingly recalling the incident. After taking a thorough look at her, his eyes went wide from shock. \u201cYou-you\u2019re a human!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si\u2019s face muscles twitched. \u201cI don\u2019t look like one?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you doing in the demonic realm?\u201d he asked in disbelief.</p><br/><p>What demonic realm? Was it the name of this area? Then\u2026 was he a local?</p><br/><p>Yao Si was a little confused. Ermm.. <em>Do celestials have any rules regarding this, are people on training allowed to interact with the locals? </em>She hadn\u2019t looked at the manual, what was she going to do?</p><br/><p>Just as Zan Zichen was about to continue asking, his face paled and he shouted out, \u201cMissus, be careful!\u201d He stabbed his sword inches from her arm. Yao Si could only feel a strong gust of wind by the side of her arm, startling her.</p><br/><p>What happened?</p><br/><p>With that attack, them hurriedly took hold of her hand. \u201cYou were almost ambushed by the demonic energy, so you should force it up this instant\u2026 Ah?\u201d He paused in confusion, seemingly having met with an incomprehensible matter. He flipped her arm over, inspecting it. \u201cHow can it\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to break if you continue to flip it around.\u201d She shook her hand.</p><br/><p>His hand trembled, and he released her instantly. Zan Zichen\u2019s face flushed a deep red. \u201cMissus, I apologize for my disrespect.\u201d He took a step back formally. \u201cThe situation was an urgent one, but missus, to be able to defend yourself against the demonic energy\u2026 I\u2019m deeply surprised.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDemonic energy?\u201d <em>What\u2019s that?</em></p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, this is the demonic realm, so its filled with demonic energy. If an ordinary person isn\u2019t careful, allowing it to enter them\u2026\u201d He paused, seemingly thinking of something grave, for his brows furrowed, forming a deep knot. \u201d If it\u2019s just little, the body will start to rot, but if it becomes more serious, the person might die.\u201d</p><br/><p><em>It\u2019s that serious? Then was the oppressive feeling I felt the entire time actually demonic energy?</em></p><br/><p>\u201cMissus, your body seems stronger than normal, the demonic energy doesn\u2019t seem to be able to penetrate,\u201d he said. \u201cBut beasts are everywhere within the demonic realm, there\u2019s also the demonic race that treats humans as prey. You should leave as soon as possible.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, thank you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si was about to probe further, but a <em>shhhh, lala </em> sound erupted from afar, and Zan Zichen\u2019s face darkened. \u201cBad news, something is coming. Hurry, we have to leave this place.\u201d With a weird gesture, a long sword floated up in mid-air. He jumped up and reached his hand toward her.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, everything will be fine!\u201d</p><br/><p><em>Yao Si didn\u2019t mind it. Regardless of how dangerous it was, this was just the third district\u2026</em></p><br/><p><em>Awhooo!</em></p><br/><p>Just then, a beast emerged from the sand. It looked like a snake, but it was several feet tall like a bug. It looked like the beasts from movies, with a mouth that was a few meters wide and dagger-like teeth forming several neat rows all around it.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d (\u2299 o \u2299)</p><br/><p>\u201cRun!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si grabbed onto Zan Zichen\u2019s arm and jumped onto the sword. Together, they left in a hurry.</p><br/><p>She had been so calm just a few seconds ago, but now something like this showed up!</p><br/><p><em>How is this the third district! How can there be such a massive beast here? It looks exactly like a miniature galactic beast!</em></p><br/><p><em>Shouldn\u2019t the strongest beast here only be rank B?!</em></p><br/><p><em>Bad advertisement, gonna complain!</em></p><br/><p>\u00a0</p>\n</div>"}

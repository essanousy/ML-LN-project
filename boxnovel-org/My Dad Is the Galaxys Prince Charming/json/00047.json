That was why she hated bugs the most!</p><br/><p>She glanced around, but there didn\u2019t seem to be any escape. Gritting her teeth, she prepared to brave through it!</p><br/><p>Summoning the energy within her, she took a deep breath. Then she tossed her hands forward, releasing all her energy. Regardless of what ability it was, it just had to withstand this attack.</p><br/><p>Suddenly a white glow flooded her sight. It seemed like a white water mirror which was spreading in all directions like a defensive veil that not only blocked the sticky substances but also stopped the black holes in front of Yao Si, preventing them from spreading anymore.</p><br/><p><em>What\u2019s\u2026 this?</em></p><br/><p>Before Yao Si could react, the white water veil shook. <em>Zsss! </em> Something flowed out, and the next moment, with a loud <em>pssh </em>, an enormous round ball shot out, smashing hard against the caterpillar\u2019s body. It couldn\u2019t even shriek once before its brain was crushed. Its massive body instantly lost all spirit, and the sky full of black holes disappeared all at once.</p><br/><p>The crowd exclaimed in hundreds of voices.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was\u2026 smashed to death!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck, you can defeat a galactic beast like this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat was used? It happened so swiftly I could barely catch a glimpse!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Planet 14, the planet that the beast just ate! The Galactic beast was smashed to death by Planet 14!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere did she get it from? What kind of ability is that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe tossed an entire planet, could it be a strength ability?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHave you seen a strength ability that can lift an entire planet?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone present was confused, and so they turned toward the person at the front.</p><br/><p>Yao Si felt perplexed as she stared at her palms for half a second. Her mouth then trembled slightly, and an incredulous thought passed her mind. The galactic beast ate a planet and it had been later spat out by a white water mirror, so the ability that had activated her ability was\u2026</p><br/><p>Yao Si looked around for a table to toss!</p><br/><p>(\u256f\u2035\u25a1\u2032)\u256f\ufe35\u253b\u2501\u253b</p><br/><p>Why was the ability summoned linked to the beast\u2019s ability! How could it be so random?</p><br/><p>The galactic beast\u2019s ability was devouring. Devour\u2026 so did that mean that hers was discharge?</p><br/><p>She was instantly uncomfortable.</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>The Galactic beast was dead, and it was smashed to death by her. She was famous!</p><br/><p>When Yao Si flew back, the entire crowd stared at her weirdly. It seemed like excitement, but with a hint of depression. As she flew, she could hear them murmuring repeatedly, \u201cHurry, look, it\u2019s that girl that smashed the galactic beast with a planet!</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Could they stop looking at her as though she was the hulk? She just wanted to be the weak girl by the side!</p><br/><p>\u201cDad\u2026\u201d she complained to the man in the front. <em>I think my image is wrecked.</em> \u201cWhy did my passive ability work on the galactic beast?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMu Xuan!\u201d He stopped working on his optical computer and corrected her seriously. \u201cYour ability is a counter of your opponent\u2019s, it acts on their ability and not the user itself. It doesn\u2019t discriminate.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d <em>Is that even possible? </em> \u201cWhat was my ability back then?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe galactic beast\u2019s ability was devour so yours\u2026 should have been creation.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh?!\u201d Wasn\u2019t it discharge? Why did it toss a planet out\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cThe white gleam of barrier that blocked the spit is your ability.\u201d Mu Xuan lifted his head to glance at the white water barrier that was fading gradually. \u201cThe appearance of Planet 14 was just a coincidence.\u201d The Galactic beast didn\u2019t swallow it directly but had instead opened a devouring portal in its mouth, setting it there temporarily for digestion in the future. However, his cub\u2019s ability filled the portal, squeezing the planet out.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut everyone thought I did it.\u201d</p><br/><p>She was already prepared for the headlines tomorrow.</p><br/><p>#Shocking news! A superhuman female bloodling, treating planets as yo-yos at the border of the Galaxy!#</p><br/><p>Didn\u2019t it seem insane?</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d Mu Xuan reached out to caress her hair, comforting her once more. \u201cIf you aren\u2019t willing, no one will remember your face.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh?\u201d Yao Si asked in confusion. What did he mean?</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll blur their impression of you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou mean\u2026 using your mental strength?\u201d Oh right, Mu Xuan could use his mental ability to swap out his appearance, so he could naturally do that for her as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cYea!\u201d He nodded, and it wasn\u2019t just his mental ability, either. A moment ago he had deleted all the footage from the space station. Others would just be aware that someone had smashed the galactic beast to death, but they wouldn\u2019t know that it had been her.</p><br/><p>Yao Si was overwhelmed. The weird stares left her, and even though she could still hear heated discussions, they no longer centered around her. Yao Si finally calmed down, and her energy returned once more now that her image was intact.</p><br/><p>\u201cDad!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMu Xuan!\u201d he corrected once more, feeling the headache of having pampered his own cub.</p><br/><p>\u201cDaddy Mu.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d He sighed and his head to glance at the time. Straightening, he said, \u201cLet\u2019s go home for dinner.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d Yao Si followed behind cheerfully. However, they bumped into Huo Qi at the door.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re leaving so fast?\u201d Huo Qi looked at them in surprise. \u201cAren\u2019t you going to wait for the rewards from the Alliance?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not waiting.\u201d The reward wasn\u2019t their aim anyways.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy not! The Alliance won\u2019t make it up to you.\u201d Huo Qi frowned, not understanding the rich men\u2019s world. He added, \u201cI heard that the galactic beast had reached stage seven, so the rewards will definitely be substantial. Besides\u2026\u201d He suppressed his voice, then continued mysteriously, \u201cSince I was far away, I didn\u2019t witness it, but there was an incredible person that lifted Planet 14 and smashed it against the galactic beast. That was a stage seven beast! We must have been lucky to have met such an incredible person. Now, without even putting in any effort, we\u2019ll be able to receive an award, and a substantial one at that. That person might also smash the next beast, so maybe you two should wait for a little more?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si\u2019s face hardened. <em>Good day bro, goodbye bro!</em></p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re in a rush, so we\u2019ll be really leaving now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Alright,\u201d Hyo Qi said with regret. After a moment, he sent her a message. [After I receive the reward, I\u2019ll send it over. It isn\u2019t easy to get here, so don\u2019t waste your efforts.]</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Yao Si replied nonchalantly, following after Mu Xuan.</p><br/><p>There wasn\u2019t a direct portal at the border of the Galaxy, but with Mu Xuan beside her, they returned back at a breakneck speed. He waved in the air, opening a passageway that sent them straight to the nearest galactic door, and in less than two minutes, they were back home.</p><br/><p>Yao Si had an impulse to keep Mu Xuan with her at all times\u2014it would definitely save her a lot of transport cost!</p>\n</div>"}

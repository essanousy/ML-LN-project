As for the experiments\u2026 we weren\u2019t awake.\u201d A hint of confusion tainted the man\u2019s expression. \u201cBut I once realized that they were contacting a certain location every once in a while to report their progress. I\u2019m sure there\u2019ll be records somewhere.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere can we find the records?\u201d</p><br/><p>Any clues of communication would be great. They could use them to trace the origin of the organization.</p><br/><p>\u201cI know, it\u2019s in the control room!\u201d one of the bloodlings shouted out, pointing towards the room that had collapsed. \u201cI\u2019ve been investigating the Galactic network for the longest time, so I could hack into their system.\u201d</p><br/><p><em>Great! </em> \u201cI\u2019ll have to trouble you then, let\u2019s go!\u201d</p><br/><p>The bloodling nodded, excited to have received such a compliment. He followed Yao Si enthusiastically. Even though he had no idea who she was, he seemed delighted to have received her praise.</p><br/><p>All the blooldings followed behind as well. In less than a heartbeat, the tiny room was packed and there were still bloodlings that had failed to squeeze in.</p><br/><p>The person who had stepped out before seemed to be rather educated. After inspecting the equipment, he pressed something. Suddenly, the entire room lit up, and screens popped up everywhere.</p><br/><p>The bloodling pulled over a chair, but just as he was about to start decoding, he seemed to have thought of something and pushed the chair towards Yao Si. In a slightly nervous voice, he said, \u201cPlea-please take a seat.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou take a seat, we\u2019ll have to depend on you to decode this!\u201d Yao Si pressed him down onto the chair.</p><br/><p>The bloodling didn\u2019t waste another second and started to type furiously. Being totally clueless about the futuristic technology, Yao Si had no clue as to what he was doing, she just stared at the screen with a myriad of unknown letters in confusion.</p><br/><p>However, the confident expression soon started to slip from the coder\u2019s face. It was gradually replaced by one of guilt.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTh-this communication device is one-sided, they can only send out information. Besides, they used an entirely different network, not the Galactic network. Every time they contact the other side, the information will be deleted and impossible to trace. Even though the other party\u2019s account is present, it changes regularly. There should be a specific pattern they use to determine the new account, but it won\u2019t be known to others. I can crack into the defense system to switch off the self-destruct mechanism, but what concerns the other party, I can\u2019t help with it,\u201d he said with a scrunched up face.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhich means we won\u2019t be able to find them?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYe-yes, I apologize!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not your fault, thank you for your hard work.\u201d Yao Si never expected to find the mastermind so easily, especially after witnessing the scale of the research base. Just as Perverted Lu had said, this was only a small portion of Euphoria. Such a large organization would definitely make no mistakes in their communications.</p><br/><p>But\u2026 the trip couldn\u2019t be called a success if they didn\u2019t do anything. She started to tremble uncontrollably once the images from before resurfaced in her mind.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf we were to send a message to all the accounts present, would they be able to receive it?\u201d Yao Si asked.</p><br/><p>The bloodling nodded instantly. \u201cYes, yes\u2026 but\u2026 we still wouldn\u2019t be able to trace them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine! Open all the channels they have, I have a few words for this Euphoria organization.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA-all of them? Alright!\u201d He turned and started to work on the device, then after some time turned back. \u201cIt\u2019s done.\u201d</p><br/><p>Light flashed in front of her, and her body was reflected onto the screen. Yao Si then took a step forward and after a deep breath began speaking.</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone in Euphoria listen up. I\u2019m Yao Si, a fifth generation bloodling of the Red Planet! Your actions have violated my race\u2019s pride, and I don\u2019t care what you intend to do or who you are, but I formally declare war against you with my fifth generation bloodline! We will find you, all actions against the bloodlings will be repaid in surplus. Regardless of how noble your excuses may be, we will never succumb. Even if it\u2019s the whole Galaxy, we won\u2019t mind taking it out entirely!\u201d</p><br/><p>Her expression remained the same, serious and calm, but her next words were more spat out than said. \u201cCherish the peace you have now, for you shall feel the wrath of my entire race! Remember my words, they\u2019re no warning or threat, we<em>are </em>coming!\u201d</p>\n</div>"}

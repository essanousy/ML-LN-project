What\u2019s that?\u201d Yao Si stared ahead with her mouth agape. The entire area was covered with black holes that looked like bug holes.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey\u2019re devouring portals.\u201d Bai Yi paled as he stared blankly at the black holes that littered the area. \u201cThe presence of all these black holes can only be explained by the planet being situated on a space node, but I would have never expected the Elders Council to place a checkpoint in such a location.\u201d</p><br/><p>There was a possibility of getting torn apart at the slightest touch, which was a little too brutal for a test. Yet such a tricky spot happened to be their first stop.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh, the checkpoint seems to be over there!\u201d Li Zheng pointed ahead.</p><br/><p>Yao Si raised her head and saw that not too far away there was indeed a red machine floating on top of a massive rock. Above it was a striking red sign: Checkpoint!</p><br/><p>They weren\u2019t too far from it, only around some hundred meters, but between were about ten black holes, some of which were moving.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do we do?\u201d Bai Yi hesitated. \u201cDo we give up on this checkpoint?\u201d It seemed too dangerous.</p><br/><p>Yao Si calculated the time mentally. \u201cWe should give it a try since we are already here.\u201d It had taken them close to half a month just to reach this checkpoint, so it would be a waste to just walk away. Moreover, there were nine more checkpoints to go.</p><br/><p>\u201cBai Yi, help me scan these black holes and find the pattern of their motion. Once that\u2019s done, maybe you could calculate the safe path?\u201d</p><br/><p>On a closer inspection, there seemed to be a pattern to the movement of the holes. If they were to flit about at a fast speed, they could possibly get through them.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is possible\u2026\u201d Bai Yi frowned. \u201cBut my optical computer is restricted, so even if I wanted to calculate\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUse mine!\u201d Yao Si removed her optical computer and stuffed it in his hands, allowing him access.</p><br/><p>\u201cGreat, leave it to me!\u201d Bai Yi slammed his chest before starting to type rapidly on her optical computer. After about half an hour, his face lit up with joy.</p><br/><p>\u201cI found it!\u201d He enlarged the map and pointed at it. \u201cYour Highness, the situation is much better than expected. There aren\u2019t any devouring portals in the air, so we can move about in the stratosphere before heading down. We would be able to avoid all the black holes like that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood job! What are we waiting for then?\u201d Bai Yi\u2019s words were as expected of a tech savvy nerd. Yao Si stuck her thumb up in compliment before heading back to the mini flying devices. \u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Yi and Li Zheng followed behind, ascending after her. As expected, the sky didn\u2019t have the same dense collection of black holes, so they flew about a hundred meters ahead before cautiously making a descent toward the checkpoint. Between them were two mid-sized black holes which they managed to avoid easily.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re here!\u201d Bai Yi exclaimed. As he had hoped, following after Her Highness had its benefits.</p><br/><p>After landing on the massive rock, Yao Si saw a sensor-like object floating nearby.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get it signed!\u201d Bai Yi headed toward it and placed his hand on the sensor. A cold electronic announcement greeted him.</p><br/><p>[Ding! Bloodling Bai Yi\u2019s checkpoint marked! Total number of checkpoints completed: One!]</p><br/><p>Li Zheng came forward hurriedly and mimicked Bai Yi by tapping the sensor.</p><br/><p>[Ding! Bloodling Li Zheng\u2019s checkpoint marked. Total number of checkpoints completed: One!]</p><br/><p>Yao Si sighed in relief; it wasn\u2019t a wasted trip after all. She placed her hand over the sensor, but unlike before, an enthusiastic and overly friendly response came bursting through the announcer.</p><br/><p>[Her Highness Yao Si\u2019s of our race coming of age checkpoint marked! Congratulations Your Highness, congratulations Your Highness! The first checkpoint you successfully completed is the devouring portal checkpoint with S level difficulty! This little checkpoint is happy, oh!</p><br/><p>[Your Highness is indeed equipped with strong abilities that no one can catch up to. For the millions of years to come, you will be the number one! Press on! Checkpoint no.23 will support you spiritually! Go forth to the remaining nine checkpoints. You Highness\u2019 next goal can only be the vast ocean among the stars!]</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p><em>What the f*ck is with such a stark contrast in the announcement? Why was mine so different from the others? Who came up with such a ridiculous script?! </em></p><br/><p>(\u256f\u2035\u25a1\u2032)\u256f\ufe35\u253b\u2501\u253b</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Bai Yi. <em>The checkpoint seems to be discriminating against us! </em></p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Li Zheng. +1</p><br/><p>\u201cForget it, let\u2019s leave this place\u2026\u201d <em>We can settle the scores when we\u2019re back.</em></p><br/><p>Yao Si was about to gather everyone into the flying device when a sudden familiar force came surging within her. Wasn\u2019t it\u2026 her ability?</p><br/><p>\u201cBe careful!\u201d Yao Si shouted our, turning to pull the two add-ons over. They fell and started tumbling down the massive rock.</p><br/><p>The next second, a large chunk of the spot where the checkpoint floated was eaten by a massive beast, abd even the biased checkpoint was gone. Replacing it was a black hole about four meters in diameter and spiraling about maniacally, devouring everything it touched.</p><br/><p><em>F*ck, weren\u2019t the black holes not supposed to be here?!</em></p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a hidden portal!\u201d Bai Yi ignored the pain from the hit on his head as his face clouded with shock. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect this place to posses such an engulfing portal. I wasn\u2019t able to scan it previously since it appears in intervals!</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Highness, do you have any flying machines?\u201d Bai Yi calmed himself as he turned to ask her. He really didn\u2019t want to be sucked into the portal.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan\u2019t take it out!\u201d Yao Si shook her head. \u201cIt\u2019s too big. The moment I\u2019ll take it out, half of it will be engulfed by the black portal.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are we going to do then?\u201d Bai Yi started to panic as the portal began to enlarge, its suction power growing in strength. The wind scraped his skin like daggers. They could barely stand on their feet, but they couldn\u2019t turn back either, since there were many holes behind them as well. \u201cDo we give up?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si bit down on her lip, pondering about their problem before replying, \u201cWhy don\u2019t I\u2026 use my ability?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh right, Your Highness\u2019 space ability!\u201d Bai Yi\u2019s eyes lit up, and he looked at her with a bright gaze. \u201cThe energy can cancel itself out. Your Highness, you just have to create a portal about the same size as that black hole for it to disappear.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Zheng\u2019s eyes lit up as well, and her turned to gaze at Yao Si in amazement. \u201cDad, I didn\u2019t know you had such a strong ability. You\u2019re amazing!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are indeed worthy of being Your Highness, what a reliable presence. We\u2019ll leave everything to you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDad, go for it! Son has faith in you!\u201d</p><br/><p>The corners of Yao Si\u2019s lips twitched. <em>Do you guys\u2026 have some sort of misconception about my ability?</em></p><br/><p>And\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you stop calling me dad, we can still be friends!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p></div>\n</div>"}

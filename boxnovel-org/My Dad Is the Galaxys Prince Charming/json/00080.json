Where are you heading to?\u201d Even though they were out of the ninth district, they were still close to the seventh district which was considered dangerous. She had to try and get another ride.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have anywhere I need to go at the moment, so I\u2019m not in a hurry anywhere.\u201d He glanced at her then, and after hesitating slightly said, \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019m willing to send you back to your quarters before leaving!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have to trouble you.\u201d She had been waiting for that offer. \u201cI won\u2019t stand on ceremony, let\u2019s go!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d He immediately brought her along. Senior must be injured, but knowing that I\u2019d worry, she didn\u2019t have the heart to tell me. She is indeed a noble person. \u201cSenior, do you have anywhere you need to be?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet me take a look!\u201d Yao Si had no clue about his thoughts, so she just opened the map and pointed to the right corner. \u201cHere\u2026 1456 km from where we are now, so it should be about half an hour away.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2026\u201d Zan Zichen stilled, his sword stopping as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy? Is it not convenient for you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 No!\u201d He shook his head. \u201cIt isn\u2019t inconvenient, I\u2019ll send you there right this moment.\u201d He headed forward at high speed. Regardless of the situation, he had to send her there, even if\u2026</p><br/><p>Yao Si was confused but suppressed her curiosity.</p><br/><p>Zan Zichen was an image of worry, even taking a wrong turn once. She asked if he wanted to stop since she could walk there herself, but he objected the idea instantly.</p><br/><p>After about half an hour, they finally reached the third district, getting close to the destination on the map. At that moment, Zan Zichen hesitated slightly before asking, \u201cSenior Si, are you heading to Shi Fang sect?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shi Fang sect? Yao Si stilled. She just wanted to head to the service centre located on the map to ask what exactly had happened. <em>It\u2019s actually a sect?</em></p><br/><p>\u201cI should\u2026 be,\u201d she replied. Instantly, Zan Zichen\u2019s face paled and his gaze flickered sideways. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? It isn\u2019t convenient for you? Why not\u2026\u201d<em>I\u2019ll go myself, okay! You look like you\u2019re about to faint!</em></p><br/><p>He forced out a smile, but did not look straight at her. \u201cIt\u2019s fine, we\u2019re about to reach it. I\u2019ll bring you over.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zan Zichen sped up, and soon they reached a gigantic stone wall. At the top of it were the words \u2018Shi Fang\u2019 in italics, and the optical computer indicated that they were at the right location.</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior, I\u2019d like to thank you for your help once again.\u201d He bowed deeply. \u201cThere\u2019s some animosity between me and Shi Fang sect\u2026 It won\u2019t be good for me to stay here any longer. I shall take my leave, take care senior.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh\u2026 Oh!\u201d <em>He is leaving just like that, I see. </em> Yao Si waved her hand. \u201cTake care, good bye!\u201d</p><br/><p>He nodded before flying away in a hurry. However, just as he was about to fly off, the ground started to glow, exposing a large drawing that was about a few meters wide. Something jumped out from it, hitting the person in mid-air.</p><br/><p>Zan Zichen\u2019s feet slipped, and he fell down.</p><br/><p>Yao Si jumped, rushing over to help him up. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><br/><p>He kept silent, but just then, a rude shout came from the wall ahead.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho is it? How dare you trespass Shi Fang sect!\u201d</p><br/><p>With a deafening sound, the doors with the two big words split open, exposing a passageway.</p><br/><p>The stone wall is actually an automated door!</p>\n</div>"}

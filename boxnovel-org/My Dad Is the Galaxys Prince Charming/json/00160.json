As expected from the Yao Family elder, he managed to finish his investigations in less than a day.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Highness, for the past year, there haven\u2019t been anything unusual about the Galactic beasts that have appeared in the borders. Regardless of the level and the number of times they appeared, it\u2019s all similar to the past few years.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou mean there aren\u2019t any issues at the abyss?\u201d Yao Si stilled. What he was saying wasn\u2019t logical.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Highness, that\u2019s how it seems on the surface.\u201d Yao Qian\u2019s expression sank.</p><br/><p>\u201cSurface? What do you mean?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s like this!\u201d He suddenly sent a bunch of data over. \u201cAfter comparing with the number of appearances made by the Galactic beasts in the past fifteen years, I found that there is indeed an increase in the past year. Previously, there would only be one for every few years, but this year, there has already been three. Besides, other than the increased frequency, there is also another anomaly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Yao Si asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Majesty, Your Highness, please take a look\u2026\u201d He tapped open the galactic map and started to operate at the side. Pointing toward the red dots, he explained, \u201cThese are the Galactic beasts that appeared in the abyss for the past few years, and these are the three that appeared this year.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si looked between the two different groups of beasts again and again, but there didn\u2019t seem to be any difference?</p><br/><p>\u201cIs\u2026 there a difference?\u201d It looked the same to her.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the position,\u201d Mu Xuan said with a frown, his voice grave. \u201cFor the past few years, even though the beasts have been appearing at random, it would usually be on the asteroid belt or near planets. But this year, they have been appearing closer to the borders and nowhere near any planets.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d No planets?Then what are they doing there?</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Yao Qian added hurriedly. \u201cI\u2019ve asked the person in charge of the space station. He mentioned that the three Galactic beasts found this year were noticed by the patrol team in the same district with less than one light-year distance between them. They seem\u2026 to have come out of the abyss together. If this is true, then\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are more Galactic beasts in the abyss,\u201d Mu Xuan finished.</p><br/><p>Yao Si\u2019s heart sank. Those were beasts that could swallow a planet in just one bite. If there were more of them, then\u2026 the enter Galaxy could be destroyed!</p><br/><p>\u201cI understand. Don\u2019t take any action yet! I\u2019ll head over right now,\u201d Mu Xuan instructed before switching the messenger off. Turning to face Yao Si, he said, \u201cSisi, I have to head over to settle this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t go this time!\u201d Before she could finish her sentence, Mu Xuan dashed her dreams of following him.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Yao Si stilled. Didn\u2019t you promise to never leave me behind?</p><br/><p>\u201cThe abyss is too dangerous, I\u2019m afraid I won\u2019t be able to take care of you.\u201d He reached out to caress her head, his expression solemn. \u201cThe situation there isn\u2019t clear, and I won\u2019t be able to focus with you around so just be good. I\u2019ll be gone for around half a day, maybe a bit more.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Oh.\u201d She nodded. She could understand his reasoning. It wasn\u2019t as though she was an unreasonable bimbo.</p><br/><p>But\u2026 he isn\u2019t going to let me join in on the fun!</p><br/><p>(\u256f^\u2570)</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen I\u2019m not at home, remember to have your meals on time, to not to stay up late, and tdo not surf the galactic web for ten hours each day.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, yes, yes\u2026 Nanny dad!\u201d She\u2019ll only use it for nine hours.</p><br/><p>\u201cMu Xuan!\u201d he corrected her out of habit. \u201cAnd the most important thing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMmh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t pick up calls from strangers, especially from women!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Can\u2019t you just tell me not to pick up calls from Lian Yu?</p><br/><p>\u256d\u2229\u256e\uff08\ufe36\ufe3f\ufe36\uff09\u256d\u2229\u256e</p><br/><p>It\u2019s been happening for such a long time, so why aren\u2019t you over it yet?</p><br/><p>After nagging for a while more and getting multiple reassurances from Yao Si that she was going to stay on the Red Planet did he finally leave through a space portal. Just as he entered, Yao Si reached out to grab onto his sleeve to remind him once more.</p><br/><p>\u201cMu Xuan, aren\u2019t you forgetting something?\u201d</p><br/><p>He stilled, his face reddening as a thought crossed his mind. The flush kept increasing in intensity as his gaze wavered.</p><br/><p>\u201cAhem!Si-Sisi, this\u2026\u201d He choked as he took a step back.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou agreed to this.\u201d Yao Si took a step forward with a radiant smile on her face, almost pressing against him as she lifted her head.</p><br/><p>The flush deepened, the shade so deep it seemed be on the verge of reaching crimson. Mu Xuan stared at her face intently, until after half a second, he seemed to have made up his mind. He bent down and lowered his lips onto hers before escaping into the space portal, the entire process lasting about as long as a blink of an eye.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Yao Si. Am I some sort of virus?</p><br/><p>After his \u2018bleeding\u2019 incident during their first kiss, she was sure that a certain someone had been single for far too long, which caused a lack of experience.</p><br/><p>In order to prevent him from keeping all his emotions to himself due to his shyness, she seduced him, <em>ahem.. </em>. shameless\u2026 ah pssh! She spoke earnestly and sincerely in a systematic manner to agree on a suitable solution.</p><br/><p>The crux of the solution: Experience. They just had to\u2026 kiss more often.</p><br/><p>\u256e(\u256f\u25bd\u2570)\u256d</p><br/><p>Hence, they made up a series of events\u2014good morning kiss, goodnight kiss, goodbye kiss\u2026</p><br/><p><em>Mmh, the goodbye kiss was only late by an hour. </em>It seemed like an improvement when compared to the morning kiss that only came after her nap\u2026</p><br/><p><em>Eh?</em></p><br/><p>Wait a minute! Wasn\u2019t he pinching his nose when he left?</p><br/><p>-_-|||</p><br/><p><em>Improvement retracted!</em></p><br/><p>Yao Si sighed. <em>Mission failed\u2026 </em>She had to try harder! Just as she was about to research 101 ways to teach one\u2019s boyfriend, the portal that had just disappeared opened up once more.</p><br/><p>\u201cSisi.\u201d Mu Xuan was suddenly back again. \u201cI forgot the previous times\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He dragged her into his embrace and lowered his lips down onto hers. Yao Si stood stunned. Before she could react, she felt a stinging on her lips. She inhaled swiftly.</p><br/><p><em>It hurts!</em></p><br/><p>The next second, he had already released her. \u201cThat\u2019s enough.\u201d Turning, he left with the portal disappearing behind him.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d A startled Yao Si.</p><br/><p>What did that mean?</p><br/><p>He turned back halfway just to bite her? Or\u2026 did he have any opinion about her accumulating experience methods?</p><br/><p>o(&gt;\ufe4f&lt;)o</p><br/><p>Just as Yao Si got lost in her thoughts, the doorbell rang. It seemed to be something urgent, since the ringing kept on increasing in intensity and frequency. When she opened the door, she found Gu Shucheng who she hadn\u2019t met in a long time.</p><br/><p>\u201cNephew Gu, you are back from your honeymoon\u2014\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Highness, is His Majesty at home?\u201d he interrupted her uncharacteristically, his face panicky as he glanced around the room for Mu Xuan.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe just left.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He started to panic. \u201cDid he say where he is going? Your Highness, can you get a hold of him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe abyss at the borders\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy is he there! There isn\u2019t even reception there\u2026 Ah! Why is he there at such a crucial time!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? What\u2019s the rush?\u201d Yao Si asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Highness\u2026\u201d His hands formed into fists at his side, and his face became serious. \u201cRed Planet is in trouble!\u201d</p><br/><p><em>What?</em></p></div>\n</div>"}

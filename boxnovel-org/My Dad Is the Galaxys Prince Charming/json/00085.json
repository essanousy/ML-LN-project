To play it safe, Yao Si made him wait at the service person\u2019s room until his wounds got better before leaving.</p><br/><p>As for Sect Leader Yu, she couldn\u2019t be sure whether he would cause trouble in the future as it was limited what she could do.</p><br/><p>After the matter was settled, the service crew member ensured that there wasn\u2019t anyone else before starting on his duty. He was called Qiao Bu, similar to a certain someone that sold fruits.</p><br/><p>After hearing Mr. Qiao\u2019s explanation, Yao Si understood that she had been sent to the wrong destination because of the booth she registered at, that booth was meant for the training of celestials themselves.</p><br/><p>If the third district was considered beginner level, then the ninth district was hell, even celestials themselves rarely went there.</p><br/><p>Yao Si recalled the old promoter. He must have deliberately misled her toward the wrong booth. His behavior was simply disgusting. No wonder he didn\u2019t have any business.</p><br/><p>Mr. Qiao expressed his utmost regret for what happened, helping her to complaint about the matter to the regulation office before informing her of the main points. There was also a document for her to sign, an indemnity form before the registration was completed.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is the beginner guide.\u201d He passed her a jade-like square piece, signaling for her to press it against her head.</p><br/><p>Yao Si hesitated slightly before reaching out to grab it and pressing it between her brows. Right then, an influx of information entered her brain; it was much faster than studying. She could understand the information and what she should take note of during the training. There was even a line that warned them to limit their interactions with the indigenous tribes and prohibited them from bringing locals out of their area.</p><br/><p>There was also an explanation in the end.</p><br/><p>Basically, the locals were considered celestials\u2019 backup troops, warriors of the celestial realm. It was just like how bloodlings had to convert humans. Celestials were born as part of the indigenous tribes, and only after they reached 3S rank would they be considered as true members of the celestial race. The locals called it: Flight Upgrade!</p><br/><p>If the training of indigenous tribes was disrupted, it might aid them in walking out of the planet. Since they had a special physique, it might attract the atomic thunder from the planet nearby, and if they weren\u2019t of 3S rank yet, they might be killed by the thunder. There was a chance that others might be implicated as well.</p><br/><p>Hence, people that came for training were expected not to interact with the indigenous tribes. Besides, with the limited training time and high costs, they wouldn\u2019t be around for long.</p><br/><p>\u201cI understand.\u201d Yao Si nodded. \u201cI will adhere to it from now on.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGreat, you should rest early today before the training begins tomorrow.\u201d Mr. Qiao smiled. \u201cI\u2019ll head out now. I wish you a pleasant training.\u201d Turning away, he headed out.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe four of you, stop!\u201d Yao Si ordered, stopping the four figures that were inching out the door.</p><br/><p>Mr. Qiao turned, caressing his swollen eye while flying off at high speed. Curiosity killed the cat, so he wasn\u2019t going to stay around. Just this morning, the four of them had come with a murderous aura; the memory of it still sent a shiver down his spine. With such a terrifying combat ability, he couldn\u2019t be sure which race they belonged to.</p><br/><p>Yao Si took in a deep breath, glancing over at the four unfamiliar faces. \u201cNow, which generation are you guys, and who sent you?\u201d</p>\n</div>"}

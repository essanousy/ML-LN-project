Although she hadn\u2019t found the way yet, that wasn\u2019t a big issue. Even if she couldn\u2019t quit, when the class was over, the teacher would find out about her condition and disconnect the internet for her.</p><br/><p>She should take ten thousand steps back and assess this issue. Even if the teachers of this school let young people stray from the right path and let her continue playing, there would be a moment when the school was over; the teacher couldn\u2019t just let her stay in the game forever.</p><br/><p>Thus, there was no need to panic, all one needed to do was wait.</p><br/><p>However\u2026</p><br/><p>These ten thousand steps that Yao Si took were still too few.</p><br/><p>At the same moment in the classroom\u2026</p><br/><p>One has to see that bloodlings were quite efficient. Within ten minutes of receiving Yan Xuan\u2019s notice, all bloodlings of the first forty generations on the Red Planet had arrived, while those that were not on the red planet were all on their way back.</p><br/><p>Yan Xuan cleared the site right away.</p><br/><p>The formidable array of people filled the classroom to its brims. With mentalities of stress, uneasiness, excitement, and pilgrimage, they all looked at Yao Si who was closed-eyed, immersing herself in the game.</p><br/><p>The scene was oddly quiet.</p><br/><p>This\u2026 This was the fifth-generation ancestor?!</p><br/><p>In this era, finding a fifth-generation bloodling was simply a miracle.</p><br/><p>Everyone on the scene had one common feeling at that moment \u2013 their feet were a little weak.</p><br/><p>They wanted to touch her, to see if she was real!</p><br/><p>After all, bloodlings were a species which viewed bloodline with utmost priority. It was different from the sort of respect other species had morally and culturally, for the strength of bloodlings originated from their bloodlines.</p><br/><p>Due to some rare unusual circumstances, the more condensed the bloodline was, the stronger the person\u2019s abilities were, and the density of the bloodlines came from the earlier generations. The closer the generation to the original one, the purer the bloodline. Therefore, bloodlings of higher generations would naturally have bloodline suppression against those from later generations. By theory, bloodlings from later generations would have a subconscious obedience to bloodlings from earlier generations, and it would require a lot of effort to break away from the desires of the higher ranked bloodlings.</p><br/><p>Yan Xuan finally understood why when he received the news of Yao Si from the Space Station while he was visiting the Celestial race, despite having been a few galaxies away from the milky way, he had subconsciously taken a detour and picked the person up himself.</p><br/><p>This was the traction of bloodlines! Even if her highness didn\u2019t release any bloodline ability, as a descendant, he would go and pick her up on his own will because she was a fifth generation! The only fifth generation in the entire galaxy!</p><br/><p>Yan Xuan felt a sense of personal pride rising from within him at that moment. If he added finding the fifth generation highness onto his resume, that would be something which every bloodling would be most jealous of, for it was not one of, but the only such event in existence.</p><br/><p>Even if he didn\u2019t recognize the ancestor at first sight, that can be forgiven. Hum\u2026 Probably?</p><br/><p>\u201cMinister Yan, what do you think we should do now?\u201d The first in command of the Red Planet, Marshal of the Bloodlings Nie Zihang, who was almost kneeling on the ground, couldn\u2019t stand it anymore. He pushed Yan Xuan. \u201cDo we wake her highness?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo! No!\u201d Before Yan Xuan could even respond, another bloodling quickly gave the choice \u2018No\u2019 a vote. \u201cHer highness went into the galactic network games to relax, how could we disturb her elderly self.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat you are saying is correct\u2026\u201d Nie Zihang was still a little unsure. \u201cBut what happens if she doesn\u2019t come out, we can\u2019t just keep on waiting like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>As soon as his words were heard by others, they immediately incited a mass rage.</p><br/><p>\u201cMarshal Nie, you are so insensible. What\u2019s wrong with waiting for a while? It\u2019s her highness! The only highness in the world.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIndeed, if it wasn\u2019t her highness willingly appearing here, let\u2019s not say you a fortieth generation, even us a bunch of thirtieth generation old bones would have no chance in meeting her fifth-generation highness self.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, it\u2019s our honor to be able to see her highness.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, how could we disturb our highness\u2019s refined interest.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if we have to wait here a hundred years for her highness to be willing to see us, we are all willing to do that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, no matter how long I will continue waiting!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMe too!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCount me in\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly, responses continued one after another, the people\u2019s eyes staring at Yao Si becoming more and more passionate. They looked as if they were unable to pull themselves away from her, having all become newly promoted fangirls and fanboys.</p><br/><p>Every \u201cbody\u201d <sup>1</sup> : Ah, that\u2019s our highness, she looks\u2026 So pretty! Really want to see what it feels like to clutch to her thigh <sup>2</sup> .</p><br/><p>As to bloodling political affairs\u2026 What are those? Are they edible?</p><br/><p>_______</p><br/><p>At the same time, Yao Si was trapped in the game and waiting for technical assistance.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>She had been waiting on the same spot for two hours, yet her optical computer had not the slightest response, let alone quitting the game.</p><br/><p>Even the red-named boy that was initially talking to her had given up half an hour ago. He saluted her, said a bunch of strange words looking somewhat angry, then threw her a red talisman and disappeared.</p><br/><p>From then onward, she kept feeling that her shoulder was heavy. She was no longer at ease when she walked.</p><br/><p>She suspected that maybe the boy had given her some negative buff from the rage caused by communication failure. Picking up the red talisman and carefully examining all sorts of wriggly symbols on it, she tried desperately to decipher what they meant.</p><br/><p>Hum, just as she had expected, couldn\u2019t understand it!</p><br/><p>[From system authentication, this is an Artificial Intelligence Player, and has been added to the black list! Punishment: HP-5. This condition can be relieved by gaining reputation from doing missions.]</p><br/><p>Yao Si had given up on trying to study the galactic dialect of the future from the start and had become slightly agitated. According to reason, the class should be long over by now. Even if the teacher really didn\u2019t realize that she was still in the game, the school was probably about to be over too? Or maybe the school hours of future kindergartens were longer?</p><br/><p>She surveyed her surroundings and quickly realized a possibility, what if the time in the game was different from the time in real life?</p><br/><p>Her heart fell to the bottom of a pit. With the experience from all the gaming novels she had read in the 21st century, that was in fact extremely likely.</p><br/><p>Yes, it must be that. It looked like she would have to continue staying in this game.</p><br/><p>Now that Yao Si found the reason, she let out a long sigh and stood up. She couldn\u2019t sit here forever. Since she had nothing to do, there was no harm in playing around a bit.</p><br/><p>Despite not knowing the mechanics of this game, with her over ten years of online gaming experience, all the missions in the newbie village should be easy. Or that\u2019s what she thought as she walked straight into the village.</p><br/><p>Maybe it was because she had been in a daze for too long, there were much fewer players in the newbie village but occasionally she could still see one or two people.</p><br/><p>Due to language barriers, she couldn\u2019t find anyone to imitate.</p><br/><p>She could only wander aimlessly in the village, so she did exactly that, yet she still didn\u2019t find any place to do missions. That was until she came to a butcher stall and saw a green-named player handing a rabbit to the owner of the butchery, receiving two talismans in return from the owner.</p><br/><p>Rabbits!</p><br/><p>Yao Si\u2019s eyes gleamed with light. Could it be the essential rabbit killing mission that every single newbie village had? She had finally found it.</p><br/><p>She quickly walked to the stall front and prepared to accept any mission.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy client, you look so unfamiliar, first time at the Village of Mystic Hares? What would you like to buy?\u201d the NPC <sup>3</sup> of the butchery eagerly greeted.</p><br/><p>The illiterate Yao Si only heard a long strand of \uffe5%\uffe5\u2026&amp;\u2026&amp;#@.</p><br/><p>Yes, this must be the introduction to the mission.</p><br/><p>Seeing that she didn\u2019t respond for some time, the owner of the butcher stall was quite confused, but as a professional NPC, he continued to enthusiastically explain, \u201cWhat meat would you like to have? You can rest assured that all my meat here is absolutely fresh.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Silence.</p><br/><p>\u201cWould you like some beef, lamb, or pork?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d <em>Keep pretending that you can understand. </em></p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t like those? I have newly arrived rabbit meat as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d <em>Is the mission briefing still not over yet? </em></p><br/><p>\u201cMy client, are you not ordering some? You can let your heart be at ease, I Qin have been in this industry for tens of years, there\u2019s a guarantee on the quality. The meat has no single bit of adulteration!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d <em>Such a long mission introduction. </em></p><br/><p>\u201cLook! Last year I was named the \u201cModel Worker\u201d in the village, here I still have the certificate of honor!\u201d he said as he pulled out a piece of wooden plaque with pride and passed it forth.</p><br/><p>Receiving the wooden plaque, Yao Si finally let out a long breath. She had finally received the mission. She turned and walked straight out of the village.</p><br/><p><em>Yes, I can finally start killing the bunnies, the NPCs here are so talkative. </em></p><br/><p>The owner who was robbed of his certificate of honor was left speechless. What was happening? Who was he? Where was he?</p><br/><p>\u201cMy client, client come back, that\u2019s not for sale! My client!\u201d</p><br/><p>Sadly, Yao Si had already left the village.</p>\n</div>"}

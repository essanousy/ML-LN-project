When they entered, the hall was already packed to the brim with around a hundred thousand students. There was no question about this school being the \u2018first\u2019.</p><br/><p>Gu Shucheng led Yao Si towards the left side of the hall and was fortunate enough to find a front row seat. The other seats were almost fully occupied, with the surrounding students dressed in the same green uniform as her.</p><br/><p>However, Gu Shucheng, who sat to her right, was dressed in blue. After they sat down, Yao Si could vaguely sense that the other students had quietened, their gazes peeking over at them.</p><br/><p>Yao Si scanned her surroundings. The Teacher Appreciation Hall could be separated into three sections. The extreme left was dressed in the same green uniform as her, the section in the middle had a yellow and white uniform, while the section on the right was dressed in the same blue uniform Gu Shucheng. It probably served as a distinction for the three school levels.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can go on if you\u2019re busy.\u201d Nephew Gu was probably from the high school level, so she couldn\u2019t possibly make him sit with her at the elementary level. \u201cDon\u2019t worry! I\u2019ll be fine by myself.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gu Shucheng hesitated slightly, but he seemed to really have something to tend to, for after a short while he nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll come get Your Highness once the ceremony ends.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, right, hurry now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Reluctantly, he stood up and walked away, though he still sent several glances full of worry back at her. Yet instead of heading to the right side of the hall, he walked toward the stage at the front.</p><br/><p><em>Ah?</em></p><br/><p>Before Yao Si could process this information, she was tugged at by the person beside her.</p><br/><p>\u201cStudent, what\u2019s your relationship with the president of the student union?\u201d a girl from another race with two antennas on her head asked curiosuly.</p><br/><p>Yao Si stilled. \u201cPresident of the student union?!\u201d <em>Gu Shucheng?</em></p><br/><p>\u201cYea!\u201d The girl\u2019s curiosity deepened, and those around also turned to stare at Yao Si. \u201cBefore I came to report, I heard some seniors saying that Senior Gu has been president for the past five terms. During each of the five elections, he won with 100% of the votes. I\u2019m sure this time will be no exception.\u201d</p><br/><p><em>Little Sudent Gu is a model student that excels in both his moral conduct and education? </em></p><br/><p>\u201cYes, yes,\u201d another female student added. \u201cTell us more, when did you guys meet?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe met today,\u201d Yao Si replied honestly.</p><br/><p>The surrounding students stilled, their gazes turning complex, especially those of the girls. Infuriated, one asked, \u201cStop kidding, how could he be so nice to you if it\u2019s the first time you met? Everyone knows that Senior Gu is a bloodling, and they don\u2019t ever interact with anyone outside their race, yet he personally brought you over. What\u2019s your relationship?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEr\u2026 He\u2019s my nephew.\u201d Nephew Gu seemed to be rather popular.</p><br/><p>The girl that had spoke froze. \u201cYou\u2026 you\u2019re a bloodling!\u201d</p><br/><p>Before Yao Si could nod, the girl beside her with hair tied into buns smirked. \u201cHow could it be? I haven\u2019t heard about new bloodling enrolling into the academy. Couldn\u2019t you have found a better excuse, really.\u201d She glanced at Yao Si coldly, her tone soaked with envy and hatred. \u201cHeh, so you know Senior Gu? What\u2019s the big deal, if you don\u2019t want to share it, just forget it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Er\u2026 She already told them!</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, that\u2019s right!\u201d another student in the front agreed. \u201cBloodlings don\u2019t need to take the school entrance exam, they can just automatically enroll into the high school level. Why would they come to the elementary school.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d <em>Why didn\u2019t I know about that? </em> (\u2299_\u2299)</p><br/><p>\u201cIt has always been like that,\u201d the girl said. She then added after a moment, \u201cBloodlings with awakened abilities are considered Triple-S level, so they enter high school right away. Normal people like use are able to only enter the elementary school which doesn\u2019t require an entrance exam.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Does that mean that the three months of hard work she had put in for the entrance exam which she failed, because of which she was forced to enter the elementary school, were all in vain?</p><br/><p>(\u256f\u2035\u25a1\u2032)\u256f\ufe35\u253b\u2501\u253b</p><br/><p>\u201cLet the election begin!\u201d</p><br/><p>The voice startled the students, and they hurriedly sat back down with their backs straight as they looked toward the stage. Yao Si could vaguely make out a figure heading to the middle of the stage when a soft gentle voice filled the hall.</p><br/><p>[Galactic Academy\u2019s opening ceremony shall commence! We shall now start with the student union election!]</p><br/><p><em>That is fast!</em></p><br/><p>Yao Si strongly approved of such a direct system that skipped the draggy speeches that would put one to sleep. She looked at the stage and realized that most students were in either yellow or blue uniforms, which meant that they were either from the middle school or the high school. There were also about four to five senior teachers who stood at the back with no intentions of coming forward.</p><br/><p>This was similar to what Mu Xuan had mentioned previously. Students held high authority in the current schools of the Galaxy, and the teachers wouldn\u2019t interfere unless necessary.</p><br/><p>[According to tradition, the president candidates will be chosen by the members of the previous student union before the student body will cast their votes!]</p><br/><p>After the emcee explained the instructions, about ten students on stage began to write down the name of the person they wanted to elect. In less than a minute, the emcee headed toward the previous student union members, starting from the one at the left.</p><br/><p>\u201cVice-president Zhao, who would you like to elect?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGu Shucheng.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDepartment Head Qian, who would you like to elect?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGu Shucheng.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDepartment head Sun,who would you like to elect?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGu Shucheng.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDepartment Head Li, who would you like to elect?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGu Shucheng.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDepartment Head Tian\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>There were no exceptions, Gu Shucheng\u2019s name flashed on the screen continuously.</p><br/><p>Yao Si sighed. Nephew Gu must be a high flyer in the academy!</p><br/><p>\u201cChairman Gu, who would you like to elect?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYao Si.\u201d</p><br/><p><em>Cough, cough! </em></p><br/><p>Yao Si almost choked.</p><br/><p><em>F*ck! Nephew Gu, what\u2019s your issue!</em></p><br/><p>But it was too late, on the huge screen on the main stage, large letters of the common language formed her name.</p><br/><p>[Yao Si]</p><br/><p>\u03a3(\u00b0\u25b3\u00b0|||)\ufe34</p><br/><p>The moment the two words flashed on the screen, the hall erupted in chatter and confusion as everyone scanned the hall trying to figure out who was Yao Si.</p><br/><p>Her face twitched, and she wondered if there was still time for her to escape.</p><br/><p>\u201cHehehe\u2026 This-this is the first time there is another candidate other than President Gu.\u201d The emcee seemed startled. After a moment of silence, she hurriedly swept her gaze over the audience. \u201cCongratulatons Yao Si, please come up onto the stage.\u201d</p><br/><p>The next moment, the futuristic technology was flaunted to perfection. The screen flashed, and a picture of her was displayed on the stage.</p><br/><p>Yao Si cursed internally!</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, so it\u2019s a new student from the elementary level,\u201d the emcee introduced.</p><br/><p>Yao Si could feel the eyes of the entire hall full of people turning in her direction. The sister beside her with two buns on her head was gazing blankly with her mouth open wider than the topknots of her hair.</p><br/><p>It was too late to escape. Yao Si had no other option. Enduring the uncomfortable gazes from the entire hall, she made her way up to the stage.</p><br/><p>\u201cHi!\u201d She waved her hand rigidly, greeting all the members of the student union.</p><br/><p>Instantly, Gu Shucheng bolted forward with his back rod straight. If it weren\u2019t for the table in front of him, he would have gone down on his knee to salute her.</p><br/><p>His sudden actions shook the hearts of all student council members. With curiosity, they followed his lead. After all, since their president was standing, it wouldn\u2019t seem right if they continued to be seated.</p><br/><p>Yao Si felt as though she was participating in an international interview. It was as if everyone had stood up in preparation to shake hands with her.</p>\n</div>"}

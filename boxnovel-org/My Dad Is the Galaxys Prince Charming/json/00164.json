Which planet did the pervert had dragged her to? For the past few days, she hadn\u2019t been held captive, but besides the house in which she stayed, there weren\u2019t any other buildings in sight. All there was was endless greenery, mountains, and streams.</p><br/><p>Initially, she had planned on tricking something out of Lin Long, but he didn\u2019t have any spare time as he slaved away in the lab. He seemed to be conducting tests, judging from the incident on the Heavenly Planet, so it probably wasn\u2019t anything good. After several days of it, Yao Si decided to switch to a more direct approach.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou want to follow me into the lab?\u201d Lin Long placed the bowl down, his expression turning guarded. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis place is deserted, and there isn\u2019t a soul I can talk to.\u201d Yao Si turned a sideways glance at him. \u201cI\u2019m bored and it\u2019s starting to hurt, alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHeh, don\u2019t take me for a fool.\u201d He scoffed, his disbelief obvious. \u201cAren\u2019t you trying to find out what I\u2019m doing? Do you really think I\u2019m that dumb?\u201d</p><br/><p>Then\u2026 he proceeded to lead her into the lab.</p><br/><p>\u256e(\u256f\ufe4f\u2570\uff09\u256d</p><br/><p><em>Mmh, you aren\u2019t a fool, but a little cute! </em></p><br/><p>The building had the advantage of having the research lab underground; the pervert\u2019s lab was really under the house. The area underground, however, was much larger than the space the house occupied, and it seemed to be about a thousand square meters. However, there wasn\u2019t anything inside\u2014the entire space was hollow and white.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo what if you come in?\u201d Lin Long seemed displeased with her presence in the lab, but it was hard to say if he was angry at her or at himself for letting her enter. After sending her a furious glare her way, he seemed to have redeemed part of his dignity and scoffed. \u201cWith the current technology from your Galaxy, you won\u2019t be able to comprehend any of this.\u201d</p><br/><p>He then proceeded to ignore her while he switched the room on. The next moment, the entire space was filled with screens reflecting all sorts of data.</p><br/><p>Fine! She really couldn\u2019t understand anything.</p><br/><p>\u25cb|\uffe3|_</p><br/><p>Lin Long walked to the middle and started to operate, the screens blinking rapidly as the information changed. Yao Si glanced at each screen slowly, hoping to find some clues.</p><br/><p>With just a glance, she realized that they weren\u2019t using the galactic language or any language she knew, but it seemed familiar! The nearest screen reflected several words that though foreign triggered some sort of meaning\u2014Final Planet Restoration!</p><br/><p>What did that mean? She reached forward instinctively to tap the few words, but with a flash and a buzz, the entire screen disappeared.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you trying to do with my data?!\u201d Lin Long turned to glare at her.</p><br/><p>\u201cEr\u2026 it was an accident.\u201d Yao Si stilled, dazed. Did she press the delete button?</p><br/><p>\u201cEnough, enough, you have seen what you wanted.\u201d He waved his hands impatiently. \u201cGo back upstairs to drink your \u2018spiritual beast blood curd\u2019 and stop disturbing me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si had a sudden thought. \u201cI\u2019ll look around a bit more before going.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHeh.\u201d Lin Long continued to work without sparing her another glance.</p><br/><p>She lifted her head toward the room full of screens, and a tiny bubble of odd excitement formed within her. Maybe\u2026 she knew what she had to do.</p><br/><p>The next moment, she slammed another screen without any hesitation. She then proceeded to the next few, and a continuous buzz echoed through the room\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cAiyaya! I\u2019m sorry, my hand slipped.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAiyaya! I didn\u2019t see that, it\u2019s an accident.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAiyaya! This really wasn\u2019t intentional.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAiyaya! Please believe me, the screen did it first.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAiyaya\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEnough!\u201d When a large portion of the screens had been deleted, Lin Long could no longer keep his anger suppressed and exploded. \u201cF*ck, do you know how many years I spent collecting all that data? If you dare delete another screen, I\u2019ll tear you apart along with the data.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si glanced at him calmly, and after half a second, she tapped onto yet another screen .</p><br/><p><em>Buzzz\u2026 </em></p><br/><p>And another.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re asking for it!\u201d Lin Long\u2019s face sunk, and the bone-chilling aura returned, a gust of black air surrounding him, but instead of getting infuriated, he started to laugh. \u201cHeh, do you really think I won\u2019t kill you? Don\u2019t forget you are someone else\u2019s contractor, not mine!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si\u2019s blood went cold, and she took a step back instinctively. Her main motive was to disrupt his experiment and also to test his tolerance level, but she seemed\u2026 to have gone overboard?</p><br/><p>Lin Long went crazed from anger, his eyes turning a menacing shade of red. In a flash, he appeared in front of her. He lifted his hands, preparing to grab her neck, but at the last moment, he froze.</p><br/><p>Thousands of emotions flashed past his face, distorting it. He gritted his teeth and forced his hands away. Instead, he grabbed her collar, picking her up like a tiny chick before walking to a corner of the top floor where he released her.</p><br/><p>\u201cStand here!\u201d he howled irritably. \u201cStand straight for half an hour!\u201d</p><br/><p>After barking his commands, he turned back down only to stop halfway when a thought struck him. He picked up the long-haired bunny and stuffed it into her hands. \u201cHold this!\u201d With a loud thud, he then turned the deadbolt.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Was this the \u2018face the wall\u2019 punishment?</p><br/><p>Yao Si held onto the bunny in her arms\u2026</p><br/><p>The kind with added weights?</p><br/><p>-_-|||</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>Yao Si couldn\u2019t seem to figure out Lin Long\u2019s attitude toward her. The first time he\u2019d seen her, he\u2019d clearly been after her life, but ever since he dragged her to this house, his tolerance level had miraculously grown out of bounds as he endured all her mischief. For the past few days, she had tried all sorts of destructive acts, even setting the house on fire.</p><br/><p>He would be enraged every single time, howling at her for two whole hours, but he never once lay a hand on her. No just that! He not only spared the rod, he acted just like a nanny, finding all sorts of methods to make her life on the planet enjoyable. And in the times when his anger went off the charts, he only made her face the wall for ten minutes.</p><br/><p>Ten minutes!</p><br/><p>Even though he would threaten that she\u2019ll have to stand the entire day, two days, or sometimes even up to a month, it would be less than ten minutes before his resolve crumbled. He would bring a bunch of food and toys over while pretending to be mean and evil as he cajoled her.</p><br/><p>Yao Si felt like she\u2019d returned to the days when she just met Mu Xuan and he\u2019d treated her like a baby. It was as though she would break apart if he wasn\u2019t watching.</p><br/><p>Yao Si brushed the mark on her forehead that had suddenly appeared and was supposedly linked to the contractor Lin Long spoke about. But he refused to elaborate, and she didn\u2019t have any ideas about what it meant. All she could do was wait for Mu Xuan.</p></div>\n</div>"}

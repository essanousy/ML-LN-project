Even though his words seemed humble, they carried a haughty undertone.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is just a friendly competition, what\u2019s important is the participation,\u201d Gu Shucheng replied nonchalantly.</p><br/><p>It was after all a friendly competition between the academies, so there was no need to be focused on the results. Alas, the president\u2019s words invoked displeasure within him, prompting a rebuttal. \u201cYour academy has been participating for all these years, but our The First Academy has always come in first. Now that your academy is finally victorious, it\u2019s definitely worth celebrating.\u201d</p><br/><p>President of Zhuo Feng paled instantly, his embarrassment apparent. Since bloodlings would only enter the First Academy, his academy was automatically referred to as the second academy. Regardless of whether it was machinery or the students\u2019 quality, they were nowhere near the level of The First Academy.</p><br/><p>Their academy had been set up by the Alliance and so was linked to the military who was naturally more competitive in nature. Every year, they would hold several competitions to challenge the First Academy only to be defeated every single time. This year, however, they were finally able to emerge victorious in the new machine competition they had come up with, so they were naturally a little disorientated.</p><br/><p>\u201cHehehe\u2026\u201d President of Zhuo Feng laughed dryly and diverted the topic unwillingly. \u201cOh right, Vice President Gu, I forgot to inform you that our participant Yuan Han is a freshman for whom we didn\u2019t harbor any hope. I never expected him to win the competition. I heard that Student Yu from your academy is a fifth year student studying mechanics?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, so student Yuan Han is a freshman in your academy.\u201d Nephew Gu was slightly enraged by his words. \u201cI never expected Zhuo Feng Academy to classify their participants according to their academic years. We only look at one\u2019s talents, so everyone is given equal opportunity regardless of the time they\u2019ve spent in the academy. Just look at Her Highness, she is our academy\u2019s president despite only being a freshman. It is all based on ability!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>President of Zhuo Feng was clearly at a loss for words. The moment he tried to mock the First Academy\u2019s top student for losing to a freshman from his academy, he ended up being accused of discrimination and engaging in under-the-table manipulations. The other even used their president as comparison\u2026 but who wasn\u2019t aware that she was a fifth-generation blooding! No one in the whole Galaxy would dare to challenge her!</p><br/><p>The president didn\u2019t dare to retort, fearing it would blow out of proportion. Based on the bloodling\u2019s unpredictable nature, it would definitely escalate into a problem between the races.</p><br/><p>President of Zhuo Feng could only swallow his grievances and turn to smile brightly at Yao Si who was seated next to them. \u201cPresident Yao, the competition has ended, so please announce the results.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si wasn\u2019t the least bit bothered by their banter. She stood up and took two steps forward toward the centre of the stage. She had been invited to announce the competition\u2019s results due to her unique status and as a form of respect to the bloodlings.</p><br/><p>The moment she was in her place, the light\u2019s intensity went up to brighten the arena. The originally agitated crowd went silent instantly, and Yao Si\u2019s figure appeared on all the screens in the arena. Even though the results were clear, everyone still waited patiently for her announcement.</p><br/><p>Yao Si glanced at the battlegrounds; the battle was over and both contestants were exiting their machines. Yu Xiang climbed out from a wrecked machine while Yuan Han walked out from his machine imposingly, with his head held high.</p><br/><p>\u201cI announce that\u201d\u2014she took a deep breath before shouting loudly the rest of her words\u2014\u201dYuan Han from Zhuo Feng Academy is disqualified from the competition. Hence, the results are invalid.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The crowd waiting to cheer fell into a daze, and the entire arena fell into a momentary silence, unable to process the situation. Soon after, a storm of protests and disbelief spread through the audience.</p><br/><p>The crowd rose in an uproar.</p><br/><p>\u201cP-President Yao,\u201d President of Zhuo Feng stammered out with a bewildered expression. \u201cWhat do you mean\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Even though bloodlings were known to be overbearing, protective, and unreasonable, they were dealing with just a competition involving academies and not bloodlings. So what was she up to?!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Before she could explain herself, Yuan Han shouted at her impatiently. He glared straight at her with eyes blazing with fury. \u201cI clearly won this competition, so what gives you the right to disqualify me?\u201d</p><br/><p>His words silenced the crowd, and everyone, especially the students from Zhuo Feng Academy glanced at Yao Si with suspicion and displeasure.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy you are disqualified? I\u2019m sure you know why!\u201d <em>Can\u2019t you feel your conscience being pricked from committing such wrong? </em></p><br/><p>\u201cAll I know is that I won.\u201d There wasn\u2019t a hint of guilt on Yuan Han\u2019s face. He even smirked. \u201cHeh, are you blaming me from winning so perfectly when it\u2019s simply because your academy\u2019s mechanics department isn\u2019t on par? Even though you\u2019re a bloodling, you can\u2019t be so unreasonable.\u201d</p><br/><p>His words further aggravated the displeased crowd who had kept silent due to Yao Si\u2019s identity. Everyone started discussing her actions aloud, dragging their displeasure with the bloodlings into the conversation. Their words were clear even on the stage, and Yao Si\u2019s ears filled with dissing against bloodlings with words like \u2018whats the big deal about being a bloodling?\u2019</p><br/><p><em>Enough, you\u2019re not worthy of mercy. </em></p><br/><p>\u201cAccording to the competition\u2019s rules, contestants are only permitted to use robots of B rank and below, but the robot you are using is above B rank. You don\u2019t think that\u2019s a breach of the rules?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAbove B rank!\u201d The audience looked over at the black robot with disbelief.</p><br/><p>With everyone was focused on his robot, Yuan Han froze. He retorted on instinct, \u201cThat\u2019s impossible!\u201d</p><br/><p>Before Yao Si could reply, Nephew Gu flashed the statistics collected from the competition on a large screen. \u201cThis is real-time data collected from the competition just now. It\u2019ll be able to show us to which grade the robot belongs.\u201d</p><br/><p>Two simplified robot diagrams appeared in the air. One of them belonged to Yu Xiang who lost while the other was the black robot of Yuan Han. There wasn\u2019t anything out of ordinary with the data for Yu Xiang\u2019s robot, but Yuan Han\u2019s robot\u2019s data shot up the moment he pulled out his curved blade. Two words that clearly marked his grade were shown below: Rank S!</p><br/><p>\u201cWow, rank S, it\u2019s actually a rank S robot. That explains how he managed to turn the tide.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA rank S robot is definitely able to surpass rank B robots. That\u2019s too much, the competition clearly restricts robots to rank B and below.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut\u2026 didn\u2019t he say that the robot was created by him? Isn\u2019t it less than a year since he started school? Isn\u2019t it too fast? As expected of a master\u2019s disciple.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEven the masters weren\u2019t able to create such high level robots while they were studying right? But his personality\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yuan Han was at a loss for words, but he remained composed, without a hint of guilt showing, but his gaze wavered slightly before he continued with gusto. \u201cThat\u2019s right, my robot is indeed not of rank B, but I still made it myself. How can you blame Zhuo Feng Academy for their superior skills just because your academy isn\u2019t able to produce robots of such standard?\u201d</p><br/><p><em>F*ck! I\u2019ve never seen anyone cheat with such audacity! </em></p><br/><p>\u201cHow dare you try to claim glory from a competition you won by cheating!\u201d Luo Ying who was seated respectfully at the side burst out in frustration. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if your machine is grade A, S, or even SSS, since you cheated, the results will not be accepted.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHeh, you\u2019re just trying to throw your weight around, but you have no right,\u201d Yuan Han declared as though the whole world was against him, and the hatred in his eyes thickened. \u201cIn all the past competitions, bloodlings have been exploiting their naturally superior traits to gain an edge and win. Why then is your victory considered a victory, but when I win using a robot made by myself I end up being disqualified?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Luo Ying fumed, her face flushed from suppressed anger. \u201cThe two are different so how can you even use them as comparison!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t they be compared?\u201d He humphed coldly, sweeping the bloodlings a glance filled with disdain. \u201cA loss is a loss. How can you blame it on a breach of the rules? You bloodlings are just a lowly bunch that rely on force to bully others.\u201d</p><br/><p>His words didn\u2019t just infuriate Luo Ying. Even the president of Zhuo Feng was taken aback.</p><br/><p>\u201cYuan Han!\u201d</p><br/><p><em>Do you have a death wish?! Running your mouth is one thing since students from a military-backed academy are bound to have a temper, but you shouldn\u2019t drag a whole race into this. Grab another academy if you\u2019re seeking death! </em></p><br/><p>\u201cDid I say something wrong?\u201d Yuan Han retorted firmly, grief clearly written on his face. \u201cThe entire Galaxy knows of the bloodlings\u2019 overbearing and unreasonable ways. They are a virus of the Galaxy!\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment his sentence dropped, everyone drew in a breath in unison. There was even a frown on Mu Xuan\u2019s indifferent face.</p><br/><p>\u201cYuan Han, don\u2019t sprout rubbish!\u201d President of Zhuo Feng was so startled he started to tremble from fear as he sneaked peaks at Yao Si\u2019s expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cContestant Yuan Han!\u201d Yao Si found it amusing. This was the first time she had seen such an illogical person. \u201cAre you trying to say that just because you created with your machine that you can get away with cheating?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJustice lies in one\u2019s heart. Regardless of what you do, the results of the competition are obvious.\u201d He continued to act as though he was the only righteous person is a tainted world.</p><br/><p>\u201cAccording to your words, as long as you win with you own capability, the process can be overlooked\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si chuckled at his audacity. \u201cThen\u2026 if we were to use our abilities to win, it would be counted?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d His face paled.</p><br/><p>Luo Ying burst into laughter. Without any care, she directed a lighting at his machine, sending it to its knees.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Pain smeared over Yuan Han\u2019s face as he stared at the crippled machine. \u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 that\u2019s too much! I definitely, definitely won\u2019t acknowledge you guys!\u201d</p>\n</div>"}

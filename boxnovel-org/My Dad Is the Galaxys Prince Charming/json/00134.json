Please enjoy this celestial world with me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Mu Xuan glanced at his empty side, and his heart chilled slightly. He had never expected his cub to enter a game world. He had placed a tracker on her optical computer to be able to receive any invitation requests sent to her regardless of the location in which they originated. With it, they would be transported to the same place. But this time the invitation happened to be to a web game he had never entered before.</p><br/><p>In order to protect new players, Mu Xuan was transported to the beginner world, which meant that he was separated from Yao Si. The worst part was that he didn\u2019t even know her ID and so wasn\u2019t able to contact her.</p><br/><p>Mu Xuan started to grow annoyed. It felt as though the world itself was deliberately trying to separate him from his cub!</p><br/><p>\u201cPlayer 985425531, Mu Xuan, the celestial world is a treacherous place filled with dangers. By accomplishing small tasks to help the villagers, you will be able to earn experience and level up. Once you have reached Level 10, you will be able to go into the outside world,\u201d the guide explained enthusiastically.</p><br/><p>Sensing Mu Xuan\u2019s lack of reaction, he then continued, \u201cLet me tell you a secret, Madam Li at the entrance of the village seems to require some help. Could you\u2026 Eh,where are you going?\u201d</p><br/><p>Before the guide could finish giving advice, Mu Xuan turned to head toward the exit. After looking through the newbie village\u2019s data, he was sure that Yao Si wasn\u2019t around. He needed to locate her as soon as possible!</p><br/><p>\u201cWait a minute, that\u2019s the way out! You can\u2019t leave until you hit Level 10!\u201d</p><br/><p>The NPC was startled by Mu Xuan rushing to the exit before it could grab hold of him. The NPC then chased after him and heaved a sigh of relief when one of the guards by the exit stopped him.</p><br/><p><em>Thank goodness! </em>For an NPC guide, the main task was to ensure that players followed the sequence of actions indicated inside the beginner\u2019s handbook. This was the first time he had encountered a player without any experience who insisted on leaving the village. <em>Ah, players are getting so difficult\u2026</em></p><br/><p>\u201cDear cultivator, this is the village exit. Those who don\u2019t meet the requirements should retreat,\u201d Guard A said.</p><br/><p>\u201cVillage chef has ordered not to allow players without the high enough level to leave the village and face the perils of the world,\u201d Guard B added.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlayer 985425531 Mu Xuan, monsters of Level 20 and above are everywhere out there,\u201d the NPC guide warned him. \u201cTo ensure your safety, you should first train inside the beginner village. It won\u2019t be long, so you shouldn\u2019t be anxious.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMove aside!\u201dMu Xuan\u2019s face darkened.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh, why doesn\u2019t he listen?\u201d Guard A fumed at his obstinacy. \u201cI have already warned you of the dangers outside. Without any experience, you\u2019ll die the moment you go out!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYea, you\u2019re too young. But do not misunderstand.\u201d Guard B swept a cold look at him before scoffing. \u201cWith your level of experience, any monster out there will be able to finish you off. Rules are rules. If you want to leave the beginner village, you have to be at least Level 10.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI really hate arrogant youngsters like you.\u201d Guard A was so infuriated that he hit his chest. \u201cAs long as I Guard A am alive, no one below Level 10 will be able to leave this place!\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment he said that, Mu Xuan raised his hands. With a gleam of light, Guard A who had just been thumping his chest froze, his form distorting. The next second, he turned into a bunch of data that disappeared with a string of beeps.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d NPC guide</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Guard B.</p><br/><p>Guard A\u2026 died!</p><br/><p>(\u2299_\u2299)</p><br/><p><em>What just happened? Where are we? Aren\u2019t the NPCs in beginner village unbeatable? How could one of us die? the NPC guide wondered.</em></p><br/><p>\u201cCan I leave now?\u201d Mu Xuan turned to sweep a glance at them.</p><br/><p>A cold ran through their spines, and they turned to hug each other instinctively, shivering\u2026 What a\u2026 scary player!</p><br/><p>(\u2565\ufe4f\u2565)</p><br/><p>\u201cMmh,mmh, mmh.\u201d They nodded aggressively, having no wish to become random data.</p><br/><p>Mu Xuan turned around and headed into the distance.</p><br/><p>Only when he became a tiny black dot in the horizon did the NPC guide finally stop trembling to check his data. All the NPCs in the beginner village were unbeatable and had the full data of all players. For a player to kill off an NPC so easily, was he perhaps a software?</p><br/><p>After inspecting Mu Xuan\u2019s data, NPC guide confirmed that he wasn\u2019t anything like that. When he entered the stats containing the player\u2019s real world information, a stream of red words flashed before him.</p><br/><p>[Physical experience overload!]</p><br/><p>[Magical experience overload!]</p><br/><p>[Agility overload!]</p><br/><p>What\u2019s with all these overloaded stats?!</p><br/><p>\u03a3(\u00b0\u25b3\u00b0|||)\ufe34</p><br/><p>His real life stats were even higher than those of the unbeatable infinity level NPCs\u2026 <em>Why are you even playing the game?! </em></p><br/><p>Player 985425531 Mu Xuan\u2026</p><br/><p>The NPC guide was suddenly reminded of a certain randomdata38. Were players with numbers in their ID all so insane?</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u201cThe crowd is starting to increase.\u201d Bai Yi bit down on his lip as he glanced around at the large crowd surrounding them.</p><br/><p>Yao Si started to panic. She still couldn\u2019t locate Mu Xuan! But they needed him right now!</p><br/><p>\u201cThe infinite level state after revival only lasts for half an hour, and there\u2019s only five minutes left.\u201d Bai Yi glanced down at the timer. Were they going to die again? \u201cLao Li, do you still have the random teleportation scrolls? Pass me two of them, we have to leave right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow could I still have those?\u201d Li Zheng sighed, his expression panicky. \u201cAfter we died, most of my equipment dropped on the spot, even the scrolls.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Highness, do you have any with you?\u201d Bai Yi looked toward Yao Si in despair</p><br/><p>\u201cYou must not be thinking straight. She\u2019s just a Level 10 newbie that doesn\u2019t even have the qualifications to enter the main city, so how could she have transportation scrolls?\u201d Li Zheng said before she could reply.</p><div class=\"zzyet5c96774928119\"></div><br/><p>\u201cWhat should we do?\u201d Bai Yi glanced at the increasing crowd. Some people were already taking up aggressive stances. \u201cEveryone look into your bags. Even a healing salve would be useful now or we will really end up hitting Level 0.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si rummaged through her bag. It was filled with shiny golden equipment given by an NPC in the newbie village as part of her beginner introductory package. They probably wouldn\u2019t find it useful? She continued to dig through her bag, finally spotting something special in one corner.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a teleportation scroll, but I do have this, is it useful?\u201d She passed a golden scroll over. The scroll had a couple golden words on it: Scroll of Poetic Saga (Only one)</p><br/><p>(\u2299 o \u2299)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Bai Yi. <em>F*ck.</em></p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Li Zheng. <em>F*ck+1.</em></p><br/><p>\u201cPoe-e-e-tic s-s-s-sa-g-ga!\u201d Bai Yi started to tremble. \u201cOh god, have I went blind? There was indeed such a scroll in the game! I always assumed it was just a rumor. Your Highness, how did you get it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAn NPC gave it to me?\u201d Yao Si could recall getting it for the bunnies. Was it something special? \u201cIs it useful?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Yi and Li Zheng exchanged a look, their expressions speaking a thousand words. <em>Useful? Of course it\u2019s useful!</em></p><br/><p>\u201cYour Highness, don\u2019t you know what this is?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t!\u201d Yao Si had never understood the use of that paper. If she could have gotten rid of it, she wouldn\u2019t have kept it with her.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the scroll of Poetic Saga! It allows the user to alter the game! It means that a huge change can be made to the game through the use of this scroll,\u201d Bai Yi explained. On top of that, it was the only one available in the entire game.</p><br/><p>The World of Commanding Celestials had always maintained its original celestial pursuit stage at the maximum Level 80. A few years ago, the game officials had released a series of information about a huge war indicating the final stage of the game.</p><br/><p>After that, the maximum level would be raised to 100 with a new map being released. However, not a single player had managed to bring that about, igniting rumors that questioned the existence of the scroll, with some people even believing that the scroll had not yet been released. But right then, Bai Yi saw that legendary scroll!</p><br/><p>Once the news was released, he was sure that every player of every district would go into a frenzy.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan this scroll help us escape?\u201d After that much blabbering, Yao Si still didn\u2019t know if the scroll would be of any help in their current predicament.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt should be able to.\u201d Bai Yi nodded. \u201cAfter activating the scroll, Your Highness will be able to obtain the mission for the poetic saga and will send us to the mission\u2019s location. Upon completion, we will unlock an entirely new map. But single mission tasks are usually difficult.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are we waiting for?\u201d <em>Who cares about the mission? We have to leave now! </em>\u201cHow do you activate this scroll?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTear it. But let\u2019s first form a group so that we can be transported together.\u201d Bai Yi sent them each an invitation.</p><br/><p>Yao Si nodded in agreement. Their names appeared in green at the top of their heads. Bai Yi had named himself Silence, and Li Zheng Woodstop</p><br/><p>Without hesitation, Yao Si tore the scroll in half. At the same moment, the protective barrier at the revival point reached its last second. Almost instantly, an array of abilities came flying down on them.</p><br/><p>A golden glow engulfed the group before they disappeared from their spot.</p><br/><p>[Ding! Official world announcement: Congratulations player #38, Silence, and Woodstop who managed to successfully activate the Scroll of Poetic Saga.

World News: While the Daughter of the Heavenly King, the prettiest celestial in the seven seas Celestial Han Yue had been traveling through the immortal lands, she was captured in the bone perishing lands by the demon Ancient Demonic Dragon. It was fortunately witnessed by #38, Silence, and Woodstop.</p><br/><p>[Brave cultivators, please make your way to punish that despicable demonic dragon and save the the prettiest celestial in the seven seas Celestial Han Yue.

The moment they reached it, a task appeared in their task list: Save the Prettiest Celestial of the Seven Seas: Celestial Han Yue</p><br/><p>The corners of Yao Si\u2019s eyes twitched. <em>This progression\u2026 isn\u2019t it too scripted? </em></p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>At that moment, a few thousand miles away in beginner village, Mu Xuan who was just about to enter the outside world heard a warning signal.</p><br/><p>[Ding!

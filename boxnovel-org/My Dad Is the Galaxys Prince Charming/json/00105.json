When he made sure she was fine, he spat, \u201cRegardless of what you think, your actions today are way beyond our race\u2019s bottom line. Both the bloodlings and the entire Galaxy will never let you off.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHahahahahahha\u2026\u201d He burst into laughter, shaking the robot. \u201cDid you really think that my motive today was to get back at you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Yao Si\u2019s heart tightened. She was about to probe more, when suddenly, a gust of wind seemed to have passed her.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Highness!\u201d Luo Ying, who was previously still in Gu Shucheng\u2019s embrace, collapsed toward her abruptly, pushing her to the side. At that instant, Yao Si saw a blue ray flash past as it brushed past Luo Ying\u2019s arm.</p><br/><p>She turned, realizing that Yuan Han had somehow appeared behind them with a glowing blue dagger and a maniacal grin on his face. He was no longer sitting in the robot, but instead, he was clothed in the same Zhuo Feng academy uniform he had on for the competition. t</p><br/><p>Wasn\u2019t he in the robot just now?! How was that possible, how could it have moved by itself?</p><br/><p>There was a wound on Luo Ying\u2019s arm, but she still turned and sent a lighting over. Yuan Han remained calm. With a wave of his hand, the black robot suddenly appeared in front of him to shield the attack.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe so called strongest race isn\u2019t much, after all. Remember this, there will be a day when I, Yuan Han, will wipe off your kind!\u201d He glared at them with an immense hatred and unwavering confidence. At that moment, a massive hole appeared behind him. It looked like a space portal, and it sucked both him and the robot away.</p><br/><p>Space traveling!</p><br/><p>Yao Si started to panic. Instantly, she shouted, \u201cBai Yi, use your ability!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh?!\u201d Bai Yi stilled.</p><br/><p>\u201cHurry!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh!\u201d Bai Yi hurriedly activated his ability.</p><br/><p>Instantly, Master of Subtitles was summoned.</p><br/><p>[Yuan Han wasn\u2019t sure how long this arduous period would last, but he would definitely be able to persevere. The organization was right, the bloodlings were indeed a despicable bunch with disintegrated morals. This revolution was mandatory\u2026 self-awareness\u2026 Doomsday\u2026 Lightning\u2026 Euphoria\u2026]</p><br/><p>Before she could make out all the words, he had already disappeared into the space portal that had suddenly appeared behind him. However, the few words that she had been able to were enough to send a chill down her spine.</p><br/><p>Euphoria! It was this organization again! She held onto Luo Ying who had pushed her aside.</p><br/><p>\u201cLuo Ying, are you okay?\u201d she asked while holding onto her. <em>There must be something wrong with that guy, doesn\u2019t he know that we\u2019re bloodlings? Why did he have to slash me before leaving? Just because I disqualified him? </em></p><br/><p>He was f*cking weird!</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine!\u201d Luo Ying smiled as she shook her head. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, it\u2019s just a small cut. In less than two minutes, it will automa\u2014\u201d Before she could finish her sentence, she spat out a mouthful of blood, coughing uncontrollably.</p><br/><p>\u201cLuo Ying!\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone was startled. Worry swiftly stained Gu Shucheng\u2019s perpetually stoic face while he held her in his arms. \u201cWhat happened? Why is it like this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe injury!\u201d Bai Yi said, eyes wide, while pointing at the slash on her arm in shock. \u201cHow did the injury\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si turned and saw thtat the wound inflicted by Yuan Han\u2019s strange dagger had not healed at all. It had turned blue by then and was spreading like a dye, staining half her arm blue.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow did this happen\u2026 How did this happen?!\u201d Gu Shucheng started to tremble as he tightened his grip on Luo Ying\u2019s body. \u201cYing! Ying!\u201d</p><br/><p>There was no way she could respond, for she was conterminously spitting blood. Besides, the blue glow on her arm kept increasing, and she started to look worse with every passing second. It was as though her life was slowly seeping away.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Highness\u2026\u201d Nephew Gu glanced up at her in anxiety.</p><br/><p>\u201cLets go to the Elder Council!\u201d Yao Si announced decisively as she pulled them along. The bloodling medical research centre was just beside the Elder Council, and it had the most advanced medical equipment and medical personnel, so they had to have a solution for Luo Ying\u2019s situation.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes! Elder Council!\u201d Gu Shucheng agreed, after taking a moment to react. He bolted toward the Galactic Door while carrying Luo Ying.</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>\u201cHow is it?\u201d Yao Si asked anxiously as she grabbed onto the Fourth Elder that had just left the ward.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Your Highness.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cThere is an unknown illness within her body. I\u2026 This is the first time I\u2019ve seen a virus that can suppress a bloodling\u2019s healing ability.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat will happen\u2026 to Luo Ying?\u201d Yao Si\u2019s heart clenched.</p><br/><p>Fourth Elder sighed. \u201cI\u2019m not sure, we can control the spread of the virus for now, but\u2026 we won\u2019t be able to suppress it for long, and if we fail to hold it down, I\u2019m afraid\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t continue, but the message was delivered \u2013 Luo Ying was going to die!</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Highness, how did she contract this virus?\u201d Fourth Elder asked anxiously. \u201cThe fact that such a virus exists poses a huge threat to our kind. I\u2019ll have to inform the Elder Council and His Majesty. Can you tell me what happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si nodded, explaining what had happened in detail.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you, Your Highness, I\u2019ll go and pass on the message this instant.\u201d The Fourth Elder nodded before rushing out the door toward the Elder Council.</p><br/><p>Yao Si turned to glance at the three people in the ward, then tightened her hands into firsts before heading in.</p><br/><p>Luo Ying had passed out and wasn\u2019t able to wake up, with almost her entire body having turned blue. They had been here for about five hours now, and the Fourth Elder had tried every possible method, testing them all multiple times, but he couldn\u2019t detect even what that virus was. There was no way to stop the color from spreading through her entire body.</p><br/><p>Gu Shucheng had been at her side since the start, holding onto her hand all the while. He remained motionless, as if he\u2019d fossilized. In just a short few hours, he was no longer the same person. His face was a frightening shade of white, his eye sockets sunken inwards. He seemed to be in a condition that was far worse than that of Luo Ying. Regardless of what they said to him, he remained the same soulless self.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Highness!\u201d Bai Yi\u2019s eyes brightened when he saw Yao Si walking in, and even the fossilized Gu Shucheng seemed to have shook a little. They seemed to be anticipating some kind of answer from her. \u201cWhat did the Fourth Elder say?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si bit down on her lip, shaking her head gravely.</p><br/><p>The flame in Bai Yi\u2019s eyes extinguished entirely, and he suddenly seemed much younger and more vulnerable as his eyes turned red with despair. \u201cYou\u2019re a fifth generation bloodling, you\u2019re our highness, you must have a plan, right? Luo Ying\u2026 Luo Ying\u2026 Nothing must happen to her. She is Shucheng\u2019s cub, if she\u2019s gone, Shucheng will go crazy\u2026 He will definitely go crazy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 I\u2019m sorry!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si felt a throbbing pain in her chest as an unbearable ache spread through her, guilt flooding her senses, hurting to the point of suffocation. She couldn\u2019t help the self blame and hatred, for that scythe had been directed at her. If it wasn\u2019t for her\u2026 if she hadn\u2019t found Gu Shucheng for a discussion\u2026 If it wasn\u2019t for her\u2026.</p><br/><p>The room started to close in on her.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you home again?\u201d A familiar cold voice broke the silence. Mu Xuan was suddenly at the door, heading straight for Yao Si. \u201cYou promised me, why\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He stilled slightly, sensing the atmosphere in the room. Frowning, he stopped in his tracks, glancing at her in concern. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>The feelings she had suppressed for such a long time seemed to have found an outlet. Unable to be suppressed any longer, all her emotions came flooding out. \u201cDad\u2026\u201d She clenched onto his sleeve instinctively as though clenching onto her last hope. Even though she didn\u2019t want to cry, the tears poured out, unable to be stopped.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Mu Xuan asked, bringing his cub closer to himself, his face tight and strained. \u201cSpeak properly, what exactly happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDad\u2026 Mu\u2026 Mu Xuan\u2026\u201d Yao Si struggled to get the words out through the fear and guilt, but they overpowered her. All she could do was force down the tears.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine, I\u2019m here!\u201d Mu Xuan patted her back reassuringly. This was the first time he had seen her cry, and it sent him into a frenzy. He felt\u2026 a desire to kill. \u201cSpeak slowly.\u201d</p><br/><p>She inhaled sharply, forcing the words out. \u201cLuo Ying\u2026 Luo Ying\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Only then did Mu Xuan spot the other people in the room. Luo Ying in particular caught his attention as she lay on the bed, her entire body tainted blue. His face turned cold and taunt instantly as he spat, \u201cDoomsday Virus!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Majesty knows about this virus?\u201d Once the information sunk in, Bai Yi stared at him in shock. His manners seemed to have left him as he rushed forward, even Nephew Gu turned to looked at them abruptly.</p><br/><p>\u201cDad?\u201d Yao Si lifted her head to glance up at him, her tears streaming down endlessly.</p><br/><p>\u201cMu Xuan,\u201d he corrected, then caressed her head softly, wiping her tears clean. \u201cI don\u2019t like being called dad,\u201d he informed her seriously. \u201cI have indeed seen such a virus, but that was a very long time ago.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gu Shucheng stood up, glancing at Mu Xuan with his emotions in turmoil. He was filled with anxiety, hesitation, and confusion. \u201cThen\u2026 Your Majesty, you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you have a cure for it?\u201d Yao Si volunteered, reaching for his sleeve unconsciously. Her breathing stilled as she waited in anticipation.</p><br/><p>\u201cMmh, it\u2019s rather easy to cure.\u201d Mu Xuan nodded, turning to glance at them.When he saw the three of them staring at him with hope, he frowned while caressing his cub\u2019s head. \u201cIs this why you weren\u2019t back for dinner?\u201d</p><br/><p>She was even in tears.</p>\n</div>"}

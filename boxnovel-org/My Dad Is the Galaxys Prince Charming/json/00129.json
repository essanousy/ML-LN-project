Even though she was the victim of the incident, she couldn\u2019t seem to hate Li Zheng. She was constantly reminded of his radiant smile and the him from before who would often sneak a few extra pieces of duck blood into her basket.</p><br/><p>If only they could turn back the time\u2026</p><br/><p>While she was contemplating the past events, Mu Xuan\u2019s optical computer suddenly rang.</p><br/><p>He turned it on, and Yao Qian\u2019s image popped out. He seemed perplexed and worried. \u201cYour Majesty, that person\u2026 is awake!\u201d</p><br/><p><em>That person?</em></p><br/><p>Yao Si stilled, understanding who he meant almost instantly. \u201cLi Zheng is awake?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Your Highness!\u201d Yao Qian nodded. \u201cHe just woke up.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI understand, I\u2019ll be right there.\u201d Mu Xuan stood up. Even though his mental strength surrounded the building, there were other people keeping guard as well. They were mainly bloodlings below the thirtieth generation, so there was no guarantee that they would be safe from his bloodline suppression.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait a minute, Your Highness!\u201d Yao Qian exclaimed anxiously. \u201cThere\u2019s one more problem I need to report.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Both Yao Si and Mu Xuan froze, staring at him.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe seems\u2026 to be suffering from amnesia.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>What?!</p><br/><p>\u2014</p><br/><p>In a flash, Yao Si was at the research center in front of Yao Qian.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean by amnesia?\u201d she asked. \u201cDoes he remember who he is?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like that!\u201d Yao Qian seemed perplexed, as though he had no idea where to begin. Instead, he brought her and Mu Xuan over to Li Zheng\u2019s room.</p><br/><p>It was a specially made transparent room that could prevent the person inside from using their mental strength. The room was rather empty, with just one bed on which lay Li Zheng. He was indeed awake and sitting upright. He seemed like a changed person, the negative aura from before nowhere to be seen.</p><br/><p>The Li Zheng at that moment was different, his expression dazed as he looked around blankly. His gaze was filled with unease and curiosity. The dark aura\u2019s disappearance had left behind a clean and empty soul.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Majesty, Your Highness!\u201d Yao Qian pointed to the person in the room. \u201cHe has been like this ever since he woke up. His memory seems to date only to the years still on the Blue Planet. He also doesn\u2019t seem to have any common knowledge about the Galaxy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou mean\u2026\u201d Yao Si\u2019s heart sank. \u201cHe only has memories from the days on Blue Planet?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems like it!\u201dYao Qian nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhich year?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFrom what he said, it was\u2026 2017AD.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c2017!\u201d It was around the time Yao Si had met him, which meant that he not only forgot about everything that had happened in the Galaxy, but also everything about the doomsday period. \u201cMu Xuan\u2026\u201d She grabbed his hand. If it was real, maybe he wouldn\u2019t have the same extremist views anymore.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d Mu Xuan caressed her head reassuringly before turning toward Yao Qian. \u201cHe is a fourth generation bloodling. It would be easy for him to trick you guys.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt should be true!\u201d Yao Qian presented a stack of data in several screens which appeared in front of them. With a glance at it, he said, \u201cWe found that in the big fight, he suffered a tremendous trauma which led to permanent damage to his mental strength. It has disappeared entirely.\u201d</p><br/><p>This meant that he didn\u2019t have any mental strength to conceal his current state. Besides, he had been extremely accommodating throughout the tests, and he even treated them\u2026 politely?</p><br/><p>Mu Xuan studied the data carefully. Suddenly he stopped on the most recent page, even maximizing it on the screen. His expression changed slightly. \u201cIs this the DNA result?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Majesty, you see the problem?\u201d Yao Qian took a step forward, filled with surprise and a hint of excitement. \u201cI was so shocked by the results I started to doubt myself. But after multiple tries, the result remained the same. Besides, all the newest test results have come in today once more.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d Yao Si was confused. <em>Please take care of this illiterate person here, thanks!</em></p><br/><p>\u201cYour Highness!\u201d Yao Qian turned to glance at her with glowing eyes. He looked like he had turned into a crazy science professor. \u201cNo one in the entire Galaxy is able to change their DNA. The only exception is during a conversion into a bloodling, when one changes their race.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know that!\u201d <em>Isn\u2019t it just conversion?</em></p><br/><p>\u201cBut Li Zheng\u2026\u201d Yao Qian pointed to the data in front of him. \u201cIn just a short few days, his DNA has changed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, him?\u201d What did that mean? Did he turn into a superman?</p><br/><p>\u201cHe was converted.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh? Wait a minute!\u201d Yao Si felt her brain begin to buzz, starting to get confused by the influx of information. \u201cHe was converted? Wasn\u2019t he already a bloodling?\u201d</p><br/><p>Or had he been in the same situation as her and lived as a fake bloodling all those years? It was only through death that the whole process could be finalized.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe had indeed been a pure fourth-generation bloodling. He wasn\u2019t in the same situation as you,\u201d Mu Xuan explained after sensing her doubt. But then his face fell, his brows scrunching together. \u201cWhat Yao Qian means is\u2026 that he has been converted a second time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA second\u2026 conversion?\u201d</p><br/><p><em>What the f*ck? There is such a thing as second conversion? Why had no one told her\u2026</em></p><br/><p>\u201cThis is the first time I have encountered such an event,\u201d Yao Qian continued in obvious excitement. \u201cBut from the data I\u2019ve gathered, his changes match the effects of conversion. All of his past memories have been erased, leaving only the convertor\u2019s memories intact.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou mean\u2026\u201d Yao Si frowned, \u201cHe didn\u2019t just convert\u2026 He\u2019s an inheritor?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d</p><br/><p><em>What do you mean by that! How did such an illogical thing happen? Who converted him this time?</em></p><br/><p>Wait a minute!</p><br/><p>Since Li Zheng was a fourth-generation bloodling, there was no way other bloodlings would be able to suppress him. The only one who was stronger was\u2026 Mu Xuan!</p><br/><p>(\u2299_\u2299)</p><br/><p>She jerked her head back to look at Mu Xuan, finding his face as dark as the skies outside, his brows so scrunched up they could kill a fly. He had caught on? He had a new inheritor!</p><br/><p>Yao Si\u2019s heart clenched.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go in and take a look.\u201d Mu Xuan pushed open the door and headed inside.</p><br/><p>Li Zheng who had been in a daze turned to them, his eyes brightening, and a wide smile spread across his face in greeting. He looked just like the young man from the past who had sold Yao Si duck blood.</p><br/><p>\u201cDad!\u201d</p><br/><p>It was as expected!</p><br/><p>Yao Si\u2019s heart sank. Even though it was an accident, the bitterness couldn\u2019t be held back. It gushing out, engulfing her. She now understood why bloodlings had such differing opinions toward cub and inheritors. She didn\u2019t like inheritors either; she was no longer the only baby.</p><br/><p>\u201cWith just one look, I can tell who my dad is.\u201d Li Zheng was a stark contrast to his previous self. He ran barefooted toward them in excitement. \u201cHello, dad, call me Yao Si.\u201d</p><br/><p>As he spoke\u2026 he grabbed Yao Si\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u03a3(\u00b0\u25b3\u00b0|||)\ufe34</p><br/><p>What????</p></div>\n</div>"}

He turned over to glower at them, and his voice was cold enough to penetrate their bones. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Majesty!\u201d Lin Long tightened his grip around Lian Yu unconsciously. With a deep inhale seemingly to gather his courage, he took a step forward. \u201cThis universe isn\u2019t like ours, and it has countless other races. Even if our clan wishes to search for contractors, there isn\u2019t a need to wage a war.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a decision made by the clan!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut, the other races would definitely retaliate. If there were contractors within that bunch\u2026\u201d Lin Long continued.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s precisely why we have to take control as soon as possible to prevent unnecessary mishaps.\u201d The prince stood his ground. He glanced over at Yao Si and Lian Yu before adding icily, \u201cYou should understand the importance of a contractor. Even if the chances are slim, it\u2019s still worth our effort.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si grew increasingly frustrated. That man wanted to take control of all the races so that his clansman could pick and choose with ease? How was that logical and who gave them the right?</p><br/><p>\u201cYou intend to enslave everyone just because your clan wants to find their contractors?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey\u2019re just worthless races.\u201d The grand prince scoffed as though taking over a universe wasn\u2019t a major affair. \u201cThey should feel honored that my clan looks upon them so highly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBullsh*t!\u201d Lian Yu who had been restraining herself all the while finally exploded. \u201cAre you f*cking crazy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Yu!\u201d Lin Long grabbed her hand in an attempt to stop her, but it had little effect.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid i say something wrong?\u201d In the heat of the moment, Lian Yu flicked his hand aside. \u201cLin Long, are your clansman all dumb? What kind of grand prince is this? How can he view a war so lightly? Do you think wars are fun? Let me warn you, if you f*cking touch my aves, I\u2019ll castrate you. This is our world, so who gives you the right to make any decisions?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Yu\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho gave us the right?\u201d The grand prince smirked slightly before replying. \u201cOur abilities give us the right!\u201d</p><br/><p>A sudden and immense force erupted, cocooning a huge area of the neighbouring galaxies. It was an indescribable power that sent chills through their blood, weakened their limbs, and left them with a suffocating fear. His force seemed like an ability, but it didn\u2019t posses any aggression.</p><br/><p>Mu Xuan took a step forward, activating his mental strength to suppress the force; it was only then that Yao Si felt slightly better.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you trying to betray the clan?\u201d The grand prince frowned, displeased with Mu Xuan\u2019s resistance. He turned to sweep Yao Si a glance before a thought struck him, and he smiled slyly. \u201cDo you know the consequence of betraying the clan?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si\u2019s heart sank. Before she could process his words, Lin Long\u2019s face went as pale as a sheet. He shouted out anxiously \u201cRun!\u201d and hugged onto Lian Yu before opening a space portal.</p><br/><p>It was the first time that Yao Si had seen him in such a terrified state; he hadn\u2019t been this panicky even on the verge of death from Mu Xuan\u2019s beatings. This time, however, he wasn\u2019t even going to fight\u2014escape was his only reaction.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you think you can escape?\u201d</p><br/><p>The grand prince smirked, and a red wall appeared in the pitch black darkness. It was similar to the highly dangerous light that Mu Xuan and Lin Long had summoned up previously. but this time, the glow had morphed into a large surface and was increasing in size, changing them and the Blue Planet behind them into a sea of red. The space portal that Lin Long had opened up disappeared instantly as though forcefully shut closed.</p><br/><p>\u201cBlood prison!\u201d Lin Long murmured, his face paling and his hands trembling.</p><br/><p>Yao Si stilled. What was a blood prison? The next moment, clusters of red light flew toward them from all directions, piercing through the darkness like a sky full of shooting stars. But more importantly, Yao Si couldn\u2019t seem to move an inch. Despite her struggle, she remained paralyzed, defenceless against the impending light rays.</p><br/><p>When they were about to reach her, she felt a tug and entered Mu Xuan\u2019s embrace. At the same time, he summoned a transparent barrier to shield them. The clusters of light rays fell against it simultaneously, emitting an endless stream of thumps before exploding into red sparks.</p><br/><p>Before Yao Si could relax, Mu Xuan vomited a mouthful of blood.</p><br/><p>\u201cMu Xuan!\u201d</p><br/><p>Her heart clenched. Mu Xuan had been in a weak state from opening the portal, so after blocking the grand prince\u2019s attack, he could barely hold on.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d He pressed her head against his chest, unwilling to let her witness his pained state.</p><br/><p><em>How could you be fine when you just vomited blood?! </em></p><br/><p>\u201cLin Long!\u201d Lian Yu seemed to have understood the gravity of the situation and yanked the dazed Lin Long around. \u201cStop dreaming and come help out!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Long snapped back to his senses, but he still hesitated slightly. He glanced back and forth between Lian Yu and Mu Xuan before finally gritting his teeth. He seemed to have came to a decision, for he raised his hand to summon four purple fire dragons which he directed at the grand prince.</p><br/><p>The bloodling frowned. He halted his red light ray attacks and steered them toward the fire dragons instead. Shortly after, the dragons were all eradicated.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to rebel too?\u201d He swept a glance at Lin Long and Lian Yu.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a choice!\u201d Lin Long spread open his palms, a relaxed determination replacing his previous caution. \u201cI can\u2019t go against my contractor\u2019s wishes. Since you don\u2019t have a contractor, you can\u2019t understand my feelings even if you are the grand prince!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Long was clearly flaunting his relationship, and the grand prince\u2019s face darkened. His stoic face twitched as flames lit up his eyes. He took a moment to compose himself before gritting his teeth and growling out his next words. \u201cHeh, so what if you have a contractor? Those who have betrayed the clan will be killed together with their contractor.\u201d</p><br/><p>He was like an enraged lion as he raised his hand to summon another red glow directed at them.</p><br/><p><em>F*ck! </em>Yao Si suddenly realized that calling the two men traitors was just an excuse for him to attack her and Lian Yu.</p><br/><p><em>Isn\u2019t that jealousy? It\u2019s f*cking jealousy! </em></p><br/><p>The ancient single dogs were indeed the absolute worst!</p></div>\n</div>"}

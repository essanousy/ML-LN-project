Even though his expression remained impassive, Yao Si could feel a suppressed pressure surrounding her.</p><br/><p>Ever since he woke up from his hundred years hibernation he had been trying to educate her, so he had never once left the Red Planet. And so he was oblivious to how the advertisements outside had been using his name. Growth vaccination, beauty cream, space button aside, there was even a marriage agency now! And the worst part? He wasn\u2019t being paid!</p><br/><p>\u256e(\u256f_\u2570)\u256d</p><br/><p>Yao Si felt an impulse to claim back her rights.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you like this?\u201d When Mu Xuan noticed Yao Si being motionless, he bent down to glance at the flower advertisement that was about to disappear. He suggested, \u201cLet\u2019s take a look then.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh?\u201d She was just shocked into a daze by the abruptness of the advertisement!</p><br/><p>Mu Xuan held onto her hand, leading her towards the right side of the street. It was different from the shopping streets in Blue Planet, for there wasn\u2019t any architecture along the streets, instead it was filled with neat rows of lit up screens. The screen that they were heading towards had the words \u2013 Virtual Space, two simple big big words.</p><br/><p>Space? Were they to referring to the space button? Honestly, she was indeed curious and wanted to clear her doubts.</p><br/><p>Just as Yao Si was still contemplating which store it was, Mu Xuan led her into one. The floor below them started to gleam, and cubes, which covered the space of around half a square meter, lit up and started to raise, sending them upwards at a high speed.</p><br/><p><em>Wa! </em>Was this the galaxy\u2019s elevator? Yao Si glanced around with interest. There were indeed a few others ascending just like them. In less than a minute, they entered the clouds, which were particularly dense around there, and she could feel the thick layer of fog brush past her. This lasted for about a whole minute, and once they left it the sight was blinding.</p><br/><p>Blocks and blocks of buildings Yao Si had never seen before appeared before her eyes\u2014some of them were tall and had crystals on them, while others were weirdly shaped. Compared to the bloodling architecture which was influenced by the ancient Blue Planet, this one was much more diverse and unconventional. The designs here were such that she\u2019d never seen before, and there didn\u2019t seem that here existed a building that one couldn\u2019t build. Instantly, Yao Si felt as though she\u2019d entered a fairy tale land.</p><br/><p>The glow below her feet brought her to a towering palace. In contrast with the novel architecture surrounding it, this building seemed more majestic and vintage looking, emitting a vibe of luxury.</p><br/><p>Mu Xuan held onto her hand, leading her into the building. The moment they entered, the scenery changed once more, and they were surrounded by a field of flowers and greenery. It was as though they had entered a botanical garden and not a shop; all around them were unfamiliar looking flowers at full bloom. Their senses were attacked by their competing aromas.</p><br/><p>Yao Si\u2019s first thought was\u2026 <em>Mmh, the shops here must have splurged on their renovations.</em></p><br/><p>\u201cWelcome,\u201d a young lady at their right greeted. She had a human form and was wearing a green uniform, but behind her were nine huge snowy tails, and two pointy ears were on her head. She reminded Yao Si of a nine-tailed fox. \u201cI\u2019m your shop assistant Xiao Lin, happy to be at your service. What are you looking for? Is it storage components, machine equipment, or biological space?\u201d</p><br/><p>What was she saying? Yao Si looked towards Mu Xuan in confusion.</p><br/><p>\u201cStorage components,\u201d he replied on her behalf.</p><br/><p>\u201cSure.\u201d The shop assistant nodded with a faint smile, then pointed towards a flower bush at the side. \u201cPlease come this way.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mu Xuan held onto Yao Si\u2019s hand, trailing behind the shop assistant. The flowers squeezed to the side as though they had received an order, forming a walkway toward the white street ahead. What was surprising was that there wasn\u2019t any trace of soil when they left.</p><br/><p>Yao Si was particularly intrigued by the fact that even the flowers had a mind of their own. But she wasn\u2019t sure if they were real, so, mimicking Qu Ze\u2019s past actions, she couldn\u2019t resist reaching to caress a red flower, pulling lightly on it.</p><br/><p>A sudden cry pierced the air, startling Yao Si.</p><br/><p>\u201cAiya, it hurts!\u201d</p><br/><p>The blossoming flowers suddenly turned in unison towards the direction of the cry, akin to a crowd seeking out a scandal</p><br/><p>Yao Si just stared at them.</p><br/><p>And Mu Xuan stared speechlessly at her.</p><br/><p>The most horrifying awkward silence followed.</p><br/><p>\u25cb|\uffe3|_</p><br/><p><em>The flowers can talk? </em>Are they shop assistants and not ornaments? But she had never read about such a race\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss, I see you like the whispering flower, too,\u201d The professional shop assistant hurriedly spoke up, resolving the tension in the air. \u201cThe whispering flowers have low pain tolerance, and they\u2019ll cry out the moment someone touches them. Miss, if you really like them, we\u2019ll give you one.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHehehe\u2026 Thank- thank you, but it\u2019s fine.\u201d So the flowers were the shop\u2019s alarm system\u2026 This was so embarrassing, but luckily she had just touched the flower\u2026 Lack of knowledge could really kill her.</p><br/><p>Yao Si kept her hands to herself from then on, holding onto Mu Xuan as they ventured deeper into the store. The shop assistant brought them to a lake, where she lightly caressed the waters, seemingly activating something. Moments after, the water in the lake suddenly lifted, forming a screen in front of them, which bubbled for a while before clearing out. There an image then appeared.</p><br/><p>The shop assistant started to introduce the objects on the screen, explaining the uses and benefits in detail. When she was done, she asked, \u201cThere are many storage components in the store, both biological and non-biological ones. Which would you prefer?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si turned to look at Mu Xuan. She had no clue about storage components, for the only thing she knew about them was what she\u2019d seen in the kindergarten. One of her classmates, the fat one, had had a space button.</p><br/><p>\u201cBiological space,\u201d Mu Xuan replied on her behalf once more.</p><br/><p>\u201cSure.\u201d The shop assistant broke into a brighter smile as though pleased with the response. \u201cSir, would you prefer an individual add-on or an additional part for the optical computer or for it to enter your human form directly?\u201d</p><br/><p>Mu Xuan hesitated. Instead of replying, he turned to look at Yao Si. \u201cWhich would you prefer?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh?\u201d Yao Si stilled.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you prefer a piece to carry around or for it to be entered into the optical computer?\u201d Knowing that she lacked common knowledge, Mu Xuan provided a little explanation.</p><br/><p><em>So you could use it as an upgrade for the optical computer?</em></p><br/><p>\u201cOptical computer.\u201d <em>It would be easier to keep track of it that way. </em></p><br/><p>\u201cMmh,\u201d Mu Xuan replied before turning back to the shop assistant. \u201cAdd it to the optical computer, the one with the classic design.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSure!\u201d The shop assistant broke into a bright smile as though it was the first time she had met such a chic customer. She tapped onto the screen and a transparent box floated out. She reached for it, bowing. \u201cSir, you have greet taste, this is the most highly regarded design for a storage component. It\u2019s small and convenient, highly suited for female customers.\u201d She tapped onto the box, and the next moment, a screen appeared before them with a row of numbers, supposedly the price. \u201cSir, what currency would you prefer?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGalactic currency.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><br/><p>Before Yao Si could get a good look at the price, Mu Xuan had already waved his optical computer in the direction of the piece, paying for it as though it didn\u2019t cost much.</p><br/><p>Yao Si paused, momentarily feeling as though she had been bought over by a rich tycoon. Having a rich backup was indeed great, you didn\u2019t have to\u2026</p><br/><p>There was a buzzing sound, and a pop up appeared.</p><br/><p>[Your account has been frozen!]</p><br/><p>The three people froze, staring at the message.</p>\n</div>"}

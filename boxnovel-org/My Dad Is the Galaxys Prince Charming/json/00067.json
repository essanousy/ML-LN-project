The thought\u2026 had never once crossed her mind, or rather, she had chosen to neglect such an option.</p><br/><p>Mu Xuan\u2019s face sank, disappointment clouding his gaze. With a deep sigh, he caressed her head. \u201cSisi, I\u2019m your mentor. Even if you wanted the entire Galaxy destroyed, I would help you with it. You can\u2026 rely on me a bit more.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si\u2019s heart clenched as she dove into his embrace, her throat choked up with worry and other emotions. In an unfamiliar voice, she choked out, \u201cDad.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMu Xuan!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMu Xuan\u2026 I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m just so used to doing things by myself.\u201d She was used to living by herself, used to making her own decisions, used to shouldering all her burdens, used to not having anyone to lean on.</p><br/><p>But\u2026 out of nowhere, she now had a father! There was now someone waiting for her to be back for meals, expecting her to rely on them.</p><br/><p>But\u2026 she just hadn\u2019t gotten used to it yet!</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll change! I definitely will!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMmh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>The experiment against the bloodlings thoroughly infuriated the entire race. All of the bloodlings that had been rescued were placed in a centralized area assigned by the Elders Council for further inspection to ensure that there weren\u2019t any problems that might have been overlooked.</p><br/><p>Yao Si was afraid that her suppression ability wasn\u2019t reliable and the captured bloodlings would remember the painful memories, so she made the more dependable Mu Xuan use his mental ability on all of them. This way, their memories would be thoroughly erased.</p><br/><p>As for the other three, Nephew Gu recovered only after two days of rest, Bai Yi wasn\u2019t harmed, and Luo Ying had recovered on the way back.</p><br/><p>Yao Si had been unscathed. Other than a few rips on her clothes, she was totally fine. But the rips on her clothes were enough. Mu Xuan glared at her with displeasure for a long while before tugging her home to recuperate.</p><br/><p>She was confined to their house, where lived the life of a pig \u2013 eating and sleeping. In order to piece back a certain someone\u2019s shattered glass heart, Yao Si didn\u2019t dare to leave the house. Her only form of entertainment was to harass Yao Qian regularly regarding the follow up on the matter of the experiments.</p><br/><p>The Elders Council was going to be busy.</p><br/><p>First, the research base planet was thoroughly investigated by the bloodlings. They found that the organization\u2019s targets weren\u2019t just bloodlings. Almost every race had suffered being a specimen under them, but the only ones who survived that were the bloodlings.</p><br/><p>The Red Planet informed all the various races, concealing only the organization\u2019s aim to find immortality. The news sent the entire Galaxy into a major uproar! Euphoria became a notorious name that was known even on the tiniest planet.</p><br/><p>There was an extensive restructuring of the internal regulations within the Red Planet.</p><br/><p>The slack regulations were strengthened. Bloodlings that were going into hibernation had to first inform the officials of the Red Planet, and everyone that lived outside the Red Planet had to return once every ten years.</p><br/><p>The Red Planet followed all the possible clues they could find in the research base while putting in place a large scale investigation regarding the whereabouts of all bloodlings. The investigation shone light on a large number of missing people, but the Elders couldn\u2019t be sure if they were in hibernation or captured, as Perverted Lu had led them to believe.</p>\n</div>"}

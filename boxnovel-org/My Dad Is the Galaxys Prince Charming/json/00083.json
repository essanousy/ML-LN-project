He nodded his head vigorously. \u201cAll right! The sect leader is in the main palace discussing matters with the elders, senior please follow me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior Si\u2026\u201d Zan Zichen hesitated.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, it\u2019ll be fine!\u201d She tapped her chest in confidence, knowing that everyone here had an ability had reassured her. \u201cThe situation has to be resolved. If they aren\u2019t reasonable, I\u2019ll be sure to bring you out. I\u2019m sure no situation can be worse than this.\u201d</p><br/><p>He clenched his teeth and his hands formed into first, but after a short while, he nodded. \u201cAll right! I believe you, senior.\u201d</p><br/><p>He was a sincere kid in the end.</p><br/><p>Yao Si followed the disciple that was thoroughly burnt, heading behind the stone wall.</p><br/><p>After she entered, she realized there was a long stretch of staircase that led to the skies, so high it was impossible to see its end. She couldn\u2019t gauge the distance.</p><br/><p>Are we\u2026 going to climb this? Will it kill me\u2026</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t have a choice. After a deep breath, she took a step. Suddenly, a bright light shone from beneath her, and the scene in front of her changed. The next moment, she was on a balcony, the surroundings covered with clouds, a large palace ahead.</p><br/><p>It was a teleporting staircase! She recalled the drawing at the dispatch area after she had registered and breathed a sigh of relief. Fortunately, she hadn\u2019t been brought to the wrong place this time.</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior, please!\u201d Geng Zhi pointed to the palace ahead. \u201cThe sect leader is inside\u201d</p><br/><p>They entered together. Before Yao Si could push the door, it opened automatically.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho came without prior notice?\u201d an infuriated voice asked. \u201cDon\u2019t you know I\u2019m discussing matters with Grand Elder?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster!\u201d Geng Zhi ran forward hurriedly, kneeling onto the ground with a greeting. \u201cA senior wishes to meet you, it\u2019s for\u2026 Zan Zichen\u2019s matter.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cZan Zichen!\u201d The elder turned over in shock. \u201cThat traitor is still alive?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si realized that there were a total of six people in the room, five of them seated with only the man in blue standing. He was the one who was asking the question.</p><br/><p>The sect leader first glance at Zan Zichen, hatred flashing past his face, then turned back to Geng Zhi. \u201cWho wanted to see me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMe!\u201d Yao Si walked out from the group, entering the hall. The moment she came in, the four of the originally seated five bolted up with the last one being a little slower. He turned to take a look at her, and his face suddenly paled.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d the sect leader asked rudely.</p><br/><p>Just as Yao Si was about to reply, the elder that had stood up last and seemed to be about forty to fifty years old said, \u201cI know her!\u201d Taking large steps forward, he broke into wide smiles. \u201cHello, hello, hello\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>This uncle\u2026 who are you?</p><br/><p>\u201cGrand elder, she\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is a valuable friend. After so many years, I almost couldn\u2019t recognize her.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 A valuable friend.\u201d The sect leader\u2019s expression took a complete change, turning respectful.</p><br/><p>Yao Si was confused, but that uncle continued, \u201cOld friend, you\u2019re finally here. I had received the notice and waited for a long time, but you took such a long while. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re safe. Dear friend, do you want some tea? And what should I call you now?\u201d</p><br/><p><em>Old friend?</em></p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m Si Yao.\u201d</p><br/><p><em>Such a confusing friendliness\u2026 Wait, I know! This must be the staff at the service centre! Did they recognize my customer status?</em></p><br/><p><em>But this isn\u2019t the time for that! </em></p>\n</div>"}

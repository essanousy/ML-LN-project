He\u2019s bringing me around to the Eternal Brightness.</em></p><br/><p>Yao Si understood from the book Mu Xuan had previously prepared for her, \u201cGalaxy\u2019s Knowledge Compass\u201d, that there was an alliance between the three largest planets around, which was similar to how international cities did it on Earth back in the day.</p><br/><p>Eternal Brightness was at least three thousand light years away from Red Planet, but compared to the other planets, which were even farther away, it was considered the nearest main planet.</p><br/><p>Yao Si went to sleep full of excitement and woke up early the next morning. She was really interested to see if she was going to stand on a sword like the previous time or sit on a spacecraft as a country bumpkin from the Blue planet.</p><br/><p>Mu Xuan stood by the open door, waving her outside the house. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d Yao Si went after him in a hurry.</p><br/><p>Mu Xuan grabbed her hand, and they stepped out the house together. The moment they were past the door, rays of blinding sunlight spilled onto them. The scorching sun was a rare occurrence on the Red Planet, so today was indeed a good day to go out.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re here!\u201d Mu Xuan suddenly declared.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Yao Si stilled. <em>What did he mean?</em></p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s crowded here, so keep close and don\u2019t wander about,\u201d he instructed seriously.</p><br/><p>It was only then Yao Si realized that in front of them was no longer the familiar entrance to the Majestic Palace. Instead, it was a long gray walkway, filled with people. She turned her head instinctively, and behind her was a door-like illusion that was disappearing slowly. Behind it, she could still make out the furniture at home.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2026 that was fast!\u201d Yao Si couldn\u2019t believe her eyes, turning back and forth for confirmation. He really meant it when he said go out\u2026 Where was the promised spacecraft, the promised flying-sword journey, the promised three thousand light years?</p><br/><p>\u201cEternal Brightness planet has a specific galactic door,\u201d Mu Xuan explained when he saw her confusion. \u201cYou can be transmitted over here from any planet.\u201d</p><br/><p><em>I see!</em></p><br/><p>Even though Yao Si couldn\u2019t really understand, it seemed impressive.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay\u2026\u201d She was still confused, but she followed along nonetheless.</p><br/><p>When they reached a long, narrow walkway, she realized that the place they came out of had an arched door a few stories high, and in the middle of the door was a layer of liquid that looked like silver. This liquid would spread to form an entrance every once in a while with all sorts of people walking out.</p><br/><p>Some of them had black hair and yellow skin like her, some had blue skin, some were weirdly shaped with three heads and six limbs, some came in flying with their wings. There was even a fish with a huge bubble over his head swimming in. Basically\u2026 the galaxy was full of wonders!</p><br/><p>Even though Yao Si already knew about the different clans in the galaxy, this was the first time she had witnessed it first hand. Still, once she paid closer attention, she noticed that human-like figures ones were predominant.</p><br/><p>Yao Si felt like a country bumpkin, finding every small detail intriguing. It was as though she could spend a year staring without feeling bored.</p><br/><p>Mu Xuan held onto her as they walked through the crowded walkway. In just an instant, the crowd seemed to have magnified, filling the space with a myriad of sounds.</p><br/><p>The skies were bright with transparent images\u2014big and small, neat and cluttered. Every form of advertisement floated about, some of which would even rush in front of the passers-by, following them for a distance before disappearing.</p><br/><p>Such advanced technology was no doubt part of the Galactic Advertisement system.</p><br/><p>Yao Si couldn\u2019t help diverting her gaze from the passers-by to the advertisements. She wasn\u2019t very familiar with the Galactic dialect, so she spent a large amount of time just reading the words. Out of habit, she spelled them out loud.</p><br/><p>\u201cFlower rain tablets, the product used by the galaxy\u2019s number one male god.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGod Mu\u2019s special pill. It calms your nerves and energizes your spirit.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBlooming growth soap, have the same mesmerizing physique as the male god Mu Xuan.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWooden space button, allowing you to have a space as wide as Male God Mu Xuan\u2019s shoulders.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMu Xuan brand\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>What exactly were all these? Yao Si couldn\u2019t bear to continue reading and turned over to glance at Mu Xuan. \u201cEr\u2026 You can\u2019t be the Male God Mu Xuan they\u2019re all referring to, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Mu Xuan frowned, a faint hint of confusion tainting his face. He shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><br/><p>Was it just the same first and second name? But all the advertisements were aggressively using the name of Male God Mu Xuan, so this person had to be a big star in the galaxy.</p><br/><p>Just when they were still looking at each other in confusion, a giant figure flashed onto a giant screen in the middle and a loud voice rang out through the street.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you looking for eternal love? Hurry and register in Mu Xuan\u2019s Partner Introduction Center, which is full of all kinds of races and genders looking for marriage. Regardless of whether you have a human, fish , or bug form, if there\u2019s love in your heart, you\u2019ll be able to find your ideal other half! Mu Xuan\u2019s Partner Introduction Center caters to your every need, fulfills your every requirement, so just believe in yourself and maybe you will be that very one I\u2019ve been waiting a million years for!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2026 Hehe\u2026 Hehehe.\u201d Yao Si felt her lips trembling. She rigidly turned her head. \u201cSo\u2026 this galaxy has a matchmaking center?\u201d</p><br/><p>Mu Xuan\u2019s originally cold face darkened, and a cold and frosty air exuded by him started turning their surroundings into ice.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaybe\u2026 Maybe the person on the screen just looks like you.\u201d Yao Si felt a sudden anxiousness. \u201cYour voice isn\u2019t like that at all\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Before she could finish her sentence, a shrill scream pierced the air.</p><br/><p>\u201cAhahahah! Male God Mu Xuan, my Male God Mu Xuan.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe really is the ruler of bloodlings, so dashing! There\u2019s no question to how he has stayed the reigning champion of the galaxy\u2019s male god ranking list for the past thousand years. He\u2019s my eternal male god!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs this the newest advertisement he endorsed? Makes registering so tempting, if only I could meet such a male god during a matchmaking session.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStop dreaming, he\u2019s a bloodling, he will never fall for another race!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe male gods belong to the public! Male God Mu Xuan, I love you!\u201d</p><br/><p><em>Hmm, it\u2019s him indeed </em>. Yao Si never knew her dad was so popular\u2026</p><br/><p>A wedding advertisement played after, and every new scene ignited stronger screams from the crowd, while Mu Xuan\u2019s face continued to steadily darken.</p><br/><p>\u201cHave you heard? Male God Mu Xuan woke up from his hibernation a year ago.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI never expected him to wake in my lifetime, it\u2019s really good to be alive now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI really want to see him in real life!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMe too!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si stayed quiet. <em>Sis, the male god that you wish to see is right beside me. </em></p><br/><p>Mu Xuan did not utter a word either. <em>It\u2019s about time to hold a meeting with The Elders. </em></p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>To prevent Mu Xuan from turning colder and colder, Yao Si grabbed onto his arm and walked, in large strides, out of the walkway, turning into a quieter and more peaceful corner. Compared to the crowded main road, there was much fewer people here, and the streets were no longer filled with flying advertisements. At first glance, it was a strictly regulated street for the rich.</p><br/><p>After a couple steps down the road, a bunny jumped out straight at her. This lovely critter was gigantic, almost up to half a human\u2019s height. Its fur snowy white and claws thick and meaty, reminding her of the bunnies she\u2019d killed in the game previously, which sent an inch to her hands.</p><br/><p>The bunny jumped up to her and suddenly lifted its paws, passing her a red flower.</p><br/><p>\u201cFor me?\u201d Yao Si stilled.</p><br/><p>The bunny didn\u2019t respond, pushing the flower over once more.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you!\u201d Yao Si took the flower feeling flattered. Jump by jump, the bunny hopped into the distant.</p><br/><p>Yao Si had never expected that the people of the galaxy would be so friendly. She couldn\u2019t help lowering her head, but just as she was about to take a sniff, the red flower exploded with a loud <em>bang </em>.</p><br/><p>The next moment, an enthusiastic and passionate voice spoke up in front of her. \u201cSlyvian\u2019s space storage. It\u2019s three thousand meters worth of space with no need for vacuum packs to save space so you can use all the space available. The sale will open on July\u2019s 4th and it will cost you just 998. Just 998, and you\u2019ll have this wonderful item. Five star products, just 998 each. You can pass by but you definitely can\u2019t let this opportunity go. This is a must-have item in the galaxy, and even Male God Mu Xuan uses it oh~!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p><em>F*ck! All these advertising dogs!</em></p>\n</div>"}

It\u2019s all that person\u2019s fault. Turned you then washed his hands of you, leaving a little youngster like you here unattended. He deserves to be killed with a thousand knives and damned with eternal solitude.\u201d</p><br/><p>He cursed as he took the ID card from her hands. In some mysterious way, the bat-shaped card suddenly turned blinding red, and the number \u20185\u2019 on it transformed into an exclamation mark.</p><br/><p><em>Wow, who would have guessed that this ID card was so high-tech!</em></p><br/><p>\u201cSee this? It is the warning sign for the great war. If you see the card turn this color in the future, don\u2019t wander outside during that time.\u201d He flashed the card around. \u201cIt\u2019s chaotic out there, so my store will also close for the oncoming days. It won\u2019t be operating anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHold up!\u201d Yao Si was still a little muddled. \u201cThat great war you mentioned, what is it? Who are you fighting against?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWith those Western jerks of course.\u201d Li Zheng tapped the chair beside him, gesturing for her to sit down as well, and then began to fill her in.</p><br/><p>The current internal structure among the vampires was not that harmonious, still possessing some conflicts. To sum it all up, the top brass were divided into two factions, the Western and the Eastern. Each side had their own politics and management system.</p><br/><p>Occasionally, both sides would break out into bloody clashes. The principal conflict of it all was their attitude toward humans. The Western side promoted peace and harmony, advocating to live without inferring with each other, minding their own business. The Eastern side, on the other hand, concentrated on integration, suggesting that they should reveal themselves to the humans and promote mutual development. And it was because of this that the two factions were in loggerheads and countless battles were fought.</p><br/><p>\u201cUs bloodlings are already an exotic species, so what\u2019s wrong with converting some humans?\u201d Li Zheng\u2019s face was filled with anguish. \u201cThose Westerners even called themselves the conservatives, but in my opinion they are all reactionaries!\u201d</p><br/><p><em>Ummm\u2026 Why do I feel like we\u2019re more like the reactionaries. </em>\u201cTurning all the humans into bloodlings, only the big antagonistic boss in movies would do such a thing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNonsense\u2026 You must have been watching too many western movies to think like that. Humans are so vulnerable, easily diagnosed with incurable diseases. What\u2019s wrong with being a bloodling when it\u2019s just a change in the diet at most? At least they won\u2019t get sick again.\u201d</p><br/><p>It did make some sense.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnyhow, us bloodlings can only convert one offspring in our lifetime, so to be correct, we\u2019re the ones that suffer from the greatest disadvantage.\u201d</p><br/><p>There was such a setting! However, now that Yao Si thought of that, without the human-blood drinking requirement so often seen in the movies, it wasn\u2019t too shabby being a bloodling. Although they had less options for food, the intelligence of foodies in the great celestial empire was unlimited. If there came a day when all humans were converted, they would probably invent over a hundred ways to cook duck blood alone.</p><br/><p>\u201cSisi, you\u2019re still young, but you can\u2019t learn the way of the Westerners.\u201d He held her hands and said earnestly, \u201cThose western vampire movies and novels are all lying. They\u2019re definitely the tricks of the Western faction; it\u2019s a conspiracy. They\u2019re playing with the public\u2019s opinion. It\u2019s clearly a way to prevent the cultural invasion of the opponent. You must keep a clear mind and be aware!\u201d</p><br/><p>It was hard to tell from first glance that Brother Li had such profound political awareness that even she was being persuaded. Yao Si\u2019s hands ached in his hold. To prevent him from becoming even more agitated, she could only nod her head and agree, expressing her unshakable decision to stay with the Eastern Faction. \u201cI know, my brother, I belong to the Eastern side.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood girl.\u201d He patted her shoulder in joy, then pondered for a second and began to explain again, \u201cBy the way, I heard that this great war isn\u2019t that simple. Old vamps from first, second, and third generation are all mobilized. We lost a lot of our kind over at City A. Even though that battle was far from here, you shouldn\u2019t leave the house for a few days to be safe.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAll right, Brother Li, I understand.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, newborns like you ought to have your fathers next to you to be safe. And now that you\u2019re also a fifth generation, absolutely no\u2026 Wait!\u201d He turned to look at her. \u201cHave you awakened your ability yet?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot even one?\u201d Li Zheng was somewhat surprised. It had been four months already.</p><br/><p>Every newborn bloodling would awaken some, stronger or weaker, special abilities. The most basic were speed, power, and five elemental powers, metal, earth, plants, fire, and water. Others had special powers like control of time or dimensions, but those were rather rare. The strength of the abilities was also connected to the generation, the first generation being the strongest and those below it descending in power.</p><br/><p>\u201cI really haven\u2019t.\u201d Yao Si shook her head. She really didn\u2019t feel anything strange in her body. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s because I\u2019m a fifth-generation. Too weak, that\u2019s why\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not possible. I have seen a sixth-generation bloodling with the ability of super speed.\u201d Despite not being very strong, there was no reason why a fifth-generation bloodlings couldn\u2019t awaken their ability. \u201cAh, if only the person that converted you was here. They could then feel your ability through the blood connection.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all that jerk\u2019s fault. Who leaves their only descendant behind, and now you can\u2019t even\u2026 Argh.\u201d He was halfway through his curses when he suddenly slapped his thigh and said with excitement, \u201cI remember there\u2019s a way that you can test your abilities.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally!\u201d Yao Si bounced to her feet. Even though she was a weakling among the bloodlings, having a special ability was better than nothing. \u201cWhat way?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWait here.\u201d Brother Li turned toward a small compartment behind him and began to fumble through the drawers. It took him a while before he found a long rectangular thing. He passed it over to her with a face full of excitement. \u201cHere it is.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si stared at the object, dumbfounded and unable to snap back to reality. It was\u2026</p><br/><p>She felt the blue veins on her forehead bulge.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother, I am not married.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t been in a relationship either.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNeither have I had any indecent affairs with anyone.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m even a homebody.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo\u2026\u201d The corner of her mouth twitched. \u201cWhy did you give me a pregnancy test kit!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>When Yao Si returned from Li Zheng\u2019s place, the moon had already risen high in the sky.</p><br/><p>To her surprise, the pregnancy test that Li Zheng had given her was actually had the ability to test for special abilities, but it could only identify the abilities from the five elements. By dropping the blood onto the test paper, a strip of color assigned to the ability would appear.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, her blood didn\u2019t reveal any mark at all. She could remember Li Zheng\u2019s teary eyes after there was no result. He then used \u201cThe Three Character Classics\u201d is a piece of ancient Chinese literature written in the 13th century and still taught to young children at primary school. Each line has three characters and each sentence has six which teach a moral principle. The five central themes of \u201cThe Three Character Classics\u201d are benevolence, righteousness, honesty, respect, and filial piety. So what Li Zheng did there is basically cursing that man\u2019s ancestors in a polite manner. Three Character Classics <sup>1</sup> to greet the bloodling who had turned her for a full half an hour.</p><br/><p>Yao Si would be lying if she said that she wasn\u2019t disappointed. She was recently converted, had no sire, and now even couldn\u2019t awaken a single special ability. If that wasn\u2019t enough, she was also a fifth-generation bloodling.</p><br/><p>What did fifth-generation mean? Let\u2019s just say that if Brother Li who was a fourth-generation wasn\u2019t qualified to participate in the fight between the western and eastern sides, then she was a weakling without any worth and who would just be a burden during battle.</p><br/><p>Her ears still echoed with the sympathetic tone Li Zheng had used when she left.</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha, Sisi, maybe your ability is a one in ten million special ability. Don\u2019t look so down.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hell, that was even more tragic!</p><br/><p>Rubbing her nose, she gave up. Who cares, she may as well hurry home and eat a bowl of blood curd to calm herself.</p><br/><p>Squeezing the identity card in her hand that had turned red, she felt nothing toward the war that Brother Li had mentioned, that quarrel between the Western and Eastern factions. Not to mention that not that long ago she was still a good girl who was born under the red flag of socialism, raised in the glorious spring wind, and living in a peaceful era, she had only seen the word war in television and movies.</p><br/><p>Besides, City A in which the violent conflict had occurred was tens of thousands of miles away from City F in which she lived. She was just a fifth-generation weakling who was in no position to enlist, so the flames of the civil war would never affect her.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>A loud sound pierced through the night, and a black silhouette flashed past her. A large, light box suddenly fell from above, landing right before her, and shattered into pieces. Sharp glass scattered across the floor, leaving only a step\u2019s distance between her and the box\u2019s remains.</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph, is your whole Eastern Faction filled with this kind of weaklings?\u201d A disdainful humph sounded from above her head.</p><br/><p><em>Oh shit!</em></p><br/><p>As the words Yao Si had thought moments ago echoed in her head, her confidence went crashing down.</p>\n</div>"}

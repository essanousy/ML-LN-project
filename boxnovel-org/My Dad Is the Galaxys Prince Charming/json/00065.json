The bloodlings\u2019 pride was at stake.</p><br/><p>She took deep breath and, suppressing her tumultuous emotions, turned to face an unexpectedly silent room.</p><br/><p>She scanned the crowd, taking in the dazed expressions. \u201cWha-what\u2019s wrong?\u201d Did her ability fail her?</p><br/><p>\u201cFif-fifth generation\u2026\u201d Finally, one of the bloodlings snapped back to his senses, blurting out what was on his mind. The next second, the entire crowd grew became agitated.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Highness! It\u2019s Her Highness!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTwo years ago when I dropped by the Red Planet, I heard that Her Highness of the fifth generation had returned, but I never took it seriously.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Highness\u2026 Your Highness personally came down to save us.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAhahah! This is amazing, I actually got to meet Her Highness!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t mind getting caught again.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMe too, me too!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMe three!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCount me in!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si was speechless. <em>You guys had followed me in without even knowing who I was? Does the bloodline power really have such immense influence? Is it the inheritance of every generation? </em></p><br/><p>But\u2026</p><br/><p><em>I\u2019m glad my ability didn\u2019t fail! </em></p><br/><p>\u256e(\u256f\u25bd\u2570)\u256d</p><br/><p>After a series of commotions, all of the bloodlings went down on one knee in unison, saluting with the bloodling greeting. Their eyes were bright with an impossible to extinguish glow as they looked up to stare at her, a stark contrast to the dead stares they had not long before. Yao Si started to feel uncomfortable and naked under their intense gazes.</p><br/><p>Gu Shucheng seized this opportunity to squeeze through the crowd. With a slightly superior look that indicated his prior knowledge, he swept the crowd. \u201cYour Highness, together with Luo Ying, I\u2019ve investigated the base.The ships have already left the terminals and there seems to be a field surrounding this base, preventing communication with the outside.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou mean, we can\u2019t get out?\u201d</p><br/><p>Nephew Gu nodded. They were indeed trapped on this deserted tiny planet. And on top of that, it was a planet that no one visited and where the transport was all one-sided, and one sent by the enemies\u2026 Even if they received their call for help, they would probably only come to kill them off.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, everything will be fine, we\u2019ll find a way!\u201d Yao Si wasn\u2019t the least bit worried, and to prove it she patted his shoulder in reassurance. She glanced down to look at the time, but then realized that her optical computer had been destroyed by the force of her ability. Instinctively, she turned to Nephew Gu. \u201cOh right, what time is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Nephew Gu\u2019s optical computer was removed, so he lifted his head towards the screen at the back. \u201c6.47 pm.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, then it\u2019ll be fast.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFast?\u201d Nephew Gu stilled slightly, then quickly understood her words. \u201cYou mean\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s here!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si sighed and lifted her head. From out of nowhere, there was a tear in the sky. It seemingly ripped itself open, and a familiar figure walked out of the portal.</p><br/><p>He headed straight towards Yao Si, with his face cold and taunt, his brows deeply knotted. He said only one sentence to her, \u201cYou\u2019re late by seventeen minutes and thirty-two seconds!\u201d He was wearing an extremely displeased expression.</p><br/><p>Yao Si punched Nephew Gu lightly with a slightly shaky hand. \u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you I\u2019ve a plan?\u201d She then pounced on Mu Xuan. \u201cDad!\u201d</p><br/><p><em>Hurry, transform into a human transport machine and send me back. </em></p>\n</div>"}

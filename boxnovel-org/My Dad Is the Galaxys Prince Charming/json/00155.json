It kept increasing in size, occupying up to half the sky in less than a second. Only when the foliage started to peak through did she manage to make out the image\u2014it was a tree, a gigantic one.</p><br/><p>Besides, it seemed to be growing in all directions, even the grounds started to shake from it\u2019s growth.</p><br/><p>Yao Si inhaled deeply. \u201cRun!\u201d She grabbed onto Lian Yu and dashed away frantically.</p><br/><p>Maybe due to the appearance of the tree, they found a way out of the originally closed off road. The ancient-looking yard had turned into a barren land, with nothing but the tree\u2019s roots.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat exactly happened? What\u2019s wrong with the tree?\u201d Yao Si asked through her pants.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the heavenly sylvian king tree!\u201d Lian Yu turned back toward the tree that was still growing rapidly. \u201cI had placed the heart of the tree in the Rainbow Pond to release the restriction, but I never expected that the tree would grow so suddenly after.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat king tree?\u201d Yao Si stilled. Wasn\u2019t the heart of the tree in her aircraft? When did it become the king tree?</p><br/><p>\u201cThe king tree is the king of the trees, and it grows into the heavenly sylvian king\u2019s tree.\u201d Lian Yu was a face of worry as she pointed to the tree. \u201cThat\u2026 was originally my brother.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? <em>\u201d F*ck, aren\u2019t you an aves? How did you get a brother from the heavenly sylvian race? </em> \u201cWhat\u2019s your\u2026 mother\u2019s family name?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s complicated.\u201d The queen grew increasingly more frantic. \u201cMy brother is the twin son of heavenly sylvian king, but when he was born, he was just a seed that hadn\u2019t awakened. Even after many years, he could only grow into the flower of the heavenly tree. That\u2019s why I never expected\u2026 him to grow so rapidly because of the Rainbow Pond.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lian Yu\u2019s resistance to the fog was due to the heavenly sylvian genes within her.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do we do now?\u201d They couldn\u2019t just let it grow on forever?</p><br/><p>\u201cSisi, don\u2019t worry.\u201d The queen patted her own chest, her face full of confidence. \u201cEven though he hasn\u2019t awakened, he is still my brother. Even though he wasn\u2019t able to recognize me previously, he won\u2019t hurt me as soon as I return to my original form.\u201d</p><br/><p>She took a firm step forward before starting to enlarge, the massive wings emerging from her back. In a blink of an eye, she was back to how she looked the first time Yao Si had laid her eyes on her. Her massive wings flapped, sweeping gushes of torrential winds around the barren Rainbow Pond. Gradually, the tree that had been growing maniacally stopped.</p><br/><p>Lian Yu took the opportunity to shout at him, \u201cXi Mu, I\u2019m your sister. Be good\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Piak! With a loud sound, the tree directed a huge branch over toward them. With a tremble, Lian Yu shrank back down and was sent flying.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Yao Si.</p><br/><p>-_-|||</p><br/><p><em>F*ck! Weren\u2019t you confident that it would be fine? </em></p><br/><p>Before Yao Si could process the situation, another branch came flying over towards Lian Yu who had shrank down to normal size.</p><br/><p><em>F*ck, f*ck, f*ck!</em></p><br/><p>Yao Si\u2019s heart sank. She dashed forward to embrace Lian Yu and bring her out of harm\u2019s way.</p><br/><p>With a loud eruption, a hole about a metre deep formed at the spot where Lian Yu had been. Yao Si felt her blood go cold. She bolted while dragging a certain queen who had been knocked out senseless toward shelter.</p><br/><p>Only when they were finally out of the tree\u2019s attack range did they heave a sigh of relief, cold sweat dripping out their backs uncontrollably. If they had been even a second slower, they would have definitely become minced meat.</p><br/><p>\u201cSisi\u2026\u201d Lian Yu glanced at her in a daze, either too startled or frightened of the situation.</p><br/><p>Yao Si took a deep breath as fear still lingered in her heart. \u201cAre you biological siblings?\u201d <em>The tree doesn\u2019t seem to treat you as a sister. </em></p><br/><p>Lian Yu remained motionless, but something flashed past her eyes. Sniffing, she muttered pitifully, \u201cHe-he used to be obedient, really!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEnough, enough.\u201d Yao Si pointed toward the tree that had grown another couple meters. \u201cYour idea isn\u2019t effective; he can\u2019t recognize your right now. We can only head in secretly to the heart of the tree. Now that the entire Rainbow Pond is covered b it, is there any other route we can use?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is\u2026\u201d The queen hesitated before nodding. \u201cBut it will be dangerous.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s not bother too much about that and head over first.\u201d If the queen\u2019s brother was going to grow as big as the heavenly sylvian king, the entire planet was going to end up in ruins, and Yao Si had to think about Mu Xuan who was still trapped in the fog\u2026</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t dare to go down that train of thought and followed Lian Yu to the back of the house. Probably due to the tree\u2019s massive size, they were no longer chased by the branches.</p><br/><p>Lian Yu brought them toward a huge green gate that was the height of at least two people and whose top was filled with green roots. They were unlike those from Lian Yu\u2019s brother that was newly formed with the scent of soil, but were deeply rooted and seemed to have been here for many years.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is part of the restricted region, and the Rainbow Pond is inside there. But\u2026 this is the heavenly sylvian king\u2019s root system, and it will require a strong blazing weapon to break through. It is also immune to all wood abilities.\u201d She seemed troubled. \u201cWe won\u2019t be able to enter even with my wood ability.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have a wood ability?\u201d Yao Si asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course! Besides that of aves, there is heavenly sylvian blood running through me as well.\u201d She lifted her hands, a seedling starting to form on her palms. \u201cSo we need to find weapons\u2014\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere isn\u2019t a need!\u201d Yao Si interrupted her. With her hands directed at the door, she sent out the burst of energy that was surging within her. A torrential flame appeared, morphing into a fire dragon that burnt the root system into a pile of ashes.</p><br/><p>Lian Yu stared at her with wide eyes, glancing at the pile of ashes that covered the ground. Her whole being was in shock. \u201cYou-you have a fire ability\u2026 Aren\u2019t you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p><em>Hey, hey, hey! What\u2019s with your expression?</em></p><br/><p>(\u256f\u2035\u25a1\u2032)\u256f\ufe35\u253b\u2501\u253b</p><br/><p><em>My little contradictory ability can be quite reliable, okay! </em></p><br/><p>\u201cLets go in first!\u201d Yao Si stepped through the pile of ashes, entering. There was a path inside that led underground. Probably due to her fire ability, the surroundings were all black and dark.</p><br/><p>Surprisingly, the interior wasn\u2019t dark and was instead brighter the farther they ventured. There was even a faint blue glow straight ahead.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe surrounding restriction seems to have lost effect\u2026\u201d Lian Yu caressed the black stone wall before pointing ahead. \u201cThe Rainbow Pond is right here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si hurried forward, to where an endless blue stream came into sight. Even though there wasn\u2019t any barrier between the pathway and the stream, the water didn\u2019t pour over toward them and had simply risen upwards instead.</p></div>\n</div>"}

What\u2019s starting? Explain yourself! </em></p><br/><p>Before Yao Si could ask her questions, more black holes opened up around them. Suddenly, with a slight falter, she was almost blown to the planet behind her by the space fall outs.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you have a brain?\u201d Lin Long reached out to grab her. \u201cThere\u2019s so many portals here, so the space is definitely unstable. Hurry and activate your ability to block the force.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si was speechless. \u201cI don\u2019t have an ability now!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo ability?\u201d Lin Long was struck dumb, sweeping her a glance before looking away in confusion. \u201cDo you think I\u2019m blind? Was it air you summoned back on the Red Planet when you were eliminating my blood fog?\u201d</p><br/><p><em>F*ck, if it wasn\u2019t because of you, full-series ability pervert, would I be relegated to such a state?</em></p><br/><p>\u201cForget it, you don\u2019t need to do much anyways.\u201d Lin Long grabbed her hand nonchalantly. She then felt something enveloping her, chasing away the forces that had been attacking her. \u201cLook at your weakling self. Steady now and stop fidgeting about, since I won\u2019t care if you fall to your death. Heh.\u201d He glared at her with fury, but still took a subconscious step forward, shielding her behind himself.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d The corners of Yao Si\u2019s lips twitched, and she stuck out her middle finger behind him. <em>F*ck, let go if you dare! I\u2019ll head back to the Red Planet to lodge a complaint. I\u2019ll get my guardian to bash you up!</em></p><br/><p>Yao Si exploded into a hurricane of curses internally while the black holes started to grow increasingly distorted. With a a ripping sound, a crack appeared, and a gigantic white figure came climbing out.</p><br/><p>It was a white gigantic beast that she had never seen before. Its skin was covered in white scales. It had a fish-like figure, but numerous legs while its back was covered in rows of sharp thorn-like objects. Even though it seemed a distance away, its size was similar to that of the planet behind them.</p><br/><p>Such magnitude could only belong to\u2026 a galactic beast!</p><br/><p>(\u2299_\u2299)</p><br/><p>Yao Si inhaled, but before she could ask Lin Long about his intentions, galactic beasts started to pour out of the other black holes, each one of them different. Some were scary, some were slightly more tame and peace loving, but every single one of them was as big as a planet.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow is it? My pets are impressive, right?\u201d Lin Long glanced at the galactic beasts with pride. With a wave of his hand, several screens lit up and he started operating them.</p><br/><p><em>Pets?! How the f*ck do they look like pets!</em></p><br/><p>(\u256f\u2035\u25a1\u2032)\u256f\ufe35\u253b\u2501\u253b</p><br/><p>The alliance had gone all out in their inspection, eradicating the majority of the breeding farms, so why were there still so many galactic beasts? Based on the amount of the black holes that were already on the edge, there should be a few hundreds, no, more like at least a thousand of them already!</p><br/><p>What exactly was he up to?</p><br/><p>Yao Si\u2019s heart clenched, and a term that a certain someone favored floated the front of her mind\u2014taking revenge on society! Was he without a contractor for too long and went crazy while searching, to the point that he intended to destroy the entire Galaxy?</p><br/><p>With the number of galactic beasts\u2026 it was totally possible!</p><br/><p>How could the Galaxy withstand such an enormous army of galactic beasts? With just a bite, a whole planet would be gone.</p><br/><p>At that moment though, the white beast directly in front of them opened its mouth to swallow\u2026 another galactic beast!</p><br/><p>Eh, eh, eh?!</p><br/><p>\u03a3(\u00b0\u25b3\u00b0|||)\ufe34</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 eating its kind!\u201d Yao Si and her little partner\u2026 No, she was the only one in shock! Lin Long didn\u2019t seem the least bit affected. He only glanced to the side before burying his head back into his work, typing away.</p><br/><p>Was it a hallucination or did she see the galactic beast increase in size after it had eaten its own kind? Even the scales on its back and body seemed to have grown sharper than before.</p><br/><p>Yao Si turned toward the other galactic beasts and was left dumbfounded. The galactic beast in front of them wasn\u2019t an isolated case. The others were swallowing each other as well, showing not a hint of love and care.</p><br/><p>What was going on?</p><br/><p>This internecine strife didn\u2019t seem one bit like taking revenge on the society!</p><br/><p>In less than half an hour, the sky full of galactic beasts was half cleared, and in a while more, only the strongest one would remain. This method\u2026</p><br/><p>Yao Si stilled. With a flash, an absurd realization dawned on her.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are rearing pets!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPets?\u201d Lin Long fell into a momentary daze before wrapping his mind around what she meant, and he didn\u2019t seem to mind one bit what she said as he continued to type. \u201cMmh, the idea is there, but I intend to create the king of the beasts.\u201d</p><br/><p>King of the beasts! Why would he need that?</p><br/><p>The numbers started to dwindle, and soon, there were only two left. One of them was the white beast Yao Si had noticed at the start while the other was a black one. On closer inspection, she realized that she hadn\u2019t been hallucinating previously. The two beasts were indeed much bigger than before, and the scales that were originally white now had a slight reddish taint. Had they advanced in level?</p><br/><p>Yao Si\u2019s frown eased slightly, and she took a deeper breath. Lin Long probably wasn\u2019t after absolute destruction since a troop of galactic beasts was far more advantageous than just one evolved king of the beasts. Besides, even though his breeding farms were situated all over the place, he transported all of the beasts to the abyss, so it was obvious that he wanted to avoid civilization.</p><br/><p>Lin Long started to type more aggressively. The satisfactory results were probably a source of motivation, since even his expression was growing more animated by the minute. \u201cGreat! The numbers are getting closer to perfect.\u201d He tapped open the last screen before finally coming to a halt. There were two galactic beast on the screen with a row of statistics in red: Ancient data similarity\u201490%!</p><br/><p>The last two galactic beasts fought an intense battle, and the instant the black galactic beast engulfed the white one, the percentage on Lin Long\u2019s screen jumped up to 99%.</p><br/><p>\u201cFinally\u2026 finally it\u2019s complete, hahahahaha\u2026\u201d Lin Long laughed loudly. It sounded as though his long standing wish had been fulfilled. With a long sigh, he turned toward Yao Si abruptly. \u201cThere\u2019s one more step left.\u201d</p><br/><p>She stilled, but he wasn\u2019t looking at her. Instead, his gaze rested on the blue planet behind her.</p><br/><p>Lin Long waved his arm, and a bright ray of light bolted toward the last galactic beast. It wasn\u2019t meant for murder but rather to attract its attention as it flew towards the beast\u2019s horns.</p><br/><p>The black galactic beast roared, turning to dash at them. As it approached, its size became apparent\u2014it was much bigger than the blue planet behind them! The beast opened its mouth as it pounced toward them.</p><br/><p>Lin Long tugged Yao Si, and the next second they were behind the planet. The galactic beast\u2019s mouth grew even wider, preparing to engulf the entire blue planet.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou just have to eat it to become the king of the galactic beasts!\u201d Lin Long exclaimed excitedly as he focused all his attention on the galactic beast.</p><br/><p>The only reason he reconstructed the blue planet was to feed it to the galactic beast!</p><br/><p>\u201cThe difference elimination is complete with all the areas matching! My efforts to reconstruct that entire planet hadn\u2019t gone to waste.\u201d His smile widened further as the galactic beast\u2019s mouth inched shut, preparing to finish off the planet. Even the percentage on the screen had started to jump: 99.4%\u202699.5%\u202699.6%\u202699.7%\u2026</p><br/><p>Lin Long gripped his hands in anticipation, barely suppressing the joy within him.</p><br/><p>\u201cHahahaha, its been millions of years. After rearing them for such a long time, the day has finally arrived. With the king beast, I will definitely leave\u2014\u201d</p><br/><p>Before he could complete his sentence, several white rays flashed past them. Almost instantly, both the gigantic beast and the planet were dissected into tiny tofu-like pieces that spread through the abyss.</p><br/><p>Yao Si felt a tightening around her waist, and the next moment, she entered a familiar embrace. \u201cSisi, don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m here,\u201d Mu Xuan comforted her with worry in his voice.</p><br/><p>The percentage on the screens remained stationary at 99.9% for a time before falling down to zero.</p><br/><p>[Didi! Target dead, similarity failed!]</p><br/><p>[Didi! Target dead, similarity failed!]</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Yao Si.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Lin Long.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Mu Xuan who came to save Yao Si.</p><br/><p>Silence fell on them.</p><br/><p>After half a minute\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck, I\u2019m going to kill you lovebirds!\u201d</p><br/><p>(\u256f\u2035\u25a1\u2032)\u256f\ufe35\u253b\u2501\u253b</p></div>\n</div>"}

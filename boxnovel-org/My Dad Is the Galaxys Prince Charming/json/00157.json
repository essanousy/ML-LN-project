How was that possible? Weren\u2019t the first thirty generations all wiped out?</p><br/><p>(\u256f\u2035\u25a1\u2032)\u256f\ufe35\u253b\u2501\u253b</p><br/><p>Yao Si started to feel out of place; her position as an ancestor was in jeopardy.</p><br/><p>\u201cMu Xuan, do you know him?\u201d He was the only person who has been here ever since the Earth\u2019s time. If a first generation was still alive, Mu Xuan should know him?</p><br/><p>Unexpectedly, Mu Xuan shook his head. \u201cI have never seen him before.\u201d His aura was unfamiliar. He had never seen such a first generation before, even back when he was on earth,</p><br/><p>\u201cThen\u2026\u201d Who was he?</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know for now.\u201d Mu Xuan tightened his grip around her, his expression serious. \u201cI don\u2019t think we can continue with this tour anymore. Sisi, let\u2019s return\u2014\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSisi, look over at the Heavenly Planet!\u201d Before he could finish, Lian Yu exclaimed as she flew over with her seedling brother.</p><br/><p>Yao Si turned and saw a blue substance starting to form in the middle of the dissected planet. It was enlarging as a figure shook within it.</p><br/><p>What was that?</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the Rainbow Pond!\u201d Lian Yu exclaimed. \u201cWhy is it growing when the planet is already gone?\u201d</p><br/><p>The fluid recollected, forming a circular shape and eating up the fragments at the side as though a new water-based planet was being formed.</p><br/><p>In less than ten minutes, the formation was almost the size of a tiny planet.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow did the Rainbow Pond do this? Wha-what exactly is\u2026 this?\u201d Lian Yu muttered..</p><br/><p>Mu Xuan brought Yao Si away while warning them in a deep voice. \u201cThere\u2019s something inside.\u201d</p><br/><p><em>What?</em></p><br/><p>Yao Si took a closer look, and, indeed, in the middle of the water ball was something moving. On closer inspection\u2026</p><br/><p><em>Howl!</em></p><br/><p>A painful, shrill cry came from within as a massive figure burst out\u2014it was a gigantic beast that wasn\u2019t fully formed. There wasn\u2019t any skin covering the upper half of its body, just flesh and blood with bones sticking out in places. It was covered in a yellowish fluid that was mixed with blood and water from the planet. A bunch of organs came falling out of its body.</p><br/><p>Yao Si was suddenly reminded of the bastard\u2019s words. He mentioned that Lian Yu\u2019s brother had polluted the water, which probably meant the one that had been in the Rainbow Pond.</p><br/><p>Yet what\u2026 had he been harvesting?</p><br/><p>The beast moved rapidly. He seemed to have sensed their existence and opened its huge mouth toward the three of them.</p><br/><p>Yao Si froze. Even though it was a frightening image, she wasn\u2019t afraid. It seemed almost familiar as the massive beast was about to swallow them any minute.</p><br/><p>Mu Xuan lifted his hand, summoning a flame toward the beast. Before it could even howl, it had already turned into a pile of ashes together with the water ball.</p><br/><p>\u201cMu Xuan, there\u2019s something behind!\u201d Yao Si tapped his arm, pointing toward the planet.</p><br/><p>The water was gone, but among the floating pieces was a black dot. When compared to the beast, it was extremely tiny.</p><br/><p>With a flash, Mu Xuan flew them over. The black dot was a blue hole, its inside pitch dark and flat almost like a burn in a piece of paper. It was unlike the black hole in the universe that devoured everything nearby, but was silent and unmoving, just like a picture. However, it emitted an eerie aura that brought about discomfort.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is\u2026 this?!\u201d Yao Si asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Mu Xuan shook his head, his brows coming together into a tight knot. \u201cIt looks like a transportation method, but I can\u2019t be sure where it leads to. Either way, it won\u2019t lead to someone pleasant.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat aves!\u201d He suddenly turned toward Lian Yu.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh?\u201d With her brother in her hands, she replied instinctively before catching herself. Glaring at him, she asked irritably, \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>Love rival!</p><br/><p>\u256d\u2229\u256e\uff08\ufe36\ufe3f\ufe36\uff09\u256d\u2229\u256e</p><br/><p>\u201cInform the heavenly sylvians and get them to block off the area.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lian Yu frowned, then glanced at Yao Si who was still in his arms and poated. \u201cI\u2019m the queen, why must I listen to you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhatever!\u201d Mu Xuan\u2019s face darkened, and his voice hardened. \u201cThis isn\u2019t the bloodlings\u2019 domain anyways!\u201d</p><br/><p>Without another word, he lifted his hand to open a portal to the Red Planet. Caressing his cub, he said, \u201cLet\u2019s head home first.\u201d He needed to investigate that first generation man more.</p><br/><p>\u201cEr, wait a minute, Sisi\u2026\u201d Just as Lian Yu was about to stop them, they disappeared. She stomped her feet in frustration; she had known that the bastard would snatch her Sisi!</p><br/><p><em>Heh, all heterosexual love will end in disaster!</em></p><br/><p><em>My Sisi\u2026</em></p><br/><p>\u3012\u25bd\u3012</p><br/><p>Silently, she cursed a certain someone over a hundred times before switching on her optical computer indignantly to contact the heavenly sylvians. Who knew what else the Heavenly Planet would do, so it was better to get someone to check on it. After all, half of it belonged to the heavenly sylvians.</p><br/><p>She contacted the king directly, informing him about what had happened in great detail. He then acted swiftly, delegating jobs to his people. After settling the matter, the queen could no longer keep her indignation under control.</p><br/><p>\u201cUncle, I think I\u2019m out of love\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOut of love? When did you get a partner? Why wasn\u2019t I informed! Didn\u2019t you just dismiss the aerial prince, even declaring to stay single forever?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat was the past, I never expected to meet her.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Yu, that\u2019s the right decision. For the aves, you really should form a family. When do you intend to register your marriage? Hahaha\u2026 our Little Yu is finally going to get married.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBur she has a boyfriend.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s there to be afraid, I\u2019ll just snatch her over. You are the aves queen after all! Wait\u2026 boyfriend? It\u2019s a woman?!\u201d</p><br/><p>(\u2299 o \u2299)</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Is it not permitted?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEr\u2026 you can, of course you can, hehe\u2026 whatever makes you happy. Come, tell your uncle who this lucky person is. How old is she? Who is her boyfriend? Do you need uncle to kill him for you? Oh right, which race is he from?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe is a bloodling.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, blood\u2026 What!\u201d There was a moment of silence. \u201cNiece Yu, how could you end up in such a hopeless situation.\u2026 Why not consider someone else instead?\u201d He would even accept a beast.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I like Sisi.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSisi?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy dearest Sisi, she is Si Yao. Isn\u2019t it nice? Doesn\u2019t it sound endearing and likeable?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy does\u2026 this name sound so familiar?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to the Red Planet to find her and separate that pair! Goodbye uncle! Oh, that bastard is called Mo Xuan. I think he\u2019s also a bloodling.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSiyao, Mo Xuan\u2026 Mu-Mu Xuan!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u03a3(\u00b0\u25b3\u00b0|||)\ufe34</p><br/><p>Thump, thump, thump.</p><br/><p>A bunch of objects came falling onto the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Yu, come back!!!\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

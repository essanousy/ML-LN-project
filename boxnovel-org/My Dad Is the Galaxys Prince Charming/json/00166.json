Such racial discrimination triggered her the most. \u201cIf we are rabies carriers, shouldn\u2019t we be grateful to the \u2018mad dogs\u2019 from your kind?\u201d</p><br/><p>She placed specific emphasis on the last few words, and Lin Long stiffened, realizing that he had been dragged into the insult.</p><br/><p>But Yao Si had never expected Lin Long to be an ancestor. Even Mu Xuan had been mistaken, taking him to be a first-generation bloodling. Mu Xuan was probably not aware of the other details as well, so she could only ask Lin Long personally.</p><br/><p>\u201cTell me, what exactly is a contractor? You also mentioned that you\u2019re an ancestor, so how many ancestors like you are there?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry about that.\u201d Lin Long waved his hand dismissively/ \u201cIn this world, there was only me and old man. Oh, I can painfully acknowledge your pure breed as one too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s a pure breed?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course it\u2019s someone like me, a pure bloodling.\u201d He pointed to himself. \u201cYour so-called bloodlings are all converted from earthlings with only a portion of the characteristics of my race, so you cannot be considered real bloodlings.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not an earthling!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course not! How can I be from such an inferior race?\u201d He scoffed in disdain.</p><br/><p>Yao Si felt a vein pop on her forehead as she struggled to ignore the urge to beat him up. The pure breeds he mentioned referred to the people who had awakened the ancestral bloodline. \u201cWhat exactly is a contractor?\u201d</p><br/><p>He turned to glance at her with a myriad of expressions on his face. He seemed glad and worried, but with a hint of either envy or jealousy and hatred. She couldn\u2019t say for sure, but he was unusually focused, sending her heart in a frenzy. Instinctively, she took a step back.</p><br/><p>\u201cOur race spends their entire life looking for their contractor, and only lucky ones find theirs.\u201d He pointed toward her with resentment. \u201cJust like that lucky bloodling of yours\u201d</p><br/><p>Luck\u2026 Wasn\u2019t he rather appreciative of Mu Xuan previously? How did things turn sour?</p><br/><p>\u201cBut the majority are forever in search. Those who are mentally stronger carry on with their hope while those that aren\u2019t\u2026 end up just like the old man, going crazy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEr\u2026\u201d Who gave the pervert rights to call someone else crazy? \u201cAre the contractors the same as cubs?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho would be the same as you guys?\u201d Disdain clouded his face as he semeed determined to draw a clear line between the two races. \u201cBastards can get a cub by randomly biting anyone, so how can that ridiculous setup be compared with our one and only contractor?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 <em>\u201d Hey, how are the bloodlings ridiculous? Besides, there is only one cub to each bloodling. </em></p><br/><p>\u201cContractors aren\u2019t the same.\u201d Lin Long\u2019s eyes started to glaze as a thought struck him. \u201cThat is the only reason for our existence. To find our one true contractor is considered an honor among us. They are a treasure of our life, our soul mate, and we would never be able to reject a contractor\u2019s request. Only when we manage to find our contractor can we be complete; it isn\u2019t just any random person.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEr\u2026\u201d Which after removing all those excessive descriptions means that\u2026 \u201cYou guys are eternally looking for a perfect partner?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Long stilled, the glazed look replaced by a deep flush. A weird thought must have struck him, for he even started stuttering. \u201cIf-if that\u2019s the contractor\u2019s wish, it-it isn\u2019t\u2026. impossible to marry. Besides\u2026 besides that\u2019s our only chance. Once we find our contractor, we will never leave them till death.\u201d</p><br/><p>So\u2026 the ancestor that had created the bloodlings of today was just a single dog that had gone crazy from looking for his wife?</p><br/><p>Why did it suddenly seem like her own race wasn\u2019t that sacred? <em>Return my respect! </em></p><br/><p>(\u256f\u2035\u25a1\u2032)\u256f\ufe35\u253b\u2501\u253b</p><br/><p>She turned to glance at a certain someone who was still immersed in his dreams. Just then, a question struck her\u2026</p><br/><p>Yao Si tapped onto his shoulder, asking seriously, \u201cBro, I have a question\u2026 how long have you been single?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Lin Long froze, his face paling instantly.</p><br/><p>After half a minute, he blew up. It was as though someone had touched a sensitive spot\u2014all his hair stood up as if he was an enraged lion.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat has that got to do with you? I\u2019m not the only one obsessed with finding my contractor to the point the concept of time has become blurred! Have I disrupted their lovey dovey interactions? Do you think everyone is like your pure breed, this lucky?</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be haughty just cause you have found yours! What\u2019s wrong with single dogs? Single dogs have hope as well, alright? We have an endless sea of opportunities.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you guys the only ones allowed to find their partners? Are we single dogs not allowed? Do you think contractors are like cabbage, a dollar per kg and easily located?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck, what\u2019s so great about finding your contractor?! Can contractors be eaten like duck blood curd? Contractors\u2026 Con\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck! I just can\u2019t find mine! I\u2019m just a little slow! I\u2019m still locating her, so what\u2019s wrong?!</p><br/><p>\u201cHeh!I have never seen anyone who only lived for a couple million years finding their contractor! Only that one of yours has been blessed with such luck. He is the one and only one like that! Are you happy, are you satisfied?</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it wasn\u2019t because we can\u2019t harm someone else\u2019s contractor, do you really think I would have suppress myself to this extent, keeping you here to infuriate myself? This is all because of that pure breed of yours.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a contractor, I\u2019m single but I\u2019m proud. What\u2019s. Wrong. With. That?</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck\u2026 it\u2019s all because of that lucky pure breed. F*ck, I\u2019ve scoured the whole place twice, but there\u2019s still no sign of her, so how could he find his! That damn old man couldn\u2019t find his after so much trouble, so who gave yours the rights to find his? Why him!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Long started to grow increasingly agitated, his complaints coming out like water from a broken tap. His entire being seemed engulfed in a layer called \u2018hatred\u2019.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d The confused Yao Si.</p><br/><p>What\u2026 exactly had she said?</p><br/><p>\u25cb|\uffe3|_</p><br/><p>Yao Si suddenly felt a need to stay clear of single dogs. They could get really frightening.</p><br/><p>Lin Long\u2019s complains went on for half an hour. In the beginning, it was directed toward her, but as he went on, the insults started to gear toward Mu Xuan, down to every strand of his hair. This was definitely the first time in Mu Xuan\u2019s male god history that he had been insulted to such an extent, and the crux of the content was because\u2026 he had a contractor.</p><br/><p>-_-|||</p><br/><p>With Lin Long\u2019s infuriated howls, Yao Si could feel the entire Galaxy flooding with a sour scent\u2014a single dog\u2019s jealousy?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you cool down with a drink?\u201d She hurriedly took a bottle of spiritual beast blood curd out of her optical computer and passed it over.</p><br/><p>Lin Long grabbed the drink and finally stopped to take a breather. He downed a mouthful while glaring at her. His expression seemed to say: Even the best composer wouldn\u2019t be able to form a medley of my sorrow.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat else do you want to say?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEr\u2026 one more question!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShoot!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat exactly is the ancestor?\u201d she asked. \u201cOr maybe I should rephrase my question\u2026 where did the ancestors come from?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Long opened his mouth to answer. \u201cOf course we\u2019re\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Before he could finish his sentence, the silent space before them started to morph. The sea of darkness seemed to be ripped apart as a gigantic hole opened up. In no time, the hole widened enough to fill up their whole vision.</p><br/><p>But it still continued to widen as though something was ripping it from the inside.</p><br/><p>Yao Si\u2019s heart clenched as goose bumps rose on her skin.</p><br/><p><em>F*ck! What\u2019s wrong now?</em></p></div>\n</div>"}

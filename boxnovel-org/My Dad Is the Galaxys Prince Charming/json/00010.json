If all the survivors were turned into bloodlings, then how do you have newborn bloodlings?\u201d If only the Blue Planet\u2019s people could be converted into bloodlings, then the reality didn\u2019t make sense.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood question!\u201d Yan Xuan was pleased and praised her. \u201cAble to realize this problem, my little baby is really smart.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He clicked on the textbook generated by the optical computer in his hand and pulled up some materials to continue his explanation.</p><br/><p>\u201cIndeed, we bloodlings cannot reproduce, and every bloodling can only convert one descendant,\u201d he stated with a solemn face. \u201cThat\u2019s why the first bite for the bloodlings is a once in a lifetime thing, it is extremely important. Unless it is done by absolute necessity, like during the doomsday era that happened on the Blue Planet before\u2014only then may it be free of this worry. It is because of that the population of every generation of bloodlings is fixed, with a base number of around three thousand. That\u2019s why we are also called the third species.\u201d</p><br/><p>The third species, so it was also because of this that Dr. Wang and others called Earth the third planet?</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough the Blue Planet\u2019s people no longer exist\u201d\u2014Yan Xuan sighed\u2014\u201dbut with the genetic technology today, we can replicate the original Blue Planet\u2019s people as long as we find their genes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cClones!\u201d Yao Si\u2019s eyes widened.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. But\u2026\u201d He shook his head in pity. \u201cThe genes are all unique, those that get successfully replicated are rare. That\u2019s why even with this kind of technology, the success rates are still very low, and the Blue Planet\u2019s people that finally get replicated have, more or less, some original genetic traits.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGenetic traits?\u201d What did that mean?</p><br/><p>\u201cFor example, memories from their past life and things like that.\u201d He looked at her, his smile making his eyes narrow into a thin line. \u201cJust like you, my little baby.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si was distracted. She finally understood that he thought what she said earlier were the memories brought about by these genes, that\u2019s why he wasn\u2019t surprised at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut, my baby, don\u2019t worry, these memories will fade away in no time.\u201d He caressed her head and comforted her, \u201cSoon you will return to your real self, a good, obedient baby. Until then, there are things which my baby will have to learn, lots and lots of them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Was that why he was determined to call her baby? But she really wasn\u2019t a clone!</p><br/><p>\u201cYou might initially have other flaws in you as well,\u201d Yan Xuan speculated. \u201cThat\u2019s why your father would have let you go into hibernation at such a young age, but he probably didn\u2019t predict that because of the Planet Termination Plan you would be awakened before the scheduled time.\u201d His brows creased, some evidence of anger appearing on his face.</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, my baby, you don\u2019t need to worry, when we get home we will investigate and find out. We will examine your bloodline while we\u2019re at it, to see which generation of bloodlings my baby you belong.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know about my bloodline.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Yan Xuan raised his brows and asked, \u201cDid your sire tell you before you went into hibernation? What generation are you, my baby?\u201d</p><br/><p>She hesitatingly extended five fingers. \u201cFive.\u201d So what if she was a fifth generation weakling.</p><br/><p>\u201cFifty? Or five hundred?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026What?\u201d Yao Si was confused by his questions, what were those numbers?</p><br/><p>\u201cCan\u2019t remember?\u201d Yan Xuan exhaled and caressed her head to assure her it was all fine. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, you\u2019ve done a good job, it\u2019s difficult to even remember the number five. There aren\u2019t many bloodlings around fiftieth generations, we might need some time to find them, but it would be easy to track down those of our kind who are from five-hundredth generation that have a descendant.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHold\u2026 Hold on!\u201d Her heart suddenly quivered, an absurd idea suddenly popping up in her mind. \u201cUncle\u2026 Yan, can I ask what generation are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Xuan smiled as his eyes narrowed into a line with that \u201cgood uncle who satisfies children\u2019s curiosity\u201d expression. \u201cUncle\u2019s bloodline is quite close to the front, I am a forty-eighth generation bloodling.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cForty-eighth!\u201d Yao Si\u2019s eyes popped out with shock. What the hell, how was this possible? This pull on the progress bar was way too fast, a second ago she was just looking at the first three generations having a catfight on the streets. \u201cWhat about the first ten generations?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe first ten generations of bloodlings ceased to exist before the doomsday, they are a thing of the legends,\u201d Yan Xuan answered patiently. \u201cOther that his majesty, everyone else of our kind are bloodlings from the thirtieth generation and onward.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThirty\u2026 Onward!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe youngest newborns are almost seven hundredth down the lineage. My baby, you don\u2019t need to worry, you are not of the youngest generations.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSe\u2026 Seven hundredth!\u201d That was way too far.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Looking at her dumbstruck face, Yan Xuan thought she was dissatisfied with her bloodline and continued to reassure her, \u201cMy baby, your bloodline hasn\u2019t been confirmed yet, maybe you\u2019re not after the five hundredth generation. If you are from around the fiftieth generation, then you my darling baby would be the princess of our kind.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPrincess? No no no\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p><em>\u2018There\u2019s no way I\u2019m your princess, because I\u2019m your ancestor!\u2019</em></p><br/><p>She would have never thought that the bloodlings had continued for so many generations. Every bloodling in the entire galaxy was now from two digit generations and counting, and according to the elemental law, the closer your rank was to the top the stronger your ability was.</p><br/><p>Did that mean her pre-fifth generation weakling self could now walk around sideways like a crab <sup>1</sup> and not need to be afraid of anyone.</p><br/><p>Ha\u2026 Haha\u2026 Hahaha\u2026</p><br/><p>Who would have thought that one day a weakling like her would get an opportunity to shine!</p><br/><p>The happiness had struck her too unexpectedly, she needed some time to recover.</p><br/><p>The gods had suddenly become so nice to her, and she was still not used to it.</p><br/><p>\u201cMinister Yan, I\u2019m actually\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Beep beep beep\u2026</p><br/><p>Before she could finish her sentence, the optical computer on Yan Xuan\u2019s wrist suddenly rang with a notification. A semi-transparent red flower floated out from the screen, shimmering with light.</p><br/><p>\u201cArrived so soon.\u201d He stood up and helped her up by holding her hands. \u201cThe person that is picking us up arrived. If my baby still has anything you want to know, how about uncle will answer you when we get home?\u201d</p><br/><p>He said that and then dragged her out the door. Yao Si was forced to swallow the words that were rolling on her tongue.</p><br/><p>On second thought, with his trend of treating her as a baby, even if she said she was from the fifth generation, he wouldn\u2019t believe her. May as well wait until they got back and tested the bloodlines.</p><br/><p>No worries, she will show him how freaking awesome she was when they got back!</p><br/><p>\u201cThe uncle that is picking us up is called Li Yue, he\u2019s a friend of Uncle Yan from another species.\u201d Yan Xuan brought her to the platform where she had seen Earth disintegrate into nothing.</p><br/><p>Only then did Yao SI realize that there were already a lot of people\u2014a rough estimation would be around a few hundred\u2014who were lining up in a perfect formation. Once they noticed that they had exited, they saluted in a uniform manner. The person that was standing at the very front was Lu Ren, who had a bitter smile lingering on his face, and behind him was the deputy commander and Dr. Wang.</p><br/><p>\u201cMinister Yan, leaving so soon? \u201d Lu Ren squeezed out a smile that looked uglier than a crying face and walked up to them. \u201cThe distance to the Red Planet is quite great and Miss Yao is so young, the journey might be tiring for her. How about resting for a bit more on our space station, I will contact the Union and send fleets to give you a farewell, what do you think?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need!\u201d Yan Xuan rejected straightaway. \u201cI\u2019ve contacted a friend from the Celestial species, he\u2019s already arrived.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Ren\u2019s face became even paler. It was as if the words \u201cnothing to live for\u201d were written all over him.</p><br/><p>Yan Xuan walked Yao Si to the center of the platform to a place like a landing site, then scanned her from the corner of his eyes. It was hard to say whether it was her pleading that had some effect or that he had some compassion, but he suddenly turned and said, \u201cOh by the way, about the thing earlier, due to my sweet baby\u2019s demand, I will no longer hold you accountable.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMinister Yan!\u201d Lu Ren was overjoyed. At that split second the entire person had burst into life, the smile on his face looking as if it was about to bloom like a flower. \u201cThank you Minister Yan for your understanding!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever\u2026\u201d Yan Xuan\u2019s tone suddenly changed, the corner of his mouth revealing an evil smile. \u201cYou have woken up a hibernating newborn like that, and as to whether her sire will seek trouble in the future, that has nothing to do with me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Ren stiffened, instantly recalling the possessiveness that was even scarier than the bloodlings\u2019 immorality. The flower that had just bloomed withered on the spot, his entire body solidifying into a stone, the type that was in the middle of cracking.</p><br/><p>Yao Si took a look at the slight gloating grin at the corner of Yan Xuan\u2019s eyes that could hardly be hidden, and her mouth twitched.</p><br/><p>This rascal was definitely doing it on purpose, right? Was it really necessary to stab them while you were about to leave?</p><br/><p>\u201cMy baby, look, here comes Uncle Li.\u201d Yan Xuan pointed towards the sky above them.</p><br/><p>Yao Si followed the direction where he was pointing, raised her head, and looked.</p><br/><p>\u2026 She suddenly froze.</p><br/><p>You gotta be kidding me!</p>\n</div>"}

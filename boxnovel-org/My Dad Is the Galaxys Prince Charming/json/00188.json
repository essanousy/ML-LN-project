Just a look at the sky full of red light rays was enough to attest for the guy\u2019s unimaginable power.</p><br/><p>She couldn\u2019t help feeling relief about destroying the portal so decisively. If more of these horrifying pure breeds were to come over, any number of galaxies would be destroyed.</p><br/><p>Even though he was strong, if both Mu Xuan and Lin Long were to join hands\u2026 Fine! There was still absolutely no chance of winning.</p><br/><p>\u25cb|\uffe3|_</p><br/><p>A bolt of red ray pierced Lin Long, sending him backward. Blood burst out from him endlessly.</p><br/><p>\u201cLin Long!\u201d Lian Yu screamed as she held onto his bloodstained body, her eyes tearing up. \u201cHow are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you alright?\u201d Yao Si asked with concern. In order to open up the portal, both Mu Xuan and Lin Long had already exhausted a large chunk of their abilities, so they had little chance to win.</p><br/><p>Besides, the grand prince was way too strong. He had managed to annihilate Lin Long\u2019s attack in a matter of seconds.</p><br/><p>Without the interference, the grand prince directed his attack at his original targets once more. The rays fell onto the protective barrier repeatedly, their intensity increasing with each blow. Gradually, cracks started to form.</p><br/><p>\u201cOur abilities are suppressed by the blood prison!\u201d Lin Long coughed out a mouthful of blood as he pointed toward the red glow above them. \u201cHe has absolute authority here, and there isn\u2019t any ability that can surpass his.\u201d</p><br/><p>F*ck, so that was the reason he built the prison. It explained why Lin Long\u2019s ability had been deal with so swiftly.</p><br/><p>What could she do then? What could she do?</p><br/><p>\u201cIf we can\u2019t use our abilities, we can use something else,\u201d Mu Xuan said in a low voice. He wiped the bloodstain on his lips before taking a step forward.</p><br/><p>What did that mean?</p><br/><p>\u201cIf we can\u2019t use our abilities\u2026\u201d Lin Long took a while to process his words, but when he did, his eyes went wide. \u201cAre you perhaps\u2026 You\u2019re crazy, look at the state you are in!\u201d He wanted to use his mental strength!</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you have any other suggestions?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Lin Long was silent.</p><br/><p>If their abilities were restricted, the only thing they could use was their mental strength. But mental strength was one\u2019s consciousness, so if\u2026</p><br/><p>Yao Si understood it as well, and her heart sank as her grip tightened around Mu Xuan\u2019s shirt. She lifted her head to glance up at him. \u201cMu Xuan\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, everything will be alright.\u201d Mu Xuan raised his hand to caress her head before adding, \u201cTrust me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d She tightened her fists before releasing them slowly.</p><br/><p>Mu Xuan moved her behind him, then a monumental strength came blasting from him. It penetrated the sky full of red light and headed straight for the grand prince.</p><br/><p>The ancestor was caught off guard and took a direct hit.</p><br/><p>Success!</p><br/><p>Yao Si \u2018s spirits lifted, but on closer inspection, she realized that the effects were fleeting. The grand prince shook himself slightly before straightening, his hollow dark eyes staring straight at them. \u201cYou intend to retaliate with mental strength? At your level\u2026 heh!\u201d</p><br/><p>A layer of golden aura formed around him, reflecting Mu Xuan\u2019s mental strength.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it useless?\u201d Yao Si\u2019s heart chilled.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s useful!\u201d Lin Long exclaimed. \u201cHis consciousness was damaged, or he\u2019d be attacking instead of putting up a protective barrier.\u201d He glanced up at Mu Xuan. \u201cNot bad at all, Mu. I only knew of your perverted ability, but I never expected that your mental strength would be so perverted as well. You really aren\u2019t human!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d <em>Is that how you compliment others?</em></p><br/><p>\u201cPush on, as long as you penetrate his consciousness, we will be able to win!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHeh! I\u2019ll kill all of you before you can do that!\u201d The grand prince smirked, but his face was a little pale. The next moment, a ferocious attack headed straight for them, clouding their vision red.</p><br/><p>Pssh\u2026</p><br/><p>The bloodstains on the corner of Mu Xuan\u2019s lips started to increase as more cracks showed up on their barrier.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck!\u201d Lin Long cursed in frustration. He stood up and gathered all the power within him to summon up another barrier. The next round of attacks smashed straight through the outer barrier onto Lin Long\u2019s barrier.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t of comparable strength, and the instant the red light rays made contact, he spat out countless mouthfuls of blood. It was a ghastly sight.</p><br/><p>\u201cLin Long!\u201d Lian Yu was at a loss. She was trembling all over as tears poured out from her eyes.</p><br/><p>Lin Long gritted his teeth and glanced over at Mu Xuan who was trying to penetrate the grand prince\u2019s mental defense. \u201cPush on, Mu! I\u2019m at my limit. You just need to penetrate that defense, just need to\u2014\u201d He spat out another mouthful of blood.</p><br/><p><em>Penetrate that defense, we just need to penetrate that layer of defense?</em></p><br/><p>Yao Si glanced at the bloodstained Lin Long before turning toward the pale Mu Xuan, and gritted her teeth. She was going to go all out as well! She then activated all her mental strength.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck, what are you doing?\u201d Lin Long exclaimed in shock, being the first to detect her actions. \u201cDon\u2019t be rash. You won\u2019t be able to help with your mental strength; you probably won\u2019t even be able to walk\u2026 Eh?\u201d</p><br/><p>Before he could finish his sentence, Yao Si\u2019s mental strength flashed toward the grand prince like a ray of light that hit his head in physical form.</p><br/><p>Er\u2026</p><br/><p>Was that mental strength? Wasn\u2019t that a f*cking tile?</p><br/><p>(\u2299_\u2299)</p><br/><p>Lin Long stilled, and a red light ray penetrated the barrier, heading straight for Mu Xuan who was shielding Yao Si. She felt a red light ray slide past her, and the next moment, a warm liquid dripped from Mu Xuan\u2019s side, splashing onto her face.</p><br/><p>\u201cMu\u2026 Xuan\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Her ears started to buzz. It was as though the entire world had went silent, leaving only Mu Xuan with his wound that was still bleeding profusely and his pupils that were a sea of red. Something exploded in Yao Si\u2019s mind, and a strong force gushed out from within her. Together with an impossible to suppress power, it rushed out toward her target.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck, how dare you hurt my man? I\u2019m going to kill you!\u201d</p><br/><p>A white glow exploded from within Yao Si, blanketing the entire galaxy. The sea of red disappeared instantly, and even the red prison surrounding them went away.</p><br/><p>The square tiles on the grandprince\u2019s head multiplied instantly. There were about a hundred of them, green on the underside and white on the top with a striking image in the middle. With a resounding explosion, the bloodling prince\u2019s mental strength shattered, but the mahjong tiles continued to stack. One circle <sup>1</sup> \u2026 another circle\u2026 and another circle\u2026</p><br/><p>Yao Si only had one thought\u2026 to kill!</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Lin Long.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Lian Yu.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Mu Xuan.</p></div>\n</div>"}

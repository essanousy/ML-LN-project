He raised his hand and opened his mouth to greet her. \u201cYour Hi\u2014\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si covered his mouth at lighting speed, dragging him into a deserted corner.</p><br/><p>\u201cShh, low profile, low profile!\u201d She swept a glance at him. \u201cNephew Gu, why are you here? Have your injuries healed?\u201d</p><br/><p>Gu Shucheng stilled, then replied dismissively, \u201cI predicted that Your Highness would be here, so I came over. My injuries fully healed a while back.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d Yao Si nodded, remembering how Disgusting Lu had mentioned that he was the only who could predict the future. \u201cIs your ability really to predict the future?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can only see some of it,\u201d he explained. \u201cAfter interacting with a specific person, I will be able to see some images, but it won\u2019t be complete and some of it might not even happen.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat does it mean?\u201d Didn\u2019t prediction mean that you\u2019ll know things beforehand? Or could you perhaps predict fake information as well?</p><br/><p>\u201cThe future isn\u2019t fixed,\u201d he answered patiently. \u201cI can only predict the current outcome, but once the person learns of it, he will obviously make a different choice, resulting in the prediction being different from reality.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh.\u201d <em>I understand, isn\u2019t it similar to the butterfly effect with you being the wings, but\u2026</em></p><br/><p>\u201cIf you can predict the future, why would you have been caught?\u201d This wasn\u2019t logical.</p><br/><p>He scratched his head in embarrassment. \u201cI was complacent. I had noticed them a month before I was caught. At that time, I foresaw the situation at the research base and realized the seriousness of it, but since I wasn\u2019t entirely sure, I deliberately fell into their trap to investigate further. In the end\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn the end you couldn\u2019t come back?\u201d Curiosity killed the cat, indeed. \u201cWhat if you died there?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have!\u201d He shook his head with assertion. \u201cIf I foresaw myself in danger, I naturally also saw myself escaping. This is due to Your Highness, you\u2019re indeed the queen of our race.\u201d</p><br/><p><em>Heh, stop praising me, I\u2019m not really that happy with this. Hehe, hahahhaha\u2026</em></p><br/><p>\u256e(\u256f\u25bd\u2570)\u256d</p><br/><p>\u201cWait a minute!\u201d She was suddenly reminded of something. \u201cDid Yao Qian instruct you to monitor me in the academy because of your ability\u2026.\u201d He would be able to foresee the possibility of her not making it in time for her meals and make sure that doesn\u2019t come to pass.</p><br/><p>Gu Shucheng froze, a shadow passing his face. He straightened his back and switched on his optical computer, then spoke up in forced seriousness, \u201cYour Highness, I came today mainly to report about the workload for this semester. Even though the semester is packed with events, you don\u2019t need to worry, I\u2019ll make sure to finish my report before your meal time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d <em>Ahem! Isn\u2019t your change of topic a bit too forced? Yao Qian definitely had that intention!</em></p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>Since Yao Si\u2019s previous optical computer had broken, she bought a new one but hadn\u2019t yet had the chance to add Nephew Gu into her contacts (mainly because she wasn\u2019t sure how it worked.) Hence, Nephew Gu had to personally add himself.</p><br/><p>Gu Shucheng sent her a large pile of documents, numerous finalized reports of the semester. Yao Si\u2019s heart sank. After struggling to enter the academy, the semester had flown past without even a full month of learning. The rest of the semester had been spent lazying about at home\u2026 This wasn\u2019t what she\u2019d had in mind when she decided to learn more about this Galaxy and expand her social circle.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, for your safety, from next semester, Your Highness will advance to the high school level,\u201d Nephew Gu said hesitantly.</p>\n</div>"}

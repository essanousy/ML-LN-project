A robot\u2019s locomotion skills were extremely poor and were prone to being damaged. If an individual with an ability were to get hurt or catch a cold, they would get better just by enduring it. Even if they managed to lose a limb, they could still continue fighting with their ability. On top of that, bloodlings possessed incredible self-healing properties.</p><br/><p>Even though robots could be repaired and were able to withstand heftier damage, they were after all a single entity. Even the most intelligent microchip would be deemed useless after extreme damage to its components. A small problem could collapse the entire system, like crashing into a wall and not being able to extract itself.</p><br/><p>During her attempt at operating it, even walking had showed up to be difficult, and Yao Si\u2019s passion extinguished instantly. She finally understood the academy\u2019s reasoning for using a stimulation; it was to prevent beginners from destroying too many robots.</p><br/><p>Robots were a controlled weapon in the Galaxy. The cost for each robot was high and not everyone was allowed to buy them. Even though there were plenty of robot construction companies on the galactic web, the application process was complicated and extensive. At the very least, students like her were prohibited from buying any robots.</p><br/><p>Yao Si glanced at the pile of tech she had destroyed. Just thinking about the costs brought her pain, and she silently decided to enter the simulation class. Even though her dad was rich, she couldn\u2019t just waste his money like that!</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>The First Academy had the perfect simulation system that was almost identical to the real experience. But due to the robot competition, there was a huge crowd waiting for its turn to practice. Since Yao Si was a bit late, there was no way she could get a turn to practice.</p><br/><p>Sadness filled her at that thought.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Highness, you can enter the galactic web for awareness training,\u201d Bai Yi suggested.</p><br/><p>\u201cAwareness training?\u201d Yao Si paused. <em>What\u2019s that?</em></p><br/><p>\u201cAwareness battle is the same as the robot stimulation. They\u2019re both linked to the galactic web, but the academy\u2019s stimulation can train your muscle memory while awareness training is more to hone your speed and accumulate experience in operating a robot.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGalactic web!\u201d Yao Si\u2019s eyes lit up. \u201cYou mean I\u2019m able to train whenever through my optical computer?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d Bai Yi replied nonchalantly. \u201cRobot awareness training is rather common, so there are many battles on the galactic web. Your Highness, haven\u2019t you seen it in the awareness plaza?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEr\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si\u2019s mouth twitched. She knew about the galactic web flat screen plaza and the awareness plaza. They were basically two access channels, one being the pop up screen that she used frequently and the other was the one she saw when her awareness entered the galactic web directly.</p><br/><p>It was similar to reality and could be seen as another world, just like the web game she had played previously. However, she had never entered using her awareness, ever since the horror of being trapped in the game for a whole month. Ever since then, she had feared that history would repeat itself\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cI rarely enter the awareness plaza.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be your guide then!\u201d Bai Yi tapped his chest with reassurance. \u201cYour Highness, don\u2019t worry. I\u2019m well versed in robot stimulation and its details. I even made it to the top hundred for the galactic competition.\u201d</p><br/><p>He tapped open his optical computer and sent her a party invitation with eagerness.</p><br/><p>Yao Si hesitated slightly. But since she had nothing to do and couldn\u2019t just head back to destroy more robots, she accepted the invitation. Almost instantly, the weightlessness she hadn\u2019t felt in a long time engulfed her. The next second, she arrived in a foreign location.</p><br/><p>She glanced around. It seemed like she was in a passageway, but instead of a road, there was a glowing ground under her feet, its rays scattering around her. The sides of the passageway weren\u2019t covered with familiar advertisements, but buttons and symbols Yao Si couldn\u2019t understand. There were plenty of people moving to and fro, much more than back on Eternal Brilliance.</p><br/><p>Yao Si started to study the crowd. Everyone was dressed differently and had varying physiques and looks, and even the mosaics on their faces were different\u2026</p><br/><p><em>Wait a minute! Why are their faces hidden? </em></p><br/><p>She took a closer look and saw that it wasn\u2019t just one person like that. More than 80% of the people in her surroundings had their faces covered by a mosaic.</p><br/><p><em>Er\u2026 is this a popular face feature in the galactic web?</em></p><br/><p>\u201cEh, Your Highness, why are you still in the default setting? Haven\u2019t you adjusted it yet?\u201d a familiar voice asked.</p><br/><p>Yao Si turned to see a boy with a head full of blond hair and a pair of antlers looking at her with alarm. He was dressed in clothes which kept changing colors and resembled a rainbow.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d <em>A neon lamp spirit?</em></p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m Bai Yi,\u201d he replied. He seemed to recall something as he brushed his hair back with a face full of pride. \u201cHow is it, Your Highness? Doesn\u2019t my pseudo image look good? My hairstyle, skin color, and exterior are all limited edition, capturing everyone\u2019s attention. You can\u2019t even get your hands on it anymore! How is it, are you impressed?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEr, yes\u2026\u201d <em>More like shocked, in a kind that stings my eyes. I never realized that other than your naggy nature, even your aesthetic judgment is flawed. </em></p><br/><p>\u201cYour Highness, the pseudo image can be modified with your thoughts.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si glanced down at herself and saw a snowy white ball of fluff. It had two short fluffy paws. <em>Am I a\u2026 bunny? Does everyone start like this?</em></p><br/><p>She silently thought of visual adjustment. As expected, an alternate sight appeared before her with her current bunny image and a row of options to modify her appearance, her race. There was even a clothing shop option.</p><br/><p>Was this\u2026 the galactic version of QQ fashion?</p><br/><p>Yao Si didn\u2019t bother picking things out and just clicked onto the random option. The next moment, the bunny took on a human form. It had average appearance, the kind that would blend into a crowd. Yao Si accepted the look with satisfaction.</p><br/><p>A confirmation of the change appeared before her [Galactic user 3838438, your new image has been saved successfully!]</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p><em>What\u2019s with this string of numbers? Am I being insulted again?</em></p><br/><p>(\u256f\u2035\u25a1\u2032)\u256f\ufe35\u253b\u2501\u253b</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Highness, the web name can be edited,\u201d Bai Yi reminded her.</p><br/><p>Yao Si felt her mouth twitch. She hurriedly clicked onto the contact surface to change her name.</p><br/><p>[Your web name has been changed to: Ancestor. Ancestor, we wish you a pleasant time!]</p><br/><p>Mmh, it looks much better!</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Highness, your nickname\u2026 is so fitting!\u201d Crazy Fan Bai Yi complimented instantly, his face filled with sincerity.</p><br/><p>She lifted her head to glance over his head, and fell silent.</p><br/><p>\u201cMmh, yours is fitting as well.\u201d Such a perfect use of sarcasm. \u201cOh right, where is the robot awareness training ground you mentioned?\u201d she mentioned the matter for which they had come.</p><br/><p>\u201cIts over at the armor grounds.\u201d Bai Yi brought her to the side with a row of cursors, clicking onto the two sword logos at the top.</p><br/><p>With a buzz, the brilliant lights and vibrant colors flew by, and the originally silent surroundings filling up with noise.</p><br/><p>The street disappeared, and they arrived at an ancient arena. There was an even larger crowd there, each person wearing an excited expressions as they cheered in the direction of battle.</p><br/><p>Yao Si turned toward the middle, and a bright screen caught her eye. Different matches flashed on the screen, with 1v1 battles taking up the majority of the space. There were also group matches with the maximum of five contestants.</p><br/><p>Bai Yi began his introductions. Awareness training was actually a virtual robot match that would allow participants to gain battle experience. There were three levels: advanced, intermediate, and beginner. Ever year, the Galaxy would host a battle in which the top ten contestants would win attractive prizes. The Top 100 thus were all experts in operating robots.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe champion seems to be Abyss Battle God. It\u2019s already his fifth championship,\u201d Bai Yi said as he pointed toward the screen. In a nonchalant tone, he added, \u201cI heard that he belongs to the Alliance army with a physique of Level SSS, so him retaining his title for that long isn\u2019t too surprising.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si nodded. If he was an expert pilot in real life, it wouldn\u2019t be difficult for him to win the seemingly game-like training.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is the one I admire the most.\u201d Bai Yi pointed to a black robot in the third place with excitement. \u201cBlack Lighting, he\u2019s the black horse this year. He\u2019s been hiding his identity, so no one knows who he is. I heard that his first match was against the tenth place, and that victory made him famous instantly. He managed to climb from the tenth position all the way to the third place in no time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s that good?\u201d Yao Si asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course!\u201d The excited youth nodded vigorously. \u201cHis win rate is 100% which is even higher than that of the the first place Abyss who has 95%! He\u2019s the first person who has managed to enter the ranking with a 100% win rate and can potentially beat Abyss to become the first champion with a perfect win rate.\u201d</p><br/><p>He\u2019s a long standing champion. That is indeed impressive.</p><br/><p>Yao Si studied the black robot carefully, but the surroundings were too dim so she wasn\u2019t able to make out his appearance. All she could see was a blob of black mess with a shining triangle at the side .</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d Yao Si asked while poking it with her finger.</p><br/><p>Bai Yi paled and shouted out \u201cYou can\u2019t touch that!\u201d, but it was too late. White light flooded Yao Si\u2019s vision, and the next second, she was transported to an arena.</p><br/><p>Right before her was the pure black robot that she hadn\u2019t been able to make out just seconds ago!</p><br/><p>[Black Lighting has accepted your challenge request!]</p><br/><p><em>F*ck!</em></p>\n</div>"}

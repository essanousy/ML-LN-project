He glared at Li Yue before scoffing grudgingly.</p><br/><p><em>Hey, hey, hey, did you forget about the flower mark on your back? It\u2019s wrong to be such a casanova. It\u2019s no wonder then that you couldn\u2019t sway Li Yue!</em></p><br/><p>\u201cIf it isn\u2019t the bloodlings. Li Yue, you sure found a good backing. Do you really think they\u2019ll scare me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStop spouting rubbish!\u201d Li Yue looked constipated. Having no intention to be associated with the person in front of them, he jumped straight to the point. \u201cI\u2019m not here for vengeance. I just wish to ask you about Nirvana.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNirvana?\u201d Xing Chong stilled, then an insidious smile spread across his face as though a thought had struck him. \u201cI was wondering why the bloodings would be here. Is it regarding the research base?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are indeed aware!\u201d Li Yue frowned. \u201cThat research base\u2026 Are you perhaps a part of it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWasn\u2019t that a request from you bloodlings?\u201d Xing Chong turned to them abruptly. \u201cMany years ago, some bloodlings requested Nirvana for the research base, so I marked a spot for them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you know what research was being conducted there?\u201d Yao Si asked, taking a step forward.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy would I know that!\u201d Xing Chong smoothed the hair on his forehead nonchalantly. \u201cIt was just a game planet after all. Besides, I couldn\u2019t be bothered since the management had already been passed on to a gaming company. Just a few days ago, I received news that the place had been destroyed. Are you here to criticize me?\u201d</p><br/><p>He swept another glance across them, adding hurriedly, \u201d Let me make things clear, I played no part in the destruction of the place. I had no intention of kicking you out\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho was the person that sought you out?\u201d Yao Si\u2019s heart clenched. Qu Ze had been right\u2014there were bloodlings in Euphoria.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know them?\u201d Xing Chong exclaimed, but the next second, he seemed to lose his interest. He shook his head and said, \u201cI don\u2019t know anything about that. I wanted to build closer bonds with you bloodlings, but after I loaned the area, you never showed up again.\u201d</p><br/><p>He wasn\u2019t even able to reclaim the area. \u201cThe person mentioned that they would only need the area temporarily. I wasn\u2019t informed of the details, so I inspected it once, but there was only a house built. Since it didn\u2019t affect the daily runnings of the game planet, I didn\u2019t bother with it. Even after the many years, no one came for it\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo one!\u201d Qu Ze froze, then advanced on him. \u201cYou mean there wasn\u2019t anyone in the research base?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Xing Chong nodded. \u201cI checked on it with my conscience many years ago, and there was indeed no one.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExplain yourself clearly.\u201d Yao Si could sense an inauspicious omen. If the place was uninhabited, then where did the zombies they met and the information about the virus come from? \u201cWhen did you realize that there wasn\u2019t anyone?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFrom the beginning!\u201d Xing Chong took a while more to ponder over before adding, \u201d About\u2026 twenty-thirty years ago?\u201d</p><br/><p>That long?! Yao Si fell into a daze as she turned to glance at Qu Ze who had the exact same dazed expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat can\u2019t be! The virus appeared recently. If the base had always been empty, why did they build it and lead us into believing that the virus had been produced there? What was their\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si suddenly stopped, a horrifying thought striking her. She turned toward the other two, before shouting in unison with Qu Ze.</p><br/><p>\u201cRed Army 4!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRed Army 4!\u201d</p><br/><p>F*ck!</p><br/><p>As expected, all of their optical computers lit up with an alarm. Three red warnings popped up at the same time. The Red Planet\u2026 was being ambushed!</p><br/><p>\u201cSisi!\u201d Mu Xuan\u2019s face sank, then he instructed her, \u201cStay here, don\u2019t move!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMu Xuan\u2026\u201d She was about to protest, but the very next moment, he disappeared into a space portal.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d <em>How are we going to go back if you\u2019re gone!</em></p><br/><p>The situation was finally clear. Ever since the start, Nirvana had been just a diversion. The doomsday virus wasn\u2019t produced there, but in a research base on Red Army 4. Moreover, the research had succeeded a long time ago, and had utilized the explosion to spread the virus throughout the Red Planet.</p><br/><p>The research base on Nirvana had been just a diversion to have Mu Xuan leave the Red Planet.</p><br/><p>The warning on the optical planet grew increasingly more agitated, sending Yao Si into a frenzy as she worried about the situation and Mu Xuan who had gone back by himself.</p><br/><p>\u201cQu Ze, aren\u2019t you from the space series? Hurry, let\u2019s go back.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh\u2026\u201d Qu Ze stiffened. \u201cYour Highness, not everyone with space ability is able to go through so many Galaxies! Besides\u2026\u201d He sighed. \u201cHis Majesty instructed you to stay here precisely because he didn\u2019t want you near danger.\u201d The doomsday virus was there after all\u2026</p><br/><p>Yao Si was obviously aware of Mu Xuan\u2019s intentions, but she couldn\u2019t help worrying about him. Moreover, Euphoria had to have been plotting it for a long time.</p><br/><p>She couldn\u2019t stop the unfathomable anxiety rising in her heart at the thought of it.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs there any way to monitor the situation on the Red Planet?\u201d If they couldn\u2019t go back, they should at least be able to get updates on the situation.</p><br/><p>Qu Ze took a moment before lifting his head toward Little Ball who was floating above them. \u201cLittle Ball, hack into the Red Planet\u2019s security system and show the video feed. Hurry!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Ball understands!\u201d The metal ball jumped, a series of codes flashing over its body. In less than half a minute, a video popped up, surrounding them.</p><br/><p>There were millions of videos from all of the Red Planet. Once the trio was able to process them, a chill ran down through them.</p><br/><p>Chaos!</p><br/><p>The entire Red Planet was in chaos. Loud noises echoed in every corner, aircraft filled up every inch of the sky, trapping the entire planet in a ring. Explosions kept going off, and on closer inspection, Yao Si could recognize the logo on the aircraft!</p><br/><p>It was\u2026 the army of the Alliance!</p><br/><p>It was sort of expected though\u2026 If Euphoria had been able to sway even the bloodlings, then it could definitely sway the Alliance\u2019s army. But why were there so few bloodlings on the streets?</p><br/><p>\u201cHurry, look here!\u201d Qu Ze suddenly pointed toward a screen. \u201cWho are they?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si turned and saw the screen showing a location near a fallen meteorite. A large crowd had congregated there. Unlike the bloodlings who were either attacking or hiding, the crowd near the meteorite seemed to be called by it. They approached as if in a daze.</p><br/><p>That\u2026 What was going on there?</p><br/><p>\u201cSomeone\u2019s controlling their conscience!\u201d Qu Ze exclaimed in disbelief. \u201cOne of them has a mental ability stronger than a bloodling\u2019s mental strength, but there are so many of them\u2026 How can it be?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si\u2019s heart clenched. The meteorites held the doomsday virus. If they were to go any closer and any one of them got infected\u2026</p><br/><p>With one, there would be lots more!</p><br/><p>As the crowd neared the meteorite, some of the bloodlings stretched their arms out, itching to touch the rocks.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, the video feed shook as a force swept through the area, ad the crowd that was in a trance suddenly awakened. Some of the bloodlings lifted their heads in slight confusion as they glanced at the person in midair.</p><br/><p>Yao Si heaved a sigh of relief. Mu Xuan had finally arrived!</p><br/><p>\u201cLeave the meteorite area!\u201d he instructed coldly. At his words, the bloodlings finally regained their senses and started to retaliate.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, I guess it\u2019s too late.\u201d A low voice came from the sky, and a black figure suddenly appeared near Mu Xuan. \u201cLong time no see, old friend.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mu Xuan frowned. It was an expression that wasn\u2019t like his usual coldness. It was a solemness and slight shock Yao Si had never seen on his face.</p><br/><p>Who was it? Who could alarm him so much?</p><br/><p>She leaned forward, trying to take a closer look. The person was dressed entirely in black and was floating just like Mu Xuan. But somehow, she wasn\u2019t able to see his appearance. Even though the face was clear, it somehow got blurred in her mind.</p><br/><p>Was that because of mental strength?</p><br/><p>\u201cQu Ze, this person\u2026\u201d Just as she was about to ask Qu Ze, she found that there was something amiss about him. His pupils were dilated as he stared at the screen in a daze.</p><br/><p>\u201cQu Ze?\u201d Yao Si\u2019s heart sank as she grabbed onto him, but he still remained in a daze. It wasn\u2019t just him, both Li Yue and Xing Chong who were still bickering a second ago were also in the same state.</p><br/><p>What happened?</p><br/><p>\u201cQu Ze, Qu Ze!\u201d Yao Si started to panic, covering him with her mental strength.</p><br/><p>The three stayed frozen for a moment more, then snapped back to their senses and turned toward her. \u201cYour\u2026 Highness?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qu Ze took two frantic breaths before speaking in a shaking voice, \u201cIt\u2019s the mental strength, Your Highness. That person\u2026 I can feel a mental strength comparable to that of His Majesty from him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p><em>How can that be? Who exactly is he?</em></p></div>\n</div>"}

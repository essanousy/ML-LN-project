His brows slammed together when he remarked irritably, \u201cF*ck, my computer can\u2019t detect what it is?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow about we head for another checkpoint?\u201d Yao Si suggested. There was sufficient time after all.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Lin Long had a \u2018are you looking down on me\u2019 expression. \u201cI don\u2019t believe a small force like this will be able to stop me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d Yao Si\u2019s heart sank with a feeling of facing an inauspicious omen.</p><br/><p>\u201cHeh! If i can\u2019t go in, I\u2019ll just destroy it!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, don\u2019t be rash.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Long disregarded her warning and raised his hand. The next second, ghastly flames enveloped the sky, blanketing the special circle of forces and sending the entire horizon into a sea of red flames.</p><br/><p>Yao Si and her comrades were left speechless!</p><br/><p>Turning to violence upon disagreement was indeed a tradition of bloodlings.</p><br/><p>\u25cb|\uffe3|_</p><br/><p>The temperature soared, and even the air was on the verge of bursting into flames as fiery red fire covered their vision. Yao Si stumbled backwards unconsciously.</p><br/><p>Just then, the checkpoint came into sight. It was on an empty patch with a semicircle of a protective barrier. Due to the high temperature, the checkpoint seemed to have faint signs of melting.</p><br/><p>Yao Si was struck speechless. Even if the force could be eradicated, the checkpoint would most probably be destroyed as well. Was Lin Long trying to help or cause trouble?</p><br/><p>Just as she was about to stop him, a white ray came bursting from the force field, and all the flames disappeared almost instantly as though they had been absorbed. The originally transparent force field turned red instantly.</p><br/><p>It came alive then, producing thumping sounds, like\u2026 a countdown!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with this thing? It actually ate up my fire! Then let\u2019s see how much of it you can swallow!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si\u2019s heart shook. \u201cNo!\u201d</p><br/><p>It was too late, however, since Lin Long had already raised his hand to summon a fire dragon which bolted straight toward the force field. With a slight rustling, almost as though the dragon had entered water, it was engulfed. The force field started to tremble with a faint shadow swimming inside, but the next moment, a whirlpool of fireballs came swarming toward them like rain droplets.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck!\u201d This isn\u2019t a force field, but f*king catapult! \u201cRun!\u201d Yao Si shouted out as she turned around, planning to run with Bai Yi and Li Zheng.</p><br/><p>Lin Long wasn\u2019t an pro, but a troublemaker!</p><br/><p>The moment she turned, a wave of heat came gushing over. A few steps away from them, a massive fire ball had appeared. There seemed to be something leaking out from its core.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Highness!\u201d Bai Yi exclaimed. He wanted to grab hold of her, but it was too late.</p><br/><p>The fire dragon that had disappeared suddenly appeared in front of them, speeding straight for Yao Si. F*ck, they had totally forgotten that the force field could teleport everything that went in out of the place!</p><br/><p>Yao Si started to panic. Almost instinctively, she directed all the welling force within her at the fire dragon. She assumed a water ability would appear, but her entire being was shock. It felt as though something was tugging at her, then, together with the force within her, it exploded in all directions.</p><br/><p>Her vision started to blur, and the massive fire dragon disappeared, morphing into\u2026 a gigantic fireball!</p><br/><p><em>F*ck!</em></p><br/><p>She only had time to secure her head before the fire ball smashed against her. With a series of rustling noises, thick burning scent choked up her senses. With a buzz in her mind, her vision darkened and she passed out.</p><br/><p>She could vaguely hear Bai Yi and Li Zheng\u2019s exclamations.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Highness!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBoss!\u201d</p><br/><p>Long Ergou, what did he do this time?!</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>When Yao Si regained her consciousness, she could hear faint murmurs, but the tone and voice were familiar.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? How could I know what\u2019s wrong? F*ck, I didn\u2019t want this to happen, alright? Who did I offend?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou should be asking her that. Did you think I came willingly?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHer Highness became like this because of your fire dragon.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI summoned it because\u2026 Wait a minute! What are you trying to do? Hey, Mu, this has nothing to do with me. Don\u2019t you dare turn aggressive! F*ck, do you think I\u2019m afraid of you?!\u201d</p><br/><p>A series of rustling and shuffling sounds proceeded.</p><br/><p>Were they\u2026 fighting?</p><br/><p>\u201cF*cK, you maniac. Great! Beat\u2026 come and beat me! Since the situation is already such, you can just go ahead and lay your hands on me. Anyway, if this body is injured, won\u2019t you be the one in pain?\u201d</p><br/><p>Silence suddenly fell.</p><br/><p>Yao Si\u2019s consciousness started to waver, and she had to exert immense strength to force her eyes open.</p><br/><p>The first thing she noticed was the splitting headache; it felt as if there was something churning in her brain. The pain was so unbearable, she inhaled sharply.</p><br/><p>\u201cSisi!\u201d A familiar face appeared before her, its owner, helping her up into a sitting position. \u201cHow are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMu Xuan?\u201d Was she back in the space station? What exactly had happened? She turned back toward Mu Xuan, but it seemed like he was sitting a little farther away than usually. \u201cWhat happened? Your brawling was the first thing I heard when I woke up.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mu Xuan\u2019s hand stiffened, and his worried expression twitched slightly before, turning a little odd. He looked as though he had been constipated for a few months.</p><br/><p>What was wrong? Did she contract some sort of terminal illness? That couldn\u2019t be\u2026 Wasn\u2019t she a bloodling?</p><br/><p>\u201cYou-your Highness?\u201d Bai Yi and Li Zheng asked in unison, their expressions even more animated than that of Mu Xuan. \u201cAre you\u2026 alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI just have a little headache!\u201d Yao Si caressed her throbbing head. \u201cWhat exactly happened to me just now? Why are we back? Are you guys alright? Oh right, where\u2019s Lin Long?\u201d</p><br/><p>The three of them paled, turning to glance at each other. After half a second, Mu Xuan turned to comfort her abruptly.</p><br/><p>\u201cSisi, don\u2019t be agitated!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAgitated?\u201d She stilled.</p><br/><p>The three of them suddenly inched apart, and Yao Si realized that there was someone behind them that seemed to be a woman. She had long hair and was dressed in black clothes that looked like the ones she had been wearing. She wasn\u2019t tall and was flat chested which was just like her, and even her face was exactly\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe looks just like me!\u201d Yao Si pointed toward her instinctively, but in her peripheral vision, she caught sight of a muscular arm. \u201cEh? What\u2019s wrong with my arm? When did it become so thick?\u201d</p><br/><p>She glanced down instinctively and realized that it wasn\u2019t just her arm. Her whole body seemed to have grown by a few sizes. Her chest muscles were even higher than her two lumps before, and she seemed almost\u2026 masculine?</p><br/><p><em>F*ck!</em></p><br/><p>(\u2299_\u2299)</p><br/><p>Suddenly, she became aware of the situation. She jumped off the bed and bolted upright.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou-you-you\u2026 you are me?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, you are the old man right now! \u201cThe next second, she saw herself take two steps toward her and speak in a familiar voice. \u201cOur bodies swapped!\u201d</p><br/><p>Swapped bodies?</p><br/><p>Didn\u2019t that mean that she had become Lin Long?!</p><br/><p>What the f*ck?</p><br/><p>(\u256f\u2035\u25a1\u2032)\u256f\ufe35\u253b\u2501\u253b</p><br/><p><em>No, no, no, this can\u2019t be. This is the galactic generation, a scientific society, so how could such a magical thing happen?! This must be a hallucination; I couldn\u2019t have become a man!</em></p><br/><p>Yao Si gritted her teeth. What she had to do first was to verify her gender.</p><br/><p>Hence, she lowered her head and grabbed onto her pants, pulling it open!</p><br/><p>\u201cStop!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStop!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStop!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStop!\u201d</p><br/><p>Four screams pierced the air in unison, and four hands from different sides rushed to her, all of them pressing onto her hands which were about to unzip the pants\u2026</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p></div>\n</div>"}

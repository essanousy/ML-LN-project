There were both men and women, all dressed in white with buns secured tightly at the back of their heads, holding swords that were similar to the one Zan Zichen had used. In unison, they pointed over at them.</p><br/><p>\u201cZan Zichen!\u201d The man at the front looked over in shock. The moment he spoke, a ruckus erupted behind him.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s really\u2026 really him! He\u2019s alive!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow is that possible? No one has ever left the demonic realm alive.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe managed to survive his exile in the demonic realm, he must really be a spy from the demonic race.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI guess Elder was right, he is indeed part of the demonic race.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe is indeed the thief of the combat transformation pill!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cZan Zichen!\u201d The man that spoke earlier took a large step forward. His grip on the sword tightened evidently when he did so, and murderous intent flashed on his face. \u201cYou traitor, how dare you come back?\u201d</p><br/><p>Traitor? Yao Si stilled, turning back to glance at Zan Zichen. <em>Was that why he wanted to leave so anxiously?</em></p><br/><p>He stepped forward with nervousness. \u201cJunior Geng, I didn\u2019t do it\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShut up!\u201d the man interrupted his excuse. \u201cYou were expelled a long time ago. You\u2019re no longer a disciple of Shi Fang, so don\u2019t think to call me junior! How did you escape from the demonic realm?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zan Zichen\u2019s hands tightened into fists, a memory seemingly flashing in his mind. He suppressed his trembling self, then shouted back in his defence, \u201cIt really wasn\u2019t done by me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to continue with the lie!\u201d Junior Geng humphed, the muderous glint in his eyes growing increasingly more prominent. \u201cThe sect leader personally witnessed it and testified against your act, how can it be wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior Yu is his son, they would definitely\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShut up! You\u2019re remorseless and stubborn, how can you malign our leader!\u201d</p><br/><p><em>Oh, there seems to be a story here!</em></p><br/><p>Junior Geng grew increasingly more furious, and even the disciples at the back glared over with anger. \u201cToday, I\u2019ll be the one to clean the sect.\u201d</p><br/><p>He shifted his hand, and four-five small transparent swords appeared around him.</p><br/><p><em>Is this\u2026 violence from just a minor dispute?</em></p><br/><p>\u201cWait, you\u2026\u201d <em>What can\u2019t be solved through communication? </em> Just as Yao Si was about to stop them, the small swords headed straight for her. <em>F*ck! He is serious? </em></p><br/><p>Zan Zichen waved his sword forcefully, and with a few sharp clangs, the little swords shattered.</p><br/><p>\u201cJunior Geng, I\u2019ve been enduring because of the feelings we have as disciples from the same sect, but it isn\u2019t because I can\u2019t defeat you!\u201d Zan Zichen said, rising his sword in anger.</p><br/><p>\u201cHeh! You, the hopeless fifth spiritual root?\u201d He clearly despised Zan Zichen. \u201cDon\u2019t be arrogant just because you managed to escape the demonic realm. Do you really think you can leave freely today?\u201d He smirked and turned to look at Yao Si. \u201cWho is that behind you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI am\u2014\u201d</p><br/><p>Zan Zichen froze, taking a step in front of her to block the sight of those from the sect. \u201cJunior Geng, there isn\u2019t a need to pull outsiders into our business. This senior is here at Shi Fang for a pressing matter, it has nothing to do with me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf there wasn\u2019t anything, would you have gotten so nervous?\u201d He smirked, glancing over at Yao Si with a hint of mockery. \u201cLook at her strange outfit, she must have brought you out of the demonic realm! Heh, to be able to escape that realm, she must be a demoness!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEr\u2026\u201d How did she get implicated? How was she strange? This outfit was specifically chosen by Daddy Mu!</p><br/><p>\u201cShut up!\u201d Zan Zichen howled, his face red with fury, seemingly more infuriated than when they had scolded him, \u201cSenior is of high virtue and prestige, how can you slander her like that!\u201d</p>\n</div>"}

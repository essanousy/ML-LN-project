There seems to be a misunderstanding and I wish to seek clarification from the sect.\u201d Yao Si then turned to glance at Zan Zichen.</p><br/><p>He took a step forward, greeting the sect leader and various elders. \u201cGrand Elders, Master, the combat transformation pill wasn\u2019t stolen by me. That day when I was at the Hidden Pill Pavilion, I saw Elder Senior eating the pill, that\u2019s how we got into a conflict. I never\u2014\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShut up!\u201d Before Zan Zichen could finish his sentence, he was interrupted by an infuriated sect leader. \u201cYou\u2019re full of rubbish, I personally witnessed what happened! You injured Yao Er and stole the pill, how dare you try to lie about the truth.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Yu, you should be clear whether I stole the pill or someone had used it!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow audacious, there is both eye witnesses and hard evidence, don\u2019t you dare deny it.\u201d The sect leader swung his sleeve violently, his anger concealing his embarrassment. He turned to the service crew person. \u201cGrand Elder, for such an audacious disciple, I\u2019ll personally deal with him elsewhere to not disrupt you.\u201d</p><br/><p>He headed forward anxiously, intending to drag Zan Zichen elsewhere. His anxiousness seemed suspicious, as though he was afraid the matter would drag on.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait a minute.\u201d Yao Si stood in front of Zan Zichen, blocking him. \u201cShouldn\u2019t we clarify the matter before you punish him?\u201d</p><br/><p>The sect leader frowned, glancing at her with obvious displeasure. \u201cThis is the business of Shi Fang Sect, so I would prefer if you didn\u2019t interfere.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy? Is the business of Shi Fang sect so shameful?\u201d she retorted.</p><br/><p>He froze, his face turning green. Taking a deep breath to calm down, he continued, \u201cDear Miss, you must not know, there are signs that this disciple is turning demonic. Previously, he stole the sect\u2019s precious combat transformation pill, for which he was banished to the demonic realm, and now he must have used some trick to escape that place. In order to ensure he doesn\u2019t bring more harm, it would be\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cI brought him out!\u201d Yao Si replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat!\u201d The sect leader\u2019s face paled. \u201cHow could you escape the demonic realm, are you perhaps\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Yu.\u201d Before he could finish his sentence, the service crew elderly spoke with a hint of warning. \u201cMind your words!\u201d</p><br/><p><em>How dare you offend a valuable customer? </em></p><br/><p>The sect leader swallowed the rest of his sentence.</p><br/><p>\u201cLets not discuss whether he is demonic or not. You mentioned that he stole the pill, but other than you, is there anyone else who saw it. Just your words should not be used as evidence, for I can also just say that you were the one who stole it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYao Er saw it too,\u201d Sect Leader Yu added anxiously. \u201cBesides, he was harmed by Zan Zichen, those wounds are the physical evidence.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYao Er? What\u2019s the relationship between the two of you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s my son.\u201d</p><br/><p>Now she knew, they were father and son. There was definitely something fishy going on.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you know that family\u2019s testimonials cannot be used as evidence?\u201d They were obviously in cahoots. \u201cIt isn\u2019t impossible that you guys were speaking wrongly about him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRubbish! I\u2019m the sect leader, how could I do such a thing!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t even know you well, how could I know.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFor this matter, no amount of explaining would be sufficient. We can\u2019t just deal with it this way, besides, even if what you said was true, he was already punished. After struggling to escape the demonic realm, is there a need to punish him again?\u201d Even death sentences could be pardoned, why not this then. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we just forget the matter?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGrand Elder?\u201d She directed her question to someone else of authority.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh?!\u201d <em>What\u2019s that got to do with me? </em></p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEr\u2026\u201d The service crew person froze. He was here just to help the newbies, so why did he have to meet such a meddlesome customer! But the customer is always right, so he was about to nod in agreement. However, before he could do that, another person spoke up.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet me say a few words.\u201d This was one of the other people beside the service crew member. \u201cAbout this matter, I feel that\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si\u2019s heart sank. <em>Will he side with the sect leader? </em></p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re absolutely right!\u201d the person stated resolutely.</p><br/><p><em>Ah?!</em></p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, your words now made so much sense.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReasonable indeed! He should be released.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHurry! Didn\u2019t you hear this senior telling you to release him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReasonable, indeed! I\u2019m thoroughly convinced by this senior!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cClap for the senior\u2019s words!\u201d</p><br/><p><em>Clap! Clap!</em></p><br/><p>A clapping resonated awkwardly within the hall and\u2026 it wasn\u2019t stopping!</p><br/><p>The service crew member, Sect Leader Yu, Zan Zichen, all the disciples, and Yao Si stared at them speechlessly.</p><br/><p>Where did these four dummies come from?</p>\n</div>"}

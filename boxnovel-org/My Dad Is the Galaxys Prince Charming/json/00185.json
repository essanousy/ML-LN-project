Hadn\u2019t he already found his contractor? Why did he still want to go back? Was there something wrong with his relationship?</p><br/><p>Mu Xuan shared a glance with her before opening a space portal to the reconstructed Blue Planet. It was only when they caught sight of both Lian Yu and Lin Long standing together that they heaved a sigh of relief. It seemed that they weren\u2019t having a conflict after all!</p><br/><p>\u201cSisi!\u201d Lian Yu was the first to notice their presence, and out of habit, she pounced onto Yao Si.</p><br/><p>The faces of the two men darkened instantly. Lin Long hurriedly pulled Lian Yu aside while Mu Xuan did the same with Yao Si.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you doing? Let go of me!\u201d Lian Yu turned to glare at Lin Long.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Yu.\u201d Lin Long sighed. He didn\u2019t retort as was normal to him, but instead pleaded with her in a placating tone. \u201cYou promised me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did I promise?\u201d Lian Yu rolled her eyes. \u201cThe agreement was temporary. Don\u2019t you understand what temporary mean? Let go of me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Long released her cautiously, tenderness oozing from his every move. His whole being was shrouded with the stench of love. Yao Si could no longer associate him with the potty-mouthed individual in her memory.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou guys?\u201d Yao Si glanced between them, which was when she noticed a familiar blood deed mark on Lian Yu\u2019s forehead. Hey, wasn\u2019t he a little quick? It didn\u2019t take long for him to catch her, so why was he still going back?</p><br/><p>\u201cSisi, why don\u2019t you come along with us?\u201d Lian Yu extended both arms in an attempt to beg for a hug.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome along?\u201d Yao Si exclaimed. \u201cWhere are you going?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course she\u2019s going home with me.\u201d Lin Long lifted his head in pride as his arms circled around her possessively, which was then swatted away by her paws.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre pure breeds required to report back once they found their contractors?\u201d Yao Si asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not necessary.\u201d He glanced over at Lian Yu with affection pouring from his eyes. \u201cGenerally, we follow our contractor.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen?\u201d Why was he going back?</p><br/><p>\u201cMy situation is a little unique,\u201d he explained. \u201cI wasn\u2019t in this universe just to find my contractor, but also on a mission. Now that I have Xiao Yu\u201d\u2014his eyes curved up\u2014\u201dI won\u2019t be able to continue with my mission and have to head back to tie up some loose ends.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re bringing Lian Yu to another universe?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course!\u201d He nodded firmly. \u201cIt took me so much effort to find her, so naturally I won\u2019t be able to bear leaving her even for a second.\u201d He lowered his head and glance down at her.</p><br/><p>It seemed as though she was all that he could see. It sent goosebumps all over Yao Si.</p><br/><p>As expected of someone who had been single for such a long time, he was indeed insufferable! Lian Yu, on the contrary, remained nonchalant as though accustomed to his actions.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you guys still coming back?\u201d Yao Si asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cSisi\u2026\u201d Lian Yu\u2019s eyes lit up instantly, and she looked at her with excitement. \u201cI knew you wouldn\u2019t be able to bear for me to leave. I won\u2019t be able to bear it as well; my heart will always be here with you. If you were to stop me, I wouldn\u2019t go.\u201d</p><br/><p>The corners of Yao Si\u2019s lips twitched. \u201cYou can go then!\u201d <em>That incorrigible ability!</em></p><br/><p>\u201cSisi\u2026\u201d Lian Yu\u2019s eyes dimmed. With a hurt expression, she was about to say something more, but Lin Long cut in impatiently.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe will be back soon. Mu!\u201d He lifted his head to glare furiously at Mu Xuan. \u201cYou guys promised that you would help me open a portal back to my original universe, so now\u2019s the time for you to fulfill your promise.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mu Xuan frowned, but without another word, he took a step forward. \u201cWhat do I have to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou just have to use all of your power to open the biggest space portal you can. I\u2019ll deal with the rest,\u201d Lin Long explained.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe biggest space portal?\u201d Yao Si asked. \u201cHow big is that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Long raised his finger toward the Blue Planet. \u201cAbout the size of it.\u201d</p><br/><p><em>F*ck! Isn\u2019t that too big? Are you planning on bringing the entire planet back?! </em></p><br/><p>\u201cHurry, hurry!\u201d He rushed them impatiently. \u201cI\u2019ve already contacted my race after reconstructing the Blue Planet and promised to return at this time, so don\u2019t cause me to be late.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMu Xuan?\u201d Yao Si asked with worry. After all, opening a space portal of such a scale would definitely pose some difficulty.</p><br/><p>Mu Xuan caressed her head to reassure her before stepping forward with his hands raised. Shortly after, a black hole appeared. It enlarged rapidly, and soon, it filled the void above the Blue Planet.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck, that was fast! You are indeed a monster,\u201d Lin Long muttered with envy. He tapped open his optical computer and almost instantly several screens appeared. He clickened endlessly while shouting, \u201cHold on for a while with the portal about this size.\u201d</p><br/><p>After ten minutes, he clicked something which ignited a green glow near the Blue Planet before the portal Mu Xuan had opened up. With a loud eruption, the green glow spread across the opening like an external layer, and seconds later, the entire portal was covered.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s done!\u201d Lin Long exclaimed with joy.</p><br/><p>The next moment, the portal about the size of the Blue Planet started to shrink rapidly. The core which was black with a green middle started to merge into a single white color.</p><br/><p>Mu Xuan who was maintaining the portal with ease started to frown as beads of perspiration started to form along his forehead.</p><br/><p>\u201cMu Xuan!\u201d Yao Si who had been focusing on him the entire time was the first to detect his struggle. Her heart clenched with worry. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, he won\u2019t die!\u201d Lin Long rolled his eyes. \u201cDo you think it\u2019d be easy to create a portal between two universes? Back then, both me and the old man used a great amount of power just to come over. Since he\u2019s doing it alone right now, it\u2019s definitely exhausting. But after recuperating for a few days, he\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d Mu Xuan turned over to reassure Yao Si.</p><br/><p>Even though she was trusted him, she could not help turning to glare at the culprit. \u201cDidn\u2019t you open the portal with the old man? Why aren\u2019t you doing anything this time, forcing my Mu Xuan to tackle it alone?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck, who\u2019s going to operate the portal switching device if both of us were to activate our abilities?\u201d Lin Long glared at her, pointing to the shrinking portal. \u201cCan you see that green glow? Its the power I compressed into the portal switching device. The state of my ability isn\u2019t much better than that of Mu Xuan. Besides, if you guys hadn\u2019t killed my king beast, we wouldn\u2019t be suffering so much right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Alright, Yao Si didn\u2019t have a comeback for that.</p><br/><p>\u256e(\u256f\ufe4f\u2570\uff09\u256d</p><br/><p>As the portal continued to shrink, its glow intensified. After half an hour, the blinding light started to dim, and a about five to six meters tall coalesced. Its interior was completely white.</p><br/><p>Was that the portal to the other universe?!</p></div>\n</div>"}

Just as Mu Xuan had said, a huge crowd had gathered suddenly, while the remaining ships stayed stationary. The person nearest to her had a fire ability, and he was summoning bursts of flame towards the caterpillar. There was already a visible burnt area on the bug\u2019s skin.</p><br/><p>The moment Yao Si steadied herself, she felt a familiar surge of energy, and a burst of joy engulfed her as she directed the energy towards the massive caterpillar. Right away, there was a loud sizzling sound\u2026</p><br/><p>The flame of the warrior beside her was extinguished!</p><br/><p>-_-|||</p><br/><p>\u201cEr\u2026 It\u2019s a mistake.\u201d She hadn\u2019t expected her ability to be from the water series, and she had even accidentally directed it at the other person.</p><br/><p>He glared at her, taking two steps to the side as he continued to burn the bug with his flame.</p><br/><p>Yao Si calmed down. She felt the surge of the energy once more, then took a deep breath, carefully directing the energy.</p><br/><p>The next moment, there was a sizzling sound\u2026</p><br/><p>The fire was extinguished again.</p><br/><p>\u25cb|\uffe3|_</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you have something against my flame?\u201d the warrior asked swiftly, his gaze more ferocious than before.</p><br/><p>\u201cApologies, apologies,\u201d Yao Si apologized continuously.</p><br/><p>She was totally confused now. Even though she hadn\u2019t aimed in the man\u2019s direction, the water had still come out on its own!</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph!\u201d The warrior rolled his eyes, dismissing her. He took a few steps to the side once more, and for the third time summoned his flame.</p><br/><p>The next moment\u2026 sizzling\u2026 The fire was extinguished again!</p><br/><p>He took a few more steps to the side for the fourth time.</p><br/><p>Sizzling\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si continued to look confused. Even though she had no intention of extinguishing his flame, somehow, whenever she tried to summon the energy within her, the water would direct itself towards the flame, gushing over to extinguish it. The force was so overwhelming she wasn\u2019t able to suppress it.</p><br/><p>The warrior\u2019s veins were already showing. Disregarding the caterpillar, he flew straight in her direction.</p><br/><p>\u201cSis, do you bear a grudge against me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 No.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen why do you keep extinguishing my flame? What\u2019s so great about the water ability? Honestly speaking, are you friends with the beast?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 I\u2019m sorry!\u201d It really wasn\u2019t on purpose, she couldn\u2019t control it\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cHey sis,\u201d he tried to reason with her, \u201cYou\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Before he could finish his sentence, the caterpillar howled out all of a sudden. Lifting its head, it spat out a green substance in the man\u2019s direction.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWatch out!\u201d Almost instinctively, Yao Si activated her ability, and a gigantic wave formed, heading straight towards the warrior, washing the green substance away\u2026 <em>Mmhh, the warrior was washed away too!</em></p><br/><p>\u25cb|\uffe3|_</p><br/><p>The warrior\u2019s heart sank as he was swept about thirty meters away. His ability had already disappeared, even the small flame that had been floating on his palm was gone now.</p><br/><p><em>Er\u2026 This warrior, can we negotiate first, can you not hit my face?</em></p><br/><p><em>Awhoo!</em></p><br/><p>Without allowing her time to process, the massive caterpillar howled once more. It widened its mouth to spit out more green substance than before, and this time, it was directed at her.</p><br/><p><em>F*ck!</em></p><br/><p>Yao Si\u2019s heart sank. She wanted to summon her ability once more, but her body felt empty. Was karma striking now? At the most critical moment, her ability just abandoned her?</p><br/><p>The disgusting green substance was heading straight for her.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, a translucent barrier enclosed her, blocking the substance\u2019s path. The next moment Yao Si heard a familiar voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>She froze, then shook her head, almost forgetting about the jacket she had brought along.</p><br/><p>Yao Si calmed down, but just as she did, a loud drop sounded, like a drop of water hitting the ground. The celestial enchantment that trapped the caterpillar cracked slightly.</p><br/><p>The massive caterpillar who had been struggling just a moment ago shook, and like a TV screen with bad reception, it flickered slightly before disappearing entirely.</p><br/><p><em>Ah! What is this situation? It ran?</em></p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t just Yao Si who shocked either, everyone present was in a daze as well. The space in front of them was empty, as though the galactic beast never been there.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>Mu Xuan frowned, his face sinking. \u201cThis\u2026 was not an ordinary galactic beast.\u201d</p><br/><p>What did he mean? Just as she was about to ask him, the soaking wet brother came flying back.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, sis\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I couldn\u2019t control my ability just now!\u201d Yao Si shouted out her apology. She had never expected to wash him away, but at such a critical moment, she had released all of her one use ability.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you think an apology is enough?\u201d The man flicked his drenched sleeves. \u201cHey little lady, did I owe you in my previous life?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow about\u2026 I pay you back?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cForget it, since you\u2019re still new, I\u2019ll leave it at this!\u201d He scoffed, then took a good look at Yao Si and added abruptly, \u201cHow much are you going to compensate me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d <em>Weren\u2019t you going to forget it?</em></p><br/><p>Yao Si didn\u2019t have a grasp on the value of the galactic currency, so she opened her optical computer and typed a string of numbers.</p><br/><p>He lowered his head, his eyes focusing hard, and then seem satisfied. The anger instantly dissipated from his face. \u201cHahaha, forget it, forget it, fate brought us together, let\u2019s be friends. You can call me Huo Qi.\u201d Besides, in the celestial race\u2019s world, that bug wouldn\u2019t be able to escape. Even if he didn\u2019t burn him this time, it didn\u2019t matter.</p><br/><p>The man laughed brightly, his face friendly as he said, \u201cYou can call me Old Qi. How do O address the both of you?\u201d Technically, she had saved him, even if her method was unconventional. Thankfully she had mon\u2014 <em>Cough! </em>She had sincerity.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m Yao Si,\u201d she replied, then turned to the person beside her. \u201cHe\u2019s called\u2026\u201d She paused, remembering Mu Xuan\u2019s insane popularity in the Galaxy. She hesitated slightly, debating whether to tell the truth or not.</p><br/><p>\u201cMu Xuan!\u201d Before she could reply, the man gave his name himself.</p><br/><p>Wow! Wasn\u2019t he going incognito to get her to practice? As the ruler of the bloodlings, could he really reveal his name just like that?</p><br/><p>\u201cMu Xuan?\u201d Huo Qi eyes went wide. \u201cYour name\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Indeed, he could recognize him after all!</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have the same name as the ruler of the bloodlings!\u201d Huo Qi exclaimed. \u201cYou must be his fan too!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh? Ah!\u201d</p>\n</div>"}

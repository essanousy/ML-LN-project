This was practically a battlefield\u2026<em>Nephew Gu, remember what you put me through!</em></p><br/><p>\u201cHehehehe\u2026 To have President Gu himself elect you, you must be a remarkable student.\u201d The emcee chuckled as he walked towards Yao Si. \u201cAs President Gu\u2019s first competitor who is also an elementary student, what special talents do you have? Could you share them with the rest of us?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si stiffened. \u201cI-I don\u2019t have any talents!\u201d None at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cGreat!\u201d</p><br/><p>Gu Shucheng applauded vigorously. Everything Her Highness said was out of the world.</p><br/><p>The next instant, the entire hall exploded into a roaring applause.</p><br/><p>Yao Si, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The emcee, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The student union,\u201d\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The entire student body, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p><em>Nephew Gu, are you sure you aren\u2019t out to embarrass me!</em></p><br/><p>\u25cb|\uffe3|_</p><br/><p>\u201cHah\u2026 Hahheh\u2026\u201d The emcee was left speechless. Stiffly, he muttered, \u201cTh-the voting shall commence! Let\u2019s welcome Ex-president Gu.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nephew Gu walked forward, stopping a step behind Yao Si. His expression was serious, with just a hint of excitement.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe voting shall commence!\u201d</p><br/><p>Upon the emcee\u2019s order, the students opened their optical computers and cast their votes. The stage had two separate screens, with Gu Shucheng\u2019s name on one and Yao Si\u2019s on the other. Below their names was a number, with one side\u2019s jumping upwards rapidly. (It was obviously Gu Shucheng\u2019s side.)</p><br/><p>Below Yao Si\u2019 name was an incredibly exasperating zero. It was only after Nephew Gu switched on his optical computer that the number finally jumped up to \u201c1\u201d. Yao Si felt her entire being burning up. She wanted to go home!</p><br/><p>\u201cThe voting has ended.\u201d The emcee announced after five minutes. \u201cYao Si, 2 votes, Gu Shucheng 15,463 votes. The student union president for this year will be\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI give up!\u201d Gu Shucheng raised his arm to announce before the emcee could finish his sentence.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p><em>F**k! Nephew Gu, if you stir anymore trouble, I\u2019m going to sever all ties with you!</em></p><br/><p>\u201cPresident\u2026 President Gu,\u201d the emcee called out with an agonized expression. \u201cIf you give up, we won\u2019t be able to settle on a president today.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy not? If I give up, the position will naturally be given to her.\u201d Gu Shucheng glared at the emcee with fury before adding, \u201cWhat do you outsiders know?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo\u2026 no!\u201d Even though they had worked before in the past, why hadn\u2019t she realized he was such an impulsive person. \u201cAccording to the rules, the candidate can only qualify if they receive more than 50% of the votes. This means that only you qualify.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFrom what I remember, an ex-president has the ability to disqualify a candidate.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIndeed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I shall disqualify myself.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d <em>You can\u2019t do that\u2026</em></p><br/><p>\u201cYou should be honored.\u201d <em>Her Highness is willing to cooperate in this little game, what more can you ask for? </em> \u201cShe would definitely be the best president in the academy\u2019s history!\u201d Turning, Huo Qi ignored the emcee entirely and smiled brightly at Yao Si. \u201cYour Highness, congratulations on your success.\u201d</p><br/><p>The entire committee stared speechless. Was the president always this reckless?</p><br/><p>\u201cEr, Nephew Gu\u2026\u201d Yao Si wanted to express her opinion, that she had no intention to join the student union, but someone ran out from the side at this moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck, Boss Gu, what are you up to?\u201d A blonde-haired student took large strides toward them, looking Yao Si up and down in a derogatory manner. \u201cEven if you no longer wish to be the president, how could you give it to a newcomer. Who even is she?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBai Yi!\u201d Gu Shucheng snapped, his face darkening as he glared at him. In a grave manner, he snarled, \u201cMind your language.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with my language?\u201d Bai Yi retorted. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you today? Even though we don\u2019t treat the student union seriously, what are you trying to do this time? She can\u2019t be a newbie from our race, right? I haven\u2019t received any notifications, what about you?\u201d He turned to glance at the others.</p><br/><p>They shook their heads simultaneously.</p><br/><p>Gu Shucheng received it, and it was a direct order from the Elders\u2019 Council. He had been yanked to the council in the middle of the night to received the final decision from all the Elders. Even till today, it still seemed like a dream. Their glorious royal highness wanted to attend the Galactic Academy, and not at the high school level, but actually the elementary one. She wanted to experience life, and he was tasked with helping her and ensuring her safe. Most importantly, though, he had to remind her to be home for dinner.</p><br/><p>Her Highness had entered the academy to experience life, so she probably wouldn\u2019t want her identity to be exposed, so he didn\u2019t send any information regarding it to the other bloodlings in the academy. But with her prestigious identity, it wouldn\u2019t be right for her to be looked down upon. In this case, wouldn\u2019t her becoming the student union president be the best solution?</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to know.\u201d Gu Shucheng glanced at them sideways. \u201cShe will definitely be the next president.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut\u2026\u201d <em>I don\u2019t want it!</em></p><br/><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d Before Yao Si could finish her sentence, a long-legged female walked forward, chuckling. \u201cI believe Boss Gu. If you\u2019re so insistent, let\u2019s go with her!\u201d</p><br/><p>The next moment, Yao Si\u2019s vote count jumped from two to three!</p><br/><p>\u201cLuo Ying\u2026 You\u2026\u201d Bai Yi took a glance in her direction, then grabbed his hair in frustration and sighed deeply. Soon though, his face collapsed into submission. \u201cForget it, you guys can do whatever you want, I\u2019ll just follow suit!\u201d</p><br/><p>Bloodlings always deal with things in groups.</p><br/><p>The next moment, the other members followed suit.</p><br/><p>The number below Yao Si\u2019s name jumped from three to ten.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d <em>Er, didn\u2019t the voting end already? How did the votes change!</em></p><br/><p>\u201cPre-President.\u201d The emcee was in disbelief. This was the presidential election, not an internal bloodling election. \u201cThe voting has ended, changing your votes is not permitted. Besides\u2026 even if it was allowed, it\u2019s\u2026 still below 50%.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI think the votes are enough,\u201d Gu Shucheng announced. \u201cSince you\u2019ve gained the support of half the committee, you\u2019re definitely suited to be part of them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are suited, indeed!\u201d a lofty voice stated, and just then, a familiar figure walked out from the backstage.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Yao Si\u2019s face twitched\u2026</p><br/><p>(\u256f\u2035\u25a1\u2032)\u256f\ufe35\u253b\u2501\u253b</p><br/><p><em>Didn\u2019t we agree for you to wait at home! Are you all trying to cause trouble for me!</em></p>\n</div>"}

He had a look of disbelief when he glanced at her. \u201cThi-this, senior, your magical device produced a spirit!\u201d</p><br/><p><em>What is he saying?</em></p><br/><p>\u201cWith such a magical device, we will definitely be able to escape this demonic realm!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut I would like to trouble with something.\u201d Yao Si twisted her fingers in embarrassment.</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior, please speak your mind.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have any transportation equipment\u2026 Er, what I mean is, I don\u2019t have a flying sword. So\u2026\u201d <em>I\u2019ll have to trouble you for that. </em></p><br/><p>\u201cI see!\u201d He nodded nonchalantly. \u201cNo worries, I tend to cast equipment in my leisure time, so even though the level isn\u2019t high, using a sword for transport is totally fine. Senior, if you don\u2019t mind\u2026\u201d With a wave of his hand, a deafening clang erupted and a sword appeared by her feet. \u201cI can lend it to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p><em>He is\u2026 friendly indeed!</em></p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how to use it though.\u201d He just had to force the truth out!</p><br/><p>Zan Zichen stilled, the idea never once having crossed his mind. He sat in a daze for a long while. When he finally thought of something, he glanced at her with guilt in his eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s all my fault!\u201d</p><br/><p>Senior must have been gravely injured, which prevents her from flying on the sword, but she still put on a strong front just to activate the map of Mountain He Luo to bring him out. To not have realized this was a mistake on my part!</p><br/><p>He raised his hand to take back the sword, then silently summoned the sword he had used previously. He freed up two-thirds of the sword\u2019s space. \u201cSenior, please!\u201d His gaze when he looked at Yao Si was filled with admiration, worship, and gratitude.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Even though she wasn\u2019t sure of his thoughts, a free chauffeur was great. Swiftly, she got onto the sword.</p><br/><p><em>Buzz. </em>[The navigation shall begin, please proceed forward. Turn right after 15 km to arrive at 28.12\u00b0N, 112.59\u00b0E.]</p><br/><p>This time, without any further instructions, Zan Zichen headed forward.</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>This so called demonic realm was indeed vast. Yao Si had at first assumed, based on the speed of her previous sword travels, that she would be able to reach their destination in a few minutes. But she hadn\u2019t expected that celestials had different levels.</p><br/><p>Zan Zichen was a local of the Shadow Planet, and it was clear that his sword skills were of a lower level. If the one steered by Li Yue was a flying ship, then Zan Zichen\u2019s one would be considered a bicycle.</p><br/><p>They only managed to fly out of the ninth district after two whole hours. The moment they left, the darkness started to seep away, the scenery turning bright and sunny. It looked just like an image from a tourism site.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re out, we\u2019re really out!\u201d Zan Zichen was so excited he almost jumped off the sword. Fortunately, he remembered in time that there was still a passenger on board. He stopped over a grass field, bowing politely at Yao Si once more. \u201cThank you, Senior Si, for leading me out of the demonic realm. I will never forget it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha, it\u2019s not that serious.\u201d She patted his shoulder nonchalantly. \u201cAll I did was navigate, I still have to thank you for bringing me all the way.\u201d Besides, the actual navigator was the GPS.</p><br/><p>The man\u2019s face was clouded with gratitude. \u201cSenior, you\u2019re indeed noble!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si glanced at the area they just left, noticing how there seemed to be two extremes here\u2014one place was drowned in darkness while the other bright and sunny. There wasn\u2019t any middle ground between the two, with a clean line separating the regions. This was probably the reason behind the planet\u2019s name \u2013 Shadow Planet.</p>\n</div>"}

There were so many of them, there wasn\u2019t any space between them.</p><br/><p>The group\u2019s abilities were completely useless against the blood swords. The elders were on the verge of being killed, and Yao Si panicked. The pervert was a first generation bloodling, so the elders wouldn\u2019t be able to heal from his attacks. This meant that\u2026 they would really die!</p><br/><p>Her heart sank. Gathering the strength she didn\u2019t know she had, Yao Si pushed past the binds. \u201cStop!\u201d Energy surged within her, and her body seemed to have a will of its own as she released the power.</p><br/><p>A white glow gradually emanated from within her, sweeping through the whole space. The sky full of blood swords and even the elders\u2019 abilities disappeared as though they had never existed.</p><br/><p>The blood that was restraining Yao Si was gone too. She felt her body rise upwards before she fell down on her bum. The entire space had been cleared out forcefully, leaving everyone including the pervert stupefied.</p><br/><p>Before they had time to react, Yao Si shouted at the crowd, \u201cLeave with the particle transports!\u201d Worried that they weren\u2019t fast enough, she summoned out the fifth generation\u2019s bloodline suppression.</p><br/><p>The crowd snapped out of their daze and left with the help of the transportation devices. Yao Si pressed on the device as well, and a white glow washed over all of them.</p><br/><p>The elders disappeared. In the blink of an eye, they were all back at the council room.</p><br/><p>Everyone heaved a sigh of relief; they were still alive.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat person will be here soon, so the Red Planet is in danger. We have to evacuate all the bloodlings and inform His Majesty. Your Highness, why don\u2019t you\u2014 Eh? Her Highness\u2026 where is she?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Yao Si who was still at the same spot.</p><br/><p>(\u256f\u2035\u25a1\u2032)\u256f\ufe35\u253b\u2501\u253b</p><br/><p><em>Why am I still here? </em>Didn\u2019t she activate the device? Did she get a fake transportation device?!</p><br/><p>\u201cI never expected you to have such wits!\u201d the sinister voice of the pervert came from behind her.</p><br/><p>Yao Si trembled. She could vaguely feel a word floating above her head\u2014Doomed!</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a pity you can\u2019t use any of those little devices once you are in the vicinity of my energy.\u201d</p><br/><p>He glanced behind her, and Yao Si remembered the barrier. She then cursed internally. <em>F*ck! Why didn\u2019t anyone mention that?! Such luck!</em></p><br/><p><em>o(\u256f\u25a1\u2570)o</em></p><br/><p>\u201cBut, you really left me in awe.\u201d He laughed without a tinge of humor, his gaze turning cold. \u201cBut a bastard is still a bastard. Even the best ability is child\u2019s play at best.\u201d</p><br/><p>He turned abruptly, heading over toward her. With every step he took, the pool of blood behind him grew. It seemed to come alive. As he raised his hand, the fluid rushed over to wrap around her.</p><br/><p>\u201cI had no intentions of meddling with you bastards.\u201d He glanced at her coldly. \u201cBut you had to serve yourself so willingly! But I guess it would prove to useful. With your death, that pure breed will definitely wake up from this unrealistic dream.\u201d</p><br/><p>The next moment, the sky filled with blood swords who flew toward her.</p><br/><p>Yao Si was stunned. That guy was really going to kill her! <em>F*ck! What luck! </em>Who did she offend? Why did everyone want to kill her? Instinctively, she tried to resist like before, but the energy within her was long gone. Even at such a crucial moment, her ability was playing tricks on her!</p><br/><p>The number of blood swords started to increase. The slightest movement of the man\u2019s fingers was enough to send the sky full of swords flying toward her.</p><br/><p>Yao Si felt a chill wash over her as despair drowned her. Instinctively, she screwed her eyes shut. <em>Mu Xuan!</em></p><br/><p>Ding\u2026</p><br/><p>Surprisingly, the pain never arrived. The second before the swords hit her, a layer of transparent shield encapsulated her, stopping all the swords. Yao Si\u2019s forehead grew warm with the slightest hint of a sting as a red flame mark emerged.</p><br/><p>\u201cBlood contract!\u201d the pervert exclaimed, the disdain on his face replaced by astonishment as he stared at her in disbelief. Mixed emotions crossed his face: suspicion, shock, unwillingness to accept, and hatred?</p><br/><p>Like a gust of wind, he flew over and yanked her arm over, his eyes wide open. \u201cYou are his contractor?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d <em>Eh? Contractor\u2026 what\u2019s that?</em></p><br/><p>The man didn\u2019t seem to need a reply. His suspicion was confirmed as he glared at the mark on her forehead, his jaw tightening. After half a minute, he released her arm, and even the blood that kept her captive went away.</p><br/><p>The man seemed to have met with an unexpected situation, and he started to pace about anxiously as he mumbled to himself.</p><br/><p>\u201cWasn\u2019t she supposed to be a cub? The old man is just deceiving himself. How could such a thing happen?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a contractor! She really is the contractor! He really found the contractor!</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck! F*ck! F*ck! How is this possible?!</p><br/><p>\u201cI guess it won\u2019t be possible to go back with his help, but\u2026 why him?!</p><br/><p>\u201cAhahah! Why is it like this? Why could he find it?\u201d</p><br/><p>The pervert grew increasingly distressed, his expression changing every second. Yao Si\u2019s heart sank as she caressed her heated forehead. Even though she couldn\u2019t understand his actions, but he seemed to be too preoccupied to kill her. Exploiting his confusion, she inched toward the barrier.</p><br/><p>First step\u2026 second step\u2026 third step\u2026 Almost!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d <em>F*ck!</em></p><br/><p>The pervert moved like the wind, appearing in front of her.</p><br/><p>\u201cHeh, heh, heh\u2026\u201d Yao Si raised her hands weakly. \u201cYou seem rather busy\u2026 so why don\u2019t I go first?\u201d</p><br/><p>His face turned green, but surprisingly, he wasn\u2019t the least bit infuriated. Instead, he glanced at her with a mix of emotions, looking her up and down. Half a second later, a thought seemed to have struck him, and he glared at her ferociously. \u201cI can\u2019t let you go yet.\u201d He yanked her toward the red fluid, speaking to him himself, \u201cF*ck, I\u2019ve really gotten myself a burden. Hurry, hurry, I\u2019m busy!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si stumbled, almost falling from his yank. She hurried to follow his pace; however, he seemed to have turned into a different person, the murderous intent completely gone. He\u2026 what were his intentions? Was he afraid of Mu Xuan and wanted to use her as a hostage? But from the looks of things, he didn\u2019t seem to care about Mu Xuan at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you looking at?\u201d He turned to glare at her. \u201cHurry, stop wasting my time. I can\u2019t kill you anyway.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Yao Si stilled. He didn\u2019t say that he wasn\u2019t going to kill, but rather\u2026 he couldn\u2019t?!</p><br/><p>What did that mean?</p><br/><p>She frowned, relaxing a little.</p><br/><p><em>Since you can\u2019t touch me, I\u2019ll be fine.</em></p></div>\n</div>"}

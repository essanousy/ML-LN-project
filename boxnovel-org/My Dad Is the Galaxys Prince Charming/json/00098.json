Once she was back, she assumed that they would be called back as well. However, due to a certain nanny dad\u2019s temper, the Elders Council had been occupied with the reconstruction of the majestic palace. They had tossed the four of them far to the back of their minds.</p><br/><p>Yao Si was at a loss for words; she instantly instructed Yan Xuan to get them back from the planet Shadow. She even waited for them at the pier to prevent anymore accidents from occurring. The moment she caught sight of them, she had to do a double take.</p><br/><p><em>Er\u2026 Who are these bandits? What happened to them on planet Shadow? </em></p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>It didn\u2019t make sense. Even though they were above the 800th generation, they were all relatively skilled. A primitive planet such as Shadow shouldn\u2019t have possessed any creatures which could injure them. How exactly had they then ended up in such a miserable state?</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Highness\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>They inhaled simultaneously upon catching sight of her, looking more miserable than before. After take glances at each other, they started to speak one after the other.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Highness, you actually came to get us personally. This is\u2026 so touching.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you made it back on time. We will seek punishment for the failed mission.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, we actually failed to watch you properly, betraying His Majesty\u2019s trust. It was extremely unfaithful of us, and we are willing to accept any punishment that awaits us.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Highness, could you present us with our punishment?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it to hack us to pieces or to put us to eternal sleep? Will His Majesty do it personally?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Yao Si.</p><br/><p><em>Heh, so this is what they have been worried about, what pushed them to this state? What kind of image does Mu Xuan have in the bloodlings\u2019 eyes?</em></p><br/><p>\u201cEnough, the incident was my fault and it has nothing to do with you guys.\u201d Yao Si patted their shoulders to comfort them. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll take care of Mu Xuan. It\u2019ll be fine.\u201d <em>Most of his anger had already been expressed at Chatterbox Qin, so there won\u2019t be much left for you guys. </em></p><br/><p>The four\u2019s eyes lit up instantly, bringing life back into them.</p><br/><p>\u201cReally? Your Highness!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great, Your Highness. Thank you for sparing our lives!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh my, these two months worth of worry have really taken a toll on my mental health.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Highness, you\u2019re amazing. I wish you a long life, Your Highness. Are you heading back for lunch now?\u201d</p><br/><p><em>F*ck. Nephew Gu, could you forget about it at least once?!</em></p><br/><p>Yao Si couldn\u2019t be bothered about them any longer and turned to return home because\u2026 it really was going to be lunchtime soon. After leaving the pier, she was met with a familiar figure.</p><br/><p><em>Eh, isn\u2019t that Sister Luo Ying?</em></p><br/><p>\u201cLuo\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShucheng!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si was about to call out to her, but the woman jumped forward and dashed into the arms of someone behind her. This was the first time Yao Si was neglected by a bloodling and had to awkwardly retrieve her outstretched arm.</p><br/><p>\u201cYing!\u201d Nephew Gu caught her with natural ease. He stilled slightly before tightening his arms around her, and they morphed into a single being without any obstructions.</p><br/><p>Yao Si glanced over and gasped slightly at their close relationship. Previously, Sister Luo Ying had been caught while finding Gu Shucheng, but if she hadn\u2019t reminded Yao Si about him, she would have only realized about their absence some time even later.</p><br/><p>\u201cHeh, torturing us single dogs again!\u201dBai Yi lamented as he turned to glance at them. He chased the others off impatiently, giving them their space.</p><br/><p>On his way out, he couldn\u2019t help lamenting once more. \u201cHeh, what\u2019s so impressive about having a cub? Are you looking down on us single dogs? This can\u2019t do, I have to hurry and apply for one as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>The other two bloodlings nodded in agreement.</p><br/><p><em>Hmm, that\u2019s odd\u2026 What\u2019s the connection between single dogs and cubs?</em></p><br/><p>Yao Si was confused. She turned back toward the father and daughter pair who were still in an embrace. Nephew Gu lowered his head to whisper something into Luo Ying\u2019s ear, causing her to blush, and she buried her head into his arms. The scene was tender and harmonious.</p><br/><p>Yao Si couldn\u2019t help an odd thought from forming. Something seemed out of place, but she couldn\u2019t place her finger on it. Instead, she left with Yan Xuan and the others. Any later and she would really be late for lunch.</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>After Nephew Gu returned, Yao Si abandoned her school committee duties, thoroughly letting loose of herself\u2026 Erm, focusing on her education.</p><br/><p>\u201cRobot?\u201d Mu Xuan stilled in the middle of pouring her soup. He frowned deeply as he passed her the bowl. \u201cWhy the sudden interest in robots?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe academy requires us to choose at least three optional courses,\u201d Yao Si replied while taking a sip of the soup. \u201cRobots\u2019 combat power is second only to that of abilities, and I would like to pick up another skill. Besides, the main field for the high school branch is abilities, but with you, I have no need to learn about them from the academy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mu Xuan\u2019s tense face relaxed instantly. \u201cYou can learn, but robots are after all just a tool while abilities are a bloodling\u2019s main strength. You don\u2019t have to take it seriously.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, dad!\u201d Yao Si placed the half-eaten bowl down, circling over to his side of the table. \u201cHelp me out with something.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMu Xuan!\u201d he corrected her out of habit as he glanced down at her bright eyes which clearly betrayed that she was up to something. \u201cTell me about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSince I plan to learn about robots, I should have real life operating experience, right? But you should know that according to the rules set by the Galactic Alliance, students like me aren\u2019t allowed to buy real robots.\u201d Not even with money. \u201cSo could you\u2026\u201d She paused, focusing on him.</p><br/><p>Mu Xuan froze, then raised his hand to caress her head before asking with worry, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with your eyes?\u201d <em>Why are you blinking so much?</em></p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d <em>Can\u2019t you see that I\u2019m trying to seduce you?!</em></p><br/><p>Yao Si felt like she\u2019d been stabbed in the heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou want a robot?\u201d an oblivious nanny dad asked while blowing air at her eyes. With an expression of utmost seriousness, he asked, \u201cAre you feeling better?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Even though Yao Si felt another stab to her heart, she nodded aggressively. \u201cMmh, mmh, mmh.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBase on my knowledge, the academy\u2019s mechanic department has its own specialized stimulation system which can replicate a robot\u2019s operation. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut a replica will never match up to the real thing.\u201d Yao Si grabbed onto his arm. It was like comparing a race car game to an actual car race. Besides, as an earthling that grew up watching transformers, she had to get her hands on the real thing. \u201cDidn\u2019t you say that real battles were the best way to elevate my ability?\u201d</p><br/><p>Mu Xuan frowned slightly before nodding. He glanced at her bowl and instructed seriously, \u201cFinish it, don\u2019t leave anything behind. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>Mu Xuan would always agree to Yao Si\u2019s demands as long as she ate well. Taking advantage of the weekend, he brought her over to the practice ground. Under her expectant expression, he pulled out a space button like object and pressed it.</p><br/><p>With a beep, the space ahead of her seemed to be ripped apart, forming an opening. With a resounding explosion, a gigantic robot as tall as three men appeared before her.</p><br/><p>It was unlike the transformer or robot she\u2019d seen in movies and animations. It was\u2026 a fatty!</p><br/><p>-_-|||</p><br/><p>And he had a huge beer belly that looked like an inflated ball. Even though it was three meters high, its limbs were short and stubby.</p><br/><p>The imposing and formidable scene Yao Si had envisioned shattered into pieces. She couldn\u2019t help turning to glance at a certain nanny dad, suspecting his tastes.</p><br/><p>Aren\u2019t robots available in every design? Why is this one so ugly? Couldn\u2019t you have asked me if you didn\u2019t know how to choose?</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is a beginner model,\u201d Mu Xuan explained, sensing her curiosity. \u201cIt has one of the best defense systems compared to the others. Since you are just starting out, this model is the most suited for you.\u201d</p><br/><p><em>That explains it!</em></p><br/><p>Yao Si circled the robot. Even though it looked big and bulky, the design was indeed exquisite; the robot was securely closed up, without any exposed internal pieces. But she couldn\u2019t be sure if it really had the best defense system as Mu Xuan had mentioned, and she suddenly had an urge to test it out with her ability.</p><br/><p>Mu Xuan seemed to have pressed something, for with a sudden beep, the robot\u2019s huge tummy opened up, exposing an empty space.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you want to try piloting?\u201d He pointed inside.</p><br/><p>Yao Si nodded immediately, heading in according to his instructions. She landed within the narrow space of less than two square meters. Once she had stabilized herself, the ground beneath her lit up, and rays of light encircled her limbs and wrists as the door shut itself. She was the only one left in the space and started to panic, but just when she was about to call for Mu Xuan, she heard his voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be scared, reach for the operation system with your mental strength.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si followed his instructions. The next second, the originally blank space disappeared, and Mu Xuan\u2019s figured reappeared in front of her, but he seemed smaller than before. Was she operating the robot?</p><br/><p>She lowered her head with curiosity to glance at her hands and saw they they were the short and stubby robot paws. She felt as though she had completely transformed into a robot.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is connected and dependent on your mental strength,\u201d Mu Xuan told her. \u201cEven though it feels the same, the controls will differ from your normal movement. Since this is your first time, you might not be too comfortable, but once you get use to it, it\u2019ll get better.\u201d He pointed to an area nearby. \u201cTry heading there.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si tried to walk, but the robot remained stationary. Even though the external view was clear and she could clearly sense every inch of the robot, it didn\u2019t feel a part of her and didn\u2019t move regardless of how hard she tried.</p><br/><p>\u201cCalm down, don\u2019t try to move your body. The robot is a product of your mental strength, so try moving it with your mind.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si stopped moving her feet and cleared her heart. With a deep inhale, she spread her mental strength throughout the entire robot and focused on the spot ahead. It became the single goal in her mind. And as expected, the robot finally moved, heading toward her destination at high speed!</p><br/><p>But\u2026 it was moving too fast.</p><br/><p>The robot bolted forward like an arrow with a loud whoosh, and her vision flashed. The next second, a loud thud rang in the air when the robot smashed into the wall.</p><br/><p>Yao Si\u2019s vision darkened, and a row of red words appeared before her.</p><br/><p>[The robot is severely damaged. It is no longer safe for piloting, so please apply for demolition!]</p><br/><p><em>F*ck!</em></p>\n</div>"}

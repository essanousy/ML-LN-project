Demonic girl, what\u2019s wrong with your face?\u201d A certain ignorant chatterbox inched over to glance at her with curiosity, completely oblivious to the tense atmosphere. He was so close that their faces were almost touching.</p><br/><p>He took a close inspection of her. \u201cEven your face can change. Are you perhaps a demon that preys on humans\u2019 yang energy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat rubbish are you sprouting?\u201d Yao Si took a step back. She was trying to resolve a family problem here!</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t try to deny it, that explains why you resorted to such despicable means in order to get my body.\u201d</p><br/><p><em>F*ck! Who exactly taught you your language?! </em></p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you saying!\u201d Before Yao Si could retort, Mu Xuan\u2019s suppressed ability lost control, erupting from his body with a thunderous explosion. Everything in the house rose up as though there wasn\u2019t any gravity before disintegrating into dust, and even the building disappeared.</p><br/><p>There wasn\u2019t enough time for Yao Si to process the situation. Her mouth was stuffed with dust and her little house was gone while the surrounding area had become a flatland. The ground was even still trembling. In truth, the whole city was shaking, cracks inching outward from beneath Mu Xuan\u2019s feet; it seemed like an apocalypse.</p><br/><p>\u201cDa-dad!\u201d Yao Si jumped in fright. It was the first time she had experienced the horror of Mu Xuan\u2019s wrath. She was placed in the hot seat when a certain someone prepared to explode the whole Red Planet. She hugged him in a hurry. \u201cCalm down, calm down, hear me out! You misunderstood!\u201d</p><br/><p>Mu Xuan was on the verge of losing control, but he paused, lowering his head to glance at her. The horrifying air surrounding him calmed slightly, and in a cold voice he said, \u201cHear you out?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si nodded with utmost sincerity and obedience. \u201cYes, yes, yes, hear me out first\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDe-de-demon\u2026\u201d Chatterbox Qin was frightened out of his wits, collapsing into a trembling mess. He glanced at her, trying to say something. \u201cYou\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShut up!\u201d</p><br/><p>The eerie air that had dissipated slightly was starting to intensify once again, so Yao Si hurriedly cut him off. <em>Stop wreaking havoc when your language is so wrong! </em>She took a deep breath before spilling everything that she had experienced on Shadow Planet.</p><br/><p>Ten minutes later\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cContracted? You mean\u2026\u201d Mu Xuan turned toward the person who had collapsed from his legs going weak. \u201cHe is a pet you adopted?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEr, you\u2026 can say that?\u201d Chatterbox Qin was thus even downgraded from a local specialty to a pet.</p><br/><p>Mu Xuan\u2019s face darkened. \u201cYou want to keep him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course not!\u201d She didn\u2019t posses such special hobbies. \u201cHe can\u2019t return to his planet since he isn\u2019t of SSS physique so I didn\u2019t have a choice but to bring him back.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mu Xuan frowned, his explosive ability finally calming, but there was still something bothering him that he couldn\u2019t describe. He still wanted to kill someone!</p><br/><p>\u201cSince he is part of the Celestial Clan, just leave it to them.\u201d Mu Xuan called for Yan Xuan, instructing him to come over.</p><br/><p>Yan Xuan arrived in less than five minutes in his small flying ship. He made an abrupt stop in the air once he was close and came almost falling over his own feet.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Majesty, Your Highness!\u201d His eyes went wide when he scanned the flattened grounds repeatedly, suspecting he was in the wrong location. Where was the majestic palace? Did it collapse from the earthquake just then? But wouldn\u2019t the structure still be there if it had collapsed? Why was the ground flat and the area empty?</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll leave him to you.\u201d With a slight lift of his arm, Chatterbox Qin who was collapsed on the ground floated up and was tossed toward Yan Xuan like a burden.</p><br/><p>Yan Xuan grabbed hold of him with a face of confusion. \u201cYour Majesty?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou take care of it.\u201d</p><br/><p><em>Take care? Which sort of take care are you referring to? Deep fry or stir fry? </em> Yan Xuan was filled with confusion.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Majesty, this person\u2026\u201d He was just about to ask about the particulars, but he was harshly cut off.</p><br/><p>\u201cFind it out yourself!\u201d The horrifying air around Mu Xuan exploded.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d Yan Xuan hurriedly left with Chatterbox Qin. <em>His majesty is so scary today!</em></p><br/><p>Yao Si stared at their hasty exit. With Yan Xuan\u2019s close relationship with the celestials, he was the best person to entrust this matter. She finally calmed down as the huge matter had been resolved.</p><br/><p>But\u2026</p><br/><p>Where were they going to stay?</p><br/><p>Yao Si glanced at the sparse land, feeling slightly teary. She couldn\u2019t help glancing over at the culprit. Isn\u2019t the impact of your temper a bit too much? Dad, you are so wasteful! It\u2019s going to affect your family members, aren\u2019t you aware?</p><br/><p>\u201cMu\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Before she could speak, she felt a tightening around her waist as she was enveloped in an embrace, and a familiar smell flooded her senses. Mu Xuan lowered his head, resting his forehead on hers.</p><br/><p>Yao Si twitched about awkwardly. The next second, hot air touched her ear.</p><br/><p>\u201cSisi, I can agree to everything you want with only one exception.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d <em>What?</em></p><br/><p>Yao Si stilled. She was about to clarify, but Mu Xuan had already let her go. He held onto her hand and started to leave.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait a minute\u2026 where are we going?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSomewhere to stay.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStay?\u201d Were they perhaps heading to a hotel? \u201cThat isn\u2019t a good idea\u2026\u201d He was after all the ruler of the bloodlings. To be left without a home and relegating to a hotel with his cub\u2026 it would definitely make it to the headlines in all of Galaxy the next day.</p><br/><p>It showed up that she was overthinking, however. Mu Xuan brought her to\u2026 her house. It was constructed for her by the bloodlings two years ago, but had remained empty since.</p><br/><p>Yao Si thought that the matter had been resolved, but unexpectedly, even though Mu Xuan was slightly appeased, he was still bothered. With respect to her straying away during the training, a certain nanny dad had spent an entire night guiding her patiently on mental education. He even detained her for a whole week, watching her closely as she wrote her ten thousand word reflection. He only unwillingly let her out during the start of the new school term.</p><br/><p>It happened after countless reminders, though. Once Yao Si was finally out, she took in a deep breath. She had never loved school more than at that moment. She passed through the entrance door, relaxing once she entered the school\u2019s premises.</p><br/><p>The familiar school gate seemed to have come from another universe. Why did it feel like she had forgotten something though?</p><br/><p><em>Forget it, it isn\u2019t important! Learning is of greater importance!</em></p><br/><p>\u201cAh!\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment she entered the academy, she was greeted by piercing screams.</p><br/><p>\u201cPre-pre-president is here, fifth-generation\u2026 blood-bloodling.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s real, it\u2019s real! She looks exactly the same as in the video.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAhhhhhh! This is the fifth-generation, fifth-generation!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMost importantly, she is God Mu\u2019s cub! Our God Mu is no longer a single dog.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo excited! Since president is here, where is God Mu? Is God Mu perhaps here as well?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>F*ck! She had completely forgotten that her identity had been exposed. If she had known, she would have brought the mental strength necklace along.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs she finally here? I have been here for the past two hours.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been here for three hours!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been here for four hours!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha, it was a coincidence for me, thankfully I\u2019m late today. I\u2019m so lucky!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMe too, me too! I\u2019m going to be late every single day from today onwards!\u201d</p><br/><p><em>Hey, hey, hey, what the f*ck do you mean by being late every day? Don\u2019t cultivate such horrible habits! Anyways\u2026 am I late?</em></p><br/><p>The crowd started to pile up, almost filling the entire doorway. Yao Si greeted them with a smile, passing through the gates before the crowd could react. She bolted toward the high school department at full speed. It seemed that her low profile lifestyle was no longer an option.</p><br/><p>Thankfully, the schools in the Galaxy were unlike back on the Blue Planet. Even though everyone was in the same classroom, there wasn\u2019t any interaction required. The classrooms would automatically segment themselves into individual cubicles according to the number of students. Each student would be provided with learning videos that had been curated to fit their knowledge. Hence, there weren\u2019t any teachers required.</p><br/><p>After focusing on a few lessons, Yao Si received a meeting notification from the school committee. She shut the learning videos instantly and headed to the committee office in a hurry, bearing the curious scrutiny of the passing students.</p><br/><p>Unlike the carefree and harmonious vibe from last school term, the entire committee seemed to emit a nervous and solemn air the moment she entered. The committee, half of which were bloodlings, stood up and greeted her in a firm and uniform voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello, Your Highness!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Hello, everyone, hello.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Highness, you have worked hard!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 For the people\u2026 Ah, pssh, it isn\u2019t hard at all! Sit, sit!\u201d It seemed like a military parade.</p><br/><p>After everyone was seated, they began reporting the activities for the next semester systematically. Yao Si who was used to being a figurehead agreed to all their arrangements, which were mostly a repetition of previous traditions. However, the department head to her side stood up hesitantly during his turn.</p><br/><p>\u201cPresident, there\u2019s one more thing. Zhuo Feng Academy wishes to hold a friendly robot competition and have already invited all the academies in the Galaxy, including us.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRobot competition?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si paused. Even though she had never been in touch with robots, she had heard about them. They seemed to be the peak of the galactic technology and was the only thing that may be comparable to abilities.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d The department head then gave her more information. \u201cEven though Zhuo Feng Academy has a good reputation, it isn\u2019t as influential as us. If the First Academy doesn\u2019t participate in this competition they are hosting, the other academies will most probably not pay much attention to it as well. Hence, they reached out to us so eagerly.\u201d</p><br/><p><em>I see!</em></p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you guys think?\u201d She turned toward the rest; after all, she had no experience in such a thin</p><br/><p>The moment she asked, everyone\u2019s eyes lit up as though being asked by her was an honor. The next second, their hands shot up. Yao Si felt her face muscles twitch. How long was their fan mode going to last?</p><br/><p>She randomly picked a person that was close to her.</p><br/><p>The person was ecstatic, bolting upright. He took a deep breath before saying, \u201cYour Highness, our academy has always prioritized personal ability development while Zhuo Feng Academy, which was set up by the Galactic Alliance troops, placed their focus on mechanics. In general, both academies are on par in terms of machinery knowledge.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf we were to compete, it would definitely be more stressful than the previous competitions and there wouldn\u2019t be an assured outcome. However, this sort of competition would be able to ignite the passion that students have for robots, be it the operation, creation, or maintenance. It would definitely be beneficial so\u2026 I am all for it.\u201d</p>\n</div>"}

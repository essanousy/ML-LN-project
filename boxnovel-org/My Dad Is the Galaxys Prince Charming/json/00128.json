After Li Zheng had confirmed her identity, the first thing he had told her was: you\u2019re dead!</p><br/><p>Death was required for a conversion! She seemed to have skipped that step, so when she got killed\u2026</p><br/><p>So this was just her trying to correct the sequence?</p><br/><p>\u201cThis document shows the difference in the DNA before and after you were converted,\u201d Mu Xuan said. \u201cEven though both show that you\u2019re a fifth-generation bloodling, there\u2019s an increase in our blood compatibility. You were a pure earthling previously, slightly different from the clones\u2019 data, so no one could detect the issue.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWait a minute!\u201d Yao Si was slightly confused. \u201cYou mean I was still a human. Then why\u2026 why did I have an ability and why was I stronger?\u201d If not, it wouldn\u2019t have remained a secret for such a long time, right?</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s probably because of me\u2026\u201d Mu Xuan caressed her head. \u201cBefore, even if you had my blood, it couldn\u2019t have stayed in you for such a long time. But because I awakened the ancestral bloodline, my blood within you started to act differently.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si was\u2026 speechless!</p><br/><p>It explained why she couldn\u2019t sense her ability back when she was still on earth. It was all because she hadn\u2019t become a full-fledged bloodling. In truth, for the last few years, she had been just posing as a fifth-generation bloodling?</p><br/><p>\u201cFrom what you\u2019ve said, that I just became a real bloodling right now, does that mean my ability will change?\u201d Yao Si asked with agitation, having remembered the foreign force she had felt when trying to stop Li Zheng.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s possible.\u201d Mu Xuan nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try right now!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si bolted up in joy and placed the drink on the table. With a deep breath, she took a moment to look for her power. As expected, there was an additional foreign strength within her. She tried to recall the feeling from when she\u2019d used it, but did not dare to use all of it. She just gently probed the energy, focusing on the cup\u2026</p><br/><p>After a minute\u2026</p><br/><p>After ten minutes\u2026</p><br/><p>After thirty minutes\u2026</p><br/><p>The cup remained the same and her energy was still the same, as weak\u2026 as before!</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Nothing seemed to have changed! This is not logical!</p><br/><p>She clearly remembered that both Mu Xuan and Li Zheng hadn\u2019t been able to defend against her attack. She had even swept away all the fragments in space. So why wasn\u2019t it working?</p><br/><p>Perhaps\u2026 it has an expiration date?</p><br/><p>\u25cb|\uffe3|_</p><br/><p>\u201cMu Xuan\u2026\u201d Yao Si cried out. She had thought that by converting fully she would be able to change her fate and become powerful but\u2026 it didn\u2019t do a thing!</p><br/><p>\u201cNo worries.\u201d Mu Xuan caressed his cub\u2019s head comfortingly before assuring her in a serious voice. \u201cYou just managed to convert successfully. Even if there is a change to your ability, it\u2019s normal for it to be slightly unstable. It can\u2019t be tested in such a short time. Maybe it\u2019ll work out the next time you try it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally?\u201d You must not try to trick me just because I\u2019m ignorant!</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course!\u201d he said sincerely with a comforting expression as he continued to caress her hair. \u201cStrictly speaking, it\u2019s been less than a weak since you converted. You\u2019re still a baby!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Please take that last sentence back.</p><br/><p>(\uff89\uff40\u25a1\u00b4)\uff89\u2312\u253b\u2501\u253b</p><br/><p>After going another round, she was back to being a baby!</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, Bro\u2026 Li-Li Zheng, how is he?\u201d Yao Si asked.</p><br/><p>Mu Xuan\u2019s face paled, and his grip tightened around her waist. After a short while, he said in a low voice, \u201cHe hasn\u2019t woken up.\u201d</p><br/><p>After the fight with Mu Xuan, Li Zheng had been left with one last breath which wasn\u2019t bad enough to enter eternal hibernation. When Yao Si had woken up, Mu Xuan had told her what had happened. Li Zheng was being kept safe by the Elder Council, in an area that Mu Xuan personally guarded with his mental strength. After the battle, even though Li Zheng\u2019s injuries had healed, he was still asleep.</p><br/><p>Even though Euphoria had been almost completely dissolved, there were still a few things that only Li Zheng knew.</p><br/><p>Yao Si\u2019s heart sank. She had mixed feelings toward Li Zheng. She was thankful for his help in the beginning, when he had educated her about being a bloodling and convinced her to accept her new identity. She had been an orphan since young, so when she suddenly noticed a change in herself, she had been at a loss. Li Zheng\u2019s presence had provided her a tremendous amount of help. At the time, she treated him as a friend, maybe even a family.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan you tell me about him?\u201d Yao Si was curious about what exactly had happened for him to change so much. \u201cWere you two close?\u201d</p><br/><p>Mu Xuan\u2019s face fell. After taking a glance at her, he explained, \u201cHe was once my best friend\u2026\u201d He sighed, pulling her back to the seat before sighing once more. \u201cWe got to know each other during the doomsday period. I once told you that during that time I had been in hibernation. While many of the earthlings were trying to escape, the person who found and woke me up was Li Zheng.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si stilled, listening to how they had met each other. \u201cWhat happened then?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTogether, we headed over to the last research base in Blue Planet. At that time, the virus had spread through the whole planet. We were both fourth-generation bloodlings while most of the bloodlings who had died were either second or third generation. It was almost considered a sure death to be at the research base. On the journey there, we faced multiple perils, and one of them led to me awakening my ancestral bloodline.\u201d</p><br/><p>It meant that they had been close friends.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen why\u2026\u201d How did it all come to the events that day? What had caused Li Zheng to seek revenge against the society, not thinking twice about using Mu Xuan? It was totally unlike what close friends would do. It seemed like his hatred was\u2026 as deep as their bond had once been.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Mu Xuan stilled, as though in deep thought, and his brows furrowed. After a long while, he sighed. \u201cI killed his cub.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Yao Si froze, her eyes widening in shock.</p><br/><p>\u201cAt that time, his cub got infected with the virus, but she didn\u2019t tell anyone about it,\u201d he explained. \u201cIt was a time before my ancestral bloodline had awakened and there still wasn\u2019t a cure. It was only when his cub turned into a zombie did we find out what had happened. Since we had close ties, she came for me first.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Mu Xuan had killed Li Zheng\u2019s cub for self-preservation.</p><br/><p>Yao Si suddenly realized why Li Zheng, who had been so kind to her, had started to target her. It was to take revenge against Mu Xuan.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t a matter where someone\u2019s fault could be easily decided. Maybe Li Zheng hadn\u2019t hated Mu Xuan that much, since his cub had turned into a zombie and was technically no longer considered a bloodling.</p><br/><p>But Mu Xuan had awakened the ancestral bloodline and found a cure for the doomsday virus. He saved all of the other bloodlings but had killed his cub. Regardless of the depth of their friendship, how could he not keep asking himself why his cub? Why didn\u2019t Mu Xuan awaken earlier? Besides, Li Zheng had been alive for such a long time. After many years of stewing in such thoughts, his mind had turned extreme.</p><br/><p>And Yao Si\u2019s appearance had to have been the trigger.</p><br/><p>Mu Xuan had been lonely for millions of years. He was destined to be lonely for the rest of his life, just like Li Zheng. But he suddenly found a cub. This caused an imbalance for Li Zheng, pushing him into concocting a maniacal plan to kill her so Mu Xuan would feel the same pain he had felt.</p><br/><p>Eh\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

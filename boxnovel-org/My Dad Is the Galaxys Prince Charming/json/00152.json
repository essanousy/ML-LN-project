As expected of our boss, to be able to win just like that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it difficult to get this?\u201d Yao Si poked the screen.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course!\u201d Lu Chen nodded aggressively. \u201cRainbow Pond operates for two months annually with restricted operation timing and voucher sale. The earlier you get hold of the vouchers, the higher their price. Now should still be the early stages of their operations when the Rainbow Pond is the busiest, which makes getting a voucher an arduous feat! It isn\u2019t something you can get with just galactic currency.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Yao Si nodded. <em>I guess taking baths is unusual in the Galaxy?</em></p><br/><p>\u201cDear missus, may I know when you intend to visit the Rainbow Pond?\u201d The sales lady took a step forward, seeming much more polite than before as she advised a little frantically, \u201cOur shop has specially arranged a private aircraft for lucky customers, so you can take off right this instant. There are also additional services such as a temporary storage for your aircraft, free upgrading for your optical computer, etc. Should we head over right now?\u201d</p><br/><p>As expected of a luxury planet, even a free lucky draw could be so thoughtful.</p><br/><p>\u201cI would have to decline.\u201d Yao Si shook her head. \u201cI haven\u2019t traveled enough. If you like it, you can go instead!\u201d She sent the voucher over to Lu Chen.</p><br/><p>He froze, his entire being in shock. \u201cB-boss, you\u2019re really giving it to me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMmh.\u201d <em>Isn\u2019t it just a bath? It doesn\u2019t sound like much fun. </em></p><br/><p>\u201cBoss\u2026 you\u2019re actually gifting me with such a precious voucher?!\u201d Lu Chen was on the verge of tears. He rubbed his nose and tapped his chest. \u201cYou are the best boss in the entire Galaxy. Don\u2019t worry, I will cherish this voucher! From this day onwards, I will slave myself away for you, bringing in two times the profits from the Ore Planet!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>-_-|||</p><br/><p>Was that necessary? Wasn\u2019t it just a bath, or perhaps\u2026 she was normally stingy?</p><br/><p>\u201cBoss, do I have full authority over the voucher?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMmh.\u201d <em>Go have fun!</em></p><br/><p>\u201cThen\u2026\u201d His eyes lit up, suggesting cautiously, \u201cWhat do you think about selling it on the galactic web?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Yao Si.</p><br/><p>Didn\u2019t you mention cherishing it? How could you turn it into a moneymaking opportunity? The Yao sure are money-minded!</p><br/><p>(\u256f\u2035\u25a1\u2032)\u256f\ufe35\u253b\u2501\u253b</p><br/><p>\u201cThe price is unbelievably high right now, it\u2019s even higher than a month\u2019s profit of the Ore Planet!\u201d</p><br/><p>That was high!</p><br/><p>(\u2299 o \u2299)</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s half it!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDeal!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Mu Xuan.</p><br/><p>As they started to configure everything, the sales attendant paled. In a shrill voice, she started objecting, \u201cNo! No!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Yao Si stilled. Wasn\u2019t it her voucher already?</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause\u2026 because\u2026\u201d Her gaze started to falter, the polite facade cracking with hints of anxiety. \u201cBecause\u2026 only you are eligible for the use of the voucher! Besides, it\u2019s non-exchangeable and only valid today.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe voucher is named?\u201d Yao Si\u2019s heart chilled as her moneymaking opportunity died.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not right!\u201d Lu Chen turned toward his optical computer. \u201cIt\u2019s not written here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s indeed not indicated up there, but\u2026\u201d The sales attendant started to panic, pointing toward the lucky draw area that was already closed. \u201cAfter the initial scan, the information had already been sent over to Rainbow Pond\u2019s system so\u2026 only Her Hi\u2014 only this lady over here can utilize the voucher.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh\u2026\u201d Yao Si\u2019s initial displeasure took over. \u201cForget it, we\u2019re leaving!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYo-you\u2019re not going?\u201d The sales attendant\u2019s eyes went wide.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s only one voucher and it can\u2019t be transferred. What\u2019s the fun in going by myself?\u201d</p><br/><p>She tugged onto Mu Xuan and headed toward the exit. The sales attendant froze before rushing over to stop them. \u201cYou\u2026 don\u2019t go!\u201d The attendant\u2019s face seemed be much paler than before. \u201cHow about\u2026 How about you draw another two times? You might be able to win two more vouchers!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d <em>What? Didn\u2019t you say everyone only had one chance?</em></p><br/><p>\u201cTo award a group of three one ticket is indeed our fault, so we are willing to provide another two vouchers. You won\u2019t have to spend anymore, we will also increase the expiry date for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d <em>You can do that?</em></p><br/><p>\u201cHow about we increase it by three days? Or four?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Sis, can I ask you something? Erm\u2026 how many vouchers am I eligible for with the amount I spent just now?\u201d <em>Why else would the shop be embarrassed\u2026 to the point they\u2019re forcing freebies on her? </em></p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>After leaving the shop, Yao Si checked her galactic account several times to ensure that the row of zeros was still intact before she could heave a sigh of relief. Fortunately, she was rich enough to cushion her lavish ways.</p><br/><p>She had never much grasp of the galactic currency. When she had started learning about common knowledge, she would keep track by counting the number of zeros, but as the amount started to increase, she stopped bothering.</p><br/><p>Maybe she was just lucky.</p><br/><p>However, Yao Si soon started to have doubts about the strength of her luck.</p><br/><p>In the second store\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cCongratulations, you are the 100th customer today! You win a free voucher to the Rainbow Pond.\u201d</p><br/><p>In the third store\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cCongratulations, there\u2019s a special promotion for this item here, you will be given a free voucher to the Rainbow Pond.\u201d</p><br/><p>On the road\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cCongratulations, you stepped onto our store\u2019s lucky brick, you\u2019ll be given a voucher to the Rainbow Pond.\u201d</p><br/><p>When she sneezed\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cCongratulations, you filled my face with saliva\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Yao Si.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Mu Xuan.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Lu Chen.</p><br/><p>Did they enter the Rainbow Pond voucher hive? Why was everyone forcing a voucher onto her? Winning a voucher from stores was fine but how did she get one from just rubbing her eyes and sneezing?! Wasn\u2019t it supposed to be a rare fine?</p><br/><p>\u201cMu-Mu Xuan?\u201d The corners of Yao Si\u2019s lips twitched, and she turned to glance at him.</p><br/><p>What was happening, and why did it seem so weird? Did she suddenly awaken another weird ability? But she didn\u2019t sense the familiar surge within her?</p><br/><p>Mu Xuan caressed her head reassuringly while frowning. He seemed to have thought of something as he turned to Lu Chen. \u201cWhat\u2019s the race closest to this planet?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Chen stilled, not able to process the luck his boss was bestowed with. He turned on the map to take a look. \u201cThis is a public realm, but the closest race is\u2026 Lighting Sylvan.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mu Xuan\u2019s face darkened.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Before Yao Si could process his words, Mu Xuan had already grabbed onto her, heading out.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re leaving.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh? Why?\u201d</p><br/><p>Mu Xuan\u2019s face darkened as he pulled her toward their aircraft. \u201cIt\u2019s not safe here.\u201d F*ck, he had actually forgotten where the aves were from!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy\u2014 Eh, where\u2019s this fog coming from?\u201d Yao Si lifted her head. The clear road ahead had disappeared and was covered with a thick cloud of fog blanketing the surroundings. In an instant, they could barely see past two meters around themselves.</p><br/><p>What was this? The specialty of the Heavenly Planet?</p><br/><p>\u201cMu Xuan, this fog\u2026\u201d The moment Yao Si turned around, her palms were suddenly empty. There was only fog left by her side.</p><br/><p><em>Eh? Where are you?</em></p><br/><p>(\u2299_\u2299)</p></div>\n</div>"}

Even though his ability was strong, he wasn\u2019t able to defend against the uncontrollable influx of the small zombies. The strain caused the blood in his wounds to ooze out at a higher rate.</p><br/><p>As the rats stormed in, Qu Ze\u2019s entire being was drenched in blood. Only when his energy was totally expended did he stumble back onto the ground with a forced smile. He never had imagined that he would die in such a place and in such a manner. But he had managed to successfully send Her Highness away and activated the self-destruction mechanism. The infected creatures wouldn\u2019t be able to escape, and besides, he had already lived a long enough life.</p><br/><p>He took in a deep breath, preparing for the inexorable death that was considered as a joke among bloodlings. Perhaps he was really tired, for his vision started to darken as though a huge portal had just swallowed him up.</p><br/><p>Wait a minute! It wasn\u2019t an illusion, it was\u2026 the opening of a space portal!</p><br/><p>And that opening seemed to have come from him! It couldn\u2019t be, he didn\u2019t\u2026</p><br/><p>Before he could react, he felt himself lighten, a massive suction force enveloping him as he entered the portal. The next moment, his vision brightened as he fell face down from a height of two meters.</p><br/><p>His numb body was abused once more. He lay motionless on the ground, his face soaked with blood which had either flowed from his wounds or was newly inflicted by the prickly grass\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d <em>Am I still alive?</em></p><br/><p>\u201cElder!\u201d</p><br/><p>A familiar figure came rushing forward, supporting him up anxiously as worry clouded its gaze. Qu Ze had seen him before; he seemed to be Her Highness\u2019 little assistant. What was he called again?</p><br/><p><em>If he is here, it means\u2026</em></p><br/><p>Qu Ze stilled, his heart sinking. He struggled to turn his head. Indeed, Her Highness\u2019 familiar figure came into view. \u201cYour Highness, you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si ignored him, walking forward to rip his clothes open. \u201cBai Yi, stop the bleeding.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStop!\u201d Qu Ze was suddenly able to muster some strength and stumbled back. \u201cDon\u2019t touch me, I\u2019m infected by the virus. If you\u2019re not careful\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShut the f*ck up!\u201d Yao Si howled, subconsciously activating her bloodline suppression. <em>If you weren\u2019t injured, I would have already beaten you up! </em>\u201cI\u2019m now going to make two things clear: first, the virus is curable, and second, if you say another word, I\u2019ll disfigure you to the point your mom won\u2019t be able to recognize you anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qu Ze froze.</p><br/><p>He suddenly realized that\u2026 Her Highness could be quite scary at times!</p><br/><p>(\u2299_\u2299)</p><br/><p>Besides\u2026 he didn\u2019t have a mother?</p><br/><p>\u201cHow dare you not listen when your ancestor is speaking. Bai Yi, hurry!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh-oh! Okay.\u201d</p><br/><p>(\u2299_\u2299)</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d Bai Yi had a delayed reaction before retrieving a first aid kit filled with advanced equipment. But regardless of what he used, Qu Ze still seemed\u2026 broken, blood pouring out of him endlessly. \u201cThere is no way to stop the bleeding, Your Highness\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTie up all the wounds.\u201d If technology wasn\u2019t able to save him, they could just go back to the prehistoric methods.</p><br/><p>\u201cTie\u2026 with what?\u201d Bai Yi asked in confusion.</p><br/><p>Yao Si glanced at the first aid kit. <em>F*ck! </em>The Galaxy had deemed \u2018bandage\u2019, one of the most basic and essential medical aid items, as unnecessary.</p><br/><p>There wasn\u2019t any other choice. She picked up a scalpel and cut Bai Yi\u2019s sleeve off. \u201cLet me borrow your sleeve for a moment!\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Yi stiffened\u2026 <em>You can do that?!</em></p><br/><p>Yao Si didn\u2019t waste time explaining. She used the sleeve to tightly wrap Qu Ze\u2019s wounds, but there were far too many of them, his whole body was bitten and scratched by the rats. If he wasn\u2019t a bloodling, he would have been killed by the injuries long ago.</p><br/><p>Yao Si didn\u2019t have any medical experience. All she knew was to exert strength and tighten the bandage around the wounds. There was a high standard of living in the Galaxy, so any random clothing was of high quality, similar to the bandage used by doctors.</p><br/><p>The field was filled with the sound of cloth being ripped.</p><br/><p>Yao Si seemed to be getting better at bandaging as she gradually increased her speed. Initially, Bai Yi felt rather awkward, but as she continued to rip his shirt, he started to\u2026 get used to it, even volunteering some cloth himself.</p><br/><p>After ripping another strip, Yao Si wrapped another inch of Qu Ze. Then the ripping and wrapping went on\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Highness!\u201d Bai Yi held onto her arm. His face scrunched up as he reminded her weakly, \u201cStop ripping\u2026 It\u2019s all gone.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Yao Si turned, and the young man\u2019s almost naked form came into her sight. Slowly, she retrieved her hands that were on their way to his boxers. Eh\u2026 it was her first time bandaging someone. Without much experience, this was\u2026 understandable?</p><br/><p>She turned her gaze back to Qu Ze. He was knocked out from the doomsday virus that had started spreading through his body\u2026 Thankfully the bleeding had stopped.</p><br/><p>The next part of the plan was to wait for dinner time to arrive.</p><br/><p>Once it was dinner time, Mu Xuan punctually showed up to get her. He saw his cub drenched in blood as she sat obediently on a grass field waving enthusiastically at him, with a half-naked Bai Yi on one side and a\u2026 zombie on the other?</p><br/><p>Which brave soul was going to explain what had happened?</p><br/><p>He suddenly had an impulse to spank his cub!</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>The next time Qu Ze opened his eyes, Yao Si was glaring at him just like how she always glared whenever he had angered her.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Highness?\u201d He froze, then proceeded to ask a dumb question. \u201cYou\u2019re dead too?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPssh!\u201d Yao Si rolled her eyes. \u201cEven you aren\u2019t dead, so how could I be dead?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe virus has been removed.\u201d Mu Xuan sent him a chilling glance at him before caressing his cub\u2019s head. \u201cYou aren\u2019t dead.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour\u2026 Your Majesty!\u201d Qu Ze froze, analyzing the situation. The burning sensation from the virus was gone, and he was really alive! Her Highness hadn\u2019t been lying after all. It hadn\u2019t been a white lie to comfort him; there was indeed a cure to the virus.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan you talk now?\u201d Yao Si moved two chairs closer and pulled Mu Xuan over. After taking in a deep breath, she turned toward the patient. \u201cHow much do you know about Euphoria? And what exactly was going on at that research base?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qu Ze frowned as an unpleasant thought hit him. After half a second, he broke into a smile. \u201cYour Highness, don\u2019t worry. Since I\u2019m still alive, I\u2019ll naturally tell everything to both you and His Majesty. Just that\u2026\u201d He lifted his tightly bound limbs. \u201cYour Highness, could you untie me first? Why did you wrap me up to this extent?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHeh\u2026\u201d Should she tell him that she totally forgot to change the bandages after coming back? He\u2019d been wrapped up in that one for probably seven\u2026 eight\u2026 or was it nine days?</p><br/><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t fully recovered. Keep it on!\u201d Mu Xuan commanded seriously when he sensed her hesitation.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Qu Ze nodded obediently, his eyes brightening. It seemed that it was the kind of virus that required the patient to be completely wrapped up!</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Yao Si.</p><br/><p>He really believed that?! Mu Xuan didn\u2019t have fans, but rather a cult!</p><br/><p>Qu Ze struggled to sit straight with his mummified body. After taking in a deep breath, he explained everything he knew.</p><br/><p>It was similar to what Yao Si had imagined. Euphoria wasn\u2019t just a large scale organization, but had deeply integrated itself into the Galaxy. Qu Ze said that before the formation of the alliances, there was already a force against the bloodlings.</p><br/><p>But he wasn\u2019t able to decipher the source since there were traces of participation from every race. At the start, they were extremely secretive. When he discovered a few of them and had them eliminated, contrary to his expectations, the force seemed to have strengthened. They began to conduct their operations more openly, and he found out that it wasn\u2019t just other races, even bloodlings were a part of that organization.</p><br/><p>\u201cI raised this issue to Elders Council many years ago.\u201d He laughed. \u201cAt that time, His Majesty was still in hibernation. Even though Elders Council believed me, all of its investigations were unsuccessful, so I decided to take matters into my own hands\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si went still as she realized something, and she leveled a suspicious glance at him.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026 created so much havoc in the Galaxy because of the organization?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Highness, you\u2019re a genius!\u201d He laughed and said nonchalantly, \u201cIn the past, their operations were all carried out in secrecy, but with a lot of effort, I managed to drag them out.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d <em>By angering everyone? This guy is indeed a weird one.</em></p><br/><p>Yao Si didn\u2019t know how to respond. She had initially assumed his hateful ways were just a part of his personality, but now she realized that his actions were all for the bloodlings. The contrast was too drastic; she needed time to wrap her head around it.</p><br/><p>\u201cGradually, I realized that they had infiltrated the Galaxy much deeper than I had predicted. Even the Heavenly Bestowed Yard\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFourth Elder!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, initially I was only aware of their research operations which bore an uncanny resemblance to the research being carried out in the Heavenly Bestowed Yard. Thus, they would seek out newly born cubs, but I would have never guessed that it was to come up with a virus that would target bloodlings.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si was startled. \u201cWas that why you treated me like that when I just reached the red planet?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my fault.\u201d He seemed apologetic. \u201cAt that time, His Majesty was still in hibernation, so I assumed that such a sudden appearance of a fifth-generation bloodling had to do with the organization\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p><em>So that\u2019s the reason behind the resistance against me? </em>Yao Si could feel herself stiffening.</p><br/><p>\u201cI never expected you to actually be His Majesty\u2019s cub.\u201d He broke into laughter, then swiftly changed the topic. \u201cHis Majesty must have detected the organization\u2019s actions to have exiled me to Nirvana! When I realized that they have been collecting Earthling genes, I assumed that their base would be in a planet like Lighting Sylvan whose condition is similar to that of the Blue Planet.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si couldn\u2019t help glancing over at Mu Xuan. In a low voice, she asked, \u201cYou did that on purpose?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Mu Xuan. He wanted to ask that as well.</p><br/><p>Yao Si silently lit a candle for Qu Ze\u2019s self-delusion regarding his idol\u2019s big heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey have been rather active recently, even successfully coming up with this virus. There might be more frightening things in progress, though. I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll act again.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si nodded, expressing her agreement. \u201cSince Fourth Elder entered eternal hibernation, we can\u2019t be sure if there are any other traitors. I think there\u2019s a need to inform the entire race to be on guard.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, not the entire race. Just you, Your Highness!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMe?\u201d <em>What do you mean?</em></p><br/><p>\u201cYour Highness, don\u2019t you know?\u201d His eyes went wide. \u201cAll the recent operations by Euphoria are against you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p><em>What?!</em></p><br/><p>Before she could react, a loud noise came from outside. The ground started to shake as though the whole world was trembling.</p><br/><p><em>What\u2019s happening now?!</em></p></div>\n</div>"}

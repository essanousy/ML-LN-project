When she woke up, she felt as though she had just finished a marathon. She felt fatigued and restless, but none of it mattered.</p><br/><p>She had an ability!</p><br/><p>Ha ha ha ha ha ha\u2026</p><br/><p>She was no longer a weakling among the bloodlings. Even though the water series was one of the weaker ones, it was better than not having any ability. Besides, even though the bloodlings were immortal, it sucked to only be able to get beaten without having an ability to fight back.</p><br/><p>Yao Si decided to hone her skills and recalled all the books Mu Xuan had arranged for her regarding abilities. Afterwards, she started to recap the initial feeling, trying to feel the energy within her.</p><br/><p>But\u2026</p><br/><p>After an hour\u2026</p><br/><p><em>Mmh, since it just awakened, I\u2019m not very familiar with the technique.</em></p><br/><p>After two hours\u2026</p><br/><p><em>Mmh, maybe I\u2019m not doing it right, time to change the technique.</em></p><br/><p>After three hours\u2026</p><br/><p><em>Mmh, maybe I haven\u2019t read enough, time to study more.</em></p><br/><p>After five hours\u2026</p><br/><p><em>Fu*ck, why can\u2019t I feel anything? Hadn\u2019t my ability awakened!</em></p><br/><p>\u201cSisi.\u201d Mu Xuan couldn\u2019t bear to look any longer. He pulled her up onto a chair with disagreement on his face. \u201cHave your meal first!\u201d She had been sitting there motionless for the entire day. Even if it was urgent, she needed to eat.</p><br/><p>\u201cDad\u2026\u201d Yao Si felt a strong urge to cry.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot dad.\u201d Mu Xuan frowned, hating the term. \u201cUse my name.\u201d Blood relations didn\u2019t exist among bloodlings. Father was just a respectful term for a child to call their mentor, but somehow his child had misunderstood, imagining him as her real father.</p><br/><p>In the beginning, he didn\u2019t seem to mind, but right now, he couldn\u2019t seem to accept it.</p><br/><p>\u201cMu Xuan\u2026\u201d Yao Si tugged on his clothes, sobbing sadly. \u201cWas I dreaming? My ability awakened, right? Back when we were at Eternal Brightness, you saw me summon water\u2026 Is my ability the water series?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMmh.\u201d When her ability had erupted, it almost drowned the entire city.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen why can\u2019t I feel anything?\u201d Her method wasn\u2019t wrong. She had already confirmed multiple times, but somehow her body felt empty, bearing no resemblance to the information in the books describing how it should feel. \u201cI\u2019ve been trying the entire day!\u201d</p><br/><p>Mu Xuan brought her a bowl of blood nourishing soup, then glanced at her face. She was on the verge of breaking down, and so he moved to pass the bowl over. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, it was just the first time you summoned your ability. Since you\u2019ve exhausted yourself so thoroughly, it must have not returned to its normal state.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou mean the energy released was too great and I haven\u2019t recovered?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMmh.\u201d He nodded, then noticed that she remained motionless and rushed her. \u201cHurry and eat, you\u2019re still recovering.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d <em>So abilities need to rest as well </em>. Yao Si hurriedly downed the entire blood nourishing soup at a go, passing the empty bowl back. \u201cI want seconds!\u201d She wanted everything that could recuperate her strength.</p><br/><p>Wasn\u2019t it just taking a break? It would recover in a while.</p><br/><p>But it never dawned on her that the wait might go on for three whole months. The entire time, regardless of what method she tested, she still wasn\u2019t able to feel any change within herself.</p><br/><p>Yao Si started to sink into despair, was there something wrong with her blood? Like maybe her genes had degenerated? But Elders were strongly against her assumption. They often repeated to her that gene degeneration could only be found in the lastests generations, how could it happen to a fifth generation bloodling like herself! This was a few hundred generation gap after all!</p><br/><p>It made so much sense she couldn\u2019t refute anything.</p><br/><p>Yao Qian suggested that she sought Mu Xuan\u2019s advise, but Mu Xuan seemed to be busy the whole time. Even if she wanted to discuss it with him, he wasn\u2019t around.</p><br/><p>When she thought back to the first time he had tested her ability, he seemed to have mentioned that she had a unique one, but she was convinced that it belonged to the water series. How then could it be special? Or had he been trying to hint at how it was a one time thing?</p><br/><p>o(&gt;\ufe4f&lt;)o</p><br/><p>This was worrying indeed.</p><br/><p>Yao Si tossed and turned a few rounds, but still wasn\u2019t able to process the problem, so she lay wide awake. But just as she was about to revisit her books, she heard the door creaking open.</p><br/><p><em>Mu Xuan is back?</em></p><br/><p>Yao Si hurried to the door in excitement, but just as she was about to call out, she heard an unfamiliar voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cLao Er, do we just enter through the main door, what if someone finds out?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s there to be afraid of?\u201d another person scoffed. \u201cLao San, you have no guts. We\u2019ve entered so many houses the past few days, there was not a soul in any of them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYea\u2026 But this is the Red Planet,\u201d Lao San said with obvious hesitation.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the deal with the Red planet?\u201d Lao San retorted. \u201cDidn\u2019t we receive news that the bloodlings are dealing with the galactic pirates and won\u2019t be back so soon? There can\u2019t be many of them left here, so it\u2019s the best time for us. For our trade, isn\u2019t any location the same.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut they are the bloodlings!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t we take what belongs to bloodlings?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you hadn\u2019t drank so much, your senses wouldn\u2019t have gone out of control and that wouldn\u2019t have affected Lao Da\u2019s ability, causing us to return to the Red Planet.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t on purpose, besides, it\u2019s not like you didn\u2019t get any benefits. If you\u2019re so scared, return me your share and scram.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEnough!\u201d Just before a fight broke up, the third figure interrupted them in a hostile voice. \u201cWhat are you two arguing about now? Lao Er is right, the most dangerous place is the safest. These bloodling demons have been living for such a long time, I\u2019m sure they accumulated countless fortunes they they can no longer keep track of. Just a tiny amount will be enough for us to set ourselves up for the rest of our lives. As long as you guys learn to restrain yourselves and ensure that we leave no obvious tracks, they won\u2019t notice.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo worries, I\u2019ve been monitoring this house for the entire day, there hasn\u2019t been any activity so far. I\u2019m sure everything will be fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe can never be too sure,\u201d the third person continued to instruct coldly. \u201cLao Er, check the security code once more, see if there has been any automatic police alarm. Hack into the owner\u2019s Alliance bank account while you\u2019re at it as well. Lao San, take a look around to ensure there aren\u2019t any traps. Nothing can go wrong tonight.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so thoughtful, Lao Da.\u201d Lao Er laughed cheekily.</p><br/><p>\u201cStop your boot-licking and hurry up.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Lao Da!\u201d the two replied in unison, heading off in two different directions.</p><br/><p>Yao Si who was listening in silent the entire time.</p><br/><p><em>Am I really encountering burglars right after I faced a kidnapper? </em> Her insane bad luck sparked a burst of laughter within her.</p><br/><p>\u201cLao Da! An- An antique! Hurry, everything inside here are antiques from the ancient Blue Planet!\u201d Lao San exclaimed, hugging a flower vase. \u201cWow, which tycoon stays here? He actually uses\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI stay here!\u201d After sending out an mail to Yao Qian, Yao Si switched on all the lights.</p><br/><p>The house lit up instantly.</p><br/><p>The three burglars turned around instinctively, freezing in their positions.</p><br/><p>The house sank into silence!</p>\n</div>"}

At the time, she had assumed that this title referred to how everyone named those without a cub. But it\u2026 had the same meaning as back on Earth?</p><br/><p>She and Mu Xuan\u2026</p><br/><p>Her heart started racing.</p><br/><p>No, no, no! There had to be something she had missed; she clearly treated and respected him as her father.</p><br/><p>It was comparable to her biological father\u2026 Probably?</p><br/><p>While taking in a deep breath, Yao Si shook her head. She tried to calm herself and reanalyze the situation. As she did so, she discovered a suspicious point.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not right! According to what you said, isn\u2019t the total number of bloodlings fixed?\u201d She clearly recalled Yan Xuan mentioning that there were currently millions of bloodlings, with around three thousand in each generation. \u201cIf the cubs all end up with their guide, what about the cubs of the cub?\u201d</p><br/><p>For instance, if the first generation ended up with the second generation, then what about the third generation? Did the second generation end up with the third generation or with the first?</p><br/><p>\u201cEh? Your Highness, don\u2019t you know?\u201d Bai Yi asked with curiosity as he glanced her up and down, his mouth cramping as though suppressing the urge to break into a displeased expression. \u201cThat\u2019s because cubs are divided into initial holders and those that are inherited. Both me and Shucheng are both part of the latter.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Yi coughed twice, before explaining a kindergarten level common knowledge that she seemed to have completely missed out on.</p><br/><p>There was a special bond between bloodlings and their cubs; thus, the loyalty between couples was extremely high. This meant that in a bloodling\u2019s life, the would only develop feelings for one they had converted or the person that had converted them. Bloodlings that were already attached to someone were not allowed to posses another earthling as it was considered a form of betrayal to their partner. The only exception was when a partner had passed on due to an incident.</p><br/><p>This was the reason why bloodlings stationed on Earth in the past were not willing to expose their identities. It was only during the doomsday period when the situation had changed.</p><br/><p>However, ever since they entered the Galactic age, many of the bloodlings were already attached and were not willing to convert new cubs without the threat of the virus. The bloodling population then became so little that it reached a state of negative growth.</p><br/><p>This was until the exchange inheritance method appeared.</p><br/><p>If a bloodling was not willing to be tied down by a cub, they could choose the exchange inheritance method for conversion. The bloodling would have to transfuse half of their blood into an earthling\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>The converted earthling would then not be reliant on the one that converted them and the both of them would not have any bloodline bond. This method allowed the convertee to keep a portion of the convertor\u2019s memory. Bai Yi added that this memory was different from genetic memory, since it would be permanent. This memory was the reason the convertee would not experience a young cub\u2019s period, automatically becoming an adult bloodling who possessed all the common knowledge. However, this adult bloodling would still have to train their abilities.</p><br/><p>The converted Earthling would not have much interaction with the older generation of bloodlings, both parties treating each other as friends. Strictly speaking, a converted Earthling would not have a guider. The convertor would just briefly provide guidance to the convertee, until the convertee properly adapted to the society. This was the reason Gu Shucheng and Luo Ying were inseparable while Bai Yi forever alone.</p><br/><p>Both Gu Shucheng and Bai Yi belonged to the same generation and were both converted Earthlings, while Luo Ying belonged to the generation right after them. She was a cub that had been converted by Gu Shucheng.</p><br/><p>Basically\u2026 ever since Yao Si had awakened, no wait! Ever since the day she was converted, she had mistaken the following terms:</p><br/><p>First, \u2018single dogs\u2019, which actually referred to singles that were not attached.</p><br/><p>Second, \u2018father\u2019, which wasn\u2019t a term for a fatherly figure, but a senior, someone older\u2026</p><br/><p>Mu Xuan was apparently her\u2026</p><br/><p>\u25cb|\uffe3|_</p><br/><p>Who exactly came up with such a misleading term? One could easily be confused!</p><br/><p>She could feel the world in front of her start to crumble into pieces; she wasn\u2019t feeling well!</p><br/><p>Where was the promised pure father-daughter relationship?</p><br/><p>Mu Xuan had amazing credentials: he was rich, had high status and social standing as well as horrifyingly strong abilities, was considered a male god of the Galaxy, treated her well to the point that he would pluck the stars if she wanted them, looked good with clothes and without\u2026 Erm, even though she hadn\u2019t seen it before, but it would definitely nourish her eyes. She was sure she\u2019d be blessed in the future\u2026</p><br/><p>Peesh! Stop! Stop! What rubbish image is running around in my mind? Regardless of the bloodling tradition, she had always considered and respected him as her father.</p><br/><p>As a respectable young girl she was pure. So stop such impure thoughts!</p><br/><p>F**k, why is my face burning.</p><br/><p>And why is my heart racing?</p><br/><p>I just want my peace!</p><br/><p>\u25cb|\uffe3|_</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you sitting here?\u201d</p><br/><p>She felt the weight of a hand fall onto her head.</p><br/><p>Yao Si was caught off guard and jolted upwards onto the back of the sofa. \u201cMu-Mu-Mu-Mu Xuan.\u201d F*ck, when did you come back, why didn\u2019t I notice anything?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d His face fell from her reaction. Extending his hand, he pulled her toward him with a worried expression. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo-nothing. Wh-What\u2019s wrong?\u201d She scrambled backwards instinctively.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome over.\u201d His expression grew increasingly more worried, and his brows furrowed as he grabbed her.</p><br/><p>\u201cW-w-wait, no\u2014!</p><br/><p>Before she could finish her protest, her body was pulled forward, and her head smashed into his embrace. His arms circled tightly around her waist. She tried to pull back instinctively, but he leaned over abruptly, trapping her between the sofa and himself.</p><br/><p>\u201cStop moving,\u201d he instructed before leaning down toward her face.</p><br/><p>As the familiar face magnified, Yao Si started to feel increasingly more troubled and perplexed. Her mind exploded into bits, a buzzing engulfing her.</p><br/><p>Mu Xuan gently placed his forehead onto hers, their faces so close she could feel his breath. At that moment, they seemed like one entity.</p><br/><p>Yao Si\u2019s racing heart sped up even more.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re fine?\u201d Mu Xuan felt her temperature for a little longer before raising a suspicious gaze toward her. \u201cAre you feeling unwell?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si stilled, and as he distanced himself, her energy left her. For a moment, she was in a daze, but her racing heart soon snapped back to normal \u2013 he had been just trying to check on her health.</p><br/><p>In the past, Mu Xuan had done this often, checking her health in this manner, but she had always found it normal, similar to how doctors stuck a thermometer at her. Only now did she sense something from the action.</p><br/><p>It seemed\u2026 too close.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid someone come by today?\u201d Mu Xuan asked when he saw her still in a daze. His cub seemed a little weird. She was too\u2026 obedient.</p><br/><p>\u201cYea\u2026Yes!\u201d Yao Si straightened up, pushing the person in front of her away and passing the red wedding invitation over to him before stumbling back anxiously. \u201cLuo-Luo Ying came.\u201d Yao Si had to control herself! She could do this!</p><br/><p>The sudden distance placed a frown on Mu Xuan\u2019s face, and he seemed displeased, but he reached over to open the wedding invitation, giving it a quick once over.</p><br/><p>\u201cNext weekend?\u201d He glanced at the calender. \u201cAlright, I\u2019ll go with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si glanced up at his expression gingerly, but he was calm, a stark contrast to her initial shock. It was as though he had expected this. She couldn\u2019t help asking, \u201cYou\u2026 Aren\u2019t you shocked?\u201d</p><br/><p>He had a strange look when he looked over at her, before replying honestly, \u201cThose two\u2026 It\u2019s about time.\u201d</p><br/><p>He had scrutinized the data of all the bloodlings in the academy long before she had entered. Compared to the other bloodlings, those two were considered slow. It was probably due to the recent incident? The fear of losing a cub must have been too much for that youth, since it wasn\u2019t an experience that anyone could handle.</p><br/><p>Mu Xuan pinched the wedding invitation, and rare amusement brightened in his eyes. \u201cWedding invitations are all made from the prehistoric paper from Earth. I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll be a boisterous occasion.\u201d</p><br/><p>Due to the small population, a blessing was given to the union of every couple. Except from\u2026 single dogs! In the past, he hated attending such events, but times had changed and he had finally left the \u2018single dog\u2019 title behind.</p><br/><p>He glanced down at his cub who was in a daze, and a familiar tenderness washed over him. This was an emotion that he only started experiencing in the past two years. Reaching down, he caressed her head lovingly. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll give you an even grander affair.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mu Xuan\u2019s words were tender and soft, causing Yao Si\u2019s heart to race once more, and her mind exploded into fireworks. Even though those words weren\u2019t really special, her mind blanked out, her sanity leaving for a vacation.</p><br/><p>If Mu Xuan had said it before, she would have assumed it was a blessing from a father to his daughter, with the emphasis on a grand occasion. But after Bai Yi\u2019s quick lesson, she realized that the emphasis was on \u2013 \u2018I\u2019ll give you\u2019.</p><br/><p>He\u2026 was serious.</p><br/><p>Miraculously, her heart started to calm.</p><br/><p>\u201cMu Xuan\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMmh.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAm I really the cub you converted?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you sure you didn\u2019t get the wrong person?\u201d she couldn\u2019t help asking. For conversion, blood exchange was necessary, but she was certain that she had never met Mu Xuan before she went into hibernation. \u201cDidn\u2019t you say you forgot how you converted me? I can\u2019t remember it either. Is it possible that it wasn\u2019t a conversion but an exchange of inheritance. Is it possible that\u2026\u201d I\u2019m not the one you\u2019re looking for\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course not!\u201d he replied adamantly. \u201cWe are connect by the bloodline, you\u2019re definitely my sole heir.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

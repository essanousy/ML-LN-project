The entire room lit up, and the light turned into a wide glowing blanket which crashed down on them.</p><br/><p>Just as it was about to engulf them, the exhausted Luo Ying staggered forward. A spark ignited between her palms, and a bolt of light pierced through the skies, splitting the glowing blanket into a hundred pieces, some of which flew at her.</p><br/><p>\u201cBe careful!\u201d Yao Si pulled onto Luo Ying, dragging her back, but it was too late, several rays had already landed on her.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh!\u201d she shrieked as her skin broke apart and blood covered her entire arm.</p><br/><p>\u201cLuo Ying!\u201d Yao Si held onto her.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Bai Yi glanced at her arm anxiously. \u201cCan\u2019t you heal it automatically?\u201d</p><br/><p>Luo Ying was growing pale. Blood kept pouring out of her arm like from an open tap which they had no means of shutting. Yet based on a bloodlings\u2019 healing ability, it wasn\u2019t possible to bleed for so long.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you have the lighting ability.\u201d Mr Lu smirked, glancing over at Luo Ying. \u201cA good specimen indeed, I haven\u2019t met any lighting ability users thus far. But\u2026\u201d He squinted his eyes, and a mocking glint clouded his gaze. \u201cYou haven\u2019t experienced the full wrath of my research yet. What you\u2019ve seen so far is merely the appetizer.\u201d</p><br/><p>That glow had been to reduce the healing speed!</p><br/><p>Yao Si froze. Even though she had already guessed the subject of the experiments, she had never expected them to have come so far. They could actually suppress the bloodlings\u2019 natural healing ability! It meant that the research must have gone on for quite some time. Wouldn\u2019t that be a warning sign that they\u2019ll have more tricks up their sleeves?</p><br/><p>\u201cWho exactly are you? What are you planning to do?\u201d Bai Yi snarled with rage and a hint of worry, his eyes a bloody shade of red!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat I\u2019m planning?\u201d Mr. Lu scoffed. \u201cYou\u2019re about to find out.\u201d He glanced down at his optical computer and nodded several times before adding nonchalantly, \u201cThe lightning ability is indeed a tough one, but I wonder how she will fare against the other abilities?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Yao Si\u2019s heart clenched.</p><br/><p>With a wave of his hand, the crowd at the back moved, encapsulating them. Those people didn\u2019t seem to have souls, for their gazes were unfocused and they moved liked zombies when coming closer.</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior Hao?\u201d Bai Yi\u2019s eyes went wide from shock and disbelief. He then scanned the crowd more carefully. \u201cWhy is he here, didn\u2019t he graduate five years ago\u2026\u201d He paused abruptly, a cold shiver running down his spine. \u201cThe-they\u2019re all bloodlings, you\u2019re controlling them!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWow, you could tell? It\u2019s a pity the revelation came too late.\u201d Mr Lu smirked and asjusted his collar. With a sharp glare, he shouted out, \u201cLeave only the bloodling with lightning ability!\u201d</p><br/><p>The bloodlings in the crowd seemed to have been triggered to act, for the skies lit up with a myriad of abilities directing towards the trio and their captive.</p><br/><p>Bai Yi pushed Yao Si and Luo Ying behind himself, shouting at them, \u201cHurry, leave this place! I\u2019ll shield yo\u2014\u201d</p><br/><p>Before he could finish his sentence, Yao Si took a large step in front of him. \u201cStop putting on a strong front! Back off, weakling!\u201d</p><br/><p>A familiar surge of energy gushed through her, flowing towards her chest, and with a swing of her palms, the energy poured out.</p><br/><p>A firewall of a few meters high formed in front of her, defending them against the sky full of abilities. Gradually, their aftereffects fell to the ground, sending the entire research base into a fiery field.</p><br/><p>The product of her ability appeased Yao Si enormously. Her one year intensive training on the Red Planet hadn\u2019t been a child\u2019s play. As long as somebody showed their ability, she was invincible!</p><br/><p>\u201cYou-you\u2019re from the fire series\u2026\u201d A different emotion entered the man\u2019s face in place of disgust. \u201cIt can\u2019t be, you\u2019re just a student, how can you possess such a strong fire ability\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Before his sentence could end, Yao Si rotated her palms toward the ground. Thousands of thorns came from beneath the firewall, rushing towards the zombiefied bloodlings.</p><br/><p>Even though these bloodlings\u2019 abilities weren\u2019t as strong as those of her training partners, they were a large crowd, a couple times the size of her practice groups. To fend off so many people was exhausting even for her, yet she continuously switched around the various abilities, controlling her attacks so as to not harm anyone.</p><br/><p>\u201cWater ability, fire ability\u2026 even lightning ability. No, this can\u2019t be possible, how can someone possess so many abilities?\u201d Mr. Lu\u2019s eyes were wide from disbelief.</p><br/><p>\u201cPresident\u2026\u201d Bai Yi was thoroughly confused as well. President\u2026 had upgraded?</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha\u2026 Five series, you must have the complete range of abilities.\u201d Mr. Lu had on a maniacal smile on his face, and his eyes were unusually bright at this moment. He looked like a madman. \u201cGreat, great! You\u2019ll be such a valuable specimen.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck your research!\u201d Yao Si controlled the ability within her body, and with a wave of her hand, a black light flew out. A portal closed at the spot a black knife had appeared, then vanished into thin air.</p><br/><p>\u201cSpace splitting, you can actually do that, too!\u201d Pervert Lu grew increasingly more hysterical. He swiftly lowered his head and started to type on his optical computer. \u201cRegardless of your identity, don\u2019t dream of leaving this base!\u201d</p><br/><p>The next moment, a deafening sound rang out from somewhere, and the zombiefied bloodlings knelt down in immense pain. They grabbed onto their heads, and shrill cries filled the air.</p><br/><p>\u201cWha-what\u2019s happening?\u201d Bai Yi looked around in confusion.</p><br/><p>An ominous feeling entered Yao Si\u2019s heart. Suddenly, all the bloodlings stood up as though triggered by an extreme force. Their eyes were bright red, and they attacked maniacally, without care for anything. Multiple abilities rushed straight for Yao Si.</p><br/><p>Since they were just puppets without a soul, they were attacking her with all their being. She could hold them off at first, but gradually, she started to feel exhaustion creeping up on her. Those people were from her race, so she couldn\u2019t just kill them. Especially now when they couldn\u2019t heal themselves. If she hurt them, they would just die while hypnotized and unable to do anything about it.</p><br/><p>What should she do?</p><br/><p>As she warded off their attacks, she scoured her mind for a solution. Right then, a shrill cry pierced the air.</p><br/><p>\u201cAhh!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBai Yi!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si\u2019s heart clenched as Bai Yi collapsed onto the ground with his hands over his head. She instantly formed a solid wall of fire, protecting them from the crowd ahead.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI-I\u2019m fine.\u201d Bai Yi\u2019s forehead was soaked in sweat, and as he struggle to rise, he seemed as if he was suppressing something in his mind. Panting uncontrollably, he stammered out, \u201cI-I read their thoughts.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did you see?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPain\u2026 An intense, heart wrenching kind of pain.\u201d His face paled, and the memory of the image sent his hands trembling.</p><br/><p>Pain? Yao Si stilled. Suppressing the power within her, she turned toward the bloodlings that were trying to overcome the firewall. The words above their heads were strangely few in number but shocking to uphold.</p><br/><p>[Ripping the heart 688 times]</p><br/><p>[Amputation 465 times]</p><br/><p>[Digging eyes 980 times]</p><br/><p>[Shifting the organs 591 times]</p><br/><p>\u201cPresident\u2026 they aren\u2019t being controlled. The pain from the experiments was simply too intense, and their mind\u2019s collapsed, shielding them in.\u201d</p><br/><p>This was what Lu had meant about retrieving resources\u2026</p><br/><p>Anger blazed within Yao Si, spilling over into her entire being. She trembled in fury, and for the first time, she was filled with a desire to kill.</p><br/><p>\u201cLu, in the name of bloodlings, I\u2019m going to kill you!\u201d</p>\n</div>"}

In the past, with just a thought, the energy would force its way out, but now, it suddenly went still. Regardless of how she guided it, there wasn\u2019t a bit of reaction. On top of that, the energy was surprisingly limited in strength.</p><br/><p>After a few tries, Yao Si finally gave up, turning to look at Nephew Gu expectantly.</p><br/><p>After about five minutes, he finally opened his eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow is it, how is it?\u201d Bai Yi turned to look impatiently. \u201cDid you see it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI saw it!\u201d He nodded with an odd expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cHurry and tell us, what did you see?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 I saw the score for you finals \u2013 25 marks.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Bai Yi froze. \u201cWhy are you looking at that?\u201d He\u2019d already had a hunch on how he\u2019d fared\u2026 \u201cTry it again, try it again!\u201d</p><br/><p>The second try\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cI see it!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHurry and tell us, what did you see?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou lost the bet with Yu Xiang for the signed robot!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The third try..</p><br/><p>\u201cHave you seen it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThree days later, you will be bitten by your neighbor\u2019s pet.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The fourth try\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it this time?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLater, when you go out, you\u2019ll fall into the drain\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The fifth try\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI saw you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEnough!\u201d Bai Yi was clearly irritated. \u201cWhy do you keep harping about my future?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI told you, I can\u2019t control what I see.\u201d Nephew Gu sighed, waving his hands dismissively</p><br/><p>\u201cForget it, forget it\u2026\u201d Yao Si headed forward, slightly depressed, interrupting their bickering. \u201cIt\u2019s fine even if we didn\u2019t find any clues, it was worth a shot.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Highness, I\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s due to my incompetence,\u201d Nephew Gu apologized, his face drowned in guilt.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you saying! It isn\u2019t your fault,\u201d Yao said, patting his shoulder. \u201cBesides, even if you had seen Yuan Han\u2019s future, it would have just increased the chances of finding him, not that he\u2019d just fall from the sky\u2026 Hey, what\u2019s that in the clouds?\u201d</p><br/><p>The blue glow grew larger, rapidly flying toward them, while the bellowing of winds was all the three could hear.</p><br/><p>\u201cBe careful!\u2019 Luo Ying shouted in warning, pulling them away.</p><br/><p>The next moment, the area that they had been standing in exploded, forming a massive dent, couple meters deep. A black robot that was about three people high appeared before the three of them.</p><br/><p>\u201cYuan Han!\u201d</p><br/><p>F*ck, she had hit the jackpot \u2013 he really came falling from the skies!</p><br/><p>\u201cYou three despicable bloodlings are indeed here,\u201d Yuan Han\u2019s familiar voice came from within the black robot, his voice soaked with hatred and fury. The robot\u2019s right hand held onto a blue scythe, with it aimed in their direction with a frosty glare. \u201d Hmph. Today, I will avenge myself.\u201d</p><br/><p>He flung the scythe in his hands, dashing straight at Yao Si.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Highness!\u201d Luo Ying shouted, bolting forward while summoning her lighting. A blinding glow erupted as countless rays of light rushed toward Han Yuan.</p><br/><p>Yao Si was genuinely alarmed by his sudden appearance. She then silently mourned his lack of intelligence.</p><br/><p>This guy wasn\u2019t crazy, so he had to be brainless! Wasn\u2019t he aware of his current predicament \u2013 wanted by the entire Galaxy? Shouldn\u2019t he be in hiding instead of seeking her out for revenge?</p><br/><p>\u201cNephew Gu, inform the Elder Council, hurry!\u201d Yao Si turned to instruct Gu Shucheng.</p><br/><p>\u201cAll right!\u201d He stilled slightly before quickly regaining his senses. Switching on his optical computer, he hurriedly sent out several messages.</p><br/><p>Even though they weren\u2019t in the Red Planet, with its technology, backup troops would arrive in less than five minutes. Luo Ying would just have to persevere for five minutes\u2026</p><br/><p>A deafening rumble erupted.</p><br/><p>The scythe in the robot\u2019s arms shot a blue ray which headed straight for Luo Ying. It penetrated the lightning net, and the great force of the attack blasted her to the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cYing!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLuo Ying Sis!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLuo Ying!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si\u2019s heart contracted. How could this be? The robot had clearly been unable to withstand Luo Ying\u2019s lighting attack before. How could it have improved so much in just a short few months?</p><br/><p>\u201cHahahaha\u2026 Did you still think this is the same robot from three months ago?\u201d Han Yuan burst into a maniacal laughter as he tightened his grip on the scythe. \u201cYou despicable bloodlings, even though no one in the Galaxy dares to offend you, it doesn\u2019t mean there isn\u2019t justice. Today, I shall seek justice for myself.\u201d</p><br/><p>He had to be crazy! How could he think everyone but him was wrong?</p><br/><p>With another wave of the scythe, a second blue ray struck Luo Ying. She was prepared for his attack, though, so she morphed the lightning into a long whip, striking the blue ray. The attack was sent flying, but her whip was cut in half as well.</p><br/><p>The three of them had their hearts in their throat. At this rate, even if she could endure till the Elder Council came, she would definitely sustain injuries. Instinctively, Yao Si wanted to head over and help by tapping onto her ability. But somehow, after tapping onto Nephew Gu\u2019s ability, other than the ability she couldn\u2019t seem to summon, her body seemed to be empty.</p><br/><p>What happened? Had her ability lost its effect? F*ck! This was a critical moment.</p><br/><p>What should she do? Nephew Gu\u2019s ability was foresight and Bai Yi\u2019s to read minds, so out of the four of them, only Luo Ying had an offensive ability.</p><br/><p>Their battle continued to heat up.</p><br/><p>Yuan Han\u2019s robot was visibly improved, and even the blue scythe was shinning brighter than before, carrying a hint of red. With just a small wave, a cut started to form. At the beginning, both Luo Ying and the robot were equal, but as the battle continued, she started to take on a defensive position to protect the three behind her.</p><br/><p>Yao Si observed in fear as Yuan Han jumped high into the skies, the scythe in his hands forming multiple light rays, all of which were directed toward them.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck!\u201d Yao Si cursed as she worried about Luo Ying. \u201cJumping so high up, aren\u2019t you worried about spraining your ankle?\u201d</p><br/><p>The very next moment, the robot that was in the midst of an attack froze, its right leg collapsing, which sent the entire body to the ground.</p><br/><p><em>F*ck, f*ck, f*ck!</em></p><br/><p>He really sprained his ankle! Yao Si\u2019s enthusiasm heightened. With any trouble the robot faced, their situation would get better!</p><br/><p>The black robot made a perfect aerial turn, landing smoothly on the ground.<em>Why didn\u2019t it kill you! </em> She couldn\u2019t help mocking him once more, \u201cWhat\u2019s so great about landing like that, you should be afraid of falling when walking on solid ground.\u201d</p><br/><p>The next moment the robot seemed to have been possessed. It slipped forward on its next step, falling head first.</p><br/><p>(\u2299 o \u2299)</p><br/><p>It really fell!</p><br/><p><em>I guess that robot isn\u2019t as great as he thought.</em></p><br/><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you fall into the lake, too?\u201d</p><br/><p>Blop! The robot that had just stood up suddenly fell into the lake next to it!</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Yao Si.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Gu Shucheng</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Bai Yi</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Luo Ying</p><br/><p>The three of them turned to glance at her.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour\u2026 Highness?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI-I have no clue?\u201d Yao Si was clearly even more baffled that the three of them. What exactly had happened here? When had her words been so accurate? Was the robot possessed? Why was it following her every command?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t I\u2026 test it out again?\u201d She glanced at the robot that was already out of the water, and with a tinge of guilt, she added, \u201cCough, erm\u2026 After that swim, aren\u2019t you worried about short-circuiting?\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment she finished her sentence, a spark alighted on the robot\u2019s left hand, and the originally held up arm went limp, hanging lifelessly by the side.</p><br/><p>It really\u2026 short-circuited?</p><br/><p>(\u2299_\u2299)</p><br/><p>\u201cB*tch, what did you do to my robot?\u201d Yuan Han detected the abnormality and pulled his robot a safe distance away, while the unfeeling robot eyes continued to stare in their direction. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t the arms working? This isn\u2019t possible.\u201d</p><br/><p><em>I have no idea, young man!</em></p><br/><p>\u201cYour Highness, continue talking, don\u2019t stop!\u201d Gu Shucheng was the first to figure things out, as he glanced at her with bright eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Your Highness!\u201d Bai Yi added in excitement. \u201cUse your jinxed mouth to kill him!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d <em>Eh, why does that encouragement seem kind of odd? </em></p><br/><p>Yuan Han was infuriated. \u201cI\u2019m going to kill you!\u201d A buzzing sound came from the robot, and he pulled the ruined left arm away, then with just the right arm raised the bloodied scythe. Tens of needle like rays flew over.</p><br/><p>Luo Ying hurriedly formed her lighting into a net, defending them. As the battle grew increasingly more heated, Yao Si continued to jinx Yuan Huan with her words. Due to this, the situation changed entirely.</p><br/><p>\u201cEven with so many rays, you won\u2019t hit anything.\u201d</p><br/><p>Right after\u2026 nothing hit!</p><br/><p>\u201cMetals are conductors of electricity, aren\u2019t you afraid of getting struck by the lighting?\u201d</p><br/><p>The next moment\u2026 he was struck!</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand why would someone use such a long scythe as a weapon, what if the long handle trips you over?\u201d</p><br/><p>The next moment\u2026 he really tripped and fell!</p><br/><p>\u201cThe scythe\u2019s blade is pointing inwards, if you position it at your waist, won\u2019t you hurt your balls?\u201d</p><br/><p>The next moment\u2026 he cut his thighs. Oh, the robot doesn\u2019t have balls!</p><br/><p>o(&gt;\ufe4f&lt;)o</p><br/><p>In just a short while, with her jinx mouth at work, the robot tripped and cut itself numerous times. The perfectly fine robot had lost a limb and been struck by lightning multiple times\u2014it was simply\u2026 in the trenches.</p><br/><p>Gradually, Yao Si became aware that every time she spoke, the energy would surge within her. That energy that she had originally been unable to summon would leave her body.</p><br/><p>So\u2026 her jinxed mouth was actually an ability!!</p><br/><p>This ability was activated based on Nephew Gu\u2019s ability, and since his was foresight, then the counter was\u2026 a jinxed mouth?</p><br/><p>What kind of ability was that?</p><br/><p>Flips table!</p><br/><p>(\u256f\u2035\u25a1\u2032)\u256f\ufe35\u253b\u2501\u253b</p><br/><p>First Lord of Subtitles, now this jinxed mouth! How far was this counter ability going to go!</p><br/><p>\u201cYou incorrigible bloodlings! You\u2019re despicable!\u201d Yuan Han\u2019s robot was starting to fume. The originally black color didn\u2019t change much, but the body started to reek of smoke as the electric currents scattered. \u201cI\u2019ll definitely avenge myself! Don\u2019t you dare think I\u2019ll surrender because of this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho cares whether you surrender!\u201d Bai Yi spat. With confidence, he retorted, \u201cWe just want to bash you.\u201d</p>\n</div>"}

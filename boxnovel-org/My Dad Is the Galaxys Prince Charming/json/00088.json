He couldn\u2019t seem to get use to her new identity, for he kept scratching his head as he passed her the map. \u201cPres- Your Highness, it\u2019s right here, close to where we are.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si glanced over, and there was indeed a flashing red dot on the map, below which was the distance: 5.8 km.</p><br/><p>The service crew mentioned that there would occasionally be special gifts available in the third district for beginners. The gifts would be able to increase their mental strength more effectively, but that was dependant on the individual, and the chance of an encounter was rare. Besides, the individual would be put under a considerable amount of risk during it, so Yao Si didn\u2019t hold much hope.</p><br/><p>But somehow, her luck was way over the charts \u2013 she actually spotted it!</p><br/><p>\u201cGreat, let\u2019s hurry over.\u201d Yao Si turned, prepared to head over. This was practically a gift from heavens, so she wouldn\u2019t miss it for the world.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait a minute, Your Highness.\u201d Gu Shucheng stopped her yet again. \u201cEven though its just 5.8 km, this is a jungle. If you were to run there, it\u2019d take about an hour which might not be fast enough, why don\u2019t we fly then?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si stilled. \u201cYou brought flying devices?\u201d Didn\u2019t the rules mention that the only non-celestial item allowed was the optical computer?</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Gu Shucheng shook his head. \u201cIn order to deal with such situations, the celestials\u2019 have prepared simple transportation tools for those on training.\u201d Gu Shucheng tapped his optical computer, signaling for her to open the beginner guide.</p><br/><p><em>There are such services? If I\u2019d known, I wouldn\u2019t have hopped onto that unlucky Zan Zichen\u2019s free ride! </em></p><br/><p>Yao Si opened the guide with joy, and inside, there was indeed a \u2018call for transport\u2019 option. She hurriedly tapped onto it, and a purple gleam shot out from the optical computer into the skies.</p><br/><p><em>What kind of transport will it be </em>? Yao Si waited, preparing for a flying sword or a ship to appear.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, bird cry came from above. Upon rising her head, Yao saw five celestial swans flying over from afar!</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u25cb|\uffe3|_</p><br/><p>It was indeed the transportation used by the celestials!</p><br/><p>The option she had pressed a moment ago was\u2026 calling for swans?</p><br/><p>-_-|||</p><br/><p>Maybe due to the tip given, the celestial swans flew much faster than before. In less than five minutes, they were at their destination. After paying the swans, they found themselves in front of a cave.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe level up gift is inside?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, this is the marking on the map,\u201d Bai Yi replied.</p><br/><p>Yao Si looked in front of them, which was clearly a horrifying cave. Biting down on her lip, she decided to go for it!</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m going in.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGo for it, Your Highness!\u201d The group of bloodlings made a fist to show their support, with only Gu Shucheng looking regretful. \u201cYour Highness, are you sure you don\u2019t want us to follow along? What if you meet with danger\u2026\u201d He frowned, adding seriously, \u201cWe would really love to witness your prowess and cheer you on!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d <em>Cheer me on? I\u2019m sure you just want to watch a show. </em> \u201cIt\u2019s fine, I\u2019ll be training my mental strength not my ability, so your presence will distract me.\u201d</p><br/><p>They glanced at each other before nodding regretfully. \u201cWe\u2019ll wait for your successful return.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, you don\u2019t have to worry about us, bash what is there up!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh right, meal time is in six hours, Your Highness, remember\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know, I know.\u201d Yao Si waved her hand in annoyance. <em>Isn\u2019t it just a meal? Is there a need to repeat it so many times! </em>Without hesitation, she headed into the cave.</p>\n</div>"}

His expression was animated, as he was clearly excited to have met a friend with common interest. \u201cI\u2019m God Mu\u2019s fan as well, I\u2019ve been collecting his merchandise ever since I was young and have supported all his endorsements. But you seem to be an even bigger fan than I am, even taking on his name. Ha ha ha\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d What could she say?</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard he woke up recently, and I\u2019ve been recently trying to get my hands on a license to tour the Red Planet,\u201d he explained enthusiastically, his face indulgent, dying to chat with Mu Xuan the entire night. \u201cEven though I can\u2019t enter the Bloodling capital or see him in real life, the thought of being on the same planet as him delights me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d <em>What a dummy!</em></p><br/><p>Was the name Mu Xuan as common as Wang Jianguo and Li Jianjun on Blue Planet?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you think bro? Want to come along with me?\u201d Huo Qi was convinced that Mu Xuan was a fan as well, so he slapped his chest confidently. \u201cYour bro here has his sources, I\u2019ll definitely get my hands on that tour license.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Only a fan could understand.</p><br/><p>Mu Xuan frowned, pulling his cub backwards, worried that she would get infected by the stranger\u2019s weirdness.</p><br/><p>Huo Qi continued to ramble in their silence.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, a thundering sound erupted from the ships simultaneously as though sending out a signal. The next moment the ships flew off.</p><br/><p>\u201cI guess the bug won\u2019t be back today.\u201d Huo Qi sighed, turning to face them. \u201cWhat are your plans? Why don\u2019t you\u2026 join me in the space station till the next update comes? The Alliance might send a notice soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si turned toward Mu Xuan, who nodded nonchalantly. \u201cSure, we\u2019ll trouble you then.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome!\u201d He tapped his chest. \u201cHaving the same idols makes us family.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two stared at him, speechless.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go, Alliance\u2019s ship is here.\u201d Huo Qi signaled to them before flying into a gigantic ship.</p><br/><p>Yao Si and Mu Xuan followed behind. When they entered, they realized that the crowd which had been fighting the beast alongside them was all inside this space station. They formed small groups and were either resting or discussing something among themselves.</p><br/><p>\u201cHere, here!\u201d Huo Qi waved towards them from a table in front of them.</p><br/><p>As they walked over, Yao Si couldn\u2019t help asking, \u201cMu Xuan, why can\u2019t they recognize you?\u201d It was the same when they were back on Eternal Brightness planet. Since he was a global idol, with his face hung everywhere, used in all sorts of advertisements, how could he walk on the streets for such a long time without anyone recognizing him? Was everyone in the Galaxy blind?</p><br/><p>What\u2019s more was that he had even given his name in front of Huo Qi. As a die heard fan of Mu Xuan, there was no way he wouldn\u2019t have recognized him.</p><br/><p>\u201cMental ability,\u201d Mu Xuan replied coldly.</p><br/><p>Yao Si stilled. \u201cAre you saying\u2026 you used your mental strength against everyone else?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMmh.\u201d He nodded. \u201cThey don\u2019t see me as you do.\u201d</p><br/><p><em>I see\u2026 </em>But how great was his ability to be able to veil his appearance in front of such a huge crowd.</p><br/><p>She silently counted the number of people around them\u2026 <em>Hmm, you\u2019re indeed my father!</em></p><br/><p>\u256e(\u256f\ufe4f\u2570\uff09\u256d</p><br/><p>After resting for a short while, the ship headed into a portal, entering a space station nearby. Yao Si looked around curiously, as compared to the space station near the blue planet, this one was much bigger. It had a snowflake design. There were a number of ships stationed in the six corners, while the middle was slightly transparent . At first look, it seemed like a small town.</p><br/><p>In front of the space station was a blue and white planet. Maybe since it was quite far from the Eternal Brightness, this planet seemed a little dim. Its shadowed half was completely black, a stark contrast to the bright space station they were in.</p><br/><p>What was especially interesting was that besides that one planet, there wasn\u2019t any others around, as opposed to the starry skies Yao Si was used to seeing. This seemed a little sad and lonely.</p><br/><p>\u201cSis Yao Si, is this the first time you\u2019re at the border of the Galaxy?\u201d Huo Qi smiled, noticing her curiosity. \u201cThis is the forty-forth space station at the border, while in front of us is Planet 14.\u201d</p><br/><p>14,44? Why did it seem like such an inauspicious number! <sup>1</sup></p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no satellite on this planet?\u201d she asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is!\u201d Huo Qi replied. \u201cThere was originally four of them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOriginally?\u201d <em>What does that mean?</em></p><br/><p>\u201cYea, the bug ate them all.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe galactic beast ate the satellites?!\u201d Yao Si eyes went wide from shock. <em>Is that what they eat? Isn\u2019t it too brutal\u2026</em></p><br/><p>\u201cThey eat everything,\u201d Huo Qi replied infuriated. \u201cSmall planets, satellites\u2026They aren\u2019t picky, eating everything in sight. They\u2019re comparable to those greedy bloodlings.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si and Mu Xuan silently stared at him, triggered\u2026</p><br/><p><em>You could have left it at the galactic beasts, was there a need to insult the bloodlings?</em></p><br/><p>\u201cBut my Mu Xuan is definitely different,\u201d the man suddenly added, his face filled with worship and love for the male god he spoke of.</p><br/><p>Yao Si glanced over at a certain someone\u2019s cold face with her eyes saying \u2018Please send your die hard fan away\u2019.</p><br/><p>\u201cThese galactic beasts appear out of nowhere and start eating without notice.\u201d Huo Qi sighed deeply, shaking his head as he pointed to their surroundings. \u201cIf the Alliance hadn\u2019t predicted its position in advance, all of these planets would have been eaten.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre there many galactic beasts around?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot really! There\u2019s around three to five each year.\u201d He shook his head, but just then, he suddenly remembered something, and broke into a sly smile. \u201cBut\u2026 Even though live beasts can be quite a handful, the dead ones are worth a fortune, their skin, meat, blood, and bones can all be sold. Nowadays, the beast\u2019s meat is a favorite among many races and is highly sought after, so it has a great value in the market. Ech, it\u2019s a pity the beast today escaped or we would have made a killing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Er\u2026Why didn\u2019t the price matter when it came to food? She suddenly remembered that back on the Blue Planet the most pitiful lifeform was\u2014a crayfish! Despite being an extraterrestrial invader, it ended up being bred in farms.</p><br/><p>As long as there were food fanatics around, anything could flood the market.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut\u2026 that bug shouldn\u2019t have gone far,\u201d Huo Qi asserted. \u201cIf you guys aren\u2019t busy and would like a share, you shouldn\u2019t hurry out but wait around in the space station for a few days. The Alliance might send an update anytime soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si was indeed not in a hurry! She turned and glanced over at Mu Xuan When she confirmed that he wasn\u2019t in a rush to head back, she decided to stay for a few more days.</p><br/><p>Huo Qi seemed visibly delighted, and after a short discussion about the galactic beast, he turned to glance at Mu Xuan, instantly turning into a die hard fan once more as he rambled on about his idol.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother, let me tell you something! I heard that Mu Xuan endorsed a certain\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si grabbed onto Mu Xuan\u2019s tightly knotted fist. <em>Calm down, this is your die hard fan!</em></p>\n</div>"}

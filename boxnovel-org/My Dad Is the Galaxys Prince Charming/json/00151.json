Nothing had been smooth sailing in concern to his plan to properly educate his young cub on the common knowledge of the Galaxy for her to avoid dangers.</p><br/><p>At least she was learning well. Her first reaction upon encounter with a new race now was no longer to approach them but to browse through the notes he\u2019d prepared. With such a diligent cub, he should be pleased, but with the bumps that continually presented themselves, he could no longer keep his spirits high and even started harboring an urge to take revenge on the society.</p><br/><p>When the f*ck did these thoughts arise? He could overlook the encounter with the water race, but then she had managed to impregnate a male. Still, he could overlook it since she was after all his own cub!</p><br/><p>But how did the aves queen pop out from nowhere? Didn\u2019t those folk treat their queen like a precious pearl so she hadn\u2019t left the mother planet in the past hundreds of years? How could she venture so far just to snatch his cub?!</p><br/><p>The main point was Sisi\u2019s young age! It hadn\u2019t even been half a year since she had been fully converted into a bloodling. To a bloodling, she was just a young cub that hadn\u2019t even graduated from kindergarten.</p><br/><p>He had been nurturing her so carefully, afraid to bore her with his closeness, worrying his distance would bring her loneliness, constantly fretting about how the temperature would affect her. She was looked upon as a fragile treasure that needed to be babied\u2026 since she was a clueless and pure little cub!</p><br/><p>How could then all these foreign races try to corrupt her innocence? Didn\u2019t they have any consciousness?!</p><br/><p>What\u2019s worst was that the aves actually dared to kiss her! Twice! She kissed her! Kissed! Her! Her!</p><br/><p>He had only pecked her occasionally and kissed her twice, so how could another person kiss her?!</p><br/><p>How could she!</p><br/><p>The memory of the event sent a murderous intent through him. The entire Galaxy seemed to be going against him!</p><br/><p>\u201cMu Xuan.\u201d After processing the situation, Yao Si tugged onto his sleeve. \u201cDo you think the queen fell for me because of my\u2026 ability?\u201d She recalled activating hot, and since the queen\u2019s ability was seduction\u2026</p><br/><p>Since seduction was to bewitch others, her counter ability would be\u2026 causing the other party to fall for her.</p><br/><p>Other than this explanation, she couldn\u2019t explain why Lian Yu would suddenly go crazy for her. \u201cAfter all, I barely know her and I\u2019m a woman too. For her to fall for me at first sight\u2026 Mmh, even though I must admit she does look pretty, but\u2014\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPretty?\u201d Before she could finish her sentence, Mu Xuan interrupted, his voice tense and chilling. There was even a frostiness to their surroundings.</p><br/><p>Yao Si paused. Did she say something wrong?</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still young, do not be bewitched by other races.\u201d His young cub was indeed being led astray; those horrid foreigners! There was an urgent need to correct her thoughts right this instant! He held onto her hands and spoke seriously, \u201cSisi, you can\u2019t just look at one\u2019s appearance, the aves have always been a unique bunch. They sometimes act in unexpected ways.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnique?\u201d Yao Si stilled. What could be more \u2018unique\u2019 than her ability? \u201cHow so?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe seduction ability is just one of them. Others include stiffening, strength, swallowing, cursing, and even calling on spirits. I have also heard that some aves aren\u2019t able to detect their own ability which is why they don\u2019t easily expose their abilities as a prevention method.\u201d</p><br/><p><em>That\u2019s amazing! </em></p><br/><p>\u201cOut of all the races, aves are the most warlike. Two of the three major Galactic wars were initiated by them. We should avoid them at all costs.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh!?\u201d</p><br/><p>(\u2299 o \u2299)</p><br/><p>The large-winged race was so brutal? But the queen didn\u2019t look the part at all!</p><br/><p>\u201cAves have a diverse range of ability carriers, and even the bloodlings can\u2019t match up to their variety.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t\u201d Yao Si froze. \u201cDoesn\u2019t that mean that the aves are considered an even more terrifying race?\u201d</p><br/><p>Mu Xuan hesitated slightly before nodding aggressively, using this opportunity to shame the race that had tried to snatch his cub. Resolutely, he declared, \u201cYes!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si nodded. \u201cAlright, I understand, I\u2019ll stay clear of them from now on.\u201d They were clearly a dangerous kind.</p><br/><p>\u201cMmh.\u201d The chilling aura around Mu Xuan dissipated slightly. Great, his cub was heading back onto the right track!</p><br/><p>His cub could never be snatched away!</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Lu Chen who was witnessing could barely suppress himself.</p><br/><p><em>Mum\u2026 hurry over and take a look at this! After so many years, this is the first time a bloodling is calling someone else dangerous!</em></p><br/><p>Regardless of how many abilities the aves had, how could they match up to the bloodlings who were born with SSS level physiques? What\u2019s the use of their ability when they could be defeated with just one punch!</p><br/><p>But why did boss look like she was believing it?!</p><br/><p><em>If I were to expose the truth, would I get a pay raise? </em></p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>The three of them were in the aircraft for an entire week, flying through three galaxies before finally landing on Heavenly Planet. Lu Chen explained that it was the main planet of the realm they were in, and it was also the prettiest one.</p><br/><p>Since it was a public realm, it didn\u2019t belong to any particular race and could be developed commercially with all sorts of rare items. Of course, the prices weren\u2019t cheap, and any random cup was priced exorbitantly. It was considered the luxury planet in the Galaxy.</p><br/><p>As for why they had flown through three galaxies for this and not a particular race\u2019s planet, Mu Xuan had only one explanation: Striking a balance between work and play!</p><br/><p>Yao Si didn\u2019t insists. It was probably a good idea to take breaks when appropriate. Besides, they were on a holiday. However, Heavenly Planet seemed vaguely familiar; she seemed to have encountered this term before even though she couldn\u2019t seem to recall where it had been.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t like the other pit stops which they had visited previously. They had to stop at a space station and only after a series of procedures were they permitted access to the planet. It was only then that Yao Si gained a full view of the planet.</p><br/><p>It was a planet that seemed to have been splashed by a bucket of paints for no two areas were of the same color. There was a transparent direct portal from the space station which was clear and without a single obstruction, so the planet was in full sight as they were transported over.</p><br/><p>Yao Si was awestruck by the scenery. As expected of the luxury planet, even the air seemed to carry the scent of money.</p><br/><p>The planet was unlike all the other commercial plants she had been to. To her surprise, there wasn\u2019t much of a crowd in the streets. The stores were quiet, but they didn\u2019t seem worried about the lack of customer flow. Just from the exterior, one would barely be able to guess that they were shops at all.</p><br/><p>The sky wasn\u2019t filled with screens and advertisements, not even those with Mu Xuan\u2019s impostor\u2026</p><br/><p>Fine! That one could still be seen.</p><br/><p>\u256e(\u256f\ufe4f\u2570\uff09\u256d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Yao Si pointed to the right. It was a shop with the name \u2018Little Bridge to Family\u2019. When compared to the other cleaner and more striking shop fronts, it had a more ancient and retro take. Its inside was misty as though the store was among the clouds.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s take a look.\u201d Detecting her interest, Mu Xuan led her inside.</p><br/><p>\u201cWelcome!\u201d The very instant they entered the store, a sales attendant walked over to greet them with a sweet smile.</p><br/><p>After entering, Yao Si realized that they were in a flower shop. The entire store was filled with blossoming flora of every kind, some of which she had never seen before, some much taller than her, and some so tiny she could barely make out its features.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs there anything specific you are looking to get? \u201d the attendant asked with a sweet smile.</p><br/><p>Yao Si frowned slightly, starting to regret entering. Perhaps it was due to Qu Ze\u2019s previous prank, but she seemed to have developed a flower phobia. Every time she come across any stalk, she felt uncomfortable. But they had just entered the store, so it wouldn\u2019t be nice to just leave.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, the place had more than just flowers, and there were other items for sale on the side. Yao Si randomly picked out several knick-knacks. Since she didn\u2019t have much of a concept in regards to the galactic currency, she didn\u2019t feel in a pinch for the amount spent.</p><br/><p>The sales attendant broke into a radiant smile, passing the packed merchandise over. With a casual tap to the screen at the side, a stack of cards flew open.</p><br/><p>\u201cDearest customer, since today is the first day of our opening, every customer is entitled to a chance at a lucky draw.\u201d She pointed toward the stack of cards. \u201cYou just have to scan your optical computer\u2019s information! The first prize is a free entrance to Rainbow Pond.\u201d</p><br/><p>Was this an additional benefit? But what was Rainbow Pond?</p><br/><p>\u201cRainbow Pond is the main pond on Heavenly Planet,\u201d the best employee in the Galaxy Lu Chen explained. \u201cIt has the best facilities and scenery in the entire Galaxy, and it is also said to posses many mythical healing abilities. It\u2019s considered the most popular place in the entire Heavenly Planet and usually requires up to 4-5 years of waiting to get a spot, so it is definitely worth a trip!\u201d</p><br/><p><em>A bathhouse! Why do you even need to queue for a bathhouse?</em></p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s try our luck then.\u201d But she never had much luck at such things. \u201cYou guys can try first, I never have much luck at these.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Chen nodded, scanning his optical computer before tapping onto a random card. A notice popped up: [Ding, Customer Lu Chen, you have picked the slyvian bell flower. Thank you.]</p><br/><p>Nothing, as expected!</p><br/><p>Mu Xuan lifted his hands.</p><br/><p>[Ding, Customer Mo Xuan, you have picked the blood-colored flower. Thank you.]</p><br/><p>Nothing again!</p><br/><p>Yao Si didn\u2019t harbor much hope so she casually lifted her hand to swipe at the screen.</p><br/><p>[Ding, Customer Si Yao, you picked the ancient emerald flower.]</p><br/><p>\u201cCongratulations, you won the first prize!\u201d the sales attendant screamed out abruptly, switching off the machine. Reaching out, she grabbed onto Yao Si. \u201cHere\u2019s the Rainbow Pond voucher, please take a look.\u201d</p><br/><p>A pink voucher entered her optical computer\u2019s screen.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p><em>Ah?</em></p><br/><p><em>I won?!</em></p><br/><p>(\u2299_\u2299)</p><br/><p>But\u2026 was it a hallucination? Didn\u2019t she hear the machine announce a flower?</p></div>\n</div>"}

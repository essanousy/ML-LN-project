Who gave your race the right to be immortal while the other races die from old age and sickness? My research will benefit all the races! Once we unlock the secrets behind your immortality, all the races will be able to live forever.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis was the reason behind your kidnappings?\u201d Bai Yi asked, his eyes wide.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with that? If all the races become immortal, there won\u2019t be anymore sacrifices in the Galaxy.\u201d He grew increasingly more agitated and seemed to be even forgetting his injuries. \u201cWithout sacrifices, there won\u2019t be any quarrels, and the Galaxy would enter a state of euphoria. It\u2019s our vision and ultimate aim.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re using my people as specimens to reach euphoria, you must be joking,\u201d Bai Yi spat out. \u201cAren\u2019t you worried about the consequences once the red planet finds out?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat can they do?\u201d He humphed, his gaze steady and unrepentant. \u201cFor the sake of the entire Galaxy, for the sake of all the races\u2019 future, I\u2019m prepared to sacrifice everything I have, including my life. You bloodlings have always been a selfish race. Despite having immortality, you refuse to share its secret with the other races. Even if you have the ability to prevent conflicts in the Galaxy, you choose to stay on the sidelines without offering any help. After so many years of war between the various races, after the Alliance being rebuilt so many times, how many have perished? Haven\u2019t you thought about interfering? All you did was stand by nonchalantly! Why can\u2019t I use you as specimens, this is what your race owes us, owes to the entire Galaxy!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck you!\u201d Yao Si swung her leg at him. \u201cStop trying to sugarcoat your disgusting motives. At the end of the day, you\u2019re just jealous and afraid of death!\u201d She smirked/ \u201cWhat has the death of other races got to do with us bloodlings? The races fight due to their own greed, why push the blame on us? Are bloodlings your parents? Why must we worry and look out for you? What has your race done for the bloodlings? Lu Hangyi, keep your reasons to yourself and don\u2019t drag the other races down with you.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, the bloodlings are immortal. It\u2019s a strength of our kind, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s for everyone. Who are you to blame us for not sharing it? You\u2019re speaking as though you\u2019re a selfless sacrificial monk. If you\u2019re really as loving as you make yourself out to be, why did you build such a big research base, why didn\u2019t you just donate your money to save the other races who are worse off?</p><br/><p>\u201cAccording to your logic, there are many races that have yet to enter the Galaxy, so is it their fault? Look-look at how selfish you are, not sharing your abilities and resources.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShut up, shut up!\u201d Lu Hangyi shouted out, his face a mask of fury once his real reasons had been laid out for all to see. \u201cIt isn\u2019t like this, it isn\u2019t like this!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEnough, you\u2019re just jealous and unhappy at other people\u2019s success,\u201d Yao Si continued ruthlessly. \u201cYou\u2019re just like a child that was denied a candy. Lu Hangyi, you aren\u2019t a hero. What hero could sacrifice the researchers he personally employs? In the end, you\u2019re just seeking immortality at the cost of others for your own selfish and disgusting desires!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRubbish!\u201d The man went out of control, wanting to pounce on her but seemingly being too paralyzed to do so. \u201cLies, it\u2019s all a pack of lies! Who exactly are you? How dare you criticize my actions.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho am I?\u201d Yao Si stared straight at him. \u201cYou bully my people and you dare to ask who I am? You listen up.\u201d She took a deep breath, then clearly spit out each word. \u201cI am a fifth generation bloodling from the Red Planet, the cub of the His Majesty, Yao Si! The bloodlings will purge everything that has happened here! Regardless of whether it\u2019s you or your race!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFi-fifth generation! It-it\u2019s impossible, how can there still be a fifth generation blooding around?\u201d His eyes went wide, and his actions became frantic, to the point he resembled a maniac. \u201cNo\u2026 You can\u2019t do this! I\u2019m doing this for all the races, I\u2019m doing this for the entire Galaxy! One day, the Galaxy will enter a state of euphoria, that is its future . The organization\u2019s plans are never wrong!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOrganization?\u201d Yao Si stilled, then grabbed his collar. \u201cWhat do you mean? What organization?\u201d</p><br/><p>His expression grew increasingly hysterical. He soon looked deranged, and then, he burst into laughter. \u201cHahhahahahaha\u2026 Do you think the research base is everything? I\u2019m not the only one eyeing the bloodlings.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho are they, what is this organization you speak of?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEuphoria has finally settled, the Galaxy shall be reborn! Hahaha\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBai Yi, ability!\u201d</p><br/><p>If he wasn\u2019t willing to say anything, she would see it for herself.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026 oh,\u201d Bai Yi replied in a daze. Bust as he was about to summon his ability, his pupils shrank, and he pulled Yao Si backwards. \u201cBe careful!\u201d</p><br/><p>With a loud thud, Lu Hangyi activated a self-destruct bomb tied to his body, exploding himself into tiny pieces.</p><br/><p>Before his death, the word [Euphoria] formed above him.</p><br/><p><em>Euphoria\u2026 Is that the name of the organisation? </em></p><br/><p>Yao Si\u2019s heart sank, and an ominous feeling settled in within her.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p>\n</div>"}

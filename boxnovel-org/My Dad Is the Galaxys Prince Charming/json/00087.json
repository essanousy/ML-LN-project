Yao Si started with the smallest creature that possessed mental strength, for instance the bunnies in the Shadow Planet!</p><br/><p>Yao Si focused all her mental strength, staring at the white furball ahead that was munching on the grass, following the instructions on the beginner guide and attempting to affect its external consciousness.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Highness, go for it! Concentrate your consciouss\u2014\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re almost there, you\u2019re about to control it!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKeep your breathing steady, exert your mental strength\u2026 The bunny is about to fall from your ability, Your Highness!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlmost there, almost there!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou did it! The rabbit has been chased away by Your Highness\u2019 massive mental strength!\u201d</p><br/><p>It was chased away by you guys!</p><br/><p>Why did she have to lug them around for training? <em>Are you guys sure you\u2019re not here to increase the difficulty?</em></p><br/><p>\u201cThe four of you, I beg you, could you give me some peace for my training?\u201d <em> I want to cry </em>. \u201cCan\u2019t you sit in the corner for a while?\u201d</p><br/><p>The bloodlings glanced at each other before nodding in unison.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Your Highness!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSure, Your Highness!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI accept your order, Your Highness!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo problem, Your Highness!\u201d</p><br/><p>The four of them sat down right away, with their eyes still focused on her, their gazes full of worship.</p><br/><p>Yao Si\u2019s face muscles twitched, but she turned around; it was better not to taint her eyes. She settled down on the grass, thinking about the bunny from before; her situation seemed far worse than she had expected. She had no clue how to utilize her mental strength, having never used it before.</p><br/><p>She could only start from the most basic matter stated in the beginner guide, meditation. She shut her eyes and started to sense the surroundings.</p><br/><p>Didn\u2019t they say that once sight is taken away, other senses will increase in sensitivity? This awareness of the surroundings was considered part of mental strength, one just had to increase the scope to comprise other external factors.</p><br/><p>Only when she could feel the environment would it considered an exertion of mental strength. The distance covered would then determine the power of one\u2019s mental strength.</p><br/><p>Yao Si used her entire being to feel the environment.</p><br/><p>After thirty minutes\u2026</p><br/><p>Her breathing calmed down.</p><br/><p>After forty minutes\u2026</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t have any wayward thoughts.</p><br/><p>After an hour\u2026</p><br/><p>Her senses grew in sensitivity.</p><br/><p>After an hour and a half\u2026.</p><br/><p>She\u2014</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Highness, it\u2019s time for lunch!\u201d</p><br/><p>Heat seeped into her senses, and the aroma of piping hot duck blood curd rushed into her nose. She could feel all her energy dissipating in an instant, and the sensation of being about to succeed vanished completely.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si glanced up into Nephew Gu\u2019s caring eyes. With shaky hands, she took hold of the bowl, having an impulse to bury her face in the food. <em> It pains!</em></p><br/><p>\u201cNephew Gu!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Highness?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWould you consider not being my fan?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Highness, don\u2019t worry, I will always support you!\u201d He tapped his chest violently, resolution clear on his face. \u201cBloodlings have always been loyal to their bloodline. As long as you\u2019re Our Highness, we will always be your subjects. Besides, you saved my life!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen can you not repay my kindness with hatred?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Highness!\u201d Just as misery poured onto her face, Bai Yi ran over in excitement, pointing onto the map on the optical computer. \u201cThere\u2019s a reaction on the detector; we\u2019re really lucky. It\u2019s really here, about five kilometers away.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si jumped up in joy. \u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Highness!\u201d Gu Shucheng took a step to the side, stopping her with righteousness. \u201cPlease have your meal.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p><em>Can\u2019t you get another job?</em></p><br/><p>\u00a0</p>\n</div>"}

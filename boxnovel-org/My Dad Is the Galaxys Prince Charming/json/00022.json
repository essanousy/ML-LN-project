The second elder stood up and said in haste, \u201cImmediately lock the capital, we must not let him reach her highness.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cToo late.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s already arrived at her highness\u2019s place.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The silence was like death, everyone collectively stiffened then rushed out of the conference room together.</p><br/><p><em>Your highness, you must hang in there!</em></p><br/><p>\u2014</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Yao Si was staring dumbstruck at the man who had suddenly appeared before her eyes and was smiling at her like a flower.</p><br/><p>\u201cYo, so this is our newly awakened ancestor.\u201d He walked around her in a circle, examining her from top to bottom. \u201cHow cute.\u201d Unlike other bloodlings who acted reverent and respectful, his attitude was free and unreserved.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Hello!\u201d Yao Si felt a little uncomfortable from his staring, so she extended her hand and greeted him.</p><br/><p>He smiled even more widely, making his eyes and eyebrows wink into a thin line. The average good looks of the bloodlings were already exceptional, but he was clearly one of those that pulled up the average line. From his single smile, it was as if the whole room had bloomed with flowers.</p><br/><p>He reached out and took her hand, but then turned it over and lowered his head and kissed the back of it with full devotion. \u201cIt\u2019s a great pleasure to meet you, my highness.\u201d All his actions were very attentive, while his thick golden hair scattered down his back like golden beams.</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha\u2026 Great elder.\u201d Yao Qian on the side suddenly came back to his senses. He stepped between the two people with a long stride and, pulling his ossified lips apart, said, \u201cWhat wind brought you here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, thirteen, you\u2019re here too!\u201d The man looked as if he had just noticed Yao Qian\u2019s existence. He gestured toward him, then continued saying to Yao Si, \u201cOh right, your highness, I forgot to introduce myself. My name is Qu Ze, I am a thirtieth generation bloodling.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t aware that the great elder had suddenly returned, was it because of anything?\u201d Yao Qian continued to block the two, an expression of facing death unflinchingly on his face. He must never let that man get close to her highness.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, thirteen, why are you so uptight?\u201d Qu Ze patted his shoulder. \u201cSince I\u2019m also a descendant of the bloodlings, is there anything wrong with me coming back to visit the ancestor?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha\u2026 Now that you saw the person, the great elder you can return.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy the hurry.\u201d The newcomer continued to smile at Yao Si. \u201cI heard your highness is looking for a butler to take her around and familiarize with the things in the galaxy. Why not consider me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need.\u201d Before Yao Si could open her mouth to answer, she heard the unhesitating rejection of Yao Qian. \u201cThe Elders\u2019 Committee has already decided that I will be helping her highness get used to the things in the galaxy.\u201d<em>There\u2019s no way I\u2019m letting you do it </em>.</p><br/><p>\u201cThirteen, there\u2019s no way you know more than me.\u201d Qu Ze pushed him aside without hesitation, and continued to maneuver himself before Yao Si. \u201cYour highness, what do you make of me? I know a lot and look pleasing to the eyes, how about replacing him with me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si knotted her brows. She just wanted to learn some common sense, no matter who taught it, it wouldn\u2019t make a difference, right? Besides, judging by Yao Qian\u2019s stressed look, she had a premonition that this supposed great elder was a little unreliable.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, that\u2019s decided.\u201d</p><br/><p>Huh?!</p><br/><p>He walked up and draped his arm around Yao Si. \u201cThen let me take you around to understand the Red Planet on-site.\u201d</p><br/><p><em>Wait? I haven\u2019t agreed!</em></p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re leaving.\u201d He suddenly took something out.</p><br/><p>Yao Si could only feel sceneries flash in front of her eyes before quickly appearing behind her.</p><br/><p>The panicking voice of Yao Qian reached her ears. \u201cYour highness!\u201d</p><br/><p>Then the next moment, she was already standing in a patch of red forest.</p><br/><p>\u201cWow, I would have never thought that this particle transmitter actually works.\u201d Qu Ze clattered the little box in his hand with slight surprise, then turned and faced her, smiling like a flower again. \u201cYour highness, do you like it here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si wasn\u2019t able to recover herself for a complete minute.</p><br/><p>After a long while, she began to come to her senses. After examining her surroundings, she realized that this was a forest that was completely different from the forests she\u2019d seen before. Red plants were everywhere: some reached to the sky, others covered the whole ground, there were even bright flowers that were as tall as people and gigantic colorful mushrooms. She had a feeling that she had entered the world of fairy tales.</p><br/><p>This place was really\u2026 quite beautiful!</p><br/><p>\u201cGreat elder\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour highness, just call me Qu Ze.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, Qu Ze, where is this place?\u201d she asked.</p><br/><p>Qu Ze nodded his head while smiling. \u201cYes, where is\u2026 this place?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Yao Si\u2019s mouth twitched. <em>So you don\u2019t freaking know!</em></p><br/><p>\u201cHahahaha, don\u2019t get me wrong, the place we were transported to by the particle transmitter is random, but the distance is within two hundred thousand kilometers.\u201d He lifted the little box in his hand. \u201cAs to where exactly, a location detector would know, but with the current situation of your highness, don\u2019t you think we can learn the environment better this way?\u201d</p><br/><p><em>Sounds reasonable!</em></p><br/><p>\u201cNow that we have arrived in the forest, let me introduce your highness to the most common plants of the Red Planet and other matters that need attention.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si nodded her head and listened carefully.</p><br/><p>Qu Ze cleared his throat and began to explain seriously.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are many variations in plant species on the red planet, relatively speaking, they are divided into dangerous and purely ornamental.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe species that have currently been discovered total to\u2026\u201d He paused as if deep in thought, then continued solemnly, \u201cA lot!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCome, look at that over there which is very tall and like a tree, yes\u2026 That is a tree!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe patch on the ground that looks like grass\u2026That is grass!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd those over there that are round and tall are\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMushrooms!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWow, I would have never guessed that your highness would be such a fast learner!\u201d</p><br/><p><em>Learn your ass! Who would do an introduction like you? You don\u2019t even have the bloody teacher qualification certificate, right?!</em></p><br/><p>Why did he bring her here?</p><br/><p>\u201cI have eyes, thank you!\u201d <em>As long as you\u2019re not blind, you can guess it, alright? </em>She inhaled deeply, pushing down the fit of rage to the bottom of her heart, then turned and looked at the giant flower beside her. \u201cQu Ze, I think that flower over there\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ever since she had arrived, she had spotted that all the plants here were mostly red, only that flower was white. It was particularly outstanding at first sight, especially since it had grown so tall, a whole chunk taller than Qu Ze. Besides, it had no stem or leaves, only a lonely bloom. Maybe it was just a delusion, but she seemed to have seen it move.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour highness, you\u2019re interested in this? It\u2019s\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you dare say flower, I will beat you up!\u201d <em>I\u2019ve been tolerating you for a long time already.</em></p><br/><p>\u201cEh\u2026\u201d Qu Ze was stupefied, but soon after he continued while smiling cheerfully, \u201cDon\u2019t be like that, your highness. You must believe me, I\u2019m actually quite knowledgeable.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha\u2026\u201d She had already experienced it.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m quite familiar with this type of flower.\u201d He walked straight beside the large flower and poked its petal. \u201cIt seems to be called \u2018Gluttony\u2019. To be exact, it doesn\u2019t count as a plant, but rather an animal.\u201d</p><br/><p>Animal?!</p><br/><p>\u201cIt can\u2019t be mobile for a long period of time, and its appearance is akin to that of a flower. It also likes to pretend to be one, luring animals close, then with a single bite\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Before he could finish his sentence, the flower that had remained silent beside him suddenly lowered its head and opened its mouth, swallowing Qu Ze whole. Inside it echoed the words that he hadn\u2019t finished, \u201c\u2026Eat it.\u201d</p><br/><p><em>Oh shit! Oh shit! Oh shit!</em></p><br/><p>\u201cQu Ze!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si had a fright, but the next moment in this urgent situation, she took hold of one of his legs with all her might. \u201cAre you freaking insane. You know it eats people and you go up to it and poke it anyways.\u201d He must be brain-damaged, completely damaged!</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m just doing a demonstration for your highness.\u201d Half of his body was already swallowed inside the flower, yet he never ceased to answer her. \u201cHer highness actually came to rescue me personally! Qu Ze feels so blessed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShut up!\u201d Now Yao Si finally realized why Yao Qian was so stressed. This jerk was a full on lunatic. \u201cCan you at least struggle for a while, I can\u2019t hold on anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCome on your highness, the other trait of Gluttony is that as long as it took a hold of something it will never let go.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d <em>Would it have killed you to have said it earlier! I\u2019ll throw you! Are you so happy that you\u2019re being eaten? Can\u2019t you at least have a sense of crisis?</em></p><br/><p>\u201cOh your highness, forgot to mention another point to you. Don\u2019t ever touch any part of the flower, otherwise\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si froze, staring at the foot she had placed for leverage on the petal.</p><br/><p><em>Hell!</em></p><br/><p>With the sound of \u201cahwooo\u201d, in a blink of an eye, they reunited inside the stomach of the flower.</p><br/><p>Only now did Qu Ze finish saying what he hadn\u2019t managed previously. \u201c\u2026You would be swallowed too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p>\n</div>"}

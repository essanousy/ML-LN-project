He had both hands in his pockets as he glanced at her in a relaxed manner.</p><br/><p>He seemed familiar. Wasn\u2019t he the person on stage yesterday, the bloodling with the name\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cYi\u2026 Yi\u2026\u201d Didn\u2019t it go along the lines of Yi?</p><br/><p>\u201cBai Yi!\u201d He glared at her disapprovingly. \u201cHow could you be late for the first weekly meeting?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWeekly meeting?\u201d <em>What\u2019s that? </em> She had no idea since she had left early the day before. \u201cBut\u2026\u201d She shifted her eyes toward Chu Jing who had just fainted. She should really send her to the nurse\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2019s from the Heba tribe,\u201d Bai Yi interrupted her hesitation. \u201cWhenever they get agitated, they would enter a pretend death mode. They can faint up to ten times a day.\u201d</p><br/><p><em>Heh\u2026 Pretend death is normal? What a world\u2026 </em></p><br/><p>\u201cAll right, all right, let\u2019s hurry! Everyone\u2019s waiting.\u201d He took hold of her arms and dragged her out of the room. \u201cHeh, something must be up with Shu Cheng to have elected you as the president.\u201d Once they started walking together, he continued to criticize her.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou must have done some amazing things in your last life to have such luck. Ever since the academy was built, there hasn\u2019t been a president that wasn\u2019t a bloodling.</p><br/><p>\u201cShucheng didn\u2019t even think it through. Is everyone actually eligible to be the president? Others aside, how many of us bloodlings are honest?</p><br/><p>\u201cThe bloodlings in the academy would never listen to him if his ancestor wasn\u2019t the Thirteen Elder. As an outsider, how are you going to manage the academy? Any other race will easily rip your hands off .</p><br/><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re f*cking lucky to have bumped into His Majesty the very first time he visited the academy. With his one word, everything should be fine.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour life improved just like that. It was the first time I saw His Majesty, If\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si walked quietly, speechless.</p><br/><p><em>This dude\u2026 is so naggy\u2026</em></p><br/><p>\u201cMmh? Why aren\u2019t you replying?\u201d He turned around abruptly.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, I understand, you must be nervous, right?\u201d Before she could respond, he continued, \u201cI guess it\u2019s understandable, since you became a member out of nowhere. You must feel like everything\u2019s a dream now. How could someone that isn\u2019t a bloodling be able to speak to His Royal Majesty? But you don\u2019t have to worry, even though you aren\u2019t a bloodling, our race has its values, since Shucheng chose you, we won\u2019t make this difficult.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cActually\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere isn\u2019t much to the student union, especially for the president. The other members are just a few elders. For matters that we can settle, we will make the decision. Today\u2019s meeting is just a formality. Since Gu Shucheng is the new vice president, he\u2019ll take care of the matters while you aren\u2019t familiar with the system . That guy is really putting in a whole lot of effort for you. Yesterday, he mentioned that he was going to get you for the meeting, but since I was curious, I decided to get you myself instead. Oh right, what\u2019s the relationship between you guys?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cForget it, what could it be? That guy is such a bore, after half a day, I still wasn\u2019t able to get anything out of him, he\u2019s so rigid\u2026 Besides, he wouldn\u2019t be interested in a new biological series student. Let me tell you\u2026 <em>Blahblahblah.. </em>.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si was denied any opportunity to speak.</p><br/><p><em>Forget it, you can talk by yourself if it makes you happy. </em></p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>Naggy Bai Yi was right, there wasn\u2019t much to do in the student union. Or rather, it was she who didn\u2019t have much to do. The student union was had at least a hundred committee members. The day before, due to Mu Xuan\u2019s sudden arrival, the election for the various departments couldn\u2019t be held, so the previous committee members were re-elected, with only a few changes in their positions. Even so, they seemed familiar with their tasks.</p><br/><p>Yao Si sat in the office for a few hours, signing, stamping, and writing the words \u201cCompleted\u201d on a few documents. Other than the minor uproar she caused when she arrived, the members seemed to have accepted this unknown president, without an ounce of judgment. Occasionally, Yao Si could feel their glances, as if they were trying to work up the courage to speak to her, but all of them were stopped by Gu Shucheng.</p><br/><p>Yao Si witnessed the workings of the student union, and learned about the differences between the academies in the Blue Planet and the Galaxy. The Galactic Academy was actually operated by the student union. They took care of every detail from the employment of the teachers and setting of class schedules to administering school rules. Without any leading figure, the student union held all the authority. Thus, the student union had a lot on its plate.</p><br/><p>After working the entire afternoon, Yao Si could only finish half of her workload. Fortunately, she had no lessons in the afternoon or she would have been exhausted.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll stop here!\u201d Gu Shucheng ended the meeting after glancing at the time.</p><br/><p>Yao Si sighed, but just as she was about to leave, a department head stood up. \u201cPresident! There\u2019s an urgent matter, Zhuo Feng Academy requested a friendly battle, I think\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe can discuss this tomorrow,\u201d Gu Shucheng interrupted after taking a couple more glances at the time. \u201cIt\u2019s lunch time, everyone is dismissed.\u201d He turned to look at Yao Si seriously, reminding her, \u201cYour Hi- President, it\u2019s time for lunch, I\u2019ll send you back!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEr, I don\u2019t think its necessary\u2026 right?\u201d She could go back by herself.</p><br/><p>Gu Shucheng paled and shook his head vigorously, \u201cNo, no, no! It\u2019s my duty.\u201d <em>If you\u2019re even a minute late, the Elder Council will kill me, so I need to keep a close eye on you!</em></p><br/><p>Yao Si stared in disbelief, then stood up as he wished. Just then, Bai Yi interrupted, \u201cWhy bother, we can just order delivery.\u201d He tapped his optical computer, and a menu popped up. \u201cI heard that there\u2019s a new chef and homemade duck blood curd. President, I\u2019m sure you haven\u2019t tried it, why not\u2014\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Before he could finish his sentence, Gu Shucheng had already denied him flatly. It was the Elder Council\u2019s highest order. He had to ensure its success at any cost. \u201cThe! President! Has! To! Be! At! Home! For! Her! Meals!\u201d How could the chef compare to His Majesty!</p><br/><p>Bai Yi stilled, glancing at them suspiciously. \u201cWhat\u2019s with this tense mood? What\u2019s wrong with the canteen\u2019s food? You\u2026\u201d Then, a preposterous thought struck him. His eyes went wide, and his eyes jumped from one of them to the other in shock. \u201cF*ck, Shucheng\u2026 You can\u2019t possibly have fallen for her\u2026 Are you bringing her out on a date?\u201d</p><br/><p>The crowd turned over in a single motion, one long-legged sister from the opposite side of the room sweeping Yao Si up and down several times in particular.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d Gu Shucheng\u2019s face darkened. How would he dare! \u201cI\u2019ve reminded you so many times to mind your language. Enough, let\u2019s all have our meals.\u201d</p><br/><p>Without caring for others, he led Yao Si out, while continuously checking the time .</p><br/><p>When they were finally alone, he gravely said, \u201cYour Highness, I hope you won\u2019t take it to heart. Bai Yi is still young and has always been playful.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d Wasn\u2019t it just a casual remark?</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, You Highness, I will definitely keep your identity under wraps. No one will know about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si stilled. \u201cWho told you I wanted to keep it a secret?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI understand, even though it can be difficult since His Majesty is so remarkable, what\u2014 Huh? What did you just say?\u201d He turned abruptly toward her, almost hitting a wall. \u201cYou-you-you had no intentions to hide your identity?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYea!\u201d She was totally fine with everyone knowing she was a bloodling.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen\u2026 Then why didn\u2019t you enter high school directly but instead joined the elementary school?\u201d he asked with wide eyes. \u201cWasn\u2019t it to experience life?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEr\u2026\u201d She coughed awkwardly. \u201c\u2026 Let\u2019s leave my identity a secret!\u201d She was never going to admit applying for the exam.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Your Highness!\u201d</p>\n</div>"}

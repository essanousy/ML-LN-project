We are a welcoming bunch.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious, the scenery is beautiful. You won\u2019t get to see anything better in the entire Galaxy. Once you have seen it, you won\u2019t ever want to leave.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t we do some shopping in Eternal Brilliance? The last time I went, there were many new arrivals, so you could try them out.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t lack clothes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow about the robot competition? Sisi, didn\u2019t you specialize in robot previously? You would definitely like it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLian Yu\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow about that? How about it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si exhaled. \u201cWhy don\u2019t\u2026 you come down from the window first?\u201d She had been leaning against it for such a long time, so shouldn\u2019t be getting tired? It was the fourth floor!</p><br/><p>And she didn\u2019t have a habit of talking to someone through a window.</p><br/><p>\u201cSisi\u2026\u201d The queen\u2019s face fell instantly, and she complained pitifully, \u201cThe defence of your house has been upgraded again and I can\u2019t go in! It wasn\u2019t easy for me to climb to such a height, either.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can use the front door!\u201d Was there a need to climb the window?!</p><br/><p>\u201cI would like to!\u201d Her expression turned even more pitiful than before. \u201cThat bastard Mu won\u2019t let me in. Sisi, you have no idea how much effort it took me to see you, so are you sure you won\u2019t go out with me? Five minutes would be enough.\u201d</p><br/><p>The corners of Yao Si\u2019s lips twitched. <em>Would I still be able to come back once I leave this place?</em></p><br/><p>She had never expected for her absurd ability to be able to take things so far, causing Lian Yu to fall in love with her to such an extent. Regardless of the number of rejections, she remained persistent and enthusiastic in her chase. Moreover, it wasn\u2019t her appearance that Lian Yu had fallen for but her soul.</p><br/><p>After she had explained the situation, Lian Yu immediately accepted her change into a man, dumping Lin Long without a moment\u2019s hesitation. If it wasn\u2019t for Mu Xuan, she would have dragged Yao Si to impregnating herself the next second.</p><br/><p>After they returned from the royal aves planet, they immediately swapped their bodies back.</p><br/><p>Lian Yu remained faithful even after that, clinging onto her like a chewing gum, appearing everywhere she went. After several failed proposal attempts, Lian Yu ventured into other seduction methods, and there were several times when she had actually managed to succeed. Before Yao Si could even respond, she had been dragged out of the Red Planet, and they had reached as far as the outer edge of the star domain one of such \u2018dates\u2019.</p><br/><p>Her actions were driving two people crazy: one being Lin Long and the other Mu Xuan.</p><br/><p>Yao Si could sense the tension in him recently as he defended her from Lian Yu. He deported her out of the Red Planet and wouldn\u2019t let go of Yao Si\u2019s hand whenever they left the house. Every time an aves was to pass them, he repeatedly checked to make sure that Yao Si was still beside him.</p><br/><p>Despite his efforts, Lian Yu still managed to catch hold of Yao Si after wrecking her brain for a while. The number of excuses she made up was enough to circle the Red Planet several times.</p><br/><p>As Lin Long\u2019s contractor, Lian Yu and her entire race were protected from being killed as pure breeds would always instinctively avoid harming another bloodling\u2019s contractor.</p><br/><p>\u201cSisi, don\u2019t you like me? Even a little bit?\u201d Lian Yu\u2019s voice sank. She seemed on the verge of tears yet struggling to keep it in as she bit down her lip. \u201cI just wanted\u2026 wanted to treat you a little better, see you a little more, talk to you more\u2026 Can\u2019t you agree to this tiny request of mine?</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t agree!\u201d Yao Si shook her head resolutely, without a hint of pity. \u201cBesides, it\u2019s the 36th time I\u2019ve heard this.\u201d <em>Couldn\u2019t you change your words at least? </em> The last time she had agreed to her request, she ended up leaving the Red Planet.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright!\u201d The queen retracted her pitiful expression instantly and sighed deeply. \u201cSince i love you so much, it\u2019s fine if you don\u2019t want to go out! I have thought it through and decided that love is acceptance. If you really like him, then\u2026 I\u2019ll accept your relationship with him.\u201d She sniffed, struggling to look optimistic. \u201cThis time, I actually came to bid my last farewell.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFarewell?\u201d Yao Si stilled, startled.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m the aves queen after all, it wouldn\u2019t look good for me to leave for such a long time. I intend to head back to the royal aves planet, and I won\u2019t disrupt you anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si inspected her closely. Even though she wasn\u2019t entirely convinced, she couldn\u2019t help loosening up. \u201cIt\u2019s good that you have figured things out.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMmh, I hope you will be blissful.\u201d Her eyes reddened as she stared straight at Yao Si. It looked as thought she was trying to engrave her every feature into her heart. After half a minute, she tapped a screen open and sent something over to Yao Si. \u201cThis is the Red Planet\u2019s emigration form. As the lady of the bloodlings, could you personally fill up this form as a last farewell to end off this unrequited love of mine.\u201d</p><br/><p>Her voice lowered with every word as though she was struggling to suppress an immense sorrow, and it sent guilt roiling through Yao Si. She sighed deeply and succumbed to her pleas. \u201cAlright!\u201d</p><br/><p>She tapped open her optical computer, and a red application form came through with am accept option at the side. Just as she was about to click on it, her heart skipped a beat as the many kidnappings during the past four months flashed past her eyes.</p><br/><p>Based on her experience, nothing was as it seemed, so she took a closer look at the application form. It was only when she found the words \u2018Red Planet Emigration Application Form\u2019 at the top of the form that she finally eased up.</p><br/><p>But the form seemed to encompass bloodling traits, being a very festive red color\u2026</p><br/><p><em>Wait a minute, festive? </em></p><br/><p>That wasn\u2019t right! In the past few months, Lian Yu had always entered the Red Planet through a space portal opened up by Lin Long, so there wasn\u2019t any need for the emigration form.</p><br/><p>Yao Si lifted her head, and Lian Yu who had been staring at her intently grimaced. \u201cLian Yu, is this\u2026 perhaps a marriage registration form?\u201d</p><br/><p>The queen froze slightly before regaining her composure. She blinked before breaking into a sincere smile. \u201cHehehe\u2026 how could that be? Sisi, believe me, this is an ordinary emigration form. Hurry and sign it!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Don\u2019t your words make it even more extraordinary?!</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Ball!\u201d Yao Si turned to call for her responsible intelligent defense system No.27. She pointed toward the application form and asked, \u201cScan this for me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAt your service my dearest mother!\u201d Little Ball flew over and beeped twice after scanning her optical computer. In less than two seconds, he continued, \u201cThe scan shows that the document has been altered, dearest mother. Do you want Little Ball to restore it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRestore it!\u201d</p><br/><p>With another beep, the screen lit up, and the emigration form turned into a marriage registration form!</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Yao Si felt like puking blood at the absurdity of it!</p><br/><p>_(\u00b4\u0f40`\u300d\u2220)_</p><br/><p><em>I knew it!</em></p><br/><p>\u201cEh, I thought you would need a while more before finding out.\u201d Lian Yu\u2019s sorrow disappeared almost instantly, morphing into slight regret. \u201cIt\u2019s alright, I\u2019ll try again next time. I\u2019ll definitely marry you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere won\u2019t be a next time!\u201d</p><br/><p>A hostile voice spoke from behind Yao Si. Mu Xuan was back, and he looked up to glare at a certain someone who was lying against the window. There was someone else behind him, a man with a bruised nose, swollen face, and injuries all over his body\u2014it was a sour looking Lin Long.</p><br/><p>\u201cHeh, you\u2019re back so quickly.\u201d Lian Yu wasn\u2019t the least bit anxious. Instead, she glanced toward the time on her optical computer before turning to look at the battered Lin Long. \u201cEh, you managed to last for six minutes this time. Not bad at all, there\u2019s an improvement!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Long fell into a sight daze, his swollen face brightening as though he had heard heavenly news. \u201cReally? Xiao Yu\u2026 your happiness is all that matters.\u201d He forced out a smile, squeezing his face into a scary mess.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Mu Xuan.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Yao Si.</p><br/><p><em>What sort of odd pairing is this?!</em></p><br/><p>(\u256f\u2035\u25a1\u2032)\u256f\ufe35\u253b\u2501\u253b</p><br/><p>Yao Si finally witnessed the extent to which a pure blooding would indulge his contractor. The only reason Lian Yu could enter the Red Planet was because of Lin Long. There seemed to be something wrong with him, since he was obeying Lian Yu\u2019s every demand, which was was nothing akin to his previous shrewd personality. He was totally submissive to the point he disregarded his own morals.</p><br/><p>For the past few months, one of them would be tasked to divert Mu Xuan\u2019s attention while the other would be in charge of kidnapping Yao Si. Once in a while, they would engage in a mixed battle, which showcased their chemistry. Even though Lin Long would be bitter the entire process, he would endure it, obediently indulging Lian Yu. With just a praise from her, a smile would blossom on his face.</p><br/><p>\u201cSisi, you have to believe that I\u2019m the one that loves you the most. Wait for me, I\u2019ll come back\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Before she could complete her sentence, Mu Xuan had already slammed the button to shut the blinds. With a loud thud, Lian Yu fell from the window, and Lin Long disappeared as well.</p><br/><p>Needless to say, he had went to pick her up.</p></div>\n</div>"}

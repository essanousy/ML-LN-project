The fog started to thicken.</p><br/><p><em>What\u2019s with the weather? </em></p><br/><p>Yao Si started to wander around aimlessly, hoping to walk her way out or find someone with reception. However, the fog was far too vast, keeping her trapped even after walking for thirty minutes.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, two columns of orange lights flashed ahead. Were those street lamps? Yao Si headed toward them. Miraculously, the fog started to dissipate, thinning out slowly.</p><br/><p>After about ten minutes, the fog disappeared entirely, and an ancient-looking house appeared. At the front of it were two exaggerated golden words \u2013 Rainbow Pond!</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si\u2019s lips twitched. <em>Were they even bringing customers here forcefully?! First was the odd lucky draws, then the street lights. Couldn\u2019t they accept that she just didn\u2019t want to take a bath?!</em></p><br/><p>Just as she was about to lament out loud, the two gigantic doors swung open. They were the kind whose top one couldn\u2019t see even if they lifted their heads up. Mist that was engulfed in celestial aura and water droplets gushed out instantly.</p><br/><p>\u201cWelcome,\u201d a sweet-sounding electronic voice said as a green luminous glow lit up in front of Yao Si. The next moment, a green arrow pointing to the left side appeared. \u201cDearest customer, please come in!\u201d</p><br/><p><em>Is this their way of welcoming customers? </em>As expected of a galactic bath, even employees weren\u2019t necessary.</p><br/><p>Yao Si glanced at her optical computer once again, but there was still no reception. She turned to take another look behind, but the thick fog was going to make locating Mu Xuan and the others hard\u2026</p><br/><p>In the end, she followed the arrow in. The moment she entered the gates, the scenery changed, sending her into a pleasant countryside with green hills and clear water. She was surrounded by unfamiliar mythical flora, fauna, and geothermal baths of various sizes. It wasn\u2019t like a bathhouse but rather a celestial ground.</p><br/><p>It was indeed worthy of being the signature product of a luxury planet. The refurbishments\u2026 With just a glance Yao Si could imagine their hefty cost. Strangely, there wasn\u2019t a soul in sight, not even a single employee. The tiny arrow changed direction, pointing toward a small path to the right.</p><br/><p>Yao Si continued following the arrow, making a few turns before reaching a house. A sign lit up at the side: Phoenix Pond (Extremely luxurious).</p><br/><p>The house wasn\u2019t big, but it was much more exquisite when compared to the others she had passed. It was probably equivalent to the presidential suite of a hotel. Yao Si circled the exterior. Even though she had money, the most crucial thing was to first figure out her surroundings. It was eerily quiet and there didn\u2019t seem to be anyone inside. After some thought, she decided to walk around in hope of meeting an employee.</p><br/><p>The moment she turned, her gaze blurred, and a row of arrows pointing toward the house appeared in front of her, obstructing her passage. The familiar reminder sounded once more: Dearest customer, please come in! Dearest customer, please come in!</p><br/><p>Er\u2026</p><br/><p>Why does it feel like a trap was lying within?</p><br/><p>Yao Si had no intention of entering.</p><br/><p>Disregarding the arrows, she headed toward the little path on the side. But after five minutes\u2026 she was back at the house.</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t want to succumb to fate and turned toward another pathway, but regardless of which path she took, she still ended up at the same spot. Even the original path she had come from led her to the same house.</p><br/><p><em>F*ck! </em></p><br/><p>She glanced at the exquisite little house. <em>Forget it. </em>Even if it was a trap, it would be better than the pointless walking around. With gritted teeth, Yao Si entered the house.</p><br/><p>The interior was different from the scenic exterior outside, for there was only one huge bubbling hot bath inside. Flower petals of every color covered the surface, and there was the sound of water dripping.</p><br/><p><em>Eh, there\u2019s someone! </em></p><br/><p>On closer inspection, there was a half-submerged person about three meters into the bath. The person had snowy white skin and a head full of long black hair, so it was most likely a woman.</p><br/><p>Yao Si heaved a sigh of relief; she had finally met someone.</p><br/><p>\u201cExcuse me\u2014\u201d</p><br/><p>She was about to ask about the situation when the woman suddenly turned and let out a shrill scream. \u201cAhh!\u201d She hurriedly hugged her bosom with both hands, burying herself deeper into the water, her face filled with utter shock.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d <em>What\u2019s with this situation?</em></p><br/><p>\u201cYou-you-you dare to peak at me when I\u2019m bathing!\u201d As the woman covered herself with a towel that seemed to have magically appeared, she pointed at Yao Si with trembling fingers. \u201cToo much!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEr\u2026\u201d Yao Si was appalled. <em>Who wanted to peak at you? </em> \u201cYou misunderstood, I\u2019m a customer\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The woman began sobbing. \u201cHow am I supposed to face anyone now?\u201d She completely disregarded Yao Si\u2019s explanation and wept with a hand over her face. \u201cNow that you have seen my body, there\u2026 there is no way I\u2019ll be able to get married.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEr\u2026\u201d Was there such a conservative race in the Galaxy?</p><br/><p>\u201cIn order to uphold my innocence, I-I can\u2026 only marry you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?!\u201d Yao Si was startled. How the hell had the situation escalated to that?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy? Do you not intend to take responsibility for your misdoings?\u201d The woman\u2019s face filled with rage.</p><br/><p>\u201cResponsibility? B-but I\u2019m a woman too!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with being a woman? Can you bully others just because you\u2019re a woman?\u201d She glared at Yao Si before breaking into another crying fit. Her eyes seemed like an endless tap that kept pouring tears out. \u201cI don\u2019t care! Now that you have seen my body, you are mine. From today onwards, I\u2019ll follow you to the ends of the world.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Was it another forceful scam?</p><br/><p>\u201cI have a background, so I\u2019ll have to discuss with my family members before O can marry you. But you won\u2019t have to wait long, we can set the ceremony\u2026 three days later!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know I\u2019m pretty and have a likeable personality so there isn\u2019t anyone in the Galaxy that isn\u2019t mesmerized by me, but you don\u2019t have to be upset. Since I married you, I will be loyal.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI understand that we don\u2019t have a strong foundation, but don\u2019t worry, I will try my best to fall for you so there won\u2019t be any form of barrier. If you wish to do more\u2026 intimate things, I won\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd\u2026 since we are going to be wed, you will have to treat me well! You will have to end all relationships with the stray flowers outside and you will be forbidden from looking at guys, even if they are of your race. Those from Yao or bloodlings are all forbidden.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter registering, we can head over to the Dreamy Planet on Galactic 27 which is part of my property. The scenery is good and the place is calming, and no one will be able to find us\u2026 Err, I mean it\u2019s the most suitable location for a honeymoon.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s more, there\u2019s more, we can\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSis! Were you reading a lot of novels just now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot a lot, just two or three!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh.\u201d <em>I get it. </em>\u201cLian Yu?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMmh,\u201d the woman hummed instinctively.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Yao Si.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Lian Yu.</p><br/><p>The air went still.</p><br/><p><em>Oh lord! </em>It really was the aves queen!</p><br/><p>-_-|||</p><br/><p>\u201cYou-you found out?\u201d Lian Yu\u2019s face paled instantly, her guilt apparent.</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe!\u201d Was it that hard? She was probably the only person in the entire Galaxy who wanted to marry her this much.</p><br/><p>\u201cSisi\u2026\u201d Lian Yu seemed to be on the verge of tears. She abandoned her act and tugged onto Yao Si pitifully. \u201cThen\u2026 then do you still want to marry me? Can I marry you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Yao Si withdrew her hands.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d The queen\u2019s eyes started to water once more. \u201cIsn\u2019t it stated in bloodling books that as long as a party\u2019s body have been seen, marriage will be necessary? It took me a lot of effort to steal this information from the bloodling museum, so I don\u2019t think I got it wrong. Why don\u2019t you\u2026 take a few more looks?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lian Yu started to unravel the towel.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait a moment!\u201d The corners of Yao Si\u2019 lips twitched as she stopped the queen mid-action. <em>What kind of books were you looking at?! </em> \u201cWe are both women, so devoting oneself doesn\u2019t count!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?\u201d Lian Yu stilled. She tapped open a screen, and she started to read intently.</p><br/><p>The title of the book flashed at the top of the screen: Bloodling poetic saga information, literature. \u201cThe Barbaric Lord\u2019s Little Wife\u201d, \u201cLord, Treat Me with Care\u201d, \u201cThe Evil Ruler Chases the Wife 101 Times\u201d.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>(\u256f\u2035\u25a1\u2032)\u256f\ufe35\u253b\u2501\u253b</p><br/><p><em>What the f*ck? What exactly is kept in the bloodling museum?</em></p></div>\n</div>"}

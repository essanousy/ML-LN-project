With a flash of light, he was sent back to the revival point.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Yao Si.</p><br/><p>[Ding! The only savior in the battle against the demonic dragon is player *#38. By a stroke of luck, Celestial Han Yue has decided on you to devote herself to you! Entering marriage altar in 5\u20264\u20263\u2026]</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Wasn\u2019t it a little too fast?</p><br/><p>Wait a moment! Why were the other two honorable warriors while she was a lucky survivor? One who had survived only due to a stroke of luck\u2026 How could the system despise the low-leveled players so much? And what do you mean by the hidden name? Show it clearly!]</p><br/><p>Besides, what was Mu Xuan\u2019s gender in the system? Is same gender marriage even allowed?</p><br/><p>Before Yao Si could raise her complaints, the scenery changed\u2014the field of flowers turned into a spacious area that was covered in red with the large word \u201cHappiness\u201d engraved on the wall.</p><br/><p>Other than Mu Xuan who was clothed in red, there wasn\u2019t a single soul in sight.</p><br/><p>[Ding! Location locked in, please proceed with the wedding ceremony.]</p><br/><p>Another mission popped into Yao Si\u2019s mission folder: A Joyous Union.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>What just happened? The storyline had escalated before she could process the situation. How did it become a wedding between her and Mu Xuan?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere is this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt should be an individual map in the game.\u201d Mu Xuan seemed calm for their current predicament. He took a glance outside the house\u2014it was completely white there.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat should we do?\u201d Yao Si switched on the system menu, but it was still on lockdown mode. \u201cDo we really have to go through the ceremony to leave this place?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2026 should be right.\u201d He nodded.</p><br/><p>Yao Si stiffened before anxiety started to engulf her.</p><br/><p>Wedding?! With Mu Xuan?!</p><br/><p>\u03a3(\u00b0\u25b3\u00b0|||)\ufe34</p><br/><p>She turned toward him, accidentally meeting his gaze, and lightning flashed as flames blazed. She could feel something about to erupt, then they both averted their eyes in unison.</p><br/><p>Yao Si\u2019s heart started to race. Maybe due to the silence, she could even hear her own heartbeat.</p><br/><p>How did the face she had been so comfortable looking at push her heart into such a frenzy?!</p><br/><p><em>Stay calm. Stay calm. This is just a game.</em></p><br/><p>She coughed, inhaling a deep breath before tugging on his sleeve. \u201cMu Xuan\u2026 Should we\u2026 attempt the mission?\u201d</p><br/><p>Was it a hallucination? Was Mu Xuan having an allergic reaction now too? Is the game that realistic?</p><br/><p>\u201cMmh.\u201d Mu Xuan agreed softly before giving a decisive nod a second later. \u201cYes!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go through the wedding then!\u201d Yao Si then pulled him toward the big \u2018Happiness\u2019 sign on the wall, and the next part of instructions was announced.</p><br/><p>[First, bow to the Heavens and Earth!]</p><br/><p>[Second, bow to the parents!]</p><br/><p>[Third, bow to each other!]</p><br/><p>They followed the instructions and completed the three bows, but still, the mission wasn\u2019t completed.</p><br/><p>[Enter the bridal chamber!]</p><div class=\"bggls5c9a91934ece2\"></div><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Eh, does it have to be so realistic?</p><br/><p>Their surroundings changed once more, and they were now sitting on a large bed embroidered with the word \u2018Happiness\u2019.</p><br/><p>[The groom can kiss the bride!]</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>What kind of western oriental fusion was this? When did an oriental wedding have a kiss the bride segment?</p><br/><p>But if they didn\u2019t complete the mission, they couldn\u2019t leave the game! Yao Si took a peek at Mu Xuan. He seemed to be shocked into a daze by the instruction as he sat stiffly, the flush on his neck spreading up toward his face.</p><br/><p>Yao Si\u2019s felt her heart warm. Was he perhaps\u2026 not having an allergic reaction, but rather\u2026 blushing?</p><br/><p>Was Mu Xuan\u2026 embarrassed?</p><br/><p>She felt a buzzing in her head. Without much thought, she blurted, \u201cShould I give you a few\u2026 pecks?\u201d It wasn\u2019t like they hadn\u2019t kissed.</p><br/><p>He visibly froze, his face still devoid of any emotion. After half a minute, he spoke in a low voice. \u201cMmh.\u201d It was such a calm response, as though it was just the normal kissing and hugging request, but on closer inspection, his entire upper body had flushed deep red.</p><br/><p>It looked\u2026 adorable!</p><br/><p>(\u2299_\u2299)</p><br/><p>Yao Si\u2019s face went red as well, and her heart thumped so rapidly she wondered if it would jump out from her chest. Even though she was anxious, a sudden impulse overtook her. Without hesitation, she pounced on him like a wolf on an unsuspecting sheep, her paws clinging onto his sides. His familiar face was tainted with an unfamiliar shade, his features magnified. She wanted to\u2026 ravage him!</p><br/><p>Wait a minute! What was she doing? Forcing him into surrender? What happened to being pure?!</p><br/><p>But\u2026 this wasn\u2019t their first kiss. He had kissed her before. Besides, Mu Xuan\u2019s expression seemed as though\u2026 he wanted to be ravaged by her!</p><br/><p>She was hungry! She had to be brave if she wanted to be fed!</p><br/><p>Hence\u2026 she lowered her head to press her lips onto his. They were soft and tender, a stark contrast to his frosty and emotionless face. Static seemed to flow through their lips, motivating her to shower him with more light kisses.</p><br/><p>Maybe it was time for advancement in their relationship.</p><br/><p>\u201cSisi\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Just as she was about to stand, Mu Xuan suddenly reached out to pull her back down. With a move from him, their positions switched. The next second, his lips came crashing against hers. His kiss wasn\u2019t a tiny peck like hers, but passionate and domineering as though he wanted to swallow her whole. It was even a touch frenzied, but not frightening, gradually slowing down to become tender and lingering.</p><br/><p>Yao Si went blank, all thoughts disappearing as she started to space out.</p><br/><p>Someone had to have ended the kiss for they started panting uncontrollably, their bodies separated. Even then, their breaths were intertwined. The flush on Mu Xuan\u2019s face was swiftly replaced by a passion that seemed\u2026 incredibly tempting.</p><br/><p>\u201cShould we\u2026 complete another mission,\u201d she blurted out.</p><br/><p>His breathing turned ragged, the faded flush inching back upwards.</p><br/><p>\u201cMmh.\u201d</p><br/><p>Their lips joined once more, lacking the recklessness from before, but with an added emotion. A flame burned in Yao Si\u2019s heart, and its heat anxiously sought solace, prompting her wandering hands to his back until\u2026</p><br/><p>[Ding! Players violated the rules! Both player *#38 and Mu Xuan985425531 will have their accounts frozen!

Thank You!]</p><br/><p>The next moment, they were kicked out by the system.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Yao Si.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Mu Xuan.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d The two munching on pills at the revival point.</p><br/><p><em>Your Majesty, Your Highness, what exactly were you guys doing in there?</em></p></div>\n</div>"}

It wasn\u2019t!\u201d He shook his head violently, bolting up in agitation. \u201cHow could I have created such a monstrous virus?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen why?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause\u2026 Because\u2026\u201d He struggled to find the words, opening his mouth several times, but nothing came out. Maniacally, he started to mutter, \u201cI-I-I didn\u2019t want to betray the bloodlings. I didn\u2019t want to! Didn\u2019t want to!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFourth Elder?\u201d Yao Si\u2019s heart sank; something wasn\u2019t right there. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>He completely disregarded her, as though her words didn\u2019t reach him. Taking a step back, he stumbled a few times, stood up, and retreated back once more. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to, I didn\u2019t want to\u2026 But, they wanted to\u2026 Psh!\u201d Before he could finish his sentence, he suddenly spat a mouthful of blood.</p><br/><p>\u201cFourth Elder!\u201d Yao Si shouted, slamming the emergency alarm. The other Elders and Bai Yi, who she had requested for specifically, came rushing over. Once they saw what had happened, it shocked them into a daze.</p><br/><p>\u201cFourth Elder\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHurry up, open the doors!\u201d Yao Si pointed toward the laser gates in front.</p><br/><p>The Elders were immediately alerted and switched off the laser gates in the cell; however, Fourth Elder who had been trapped inside was already drenched in blood.</p><br/><p>\u201cFourth Elder, are you alright?\u201d Yao Qian stepped forward to support him. \u201cWhat happened here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHurry! Send him to the medical room,\u201d Yao Si ordered them.</p><br/><p>Just as Yao Qian was about to reach for him, Fourth Elder pushed him away. \u201cIt\u2019s okay! It\u2019s useless\u2026 useless. Your Highness! Your Highness\u2026\u201d He reached out to grab her with a death grip while struggling to speak. \u201cYou must be careful, they\u2014\u201d</p><br/><p>Before he could finish the sentence, another wave of blood came rushing out of his mouth.</p><br/><p>He\u2026 couldn\u2019t speak!</p><br/><p>\u201cFourth Elder, stop talking.\u201d Yao Si turned toward the person beside her. \u201cBai Yi, use your ability.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026 Oh!\u201d Bai Yi stilled momentarily, then activated his ability.</p><br/><p>Lord of Subtitles activated right away, but unlike all the other times, the message was short, containing only one sentence.</p><br/><p>[Your Highness, please be careful!]</p><br/><p>She couldn\u2019t seem to decipher the meaning behind the sentence. Fourth Elder grabbed onto her hands, but he was too weak and they slipped away. That was the last thing he did, leaving a glaring splash of fresh blood on Yao Si\u2019s arms.</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>Fourth Elder sank into eternal hibernation, which was quite unexpected. Yao Si had a suspicion that he was trying to warn her about something, but somehow he wasn\u2019t able to name it. And last but not least, what did his last sentence asking her to be careful mean?</p><br/><p>Was she Euphoria\u2019s next target?</p><br/><p>Fourth Elder\u2019s eternal hibernation was incomprehensible: he seemed to be all right one moment, and was gone the next. No one knew the reason behind his eternal hibernation, and even Mu Xuan couldn\u2019t figure it out.</p><br/><p>Yao Si felt a chill inching up her spine. The problem of Euphoria was starting to get increasingly complex. Every time they came closer to a thread, it seemed to be cut off instantly. It was like a shadow. Even though one knew it was around, they didn\u2019t seem able to catch hold of it.</p><br/><p>Fourth Elder\u2019s betrayal was kept a secret, and a grand funeral was held in his memory. Yao Si could understand the reason for it. First, it was to ensure that the enemy would not be alerted and hide even deeper. Also, since Fourth Elder was already dead, there was no need to pursue the matter any longer.</p><br/><p>\u201cDoes Fourth Elder have a cub?\u201d Yao Si asked suddenly.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Yao Qian shook his head. \u201cThe bloodling after him was formed through inheritance. He once had a mentor, but that was a very long time ago\u2026 He once mentioned that his mentor belonged to the last batch of earthlings.\u201d</p><br/><p>Earthling?</p><br/><p>Was that the reason behind his research craze\u2014to allow clones to gain sentience? He probably wanted earthlings to return to the Galaxy.</p><br/><p>But all clues ended there, with Yuan Han being the last source. But Yao Si didn\u2019t hold much hope for Yuan Han. Besides, according to the information that Yao Qian had obtained, Yuan Han wasn\u2019t very well informed. Even the doomsday virus he had obtained was from a stranger through the Galactic web. All that person had told him was that it would be useful in helping him defeat the bloodlings. After that, he signed with Euphoria and didn\u2019t ask any more questions.</p><br/><p>On the other hand, the reasons for Yuan Han\u2019s hatred for bloodlings was hilarious.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think I\u2019m not aware of your disgusting motives. You just want to turn me into a bloodling!\u201d Yuan Han glared at her with disgust as though he would fight to his death against her. \u201cI\u2019m an earthling, the last one standing. Even so, I would rather die than become one of you, a blood-sucking monster.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Yao Si replied emotionlessly. It was starting to get funny. Where did he get his knowledge about bloodlings from?</p><br/><p>Yao Si continued to humor him, before retrieving all his information from Heavenly Bestowed Yard and having it flash in front of him. His reaction started with disdain, then turned to suspicion, before ending with disbelief and a slight craze.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, it can\u2019t be true, how can I be a clone? You must be lying, you are definitely lying!\u201d He waved his hands in distress, trying to push the screen away. Suddenly, he was reminded of something, biting down on his lip, he pointed at himself. \u201cI traveled through time to come into this time, I\u2019m a real human. Don\u2019t you dare to trick me into thinking otherwise. Justice shall prevail!\u201d</p><br/><p>Justice? Stop trying to drag justice\u2019s name down the drain. You\u2019re just a child!</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to believe.\u201d Yao Si straightened. She would rather head home for dinner than talk to such an ignorant person. \u201cOh right! I forgot to mention, we have never eaten human blood. All we eat is duck blood curd!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si finally understood his hatred toward bloodlings. He had woken up and gained sentience in Heavenly Bestowed Yard. Moreover, he possessed memories of an earthling that hated vampires. He must have known that he was going to get converted, and it triggered memories of blood-sucking vampires from movies the earthling had watched. His resentment then morphed into the unwillingness to get converted, forcing him into his escape.</p><br/><p>Basically\u2026</p><br/><p>#TooManyMovies + #VictimParanoia.</p><br/><p>What was even more hilarious was that even though he escaped and spent five years in the Galaxy, he didn\u2019t learn anything about the bloodling race! Or was he actually aware but chose to live in denial, preferring to rely on the memories of the earthling?</p><br/><p>He certainly has an extremely inflated ego!</p><br/><p>\u201cImpossible, you must be lying. You\u2019re all blood-sucking monsters, how can you not suck human blood!\u201d Yuan Han bellowed, seemingly trying to convince himself rather than her. \u201cI\u2019m not wrong, I was just trying to protect myself. I just didn\u2019t want to turn into a monster.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can rest assured.\u201d Yao Si stopped in her tracks, turning to sweep a glance at him. \u201cRegardless of whether it\u2019s the past or present, no one has any intention of converting you into a bloodling.\u201d Fourth Elder was interested simply because he was the only clone that had gained awareness.</p><br/><p>Ever since the beginning, no one had the intention of forcing him to become a bloodling; it had always been his one-sided assumption.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs for the future\u2026\u201d Yao Si inhaled deeply. \u201cI assure you with my status as a fifth generation bloodling that I will never let you become any bloodling\u2019s cub. You would only be dragging the average bloodling intelligence down!\u201d</p><br/><p>Countless people in the Galaxy want to become bloodlings, and do you think we care? Bloodlings can be picky as well! They were particular about the earthlings they converted since millions of years ago, so why would they touch human blood?</p><br/><p>\u201cYou-you\u2026\u201d Yuan Han was left speechless, his face pale with disbelief.</p><br/><p>Cherish your life, avoid ignorance.</p><br/><p>Yao Si ignored a certain someone who seemed to be left in shock and turned to head home. As for his punishment, it would be in Yao Qian\u2019s hands. She was more worried about the Galactic account that had provided him with the doomsday virus.</p><br/><p>When everything calmed down, she got Bai Yi to track the account, but nothing came up. Euphoria had vanished once again.</p><br/><p>A strong sense of threat started to cloud Yao Si\u2019s senses. This time, it wasn\u2019t just about the bloodlings\u2014it was primarily concerned with her own well-being!</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>In a blink of an eye, it was time for school yet again.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat, you guys are graduating?\u201d Yao Si exclaimed in shock when she saw the two who had been waiting for her at the school gates.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Nephew Gu nodded, turning toward the bashful Luo Ying beside him. Their hands were tightly clasped together. \u201cYour Highness, we have decided to graduate this semester before going on a holiday.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, how long are you going to be away?\u201d Honeymoon. She understood.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe aren\u2019t sure yet.\u201d Nephew Gu shook his head. \u201cI have already made the arrangements. In the future, you can call us for matters you need help on. Also, I have already planned out the student committee\u2019s duties, so you don\u2019t have to worry. Various department heads will tend to the minor matters.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs for the others, the bloodlings in the committee will solve it, so you won\u2019t be inconvenienced. Since Bai Yi is rather well versed in the Galactic web and information matters, you can hand him the issues such as the machine competition and other liaising jobs that deal with other academies. Also\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He rambled on continuously, tying up the loose ends as he operated the optical computer and sending her a bunch of information. Basically, he had arranged everything so that she could continue to wield power without having to do anything. His understanding of her personality was immaculate. She should really pay him wages!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

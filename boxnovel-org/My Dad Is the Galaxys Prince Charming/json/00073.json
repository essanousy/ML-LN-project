Gu Shucheng had mentioned that they were the most knowledgeable about the control of mental strength, and the Shadow Planet she was heading to specialized in the training of mental strength.</p><br/><p>In the past, Yan Xuan had once told her that celestials used their abilities to their fullest potential. They weren\u2019t like the other races that focused on advancing their technology; their strengths lay on a different path.</p><br/><p>Celestials used their own abilities in place of technology when they traveled with their swords. Even the ship that Yao Si was coming on was different\u2014it was really a ship.</p><br/><p>Indeed, it was exactly like the ancient wooden ships, which was propelled by a blurry figure the celestials called a formation. Despite the ship\u2019s appearance, its speed rivaled the technology-based ones in the Galaxy.</p><br/><p>In less than an hour, Yao was reached her destination. She caressed the necklace Mu Xuan had given her. Inside it was a charm with a hint of his mental strength which could be used to influence the perception of others.</p><br/><p>Yao Si prepared herself before leaving the ship. She was certain the things outside would be like from some fantasy novel she\u2019d read in the past, totally unlike what she\u2019d seen so far. However, the moment she left the ship, she realized how inadequate her preparations had been.</p><br/><p>A woman dressed in an ancient outfit flew over and asked with a bright smile on her face, \u201cGood day, our valuable customer. I\u2019m the attendant that will be at your service during your stay. My identification number is 233. May I know if you\u2019re here to tour or to gain experience?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si frozed, caught off-guard by such a retro image, which was a stark contrast to the modern era they lived in. It felt as though she had entered a historical fantasy film.</p><br/><p>\u201cGai-gain experience!\u201dYao Si replied unnaturally.</p><br/><p>\u201cI see.\u201d Attendant 233\u2019s welcoming smile did not waver. \u201cAll right, please give me a moment, your personal VIP seat will be brought over right away. It\u2019ll punctually deliver you to your destination .\u201d With a wave, the aide plucked a cloud from the side.</p><br/><p><em>This is too much to handle! </em></p><br/><p>This region was completely different from the rest. It was entirely white, and the surroundings were filled with celestial energy. At times, you could catch a hint of ancient-looking architecture among the flowing marshmallow-like clouds. The majority of the clouds were white, but some possessed other colors. The cloud attendant 233 plucked was a rainbow one.</p><br/><p>\u201cTake a seat.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAl-alright!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si reached out for a touch and found that it was rather soft, quite similar to the transparent children seat she had sat on in the past.</p><br/><p>Once she was seated, attendant 233 started to move about, bringing a bunch of documents over and explaining the culture and background of the celestial race.</p><br/><p>\u201cMissus, this must be the first time you entered the lands of the celestials, am I right? Let me tell you, our lands are extremely beautiful. There is a total of 811 planets, each with such heavenly views I swear you\u2019ll never want to leave. Others aside, take a look at the Immortal Planet, it\u2019s the third planet and is filled with various unique sights that have not been tainted by mankind. Moreover, they\u2019re having a promotion at the moment, with the group price of just 998 galactic currency. If you\u2019re interested, I could offer up additional offers.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si\u2019s expression froze. How could such a spiritual celestial introduce a tour package in such a way?! \u201cDo celestials prioritize tourism over gaining experience?\u201d</p>\n</div>"}

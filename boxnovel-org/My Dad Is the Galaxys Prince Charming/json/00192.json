He lowered his head to plant a surprise kiss on Li Zheng\u2019s hand he was still holding.</p><br/><p>Li Zheng was visibly distressed, his entire being trembling in shock. He bounced backwards instantly, dashing straight behind Yao Si. Gritting his teeth, he grabbed the edges of her shirt in a death grip. \u201cDad, he\u2019s a pervert!\u201d he shrieked as he rubbed the goosebumps on his arms.</p><br/><p>\u201cDad?\u201d Grand prince Yu Zhe stilled, then turned to glance at Yao Si. When it finally dawned on him, he made a deep bow, greeting her firmly without any hesitation. \u201cFather-in-law!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGet lost!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d The crowd.</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>Li Zheng was straight, absolutely straight, or he wouldn\u2019t have hit it off with the wife crazy Bai Yi. To hear a confession from a guy who also happened to be his enemy was definitely devastating for him. According to Bai Yi, Li Zheng vomited for three whole hours and scrubbed his hand five times after he returned. Yao Si and the others were regretful and sympathetic, but\u2026 they stood firm in their request for him to sacrifice himself.</p><br/><p>\u256e(\u256f\u25bd\u2570)\u256d</p><br/><p>What a joke! How could they let such an amazing opportunity pass at such a stalemate!</p><br/><p>After Li Zheng was frightened off, Yu Zhe returned to his original uncooperative state. If he hadn\u2019t been trying to pry about Li Zheng every time Yao Si visited, she would have really wondered if he had identified the wrong contractor.</p><br/><p>Strangely, Li Zheng\u2019s attitude started to change at that time. Ever since he was converted, he had always been obedient, but this time, he would rather die than visit Yu Zhe at the prison cell. He continuously affirmed his sexual preferences, insisting on preserving his straight man\u2019s dignity.</p><br/><p>Everyone wasn\u2019t sure who was worse off, Li Zheng or Yu Zhe\u2026</p><br/><p>For the sake of the Galaxy\u2019s stability and world peace, Bai Yi volunteered to convince Li Zheng about his sexual preferences.\u2026 uhm, convince Li Zheng about his responsibilities!</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Your Highness, leave it to me. I\u2019ll make sure he\u2019ll be there tomorrow.\u201d Bai Yi tapped his chest with assurance, his smile confident.</p><br/><p>Yao Si ran her eyes over him before asking suspiciously, \u201cWhy does it seem like\u2026 you\u2019re particularly happy about Li Zheng being Yu Zhe\u2019s contractor?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEhem\u2026 we are eternal brothers, and I\u2019m happy that he finally managed to leave his singlehood.\u201d</p><br/><p><em>Er\u2026 is it something to be happy about?</em></p><br/><p>Bai Yi\u2019s smile shone with sincerity. \u201cI\u2019m really thinking for his sake. After he manages to leave singlehood, the fact that my application for a converted cub would jump in line by one applicant isn\u2019t that important, hahaha.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d <em>So that\u2019s your motive! You\u2019re going to sell your brother for a cub?</em></p><br/><p>Yao Si rubbed her temples. She really couldn\u2019t understand their brotherhood.</p><br/><p>But Bai Yi had to have said something to Li Zheng, since the very next day, he really came over with a stoic expression. Almost immediately after he entered the prison cell, the conceited Yu Zhe bolted upright from his chair, his eyes sparkling. \u201cAh Zheng, you\u2019re here.\u201d His tone was soft and tender.</p><br/><p>Li Zheng froze, his originally dark face starting to turn green. He pressed his palms tightly against his mouth as though on the verge of puking.</p><br/><p>Yu Zhe, the main culprit, immediately asked with concern, \u201cAre you alright? Is there anywhere you don\u2019t feel well? Why is your face so pale? Is there something wrong? Will you tell me? You\u2019re making me worried\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Zheng\u2019s green face darkened instantly, and his palms clenched into fists. His muscles tensed up when he turned to face Yao Si. He then forced a couple words through clenched teeth. \u201cDad, can I hit him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEr\u2026 <em>Cough, cough\u2026 </em> Keep calm, keep calm!\u201d She patted his shoulders casually, but was instantly faced with Yuzhe\u2019s displeased glare as though she had just touched his property.</p><br/><p><em>F*ck! Aren\u2019t I your father-in-law?</em></p><br/><p>\u201cEr, Yu Zhe, the person you\u2019re looking for is already here. Can you tell us now how to prevent the pure breeds from coming over?\u201d sheasked directly.</p><br/><p>Yu Zhe glanced at Li Zheng with loves truck eyes before turning to look at her. His face chilled slightly, but he replied. \u201cHeh! Haven\u2019t I already told you that even if the chances are slim, my race will still not give up on this universe? There isn\u2019t any way to stop the invasion, so all you can do is to reduce the impact.\u201d</p><br/><p>He strolled back to his chair as he explained, then scanned the others in the cell. \u201cAmong you people\u2026 only him can stand a chance.\u201d He pointed at Mu Xuan. \u201cIf my guess isn\u2019t wrong, he was in a weak state at the time of our battle, but even so, he managed to control my ability which is a rare sight.</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, even if he was at his best, he would only manage to stop two elder grand princes. There wouldn\u2019t be a fighting chance against the other fifty-three grand princes. Besides, there are countless other bloodlings. As for the,\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He smirked with disdain before turning back to face Yao Si. \u201cIncluding you, none of you guys would stand a chance. Even if your mental strength is incredible, there won\u2019t be enough time to activate it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Which meant that she was just a decoy!</p><br/><p>-_-|||</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you should give up. Once our army comes along, it\u2019ll be over.\u201d</p><br/><p>The mood went down instantly. They had never expected for the ending to be as such. Was the war really unavoidable?</p><br/><p>Based on Lin Long\u2019s past behavior and the disdain from Yu Zhe, maybe the first target after the invasion would really be their group.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs there\u2026 really no way?\u201d Li Zheng asked with a troubled expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is, there is, there is!\u201d Yu Zhe\u2019s eyes lit up instantly!</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Yao Si.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Mu Xuan.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Lin Long.</p><br/><p>Everyone felt an urge to curse!</p><br/><p>Was he doing it on purpose? Was he just trying to drag Li Zheng into the conversation?</p><br/><p>\u201cOthers might not have a solution, but I do!\u201d Yu Zhe\u2019s gaze burned with intensity as he stared at Li Zheng. \u201cAh Zheng, don\u2019t worry. Regardless of what happens, I will definitely protect you. You just have to\u2014\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShut up!\u201d Li Zheng\u2019s veins were about to burst, and he seemed on the verge of bashing the grand prince to a bloody pulp. \u201cSpeak, what idea do you have?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d <em>Cough, </em>according to my people\u2019s style, it would definitely not be easy for them to give up on this universe,\u201d he said gravely. \u201cMy late return would probably give them an idea of what happened, so it\u2019ll be at most three days before they run over to this world.</p><br/><p>\u201cEven though there is only half of the total population left, all the grand princes are around. Our race has always been aggressive and always obey the strong, so the only option is\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He scanned the crowd once more before pausing on Mu Xuan. He then articulated his next words very carefully. \u201cA fight for honor!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

Behind her, the crowd erupted into shrieks, startling her.</p><br/><p>\u201cAhahahahahha\u2026 It\u2019s his highness!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s real, the real, live, breathing kind!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh my goodness! It\u2019s really his highness, my lord, it\u2019s blinding\u2026 blinding!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBoth His Majesty and Her Highness is here, tell me if I\u2019m dreaming!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to take a photo, where\u2019s my optical computer? Can someone borrow me an optical computer?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAhahahahah\u2026 Ahahah\u2026 Ahah!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si was speechless.</p><br/><p><em>Aren\u2019t we all bloodlings, is there really a need for such a fuss?</em></p><br/><p><em>Besides\u2026 weren\u2019t you guys my fans just a minute ago? Such fickle fans!</em></p><br/><p>o(&gt;\ufe4f&lt;)o</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>Mu Xuan was indeed her father. His portal was of an entirely different level, and with just a tiny wave, a passageway to the Red Planet appeared. Probably for convenience\u2019s sake, it led to the Elder Council.</p><br/><p>Without a word, Mu Xuan threw the bunch of bloodlings to the Elders so they\u2019d settled everything and brought Yao Si home.</p><br/><p>After all the trouble, they were already more than an hour late for dinner. Yao Si had never been so late for dinner. She assumed that with Mu Xuan\u2019s personality, he would definitely force her onto a chair and push the duck blood curd down her throat.</p><br/><p>However, Mu Xuan acted out of character. After instructing her to have her meal, he completely disregarded her and sat down in the corner of the sofa with his optical computer. Even if she deliberately tried to attract his attention, he never once offered her a glance.</p><br/><p>His face remained distant and taut, his entire being emitting a menacing tension.</p><br/><p>Yao Si endured his cold aura.</p><br/><p>He was furious, and not just slightly! As an orphan with only the pathetic twenty years of experience, Yao Si had never once had to coax her parents. Without having any idea how that was supposed to be done, she wondered how she should proceed. <em>Person seeking help here! </em></p><br/><p>Yao Si kept all the pranks she could come up with to herself and finished the entire bowl of duck blood curd obediently. She even asked for an additional serving before daring to push the empty bowl back.</p><br/><p>\u201d <em>Cough\u2026 </em> Dad! I finished my meal.\u201d <em>Look, everything is gone! </em></p><br/><p>The man on the sofa completely disregarded her, keeping his focus on his optical computer as though she hadn\u2019t spoken.</p><br/><p><em>I have my grievances too! </em>He hadn\u2019t even bothered to correct the way she had called him\u2026 <em>He must really be infuriated\u2026 </em></p><br/><p>\u201cI was wrong.\u201d</p><br/><p>She let go of the bowl and came to stand formally at his side with her hands hanging low, a repentant look on her face.</p><br/><p>Mu Xuan fingers suddenly stopped; he was finally reacting. In a frosty tone, he asked, \u201cWhat did you do wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si froze. <em>Right, why </em>am <em>I in the wrong? </em> She had clearly done a good deed, one where even the Elders Council should owe her bonus! So why was Daddy Mu so angry?</p><br/><p>Mu Xuan took in a deep breath at her silence. He turned to glance at her, then spat out word by word, \u201cSisi, you\u2019re still just a cub!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh? I know that!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re aware?\u201d He frowned, the tension about him increasing. \u201cIf you knew, how could you have gone to such a dangerous place by yourself? I told you, your ability isn\u2019t stable yet, besides it has a passive nature. If there weren\u2019t any bloodlings in the base, do you really think you would have been able to come back safely?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEr\u2026\u201d He was speaking the truth. She couldn\u2019t argue with it. \u201cI was worried about Nephew Gu at that time, and the communication was cut off in both the ship and the research base, that\u2019s why\u2026 I did consider getting you! I swear!\u201d she said, raising her hands to prove her sincerity.</p>\n</div>"}

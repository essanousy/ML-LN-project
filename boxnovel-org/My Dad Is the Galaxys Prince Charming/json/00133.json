The playing that time was definitely a childhood trauma for her.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is the pressing matter you were referring to?\u201d He had dragged her into the Galactic web just to play the game?! Yao Si rolled her eyes while taking a look of their surroundings. \u201cOh right, where is Li Zheng? Did you throw him to someone just to play?\u201d <em>Where is the care you promised? </em></p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s here!\u201d Bai Yi inclined his head toward the voluptuous woman who was pulling on her hair.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Yao Si froze. <em>Is this\u2026 real?</em></p><br/><p>\u201cFather Yao Si, long time no see!\u201d The sis giggled before greeting Yao Si in a hoarse, manly voice.</p><br/><p>\u25cb|\uffe3|_</p><br/><p>Why did Li Zheng become a woman?! Wasn\u2019t the Galactic web capable of recreating the player\u2019s real appearance? Wasn\u2019t changing gender online banned?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen I was creating the account, I decided that it would be better to give the noob a cleric\u2019s role, but only women can choose the celestial healer class,\u201d Bai Yi explained bashfully. \u201cSo I hacked into the game company\u2019s data to alter his information.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d <em>Isn\u2019t this change a little too extreme?!</em></p><br/><p>\u201cThat bunch was too much! How could they kill Your Highness!\u201d Bai Yi patted his chest. \u201cRest assured Your Highness, the two of us have already reached the maximum level. If we hadn\u2019t been outnumbered, we would not have been killed. Give me a moment, I\u2019ll gather a few friends to take revenge!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d Li Zheng agreed with confidence. \u201cThose bastards, I\u2019ve always wanted to take care of them. Besides outnumbering us, what else could they possibly do? They should just fight us 1v1! What\u2019s so good about an ambush?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBesides, in the past two months, Li Zheng\u2019s moves have gotten smoother!\u201d Bai Yi added.</p><br/><p>Li Zheng then straightened his back so his fake E cups rose and jerked his head to the side aggressively. \u201cThat\u2019s right, with a wave of my hand, all noobs will fall!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFor Her Highness!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFor Her Highness!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d <em>For what bloody sister! </em></p><br/><p><em>What you guys do in the game has nothing to do with me! I\u2019ve got no intention of getting involved! And Li Zheng, put your chest pipe away, stop doing such weird actions\u2026 </em> Yao Si understood why the Galactic web would ban changing gender online!</p><br/><p>\u201cWait a minute!\u201d Yao Si was struck by another question. \u201cTwo months? You mean that for the past two months you\u2019ve been only playing games?\u201d <em>What about learning the Galactic language? Return me my notes!</em></p><br/><p>\u201cEr\u2026\u201d Bai Yi stilled. \u201cReading the notes was too boring. Besides, by playing the game, he got exposed to the Galactic language all the time. Am I right, bro?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMmh, mmh, you\u2019re absolutely right.\u201d Li Zheng nodded, determined to stick up for his brother. \u201cEverything has it\u2019s priority level, and the most important thing right now is to get back at that guy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLook! He has even learned to get back at others.\u201d Bai Yi looked at Li Zheng with admiration.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u25cb|\uffe3|_</p><br/><p>Yao Si had been wrong. She had assumed that when Li Zheng was handed over to Bai Yi, he would be influenced to become another technological whizz, but instead\u2026 Li Zheng turned into an addicted youngster\u2026 no, an addicted uncle.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey\u2019re here!\u201d A cry came from nearby, and the next moment, an announcement popped out in front of them.</p><br/><p>[World\uff08For glory\uff09:I have located them, Block 3 District 5, the revival point! Hurry over to stop them!]</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re exposed!\u201d Bai Yi hurriedly turned to instruct Yao Si.\u201d Your Highness, your level is too low, so it would be better if you went offline. When we get rid of them, you\u2026 F*ck!\u201d Before he could finish his sentence, he cursed. \u201cThey locked our location so we won\u2019t be able to logout! Which bastard did this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si opened her screen to take another look, and indeed, her options had turned gray with a lock icon at the side and a 30 min timer. The amount of players surrounding them started to increase, reaching hundreds of people. She then opened the world chat and was flooded with angry comments.</p><br/><p>[World\uff08MaleGodMu\u2019sGuard\uff09: All bloodlings head over to Block 3 District 5 \u2018s revival point. We found the two bastards. ]</p><br/><p>[World\uff08LightingInTheSky\uff09: I see them. There\u2019s an additional person with an unidentified ID, but she must be just like them. Let\u2019s kill them all!]</p><br/><p>[World\uff08FlawlessStarrySky\uff09: Toss them out of here! No tainting the game world!]</p><br/><p>[World\uff08FemaleGoddessPlayer\uff09: No tainting the game world! +1]</p><br/><p>[World\uff08FanLover.GoddessLover\uff09: No tainting the game world! +2]</p><br/><p>The player who had killed them was also a blooding?!</p><br/><p>(\u2299_\u2299)</p><br/><p>What\u2019s going on? What\u2019s this called? The game version of an internal war?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat exactly did you guys do?\u201d Yao Si asked, glaring at Bai Yi.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t blame him, it\u2019s my fault!\u201d Li Zheng scratched his head as he explained. \u201cI said something wrong since I wasn\u2019t clear about the situation.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBro, how is that your fault!\u201dBai Yi stepped forward, looking serious. \u201cThat person was too harsh.\u201d He sighed.</p><br/><p>Yao Si felt like there was a link to her somewhere in there. Ever since she had exposed her identity to the Galactic a year ago, news about her had spread like wildfire across the web. Among them was one about her playing a celestial game for a few months.</p><br/><p>The game company had monopolized on that rumor, turning it into an advertisement that attracted players from all walks of life, especially those of bloodling race. District 10 was flooded with them, and they came to take up more than 30% of the population.</p><br/><p>After Bai Yi had helped Li Zheng level up, he had chanced upon a bunch of players who were snatching another party\u2019s monster. Bai Yi went forward and killed them mercilessly. They then ended up squabbling on the world chat, and the other party announced that he would gather his bloodling friends to take him down.</p><br/><p>Out of agitation, Bai Yi exposed his 720th generation identity. Beat that!</p><br/><p>Maybe due to the large number of bloodlings that were playing the game, they didn\u2019t restrain themself but instead mocked his low status as there were 600+ generation bloodlings among the offender\u2019s friends.</p><br/><p>As a comrade that was lacking in general knowledge, Li Zheng exploded with a line: What\u2019s so great about the 600th generation? Only those below the 6th generation can be counted!</p><br/><p>With just one sentence, he managed to offend the entire bloodling race except for the only two who could be excluded from that slander. Hence\u2026 without a doubt, the two men became the target of everyone\u2019s anger.</p><br/><p>\u201cArgh, my account is locked, I can\u2019t go offline.\u201d Bai Yi glanced at the endless stream of players that were crowding around them and started to panic. \u201cYour Highness, do you have any good friends in the game? Could you call them over to save us?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t!\u201d The only people she met in the game were the elders, but they weren\u2019t online. On top of that, not too long back she had blocked off all their communications so they wouldn\u2019t disturb her. \u201cI\u2019m not very familiar with this game. It was Mu Xuan\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p><em>Wait a minute!</em></p><br/><p>Yao Si was suddenly reminded of a serious abnormality!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Mu Xuan?\u201d</p><br/><p>(\u2299o\u2299?)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Bai Yi.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Li Zheng.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Mu Xuan who was in the newbie village.</p></div>\n</div>"}

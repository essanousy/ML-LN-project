When she finally found a red berry, she placed it into the celestial swan\u2019s mouth.</p><br/><p>The celestial swan flapped its wings, then raised its head towards the berries for a big bite before turning to glance at her with its beaks still wide open. A familiar voice came through. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, we do not support food as a form of payment, please pay with the Galactic Currency!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d <em>F**k, it was just trying to get me to pay\u2026 </em>.</p><br/><p>Paying for transport, that\u2019s\u2026 quite normal. <em>But\u2026 if you don\u2019t support other forms of payment, then return me my berries! </em> (._.\u201d)</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you accept bank transfers?\u201d</p><br/><p>The swan did not say anything more, just raised its slender claw. Attached to it was a red payment device. Yao Si frowned, then swiped her optical computer past it once. With a short buzz, the words \u2018successful payment\u2019 came through.</p><br/><p>The celestial swan flew up in satisfaction, circling her head once with an enthusiastic chirp. \u201cIt\u2019s everyone\u2019s duty to care for the celestial race\u2019s transports. Please do not overfeed the celestial swans, thank you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d <em>Come back here!</em></p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>Yao Si reached the celestials\u2019 training office.</p><br/><p>Tourism within the celestials\u2019 lands seemed much more advanced than their training facilities, and there weren\u2019t many people at the training registration booth. Despite the large size of the office, there were only five people \u2013 mostly burly warriors. The number of staff was even lower, with a total of two booths; one of which had a \u2018close\u2019 sign hanging at its front.</p><br/><p>Just as Yao Si was about to queue, an elderly with snowy white beard came over.</p><br/><p>\u201cDear customer, are you here for training?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI am.\u201d Yao Si nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cHave you done your preparations before the training?\u201d he asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cPreparation?\u201d She stilled. What did she need to prepare?</p><br/><p>\u201cThis must be the first time you\u2019re here to the celestial region!\u201d the elderly man added enthusiastically as he started his introduction. \u201cTraining means that you\u2019ll be transported to the most primitive planet. The locals there will be clueless about the Galactic rules, so you can\u2019t go there without any preparations!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do I need to prepare?\u201d Yao Si couldn\u2019t help asking since there was still time before her registration.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome come, look over there.\u201d He pointed towards an overflowing shop straight ahead. \u201cThese are the most famous supplementary pills in the celestial region. We also stock talismans and everything else you need to ensure your safety during your training. These are pills to boost your immunity system, these are talismans for fire hazards, these are summoning talismans, and these are the best Bi Gu celestial pills! With all these, you won\u2019t have to worry about the dangers you\u2019ll face. There\u2019s also a luxury set available!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d <em>He must be a promoter, his words can\u2019t be trusted. </em> \u201cI don\u2019t need it, thanks!\u201d She was going there to train, not for a tour. Besides, she wanted to train her mental strength, which had nothing to do with all these.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy won\u2019t you need it!\u201d Customers must have been a rare sight judging by his persistence. He added in agitation, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, my merchandise is all of the highest quality. Even if you\u2019re here to train, you can never be too careful. You should get some to protect yourself in case of unforeseen circumstances!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI really don\u2019t need anything.\u201d</p><br/><p>She was here purely to train her mental strength. She had already checked the Galactic web, and her first destination would be the third region of Shadow Planet. According to the web, the species in that area would all be below rank B, so as a 3S rank bloodling, as long as she remained in that area, she would be safe.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p>\n</div>"}

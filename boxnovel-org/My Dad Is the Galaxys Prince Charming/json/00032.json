Even though Qu Ze was a maniac, he had no intentions of killing off their race. The purple ball he gave Yao Si was just the shell shed by the Royal Seed, which had actually sprouted into a tiny seedling, hence Qu Ze\u2019s intentions\u2026 were purely to get Yao Si into trouble.</p><br/><p>Initially, Second Elder suggested for Qu Ze to follow them back, since the Royal Seed didn\u2019t sprout in Thunder Sylvani, which might cause some unforeseen repercussions. After all, Qu Ze was a specialist and might be of some help, but the suggestion was swiftly refuted by Thunder Sylvani ruler with no room for discussion.</p><br/><p>With the tiny seedling in his hands, he changed back into the giant tree and flew away with the green planet in tow. In less than a minute, he disappeared into a spark in the distance, his speed exceptionally fast as though afraid that Qu Ze would follow along. After a few days, all the residents in the bloodling capital received the demolition fee from the Thunder Sylvani ruler.</p><br/><p><em>Hmm, I guess the matter ended peacefully </em>, Yao Si thought.</p><br/><p>But after the war between the clans, the bloodlings were all busy restoring their damaged homes. For the past few days, everyone seemed in low spirits\u2014many of them could be seen sighing with hung heads, their faces filled with despair and helplessness. <em>Haiii! Not one of them seemed like they could fight. </em></p><br/><p>\u256e(\u256f\ufe4f\u2570\uff09\u256d</p><br/><p>What was left was to settle the scores with Qu Ze. The Great Elder felt that this matter was much more perplexing than whether or not to start a war with Thunder Sylvani ruler. Even after the elders had held a discussion from noon all the way to night time, they still weren\u2019t able to come to a conclusion.</p><br/><p>In the end, a certain someone who had long wanted to chase them out instructed coldly, \u201cDon\u2019t you like to play games? Then you should go to Nirvana.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone fell silent.</p><br/><p>Even Qu Ze, who had struggled to stay obedient in front of Mu Xuan, turned green in an instant.</p><br/><p>Yao Si had no idea where or what \u201cNirvana\u201d was\u2026 But she was delighted knowing that he wouldn\u2019t be having there, based on how his face had paled.</p><br/><p>Mu Xuan\u2019s words were final. With a dark face, he chased the group that refused to leave out. They weren\u2019t his cub, so why weren\u2019t they leaving? Were they planning to stay for dinner? He reached out to caress his own rascal, hmm, after such a long while, she had to be hungry.</p><br/><p>The next moment, Yao Si was stuffed with yet another bowl of mouthwatering blood nourishing soup.</p><br/><p>Only after a few days did she hear from Yao Qian where and what \u201cNirvana\u201d was. Simply put, it was a real-life game planet, totally different from the naive web game that she had entered with her subconsciousness. That planet had extreme conditions which allowed one to unleash their full potential, hence the game company retained the original appearance of the planet and developed the game around it.</p><br/><p>The game itself required real participants and didn\u2019t have a revive function. If one were to die in the middle of their playthrough, it\u2019d be the end. Everything that happened within would be up to one\u2019s fate, thus, that planet was always considered a training venue for the different clans in the galaxy.</p><br/><p>But since it was a game, in order to prevent accidental deaths, the game company installed many NPCs and a necessary storyline. This meant that even though the game was difficult, the players\u2019 lives were definitely not at stake.</p><br/><p>But\u2026 that was limited to the players. Qu Ze wouldn\u2019t be there as a player but as a NPC. According to the game settings, they had to live on the planet for a hundred days. Yet Qu Ze\u2019s NPC would be different from the others in the game that could taunt the players at will. His would only have half the abilities and would have no say over his actions; he could only report the player\u2019s missions and protect the player\u2019s life. This was an absolute hell for Qu Ze who had a stomach full of pranks. At time he would even be required to be a nanny, saving players from committing suicide.</p><br/><p>Yao Si finally understood what Mu Xuan\u2019s words \u2018Don\u2019t you like to play?\u2019 had meant. Qu Ze should get played for once as well!</p><br/><p>(\u2299_\u2299)</p><br/><p>Yao Si remembered that the Second Elder seemed to have accidentally let it slip how she had been played by Qu Ze. So\u2026 was Mu Xuan helping her get back at him?</p><br/><p>Instantly, she couldn\u2019t thinking \u2026 <em>That was a wonderful move!</em></p><br/><p>She suddenly felt that having such a protective father seemed\u2026 like a good idea.</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>After the incident involving Thunder Sylvani ruler, Yao Si realized just how weak she truly was and that the galaxy wasn\u2019t as peaceful as she had thought it to be. A minor disagreement could escalate into a fight in an instant. I it wasn\u2019t for the attribute of undead that she was born with, she would have probably died within three seconds of waking up. Hence, she was determined to master the art of survival.</p><br/><p>Mu Xuan was delighted by Yao Si\u2019s diligence, to the point that he even had the impulse to flaunt to outsiders. Take a look, even at such a young age she has such ambition, she\u2019s my cub, no doubt about that. As the only bloodling that had managed to awaken the ancestral bloodline, Mu Xuan had the most comprehensive knowledge of the clan\u2019s abilities, he could teach her about any kind of ability if only\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Yao Si shook her head. \u201cI haven\u2019t felt any abnormalities ever since I changed, so I\u2019m not sure what it might be.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mu Xuan was stumped. \u201cHave you taken a test?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si recalled the pregnancy test kit that Li Zheng had given her. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely not the Five series ability.\u201d Yao Si\u2019s spirits were low. If not for the greater physical strength and accelerated healing, she wouldn\u2019t seem like a bloodling at all. \u201cIs- Is it possible that I might have no ability?\u201d As a fifth generation bloodling, who was also a cub of Mu Xuan, she would be the galaxy\u2019s biggest joke if she didn\u2019t have any ability.</p><br/><p>\u201cClose your eyes.\u201d Mu Xuan reached out to tapped her forehead. Instinctively, Yao Si shut her eyes, and a cooling sensation entering her temples, flowing through her entire body.</p><br/><p>Half a second later, Mu Xuan retrieved his hand. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I can feel the ability within you, it just hasn\u2019t been awakened yet.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si sighed. Luckily she wasn\u2019t bare. Brother Li Zheng must have been right, only her own father could guess her ability. \u201cCan you tell what it is?\u201d</p><br/><p>Mu Xuan frowned. \u201cI\u2019m not sure yet.\u201d The presence of an ability was obvious, even though it hasn\u2019t been awaken, when his energy entered her body, he realised that the ability seemed\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cYour ability\u2026 is special, I can\u2019t seem to determine what it is, but you\u2019ll find that out once it awakens.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Yao Si nodded. \u201cHow do I awaken it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Mu Xuan suddenly felt stuck. He had a whole lot of ideas on how to improve one\u2019s abilities but no clue as to how awaken them. He tried to think about how he had done it in the past\u2026 But it was such a long time ago, he could no longer remember.</p><br/><p>Since Mu Xuan knew how diligently his cub was working, he couldn\u2019t bear to demoralize her optimism. Wasn\u2019t it just awakening one\u2019s abilities? Even if he didn\u2019t remember it himself, that didn\u2019t mean that the other bloodlings could not.</p><br/><p>After Mu Xuan had personally chased them out, the Elders were planning to return home for a good rest, but the moment they turned, they were met with the sudden appearance of his majesty.</p><br/><p>Before waiting for them to ask anything, he threw them a question, \u201cHow can I awake one\u2019s abilities?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p><em>Do you even need help with awakening your abilities? Isn\u2019t it a natural instinct? Is there something wrong with your majesty\u2019s abilities?</em></p><br/><p>The elders tensed, giving the question their utmost attention.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Majesty, are you referring to Her Highness Yao Si?\u201d Second Elder tried to test the waters.</p><br/><p>\u201cMmh.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis\u2026 Young bloodlings usually awaken their abilities by themselves. Your Majesty, you don\u2019t have to worry, I\u2019m sure Her Highness Yao Si will be able to do it in due time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mu Xuan frowned. \u201cHow do the young bloodlings in the clan do it?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Second Elder took a moment to think. \u201cThe newly born bloodlings are sent into the \u2018Royal Bloodling Kindergarten\u2019 to learn, and a majority of them awaken their abilities there. The faster ones do it in four to five months while the slower ones take two to three years. After they awaken their abilities, they graduate from there.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSending her to the kindergarten\u2026\u201d Mu Xuan frowned, seemingly unwilling to part just after he had found her.</p><br/><p>\u201cHer Highness has been to the kindergarten.\u201d Second Elder hesitated before saying more. \u201cBut her situation is a little unique, she isn\u2019t the same as the other bloodlings and wasn\u2019t suited to be there. Her Highness didn\u2019t seem to like it there either.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t like it?\u201d Mu Xuan turned to stare at the man. \u201cWhat\u2019s the reason?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cErr\u2026 She experienced some unhappy moments.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard that on her first day Her Highness made all the bloodlings in the kindergarten cry.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mu Xuan\u2019s face darkened. \u201cThey bullied her!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEr\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGet their parents to see me tomorrow.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p><em>Who exactly were the ones getting bullied? Where\u2019s the logic? Where\u2019s the fairness? Even if he\u2019s being defensive, isn\u2019t this too much?!</em></p>\n</div>"}

You won\u2019t be able to find it unless it is attacked\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Before he could finish his sentence, Mu Xuan had already turned and slammed the attack button on the control table. Almost instantly, flashes of light lit up on the screen, and with a thundering roar, the night skies exploded with a blinding spark.</p><br/><p>Soon, a massive lotus floated up as predicted; Lian Yu was really there!</p><br/><p>[Ding, enemy communicating!]</p><br/><p>A warning popped up, and the next moment, an enraged Lian Yu appeared on the screen. Beside her, Lin Ergou held onto her face. He didn\u2019t seem as frustrated as expected; instead\u2026 he seemed unusually calm. Was that an illusion? Why did he look like he was blushing?</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Yu\u2026\u201d The lighting sylvani king brightened up, prepared to advise her, but Lian Yu didn\u2019t give him the time.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck! It\u2019s really this bastard!\u201d Lian Yu glared at Mu Xuan vehemently, prepared to take down everyone that dared to stop her. \u201cYou\u2019re pretty fast, but it\u2019s too late, Sisi has already agreed. Don\u2019t you dare try to separate us; we are two willing parties! Even if the Galaxy perishes, we will still be together! Heh!\u201d</p><br/><p>Without waiting for a reply, she switched off the communication. The entire time, she never once glanced at the lighting sylvani king.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Yao Si.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Mu Xuan.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Heavenly sylvani king.</p><br/><p><em>B*tch! </em> Yao Si could vaguely see the throbbing veins on Mu Xuan\u2019s temples.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait a minute, Mu Xuan!\u201d <em>There are other planets here! </em></p><br/><p>It was too late though. With a wave of his hand, a white glow sped straight for the Flower of the Heavenly Tree. Any second now and it would be severed into half.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, a protective barrier covered it. With a loud thud, it protected the ship from Mu Xuan\u2019s attack. When the massive force crashed onto the barrier, it was sent a few meters back.</p><br/><p>Yao Si wobbled slightly, almost falling over, but Mu Xuan was fortunately there to stabilize her. When she finally gained her footing, the Flower of the Heavenly Tree was inching backward into a space portal behind it.</p><br/><p>\u201cMu Xuan!\u201d Yao Si exclaimed, pointing toward the screen anxiously. But it was too late. The Flower of the Heavenly Tree was gone.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt can\u2019t be!\u201d The heavenly sylvani king was full of disbelief as he checked the data. \u201cEven though Xiao Yu\u2019s brother is a jade tree, it can\u2019t even be considered a seedling. Even if it\u2019s a jade tree, there\u2019s no way it would be able to summon a space portal so quickly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCheck their new location!\u201d Mu Xuan commanded.</p><br/><p>The heavenly sylvani king started the investigation, and after a short while, he said, \u201cThey\u2019re in Galaxy G, area 67. They\u2019ve actually passed the nearest three galaxies in such a short while.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mu Xuan opened a portal immediately, but they could not catch their target. Lian Yu seemed to be playing hide and seek with them as the moment they reached the ship\u2019s location, she would immediately send it elsewhere. Just like that, they traveled through over ten different galaxies while catching only a quick glimpse of their target before the ship would disappear.</p><br/><p>Yao Si\u2019s frustration grew with the continued chase until even her blood began to boil.</p><br/><p>After three hours\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 gone\u2026\u201d the heavenly sylvani king remarked with a blank expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean gone?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Flower of the Heavenly Tree can\u2019t be found anywhere! They disappeared from the Galaxy!\u201d</p><br/><p><em>F*ck!</em></p><br/><p>The frustration that had accumulated throughout the day in Yao Si finally exploded!</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck, I give up!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSisi,\u201d Mu Xuan said in a comforting voice. \u201cPersevere a bit more and we\u2019ll find them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe have been chasing for the entire day. I don\u2019t care, I don\u2019t want to wait anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSisi, be obedient!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck obedience!\u201d Yao Si could feel her insides burning with rage, and she exploded. \u201cYou said that four hours ago! Keep it in, keep it in, keep it in! What do you take me for?! If you continue to stop me, I\u2019m going to hate you! Let me repeat once more\u2026\u201d She inhaled deeply, gritted her teeth, and made sure to articulate each word very clearly. \u201cI want to visit the washroom!\u201d</p><br/><p>F*CK! She had held it in the entire day, ever since they were on the space station. Mu Xuan and the others had been using all sorts of ways to stop her from visiting the washroom, insisting that she had to hold it in till she returned to her own body.</p><br/><p>Wasn\u2019t the heavenly sylvani king the root to capturing them? F*ck the galactic safety, f*ck galactic peace, f*ck the peace between the two races!</p><br/><p>(\u256f\u2035\u25a1\u2032)\u256f\ufe35\u253b\u2501\u253b</p><br/><p>Even a galactic destruction couldn\u2019t stop someone from a nature\u2019s call!</p><br/><p>\u201cI need the washroom, now, this instant!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSi\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShut up! If you dare to object, I\u2019ll severe all ties with you this instant!\u201d</p><br/><p>Mu Xuan stilled, his face sinking. After half a minute, he seemed to have come to a conclusion. In a serious tone, he declared, \u201cI\u2019ll accompany you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGet lost!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d A stunned crowd and the heavenly sylvani king.</p><br/><p>All of them had a pressing question: what did chasing after the Flower of the Heavenly Tree have to do with going to the washroom? No one, however, had the courage to ask. It seemed far too scary.</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>The heavenly sylvani king insisted that the Flower of the Heavenly Tree has disappeared from the Galaxy since he couldn\u2019t sense its presence. Initially, he had assumed it was because the royal tree\u2019s data had been changed, so the lighting sylvani king would be unable to find it, but Mu Xuan rejected that hypothesis since the Flower of the Heavenly Tree wasn\u2019t even a real ship. The data couldn\u2019t just be altered so easily. Besides, due its connection to the lighting sylvani and the bloodling\u2019s bloodline suppression, it was impossible for the lighting sylvani king to not have contact of it.</p><br/><p>Since the heavenly sylvani king said that he couldn\u2019t sense the Flower of the Heavenly Tree, it just meant that it really wasn\u2019t in the Galaxy anymore. If it was true, it meant\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cThey are in the abyss,\u201d Yao Si blurted out. As expected, during such a critical timing, her thoughts were much clearer.</p><br/><p>Mu Xuan nodded, the thought having occurred to him as well. He opened a space portal, \u201cWe\u2019re heading to the Blue Planet!\u201d</p><br/><p>After passing through the portal, a familiar looking blue planet came into sight.</p><br/><p>Lin Long hadn\u2019t been lying previously; he was almost done with the reconstruction of the Blue Planet. It was back to the familiar sight Yao Si knew well. But there was still a small portion missing at the bottom right corner with several tiny fragments floating at the top. The thing was about 95% completed.</p><br/><p>\u201cFlower of the Heavenly Tree!\u201d The heavenly sylvani king caught sight of the gigantic lotus straight away.</p><br/><p>Unlike before, it wasn\u2019t invisible and didn\u2019t require to be attacked to show up. This time, it floated openly, not the least bit afraid of being discovered.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go in!\u201d Mu Xuan pulled at Yao Si\u2019s hand, and in a flash, they entered the Flower of the Heavenly Tree.</p><br/><p>It was an endless sea of flowers, but this time, there wasn\u2019t a stunning beauty in the middle.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere are they?!\u201d</p><br/><p>After scouring the place, they realized that the Flower of the Heavenly Tree was empty, both Lin Long and Lian Yu weren\u2019t in sight.</p><br/><p>Where had they gone?</p></div>\n</div>"}

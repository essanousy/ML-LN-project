Once we give our word, we would never turn our backs. If you convince the elder grand prince into a 1v1 battle for honor, we would have a shot at winning!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou mean\u201d\u2014Yao Si took a step forward\u2014\u201dwe should challenge them to a duel?\u201d Why did it sound so dubious?</p><br/><p>\u201cMmh.\u201d He swept a glance over them. \u201cWhen the time comes, you will challenge the elder grand prince to a battle of honor in front of the entire clan. This would prevent them from going back on their word. As long as you win, you can use the victor\u2019s honor to send them back.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUsing this universe as a bet\u2026\u201d Yao Si frowned as she exchanged a glance with Mu Xuan. If they were to agree, it would definitely be viable, but the main point was\u2026 who would they be sending for the duel?</p><br/><p>\u201cYour man of course.\u201d Yu Zhe saw through her thoughts and pointed at Mu Xuan. \u201cWho else is qualified? Even though I\u2019m not sure of his background, but based on his abilities, it wouldn\u2019t be a problem for him to defeat an elder grand prince in a 1v1 duel.\u201d</p><br/><p>That wasn\u2019t a worry, but\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cDo we just have to defeat one of them?\u201d If it was a fight against one person, would the others acknowledge it? There were three elder grand princes. If it went to 1v3, wouldn\u2019t be any different from the previous lost cause scenario? Even though Mu Xuan was powerful, fighting against three elder grand princes would probably be too much.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho says it\u2019s just him?\u201d Yu Zhe rolled his eyes and pointed at her. \u201cThere\u2019s you too!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 What?\u201d <em>Didn\u2019t you say I\u2019d be there just as a decoy?</em></p><br/><p>\u201cThe battle for honor isn\u2019t limited to just abilities.\u201d Yu Zhe glanced at her with disgust. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to find a way for them to compete against your mental strength. With your perverted level in it, they wouldn\u2019t stand a chance.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si finally got it!</p><br/><p>\u201cIn summary, you want me to\u2026 put on a front?</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Yu Zhe\u2019s lips twitched, and he rolled his eyes at her before continuing. \u201cAnyways, once you guys win against the two elder grand princes, they would know that taking over this universe wouldn\u2019t be as easy as they had imagined.\u201d</p><br/><p>If it really was as he said, it was indeed a good idea.</p><br/><p><em>Eh, wait a minute!</em></p><br/><p>\u201cWeren\u2019t there three elder grand princes? Why do we just have to win against two of them?\u201d What happened to the third one? Or was it majority wins?</p><br/><p>Yu Zhe stilled, his face darkening before he suddenly exploded in fury. \u201cEnough! I\u2019ve already been beaten to such a state, so what more do you want?\u201d</p><br/><p>What was wrong? What was with the sudden temper?</p><br/><p>Perhaps\u2026 An absurd explanation popped into the minds of the crowd.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are an elder grand prince!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The enemy\u2019s strength seemed to have went down instantly!</p><br/><p>(\u2299_\u2299)</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>The pure breeds came quickly!</p><br/><p>They predicted three days for their arrival, but on the second day, Lin Long detected abnormal spatial movements near the Blue Planet.</p><br/><p>There wasn\u2019t even time for Yao Si to prepare before she was sent to the abyss. As expected, once they approached the Blue Planet, they found the surrounding darkness being ripped apart as it twisted and turned. Even the Blue Planet was starting to distort.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey\u2019re coming!\u201d Lin Long announced, focusing his gaze straight ahead.</p><br/><p>Yao Si\u2019s heart shook, and she took in a deep breath to suppress her riled up emotions, but she couldn\u2019t seem to calm down. Mu Xuan then tightened his grip around her hand and caressed her head. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, if\u2026 I\u2019ll do it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si stilled, his wounded self resurfacing in her mind. She then shook her head violently. \u201cNo, I can do it.\u201d Wasn\u2019t it just putting on a front? She could definitely do that.</p><br/><p>A gigantic white portal gradually widened behind the Blue Planet. Yao Si couldn\u2019t help but shove Li Zheng who stood by her side. \u201cIs there somewhere I can sit?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Zheng stilled before his eyes lit up. \u201cAs expected of my dad to think it through so well! You\u2019ll certainly look more commanding seated, and I just happen to have a limited edition portable chair with me.\u201d He tapped open his optical computer to take out a glowing golden chair and placed it behind her. \u201cDad, take a seat. Let us oppress them with our imposing manner.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou misunderstood, my legs are feeling weak!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>When the first batch of troops came through the portal, the first thing that came into their sight was a majestic looking Yao Si sitting on the shinny golden chair. She looked down at the approaching troops with contempt, squinting her eyes slightly as though they didn\u2019t mean a thing. Among the three men around her was even a bloodling from their world, Lin Long.</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard that you intend to take over our universe?\u201d Yao Si said while scanning the crowd dismissively, not taking them into account.</p><br/><p>The pure breeds\u2019 mood sank instantly, exposing their apprehension.</p><br/><p>Even a fool knew that something went wrong when Yu Zhe hadn\u2019t returned. But he was an elder grand prince, and according to Lin Long\u2019s previous report, they were just lowly other races in this universe. Logically thinking, there shouldn\u2019t be any race stronger than them living in the universe, but the moment they entered, they were no longer so sure.</p><br/><p>Who was\u2026 that person?</p><br/><p>Yao Si struggled to keep her composure, her nerves strung tight as she squinted to give the crowd a rugged scan. Deep inside, her heart was in a frenzy. <em>My gosh, there is probably millions of them! If we really get into a fight\u2026 everything is going to go down the drain.</em></p><br/><p>But she had to keep her composure, had to keep up the act.</p><br/><p>\u201cExcuse me, if you want this universe\u2026\u201d She turned toward the two men at the front before spitting out, \u201cYou will have to go through me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d A women took a step forward, her brows furrowed. She had to be an elder grand prince that Yu Zhe had mentioned, and beside her\u2026 even though he had the appearance of a young child of about ten years old, was the strongest among the three elder grand princes.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m just one of the many races in this universe.\u201d Yao Si tried to portray a nonchalant tone. \u201cAnd what a coincidence, we\u2019re called bloodlings as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>The faces of the two elder grand princes sank. They had been informed about the bloodlings of this universe, but according to the report, they were a bunch of weaklings with impure blood. Had there been a mistake in the report?</p><br/><p>Lin Long, who was the person who\u2019d made the report, seemed relatively calm despite being in the enemy\u2019s camp, which was a clear sign that he had betrayed them. Thus, his report couldn\u2019t be completely trusted.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re extremely upset about your uninformed invasion,\u201d Yao Si continued. \u201cHence, we couldn\u2019t help but take action.\u201d She turned to give Li Zheng a glance.</p><br/><p>Li Zheng nodded and tugged Yu Zhe up forcefully before giving him a shove forward. With a lift of his foot, he stomped on the fallen body.</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t he one of yours?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cElder grand prince!\u201d the crowd exclaimed as they stared in disbelief. He was an elder grand prince, one of the strongest among the grand princes, so how could he have been caught so easily?!</p><br/><p>\u201cLin Long mentioned that you\u2019re rather strong so we decided to test it, but\u2026 I accidentally obliterated his abilities.\u201d Yao Si waved her hand with fake sadness.</p><br/><p>The faces of all the troops sunk. An uproar broke out in the crowd since no one had expected this universe to have someone strong enough to obliterate an elder grand prince\u2019s ability.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow-how can that be, that\u2019s Yu Zhe, the elder grand prince!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAbilities can be decimated?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat kind of universe is this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWasn\u2019t this universe filled with lowly inhabitants? Was the report inaccurate?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCan we win with the presence of such a race?\u201d</p><br/><p>The troops flew into a frenzy. After half a second, the child-like elder grand prince finally took a step forward with a dark gaze. In a heavy tone that didn\u2019t fit his appearance, he asked, \u201cWhat do you intend to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>Her presence here definitely wasn\u2019t just for show, right?</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019d be too troublesome to deal with each and every one of you. Since we\u2019re here, why don\u2019t\u201d\u2014Yao Si swept a glance at the youth before completing her sentence\u2014\u201dwe fight for the bloodling honour. Three matches to determine the victor. If you win, your race can do anything you wish in this universe as long as you don\u2019t disrupt my people, but if you lose\u2026 get out of my universe.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>At the last line, Yao Si\u2019s heart was in her mouth. She struggled to stop her hands from clenching into fists or revealing any other signs of anxiety. Since she had already gone so far, she had to keep calm. <em>Keep calm! Keep it together for everyone!</em></p><br/><p>While thinking that, she couldn\u2019t help taking a peak at the surrounding troops\u2026</p><br/><p><em>F*ck!</em></p><br/><p><em>F*ck you, Yu Zhe! </em>Wasn\u2019t it just a kick from Li Zheng? Was there a need to show such a promiscuous expression? You\u2019re supposed to be a hostage!</p><br/><p>After what seemed like an eternity, she heard a reply from afar.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright!\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

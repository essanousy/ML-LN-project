Your baby was so afraid! </em></p><br/><p>\u201cMu. Xuan,\u201d he spat out resolutely. \u201cOr father.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMu Xuan dad.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d He sighed. \u201cI heard you met some bad people?\u201d he asked before she could speak again.</p><br/><p>\u201cYea!\u201d Yao Si stilled, shaking her head. \u201cThat\u2019s not important, I\u2019ve got something to tell you\u2026 I think there\u2019s a problem with my ability.\u201d She instantly went to the important part since she was used to clarifying things with him.</p><br/><p>Mu Xuan frowned, taking a good look at her. After he confirmed that there wasn\u2019t anything visibly wrong with her, his temples relaxed slightly. His cub was unusually unlucky, constantly in harm\u2019s way\u2014outside she was kidnapped, at home she met burglars. He probably had to keep a tighter watch on her in the future. How could he allow others to bully his cub after he had not been part of her life for so long.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with your ability?\u201d He reached out for her arm, transferring some energy over to investigate her condition. The energy went one round but wasn\u2019t able to catch anything, hence, he brought it back.</p><br/><p>Yao Si had no idea about it, so she explained what happened last night in detail.</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t space summoning the main skill of the space type abilities?\u201d Space splitting was the more advanced version, but only the very best were able to accomplish that. \u201cWhy was my space ability only able to move those three burglars\u2026\u201d The main point was that she still couldn\u2019t feel anything!</p><br/><p>Mu Xuan lowered his head in deep thought before replying. \u201cIt\u2019s possible\u2026 that it isn\u2019t a normal space ability.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot normal?\u201d Then what was it? She had clearly opened a black space portal similar to the one created by that burglar Lao Da.</p><br/><p>\u201cYours could be negative space.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d <em>What is that?</em></p><br/><p>\u201cEven though the space ability is split into space summoning and space splitting, it is fundamentally the same ability,\u201d Mu Xuan explained seriously. \u201cIt works by first creating a space opening and then placing objects in it to send them elsewhere. But your space ability acts different, it works in the opposite way.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 How so?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOpposite in sequence.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSequence\u2026\u201d Yao Si stilled, her eyes going wide. \u201cYou mean, I don\u2019t put things into the space opening but rather take them out?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d He nodded and reached out to caress her head approvingly. \u201cNegative space allows you to take anything from the surrounding space, and at that moment the three burglars were the closest objects that had entered a space opening, hence it was what you removed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d Why did this ability seem so weird? Was that why a single thought was enough for her to automatically unravel the three burglars\u2019 optical computers, tossing all their loot out? Her ability seemed like the ultimate way to keep things where they are. With such an amazing ability, should she join a cult or something?</p><br/><p>\u201cI have one more question!\u201d She weakly raised a finger.</p><br/><p>\u201cMmh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy ability\u2026 is it a one time thing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si confessed everything, about how the ability disappeared soon after she activated it.</p><br/><p>Mu Xuan sunk into deep thought before replying once again. \u201cThere are strong and weak abilities, and sometimes one\u2019s energy will be exhausted, but I haven\u2019t heard about a one time ability.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen why can\u2019t I\u2014\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need to hurry.\u201d He reached out to caress her head, comforting her. \u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019s because you aren\u2019t familiar with your ability yet, that\u2019s why it only erupts when you really need it. When you\u2019re relaxed, it might\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He stilled, as if having thought of something. He lowered his head and glanced at her with contemplation.</p><br/><p>\u201cWha- what\u2019s wrong?\u201d Yao Si wriggled away, starting to feel uneasy from his gaze.</p><br/><p>He pulled her up. \u201cFollow me somewhere.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh? Ah,\u201d Yao Si replied blankly.</p><br/><p>By the time she processed his words, she was already brought to a large field with walls covering all four sides. Even the ceiling was shielded, enclosing the entire field.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA practice field,\u201d Mu Xuan replied.</p><br/><p>Practice field? Wasn\u2019t it the field bloodlings used for practicing their abilities, which in reality meant it was a real battlefield?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are we here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTry it.\u201d Without further explanations, Mu Xuan raised his arm, and the next moment a gigantic fire dragon flew into the skies. It was completely different from the galactic pirate\u2019s ability, for Mu Xuan\u2019s fire was blue. The gigantic fire dragon few about in the air as though it was alive.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Mu Xuan asked. \u201cDo you feel your ability?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si stilled, lowering her head to feel for something, then shook her head. \u201cNo.\u201d She still felt empty inside.</p><br/><p>Mu Xuan lowered his arm, and the fire dragon instantly disappearing. He frowned deeply once more.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with my ability?\u201d Yao Si asked. <em>Is there a real problem?</em></p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure yet\u2026\u201d he replied as he sent a text out on his optical computer. \u201cI need to test it out first.\u201d</p><br/><p>After this he tried several more abilities, the water series, gold series, and space series, displaying all of them in front of her.</p><br/><p><em>Is he trying to demoralize me? </em> -.-\u201d</p><br/><p>Just as she was about to voice her inner thoughts, Yao Qian rushed over.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Majesty, what do you need me for?\u201d Yao Qian asked as he looked at the both of them.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have the earth ability?\u201d Mu Xuan asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cYea.\u201d He nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cPractice with Sisi.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh! Ah?\u201d Practice? What did practice mean? Wasn\u2019t her highness\u2019 ability not stable yet? But when he was about to clarify, Mu Xuan was already at the entrance a few hundred meters away, not giving him an opportunity to understand the situation.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Highness?\u201d He turned to look at Yao Si.</p><br/><p>._.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mu Xuan\u2019s personal display wasn\u2019t enough, he specifically got someone else to flaunt their abilities?</p><br/><p><em>Forget it\u2026 </em>She had already gotten used to it.</p><br/><p>\u201cUnleash your ability!\u201d <em>Please start the performance!</em></p><br/><p>Yao Qian turned to look at the both of them once more with a face full of confusion, but he still did as commanded. \u201cYour Highness, please be careful.\u201d</p><br/><p>The next moment Yao Si could feel an immerse energy rising within her body. It was unlike anything she had felt before. Yao Qian\u2019s energy was so massive that even after his deliberate attempt to restrain it, it still devoured the entire practice ground. Even the air seemed to slow, turning oppressive and hard to breathe. When contrasted with the burglars, Yao Qian perfectly presented a senior\u2019s capability, turning his opponents into amateurs.</p><br/><p>The ground started to shake, and rows of vines sprouting from below. They seemed like rows of sharp fangs, crawling in Yao Si\u2019s direction. She could also feel a strange sense of suppression, as though something was forcing her to the ground.</p><br/><p>Her legs weakened and she was on the verge of collapsing, but right at that moment, she felt a surge of energy within her, dissipating the sense of suppression and freeing her body.</p><br/><p>\u00a0</p>\n</div>"}

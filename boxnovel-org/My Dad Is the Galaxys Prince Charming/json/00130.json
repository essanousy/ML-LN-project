The technology here sure is advanced!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Yao Si.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Mu Xuan.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Yao Qian.</p><br/><p>Yao Si was increasingly more confused. What exactly was happening? Why was Li Zheng suddenly calling her dad?</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Majesty, Your Highness.\u201d Yao Qian sighed deeply. \u201cYou have seen it yourself. This is the situation!\u201d</p><br/><p>This? What\u2019s this? Please take care of this illiterate here. Clarify yourself!</p><br/><p>\u201cWait a minute, what did you just call yourself?\u201d Yao Si suddenly remembered the way Li Zheng had addressed himself.</p><br/><p>\u201cYao Si!\u201d Li Zheng answered smoothly without a second\u2019s consideration. He then added, \u201cThat\u2019s the only name I remember, even though I have no idea why I was given such an inauspicious name. Yao Si, Yao Si!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Yao Si felt like she\u2019d been punched in the gut. How dare you despise my name after plagiarizing it!</p><br/><p>(\u256f\u2035\u25a1\u2032)\u256f\ufe35\u253b\u2501\u253b</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter the memory is inherited, this is an experience that all inheritors go through,\u201d Yao Qian explained. \u201cThe memories from the converter are transferred to the inheritor while all others are removed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, I\u2019m not called Yao Si? I see\u2026\u201d Li Zheng heaved a sigh of relief at the discovery. \u201cI was wondering why this memory is so girly and weird. \u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si was growing confused. Previously, Yao Qian had mentioned that Li Zhen only remembered his life on the Blue Planet. Then what he just said\u2026</p><br/><p>Her heart sank as she peaked at Yao Qian. \u201cAre you trying to say that\u2026 I\u2019m the one who converted him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah!\u201d Yao Qian nodded vigorously as he continued to point at the screen in front of them. \u201cHis DNA matches yours completely. There isn\u2019t a question about it; he is indeed your inheritor.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si\u2019s face twitched as she continued to tap on the screen with persistence. It was only when she reached the last line of the result paper did she see two defining words: Sixth generation!</p><br/><p>Si-Six\u2026 Sixth generation! Why the sixth generation?</p><br/><p>\u25cb|\uffe3|_</p><br/><p>Mu Xuan was a fourth-generation bloodling, so if he had been the converter, his inheritor would belong to the fifth generation. Besides, he had mentioned that after awakening the ancestral bloodline, he wasn\u2019t able to convert anyone. Thus, the only one in the entire bloodling race who could convert someone to a sixth generation bloodling was\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>F*ck! She had really converted Li Zheng!</p><br/><p>But how had it happened? She didn\u2019t do anything!</p><br/><p>Wait a moment!</p><br/><p>Yao Si remembered that when Li Zheng had pierced her heart with the sword, she had spat blood at him. After that, before he had fainted, blood had begun flowing into him. She had assumed that it was a hallucination but at that time, he had been absorbing her blood? Did that trigger the second conversion?</p><br/><p>\u201cMu Xuan\u2026\u201d She turned toward the person behind her.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince it\u2019s a second conversion, he will be considered a new blooding.\u201d Mu Xuan\u2019s face looked worse than hers as he glared at Li Zheng coldly. \u201cArrange it according to how we treat new bloodlings.\u201d</p><br/><p>With a last glance at Li Zheng, he pulled Yao Si out of the room.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh?\u201d We\u2019re going to leave just like that, without clarifying the situation? Is that really all right?</p><br/><p>Yao Qian was caught off guard. Before he could process the situation, the oblivious Li Zheng poked him once more before asking in a naive tone: \u201cHey, bro, is that fierce looking person my\u2026 grandfather?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si\u2019s feet turned jelly, and she almost tripped. Even Mu Xuan had frozen slightly before pulling her away even more anxiously.</p><br/><p>All these inheritees are indeed so hatable!</p><br/><p>\u2014</p><br/><p>Li Zheng was now Yao Si\u2019s inheritor. It was a truth purer than 24k gold. Despite the number of tests she went through, the results were all the same.</p><br/><p>Yao Si had never expected to one day experience being a dad\u2026</p><br/><p>She wasn\u2019t sure what kind of experience it was\u2026 But Mu Xuan\u2019s expression was horrible; he looked as though he had been constipated for a few months. Even from far away, she could feel the distaste and disgust he had for her sudden underaged fatherhood.</p><br/><p>As a fifth-generation bloodling, Yao Si hadn\u2019t expected to be able to suppress Li Zheng, a bloodling of a higher generation and manage to convert him a second time. It was not logical at all.</p><br/><p>After Mu Xuan\u2019s analysis, Yao Si thus came up with a more reliable conclusion\u2014it all boiled down to the ancestral bloodline. After she had been converted, Mu Xuan had been using his ability at full force which potentially influenced her. In contrast, Li Zheng had been on his last breath. He had little energy left, which made it easy for her bloodline to suppress him.</p><br/><p>Besides, the attack from Mu Xuan was enough to take his life.</p><br/><p>Just like that, the bloodline\u2019s power added to his death had effectively fulfilled the criteria for a conversion, turning Yao Si\u2026 into a dad!</p><br/><p>\u256e(\u256f\ufe4f\u2570\uff09\u256d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Highness\u2026\u201d Yao Qian glanced at her with hesitation. \u201cThat person\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with Li Zheng?\u201d Having received such a message early in the morning, Yao Si couldn\u2019t help worrying. \u201cDid he get into trouble again?\u201d The past few days had seen enough drama; she needed a break!</p><br/><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t much. I just need your opinion since he is after all your inheritor.\u201d Yao Qian bit down on his lips in hesitation. \u201cAccording to the bloodling rules, all inheritors are required to enroll in the academy for them to familiarise themselves with the converter\u2019s memory and train their ability. But he\u2026 is special.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSpecial?\u201d Remembering the events from a few days back, Yao Si started to panic. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with his ability?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Zheng belonged to the fire series, but his strength had always lain in his mental power. However, after the battle, it had completely disappeared. And no new ability had awakened after his second conversion.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not his ability\u2026\u201d Yao Qian shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s his inheritor memory.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMemory?\u201d Yao Si stilled. What do you mean? \u201cDoes he still think he\u2019s called Yao Si?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot really.\u201d Yao Qian sighed before explaining. After several tests, they had found out that Li Zheng had only received 80% of Yao Si\u2019s memory, which was the reason he thought he was named Yao Si.</p><br/><p>However, it was a memory with no feelings attached to it. Thus, it was akin to him seeing a movie whose details he could remember, but he was not an actor in it, so he didn\u2019t have any emotional attachment to them.</p><br/><p>Li Zheng had accepted that he wasn\u2019t Yao Si and, just like other inheritors, had shelved the memories as common knowledge. This was an inheritor\u2019s benefit. Without prior education, they would be able to obtain half the knowledge of their converter, which was the reason why inheritors were not considered cubs.</p><br/><p>Everything was completely logical and advantageous for the bloodling race, but\u2026 there was one problem!</p><br/><p>Yao Si\u2026 became a black hole for that logic.</p><br/><p>(\u2299_\u2299)</p><br/>\n</div>"}

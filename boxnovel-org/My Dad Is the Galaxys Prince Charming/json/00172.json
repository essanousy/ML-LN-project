The moment the administrative work was complete, Yao Si was out of the space station in a flash. She was determined to pass the coming of age test! She was over being looked upon as a \u2018baby\u2019 all for the sake of more intimate acts\u2026 cough, for coming of age!</p><br/><p>Wasn\u2019t it just a foreign planet? She could treat it as as part of a tour even if she was alone\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck, what are you guys doing here?\u201d Yao Si glanced ahead at the two that had arrived at the same moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Highness! That\u2019s great! We finally managed to catch up.\u201d Bai Yi broke into a radiant smile. \u201cI never expected Your Highness to also be attending the coming of age test, what a coincidence!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean by coincidence? You followed me, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis\u2026 I didn\u2019t have a choice!\u201d he complained pitifully when his lie was exposed. \u201cYour Highness, you should know that my ability doesn\u2019t have any attack power, so there is no way that I\u2019ll pass by myself. This is already my third try. I have been single for such a long time, so can\u2019t you take into account the ties we have as former classmates? Are you really ruthless enough to see me without a cub forever?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si finally understood his intentions for mentioning the coming of age test a while back. It seemed that he had been scheming all the while.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about him?\u201d She turned toward Li Zheng. She could understand Bai Yi\u2019s reasons, but why did he drag Li Zheng along? When compared to her, he seemed more like a young cub?</p><br/><p>Before Bai Yi could explain, Li Zheng chirped in in a loud voice. \u201cDad, your child is here to see you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGet lost!\u201d <em>Who\u2019s your dad? Haven\u2019t I corrected you enough times before? So why haven\u2019t you learned yet? </em></p><br/><p>\u201cOld Li wanted to see the world, and he would have to come here one day anyway. He just managed to grasp the galactic language, but is yet to learn much of the common knowledge, so I didn\u2019t feel okay leaving him behind,\u201d Bai Yi explained.</p><br/><p>The corners of Yao Si\u2019s lips twitched. <em>Isn\u2019t it all your fault? How would he be able to learn common knowledge when wasting his days gaming with you? </em></p><br/><p>\u201cOh right.\u201d She was suddenly reminded of something. \u201cHas his ability awakened?\u201d He was an early generation bloodling, so his ability should be of a certain standard.</p><br/><p>\u201cNope!\u201d They shook their heads in unison.</p><br/><p>Didn\u2019t that mean that Yao Si had two burdens? But it was too late to chase them back, so she just glanced at the dense jungle ahead, contemplating on whether she should find a safe place to pitch a tent. After all, she had to stay here for an entire month.</p><br/><p>Bai Yi tapped open the map before her then and asked like a sycophant, \u201cYour Highness, which checkpoint are we heading for first? We\u2019ll listen to your every command!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCheckpoint?\u201d Yao Si stilled. What was he talking about? \u201cWhat\u2019s a checkpoint?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh? Your Highness, didn\u2019t you read the test manual at the space portal?\u201d Bai Y froze as well, startled.</p><br/><p>The corners of Yao Si\u2019s lips twitched. When she had been at the space portal, she was busy trying to stop Mu Xuan from stuffing the entire house into her optical computer, so where would she find time to look for some manual!</p><br/><p>Bai Yi spared her and tapped onto the map in explanation. \u201cThe main aim of the coming of age test is to assess a young bloodling\u2019s individual ability. Even though the Ability Planet can be dangerous, it isn\u2019t entirely without safe zones. In order to prevent bloodlings from viewing the test lightly, there are many high level checkpoints scattered around the planet. In order to pass, a bloodling has to reach ten checkpoints within a month.\u201d</p><br/><p>So that was what they had to do! Yao Si had been prepared to just camp for a whole month without doing anything.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s the nearest checkpoint?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll check!\u201d Bai Yi zoomed in the map and stared at it for a short while before pointing to a red dot. \u201cThe checkpoints are rather dispersed, but there are two points near us. The first is no.23 in the south and the other is no.77 in the north. They are situated in the opposite directions.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si inched toward the map, then zoomed out for the full view of the planet before pointing decidedly on the checkpoint to the south, \u201cThis one! There are more checkpoints surrounding it, so there\u2019ll be ten of them if we move in a circular route.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut\u2026\u201d Bai Yi frowned, looking troubled. \u201cThere are indeed more checkpoints in the south, but\u2026 it\u2019ll be a rough terrain. It\u2019ll take at least ten days for a wind ability to fly over, and if we were to walk\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I have this!\u201d Yao Si pulled out three flying devices the size of circular plates out of her optical computer.</p><br/><p>\u201cFly-flying device!\u201d Bai Yi\u2019s eyes went wide in shock. \u201cY-your Highness, you actually brought a flying device!\u201d How could that be? Weren\u2019t they strictly prohibited from bringing along any galactic equipment? Wasn\u2019t this cheating? Wasn\u2019t it outright cheating?!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Isn\u2019t it enough?\u201d Yao Si asked in confusion.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Bai Yi and Li Zheng.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Highness, wh-when you entered, wasn\u2019t there any staff around in the space station?\u201d When they had entered, everything, even their boxers had been removed. They could only bring the map in their optical computer in order to ensure a fair competition.</p><br/><p>\u201cI saw them!\u201d Yao Si nodded. \u201cMmh, they were rather friendly and nice bloodlings.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF-f-friendly?!\u201d Were those really the same people as those who had seized even their boxers? \u201cIsn\u2019t your baggage\u2026\u201d too much?</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, I didn\u2019t intend to bring anything, but Mu Xuan stuffed it all in.\u201d If possible, he would have stuffed a ship in as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cHis Majes\u2014\u201d Fine! If Bai Yi was part of the staff, he wouldn\u2019t dare to utter a word as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, we can\u2019t use the flying devices? Why don\u2019t we just use a machine instead?! Do you want a defensive one, an aggressive one, or one for comfort?\u201d She clicked three machine space buttons.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Bai Yi.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Li Zheng.</p><br/><p>After half a minute\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Highness!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMmh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat else did you bring? Could you say it all at once?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMmh, there\u2019s too much, so it\u2019s a little hard for me to consolidate everything, but let me put it this way\u2026 I even brought condiments along. Do you want some?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Yi wondered if she should be glad to be acquainted. Yao Si seemed like the exploitable sort.</p><br/><p>In contrast, Li Zheng wasn\u2019t the least bit restrained. He took a step forward and blurted the first thing that came to his mind.</p><br/><p>\u201cDad, do you have boxers with you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Yao Si.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Bai Yi.</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>In the end, Yao Si went with the flying devices. It was only after she started the journey that she realized the enormity of the planet. It took an entire afternoon of flying for them to leave the forest, and according to the map, they had only covered a tenth of the distance.</p><br/><p>They were forced to take a break then and continue the next day. It was at that time that she understood the dangers of the planet. Throughout their journey, they witnessed almost all the different natural disaster in existence\u2014earthquakes, volcano eruptions, tornadoes. All of them happened one after another, without any room for a breather.</p><br/><p>A distance that could be covered in about five days took them more than ten days.</p><br/><p>The planet had a fickle temperament that seemed to be changing by the minute, and there was barely a safe spot on which for them to land. If they hadn\u2019t been flying, it was likely they would have long been buried by sudden surges of water or cracks in the ground.</p><br/><p>The erratic environment sent energy bursting through Yao Si, wind, rain, lighting, electricity, gold, wood, water, and fire coming all at once. Her ability was reliable for once, activating any time they came face to face with danger.</p><br/><p>They managed to stay safe through the tricky situations, and on the twelfth day, they finally reached the first checkpoint.</p><br/><p>It\u2026 left Yao Si stunned!</p></div>\n</div>"}

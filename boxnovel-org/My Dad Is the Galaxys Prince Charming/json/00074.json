She smiled, abashed. \u201cHehehe, it\u2019s the same. But Missus, if you wish to tour the area after your training, you can come find me. My service number is 233. I\u2019ll be sure to provide you with a special discount.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSure!\u201d</p><br/><p>The attendant prepared a stack of documents. But just as she was about to continue her introduction of the training, a buzzing sound came from beside her. She placed the documents down and pulled out a paper talisman, then made a strange hand gesture. A white gleam shot into the amulet. The next moment, the woman\u2019s face fell.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Car accident? What happened, there\u2019s a customer here waiting to be transported!\u201d the attendant said in frustration, frowning. \u201cFine fine, you can head over to a pharmacist first. I\u2019ll try to find a solution.\u201d</p><br/><p>The attendant put away the amulet, then, with an apologetic face, she walked back over. \u201cMissus, I\u2019m extremely sorry, I just received a notification that the VIP transport meant just met with an accident. Will it be alright if I arrange for a public transportation for you instead?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo worries, it\u2019s be fine.\u201d Car accident was not something one could predict. Yao Si could understand that.</p><br/><p>\u201cGreat, thank you for your understanding.\u201d The attendant heaved a sigh of relief, thanking her repeatedly. \u201cI will arrange for a transport right away.\u201d</p><br/><p>She pulled yet another purple talisman. After chanting a line, a stream of light flew out. In less than ten seconds, a celestial swan came flying from the thick layer of clouds ahead!</p><br/><p><em>Excuse me! This\u2026 this is their transportation equipment?</em></p><br/><p><em>Hehehe, the celestial race sure is interesting. </em></p><br/><p>\u201cWelcome!\u201d the swan greeted monotonously, once it came to a stop.</p><br/><p>Is it a swan or a parrot\u2026</p><br/><p>The swan stationed itself in front of her before lowering its wings intelligently.</p><br/><p><em>Is it inviting me to sit on its back?</em></p><br/><p>\u201cMissus, please!\u201d</p><br/><p><em>It really wants me to sit on it!</em></p><br/><p>Yao Si got awkwardly up onto the swan before settling in.</p><br/><p>\u201cWishing you a pleasant journey!\u201d Attendant 233 waved towards Yao Si, and with a flap of the swan\u2019s wings, they rose up.</p><br/><p>What surprised Yao Si was the the stability. Despite the repeated vigorous flapping, Yao Si could barely feel the wind. It was akin to sitting on an advanced flying machine. She couldn\u2019t help glancing around at the surroundings\u2014the majority of people at the port were also getting up on celestial swans.</p><br/><p>It seemed like this was the normal transportation among the celestials! It was indeed refreshing, except for\u2026 the influx of advertisements!</p><br/><p>\u201cCelestials\u2019 leading port welcomes you. We offer two different experiences \u2013 tourism and training! There is a total of 811 tourism locations, including\u2026\u201d Then specific descriptions followed.</p><br/><p>Initially, Yao Si thought that the swan was possessed and could now communicate, but soon, she realized that it was simply repeating the same things over and over again. It\u2019s much better than a parrot, it can actually recite texts!</p><br/><p>Yao Si was subjected to its advertisements throughout the entire journey, until they arrived at a massive palace. It had the same vintage vibe. With its red walls and golden roofs, it appeared imposing and majestic. At the entrance was a gold tablet which read: Celestials\u2019 Training Office.</p><br/><p>Yao Si jumped off the swan\u2019s back. Just as she was about to enter the office, the swan turned abruptly, stopping her with its beak. With a screech, it opened its beak wide.</p><br/><p><em>What? Does it want to be adopted? </em></p>\n</div>"}

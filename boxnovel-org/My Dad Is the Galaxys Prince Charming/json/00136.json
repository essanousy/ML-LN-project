Al-alright!\u201d Bai Yi stiffened as he tried to snap out of the shock. His legs had gone soft. When he struck the demonic dragon again, he consciously turned his back to Mu Xuan, trying to reduce his presence. He had never expected His Majesty\u2019s game preferences to be so unique\u2026 What if he were to silence him?</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Li Zheng. <em>Agreed!</em></p><br/><p>\u201cMu Xuan, give me a moment, I\u2019ll save you!\u201d Yao Si shouted toward the transparent bubble that enclosed Mu Xuan as she sent arrows at the BOSS.</p><br/><p>Mu Xuan, who was about to break free with his mental strength, paused as he stared at his anxious cub. Was she\u2026 worried about him? Slowly, he stopped his actions, a sweet warmth spreading across his whole soul. His entire being started to burst into flowers and hearts; maybe he should remain inside a little longer.</p><br/><p>As expected from Poetic Saga\u2019s BOSS, the demonic dragon had a huge supply of blood and a strong defense. Moreover, both Bai Yi and Li Zheng didn\u2019t seem to be at their best, allowing the beast to hit them head on several times. If it weren\u2019t for the mythical equipment, they would have ended up in the revival point.</p><br/><p>Since Yao Si was of the lowest level and was a long-ranged attacker, she had assumed that she would just be a backup, but somehow she was doing the most work. Other than avoiding the dragon\u2019s attacks, she had to constantly remind the other two about doing the same.</p><br/><p><em>This isn\u2019t the promised scenario!</em></p><br/><p>\u201cHey you two, fight seriously!\u201d she howled at them.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, they managed to snap back to their senses, and in less than five minutes, they were in the zone, attacking the BOSS aggressively. The demonic dragon\u2019s blood started to deplete rapidly. After ten minutes, with a thundering howl, it fell from the skies. Even the volcano came crashing down.</p><br/><p>[Despicable! You weasels, even if I die, I will bring you down with me!]</p><br/><p>After another thundering howl, a red glow washed over the dragon, making the whole map tremble.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is bad, the BOSS is about to erupt!\u201d Yao Si\u2019s heart clenched as she glanced into the air at the person closest to the beast. \u201cBai Yi, hurry and leave.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Yi reacted swiftly. Even before reaching the ground, he retreated several meters away. Indeed, the next second, the demonic dragon spat a massive red lighting toward\u2026 Yao Si.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p><em>F*ck!</em></p><br/><p>Why her? Wasn\u2019t her DPS the lowest? The demonic dragon wasn\u2019t being logical!</p><br/><p>Its strike was going to send her back to the revival point\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cDad!\u201d Li Zheng, who had been working to replenish the blood, started to panic. He hurriedly raised the fan in his hand to strike the dragon\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>With a loud thud, a tiny number emerged from the top of the dragon\u2019s head: Blood -1</p><br/><p>As that last drop oozed out, the demonic dragon fell silent, the buzzing from the lightning going silent.</p><br/><p>Everyone heaved a sigh of relief. <em>Thank goodness it\u2019s over.</em></p><br/><p>The transparent bubble enclosing around Mu Xuan burst into pieces that fell to the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cMu Xuan!\u201d Yao Si sprinted over in joy.</p><br/><p>\u201cSisi.\u201d Mu Xuan headed in her direction. At the same time, the task manager beeped: Poetic Saga mission completed!</p><br/><p>Three notices appeared in the sky.</p><br/><p>[Ding! Poetic Saga was completed, and a whole new map has been opened. The Yu Celestial world shall now enter the Celestial Demonic era!]</p><br/><p>[Ding! Congratulations, player *#38, Silence, and Woodstop for completing Poetic Saga. The rewards are experience points worth 5 levels, superior celestial stone x10, Celestial World reputation x10000, Sect Authorisation Pass x1\u2026]</p><br/><p>[Ding! Player Woodstop killed the enemy honorably, striking the demonic dragon with a fatal hit. How could the beauty be immune to that? Celestial Han Yue is aware of his efforts and is willing to devote herself to him! Congratulations, player Woodstop for obtaining Celestial Han Yue\u2019s love, so please complete the marriage vows mission and enter a union. The wedding ceremony shall commence in five minutes. Additional: The game shall include a marriage segment from today onwards!]</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d the trio.</p><br/><p><em>What?</em></p><br/><p>With that, the world chat erupted once more.</p><br/><p>[World(RentMeTheMythicalEquipment): What\u2019s this, isn\u2019t the reward too grand? There\u2019s even a Sect Authorisation pass. Is that an option to create a new cult?]</p><br/><p>[World(CareForSingles): Who cares about the Sect Authorization Pass! The main point is how could a mission reward them with a bride\u2026 Poetic Saga is indeed on another level! Such an innovative game!]</p><br/><p>[World(PoeticSagaIsAMyth): Who cares about the Sect Authorisation Pass! Ahhh\u2026Why is a single like me not blessed with such a thing?]</p><br/><p>[World(JustADouble11): Who cares about the Sect Authorisation Pass! Give me a wife. I won\u2019t exchange it for any Sect Authorisation Pass.]</p><br/><p>[World(FFFGroupCaptain): Who cares about the Sect Authorisation Pass! In the past, I could still tolerate players being lovey-dovey, but do I need to accept a player flaunting love with an NPC now too?!]</p><br/><p>[World(TheAuthorCan\u2019tComeUpWithAnymoreNames): Who cares about the Sect Authorisation Pass\u2026]</p><br/><p>\u2013</p><br/><p>In contrast to the buzz on the world chat, it was dead silence at Yao Si\u2019s side.</p><br/><p>After the announcement was made, the once lava-filled volcano mouth turned into a scenic field filled with fresh flowers of every color, their aroma flooding everyone\u2019s senses.</p><br/><p>With a white glow surrounding both Li Zheng and Mu Xuan, their original outfits disappeared, changing into two ancient costumes in bright red.</p><br/><p>Li Zheng appeared in a bridegroom\u2019s suit while Mu Xuan appeared in the\u2026 bride\u2019s dress!</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Yao Si.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Bai Yi.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Li Zheng.</p><br/><p>Devoting oneself!</p><br/><p>Mu Xuan and\u2026 Li Zheng!</p><br/><p>\u25cb|\uffe3|_</p><br/><p>Didn\u2019t the system have any restraints?! Was there a need to copy \u2018The Brave Warrior\u2019s Battle Against the Evil Dragon\u2019 so completely?</p><br/><p>But\u2026</p><br/><p>But surprisingly, Yao Si was getting excited for the next scene!</p><br/><p>O(\u2229_\u2229)O~</p><br/><p>Mu Xuan\u2019s emotionless face turned black and taut as a dark frosty aura emitted from him. Even the flowers seemed to freeze and shrivel.</p><br/><p>Such murderous intent!</p><br/><p>He should have destroyed the game before it came to this.</p><br/><p>Yao Si and Bai Yi took a large step back, wishing Li Zheng good luck.</p><br/><p>[Ding! Player, please complete the wedding!] Unfortunately, the server kept repeating the task to him.</p><br/><p>\u201cI-i-it wasn\u2019t my doing!\u201d Li Zheng\u2019s legs went soft. \u201cI have no idea what happened. I never intended to marry\u2026 grandpa, you have to believe me\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p><em>Swish!</em></p><br/><p>Without allowing him to speak another word, Mu Xuan waved his arm, sending Li Zheng back to the revival point.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>[Ding! Player killed, marriage mission failed! Change of partners\u2026]</p><br/><p>Before they could react, another announcement sprung up.</p><br/><p>[Ding! Player Silence killed the enemy honorably with the highest amount of damage and is considered a rare hero. Celestial Han Yue is willing to devote her life to him! Please proceed to the wedding altar to complete this union with Celestial Han Yue.]</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Bai Yi the bystander.</p><br/><p><em>F*ck, you can even change partners?</em></p><br/><p>(\u256f\u2035\u25a1\u2032)\u256f\ufe35\u253b\u2501\u253b</p></div>\n</div>"}

The ship had been resting for a long while by then, and its surroundings were silent. No one would notice if they headed out now.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d She went straight for the door, while a certain someone dragged his feet reluctantly while rubbing his bottom.</p><br/><p>\u201cBai Yi, hurry up!\u201d She couldn\u2019t help rushing him.</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it your fault!\u201d He glanced up to glare at her while rubbing his swollen face. \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for you, would I be in this state?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t I help you ?\u201d Besides, since he was a bloodling, those bruises would be gone in less than ten minutes.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow\u2019s that helping?\u201d he exploded. \u201cAm I an ant hole? Escaping with just a few hits?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEr\u2026 You shouldn\u2019t pay attention to the process.\u201d <em>You\u2019re out, after all. </em>\u201cNow that there is nobody around, let\u2019s hurry out! You know how the ship functions, right? As a student in high school, you\u2019ll find a solution, right? I trust you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course!\u201d His face brightened slightly, and he humphed arrogantly. Just then, he seemed to have triggered something, for a bright screen to popped up. It was filled with long red rows , and Bai Yi brought his optical computer closer to them. His screen red then instantly filled with code as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cHeh, it\u2019s just a simple automated door, nobody uses it anymore.\u201d He scoffed, confidence lighting up his face as he started to work on the door.</p><br/><p>After ten minutes\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cThis door was definitely modified! Give me some time.\u201d</p><br/><p>After half an hour\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m almost there, it\u2019s halfway done.\u201d</p><br/><p>After an hour\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cThis model is a little old, I need to recall how it actually works.\u201d</p><br/><p>After two hours\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cThey modified this door way too much, the insides are a mess. Give me another ten minutes to open it!\u201d</p><br/><p>After another half an hour\u2026</p><br/><p>Bai Yi\u2019s was extremely dark. He put away his optical computer and made fists, then punched the door. It buzzed loudly and some sparks flew out. Smoke erupted from the machine, and the next moment, the door burst open.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s done, it\u2019s open now, lets go,\u201d he announced calmly.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p><em>Weren\u2019t you going to be technical? Are you sure you didn\u2019t learn the mechanics from your physical education teacher? </em></p><br/><p>\u201cForget it, let\u2019s hurry, someone should be on their way.\u201d</p><br/><p>Their time was running out.</p><br/><p>Yao Si took large strides out. Fortunately, the ship wasn\u2019t big, so after walking through a short passageway, they found the exit. Yao Si glanced outside and realized that the planet was actually gigantic, but it didn\u2019t seem to be populated. Their surroundings seemed strangely quiet.</p><br/><p>Just as she was about to leave the ship, she hesitated.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Bai Yi asked impatiently.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere aren\u2019t many guards here\u2026\u201d But it seemed to be a large base. \u201cThere should be many security cameras around, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSecurity cameras?\u201d Bai Yi stilled. \u201cAre you referring to biological scans?\u201d He frowned. As if he\u2019d thought of something, he tapped his optical computer and did something on it. \u201cIt\u2019s alright, I\u2019ve something good with me. Once it\u2019s turned on, the security won\u2019t be able to detect us.\u201d</p><br/><p><em>There is such a device? </em> The moment she ran the code, she felt a layer of light scanning her, and she felt at ease.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are we going to do now?\u201d Bai Yi glanced at the almost deserted grounds.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow about we first locate Gu Shucheng?\u201d she replied while scanning the grounds. Nephew Gu had been missing for half a month, so he had to be someone special. \u201cIsn\u2019t your ability to read minds? Get someone and read his mind before we\u2026 Hey, hey, what are you doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Yi had raised his arm and struck a guard that was close by. \u201cDidn\u2019t you want me to read someone\u2019s mind?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d <em>You can only read an unconscious person? </em></p><br/><p>\u201cStand guard here.\u201d He threw a weapon on the floor before her. \u201cIf there are too many thoughts, it\u2019ll be hard to spot any important information. While I\u2019ll be using my ability, stop anyone from disrupting me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMmh.\u201d Yao Si nodded.</p><br/><p>Bai Yi knelt down beside the person and placed his hand on his forehead. The next instant, Yao Si felt a tingling sensation moving from him to the person\u2019s forehead.</p><br/><p>Gradually, she felt a familiar surge within her, and she was suddenly curious. Since mind reading allowed one to read others\u2019 thoughts, what would the inverse ability be\u2026</p><br/><p>Eh? What\u2019s that?</p><br/><p>A bright glow flashed in front of her eyes, forming two neat rows of words\u2026</p><br/><p>Words?!</p><br/><p>The words were positioned directly above Bai Yi and the guard\u2019s heads.</p><br/><p>The were:</p><br/><p>[Guard 1 fainted in glory from an intruder\u2019s attack. But the attacker did not know that the guard had been through a special training, even if he died, he would never tell the intruder that the two bloodlings they captured were kept in individual cells in basement five. The intruder would also never know that the pass for every floor was different. This guard could only enter basement two, and his pass was currently located in his right pocket.]</p><br/><p>[No one knew that Bai Yi had no intention to use his mind reading ability since it wasn\u2019t at a stable state. He wasn\u2019t able to control it at will, and due to its instability, he didn\u2019t have many friends. However, in order to mock Shucheng, he was willing to endure an attempt at using his ability. But he had never expected that this guard\u2019s thoughts would be filled with pretty girls from a porn movie, making it almost impossible to find any useful information]</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>What were the words in brackets? Were they subtitles?</p><br/><p>Why was her ability providing her with subtitles? And why were they from a third person\u2019s perspective?</p><br/><p>On second look, she realized that the words weren\u2019t in the Galactic language but rather pure traditional Chinese, Ariel, font size five, and in bold.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s quite scary to find words written over people\u2019s heads\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cI found it, Shucheng is in\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBasement five.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026 How do you know?\u201d Bai Yi stilled.</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe\u2026\u201d Yao Si\u2019s face twitched. \u201cIt\u2019s..hard to explain.\u201d She refused to answer the question, and instead reached for the guard\u2019s pocket. There was indeed a translucent card there. \u201cLet\u2019s go down.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Yi followed her in confusion, the two rows of words above his head morphing into another line.</p><br/><p>[Bai Yi is filled with doubt, he feels that the president that came out of nowhere is getting more and more mysterious. Was she just Shucheng\u2019s lover? What did they do together? He was suddenly reminded of the movie scene in the guard\u2019s mind\u2014]</p><br/><p>\u201cEnough!\u201d</p>\n</div>"}

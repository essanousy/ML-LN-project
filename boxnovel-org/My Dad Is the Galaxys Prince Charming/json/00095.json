It was definitely on another level, right?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t\u2026 we take a break in the forest nearby?\u201d he suggested.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Chatterbox Qin was the first to object. \u201cWith your luck, we would probably run into a demonic beast\u2019s nest.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si nodded. The experiences of the past month told her that it really might happen. Even though it might not be anything of high level and could be easily dealt with by his sword, another beast would probably appear in just a matter of minutes.</p><br/><p>\u201cLets head to the river side instead!\u201d She pointed in the opposite direction, playing close attention to his jinx nature.</p><br/><p>Zan Zichen turned his head without any objection and started making a fire for cooking. Even though he was a jinx, his culinary skills weren\u2019t bad at all. The duck blood curd he prepared with readily available ingredients was comparable to that of her nanny dad.</p><br/><p>He was responsible for the meals throughout the trip and was a travel must have.</p><br/><p>Yao Si finished three full bowls with satisfaction, feeling pleased and energized. Just as she was planning to get a forth bowl, her optical computer buzzed, and a sentence popped out.</p><br/><p>[There is ten minutes left for the training you have registered!]</p><br/><p><em>F*ck!</em></p><br/><p>Yao Si\u2019s hand trembled, and she almost dropped the bowl in her hands. Why was it ending so fast? Hasn\u2019t it only been a little over a month? Wasn\u2019t it supposed to be two months? She whipped out the timer in the optical computer.</p><br/><p>As expected, it stated\u201459 days and 14 hours.</p><br/><p>The reminder on the optical computer wasn\u2019t wrong. This meant that it was probably due to her being sent to Region 4 which had a different time flow from the the planet of Shadow which caused the difference of some time.</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d Zan Zichen asked, glancing over at her.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you perhaps ingest some worms?\u201d Qin Changle suggested.</p><br/><p>Yao Si placed her bowl down. \u201cI think\u2026 I think I have to go.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGo?\u201d Qin Changle bolted upright. \u201cWhere do you want to go? Our contract hasn\u2019t been resolved yet. Are you going to forsake me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d <em>What the f*ck do you mean by forsake? Do you not know what it means?</em>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, the contract will be broken once I leave.\u201d She had intended to seek help from the service staff, but there wasn\u2019t enough time.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m\u2026 sure?\u201d Everything related to the indigenous tribes was prohibited from leaving the planet of Shadow, so once she reached the celestial realm, the f*cking contract would automatically be resolved\u2026 Right?</p><br/><p>As opposed to Qin Changle\u2019s agitation, Zan Zichen was much calmer after his initial shock. \u201cAre you going to leave this world?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Yao Si nodded. \u201cThere isn\u2019t enough time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen\u2026 are you coming back?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI might not\u2026\u201d <em>Dad doesn\u2019t approve of my leaves! But wait a minute\u2026 </em> \u201cYou know about it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zan Zichen nodded. \u201cI could vaguely tell that senior is from the higher lands and will eventually head back.\u201d But he never expected it to come so soon. Zan Zichen clenched his fists, bowing to her in respect. \u201cThank you senior for your guidance. I wish you eternal happiness, luck, and peace.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you!\u201d Yao Si nodded. Even though the child was a jinx, he was honest and sincere. After spending a month together, she was a little reluctant to leave\u2026 the duck blood curd he cooked.</p><br/><p>\u201cJinx\u2026 Zan Zichen! Practice diligently and we will meet again.\u201d <em>Once you become a member of the Celestial Clan, you can head over to the Red Planet. </em></p><br/><p>\u201cAlright!\u201d He nodded vigorously. \u201cI will work hard to ascend!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGreat!\u201d Yao Si tapped open the space within her optical computer and started to rummage about it. Soon after, she pulled out a circular egg along with nine soul-calling pills, which she stuffed into his arms. \u201cWith your physique, you should keep these pills with you at all times.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have been holding onto this egg for an extremely long time. It was gifted by a friend and is most likely a part of your world, but I have no idea what it is. Anyways, I\u2019m giving it to you.\u201d <em>After eating your duck blood curd for so many days, it is only right for me to return the favor. </em></p><br/><p>Zan Zichen didn\u2019t stand on ceremony. He took the egg and started to study it, but he couldn\u2019t seem to figure out what it was, so he dumped it into his sack. \u201cThank you, senior.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d Yao Si waved her hand as the optical computer sent out a notification alarm.</p><br/><p>[There is less than one minutes left of your training package. Please hold onto all of your personal belongings. Preparing to take off: 5\u20264\u2026]</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll head off first, remember to look for me after you ascend. I\u2019ll be in the Red Planet!\u201d Yao Si reminded hastily. The next second, the scenery changed from a vast greenland into the misty and cloud-filled celestial realm.</p><br/><p>The training time on her optical computer dropped to zero.</p><br/><p>The celestials were indeed business minded, unwilling to waste even a minute. Yao Si inhaled, glancing at the cloud and mist that surrounded the simple and imposing pier. After two months trying to survive in the wild, she seemed to have ventured into a new generation. As opposed to the two months of wildlife, this environment was clearly\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cA feast for the eyes!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d <em>A feast for the eyes? Who came up with that description?</em></p><br/><p><em>Eh?</em></p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck! Chatterbox Qin!\u201d Weren\u2019t the indigenous tribe members prohibited from leaving Shadow?! This had to be a joke. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow can I know?\u201d he asked innocently. \u201cI just felt a yank, and the next moment I was here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yank? That was not possible, the celestial clan would not transport the indigenous tribe members so readily. Besides, even if they had been forcefully brought over, they would be blasted back by the lighting if their physique wasn\u2019t level SSS.</p><br/><p><em>Wait a minute!</em></p><br/><p>Before she had transported, there seemed to have been a reminder to hold onto all personal belongings! Since Qin Changle was tied to her by the mental strength marking and was also considered her contracted beast\u2026</p><br/><p>Did the transportation system treat him as her belonging?</p><br/><p>Could it be so negligent?!</p><br/><p>The eldest disciple of the top sect\u2014contracted beast\u2014personal belonging\u2026</p><br/><p>Chatterbox Qin\u2019s social status had just went down the drain!</p><br/><p>However, a certain someone was completely oblivious and was instead glancing about with curiosity and interest. \u201cHey, hey, hey, demonic girl! Where is this? Is this the celestial realm? Are you really a celestial from above? Then\u2026 did I ascend to a celestial?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo! You are at most considered a delivery.\u201d</p><br/><p>What exactly was happening?</p><br/><p>\u201cWelcome back to the Celestial Planet\u2019s returning pier.\u201d A female celestial was already flying toward them with a polite smile. \u201cYour training has been tough, but please follow the orders\u2026 Indigenous tribe member!\u201d She froze, pointing toward Qin Changle with a face of horror.</p><br/><p>After half a second, she turned and drew something in the air. Seconds later, a ray of light came shooting over.</p><br/><p>Yao Si\u2019s heart sank. She was a goner.</p><br/><p>As expected, in less than a minute, a huge group of celestials dressed in white flew over. They arrived with an ethereal air. As opposed to the service crew from before, they all held long swords in their hands and had hostile expressions.</p><br/><p>Were they\u2026 security guards?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d a solemn voice asked. The man didn\u2019t come on a flying sword but was instead walking in the air. A lotus bloomed with every step he took, his entire being emitting a holy and pure white glow.</p><br/><p>Yao Si felt her mouth twitch. What was with the entrance? Such effort was deserving full 100 marks! But\u2026 why did he seem a little girly?</p><br/><p>\u201cNumber 233, why did you activate the highest level alarm?\u201d The man that was putting on a front turned toward the female celestial who still flying nearby.</p><br/><p>She seemed immune to his superfluous entrance and took several steps forward to perform a greeting. She then pointed toward Yao Si and started to explain.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? She smuggled out an indigenous tribe member?\u201d The man finally turned to glance at Yao Si, taking hurried steps over. In a displeased tone, he started, \u201cCustomer, don\u2019t you know the training rules? Everything from the primitive planet is prohibited from leaving, even the local specialties!\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Changle transformed from a personal belonging to a local specialty.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not it, it\u2019s a misunderstanding, let me explain\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour actions have severely breached the galactic convention! This indigenous tribe member is not ready to ascend. He has to be detained and sent back.\u201d</p><br/><p><em>Hey! What\u2019s with your accusatory expression?</em></p><br/><p>\u201cThis\u2026 Master, he really wasn\u2019t brought over by me. Your system is responsible for sending him over!\u201d <em>Shouldn\u2019t you guys be the ones giving me an explanation?</em></p><br/><p>\u201cThe transportation spell was cast by the master himself, so there is no way it would go wrong.\u201d The celestial completely dismissed Yao Si\u2019s explanation and was instead looking at her with a reproachful expression. \u201cEven though you are a customer, you are obliged to follow our rules. Whether you admit it or not, in view of your violation, you are prohibited from entering the celestial realm within the next ten years. Please show your ship details, and we will arrange for you to leave immediately.\u201d</p><br/><p><em>Enough! </em> There was no way to clear her name, but Yao Si could finally heave a sigh of relief, knowing they would send Chatterbox Qin back. She reached out to flash her optical computer.</p><br/><p>The celestial used a rectangular detection device to scan her optical computer, and her ship details popped out on it. \u201cMiss Siyao, ship number F233 will take off in ten minutes toward\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He paused mid-sentence, opening his eyes wide as though he had come across unbelievable information. His face of reproach paled instantly, and even his hands began to tremble.</p><br/><p><em>What\u2019s wrong?</em></p><br/><p>\u201cRe-re-red Planet,\u201d he stuttered, barely able to continue. He started to tremble even more, then he clenched his teeth. It was a stark contrast to the solemn celestial from before that couldn\u2019t be thrown off-center.</p><br/><p>The next moment, he broke into a radiant smile. \u201cI see\u2026 You\u2019re our valued bloodling customer. It\u2019s a misunderstanding\u2026 misunderstanding! Was your journey enjoyable? Do you have any valuable feedback to give us? Is this local specialty up to your standards? Don\u2019t worry, we celestials promise only the best quality. If you aren\u2019t satisfied, you can return, exchange, of have it fixed.\u201d</p><br/><p><em>Wasn\u2019t this drastic change a little too fast?! </em></p><br/><p>\u201cYour ship is about to head off. Other than him, did you bring along any other local specialties? Do you need delivery service?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Chatterbox Qin had somehow become a local specialty which was allowed to be brought out of the primitive planet. Regardless of Yao Si\u2019s explanation on how she had no intentions of bringing him out of Shadow and that it was due to the blasted contract, the managing celestials remained persistent and refused to believe her. They explained their inability to send him back to the planet, that if they were to forcefully bring him over, he might be killed by the lighting surrounding the planet.</p><br/><p>Yao Si was left with no choice, and the group of celestials politely yet cautiously and excitedly sent her up to the ship. When she regained her senses, she was already back home with the local specialty.</p><br/><p>She sat on the coach uneasily, sneaking glances at a certain nanny dad that wore a dark expression. Yao Si had no clue where to begin. It might be an illusion, but ever since she had brought Chatterbox Qin through the door, the temperature indoors seemed to have plunged by a few degrees. She glanced over at the thermostat. Was it really not faulty?!</p><br/><p>With a deep breath, she cautiously sneaked a glance at the person in front of her. \u201cDad!\u201d</p><br/><p>Mu Xuan remained silent, but his emotionless expression grew even more freezing. An eerie cold aura surrounded him.</p><br/><p><em>It\u2019s getting bad! </em> He wasn\u2019t even correcting the way she addressed him, which had to mean that he was really angry.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can explain!\u201d Yao Si removed the necklace that contained her nanny dad\u2019s mental strength and raised her paw, prepared to take the initiative.</p><br/><p>Mu Xuan remained motionless, but his gaze slowly moved from her toward Qin Changle, the local specialty. The temperature seemed to plunge further, icy cold air shooting in all directions.</p><br/><p>He hadn\u2019t seen his cub in two months, she had ditched the people he had assigned to take care of her and headed out all on her own, and had even brought a stranger back home.</p><br/><p>A man! A living one! The kind that was still breathing.</p><br/><p>Mu Xuan wanted to kill someone!</p>\n</div>"}

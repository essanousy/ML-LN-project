They all felt like crying!</p><br/><p>They had left her highness in an unfamiliar game, alone! They all felt like crying!</p><br/><p>Their highness was lonely and helpless in the game, passing time and finding amusement by killing rabbits. They all felt like wailing loudly!</p><br/><p>They didn\u2019t even know how much her highness had to suffer to be able to collect that many relics. They felt like bawling their eyes out!</p><br/><p>They only realized that there was such a problem after a month had passed. They felt like dying!</p><br/><p>Hence, when Yao Si finally escaped from the game, what welcomed her were faces filled with heartache, bitterness, and sorrow. Watery eyes stared at her as if they were about to burst into tears the next moment.</p><br/><p>Having been baptised by these sights before, Yao Si felt that after being stared and glared at\u2026 You eventually get used to it!</p><br/><p>\u256e(\u256f\ufe4f\u2570\uff09\u256d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour highness, this is the fresh blood of the light globe beast that I just conveyed from the animal-taming planet, it is quite flavorful.\u201d A middle-aged man held a bowl of bright red blood curd before her, and said with great respect, \u201cIf you don\u2019t detest it, try have a taste.\u201d</p><br/><p>The corner of Yao Si\u2019s mouth twitched. \u201cEh\u2026 Not so much detest.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s excellent. I heard from my little girl that this was voted out as the most popular item by the bloodlings.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes\u2026 It does smell nice.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis blood even has the effect of replenishing energy, exactly what your highness needs right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have a small problem.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo say, your highness.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs gifting blood-curd a common visiting gift in the galaxy?\u201d She tapped a table top and immediately a ray of white light flashed, then a whole table sfull of the same blood curd suddenly appeared. \u201cBecause, I have already received forty today.\u201d In addition to the other blood curd she\u2019d already drank, she was stuffed.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d The man\u2019s mouth twitched. <em>Holy shit! </em> Those old bastards were even faster than him.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour highness\u2026 As long as you have eaten it\u2019s fine!\u201d The old man set the bowl in his hand down and looked at Yao Si. Suddenly, a sour feeling rose from the bottom of his heart. \u201cEvery time I think of you being trapped inside the game for a whole month without eating or drinking anything, that feeling in my heart\u2026 It\u2019s the incompetence of us youngsters, making you our ancestor suffer through such a thing.\u201d</p><br/><p>His eyes turned red, and he sniffled as he said, \u201cHow about you scold me, your highness, or giving me a beating is fine too! That way my heart can feel better.\u201d He looked like he was about to burst into tears on the spot.</p><br/><p>Yao Si picked the bowl from the table with great awkwardness. \u201cI\u2019ll drink, I\u2019ll drink as you wish!\u201d</p><br/><p>Who said the bloodlings were all like reserved nobility? Then why did all those she met over the past few days were baby-sitter like. It\u2019s just being trapped in the game for a month, to be honest, she didn\u2019t even take it seriously. She even wanted to try it again. One month was nothing, she was a person who had \u201cslept\u201d through the humans on Earth. No! She was a ghost now!</p><br/><p>She gritted her teeth and forced a bowl of blood curd down, then to prevent the man from taking another one out without warning, she changed the topic straightaway. \u201cHow should I address you, uncle!\u201d</p><br/><p>Those that came to feed her usually left after they gave her the blood curd, or at most dawdled for a bit and then left. However, this uncle had sat down straightaway, and had an air about him as if he wanted to have a long heart-to-heart talk with her.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour highness, you are killing me, I can\u2019t endure this \u201cuncle\u201d from you.\u201d He quickly stood up, and with a more respectful attitude said, \u201cI am of the thirty-seventh generation, currently the thirteenth elder of our race. My last name is also Yao. Your highness, you can just call me Yao.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Yao.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Si\u2019s facial muscles jerked. If she referred to a person who looked decades older than her like that, she had the feeling that she would be struck by thunder the next moment. She collected herself, then asked, \u201cElder Yao, is there any particular problem you want to ask me about?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ever since they learned that she was a fifth-generation, Yan Xuan and other bloodlings did everything and were only a short step away from worshiping her. Despite guessing from the very beginning that after they learned of her bloodline they would have a change in attitude toward her, this change\u2026 was quite frightening.</p><br/><p>That day, they moved her into this manor that was a size beyond her comprehension without any hesitation. She had lost count of those that came to meet her and gift her blood curd everyday. It gave her a indistinct feeling that she had moved out of the kindergarten, only to be moved into a zoo.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour highness, the matter is.\u201d Elder Yao straightened his body like he was about to report at work. \u201cIn consideration of our previous negligence at work which resulted in some unforgivable mistakes, to prevent such an incident from occurring ever again, and to help your highness get to know this world better. Through discussions with the state council and the elders\u2019 committee, it was decided that from today onwards, I will personally protect you during the whole day, all twenty-four hours, as well as manage your daily life. In other words, starting from today, I am your butler.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh\u2026\u201d So to be her butler, this sort of thing required the state council\u2019s decision? \u201cThen thank you!\u201d She did need someone to help her understand this society, after all.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour highness, you\u2019re too polite.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026 Can you not call me your highness.\u201d Where did they get this name from, it sounded quite strange. \u201cYao Si will be fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour highness has such a regal status, how can us youngsters casually refer to you by your name!\u201d The man\u2019s face had the words \u2018Your highness\u2019s is honorable and divine, and cannot be violated\u2019 written all over it, and he swiftly turned down her suggestion. \u201cThis, all of the bloodling race will not agree .\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d <em>Alright, as long as you\u2019re happy. </em> \u201cWhat you meant is that, if I have any needs in the future, I can look for you, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, just like that.\u201d The old man nodded solemnly, bowing his body and completely entering the butler mode. \u201cWhere would your highness like to start?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCan you teach me your language?\u201d She took the translating device from her ear and waved it at him. \u201cAlthough this is convenient, it doesn\u2019t seem to work in the galactic network.\u201d Communication was the greatest issue she needed to resolve right now.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d He nodded. \u201cRegarding this, I have already arranged for it the day that your highness exited the game. The woman is a bloodling who\u2019s proficient in the ancient Earth language. Soon, she will come report here and teach you the common language of the galaxy.\u201d</p><br/><p>So they had already arranged a private tutor. Yao Si let out a sigh of relief.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I will have to trouble you in the future!\u201d She patted his shoulder. \u201cOh, by the way, I forgot to ask your full name, elder?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour highness, my last name is Yao, and my first name is a single character Qian.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Qian\u2026</p><br/><p>Need money <sup>1</sup> ! (\u2299 o \u2299)</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s convenient for you to tell me, how much do you earn each month?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Your highness, my salary is given out by the Elders\u2019 Committee.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s assuring.\u201d <em>So he earns allowances from the bloodling race!</em></p><br/><p>She had begun to worry for a moment if she could afford him or not.</p><br/><p>Elder Yao was about to inform her about something else when suddenly a long note of notifications began to ring from his hand.</p><br/><p>Outside the gate, the doorbell also rang.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a visitor coming.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho\u2019s coming?\u201d Yao Si asked casually.</p><br/><p>Elder Yao clicked open his optical computer, and a small holographic screen appeared immediately before him. As he clicked on the optical computer, he explained to her, \u201cIt\u2019s probably the person who\u2019s here to teach your highness the galactic common\u2026 Oh shit!\u201d He stopped in the middle of the sentence and with a slap closed the optical computer in a flash. It was so fast, his hand turned red. \u201cHow could it be him!\u201d</p><br/><p>Who?</p>\n</div>"}

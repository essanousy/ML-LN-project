She started to question her appearance and wasn\u2019t able to regain her sense for the next three days. Even her appetite for duck blood curd was affected.</p><br/><p>In order not to implicate the aquatic people, she decided to boost her ego.</p><br/><p>Even though she wasn\u2019t a beauty, she was definitely not that bad either. Besides, beauty was in the eye of the beholder. Since mermen were part human, their sense of beauty was probably half human as well! Maybe their perception was totally unlike what she was assuming and at most half of what a human\u2019s perception was. That was definitely it!</p><br/><p>\u201cMu Xuan, am I pretty?\u201d She turned toward the person beside her.</p><br/><p>\u201cMmh, pretty!\u201da certain someone replied without hesitation.</p><br/><p>See! Reassurance from the Galaxy\u2019s male god himself.</p><br/><p>\u256d(\u256f^\u2570)\u256e</p><br/><p>After successfully stitching back her ego, Yao Si chased off all doubts about her looks and was back under the illusion that she was pretty!</p><br/><p>For the entire journey, Lu Chen continually fed them information about his family background. According to him, he belonged to a side faction of Yao\u2019s Lu family. They were the managers of several ore planets and were focused mainly on T Galaxy, District 95.</p><br/><p>Earlier, he\u2019d went there to inspect the extraction process and supervise the delivery of the newest batch of ore to the factories in purification planets so that additional work could be done.</p><br/><p>However, he\u2019d forgotten to bring enough oil, no, energy and was forced to stop by the Aqua Planet.</p><br/><p>Yao Si who had just embarked on her Galaxy-spanning excursion had no idea how the ore planets looked, so she decided to head over and join in on the fun.</p><br/><p>\u201cSis, you\u2019re here at the right time indeed.\u201d Lu Chen thumped his chest in excitement. \u201cThe Ore Planet is a privately owned planet by my Lu Family. It has a unique, unmatched scenery that not everyone is authorized to lay eyes on, but don\u2019t worry, even though I\u2019m just from a side faction of the Lu Family, I still have some say within the planet.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat kind of ores do you harvest?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNaturally it\u2019s the awakening ore!\u201d Lu Chen replied. \u201cMy planet is widely known in the Galaxy as the place where the awakening ore is harvested.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAwakening ore?\u201d What\u2019s that?</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the main ingredient for the creation of mental strength stimulant,\u201d Mu Xuan explained. \u201cA certain component can only be found in that ore!\u201d</p><br/><p>Mental strength needed to be stimulated? Why was hers trained then?</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, only the Lu Family is able to produce such a medicine.\u201d Lu Chen nodded. While slamming his fists onto his thighs, he added, \u201cI forgot that you guys are bloodlings! With your ability, your mental strength is unleashed naturally so there\u2019s no need for this medication. But many other races who have no ability and who wish to utilize their mental strength buy this medication.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I see!</p><br/><p>\u201cHurry, look, we\u2019re here!\u201d Lu Chen shouted as he pointed ahead of them.</p><br/><p>Yao Si lifted her head and looked at the darkening skies. Suddenly, a gigantic white planet appeared. It was surrounded by a layer of something, just like the Aqua Planet. That substance was crystal-like and breathtaking.</p><br/><p>It was the first time Yao Si had seen such a planet. It was just like a crystal ball, with scenery as unmatched as Lu Chen had made it out to be.</p><br/><p>Just as they were about to enter, an automated message sounded, and the entire aircraft lit up in red.</p><br/><p>[Ding! This is a privately owned planet, government officials or anyone else are prohibited from entering. Employees please produce your identification and proceed to registration.]</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is a normal procedure since security on the Ore Planet is rather tight, but don\u2019t worry, it\u2019ll only take a moment.\u201d Lu Chen turned to smile at them while three screens flashed behind his back. \u201cI have managerial level authority, so give me a moment. I\u2019ll register first before helping you gain access.\u201d</p><br/><p>He lifted his hand to swipe one of the screens.</p><br/><p>[Didi! Lack of authority, entry restricted!]</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Lu Chen.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Yao Si.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Mu Xuan.</p><br/><p>Where was the manager you mentioned?</p><br/><p>(\ufe41\ufe41)~\u2192</p><br/><p>\u201cIt can\u2019t be!\u201d Lu Chen exclaimed in disbelief. He opened his employee\u2019s details to take a closer look, and the position \u2018manager\u2019 was clearly stated there. \u201cI\u2019m correct, it\u2019s this planet, so why is it restricted?\u201d \u201d</p><br/><p>He raised his hand to wave at the sensor once more.</p><br/><p>[Didi! Lack of authority, entry restricted!]</p><br/><p>[Didi! Lack of authority, entry restricted!]</p><br/><p>[Didi! Scanning exceeds three times, account locked. Please leave the vicinity in ten minutes or be prepared for an undiscriminating attack.]</p><br/><p>Lu Chen paled, his entire face collapsing as he stared at the sensor. He wanted to act dumb but who would have known it would go so overboard.</p><br/><p>\u201cI-I just sent the headquarters a message to ask about the situation. There must be something wrong with the security system.\u201d Lu Chen glanced back at them awkwardly. He anxiously opened his optical computer to scan the communication column.</p><br/><p>After a short while\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cEh? Why can\u2019t I get through? Isn\u2019t the headquarters working today?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cForget it!\u201d Yao Si\u2019s eyes twitches. She took a step forward to glance at the sensor that was on ten minutes countdown. \u201cLet\u2019s leave first. We can come back after clarifying the situation.\u201d She pointed toward the countdown. \u201cThis\u2014\u201d</p><br/><p>[Ding! Highest authority, entry activated! Welcome to Lu Family\u2019s Ore Planet. We wish you a pleasant flight!]</p><br/><p>A row of words flashed across her screen.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ahh?</p><br/><p>(\u2299_\u2299)</p><br/><p>Lu Chen and Mu Xuan turned to her in unison while Yao Si froze. \u201cStop looking at me, I have no idea what happened!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ahh?</p><br/><p>(\u2299_\u2299)</p><br/><p>Lu Chen\u2019s face was full of confusion, but the defence system surrounding the planet were starting to inch away. They were really granted access!</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s weird, your optical computer\u2026\u201d He grabbed a handful of hair while sighing. \u201cForget it, there seems to be something wrong with the security system. Mmh, once we reach the planet, I\u2019ll arrange for the technicians to take a look.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Chen smiled apologetically before starting up his aircraft toward the Ore Planet. As they entered, he introduced the land, the culture, and the people enthusiastically.</p><br/><p>\u201cOre Planet was originally uninhabited. It was discovered and then mined by the Lu Family\u2019s company. There are many mines here, and we\u2019ll be heading to the biggest one at district 9.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMmh, mmh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe majority of employees are from the bests They are of at least S level physique, have impressive endurance, and possess bestial DNA which makes them the most suitable people for extracting ores.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBests?\u201d What race was that?</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, beast are considered the most diverse race. Due to their differences in genetic makeup, each of them looks different. I\u2019m sure you will never see so many bests at once as you will see here!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally?!\u201d Now Yao Si was getting curious.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut\u2026 sis, you must not be frightened. Even though they seem burly and tough, they have pleasant personalities and are rather easygoing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Once the aircraft landed, Lu Chen brought them to the gates, speaking relentlessly as they walked.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t believe the news on the Galactic web about how the bests are pirates. Those people are just prejudiced against their kind! After employing them for so many years, we have always maintained a harmonious\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStop moving!\u201d Before he could finish his sentence, a bunch of half-human, half- tiger/lion/cheetah beings came dashing toward them with their arms outstretched. \u201cThis place has been taken over by us. It is now the territory of the beasts. Raise your hands!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Yao Si.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Mu Xuan.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Lu Chen.</p><br/><p>Yao Si could vaguely hear the sound of a face being slapped. Where\u2019s the harmony you spoke of?!</p><br/><p>(\u256f\u2035\u25a1\u2032)\u256f\ufe35\u253b\u2501\u253b</p><br/>\n</div>"}

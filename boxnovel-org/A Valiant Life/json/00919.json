Among these cases, there were many unsolved mysteries throughout the whole nation.</p><br/><p>A particular case which had not been solved yet caught his attention.</p><br/><p>\u201cFinancial genius Shi Yun. Left his company in May last year. Did his emigration procedures and vanished since with no traces.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao tian looked at this case and found it very strange. For such an important person to disappear mysteriously after leaving the country, how was that possible?</p><br/><p>Moreover, there had even been follow-up investigations. Even after liaising with the international police, they still couldn\u2019t find him.</p><br/><p>Hence, this file had been here the whole time. It hadn\u2019t been solved since.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-2\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>*Ring ring*</p><br/><p>The phone rang.</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian lit up his cigarette before looking at his phone display. He couldn\u2019t help but smile. It was a call from Master Lin.</p><br/><p>He was extremely grateful to Lin Fan. Ever since getting to know him, Liu Xiao Tian\u2019s luck had been great.</p><br/><p>For him to have attained his position as Deputy Bureau Chief, it was due in large part to the numerous cases that Master Lin had helped him to crack.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it, Master Lin?\u201d after answering the call, he asked with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cInspector Liu, save me\u2026\u201d Lin Fan cried out.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Liu Xiao Tian\u2019s expression turned grave. For Master Lin to be crying for help, something severe must have happened. Then, he asked anxiously, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? What happened?\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-3\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cNo, nothing happened. But please come by tomorrow to help me out. I really can\u2019t take it anymore. I\u2019ve come across a multi-level marketer and he\u2019s the type that won\u2019t rest until I\u2019ve been converted.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMulti-level marketer?\u201d Liu Xiao Tian was taken aback. He felt that it was strange. Which dumbass would try to recruit Master Lin into multi-level marketing?</p><br/><p>Wasn\u2019t that just asking for death?</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah! There are an old man and a young lady. Don\u2019t you think they\u2019re strange? They\u2019re asking me to join a research for immortality. That\u2019s f*cking insane,\u201d said Lin Fan helplessly.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Liu Xiao Tian was stunned. Then, he burst into laughter. \u201cHaha, Master Lin, did you say they\u2019re asking you to research immortality?\u201d</p><br/><p>He wondered if he had misheard that.</p><br/><p>Hearing Liu Xiao Tian\u2019s laugh, Lin Fan was annoyed. \u201cInspector Liu, please be more serious. I\u2019m reporting a case here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, alright. I have to be serious.\u201d Liu Xiao Tian still couldn\u2019t contain his laughter. He felt that this situation was really amusing.</p><br/><p><em>Looking for Master Lin to research immortality. What kind of brain must this person have to think of that?</em></p><br/><p><em>But it does make sense. Master Lin is so amazing, he might just be able to discover the key to immortality. When that happens, we\u2019ll be able to enjoy some glory as well.</em></p><div class=\"code-block code-block-4\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cAre you listening?\u201d Lin Fan prompted.</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian replied, \u201cI am, I am.\u201d</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t let Master Lin know that he had been daydreaming. That would upset Master Lin for sure.</p><br/><p>Moreover, he started to view this matter more seriously. After all, something really didn\u2019t feel right. \u201cMaster Lin, how should we locate this person?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cSend someone to Cloud Street to wait out tomorrow. That old man will be coming.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian said, \u201cAlright then. Don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll go there personally tomorrow. I\u2019ll see just what there is to research about immortality.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cAlright. My safety depends on you. I have to admit, who doesn\u2019t want immortality, right? But he has to at least look reliable. He even said that he\u2019s from overseas. I really have nothing to say to that.\u201d</p><br/><p>The next day!</p><br/><p>Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was waiting in his shop. <em>Let\u2019s see if the old man will be able to leave today if he comes again.</em></p><br/><p><em>Immortality?</em></p><br/><p><em>Does he think he can f*cking defy nature?</em></p><div class=\"code-block code-block-5\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang sat on the chair, playing with his phone. \u201cBrother Lin, is that old man going to come today or not?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cJust wait. I have a feeling that he will come for sure.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian muttered, \u201cI chatted with that old man for a while yesterday. I feel that his idea of immortality is actually quite reliable. Even I was moved by his idea.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang taunted, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you join him then?\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian looked annoyed. \u201cWhen he asked me what I know, I said I don\u2019t know anything. After that, he didn\u2019t talk to me anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, when he saw that you don\u2019t know anything but still wanted to attain immortality, he must\u2019ve thought you were dreaming!\u201d Zhao Zhong Yang roared with laughter.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian glanced at him. \u201cLaugh. All you know is how to laugh. It seems to me that besides broadcasting, you don\u2019t know anything else either.\u201d</p><br/><p>*Cough cough*</p><br/><p>Then, the sound of coughing could be heard. Everyone looked outside. The old man was here again.</p><br/><p>And this time, he walked into the shop with a big smile. \u201cMaster Lin, have you considered it? If you still have any doubts, you can follow me to America and go have a look at my place. It will definitely leave you satisfied.\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-6\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the old man and couldn\u2019t help but laugh. \u201cWhy don\u2019t I help you read your fortune?\u201d</p><br/><p>The old man was taken aback. \u201cWhy would you need to read my fortune, Master Lin?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shook his head, then rubbed his fingers together in an act. \u201cI just did a reading. You\u2019ll be faced with imprisonment, do you believe me?\u201d</p><br/><p>The old man laughed. \u201cMaster Lin, you really know how to joke. Why don\u2019t we get down to business? Even though immortality might seem like a joke, with Master Lin\u2019s understanding of Chinese medicine, you must understand the profoundness of the human body. Immortality isn\u2019t just blind talk. It can be proven by science.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have to fly back tonight. Please consider it seriously. The opportunity is right in front of you. If you miss out, you may regret it for the rest of your life,\u201d the old man said with a calm and regretful tone.</p><br/><p>It was as if he knew that if Lin Fan rejected, he would lose out on something of insurmountable importance.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin\u2026\u201d At that moment, Liu Xiao Tian entered with two police officers. When he entered, he gazed at the old man as if he was sizing him up.</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan saw that Liu Xiao Tian had come, he instantly started laughing. \u201cYou came just in time. Hurry up and bring this multi-level marketer back for questioning.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian went in front of the old man. \u201cPlease show us your ID.\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-7\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cID?\u201d The old man was startled. Then, he shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m a Chinese American. I don\u2019t have an ID.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlso, I\u2019m not a multi-level marketer. I\u2019m the person-in-charge of IOA Human Genome Corporation. I came to Shanghai to invite Master Lin to join our corporation to research the wonders of the human body together and to find the key to immortality as soon as possible,\u201d facing the policemen, the old man spoke indifferently.</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian laughed. \u201cImmortality? It seems to me that you are a multi-level marketer. Bring him back for investigations.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two police officers immediately apprehended the old man. To them, there was something not right about this old man.</p><br/><p>The old man was enraged. \u201cYou can\u2019t do this. Let go of me. Hurry up and let go of me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved his hand. \u201cHurry up and take him away. This old man is quite terrifying.\u201d</p><br/><p>Without hesitation, Liu Xiao Tian signaled the police officers to take him away. Then, he looked at Lin Fan. \u201cMaster Lin, your fame must have become so great that people have started to target you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan sighed helplessly. \u201cThat\u2019s enough. I feel like my intelligence is being made fun of now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p></div>\n</div>"}

No hurry.\"</p><br/><p>He wasn't anxious at all. He didn't even care about Brother Long who was already downstairs. He just hadn't expected Brother Long to come for him.</p><br/><p>Had he not done any research on who he was? If Lin Fan were to deal a blow to them, it'd be unimaginable.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian smiled. \"You probably only need a few seconds for them.\"</p><br/><p>\"You must be kidding,\" Zhao Zhong Yang said in disbelief. If Master Lin said it, he might have believed it. However, he didn't believe in Fraud Tian.</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang was about to finish his meal and he was thinking of how to deal with the problem. Then, Lin Fan suddenly passed his phone to him. He switched on the camera and said, \"Go and record them and ask them what they want to do.\"</p><br/><p>Soon, Zhao Zhong Yang returned. \"I just asked them. Go down. They want to kill you.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan watched the content of the video. In the video, the people downstairs shouted, \"Come down now! We want to kill you.\"</p><br/><p>\"Are we really not going to call the police?\" Zhao Zhong Yang asked.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan raised his phone. \"Inspector Liu, please come to 'xx' district. There are people from the casino that are causing trouble.\"</p><br/><p>\"Alright, let's go down.\"</p><br/><p>When he was leaving his house, Lin Fan also brought down a pair of slippers from the shoe rack.</p><br/><p>Downstairs.</p><br/><p>\"Brother Long, how long are we going to stay here for?\"</p><br/><p>The weather was pretty hot. Brother Long thought about it for a moment. \"We'll leave in a while. Since we already know his address, we'll just send it to the group. This guy has been live streaming anti-gambling stuff. He must have offended a lot of people. Even if we don't do anything to him, there will definitely be people that want to kill him.\"</p><br/><p>The subordinates laughed, \"Brother Long, you're so wise.\"</p><br/><p>\"Hey, that stupid Master Lin is here.\"</p><br/><p>Brother Long immediately turned to look at Lin Fan after hearing that. Then, he smiled. \"Remember, don't beat him up. Just scare him. If he's behaving improperly, we'll just give him a few slaps.\"</p><br/><p>\"Understood.\"</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan came in front of Brother Long, Brother Long immediately raised his hand. He looked extremely fierce. \"You must be Master Lin, I, Brother Long\u2026\"</p><br/><p>*slap*</p><br/><p>\"Brother Long, right?\" Lin Fan immediately threw a slipper at Brother Long's face. Half of his face immediately became red and started to swell.</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang was stunned. He hadn't expected Master Lin to be so direct. That was insane.</p><br/><p>Brother Long was stunned too. He had been a thug for many years and it was the first time seeing someone like him. Suddenly, he was extremely infuriated. His eyes opened wider and he looked fearsome. Before he could say anything, the other side of his face got hit.</p><br/><p>\"You're trying to threaten me, right? I haven't seen people that are as stupid as you. You actually came to get caught.\"</p><br/><p>Brother Long stared unblinkingly at him. Everything had happened so unexpectedly. Then, he shouted, \"You\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"'You'? What 'you'?\" Lin Fan didn't even stop hitting Brother Long. He continued to strike his face repeatedly. Brother Long was dizzy from the hits and his face was bloody and swollen.</p><br/><p>*slam*</p><br/><p>Brother Long collapsed to the ground and he looked like he was in a daze.</p><br/><p>\"D*mn, he dared to hit Brother Long. Charge!\"</p><br/><p>The subordinates recovered from their shock and they couldn't tolerate watching Brother Long get hit. They immediately charged towards him.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian wanted to retaliate but was stopped by Lin Fan. Then, he used the slippers like they were the best weapon in the world and managed to hit them until they collapsed.</p><br/><p>\"Brother Long? All of you must be brainless. Please do a thorough check on me before threatening me. That way, you'd know if you brought sufficient people along and if it's safe to challenge me,\" Lin Fan said as he twitched his mouth.</p><br/><p>Then, the sirens of the police car could be heard.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan threw the slippers away in the dustbin near him. He wanted to hide the 'weapon' that he had used.</p><br/><p>Brother Long hadn't expected to be defeated as he thought that he had brought enough people. Then, he looked at Lin Fan and heard the police car sirens. He shouted, \"How could you hit us without any reason? I want to sue you. I'm going to call the police.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan glanced at him. \"Relax, the police is coming.\"</p><br/><p>Brother Long was completely shocked. He didn't know what had happened as it all happened too quickly. He didn't even have any time to think about it.</p><br/><p>\"Let me tell you. I know the law and it is illegal for you to beat me up without any reason. Don't think you'll be fine after hiding the 'weapon'. The police is here and they will look for evidence!\" Brother Long shouted as if he had forgotten what he had originally been there for.</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>A few police cars stopped.</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian was feeling helpless. He knew that something was wrong the moment he received a call from Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>In the past, there had been real problems with those few people Lin Fan had told him about. They were all con artists. Now, he had been trying to help people retrieve the money they lost while gambling.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, he knew about Lin Fan's broadcasting matters. He was curious as he didn't know how Master Lin managed to be so good at gambling tricks. He even became an anti-gambling broadcaster. That was such an unexpected and drastic change.</p><br/><p>Initially, he had gone against the human traffickers. Now, he was trying to discourage people from gambling. An average person wouldn't be able to do all of this.</p><br/><p>When he saw that the police was here, Brother Long immediately cried, \"Police officers, this man purposely hurt us. He threw the slippers that he used in the dustbin. I want to sue him.\"</p><br/><p>After all, Liu Xiao Tian was a policeman and he was good with his judgment. Those people wailing on the ground had tattoos all over their bodies and they all wore skinny jeans. They were dressed like typical thugs.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan immediately played the video on his phone. \"Let me clarify this. I did not start the fight. These people came to my house and threatened to kill me.\"</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian nodded. Then, he whispered, \"What is it this time?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied calmly, \"I told you about them. These people are responsible for the illegal casinos in Shanghai. Are you up for it?\"</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian was helpless. \"Of course. But they are generally located in isolated areas. Those areas aren't governed by us. Also, these people have their own spies to inform them of raids. It's difficult to tackle the problem.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan leaned on Liu Xiao Tian's shoulder. \"Let me tell you this. If you decide to take this up, it'll help you greatly. Don't blame me for not telling you this.\"</p><br/><p>It was pretty troublesome to handle cases that weren't in the governed districts. The processing of paperwork was difficult and it might offend people too. However, after hearing what Lin Fan said, Liu Xiao Tian nodded. \"Don't worry. Regardless of how unrelated the districts are, as long as it's illegal, I will not let anyone of them go.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled, \"This fella is pretty well connected. But thankfully, he isn't that smart. Interrogate him and lay a sudden trap. You'll benefit greatly from it.\"</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian smiled.</p><br/><p>Brother Long who had collapsed on the ground saw that the two men were whispering among themselves. Then, he thought that things didn't seem too good. These two people looked like they were close friends.</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian said, \"Master Lin, ever since knowing you, I've been handling cases after cases. I don't even have time to rest.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan patted Liu Xiao Tian on his shoulder. \"It's okay. If this can be resolved beautifully, please remember to award me with another Good Citizen Award.\"</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian chuckled, \"You actually dare to ask for that?\"</p><br/><p>\"Why wouldn't I dare to ask for it? I even dared to show my face during the award ceremony. What else would I be afraid of?\" Lin Fan replied.</p><br/><p>Then, Liu Xiao Tian waved his hand. \"Bring them back for interrogation.\"</p><br/><p>Brother Long rebutted, \"He hit me. The 'weapon' is in the dustbin. I want to sue him. This is a lawful society. You can't do this to me.\"</p><br/><p>He was there to teach him a simple lesson but even before he had done anything, he had already been defeated. What exactly had happened?</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \"Brother Long\".</p><br/><p>Brother Long, who was being carried away by the policemen, suddenly turned back.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan added, \"Please study more to educate yourself\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Brother Long and his subordinates were speechless. \"...\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

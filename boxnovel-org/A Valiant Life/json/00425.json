He said happily, \u201cDon\u2019t touch it. This artwork is my everything. If not for you, I wouldn\u2019t have shown it to anyone.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tao Shi Gang smiled. \u201cElder Yue is treating this artwork like an inherited treasure. If he had hidden it properly, perhaps you guys would never find out about this.\u201d</p><br/><p>The masters of the Chinese Arts Association saw that he had been smiling ever since he had come back from Shanghai. They thought that he was so happy because of the exhibition. However, they later found out that it was because he had obtained an exquisite artwork.</p><br/><p>They didn\u2019t believe it when they heard it. After all, they were all artists and an exquisite piece of art would have countless people fighting for it. Furthermore, it had to be extraordinary for it to be called an exquisite artwork. Therefore, they had to take a look at it if not they wouldn\u2019t be convinced of it.</p><br/><p>Then, Yue Qiu Ju Shi opened it up and everyone surrounded him.</p><br/><p>When they looked at it, all the artists from around the world stared intently. They were completely mesmerized by it.</p><br/><p>One of the artists that specialized in flora and fauna was completely stunned by it.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis drawing\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yue Qiu Ju Shi answered happily, \u201cHow is it? I bet there isn\u2019t another flora and fauna artwork that could match up to this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although it was a bold claim, everyone nodded their heads when they heard it.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is an artwork with deep meaning. It speaks to me on a spiritual level. We\u2019ve studied art for our whole lives because we wanted to reach this level. I never expected to be able to see a drawing like this in my life.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA professional artist\u2019s work can\u2019t even match up to this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho drew this? It\u2019s signed by \u2018Master Lin\u2019. Who is that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yue Qiu Ju Shi saw that his good friends were attracted by this artwork. He raised his head and asked, \u201cHow is this artwork?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful, I think it could be one of the best in the world.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Yue, stop it. Just tell us which grandmaster drew this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Yue, I believe we\u2019re extremely close. Just name a price and sell it to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yue Qiu Ju Shi covered the artwork with both of his hands. \u201cThat\u2019s not possible. This artwork is priceless. My future depends on this artwork. We all know the wonders of the ancient artworks but they\u2019ve never reached the peak. However, this artwork\u2019s value is higher than any other artwork. If we talk about quality, I think this \u2018Hundred birds looking up to the Phoenix\u2019 is better than any other artwork too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis artwork has everything. It\u2019s one of the best! If not, the best!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yue Qiu Ju Shi couldn\u2019t let go of this artwork. He looked at it every day and wanted to sleep on it to experience it fully.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Yue, was it drawn by someone in the association?\u201d One of the elderly men asked. He was extremely impressed by this artwork. It was just like what Elder Yue said, this artwork was priceless. The quality was superior too.</p><br/><p>None of them seemed to have heard of Master Lin before.</p><br/><p>Yue Qiu Ju Shi shook his head. \u201cNope, but if you see who he is, you\u2019d be shocked.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tao Shi Gang was already used to what Elder Yue was doing. He was just scrolling through his phone and reading the news. Suddenly, he gasped.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Yue, come over, quick!\u201d Tao Shi Gang gasped. \u201cMaster Lin is in Beijing but he\u2019s in the detainment center for hitting a Korean celebrity.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Yue Qiu Ju Shi was stunned. Then, he quickly took the phone and read the news. He couldn\u2019t believe it. He quickly kept the artwork and kept it in the safe carefully. \u201cElder Tao, let\u2019s go to the detainment center. We have to save Master Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>At the detainment center.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan\u2019s phone was going crazy.</p><br/><p>The person that was responsible for answering the phone calls sipped on a cup of tea to relieve himself. \u201cThese fans are too scary. Their calls have been coming one after another. They all requested for the man to be sentenced to life imprisonment.\u201d</p><br/><p>Another elderly worker said, \u201cThese children are hopeless. Sigh, it\u2019s a pity for our nation.\u201d</p><br/><p>The worker replied, \u201cIn the past, it was a cultural shock. Now, it\u2019s a celebrity invasion. These affect the children a lot. Some of the famous celebrities who aren\u2019t righteous are considered to be time bombs. However, the investors these days aren\u2019t bothered by this. They only want to earn profits.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have read about this Jin Xuan Ming before. He\u2019s an arrogant man. After becoming famous in China, he treats our nation\u2019s celebrities unfairly. It could be seen from variety shows. I wonder why these kids like him so much.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s simple. He looks handsome, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Lin Fan and Wang Ming Yang sat there and drank tea. The operations officer didn\u2019t make things difficult for Lin Fan. He just couldn\u2019t release him yet because the matter wasn\u2019t exactly a normal one. The victim was a Korean celebrity who was famous in China.</p><br/><p>If they let them off like that, it would definitely cause even more trouble.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s weird. Why hasn\u2019t Yun Gang bailed us out?\u201d Wang Ming Yang was a little doubtful.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you so anxious? Just wait for him,\u201d Lin Fan was in no hurry at all. It was as if he wasn\u2019t bothered by this matter.</p><br/><p>Then, outside the detainment center.</p><br/><p>Three cars were parked outside.</p><br/><p>The three groups of people stepped out of their cars and they didn\u2019t know who each other was.</p><br/><p>The police officer outside blocked them. \u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>One of them said, \u201cI am from the Martial Arts Association, the secretary of President Niu. I am here to look for your chief.\u201d</p><br/><p>The police officer was a little stunned when he heard that this person was from the Martial Arts Association. It sounded like a violent place to a normal person. However, he knew that these organizations represented the nation and the people inside held high statuses.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about you?\u201d The police officer looked in another direction.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re from the Chinese Medical Association, we\u2019re here to look for your chief.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re from the Chinese Arts Association, we\u2019re also here for your chief.\u201d</p><br/><p><em>clatter</em></p><br/><p>The police officer was stunned. What was going on? Why did people from three different associations suddenly appear at the detainment center? It was something that had never happened before.</p><br/><p>The chief of the detainment center was also extremely frustrated. Everyone online was focusing on them.</p><br/><p>If something were to happen, everyone would know about it.</p><br/><p>\u201cChief, people from the Martial Arts Association, Chinese Medicine Association and Chinese Arts Association are here to look for you,\u201d a low-ranking police officer said after entering. He was also extremely curious as to what was happening.</p><br/><p>These three associations were considered to be the better ones of the country. Some of the leaders in those organizations were reputable and influential figures. They had extensive and wide networks. All of them had grouped up at the detainment center together, which puzzled him.</p><br/><p>Chief Ding was a little curious. \u201cPlease come in.\u201d</p><br/><p>The three different groups of people opened the door and entered.</p><br/><p>The person from the Martial Arts Association said, \u201cChief Ding, I represent the highest authority of the association to bail the Vice-President of Shanghai\u2019s Martial Arts Association, Lin Fan.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Chinese Medical Association member said, \u201cWe are also here to bail Master Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Chinese Arts Association representative, Tao Shi Gang was stunned. Then, he looked at the two of them and nodded. \u201cThe Chinese Arts Association is also here to bail Master Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, the three groups of people said, \u201cCan you release him? Our association will be responsible for anything that happens.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Ding didn\u2019t say anything. He just looked at them in shock.</p><br/><p>What the hell is happening?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

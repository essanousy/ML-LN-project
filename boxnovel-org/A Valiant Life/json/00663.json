Are you going to let us wait outside?\u201d</p><br/><p>Although Lin Fan was angry, it wasn\u2019t really because of Elder Zheng and the others. Then, he said calmly, \u201cSince you\u2019re here, come in and have a seat.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zheng Zhong Shan looked at Yue Qiu Ju Shi and smiled. It was an improvement for them to be able to enter.</p><br/><p>In the room.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Lin, you should know that because of the incident yesterday, I was so angry that I almost hit someone. I called you and you didn\u2019t pick up. I thought something terrible happened. Therefore, I rushed over. On the plane, my persistent sickness came back. It was so d*mn painful. But when I thought that Brother Lin was still angry, my sickness was nothing,\u201d Zheng Zhong Shan said with exaggerated gestures and expressions.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, Yue Qiu Ju Shi and Tao Shi Gang were also cooperating with him. They also showed exaggerated gestures and expressions. They didn\u2019t care about anything else as they just wanted to see him.</p><br/><p>If Lin Fan had believed them, it\u2019d be a miracle.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha!\u201d Lin Fan laughed. \u201cElder Zheng, why can\u2019t I tell that you\u2019re sick? You look to be in the pink of health.\u201d</p><br/><p>He wasn\u2019t really angry with them. After all, they didn\u2019t know what happened and they reacted immediately after knowing the problem. It was sufficient to show how much they cared about him.</p><br/><p>Then, Zheng Zhong Shan suddenly recalled that Elder Lin had powerful medical skills. If not for that, his grandson wouldn\u2019t have recovered. He realized that his trick was going to fail. Then, he smiled, \u201cThat\u2026 Let\u2019s not talk about it first. Elder Lin, I\u2019m 100% against you leaving the organization.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yue Qiu Ju Shi added, \u201cElder Lin, you\u2019re too rash. When the incident happened, you should\u2019ve told us immediately. If we had known about it, we wouldn\u2019t have allowed it to happen.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tao Shi Gang nodded, \u201cYeah, yeah! Did you know that Elder Zheng actually gathered everyone for a meeting yesterday? He was furious during the meeting. It was scary.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, just tell me what is it. What exhibition did you guys talk about?\u201d Lin Fan asked.</p><br/><p>Zheng Zhong Shan waved his hand, \u201cInitially, that was the most important thing to talk to you about. However, it is nothing compared to your current situation. What would happen to us if you were to leave the organization? We\u2019re here to resolve that issue.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan took a glance at the three of them. \u201cDon\u2019t think I\u2019ll be moved by your words. I have already made up my mind about leaving the association. I have ripped the documents apart.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo what if you ripped them apart? Our association didn\u2019t agree to your withdrawal. We can just re-print the documents for you. Look, I brought them over. They\u2019re brand new and they\u2019ve been tessellated with gold,\u201d Zheng Zhong Shan said as he brought out a stack of brand new documents.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved his hands, \u201cI\u2019ve withdrawn and that\u2019s it. I won\u2019t return.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, we didn\u2019t agree to that. You\u2019re not leaving the association,\u201d Zheng Zhong Shan immediately replied and shook his head. It would be a joke for Elder Lin to withdraw from the association. The association would be a meaningless place.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, Elder Lin\u2019s artistic skills were second to none. They even wanted to request for an artwork from him when they felt that he was in a good mood.</p><br/><p>They kept the artworks that Elder Lin gave them in the past and treated them like their heirloom treasures. They were prepared to hand it to the next generation.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said firmly, \u201cI have made my mind. It\u2019s useless to say anything. I have withdrawn. Our relationship is still decent. Since you guys are here, tell me what\u2019s wrong then. I can satisfy you on the first day of leaving the association.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zheng Zhong Shan waved his hand and said seriously, \u201cWe don\u2019t have any problems. The reason why we\u2019re here is to resolve your withdrawal from the association.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the three of them and was almost moved by their words. However, if he didn\u2019t know the trick up their sleeves, he might have really been touched by their words.</p><br/><p>\u201cUncle Lin\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, Lil\u2019 Fatty came in.</p><br/><p>Zheng Zhong Shan was stunned, \u201cElder Lin, the meaningful artwork was drawn by this Lil\u2019 Fatty?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, I didn\u2019t expect people from the association to see its meaning. I thought nobody besides me would be able to see it,\u201d Lin Fan said it with a hidden meaning. He was still spiteful of what had happened yesterday.</p><br/><p>Elder Zheng and the others understood what he meant. They smiled, \u201cWho said so? All of us could tell. Lil\u2019 Fatty, you\u2019re good! Do you want to learn Chinese Arts with us?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lil\u2019 Fatty looked at the three of them and went to Lin Fan, \u201cNo, Uncle Lin can teach me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan patted Lil\u2019 Fatty\u2019s head gently, \u201cLil\u2019 Fatty, go out and play. I have something to discuss with them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Then, Lil\u2019 Fatty went out obediently.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cDon\u2019t even think about it. Who else besides me can teach Chinese arts the best? Furthermore, Lil\u2019 Fatty is extremely gifted. He will become the top Chinese artist in the world even before 30 years of age. All of you will regret this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Zheng was stunned, \u201cElder Lin, you\u2019re kidding, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled, \u201cIt\u2019s okay if you don\u2019t believe me. Do you know what\u2019s talent? Alright, I won\u2019t talk too much about it. What do you want from me? Just tell me now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zheng Zhong Shan realized that Lin Fan really didn\u2019t want to go back. He started to become anxious, \u201cElder Lin, don\u2019t be like that. We came here from so far away. Are you really not going to give us face?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the three of them and he was in a dilemma.</p><br/><p>It definitely wasn\u2019t about giving them face or not. It was because he said it very clearly on Weibo yesterday. If he were to go back on his words, it\u2019d be a joke. He didn\u2019t want to be involved in such a thing.</p><br/><p>Zheng Zhong Shan was a witty man. He knew what the problem was with Elder Lin. It wasn\u2019t because he was telepathic, he was just an old and experienced man and he was able to see through things easily.</p><br/><p>Then, before Lin Fan said anything else, Elder Zheng took out his phone.</p><br/><p>Official Weibo of Chinese Arts Association: As the President of the Chinese Arts Association, I am here in Shanghai to request for Master Lin to return to the Chinese Arts Association. As to his decision to leave the association yesterday, all members of the association were not agreeable to it. Hence, we have to get Master Lin to return to the Chinese Arts Association no matter what it takes\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Lin, is this good enough? If you don\u2019t agree to it, do you really want the three of us to die from anger?\u201d Zheng Zhong Shan showed Lin Fan the phone\u2019s content and asked.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was stunned. He didn\u2019t expect Elder Zheng to do that for him and he was moved by his actions. However, he didn\u2019t want to appear to be moved. He wanted to let them feel that it wasn\u2019t an easy task to convince him to return to the association.</p><br/><p>He hesitated for a moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cSigh, forget it. Since you guys acted this way, what else can I say? I will agree to it then. However, I will put it this way. There will not be another chance,\u201d Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>After hearing that, Elder Zheng and the others laughed. They immediately assured him, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. There won\u2019t be another occurrence. Since it\u2019s like that, we can discuss about something else.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, so the three of you really have something to discuss with me about,\u201d Lin Fan said helplessly.</p></div>\n</div>"}

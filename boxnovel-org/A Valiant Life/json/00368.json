We have come here with good intentions, to give them gifts, and all we have is just a small request. Is that too much to ask? It can't be that hard to just accommodate us for a bit.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the man in front of him and he was happy for a moment, replying, \"Aren't you that person who acted in the 'Seven Heaven Romantic Love'? What's your name again?\"</p><br/><p>\"Jin Yang.\"</p><br/><p>\"Oh.\" Lin Fan nodded and said, \"So you were the one who acted in that retarded Han dynasty film. I felt that all the retarded actors in it were very well suited for their roles.\"</p><br/><p>Jin Yang had been very happy at the start but after hearing that, his expression totally changed as he replied, \"What do you mean?\"</p><br/><p>\"How could you say something like that?\" a staff member at the side shouted.</p><br/><p>The young and pretty actress who was standing at the side said, \"Who are you to say such horrible things? Do you even know what you're saying?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan did not even look at them but just replied with one word, \"Leave!\"</p><br/><p>\"What did you say?\" Jin Yang was furious. He had risen up and become a superstar and he had never been in such a situation before. He had never met someone who was not welcoming to him and then here he was. His first time coming to the Nanshan Children's Welfare Institute and he was in this bad situation.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved them off, saying, \"Was I not clear just now when I asked you all to leave? Let me repeat it. Get lost.\"</p><br/><p>The few celebrities and their staff members were all thoroughly pissed off and they all pointed at Lin Fan and said, \"Who in the world are you? How can you be so rash with your words? Can you look carefully before you don't trust us? Also, please watch your language, do you know who you're talking to? A small amount of their power is enough to completely destroy you.\"</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian patted Lin Fan on the shoulder and said, \"Calm down.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled and said, \"How can something so small rattle me?\"</p><br/><p>Zhang Zhong Yan took out his phone and said, \"Let me take a picture of all your big mouths. Superstars, huh? If I post this online, it will definitely blow up.\"</p><br/><p>\"What are you doing? Give me your phone. You better delete that video.\"</p><br/><p>\"He just took a video of us.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shook his head and said, \"Today is a special day, I don't wish to have to deal with you b*stards. I still stand by what I said. Get lost.\"</p><br/><p>Jin Yang said, \"Don't try and run away. You better apologize to us right now. If not, this is not over.\"</p><br/><p>\"Come out, everyone,\" Lin Fan shouted backward.</p><br/><p>All the shop owners came out from their private vehicles and, from behind, walked towards Lin Fan and said, \"Little Boss, what happened?\"</p><br/><p>When Jin Yang saw all the people in front of him, he started to tremble inside but then, when he thought about his social status, he was not afraid anymore. He became even more thick-skinned and said, \"What are you trying to do?\"</p><br/><p>The director was at the Children's Welfare Institute and he did not wish to cause a ruckus. If they were not at a welfare institute, he would just chase these b*stards away. Moreover, Inspector Liu was here also, so they definitely could not beat them up.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan raised up two fingers and said, \"Right now, I'm giving you two options. You can either leave right now, or I'll get my people to strip you all of all your clothes and you guys can streak the town, whether you believe it or not.\"</p><br/><p>The female celebrities were all very scared and wanted to leave right now. They were all not fans of this kind of activity. However, Jin Yang felt like he was being threatened. He knew that he was a celebrity and he was so well known. Also, there were so many people around here. If he were to leave now, he'd lose face completely.</p><br/><p>\"Haha, let me tell you something. Firstly, I'm not leaving without an apology. Secondly, I don't believe you have the balls to do something like that. If you as much as touch me, I'll let you know what regret is,\" Jin Yang replied with aggression.</p><br/><p>The staff members at the side could not help sighing. Brother Jin had always possessed such vigor.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan immediately waved him off and said, \"The male will be stripped to his underwear. I'll leave the females alone. To have to come to the children's welfare institute to promote yourselves, you all must be very desperate already.\"</p><br/><p>Jin Yang scanned his surroundings and could not help letting out a sneer, \"Let's see who has the balls to take action first.\"</p><br/><p>Then, the shop owners went into action and surrounded Jin Yang without hesitation. They said to Lin Fan, \"Little boss, do we really strip him?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded and sad, \"Strip him\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Suddenly, all the people at the scene were completely stunned. They asked, \"What are you all doing?\"</p><br/><p>\"F*ck you, I'm a superstar, let go of me.\"</p><br/><p>\"Let go\u2026.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at Liu Xiao Tian and whispered, \"Inspector Liu, I don't think you should stay here. Wait for me inside.\"</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian helplessly smiled and then left the area. It was really like Master Lin had said. It was not suitable for him to be there, so he decided to stand aside.</p><br/><p>\"Ah!\"</p><br/><p>The ladies let out a scream of shock but just like Master Lin had ordered, none of the ladies were touched. However, Jin Yang was stripped completely, left only with his underwear.</p><br/><p>\"Hehe, there's nothing great about your body. There's so much fatty meat and your body looks chubby. Your clothes hide a lot of it.\" Lin Fan analyzed the stripped Jin Yang and he could not help laughing. Then, he said, \"My name is Lin Fan and my shop is along Cloud Street. If you're not happy, you can come and find me there.\"</p><br/><p>The surrounding townsfolk looked at what was going on and they were all stunned.</p><br/><p>\"Sh*t, that's Jin Yang.\"</p><br/><p>\"Jin Yang is my idol. Why has he been stripped completely? However, he did say on his Weibo that he has a 6 pack. It doesn't even look like it and he even has a beer belly.\"</p><br/><p>\"Sigh, that's really disappointing. He is my favorite star and seeing him naked, his body is not even equal to mine. I've hurt my eyes for nothing.\"</p><br/><p>The residents all took out their phones and started filming. Jin Yang snarled, \"Don't record this. Everyone, stop recording.\"</p><br/><p>He did not want to imagine further. This whole fiasco had been posted online already and he did not want to think about how big of an impact it would have.</p><br/><p>\"You\u2026you...\" Jin Yang pointed at Lin Fan furiously, wishing he could kill Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at him and said, \"What? You still don't want to leave? Then I'll strip you of your underwear too.\"</p><br/><p>Jin Yang looked at Lin Fan with fierce eyes and said, \"Okay, you win.\"</p><br/><p>Then, with the protection of his staff members, Jin Yang dejectedly left the scene.</p><br/><p>\"Cheh\u2026\" Lin Fan looked on with disdain. Then, Lin Fan smiled and said, \"Okay, let's get moving. This b*stard wasted so much of our time. It's definitely not worth it.\"</p><br/><p>\"Woo\u2026\" the shop owners let out a cheer and then started moving the things from the van.</p><br/><p>Then at this moment, a stream of vans came from the distance.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang stuck his head out from the van and said, \"We're here.\"</p><br/><p>Chairman Huang looked on dumbfounded and said, \"Master Lin, this is\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled and said, \"They are all kind-hearted people, here to give stuff to the Children's Welfare Institute.\"</p><br/><p>Vehicle after vehicle, it was really very chaotic. This kind of things was something only Lin Fan could do. This was probably something to do with a person's abilities but since he had the ability, no one could blame him.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang came down from the vehicle. He pointed at the vehicles behind and said, \"How is it? Isn't it spectacular?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed. \"Spectacular, really spectacular.\"</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang smiled and said, \"Just wait till we bring everything down, it'll look even more spectacular. There's even some more behind. Everyone really put in a great amount of effort this time. However, the thing most worth celebrating is that the file has already been registered by the authorities, so once we sign it, we can assume ownership of the place.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded and replied, \"Understood. I've prepared for it already.\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Each time something minor happened, it would always become something major. It made him really depressed.</p><br/><p>He just wanted a quiet and happy life. Why did he become so famous?</p><br/><p>Ding ding!</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang called again. He probably read the news. When Lin Fan picked up, Wang Ming Yang started shouting.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, bro, you\u2019re playing with higher stakes.\u201d Wang Ming Yang was speechless. He was in disbelief after reading the news on Weibo.</p><br/><p>She was so badly burned that nobody believed that she regained her looks in just one hour.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-2\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Even the ghosts wouldn\u2019t believe it.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the big deal? It\u2019s just a small problem. Why? Are you going to ask if it\u2019s true after reading the unbelievable news?\u201d Lin Fan smiled and asked.</p><br/><p>He knew how impactful the matter was. However, he wasn\u2019t afraid since he felt that he was really awesome and did something law-defying. It really was something to him.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang helplessly cursed, \u201cAren\u2019t you talking rubbish? If I were to believe it, I wouldn\u2019t have called you. What did you put in the medicinal pills? Quick, let\u2019s collaborate. I\u2019m going to be the richest man in the world.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can continue dreaming about becoming the richest man in the word. The medicinal pill is extremely difficult to craft. What do you think it is? Some sort of cabbage?\u201d Lin Fan didn\u2019t want to be involved in the interests of other things.</p><br/><p>Of course, it wasn\u2019t that he didn\u2019t believe in Wang Ming Yang. If he were to collaborate with Wang Ming Yang, other interests would definitely be involved.</p><br/><p>Although he wasn\u2019t afraid, he didn\u2019t want to be collecting Wang Ming Yang\u2019s corpse one day.</p><br/><p>If they really succeeded, who knew what horrible things might happen?</p><br/><p>In view of Wang Ming Yang\u2019s safety, he had to forget about it.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang said, \u201cBro, let me tell you the truth. You should go out for a holiday or something. I feel like you\u2019d become unstable later. This time, I\u2019m afraid a lot of people would come and look for you.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-3\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Lin Fan was stunned, \u201cDon\u2019t scare me, I hate it when people come to disturb me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, I\u2019m not scaring you. If you don\u2019t believe me, continue staying in the shop. You\u2019ll have a headache. I think you don\u2019t know the value of this medicinal pill,\u201d Wang Ming Yang said.</p><br/><p>This time, he started to consider going out for a holiday as it seemed like a good choice. He could stop making scallion pancakes every day and could see the beautiful sceneries.</p><br/><p>It was a decent suggestion.</p><br/><p>\u201cMing Yang, I think your suggestion is decent. I\u2019ll hang up now. I have to consider it.\u201d Lin Fan didn\u2019t want to talk anymore. He felt that Wang Ming Yang\u2019s suggestion was indeed a good one.</p><br/><p>He was getting a little emotional as he thought about it.</p><br/><p>When he hung up the phone, he realized that something was wrong.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian glared at him and it was really weird. It was as if he wanted to eat him up.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you looking at me?\u201d Lin Fan asked.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian replied, \u201cAre you going to leave again?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan immediately looked away and said calmly, \u201cI\u2019m thinking of it but I still have to consider other things.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian got emotional. He immediately pleaded, \u201cBro, I\u2019m begging you. Please don\u2019t leave suddenly again. You should know the current situation. There are really a lot of townsfolk trying to buy scallion pancakes. If you were to run away, I really can\u2019t handle it.\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-4\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I won\u2019t run away,\u201d Lin Fan immediately consoled him. He was afraid that Fraud Tian would end up doing something silly.</p><br/><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Fraud Tian trusted Lin Fan a lot and at the moment, it seemed like he couldn\u2019t trust him at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Lin Fan said firmly. He didn\u2019t want to continue talking about this with Fraud Tian. However, as he thought about it, he started to regret. Why did he even decide to sell scallion pancakes? Now that the shop is doing so well, it was difficult to handle the situation.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sigh, it was his biggest regret ever.</p><br/><p>He shouldn\u2019t have sold scallion pancakes.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian initially didn\u2019t want to believe Lin Fan. But as he saw Lin Fan\u2019s firm expressions, he started to believe him.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, I trust you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Lin Fan nodded. It looked like he still was a trustworthy man after all.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan had been scrolling through Weibo. She was really happy when she read the compliments that Brother Lin was getting. In her eyes, Brother Lin was the best.</p><br/><p>When the news broke out.</p><br/><p>A lot of investment firms in the country started to look at opportunities in Shanghai.</p><br/><p>They knew about Master Lin. After all, he was really popular on Weibo and everyone knew who he was. However, they only knew him as a celebrity. They felt that he wasn\u2019t worth being invested in.</p><br/><p>They didn\u2019t have to think about the scallion pancakes either.</p><br/><p>They studied the composition of the scallion pancakes and used a lot of high-tech analysis. However, they couldn\u2019t figure out what exactly made these scallion pancakes so delicious.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-5\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>In the end, they just gave up on it.</p><br/><p>If not, they would have started to mass produce these scallion pancakes.</p><br/><p>However, things were different now.</p><br/><p>A medicinal pill that could cure a severely burned patient and regain her looks. This interested them a lot.</p><br/><p>If they could collaborate with him and mass produce the medicinal pills, the amount of wealth they would get was unimaginable.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, if they could study the pills and improvise to make other pills, they could make another pot of gold.</p><br/><p>Therefore, a lot of investment firms and medical companies started to make their way to Shanghai.</p><br/><p>They wanted to discuss with Master Lin about the medicinal pills and start production.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang had foreseen it happening. It was impossible for him not to attract any attention. After those news reports, it was bound to create a huge uproar.</p><br/><p>Wu Yun Gang called from Beijing.</p><br/><p>\u201cMing Yang, are Master Lin\u2019s medicinal pills really so magical?\u201d Wu Yun Gang asked ecstatically.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know but the news articles have already reported it. I think it is really magical.\u201d He didn\u2019t know the actual situation but he was pretty confident of what he said.</p><br/><p>\u201cMing Yang, don\u2019t forget about me. You\u2019re so close to Master Lin. He\u2019ll definitely collaborate with you. Can I become a shareholder too?\u201d Wu Yun Gang knew it was impossible for him to directly collaborate with Master Lin. The close relationship between Wang Ming Yang and Master Lin meant that Wang Ming Yang would definitely get the opportunity instead.</p><br/><p>However, he would be happy with being a part of it.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang said helplessly, \u201cYou must be dreaming. I didn\u2019t even get it. When I read about it, I immediately called him. He said that the medicinal pills cannot be mass produced. Only he could craft them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2026\u201d Wu Yun Gang suddenly felt disinterested. He thought about it and realized that such a magical medicinal pill would probably be highly difficult to craft.</p><br/><p>In the end, he hung up.</p><br/><p>He felt like it was a wasted opportunity.</p></div>\n</div>"}

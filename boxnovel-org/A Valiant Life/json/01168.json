He wasn\u2019t affected by that incident at all.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian burped. \u201cYou haven\u2019t even resolved that matter yet.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, Lin Fan suddenly realized something. \u201cOh right. It\u2019s nighttime already. Have you guys eaten yet?\u201d</p><br/><p>The big men shook their heads. \u201cNope.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan sighed. \u201cTake a seat at a table. I\u2019ll treat you guys to a meal.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow can we accept that? There\u2019s no way we can let Master Lin treat us!\u201d The big men immediately shook their heads. If people were to find out that they let Master Lin pay for their meal, they would be mocked for sure.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan remained silent as he opened up the menu. Then, he showed them the price.</p><br/><p>The big men looked at the price and their eyes widened. It was too f*cking expensive. Even the sum of their net worths wouldn\u2019t be enough to afford a meal.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright. Sit over there. I\u2019ll order for you,\u201d said Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>At that moment, the big men didn\u2019t refuse. They were embarrassed as they just said, \u201cThank you, Master Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>To them, that price was simply too high. It was so expensive that it was scary. They felt helpless. This was the gap between the wealthy and the poor.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you guys have jobs now?\u201d asked Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>One of the big men replied, \u201cWe don\u2019t have proper jobs. We just keep looking for these temporary jobs.\u201d</p><br/><p>Since Lin Fan had come across these guys, he couldn\u2019t just let them be. Then, he turned to Xue Yao. \u201cXue Yao, do you still need more people at your casino? With their abilities, they would be good security guards.\u201d</p><br/><p>When the big men heard this, they were instantly moved. They hadn\u2019t expected that Master Lin was so influential even in Haojiang. They were honored.</p><br/><p>Yun Xue Yao nodded. \u201cYes, we do have available jobs.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even if there weren\u2019t available jobs, she would still have agreed. After all, Brother Lin had spoken. How could she reject?</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at those big men and said, \u201cTomorrow, you guys will report there. From now on, don\u2019t meddle blindly, and don\u2019t be other people\u2019s thugs anymore. That\u2019s very dangerous. If you beat someone to death or disable someone, you\u2019d be arrested.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood.\u201d</p><br/><p>The big men nodded. They had always wanted a proper job too. But because they had no academic history, they were helpless.</p><br/><p>Even if they found some jobs, those were all physical labor jobs. In the end, they had no choice but to go on this path.</p><br/><p>Very soon, their food arrived and they started gobbling up the food.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan\u2019s table was almost done. \u201cThen that\u2019s that. Let\u2019s head back. It\u2019s been a tiring day. It\u2019s time for a good rest.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYep, alright. I\u2019ll bring everyone back. Tomorrow, we\u2019ll go and visit other places,\u201d said Yun Xue Yao.</p><br/><p>Before leaving, Lin Fan told the big men to enjoy their food. He had already paid the bill.</p><br/><p>Nighttime. In the hotel.</p><br/><p>Yun Xue Yao didn\u2019t go home but stayed here instead. Fraud Tian and Zhao Zhong Yang shared a room.</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang kept pestering Fraud Tian in hopes of getting some money from him. However, Fraud Tian would never share his winnings with Zhao Zhong Yang. After all, this was his hard-earned money.</p><br/><p>Liu Xu and Wu You Lan shared a room.</p><br/><p>And Yun Xue Yao shared a room with Jin Meng.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you looking at?\u201d Yun Xue Yao saw Jin Meng holding her phone, so she asked curiously.</p><br/><p>Jin Meng didn\u2019t look up. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing. I\u2019m looking at a description of this Master Lin. Today was really eye-opening. I want to see just what this person has done in the past.</p><br/><p>D*mn. He\u2019s really amazing. I didn\u2019t think that he could be so amazing. Now I understand why those big men from today were so afraid of Master Lin. Who knew that Master Lin was publicly recognized as the best in the world at Kunlun Mountain? He\u2019s way too powerful.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jin Meng looked at the description on the Internet and was amazed. Some of these things seemed scary to her.</p><br/><p>In the end, Jin Meng was crying out.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis Master Lin\u2019s life is way too legendary. If I didn\u2019t see it for myself, I wouldn\u2019t believe it. Xue Yao, you have to seize this opportunity. If you can really get him, you would have hit the jackpot.</p><br/><p>But the weird thing is that someone like him actually just sells scallion pancakes for a living. That\u2019s really strange. And he even manages a welfare institute. That\u2019s a really huge burden to bear.</p><br/><p>But you can tell from this that Master Lin is really a kind person.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Yun Xue Yao heard Jin Meng\u2019s ramblings, she started grinning.</p><br/><p>She had always paid attention to Brother Lin, and she knew about everything he had done.</p><br/><p>Thinking about it now, Brother Lin was really mystical.</p><br/><p>The next day!</p><br/><p>On the Internet, something had happened. This incident had something to do with Lin Fan, but Lin Fan wasn\u2019t the focus of it.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe fashionable old man at the airport.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis fashionable old man is unlike any other. He took down a criminal with a few strikes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFashion doesn\u2019t discriminate against age.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c666\u2026 This old man is crazy. Did you guys see the video? Even I\u2019m no match for him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s really dressed boldly. His style is too intense. Look at that old man\u2019s photo. With those spectacles, he has an exceptional aura about him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI saw that scene of him taking down the criminal. It was really domineering. It\u2019s clear that he\u2019s an expert. He\u2019s an expert amongst experts.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut this old man\u2019s luggage bag looks too old and tattered. It affects his stylish image.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c^What do you know? That\u2019s a rugged style. That\u2019s fashion, don\u2019t you understand? It doesn\u2019t affect his image at all.\u201d</p><br/><p>The netizens discussed intensely. They were very excited about this piece of news.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy does this old man look so familiar. I feel like I\u2019ve seen him somewhere before.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI feel that way too. D*mn. I remember now. Isn\u2019t this Cloud Street\u2019s Fraud Tian? F*ck. His appearance has changed way too drastically. What kind of person influenced him to make such a huge change?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that for real? Fraud Tian?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c^Is that true? I work in a clothing company and our company recently released a bunch of old-fashioned clothes. I want to get this man to be our model.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn. That is Fraud Tian. It definitely is. I didn\u2019t think that he would dress up like this. He has such an aura now that he usually doesn\u2019t have.\u201d</p><br/><p>Haojiang. At the breakfast place.</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang was playing with his phone when suddenly, he cried out.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck. Fraud, you\u2019ve f*cking gone famous!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Fraud Tian, who was having his breakfast, was confused. He had no idea what Zhao Zhong Yang was talking about.</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang was dumbfounded. He felt that Fraud Tian\u2019s clothes were disturbing, but those people on the Internet were saying that he looked stylish. Had they gone blind?</p><br/><p>Lin Fan and Wu You Lan\u2019s attentions were drawn in as well. They quickly took out their phones.</p><br/><p>When they saw the news, even they were dumbfounded as well.</p><br/><p>The society\u2019s standard of beauty had changed drastically.</p></div>\n</div>"}

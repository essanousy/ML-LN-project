After all, it was not as if he saved the entire world.</p><br/><p>Secretary Chen and Lin Fan were talking, and they were stunned after seeing the people in there. Although he knew that there would at least be an influential leader, he did not expect all of them to be powerful individuals.</p><br/><p>Although it was supposed to be a grand award ceremony for Master Lin, it seemed a little too much.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease excuse me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, someone shouted from behind.</p><br/><p>Secretary Chen was stunned after looking at who it was. \u201cElder Zheng\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Zheng Zhong Shan was a retired elder, and he was also there. It seemed like this was not an ordinary matter.</p><br/><p>However, he understood that Master Lin was the best in Chinese Arts. Also, he was a member of the Chinese Arts Society. He would obviously have a good relationship with these people.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Lin, you\u2019re disappointing. You came to Beijing to receive an award without calling me,\u201d Zheng Zhong Shan said.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Zheng, it\u2019s not anything important, I didn\u2019t see the need to trouble you.\u201d He did not expect Elder Zheng to be there. It was a pretty awkward situation.</p><br/><p>\u201cTrouble?\u201d Elder Zheng glared at him. \u201cHow is it troublesome? I\u2019m based in Beijing. How can you say that it\u2019s troublesome for me? It seems like you don\u2019t respect me. No, you have to come to my place to have a drink and draw after the award ceremony. How about that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan finally understood what he was trying to say after hearing that.</p><br/><p>\u201cSure, I haven\u2019t been there in a long time,\u201d Lin Fan chuckled.</p><br/><p>Secretary Chen was stunned after hearing the conversation between Master Lin and Elder Zheng. It seemed like he had underestimated Master Lin.</p><br/><p>However, even if he did not recognise how powerful Master Lin was, he was indeed an extraordinary man. He just did not expect Master Lin to have such a good relationship with Elder Zheng.</p><br/><p>However, Zhao Zhong Yang and the others did not go near him. After all, the elders there came from distant places and they were afraid of offending them.</p><br/><p>He took out his phone and pointed it at a distance away.</p><br/><p>\u201cBros, look! Our Master Lin is speaking with the elders, but we\u2019re a bit too far away. We can\u2019t see them very clearly from here.\u201d</p><br/><p>The netizens tried to look at their screens closely, but they could not see them clearly.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, Brother Yang, why can\u2019t you go nearer? It\u2019s so difficult to see him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, my eyes kinda hurt from that. Go nearer!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care anymore. I\u2019m going to start donating again.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. Let\u2019s do that.\u201d</p><br/><p>The netizens were ecstatic to see the broadcast even though they could not really see Master Lin clearly.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang sat there feeling proud and happy. After all, those people in the distance were his close friends.</p><br/><p>\u201cMing Yang, can you see who is that?\u201d Father Lin asked, pointing to a man far away.</p><br/><p>\u201cUncle, let me have a look.\u201d Wang Ming Yang tried to look closely at the person, but he could not figure out who it was.</p><br/><p>He looked at the person who looked familiar to him. However, he was still unsure of who it was.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang shook his head. \u201cHe\u2019s too far away, I can\u2019t tell.\u201d</p><br/><p>Father Lin replied, \u201cIt\u2019s okay. I didn\u2019t expect to be able to sit here. I feel great.\u201d</p><br/><p>Father Lin was ecstatic when he had found out that he was going. He felt that it was something unbelievable, something that nobody would have ever thought of.</p><br/><p>He did not expect himself to be there because of his son\u2019s achievements. Although it was not because of his own achievement, he felt proud having a son like Master Lin.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan\u2019s mum looked at her husband\u2019s expression and smiled too.</p><br/><p>The reporters were already at the venue, and they had started to broadcast the scenes.</p><br/><p>Those Beijing reporters knew who the elders were and they were nervous of filming them.</p><br/><p>These were people that they probably would not get to see unless they were at a national meeting.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was surrounded by quite a few elders, but he was unfazed as he continued smiling and laughing.</p><br/><p>Those elders were very polite towards Lin Fan as they knew that Master Lin was not an ordinary man.</p><br/><p>His specialties and achievements were too many to count and it was pretty astonishing.</p><br/><p>His Chinese Arts skills helped to push the nation\u2019s Chinese Arts to another level. Even renowned artists from overseas visited to admire his works.</p><br/><p>Also, some museums in other countries had been trying to contact them to see if they could borrow Master Lin\u2019s works to set up an exhibition. However, they hadn\u2019t yet replied to the museums.</p><br/><p>At the same time, his medical knowledge was second to none. Master Lin was the nation\u2019s first person to obtain a Nobel prize for his medical works.</p><br/><p>He cured anorexia, leukemia, and AIDS. Those were major illnesses. He was famous all around the world.</p><br/><p>Everyone knew that China eradicated a lot of illnesses recently.</p><br/><p>Some countries already sent representatives over to speak about collaborating with China for their expertise in Chinese medicine. It helped Chinese medicine to be more recognised overseas.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, the impact of the perfect artificial limbs was also unbelievable. It was on par with the eradication of AIDS.</p><br/><p>It could be said that Master Lin\u2019s work managed to impact the entire world.</p><br/><p>Time passed quickly.</p><br/><p>Secretary Chen reminded him, \u201cMaster Lin, the ceremony is going to start soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>People started to return to their seats.</p><br/><p>Some of the reporters at the front became very nervous. After all, all their subjects were influential figures this time. Their hands were trembling as they were holding the cameras.</p><br/><p>The broadcast was also started.</p><br/><p>A lot of netizens were camping online as they waited for the start of the live stream. When they saw that it was finally out, they started to discuss about it enthusiastically.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s starting, it\u2019s starting!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough it\u2019s not me receiving the award, I feel so nervous watching this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI am one of Master Lin\u2019s oldest fans. I have been following his Weibo closely, and I dare to claim that I have witnessed everything that Master Lin has done.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c^ Bro you\u2019re awesome.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, of course! Who else can be as awesome as me? Let\u2019s just focus on the broadcast.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Nobody could guarantee that nothing would go wrong.</p><br/><p>However, they were finally relieved after hearing about the success of his research.</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung chap, you\u2019re amazing!\u201d Fraud Tian shouted. He really had not seen anyone as awesome as him.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. \u201cOf course, I mean it when I say I\u2019m awesome.\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Chen added, \u201cLittle Boss, you made all of us worried. Thankfully, it\u2019s all over.\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Liang, Sister Hong, and the others from Cloud Street were all there. They were very proud of Little Boss\u2019s work. They felt that it was a miracle.</p><br/><p>If not for Master Lin, they would not have imagined anyone eradicating a terminal illness like this.</p><br/><p>\u201cMing Qing, are you tired?\u201d Lin Fan asked.</p><br/><p>He felt that his disciple worked really hard this time.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing replied ecstatically, \u201cNope, I\u2019m really excited.\u201d</p><br/><p>He was really excited to be able to witness his mentor eradicating a terminal illness like this. It was a sense of achievement that could not be described.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cI think I\u2019ll go back to rest. I\u2019m exhausted.\u201d</p><br/><p>The research was extremely draining for both of them.</p><br/><p>The reporters immediately added, \u201cYeah, Master Lin, both of you should go back to rest. We can conduct our interview on another occasion.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, yeah. It\u2019s a major event! We\u2019re not going to force you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnyway, Master Lin will be at Cloud Street which isn\u2019t that far away. We can go there tomorrow to interview him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Besides the reporters, the shop owners from Cloud Street also agreed.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled, \u201cI\u2019ll go take a good shower and change up. We can talk again tomorrow.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, the crowd parted to make way for Lin Fan as if they were seeing a hero off.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yi Jun held onto his daughter\u2019s hand, and he had never been this happy before. He was finally free, and it felt as if his life had changed overnight.</p><br/><p>He was ecstatic about everything that just happened.</p><br/><p>He did not know how to express his gratitude. He felt that even kowtowing to Master Lin or becoming his servant was not enough to show how grateful he was for him.</p><br/><p>When Zhang Yi Jun saw Master Lin and Zhao Ming Qing gradually walk away, tears started to well up in his eyes.</p><br/><p>The reporters felt that it was something worthy of celebrating, as it was simply too crazy.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan and Zhao Ming Qing left the place.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yi Jun became the next target for the reporters. They felt that there was probably a lot of things that he wanted to talk about.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yi Jun immediately poured out his excitement when he was being interviewed by the reporters.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Lin Fan and his disciple drove off.</p><br/><p>\u201cPhew, it\u2019s finally over. I\u2019m so exhausted that I don\u2019t want to say anything,\u201d Lin Fan chuckled.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing replied, \u201cTeacher, I wasn\u2019t very confident at the start. Looking back now, I think I worried too much.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. \u201cOf course. Don\u2019t overthink it.\u201d</p><br/><p>He knew that Zhao Ming Qing was not confident about this matter, but he believed in himself. Zhao Ming Qing never thought that they would be tasting success as it seemed impossible.</p><br/><p>Zhao Shi had been waiting at the entrance for Zhao Ming Qing. When she saw him arriving in Lin Fan\u2019s car, she immediately rushed towards him and held his hand as they walked into the house.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled as he watched them walk into their house.</p><br/><p>Then, he thought of the request of the Encyclopedia that he needed to fulfill in order to unlock a new knowledge classification.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so frustrating. Could it be that I\u2019m so old that I have to plan for the future?\u201d</p><br/><p>He felt that he was still very young and that he did not need to rush his relationships.</p><br/><p>However, he found it funny that even the Encyclopedia was anxious about his future.</p><br/><p>Then, he drove home and took a shower. He finally felt much better. He laid down on his sofa and switched on the television before falling asleep shortly afterwards.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, the reporters were rushing to finish their drafts when they arrived back at their office.</p><br/><p>They wanted to make sure everything was perfect this time.</p><br/><p>After all, Master Lin did a fantastic job, and they could not afford to let Master Lin down.</p><br/><p>The relevant departments conducted urgent meetings.</p><br/><p>A group of elders in the meeting room were discussing about how Lin Fan eradicated AIDS. Since the medicinal recipe was posted, they felt that there was no need to oversee anything.</p><br/><p>Every townsfolk could prepare the medicine themselves if they followed the list that was posted.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin did so well this time. He solved such a huge problem. I have a few villages in my country that have a lot of people suffering from AIDS due to various blood transfusion problems. Now that Master Lin eradicated it, those villagers can finally be cured,\u201d a leader exclaimed.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, we\u2019re getting people to test out Master Lin\u2019s medicine. If there\u2019s no problem, we will buy the required amount and send it to the villages.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cActually, there\u2019s no need to test it. I believe in Master Lin a lot even if he does not really give a d*mn about others. It\u2019s normal for capable people like him to have some issues with their tempers.\u201d</p><br/><p>When he said that, everyone laughed helplessly. It was not because Master Lin had a poor attitude. It was because they had had a minor conflict with Master Lin before and they remembered him for it.</p><br/><p>After all, people knew that Master Lin had a great relationship with them.</p><br/><p>Hence, there was no need to explain anything despite the conflict that had taken place.</p><br/><p>They did not send anyone over when they found out that Master Lin was going to eradicate AIDS. They just worked behind the scenes.</p><br/><p>It was awesome that he had managed to succeed. If not, that would not have mattered either.</p><br/><p>Now that he had succeeded, everyone was in high spirits as they cheered Master Lin on.</p><br/><p>The post containing the medicinal recipe probably saved countless people, and it was not a small feat after all.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough we believe in Master Lin, we\u2019re ultimately a government organisation. We have to base our words on evidence. We have to go by the books.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, the impact of this matter is huge. Although we don\u2019t really know everything now, I have received messages from other countries about this matter.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

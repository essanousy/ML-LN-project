The incident involving Tianshu Milk would be taken care of by the national departments and they would also handle the outcome of this matter.</p><br/><p>However, Lin Fan could tell that Tianshu Milk would definitely lose their skin even if they didn\u2019t die. After all, it was a large enterprise with deep roots in the country. It had a big place in the citizens\u2019 hearts. Now that this had suddenly happened, it definitely caused a big impact.</p><br/><p><em>Local milk producers, this master can only help you this much. The rest will be up to you.</em></p><br/><p>Those local milk companies wanted him to taste their products. No one could force him to do it if he didn\u2019t want to but he decided to just do his part for the local produce.</p><br/><p>However, he hadn\u2019t expected to end up almost puking. He really felt like puking. If he hadn\u2019t steadied himself, he would have spewed out all the milk.</p><br/><p>When Wang Mei Tian saw the situation, she was completely stunned. Her first thought was that her position as the brand ambassador was probably useless now.</p><br/><p>Now that this had happened to Tianshu Milk Company, how could they still bother about her?</p><br/><p>When she called Chief Chen, Wang Mei Tian was dumbfounded. Chief Chen\u2019s tone sounded helpless. It was as if he felt that this situation could no longer be saved and he just told her to record her album properly.</p><br/><p>At the same time, she could hear a hidden meaning that Chief Chen no longer had hope in her battle against Wu Huan Yue.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. How can I, Wang Mei Tian, lose to Wu Huan Yue?\u201d A flame lit up in Wang Mei Tian\u2019s heart. Then, she started posting comments on Weibo. However, these comments were met with merciless attacks.</p><br/><p>Wang Mei Tian: \u201cThe album is in the process of recording. Everyone, please support me. I love you all very much.\u201d</p><br/><p>Instantly, netizens commented below.</p><br/><p>\u201cStop that. We won\u2019t support you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou tried to harm the little children from the mountainous areas. You\u2019re worse than a monster.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you think that you could compare to Master Lin\u2019s personally composed songs? And Wu Huan Yue\u2019s voice has always been great. Needless to say, she\u2019ll completely crush you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Mei Tian saw these comments and nearly puked out blood. But when she continued looking at the comment below, she couldn\u2019t help but start smiling. There were still people supporting her. But then, when she saw the next line, she could no longer hold her temper.</p><br/><p>\u201c^You bunch of scum. Mei Tian is such a good girl. How can you say that? Don\u2019t worry, Mei Tian, I won\u2019t just support your album, I will give you my full support. You\u2019re such an excellent singer and an excellent lady. How could we not support you? Don\u2019t worry. When the songs come out, I\u2019ll download the pirated version immediately. As for that Wu Huan Yue, I\u2019ll purchase the official version. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll definitely support you.\u201d</p><br/><p>*Spit!*</p><br/><p>Wang Mei Tian was furious. She even had an urge to smash her phone into pieces. She clenched onto her phone with both hands as her eyes gleamed with fury.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, Wu Huan Yue, we\u2019re not finished.\u201d</p><br/><p>But these words just came from the contempt in her heart. As for making those two pay, she could dream on. It was basically impossible.</p><br/><p>Of course, Lin Fan didn\u2019t bother about this kind of matter at all. Although he felt that he didn\u2019t have many enemies since he was so friendly, if he were to count them, he would realize that he had an exceptionally large number of enemies. It was such a large number that it was scary.</p><br/><p>Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan received a call. It was from President Niu of the Shanghai Martial Arts Association, Elder Niu.</p><br/><p>\u201cPresident Lin, have you been good lately?\u201d President Niu\u2019s voice came from the phone.</p><br/><p>Hearing that voice, Lin Fan felt a little embarrassed. Since becoming the Vice-President of the Shanghai Martial Arts Association, it seemed as if he hadn\u2019t gone there at all. He had just taken the title as well as the salary.</p><br/><p>Moreover, he had even received something from them during the new year.</p><br/><p><em>Sigh. </em>Thinking about this, this dashing young face became even more embarrassed.</p><br/><p>\u201cPresident Niu, I\u2019m fine. Why did you decide to call me?\u201d Lin Fan laughed embarrassedly. It had really been wrong of him. He should have found some time to visit the association.</p><br/><p>President Niu smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing much. It\u2019s just that there will be a martial arts exchange meet at the Kunlun Mountain range the day after tomorrow. There will be people coming from all over. Our Shanghai Martial Arts Association will be sending people over as well. However, I\u2019m old and I can\u2019t move about anymore. That\u2019s why I hope that President Lin can lead a team of youngsters to go and gain some experience.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan heard this, he pondered for a moment. He didn\u2019t really want travel but since President Niu had personally called and he didn\u2019t really have much to do, it wouldn\u2019t be nice to reject.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright. As a member of the association, naturally, I have to contribute. But will I have to go on stage?\u201d asked Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>President Niu: \u201cThere\u2019s no need. We are just guests going for a visit. There\u2019ll be no need to go on stage.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded. It was good that he wouldn\u2019t have to go on stage. After all, if he goes on stage, he would be bullying others. It wouldn\u2019t be nice.</p><br/><p>However, he was grumbling in his heart. Which fella organized this? Couldn\u2019t he have picked a place besides Kunlun Mountain? <em>F*ck, that\u2019s far. And it\u2019s cold too. I\u2019m going to be suffering.</em></p><br/><p>\u201cPresident Niu, don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll take this on. I\u2019ll bring the youngsters out to see the world. No problem at all,\u201d said Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>President Niu: \u201cAlright then. I\u2019ll have to trouble President Lin with this then. But please do come back for a visit when you\u2019re free. Everyone misses you, especially Chairman Wang, Wang Yun Jie. He really misses you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWang Yun Jie? Who is that?\u201d Lin Fan was taken aback. He didn\u2019t remember such a person.</p><br/><p>President Niu laughed. \u201cHe\u2019s the one who had a conflict with you and got beaten up by you in the past. Chairman of the Yang Tai Chi committee, Wang Yun Jie.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, him\u2026\u201d Lin Fan recalled now. <em>He\u2019s the guy who bullied the kids I was teaching back then.</em></p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s still in the association?\u201d</p><br/><p>President Niu said with a smile, \u201cHe just came back a while ago. After being suspended and enduring some hardship, he has deeply recognized his mistakes. Initially, he wanted to look for you at Cloud Street but he was afraid because he has been beaten up by you once. I just hope that he will be able to give you a sincere apology.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s fine, it\u2019s fine. It\u2019s better to squash enmity than to keep it alive. The matter has already passed. If he has really changed, I forgive him. After all, I\u2019m not a petty person, am I?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight. How could President Lin be a petty person?\u201d said President Niu.</p><br/><p>Then, the two chatted for a while more before hanging up. As for this Kunlun trip, he would treat it like sightseeing.</p><br/><p>Over at the association.</p><br/><p>President Niu looked at Wang Yun Jie, who was next to him. \u201cHeard that? Master Lin isn\u2019t holding a grudge.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Yun Jie heaved a sigh of relief. \u201cThank you, President Niu. I\u2019ve already recognized my mistake and turned over a new leaf.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good. Martial arts practitioners can have explosive tempers but you have to have guts as well,\u201d President Niu preached.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, yes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p></div>\n</div>"}

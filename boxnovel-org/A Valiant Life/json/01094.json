Then, after putting down the phone, he came up to Lin Fan and said, \u201cPresident Lin, there will be people who will come over to pick us up.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Lin Fan nodded and said. Although this village was not very big in size, right now, it was flooded with people. Furthermore, there were quite a few tourist buses parked over there, clearly showing that a lot of people had arrived already.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat time will the exchange begin?\u201d Lin Fan asked.</p><br/><p>Jiang Fei replied, \u201cIt begins in the afternoon and will end tomorrow afternoon.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan came up close to Lin Fan and said, \u201cBrother Lin, do you not feel cold?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNope,\u201d Lin Fan smiled and said. What a joke. For him to be in a situation where he felt cold, it would be like seeing a ghost.</p><br/><p>However, this was the Kunlun mountain range, a place that he had never been to before. Written accounts had said that this was China\u2019s first sacred mountain, having a lot of folklore surrounding it. Also, every year, many people would come over here to see it. However, there were also a lot of people dying here as well. Legend has it that the mountain range was the entrance to hell.</p><br/><p>Whether or not these were true or not, he would never know. In any case, right now, they had science to explain all these deaths and show that they were all due to the natural elements.</p><br/><p>At that moment, a middle-aged man came over to them.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou guys must be the Shanghai Martial Arts Association, am I right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Fei immediately stepped up and said, \u201cYes, yes. You must be Mister Chen, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Jun smiled and nodded before saying, \u201cAll of you guys, come with me. All your lodging preparations have been done already. I\u2019m very sorry for making you guys wait. I was already waiting for you guys here just no but something came up and I had to attend to it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s alright,\u201d Jiang Fei smiled and said. Then, he signaled to the members who were behind to follow them.</p><br/><p>The whole group of them got on the road and started walking ahead.</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang was still holding his phone and continuing his live broadcast. He said, \u201cMy brothers, we have arrived already. This is probably very hard to believe if you guys do not see it for yourselves but there are really a lot of people here.\u201d</p><br/><p>His loyal fans of the live broadcast were very shocked when they saw the surrounding situation. It was as if a whole new world had been revealed to them.</p><br/><p>*Thud*</p><br/><p>That moment, Zhao Zhong Yang bumped into someone on the road. However, he did not seem to care much about it.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t move,\u201d the man who Zhao Zhong Yang had bumped into shouted. His eyes had a hint of ferocity as he said, \u201cYou bumped into me just now and yet you did not even bother to apologize? Looks like I\u2019ll have to teach you a lesson.\u201d</p><br/><p>Immediately after saying that, he launched his clenched fist towards Zhao Zhong Yang.</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang was stunned seeing that clenched fist coming towards him. He had not thought that this man would just resort to punching him without even talking things out. It was really scary for him.</p><br/><p>*Thump*</p><br/><p>Lin Fan stepped forward and grabbed the clenched fist. He said calmly, \u201cThat\u2019s a little rash, isn\u2019t it? Wanting to hit someone just because he bumped into you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet go,\u201d the rude man said as he started to struggle. However, it seemed like his fist had been completely wedged into something. He could not move at all regardless of how hard he tried.</p><br/><p>Chen Jun saw this situation and was shocked. He immediately rushed to them and said, \u201cOh man, don\u2019t do anything rash. Don\u2019t be rash, everybody.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, he looked towards Lin Fan and anxiously said, \u201cLet go. This is all just a misunderstanding.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan loosened his grip on the man\u2019s fist. The man took a look at his fist and realized that it was throbbing red. When he saw that, he glared at Lin Fan. Then, he sneered at them and left the area.</p><br/><p>Chen Jun shook his head and said, \u201cSigh, why did you get into a conflict with him? He is one of the descendants of the fierce Tiger Fists. It is part of Chaquan, the eighth style of Chinese boxing. It is truly something that is very amazing. Luckily for you, the conflict did not escalate. Otherwise, the consequences would really not be good.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMister Jiang, you need to take care of your people. The people here are really not to be messed with. If you get into any sort of conflict with them, you don\u2019t even want to think about what would happen,\u201d Chen Jun said.</p><br/><p>Jiang Fei laughed and then said, \u201cThis is our President Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Jun heard that and his expression completely changed. Then, there was a clear look of awkwardness as he said, \u201cSo this is President Lin. I\u2019m sorry, forgive my impoliteness.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved him off and said, \u201cAre the people here really that violent?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, the people here are even more violent than you can imagine. Let\u2019s not talk about this anymore, we should quickly head to your accommodation and get you guys settled down before we go for breakfast. Also, if you want to go and take a look at the Kunlun mountain range, I can bring you guys around,\u201d Chen Jun said. It was very clear that he did not want to continue talking about that topic anymore.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan did not say much either. He could not help but shake his head after seeing the descendant of the Tiger Fists. For someone like him to be so violent and yet still be able to survive in such a place was definitely not easy.</p><br/><p>Perhaps he had such a high level of skill that no one dared to mess with him.</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang was clearly shocked by the situation that had just occurred. After all, he had just been happily doing his live broadcast when that happened because he had bumped into someone. That was something that did not make sense to him at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Lin, that was really scary,\u201d Zhao Zhong Yang said.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled and said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. Stay close to Fraud Tian, I promise you that no one will harm you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHim?\u201d Zhao Zhong Yang said as he looked over at Fraud Tian, whose face was filled with confidence. It was very evident that Zhao Zhong Yang was in disbelief.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d Fraud Tian said. When he saw Zhao Zhong Yang\u2019s expression, he was a little p*ssed off as he said, \u201cAre you looking down on me? I, Tian, am an expert of Ba Gua Zhang. If that b*stard is able to survive three strikes from me, it\u2019d be like a loss to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Jun heard what he said and could not help but shake his head. He felt like these people were really very arrogant. Just now, the person that they had had a conflict with was a descendant of the Tiger Fists. He was very strong and it was definitely not a joking matter.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan looked at the people around them and was evidently a little scared. She grabbed on tight to Lin Fan\u2019s arm and kept herself close to him. She felt that if something were to happen, at least she would have Brother Lin to protect her.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d LIn Fan said. He felt that this whole place was really very interesting as it was filled with good folks mixed in with bad people.</p><br/><p>It was a really grand occasion filled with all sorts of different people from around the world.</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior, why is your face so red? What happened?\u201d a young man asked him.</p><br/><p>\u201cNothing much. There was this blind man on the road just now,\u201d the rough and violent man, who had a furious expression on his face, said. Then after that, he waved his hand and said, \u201cForget it. Come. Let\u2019s go and pay our elders a visit. This time, we, the Tiger Fists, have to put on a grand show.\u201d</p><br/><p>To all the people who had come down to the exchange, their purposes for coming were pretty clear. If they were not here to make friends within the martial arts scene, they were here to show off how great their martial art was.</p><br/><p>Also, to many of them, the current generation did not know pain and was not competitive at all. They were all just concerned with making friends within the martial arts scene and expanding their connections.</p><br/><p>Contrary to Lin Fan\u2019s thoughts, the accommodation was actually not bad. Initially, he had thought that the accommodation would be very run down. However, when he got there, he realized that he had been thinking too much.</p><br/><p>In the afternoon, the exchange started.</p><br/><p>However, it was nothing spectacular at all. It was just the three or four influential families as well as a countless number of the inheritors from various classifications of martial arts going on stage to talk.</p><br/><p>Also, the aim of the exchange this time was very clear.</p><br/><p>It was to promote martial arts and its virtues as well as to enhance the friendships within the community, regardless of whichever country they came from.</p><br/><p>After all, this was not simply an exchange for Chinese people. There were martial art experts from all over the world coming down to this event. This exchange was only possible due to the abilities of all the youngsters in the community.</p><br/><p>Naturally, this event attracted the attention of a lot of people.</p></div>\n</div>"}

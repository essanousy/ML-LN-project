When he saw the crowd\u2019s serious faces, he smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, nothing\u2019s wrong. Do you think I\u2019d be angry over that?\u201d Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>However, this really made him a little angry as it involved his friend. How could his friend be so easily bullied?</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang smiled, \u201cWhy did you look so stern just now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cWhat else can I do? Anyway, he really bullied my friend. I couldn\u2019t have possibly smiled at him, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>The others shook their heads and looked at Chen Chang Sheng. \u201cElder Chen, you have to be careful. We don\u2019t care who your friend offends in the future. However, he can\u2019t offend Master Lin\u2019s friend. You have to tell him that when you return back.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Chang Sheng was really helpless. It wasn\u2019t what he had expected. He wouldn\u2019t have thought of something like that.</p><br/><p>Xu Fei Yuan was his classmate. It just happened that he came to Shanghai this time and he wanted to introduce him to the others. He didn\u2019t expect this fella to have offended Master Lin\u2019s friend. That was really unlucky for him.</p><br/><p>He could tell that Master Lin had given him a lot of face. Of course, this was based on the fact that he didn\u2019t know anything.</p><br/><p>He knew that Xu Fei Yuan wasn\u2019t going to be happy about it.</p><br/><p>However, he couldn\u2019t do anything about it. He had to wake himself up.</p><br/><p>After finishing the meal at the restaurant, Chen Chang Sheng took out a silver credit card from his pocket. \u201cMaster Lin, I really have to thank you this time. You have to keep this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan didn\u2019t take it at all. He just smiled, \u201cElder Chen, are you looking down on me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Chang Sheng immediately waved his hand after hearing that. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not looking down on you. It\u2019s just my way of showing appreciation. Money is something that can\u2019t be matched up to. Just like a favor.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled, \u201cSince you know that, does that mean that our favors would be measured by money in the future?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2026\u201d Chen Chang Sheng was in a dilemma. He really wanted to thank Lin Fan for resolving the issue. He thought about how to show his appreciation and he felt that the best way was to use his money. However, he didn\u2019t know what to say to Master Lin after hearing his words.</p><br/><p>Then, he looked at the others to seek help.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Chen, keep your card. There\u2019s no need for that. In the future, when my bro looks for you for help, just don\u2019t reject him,\u201d Wang Ming Yang said.</p><br/><p>Chen Chang Sheng replied, \u201cThat doesn\u2019t seem very nice.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet me tell you that. My bro went to Qing Zhou to retrieve the money that I lost. He didn\u2019t even take any of it. How much does your card have?\u201d Wang Ming Yang started to tell him about the past.</p><br/><p>When the others heard that, they were terrified even at the thought of it.</p><br/><p>Qing Zhou\u2019s Ma Qingzhou got destroyed by Master Lin and he even got Wang Ming Yang\u2019s money back. Who wouldn\u2019t be impressed by that?</p><br/><p>As for how much the card contained\u2026</p><br/><p>They didn\u2019t care about it. They just knew that Master Lin didn\u2019t really care about material wealth. If he really cared about that, he would probably be a few times richer than all of them.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cWhat are you thinking about? Just keep it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll keep it then. As long as Master Lin has a favor to ask from me. I will do anything it takes to help you,\u201d Chen Chang Sheng said confidently.</p><br/><p>Soon, the dinner ended on a happy note.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan took a cab home as he couldn\u2019t drive after drinking alcohol.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang also took a cab home. He just left his car there temporarily.</p><br/><p>When everyone left, Chen Chang Sheng saw Xu Fei Yuan sitting on a sofa at an isolated corner of the hall. Xu Fei Yuan sighed helplessly.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Xu.\u201d Chen Chang Sheng walked over and patted him on his shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019re considered to be lucky this time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xu Fei Yuan was depressed, \u201cWhat do you mean I\u2019m lucky? If I were to really do that, wouldn\u2019t I become a laughing stock?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWould you want to become a laughing stock or would you want to lose your life? Which one would you choose?\u201d Chen Chang Sheng asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cObviously, I don\u2019t want to die,\u201d Xu Fei Yuan said. He didn\u2019t expect that to have happened. If he had known, he wouldn\u2019t have talked about it.</p><br/><p>However, whatever he said now was totally useless.</p><br/><p>Things had already happened and he got thrown out of the private room. That was humiliating.</p><br/><p>Chen Chang Sheng looked at his classmate, \u201cAre you thinking about how unlucky you are?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, can\u2019t believe you can see that,\u201d Xu Fei Yuan nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cSigh, you can\u2019t think of it that way. I\u2019ll tell you this. You\u2019re really in luck today. Master Lin only asked you to go back and compensate them. He didn\u2019t do anything else to you. If he were to find out that you didn\u2019t keep to your word, you wouldn\u2019t know what he would do to you,\u201d Chen Chang Sheng said.</p><br/><p>\u201cBro, I\u2019ll speak the truth. He isn\u2019t even a wealthy man. Why are all of you so afraid?\u201d Xu Fei Yuan asked.</p><br/><p>Chen Chang Sheng smiled, \u201cAlright, let me ask you this then. How do you think Master Lin managed to resolve the Qingzhou and the northeastern incidents?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2026\u201d Xu Fei Yuan was speechless. He felt that what his classmate said was true. Did he really escape a calamity?</p><br/><p>\u201cToday, Master Lin gave me some face. If not, it wouldn\u2019t have been resolved so easily. Therefore, when you get back, quickly return them the patent rights and compensate them for their losses. Don\u2019t try to cause any more trouble,\u201d Chen Chang Sheng said.</p><br/><p>Xu Fei Yuan looked at his old classmate and hoped to see a glimpse of hope. However, he didn\u2019t see any hope at all. He just nodded and agreed.</p><br/><p>\u201cI know. I\u2019ll do it when I get back.\u201d What else could he have said? That was all he could\u2019ve said. This time, who knew how much he was going to lose?</p><br/><p>Chen Chang Sheng nodded since Elder Xu agreed. However, he was still a little worried. He repeated, \u201cElder Xu, since you agreed to it, you can\u2019t forget it. If not, I can\u2019t help you when that happens.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I know what to do.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xu Fei Yuan smiled and patted Elder Chen on his shoulder. \u201cAlright, it\u2019s my fault this time. I won\u2019t talk about it anymore. I\u2019ll return tomorrow and resolve this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Chang Sheng nodded happily. If Elder Xu were to continue causing trouble, the final outcome would\u2019ve been devastating.</p><br/><p>If that were to happen, nobody could possibly save him.</p><br/><p>Although he didn\u2019t really know how Master Lin managed to destroy so many influential figures, the mere thought of it scared him.</p><br/><p>However, they were lucky that Master Lin was a well-mannered man. If he was a cocky and hot-tempered man, all of them would be living in fear.</p><br/><p>The next day!</p><br/><p>At Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan stayed in his shop and scrolled through his phone. It was getting a little boring. His task was pretty difficult to complete. He didn\u2019t know what to do to complete it. It looked like he had to depend on his luck.</p></div>\n</div>"}

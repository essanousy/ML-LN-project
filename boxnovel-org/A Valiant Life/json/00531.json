With Guru at their sides, they had learned a significant number of technical skills. These were things that couldn\u2019t be learned from books. If the Guru hadn\u2019t taught them, who knew how long they would take to understand these?</p><br/><p>The sound of laughter emanated.</p><br/><p>\u201cGuru, you\u2019re too awesome. Let me tell you, I\u2019ve seen that movie. It\u2019s very good indeed but I\u2019ve found an even higher definition version and it took quite some work to find it,\u201d said Sun Neng proudly.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said in surprise, \u201cWow, you\u2019re that amazing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe,\u201d Sun Neng laughed as he received this praise.</p><br/><p>They had gotten a hotel room outside the detention house since they were coming over every day. They would return to the hotel at night. Learning skills from the Guru was something that they really yearned for and the Guru wasn\u2019t selfish too. He didn\u2019t try to hide his skills. He really taught them true technical skills.</p><br/><p>They were really grateful for the Guru.</p><br/><p>Outside!</p><br/><p>A number of people had gathered at the entrance of the detention house.</p><br/><p>And these were all reporters. They had waited for a long time already. The news hadn\u2019t been disseminated on the Internet and many netizens were paying close attention to this matter.</p><br/><p>Without getting any news about Master Lin, their hearts wouldn\u2019t be at peace.</p><br/><p>Now, not only the netizens were anxious, even the reporters were very anxious. Even as the frontline personnel of news, they actually could not obtain any news. How scary was that?</p><br/><p>Hence, they were now gathered together, preparing to charge into the detention house. No matter what, they had to find out about Master Lin\u2019s situation.</p><br/><p>This hero was worth their sacrifice. They couldn\u2019t just watch idly as a hero was punished.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you all doing here?\u201d The policemen blocked out the reporters. Without orders, they couldn\u2019t let these reporters in.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re here to gather news about Master Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin is locked inside. What exactly is the situation right now? Have you all tried to extort a confession from him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if he hacked into a bank, he still should go through the legal procedure. Now, he didn\u2019t even go through the legal procedure. You all must have passed a sentence without proper procedure. We request to see Master Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe have the right to know the truth.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe want to see Master Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporters\u2019 objective was clear. Without seeing Master Lin, they would not leave. Moreover, they even had an urge to charge inside.</p><br/><p>The policemen tried to maintain order on the site, \u201cDon\u2019t crowd around. We\u2019ve already asked for instructions from the higher-ups. Please wait patiently.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Liu Xiao Tian received news of this, he was speechless.</p><br/><p>However, he permitted it.</p><br/><p>They could see Master Lin.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>When the reporters founded out that they could see Master Lin, they were all fired up. When they went in, they had to take a good look and check if Master Lin was hurt or if he had been forced to confess.</p><br/><p>Although they occasionally reported untrue news, Master Lin was a hero and no matter what, they had to report truthfully about him.</p><br/><p>They only hoped that Master Lin wasn\u2019t having a hard time. Otherwise, they would be very upset.</p><br/><p>As they headed towards Master Lin, the reporters looked at the surroundings.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis place is too miserable. How can Master Lin endure being here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. And we don\u2019t even know how long he\u2019ll be locked up. I heard that he was sentenced to ten years.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard that he\u2019s been sentenced to thirty years.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSigh, his magnificent youth will be gone. How could that happen?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The policemen opened the last door. \u201cMaster Lin\u2019s location is just in front.\u201d</p><br/><p>When he said that, all the reporters rushed forward as if they couldn\u2019t wait to see Master Lin.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, we\u2019re here.\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporters went in like a swarm of bees.</p><br/><p>Then, Lin Fan was laughing loudly, \u201cHaha, you all are going to lose. What will you do against this card of mine? I\u2019ll play around with you all with an open hand.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sun Neng cried out in shock, \u201cD*mn, that\u2019s way too perverse. Five bombs and your individual cards are jokers. How are we even supposed to play?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled, \u201cIf you surrender, you\u2019ll only lose half.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, we won\u2019t surrender. If you\u2019re going to openly play with us, then don\u2019t blame us.\u201d</p><br/><p>Four of them were playing the card game \u2018Fight the Landlord\u2019 and there were a few other people standing at the side, watching and occasionally giving tips on what card to play.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was holding his cards in one hand and a big chicken leg in the other. He was eating happily. \u201cNo hurry. I\u2019ll let you slowly consider\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, we\u2019re here. You don\u2019t need to suffer anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, a series of shocked cries came from afar. In the blink of an eye, a group of reporters had appeared in the cell, holding cameras in their hands and capturing photos.</p><br/><p>The reporters had many things they wanted to say to Master Lin but when they saw this scene, they were all stunned.</p><br/><p>This\u2026</p><br/><p>Lin Fan slowly looked at the reporters and gently bit his chicken leg. \u201cYou all are here for\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporters scanned the place and rubbed their eyes. Were they seeing things?</p><br/><p>The \u2018suffering\u2019 Master Lin, seemed to be doing pretty good here.</p><br/><p>Eating a big chicken leg.</p><br/><p>Playing cards.</p><br/><p>And he even had a comfortable bed to sleep in.</p><br/><p>This seemed different from the rumors.</p><br/><p>Moreover, this level of enjoyment was enraging.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan asked in a puzzled tone, \u201cMy dear reporters, what are you all doing here?\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, the reporters regained their senses and continued taking photos with their cameras.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, this situation of yours is different from what we had thought.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah! Were you treated cruelly and forced to confess?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, the masses of netizens are very concerned about you. They\u2019ve been worried all this time. How long is your sentence?\u201d</p><br/><p>Their questions were many but it was heartwarming for Lin Fan. He never thought that so many people would be concerned about him. It was really touching.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan put down the chicken leg. \u201cMy dear reporters, I\u2019m very well in here, no need to worry about me. Hacking into the bank was a serious matter. Although my intentions were good, my actions were not right, therefore, I\u2019ve accepted my punishment. I will be here for a month to reflect on my actions.\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporters were lost for words. Reflect on his actions? Reflect my ass! Was there even any other prisoner in the country who lived as freely as him?</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t only have a chicken leg, he even had a comfortable bed and the most important part was that he had people to play cards with him. Even people outside weren\u2019t as comfortable as him.</p><br/><p>The next day!</p><br/><p>Masses of the public saw the news on the Internet and flared up in rage.</p><br/><p>What was up with these reporters\u2019 brains? Why were all they\u2019re headlines similar?</p><br/><p>\u2018Master Lin is getting by very well. Nobody needs to worry.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Master Lin will be out soon.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019ve been very comfortable in this prison. It\u2019s given me a different kind of feeling.\u2019</p><br/><p>These news articles had no photos and didn\u2019t say much either, only that he would be locked up for a month.</p><br/><p>However, how could the netizens believe that?</p><br/><p>\u201cDoes the editor have sh*t for brains? How can he be comfortable in prison? If you say it\u2019s comfortable, why don\u2019t you go?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been in prison before. In there, it\u2019s simply suffering. I\u2019ve vowed to never go back again.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin must be really suffering. Even the editors are hiding the truth.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t believe this news. Release the real news. We will be able to accept it. Is Master Lin hurt or has he been cruelly beaten?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>A certain well-known reporter posted on Weibo: \u201cDear netizens, you all don\u2019t have to keep asking. I\u2019m afraid that you won\u2019t be able to take the truth.\u201d</p><br/><p>When this Weibo post was sent, it garnered even more curiosity. At the same time, all of their gossipy hearts started to burn up.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe want the truth!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRelease the photos. We want to see how Master Lin is doing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, you have to stay strong!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDespicable. This is truly despicable. If I had the ability, I would definitely rescue Master Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>This well-known reporter had never expected his words to draw such drastic public opinion. He was dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>If he let this develop further, it would be bad.</p><br/><p>In the end, he could only release the photos to the public.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is what you all have asked for. Don\u2019t cry after seeing it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ten over photos appeared on Weibo.</p><br/><p>In an instant, discussions rose on the Internet.</p><br/><p>A certain netizen who had been in prison before snarled, \u201cI must have f*cking went to a fake prison!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p></div>\n</div>"}

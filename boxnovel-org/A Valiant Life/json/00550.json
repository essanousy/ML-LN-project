Open the door! Something bad just happened,\u201d a forty-year-old professor\u2019s face was in a panic, as if something big had just happened.</p><br/><p>Behind him were also a few other professors and they looked as if they had seen a ghost. It was like they had never thought this would ever happen.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d a hoarse voice emanated from the room, his tone somewhat annoyed after being woken up that early in the morning.</p><br/><p>Professor Yang opened his door and saw a group of his colleagues outside the door, their faces pale and worried. \u201cWhat thing happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSomething big, let\u2019s go in and discuss this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Inside the room.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Professor Yang\u2019s face turned pale after hearing the bad news.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do we do now? The video has spread online. If we don\u2019t think of a solution, our reputations would be at stake.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow dare he do this? Doesn\u2019t he know the consequences of this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Professor Yang\u2019s eyes widened after realizing what had just happened, his face full of regret. \u201cShit, that video was taken at that time. I realized it but didn\u2019t remember it. I never thought he would use that against us in the end to pressure us. We have to contact him to take down the video to prevent it from spreading further.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt looks like it\u2019s too late. The video was posted this morning at six, and it was the news agencies that posted it. It\u2019s already trending on Weibo.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what do we do now? You guys saw the video- if you don\u2019t think of an idea now, we might all be screwed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t a \u2018might\u2019 anymore, something big has already happened.\u201d</p><br/><p>Thud! Thud!</p><br/><p>The door flung open.</p><br/><p>The President of the Ministry of Education came in in a rage, his face seething. \u201cWhat on earth were you guys thinking, and what is the meaning of the video that was posted online about you guys? If you guys didn\u2019t have any face, it wouldn\u2019t matter, but my name would be dragged down with you guys!\u201d</p><br/><p>He was the President of the Ministry of Education. Although he didn\u2019t say anything in the video, he was still implicated in the case. He would definitely be impacted when the authorities start to investigate the case.</p><br/><p>The younger professors who were standing around kept silent, still unable to believe that that brat would do such a thing.</p><br/><p>If they didn\u2019t clear their names soon, their reputations would be dragged down through the mud and they would be laughing stocks.</p><br/><p>The era was different now, and it wasn\u2019t the good old days when the internet wasn\u2019t around yet.</p><br/><p>At that time, there was no internet, and doing all these underhand tactics didn\u2019t cause any huge consequence since not many people got to know about it. Now, any small thing would be blown up online.</p><br/><p>Especially today\u2019s case.</p><br/><p>They were people of high standing and although some people may not have known who they were, everyone in their business knew who they were. They were the leaders of the industry and now that this had happened, they would definitely be embarrassed and laughed at, and their reputations would be tarnished.</p><br/><p>\u201cGo, to Cloud Street, and look for that brat. Let\u2019s ask him what he wants.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s our only option now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf this thing continues spreading, I\u2019m afraid that we cannot save ourselves, so we have to resolve this fast.\u201d</p><br/><p>The President of the Ministry of Education was panicking. \u201cI don\u2019t care what method you guys use, just make sure that this issue is resolved. Zhao Ming Qing is his student, so I\u2019ll give him a call to see what he can do.\u201d</p><br/><p>On the internet.</p><br/><p>The netizens were all in shock.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is such a huge turn of events.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn, so we\u2019ve been lied to all this while. Pal, I thought those were old and respectable people so I sided with them. Never thought that they would be this despicable.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck, these old b*stards are too cruel! They just stole other people\u2019s work and credited it to themselves.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha! Where are the people who were flaming Master Lin? Come out and continue flaming!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLucky these old guys said it out loud and clear in the video, otherwise we wouldn\u2019t have known the truth.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can know a person by his looks, but you\u2019ll never know what they\u2019re thinking. Professor Yang is one of the most esteemed professors from my hometown, and our school\u2019s hall of fame board still has his picture on it. I never thought that he was this kind of person.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo much blood, sweat, and tears put into writing the educational material. Why did Master Lin let them sign their names?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is like putting a snake and a mice together.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe name list is already out. Ten signatures. Guys, take a look and see if you recognize anyone.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat the f*ck, the principal of my school is on the list.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is some ugly news. The whole nation is shocked, I\u2019m pretty sure no one could have seen this coming.\u201d</p><br/><p>But soon, the damage control crew came to do their job.</p><br/><p>\u201cProfessor Yang is a person of virtue and prestige and his temper is good. He would never do these kinds of things.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe one up there, you can stop with your \u2018damage control\u2019. There\u2019s absolutely no use for that. We already know the truth.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn the face of truth, no liar can stand in the path of justice,\u201d</p><br/><p>Shanghai\u2019s first Chinese Medicine Institution.</p><br/><p>In the office.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing was laughing- the truth was finally out, and he was overjoyed beyond words. Were they dreaming? It wasn\u2019t going to be that easy to defraud his teacher.</p><br/><p>Ring ring!</p><br/><p>The caller ID showed the President of the Ministry of Education.</p><br/><p>The person over the phone had a serious tone.</p><br/><p>\u201cDirector Zhao, please end this now. You should advise your teacher that if this thing starts spreading, it won\u2019t do anyone good.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. This is my teacher\u2019s business. I\u2019m only his student, so I can\u2019t do anything about it,\u201d Zhao Ming Qing sneered.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is the meaning of this, Director Zhao? Do you want to see the world burn? Do you want to lose your job?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing wasn\u2019t afraid at all.</p><br/><p>He laughed coldly. \u201cI think that you are just over thinking. Although I\u2019m only a director, I\u2019m definitely not a pushover. If you want to fire me from my position, you still don\u2019t have the authority to do that. And even if you did, I\u2019ll just quit on my own accord, and spend my time researching Chinese Medicine, since I\u2019m free of all ailments anyway.\u201d</p><br/><p>The President of the Ministry of Health was silent. Thereafter, he took a deep breath. \u201cDirector Zhao, I didn\u2019t mean it that way. I\u2019m just saying that this situation is rather hard to reverse, but if Master Lin continues to pursue it, it won\u2019t do anyone good, especially those elderly professors. They probably can\u2019t take this. If they have any health complications, it\u2019ll be terrible.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although he was the President of the Ministry of Health, Zhao Ming Qing was still the director of a Chinese Medicine Institution. Although Zhao Ming Qing\u2019s appointment wasn\u2019t as high as his, his connections were just as good as his. If he really wanted Zhao Ming Qing fired, there would be a lot of people who would oppose the move, especially Zhao Ming Qing\u2019s son who was also one of the high ranking authorities in the Chinese Medicine business.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t help you here. This is my teacher\u2019s business and I have no right to interfere. You got the wrong guy,\u201d Zhao Ming Qing chuckled.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing hung up the phone before the other party could say anything else. His eyes were full of glee.</p><br/><p>Only when a problem arises do they start regretting.</p><br/><p>Such a shame, it was too late to regret anything.</p></div>\n</div>"}

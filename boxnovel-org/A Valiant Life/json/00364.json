However, Lin Fan found it normal. He thought it wasn't a big deal and it had just been a simple task.</p><br/><p>The situation was still extremely chaotic. A lot of doctors and nurses rushed over. It was a tragic incident and there were a lot of casualties. There were a lot of screams and cries. The people that were looking also felt extremely heavy-hearted. Some of them even started to tear up.</p><br/><p>A middle-aged man looked at his own five-year-old son and looked towards the doctor. He hadn't suffered any serious injuries but his son was badly injured.</p><br/><p>A doctor shook his head helplessly. \"Sorry, I really can't save him. We tried our best.\"</p><br/><p>*Clatter!*</p><br/><p>The man collapsed to the ground and he looked expressionless. Then, the doctor went to another patient. Although he wasn't in the best mood, he couldn't be shaken by emotions. He had to check on other patients and couldn't delay another second.</p><br/><p>The police and reporters came.</p><br/><p>It was a major accident.</p><br/><p>Some of the patients who were badly injured had been rushed to the operating room while those who had been deemed hopeless by the doctors were given up on.</p><br/><p>Although a doctor couldn't give up on a patient easily, there weren't enough doctors and they had to save as many people as they could within the limited time.</p><br/><p>The middle-aged man started to cry in front of the trolley.</p><br/><p>The people around him were extremely saddened when they saw him. His son had just died and no parent could take that easily.</p><br/><p>\"Excuse me, you're obstructing me from saving your child.\" Then, a voice came.</p><br/><p>The middle-aged man raised his head and looked at Lin Fan. Then, he cried, \"The doctor earlier told me that my son is hopeless. He is dead.\"</p><br/><p>\"Do you want your son to be alive or dead? If you want him alive, step aside and don't move,\" Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>\"Alive. I want him alive,\" the middle-aged man cried.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan took a deep breath and said, \"Then, move aside!\"</p><br/><p>The middle-aged man was stunned and he didn't know what to do. The first doctor had said that he was hopeless and now this doctor said he could be saved.</p><br/><p>The doctor that had said he was hopeless turned to Lin Fan. \"That boy is hopeless. Just go and look at the other patients' situations. There isn't much time. We can't waste time on those that are impossible to save. We're all saddened by those that we can't save but we can't rely on our emotions now.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan didn't even raise his head. \"It's okay, he still has hope. Your deduction is too rigid. You have to think about that in the future and not give up on any opportunity to save a life.\"</p><br/><p>The doctor shook his head. \"You\u2026\"</p><br/><p>He wanted to ask about his identity as Lin Fan was gambling on someone else's life. However, before he could say that, he was stunned by what he saw.</p><br/><p>He saw Lin Fan pressing on the boy's body. Lin Fan was breathing slowly and he opened the bag of acupuncture needles. He placed the needles in the 'conceptual vessel', 'Qi Hai', 'Guan Yuan' and other acupoints. Then, he gently placed both hands on the chest and slowly applied pressure. The boy violently raised his legs. It was as if he had felt a heavy impact.</p><br/><p>*crying sound*</p><br/><p>The child suddenly started wailing. The middle-aged man was stunned when he saw that. Suddenly, he was happy again. \"He's alive, he's alive\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the crying boy and placed a needle on his neck. \"Why are you crying? Take deep breaths!\"</p><br/><p>The boy didn't understand that at all. But he suddenly stopped crying and he began to take deep breaths.</p><br/><p>\"Doctor, my son is alive!\" the middle-aged man exclaimed excitedly.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said calmly, \"Not yet. You pressed him down too heavily just now. He couldn't breathe and the lack of oxygen caused a little brain damage. We have to operate on his brain.\"</p><br/><p>\"Huh? Brain surgery?\" The middle-aged man was stunned. Then, he nodded. \"As long as he'll survive, I'll do anything. Even if he has some side effects in the future, it's fine.\"</p><br/><p>\"It's not that serious.\" Lin Fan touched the top of the boy's head and placed a needle there. \"This is the Bai Hui acupoint, it helps to reinvigorate the brain. You probably don't even know what I'm talking about. Step aside and watch.\"</p><br/><p>As Lin Fan acted more calmly, the middle-aged man felt even more hopeful. The man even thought that he was a godly doctor and that it wouldn't be a problem for him.</p><br/><p>The previous doctor who had said that the boy was hopeless was extremely stunned. Then, he raised his thumb. \"Thank you, I guess I was too firm with my deduction.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved his hand. \"Continue to save them. Tell me when you run into a problem.\"</p><br/><p>The doctor wasn't infuriated when he heard that. Instead, he felt even more hopeful. He nodded. \"Alright.\"</p><br/><p>He knew what Lin Fan meant by that. He wanted him to hand over patients that he wasn't confident in saving.</p><br/><p>The surrounding crowd was stunned.</p><br/><p>\"Look, he saved another person.\"</p><br/><p>\"Didn't he say that the boy died? He's actually alive now.\"</p><br/><p>\"He's a godly doctor. This hospital actually has a godly doctor like him.\"</p><br/><p>The police continued to ensure that the situation was free from any distractions. They weren't doctors and they couldn't save anyone. They could only follow their standard procedures and give them the space they needed.</p><br/><p>\"Doctor, I'm not confident about this patient. He is bleeding profusely and his heart has stopped.\" He didn't know how to greet Lin Fan and didn't recognize him.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan went forward. \"Go and continue with the others. Leave it to me.\"</p><br/><p>He roughly knew the situation at his fingertips. The patients' conditions were extremely serious. It was a matter of life and death. If they had received prompt treatment when they had first gotten into the accident, they might have been saved immediately. It was a little too late for them to receive treatment at the hospital. The doctors were helpless but Lin Fan could do it.</p><br/><p>The major class of medical knowledge was indeed a powerful one. If not for the mystical boost, he would've needed to spend a lot of energy on saving the patients. With the mystical boost of the Encyclopedia, it didn't seem like a big problem.</p><br/><p>He didn't know what exactly the mystical boost was. Could it have given him some immortal powers?</p><br/><p>Time passed quickly.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan had looked at almost ten people that had been pronounced helpless by the doctors. He treated them and it seemed like all of them had been saved.</p><br/><p>They just needed prompt follow-up procedures from the hospital and they'd be fine.</p><br/><p>However, the most unfortunate one was the person who had been pronounced dead upon arriving at the hospital. He was the driver. His injuries were too serious and he had died on the way there.</p><br/><p>If Lin Fan had been at the site of the accident, he might have been able to help. But the person was already dead now. Nothing could be done.</p><br/><p>The crowd started to clap. The doctors and nurses collapsed onto the ground in fatigue. They had finally managed to get the situation under control.</p><br/><p>Then, the doctors turned to the unknown godly doctor.</p><br/><p>They knew that if he hadn't been there, there would've been even more fatal casualties.</p><br/><p>The reporters recorded everything and looked at Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan tried to move away discreetly. He wanted to leave immediately.</p><br/><p>\"Doctor,\" a police officer greeted Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan heard it, he ran away immediately.</p><br/><p>The police officer was stunned. It was as if he was still in shock. He didn't know why Lin Fan ran away after hearing his words.</p><br/><p>\"Quick, follow him. See if the doctor has another important task,\" the police team leader said.</p><br/><p>\"Okay.\" The police officers followed him and the reporters were close behind them.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan sprinted and when he turned back, he was stunned. D*mn, they're actually following me.</p><br/><p>\"Doctor, wait!\" The police officers shouted.</p><br/><p>\"Wait your f*cking sister. I'm trying to run away,\" Lin Fan said. He couldn't have stopped. He continued sprinting away.</p><br/><p>But what Lin Fan hadn't expected was that the police officers started using electric bikes and followed him. The speed was pretty fast too.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

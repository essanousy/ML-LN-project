I feel like laughing whenever I think about this. Zhenping Yiming just needs to put up a show in front of the Chinese to help us gain some glory.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe should suppress their overconfident attitude. Do they really think that they\u2019re invincible?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen does the show begin? I can\u2019t wait to see Zhenping Yiming show off in front of the Chinese.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to start soon. Don\u2019t be anxious.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>At the China Network.</p><br/><p>\u201cHoly sh*t! Has Shanghai TV\u2019s brain been eaten? Of all people to invite, they had to invite a Japanese competitor. What dogs. I\u2019ll hate them for life!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t this just hitting us in the face?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m so angry. I\u2019m not going to watch this show anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been looking forward to this. I really want to watch this show!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c^ Are you sick? What so good about this show? Please kill this son of a b*tch.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy? Didn\u2019t you guys know that Master Lin would be taking part in it? He\u2019s a guest!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck! Is that true?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you guys read Shanghai TV\u2019s official Weibo? Master Lin\u2019s name is on the guest list!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSh*t! I\u2019m going to watch it only for Master Lin. I really hope he comes back to the show.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy *ss! Even though Master Lin is awesome, he doesn\u2019t know how to play table tennis. If he goes up, wouldn\u2019t he just be embarrassing himself?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The Internet was buzzing with activity. They had enough of Shanghai TV\u2019s stupid actions. Of all people to invite, they actually invited that b*stard. Do they think that there\u2019s no one better in our own country?</p><br/><p>Many people heard of this, and they decided to give a negative feedback to Shanghai TV.</p><br/><p>Many people left angry comments on the Shanghai TV\u2019s official Weibo. This led to the managers of the Weibo account to feel very awkward. They didn\u2019t know what to do. Even if they were to delete the comments, they wouldn\u2019t be fast enough.</p><br/><p>In the end, they could only disregard them.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The show started.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan expressionlessly sat at the guest table. He had no interest in whatever that was going to happen.</p><br/><p>The host went up on stage, and announced, \u201cWelcome everybody to the show! I am the host, Fang Yun. Let\u2019s welcome the champion of the Asian Championships, Zhenping Yiming, up on stage!</p><br/><p>There was a thunderous applause.</p><br/><p>In the broadcasting room.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat the f*ck? Are these people ret*rded? Why are they clapping?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck! One look and I can tell that this is government propaganda, and the audience are all just fillers!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis Shanghai TV must be sick! If I were to watch their show in the future, I\u2019d eat sh*t!\u201d</p><br/><p>At the Japan Broadcasting Station.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, these Chinese are clapping rather loudly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot bad, not bad. The king has arrived.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Zhenping Yiming was all smiles when he went up on stage. After which, he used Japanese to greet the audience.</p><br/><p>On the stage, there were two sofas. One for the host, and the other for Zhenping Yiming.</p><br/><p>In Lin Fan\u2019s view, Zhenping Yiming was very young. He looked to be about twenty-odd years old. He had a slightly proud expression. The smile on his face showed just how excited he was.</p><br/><p>After all, in Japan, he was already labeled a hero having defeated the undefeated hero of China.</p><br/><p>The host said, \u201cHello.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhenping Yiming replied, \u201cHello to you, host.\u201d</p><br/><p>The host asked, \u201cMay I ask how old are you as of today?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhenping Yiming replied very proudly, \u201cTwenty-five.\u201d</p><br/><p>The host said, \u201cThat\u2019s really young, yet you are able to clinch champion in the Asian Championships. This is really something to be proud about.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhenping Yiming answered, \u201cI\u2019m not really proud of it. This is because, before the competition, I already had the confidence that I\u2019d win the championships. Hence, it was expected.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then the netizens heard this, they started scolding him. They wanted to kill this person. However, there was no way to. Behind this screen, they could only scold him.</p><br/><p>In the Japan Broadcasting Station.</p><br/><p>The Japanese audience started flaring up.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha! Zhenping Yiming is really awesome! His words are just too much!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe confidence to win the championships. Whichever member of the Chinese team is only a stepping stone!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cContinue watching! Zhenping Yiming is helping us to swell our ego!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLook at those guests. Their expression is very ugly. I\u2019ll bet that they\u2019re very unhappy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m happy that they aren\u2019t happy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The host laughed awkwardly. Even though his words made some people angry, but as the host, he had to ensure his composure.</p><br/><p>\u201cMay I ask, who did you think the strongest competitor was the previous Asian Championships?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhengping Yiming was momentarily silent, thereafter, he said arrogantly, \u201cI don\u2019t think I played against any strong opponent. From what I can see, the strongest opponent was myself. I was only able to win the championships because I managed to defeat myself.\u201d</p><br/><p>Japan.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell said! To Zhenping Yiming, the strongest opponent is himself!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe crushed the opponent by an absolute margin of 3-1. Who can be his match?\u201d</p><br/><p>The host had thoughts of mocking him, but he decided to continue asking, \u201cIn the finals, you played against Xu Song. Do you think that he pressured you in any way?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhenping Yiming laughed arrogantly, \u201cPressure? No. There wasn\u2019t any sort of pressure. If there was any pressure, I wouldn\u2019t have won him by three is to one.\u201d</p><br/><p>On the Internet.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck! This b*stard is too arrogant. He only won it once, is there a need to be like this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow I wish I could f*cking kill him now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t stop me! I must teach him how to be a person today.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan frowned. This b*stard was rather arrogant.</p><br/><p>The host didn\u2019t expect this contestant to be so arrogant. He completely didn\u2019t put anyone in his eyes. He quickly changed to the topic of the question.</p><br/><p>\u201cMay I ask what made you decide to walk the path of table tennis?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhenping Yiming laughed, \u201cWhen I was in middle school, I heard that table tennis was always controlled by the Chinese and there was a myth that they are unbeatable. However, I am a person that likes to bust the myths. As a result, I started practicing table tennis, all the way to this Asian Championships, where I found out that this myth wasn\u2019t true and they could be defeated.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck!\u201d</p><br/><p>Although the audience were just fillers, when they heard such arrogant words, they couldn\u2019t take it anymore. Even though they were being paid to be fillers, but they were still Chinese. A small Japanese could be so arrogant. They felt that if this were to go on, they would be sick.</p><br/><p>But very quickly, they were suppressed by the employees.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, this person is too arrogant!\u201d All the guests couldn\u2019t take it anymore. They felt as if their blood was boiling.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded his head, \u201cYes. This person is indeed arrogant.\u201d</p><br/><p>At the Japan Broadcasting Station.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha! I\u2019m going to laugh to death! Let\u2019s see who dares to look down on us now!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat \u2018unbeatable myth\u2019? In the face of Zhenping Yiming, it\u2019s all just a joke.\u201d</p><br/><p>To Zhenping Yiming, he knew what he was saying.</p><br/><p>However, it didn\u2019t matter to him. He was a Japanese. All he needed to do was to let the Japanese fans be happy. He didn\u2019t care about the Chinese.</p><br/><p>Who cares if they hated him?</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t like he relied on them to live.</p><br/><p>At the backstage.</p><br/><p>Director Liu was rather angry, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Didn\u2019t we talk about this before? How could he say these things?\u201d</p><br/><p>The employees by his side were all rather awkward. They didn\u2019t know what to do.</p><br/><p>Everything was made clear before this. However, they didn\u2019t expect the other party to not follow the guideline.\u201d</p><br/><p>The nation\u2019s athletes all gathered together to watch the show, and while watching it, they had very nasty expressions on their faces.</p><br/><p>It was especially so for Xu Song. He lowered his head, his face faced filled with guilt.</p><br/><p>His coach patted Xu Song on the shoulder, \u201cDon\u2019t be stressed. We didn\u2019t expect your injury to recur during this competition. It\u2019ll be okay the next time. Let\u2019s just let him be cocky for now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xu Song nodded his head. He was blaming himself and was crying very badly.</p><br/><p>Moreover, every word said during the show just gave him more stress.</p></div>\n</div>"}

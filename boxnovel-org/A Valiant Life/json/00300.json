Master Lin's scallion pancakes are delicious!\" said a woman who was wearing branded clothes. Even her handbag was the latest model of a designer brand. An average lady wouldn't be able to match up to her.</p><br/><p>She was a typical lady that attracted all the young and rich men.</p><br/><p>\"It's such a scorching hot day and you brought me here to eat scallion pancakes. Are you kidding me?\" the man that alighted from a luxurious car said. He was helpless but since his new girlfriend wanted to come here, he couldn't have rejected her.</p><br/><p>The woman smiled and said coquettishly, \"It's not hot. It's not hot at all\u2026\"</p><br/><p>He Xiao Ming was wearing a smart outfit, even his hair was smartly combed. His technique of hitting on girls wasn't that great. However, he knew how to prepare himself well for it. He was extremely interested in this newly found girl. Although she was a little older than him, he wasn't bothered by it.</p><br/><p>\"Alright, since it isn't hot, let's buy some,\" He Xiao Ming said. When he saw the large crowd, he was stunned. \"This is the Master Lin's shop that you were referring to?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yeah, it's newly opened. There are quite a lot of people queuing up for it,\" the lady said as she smiled while covering her mouth.</p><br/><p>He Xiao Ming was stunned. \"This isn't 'quite a lot' of people. It's extremely crowded. Let's forget about it. We can come another day.\"</p><br/><p>\"No\u2026 I want to eat it today. If you buy it for me today, I'll accede to one of your requests that aren't too overboard,\" the girl said.</p><br/><p>He Xiao Ming's eyes lit up when he heard that. \"Alright, count on me then. But this 'not too overboard' request\u2026 What do you mean by that?\"</p><br/><p>The lady rolled her eyes. \"Just buy it for me and I'll tell you later.\"</p><br/><p>\"Okay, okay. Watch me, you seductive hussy,\" He Xiao Ming said. Initially, he hadn't been interested at all. But now, he was filled with energy. It was just buying a scallion pancake. How difficult could it be for him?</p><br/><p>However, how could a scallion pancake be so delicious? But he dismissed that thought after thinking for a while. It was just a stupid scallion pancake. How could it be so law-defying?</p><br/><p>He was stunned when he saw the number of people in the queue. It was really a lot of people. How long would he have to queue?</p><br/><p>He couldn't just cut the queue since it would probably affect his reputation.</p><br/><p>He stood at the end of the queue. Then, he smiled towards the lady standing in the carpark. He just needed to buy a scallion pancake. How difficult could it be?</p><br/><p>The lady smiled and shouted coquettishly, \"All the best!\"</p><br/><p>He Xiao Ming smiled.</p><br/><p>The lady looked at He Xiao Ming as he entered the queue. She laughed to herself. Controlling this He Xiao Ming was as easy as consuming a meal.</p><br/><p>He was like a little kid who didn't have any experience. His mind was still too simple.</p><br/><p>She had toyed with many young and rich men before. This one was the simplest of the bunch. She didn't even need to put in a lot of effort. She just had to give him a small benefit and it excited him so much.</p><br/><p>He Xiao Ming was standing at the end and then he patted the shoulder of the person in front of him. \"Bro, let me stand in front of you. I'll give you $50.\"</p><br/><p>He calculated how much it would cost to give each of them $100 just to cut the queue. It would probably take more than ten thousand dollars for a piece of scallion pancake. If he had really done that, he would be considered to be a fool, not a wealthy man.</p><br/><p>$50 was the right amount for him.</p><br/><p>The townsfolk in front of him was stunned. How could there be a person as stupid as him? Spending $50 to cut a person's queue was so stupid. He didn't even care if he could buy the pancake, he was just in the queue for fun.</p><br/><p>\"Alright.\"</p><br/><p>Once he handed him the money, he moved in front of him.</p><br/><p>He just spent a little money and he got what he wanted. It was such a steal.</p><br/><p>\"Bro, $50. Give me your spot.\"</p><br/><p>He succeeded again.</p><br/><p>\"$50, give me your spot.\"</p><br/><p>\"$50, I'll stand in front of you.\"</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>He Xiao Ming felt that he was extremely clever to have thought of something like that. With the current speed, he could probably reach the front in no time. But of course, he had to spend a substantial amount of money.</p><br/><p>Then, he patted another man on his shoulder, \"Bro, $50. Let me stand in front of you.\"</p><br/><p>The person turned and sneered, \"You want to cut the queue for just $50? I wonder where you got your courage from to say such a thing.\"</p><br/><p>\"$100\u2026\"</p><br/><p>The man added, \"Do you know who opened this shop? It's Master Lin. It's impossible to depend on such a small amount of money to buy his scallion pancakes. I've been noticing you for a while. You were able to use $50 to buy each of your spots because they don't know the power of Master Lin's scallion pancakes. I've observed that the ingredients are limited. It doesn't mean that every one of us will be able to get the scallion pancake. Just stand here and queue up for it. No matter how much you offer me, I'll not let you have it.\"</p><br/><p>He Xiao Ming was stunned. Was this man crazy? He rejected him even though He Xiao Ming offered him money. How stupid could he be?</p><br/><p>He wanted to just leave and not buy a stupid scallion pancake. But when he thought of the 'not too overboard' request, he tolerated it. Forget it, he'd continue to queue up. Anyway, he was in a decent position.</p><br/><p>According to the current speed, he should be at the front in no time.</p><br/><p>He decided to just wait for it.</p><br/><p>\"Ah!\"</p><br/><p>Then, He Xiao Ming was stunned when he saw the drunk expressions of all those who tasted the scallion pancakes. They looked as if they had eaten drugs. It was horrifying.</p><br/><p>He Xiao Ming was overthinking it. Could the people there have some mental illness? How could they become like that after eating scallion pancakes? He was a little scared but he decided to stay until the end as he thought of the reward he was going to get.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was feeling extremely helpless. The power of the scallion pancakes was indeed great. Those that had eaten the scallion pancakes before were able to control their excitement. However, those townsfolk that had not eaten the pancakes before couldn't control their emotions. They just made exaggerated expressions.</p><br/><p>Master Lin's scallion pancakes were not as simple as they thought. It would take control over you no matter where you were at. The deliciousness could control anyone completely.</p><br/><p>A while later.</p><br/><p>He Xiao Ming laughed as he finally made it to the front. He was going to get his reward right after the person in front of him bought it.</p><br/><p>\"Here's your scallion pancake,\" Lin Fan said. Then, he added, \"Everyone, I'm sorry. There are no more ingredients. If you guys are willing to wait, I'll arrange for people to deliver the ingredients.\"</p><br/><p>The man in front of He Xiao Ming looked at him and laughed. \"I got the last scallion pancake! Thank God I didn't sell my spot to you. If not, I'd have made such a huge loss.\"</p><br/><p>He Xiao Ming was stunned. How could it be so coincidental?</p><br/><p>\"Hey, do you even know how to run a business? Couldn't you have prepared more ingredients? Do you know how long I queued up for? Just because you said one sentence, my time has been wasted!\" He Xiao Ming was infuriated. Wasn't this guy just trying to make a fool out of everyone? He Xiao Ming was about to lose his reward.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at He Xiao Ming with his dazzling eyes \"Kid, you have to learn to control your temper. Do not blow up so easily.\"</p><br/><p>He Xiao Ming looked at Lin Fan and his face turned pale. \"You're the kid, not me. Let me tell you, you better prepare a scallion pancake for me. I don't care how you're going to do it. If not, I'll destroy your shop.</p><br/><p>He couldn't tolerate it anymore and he shouted while he kicked the cart.</p><br/><p>The people in the shop and the crowd were stunned.</p><br/><p>\"What's happening outside? Something's wrong.\"</p><br/><p>\"Hey, that voice is so familiar. It sounds like that same fella.\"</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang looked at He Cheng Han. \"Go have a look outside. I heard that fella is very hot-tempered. I hope it isn't him.\"</p><br/><p>He Cheng Han quickly stood up. \"I'll go have a look.\"</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at him calmly. \"Kid, you gotta learn how to control your temper and not be so arrogant.\"</p><br/><p>He Xiao Ming was bewildered. Was this person crazy?</p><br/><p>The surrounding townsfolk were infuriated, \"D*mn it, how can this fella bully Little Boss? If he doesn't apologize, he can forget about leaving this place.\"</p><br/><p>\"None of us can bear to bully Little Boss but he actually dared to do so. It's normal to run out of ingredients. How can he act like he's entitled to it?\"</p><br/><p>Some of the shop owners in the vicinity saw what was happening and shouted, \"Someone's causing trouble at Little Boss' shop! Everyone, please come!\"</p><br/><p>He Xiao Ming was frightened when he saw what was happening. This man was so well-connected. Then, he shouted, \"What do you want to do? Do you know who my dad is? If you guys touch me, can you afford the medical fees? My dad will not let you off so easily.\"</p><br/><p>Then, someone said, \"I approve of them teaching you a lesson.\"</p><br/><p>He Xiao Ming was stunned. Then, he shouted, \"Who the f*ck are you? How dare you speak to me like that?\"</p><br/><p>\"I'm your father.\"</p><br/><p>He Xiao Ming wanted to scold him again but when he saw who was approaching him, he was stunned. Then, he behaved himself. \"Dad\u2026\"</p><br/><p>He was stunned. What's going on? Why is Dad here?</p><br/><p>....</p><br/>\n</div>"}

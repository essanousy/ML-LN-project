Those were newly grown hair.</p><br/><p>Everyone was stunned. It was not scientific at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow could it be?\u201d The doctor was stunned. Then, he rushed out to get the other doctors to come over. It was a miracle.</p><br/><p>There was a broad smile across Yang Yuan\u2019s face. \u201cBrother, you\u2019re really going to recover this time.\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporters went wild. They felt that it was a supernatural occurrence.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-2\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>The patient had lost all his hair after chemotherapy to treat leukemia. However, what was going on now? His head suddenly had hair growing out of it. If nobody saw it with their own eyes, nobody would have believed it.</p><br/><p>Then, a group of doctors came in.</p><br/><p>Within the group of doctors, there was an elderly doctor wearing a white robe. They were all stunned. When they saw Yang Huan, they immediately went to him and did some checks on him. After their checks, they looked even more stunned.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow could this be?\u201d</p><br/><p>They researched leukemia for their own life and they were the experts of the hospital. They knew that leukemia was not a simple illness to treat. It needed to be treated gradually and an instant recovery was impossible.</p><br/><p>They knew Yang Huan as he was one of the critical patients.</p><br/><p>He achieved decent results after undergoing his first chemotherapy treatment.</p><br/><p>However, when they saw Yang Huan\u2019s current expressions, they started to doubt themselves. Was he even a leukemia patient?</p><br/><p>\u201cQuick, conduct a thorough check,\u201d the elderly doctor said.</p><br/><p>Soon, there were doctors drawing blood for lab tests to be conducted.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-3\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>After their primary examination, they realized that Yang Huan didn\u2019t have any symptoms of leukemia anymore.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle boy, how are you feeling now?\u201d Professor Mao asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cGrandpa, I feel good,\u201d Yang Huan replied.</p><br/><p>Professor Mao continued, \u201cDoes your head still hurt?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. After eating what my brother gave me, I don\u2019t feel any pain anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>He continued asking more questions to verify his condition. After all, he was the expert. After asking a series of questions, Professor Mao was stunned. He was about 80% sure that this boy\u2019s condition had been cured.</p><br/><p>Yang Bin anxiously asked, \u201cDoctor, how is my son?\u201d</p><br/><p>He was really worried that something would happen to his child.</p><br/><p>Professor Mao replied, \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to say. According to our checks so far, I am about 80% sure that he is not suffering from leukemia anymore. His body is gradually recovering. However, I have to wait until all the results are released before making a conclusion. What just happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>When Professor Mao asked that question, everyone turned to Yang Yuan.</p><br/><p>Yang Yuan didn\u2019t know what was happening. He just knew that the most important thing was the fact that his brother was healthy again.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle boy, what did you give your brother to eat?\u201d A doctor asked.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-4\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Yang Yuan replied, \u201cIt\u2019s something that can help him recover.\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporters were stunned. They felt that something incredible just happened.</p><br/><p>It was bound to be a breaking news.</p><br/><p>A pill was all it took to cure leukemia. It was unbelievable.</p><br/><p>The doctor continued asking, \u201cWhere did it come from?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yang Yuan shook his head, \u201cI can\u2019t say. I promised the uncle to keep it a secret if my brother recovers.\u201d</p><br/><p>He was a kid after all and some information was unknowingly revealed.</p><br/><p>He said that he got it from an uncle.</p><br/><p>However, the information was insufficient. The doctors really wanted to know what was going on. How was the medicinal pill concocted? Everything was unknown.</p><br/><p>\u201cBe good, tell me. Where is the uncle that gave this to you?\u201d The doctor asked.</p><br/><p>Yang Yuan replied, \u201cHe left. I don\u2019t know where he went.\u201d</p><br/><p>The doctor asked, \u201cHow did you know him?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yang Yuan shook his head and remained silent.</p><br/><p>The doctor asked gently, \u201cWould you tell me, please? I won\u2019t ask for the specific details. I just want to know how you met him.\u201d Then, he turned to look at Yang Bin, hoping that he could convince his son to say something.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-5\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Yang Bin nodded. \u201cSon, tell the doctor how you met him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yang Yuan looked at them and said, \u201cI met him last night. He spent a night at my house and I took $300 from him. The next day, the uncle asked me where my parents were. I told him that they brought my brother to the hospital. Then, he asked me what happened to my brother. I just said leuk\u2026but he managed to guess it. When he left, he gave me a pill and said that it would help my brother recover\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>After he said that, everyone was stunned.</p><br/><p>They didn\u2019t expect such a person to exist in this world.</p><br/><p>A medicinal pill was all it took to cure leukemia. That was terrifying.</p><br/><p>Professor Mao was so agitated that he couldn\u2019t say anything after hearing what Yang Yuan said. Then, he grabbed onto him, \u201cTell me, what is his name?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yang Yuan shook his head, \u201cI can\u2019t tell you that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBe good, tell me, please?\u201d Professor Mao tried to convince him.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t tell you. I promised him. Regardless of what happens, I can\u2019t tell you.\u201d Yang Yuan was a man of his words. He didn\u2019t want to break his promise.</p><br/><p>Then, Professor Mao became really anxious. What could he do to make him speak?</p><br/><p>Yang Bin was really grateful for the doctors. He didn\u2019t want the doctors to be in a tough spot. \u201cSon, tell them which uncle gave it to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDad, I really can\u2019t say. When he gave it to me, he told me to keep it a secret. I really can\u2019t tell anyone. I don\u2019t want to be a liar,\u201d Yang Yuan said.</p><br/><p>Then, the lab results were out.</p><br/><p>The researchers rushed over in disbelief. \u201cThe results are out. The subject is healthy and has no leukemia.\u201d</p><br/><p>When the results were revealed, everyone was dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>What did they just witness?</p><br/><p>The leukemia patient just instantly recovered. It was unbelievable.</p><br/><p>They felt that the uncle that this boy was talking about must be an extraordinary man.</p><br/><p>How could such a complicated disease be cured with a medicinal pill? It was impossible.</p><br/><p>However, they really wanted to know who it was.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Lin Fan was already climbing the mountain.</p><br/><p>He shook his head upon seeing the steps he had to climb. He wondered who was the one who started building temples on mountains. Climbing it was really tiring.</p><br/><p>However, there were quite a lot of people heading towards the temple.</p><br/><p>It looked like they were all looking for the \u2018Silent Priest\u2019.</p><br/><p>Upon chatting with the passers-by, he found out that the \u2018Silent Priest\u2019 was an incredible man.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was really looking forward to meeting the \u2018Silent Priest\u2019 and seeing how he actually looked like.</p></div>\n</div>"}

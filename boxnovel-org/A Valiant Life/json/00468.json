They had been sitting there and recording the contents of the diagnoses.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan helplessly asked, \u201cAren\u2019t you guys tired?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing shook his head, \u201cNot at all. I\u2019m full of energy. Teacher, quick, tell us about what happened today. There are so many parts that I don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><br/><p>They were hungry for new knowledge.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll explain then. However, we have to sleep at 11 pm. You guys are so full of energy but I\u2019m exhausted.\u201d Lin Fan yawned. The cases in the day were simple to him but they were extremely difficult for Zhao Ming Qing and the others. If nobody explained it to them, they wouldn\u2019t be able to understand anything.</p><br/><p>8 pm.</p><br/><p>9 pm.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>11 pm.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan\u2019s mouth was getting dry but Zhao Ming Qing and the others were still listening attentively. Their eyes were glimmering and they were ecstatic when they gained new knowledge.</p><br/><p>At night.</p><br/><p>There was a video being spread online.</p><br/><p>It was about what had happened in the day at the Citizens\u2019 Hospital.</p><br/><p>\u2018Shocking Godly Doctor\u2019</p><br/><p>The next day.</p><br/><p>Morning came.</p><br/><p>The internet wasn\u2019t quiet anymore.</p><br/><p>On a Jiangning web forum.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you guys see today\u2019s news? There was a godly doctor at the Citizens\u2019 Hospital of Jiangning yesterday. He was giving free medical treatment.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, really?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. I was there yesterday. You guys wouldn\u2019t know about the situation yesterday. Most of the hospitalized patients were discharged after being healed by the godly doctor. It wasn\u2019t because of the hospital\u2019s treatment.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck, that\u2019s too unbelievable. Since when did Jiangning have a godly doctor?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLook, Jiangning Citizen\u2019s Hospital made an announcement.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYesterday, three men and a woman were doing voluntary medical work at the entrance of the hospital. May all the patients be cautious and not get scammed. Don\u2019t delay treatment. Go to a proper hospital to seek treatment.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRubbish. I was a patient who had been in the hospital for a month. My condition didn\u2019t even improve. The godly doctor merely pierced some acupuncture needles into my body and I recovered instantly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c^ are you kidding? Better not be talking rubbish.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRubbish? I\u2019m speaking the truth. I can post a picture of my Hospital bills.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, it\u2019s really true.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>At Jiangning Citizen\u2019s Hospital.</p><br/><p>The Director was there early in the morning but he didn\u2019t see the people that had come the previous day. Then, he went to the security office.</p><br/><p>The security officer immediately greeted the Director when he saw him, \u201cGood morning, Director.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Director nodded, \u201cRemember, if the people that came yesterday are to come again today, inform me immediately.\u201d</p><br/><p>The security officer replied, \u201cDirector, those people won\u2019t be here. I heard that they\u2019ll be going to Jiangning Hospital.\u201d</p><br/><p>After hearing that, the Director heaved a sigh of relief. It was as if he felt that if the people still came today, the hospital would lose all its patients. However, when he heard that they were going to Jiangning Hospital, he laughed.</p><br/><p>He had finally gotten rid of those people.</p><br/><p>They were switching places probably because they were afraid of the patients looking for them after \u2018treatment\u2019.</p><br/><p>However, since those people had already left, he didn\u2019t want to speak too much about it. He just wanted to secure his own hospital.</p><br/><p>At Jiangning Hospital.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan and the others wanted to save themselves some trouble and didn\u2019t set up a booth right at the entrance of the hospital. They set up one across the road and even added a poster.</p><br/><p>\u201cVoluntary Medical Work. Free Treatment from Shanghai\u2019s First Chinese Medicinal Academy.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was an idea thought of by Lin Fan. Zhao Ming Qing was his disciple and he was the Director of the Chinese Medical Academy. The academy wasn\u2019t doing well and he wanted to boost its reputation</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t easy to be a mentor. He had to treat illnesses and boost the reputation of his disciple. Where else would he find such a good teacher?</p><br/><p>He wouldn\u2019t be able to find one anywhere.</p><br/><p>\u201cGodly doctor, godly doctor. You\u2019re here!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been waiting for the whole night.\u201d</p><br/><p>The patients from the Citizens\u2019 Hospital yesterday had been queuing there since the night before. They had been afraid that they\u2019d miss the godly doctor. They heaved a sigh of relief when they finally saw him.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing smiled, \u201cTeacher, your medical skills have convinced everyone.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved his hand, \u201cGotta stay low-key.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing nodded. He was excited about what was to come. He understood that his mentor had always been using Chinese medicine to treat illnesses even though he knew some Western medicine. He was raising awareness for Chinese medicine.</p><br/><p>Qiu Jie and Zhang Tong Tong were ecstatic. They were feeling even better than yesterday. There were already a lot of patients early in the morning. They felt especially great when the patients called Lin Fan \u2018Godly doctor\u2019. Although they weren\u2019t addressing them, they were addressing their mentor.</p><br/><p>After Director Zhao had finished listening to Lin Fan\u2019s explanations the night before, they had approached him for more knowledge. They gained a lot of wisdom from that.</p><br/><p>At the same time, they could finally accept that Teacher Lin was Director Zhao\u2019s mentor.</p><br/><p>Teacher Lin had such powerful medical skills and he deserved to be Director Zhao\u2019s mentor.</p><br/><p>At Jiangning Hospital.</p><br/><p>The Director, doctors and nurses didn\u2019t even know what was happening at the entrance. They were continuing with their work in the hospital.</p><br/><p>At a certain ward.</p><br/><p>A few patients were lying motionlessly in their beds. They had been in the hospital for a very long time and their emotions were greatly affected.</p><br/><p>Anyone would feel very suppressed if he/she were to stay in the hospital for a long period of time. Because they\u2019d feel like they were nearing death.</p><br/><p>At a certain ward.</p><br/><p>A young lady was lying there. She was pretty but her eyes were lifeless. However, she was still smiling.</p><br/><p>\u201cDad, Mom, Brother, and Sister, don\u2019t cry. I will recover.\u201d The lady was suffering from a serious condition but she was consoling her family members. Her eyes made her look like she couldn\u2019t bear to leave them.</p><br/><p>Her family members were farmers. Her siblings were young but she was already twenty-seven. In Jiangning, she was preparing to have a stable life and improve the lives of her family members. However, the Gods played a prank on her and she caught a serious illness. It was something that couldn\u2019t be cured.</p><br/><p>\u201cHui Hui\u2026\u201d Her elderly parents looked at her and started to cry.</p><br/><p>Liu Jia Hui was a small actor but she could take hardships. She was willing to do anything and she was sincere. Her attitude had moved the director and she was allowed to be the second female lead in a television drama. She had gradually gained some reputation and she had felt that she was on the right track to fame.</p><br/><p>Although she wasn\u2019t earning much, it was enough to raise her siblings. At the same time, she could let her parents have a good life.</p><br/><p>\u201cHui Hui\u2026\u201d then, a voice came from outside the ward.</p><br/><p>Liu Jia Hui looked out and smiled, \u201cWhy are you guys here?\u201d</p><br/><p>They were all her good friends and her colleagues. They had always wanted to become famous celebrities but they always depended on their own abilities and hard work to reach the top.</p><br/><p>Liu Jia Hui smiled, \u201cWhy are you guys crying? I\u2019m doing well!\u201d</p><br/><p>They shook their heads, \u201cWe heard from Auntie that you went to the Chinese medical doctor yesterday. Did the acupuncture needles hurt a lot?\u201d They began to cry as they spoke.</p><br/><p>They were all young and beautiful. They felt heartbroken whenever they thought of Jia Hui\u2019s plight.</p><br/><p>Liu Jia Hui smiled, \u201cNo, it wasn\u2019t painful at all. You guys still have work. Hurry up and head back.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. The director allowed us to come here. Also, the director and other team members will be coming tonight. You have to fight on! We\u2019re right by you,\u201d her good friends said.</p><br/><p>However, they knew that her illness had no cure and it was hopeless.</p><br/><p>\u201cSister Wang\u2026\u201d then, a middle-aged woman waved at Liu Jia Hui\u2019s Mom.</p><br/><p>Liu Jia Hui looked at her and nodded, \u201cAuntie.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was the cleaner whom she had met after staying at the hospital. She had been talking to her.</p><br/><p>\u201cQuickly come over here for a moment.\u201d The cleaner auntie was a little anxious. It was as if she wanted to say something that wasn\u2019t pleasant to be said in the hospital.</p><br/><p>Liu Jia Hui\u2019s mum consoled her daughter, then went to over to the cleaner auntie.</p><br/><p>\u201cSister Wang, I want to tell you something. Don\u2019t tell anyone about this yet. There is a godly doctor outside the hospital\u2019s entrance. He\u2019s doing voluntary medical work and I heard his medical skills are superb. If possible, bring Jia Hui there and perhaps he can do something about it,\u201d the cleaner said.</p><br/><p>When Sister Wang heard it, she was a little emotional but the excitement soon vanished. \u201cHow could it be useful? Even the hospital can\u2019t do anything about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cListen to me. I heard from my good friends over at the Citizens\u2019 Hospital. The godly doctor was there yesterday and he cured a lot of patients. This matter had been reported online too but it hasn\u2019t been spread yet. Listen to me and bring Jia Hui there. What if it works? Furthermore, if this matter were to be made known to everyone, there would be even more people there. There aren\u2019t a lot of people now. Hurry up and go there,\u201d the cleaner said.</p><br/><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Sister Wang was in disbelief.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, do you think I\u2019m lying to you? You should know about Jia Hui\u2019s condition. She could leave anytime and she\u2019s in so much pain. There\u2019s a chance for her to recover now, why aren\u2019t you taking it?\u201d The cleaner knew about this but didn\u2019t tell anyone besides Jia Hui\u2019s mother. She felt that Jia Hui was pitiful.</p><br/><p>She had come to Jiangning alone to look for a job and stayed in the basements before. She hadn\u2019t been able to live comfortably. Now that she was finally achieving something, she got ill. The only hope of the family was gone. Who would be able to handle that?</p><br/><p>\u201cQuickly go there. If more people were to find out about it, you might lose your spot,\u201d the cleaner said.</p><br/><p>Sister Wang thought about it. \u201cAlright, I\u2019ll bring Jia Hui there now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p></div>\n</div>"}

The matters here had already been finished. Regarding what had occurred, Lin Fan felt very helpless.</p><br/><p>Actually, he hadn\u2019t wanted to go on stage but who would have known that he wouldn\u2019t be able to resist going on stage? In the end, he had created such a situation.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan looked at her phone, then looked up. A glimmer of excitement shone in her pretty eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Lin, you\u2019ve gone viral once again.\u201d</p><br/><p>She was already used to Brother Lin\u2019s lifestyle. He wouldn\u2019t be the Brother Lin that she knew if he didn\u2019t go on the news several times in a month.</p><br/><p>Moreover, this time\u2019s news was really quite explosive. The Internet had been overturned.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shook his head indifferently. \u201cSigh. I actually don\u2019t want this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang looked over at Brother Lin slowly and stiffly. He felt an indescribable stifling sensation as if there was blood in his throat that he wanted to spew out.</p><br/><p>Who knew how many people wanted to become famous? They would think of countless strategies to draw the attention of the public.</p><br/><p>But Brother Lin was saying that he didn\u2019t want this.</p><br/><p>If other people were to find out, they wouldn\u2019t want to live anymore.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Lin, can you not say things like that? We have to talk normally. Although we\u2019re already used to it, I still can\u2019t take it sometimes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang spoke bitterly. He felt that he had to give Brother Lin a reminder. After all, they were all friends here and there were no outsiders. It was pointless to say such hurtful things.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled and nodded. \u201cSigh. It can\u2019t be helped. I\u2019ll just have to endure it for a while. This matter will pass very quickly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian sighed. Ever since he had stopped reading fortunes on the bridge, he felt as if his life had changed.</p><br/><p>Sometimes, he would feel as if life was meaningless if he didn\u2019t receive a heavy impact once in a while.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t want to say anything. He had truly been impacted by this kid.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh! Master Lin\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, a group of people ran over from afar. These people were running as fast as the wind and very soon, they reached the front of the bus.</p><br/><p>Seeing this group of people, Lin Fan\u2019s heart groaned. These inheritors had rather upright natures. Otherwise, they wouldn\u2019t have been able to calm their hearts and spend their lives practicing the martial arts they had inherited.</p><br/><p>With those abilities, becoming wealthy people and enjoying yearly incomes of millions wouldn\u2019t be a problem at all.</p><br/><p>But now, most of these people looked very normal. They were from average households and they earned several thousand per month. They would train when they returned home from work each day.</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone, I\u2019ll await you at the Shanghai association. You don\u2019t have to rush. Come one at a time. I won\u2019t disappear from Shanghai,\u201d said Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>He had to appease these guys. The previous day, if Elder Huang hadn\u2019t appeared to chase these guys away, he had no idea what would have happened.</p><br/><p>With so many people squeezing into a single restaurant, that restaurant had nearly gotten torn down.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis trip has been worth it. I\u2019ve been able to see an expert like Master Lin. He could be said to be number one in the world.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not just number one in the world. If this was the past, he would be the head of the martial arts world, the chief of the martial arts circles.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. He embodies all the different styles of martial arts. When I saw my clan\u2019s techniques demonstrated by Master Lin, I felt immensely proud. It turns out that my clan\u2019s techniques are so amazing but I just haven\u2019t reached that level yet.\u201d</p><br/><p>Some of these people had felt that the martial arts they had inherited were not as good as other martial arts.</p><br/><p>But now, after viewing Master Lin\u2019s performance, they realized that it wasn\u2019t that their clans\u2019 martial arts were no good but they just hadn\u2019t practiced the martial arts well enough.</p><br/><p>Seeing those techniques being exhibited by Lin Fan, they seemed like incredible godly techniques. But if they were to perform the same martial arts, it would seem unimpressive.</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang immediately took out his phone and recorded this scene.</p><br/><p>This scene was very unlikely. It was like a modern version of a farewell party. Then, he shouted, \u201cWhat difference is there between the past and now? Why don\u2019t you let my Brother Lin be the chief of the martial arts circles? My Brother Lin\u2019s kung fu is the best after all.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck. Don\u2019t spout nonsense.\u201d When Lin Fan heard that, he was startled. But then, he felt that this Zhao Zhong Yang was trying to give him even more responsibilities.</p><br/><p>The inheritors heard this and started shouting, \u201cYeah! Master Lin\u2019s kung fu is the best in the world. Why don\u2019t we get Master Lin to be the chief of the martial arts circles, the leader of the martial arts world?\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, another person agreed and said, \u201cI think it\u2019s fine. Master Lin might be young but he has all of our respect. We should have a leader too.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gradually, voices filled the entire place. They were all in approval of this.</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan heard all this, of course he had to stop it. There were so many people here, hundreds of them. If he were to become their boss, then he would have a lot more to do in the future.</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone, please quieten down. Right now, we are in a lawful society. There are no such organizations anymore. Let us just stay as friends through martial arts and continue to learn from one another.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shouted as he strained his voice.</p><br/><p>However, since Zhao Zhong Yang had brought this matter up, all these people were considering it and they felt that it was good.</p><br/><p>Although they didn\u2019t have big conflicts amongst themselves, they wouldn\u2019t submit to anyone. Now, someone had appeared who possessed the power to suppress all of them and make them submit.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, I feel that the suggestion is good. We would never submit to anyone but we have submitted to you. Your kung fu is the best and you\u2019re helping us to complete our techniques. This is a huge favor that is hard to repay. If this was the past, it would be considered a great benevolence.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, I agree. Master Lin should become the leader of our martial arts world.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what about the association?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAssociation? There are way too many liars there. If they dare to speak nonsense, we\u2019ll go there and fight. We\u2019ll fight until they give in.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. Why do we need their approval for our own matters? If anyone dares to intervene, let\u2019s have a spar and see who\u2019s more powerful.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, the situation had flared up.</p><br/><p>In the distance, Elder Huang and the rest were standing and watching the situation. He was laughing bitterly.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m old. It\u2019s the young people\u2019s world now. I think I should take a step back.\u201d</p><br/><p>When the person next to him heard that, he was startled. \u201cElder Huang, you\u2019re not old yet.\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Huang waved his hand. \u201cThey\u2019re right. Right now, the era has changed but the martial arts world still exists. Now that this Master Lin\u2019s power has suppressed everyone and he has gained everyone\u2019s respect, it wouldn\u2019t be a problem for him to become the leader of the martial arts world. His reputation is backed up by his abilities. I approve of this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s so young\u2026\u201d The person next to him couldn\u2019t quite approve of it.</p><br/><p>Elder Huang shook his head. \u201cBeing young is not a problem. You probably don\u2019t know about this Master Lin\u2019s background. You should take a look at the Internet. His medical ability is brilliant and could be said to be the best in the world. He practices martial arts while being adept in medicine. If this was the past, he would be a being respected by all.\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

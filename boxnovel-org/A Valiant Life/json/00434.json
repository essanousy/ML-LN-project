What happened to me?\u201d Jin Xuan Ming felt that his face felt unusual.</p><br/><p>The manager sighed. \u201cXuan Ming, it\u2019s over. We\u2019re doomed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jin Xuan Ming looked at his manager\u2019s facial expression and his face changed. \u201cWhat happened? What happened to me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour chin and nose are tilted from the kick. Your nose bridge was broken and the internal cushion for your chin was broken too. They need to be fixed as soon as possible. Furthermore, the technology here in China can\u2019t be matched to that in Korea. Therefore, I recommend that you return to Korea,\u201d his manager said. She was feeling extremely helpless. Her pot of gold had just been broken.</p><br/><p>\u201cReturn to Korea?\u201d Jin Xuan Ming\u2019s eyes widened. Then, he shouted, \u201cHow could it be? I can\u2019t return back. I am so popular in China now and if I go back to Korea, I\u2019ll lose everything. I haven\u2019t earned enough money yet. It\u2019s so easy to earn money in China, how can I go back so soon\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>His manager shook her head. \u201cWhat else can you do besides return back home? What do you think the fans would feel if you post a picture of yourself on Weibo now? Stop overthinking. We have checked China thoroughly. When your fans find out that you\u2019re disfigured and are no longer their prince charming, they\u2019ll run to another celebrity after consoling you for a short while.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s impossible, did you see how much the stupid Chinese fans love me? How could they give up on me?\u201d Jin Xuan Ming shouted.</p><br/><p>Then, his manager turned around. \u201cWho is that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Some of the reporters who had been recording their conversation quickly dispersed.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go back and look for someone who understands Korean to translate it. I feel that there\u2019s a big secret in here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, we got it, we really got it!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, Jin Xuan Ming is so miserable. If his fans see this, they\u2019d be shocked to death.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The manager was stunned when she heard it. She quickly went out. \u201cStand right there, don\u2019t move! Delete the film.\u201d</p><br/><p>Obviously, she didn\u2019t have the capability to compete with these experienced reporters.</p><br/><p>The manager just stared at them running away and was stunned. It was over.</p><br/><p>Her conversation with Jin Xuan Ming had been recorded by them.</p><br/><p>The Chinese were extremely passionate about the idols they liked. However, if they were to find out the truth, they would definitely be enraged, regardless of who they were.</p><br/><p>Perhaps he was indeed a miserable man.</p><br/><p>If their idol said something that violated their will, they\u2019d definitely have a change of heart and wouldn\u2019t care about how much they loved him in the past.</p><br/><p>Of course, there were still hardcore fans that would stay with the idol but it was extremely rare. Once the matter was blown up by the media, everyone would find out the truth about the idol.</p><br/><p>Some of the celebrities were extremely capable of protecting themselves. They would typically refrain from saying anything that would infuriate their fans.</p><br/><p>Outside.</p><br/><p>On Weibo.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan\u2019s Weibo had been flooded with hateful messages.</p><br/><p>Autumn Sword Fish Killer was the Flame War Emperor of Lin Fan\u2019s Weibo but he couldn\u2019t defeat those hardcore fans of Jin Xuan Ming and it was humiliating for him. There were simply too many people and he couldn\u2019t compete with them at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cI give up.\u201d</p><br/><p>Autumn Sword Fish Killer was speechless. It was his first defeat and the first time he had witnessed the true power of Korean fans. It was something that the Chinese celebrities couldn\u2019t do.</p><br/><p>If one were to scroll through Lin Fan\u2019s Weibo, he or she would see that it was filled with hateful messages.</p><br/><p>Jin Xuan Ming\u2019s fans were extremely hurt and depressed by the fate of their idol. They couldn\u2019t take it and started to scold Lin Fan on Weibo. They used extremely harsh words against him.</p><br/><p>At the same time, some of the fans started to cry. It was pathetic.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan\u2019s Weibo post from yesterday was also being targeted by Jin Xuan Ming\u2019s fans.</p><br/><p>\u201cFeels great just like your mum.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy idol is not someone you can mess with.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI hope Xuan Ming Oppa recovers fully. Please let this f*cker take his place.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRubbish Master Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian said, \u201cD*mn, this kid\u2019s Weibo just got flooded by these stupid fans.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan said, \u201cHow could they do that? Sigh, but we can\u2019t do anything anyway.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang was busy with a broadcast. \u201cEveryone, Master Lin\u2019s Weibo just got taken over by people. Please help to fight for Master Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>The fans in the broadcast room suddenly became lively.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck their moms. They dare to mess with our Master Lin? We have to destroy these retarded fans.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBrothers, let\u2019s go and destroy them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll fight for Master Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, Zhao Zhong Yang\u2019s fans and Lin Fan\u2019s Weibo fans all started to take action. They wanted to give their all and start a war.</p><br/><p>Autumn Sword Fish Killer had been observing the situation. When he saw that the respective fans were fighting against each other, he was stunned. He hadn\u2019t expected the fans of this heartless boss to be so powerful. Furthermore, there were still people who came to help. It was unbelievable.</p><br/><p>On the other hand, Lin Fan wasn\u2019t bothered by the situation online at all. He just let them continue with their fights.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, he hadn\u2019t managed to have a meal with Yue Qiu Ju Shi and the rest. The art exhibition had stopped and although the artwork had come back, Yue Qiu Ju Shi felt extremely unsettled.</p><br/><p>In order to let Yue Qiu Ju Shi calm himself down, they had to postpone this meal.</p><br/><p>However, it was set to be taking place tonight.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan didn\u2019t reject their request. Yue Qiu Ju Shi and the others were a lively bunch of elderly men. They were extremely passionate about national artworks. He could tell that they loved his artworks a lot.</p><br/><p>Especially the president of the Chinese Arts Association, Zheng Zhong Shan. He kept looking at Lin Fan as if he was hinting him to give him an artwork too.</p><br/><p>Of course, Lin Fan pretended not to know about it. He didn\u2019t want to draw too much as it would seem like it was easy to make him draw for others. Then, it\u2019d be meaningless.</p><br/><p>Then, Wang Ming Yang called.</p><br/><p>He picked up the phone and Wang Ming Yang started speaking.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, you actually forgot about me just because I didn\u2019t take the initiative to call you,\u201d Wang Ming Yang complained.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. \u201cHaha, I am your older brother after all. The younger sibling ought to make the call. What\u2019s up?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTonight, Yun Gang is going to bring me to meet someone. Do you want to come and support me so that I won\u2019t be bullied?\u201d Wang Ming Yang smiled.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. \u201cI can\u2019t make it tonight, I have an appointment with another group of people. Just go with Chief Wu. However, please be safe. Wealthy men like the both of you should know how to party hard. Please do not get into that kind of business and get sexually transmitted diseases, I can\u2019t treat those.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, no, what are you saying? We\u2019re honest people, how could we be involved in that? Alright then, I\u2019ll hang up here. I have already asked you along and you\u2019re the one who rejected me. Don\u2019t complain about me not bringing you along,\u201d Wang Ming Yang said.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cAlright, let\u2019s hang up here. Go and play then!\u201d</p><br/><p>After hanging up.</p><br/><p>It was pretty late already.</p><br/><p>He parked his car and walked towards the hotel where they would be meeting.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

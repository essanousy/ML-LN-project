She had heard his phone conversation and it seemed as if he was going to Kunlun Mountain.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shrugged. \u201cThe Martial Arts Association wants me to lead a team to Kunlun Mountain to join some kind of exchange meet. I haven\u2019t really been to the association since joining it so I agreed. I\u2019m going to go for a visit to Kunlun Mountain.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut the people who organized this meet really have a problem. To have to travel all the way there in this weather, isn\u2019t that just inflicting punishment on myself?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan had given in. <em>If you picked Mount Tai or Yellow Mountain, I would\u2019ve understood. But I really can\u2019t understand you picking such a far location. But forget it. I\u2019ll just treat it as a little trip.</em></p><br/><p>Fraud Tian heard that and instantly became energized. \u201cCan I go too?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at Fraud Tian and couldn\u2019t help but smile. \u201cSure. If you want to go, you can. I\u2019ll bring you out to experience the world.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, what are you talking about? I\u2019ve seen lots of things like these in my life. In the past, I traveled everywhere with my father and we were unmatched no matter where we went. I\u2019ve even fought those people who called themselves the \u2018Number One Fist\u2019 or the \u2018Number One Swordsman\u2019. They were nothing much at all.\u201d As Fraud Tian recalled his glory days, he was filled with pride.</p><br/><p>But when he grew up, after learning all those skills, a tragedy happened.</p><br/><p>He had been having a duel with someone and he had just beaten that person until that person puked blood. Then, the police came and took him away. They didn\u2019t care who he was. It was illegal to have private fights.</p><br/><p>After this happened for a few times, Fraud Tian had become afraid. He realized that he had learned all his martial arts for nothing. He had to think about getting captured by the police every time he fought.</p><br/><p>As for those life and death consent forms or whatever, those were just to trick people.</p><br/><p>In the past, he had seen other people sign those forms and he had even gone to watch the fight. In the end, he attended the execution of that master who had beaten his opponent to death.</p><br/><p>That scene was a miserable one.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan was very excited as well. \u201cBrother Lin, can I go too? I want to go and take a look as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, let\u2019s go together then.\u201d Lin Fan felt that it would be more lively with more people that he knew. He wondered how long they would go there for.</p><br/><p>Wu Tian He smiled. \u201cI\u2019ll just look after the shop. I\u2019m old and I can\u2019t endure traveling all the way there.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDad, it really isn\u2019t good for you to travel all the way there,\u201d said Wu You Lan.</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang, on the other hand, was thrilled. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen this kind of exchange meets before. I have to go too. At the same time, I\u2019ll let my Internet friends see the exchanges between experts.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded. \u201cAlright, we\u2019ll all go together. Then let\u2019s close the shop for today. Go back and pack your things. We have to set off tomorrow. The meet will be in two days.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian had not traveled in a long time. Now that they were going to attend this exchange meet, he was exhilarated.</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang had never seen such a thing before. Now that he was going out to see such a big event, he was even more excited.</p><br/><p>As for Wu You Lan, she just wanted to see the outside world with Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>To Lin Fan, it wouldn\u2019t be nice of him to reject President Niu\u2019s request. Otherwise, he would never travel there.</p><br/><p>The Martial Arts Association.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan drove here to take a look at the situation. He hadn\u2019t been here in a long time and he had no idea what it was like now.</p><br/><p>He parked the car in the carpark. Then, he walked towards the entrance. When the security guard saw someone coming, he wanted to stop the person and ask for an identification. But when he saw who it was, he instantly came to his senses.</p><br/><p>\u201cPresident Lin\u2026\u201d the security guard called out excitedly.</p><br/><p>He had been working here since the previous year. Naturally, he knew that Master Lin was the association\u2019s Vice-President. Now that he saw Master Lin, he was in disbelief. He hadn\u2019t expected that he would finally see Master Lin come after so long.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello.\u201d Lin Fan smiled and nodded at him.</p><br/><p>The security guard had a look of gratefulness on his face as he started speaking to himself. \u201cAh, Master Lin actually said hello to me. I\u2019m so lucky!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan felt very helpless regarding such situations. He felt that the opposite party was being too excited.</p><br/><p>In the end, he just entered the association without saying much else.</p><br/><p>Looking left and right, he realized that the association had changed greatly. The old equipment from before had all been replaced. Even the flooring seemed to have been changed. Also, the walls of the rooms had been repainted. The place gave off a feeling of cleanliness and liveliness.</p><br/><p>To Lin Fan, this was what a martial arts association should be like, a place promoting vitality.</p><br/><p>As he walked, many people started discussing.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, look at that person. Why does it feel like he\u2019s President Lin?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou must be mistaken. President Lin hasn\u2019t come here in a long while. Right now, he\u2019s over at Cloud Street.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I swear I\u2019m not mistaken. President Lin\u2019s photo is still pinned along the corridor. I definitely can\u2019t be wrong.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen why don\u2019t you call his name and see if he responds?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPresident Lin\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was taking in the atmosphere when he heard someone call him. He turned around and saw a group of people pointing at him and talking about him. Then, he smiled. \u201cHello\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>When those people received a reply, they were exhilarated.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, it really is President Lin!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPresident Lin has come to the association!\u201d</p><br/><p>A group of people ran over hurriedly and surrounded Lin Fan. A man dressed in his training attire said excitedly, \u201cPresident Lin, I finally manage to see you after waiting for so long.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled and said, \u201cWhy were you waiting to see me?\u201d</p><br/><p>The man took out his phone and wanted to take a selfie with Lin Fan. \u201cPresident Lin, I just joined the association a while back. I come here every day hoping to see you. I didn\u2019t think that I would finally see you today.\u201d</p><br/><p>When he came to the association, he had heard about the legend here.</p><br/><p>President Lin had completely overwhelmed all the chairmen of the association single-handedly, without a shred of hesitation.</p><br/><p>As for why he had done it, it had all been for a group of disabled children whose performance segment had gotten canceled for no reason. This had made President Lin furious and he had stormed right into the office, causing a ruckus. He had beaten those chairmen until they screamed and cowered in fear.</p><br/><p>Although the man hadn\u2019t witnessed that scene personally, he felt that it must have been a miserable scene.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin.\u201d Jiang Fei had seen that figure in the distance and hadn\u2019t dared to confirm it at first. But when he saw Lin Fan\u2019s face, he immediately recognized him. Then, he walked over excitedly. \u201cMaster Lin, it really is you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Brother Jiang, it\u2019s been so long. Why haven\u2019t you come to Cloud Street to look for me?\u201d Lin Fan saw him and instantly broke into a smile. This Jiang Fei was an old friend. In the past, Jiang Fei would take very good care of him whenever he came to the association.</p><br/><p>Jiang Fei saw that Master Lin was being surrounded by a group of people, so he started waving his hands. \u201cWhat are you all doing? Hurry up and get on with your own business. Master Lin has come back to the association. You\u2019ll have lots of opportunities to see him in the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. We\u2019ll just take some photos,\u201d said Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>The association members were incomparably thrilled. Then, they started snapping photos without hesitating anymore. Afterward, they finally left contently.</p></div>\n</div>"}

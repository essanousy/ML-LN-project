Up till now, she didn\u2019t understand what Master Lin was doing this for. What did gathering funds for the children\u2019s education have to do with WeChat?</p><br/><p>A Mercedes-Benz came to a halt.</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan saw Zhang Long and the rest, he waved. \u201cChief Zhang.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Long had done his research on Lin Fan and when he found out that this Master Lin was THAT Master Lin, he was a little shaken. This Master Lin was that godly doctor who went viral on the Internet a while ago.</p><br/><p>Also, there were his scallion pancakes and other things that were astonishing as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cNice to meet you, Master Lin.\u201d Zhang Long went forward immediately and shook his hand. This was the first time they had met in person. As the WeChat\u2019s operations person-in-charge, as long as he didn\u2019t do any bad things, he was naturally unafraid of anybody. However, this Master Lin seemed like a legend and it made him want to get to know this Master Lin.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said courteously, \u201cI\u2019ve troubled you all to come all the way here. Please, come in.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are too courteous, Master Lin,\u201d Zhang Long said. The other technical personnel nodded as well and followed behind as they all entered Nanshan Children\u2019s Welfare Institute together.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan pointed to the front, \u201cAt Nanshan Children\u2019s Welfare Institute, most of the children were once rescued from the hands of human traffickers. Some of them are already not too young and they need to start receiving an education. However, the number of children is rather high and it doesn\u2019t seem possible to send them all to the public schools. That\u2019s why I think we should rely on ourselves and form a school here for the children to undergo education. Of course, the capital required is not small, so I\u2019d like to ask for Chief Zhang\u2019s help.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Long didn\u2019t interrupt him but kept on nodding. After he heard everything, he sighed, \u201cMaster Lin is truly admirable. This is a good deed. These children are really pitiful. Since Master Lin thinks so highly of WeChat, we naturally won\u2019t spare any effort in helping you, Master Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha,\u201d Lin Fan laughed, \u201cChief Zhang, please follow me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Very quickly, everyone reached the drawing room.</p><br/><p>The children\u2019s laughs filled everyone\u2019s ears.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan led Chief Zhang and the rest as they walked at the back, looking at the children\u2019s artworks. Then, Lin Fan said, \u201cMy plan is for the children\u2019s artworks to be placed on your platform for auction. As for the overall procedural methods, please help us with that, Chief Zhang.\u201d.</p><br/><p>Zhang Long was silent for a moment as his mind started brainstorming for a method of operation. Meanwhile, the other technical personnel were thinking as well.</p><br/><p>At that moment, one of the personnel said, \u201cChief Zhang, we could scan the children\u2019s artworks and make an emoji package and then collect fees based on usage. What do you think?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s possible. That kind of method isn\u2019t suitable for these artworks. However, I do think that since it\u2019s for a group of children, we can use our platform. Netizens nowadays are very kind and they are protective and supportive of underprivileged groups.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Long nodded, indicating his agreement. Then, he said, \u201cWhat do you all think about this? We scan the artworks and carry out some editing. Then, we place them on the platform and sell them for one dollar each as a charity sale. Don\u2019t be angry, Master Lin, but these children\u2019s artworks, if I say it in a harsh manner, are definitely not suitable for show. However, if you look at them another way, they look a little like splash-ink paintings and would be pretty good as phone wallpapers.</p><br/><p>\u201cOne dollar isn\u2019t much. If we sell them for one dollar each, I believe the result will be pretty good.\u201d</p><br/><p>The technical personnel were thinking, considering whether Chief Zhang\u2019s plan would work. Then, their final conclusion was that it definitely would.</p><br/><p>\u201cChief Zhang, that\u2019s a great plan.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOne dollar isn\u2019t too much. Anyone who uses WeChat would be able to bear to pay that much.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMoreover, it\u2019s to support the children of the Welfare Institute. It\u2019s a charitable deed. It will definitely work.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan hadn\u2019t said anything. Leaving it to the professionals was definitely not a problem. Then, he said, \u201cChief Zhang, how do you reckon we should split the profit?\u201d.</p><br/><p>There is no such thing as a free meal in the world. Although Lin Fan had relied on Elder Zheng\u2019s connections to get Zhang Long here, he couldn\u2019t just make Zhang Long do work for him for free.</p><br/><p>When Zhang Long heard this, he hastily waved his hand. \u201cMaster Lin, you are looking down on us. Although we are a business company, with charity, we would do whatever we can to help. If we take any of the profits and it is found out by the public, we would get flamed to death.</p><br/><p>What kind of joke was that?</p><br/><p>If they were to take any of the profit, not only would the netizens flame them. Even that old man, Elder Zheng, wouldn\u2019t forgive them.</p><br/><p>Although not much would happen, if he really wanted to punish them, he would have lots of methods to do so.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded, \u201cThank you very much then.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Long said with a smile, \u201cEveryone has a responsibility to do charitable deeds. Later on, I\u2019ll get someone to collect the children\u2019s artwork and bring them to Beijing to scan them onto the computer. A period of time will be needed but don\u2019t worry. I guarantee it\u2019ll be done within a month.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d Lin Fan nodded. Although a month was a little long, at least the matter would be resolved. The children\u2019s education was a significant matter. Currently, the Children\u2019s Welfare Institute had all the basic necessities but they were just lacking in education. If they could resolve this, then nothing would be an issue.</p><br/><p>Zhang Long instructed his workers, \u201cGo and collect the artworks. Don\u2019t damage them. Then immediately head back to Beijing and take care of this. I\u2019ll communicate with the development department and get them to develop a webpage for these artworks.</p><br/><p>Now that the plan had been settled, all that was left was for them to put in the work.</p><br/><p>Since Zhang Long was willing to help, Lin Fan was naturally very courteous towards him. \u201cChief Zhang, later on, why don\u2019t you stay for a meal? I have to thank you all properly for this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Long smiled, \u201cMaster Lin, I\u2019ll pass up on the meal. This kind of matter cannot be dragged on. It wouldn\u2019t be too late to have a meal after the task has been completed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said with a smile, \u201cAlright. Well, thank you for the trouble, Chief Zhang.\u201d</p><br/><p>Han Lu had been watching from the side all along. He never thought that Master Lin would think of such a plan.</p><br/><p>But he had to admire Master Lin. Such a plan might really work.</p><br/><p>Chief Zhang and the rest still had to register the names of the children. When displaying the artworks, they had to include the names and ages of the children who made them as well.</p><br/><p>They worked all the way until nighttime.</p><br/><p>Everything had been settled. Zhang Long and his men rushed back to Beijing overnight and didn\u2019t stay in Shanghai.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan had originally been thinking of bringing them out for a meal or even personally cooking for them. But he never thought Chief Zhang would be so professionally dedicated. They had left before even eating.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan had to give this kind of boss a thumbs up. Although it was partly because of Elder Zheng, he couldn\u2019t think that that was the only reason Chief Zhang helped them.</p><br/><p>With one look, he could tell that Chief Zhang was sincere and he wasn\u2019t doing it just because of Elder Zheng.</p><br/><p>Now that there was a solution to the Welfare Institute matter, Lin Fan finally let out a breath of relief. A troublesome matter had been taken care of.</p><br/><p>But now, he had to focus on teaching the children Chinese arts.</p><br/><p>He still had to rely on them to earn him Encyclopedic Points.</p><br/><p>Moreover, learning Chinese arts would be a great help to them. Becoming masters of Chinese arts would not be impossible for the children.</p></div>\n</div>"}

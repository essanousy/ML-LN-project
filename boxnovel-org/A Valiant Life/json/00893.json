Didn\u2019t my student tell you all?\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporter replied, \u201cHe has, but we just can\u2019t quite believe it, so I wanted to confirm it once more.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cThe prescription has been successfully developed. Moreover, it has 100% effectiveness. It can completely cure leukemia.\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporters were very excited. \u201cMaster Lin, does that mean it\u2019s effective regardless of whether it\u2019s mid-stage or late-stage leukemia?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded. \u201cYep, that\u2019s right. It is effective regardless. This prescription has been through testing and I can confirm that it is effective. I\u2019ll take responsibility for my own words.\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-2\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>The reporters felt like this was really a huge piece of news. It was so huge that it was terrifying.</p><br/><p>Master Lin was not a professional doctor but his medical skills were far superior to any doctor. Also, it wasn\u2019t just his medical skills that were brilliant. He was also valiant in other domains.</p><br/><p>The managers of the pharmaceutical companies were stammering. They were anxious to find out more.</p><br/><p>Director Chen went forward hurriedly. \u201cMaster Lin, where\u2019s the prescription then?\u201d</p><br/><p>He had dared to call Zhao Ming Qing directly by his name because they were both members of organizations and he had spoken as a leader in his organization. But to Master Lin, he dared not speak the same way.</p><br/><p>Although Master Lin did not belong to any organization, his abilities were shocking. Director Chen did not dare to offend him.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are?\u201d Lin Fan looked at him suspiciously, wondering who he was.</p><br/><p>Director Chen didn\u2019t feel any embarrassment. He quickly introduced himself, \u201cMaster Lin, I\u2019m Chen Fei from the Health Department. I\u2019m the Director. My department has discussed it and we wish for you to hand over the prescription to the Health Department so that we may be in charge of further arrangements. This will allow sufferers to receive more scientific treatments. What do you think?\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-3\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled in his heart. He hadn\u2019t expected that Director Chen would really come asking for it.</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry, I think that your method isn\u2019t very good,\u201d said Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Director Chen\u2019s expression changed slightly but he didn\u2019t just give up. \u201cMaster Lin, this is actually the best course of action. With us in charge, it can be distributed to a wider extent. And you don\u2019t have to worry. You would still be the owner of the medicine. But this medicine is just too important to everyone. After all, it concerns the well-being of countless individuals.\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, some of the managers of the pharmaceutical companies couldn\u2019t help but yell out boldly, \u201cMaster Lin, our company is willing to collaborate with you in distributing the medicine. You can provide the conditions. We\u2019ll agree to anything.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, choose our company. Our company is very sincere. Whatever you request, we will agree unconditionally.\u201d</p><br/><p>The people from the pharmaceutical companies were willing to offer so much in order to obtain the medicine. To them, if they really managed to obtain the medicine, they would have hit the jackpot.</p><br/><p>They might even be taking a step forward into the sphere of medicine.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat companies are you all from?\u201d When Director Chen heard those words, he glared at them furiously. \u201cWhat are you all trying to do? This concerns the well-being of countless people. Are you trying to make a profit from the sufferers?\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporters were filming this. To them, this moment was the climax of the news.</p><br/><p>The people from the pharmaceutical companies were cursing in their hearts.<em>F*ck, you\u2019re even eviler than us, taking a 40% commision. Otherwise, medicine wouldn\u2019t be so expensive!</em></p><div class=\"code-block code-block-4\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Lin Fan waved his hand. \u201cNo need for all this. We will not be collaborating with anyone regarding this medicine.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Director Chen was stunned. He hadn\u2019t thought that Master Lin would want to have the medicine all to himself. Then, his expression changed. \u201cMaster Lin, you can\u2019t do that. Our department will not approve of that.\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporters were a little shocked. They hadn\u2019t expected Master Lin to want full ownership of the medicine. The thought had crossed their minds before but they had felt that the probability was small.</p><br/><p>There were even some reporters who worshipped Master Lin and thought that Master Lin would never do something like that.</p><br/><p>Because to them, Master Lin was a very righteous man. Now that Lin Fan was saying that he wanted to have the ownership of medicine to himself, they thought that Master Lin must have been thinking of distributing the medicine at the lowest price possible.</p><br/><p>He definitely wouldn\u2019t raise the price to an absurd level.</p><br/><p>\u201cDirector Chen, this medicine belongs to me. Why would I need your approval to do what I want with it?\u201d Lin Fan looked at Director Chen with an unhappy look on his face. <em>Is this guy retarded?</em></p><br/><p>Director Chen resisted the fire in his heart as he said, \u201cMaster Lin, I hope you can understand the importance of this medicine to the vast number of sufferers in society. You can suggest whatever conditions you want but it is impossible for you to monopolize it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, are you retarded? When did I say that I want to monopolize it?\u201d Lin Fan said in a displeased tone.</p><br/><p>When Director Chen heard this, he couldn\u2019t help but smile. <em>It seems this Master Lin knows what\u2019s good for him after all. </em>Then, his voice became gentler.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, please trust us and hand the prescription over to us. Our department will definitely manage it well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-5\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>At that moment. A series of gasps of shock resounded.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, your Weibo\u2026\u201d One of the reporters was dumbfounded. He had just taken a look at his Weibo and to his surprise, he saw something unthinkable on Master Lin\u2019s Weibo.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled. \u201cSo you\u2019ve realized.\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporter was startled. \u201cMaster Lin, you posted the prescription on Weibo?\u201d</p><br/><p>When those words were spoken, the whole place was shocked.</p><br/><p>Everyone took out their phones in a hurry, opened Weibo, and looked at Master Lin\u2019s Weibo page. With one look, they were completely dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan saw that everyone was looking at their phones and couldn\u2019t help but smile as he said, \u201cYup, I said that I won\u2019t collaborate with anyone. This prescription was developed by me. And the only purpose of this prescription is to let people recover their health and experience the world in a healthy state.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis prescription is Chinese medicine. It\u2019s divided into three steps. The medicinal ingredients are easy to buy too as the price isn\u2019t high. You can buy all of it for $2000 and you\u2019d be able to brew it at home by yourself. What\u2019s the point of manufacturing it in a factory? Am I right?\u201d Lin Fan said with a grin.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Director Chen was looking at Weibo. He hadn\u2019t expected this guy to really publicize the prescription.</p><br/><p>At that moment, he was dumbfounded. His whole body was stunned.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-6\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>The reporters and the rest had never expected Master Lin to publicize the prescription either. After all, if it had been anyone else, this could not possibly have happened.</p><br/><p>Everyone has greed. Especially since this prescription was a priceless treasure, if managed properly, it could bring in a fortune.</p><br/><p>But now, Master Lin had freely publicized the prescription. This, to them, was unimaginable.</p><br/><p>Master Lin looked at the stupefied managers of the pharmaceutical companies and Director Chen and said, \u201cAlright, there\u2019s nothing more to see here. Disperse then. My disciple and I have to go back and rest. This took us a few days and we haven\u2019t even had a good sleep yet. I\u2019m so tired!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, Director Chen, go back and tell the dear leaders that they don\u2019t have to trouble themselves over this. I\u2019ve already publicized the prescription. The sufferers will be able to buy and brew their own medicine and recover from their illness. No need to thank me, I\u2019m just helping you to take out some of the trouble. After all, if you guys have to be in charge of this, it would be a waste of time and manpower. It just isn\u2019t worth it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Reporters: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Pharmaceutical companies: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Chen: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

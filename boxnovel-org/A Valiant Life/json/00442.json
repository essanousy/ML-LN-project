Furthermore, there was an untold story between her brother-in-law and her.</p><br/><p>She had been a normal villager but she gradually became in power. She had gone through a lot of difficulties to reach her current status.</p><br/><p>Also, she was extremely good at analyzing things and she could find out about things just by observing.</p><br/><p>She could tell that something had happened by looking at her brother-in-law\u2019s face. Her brother-in-law was stunned. It wasn\u2019t because the other party was extremely rich; her brother-in-law wouldn\u2019t be fearful of that. That could only mean that the other party was extremely powerful and influential.</p><br/><p>The man standing at the entrance had taken out a small book and she didn\u2019t know what it was but after her brother-in-law saw it, he looked terrible. It was definitely something that he was fearful of.</p><br/><p>Lil\u2019 Wang hated things like this. After being with Elder Zheng for so long, he knew that this was something Elder Zheng hated the most too. That was when the younger generation played dirty tricks based on connections which were established by the older generations.</p><br/><p>Master Lin was still reprimanding Young Master Jiang and he felt that it was a job well done.</p><br/><p>\u201cI told you to stand straight. Do you understand what that means?\u201d Lil\u2019 Wang glared at Jin Sheng Wen and said.</p><br/><p>Jin Sheng Wen was one of the most influential people in Beijing and he hadn\u2019t been commanded like that before. However, he couldn\u2019t do anything because the backing of the person in front of him was ten or even a hundred times more powerful than him.</p><br/><p>Then, Jin Sheng Wen stood there firmly and looked more serious than ever.</p><br/><p>However, he was extremely curious about the identity of the man inside to have such a strong backing. For someone to have such a strong backing in Beijing, he had to be extremely well-known.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Young Master Jiang and the others were part of the younger generation in Beijing and they definitely didn\u2019t know who these people were. However, the current situation was that Young Master Jiang was the one being reprimanded. It showed how ignorant he was.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Wen, what are you doing? Why aren\u2019t you going inside to save Young Master Jiang?\u201d Young Master Zhao and the others were anxious. Something had happened in Brother Wen\u2019s territory but he wasn\u2019t doing anything about it. What exactly was happening?</p><br/><p>Sister Yan silently nudged Young Master Zhao and the others and shook her head. She wanted them to not ask too many questions. She already understood what was happening. Her brother-in-law was behaving himself because he couldn\u2019t afford to offend the person inside.</p><br/><p>Young Master Zhao and the others were frequent guests of Tian Yun Villa. Naturally, she couldn\u2019t let them be involved in this.</p><br/><p>Young Master Zhao and the others weren\u2019t fools. They gradually knew what was happening after looking at how the situation had changed.</p><br/><p>However, it was impossible. They hadn\u2019t even recognized the person earlier. How powerful could he be? He had managed to stop everyone. Even Jin Sheng Wen was standing there and could do nothing about it.</p><br/><p>In the private room.</p><br/><p>\u201cJin Sheng Wen, f*ck your mom. I\u2019m having trouble in your territory and you\u2019re not even coming in. Remember this. I\u2019ll definitely teach you a lesson!\u201d Young Master Jiang shouted from the private room.</p><br/><p>He was indeed furious. He hadn\u2019t expected Jin Sheng Wen to treat him like this.</p><br/><p>However, he knew that based on his own ability, he couldn\u2019t do anything to Jin Sheng Wen. However, he was furious and scolding Jin Sheng Wen was all he could do.</p><br/><p>Jin Sheng Wen stood there motionlessly and expressionlessly. He couldn\u2019t get involved in this and he didn\u2019t want to be involved at all. If the identity of the other party was true, then he wouldn\u2019t be capable of going against him at all.</p><br/><p>Going against people like him would definitely cause Jin Sheng Wen to lose his entire empire in a night and he might even end up in jail and lose all his possessions. His years of hard work would disappear overnight.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was furious and he had not even vented all his anger yet. He looked at Young Master Jiang who was crippled on the ground and he kicked him aside. Then, he went out. Young Master Jiang was the mastermind but the others could forget about running away as well.</p><br/><p>Lil\u2019 Wang moved aside. \u201cMaster Lin, is it resolved?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved his hand. \u201cNo. It will be soon though.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Yun Gang quickly went forward when he saw Master Lin. He was amazed by what he saw. He understood that Master Lin was an extraordinary person.</p><br/><p>The person standing at the door was Master Lin\u2019s acquaintance and he had taken out something that frightened Jin Sheng Wen so much that he stood still.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin,\u201d Wu Yun Gang wanted to tell him something but was interrupted by Lin Fan. \u201cTake good care of Ming Yang, leave this to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, he looked at Young Master Zhao and the others. He pointed and said, \u201cAll of you, come in now.\u201d</p><br/><p>The three of them glanced at each other and thought of how miserable Young Master Jiang looked. Then, they were extremely anxious and didn\u2019t dare to enter.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan immediately dragged two of them by the neck into the private room. When Young Master Ma saw that, he quickly ran away.</p><br/><p>However, Lin Fan didn\u2019t notice that at all.</p><br/><p>When Young Master Zhao and Young Master Huang entered the private room and saw the state of Young Master Jiang, they were trembling in fear. They wondered how much he had tortured Young Master Jiang for him to end up like this. The room was filthy; it was filled with alcohol and vomit.</p><br/><p>The two of them stood there and looked at each other in fear.</p><br/><p>\u201cKneel down,\u201d Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>Young Master Zhao and Young Master Huang swallowed their saliva forcefully. They realized that the person in front of them looked extremely fierce and they didn\u2019t dare to go against him. They immediately kneeled down.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan immediately placed two bottles of wine in front of the two of them and pointed. \u201cDrink, I\u2019m toasting the both of you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Young Master Zhao raised his head and said weakly, \u201cIt\u2019ll kill us.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDrink,\u201d Lin Fan stood up and said sternly, \u201cIt must have felt great bullying my friend, right? Now, it\u2019s my turn to bully all of you. Drink and remember that nobody gets to reject the toast of Lin Fan.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two of them looked at each other and didn\u2019t drink it. \u201cDon\u2019t go overboard, we\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, since you don\u2019t want to drink, I\u2019ll feed the both of you. But I wonder if you will end up like him,\u201d Lin Fan said. He didn\u2019t want to let go of anyone who bullied Wang Ming Yang.</p><br/><p>He would do everything it took to return the favor, even if it was ten or a hundred times worse.</p><br/><p>That was Lin Fan\u2019s way of protecting his friends.</p><br/><p>The others could try to convince him to not do anything but it didn\u2019t matter who tried to beg him. He wouldn\u2019t let go of anyone that bullied his friends.</p><br/><p>Young Master Zhao and Young Master Huang were helpless. Although they weren\u2019t the most powerful individuals in Beijing, they could be said to be lawless youngsters. If someone were to tell them that they\u2019d encounter such a situation, they probably wouldn\u2019t believe it.</p><br/><p>They definitely would never believe that.</p><br/><p>However, that was exactly what was happening and they had to give in.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan took a bottle of wine and walked out. \u201cRemember, finish every single drop and if I find out that you guys poured any of it away, I\u2019ll prepare another bottle for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two of them looked at Lin Fan and they were shocked.</p><br/><p>Their voices started to tremble, \u201cWe won\u2019t, we won\u2019t\u2026\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

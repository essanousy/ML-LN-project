Even if they wanted to, they wouldn't have dared.</p><br/><p>Li Shi Kun said, \"I heard from this little comrade that the flow of people in Cloud Street has increased by two hundred percent and it has a lot to do with your shop.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. \"You flatter me. How could I be so capable?\"</p><br/><p>A compliment, followed by a modest remark.</p><br/><p>A shop owners inside the queue excitedly exclaimed.</p><br/><p>\"That's the work of the Little Boss. If it wasn't for the Little Boss, Cloud Street would never have become so lively.\"</p><br/><p>\"Everyone, don't you agree?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yeah! We're all grateful for Little Boss.\"</p><br/><p>\"In the past, not many people came to our Cloud Street but ever since Little Boss came, this place has become lively as heck.\"</p><br/><p>\"Little Boss is the gem that brings fortune to our Cloud Street. Wherever Little Boss goes next time, we will follow.\"</p><br/><p>\"That's right\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Li Shi Kun was speechless after hearing all the townsfolk's praise. It was a little too exaggerated, so much so that it was scary.</p><br/><p>Li Shi Kun had never thought that this young man would be so well-liked. He had never seen something like this. Then, he looked at the scallion pancake. It was dazzlingly golden and it even gave off an overwhelming fragrance.</p><br/><p>Although he was a man of high status, he was still human. The fragrance instantly ensnared him.</p><br/><p>This aroma. It's mesmerizing.</p><br/><p>Li Shi Kun cleared his throat. \"Little Boss, how much for a serving of this?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. \"Fifty.\"</p><br/><p>Li Shi Kun nodded, then took out fifty dollars from his pocket. \"Give me one to try. This aroma is exceptional.\"</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang, who had been standing at the side all along, stepped forward then. When he saw that there was a group of people, he was startled. When Li Shi Kun saw Wang Ming Yang, he smiled. \"Chief Wang, why are you here?\"</p><br/><p>\"This shop is run by a brother of mine. It just finished its renovation so I brought people here to celebrate.\" Wang Ming Yang had never thought that Li Shi Kun would be here to inspect the street.</p><br/><p>Although Wang Ming Yang wasn't the wealthiest man in Shanghai, he was a very wealthy man for his age and he had been named as one of the top ten young entrepreneurs in the past.</p><br/><p>As a leader, Li Shi Kun paid close attention to his people, even commoners. As for a young man like Wang Ming Yang who had relied on his own ability to become successful, Li Shi Kun obviously had a strong impression of him.</p><br/><p>Zhang Ming stepped forward at that moment. He didn't recognize Wang Ming Yang, but since even the leader knew him, he couldn't have been just a simple man. Zhang Ming smiled and said, \"Chief Wang, with friends like you around, Cloud Street is very fortunate. Having increased flow of people is something worth celebrating for the private firms as well as the townsfolk.\"</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang then said proudly, \"Well, of course. My brother is an extraordinary person.\"</p><br/><p>Li Shi Kun smiled, \"Little Boss, here's fifty. Give me a serving so I can have a good taste.\"</p><br/><p>The surrounding townsfolk smiled as they looked at this scene. If it was anyone else, they would never have let them cut the queue. But this was a leader, so they thought it was better to just let it be.</p><br/><p>The way they saw it, the Little Boss surely wouldn't reject him. It was the perfect opportunity to get on the leader's good side. Moreover, it was a real high-ranking leader.</p><br/><p>But the next second, they were all stunned.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled as he said, \"I'm sorry, I treat everyone equally. Everyone has to queue. Furthermore, today, I'm rewarding to all the townsfolk for their support towards me. If the rule were to be broken today, those townsfolk wouldn't be happy.</p><br/><p>Zhang Ming was stunned. He had no expected that Lin Fan would say something like that.</p><br/><p>All those lower-ranked leaders just stared blankly. This was an opportunity that most people wouldn't get even if they begged for it, yet this kid actually told the leader to queue up. What kind of guts did he have?</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang silently gave Lin Fan his praise.</p><br/><p>F*cking awesome!</p><br/><p>That's the person that I, Wang Ming Yang, respect!</p><br/><p>\"My apologies, leader. This brother of mine only judges by reason, not by person. He doesn't have any bad intentions,\" said Wang Ming Yang.</p><br/><p>Li Shi Kun laughed, \"No worries, no worries. This is indeed very fair. You can't break a rule just because of me. I'll queue, I'll definitely queue. But there's no hurry, I'll go take a look further in front first. I'll come back later to have a good taste.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. \"Thank you for your understanding, leader. I guarantee you'll find queuing worth your while.\"</p><br/><p>\"Alright.\" Li Shi Kun smiled cheerily, then said to Zhang Ming, \"Shops like these, you have to assist them as much as possible in future. If they face any challenges, you have to help to solve them as soon as possible, alright?\"</p><br/><p>Zhang Ming nodded. \"Alright. We've always put the people first. Whenever a business faced any problems, we've always helped them as much as we could.\"</p><br/><p>Li Shi Kun nodded, then smiled. \"Then let's not disturb Little Boss any longer.\"</p><br/><p>The leaders went forward with their inspection.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang said, \"Brother, I really have to give credit to you. That was a leader, the third-in-charge!\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan grinned. \"It doesn't matter to me. I don't want anything from him, nor does he want anything from me. I must be fair to everyone, don't you think so?\"</p><br/><p>\"That is very sensible. I have no arguments,\" said Wang Ming Yang with a smile.</p><br/><p>The queuing townsfolk were once again in awe of Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>\"F*cking awesome, Little Boss!\"</p><br/><p>\"There's nothing else to say other than f*cking awesome.\"</p><br/><p>\"That's what I like about Little Boss. He's fair to everyone and doesn't treat anyone differently.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved his hand. \"That's enough. If you keep praising me, I'm going to start floating in heaven. Then, no one will make scallion pancakes for you guys.\"</p><br/><p>The townsfolk laughed cheerily. Everything was peaceful and Little Boss made them even happier.</p><br/><p>The queue didn't get any shorter. In fact, it gradually grew even longer.</p><br/><p>Each piece of scallion pancake made the townsfolk feel as if they had been reborn. One after another, strange noises that made people feel awkward rang out from Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>However, the crowd didn't look at them with judgemental eyes because they knew exactly what kind of devilish powers Little Boss's scallion pancakes possessed. They were simply terrifying.</p><br/><p>From afar, Li Shi Kun was inspecting when he heard the noises. He couldn't help but turn his head and look over curiously.</p><br/><p>Chu Yuan said, \"Leader, Master Lin's scallion pancakes have the demonic powers to make one unable to resist it. After finishing it, one will feel his spirit being released and that expression is something that will just emerge unknowingly.\"</p><br/><p>Li Shi Kun said in shock, \"It's that mystical?\"</p><br/><p>Zhang Ming was shocked too. \"Could there be some kind of problem in those scallion pancakes?\"</p><br/><p>It was normal to think that there was some kind of problem. People who didn't understand the situation well would naturally think that there were ghosts or spirits involved.</p><br/><p>Chu Yuan waved his hand. \"There are no problems. The relevant departments have all tested the scallion pancakes before. There are no added ingredients. It can be said that this is all because of Master Lin's technique. No one else can make scallion pancakes like his.\"</p><br/><p>Li Shi Kun was getting a little excited. \"I'm getting the urge to try those scallion pancakes sooner. I really want to find out just how this taste that you're describing is like.\"</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>After the inspection, they made their way back but the length of the queue hadn't changed.</p><br/><p>However, some of the townsfolk gave way to Li Shi Kun. They wanted to let him have a taste. To them, the leader couldn't possibly have the time to come and try the scallion pancakes everyday, but they were different. They could queue everyday if they wanted to.</p><br/><p>Li Shi Kun looked at the scallion pancake in his hands, then sniffed it. Waves of fragrance rushed into his nostrils and filled his nose. Then, he couldn't take it any longer and took a bite.</p><br/><p>*Crunch*</p><br/><p>Tasting Master Lin's scallion pancake for the first time, Li Shi Kun hadn't been prepared. When he bit in\u2026</p><br/><p>The flavors instantly exploded in his mouth, tantalizing his taste buds.</p><br/><p>A ridiculous exaggerated expression emerged on his face.</p><br/><p>*ka-cha*</p><br/><p>Chu Yuan captured the moment on his camera, then he kept silent.</p><br/><p>A classic expression. Not bad at all.</p><br/><p>...</p><br/>\n</div>"}

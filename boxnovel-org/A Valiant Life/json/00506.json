His bathhouse had been reborn and business was suddenly booming. He had been caught unprepared.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need to thank me. We are all neighbors and we should help each other,\u201d said Lin Fan calmly with a wave of his hand. Then, he smiled, \u201cHowever, don\u2019t think about that kind of stuff anymore in future. I come here to bathe occasionally as well. If you do those things, it\u2019ll be too inconvenient.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zeng Wei nodded, \u201cRight, right. I won\u2019t. I definitely won\u2019t.\u201d</p><br/><p>The next day!</p><br/><p>The news blew up once more.</p><br/><p>The experienced reporters had once again dug out the important news.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, that awesome back-scrubbing Big Bro is actually Master Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho\u2019s Master Lin?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDid your family just subscribe to an internet connection? To not even know Master Lin, where on earth have you been? Master Lin is the Godly Doctor, do you know now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you say so earlier? Of course, I know about the Godly Doctor. He\u2019s a f*cking incredible individual. But that\u2019s not quite right. Why would the Godly Doctor be a back-scrubbing Little Bro?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know sh*t. That\u2019s called being versatile. Amazing people are all versatile. So what if he\u2019s a back-scrubber? Even if he becomes a toilet cleaner, I wouldn\u2019t find it strange.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat makes sense.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan spread open his arms. \u201cCome\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The surrounding shop owners stared at Little Boss with their mouths gaping. Could there be something wrong with his brain?</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan and Fraud Tian covered their faces. Did he not take his medicines that day? Why was he acting like a kid?</p><br/><p>But nobody knew that Lin Fan was hearing the most beautiful sound.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe eleventh task has been completed. Encyclopedic Points will be increased by 20.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnlocking the twelfth page of knowledge. For it is the twelfth page of knowledge, a specialty of someone near the host will not be chosen.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wait a minute\u2026</p><br/><p>That\u2019s not right.</p><br/><p>Was the Encyclopedia broken? Why was it different from before?</p><br/><p>Why wasn\u2019t it following its usual routine?</p><br/><p>\u201cDoes the host think that he has grasped the crux of the Encyclopedia\u2019s knowledge unlocking? Actually, you are wrong. The Encyclopedia has the ability to recover from bugs.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSelecting from the classes of knowledge that the host has previously temporarily borrowed using Encyclopedic Points.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe host has only borrowed two classes of knowledge before. Unlocking the sub-class of the computer major class of knowledge: Computer Hacking.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTask: To become the revered Master Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReward: Encyclopedic points +20 and the ability to unlock the thirteenth page of knowledge.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNotice: Since it is a sub-class of knowledge, there is no need to be involved in the profession.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCurrent Encyclopedic Points: 2\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan stood at the same spot, silently gazing into the sky.</p><br/><p>Was this Encyclopedia retarded?</p><br/><p>\u201cAhh, thank god. Being kind-hearted really reaps rewards. Finally, a reliable class of knowledge. What kind of society are we in right now? It\u2019s the era of Internet information! I\u2019ve always been computer illiterate but now, I\u2019ve become a god. This is really a joyous occasion! If the Encyclopedia could be like this from now on, that would really be great,\u201d Lin Fan celebrated in his heart.</p><br/><p>Good man!</p><br/><p>Good Encyclopedia.</p><br/><p>Very humane.</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe!\u201d Lin Fan stood there laughing. He was laughing very happily.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian mumbled, \u201cSomething must have gone wrong with this kid. Who would just make such a silly laugh in front of his shop in broad daylight for no reason?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan had a worried look on her face as she took out her phone and searched for the best psychiatrist. \u201cWhen we have the time, let\u2019s bring him to see a psychiatrist.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang said in a hurt tone, \u201cWhat has happened to my idol\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian gathered his courage and asked, \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan regained his senses. He said innocently, \u201cI\u2019m okay. I\u2019m perfectly fine. I\u2019m just happy. Fraud, your performance has been pretty good lately. This month, your salary will be increased by a hundred.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Fraud Tian heard that, he was filled with gratitude. \u201cAh, Brother Lin, you are really too good to me. You\u2019re my idol!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. Just a hundred dollars and he managed to buy someone\u2019s heart. How fantastic.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Fraud Tian turned around and nodded at everyone. His meaning was clear. There was really a problem with Lin Fan. And it wasn\u2019t a light problem.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was delighted. He didn\u2019t expect to obtain such a great class of knowledge for the twelfth page. With a computer in his hand, the world would be within his grasps.</p><br/><p>But wait a moment\u2026</p><br/><p>The task was once again to \u2018become the revered Master Lin\u2019 and there was an issue with that.</p><br/><p>Hacking experts always remained in the shadows and did not reveal themselves. Then, no one would know who he was. If he was exposed, that would be bad.</p><br/><p>D*mn, this is problematic.</p><br/><p>But it didn\u2019t matter. There was no rush at the moment.</p><br/><p>After all, it wasn\u2019t a compulsory task. He could take it slowly. Recently, to complete the back-scrubbing task, he had been doing things in a rush. How could a quiet and calm person like him allow life to be at such a quick pace? Of course, he had to slow it down and take things leisurely.</p><br/><p>A while later.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan went to a shop nearby to buy a computer. As a computer god, how could he not have a computer?</p><br/><p>In the shop.</p><br/><p>The computer seller, Lil\u2019 Wang, was just assembling a computer. Lin Fan said, \u201cLil\u2019 Wang, is this computer okay? Will it hang?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lil\u2019 Wang smiled, \u201cLittle Boss, you\u2019re worrying even though I\u2019m the one selling it? If I assemble this computer for someone else, it would cost twelve thousand but for you, it\u2019s just eight thousand. That\u2019s already a very good price. The installations in this computer are great. Even running a few games at the same time wouldn\u2019t be an issue.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded, \u201cAlright then, I only want a good one, not a lousy one. But if it\u2019s twelve thousand, then I\u2019ll pay twelve thousand. You run a shop and you need to earn money. Otherwise, what\u2019s the point of running a shop?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lil\u2019 Wang was a young man and he admired Lin Fan greatly. Especially because opening a shop on Cloud Street felt very safe, the neighbors had a very good relationship with each other.</p><br/><p>There were even many neighbors who wanted to introduce girlfriends to Lil\u2019 Wang. This made him very shy.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian and the rest were discussing.</p><br/><p>\u201cSomething\u2019s wrong. Something\u2019s very wrong. There\u2019s definitely something wrong with the kid today.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang nodded, \u201cI feel that way too. Little Boss usually doesn\u2019t really play computer games but now he spends such a large sum to buy a computer, how could there not be an issue?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan said worriedly, \u201cCould it be that he\u2019s been under too much stress lately and it\u2019s causing him to be nervous?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Tian He shook his head, \u201cI don\u2019t think so. Perhaps he\u2019s just getting a computer for entertainment and relaxation.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI hope so.\u201d</p><br/><p>After installing the computer, Lin Fan delightedly tried using it. It felt pretty good.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis computer is my personal property. I won\u2019t lend it to any of you to play with it,\u201d Lin Fan put a passcode on the computer and said with a smile.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian waved his hand. \u201cWe won\u2019t play with it. We won\u2019t even touch it. As long as you\u2019re happy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, right\u2026\u201d Zhao Zhong Yang realized that there was something very wrong with Little Boss and felt a little worried as well.</p><br/><p>A few days passed quickly and the twelfth page of knowledge hadn\u2019t been used much yet. However, Lin Fan wasn\u2019t anxious. He was thinking about something.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing had asked him to write Chinese medicine teaching materials. It was a significant matter to Zhao Ming Qing as well as Lin Fan. It was meant to teach people who were just beginning to learn Chinese medicine. If he wasn\u2019t serious when writing it and problems occur, it would be troublesome.</p><br/><p>Sitting in front of the table, Lin Fan held a pen and was deep in thought.</p><br/><p>He was going through the Encyclopedia\u2019s Chinese medical knowledge in his mind. At the same time, he was arranging all the beginners\u2019 knowledge systematically in his heart.</p><br/><p>After thinking for a while, he arrived at the first draft plan.</p><br/><p>Chinese Medicine Entry-level Books:</p><br/><p>\u2018Foundational Chinese Medicine\u2019, \u2018Chinese Medicine Diagnosis Studies\u2019, \u2018Chinese Medical Studies\u2019, \u2018Prescription Studies\u2019 These were the four beginner-level books.</p><br/><p>With a rough idea, he knew how he should arrange the knowledge.</p><br/><p>He would organize these four beginner-level books, adding in his own opinions, presented in an easy-to-understand manner for beginners.</p><br/><p>If he made the books profound and hard to understand just to show off his knowledge, that wouldn\u2019t be advantageous.</p><br/><p>He would make the books simpler, such that as long as the reader focused while reading it, it would be rewarding.</p><br/><p>To Chinese doctors, this would be a great help and to Lin Fan, there was much to gain from this as well. From that day onwards, he wouldn\u2019t have to be afraid of not having enough Encyclopedic Points.</p></div>\n</div>"}

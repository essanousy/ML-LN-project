How can you smell something like that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI feel like Zhao Li is going to take her revenge. This Chen Rui An is really stupid. He actually said so bluntly that he admired Master Lin. Isn\u2019t he just drawing hate to himself?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah! Master Lin has never flashed his light before. If Master Lin doesn\u2019t flash his light, probably only Hao Jian Yang would flash the light. No matter what, Zhao Li and Liu Ying Dong will definitely not do it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is this scheming b*tch trying to do now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2019s going to cause trouble. She\u2019s going to cause trouble for sure.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked curiously at Zhao Li, wondering what this woman was going to do. However, judging by her expression, she definitely had bad intentions.</p><br/><p>Zhao Li cleared her throat. \u201cChen Rui An, can I ask you something?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Rui An nodded. Naturally, he recognized Zhao Li because, at the singing competition that he participated in two years ago, Zhao Li had been one of the judges. His heart felt a little uneasy.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, Teacher Zhao.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Li said, \u201cI keep feeling as if I recognize you. Did you participate in \u2018Heavenly Male Voice\u2019 two years ago?\u201d</p><br/><p>Indeed, after Zhao Li said this, Chen Rui An felt a huge impact in his heart. Those unhappy memories had been dredged up.</p><br/><p>Chen Rui An\u2019s parents were watching their son on stage. At this instant, their fists were tightly clenched and their hearts were filled with anxiety. They knew the reason that their son had been depressed for two years but they hadn\u2019t expected anyone else to still remember it. They started feeling worried for their son.</p><br/><p>Chen Rui An was silent for a moment before he nodded, \u201cYes, I didn\u2019t think that Teacher Zhao would still remember me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Li pointed at her head and smiled, \u201cMy memory is very good.\u201d Then, she took a glance at Lin Fan before saying in a rather harsh tone, \u201cIf it\u2019s you, then I\u2019m sorry. You\u2019re not qualified to stand on this stage.\u201d</p><br/><p>Uproar!</p><br/><p>When those words were said, everyone at the scene was dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>What kind of situation was this?</p><br/><p>Where was this leading to?</p><br/><p>He hadn\u2019t even sung a single word and she was already telling him to get off the stage. Moreover, her tone was so serious. To them, it seemed a little ridiculous.</p><br/><p>The viewers who were watching the live broadcast started discussing maniacally.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe has started making her move as expected.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is a show of strength to Master Lin. She\u2019s taking her revenge for the previous day\u2019s incident.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy does it feel exactly the same as yesterday? What is the reason behind this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Let\u2019s wait for an explanation.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Rui An, who was on the stage, had a very uncomfortable look on his face. The blow to his heart was great and he had an urge to cry.</p><br/><p>He had persevered through everything in order to come up on stage but he had never expected to be received with such words.</p><br/><p>He had already forgotten about the past incidents and he didn\u2019t want to recall them. He wanted even less to have to explain himself.</p><br/><p>What was past was past and he just wanted to welcome a new life.</p><br/><p>Chen Rui An\u2019s hands, which were holding the microphone, started to tremble. \u201cTeacher Zhao, please give me one more chance.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Li didn\u2019t reply immediately. She looked at Lin Fan with a challenging gaze. Then, she said, \u201cSorry, I can\u2019t give you this opportunity. What you have done in the past will leave a stain on the rest of your life.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Rui An was at a loss. He really didn\u2019t know what to do anymore. If he tried to explain himself, who would believe him?</p><br/><p>Moreover, he really didn\u2019t want to recall those past happenings.</p><br/><p>At this moment, he suddenly raised his head and looked at Lin Fan. He never thought that Teacher Lin would speak up for him at this moment.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan let out a smile. \u201cTeacher Zhao, if you\u2019re talking about this stain on his life, you should at least give a reason.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Li stayed very calm. She wasn\u2019t anxious at all. She appeared to have something up her sleeve.</p><br/><p>\u201cI think everyone wants to know what this contestant has done in the past. Since it\u2019s like this, let me tell you all. This contestant, Chen Rui An, participated in \u2018Heavenly Male Voice\u2019 two years ago. During the finals, he stole the other contestant\u2019s original song and it was discovered by Teacher Ying Jin. In the end, he refused to admit his act of theft and was disqualified from the finals. I think if any of our audience has watched that competition, you would still have some memory of this. Otherwise, you can do a search on the Internet and you would be able to find out about this.\u201d</p><br/><p>After saying this, the place erupted in an uproar once more.</p><br/><p>Some of the audience immediately took out their phones to search it up.</p><br/><p>Although it was from two years ago, the Internet still had some information about it.</p><br/><p>At this moment, many members of the audience started looking at Chen Rui An and whispering amongst themselves. This made Chen Rui An very uneasy. He lowered his head and closed his eyes. It had been the other contestant who had stolen his original song. However, at this moment, he felt as if he was carrying some kind of unspeakable sin on his shoulders.</p><br/><p>Chen Rui An\u2019s parents were heartbroken as they looked at their son on stage. They wanted to go up on stage to take their son away but they resisted this urge.</p><br/><p>Zhao Li said, \u201cIt\u2019s because of this that I don\u2019t think he has the right to stand on this stage. Stealing someone else\u2019s song during the finals of a competition is unforgivable.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at Chen Rui An, then at Zhao Li. \u201cOh, Teacher Zhao, how did Ying Jin find out about this back then?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Li smiled, \u201cBecause Sister Ying decided the song\u2019s tempo back then. She\u2019s considered one of the composers of the song.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems like that contestant had an exceptional relationship with Ying Jin,\u201d said Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not exactly the case. It\u2019s just that Sister Ying is kindhearted. She saw a good song and she was delighted, so she decided to take a look at it,\u201d said Zhao Li. Then, she looked at Chen Rui An. \u201cAlright, you can get off the stage now. Tell the next contestant to come up.\u201d</p><br/><p>The audience started crying out.</p><br/><p>\u201cGo away.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGo away.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cScram off!\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Rui An lowered his head. His legs felt like they were made of lead and they were incomparably heavy. Hearing the sounds from the audience, he was really at a loss. His heart was being tormented.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026I\u2026\u201d He wanted to say something but he had no idea how to say it.</p><br/><p>But at that moment, Chen Rui An looked up at Teacher Lin in disbelief. He had not expected that at this moment, Master Lin would speak up.</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone, quieten down now,\u201d Lin Fan held the microphone in his hand and said in a calm and steady voice.</p><br/><p>The audience all quietened down and listened closely.</p><br/><p>Then, Lin Fan looked at Zhao Li and said helplessly, \u201cTeacher Zhao, as a public figure and a mentor, you\u2019re really too much of a disappointment.\u201d</p><br/><p>When he said this, the whole place was shocked.</p><br/><p>Zhao Li pointed at Lin Fan in disbelief. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan opened his mouth once again, \u201cI\u2019m saying, why is a woman like you so petty? You\u2019re a public figure and a mentor. How can you be so petty?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s not talk about whether that incident was true or not. Two years have already passed, why can\u2019t you give this man another chance?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you have to bite onto his past and make him leave the stage? To me, for this kid to have the guts to come up on stage again, it is truly brilliant.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho doesn\u2019t make mistakes? If you label him for the rest of his life for one mistake, that isn\u2019t fair. Hence, I hope that Teacher Zhao will open up your narrow mind a little. Only so would you be suitable as a mentor.\u201d Then, he looked over to the audience.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you all think that he should be given a chance? And don\u2019t you think that we shouldn\u2019t be so petty?\u201d</p><br/><p>The members of the audience looked at each other.</p><br/><p>\u201cI think that we should do that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. Everyone makes mistakes. It\u2019s already been two years and that Zhao Li is still bearing it in her heart. That\u2019s too petty.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin is right. He should be given another chance.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The opinions of the audience had been influenced by Lin Fan once again.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, when Zhao Li heard the audience say that she was petty, she became so furious that she nearly fainted.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

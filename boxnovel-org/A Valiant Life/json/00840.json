If it was any other time, he would have drunk until the end but now, it wasn\u2019t the time to drink to one\u2019s heart\u2019s content.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, let\u2019s not keep drinking for now. Let\u2019s talk.\u201d</p><br/><p>*clatter*</p><br/><p>As Godfather Liu finished saying this, Lin Fan fiercely slammed the winning cup onto the table. How could the glass wine cup be slammed like that? The bottom of the cup instantly cracked. The place was momentarily filled with awkwardness.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at Godfather Liu. With his face slightly red and a little displeased, he said, \u201cGodfather Liu, are you not giving me any face?\u201d</p><br/><p>Godfather Liu was startled. Then, he asked doubtfully, \u201cMaster Lin, why do you say that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou guys called me over for dinner tonight. I thought that you two seemed like pretty good people so I wanted to get to know you two. Now, you don\u2019t even want to drink with me. I\u2019m haven\u2019t even drunk to my heart\u2019s content yet. That means you\u2019re not giving me any face. Why should I continue drinking with you then?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan stood up and acted as if he was about to leave.</p><br/><p>Godfather Qin stood up and hastily tried to mediate things, \u201cDon\u2019t be agitated. That\u2019s not what Lil\u2019 Liu means. Today, we have to let Master Lin drink to his heart\u2019s content. Lil\u2019 Liu, what are you doing? Hurry up and get a new wine cup for Master Lin. If there\u2019s anything to talk about, we\u2019ll talk later. We have to accompany Master Lin until he is satisfied.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, please don\u2019t mind what I said. I was just saying that casually. Come, let\u2019s keep drinking.\u201d Godfather Liu was all smiles. He quickly brought over a new wine cup and filled it up for Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan took a side glance at Godfather Liu, looking a little displeased. Then, he picked up the wine cup and gulped it down in one go. He filled the cup and drank it twice more before putting the cup down. \u201cIn Shanghai, if you do that, you\u2019ll cause others to be very upset. Now that I\u2019ve drunk three cups, what are you going to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Godfather Liu was stunned. Are the men in Shanghai so rash? Drinking three cups in one go doesn\u2019t seem quite right.</p><br/><p>However, looking at Master Lin\u2019s expression, it seemed that if he didn\u2019t drink, there was no way they could discuss things.</p><br/><p><em>Forget it. Since we\u2019re all drinking white wine, it\u2019s not like he\u2019s taking advantage of me. How could I be afraid?</em></p><br/><p>He drank!</p><br/><p>In the broadcast room.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck! This is way too rash. Master Lin can really drink!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is touching. Master Lin is putting his life on the line to get them to say the truth.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBrothers, if Master Lin broadcasts this like that, will the opposition discover if?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, discover my a*s. This is just a broadcasting platform. Who else aside from a small number of people would know about this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Seeing Godfather Liu drink three cups in a row, Lin Fan let out a smile. He placed one hand on Godfather Liu\u2019s shoulder. \u201cWell done, that\u2019s more like it. Let\u2019s go, Godfather Liu, let\u2019s keep going. Later on, we\u2019ll go to the bathhouse together. After we\u2019ve visited the prostitutes together, our feelings will become deeper.\u201d</p><br/><p>Godfather Liu smiled, \u201cOkay, okay. But prostitutes are too low. It\u2019s just nice that I know a few celebrities who have come to the Northeast. Later on, I\u2019ll make a call to call them over. You can take two and I\u2019ll take one. I\u2019ll let Master Lin have a threesome.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re too courteous. We have to drink another round. And don\u2019t call me Master Lin. It sounds too distant. Just call me Brother Lin.\u201d When Lin Fan heard what Godfather Liu said, his eyes lit up. But of course, this was all just an act.</p><br/><p>However, Godfather Liu and Godfather Qin couldn\u2019t help but laugh when they saw Lin Fan\u2019s excited expression. Even heroes are weak against the charm of a beautiful lady. Even if Master Lin was even more amazing, it would be hard to resist it.</p><br/><p>Most women may not be able to tempt him.</p><br/><p>But celebrities were different.</p><br/><p>They had the added bonus of reputation. The feeling of having a celebrity under your body was something that you would only know if you personally experienced it.</p><br/><p>Of course, Godfather Liu had already prepared the scenario. He would play a video of the female celebrity performing while having sex with the celebrity. In the video, the celebrity would seem holy and pure as if she could not be violated.</p><br/><p>Then, when comparing reality with the video, the feeling would be different.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, Brother Lin, as they say, \u2018No discord, no concord\u2019. Let\u2019s drink another round.\u201d Godfather Liu grinned. To him, it seemed that this Master Lin had become completely seized by him.</p><br/><p>At that moment, he felt that what Godfather Qin had said before made sense. He lost an enemy and gained a friend. It really felt pretty good.</p><br/><p>Minutes and seconds passed.</p><br/><p>The main drinkers were Godfather Liu and Lin Fan. Meanwhile, Godfather Qin drank less. Still, he had drunk at least a quarter liter.</p><br/><p>There were three empty wine bottles on the table.</p><br/><p>Godfather Liu massaged his temples. His face was completely red. He had really drunk a lot.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan pretended to be drunk as he said loudly, \u201cGodfather Liu, I really admire you. You actually thought of putting those drugs inside the rotten meat. Who would have been able to discover that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Godfather Liu felt proud. But he still grumbled, \u201cI thought so too, at first. But when Brother Lin came across it, you discovered it just like that. If only I had gotten to know Brother Lin earlier and reconciled things. This would never have happened.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThirty kilograms down the drain, just like that. Do you know how much my heart aches?\u201d</p><br/><p>Drunken indiscretion. This wasn\u2019t something that could be controlled even if one was f*cking awesome. Under the influence of alcohol, even the quietest of people would instantly become talkative.</p><br/><p>Even the most reserved woman would become a loose woman.</p><br/><p>In today\u2019s society, there are many big shots who let slip information that can be used against them after drinking too much.</p><br/><p>\u201cAhem!\u201d Godfather Qin coughed lightly, indicating for Godfather Liu to be careful of what he said.</p><br/><p>But how could the drunken Godfather Liu understand the meaning behind that? A war had already started in his brain. It was buzzing with noise.</p><br/><p>\u201cGodfather Qin, why are you coughing? Come, let the two of us drink together. Although you\u2019re older than me by quite a lot, alcohol doesn\u2019t discriminate against anyone. Come\u2026\u201d Lin Fan raised his wine cup and downed it in one go.</p><br/><p>Godfather Qin looked at Lin Fan as he cursed in his heart. <em>This guy\u2019s alcohol tolerance is way too high, isn\u2019t it?</em></p><br/><p>But Godfather Qin was not afraid. He had gotten to where he was largely due to situations involving alcohol.</p><br/><p>Decades ago, everyone had been able to drink. Whenever he got his hands on wine, he would drink with everything he had. Hence, his connections had all been accumulated in situations involving alcohol.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, I\u2019m a poor drinker,\u201d said Godfather Qin with a smile.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan stood up and smiled, \u201cToday is a happy day. Even if you can\u2019t drink, you have to drink. I\u2019m going first.\u201d</p><br/><p>Godfather Qin cursed in his heart. This kid\u2019s alcohol tolerance was way too high. He had drunk so much but he hadn\u2019t collapsed yet. Godfather Qin had no choice but to down his glass of wine as well.</p><br/><p>Soon after, Godfather Qin got up to go to the toilet.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan seized this opportunity. He placed his arm around Godfather Liu and praised him, \u201cGodfather Liu, I really admire you. For you to be able to find a scapegoat in such a situation, it\u2019s amazing. If I get into trouble in future, I\u2019ll have to rely on you, Godfather Liu.\u201d</p><br/><p>Godfather Liu had drunk too much. All he wanted to do was brag in front of this kid and make himself appear even more impressive.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, this is nothing. It was easy to find a scapegoat. But I really got f*cked by you this time, Brother. Without talking about losing those things, just in order to get this scapegoat, I spent a total of 30 million and I don\u2019t even know how many people I dragged into this matter.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled and said, \u201cSigh, forget it. Godfather Liu, you\u2019re the big shot of vices. This kind of money can be earned back in a matter of months. But really, to be able to use connections to manipulate even the police, I\u2019m afraid Godfather Qin is the only one who would be able to do that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Godfather Liu laughed proudly. \u201cIsn\u2019t that obvious? Who do you think Godfather Qin is? He\u2019s the ruler of the Northeast. Even the first in command has to treat him courteously.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s amazing. If anything happens to me in future, I\u2019d have to look to Godfather Qin for help as well,\u201d said Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. In the Northeast. Whatever Godfather Qin says, goes. Did you think this matter was so easily resolved? If it wasn\u2019t for Godfather Qin\u2019s help, do you think this matter would have concluded so easily?\u201d said Godfather Liu with a silly laugh as if he didn\u2019t feel that anything was wrong.</p><br/><p>In the broadcast room.</p><br/><p>The netizens who were watching the broadcast were stunned.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

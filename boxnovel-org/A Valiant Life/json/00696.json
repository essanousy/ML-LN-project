He is really quite powerful. D*mn, why is he at Cloud Street?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI think he is definitely here to meet Master Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHighly possible.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ever since they had opened their shops with Little Boss, they had been used to weird situations. Recently, several wealthy men came to request for Little Boss\u2019 artworks. However, they were all rejected by Little Boss.</p><br/><p>The shop owners were happy to be able to set up their shops alongside Little Boss. There was a sense of pride.</p><br/><p>The leader\u2019s secretary, Lil\u2019 Dong, saw that the notable leader was going to go to Master Lin\u2019s shop directly. He nudged him gently and hinted at him not to do so.</p><br/><p>Fang Zheng Yan looked at Lil\u2019 Dong with appreciation. He didn\u2019t think too much about it. If he was to go to Master Lin\u2019s shop directly, people would definitely expose him. Hence, he had to spend some time walking around first.</p><br/><p>They went to a random shop.</p><br/><p>\u201cBoss, how\u2019s your business? Are you satisfied with your current life? Do you need help from the government?\u201d Chief Fang smiled and asked politely. He seemed to be someone that was concerned about the welfare of the citizens.</p><br/><p>Elder Chen had previously contracted bladder cancer and his son got bullied in school. Initially, he thought that his whole family was going to die. However, because of Little Boss, everything was fine. His life was gradually improving. Although he didn\u2019t know who this person was, he smiled as he knew that he was a big shot.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m satisfied, really satisfied. I don\u2019t really need the government\u2019s help. Master Lin is looking after all of us in Cloud Street. Everyone\u2019s business is good. In the past, we\u2019ve never imagined our lives would be so good. You don\u2019t know how good Little Boss is\u2026\u201d Elder Chen wasn\u2019t really capable and powerful but he was grateful for Master Lin. He knew that the person in front of him was a big shot and he wanted to praise Little Boss so that he would have a good impression of Little Boss.</p><br/><p>Although Little Boss didn\u2019t really need it, it wasn\u2019t a hassle to do it.</p><br/><p>Fang Zheng Yan smiled and listened closely to their replies. His image was well-portrayed.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all because our leader is good at his job,\u201d Chief Che quickly praised him.</p><br/><p>He thought to himself, \u201cWhy do these shop owners not know what they\u2019re doing? He is a big shot and all of you are praising Master Lin. You must have forgotten your leader\u2019s contributions.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fang Zheng Yan smiled and looked at Chief Che. Chief Che was overwhelmed with favor from his superior. He stood by Fang Zheng Yan and did his job conscientiously.</p><br/><p>To be able to be appointed to such a high position, one had to have a certain level of intelligence. Although Chief Che didn\u2019t dare to confirm the purpose of the leader\u2019s visit, he made an accurate guess.</p><br/><p>The leader couldn\u2019t possibly have told them the truth. As the leader\u2019s subordinate, he had to share his burden and understand his situation too.</p><br/><p>Chief Che said, \u201cLeader, Master Lin\u2019s shop is just in front. Let\u2019s go and have a look. Master Lin is a Chinese Arts Master and all ten of his artworks are displayed at the national museum. That brought some pride to Shanghai.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Fang smiled and nodded, \u201cAlright, we shall go and pay Master Lin a visit.\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Chen replied, \u201cI\u2019ll bring the chiefs there.\u201d</p><br/><p>The other shop owners smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Chen knows what he is doing, offering to bring them there.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, he helped Little Boss again.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go and have a look. He is a big shot that we don\u2019t see often.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>At the entrance of Master Lin\u2019s shop.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian said, \u201cDo you think it\u2019s weird? I saw this man on TV before. He is a notable leader of Shanghai. Why is he inspecting Cloud Street? I think it is highly possible that he is here for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was a little helpless, \u201cI hope he\u2019s not here for my artworks.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian nodded, \u201cI think that is highly likely. If he is really here for them, would you give him face?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCheh\u2026\u201d Lin Fan\u2019s mouth twitched. \u201cIf I was to give everyone face, I wouldn\u2019t be back here from Beijing. However, that might not be the case after all. What if he is just here for an inspection? Let\u2019s see how it goes.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two of them shook their heads and returned to the shop.</p><br/><p>Although Fraud Tian wasn\u2019t really reliable, he wasn\u2019t the type to curry favor with the superiors.</p><br/><p>However, with his capability, he would definitely be an influential figure if he were to curry favor with them.</p><br/><p>Although he wasn\u2019t doing very well, Fraud Tian was a Ba Gua Zhang master after all. If he tried to lean on authority, a lot of people would definitely be willing to hire him.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan asked, \u201cBrother Lin, what is happening outside? It looks lively.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cNothing much, a notable leader is here for an inspection. I don\u2019t know what he is really here for.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Tian He walked to the door and looked far away, \u201cFang Zheng Yan. I didn\u2019t expect it to be him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cYou know him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe used to be in charge of Lianzhou in the past. It\u2019s been almost ten years. After that, he got sent to Shanghai. I didn\u2019t expect him to become a notable leader in Shanghai. He must be powerful,\u201d Wu Tian He replied.</p><br/><p>He was considered to be one of the most powerful people in the country. Furthermore, Fang Zheng Yan was still young. He was only in his fifties. His future was still bright.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe is definitely one of the more powerful individuals of the government,\u201d Wu Tian He said.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan couldn\u2019t figure out why such a high-ranking official would come to Cloud Street. However, if he was really there to ask for an artwork, should he really give it to him?</p><br/><p>Cheh!</p><br/><p>Even if it was a higher ranking official, it wouldn\u2019t matter. He was extremely lazy. All he had to do was to reject him.</p><br/><p>However, that might not be the case. The person might not be there for an artwork. Hence, he still had to see what was going to happen.</p><br/><p>Indeed.</p><br/><p>\u201cChief, this is Master Lin,\u201d Elder Chen entered his shop and introduced him to Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Chief Che followed behind the notable leader and felt the pressure. He was nothing compared to Fang Zheng Yan. To be able to follow him around was an extremely rare opportunity.</p><br/><p>His secretary, Lil\u2019 Dong, looked at Master Lin and gasped. He was indeed a young and capable man. Using \u2018genius\u2019 to describe a man like him would be an understatement since he had an impeccable talent at such a young age.</p><br/><p>Fang Zheng Yan smiled and praised him, \u201cA young hero. Nice to meet you, comrade Lil\u2019 Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you, Chief, for your compliment. However, comrade Lil\u2019 Lin sounds a little weird. I feel more comfortable with Master Lin.\u201d Master Lin had participated in major events before and although Zheng Zhong Shan wasn\u2019t really powerful anymore, he was still a higher ranking official than Fang Zheng Yan. If Zheng Zhong Shan was to find out that this fella called him Lil\u2019 Lin, it\u2019d be like punching him on his knees. Was he trying to disrespect the elderly official?</p><br/><p>Fang Zheng Yan was stunned. Then, he smiled, \u201cRight, right. Sorry for the slip of my tongue. Master Lin\u2019s talent is extraordinary. Your artworks are internationally recognized. They\u2019ve helped the country gain some pride. You\u2019re indeed a treasure of the nation. I should address you as Master Lin instead.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Che wiped the sweat from his forehead. Master Lin was indeed a bold man. It was frightening. Thankfully, the notable leader wasn\u2019t angry. If the leader was furious, he would probably be affected in the future.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p></div>\n</div>"}

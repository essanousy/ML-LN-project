He was getting ready to go to the Honors Ceremony. This would only be his second time going to such a ceremony. It still felt good.</p><br/><p>If it were normal people, they would definitely be scared of this and that. They would be scared of the criminals coming to find them once again for revenge. However, Lin Fan wasn\u2019t scared. If they dared to come, he would take them on and he would once again be successful. After which he would be able to get a Good Citizen Award, which would feel good.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian was smoking a cigarette. With a look of doubt, he shouted, \u201cLooks like it is time for you to be in the limelight again.\u201d</p><br/><p>When he watched the previous Honors Ceremony, he was filled with envy. The feeling of a million pairs of eyes staring at you is one to be envious of. He wanted to go as well, but he couldn\u2019t.</p><br/><p>Who asked him to not have the ability to solve a case.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed and calmly said, \u201cThis limelight is not one that one is able to achieve simply by dreaming of it. There are many hidden dangers behind it all.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian replied, \u201cI would rather these dangers so that I can get that limelight.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe.\u201d Lin Fan was extremely proud. \u201cThen you need to be hardworking. However, I feel as though you are rather uncertain. After all, you weren\u2019t able to solve the latest big case.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha.\u201d Fraud Tian didn\u2019t dare to say anymore. This b*stard was too much of a show-off. How could I, a Tian, not have such capabilities?</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan worriedly asked, \u201cBrother Lin, you really don\u2019t intend on getting the monkey costume ready?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved his hands, \u201cWhat monkey costume? Is that my style? It\u2019s about time I leave. I\u2019ll make a move first. I\u2019ll bring back the award to let you all have a touch.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian was elated, \u201cThat is a good idea. I\u2019ll go online to check for a suitable restaurant.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAll you know how to do is to eat. Let\u2019s go get the award, Elder Dog!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>At the grounds of the Honors Ceremony.</p><br/><p>In front of the doors.</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian was waving his hands, \u201cMaster Lin, over here\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>There were many police cars parked outside. The big shots of the Shanghai police force had arrived. Scorpion was a wanted fugitive throughout the entire nation. If any city\u2019s police force were to be able to capture Scorpion, it would be a huge mission success! If Scorpion was caught in Shanghai, it would mean a huge deal to them.</p><br/><p>Even though they weren\u2019t the ones who caught him personally, what was the difference? He was still caught in Shanghai anyway.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cI\u2019m not late, am I?\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian was in a good mood. He looked very smart wearing the police uniform. \u201cNope, you aren\u2019t. Even if you did arrive late, it wouldn\u2019t matter. There are many people who walked past me that want to get to know you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed, \u201cWhy would they want to get to know me? I simply sell scallion pancakes!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha!\u201d Liu Xiao Tian patted Lin Fan on his shoulder, \u201cMaster Lin, stop teasing around. Who else sells scallion pancakes like yours? However, there is an interesting event. Nowadays, there\u2019s always a picture of you pasted on the front of those mobile carts selling scallion pancakes on the streets. The previous government official that I worked with previous would often tell me that, whenever he saw such carts, he couldn\u2019t bear to do anything to them. All he could do was to talk to them nicely and come to peace with them. It was a lot better than the old times.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan burst out laughing. This was just too pretentious. Since when did he become so capable? Could it be that he had become the idol of those mobile carts?</p><br/><p>At this moment, someone appeared in the distance. When he saw Inspector Liu talking to Lin Fan, his eyes lit up.</p><br/><p>\u201cInspector Liu\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian looked over, \u201cHey! Inspector Huang!\u201d Thereafter, he introduced, \u201cMaster Lin this is Inspector Huang from the Jiaxi District!:</p><br/><p>Inspector Huang arrived before the two of them, and immediately greeted, \u201cMaster Lin, I have been looking forward to meeting you for a very long time! I never thought that someone so young could be so capable. Many youngsters in my center hold you in high regard!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed, \u201cInspector Huang, you\u2019re too kind.\u201d</p><br/><p>The three of them chatted for a while longer, then Inspector Huang proceeded in before them.</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian tapped Lin Fan, \u201cInspector Huang might not have said it, but he certainly has this idea. Because of you, now the people from the various districts are all so envious of me. This pressure is too much!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan had no other response, \u201cWhat can I do then? No one asked you to be so familiar with me. I\u2019d always look for you when I have a situation.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian felt that he became extremely lucky after getting to know Master Lin. Not only did he switch from a government official to become a policeman, he also got promoted from a mere policeman to the position of an inspector!</p><br/><p>The rate of promotion could be said to be frightening.</p><br/><p>However, he felt that this wasn\u2019t because of his own capabilities, but rather, it was due to Master Lin.</p><br/><p>\u201cInspector Liu, is this individual Master Lin?\u201d At this moment, a middle-aged man walked over. The dark-skinned man looked very energetic and was filled with vigor.</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian went forward to approach him, \u201cChief Qin, this is Master Lin who arrested Scorpion.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, this is the Chief of the Special Action Group of the Drug Enforcement Team. He is both brave and knowledgeable. The number one bane of drug abusers! He is an awesome person who has solved many huge cases!\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Qin laughed, \u201cInspector Liu, you may have gone overboard flattering me. It is merely my responsibility. However, I admire Master Lin. We have been following Scorpion for a very long time, but we never had a lead. I never thought that Master Lin would be able to take him down in one motion. Respect, respect!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan politely said, \u201cChief Qin, you are over-praising me. As a good citizen with a sense of justice, whenever I meet someone that\u2019s up to no good, my first instinct is to immediately catch him! Our Shanghai is an internationally well-known city, how can we let allow these people to tarnish our image?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Qin said, \u201cMaster Lin, I have come with a request but I\u2019m not sure if you would be interested in it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan immediately shook his head, \u201cI\u2019m not interested.\u201d He knew what Chief Qin meant, but he also knew that whatever he said would not be good.</p><br/><p>\u201cChief Qin, what you\u2019re doing isn\u2019t right. You can\u2019t be this outright when asking someone for a favor. Moreover, Master Lin also has his own business. Catching criminals is only his side job.\u201d Liu Xiao Tian also knew what Chief Qin wanted. He knew that it wasn\u2019t only Chief Qin that had this idea, but rather the entire Drug Enforcement Team.</p><br/><p>After all, they had been trying to follow the trail of Scorpion but always made no progress. However, Master Lin managed to take him down in such a short period of time. How can such ability not attract the attention of others?</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian waited for Chief Qin to leave, then shook his head, \u201cMaster Lin, you have to take it easy. This Chief Qin is too direct in asking people for favors.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cHe indeed does come on a bit strongly. However, it\u2019s of no use. I\u2019m not someone that is so easily roped in.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian laughed. What he said was true. If Master Lin was so easily roped in, he would have stopped selling scallion pancakes long ago.</p><br/><p>After a period of time, Lin Fan got the feel of the place. There were many celebrities around.</p><br/><p>The inspectors and bureau chiefs of various districts all smiled at him in an attempt to get closer to Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Some of them were very blunt and they immediately talked to Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>If he were to discover another criminal in the future, they wanted to be notified instead of Liu Xiao Tian.</p><br/><p>At this moment, not only was Lin Fan left speechless, even Liu Xiao Tian was helpless.</p></div>\n</div>"}

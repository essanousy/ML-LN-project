He did not really know how to use the computer outside of its basic functions.</p><br/><p>Hence, when he saw how quickly Master Lin was using it, he was really impressed by it.</p><br/><p>\u201cSoon, I\u2019m going to find out who it is. I have to find the source of this video first,\u201d Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can even figure that out?\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian was stunned. It was the first time he heard something like this.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied confidently, \u201cOf course. Although people find this difficult, I think it is extremely easy. It just requires some time. If not for my agreement to stop using the computer, I would have done this in my shop.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, if you\u2019d like to use the computer next time, you can come over here again. I will replace the computers with the best models for you,\u201d Liu Xiao Tian replied. He also received an order to not let Master Lin touch computers.</p><br/><p>He was not worried that Master Lin would do anything illegal. After all, he really trusted him. He was just worried that Master Lin would cause something major to happen again, which would be difficult to handle.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s done! I\u2019m going to arrest the person. I even got her identification documents.\u201d Lin Fan smiled and stopped using the computer.</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian looked at the computer screen and realised that the personal information of the person was being shown. It was something that ordinary people could not access. Only people who had access to their system could find out about it.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, did you just hack into the system?\u201d Liu Xiao Tian did not know how else to put it. He did not even realise it as Master Lin was doing it right in front of him.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean by \u2018hack\u2019? It\u2019s just here for me to use, right? Hacking sounds pretty bad. How could you say that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian smiled. \u201cYeah, it\u2019s not hacking. You\u2019re just using the computer. Let me see who is this person.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe stays in the capital. That\u2019s great. I\u2019ll contact some of the guys there to handle the case. I want to see what\u2019s wrong with this person.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, wait.\u201d Lin Fan continued to check the person\u2019s records.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Liu Xiao Tian asked.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cI just checked her bank records. Every month, a few international transactions of high amounts goes through her account.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d Liu Xiao Tian felt that something was wrong.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet me see her emails.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan continued to work on it and the images on the screen changed.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe hid them very well. Her IP address has over fifty different logins. Each time, she only uses one, and her login time is also very long. She usually logs into an account every seven to fifteen days.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCan we see what she\u2019s been sending?\u201d Liu Xiao Tian asked. He felt that something was amiss.</p><br/><p>\u201cSure, that\u2019s easy.\u201d Lin Fan smiled. He logged into the different emails and opened up the inboxes. There were some documents and pictures.</p><br/><p>He opened up the files, and the images were pictures of the interiors of forbidden places such as military bases.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, wait, these things\u2026\u201d Liu Xiao Tian was stunned. He finally realised what was happening.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan made a copy of the e-transactions and passwords. \u201cInspector Liu, I\u2019ve done my part. The rest depends on you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian nodded. \u201cMaster Lin, you\u2019ve helped me a lot again.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, I did not expect this at all. If there\u2019s going to be another award for good citizenship, please contact me. The wall in my shop is waiting,\u201d Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>\u201cSure, if this is resolved, I will send in an application for you,\u201d Liu Xiao Tian replied. He wanted to quickly resolve this issue anyway.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, the culprit was in the capital, so he had to inform them about it anyways.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan left the police station. He hadn\u2019t expected this at all.</p><br/><p>The next day!</p><br/><p>There was another piece of news on the Internet.</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks to Master Lin\u2019s help, we have successfully arrested a person who has been sending confidential information of our nation to other countries.\u201d</p><br/><p>When the news was announced, the netizens that had been engrossed in the orange incident and the international competition were stunned.</p><br/><p>Master Lin had been on fire recently. He kept appearing on the news.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan finished making his scallion pancakes in Cloud Street and smiled after reading the news. He had not expected it to be reported so quickly.</p><br/><p>After reading the comments on Weibo, he felt pretty good.</p><br/><p>\u201c6666\u2026 Master Lin is too amazing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, so it was her who shared the false rumours. The traitor got arrested thanks to Master Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck, I will always trust Master Lin. I will not doubt anything he says or recommends.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin did a fantastic job. Another good deed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThese days, people will do anything for money. It\u2019s horrifying.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian said, \u201cYour luck has been too good. How did you even arrest this person?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. \u201cHow else? I just did some simple checks. I did not expect such a big problem to arise. I guess I\u2019ve done another great deed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Lin, I\u2019m really impressed. You\u2019ve done well again!\u201d Zhao Zhong Yang exclaimed. He knew that Brother Lin was already used to appearing on the news.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. He did not really care about this. It was just pure coincidence for him this time.</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian called. \u201cMaster Lin, I applied for the award for you. You stand a great chance.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, thank you so much.\u201d Lin Fan just realised that he had a hobby of collecting awards. He felt great every time he looked at the awards hanging on the wall.</p><br/><p>Then, he ended the call.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cI\u2019m going to the welfare institute to check on the kids.\u201d</p><br/><p>The welfare institute had been doing very well, and the kids\u2019 situations were improving tremendously. After hearing what the teachers said, he felt that the kids had achieved a lot of great things.</p><br/><p>Perhaps they were all geniuses.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

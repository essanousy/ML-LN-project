Being able to arrest Scorpion this time is not only because of the police force but even more so because of Master Lin. If not for him, we wouldn\u2019t be successful without having even a single lead. At the same time, during the process to arrest Scorpion, the policemen had put in a great deal of hard work. Hence, this Honors Ceremony should be for the entire police force, as well as Master Lin!\u201d Liu Xiao Tian didn\u2019t dare to boast that this arrest operation was entirely due to their hard work and had nothing to do with the others seated in the hall. If he were to say it, he would definitely be flamed by the other leaders.</p><br/><p>*Applause*</p><br/><p>The audience began applauding and acknowledged what Liu Xiao Tian presented. However, in their hearts, they knew that this success was entirely due to Master Lin. If it weren\u2019t for him, there wouldn\u2019t even be a game to play.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed, \u201cInspector Liu is too humble. I\u2019m not part of the organization, but from what I can see, Inspector Liu is a good inspector. He does things with his heart and soul. Previously, being someone that didn\u2019t care about other people\u2019s business, I was also touched by his actions. He inspired me to play my part in upholding justice.</p><br/><p>As expected, what Liu Xiao Tian feared the most has come.</p><br/><p>Master Lin started to go overboard in commending him.</p><br/><p>However, he didn\u2019t know why, but he was feeling good about it.</p><br/><p>The policemen below the stage also laughed. They weren\u2019t a single bit unhappy. To them, this wasn\u2019t an Honors Ceremony, but rather it was an opportunity for the policemen to integrate with the citizens, building a platform for solving cases to be more streamlined.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan continued to compliment Liu Xiao Tian.</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian then began to push his contributions to one side.</p><br/><p>Following Liu Xiao Tian\u2019s intentions, mistakes are mine, but the contributions are everyone\u2019s.</p><br/><p>Elder Dog Nicholas was squatting beside Lin Fan. However, after blinking his eyes, he stretched out his paws and laid down on the ground, motionless. These humans are so interesting. They have so much bullsh*t to say.</p><br/><p>Each second ticked by.</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian wanted to cry but showed no tears. He didn\u2019t care about the situation anymore and bluntly said, \u201cMaster Lin, say no more. At this rate, you\u2019re going to make me into a saint. How am I going to work with my colleagues in future?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, the audience burst into laughter. Even the leaders were laughing, as though they had no intention of blaming anyone.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan also laughed, \u201cOkay, then I wouldn\u2019t speak anymore. I\u2019m just trying to give you some credit.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Honors Ceremony this time can be considered to be a new and fresh experience.</p><br/><p>Thereafter, a leader went on stage. \u201cDuring this operation to arrest Scorpion, Master Lin had a huge contribution. After much discussion, we have decided to award Master Lin with 200,000 dollars!\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Yuan was videoing the entire situation from below the stage. His face was filled with joy. Such an Honors Ceremony had only been held twice and both times were because of Master Lin.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t as though there weren\u2019t any Honors Ceremony previously. It was only that during those ceremonies, the atmosphere was always very serious. No one dared to breathe.</p><br/><p>After which, there was a group photograph session.</p><br/><p>The schedule had run to an end, and the Honors Ceremony was also coming to an end.</p><br/><p>End of the ceremony.</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian couldn\u2019t help but say, \u201cMaster Lin, you have praised me too much this time. I wouldn\u2019t dare to slack off in future.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed, \u201cInspector Liu, the capable people should be doing more work.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, I suggest that if you want to leave, you should leave soon. If you wait any longer, I\u2019m afraid it would be too late,\u201d Liu Xiao Tiao said.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian pointed at a distance, \u201cTake a look for yourself! Look at how many people are looking for you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan gazed in that direction. It was already enough just looking at it. Even Chief Qin and other leaders were in that crowd, and they were all looking for him.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, then I wouldn\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll take my leave. Please don\u2019t let them disturb me,\u201d Lin Fan waved. He then picked up Elder Dog and boarded the car, leaving this place.</p><br/><p>Not long after Lin Fan left, the crowd came before Liu Xiao Tian. \u201cWhere did Master Lin go?\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian replied, \u201cHe just went home.\u201d</p><br/><p>The crowd felt a pang of regret. They didn\u2019t think that Master Lin would just leave them like that.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was elated. 200,000 dollars in his hand. Elder Dog laid on the seat beside him. He was motionless and had an expression of peace.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Zhao Mingqing called him. Ever since he had taken the pill, Lin Fan didn\u2019t know what was the situation with his discipline. However, the perfect-grade little intelligence pill wasn\u2019t so simple. It would definitely have produced many unbelievable effects.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing was rather advanced in his age. His mind was slowly becoming less and less active. However, with this little intelligence pill, it shouldn\u2019t have been much of a problem. His mind would definitely be more active than the youngsters.</p><br/><p>\u201cMing Qing, what is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher! The little intelligence pill is too incredible. I can remember many things that I\u2019ve previously forgotten!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that all?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, there\u2019s more. Even though I have not achieved photographic memory, but I\u2019ve realized that whenever I\u2019m reading a book, the content would be very deeply engraved into my mind. Teacher, I\u2019m afraid this little intelligence pill is simply too incredible.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing didn\u2019t know what else to say. He took the pill two night before, but he already experienced so many changes the day before. It had already left him speechless.</p><br/><p>The pill that his mentor had concocted was too godly, and this made him feel a little scared.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed, \u201cIt\u2019s not simple. The effects of the perfect-grade little intelligence pill shouldn\u2019t only be like this. Go and ponder over it. Moreover, your mind should be more active now. It would be of great help to your studies of Chinese medicine.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you so much, teacher.\u201d Zhao Mingqing was extremely grateful.</p><br/><p>He was already so old. He had studied Chinese medicine for such a long period of time, so addressing him as \u2018Master\u2019 isn\u2019t too much. However, he felt that he would be able to compete with the younger generation.</p><br/><p>The younger generation was careful yet bold. They were willing to put up a fight.</p><br/><p>However, at his age, his train of thoughts was more rigid and less reasonable and he didn\u2019t dare to use medication in excess. Therefore, even though he might theoretically be more knowledgeable, in practice, he loses out.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed, \u201cThere\u2019s no need to thank me. You are my student, of course, I have to let you improve. In the event that I contact a disease in future, I can always come to you. That\u2019s right, what\u2019s the situation regarding the distribution of the Chinese medicine foundation training materials?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, right now the materials are in the last stage of filing. It\u2019ll be readily distributed to the Chinese medicine schools within the nation soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good to hear. Tell me when the distribution begins.\u201d</p><br/><p>He was thinking about the Encyclopedia. He wasn\u2019t very skilled in earning Encyclopaedic points. If the distribution of the materials is successful, he may be able to earn a fortune of points.</p><br/><p>After putting down the call, Lin Fan headed to Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>When he reached Cloud Street, he was met with firecrackers set off by the business owners. It was as if they were celebrating for him.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle boss, it seems that this time you have once again done a huge deed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe all know that you attended the Honors Ceremony. Amazing!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOur Little boss is a God!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled proudly, then proceeded to humbly wave at the business owners.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a small matter, a small matter. It\u2019s not worth the mention.\u201d</p><br/><p>To Lin Fan, it is indeed a small matter. However, to the business owners, it is a huge deal.</p><br/><p>Our Cloud Street is capable of producing heroes!</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>At night.</p><br/><p>At Qingtian Bay.</p><br/><p>This was the street racing heaven. But it was also a terrifying place.</p><br/><p>Many did not dare to come here in search of excitement. However, to some people, if they didn\u2019t look for excitement, their lives would be boring. Especially when they had nothing to do during the day. The day would feel as if it were a year.</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung Chang, are you up for the next round? If not, I\u2019ll go,\u201d A young man said. His appearance radiated a kind of arrogance.</p></div>\n</div>"}

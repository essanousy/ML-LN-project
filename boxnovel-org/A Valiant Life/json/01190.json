After what was reported, other publication companies also followed suit to write fake news.</p><br/><p>Then, they realized that it was really effective in increasing their viewership rate.</p><br/><p>However, a news article that appeared frightened them and made them delete everything.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Director of Jin Ming Publishers got arrested by the police and will pay a hefty price for creating fake news.\u201d</p><br/><p>They did not expect the police to have taken action so quickly since the news was only published a short while ago.</p><br/><p>They actually did not know that Master Lin\u2019s research about AIDS was being closely observed by the government. Although they did not make any announcements, they had been waiting for the results.</p><br/><p>If he were to succeed in eradicating it, it would be an extraordinary feat.</p><br/><p>They could not tolerate the spread of fake news on the Internet, and hence they took quick action to prevent it from spreading.</p><br/><p>The Shanghai reporters laughed when they saw the headline. That was what they had hoped for. The publishers of fake news always ended up suffering.</p><br/><p>The netizens were also stunned after seeing the arrest of the director of the publication company.</p><br/><p>They had caused so much trouble with just one piece of fake news.</p><br/><p>Those reporters waiting outside the Chinese Medical Academy were very anxious. After all, many days had passed and there was no news at all. They wondered what was happening inside.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yi Jun had been waiting patiently and all he wanted to hear was, \u201cWe\u2019ve succeeded.\u201d</p><br/><p>However, the days passed, and he was getting a little impatient.</p><br/><p>Sometimes, he would even overthink, and images of Master Lin declaring it as a failure would appear in his mind.</p><br/><p>However, he quickly picked himself up and believed that Master Lin would definitely succeed.</p><br/><p>People dropped by the academy every day to observe the situation.</p><br/><p>Although it had nothing to do with them, they all wanted Master Lin to succeed.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease excuse me\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, a truck arrived and there were a lot of herbs on it.</p><br/><p>The manufacturer was there to deliver herbs again after receiving a call from Master Lin.</p><br/><p>The people that were there started to discuss among themselves after witnessing that.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it? Could it be that they already used up all the medicine inside?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat can\u2019t be. I remember that they delivered a lot of medicine a few days ago. How could they finish all of it so quickly?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. It seems like it\u2019s a difficult process, but that is expected. After all, it\u2019s such a complicated illness.\u201d</p><br/><p>To the townsfolk, they knew that the previous delivery of herbs included a huge amount of medicine.</p><br/><p>However, they did not know what to say when they found out that Master Lin had actually used up everything.</p><br/><p>The rate that the medicine was being used was simply too rapid. It was unbelievable.</p><br/><p>At the entrance.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing stood there excitedly. He learned a lot from his mentor, and he felt that perhaps they were going to succeed soon.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Zhao, the workers don\u2019t dare to come here. I\u2019ll be the only one transporting the goods,\u201d the manufacturer said.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing replied, \u201cIt\u2019s okay. I understand.\u201d</p><br/><p>After all, everyone knew the danger of what they were researching. It was normal for them to be unwilling to enter.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, the amount of herbs that they delivered this time was easy to be moved.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Zhao, what\u2019s the situation like? Can Master Lin succeed?\u201d The manufacturer asked.</p><br/><p>He was really worried about the matter.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing nodded. \u201cYeah, don\u2019t worry. My mentor is heading the right direction, and I think it\u2019ll be done soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>The manufacturer was stunned after hearing that. It was as if he had heard the best news ever.</p><br/><p>It was not a simple statement. It was as if he said that they had succeeded.</p><br/><p>\u201cI shan\u2019t talk about it in detail. After all, the outcome is not known yet,\u201d Zhao Ming Qing said.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d the manufacturer replied.</p><br/><p>In the lab.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was busy testing the different combinations of medicine.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing was recording it beside him, and he did not dare to say anything as he did not want to interrupt his mentor\u2019s thinking.</p><br/><p>They were making significant progress, and his mentor said that it would be over soon.</p><br/><p>He did not know if his mentor said that to appease him, but he believed in his mentor\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>During Yuan Yuan\u2019s stay, she did not cry at all. She sat there patiently, and sometimes she would fall asleep when Master Lin wanted her to with just a simple touch. He knew that he would never be able to do that as he did not possess the powers of his mentor.</p><br/><p>On the Internet.</p><br/><p>\u201cStill no progress? It\u2019s taking a long time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c???\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean? It\u2019s normal. Do you think it can be done so quickly?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cActually, I\u2019ve been thinking about the power of Chinese Medicine. Is it that good? I feel like studying it, but I have also heard that Chinese Medicine will not win me a good future.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you stupid? Chinese Medicine is on the rise now. If you were to open a Chinese Medical hall overseas, it would be booming with business. Also, if you know how to prepare the herbs, it would bring even more revenue.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, really? Who did you hear from?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean? It\u2019s all over the Internet. It\u2019s all because of Master Lin. People set up Chinese medical halls all over the world and are doing really well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s not talk about that anymore. I\u2019m still in shock. I feel that Master Lin is simply extraordinary.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI believe Master Lin will definitely succeed.\u201d</p><br/><p>More people started to wait outside the Medical Academy. They had a lot of faith in Master Lin. They believed that Master Lin was the God of Chinese Medicine.</p><br/><p>He was the best in both Chinese and Western Medicine.</p><br/><p>The next morning!</p><br/><p>At 6am.</p><br/><p>Nobody was outside the medical academy besides the reporters.</p><br/><p>Then, the doors of the lab suddenly opened.</p><br/><p>A silhouette could be seen walking out of it.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s finally done.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

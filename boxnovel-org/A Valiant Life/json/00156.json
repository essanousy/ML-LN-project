Electronic fingerprint doors were unlike typical locks. Any kind of lock could be unlocked, but this kind of lock was extremely difficult to unlock. Even skillful experts wouldn't know where to start when it came to this kind of lock.</p><br/><p>Taking ten minutes to unlock this kind of fingerprint door was already considered impossibly fast. Even Master Wang was in disbelief when he heard this.</p><br/><p>However, they didn't have the luxury of ten minutes. By the time ten minutes was up, perhaps the kid who was hanging from the window grill would already have been choked to death.</p><br/><p>The policeman asked, \"What should we do? We definitely won't make it in time if we need ten minutes.\"</p><br/><p>Master Wang remained silent. Even he was completely helpless.</p><br/><p>The young mother was crying. She pulled on Lin Fan, \"I'm begging you, please save my child!\"</p><br/><p>The surrounding doctors and townsfolk shook their heads and sighed. It looked like there was no hope. A lot could happen in ten minutes. That life which was on the verge between life and death could very likely fall into the deep abyss.</p><br/><p>The policeman patted Lin Fan's shoulder, \"Just do your best. We'll understand.\"</p><br/><p>They all understood that this matter couldn't be blamed on anyone. That youngster was already trying his best. When he opened the first door, everyone had heaved a sigh of relief, but when they saw the second door, they all sunk into despair.</p><br/><p>Looking at how things were, even if they managed to unlock the door, it would probably be too late.</p><br/><p>He wasn't some god. He could only do his best with the given situation.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan took a few steps back, \"Everyone, please take a few steps back.\"</p><br/><p>The policeman and the rest of them didn't know what this youngster going to do, but all of their hopes were placed on him, so they stepped backward.</p><br/><p>Master Wang picked up the pile of packages in front of the door.</p><br/><p>The surrounding doctors and townsfolk were all watching the youngster standing in front of the door, not knowing what he was trying to do.</p><br/><p>Since the lock couldn't be picked in time, then let's use force.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan stood there and took a deep breath. All the muscles and bones in his body started crackling with thunderous sounds.</p><br/><p>Invigorate my blood circulation. Let my blood boil.</p><br/><p>The crowd was astonished. That sound seemed to be coming from the youngster's body, but they had no idea how the sound was made.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan planted both feet on the ground, then he raised one foot onto his toes. He put one arm forward and one arm back. With a thunderous roar, he thrust his body forward. At that moment, his strength and speed reached their peaks.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>His two palms hit the copper door. A dull sound rang through the corridor. The door frame shook vigorously. Sediments from the wall came drifting down. The copper door was dented inwards. It had been caved in by the blow.</p><br/><p>Eyes widened and mouths gaped.</p><br/><p>At that moment, everyone froze, it was as if they had just seen a ghost.</p><br/><p>Even the crying, anxious young mother just stared blankly at him.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan lowered his hands and took a few steps back. His hands were trembling slightly and his palms were bright red.</p><br/><p>He wasn't Superman, nor was he some Kung Fu master with inner power. He was just flesh and bones. The effect of his power went both ways. It hurt his body just as much as the door. And it was not just some wooden door, it was a copper door.</p><br/><p>If it was a wooden door, he would've destroyed it easily with a single blow. It wouldn't have had to come to this.</p><br/><p>\"AH!\"</p><br/><p>With another blow, the copper door started to rock even more. A few cracks appeared on the wall.</p><br/><p>The policeman watched in astonishment. It was unbelievable. Terrifying. Simply terrifying.</p><br/><p>The spectating townsfolk had forgotten everything else and just gazed upon the scene before them.</p><br/><p>It looked surreal to them.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan strode forward with his right foot. Veins popped out of his forehead and sweat droplets dripped down from his face. With the ferocity of a tiger leaping towards its prey, his two palms struck the copper door once more.</p><br/><p>Crack!</p><br/><p>The door frame cracked open and fell apart from the wall. The metal rod embedded into the wall had cracks on it. Of course, no one could see this. However, they felt it.</p><br/><p>Soon...soon\u2026</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>He continued throwing blows at the door, one after another, each of them had immense power behind them. The crowd felt as if the whole corridor was shaking. That dull, thudding sound rattled their eardrums.</p><br/><p>On the walkie-talkie.</p><br/><p>\"What's going on at your side? What's that booming noise?\"</p><br/><p>The policeman at the scene slowly reached for his walkie-talkie and said in shock,</p><br/><p>\"Superman is breaking the door\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Walkie talkie: \"...?\"</p><br/><p>Boom!</p><br/><p>The final blow.</p><br/><p>The copper door collapsed with a boom.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was panting vigorously. In that short period of time, it was as if he had used up every ounce of energy in his body. His arms were trembling non-stop and they were completely numb. He couldn't feel his arms at all.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \"It's done, what are you all still looking at? Hurry up and go in!\"</p><br/><p>The people suddenly came to their senses and rushed into the house immediately.</p><br/><p>\"I'll carry the kid's torso, you guys hold onto his legs. Doctor, hurry up and take a look at him!\"</p><br/><p>\"Make way! Make way for the doctor!\"</p><br/><p>Bustling noises came from inside the house. The sound of the child's mother crying and moaning, the sound of the policeman rushing...</p><br/><p>At that moment, everyone ran into the house.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan glanced around the house which had two burglar-proof doors installed. It was magnificently decorated. It was obviously not cheap at all, but was there really a need to install two burglar-proof doors?</p><br/><p>He took the elevator and left the place. He was no longer required.</p><br/><p>First floor!</p><br/><p>The fighters scurried into the elevator with equipment in their hands.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan held tightly onto his own arms and walked away with a calm expression on his face.</p><br/><p>Outside.</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan looked at his palms, he had an urge to start crying.</p><br/><p>\"They're swollen!\"</p><br/><p>\"They're so swollen that I can't feel them\u2026\"</p><br/><p>The abilities from the encyclopedia were indeed powerful, but still, they weren't meant to be used against copper doors. To knock down a copper door, his hands had to be destroyed in the process.</p><br/><p>Judging by the state of his hands, if he didn't take proper care of them and rest for a few days, his hands might never recover.</p><br/><p>The owner of the 26th-floor apartment was home.</p><br/><p>When he saw the copper door on the ground, he was dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>He wasn't sad about the copper door, but when he bought the electronic fingerprint door, the salesman had said that no one could open the door other than himself.</p><br/><p>But now?</p><br/><p>The first thing he saw when he reached home was his burglar-proof door lying miserably on the ground.</p><br/><p>The surrounding residents sighed.</p><br/><p>\"Good thing the child's head was big, otherwise, it would've turned out horribly.\"</p><br/><p>\"Yeah, our estate doesn't allow for window grills to be installed outside, but this owner still did it. Who would have thought that it would save a child's life?\"</p><br/><p>\"This is the 26th floor. Just thinking about it scares me.\"</p><br/><p>\"Hey, where did that youngster who broke down the door go? Did any of you see him?\"</p><br/><p>\"No. He was here just a while ago. How did he disappear so quickly?\"</p><br/><p>\"This is what it means to do good without seeking recognition. He's a selfless model citizen.\"</p><br/><p>After the child left with the ambulance, the policeman cleaned up the aftermath. When he told his colleagues below about what had happened, all of them had stunned looks on their faces.</p><br/><p>Was this a joke?</p><br/><p>If they hadn't seen it with their own eyes, nobody would've believed it.</p><br/><p>However, at least the people at the scene had taken videos. That scene that shook everyone to their cores had been recorded from start to finish.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Personally making a move and immediately settling things.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, reform? Reform my a*s.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. He just took to office as the Chairman and then immediately tries to be bold and decisive and starts reforming. Who does he think he is?\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, the phone of one of the members rang. It was a notification from Weibo. When he saw that it was from Master Lin\u2019s Weibo, he could not help laughing.</p><br/><p>\u201cGuys, wait a moment. Our Chairman Lin has posted on Weibo. Let me take a look and see what has happened.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone started laughing. \u201cLet\u2019s see What our Chairman Lin will say. Could it be that he\u2019ll say that it was because he was immature and that he realized he was in the wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>However, the smile on the face of the member who was checking his Weibo slowly disappeared and turned into an expression of deep shock.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happened? What did he say?\u201d</p><br/><p>The member showed his phone to everyone and then swallowed his saliva. \u201cYou guys can see for yourselves.\u201d</p><br/><p>After everyone\u2019s eyes locked onto the phone\u2019s screen, their expressions completely changed. Some of them could not believe what they were seeing.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow could he dare to write something like this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis can\u2019t be true. Didn\u2019t Elder Zhang speak to him already? He is really just clinging on to his old ways.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Online, the netizens were watching the program. When they saw the other party say that Master Lin had accepted his suggestion, they were all slightly in disbelief.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is this old man saying? Master Lin listens to him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t say for sure. However, the other party is the former Vice-Chairman of the Chinese Medical Academy. So he is probably higher in seniority than Master Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cImpossible. Master Lin isn\u2019t the type of person who will act in a way to save other people\u2019s face.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, it\u2019s hard to say.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBullsh*t, you guys can go take a look at Master Lin\u2019s Weibo for yourselves. You\u2019re still talking about seniority. Master Lin doesn\u2019t care about seniority.\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, everyone rushed to check Lin Fan\u2019s Weibo. When they saw his latest post, everyone was stunned.</p><br/><p>He\u2019s being a tyrant again!</p><br/><p>During the program.</p><br/><p>The host heard all the sounds from backstage in his earpiece. After that, his expression immediately changed. He had never thought that the situation would turn out like that.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Zhang, I\u2019m sorry to interrupt you but we just received an update that Master Lin has posted on Weibo, announcing the time and the place of the examination.\u201d The host felt a little bit embarrassed. Master Lin had updated his Weibo right after the introduction.</p><br/><p><em>It can\u2019t be that he has been watching the program all this while and waiting for the right moment, right?</em></p><br/><p>However, he had guess it right. Lin Fan indeed was watching the program.</p><br/><p>Zhang Guo Shou waved his hand, obviously showing that he was in disbelief, \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><br/><p>The host said, \u201cMaster Lin just made a post on Weibo informing people of the place and time for the examination. Also, he\u2019s telling them they can sign up on the Chinese Medical Academy\u2019s official website tomorrow at 12 noon.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, Zhang Guo Shou whipped out his phone and immediately went to check Lin Fan\u2019s Weibo. When he took a look at it, his face immediately turned red and he got up from the sofa.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow can he do this? He doesn\u2019t listen to instructions at all.\u201d Zhang Guo Shou felt a knot in the pit of his stomach and he got extremely worked up. Also, he was in the middle of the show right now so Lin Fan was not giving him any face at all.</p><br/><p><em>I just said that this rascal listens to me and then he turns around and makes this kind of post. How could he be so quick to attack me?</em></p><br/><p><em>Relax. Calm down. I can\u2019t lose face here in the middle of a show.</em></p><br/><p>\u201cIt hasn\u2019t been easy for the association to develop to this stage. I can\u2019t just let it get destroyed like this. I, Zhang Guo Shou, have been the Vice-Chairman of the association for decades. Although I\u2019ve retired already, today, for the sake of the future of the association, I have to stop these reforms.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf he still insists on doing things his way, I, Zhang Guo Shou, I will withdraw from the association altogether,\u201d Zhang Guo Shou very sternly said.</p><br/><p>Some of the association members who were watching the show also complied with what Zhang Guo Shou said, immediately posting their comments on Weibo.</p><br/><p>Wang Zhong Fei: \u201cIf he still doesn\u2019t want to change his ways, I\u2019ll also withdraw from the association.\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Li: \u201cThe association can\u2019t just be overturned like this. It hasn\u2019t been easy for us to get this far. If he still insists on these reforms, I\u2019ll withdraw as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>In a short span of time, dozens of members from the association started making noise on Weibo.</p><br/><p>The large majority of the people in the association were old people who were high in seniority as well.</p><br/><p>At the same time, all those people who were together with Zhang Guo Shou in this were definitely going to boycott the event.</p><br/><p>Also, some of the other association members, upon seeing so many people come out and object, also started to think about whether or not they wanted to join them as well.</p><br/><p>After all, this reform had no benefits for them at all. All the effort that they had tirelessly put into the association could all just vanish into thin air.</p><br/><p>As a result, in order to protect their own interests, a protest was necessary.</p><br/><p>However, at that moment, all those people who had been prepared to go with the flow stopped what they were doing. They even started to delete the posts that they had been drafting.</p><br/><p>This was a because they saw that Master Lin had made another post on Weibo and this post had quite a bit of killing power.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan: \u201cI, in the capacity as the Chairman of the association, shall comply with the wishes of the following members who have volunteered to leave the association: Zhang Guo Shou, Wang Zhong Fei, Li Ming, Yang Zhen\u2026 the following members have applied to withdraw from the association and I have agreed to their request. From now on, they will no longer hold any position of power within the association and will no longer enjoy any of the benefits that come with it. If they wish to enter the association again, they will have to wait 1 year before applying and will have to take the examination as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Those few people who had been about to follow the crowd saw this post on Weibo and were dumbfounded.</p><br/><p><em>He must be joking. Is this for real?</em></p><br/><p><em>Zhang Guo Shou is the former Vice-Chairman of the association, how could he just chase him away like that?</em></p><br/><p><em>Could it be that he has no apprehension at all?</em></p><br/><p><em>He is the former Vice-Chairman of the association. He has a very high position in the association. Is the Chairman not afraid that this will enrage people?</em></p><br/><p>In the midst of their thoughts, Lin Fan made another post on Weibo.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan: \u201cIf there is any other member who wishes to leave, please @ me on Weibo. Right now, we are tidying up the association so the slots here are limited. We do require most slots for the people who are really interested in being part of the Chinese Medical Academy.\u201d</p><br/><p>His message in this post was very clear. <em>If you want to leave, quickly leave. Don\u2019t waste my time.</em></p><br/><p>The members who were gathered together looked at each other in dismay. \u201cDo you guys\u2026still want to leave?\u201d</p><br/><p>One of them, who had been very quick to post just now and had gotten his name called out, was completely dumbfounded, \u201cI\u2026 I\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI think I\u2019m going to wait a while first.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI think Chairman Lin said all of that in a fit of rage. Elder Zhang is in such a high position within the association, I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll really get rid of him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019m not going to post anything for now. I\u2019m going to see how things turn out.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I won\u2019t post it either.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>On-site of the programme.</p><br/><p>Zhang Guo Shou sighed in relief after saying his bit. He felt like he had done everything he had to, letting Lin Fan know his stand.</p><br/><p>He was the former Vice-Chairman of the association. So if he were to pull out of the association, it would definitely have a huge impact and as a result, his words should definitely have some weight.</p><br/><p>Then at that moment, one of the guests who were at the scene suddenly stood up.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Zhang, Master Lin has made another post on Weibo. He has accepted your request to leave the association. At the same time, he has also accepted the request of dozens of people to leave the association as well. From now on, you\u2019re not a member of the association anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>A few of the guests on the scene, upon hearing this immediately, whipped out their phones. They were all thoroughly shocked after they checked Weibo.</p><br/><p>Zhang Guo Shou, who was on stage at that moment, was stunned upon hearing that. It was as if he could not believe what he was hearing.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at his phone, then looked at the television screen. After that, he turned the television off and got ready to sleep.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck, you actually tried to threaten me? If you say you want to leave then you can leave. No one is afraid of you. I\u2019ll send all of you guys to your graves.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGoodnight.\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

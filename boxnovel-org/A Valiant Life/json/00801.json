At this moment, a particular piece of news made him a little surprised.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, they lost.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian was puzzled. \u201cWho lost?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cI\u2019m talking about table tennis. Our country lost to Japan. This is f*cking illogical.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s a loss, it\u2019s a loss. Isn\u2019t that how competitions are? It\u2019s only interesting if there are losses and wins.\u201d Fraud Tian didn\u2019t usually pay much attention to table tennis and he felt that this was very normal in a competition.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the news headlines.</p><br/><p>\u2018Asian Championships: Japanese athlete, Zhenping Yiming wins World Number 3, Xu Song.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Chinese table tennis athlete, Bao Fu Zhong is beaten by Japan.\u2019</p><br/><p>Looking at these headlines was eye-piercing.</p><br/><p>Then, he took a look at the comments.</p><br/><p>\u201cChinese table tennis has never lost in the past and it makes people restless. It\u2019s fine to lose once in a while.\u201d</p><br/><p>These comments were very positive. It was indeed not a big deal. However, the following comments were not the same.</p><br/><p>\u201cXu Song was always bad but he still keeps participating in competitions. I think he\u2019s taking backdoors. He ought to be kicked out.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis coach has problems. He has never understood anything but he acts like he does. It\u2019s a f*cking miracle that they\u2019ve managed to win in the past.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cXu Song is really an idiot. He doesn\u2019t usually win but after winning a few times, he became cocky. Now, he has to kneel down.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is rubbish. How embarrassing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s actually a good thing. This will let him know his own shortcomings, so that he can work harder in future.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCan you guys stop scolding him? When he wins, you guys call him Daddy but when he loses, you flame him. No one can keep on winning without losing in sports competitions.\u201d</p><br/><p>The discussions on the Internet were very intense.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan didn\u2019t think too much. He felt that losing once was no big deal but this news was a little exaggerated. It was as if they were putting all the blame on the athletes.</p><br/><p>Then, he went to Xu Song\u2019s Weibo to take a look.</p><br/><p>Indeed, under the pressure of the public opinions, Xu Song had apologized on Weibo.</p><br/><p>Xu Song: I\u2019m sorry to my countrymen who have always supported me. I\u2019ve let you down this time. Because of an issue with my body, I didn\u2019t manage to play to my best ability. However, this is not an excuse. I will accept this lesson and work on my shortcomings. Thank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck off! Just because you lost, you\u2019re saying that you have an issue with your body. Can you look for some other excuse?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHurry up and give your place to more impressive people. You\u2019ve been in your position for too long. Is it even meaningful?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it because you\u2019ve started dating that you\u2019ve spent all your energy elsewhere?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust after you\u2019ve achieved results, you start dating and looking for girls. What scum.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWork hard! I\u2019ll always support you. Losing once is no big deal. Ignore those idiots above.\u201d</p><br/><p>There weren\u2019t many supporters and most of the comments were from haters.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan then posted something on Weibo.</p><br/><p>\u201cWork hard. It\u2019s normal for there to be wins and losses in sports competitions. It\u2019s fine as long as you win it back next time.\u201d</p><br/><p>After this Weibo post was uploaded, it instantly got a reply from Xu Song.</p><br/><p>Clearly, Xu Song had been observing the situation on the Internet the whole time. Especially when he saw the netizens flaming him, he probably felt very bad.</p><br/><p>After all, he was human and his heart wasn\u2019t made of steel. How could he stay unaffected?</p><br/><p>Xu Song: \u201cThank you for your support, Master Lin. I will continue to work hard. I won\u2019t let you all down next time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Because Lin Fan had posted it, his loyal fans naturally kept up the momentum.</p><br/><p>Regardless of whether they had any interest in table tennis or not, they saw that their idol had voiced out his support, so they definitely had to send a wave of support as well, suppressing all those haters.</p><br/><p>Looking at this situation, Lin Fan chuckled. He didn\u2019t mind this at all.</p><br/><p>His fans were all like himself. They were all righteous and they all had forgiving hearts. They couldn\u2019t be compared to those anti-fans.</p><br/><p>But then, he saw another piece of news that made him displeased.</p><br/><p>These were words that the reporters quoted from the Japanese.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe World\u2019s undefeated Chinese team has been beaten stupid by us in this competition, hahaha\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re finally rising up. We\u2019ll brutally beat those Chinese to tears.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet those Chinese people be cocky. Now that they\u2019ve lost, they must feel like crying.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve lost to you all in the past, not because we weren\u2019t as good as you but because we were raising your spirits. Like feeding a pig, we\u2019ve fed you until you\u2019ve become fat and we\u2019ll eat you up in one go.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cZhenping Yiming is amazing! Teach the Chinese a good lesson. Let them know our power.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan pursed his lips. Just after winning once, they were being so unbridled. They were bragging enough to last a lifetime.</p><br/><p>The next day!</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan reached Cloud Street, a phone call came.</p><br/><p>When he saw his phone display, he saw that it was Director Liu. Lin Fan felt that there must have been something that required his help, otherwise, Director Liu wouldn\u2019t have called him.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello, Director Liu, what\u2019s up?\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Liu, who was on the other end of the call, was all smiles as if trying to seduce someone. \u201cMaster Lin, this is the situation. I\u2019ve started a new sports show. This will be the first episode, so I would like to invite you to be a special guest to bring some popularity to our show. Of course, you don\u2019t have to worry. As long as the first episode is good, if you are still interested, you can stay on afterward as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSports show? I don\u2019t know anything about sports,\u201d said Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Director Liu said, \u201cNo problem. You\u2019ll just be a special guest. Just sit there and say a few words occasionally and it\u2019ll be fine. Don\u2019t you know? Your ability to create hype is simply too strong. Please help us out. You will be paid well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan pondered for a moment. Then, he smiled and said, \u201cAlright, since Director Liu has personally asked, how could I reject? As for the pay, forget about it. I\u2019m planning to only go on the first episode.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great!\u201d When Director Liu heard that, he instantly started smiling brilliantly. He felt that Master Lin was really loyal.</p><br/><p>To Lin Fan, he had already received a $20,000,000 appearance fee from Director Liu the last time and it was sufficient. As for this show, he would just go on for one episode as a way of helping them out.</p><br/><p>He would gain a friend and in turn, gain a new path from that.</p><br/><p>They hung up.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian said enviously, \u201cYou\u2019re going on TV again?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan saw Fraud Tian\u2019s jealous expression and raised his head. \u201cYou\u2019re right. I\u2019m going on TV once again. How troublesome. I can\u2019t really stand going on TV so much.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian looked at Lin Fan with jealousy and envy in his heart. Why did no one invite him to go on TV programmes?</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, where\u2019s Elder Dog?\u201d At that moment, Lin Fan realized that Elder Dog had disappeared again. It was only morning and Elder Dog had run off to god knows where.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian said, \u201cI don\u2019t know. He was still here earlier in the morning. How did he disappear in the blink of an eye?\u201d</p><br/><p>To Lin Fan, Elder Dog seemed to go out quite often. Could it be that he was going out to look for females again?</p><br/><p>After giving birth, Sister Hong\u2019s Flowers had recovered and she had been following Elder Dog since then. But looking at Sister Hong\u2019s shop, Flowers was still inside playing around. There was no sign of Elder Dog.</p><br/><p>At this moment, at a certain park.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, this dog is amazing. It actually jumped into the river to save someone.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhose dog is this? It\u2019s way too strong and it can even hold its breath. It went into the water and pulled that person up.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ve seen this dog before. It has been on TV before.\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Dog\u2019s body was soaked and dripping. Then, he shook his body to shake his body dry.</p><br/><p>Looking at the girl who he had saved, he left contently.</p><br/><p>Just after coming out, he had already done a good deed. That was Elder Dog\u2019s style.</p><br/><p>Moreover, he wouldn\u2019t care about whether other people stayed. He would just turn his head and leave.</p><br/><p>There were still more things that he had to do. His righteousness would never disappear.</p></div>\n</div>"}

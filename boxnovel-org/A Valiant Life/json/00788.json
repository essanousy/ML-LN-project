The Ministry of Manpower is involved. It should be settled really soon.\u201d Lin Fan thought about what had happened the day before and was feeling pretty helpless. This matter wasn\u2019t really something that people could resolve with power. These people were experienced and sly. They had many ways to waste time.</p><br/><p>Also, they were experts at pushing the blame around.</p><br/><p>Yesterday, the worker from the Ministry of Manpower asked the real estate developers, people from the construction and labor services companies to meet up for a discussion. They probably didn\u2019t reach any conclusion. They probably just pushed the blame around and said they had no money.</p><br/><p>If they kept claiming that they had no money, what could you do about that?</p><br/><p>Furthermore, another problem was that the migrant workers didn\u2019t sign any labor services contract. They could just deny that they worked for their companies. What could they do about it?</p><br/><p>This involved several million dollars. It was difficult for people to recover the money.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>At the construction company.</p><br/><p>Director Liu was really frustrated. He was asked to be at the Ministry of Manpower and he was being threatened by them.</p><br/><p>However, he really had no money.</p><br/><p>He only received $15 million instead of the agreed sum of $20 million. He used all of the money on the project. If he were to receive the additional $5 million, he would definitely have had enough money to pay the workers.</p><br/><p>Who could he blame? He could only blame the real estate developers. He wasn\u2019t at fault.</p><br/><p>At the labor services company.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t expect Director Liu of the construction company to be so sly. He immediately reduced their funds by $7 million. It was really ruthless.</p><br/><p>The money was being deducted down the chain of command. It was a common thing but this was ruthless. It was practically jeopardizing people\u2019s salaries.</p><br/><p>What could the small amount of money do?</p><br/><p>They couldn\u2019t have done anything with it.</p><br/><p>Therefore, the three parties blamed each other and nobody was willing to pay the workers.</p><br/><p>Especially the labor services company, they claimed that the workers worked without any contract. They also said that they weren\u2019t their workers. If they had signed any contracts, they could present it and they would definitely pay them their salaries.</p><br/><p>However, it was a pity that most of the migrant workers didn\u2019t sign any contracts.</p><br/><p>Leader Wang was helpless in the situation. These bosses were experienced and sly. It was difficult for them to pay the workers honestly. In the end, he could only go to arbitration.</p><br/><p>Initially, he didn\u2019t want to be involved in this problem. However, he had to do something about it after Lin Fan got him involved. Furthermore, the reporters were just waiting to for something to report about.</p><br/><p>On the Internet.</p><br/><p>The reporters were all on Lin Fan\u2019s side. They immediately wrote their scripts when they got back.</p><br/><p>\u2018Mother Earth Real Estate Corporation owed migrant workers their annual salaries.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018The documents have been passed down the chain of command. Why do the migrant workers always face such a problem? Who is supposed to be responsible for this?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018The builders of the city landscapes shouldn\u2019t face such a treatment.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Leader Wang of the Ministry of Manpower is involved in this and he had requested for the developers to pay the workers.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018It clearly isn\u2019t the first time that Mother Earth Real Estate Corporation has delayed payment.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Master Lin has requested payment for his fan, what do you think of that?\u2019</p><br/><p>Many different headlines surfaced on the Internet. In the past, a news like this wouldn\u2019t have received so much publicity. However, it was different this time.</p><br/><p>Because this matter involved Master Lin.</p><br/><p>The netizens.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck, is this matter still unresolved?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin is too good. If you want to have an idol, you have to be a fan of Master Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe real estate developers are shameless. How can they delay the salaries of the migrant workers?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Lunar New Year is almost here. Can they just let them return home for a good holiday?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMother Earth Real Estate Corporation sounds a little familiar. We have a newly developed small district that was also developed by them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe have to support Master Lin for this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The netizens made the atmosphere online really intense. Many of them were flaming Mother Earth Real Estate Corporation.</p><br/><p>Of course, some of them were trying to speak for these real estate developers. However, these comments were soon flooded by righteous netizens.</p><br/><p>At Mother Earth Real Estate Corporation.</p><br/><p>Zhou Guo Sheng and the other directors had drunk quite a lot of alcohol the previous night. He was still recovering from his hangover. When he arrived at his office, his secretary rushed over.</p><br/><p>\u201cDirector Zhou, something bad happened,\u201d the secretary said anxiously.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you so anxious? Even if the sky is falling, you don\u2019t have to be so anxious,\u201d Zhou Guo Sheng reprimanded. Then, he asked, \u201cTell me, what is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>The secretary showed him the news, \u201cDirector Zhou, look at this. The Internet said a lot of bad things about our company. It has sparked a big discussion.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDiscussion? What discussion?\u201d Zhou Guo Sheng looked at the news and his face changed. \u201cWhat is happening?\u201d</p><br/><p>The secretary replied, \u201cThe plot of land that we developed at Chao Hai Road that was previously outsourced but the labor services company didn\u2019t pay the workers. This matter was reported to the Ministry of Manpower.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Guo Sheng furrowed his brows, \u201cThat only involves the labor services company. What does it have to do with us?\u201d</p><br/><p>The secretary said, \u201cBut the people out there don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Guo Sheng waved his hand, \u201cDon\u2019t care about them. Let them do what they want. Tell the labor service company to resolve it quickly. If not, we\u2019ll meet in court.\u201d</p><br/><p>*knock, knock*</p><br/><p>Then, someone knocked on the door.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome in.\u201d</p><br/><p>The manager of the sales department rushed in anxiously, \u201cDirector Zhou, something is wrong. A lot of people are withdrawing from the housing units all over the country. A lot of people are gathering at the sites to ask for salaries.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Guo Sheng replied, \u201cWhat is going on? Why are they asking for their salaries?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, they\u2019re asking on behalf of the workers,\u201d the manager said.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn it, these citizens must really be very free. They\u2019re not even buying any houses and they\u2019re so good at causing trouble,\u201d Zhou Guo Sheng said furiously.</p><br/><p>Of course, he hadn\u2019t felt the seriousness of this problem. After all, the lands that they developed were really well located. They were bound to sell out.</p><br/><p>However, he couldn\u2019t let this matter progress further.</p><br/><p>He had to think of something to resolve this.</p><br/><p>However, what was Master Lin doing? After all, he didn\u2019t offend him at all. What did the development of a small district have anything to do with him? Did he have to be such a busybody?</p><br/><p>Then, Zhou Guo Sheng\u2019s impression of Lin Fan was really affected.</p><br/><p>Ding ding!</p><br/><p>Then, a phone call came.</p><br/><p>Zhou Guo Sheng looked at the phone and his face changed. Then, he waved his hand to ask his secretary and the manager to leave. Then, he picked up the phone and answered politely.</p><br/><p>\u201cChief Lu, may I know why you called?\u201d</p><br/><p>The person on the phone was the director of Lu Corporation. Although Zhou Guo Sheng was powerful, he couldn\u2019t be compared to such a big company. It was a big difference.</p><br/><p>He had been at the same entrepreneurial events with him before. He had always wanted to speak to him but he didn\u2019t have any chance to do so. After all, he wasn\u2019t powerful enough.</p><br/><p>He only managed to save his number with the help of someone.</p><br/><p>They had been working on a project together. Although they were still in the early stages, Zhou Guo Sheng knew that his ranking in the list of most wealthy people would definitely improve if the discussions were successful.</p><br/><p>Lu Li said, \u201cChief Zhou, your company owes the workers salaries. I think this is pathetic. I am feeling doubtful of your company now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Guo Sheng was anxious after hearing that, \u201cChief Lu, please listen to me. This is a misunderstanding. Only the labor services company is involved in this. I am also a victim.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Li replied, \u201cI am not asking about what had happened. Lu Corporation only works with reputable companies. Your Mother Earth company is in shambles now. I called to inform you that we need to discuss our partnership again.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, right. Don\u2019t say that I listened to the rumors. I am good friends with Master Lin. He saved my life. I trust him a lot. You don\u2019t have to say too much. You should understand where I am coming from. Alright, I\u2019ll hang up now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Li didn\u2019t say anything else. He just hung up.</p><br/><p>Zhou Guo Sheng was dumbfounded. He didn\u2019t understand what was going on.</p></div>\n</div>"}

They wanted a certain outcome, a satisfactory outcome.</p><br/><p>If the situation was not resolved, they would not leave the place.</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian brain was becoming a little overloaded. This was Shanghai, not some small town. For this kind of thing to happen, it would have negative repercussions.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, what exactly is going on here?\u201d Liu Xiao Tian rushed into the Welfare Institute while he left the other policemen to maintain the order outside. They couldn\u2019t allow anything bad to happen.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled, \u201cInspector Liu, you\u2019ve been scared into coming over after all.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy dear Master Lin, even at this moment, you\u2019re still smiling. Hurry up and tell me what\u2019s going on. We can\u2019t let any problems break out.\u201d Liu Xiao Tian was feeling stressed. He had not expected so many people to be gathered outside. If anything was to happen, things would be bad.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved his hand, gesturing for Lil\u2019 Fatty to come over. Then, he pointed at Lil\u2019 Fatty. \u201cLil\u2019 Fatty\u2019s relatives want to take him away. I disagreed, so this ruckus started.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian looked at Lil\u2019 Fatty. \u201cIf they\u2019re his relatives, why don\u2019t you let them take him?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cIf those relatives are really doing this for the sake of Lil\u2019 Fatty, I would definitely allow them to take him. But it\u2019s a shame that they aren\u2019t. From what I see, that man has early-stage marrow cancer and he needs a marrow transplant. That\u2019s why he thought of his only nephew. After all, relatives have better compatibility rates.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian was startled and in a bit of disbelief. \u201cIs this true?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled, \u201cYou\u2019ve known me for so long. When have you ever seen me say something that I\u2019m not sure about?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d Liu Xiao Tian nodded, \u201cIf that\u2019s really the case. Then those people are simply swine. However, even if I believe you, the people outside won\u2019t believe you. Moreover, that man would never admit it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said confidently, \u201cNo need to worry about that. I have a plan. But going through this incident, I keep thinking about a question. If, in one or two years, for example, I raise these kids to become geniuses and all those parents who didn\u2019t want to take them suddenly come back for them, what do you think I should do?\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian was silent for a moment. He didn\u2019t really know how to reply.</p><br/><p>\u201cNowadays, there are many things that are fair but not legal or legal but not reasonable. If their own parents come, according to the law, the children should be given to the parents. However, among these children, there are many that were sold off with the consent of the parents.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan didn\u2019t say much else. He patted Liu Xiao Tian on the shoulder and said, \u201cAlright, no need to think too much. It\u2019s about time to resolve this matter.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian nodded. There was a number of children in the Welfare Institute whose parents were still alive and well and they had even been contacted. However, those parents were unwilling to take the children back. According to the law, only children below the age fourteen who have lost their parents and became orphans, are unable to find their parents or, whose parents have special difficulties and are unable to raise them can be adopted.</p><br/><p>These children who had been kidnapped or sold off by their parents were not categorized as abandoned children or orphans. Hence, they could not be adopted.</p><br/><p>The protests outside were getting out of hand. If things weren\u2019t resolved soon, a conflict would probably break out. If that was to happen and people get injured, things would be very bad.</p><br/><p>\u201cDirector Huang and Han Lu, you guys watch over the kids. Inspector Liu and I are going out to resolve this matter,\u201d said Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Director Huang nodded. This situation could only be resolved by Master Lin. They really had no idea what to do.</p><br/><p>He pushed open the metal gates.</p><br/><p>When the crowd outside saw that Lin Fan had come out, their emotions burst out.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s out! Hurry up and release the child!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat you\u2019re doing is immoral!\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian raised his voice and said, \u201cEveryone, quieten down now. Listen to Master Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the crowd outside and then at Wang Cheng Shan and Qiu Yan Lan. \u201cAccording to the law, you two are not Lil\u2019 Fatty\u2019s biological parents so you have no right to come and adopt him. But as his Uncle and Aunt, according to reason, you two are qualified to do so\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Before Lin Fan finished, Qiu Yan Lan knelt down onto the ground once more, wailing emotionally. \u201cMaster Lin, I\u2019m begging you to give us the child. I\u2019m begging you.\u201d</p><br/><p>The crowd\u2019s emotions were stirred up once again. Some of them were starting to become restless and it seemed as if they wanted to do something more drastic.</p><br/><p>However, with so many policemen around, the situation was momentarily suppressed.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the performance by the two of them and couldn\u2019t help but laugh. \u201cAlright. You two have really realistic acting. Wang Cheng Shan, right? Let me ask you, do you have early-stage marrow cancer?\u201d</p><br/><p>When the crowd heard Master Lin\u2019s question, they were stunned. They didn\u2019t quite understand why he was asking this.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Wang Cheng Shan replied firmly after thinking for a moment.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled, \u201cYou don\u2019t? Ask some of the people around whether they know about my identity.\u201d</p><br/><p>Those townsfolk who had been angry with Master Lin became silent. They knew that Master Lin was a Godly Doctor. And not just any godly doctor.</p><br/><p>His identity was no secret. You could even search it up on the Internet.</p><br/><p>The reporters started to talk softly amongst themselves as well. \u201cYeah. Master Lin is the Godly Doctor. He can\u2019t be wrong when it comes to diagnosing illnesses. If he says that this man is sick, then the man is definitely sick. But why won\u2019t this man admit it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Cheng Shan said, \u201cWe\u2019re here to take our nephew. What\u2019s the point of asking all this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shook his head. \u201cInspector Liu, a few months ago, when the children were rescued, you located their families and told them to come and take responsibility for the children, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Inspector Liu cleared his throat and said, \u201cThat\u2019s right. When the children were rescued, we police officers worked for days to find out their identities. The father of this Wang Yang Yang had passed on and his mother had remarried. I have some memory of this. At that time, we found Wang Yang Yang\u2019s mother. But because she had started a new family, she refused to take responsibility for her child. Then, we notified you two but you two refused as well. In just a few months, you two have appeared here again. There must be some hidden motive.\u201d</p><br/><p>The crowd wasn\u2019t stupid. When they heard this, they looked at each other and felt as if there was more to this that they didn\u2019t know.</p><br/><p>Wang Cheng Shan and Qiu Yan Lan\u2019s faces turned pale and green. Then, they said angrily, \u201cYou are spouting nonsense. We didn\u2019t receive any notification. I only found out that Wang Yang Yang was at the Welfare Institute after asking his mother. That\u2019s why we rushed here overnight.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan stood out and said, \u201cAlright. Let me ask you, was it because you couldn\u2019t find a compatible marrow donor after finding out that you had marrow cancer that you thought of this nephew of yours? You\u2019re in such a rush because you want to bring him to the hospital for a check and if he is compatible, you want to extract his marrow to save yourself. Am I right?\u201d</p><br/><p>In an instant, the whole place went silent.</p><br/><p>Everyone gasped.</p><br/><p>Everyone looked at each other. This couldn\u2019t be true, could it?</p><br/><p>If it really was true, then they would have had been standing on the side of two heartless animals and helping them to scold Master Lin. They had been committing a heinous act.</p><br/><p>Wang Cheng Shan\u2019s heart was beating profusely. Then, he raised his voice as he barked, \u201cHow could that be? We would never do something like that. In order to prevent us from taking Wang Yang Yang back, you make up such a ridiculous story. Are you even human?\u201d</p><br/><p>They had to refute.</p><br/><p>Even if they were beaten to death, they would not admit it.</p><br/><p>The crowd was dumbfounded and their minds were in a mess. They didn\u2019t know who to believe anymore. In their hearts, they would rather hope for what Master Lin had said to be false. After all, that would mean that they had been standing on the side of righteousness.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan didn\u2019t want to drag this out any longer. It was a complete waste of time. He opened up the Encyclopedia\u2019s Department Store.</p><br/><p>Light of Truth: 50 Encyclopedic Points. Duration: 10 minutes.</p><br/><p>Exchange.</p><br/><p>He aimed it at Wang Cheng Shan and used it.</p><br/><p>A ray of invisible light shone on Wang Cheng Shan\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cTell us the truth. You want your nephew\u2019s bone marrow to save yourself, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes\u2026you\u2019re right. I have been diagnosed with early-stage marrow cancer and I want his bone marrow to save me.\u201d Wang Cheng Shan couldn\u2019t stop himself from blurting it out.</p><br/><p>In that instant, there was complete silence.</p><br/><p>Qiu Yan Lan looked at her husband stupidly. \u201cYou\u2019ve gone mad. Do you know what you\u2019re saying?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Cheng Shan snarled, \u201cI\u2019m his only Uncle and I\u2019ve gotten early-stage marrow cancer. As my nephew, why won\u2019t he save me? What rights do you have to stop us? Yes, you\u2019re right. I don\u2019t want to take responsibility for him at all but for my own life\u2019s sake, I have to take him back and extract his bone marrow. It won\u2019t take his life, so why can\u2019t I do that? If you don\u2019t want to let him go, I\u2019ll just send him back to you after this is over.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSend him back after this is over\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>This sentence exploded in everyone\u2019s hearts.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck! We\u2019ve been fooled.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow could that be? How could he say that? That means that we\u2019ve been helping the evil-doers. If they take the child away, what would the outcome be?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow can this happen? How can they do this? We\u2019ve been scolding Master Lin all along.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, shame and regret rose in the hearts of the crowd.</p><br/><p>In particular, that reporter, Xiao Jiang, was blushing with shame. She had a look of disbelief on her face. Thinking back to how she had confronted Master Lin, she felt that she was like a clown.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, roars of anger burst out.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck your mom! You dare to lie to us? You animals!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBeat them to death!\u201d</p><br/><p>The crowd had gone mad. They had always been righteous and kind-hearted people but they had not expected to be made use of to scold Master Lin. They simply could not forgive themselves.</p><br/><p>The policemen were angry as well but they couldn\u2019t allow the couple to get beaten up by the crowd. Hence, they could only defend the couple. However, it was inevitable that the couple got hit a few times.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at Liu Xiao Tian. \u201cThe truth has come out. Help us to disperse the crowd. This is a Welfare Institute. It\u2019s better to keep things quiet.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian was still a little dumbfounded. Why did the opposition suddenly say the truth? That turn of events was too quick. However, Liu Xiao Tian nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry, Master Lin\u2026\u201d the crowd apologized sincerely.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan stopped in his tracks and said emotionlessly, \u201cPlease use your brains a little the next time you\u2019re met with an incident like this. Don\u2019t just think that whoever looks more pitiful is right. Now that I think about it, I\u2019m the more pitiful one. I\u2019ve been scolded by you all until now. If not for the fact that you all meant well, I would\u2019ve stomped you guys to death by now. Alright, go on and disperse then.\u201d</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t want to say much else. It was simply a waste of time.</p><br/><p>Reporter Xiao Jiang said shamefully, \u201cMaster Lin, I\u2019m really sorry. I\u2019ve misunderstood you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at her and nodded. Then, he walked back into the Welfare Institute without saying another word.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Xiao Jiang was so anxious that she was close to tears. She realized that she had really been too dumb.</p><br/><p>To Master Lin, using 50 Encyclopedic Points against these people was a f*cking waste. It would\u2019ve been better used if he had just fed a pig with those points.</p><br/><p>However, the things in the Encyclopedia\u2019s Department Store were really not bad. Their powers were great.</p><br/><p>To the crowd, they were afraid that Master Lin had not forgiven them. How could they have been so stupid? Just thinking about this made their faces red with shame.</p><br/><p>If they told other people about this, they would get laughed at for sure.</p><br/><p>Just as the crowd was feeling ashamed, Lin Fan stopped in his tracks. He looked at the couple and said, \u201cOh right, I can actually cure you of your illness. But I don\u2019t want to.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian laughed bitterly as he shook his head. Master Lin had not changed. He would always love provoking others.</p></div>\n</div>"}

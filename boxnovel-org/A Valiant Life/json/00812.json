When he had just arrived in China, he didn\u2019t know what kind of name he wanted to have. At the same time, he wanted a powerful surname. He had been seeing the surname \u2018Wang\u2019 on the news frequently and he felt that this surname was definitely something special. Hence, he gave himself a \u2018Wang\u2019 in his name.</p><br/><p>Those that knew him well addressed him as Elder Wang.</p><br/><p>Each time a Chinese addressed him, they would smile at him. He felt that the Chinese were friendly like the people mentioned in the ancient stories.</p><br/><p>However, what he didn\u2019t understand was that whenever he wanted to stay with a friend, the males would always reject him as if he was a ghost. That left him confused.</p><br/><p>In the end, he found out the reason from his friend. People were afraid of staying with those that had the surname \u2018Wang\u2019. That was because the surname was too powerful and people felt pressured.</p><br/><p>Henry Wang stood before a stall and looked at it. The shop owner had great skills and a lot of tricks. Then, he shook his head because the aroma and looks of the food were too unbearable.</p><br/><p>Perhaps the taste would be amazing as well, however, it was still not as good as what he had dreamed about.</p><br/><p>Was he really not going to find amazing food?</p><br/><p>Those that were awarded the Michelin Star were food from exquisite stalls. However, this situation was pretty scary to those rating the stalls. They had been trying to develop a new scoring matrix to stop awarding Michelin stars to exquisitely designed stalls. What they really wanted to find was something that had an unforgettable taste.</p><br/><p>When he was prepared to leave, a conversation between two Chinese youngsters attracted his attention.</p><br/><p>\u201cSigh, I really want to eat Master Lin\u2019s scallion pancakes but it\u2019s a pity that they\u2019re so difficult to buy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMe too. They only sell ten scallion pancakes every day and the queue is so long. If only he increased the daily limit.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDream on. The taste of Master Lin\u2019s scallion pancakes is really the most unforgettable delicacy in my whole life. As long as I can eat it once, I would be satisfied for the rest of my life.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Henry\u2019s Mandarin was perfect and he could understand what the two Chinese men were talking about. He was stunned.</p><br/><p>Scallion pancake?</p><br/><p>He knew about this delicacy. It was simple and cheap. It was also a filling dish. Of course, it was a snack mainly just used to fill one\u2019s stomach. He felt that it wasn\u2019t worthy of being a well-known delicacy.</p><br/><p>However, he decided to find out about it after seeing the expressions of the two Chinese men. He wanted to find out how delicious it was. How could they crave for it so much?</p><br/><p>\u201cHi, I am Henry. May I know what scallion pancake you guys were talking about earlier?\u201d Although Henry\u2019s Mandarin was good, he had a weird accent and people were bound to laugh when they heard it.</p><br/><p>However, since a Caucasian had asked about it, they had to answer him. \u201cYou don\u2019t know about Master Lin\u2019s scallion pancakes?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. That\u2019s why I asked,\u201d Henry replied.</p><br/><p>The two of them couldn\u2019t take it anymore. Which Chinese class did he go to? Why was his accent so hilarious?</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin\u2019s scallion pancakes of Cloud Street are really famous in Shanghai. As long as you\u2019ve been here for some time, you would know his shop,\u201d a man said.</p><br/><p>Henry was still curious, \u201cIt\u2019s really famous? Is it really delicious?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. It is really delicious. You haven\u2019t eaten it before, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, you should go and try it. As long as you try it once, it\u2019ll let you have an indescribable feeling. The scallion pancake might even be glowing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Henry was stunned.</p><br/><p>Glowing</p><br/><p>\u201cGlowing food? Isn\u2019t that from Chuka Ichiban?\u201d [A Japanese manga] Henry always felt that Chinese people were able to exaggerate their descriptions of a lot of things. He had never seen any food that would glow.</p><br/><p>After discussing further.</p><br/><p>Of course, Henry had been convinced by them. He really wanted to see the glowing scallion pancake for himself. Furthermore, it would even cause him to have an indescribable feeling after eating it.</p><br/><p>Any magical food would make Henry curious about it.</p><br/><p>Of course, he had been cheated a lot of times.</p><br/><p>Previously, a Chinese man introduced him to a delicacy known as the \u2018smelly beancurd\u2019. The one and only time he tried it was a traumatizing experience.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you. I will look for it,\u201d Henry thanked them.</p><br/><p>The two of them laughed after Henry left. Then, they started talking again.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow long do you think he needs to queue for?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. If he\u2019s unlucky, perhaps a month.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, I hope he won\u2019t get chosen so soon. If not, it would be even more difficult for us to get it next time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d</p><br/><p>To some of the people in Shanghai, Master Lin\u2019s scallion pancakes at Cloud Street were insanely scary. Those that managed to buy it on their first try would always think hard about it before deciding if it was worthy of eating it.</p><br/><p>Because once they tried it, they wouldn\u2019t know how long they would have to queue for to try it again.</p><br/><p>At Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laid there leisurely. This time, he felt great after being crowned the hero of the migrant workers.</p><br/><p>Even those praises online made him feel a little embarrassed.</p><br/><p>However, he was spending the Encyclopedic Points a little too quickly. Even though he felt a little wasteful, everything was worth it.</p><br/><p>He had to do it to suppress their cockiness.</p><br/><p>He called Zhao Ming Qing.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, what is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cMing Qing, I have to tell you something.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, go ahead.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI think the foundation materials that I prepared based on Chinese Medicine should receive more attention. It can let every student learn it seriously. What do you think?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing replied, \u201cYes, yes. Teacher, you\u2019re right. Don\u2019t worry. I will test some of the concepts of the foundation materials.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled, \u201cAlright, that\u2019s good. I\u2019ll hang up now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Recently, the increase of his Encyclopedic Points was a little slow. It looked like the Chinese Medicine materials that he had prepared weren\u2019t really well-liked by the students.</p><br/><p>He felt that he had to do something about it. He wanted Zhao Ming Qing to push the students further so that they would work harder. After all, this would help to increase his Encyclopedic Points.</p><br/><p>The Children\u2019s Welfare Institute was also pretty decent. All 365 of the children were really hard working. They had helped Lin Fan to earn quite a number of Encyclopedic Points.</p><br/><p>Of course, the Encyclopedic Points from Chinese Arts and planting were slowly increasing.</p><br/><p>He felt that table tennis seemed like a good game. It could train a person physically and the parents would just have to let the children come out to play so that they would be active. It looked like he had to teach the kids something new so that they could have more fun.</p><br/><p>With their brilliant minds, they would definitely be able to become incredible table tennis players.</p><br/><p>However, the education level of the Children\u2019s Welfare Institute wasn\u2019t built yet. He had to wait for some time before its completion.</p><br/><p>The standards of some of the children\u2019s Chinese Arts had been increasing. The consumption of the Little Intelligence Pill was simply not a joke.</p></div>\n</div>"}

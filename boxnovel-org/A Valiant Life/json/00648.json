There was only one person but now there were two people. Although the tigers have been raised in captivity, any tiger would have a wild side to it.</p><br/><p>The tigers already wanted to attack the man. If not for the gunshots of the air rifle, the man would\u2019ve been dead by now.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s finished\u2026\u201d A zoo worker scratched his head with both of his hands. If people died at the zoo, the zoo would probably have to close down.</p><br/><p>\u201cSave me!\u201d Zhu Shou Jun\u2019s face was filled with tears and mucus. \u201cI know I was wrong and I shouldn\u2019t have evaded payment of the tickets. Save me!\u201d</p><br/><p>If he had known that things would turn out this way, he wouldn\u2019t have dared to jump over the wall. However, it was too late now.</p><br/><p>The other tourists were also stunned in disbelief.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis fella is literally asking for it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow could it be? He just jumped down a platform that\u2019s at least four to five meters high. He seems totally fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs the anesthetic gun here yet? If all five tigers were to attack him at once, the consequences would be unimaginable.\u201d</p><br/><p>The tigers were alarmed when they saw that a stranger had entered their home. They roared and slowly moved towards him. It was as if they could attack him anytime.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan was stunned speechless. She kept screaming in fear. She didn\u2019t expect Brother Lin to jump down to save him.</p><br/><p>She knew that Brother Lin was awesome but he was facing tigers now.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan walked over slowly and calmly. It was just five \u2018small\u2019 tigers, there was nothing to be afraid of.</p><br/><p>Who was he?</p><br/><p>He was the invincible Master Lin.</p><br/><p>However, the situation was a little difficult. The five tigers weren\u2019t really friendly and they were looking at Lin Fan and the other man like they were food.</p><br/><p>\u201cTiger bros, please remain calm and give me some face. Don\u2019t move,\u201d Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>The tourists above were stunned.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn! Is this man insane? He is actually talking to the tigers.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnyone would\u2019ve known that tigers are extremely wild and feisty. I don\u2019t want to think of the consequences of this.\u201d</p><br/><p>The tigers just ignored Lin Fan. They were still being overcome by their wild nature. Tigers would normally scare the hell out of their preys. Hence, they were pretty surprised at Lin Fan who was calm and steady.</p><br/><p>The three tigers who were initially lying down and looking at the man started to get up and walk towards the two of them.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved to them, \u201cHey, you, come to me. Don\u2019t let your back face the tigers. Lean towards me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Shou Jun was scared speechless. Now that someone was talking to him, his jelly legs managed to get himself up and he walked towards Lin Fan slowly.</p><br/><p>The tourists above held their breaths.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat man has stood up!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRemain calm. The anesthetic gun will be here soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe anesthetic gun will be here in at least ten minutes.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Zhu Shou Jun was going to reach Lin Fan, he immediately turned his head around and ran towards Lin Fan. His only hope was to stay close to him. He was simply shocked beyond words.</p><br/><p>The tiger jumped towards him and tore his clothes but he managed to dodge the palm of the tigers. If not, his neck would\u2019ve been ripped apart by now.</p><br/><p>However, when Zhu Shou Jun turned around, one of the tigers charged towards him.</p><br/><p>To the tigers, the moment their prey turned their backs on them, it was the best time to strike.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh! The tiger is going to him!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh my, someone\u2019s going to die!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cQuick, fire the gun! Fire the gun!\u201d</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>The gunshots were being fired but the tigers realized that the guns were useless against them and they just ignored it.</p><br/><p>Zhu Shou Jun\u2019s face turned pale when he heard the screams from the platform. He knew that something was wrong and that he was going to die.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t expect to endanger his life just to save some money. Then, he closed his eyes and waited for the tiger to strike.</p><br/><p>Then, the crowd became quiet and nothing said anything.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Zhu Shou Jun\u2019s eyes were closed and he was in doubt. Could he have died already? The crowd was silent but why was there no pain?</p><br/><p>Then, the crowd on the platform started to gasp after seeing what was happening.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did I just see? How is that possible?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho is this fella? He is so impressive.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a tiger. He actually carried it with one hand?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLook, the tiger\u2019s hind legs look to be struggling and they\u2019re on the ground. It looks pretty painful.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, even the zoo workers were stunned speechless.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan held onto the tiger\u2019s neck with one hand and use the other hand to carry it. The tiger\u2019s body was bigger and its hind legs would still be on the floor if Lin Fan were to carry it.</p><br/><p>\u201cTiger bro, what are you trying to do? Did I allow you to attack us sneakily? You better know your place. If not, I\u2019ll break your head,\u201d Lin Fan reprimanded. He patted the tiger\u2019s head with the other hand furiously and the tiger was stunned.</p><br/><p>Damn!</p><br/><p>He carried the tiger with one hand and whacked the tiger\u2019s head furiously.</p><br/><p>How could that be? That didn\u2019t seem realistic.</p><br/><p>The tiger roared, \u201cDestroy this prey.\u201d</p><br/><p>To others, the tiger\u2019s roar just meant that it was furious. However, Lin Fan understood what the tiger was saying. He immediately replied, \u201cYou\u2019re asking for help to destroy me? I\u2019ll let you have a taste of what\u2019s to come.\u201d</p><br/><p>The other four tigers rushed over when they heard their ally\u2019s request. They couldn\u2019t have just stayed there and watched. They immediately charged towards him.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, those four tigers rushed over.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s doomed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour mum!\u201d</p><br/><p>However, the gasps didn\u2019t last for long. Everyone became silent and some of them even knelt down.</p><br/><p>\u201cMum, I just saw Superman!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCan someone tell me what\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><br/><p>With Lin Fan\u2019s powers, he could flatten the tigers into pancakes with just one blow. However, he thought that it was pretty violent. Furthermore, tigers naturally had a wild nature. How could he blame the tigers for the man\u2019s fault?</p><br/><p>Hence, he decided to be lenient towards the tigers.</p><br/><p>He immediately slapped the tigers and they all fainted.</p><br/><p>Then, he rode one of the tigers, \u201cYou better watch yourselves. If not, I\u2019ll swallow you.\u201d</p><br/><p>The tiger naturally didn\u2019t understand human language but it managed to understand what the prey was saying. When it thought of how the prey was going to swallow it, the tiger was scared.</p><br/><p>*cries*</p><br/><p>The tiger that was being carried by Lin Fan gave up. It was fearful and it didn\u2019t want to be swallowed alive.</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan saw that the tiger started to behave itself, he patted its head gently and said, \u201cNot bad, that\u2019s the way. Now, lie down.\u201d</p><br/><p>As they were facing such a fearsome prey, the other tigers started to be more alert.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan immediately went forward and picked up two tigers. Then, he raised them up and their hind legs were struggling to reach the floor. Their wild eyes started to look fearful.</p><br/><p>\u201cWow\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow can this prey be so strong?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTigers will never be enslaved!\u201d A tiger roared. However, when it saw the eyes of the prey, it lowered its head and whimpered.</p><br/><p>\u201cTigers like us are gentle creatures.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p></div>\n</div>"}

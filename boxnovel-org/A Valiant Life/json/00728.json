The message was clear- it wasn\u2019t that Master Lin didn\u2019t have any fans. It was just that Master Lin\u2019s fans were a little naughtier.</p><br/><p>Huo Jian Xiang patted Lin Fan on the shoulder. He couldn\u2019t help but laugh at thinking about what had just happened. \u201cIt looks like you are quite well received outside. It almost seemed as if the people in the crowd were all your fans.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled in a calm manner, \u201cThat\u2019s nothing really. Wait till you see me at Qing Zhou. The number of fans I have over there is probably a hundred times more than that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Ying Dong and Zhao Li looked at Lin Fan coldly, completely looking down on him.</p><br/><p>However, they were still unconvinced. They never imagined that this brat would have so many fans.</p><br/><p>The online viewers of \u2018The Strongest Heavenly Voice\u2019.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, I just saw Master Lin outside the stadium. It was a little awkward at first, but Master Lin shouting for his fans just killed me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn, you\u2019re so lucky to have gotten the tickets. I can only watch the live broadcast online.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m really here to see Master Lin in action.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMe too. Although I\u2019m a fan of Zhao Li, I would still pick Master Lin any day if I had the choice. Master Lin is more down to earth.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t wait. The live broadcast starts at eight o\u2019clock sharp. I\u2019m excited to see how this will pan out.</p><br/><p>Many viewers were tuned into the live broadcast on TV. Most of them immediately went home after work and stayed under their sheets watching the program, and if their friends had asked them out, they would have declined.</p><br/><p>If they had to choose between having fun outside versus watching Master Lin, they would have chosen Master Lin any day.</p><br/><p>Backstage studio.</p><br/><p>The director and the workers were all getting ready. Everything was ready and they were waiting for the live broadcast to start.</p><br/><p>Since it was the first episode of the first season, the vice-president was at the location. He was extremely anxious- the popularity of the show all depended on the ratings for today.</p><br/><p>Of the four teachers, three of them were veterans in the music scene. Master Lin, on the other hand, had a huge following on the internet and would hence attract a huge crowd of viewers for the show.</p><br/><p>The Shanghai Satellite TV Network would never do a program if it wasn\u2019t going to be profitable. They were willing to spend this much money because they knew that this show was going to be a hit.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe four teachers can go up on stage now,\u201d one of the workers said.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher Huo, let\u2019s go on stage,\u201d Lin Fan said, stopping the conversation that he was having with Huo Jian Xiang. On the other hand, Liu Ying Dong and Zhao Li were ignoring Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Even the workers who were busy at work could tell that the four teachers already had cliques amongst themselves.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, after you,\u201d Huo Jian Xiang said, smiling.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher Huo, you\u2019re the senior here. After you first,\u201d Lin Fan said, standing aside.</p><br/><p>Liu Ying Dong and Zhao Li stood at the back, looking on in annoyance. \u201cWhat\u2019s the problem over there? If none of you are going to go first, we\u2019re going to go first,\u201d Liu Ying Dong said.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan immediately stretched out his hand, blocking both Liu Ying Dong and Zhao Li from moving forward, \u201cNo, it\u2019s not your turn. Let Teacher Huo go first.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll go first then,\u201d Huo Jian Xiang smiled helplessly.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Liu Ying Dong and Zhao Li looked at Lin Fan, their faces green with rage. They wanted so badly to step all over his face.</p><br/><p>After Huo Jian Xiang stepped out, Liu Ying Dong and Zhao Li both snorted as they stepped forward, wanting to cut Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>However, Lin Fan wasn\u2019t going to give them the satisfaction of going first. He immediately stepped forward, \u201cWait, let me go next.\u201d Thereafter, he turned back and swaggered off the stage.</p><br/><p>\u201cDespicable. This guy is just too despicable,\u201d Zhao Li clenched her teeth, saying.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be too anxious. Let\u2019s see how long this guy can bounce,\u201d Liu Ying Dong said.</p><br/><p>Both of them were veterans in the music industry. In their ten over years, they had established themselves as big shots, and this naturally caused them to become more arrogant.</p><br/><p>If juniors who were below then didn\u2019t show them the necessary respect, they would react in anger. However, Liu Ying Dong and Zhao Li were going to take things slow. They wanted to see how long Master Lin could bounce around.</p><br/><p>The four teachers walked onto the stage to the loud applause of the audience. Thereafter, they took their seats in their chairs.</p><br/><p>The director gave a satisfactory nod after seeing the teachers take their positions on stage.</p><br/><p>Thereafter, he gave the next instruction, \u201cAlright, begin the countdown to the live broadcast. The TV presenter should also get ready.\u201d</p><br/><p>All his workers started scrambling. They couldn\u2019t afford to slack off for this program.</p><br/><p>The host of the program was someone that was renowned for hosting shows. He had the reputation of being one of the \u2018Three Big Brothers\u2019 in television hosting- his skills were at the very top.</p><br/><p>Standing in one corner, the TV host took a deep breath after getting the signal. Thereafter, he made his way on stage.</p><br/><p>Numerous families, millions of computers and television sets and countless audience members were all tuned in to the program.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe live broadcast has started.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight on time. I hope there\u2019ll be something interesting later on.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe TV host is on stage.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>TV Host Cui Wei, \u201cA warm welcome to all audience members who are here with us and those watching from home. Welcome to Shanghai Satellite TV Network\u2019s \u2018Strongest Heavenly Voice\u2019 competition happening right here, right now. Before we start, I just want to give a huge shout out to our sponsors Dong Guan Xin Feng Lubricating Oil Company, Jiang Xiao Bai Wine Distillery and\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He continued talking more.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd now, I will introduce our four teachers. Please give a warm welcome to Teacher Huo Jian Yang, Teacher Zhao Li, Teacher Liu Ying Dong and Teacher Lin Fan.\u201d</p><br/><p>Applause!</p><br/><p>The crowd went wild.</p><br/><p>The netizens were avidly discussing while the live broadcast was on.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe teachers in the \u2018Strongest Heavenly Voice\u2019 are really quite something. Shame that Ying Jing isn\u2019t here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHeh, what will she do? She\u2019s just there to occupy space.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t say things like that. Although she has her own problems, she is really skilled when it comes to music. However, I\u2019m really excited to watch her replacement, who is Master Lin. I can\u2019t wait to see him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, Master Lin looks really nervous. He\u2019s shaking his leg uncontrollably.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you guys now? That is a sign of dominance. From what I know, Master Lin\u2019s songwriting abilities are amazing. I just don\u2019t know how he is when he sings.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know about that actually. I\u2019ve never heard him sing before.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, let us welcome our first contestant on stage,\u201d TV Host Cui Wei said.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan sat over there, deep on thought. Should I be a little more outgoing, or should I act a little more low-key? I think it\u2019ll be better to see what happens and react to it. If things get a little more exciting, I\u2019ll definitely have to do more.</p><br/><p>Hao Jiang.</p><br/><p>\u201cSister, what\u2019s so nice about this show? Isn\u2019t it just a few people singing?\u201d Yun Xue Yao\u2019s sister asked, looking uninterested.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to watch, just go and sleep,\u201d Yun Xue Yao looked at Master Lin who was on the screen. However, she got a little annoyed every time the camera panned away from him.</p><br/><p>This caused Yun Xue Yao to be angry. She thought of maybe calling in to ask them to pan the camera at Master Lin only.</p><br/><p>Ever since Lin Fan left Hao Jiang, Yun Xue Yao never stopped thinking about him. Every night before she slept, her thoughts would always wander back to that night where Lin Fan had protected her.</p><br/><p>Sometimes, she would wake up to find that her panties were wet in the morning.</p><br/><p>But that also went without saying that Yun Xue Yao\u2019s physique was a little too sensitive. Even a small thing could get her gushing like a waterfall.</p></div>\n</div>"}

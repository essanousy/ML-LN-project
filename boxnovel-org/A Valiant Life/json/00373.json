His underling by his side said grudgingly, \"Elder Si, we've been humiliated big time.\"</p><br/><p>\"What do you know? Getting humiliated is nothing, as long as we still have our lives,\" scolded Zhao Si.</p><br/><p>The underling said, \"Elder Si, it's not like we don't know people. And Inspector Liu is nothing. We even know the station chief. Why should we be scared of him?\"</p><br/><p>Zhao Si looked at that his underling and said, \"Are you stupid? Don't you know who Inspector Liu is? Go to the police station and ask. Anyone who has half a brain would know. He hasn't been an inspector for a long time but he has people behind him. Even the station chief is not a problem but if we offend Inspector Liu, unless we leave Shanghai, we'll have to bear the consequences.\"</p><br/><p>The underling nodded and said, \"But Elder Si, that Brother Wang or whatever doesn't seem like much. So what if he has money? We have money too. And you know quite a lot of big shots who respect you. Why are you afraid of him?\"</p><br/><p>Zhao Si shook his head in fear. \"What do you know? No matter who we cross, it can't be him. If we cross him, he could play with our lives. You don't know him. If you did, you would understand what I mean. As for those big shots, if this was the past, they would be courteous towards me even if they were even richer. But now, times have changed. They might still call me brother but let me tell you this. They look down on us in their hearts\u2026\"</p><br/><p>To Zhao Si, today's happenings were f*cked up. He could only get bullied and bullied and not do anything about it. Anyone who was met with such a big shot could only bow down obediently.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang, in particular, Zhao Si didn't dare to mess with. The shadow in his heart from the past was too much. He was fearful of Wang Ming Yang. Even now, he knew that Wang Ming Yang had tens of thousands of workers under him. If Wang Ming Yang was angered, he could kill Zhao Si.</p><br/><p>As for Zhang Hui, it was better to just let her handle herself. Just now, when he had swept across the place with his gaze, he had seen many people with money and status. It wasn't a good place to cause trouble.</p><br/><p>Nanshan Children's Welfare Institute.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan glanced at Zhang Hui and said, \"You don't want to do anything?\"</p><br/><p>Zhang Hui looked at Lin Fan and was lost for words.</p><br/><p>Jin Yang, who was at the side, mumbled, \"Sister Zhang\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang spoke, \"Zhang Hui, I know you. Shanghai's powerful lady. Your methods of clinging to influential people are impressive.\"</p><br/><p>\"Chief Wang, I can't look up and face you. I can only lower my head. This time, I admit defeat,\" said Zhang Hui. Even though Zhao Si had been scared away, she wasn't modest.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang laughed coldly and said, \"Even if you admit defeat, it's useless. You didn't provoke me, you provoked my brother. If he doesn't say anything, don't even think of leaving. Don't look at me like that. I know that you have a reputation in Shanghai for having wide connections. You know quite a number of influential people, so let me demonstrate something to you today. See the people behind me? I won't be modest with you. Call any of them and use your connections. I don't care who it is, as long as he dares to care about this situation, we will all do nothing but just stare at him. Do you think anyone will stand by your side?\"</p><br/><p>Zhang Hui looked at Wang Ming Yang. \"Chief Wang, is there a need for that?\"</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang nodded. \"I think it is a must. What do you think, brother?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled and said, \"About that, I think so too.\"</p><br/><p>Zhang Hui didn't know what to say. She knew Wang Ming Yang was a domineering person. He could do whatever he said. If she didn't resolve this matter today, it would cause endless trouble for her in the future.</p><br/><p>Jin Yang was just a celebrity. Although he was popular in society, before all these big shots, he was really useless. At that moment, he was completely silent as he just stood at the side as if he was shocked.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang said, \"Are you still going to rely on your connections? If you are, then stick with it to the end.\"</p><br/><p>Zhang Hui said, \"Chief Wang, one should be merciful in life so that in future, he can benefit from it. Don't go overboard.\"</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang laughed. \"Hehe, who still wants to see you in future? If you don't make use of your connections, then forget it. Don't regret this.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the situation before him. He wasn't interested at all. \"Ming Yang, don't talk so much. Let me handle this.\"</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang nodded. \"It's just a little bit of connections, what's there to be so arrogant about? Brother, your connections are even more than hers and yet you're still so humble.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed as he felt that that was true.</p><br/><p>\"Chief Zhang, this celebrity little brother of yours had his clothes torn by me. You were slapped by me as well. If you have any thoughts, then say them out now. I'm a reasonable man. I don't ever bully others, especially not women,\" said Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>\"I admit defeat,\" said Zhang Hui. She knew that this matter couldn't be resolved by herself.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved his hand and said, \"Don't. No one is forcing you, why would you admit defeat? If you have any unhappiness, then say so. I can definitely satisfy you. Of course, other than apologizing to you or letting you slap me back, anything else shouldn't be a problem.\"</p><br/><p>Zhang Hui said, \"I want to leave now. Is that alright? I admit defeat this time. Take it as our bad luck.\"</p><br/><p>At that moment, Lin Fan looked over at Jin Yang and said, \"Superstar, do you have any thoughts?\"</p><br/><p>Jin Yang had already lost his overweening attitude from before. He lowered his head. \"No, no\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"No?\" asked Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>\"Yes.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded contently. \"Alright then. Scram right now.\"</p><br/><p>Zhang Hui looked at Lin Fan, Wang Ming Yang and the rest. Then, she turned and left. She had endured this for long enough.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang said, \"Brother, you're just letting her go like that?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said helplessly, \"If I don't let her go, what could I do? I've already hit them and scolded them. Am I supposed to ask her to stay for dinner? Today's not suitable for causing any more trouble.\"</p><br/><p>\"Haha\u2026\" Wang Ming Yang laughed. \"Alright. Let's go inside. I wonder what this Zhang Hui will do. Surely, she will take revenge. After all, this woman is petty and vengeful. But anyway, it won't be anything big. It'll just be a small quarrel, nothing could happen.\"</p><br/><p>But when they went into the house.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was surrounded by the shop owners. They were all asking what on earth had happened but Lin Fan didn't know how to reply to them. He just stood there. The matter had already been resolved and it hadn't been a big conflict. What was there to say?</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian came to Lin Fan's side and said, \"If that Zhao Si comes to Cloud Street to cause you trouble, call me. I'll resolve it for you. But I don't think he will dare to do that.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan patted Liu Xiao Tian on the shoulder. \"Let's not think about all this. Later on, go and put on a performance for the children. You're a policeman, you have to put on a good show for them.\"</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian laughed. \"Alright, no problem. Leave it to me.\"</p><br/><p>Time passed quickly and it was six in the evening. The twentieth commemoration day was over. Everyone had taken quite a number of photos. This event, to everyone, was very rewarding.</p><br/><p>And to Lin Fan, his reward was actually the biggest.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

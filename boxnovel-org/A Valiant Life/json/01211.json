You\u2019re a good person. Please, let me go. I can\u2019t go to the police. I can\u2019t!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo! I didn\u2019t even do anything! You don\u2019t have proof, how can you arrest me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yang Dong was pale with fear. Things had gone horribly wrong and he was completely lost in fear.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan immediately flagged a taxi and shoved Yang Dong into the car. Then, he told the little girl to sit in front.</p><br/><p>\u201cSir, take us to the police station.\u201d</p><br/><p>The driver didn\u2019t notice anything at first. But suddenly, he realized that something wasn\u2019t right.</p><br/><p>There were a few words he heard that caught his attention.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, I\u2019m begging you. Let me go!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t dare to do it again. Please don\u2019t take me to the police!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, I can\u2019t be exposed. Otherwise, I\u2019ll be done for. I\u2019m begging you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is only my first time. It\u2019s really my first time\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>His face was covered in tears, and his mucus was flowing as he begged Master Lin to let him go. Otherwise, his life was going to end.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cFirst time? Don\u2019t you know what I\u2019m capable of doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>He hadn\u2019t expected this guy to be so crafty and say that it was his first time.</p><br/><p>The driver asked, \u201cMaster Lin, what did this guy do? Could it be that he was trying to sell this little girl?\u201d</p><br/><p>The driver wasn\u2019t overly excited. Even though Master Lin was famous now, it was still easy to find him. One just had to visit Cloud Street to find Master Lin.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat he did was even worse than human-trafficking,\u201d said Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>The driver didn\u2019t realize what it was at first. However, from what Yang Dong had said, he managed to get a rough idea. Then, his face turned stern. \u201cMaster Lin, did he\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t say it in the end. After all, it would have a bad influence on the little girl.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, your guess is right. That\u2019s why I have to take him to the police. Furthermore, it\u2019s not his first time. He\u2019s done it lots of times,\u201d said Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>When the driver heard that, his face turned red in anger. He was a father himself, and he hadn\u2019t thought that such people still existed.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat a piece of scum. This kind of person should be taken to the police. How old is this girl? Twelve? Thirteen? What kind to scum would do such things?\u201d</p><br/><p>The driver started scolding him angrily. If he hadn\u2019t been driving, he would have personally taught this scum a lesson.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Yang Dong realized that begging for mercy wouldn\u2019t work. He wanted to jump out of the car. But just as he tried to open the door, he realized that it was locked.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph. You thought you could jump out? I\u2019ve already locked the door. Let\u2019s see what you can do,\u201d growled the driver.</p><br/><p>Yang Dong\u2019s eyes were red. \u201cAre you trying to make me die?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shook his head. \u201cWe\u2019re not trying to make you die. If a person does something wrong, he has to face up to it. And you have to make it up to everyone.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to go down fighting!\u201d Yang Dong raised his fist and threw it towards Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got guts.\u201d Lin Fan laughed. This was the first time someone dared to make a move against him. Right now, there was no one who didn\u2019t know about his strength. Furthermore, this Yang Dong\u2019s fist was weak and powerless. It was useless.</p><br/><p>Quickly and effortlessly, Lin Fan suppressed Yang Dong and held him against the seat.</p><br/><p>The driver looked in the mirror. \u201cMaster Lin, should I stop the car? I\u2019ll let you teach this scum a lesson.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cNo need for that. Let\u2019s go straight to the police station.\u201d</p><br/><p>The driver said, \u201cAlright. This kind of person should be punished. He seems so refined, but he\u2019s actually just scum. If Master Lin had not exposed him, bad things would have happened.\u201d</p><br/><p>But when the driver saw that the little girl next to him wasn\u2019t talking, he was curious. \u201cMaster Lin, why isn\u2019t this girl crying or making any noise?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cI\u2019ve hypnotized her.\u201d</p><br/><p>When the driver heard that, he was instantly stunned. He hadn\u2019t thought that Master Lin would have such an ability. If he didn\u2019t see it for himself, he wouldn\u2019t dare to believe it.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn. I have to go faster. This scum must be taken to the police quickly.\u201d</p><br/><p>The driver steadied himself. The most important thing was safety. Speed came second. He was already getting impatient. He wanted to take this person to the police station immediately.</p><br/><p>However, he didn\u2019t take any photos, nor did he ask too much. After all, this little girl was young. If he shared this on his social media for others to flame this scum, he was afraid that the little girl would be affected. Hence, he resisted.</p><br/><p>Very soon, they reached the police station.</p><br/><p>When Yang Dong saw the police station, he was dazed. He was in despair.</p><br/><p>He knew that he was done for. He was beyond hope.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Yang Dong turned to Master Lin. \u201cI only have one request. Please put a hood over my head.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Lin Fan looked at him, then grabbed a transparent plastic bag and placed it on his head before pulling him out of the car.</p><br/><p>The plastic bag made no difference at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow much for the ride?\u201d Lin Fan took out his wallet to pay.</p><br/><p>The driver immediately waved him off. \u201cMaster Lin, there\u2019s no need to pay. If it\u2019s you, how can I accept your money?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan rebutted, \u201cNo. I have to pay you. This is hard-earned money.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSigh. Master Lin, there are more important matters right now. How can you think of all this? Just pay me once you\u2019re done. I\u2019ll wait for you,\u201d said the driver.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d Lin Fan thought that was fine. Then, he dragged Yang Dong into the police station with Li Xiao Xiao next to him.</p><br/><p>However, as they walked to the police station, the driver stepped on the gas and left.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis\u2026\u201d Lin Fan felt helpless. He hadn\u2019t expected the driver to leave without taking his money.</p><br/><p>When a police officer passing by saw Lin Fan, he was curious. \u201cMaster Lin, what\u2019s the matter?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan pointed at Yang Dong. \u201cThis guy committed a crime. I caught him and brought him here. Is your Chief Liu here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe is. I\u2019ll inform him immediately.\u201d The police officer ran into the station. He knew that it wasn\u2019t a small matter since Master Lin had come. It had to be pretty serious.</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan and the rest were about to step into the police station, Yang Dong became completely paralyzed, and he laid on the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t want to go in. Master Lin, I\u2019m begging you, let me go. I\u2019ll kneel down to you. I can\u2019t go in!\u201d Yang Dong cried. His legs had gone completely soft.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the miserable Yang Dong and couldn\u2019t help but laugh. Then, he shouted towards the police station. \u201cWe\u2019ll need a few guys to carry this guy in.\u201d</p><br/><p>The police officers were very familiar with Master Lin. Then, several buff police officers lifted Yang Dong by his limbs and carried him in.</p><br/><p>They didn\u2019t have to ask what Yang Dong had done. They would find out soon.</p><br/><p>Master Lin was the bane of all criminals. Although he had not arrested any criminals for a while now, they still trusted Master Lin very much.</p><br/><p>Especially since there was a little girl by his side, they knew that it was no small matter.</p><br/><p>And seeing that man in complete fear, they knew that it was a big matter.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

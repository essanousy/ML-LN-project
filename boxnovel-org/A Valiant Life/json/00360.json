The hospital exit was right in front of him. He wanted to leave as soon as possible. The surgery had been a success and he was in a good mood. After all, he had helped to save someone with his own ability and that felt great.</p><br/><p>\"Hey, something's wrong.\" Then, Lin Fan stopped walking. The hospital security suddenly blocked all the exits of the hospital and all the cars that were entering or leaving the hospital had to be checked.</p><br/><p>They had received the news that someone had pretended to be a doctor and entered the operation room. It was a serious offense and they didn't dare to take it lightly.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan wore a mask and was thinking about how to leave the hospital. Just as he was thinking about it, the security officer saw Lin Fan and pointed at him. \"The one wearing a mask, please stand right there.\"</p><br/><p>\"D*mn, he spotted me? No way, they've never seen me before. How would they know?\" Lin Fan looked around curiously and realized that nobody else was wearing a mask. It was too obvious.</p><br/><p>The security spoke to the walkie-talkie, \"There's someone at the south gate wearing a mask.\"</p><br/><p>\"Stand right there!\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan immediately ran away. He ran extremely quickly and the entire group of security officers chased after him. \"Stand still! Stand still!\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked around and tried to find a place to escape. The surrounding wall of the hospital wasn't high and it looked like he could only jump over it.</p><br/><p>Those reporters who were stuck at the entrance were discussing amongst themselves. They were waiting for the final outcome. Then, they heard a commotion and turned to look.</p><br/><p>The security officers were chasing after him. \"Stand still! Stop right there!\"</p><br/><p>The reporters started to discuss it.</p><br/><p>\"What's happening with that man?\"</p><br/><p>\"I don't know. Why are the security officers chasing after him? But this guy is running so quickly.\"</p><br/><p>Then, someone shouted, \"The person that pretended to be a doctor escaped via the window. He is wearing a mask. If anyone of you sees him, please help to arrest him!\"</p><br/><p>\"D*mn, a masked man. That's him!\"</p><br/><p>The reporters were enraged. \"This fella disguised as a doctor and killed the girl. We have to arrest him and beat him up!\"</p><br/><p>\"F*ck his mom. It's the first time I've been so angry.\"</p><br/><p>\"D*mn it, this fella is running too d*mn quickly. Does he have four legs or something?\"</p><br/><p>Then, Lin Fan was cursing about his life. What were these people doing? He hadn't even offended them. Why did they chase after him? There were some reporters who were chasing him with their video cameras while others placed their cameras down and chased Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>\"Didn't expect the mask to give me away,\" Lin Fan was cursing himself. Then, he immediately jumped over the wall and escaped.</p><br/><p>\"D*mn, the fella ran away.\"</p><br/><p>\"Let's jump over it.\"</p><br/><p>\"We can't let him escape. We have to arrest him no matter what.\"</p><br/><p>\"How do we catch him? He runs so quickly. We can't even catch up to him.\"</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Outside.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was panting heavily. It seemed like a joke. If it hadn't been for his supersonic running speed, he'd have been arrested and beaten up. It was a scary thought.</p><br/><p>Even if the matter would eventually settle down, it wouldn't change the fact that he'd be beaten up. However, it wasn't likely to happen since his Ba Gua Zhang was formidable.</p><br/><p>Anyway, he was safe now.</p><br/><p>However, there were so many tricks that they could come up with in the city. He had to be careful. He immediately walked through some small alleys. Nanjing didn't seem like a place he could stay any longer. He had to move away.</p><br/><p>It was his second city and it wasn't that he didn't want to stay any longer. He had no choice but to leave.</p><br/><p>As for the third city, he hadn't thought of it yet. He wanted to go to the train station and find a decent place where he could go.</p><br/><p>At the hospital.</p><br/><p>The director was at home as he was on leave. Suddenly, the hospital called him and said that someone had disguised as a doctor and operated on a patient. This shocked him and he immediately rushed to the hospital.</p><br/><p>It was a big piece of news and if something were to happen, he'd definitely lose his job.</p><br/><p>When he reached the hospital, he heaved a sigh of relief when he heard that no lives had been lost.</p><br/><p>He was especially stunned when he heard that someone had disguised as a doctor and operated on a girl. When he heard that the surgery had been a success and the girl had suddenly recovered, he was flabbergasted.</p><br/><p>The police came too.</p><br/><p>The matter was a grave and illegal one. The government would definitely look into this. Although there had been cases of people disguising as doctors in big hospitals before, this case involved someone charging into the operation room. It was something they had never seen before. Hence, the police were investigating this too. They wanted to find out who the culprit was.</p><br/><p>In the meeting room.</p><br/><p>\"Inspector Yang, this is Doctor Mao,\" the director introduced.</p><br/><p>Inspector Yang was a middle-aged man and he looked extremely experienced. \"Doctor Mao, could you elaborate on what happened earlier?\"</p><br/><p>Doctor Mao couldn't say anything. He didn't even know what had happened.</p><br/><p>The surrounding policemen all had their brows furrowed. They felt that the culprit was an extremely experienced one.</p><br/><p>The nurses didn't know what to say. They hadn't noticed much in the operation room as they had been focused on the surgery itself. Who would have thought about the identity of the doctor?</p><br/><p>Some of them had felt that the doctor's eyes seemed a little different and he looked taller. Although they had been doubtful, they hadn't thought much about it. The situation had been too difficult for them to think twice. Each step had to be done quickly and they hadn't even had much time to talk.</p><br/><p>If they had spoken nonsense in the operation theatre, who would be responsible if something happened? Themselves?</p><br/><p>Doctor Mao said, \"Director, I suggest we look at the video recording first. Perhaps we will find something.\"</p><br/><p>The director nodded. \"Alright.\"</p><br/><p>All the experts were in the meeting room and even the parents of the little girl were there. They were extremely grateful for the mysterious doctor. Although he had disguised as a doctor, he had also saved her life.</p><br/><p>Inspector Yang told his subordinate to play the recording. He was focused on the video playback. He had so many years of experience and he had sharp eyes for detail.</p><br/><p>This was the video recording of the operation theatre.</p><br/><p>\"This is the man that disguised as Doctor Mao. He just appeared and the nurses didn't notice it,\" the director said.</p><br/><p>As the surgery continued, the experts from the hospital were stunned.</p><br/><p>\"His skills are so good.\"</p><br/><p>\"Yeah, look at the most difficult part. It looked so simple to him and his actions seem much smoother than ours.\"</p><br/><p>\"Hey, I can't think of why the patient's conditions were so stable during the operations. That procedure just now was an extremely critical one and it would definitely have caused instabilities.\"</p><br/><p>The experts had initially wanted to see what had happened but they were stunned by the surgical procedures.</p><br/><p>Even Doctor Mao was stunned. That was too awesome.</p><br/><p>The director gasped, \"A genius\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Inspector Yang just looked at the screen and wrote down things in his notebook. It was as if he was trying to model the man's physical appearance and record some small details.</p><br/><p>After finishing the video.</p><br/><p>The expert professors gasped, \"That was a textbook grade surgical example.\"</p><br/><p>\"However, what were the three needles at the end for? What good would it have brought to this patient?\"</p><br/><p>\"The patient is still undergoing tests. We'll know when the results are out.\"</p><br/><p>Then, a Chinese medicine doctor gasped excitedly, \"I know! It's a Chinese medicine treatment.\"</p><br/><p>Everyone was stunned. \"You know the reasoning behind it?\"</p><br/><p>The Chinese medicine doctor replied, \"I don't know that.\"</p><br/><p>Everyone was speechless. \"...\"</p><br/><p>Don't say anything when you don't know what's going on.</p><br/><p>...</p><br/>\n</div>"}

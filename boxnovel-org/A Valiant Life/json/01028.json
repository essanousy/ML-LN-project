After all, he had known about this influenza and still come to the clinic to work. He had already prepared himself mentally beforehand.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy head hurts.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ma Yong woke up from the bed and rubbed his head. Suddenly, his hand stopped halfway and his eyes gaped wide open as if in disbelief.</p><br/><p>The previous day, he had been feeling dizzy and his whole body had been drained of energy. But now that he woke up, he suddenly felt as if his body was filled with energy and his head was a lot clearer.</p><br/><p><em>It was effective. It was really effective.</em></p><br/><p>Without hesitation, he put on his clothes and got off the bed. He raised his voice as he pushed open the door, \u201cIt\u2019s been conquered. The influenza has been conquered! I\u2019m well now!\u201d</p><br/><p>When he came out, those people who had taken the medicine the previous day had already gathered in the clinic.</p><br/><p>Niu Da Ming was one of them. As Huang Yun Town\u2019s Mayor, if he recovered, he would be able to control the situation in the town as he was more familiar with it.</p><br/><p>Li Chong basically stayed there every day. At night, when he was tired, he would rest in the car. The quarantine was managed by two shifts of people. One shift was at night while the other was in the morning.</p><br/><p>They believed that that the townspeople wouldn\u2019t try to escape but they were afraid that there would be fearless people who would sneak into the town and then sneak out again. If that were to happen, the influenza would be brought outside and it would be terrible.</p><br/><p>Niu Da Ming went to the vehicle at the entrance of the town and yelled, \u201cThe influenza has been conquered! I\u2019m well. My body is well!\u201d</p><br/><p>When his voice rang out, Li Chong, who had been sleeping in the car, suddenly woke up and got off the car. He looked over at the town entrance. When he saw Niu Da Ming standing there looking full of vitality, he was completely stunned.</p><br/><p>Then, he jumped up in excitement. He pointed in front and shouted to the people around him, \u201cLook, he\u2019s fine now!\u201d</p><br/><p>His expression was one of elation. It was as if he was about to cry tears of joy.</p><br/><p>As a leader in the county, he faced a lot of pressure. After all, Huang Yun Town was under their jurisdiction. When this happened, everyone had been tense and nervous. If it were to spread outside, it would have been a huge issue.</p><br/><p>Hearing that the influenza sufferers had recovered, how could he not be excited?</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, okay. I\u2019m going to contact the higher-ups now,\u201d Li Chong yelled. Then, he thought about it and felt that there was no need to fear. He immediately crossed over the barricade and ran in.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, what\u2019s the prescription? I\u2019ll report to the higher-ups now and get them to bring some medicine over,\u201d said Li Chong.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled and took out the prescription. \u201cHere. They\u2019re all Chinese medicine. Get the higher-ups to bring the medicine here quickly and bring more people to help to brew the medicine.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Chong did not hesitate at all. He immediately passed the information to the higher-ups. At such an important moment, he had to inform the leaders quickly and get them to send more people over.</p><br/><p>In the research lab.</p><br/><p>A group of specialists had been researching for days and nights. This period of time had been like a race against death. They couldn\u2019t relax for a single second.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve discovered something but it isn\u2019t the most important thing. This virus originated from animals,\u201d a specialist shared his analysis.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay. Right now, the most important thing is to quickly solve this issue. We don\u2019t have much time left.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMmm. We\u2019re working on it. I believe that with our combined efforts, we will definitely solve this completely.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, a person in charge entered the research lab.</p><br/><p>The specialists who walked past him all nodded and greeted him, \u201cDirector Huang.\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Huang nodded. He was in a very good mood and he couldn\u2019t help but quicken his footsteps. When he saw through the glass window that the specialists were still researching, he spoke into the microphone next to him.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, everybody stop. There\u2019s no need to keep researching.\u201d</p><br/><p>When the specialists who were researching heard that, they were startled and the group leader didn\u2019t bother about it. He replied, \u201cHow could we stop researching? We\u2019re about to get results. We just have to analyze the components of this virus and we\u2019ll definitely be able to find a way to treat it.\u201d</p><br/><p>The surrounding specialists looked at the group leader and gasped in their hearts. Group Leader Yang was under quite a lot of pressure and he worked very hard.</p><br/><p>Director Huang said, \u201cThere\u2019s really no need to research anymore. This influenza has already been resolved.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>All the specialists were shocked. They were in disbelief.</p><br/><p>\u201cDirector Huang, did another research lab conquer it?\u201d someone asked. However, they felt that it was strange. Besides them, which other research lab would research this? After all, the sick person had been discovered here.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo,\u201d replied Director Huang. After some pondering, he decided not to hide anything. \u201cShanghai\u2019s Master Lin personally went to Huang Yun Town and developed the prescription over there.\u201d</p><br/><p>When these words were said, everyone was dazed.</p><br/><p>Group Leader Yang was particularly in disbelief as he said, \u201cHow could that be? We have so many people researching here but we haven\u2019t found the cure. How could he do it by himself?\u201d</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t dare to believe this because it was way too unreal. Then, he said hurriedly, \u201cThat\u2019s not right. He said that it has been developed but it hasn\u2019t been through testing. How would he know if it is successful?\u201d</p><br/><p>The surrounding specialists saw that Group Leader Yang had such a drastic reaction and they understood it. He didn\u2019t want to lose to that Master Lin who was often said to be godly on the Internet.</p><br/><p>After all, Master Lin was the first recipient of the Nobel Prize in Medicine in the country and he had relied on Chinese medicine.</p><br/><p>To those who didn\u2019t think highly of Chinese medicine, it had been a huge blow.</p><br/><p>Director Huang thought for a moment before saying, \u201cMaster Lin just reached Huang Yun Town yesterday. And he already developed the prescription yesterday but because he was testing the effectiveness of the medicine, he waited until today. There have been over ten patients in Huang Yun Town who have recovered after taking the Chinese medicine. The city hospital\u2019s main troops have already gone over to Huang Yun Town. I came here to inform you all. You\u2019ve worked hard during this period of time. You may go back to rest now.\u201d</p><br/><p>When the crowd heard this, their jaws dropped as they stared blankly. <em>What did Director Huang just say?</em></p><br/><p><em>Master Lin only reached Huang Yun Town yesterday.</em></p><br/><p><em>And he developed the prescription yesterday too.</em></p><br/><p><em>He only announced it today because they had been testing it. How can that be? We have so many people and we couldn\u2019t even find the cure after researching for so long.</em></p><br/><p><em>Could it be that even all our combined efforts don\u2019t even amount to Master Lin alone?</em></p><br/><p><em>That\u2019s too big of a gap! He just reached yesterday and he developed the prescription on the same day. What kind of medical ability must he have to be able to do it so quickly?</em></p><br/><p>*Clatter!*</p><br/><p>Group Leader Yang dropped the equipment from his hands. His face was blank. It was as if he couldn\u2019t accept this reality.</p><br/><p><em>How can it be? Are we really so far apart from Master Lin?</em></p><br/><p><em>I can\u2019t accept it!</em></p><br/><p>Directo Huang looked at Group Leader Yang and sighed. Actually, he wanted to say that comparing oneself to others would only drive one mad.</p><br/><p>This time, Master Lin had used his exquisite medical abilities to let the world know the meaning of terror.</p></div>\n</div>"}

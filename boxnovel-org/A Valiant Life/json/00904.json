The matter had already happened. He didn\u2019t want to make a big deal out of it since it was time-consuming but those people couldn\u2019t just bully others like that.</p><br/><p>Now that they wanted him to treat their leader\u2019s illness, they had to provide a reasonable explanation. How could they resolve it so easily?</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing sneakily looked at his teacher. He knew that his mentor clearly bore a grudge due to the incident. If not, he wouldn\u2019t have rejected the request.</p><br/><p>Although they hadn\u2019t made things difficult for his teacher, his teacher was doing all this because of him.</p><br/><p>When Zhao Ming Qing thought of that, he was so touched that he felt like crying.</p><br/><p>\u201cMing Qing, you have a fish on your hook!\u201d Lin Fan realized that Zhao Ming Qing\u2019s fishing rod was shaking. It was clear that there was something on his hook.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-2\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing immediately reacted to it. He pulled his fishing rod out of the water and smiled when he saw the fish. \u201cThis is a pretty big fish. It\u2019s at least 2kg.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan took retrieved his fishing rod and wanted to stop fishing for the time being. He wanted to take a break as he didn\u2019t want to show his disciple his angling skills.</p><br/><p>The things that he managed to catch were bizarre and it would be crazy for him to do that repeatedly.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Ma Jun Guo went to do a search on the Internet after the phone call. He had heard of Master Lin\u2019s name before and it was because Elder Zheng had mentioned his name before.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t usually read the news. Even if he did, he would be looking at the news channels to find out about the country\u2019s affairs.</p><br/><p>As for other news, he usually didn\u2019t read them. In the eyes of youngsters, it could be said that he was living in another world.</p><br/><p>As a result, he didn\u2019t know the different celebrities in the entertainment industry.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-3\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>When he was reading an article, Ma Jun Guo was stunned.</p><br/><p>He conquered <em>leukemia?</em></p><br/><p>Ma Jun Guo hadn\u2019t known about it at all and he was really curious about it. He immediately did further research about it. After reading the news, he was dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>The person that had conquered leukemia was indeed Master Lin.</p><br/><p>He had used Chinese medicine to conquer it. Ma Jun Guo felt that it was impossible. However, he still continued reading about it.</p><br/><p>The fact that Master Lin had publicized the prescription made him respect Master Lin a lot.</p><br/><p>After all, the prescription was worth millions of dollars. He was really in admiration of Master Lin\u2019s generosity to reveal it to the public.</p><br/><p>He continued reading.</p><br/><p>Gradually, he became confused. It didn\u2019t seem like it had anything to do with him.</p><br/><p>Why did Master Lin dislike him?</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-4\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>The news about Zhao Ming Qing having his appointment removed at Shanghai\u2019s Chinese Medical Academy seemed like the only matter that could result in that. However, he felt that it was a normal occurrence.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t understand it and he decided to call Elder Zheng.</p><br/><p>Zheng Zhong Shan smiled when he saw Elder Ma\u2019s call. He thought that he had finally understood the matter and picked up the phone.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Ma, do you understand the situation now?\u201d Elder Zheng asked.</p><br/><p>Ma Jun Guo asked curiously, \u201cNo, Elder Zheng, please guide me. I read the news and I don\u2019t feel like there\u2019s a problem. Why does Master Lin hate the Health Department so much?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zheng Zhong Shan was stunned. \u201cYou\u2019re so careless. Are you faking it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ma Jun Guo really didn\u2019t understand it. \u201cElder Zheng, just tell me. I really can\u2019t figure it out. You have to tell me how I offended a kid like him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLook at you. You said the wrong thing again. What do you mean by \u2018kid\u2019? Elder Lin is not a kid. He is a capable man. If Elder Lin heard that, you would\u2019ve offended him again.\u201d Elder Zheng was really helpless. He felt that ever since Elder Ma had retired, his brain had stopped working.</p><br/><p>Elder Lin was a kid?</p><br/><p>Someone who would say that was probably someone that hadn\u2019t interacted with Elder Lin before. It had probably been said because of his age. However, this matter wasn\u2019t something that could be resolved by looking at one\u2019s age.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Ma, let me tell you about Elder Lin before I tell you what happened,\u201d Zheng Zhong Shan said.</p><br/><p>Ma Jun Guo was stunned and curious. He didn\u2019t know why Elder Zheng was speaking about a man in his twenties in the same regard as himself. It was weird.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-5\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Then, Elder Zheng did a search on the Internet. There was clear information about Elder Lin on the Internet. After looking at it closely, it was really terrifying.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet me tell you this. Elder Lin\u2019s specialties are insane. You should know about the ten most eye-catching Chinese art pieces in the museum, right? Those were drawn by Elder Lin. He is definitely the best Chinese artist ever. Furthermore, he is an expert in Martial Arts and he also conquered anorexia, leukemia, and\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ma Jun Guo was stunned after hearing Elder Lin\u2019s achievements.</p><br/><p>He hadn\u2019t expected Elder Lin to be so incredible.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s true, Master Lin is indeed extraordinary.\u201d Ma Jun Guo was shocked that Master Lin was so capable at such a young age.</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, you should tell me what happened. I still don\u2019t understand it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zheng Zhong Shan didn\u2019t want to beat about the bush. He immediately said it, \u201cZhao Ming Qing is Elder Lin\u2019s disciple. He was involved in developing the prescription to cure leukemia. The Internet said it really clearly. Because Master Lin revealed the prescription to the public and didn\u2019t pass it to the Health Department, your department attacked his student for it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey put it in a nice way and said that it was to allow Chinese medicine to progress. But can\u2019t they see how old he is? How could he have the energy to start over? Do they really want him to die of fatigue? It was clearly a demotion but they kept referring to it as a huge responsibility. Do you believe that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ma Jun Guo furrowed his brows after hearing that. He finally understood the matter. He thought about it and realized that there was a problem.</p><br/><p>However, the matter had been finalized. He knew that he couldn\u2019t do anything about it. After all, it involved the Health Department.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-6\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Zheng Zhong Shan added, \u201cHow are you going to resolve it? It all depends on you. If you don\u2019t give him a reasonable explanation, nothing\u2019s going to change. You should know about your condition. I have to warn you that, besides Elder Lin, nobody can help you. It\u2019s not that I\u2019m asking you to better manage your people. Elder Lin came up with the prescription and publicized it to the public for people to use it. What were your subordinates planning to do? They were going to invite bids for it and cheat people of their money.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ma Jun Guo rebutted, \u201cElder Lin, you\u2019re accusing others. I\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me I\u2019m accusing them. I realized that your department had a problem since a long time ago. I just didn\u2019t want to say it because it would affect you. Now that things are getting out of hand, you can\u2019t just ignore it. Although you\u2019ve retired, you can still do something to change it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, I will hang up now. If I haven\u2019t known you for so many years, I would probably not trust you. Those people are all corrupted\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Zheng had said it really bluntly and he hadn\u2019t given him any face at all.</p><br/><p>Ma Jun Guo felt a little awkward. He didn\u2019t know how to react to that.</p><br/><p>He knew about the situation but he just needed occasional reminders.</p></div>\n</div>"}

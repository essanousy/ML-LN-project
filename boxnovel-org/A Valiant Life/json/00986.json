His expression was a little solemn as he went to take a look at the discussion on Weibo.</p><br/><p>The whole thing had blown up. The direction of the discussion had been skewed.</p><br/><p>However, the good thing was that his fans were still loyal to him. The people that were flaming him right now were mainly those trolls.</p><br/><p>The only thing is, he had not thought that Zhang Guo Shou would be so tech-savvy, to be able to abuse the internet to such an extent even at such an old age. His experience was truly amazing.</p><br/><p>However, it was not enough.</p><br/><p>It looked like Lin Fan had to teach him a lesson.</p><br/><p>At this moment, some of the members of the Chinese Medical Association suddenly started to cry out as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m very hurt after seeing Elder Zhang\u2019s condition. He has given his whole life to the association and I never thought that he would be treated this way, so bitterly and hurtfully. If this is how the association is going to be, I\u2019m withdrawing. I don\u2019t need any approval, it is my personal decision.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Zhang is someone truly worthy of being a teacher. I\u2019ll have to support him even in his older years. I\u2019m withdrawing as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDear new Chairman, you have really been too overbearing. Whenever anyone opposed your ideas, you did not even give them a chance to explain themselves before just attacking them. What\u2019s the point of having an association like this? I\u2019m leaving and I hope that other people will follow suit.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan had no idea where these b*stards came from. It seemed like it was something that was prearranged, for all of them to come out one by one. Although the things they were saying were different, the meaning of their words was the same \u2013 they could not take it. They were against Chairman Lin and they wanted to withdraw from the association.</p><br/><p>At the same time, they were all placing Zhang Guo Shou on a pedestal, saying that he was not getting what he deserved after all he had done.</p><br/><p>When the news reporters saw this, they were all stunned. However, they all knew that, for so many people to suddenly come out like this, it must have been something that was orchestrated. Any ordinary person could see this so how could they, the people who presented the news, not see that?</p><br/><p>This was totally something that had been prearranged.</p><br/><p>Initially, Lin Fan had thought that he could calm the situation down. However, after this fiasco, the whole thing had become a lot more complicated.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan sighed. He felt a little helpless, wondering why these people would do this.</p><br/><p><em>Am I not just doing a little bit of reform? Why is everyone getting so pi*sed off about this?</em></p><br/><p><em>Forget it. If this is how you want to play, then I\u2019ll play along with you.</em></p><br/><p>Of course, he could just completely ignore these b*stards and just carry on with his own ways. However, after thinking about it, he was not the kind of person who would just stand by and let other people insult him. He had to win back the support of the Internet, if not, he would not have any face anymore.</p><br/><p>All the netizens were carefully watching this situation. Suddenly, Master Lin released a new post.</p><br/><p>When everyone saw this post, they were stunned.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan: \u201cStop putting up a front. There will be consequences.\u201d</p><br/><p>The netizens were all stunned. They almost spat out their blood.</p><br/><p>The situation online had already blown up to such an extent and yet Master Lin was saying that the other party was putting up a front. It was really too fierce.</p><br/><p>However, to all his loyal fans, if this was what their idol was saying, then they had to support it. If their idol said that they were putting up a front, then they were putting up a front.</p><br/><p>Zhang Guo Shou and the rest of them had teamed up and were trying to put pressure on Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>The whole group of them was gathered together.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, let\u2019s see what he can do now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. With all of us gathered together, there\u2019s no need to be scared of him anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, Elder Zhang has played this beautifully, immediately using this sort of posts to put pressure on him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHush! What are you talking about? Elder Zhang was really angered until he fell sick. This isn\u2019t playing at all.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, right. My bad.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLook at Weibo. This rascal really doesn\u2019t know how to admit his mistake. He still dared to post this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone was stunned. They did not know why, but the moment they saw that post on Weibo, their faces all turned black. They felt like this b*stard was really too presumptuous.</p><br/><p>\u201cStop putting up a front, there will be consequences?\u201d</p><br/><p><em>Who is this directed at? Could it be that it\u2019s directed at us?</em></p><br/><p><em>He really doesn\u2019t know when to give up. Even now, after everything has blown up, he still thinks he\u2019s in the right. It\u2019s disgusting.</em></p><br/><p>\u201cHmph, I want to see how long this rascal can hold up. I don\u2019t believe that the board of the association won\u2019t stand up and do something. The Chinese Medical Association can\u2019t possibly be run by him alone.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. If he thinks that, just because he\u2019s the Chairman, he can do whatever he wants, he\u2019s really thinking too much.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEven the government won\u2019t do things without caring at all.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Guo Shou did not care about what Lin Fan posted on Weibo and did not take it to heart. To him, it was just some tactic to distract them.\u201d</p><br/><p><em>Let\u2019s see how he handles things once it gets out of hand.</em></p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>At this moment, Lin Fan\u2019s phone rang. The person that called was one of his friends from the National Internet Safety Bureau.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d Lin Fan asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, don\u2019t do anything rash.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed and said, \u201cI\u2019m not being rash. It\u2019s for real.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAs long as you haven\u2019t done anything rash, it\u2019s fine. We have been notified of this incident already. We\u2019re looking for information on the database which we\u2019ll send over to you later.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was stunned. \u201cWhat information? What are you guys trying to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, don\u2019t touch your computer. We are settling things for you. We have recorded all the data on Zhang Guo Shou already. He is rejecting your reform because it is going to affect his personal interests, even though he said that it would not affect him. This situation developing to this stage is that we did not think would happen, so we have decided to hand the information over to you. Once you post it on Weibo, everything should be settled. Please don\u2019t touch your computer and don\u2019t try to hack the database.\u201d</p><br/><p>After hearing that, Lin Fan was still a little suspicious as he did not really understand what the opposite party had said. But suddenly, he thought of something.</p><br/><p>The people at the Internet Safety Bureau had definitely done some sort of investigation into those people with power. They definitely had information about each one of them.</p><br/><p>These days, there was a countless number of big shots getting exposed every year. And it was all done mysteriously and randomly. Finding out this information about them was very simple. However, why had the bureau waited until now to expose Zhang Guo Shou?</p><br/><p>It seemed that they had to pick several people to expose each year. Otherwise, if they exposed all of those big shots in one go, it would cause a huge stir.</p><br/><p>It made sense.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was moved by his own ability to speculate things.</p><br/><p>However, what he had not expected was that the Internet Safety Bureau would take this incident so seriously. Could it be that they were scared that he would start hacking again and do something that they would not be able to handle?</p><br/><p>That was the only plausible reason that he could think of. After all, his IT skills were still pretty good, so with a small bit of effort, he would be able to cause quite a mess in their system.</p><br/><p>A while after he hung up.</p><br/><p>He received a private message on Weibo.</p><br/><p>When he saw it, he was dumbfounded. He had not thought that this Zhang Guo Shou had such a dark past.</p><br/><p>He had used his position to seek all sorts of benefits from all the different pharmaceutical company owners.</p><br/><p>There were even various business deals that he had done with the hospitals.</p><br/><p>Even the details of his extramarital affairs were in here.</p><br/><p>If these were to be exposed to the world, there would definitely be huge repercussions.</p><br/><p>However, after seeing all this, he started to understand why this old fellow was trying so hard to protest against him. He was doing it all for his own benefit.</p><br/><p>All the things he had talked about in the past was all bullsh*t.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan did not have to think much.</p><br/><p>He just immediately exposed all of it.</p><br/><p>\u201cZhang Guo Shou, sometimes, when people grow old, they should learn how to just be content with what they have. I was initially planning to let you enjoy your old age and retire in peace with all the glory and honor that you had. However, you\u2019ve been too much of a bully so don\u2019t blame me for this.\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

He had served the army and joined a team in the past. After becoming a regular member, because there weren't many paths to take, he went on to join the city enforcement team. After he had gotten to know Lin Fan, he handled the cases well and helped to improve the reputation of the city enforcement team. The leader recognized his hard work and sent him to the police station to become a police officer. This was all because of fate.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian and the rest gathered around. They were all in shock. \"I didn't expect you to be such a hero.\"</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang held the phone and said, \"Did all of you hear that? The person that provided the information about the human trafficking organization was Master Lin. Don't you think that's d*mn awesome?\"</p><br/><p>\"666\u2026 Gotta donate more presents.\"</p><br/><p>\"Enough said. I'll donate ten rockets first. Master Lin is so d*mn awesome.\"</p><br/><p>\"Brother Yang, quick, let us see Master Lin. We want to see Master Lin, not you!\"</p><br/><p>\"Haha, Brother Yang is going to be sad again. But I'm really impressed by Master Lin. I gotta be impressed, this is a really good deed.\"</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang held the phone and said, \"Master Lin, can you express your thoughts to the netizens?\"</p><br/><p>The camera pointed at Master Lin. The netizens watching the broadcast excitedly tapped on the screen and donated a lot of gifts.</p><br/><p>Lazy Night Cat: \"Master Lin, please tell us your thoughts.\"</p><br/><p>Rockets x50.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled, \"Thank you Lazy Night Cat for your 50 rockets. My thoughts about this issue don't matter. It was just a piece of cake.\"</p><br/><p>\"666\u2026 When Master Lin gets cocky, nobody can beat him.\"</p><br/><p>\"His level of awesomeness is beyond anyone else. All unrelated personnel must leave, don't get hurt by this.\"</p><br/><p>\"I'm so impressed. It's such a big thing and Master Lin actually said it's a piece of cake. How could anyone not be impressed by him?\"</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the situation in the broadcast room and laughed. This matter was really just a piece of cake to him. He really didn't think much of it.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian chuckled, \"That's it, we gotta have a gathering tonight to celebrate our hero's good deed.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed, \"Are you treating us?\"</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian was a little taken aback. But he laughed, \"I'm okay with treating. This matter deserves tapping into my funeral funds.\"</p><br/><p>The others started to laugh.</p><br/><p>At night!</p><br/><p>Initially, Lin Fan didn't want to celebrate because he felt that it didn't deserve a celebration. But since Fraud Tian offered to treat them, they had to go for it. They didn't choose an expensive place, but they had to choose somewhere with beer to drink.</p><br/><p>The bunch of people just gathered and sat there.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian raised his glass and exclaimed, \"Let's have a toast to our hero!\"</p><br/><p>His voice was loud and crisp. The other diners in the restaurant stared at them.</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang was a little embarrassed. \"Fraud, lower your volume. You're drawing too much attention.\"</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian wasn't bothered by it. \"What's wrong with it? He's really a hero. He helped the police to solve the human trafficking case and saved the lives of over a thousand children. Isn't he a hero?\"</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang waved his hands, \"Stay low-key, stay low-key\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan and the rest started to laugh. Fraud Tian was really quite embarrassing.</p><br/><p>The other diners were curious. \"You mean he's the good citizen that was mentioned in the news today?\"</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian turned around and proudly said, \"That's right, it's him.\"</p><br/><p>The commotion also attracted the attention of the boss. He walked over, \"Bro, are you really the hero that was mentioned on the news?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at Fraud Tian and smiled. \"It was just a piece of cake. It's everyone's responsibility to tackle the problem of human trafficking. I'm not a hero!\"</p><br/><p>The boss was elated. Then, he shouted, \"Everyone, please eat as much as possible. I didn't expect the hero that helped to solve the human trafficking case to actually be here to eat! It's my honor. The meal is free today. All of you don't have to pay! Just drink as much as you want!\"</p><br/><p>Some of the diners didn't understand what was happening. Then, they asked, \"Brother Fatty, who is it?\"</p><br/><p>Brother Fatty stretched his arm out, \"It's this guy here. You guys may not know, but the type of people I hate the most is human traffickers. My daughter was unlucky to have been abducted. I don't want to talk about it further. I want to celebrate today too!\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan wiped the sweat off his forehead, \"Boss, you're too courteous.\"</p><br/><p>Brother Fatty waved his hand, \"Hero, you deserve it. Eat as much as you can today. It's free.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan helplessly shook his head, \"Brother Fatty, aren't you afraid of me lying to you?\"</p><br/><p>Brother Fatty was extremely happy, he laughed hysterically, \"Who would lie about such a thing? Even if I'm being lied to, it's worth it. Just take it as a celebration of this piece of news.\"</p><br/><p>At this point, what else could Lin Fan say? At the same time, he stared at Fraud Tian. \"Did you do that on purpose?\"</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian looked at Lin Fan innocently. \"No way. How would I have known that things would become like that?\"</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian was really happy. He hadn't expected to have such a good deal. He could finally save the funds for his funeral.</p><br/><p>The environment there was really comfortable. The air-conditioning was good as they continued to drink and chat. They were having such a good time.</p><br/><p>The surrounding diners were also very passionate. They were extremely happy after Brother Fatty told them about the free meal.</p><br/><p>A middle-aged man came over with beer and patted Lin Fan on his shoulder. \"Brother, I'm really impressed by you. I want to give you a toast!\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was about to ask him to drink slowly and not be in such a hurry but the man immediately finished the whole bottle of beer. He only took a few seconds. How impressive!</p><br/><p>He had given Lin Fan so much face that Lin Fan had to accept it. He had no choice but to drink a bottle too.</p><br/><p>\"Alright\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang pointed the camera at Master Lin. \"Everyone, look, Master Lin is going to finish it in one go.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan finished the entire bottle and slowly caught his breath. Then, he nodded at the middle-aged man.</p><br/><p>Wu Tian He patted Lin Fan on his shoulder. \"Drink slowly, don't be anxious. It's bad for your health.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded, \"It's okay, I got this.\"</p><br/><p>The atmosphere was getting even better.</p><br/><p>The surrounding diners also pulled their tables over. They were very interested in the human trafficking news but the news didn't reveal much.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan continued to drink a few bottles with the townsfolk. They started to discuss it further. Even Brother Fatty pulled a stool over.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \"The leader of the human trafficking organization looked like a decent man. You wouldn't know that he's a bad person with one look but that was the case. You wouldn't dare to think that he's a human trafficker, much less the leader of the organization. Who knows how many children he's abducted?\"</p><br/><p>The surrounding townsfolk exclaimed, \"Ah\u2026 I didn't know it was like that.\"</p><br/><p>\"I guess you really can't judge someone by his looks. He looks so decent but he is such an evil man.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled, \"That's why we can't judge a book by its cover. Evil people these days are getting too good at hiding.\"</p><br/><p>The crowd nodded, \"Yeah, that's right.\"</p><br/><p>...</p><br/>\n</div>"}

This is a street, I can\u2019t go that quickly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang looked at Lu Li and said, \u201cWhen you left the area, why didn\u2019t you drag him along with you?\u201d Up till now, he still could not figure out what his brother was trying to do. Was he trying to be a hero even at this point in time? Why did he not return at the first chance and let the police handle this case?</p><br/><p>Lu Li\u2019s face was one of helplessness as he replied, \u201cI have no way to. He was insistent on staying there and letting me go back first. He said he wanted to defeat those kidnappers once and for all as they were armed, vicious and very evil.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCausing trouble. He loves to cause trouble. He is absolutely fixed on it and he doesn\u2019t even care about the situation. If he really dies then what am I going to do?\u201d Wang Ming Yang was on the verge of tears.</p><br/><p>Qin Ju was seated in the car. His expression was pretty solemn. He had no idea what was going on but he was afraid that it would be bad as these kidnappers were not the normal kind of kidnappers. A bunch of kidnappers coming to rescue \u2018Scorpion\u2019? He was afraid that killing to them would be something very easy. Now Lin Fan was a very amazing person, but there was a guarantee that he would be let off by these kidnappers.</p><br/><p>Not to mention they were armed, so there was no guessing what they would do.</p><br/><p>Qin Jun said, \u201cDoes the criminal police squad have any information on the other party yet?\u201d</p><br/><p>A policeman said, \u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, a technical staff shouted, \u201cChief Ju, the report is here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Ju said, \u201cQuickly pass it to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, everyone, besides the driver, had their eyes glued to the computer screen. This was the information from the criminal police department and investigating those kidnappers was definitely not easy. They had to identify the kidnappers through a camera lens and then after that check through the immigration records. To be able to find anything was already pretty shocking.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Qin Ju said as he looked at the content of the report. Qin Ju\u2019s expression completely changed. It changed to one of disbelief and shock.</p><br/><p>Jin He: Myanmar Drug Dealer.</p><br/><p>Wu Wei: Myanmar Drug Dealer.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>This was not even the scariest part. The scariest part was the description of the other people below.</p><br/><p>Li Qiang: Myanmar Drug Dealer, nicknamed \u2018Brother Qiang\u2019. Very active in Southeast Asia\u2019s Golden Triangle and is very proficient in combat.</p><br/><p>Ma Ka: Mercenary for the Golden Triangle. Internationally wanted fugitive.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>There were thirteen names there, all of which with their descriptions. Also, they were not just simple human beings, but all of them were proficient at combat.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe situation doesn\u2019t look too good,\u201d Qin Ju said as his expression became more solemn. If it was really like that, he was scared it was not something they could handle. The opposition would definitely have brought heavy weaponry. With their capabilities, if they were to try and match their force, the outcome would not be unimaginably bad.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang became anxious and started tugging on Qin Ju, saying, \u201cWhat doesn\u2019t look too good?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Ju did not reply him. He was deep in thought, trying to think of a plan. He did not know how Master Lin was right now. Whether he had been captured by the drug dealers or if he had sacrificed himself.</p><br/><p>When it came to dealing with these drug dealers, especially given that they had so many people, there was no guarantee at all that they would be able to capture them with no casualties. Since Lin Fan was alone, there was almost no way he was going to be able to.</p><br/><p>When dealing with these drug dealers, to be able to stay alive was already an achievement, no one would even think of capturing them.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang was not an idiot. When he saw the contents of the computer screen, he was dumbfounded for a moment. His eyes started to light up in fear and he said, \u201cHow could it\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Ju immediately went into action. He said, \u201cHow prepared is the criminal police squad?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cChief Ju, they have done their preparations already. They are on their way to the destination and in a moment\u2019s time I\u2019ll go over there and organize them. I hope that we are on time,\u201d the civil police knew that Lin Fan was still there. But looking at the situation, there was a very low chance that Lin Fan was still alive. These were ferocious and evil drug dealers along with mercenaries with a lot of combat experience. They were not going to be beaten by a regular person.</p><br/><p>Especially since they were armed. It was definitely a very dangerous situation and would scary anyone to bits.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>In the other police car.</p><br/><p>\u2018Scorpion\u2019 was being escorted to the destination by Liu Xiao Tian, Huang Gang, and others. On the road, Liu Xiao Tian\u2019s expression was very solemn. He had already received the news that these drug dealers were not the normal kind and that Master Lin was still stuck there. As for the situation, he still was clueless about it but he was hoping for Lin Fan\u2019s safety.</p><br/><p>Scorpion\u2019s expression was very calm. There was a smile forming on the edge of his lips. He could already smell the freedom, that he was being saved and that he could finally return to Myanmar.</p><br/><p>The criminal police\u2019s special forces squad was fully armed.</p><br/><p>\u201cTake note. Later the people you are facing are drug dealers who are illegal migrants. According to our reports, these drug dealers are armed and there are also combat trained and experienced mercenaries. When we are capturing these criminals, we also have to guarantee the safety of the hostage.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGot it.\u201d</p><br/><p>The criminal police\u2019s special forces squad were all very serious. They knew about the scary possibility of an all-out gun fight,</p><br/><p>They never thought that this kind of situation would occur in the city of Shanghai. It was definitely very rare.</p><br/><p>They had gone through long and intense training all for situations like this.</p><br/><p>Protecting civilians and defeating criminals in times of trouble.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Lu Li scanned the surroundings and then immediately shouted, \u201cIt\u2019s here! The warehouse in front was the place that we were held captive in.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Ju picked up his walkie-talkie and said, \u201cHalt. Everyone, stop your cars. In front of us is the warehouse that the drug dealers are housed in.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMr. Wang, Mr. Lu, you guys wait in the car. Don\u2019t do anything rash. There\u2019s a chance there will be a huge firefight, I hope you guys understand,\u201d Qin Ju sternly said.</p><br/><p>Lu Li definitely would not dare to come out anyway. He immediately nodded his head. He was most scared of dying.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang tugged on Qin Ju\u2019s hand, saying, \u201cQin Ju, my brother\u2019s life is in your hands, you must save him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Ju nodded, saying, \u201cRelax, we will definitely do our best to save Master Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMove out.\u201d</p><br/><p>The special forces team were well trained and proficient in combat. In keeping Shanghai safe, they had to be vigilant around the clock. They worked with international police to catch criminals.</p><br/><p>A high tech and compact car meant for investigation raced forward towards the warehouse.</p><br/><p>Huang Gang was in-charge of the small group. He started giving hand signals to them to encircle the surroundings to get a better idea of what was going on.</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian was bringing people along. They were escorting \u2018scorpion\u2019 to the scene to negotiate with these drug dealers.</p><br/><p>Huang Gang said, \u201cLil\u2019 Wang, what\u2019s going on over there?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGroup leader, it\u2019s clear, there are no enemies over there.\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly.</p><br/><p>Little Wang\u2019s voice became more anxious as he said, \u201cGroup leader, target spotted. No wait, it looks like Master Lin. D*mn it\u2026 what is he doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>Huang Gang\u2019s expression changed. He said, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Little Wang, quickly report what is going on.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>At the entrance to the warehouse.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was seated on the floor. In his left hand was a cigarette, in his right was a gun. He looked a bit worried, wondering what time the backup was going to arrive. He had been waiting for almost an hour and he had been smoking till his lungs were going to burst.</p><br/><p>The thing that pissed Lin Fan off more was that his phone was spoiled.</p><br/><p>This Brother Qiang or whatever his name was, not only took away his phone but he destroyed it. That f*cker, does he not know that this phone cost him thousands of dollars?</p><br/><p>There more weird stuff going on with Lin Fan. In his hand was a mirror. It was like he was taking a video. He raised it up and took a look at it.</p><br/><p>A whistling sound!</p><br/><p>With his heightened sensitivity, he could sense that there were people around. His brows raised in happiness. It seemed like they were finally here.</p><br/><p>At this moment, a familiar figure appeared.</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian escorted \u2018Scorpion\u2019 there from a distance. He looked like he was very cautious.</p><br/><p>\u2018Scorpion\u2019 had a smile on his face as he said, \u201cHaha, I was going to escape already. But it looks like my henchmen did not have so much patience to waste time with you guys.\u201d</p><br/><p>When \u2018Scorpion\u2019 looked in front, his expression totally changed. His face that was brimming with joy began to stiffen up.</p><br/><p>What is this?</p></div>\n</div>"}

How do you feel after spending one month here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot bad, not bad. Did Inspector Liu tell you that I don\u2019t want my furniture moved away from here? In the event that I have to come here again next time, I can stay there again,\u201d Lin Fan laughed. He felt really good staying here for a month.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha!\u201d Liu Xiao Tian laughed out loud. \u201cMaster Lin, such a thought of yours is hard to accept! Why not you get a job at the Detention House? Then you would have your own personal room.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved his hand, \u201cNah if I were to work here, I wouldn\u2019t be feeling like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sun Neng stood at one side and said, \u201cGuru! The next time you come here, be sure to inform me! I will drop everything and immediately come and accompany you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan patted Sun Neng on his shoulder, \u201cGood! Seems like doting on you wasn\u2019t in vain.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe.\u201d Sun Neng laughed. It felt good being regarded as important by his idol the Guru.</p><br/><p>Shen Jie Yun was naturally included in this. Even though every day in the Detention House was tedious, but he was still able to learn from the Guru. That itself was a dream come true.</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian moved a side to form a path, \u201cEveryone is waiting for you outside.\u201d</p><br/><p>After spending a month in the Detention house, everyone must have missed him dearly.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian was smoking in silence, \u201cWhy isn\u2019t that fellow coming out? It couldn\u2019t be that he\u2019s unwilling to leave this place, could it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhongyang was holding his phone and said \u201cDear friends, Brother Lin will be out shortly. Let us give him a round of applause to welcome Brother Lin\u2019s return home!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan was hanging around there, staring in front of her. She hasn\u2019t seen Brother Lin in a month and she was longing to see him.</p><br/><p>Previously, she was able to see Brother Lin\u2019s face daily. However, as of today, she hasn\u2019t seen his face in a month and therefore, she was naturally feeling more down than usual.</p><br/><p>The reporters were crowding around the gates. Upon hearing that Master Lin was being released today, they just had to rush down to properly interview Master Lin.</p><br/><p>A figure appeared.</p><br/><p>The crowd was momentarily cried out in surprise.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin is out!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRush over to him!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan had pre-empted that there would be such a situation. The reporters swarmed around Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>\u201cCongratulations on your release Master Lin. Could I ask you a few questions?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled, \u201cThank you. Ask away.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, could I ask how you were inside the Detention House?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, did the government put any restrictions on you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>There were many questions and they were all that the reporters wanted to know.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved his hand, \u201cDear reporters, could you all please relax a little. Please ask me questions one by one. With all these questions being thrown at me, I don\u2019t even know which one to answer first.\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporters quietened down. They had interviewed Master Lin many times before and it could be said that he was one of the more considerate ones. He would normally answer their questions and never once did he avoid giving them a reply.</p><br/><p>But obviously, if the questions were overboard, it was only natural that he wouldn\u2019t answer them.</p><br/><p>However, up till this moment, they felt that there was no question that Master Lin could not reply.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan took awhile to organize his words, \u201cI\u2019ll reply the first question. My time in the Detention House was very good and I was very happy. At the same time, I\u2019ve spent the time reflecting on the wrongdoings that I\u2019ve committed. Though, I just wanted to say that my motive was a good one, just that the action was against the law. The fellow policemen are very friendly. If I have any problems I\u2019d go to them and they\u2019ll be sure to help me resolve the problem.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAs for the other question, the restrictions would naturally come into place. And that would involve me staying away from computers.\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporters frantically wrote them down, \u201cMaster Lin, are you going to accept this restriction imposed by the government?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed, \u201cWhat is there not to accept. Of course, in the beginning, I was also slightly unhappy with this decision. Who doesn\u2019t use computers these days? However, after much consideration, I\u2019ve realized that since my skills are so good, it must be terrifying when I get to use a computer. Hence, in order to maintain world peace, I promise that I would never use a computer again.\u201d</p><br/><p>The crowd was all stunned. The potter was praising his own pot. It was amazing.</p><br/><p>The reporters asked again, \u201cMay I ask that if such a situation were to arise again, would you use a computer to uphold justice?\u201d</p><br/><p>This question was rather tricky.</p><br/><p>However, to Lin Fan, this wasn\u2019t any challenge at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cDefinitely! Why wouldn\u2019t I? Justice is a flame that never goes out. Of course, I have complete trust in the network experts of our country. If the matter is under control, then I wouldn\u2019t use a computer.\u201d Lin Fan replied.</p><br/><p>Another reporter asked, \u201cSince the government has restricted you from using any computers from today onwards, wouldn\u2019t it be against the law if you do use one?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed, \u201cWhat\u2019s there to be scared of? At the most, I\u2019ll just serve another jail term. Being able to accompany those cute policemen, it isn\u2019t so painful to be in jail.\u201d</p><br/><p>Stunned!</p><br/><p>The reporters were lost for words. They didn\u2019t think that Master Lin was so magnanimous.</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian shook his head, with a bitter smile. He was afraid that the next time he had to serve, he would have to stay forever.</p><br/><p>He replied the question rather well. Lin Fan laughed, \u201cDear reporters, that\u2019s it for today. My friends are all waiting for me. I\u2019ve just been released but I was immediately handed to you all. You guys shouldn\u2019t take me all for yourselves.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha!\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporters all burst out laughing. Satisfied, they moved aside. Those few questions were enough for them.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan arrived face to face with Wang Ming Yang. A large grin appeared on his face. \u201cHow do you feel? After one month of not seeing me, did you miss me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang slapped Lin Fan on his shoulder, then pulled him in for a hug. \u201cI\u2019ve missed you. One month of not seeing each other, I\u2019m sure the other brothers missed you. However, it seems that you had a comfortable life during this one month. I was scared that you didn\u2019t miss us\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed, \u201cNo way, didn\u2019t I call you guys?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang was in a good mood and said \u201cWe\u2019ve already booked a place for you. After you shower, let\u2019s go for a meal!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSounds good!\u201d Lin Fan laughed, after which he faced the red-eyed Wu You Lan and said, \u201cWhat are you crying about\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan smiled, \u201cI\u2019m happy to see you come out!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhongyang faced the camera towards Lin Fan, \u201cFriends! Don\u2019t you think that Brother Lin has become a bit chubbier?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked towards the camera and waved, \u201cDear friends, have you missed me?\u201d</p><br/><p>There was a burst of on-screen comments on the live stream.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve missed you! Brother Lin is getting more and more handsome!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin is simply awesome!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBeing able to see Master Lin again, I can put myself at ease now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian laughed, \u201cI thought you were reluctant to come out.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need to repeat that! If it wasn\u2019t for you guys waiting outside, I wouldn\u2019t mind spending a few years inside. It was so comfortable!\u201d Lin Fan laughed.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian was momentarily angered by his words, \u201cYou can go back in then. Please stay for another year. I can promise you that we won\u2019t miss you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan stood by the side, \u201cYou won\u2019t miss him, but I definitely will.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian was left helpless. His group didn\u2019t support him and he felt betrayed.</p><br/><p>\u201cFool, why would he be willing to stay inside for a year. He would definitely go insane.\u201d Fraud Tian added.</p><br/><p>Wu Tian He chuckled at his side. Life these days were good. Compared to days back in Lianzhou, it was definitely better.</p><br/><p>Let us get a shower and a good meal!</p></div>\n</div>"}

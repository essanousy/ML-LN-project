However, nobody had expected the plot twist.</p><br/><p>Lil\u2019 Dong stood beside him in fear, \u201cIt\u2019s my mistake. I almost got you into trouble.\u201d</p><br/><p>He knew that if he didn\u2019t handle the matter properly, he would leave a bad impression on the leader. Even if Fang Zheng Yan didn\u2019t force Lin Fan to give him the requested artwork, it would still cause Elder Zheng to bear a grudge. Luckily, the matter was resolved promptly.</p><br/><p>Then, Fang Zheng Yan who was in deep thought, smiled, \u201cI didn\u2019t expect to be defeated by a youngster today. Lil\u2019 Dong, I don\u2019t blame you for this. Don\u2019t think too much about it. Master Lin, being in Shanghai, is a valuable asset to us. We can\u2019t have a bad impression of him just because he didn\u2019t want to give us an artwork.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lil\u2019 Dong nodded, \u201cChief, don\u2019t worry. I have never thought of that at all.\u201d</p><br/><p>When they had been in the shop, Fang Zheng Yan couldn\u2019t understand what was going on. After thinking for a moment, he finally understood it. How could Master Lin not know Elder Zheng\u2019s status? The reason he mentioned him was to reject his request and diminish any thoughts that he still had.</p><br/><p>If he couldn\u2019t even understand that, Fang Zheng Yan would have been kicked out of his appointment long ago.</p><br/><p>When he had been competing for his current position, he had to get rid of a lot of threatening competitors. He had hustled for four years and it was an intense period. He didn\u2019t dare to do anything wrong and finally, he was given this appointment.</p><br/><p>As for Master Lin\u2019s artwork, he had just been excited by the thrill of the hunt. Now that he got rejected by Master Lin, he didn\u2019t want to think too much about it.</p><br/><p>As Fang Zheng Yan\u2019s secretary, Lil\u2019 Dong thought about everything for him. It was just that he had thought about this matter too simply. He treated Lin Fan as a simple and ordinary man.</p><br/><p>Typical masters would definitely give a notable leader an artwork upon request. However, Master Lin didn\u2019t accede to it.</p><br/><p>If they were to put it bluntly, it was that they had thought of themselves too highly.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>Chief Che returned to the shop and shook his head helplessly, \u201cMaster Lin, the leader said it so obviously, why didn\u2019t you understand him?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled, \u201cChief Che, what do you mean? He just wanted an artwork. All I did was to recommend him to get one from my friends. The leader just didn\u2019t want to do it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Chief Che was speechless. Was Lin Fan really that dumb?</p><br/><p>However, the leader wasn\u2019t furious. Thus, he didn\u2019t want to mention this matter anymore.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled, \u201cChief Che, do you not understand this? Is my artwork so easy to obtain? My artworks can easily fetch a few million dollars. If he dared to take my artwork, I guarantee that people would definitely take advantage of him in the coming year. Therefore, I pretended to be stupid to protect him. He might even be thanking me now after thinking about what just happened.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Che looked at Lin Fan in doubt, \u201cIs that true?\u201d</p><br/><p>He somehow believed him. Master Lin wasn\u2019t an ordinary master after all. All ten of his artworks had been placed in the national museum. The value had obviously risen a lot. Furthermore, there weren\u2019t any of them being circulated in the market.</p><br/><p>Therefore, it was really difficult to obtain one if his artworks. If the leader had really managed to do it, people might think that Master Lin had accepted a bribe.</p><br/><p>If he had acceded to any random leader\u2019s request, his artworks wouldn\u2019t be that valuable anymore.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, who was he? He was Master Lin. The person that wouldn\u2019t be threatened by anyone. If anyone were to push him to the edge, he might even finish them with one blow.</p><br/><p>Even the thought of it was thrilling.</p><br/><p>Chief Che just left. Regardless of whether it was true, it was okay as long as the leader wasn\u2019t angry. However, he was filled with delight that Master Lin was in the district that he managed.</p><br/><p>It was something that other people could only be envious of.</p><br/><p>The next day!</p><br/><p>Most people hadn\u2019t woken up yet but the Internet had exploded.</p><br/><p>\u2018Wu Huan Yue spent the night with a mysterious man.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018The uprising musical star shared an apartment with another lady and a mysterious man. She only left the next morning.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Two panties were being hung at the balcony. What had exactly happened?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018A man and two women, a shocking scandal.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>When the news was published, everyone was stunned. Initially, a lot of fans didn\u2019t dare to believe it but when they saw the pictures, they were dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>The two women placed their arms around a man. Although the faces of the man and the other lady were censored, Wu Huan Yue\u2019s face was taken clearly. Her smile had melted the hearts of a lot of fans.</p><br/><p>What had happened to their idol? Why had she done such a thing?</p><br/><p>A lot of Internet celebrities started to re-post the news. Other celebrities also shared it.</p><br/><p>If a person was in trouble, there wouldn\u2019t be many people that would willingly save him/her. However, there would definitely be a lot of haters.</p><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue had progressed really quickly. When she first started singing, her classic songs got famous and shook the entire music industry.</p><br/><p>She drove up the value of popular songs.</p><br/><p>With so many new hits, the value of these new hits did not decrease but actually increased. Many celebrities felt that their statuses weren\u2019t stable due to the lack of popular music. Hence, they immediately got people to compose new songs. However, the composers immediately doubled their prices. Many agencies suffered from it.</p><br/><p>The artificial inflation of the prices was a sudden change.</p><br/><p>A new singer laughed condescendingly, \u201cHaha, Wu Huan Yue just had a scandal reported. She\u2019ll never be able to deny the claims. The evidence is so concrete.\u201d</p><br/><p>Her agent also smiled, \u201cYour chance is here. You\u2019ve been affected by Wu Huan Yue. Now that something like this has happened, she is definitely going to go down. When that happens, nobody can affect your progress anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t expect that at all. She has been faking her innocence. Now that she\u2019s been exposed by Dai Jun Ming, I want to see how she\u2019s going to get out of this scandal.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDai Jun Ming is indeed really annoying. However, this matter was done beautifully.\u201d</p><br/><p>At Ying Jin\u2019s office.</p><br/><p>She had no feuds with Wu Huan Yue but she had a conflict with Lin Fan before. Since Wu Huan Yue was close to Lin Fan, Ying Jin hated her.</p><br/><p>As an \u2018elder\u2019 of the music industry, she had the power to affect Wu Huan Yue\u2019s position. However, she couldn\u2019t control the number of popular songs that she was going to have. Hence, her power had been limited but now, the situation had changed. She knew that Wu Huan Yue was doomed after doing such a scandalous thing.</p><br/><p>Then, Ying Jin started to follow up with it. She didn\u2019t want to let go of such a good opportunity. She immediately contacted some celebrities and asked them to flame Wu Huan Yue on Weibo.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, she also posted on Weibo.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have to be clean in the music industry. If not, your career will definitely be affected.\u201d</p><br/><p>People didn\u2019t say many harsh words about the scandal but after Ying Jin posted that, social media exploded.</p><br/><p>Many seniors in the music industry also reposted the Weibo post.</p><br/><p>The music industry\u2019s crusade had officially begun.</p><br/><p>\u201cLooks like the impact isn\u2019t big enough. Let me intensify it then,\u201d Ying Jin thought.</p></div>\n</div>"}

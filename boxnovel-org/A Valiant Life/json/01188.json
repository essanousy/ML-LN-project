Also, this was the incubation period of the disease. When the level of immunity cells in the blood decreased to a certain level, the rate of infection increased exponentially.</p><br/><p>\u201cI finally understand now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan managed to control the virus in his body and prevented it from spreading. He wanted to start experimenting on it, but he realised that his actions would probably wake Ming Qing up.</p><br/><p>His disciple had been working tirelessly for a long time and he wanted him to rest.</p><br/><p>The next day morning.</p><br/><p>On the Internet.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a new day. The first thing I do every day is to scroll through the web to see if there\u2019s any success.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you so anxious? It\u2019s only been a few days. There\u2019s a long way to go. It\u2019s not a minor disease.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, I believe in Master Lin\u2019s ability.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank God I\u2019m from Shanghai. I can go and have a look myself.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone on the Internet is probably looking at this now. A lot of celebrities also expressed their opinions. Can I just ask if Master Lin has a good relationship with them?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood relationship my a*s. Master Lin used to have conflicts with them, especially Ying Jin, which affected a lot of people.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, now that the celebrities realise how powerful Master Lin is, all of them want to befriend him.\u201d</p><br/><p>The celebrities did not dare to offend him as their careers could be easily ended by him.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, he was becoming more popular with each passing day.</p><br/><p>Whoever tried to start a conflict with Master Lin was literally asking for death.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Ying Jin saw the news online.</p><br/><p>\u201cLin, I hope you get affected by AIDS.\u201d</p><br/><p>At Shanghai Chinese Medical Academy.</p><br/><p>When the reporters arrived, they were shocked to see many foreigners waiting outside the academy.</p><br/><p>Then, they quickly went to interview them.</p><br/><p>\u201cHi, are you also concerned about Master Lin\u2019s research?\u201d</p><br/><p>The foreigner, who seemed to be an American, nodded. \u201cYes. I am very concerned. I flew here from America to see the outcome of Master Lin\u2019s research.\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporter was stunned. \u201cYou speak Mandarin really well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI learned it before.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMay I know how you found out about Master Lin\u2019s research?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAn online forum was talking about it, and I quickly rushed here when I found out about it. A lot of us are here because of it too.\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporters looked around and saw many foreigners of different nationalities.</p><br/><p>The reporters were shocked to see that this incident attracted the attention of so many people, even foreigners.</p><br/><p>Hence, Zhao Zhong Yang raised his phone in the air and began his broadcast.</p><br/><p>He had no choice. His fans wanted him to livestream the situation there. He had been really anxious about it as there had been no news from Master Lin for the past few days.</p><br/><p>Besides the vague information that they received from delivering food inside, they got nothing else.</p><br/><p>\u201cBros, I am at the entrance of Shanghai Chinese Medical Academy. There are a lot of people here. However, nothing has been announced yet,\u201d Zhao Zhong Yang said to his phone.</p><br/><p>The netizens were stunned after seeing the situation.</p><br/><p>They did not expect the large crowd at all.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, there were even foreigners waiting outside too.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?! Why do I feel like Master Lin has become popular all over the world? There are so many foreigners there!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, he\u2019s researching a terminal illness. Everyone is focused on him. It even appeared in the news in other countries.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, they had been reporting about this. Master Lin is really famous now, even more than before when he was researching about leukemia. Also, even some special countries are looking forward to his success. If he were to succeed, everyone would be saved!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, the power of this virus is too strong. Anyone who is horny can become the next carrier of the HIV virus.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Yang, can we find out more about the situation? Did they announce anything?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang replied, \u201cI have asked around and there\u2019s nothing yet.\u201d</p><br/><p>In the labs.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing was sitting at a corner and he was shocked. He started to pick Chinese herbs to prepare because he realised that it seemed like his mentor had a lead.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan tasted the medicine and felt the effects of the medicine on the virus.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s lacking something. Also, this is pretty harmful to the body. We have to find something that\u2019s more gentle.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing replied, \u201cTeacher, this is a terminal illness. We can\u2019t just take a soft approach to this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s not impossible. We just haven\u2019t found it yet. There has to be something that can cure this. Let\u2019s continue trying.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Zhao Ming Qing nodded. He felt that his mentor was completely different from the previous day. It seemed as if he knew what to do as he picked and tried different medicines.</p><br/><p>It was no wonder that he was his mentor. Perhaps he would never be able to become as well-versed as Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>They started producing different medicines.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan kept consuming them to see the effects on the virus.</p><br/><p>None of them worked.</p><br/><p>He kept trying different combinations of medicine until it was night time.</p><br/><p>He tried over a hundred combinations of medicine.</p><br/><p>There was nothing that was perfect in Lin Fan\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>Although there was a medicine that could destroy the virus, it was too powerful. They could not just ruin the patients\u2019 health when they were trying to target just one virus.</p><br/><p>The medicine would create a huge impact on the body, and there was even a possibility of it causing other cancers. Hence, it was not suitable at all.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing said, \u201cTeacher, are you sure it\u2019s okay to be consuming medicine like this?\u201d</p><br/><p>He was afraid that the medicine would affect his mentor\u2019s health.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved his hand. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. It\u2019s just a small matter. Did you forget that I can concoct pills to get rid of the poison in my body?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing was still doubtful of his mentor, but there was nothing else he could do besides believing in him.</p><br/><p>He just hoped that they would succeed soon.</p></div>\n</div>"}

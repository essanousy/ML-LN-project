He just quietly got off the stage. However, the moment he took a step, everyone immediately reacted.</p><br/><p>The audience went into a frenzy. One by one they stood up and shouted loudly.</p><br/><p>\u201cSing another song!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t do this. You have to be responsible to us!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. One song is definitely not enough, you have to sing another!\u201d</p><br/><p>From the start till the end of the \u2018Strongest Heavenly Voice\u2019, the audience had been very normal all the while. They did not act in any dramatic way. However, right now, they could not control themselves.</p><br/><p>Even as teachers, Huo Jian Xiang and the rest of them were astonished when they heard Lin Fan\u2019s voice. They thought that Teacher Lin had a very normal voice and never thought that he had been hiding his true voice and they never thought that he was this amazing. The voice that came out of his throat completely shocked the entire scene.</p><br/><p>After just one song, he had managed to strike a nerve deep inside them and they could not control letting their emotions pour out.</p><br/><p>If Teacher Lin were to get into the music industry, how would anyone else be able to survive in it?</p><br/><p>It was a little scary thinking about that.</p><br/><p>Even after he saw the audience was in such a frenzy, Lin Fan was still very calm. He picked up the microphone and said, \u201cEveryone please calm down for a moment. For today, I\u2019ll only be singing one song. If there are other chances in the future, I\u2019ll sing again. The \u2018Strongest Heavenly Voice\u2019 has come to a wonderful end. I\u2019ll pass the time over to the host.\u201d</p><br/><p>After which, he got off the stage.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t leave.\u201d</p><br/><p>The audience was extremely bitter and hateful. They had not heard enough and yet it was already over.</p><br/><p>To the audience, they were all thoroughly stunned.</p><br/><p>They could guarantee that they have never heard any voice like that before. That sort of sound was like a drug. Once they heard it, it was very hard to forget.</p><br/><p>When they closed their eyes, their mind would be filled with that particular familiar sound.</p><br/><p>This whole event has extremely unforgettable. It made them rejoice to be able to be here on the scene. If they weren\u2019t here today, they would have lost their one and only chance to see it.</p><br/><p>The host Cui Wei did not think that after Teacher Lin\u2019s song, the entire scene will turn out like that. However, he could not help but admit that Teacher Lin\u2019s singing was too bewildering and magical.</p><br/><p>Even though he was standing at the backstage, he could not help crying.</p><br/><p>Backstage.</p><br/><p>The deputy stage manager was extremely dedicated to his job. Even if \u2018Strongest Heavenly Voice\u2019 was very popular, he would still go for the shows. The only thing is that he was scared that something might happen on the scene.</p><br/><p>After the last song today, he swung his fist with all his might and said, \u201cIgnition! We have finally ignited this show! In the last performance of the show, we have finally reached the peak!\u201d</p><br/><p>The deputy stage manager was very excited. Even he was crying after that song. Also, the atmosphere here at the scene had reached his peak and he did not want to think what was going to happen next.</p><br/><p>Yet inwardly, he was extremely astonished. To make people cry from singing was not something easy. For those shows that had the audience all in tears, it was the effect of the show trying to pull an act.</p><br/><p>However, right now, it was different. He did not know why he wanted to cry. After listening to the lyrics, he could not hold back his tears.</p><br/><p>This sort of feeling was very wonderful.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The host Cui Wei said, \u201cThe \u2018Strongest Heavenly Voice\u2019 has reached its end. Thank you to the teachers and the contestants for their brilliant performances. For more brilliant performances, stay tuned to Shanghai\u2019s TV network.\u201d</p><br/><p>The \u2018Strongest Heavenly Voice\u2019 which had set the rating record for Shanghai TV had reached its end.</p><br/><p>Originally, there definitely was not going to be such a huge shock. However, after Lin Fan\u2019s song, the show completely changed in an instant.</p><br/><p>Zhao Li said, \u201cTeacher Lin, the song that you sang was really too amazing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan calmly smiled and said, \u201cIt\u2019s not bad.\u201d</p><br/><p>Huo Jian Xiang was standing at the side and said, \u201cThe lyrics were amazing, but the most amazing thing was your voice. I never thought that Teacher Lin\u2019s voice was actually so nice. It has a certain magical power that is capable of touching your heart.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed and he did not know how to reply.</p><br/><p>This was all the power of the \u2018Encyclopaedia Mythical Boost\u2019. If not for the Mythical Boost, he would not have been able to get such a huge response.</p><br/><p>After Wang Ming Yang heard the song, he rubbed his eyes and then couldn\u2019t wait to rush next to Lin Fan, \u201cD*mn brother, why didn\u2019t you tell me you could sing this well? If you told me, I wouldn\u2019t need anyone else. I\u2019d just need you to come up with a few songs and take the world by storm.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLow-key, low-key\u201d Lin Fan was very humble. \u201cIf I were to open my mouth and sing more, do you think that other people will have a chance to make a living? If it were not for me being in this program, I would not have sung today.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang grabbed Lin Fan and said, \u201cCome, let\u2019s go now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGo where?\u201d Lin Fan was stunned. Wang Ming Yang was a little fanatical. The look in his eyes was pretty scary.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang was very excited as he said, \u201cWhere else would we be going? We are going to my office. Once you sign the contract, you\u2019ll become the greatest artist ever. You can release albums and songs to fight against the world.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck, what are you trying to do? I have no interest in singing,\u201d He was not as fanatical as Wang Ming Yang. This b*stard was really thinking too much.</p><br/><p>However, what he was saying did make sense.</p><br/><p>With his abilities right now, if he were to release an album, he would be famous worldwide.</p><br/><p>But was Master Lin the type of person who loved being high-profile?</p><br/><p>He was definitely not.</p><br/><p>What\u2019s the situation with the task now? Why hasn\u2019t he accomplished it? He was getting anxious from waiting.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be like that! Brother, think about this carefully. The two of us working together, there will be no one who can challenge us. Let me tell you\u2026\u201d Wang Ming Yang saw that his brother was going to leave and he immediately rushed after him.</p><br/><p>Huo Jian Xiang and the rest of them saw the two of them walk away and could not help but sigh.</p><br/><p>Especially Huo Jian Xiang who thought about what he said before. For a moment, he felt rather embarrassed.</p><br/><p>Wasn\u2019t this just someone displaying his slight amount of skill in front of an expert?</p><br/><p>He still said that he could beat him in the field of singing and yet, in the end, he was thoroughly beaten.</p><br/><p>Thinking about it, he felt a little awkward.</p><br/><p>Haojiang.</p><br/><p>Yun Xue Yao cried till she was broken into pieces. She didn\u2019t even know where her girlfriends ran off to.</p><br/><p>One of the girls coyly said in a sarcastic tone, \u201cXue Yao, why is your boyfriend\u2019s singing so good? He made everyone cry. My birthday is next month, can you get him to come down and sing?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yun Xue Yao was dazed. She was clearly lost in thought.</p><br/><p>She thought back to the song she had just heard. It was really too good.</p><br/><p>However, she didn\u2019t refute her girlfriends for saying that he was her boyfriend. Regarding that issue, she hasn\u2019t forgotten about it yet and would always remember it by heart.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Shanghai.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian said, \u201cSh*t, this kid\u2019s singing is actually so amazing. Even I, an old timer, have been brought to tears. This is beyond understanding.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Tian He was very old and wouldn\u2019t get emotional as easily as the youngsters these days.</p><br/><p>However, under the power of the Mythical Boost, his old heart also became emotional.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan didn\u2019t know that the song he sang today made many people cry. As long as they heard his voice, they would not be able to escape.</p><br/><p>The Encyclopedia\u2019s Mythical Boost was really too scary.</p><br/><p>It was very scary and many people feared it.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p></div>\n</div>"}

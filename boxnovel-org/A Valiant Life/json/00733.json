This show is just like the same old medicine with a different name. It\u2019s not very meaningful.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAgreed. Because of this, I didn\u2019t watch it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut singing shows have been more popular recently. With this trend, I think its rating should be between 1 and 2.\u201d</p><br/><p>At this point, the news was released.</p><br/><p>\u201cExtra! Extra! \u2018Strongest Heavenly Voice\u2019 takes the first spot in ratings with a strong rating of 3.524. They\u2019ve overcome the reigning Hunan TV to become the hottest show!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn! D*mn! That\u2019s not possible. Hunan TV\u2019s \u2018Where has mommy gone?\u2019 actually got outdone by \u2018Strongest Heavenly Voice\u2019. That doesn\u2019t make sense. Countless celebrities were invited on \u2018Where has mommy gone?\u2019.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs this true? Could it be fake news?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFake my a*s. Didn\u2019t you see Shanghai TV\u2019s official Weibo? They\u2019re already celebrating.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAwesome. Is this show really that good? It can\u2019t be that they bought the ratings, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCheh. Things are strictly controlled nowadays. Who would dare to buy ratings?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHonestly, this show does have its own attractions but I feel like this show is just relying on Master Lin. After watching the first episode for ten minutes, I couldn\u2019t remove my eyes from the screen anymore. Every move and every action that Master Lin made as he sat there gave me the feeling that he was there that night to cause trouble.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c^Big Bro, what you said really resonated with my heart.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The Internet was bustling with noise. Meanwhile, Lin Fan was at Cloud Street, selling scallion pancakes as usual. Of course, he wasn\u2019t too concerned about the ratings.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Director Liu personally called.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, congratulations! The ratings are very hot. And we\u2019ve taken the glorious first place.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDirector Liu, what are you thanking me for? For the ratings to be so hot, it is everyone\u2019s contribution.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be so humble. The main attraction of the show is you. The netizens are all discussing and saying that if it wasn\u2019t for you, the ratings wouldn\u2019t have reached such a high level.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed humbly. He was a humble man. Even if he knew that this was his contribution, he wouldn\u2019t be too self-satisfied. There\u2019s a saying that arrogance makes one deteriorate and humility makes one improve. Lin Fan still wanted to improve, so of course, he had to be a little more humble.</p><br/><p>The two of them chatted for a while more before hanging up.</p><br/><p>In front of the stall.</p><br/><p>The townsfolk were gathered around. \u201cLittle Boss, you\u2019re a famous person now. Give us autographs, will you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, yeah! Little Boss is really special. Even though you\u2019re famous now, you still sell your scallion pancakes everyday. If it was someone else, he or she would\u2019ve run off to search for the pinnacle of life already.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s because of this that I like Little Boss so much. In future, if anyone dares to bully Little Boss, I\u2019ll be the first to get back at them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved his hand humbly. \u201cActually, I\u2019ve also thought about not selling scallion pancakes anymore but once I closed my eyes, I thought about everyone\u2019s supportive smiles. Of course, I can\u2019t stop. In order to let everyone enjoy these freshly-made scallion pancakes, I have to keep on going.\u201d</p><br/><p>*applause*</p><br/><p>\u201cWell said.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Boss, I\u2019ll definitely continue following this show. I can forget about everything else but I definitely won\u2019t forget to watch the show everyday at 8 pm.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, I never thought that our Cloud Street would have its own superstar. On top of that, we even get to eat the superstar\u2019s scallion pancakes. We are really too fortunate.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKeep it low-key. Low-key.\u201d Lin Fan smiled calmly. He waved his hand indifferently. It wasn\u2019t his style to be so high-key.</p><br/><p>In the shop, Fraud Tian looked at Lin Fan, then at the townsfolk and helplessly shook his head. \u201cWhat a bunch of pure and innocent children. They\u2019ve been fooled by this kid.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan looked at Lin Fan in admiration. \u201cBrother Lin is really too amazing. There\u2019s really nothing you can\u2019t do.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian said, \u201cYou Lan, this kind of thinking is very dangerous.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI just have to worship him,\u201d said Wu You Lan with a smile.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian was speechless. He had an urge to just die on the spot. How could there be such a big difference between two fellow humans?</p><br/><p>Nighttime. 8 pm.</p><br/><p>At the scene of \u2018Strongest Heavenly Voice\u2019.</p><br/><p>The mentors had already entered the studio.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan had been busy for the whole day and his life felt plentiful. Moreover, he was filled with energy and he wasn\u2019t one bit tired.</p><br/><p>However, when he saw Zhao Li and Liu Ying Dong, he felt a little strange. Why did the two of them seem so steady today? Moreover, when they looked at him, the only expression they had on their faces was one of displeasure.</p><br/><p>According to usual developments, they should have been coming over to give him a warning. It seemed that they had been suppressed by his presence.</p><br/><p>The audience had entered the place long ago and they were all in eager anticipation.</p><br/><p>Citizens who were camping in front of their computers saw \u2018Strongest Heavenly Voice\u201ds opening scene and were all filled with excitement. They wondered what would happen tonight.</p><br/><p>On the previous day, fifteen contestants had gone up on stage but only six had managed to join the mentors\u2019 teams.</p><br/><p>Three joined Zhao Li. Two joined Liu Ying Dong. One joined Hao Jian Yang.</p><br/><p>Not a single contestant had joined Lin Fan because, the whole time, he did not flash his light at all. This made many of the students feel very helpless. They actually wanted to get chosen by Master Lin the most. It was a shame that Master Lin wouldn\u2019t give them this opportunity.</p><br/><p>The host stepped on stage and once again, the familiar opening speech was delivered. After the previous day\u2019s incident, the host, Cui Wei, had already done ample mental preparations. No matter what happened on the show, he wouldn\u2019t be surprised.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, let\u2019s invite our first contestant on stage.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, backstage, a pair of middle-aged parents shook a young man\u2019s hand. \u201cDo your best, son.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMmm, I will.\u201d Chen Rui An nodded his head solemnly. He had already done all his preparations. Ever since stepping out of the shadow of his past, he had been preparing for \u2018Strongest Heavenly Voice\u2019.</p><br/><p>His biggest dream was to prove himself once more and to become Master Lin\u2019s student.</p><br/><p>He really, really liked Master Lin. Also, he had joined Master Lin\u2019s fan club and became an active fan of his. Although he only knew about Master Lin for a very short time, just within this short period, he had already successfully transformed into a terrifying fanboy. No matter what kind of scandal Master Lin was met with, he would always trust in Master Lin unconditionally.</p><br/><p>Even if there was conclusive evidence against Master Lin, he would still exonerate the person he admired in his mind. This kind of fan was one in a million.</p><br/><p>Stepping on the stage once again, Chen Rui An was a little nervous. It was as if he was recalling what he had experienced two years ago.</p><br/><p>However, the dream in his heart kept him steady. Then, he walked confidently on stage and to the center of the stage.</p><br/><p>\u201cGreetings, mentors. I am Chen Rui An. I come from Jianghai, Wumen County. I\u2019m twenty-three as of today. I like music and the person I admire most is Teacher Lin. The song I\u2019m going to sing is \u2018Clear Skies After Rain\u2019.\u201d</p><br/><p>After the previous day\u2019s happenings, some of the contestants, who had been planning to tell stories to get sympathy, had all decided to stay silent. The pressure that Lin Fan gave them was too immense. They were afraid of being exposed under his piercing gaze.</p><br/><p>As Lin Fan had said, singing was singing. They weren\u2019t there to compare who was more pitiful.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded. \u201cMmm, not bad. You\u2019re very confident. You may begin performing. But if you don\u2019t sing well, even if you admire me, it would be useless.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing his idol\u2019s voice, Chen Rui An\u2019s heart settled down. That little nervous feeling in his heart disappeared. He was only left with a single thought and that was to touch Master Lin with his voice. Then, that would make Master Lin flash his light for him.</p><br/><p>Zhao Li was very displeased with Lin Fan. She realized that this student kept on staring at Lin Fan. Anyone who was close to Lin Fan was her enemy.</p><br/><p>But at this moment, she realized that this young man seemed very familiar. Chen Rui An.</p><br/><p>She mumbled to herself in her heart. Suddenly, it seemed that she had remembered something as a grin appeared on her face.</p><br/><p>Just as Chen Rui An was about to open his mouth, Zhao Li interrupted, \u201cWait a moment.\u201d</p><br/><p>The audience was stunned. Could it be that something was about to go down?</p></div>\n</div>"}

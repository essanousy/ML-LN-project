They had interacted with Elder Lin before and they knew that he was a really capable person. His Chinese arts skills drew their admiration. Now the incident had caused Elder Lin to want to leave the association, it was a monstrous crime.</p><br/><p>Not far away, the teachers in charge of judging the Youth Cup were discussing.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Qiu, something seems to have come up regarding the Youth Cup. Wang Hao Yang\u2019s drawing has drawn suspicion. They suspect that we made an underhanded deal.\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Qiu knew about this but there was nothing he could do. Director Chen had already spoken on this matter, what could he possibly do? One of the leaders\u2019 child wanted to get first prize, they had no choice but to agree.</p><br/><p>The Youth Chinese Arts Cup wasn\u2019t some important competition. Its impact was very small. Hence, whether there was corruption in the judging didn\u2019t matter.</p><br/><p>If it had been a large-scale competition, they wouldn\u2019t have dared.</p><br/><p>But who would\u2019ve thought that even in the small competition, someone would expose their corruption?</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Qiu, do you think we\u2019ll be in trouble? After all, we\u2019re the teachers that did the judging. If things get out of hand, it will be hard for us to explain ourselves.\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Qiu was silent for a moment. At that moment, he saw President Zheng. \u201cLet\u2019s not talk for now. President Zheng is here.\u201d</p><br/><p>When the rest heard this, they looked over quickly. When they saw who had come, they all stood to the side. Although they were association members, they were far from being in the association\u2019s inner circle.</p><br/><p>Zheng Zhong Shan was blazing with rage. But he suddenly stopped in his tracks and looked at Elder Qiu.</p><br/><p>When Elder Qiu saw that the President was looking at him, he smiled and nodded. \u201cPresident Zheng.\u201d</p><br/><p>But what made Elder Qiu feel as if something was wrong was that President Qiu had a strange look in his eyes as he looked at Elder Qiu.</p><br/><p>\u201cPresident, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d asked Elder Qiu cautiously. He was more than ten years younger than the President and he knew about the President\u2019s background. Hence, he was feeling very nervous.</p><br/><p>Elder Zheng took a deep breath and said, \u201cLet me ask you since you were the judge for the Youth Chinese Arts Cup, how did you guys choose the winners for the first and second prize? Were there any underhanded deals? I want you to answer me honestly. I don\u2019t want to hear a single lie.\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Qiu and the rest were dumbfounded. They had never expected even the President to know about this. Moreover, the President looked very displeased.</p><br/><p>At that moment, their hearts were all filled with nervousness.</p><br/><p>Tao Shi Gang was a little angry as well but he held it in. \u201cLil\u2019 Qiu, what exactly is going on. I know you. You definitely wouldn\u2019t do such a thing. Tell me honestly what happened.\u201d</p><br/><p>He had a pretty good relationship with Lil\u2019 Qiu. Naturally, he had to let Lil\u2019 Qiu know the severity of the matter. If Lil\u2019 Qiu tried to hide the truth in front of Elder Zheng, he would probably be kicked from the association.</p><br/><p>At that moment Lil\u2019 Qiu understood the severity of the matter. Then, without hiding anything, he explained the whole situation.</p><br/><p>In the office.</p><br/><p>Director Chen was leisurely smoking a cigarette inside. Then, a phone call came.</p><br/><p>\u201cLeader, what is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLil\u2019 Chen, I\u2019ve heard that there\u2019s been an issue,\u201d said the leader.</p><br/><p>When Director Chen heard this, he smiled, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, leader. This matter is under control. I\u2019ve already clarified things on Weibo. There won\u2019t be any problems.\u201d</p><br/><p>The leader replied, \u201cMmm since you\u2019re taking care of things, I don\u2019t have to worry. I will remember this favor.\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Chen smiled, \u201cThank you, leader.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bam!</p><br/><p>At that moment, the office door was flung open violently.</p><br/><p>Director Chen looked a little displeased. Who was being so rude, entering without knocking? But when he saw who it was, his expression changed instantly. He stood up immediately and said, \u201cPresident Zheng, why are you here?\u201d</p><br/><p>He knew about this old man\u2019s identity. Although the old man was already retired, he still maintained his dignity.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph!\u201d Zheng Zhong Shan snorted. \u201cWho are you talking to?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis\u2026\u201d Director Chen started stammering. Then, he wanted to put the phone back into his pocket but Zheng Zhong Shan would not let him do that.</p><br/><p>\u201cGive me the phone,\u201d said Zheng Zhong Shan sternly as he stepped forward.</p><br/><p>Director Chen was in a tough spot but in front of Elder Zheng, he could only pass the phone over obediently.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m Zheng Zheng Shan. Who are you?\u201d Zheng Zhong Shan knew that the person on the phone was the behind-the-scenes manipulator. He had overheard the conversation just now from outside. However, he held in the rage in his heart. He wanted to see just who it was who dared to do something like this in his association.</p><br/><p>When the person on the other end of the call heard this, he said respectfully, \u201cNice to meet you, Elder Zheng, I\u2019m Lil\u2019 Wang, Wang Cheng.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, Zheng Zhong Shan\u2019s rage completely erupted. \u201cI don\u2019t care who you are. You\u2019ve gone too far. Let me tell you that if I don\u2019t manage to resolve this issue, you can expect to be removed from your appointment.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bam!</p><br/><p>He hung up the call.</p><br/><p>Director Chen just stood there, not daring to move at all. He suddenly realized that this situation had gotten complicated. Elder Zheng\u2019s expression was one of great anger. Then, Director Chen asked meekly, \u201cElder Zheng, what\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still asking me what\u2019s going on? I should be asking you! You were the one who rigged the winners for the Youth Chinese Arts Cup, right? Did you have some kind of deal with that person on the phone just now? I\u2019m only giving you one chance. If you don\u2019t answer me honestly, I\u2019ll have you kicked out of here immediately and I\u2019ll also have you put in jail.\u201d Zheng Zhong Shan said this in a very grave tone. He wasn\u2019t giving the opposition any respect.</p><br/><p>Master Lin wanted to leave the association. To others, perhaps this wasn\u2019t a big issue. However, to them, this was like a thunderstorm.</p><br/><p>When Director Chen heard what Elder Zheng said, he was dumbfounded. He had not expected that Elder Zheng would come because of this incident. He was momentarily lost for words.</p><br/><p>But at that moment, he understood that the man who he challenged on Weibo wasn\u2019t just a simple man.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>On the Internet.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, I\u2019m dying of laughter. Since the Chinese Arts Association uploaded this post, Master Lin has disappeared.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat else could he do? Is he supposed to enjoy being shamed?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. Let him quit the association if he wants. According to my knowledge, countless people want to join the Chinese Arts Association. There must be many people happy that he\u2019s quitting.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck! Hurry up and look at the Chinese Arts Association\u2019s official account. Something big has happened.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? What happened? Could it be that this matter has taken another turn?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSee for yourself.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, people who had been paying attention to this incident all turned their gaze to the Chinese Arts Association\u2019s official Weibo.</p><br/><p>In an instant, cries of shock were emitted from the Internet.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck! Something like this could happen?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chinese Arts Association official Weibo: \u201cSorry, Master Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone couldn\u2019t understand it. The Chinese Arts Association, which had been going against Master Lin a moment ago, suddenly said something like that.</p><br/><p>When they saw the second post, everyone felt as if there was something wrong with their eyes. How could something like that happen?</p></div>\n</div>"}

How did you do that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, you\u2019re great. If I was the one to do it, I could never achieve such a level.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not just you. Even all of us wouldn\u2019t be able to do it together. It\u2019s completely different from our method of hacking.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOur computer has indeed reached its true potential after being placed in Guru\u2019s hands. He\u2019s really too strong!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat goes without saying. All the software in our computer is specialized software. Guru\u2019s abilities were already very strong initially. With the help of these, his skills are simply nature-defying.</p><br/><p>Everyone spoke one after another in shock.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled calmly. This was nothing, just a small show of skill and they were already this shocked.</p><br/><p>These guys said that they were here to discuss technical skills but they were actually here to learn technical skills.</p><br/><p>However, Lin Fan didn\u2019t have anything against it. This was the era of the Internet. The Internet specialists had to have stronger technical skills to prevent invasion of foreign enemies. Therefore, it was fine to teach them a little.</p><br/><p>As for this move that he just did, it was to let them have a clear view of his own abilities. To let them have a deeper understanding of how awesome he was.</p><br/><p>The surrounding convicts had no idea what was going on. Just what the heck was going on in that awesome man\u2019s cell? Why was everyone making such a fuss?</p><br/><p>Sun Neng took out a can of RedBull. \u201cGuru, please drink.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded, \u201cMmm.\u201d Then, he pointed at the computer screen and said, \u201cLook, this is the weak spot on your computer. You all have to take note. If it was me, I would be able to hack into your defense in just a matter of seconds.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh? Really?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled, \u201cHehe, looks like you won\u2019t believe me if I don\u2019t show you. Watch closely.\u201d</p><br/><p>*clicking sounds</p><br/><p>He hands pressed the keyboard in a frenzy.</p><br/><p>*beep beep*</p><br/><p>A warning sound rang out from a notebook computer at the side.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, you\u2019re too amazing, Guru. This move of yours is too amazing. This is Zeus\u2019 Shield V8, the strongest defense system! The world\u2019s largest and most important websites all use this system. Why is it that when it\u2019s in your hands, hacking it is only a matter of seconds?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re too strong. If I haven\u2019t seen it for myself, I wouldn\u2019t dare to believe it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled proudly, \u201cBelieve me now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone nodded, \u201cWe believe you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shen Jie Yun looked from the side and was in disbelief. This was even more impressive than what happened the other day. If they were to hack this defense system, they would need quite some time but this guru did it in an instant.</p><br/><p>If someone with such terrifying skills were to develop any evil intentions, then probably no one would be able to stop him.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was pretty happy. He was happy to teach them as well. They were all computer experts. Although they didn\u2019t understand some parts, as long as Lin Fan explained a little, they would understand in an instant.</p><br/><p>Just a little guidance would be boundlessly rewarding for them.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The next day!</p><br/><p>The detention house was exceptionally lively.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cCome and attack with me. You guys clean up the loose ends. Leave this guy to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sun Neng said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Guru. You can leave this kind of small matters to us.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shen Jie Yun said, \u201cGuru, in front of us is the defense system known as the strongest in Japan, Heaven\u2019s Light. We\u2019ve tried hacking it before but we didn\u2019t succeed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBoss, that was us. If Guru does it personally, it will be but a plaything. He would crack it in an instant.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled, \u201cWatch closely. A marvel is coming. You all have to clean up the loose ends. Otherwise, if they follow our tracks, I won\u2019t be able to bear this responsibility.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Guru. We are the best in the world at cleaning up loose ends. We are famous for guerrilla warfare.\u201d Sun Neng\u2019s neck was turning red. He was clearly very excited.</p><br/><p>Following the Guru and invading others really felt great. It was an indescribable feeling.</p><br/><p>Even defense systems that seemed impenetrable to them were just paper tigers to the Guru.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, it was the first time Lin Fan had felt this refreshing feeling. These guys were learning technical skills from him and they knew their place. He just gave an indication that they were going to hack a certain website in Japan and they all were itching to get on with it.</p><br/><p>But really, these guys\u2019 computer was great to use. It was much better to use than his own computer.</p><br/><p>The strongest defense system in a certain department of Japan was called Heaven\u2019s Light. At this moment, it crumbled in an instant. It simply could not withstand this attack.</p><br/><p>Shen Jie Yun was stunned. He really didn\u2019t dare to believe it. He even developed slight suspicion. Were they really using the same computers?</p><br/><p>Their computers had all been specially assembled but it was definitely impossible to play so many tricks using it. An even better computer would be needed to operate this. However, at that moment, this computer, in the Guru\u2019s hands, was like a handgun that had turned into a canon. It was valiant beyond measure and no one could withstand it.</p><br/><p>Japan.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not good. Someone has hacked our website. The Heaven\u2019s Light defense system has crumbled. Hurry up and start up the second defense system.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust which country dares to hack our website? B*astards. Have you tracked them down yet?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot yet. They\u2019re sweeping up their tracks very quickly. There\u2019s simply no way to follow them. Also, there\u2019s a really great power that is attacking our defense system.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t defend against it. Our defense system has completely collapsed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSir, a great power is directly charging into our important database. We simply cannot stop it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBaka! Pull out the power source, cut off the secondary power source and cut off the network.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><br/><p>*clatter*</p><br/><p>In an instant, the Internet battle room\u2019s computer screens had all turned black. They were left looking at each other.</p><br/><p>Then, they started cheering.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe succeeded.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, we\u2019ve successfully cut off the power. They didn\u2019t successfully hack us in the end.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMmm, not bad. You all reacted very quickly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUsing your superb technical skills, you\u2019ve all safeguarded the Japanese Empire\u2019s dignity once again.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLong live the empire!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLong live the empire!\u201d</p><br/><p>In the detention house.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, that\u2019s f*cking shameless of them. They actually pulled out their power source and even cut off the secondary power source. That\u2019s fast of them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not the first time they\u2019ve done this. When they can\u2019t resist anymore, they\u2019ll either cut off the power source or the network. They\u2019re rascals.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMotherf*ckers. Must they be so shameless? We were this close,\u201d Lin Fan said. But when he looked over at everyone, he realized that they were all looking at him with worshipping eyes.</p><br/><p>Sun Neng said excitedly, \u201cGuru, you\u2019re way too awesome. This is the best I\u2019ve felt during a battle. That tempo was simply indefensible.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c,,,,,.\u201d</p><br/><p>,,,,,,,.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. Guru, just how do you do it? You\u2019ve maximized the power of the computer. Perhaps you\u2019ve even surpassed its limits. This is something completely unimaginable.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shen Jie Yun was thrilled. He hadn\u2019t been this excited in many years. What they did was just an invasion and they weren\u2019t going to cause any destruction but that kind of momentum made him recall his youthful times many years back, when he would cause massacres all over the Internet without any hesitation.</p><br/><p>But later on, with age, he became more peaceful and less rash.</p><br/><p>However, on this day, he once again found that feeling.</p><br/><p>Sun Neng said excitedly, \u201cGuru, can you join us? If Guru joins us, we\u2019ll just specialize in cleaning up loose ends. Guru will take care of the attacking. Who would be able to match us then?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf that really happens, it would be great.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved his hand and smiled. \u201cNah, I won\u2019t join.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone asked, \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said helplessly, \u201cI\u2019m too strong.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone was dumbfounded and they wanted to start cursing. What a ridiculous reason!</p></div>\n</div>"}

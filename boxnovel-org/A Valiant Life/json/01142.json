He was very satisfied with these perfect artificial limbs. The Encyclopedia was really valiant after all.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang nodded. He didn\u2019t know what to say anymore. If he hadn\u2019t seen it for himself, he would never have believed it.</p><br/><p>In the research lab, Little Mei Mei was running about in joy. Going from not being able to stand stably to being able to run with ease, this little girl was overjoyed.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Mei Mei, it\u2019s time to go. We\u2019ll go back to the welfare institute to show the rest of them,\u201d said Lin Fan with a smile. He couldn\u2019t wait to bring Little Mei Mei back to the welfare institute.</p><br/><p>Director Huang and the rest were probably waiting eagerly.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Little Mei Mei really loved running around. Even though she was drenched in sweat, she didn\u2019t get tired of it.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang thought about the situation on the Internet and said, \u201cBrother, what are you going to say on the Internet?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. \u201cNo need to worry about that for now. There are still things I haven\u2019t settled over here. But you have to keep this place secure. All that we have is here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha!\u201d Wang Ming Yang burst out laughing. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. Who would dare to steal anything from here? If anyone dares, he or she would be in deep trouble.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan actually didn\u2019t really care about this. Even if someone stole his things, it would be useless.</p><br/><p>He had developed these artificial limbs not for earning money but to help the crippled become like normal people again.</p><br/><p>The secretary had been by Wang Ming Yang\u2019s side the whole time, staring at that little girl\u2019s legs. She really wanted to see if there were anything abnormal about these artificial limbs. But after a long time, she couldn\u2019t see anything wrong at all.</p><br/><p>Instead, these legs were exactly like a normal person\u2019s legs. They were extremely nimble.</p><br/><p>She couldn\u2019t figure out just how much Master Lin knew. Master Lin was actually able to develop something like this.</p><br/><p>Was there anything he didn\u2019t know?</p><br/><p>Nanshan Children\u2019s Welfare Institute.</p><br/><p>Everyone was waiting. Director Huang was pacing back and forth. She knew that Little Mei Mei had been fetched over to Eastern Han Organization. Master Lin had developed perfect artificial limbs but she had no idea how those perfect artificial limbs were. Had he really succeeded?</p><br/><p>Han Lu said, \u201cDirector Huang, trust in Master Lin. He can definitely do it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMmm, I do trust him. But I can\u2019t stay calm. If it really succeeds, it would be a great joy for the children.\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Huang spoke excitedly. Right now, there were many children in the welfare institute who were crippled.</p><br/><p>In the welfare institute, these children wouldn\u2019t feel any discrimination but she was afraid that the children would receive unsettling gazes from others when they enter society.</p><br/><p>If Master Lin\u2019s perfect artificial limbs were to succeed, it would really be great.</p><br/><p>However, she didn\u2019t know how different these perfect artificial limbs would be. What differences would they have as compared to those artificial limbs on the market?</p><br/><p>If the differences weren\u2019t huge, it probably wouldn\u2019t be enough.</p><br/><p>Thinking about all this, Director Huang started getting anxious.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Director Huang\u2019s phone rang. When she answered, her expression changed. Then, she hung up.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go. Master Lin and the rest are coming.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing that, Han Lu stood up immediately. Even the other teachers did the same as they all rushed towards the main entrance of the welfare institute.</p><br/><p>Master Lin was coming and they had no idea what exactly had happened. They just hoped that it had really succeeded and that the artificial limbs were as perfect as they had imagined.</p><br/><p>A car stopped outside.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan got off the car and opened the passenger door. \u201cCome, get out of the car by yourself. Let\u2019s go back to the welfare institute.\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Mei Mei nodded happily, then got off the car without any issues. To her, these legs really felt like her own legs. There was no difference at all.</p><br/><p>In the distance.</p><br/><p>Director Huang and the rest saw a little figure dashing towards the welfare institute.</p><br/><p>Han Lu was stunned. \u201cDirector Huang, I can\u2019t seem to tell that there\u2019s anything abnormal about her legs.\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Huang nodded. \u201cLet\u2019s go. Let\u2019s go over there quickly.\u201d</p><br/><p>When they saw Little Mei Mei running happily, they were stunned. From her running posture, one couldn\u2019t tell that anything was wrong. She seemed just like any normal person.</p><br/><p>\u201cDirector Granny.\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Mei Mei called out joyfully when she saw them.</p><br/><p>Very soon, Little Mei Mei was in front of Director Huang. There was an excited grin on her face and she was clearly very happy.</p><br/><p>\u201cQuick. Let Granny take a look,\u201d said Director Huang impatiently. Then, she removed Little Mei Mei\u2019s pants and saw a set of perfect artificial limbs. She was astonished.</p><br/><p>Little Mei Mei said, \u201cGranny, my butt feels cold.\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Huang touched those legs with her hands and a look of shock appeared on her face. There was no metal on the external surface of the legs. Although they didn\u2019t feel like real skin, they were soft and tender. Even at the bend of the leg, there was only a very, very narrow chink. If one didn\u2019t look very closely, one wouldn\u2019t be able to notice it.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan walked over. \u201cDirector Huang, do you think this is fine?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. It\u2019s not just fine. This is really brilliant!\u201d Director Huang was so moved that she almost cried. She hadn\u2019t expected that the artificial limbs would turn out like this. They were really perfect.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan squatted down and said. \u201cDirector Huang, these artificial limbs are really good. In the future, she won\u2019t have to take them out. Even if she goes for a bath and she submerges herself completely, there wouldn\u2019t be a problem. Moreover, these will gradually expand according to Little Mei Mei\u2019s growth. They will change proportionally to her body.\u201d</p><br/><p>As he said all this, he actually didn\u2019t understand it as well. However, this was what the Encyclopedia said and the knowledge in his mind was as such.</p><br/><p>Compared to those artificial limbs, these were better and more advanced.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, then these must be very expensive,\u201d said Director Huang inquiringly. She knew that Master Lin had developed these because he wanted to solve the children\u2019s problem. However, such a powerful thing was definitely very pricey.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled and shook his head. \u201cThey\u2019re not expensive. The cost of manufacturing each set is only just over two thousand dollars.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Director Huang heard that, she instantly let out a sigh of relief. That was really not expensive. However, even if they had been expensive, she would have wanted them for the children.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Mei Mei.\u201d At that moment, Lil\u2019 Fatty appeared. When he saw Little Mei Mei standing there, he immediately ran over.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh! Lil\u2019 Fatty is here. I can\u2019t let him see my butt.\u201d Little Mei Mei saw Lil\u2019 Fatty running over and immediately pulled up her pants. \u201cDirector Granny, Uncle Lin, I\u2019m going to play with Lil\u2019 Fatty.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lil\u2019 Fatty came over with his mucus dripping from his nose. Then, he wiped his mucus and said, \u201cLittle Mei Mei, you can walk now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMmm. Uncle Lin made these for me,\u201d said Little Mei Mei cheerily.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great! From now on, you can follow me to other places,\u201d Lil\u2019 Fatty exclaimed in joy.</p><br/><p>\u201cGo on. Go and play.\u201d Lin Fan waved his hand and let the two kids go and play.</p></div>\n</div>"}

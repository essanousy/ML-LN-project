His goal for coming here today was clear, it was to take care of that fatty, Autumn Sword Fish Killer. Although this fatty didn't have any good points, the fact that he had been able to flame Lin Fan for such a long time showed that he had respectable perseverance. Lin Fan was definitely going to cause even greater carnage on the Internet in future, so naturally, he needed someone to help him flame other people on the Internet. Autumn Sword Fish Killer, to Lin Fan, was very good for this purpose.</p><br/><p>In order to find out the location of this wedding, Lin Fan had asked a number of people. Then, he had called some people over to support him by helping him put on a show.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Ou Bai Qi was feeling cheerful as he exited the hotel. He had never expected that he would be able to act high and mighty on top of not losing face that night. This feeling was really great. At the same time, he couldn't figure out what Master Lin was trying to do. Why had he helped him?</p><br/><p>However, seeing how that Master Lin had so spontaneously tried to gain his favor, Autumn Sword Fish Killer decided to stop flaming him. No, he wouldn't stop, but he would flame him less.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Autumn Sword Fish Killer came to the entrance. When he saw that silhouette in front of him, his expression changed slightly. This silhouette looked very familiar.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan scanned Autumn Sword Fish Killer from head to toe. He was indeed an unpleasant sight. He was so overweight that his entire body shape had changed. If he wanted to stop being single, it was simply impossible.</p><br/><p>\"You're Master Lin?\" Autumn Sword Fish Killer had seen pictures of Master Lin before. When he saw him, he thought he looked very similar to the pictures.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded. \"I am.\"</p><br/><p>Autumn Sword Fish Killer scanned Lin Fan from head to toe. His heart was thumping furiously. At the same time, he was a little envious. Lin Fan wasn't just slim, he was also quite good looking. But the main point was that he was talented. When compared to Autumn Sword Fish Killer himself, the difference was quite huge.</p><br/><p>However, Rome was not built in a day and Autumn Sword Fish Killer believed that he would only suffer while he was young. God had given him a challenging youth but when the chance comes, he would definitely rise up and reach the pinnacle of life.</p><br/><p>Lin fan smiled and said, \"How was today? Do you feel very good about yourself?\"</p><br/><p>Autumn Sword Fish Killer asked, \"What are you trying to do?\"</p><br/><p>At that moment, his heart started beating faster. He had always believed that if someone was being too nice, that person must be hiding evil intentions. Moreover, this guy had a sinister look hidden in his smile. This guy definitely wanted to do something bad to him.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan pointed at Autumn Sword Fish Killer and said, \"I think that you're a talent. Work for me and become my Chief Technological Director for Internet Security. How's that?\"</p><br/><p>\"Chief Technological Director for Internet Security?\" Autumn Sword Fish Killer was taken aback. Then, he asked, \"What's that?\"</p><br/><p>\"It's very simple. Just help me to scold people on the Internet from now on,\" said Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Autumn Sword Fish Killer looked at Lin Fan. Then, his fats shook. \"I, Autumn Sword Fish Killer, am a man with an indomitable spirit. You think that I'd help you to do evil deeds? Ever since I've taken charge of the Internet trolls, I, Autumn Sword Fish Killer, knew that the responsibility I carry is large. Every action and every behavior of mine can cause a shift in the direction of the Internet. You want me, Autumn Sword Fish Killer, to become your personal scolding tool? Stop dreaming. Ever since I, Autumn Sword Fish Killer, became an Internet troll, I've vowed to stand on the side of righteousness for the rest of my life.\"</p><br/><p>\"Bai Qi, why did you leave so quickly?\" At that moment, a group of people came out from the hotel.</p><br/><p>The Wu family and those classmates appeared in front of Autumn Sword Fish Killer. Each of them was smiling happily.</p><br/><p>Wu Heng Liang saw Lin Fan and instantly went forward passionately. \"Master Lin, shall we leave together?\"</p><br/><p>\"No need to be so courteous. I have him to send me back.\" Lin Fan waved his hand, then passed his keys to Autumn Sword Fish Killer. \"Go and drive my car over here.\"</p><br/><p>At that moment, Autumn Sword Fish Killer's heart was thumping rapidly. Then, he faced the crowd and laughed. The crowd looked back at him respectfully. This kind of feeling was as if he had found his purpose of existence. Then, he took over the keys and said, \"Yes, boss.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded contentedly. \"He's really not bad. Bai Qi's working ability is great. In the future, it wouldn't be an issue for him to become my trusted aide.\"</p><br/><p>Wu Heng Liang smiled and said, \"Bai Qi, you have to do your work well. For Master Lin to think so highly of you, it's really amazing.\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes, yes.\" Autumn Sword Fish Killer had become a lot more humble now. He didn't want to be exposed.</p><br/><p>Zhang Meng Jun said with a smile, \"I knew that Bai Qi was exceptional all along.\"</p><br/><p>The surrounding classmates said in agreement, \"Yeah!\"</p><br/><p>Autumn Sword Fish Killer was helpless. He could only fall into Lin Fan's grasp.</p><br/><p>Then, he obediently drove the car over.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved at the crowd and said, \"I'm leaving. Let's meet again if we have the chance.\"</p><br/><p>Wu Heng Liang courteously sent Lin Fan off, \"Alright, alright. Be safe, Master Lin.\" Then, he said to Autumn Sword Fish Killer, \"Bai Qi, take good care of your boss.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \"I should be the one taking care of him. He had alcohol. Come, get off the car. Let me drive.\"</p><br/><p>In front of everyone, Autumn Sword Fish Killer was obedient. He didn't dare to be unbridled. He didn't even dare to say a single word for fear of being exposed.</p><br/><p>After the car drove off.</p><br/><p>Wu Heng Liang sighed. \"This Bai Qi will be great in future. This Master Lin is even greater.\"</p><br/><p>He remembered the scene in the private room clearly. So many big shots treated this young Master Lin with so much respect. It was exceptional.</p><br/><p>In the car.</p><br/><p>Autumn Sword Fish Killer said, \"I thank you for what happened today. How about this? I won't scold you anymore in future. We'll each walk our separate paths. You don't humiliate me and I don't scold you. How's that?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \"I don't think that's good. I think that you would be more effective if you work for me.\"</p><br/><p>Autumn Sword Fish Killer looked at Lin Fan. \"Do you think that just because you helped me to gain a little face today, I'm immensely grateful to you? Let me tell you that I, Autumn Sword Fish Killer, am not that kind of person.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \"Your monthly salary will be five thousand.\"</p><br/><p>Autumn Sword Fish Killer laughed. \"People on the Internet don't go back on their words. I won't have a change of heart just for some money.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \"Eight thousand.\"</p><br/><p>Autumn Sword Fish Killer said, \"Do you think I'm the kind of person who would widen my eyes when I see money? Let me tell you that I am not. I, Autumn Sword Fish Killer, have an indomitable will. I will remember your kind favor and I won't scold you from now on, that's all.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan persisted, \"Ten thousand, with a bonus at the end of the year. Let me tell you that this opportunity is hard to come by. If you don't seize it, it would be a great loss.\"</p><br/><p>Autumn Sword Fish Killer said, \"Do you think that's meaningful? Saying eight thousand for a moment, then saying ten thousand the next. What kind of person do you take me as? I'm the Chief of the Internet trolls. With a single command, hundreds follow and I can cause carnage all over the Internet. If you tell me to do something bad, what would happen then?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \"Forget it. Pretend I didn't say anything. Later on, I'll send you home and clarify things with your classmates. I'll let them know that you're actually not my employee.\"</p><br/><p>Autumn Sword Fish Killer looked at Lin Fan and finally said, \"Boss.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled. \"Very good. From now on, you'll work from home and listen to my instructions. Whatever I need to spread on the Internet will be handled by you. Also, whenever I engage in a flame war with someone, you will flame that person with me. Also, please call me Master Lin.\"</p><br/><p>Autumn Sword Fish Killer wanted to cry. \"You planned this all along. From the start, when I agreed that I was your employee, I already fell into your trap.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded. \"That's right. You're very smart.\"</p><br/><p>Autumn Sword Fish Killer looked at the scenery outside, then said, \"You said that my monthly salary will be ten thousand and that there'll be a year-end bonus. Don't cheat an honest man like me.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \"Don't worry. I don't ever cheat honest people.\"</p><br/><p>Autumn Sword Fish Killer: \"...\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

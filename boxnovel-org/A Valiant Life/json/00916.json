As for what would happen later on, that was their problem, not his.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-1\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>But to Lin Fan, since things had come to this, there was nothing more to say. He immediately posted the welfare benefits of working at the welfare institute.</p><br/><p>He viewed the welfare benefits with quite high importance. If his employees didn\u2019t receive satisfactory wages, they might not do their jobs properly.</p><br/><p>When the welfare benefits were released, it stirred up a huge discussion once again. To the netizens, these benefits were way too much. It was even a little scary.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, when I saw Master Lin reveal the wages and benefits, I immediately fell to my knees. May I know if they\u2019re still hiring?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if they are, your chance of getting chosen is close to zero. Just look. Out of so many applicants, they only hired a few. Master Lin\u2019s way of choosing people is quite profound. If you aren\u2019t careful, you\u2019d fall into his trap and you wouldn\u2019t even be able to escape.\u201d</p><br/><p>Most people had been dumbfounded by Lin Fan\u2019s selection method. To them, the difficulty was very high. It was a test of one\u2019s heart.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-2\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>They were all questioning themselves. If it had been them, they might not have met the requirements either.</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang had been observing the situation on the Internet the whole time. When the tides turned, he let out a beaming smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Lin, this matter is finally settled.\u201d To him, Brother Lin had definitely handled the matter well but because he hadn\u2019t revealed the truth earlier, there had been a misunderstanding on the Internet. Now that the misunderstanding had been cleared up, Zhao Zhong Yang was in a terrific mood.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need to think about it anymore. This matter ends here. Now that the welfare benefits are revealed, I wonder how many people are feeling frustrated with themselves now.\u201d Lin Fan laughed. He wasn\u2019t angry at all now, he even felt a little helpless.</p><br/><p>Recently, he had been wanting to just be an ordinary person and enjoy some peace. But other people never gave him the chance.</p><br/><p>Now, things were good. He had finished showing off and what had been done couldn\u2019t be undone anymore.</p><br/><p>Han Lu heaved a sigh of relief as well. Initially, he had been thinking that if Master Lin didn\u2019t explain himself, he would release the video onto the Internet himself to clear up the misunderstanding.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-3\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go to the construction site and check out the situation.\u201d Now, they just had to wait for the construction of the teaching block to be finished. Once that was completed, they would be able to start the school running.</p><br/><p>Those kids had eaten the perfect-grade little intelligence pill before and their IQ had already reached the peak a long time ago. With the appropriate use of that IQ, they would be able to reach levels that would scare others.</p><br/><p>As Zhao Ming Qing had said, after taking the perfect-grade little intelligence pill, the limit of his Chinese medicine skills had risen. Things that he hadn\u2019t understood in the past had suddenly become clear to him.</p><br/><p>Therefore, as long as these kids had someone to guide them, they would definitely do well in the future.</p><br/><p>At the construction site.</p><br/><p>The workers were currently working. They all viewed this project with great importance because they knew that this was a teaching block for the children of the welfare institute. In terms of quality, they wouldn\u2019t let there be a single slip up. They did their best to execute every single step perfectly.</p><br/><p>The supervisor was the same. He was very strict with the requirements for the materials.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin is here.\u201d The supervisor naturally recognized Lin Fan. After all, that incident where he had fought for higher salaries for temporary workers had appeared on the news.</p><br/><p>To them, for a person of high status like Master Lin to do that for temporary workers, it was inconceivable.</p><br/><p>In the depths of their hearts, they held great reverence for Master Lin.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-4\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>The workers, who were busy at work, all stopped what they were doing. They all had good impressions of Master Lin.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was all smiles as he inquired, \u201cHow is it? When can it be completed?\u201d</p><br/><p>The supervisor replied, \u201cSoon. The interior construction is nearing its end. All that\u2019s left are a few small details.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fa nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d</p><br/><p>After a few months, the construction was finally reaching completion. Thereafter, they would be able to get on the right track.</p><br/><p>Then, Lin Fan stayed a while more at the welfare institute before leaving.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t understand the work that they were doing, so it was best to just leave it to the construction workers.</p><br/><p>Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>To the shop owners, the turn of events regarding that incident had been too great. It had left them with no chance to respond.</p><br/><p>Previously, the situation on the Internet had been against Little Boss but they strongly believed that Little Boss would definitely not partake in such unfairness.</p><br/><p>However, when Little Boss had remained silent before the reporters, they had become anxious.</p><br/><p>After all, it was painful for them to see Little Boss being falsely accused on the Internet.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-5\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Now, everything was fine again. Little Boss had revealed the evidence. To them, the evidence clearly showed that Little Boss had been protecting those people who hadn\u2019t been chosen. Little Boss hadn\u2019t wanted to reveal the truth.</p><br/><p>But unexpectedly, those people who had failed to be chosen tried to make a fuss out of this matter on the Internet. That was despicable.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Boss, in my opinion, you shouldn\u2019t have tried to hide the truth.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, those people were really despicable. But it\u2019s all good now. The video is out. I wonder if they\u2019re feeling guilty now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing everyone\u2019s support, Lin Fan felt helpless. How would he have known that things would have turned out like this? However, now that things had been settled, there was nothing more to say.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, alright. This matter has already been settled. Let\u2019s not think about it anymore,\u201d Lin Fan said with a wave of his hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Boss, how can we not think about it? If you hadn\u2019t released the video, who knows how much of a ruckus they would have caused?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. Little Boss, when the teaching block at the welfare institute is completed, will you have an opening ceremony?\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone started asking questions one after another. They all cared about the welfare institute very much. They were all very concerned about the children there.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-6\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Although those children didn\u2019t have families, the shop owners were willing to use whatever power they had to give those children a sense of warmth.</p><br/><p>\u201cOpening ceremony?\u201d Lin Fan scratched his chin. He started to get a little curious. Why hadn\u2019t he thought of that before? Before, he had thought that he would just buy some firecrackers to light up when the construction was done.</p><br/><p>But now that he heard everyone\u2019s excitement, he felt that maybe they could have a ceremony.</p><br/><p>After all, this was his welfare institute. Although they were usually low-key, when it was time to be high-key, they still had to be high-key.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Boss, so are you going to have an opening ceremony or not?\u201d they asked once more.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan did not hesitate at all. \u201cWe are. Of course we are. But it hasn\u2019t been completed yet. Once it has been completed, I\u2019ll inform you all. We have to make it a grand ceremony.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p></div>\n</div>"}

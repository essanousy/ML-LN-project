Why are you here at my place?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Tao really hated this guy to death but he had no choice. His illness still hadn\u2019t been completely treated yet. He had never dared to imagine that something like this would happen but even if he was done for, he still had to recover his health.</p><br/><p>The police officers knew that this man was a godly doctor. Naturally, they were very courteous, \u201cGodly doctor, nice to meet you. We are here to escort Wu Tao over. Mainly due to his health, he hasn\u2019t been able to survive in prison by himself. According to his requests, he has to come to you to seek treatment.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh? You want to recover your health?\u201d said Lin Fan with a grin.</p><br/><p>Wu Tao had nothing to say. He already knew his outcome. He had a life sentence and he would idle in prison for the rest of his life but even if he was to be in prison, he still had to get his body treated. Otherwise, he would get bullied to death in prison.</p><br/><p>When he had been captured, he had confessed to everything during the hearing and received leniency as a result. Hence, when he brought up this request, he managed to get approval. After all, if he stayed in prison in his state, it would be an issue too.</p><br/><p>The accompanying police officers didn\u2019t say much else. This matter didn\u2019t concern them. Even if this godly doctor refused to treat him, they wouldn\u2019t try to persuade the doctor.</p><br/><p>Wu Tao said, \u201cI\u2019ve already been sentenced to prison and my life is pretty much done for. Could you just treat me back to health?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSigh,\u201d Lin Gan sighed, \u201cDoctors are kind-hearted. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want to treat you but have you seen my Weibo recently? During this recent period, I\u2019ve overworked myself, causing me to have insufficient inner strength. I won\u2019t be able to help you in the next ten years. It\u2019s best if you go back to where you came from. My dear policemen, thank you for your trouble.\u201d</p><br/><p>The police officers smiled and said, \u201cAlright, godly doctor. Well, sorry for disturbing you.\u201d</p><br/><p>They didn\u2019t want someone like this to recover back to health. The government was empathetic and it had agreed to his request for him to come and have a try. But now that the godly doctor had rejected him, there was no need to try and convince him.</p><br/><p>However, Wu Tao barked in anger, \u201cYou b*stard! You\u2019re just standing idly and watching someone die!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shook his head, \u201cSigh, I can\u2019t help you. I don\u2019t have enough inner strength.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Wu Tao glared at Lin Fan. He didn\u2019t even know what to say anymore. Then, he said, \u201cAlright, I\u2019ll come back in ten years.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was in a pretty good mood. He replied, \u201cSure, come back in ten years. Wait for my inner strength to recover.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Tao\u2019s thought to himself, \u201cCould this really be true?\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, Elder Chen, who had already been discharged for a period of time, arrived.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Boss, please save me.\u201d After being discharged, Elder Chen had gone to ask Little Boss to treat his illness but he had been rejected. Afterward, he was filled with regret. At that moment, he came with a sullen look on his face.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. \u201cElder Chen, I already told you back then but you didn\u2019t believe me. You believe me now, right? But your operation has already been done and you\u2019re recovering pretty well. I\u2019ll take a look for you to ensure you won\u2019t have a relapse.\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Chen was filled with gratitude. \u201cI love you, Little Boss. But didn\u2019t you say on your Weibo that you have insufficient inner strength?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved his hand and said, \u201cShh, that\u2019s just a lie for idiots.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Tao felt a rush of anger come up in his heart. \u201cYou\u2026you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan glanced at him and said, \u201cWhy are you still here? My comrades, please take him away. And I just don\u2019t want to treat you. What are you going to do about it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Wu Tao had nothing to say. He was miserable and furious beyond measure. He knew that he was in this situation due, in a large part, to this kid.</p><br/><p>But even if he wanted revenge, it wasn\u2019t possible. He was already in prison and he had even ratted out a number of people. There were quite a number of people who hated him now. Even if he managed to get out of prison in future, he would still be miserable.</p><br/><p>Looking at this kid\u2019s face that was just asking to be hit, he had no options even though his heart was unyielding.</p><br/><p>Elder Chen looked at Wu Tao, who was leaving, and asked, \u201cLittle Boss, who is that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRecently, on the internet, there\u2019s been news about a bribery case in Jiangning. He\u2019s the boss behind it, Wu Tao,\u201d said Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Elder Chen was taken aback. \u201cHe\u2019s that Wu Tao? Why did the police bring him here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled and said, \u201cHe wanted me to treat his illness but don\u2019t you think that\u2019s impossible?\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Chen nodded, \u201cIndeed. Treating this kind of person would simply be dirtying your hands.\u201d</p><br/><p>The next day!</p><br/><p>Lin Fan had prepared all the tools. The great back-scrubbing cause was about to officially begin.</p><br/><p>This eleventh page of knowledge wasn\u2019t forcing him to complete the task but he himself wanted to complete it, mainly because when he saw that it had the Encyclopedia\u2019s mystical boost, he really wanted to know what effect the boost would have on back-scrubbing.</p><br/><p>Nighttime.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Boss, where are you going?\u201d asked the shop owners who passed by.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied with a smile, \u201cI\u2019m going to Elder Zeng\u2019s bathhouse to do back-scrubbing work.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh d*mn. What?\u201d The shop owners were all stunned. When they came back to their senses, Little Boss had already left with his things towards Elder Zeng\u2019s bathhouse.</p><br/><p>The shop owners shook their heads and said, \u201cLittle Boss really loves to joke. If he\u2019s going to shower, he should just say so. Who would believe that he\u2019s going to do back-scrubbing work?\u201d</p><br/><p>In the shop.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Zeng?\u201d Lin Fan saw that Elder Zeng wasn\u2019t at the counter. However, one of the service staff at the counter saw Lin Fan and said with a smile, \u201cLittle Boss, our boss is out. He said that when you arrive, you may go in first. He\u2019s already reserved a good spot for you. This is your number plate.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d Lin Fan nodded and took the number plate. Then, he went to the back, the staff\u2019s changing room.</p><br/><p>The people inside all recognized Lin Fan. Who would not have known of Cloud Street\u2019s Master Lin? Moreover, they had all seen that recent piece of news and were in admiration of Little Boss. To them, he was simply a godly being.</p><br/><p>In the changing room.</p><br/><p>Uncle Liu, who was in charge of giving towels to the customers, smiled and said, \u201cLittle Boss, you really came.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan started to remove his clothes. At the same time, he said, \u201cOf course. If I said I would come, I will definitely come.\u201d</p><br/><p>Uncle Liu laughed. He really couldn\u2019t understand young people. \u201cYour workstation is the first one. It was specially reserved for you by our boss.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, thank you.\u201d Lin Fan took off his clothes and also put on a pair of underwear. He didn\u2019t like to be naked. It just didn\u2019t feel good.</p><br/><p>Doing back-scrubbing this time, Lin Fan felt a little nervous. If he was too good at scrubbing, what would he do?</p><br/><p>He had to be low-key.</p><br/><p>He thought for a long while.</p><br/><p>\u201cI need a back scrub. Anyone?\u201d a young man from the pool yelled out.</p><br/><p>Three of the other back-scrubbers were all busy and there was no one else at the moment. Lin Fan smiled and replied, \u201cComing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Uncle Liu smiled, \u201cLittle Boss\u2019 luck is really good. You just came and you\u2019ve already met someone who wants a back scrub.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said cheerily, \u201cLooks like I\u2019ll have to demonstrate my skill.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEncyclopedia\u2019s mystical boost, show me what powers you have!\u201d Lin Fan thought.</p><br/><p>He was filled with eager anticipation.</p></div>\n</div>"}

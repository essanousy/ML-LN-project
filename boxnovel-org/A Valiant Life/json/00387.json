According to the records, out of 365 children, only 160 of them were not disabled. Even so, they had some minor issues with their bodies. The remaining 205 children all had major problems with their bodies. 35 of them had their arms or legs cut off. Even though his medical ability was nature-defying, he couldn't make them grow back their limbs.</p><br/><p>After recording all the major and minor issues, Lin Fan was prepared to start taking action. But before he started grooming them, he had to help their bodies heal first.</p><br/><p>Director Huang didn't know what Master Lin was doing. It seemed very serious and she was curious but she didn't ask much.</p><br/><p>Ding!</p><br/><p>A call came from Fraud Tian.</p><br/><p>\"Where are you? An old man came to the shop, he's called Zhao Ming Qing and he's looking for you. He says he's your disciple,\" Fraud Tian asked curiously.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \"Ask him to wait for a while. I'll be back soon.\"</p><br/><p>He didn't expect Zhao Ming Qing to come to his shop today. He was just about to go grab some medicine when he met this old Chinese doctor. It was a pretty good coincidence. He could get him to help.</p><br/><p>After hanging up, Lin Fan looked at Director Huang, \"I'm going back first. I might come back here in the afternoon.\"</p><br/><p>Director Huang personally sent Lin Fan to the entrance. The children waved goodbye to Lin Fan as well as they sent him off.</p><br/><p>The Encyclopedia's Encyclopedic points weren't as hard to earn as expected. It was just that he never that those kind of thoughts. He had always thought that there was no point working so hard. It was better to just enjoy his life properly. But now that he had a goal, of course, he had to put in some hard work.</p><br/><p>Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing was sitting there, drinking the tea that Wu You Lan had carried over. Fraud Tian and the rest looked curiously at this old man, wondering where he came from and what he meant when he said he was Lin Fan's disciple. When did that kid start taking disciples?</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing was very excited at that moment. He had called all his good friends the previous night. He thought very highly of becoming the disciple of this master. To him, being able to learn medical skills from a real godly doctor was the most exciting this in his life.</p><br/><p>He had to choose an auspicious date to become Master Lin's disciple. After all, it was a big event, how could he not carry it out properly?</p><br/><p>At a certain corner of Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>Two men were sneakily hiding behind the corner of the wall.</p><br/><p>These two men were Zhao Ming Qing's eldest and second eldest sons.</p><br/><p>\"Big bro, what do you think Dad is doing here?\" Zhao Bin asked uncertainly. The previous night's happenings were still fresh in their memories. Their father's abnormal behavior had drawn their attention, hence, when their father went out, the two of them sneakily followed behind. They wanted to find out what was going on.</p><br/><p>Zhao Li Xing shook his head and replied, \"I don't know. Let's take a look first. If Dad is really being tricked, we'll have to stop it no matter what. And we'll teach the trickster a lesson as well.\"</p><br/><p>The two of them weren't people who were easy to deal with. If they didn't know about their father's temper, they would've gone out and settled matters right then. However, because they knew about their father's temper, they decided to stay calm. After all, if they exposed themselves before getting concrete evidence, their father wouldn't realize his mistake, instead, their father would go into a rage. The two of them might not be able to withstand his rage.</p><br/><p>\"Master Lin.\" Zhao Bin looked at the words at the storefront. He felt as if he had heard it somewhere before. But at that moment, he didn't think too much of it. He had to clear up this matter first.</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing looked around the shop. He asked, \"Are you all my Master's people?\"</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian asked, \"By Master, you mean Lin Fan?\"</p><br/><p>\"Mmm,\" Zhao Ming Qing nodded, \"Yes, but looking at your shop, it doesn't seem like a clinic.\"</p><br/><p>\"Clinic?\"</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian and the rest were puzzled. They had no idea what this old man meant. Since when did this place become a clinic?</p><br/><p>Just at that moment, Lin Fan returned.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing looked at Lin Fan, then, he immediately stood up and greeted politely, \"Teacher\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed embarrassedly. He really wasn't used to being called 'Teacher' by an old man. But he believed in himself. As long as that old man greeted him a few more times, he would surely get used to it.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian pulled Lin Fan aside and asked, \"Who is that old man? Why is he calling you 'Teacher'?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled, \"Didn't I tell you all before that my medical skills are great? Ever since this old man witnessed my medical skills, he's been bowled over by me.\"</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian said in a very serious tone, \"Can you be more serious?\"</p><br/><p>\"I'm very serious. I'm not kidding you,\" said Lin Fan as he looked at Fraud Tian.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian sighed helplessly. He could see through less and less of Lin Fan now. He had no idea if what this guy was saying was true or not.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan beckoned with his hand and Zhao Ming Qing immediately came forward. \"Teacher, what instructions do you have for me?\"</p><br/><p>\"Follow me to grab some medicine. I'll bring you to expand your knowledge today,\" said Lin Fan calmly.</p><br/><p>When Zhao Ming Qing heard this, he was stunned. His heart started beating uncontrollably. To him, this expanding of knowledge must have meant going to see some sick people. He was obsessed with Chinese Medicine and he was crazy about various kinds of complicated and difficult illnesses. To have his teacher lead him in seeing illnesses, the outcome would naturally be different.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan asked, \"You have legal methods to go grab some Chinese medicine, right?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes, yes.\" Zhao Ming Qing hurriedly nodded. He was the person-in-charge of Shanghai's First Chinese Medical Academy. How could he not have methods?</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>\"Big bro, look, Dad just left with a young man. Do you think that young man is the trickster who's tricking our Dad?\" asked Zhao Bin.</p><br/><p>Zhao Li Xing's brows furrowed as he said, \"That is very likely. Look at how Dad is following him so closely as if he's being very obedient. He must have been lied to.\"</p><br/><p>Zhao Bin shook his head, \"Sigh, Dad's medical abilities are top-notch but there are all kinds of trickery in today's society. Some can't be seen through even with Dad's experience. But let's not scare him away yet. We have to see what's going on. If this guy brings Dad to the bank, we'll call the police immediately.\"</p><br/><p>Zhao Li Xing nodded, \"That's the only way. These tricksters nowadays are too unbridled. They even dare to lie to our Dad. They must be crazy.\"</p><br/><p>\"They're going. Let's follow them.\"</p><br/><p>The two of them stealthily hid there until their father boarded the young man's car. Then, they hurriedly followed behind the car.</p><br/><p>In the car.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing was so emotional that his face was red. He was looking through his teacher's notebook. He recognized the various names of medicine on the notebook. But he didn't know what kind of healing effect it had when all these were mixed together. And next to these medicines, there were some words written.</p><br/><p>\"Broken leg, loss of feeling, use medicine\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"Broken hand\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"Teacher, according to my knowledge, the success rate of stimulating vitality for a case of a broken leg is very low. If it has happened for too long or if it was caused by someone, the nerves inside would already be dead. This\u2026\" Zhao Ming Qing steadily spoke as the beard under his chin started to shake.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan turned around, \"Can you keep quiet?\"</p><br/><p>\"Teacher, I don't understand. That's why I'm asking.\" Zhao Ming Qing was very excited.</p><br/><p>\"Shut up,\" said Lin Fan sternly. This old man was already so old, why was his heart still so unstable? He was like a little kid who had never seen anything before.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing immediately shut up but as he saw the contents of the notebook, he kept thinking in his mind. What on earth would these medicinal ingredients be used for if they were mixed together?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

They weren't particularly interested in food but to the shop owners, the main star of the show was here.</p><br/><p>The aroma slowly filled the air. When they saw the dishes, the shop owners were stunned. The dishes looked as beautiful as art pieces. Furthermore, as the dishes came nearer to them, the aroma filled the air. They felt the urge to eat them but they didn't as they thought of the current situation. Then, along with the children, they said, \"Let's dig in, let's dig in\u2026\"</p><br/><p>The children that were attracted to the show also smelled the aroma. Then, they were all stunned as they saw the dishes on the table.</p><br/><p>Besides these children, the shop owners were also attracted to the dishes.</p><br/><p>A child that lacked a limb was mesmerized by the smell. His eyes stared intently at the dishes before him. \"Uncle, I want to eat some\u2026\"</p><br/><p>He spoke softly and gently as if he was afraid.</p><br/><p>The shop owners reacted, \"Alright, alright. I will get some dishes for you.\"</p><br/><p>The 'tomato chicken' dish looked amazing. It was all red and the chicken meat was covered in sticky tomato sauce. It looked extremely delicious.</p><br/><p>The children stuffed pieces of chicken into their mouths. When the meat entered their mouths, their expressions changed. They couldn't control their emotions. \"Uncle, I want more, I want more\u2026\"</p><br/><p>The show had brought happiness to the children and the food helped them to speak as if they had forgotten everything that happened.</p><br/><p>When the delicious food entered their mouths, their taste buds were tantalized. Even their hearts were infected with love for the food.</p><br/><p>This scene wasn't a rare sight in the canteen. Many of these children had such facial expressions when they tasted this deliciousness.</p><br/><p>Director Huang stood behind them. She was shocked when she witnessed the scene. Initially, she had thought that she had to be patient with these children for them to open up. She hadn't expected things to be done so quickly.</p><br/><p>As each beautifully made dish was being presented, the entire canteen was filled with an unbearable aroma. The shop owners forcefully swallowed their saliva as they witnessed the children eat with such pleasure. Even they felt unbearable.</p><br/><p>\"Uncle, I want more.\"</p><br/><p>The shop owner said, \"It's a little hot. Let uncle blow it for you.\" Then, he took a small bite of the meat and pretended to blow at it. \"It's not hot anymore.\"</p><br/><p>The child said, \"Uncle, you ate half the meat\u2026\"</p><br/><p>The boss quickly swallowed the small piece of meat. The taste was simply too d*mn good. It was a masterpiece by Master Lin. It was so satisfying.</p><br/><p>However, in order to answer the children, the shop owner gently coughed, \"The meat simply contracted as it lost heat. Come, let's eat another dish. Let me blow it for you again.\"</p><br/><p>The children were speechless. \"...\"</p><br/><p>The atmosphere in the canteen was really lively. Everyone was mesmerized by the culinary skills of Lin Fan. To them, everything tasted like heaven on earth. It was a special and unique feeling. They couldn't describe the feeling of eating the dishes. They hadn't known that Master Lin's culinary skills were that good. It was law-defying.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang was also dumbfounded after he secretly ate a piece of meat. The taste was simply impossible to describe. It was too d*mn delicious. It tasted even better than those made by international chefs.</p><br/><p>It was unmatched.</p><br/><p>In the kitchen.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was extremely busy and his forehead was filled with sweat. But he wasn't bothered at all. He wanted to let everyone be as happy as possible.</p><br/><p>He continued hustling until he finished the last dish. When the dish was served, he heaved a sigh of relief. It was finally done.</p><br/><p>When he approached the canteen, he smiled as he witnessed that the children were mesmerized by the food. To Lin Fan, that was extremely satisfying.</p><br/><p>The shop owners said, \"Master Lin, come here!\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled as he saw that every single dish had been completely eaten. Even though he cooked everything, he didn't even have an opportunity to eat anything.</p><br/><p>The activities continued until the afternoon.</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian was in awe of Lin Fan. It was the first time that he had tasted such delicious food. It was simply one of the greatest surprises of his life.</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian patted Lin Fan on his shoulder. \"The parent of one of the children has arrived. Do you want to have a look?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was a little taken aback. He worriedly asked, \"What's the situation with the kid?\"</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian sighed, \"He has a missing limb.\"</p><br/><p>He knew exactly what Master Lin was worried about. After that incident, he was also afraid of it. If it was like the previous incident, it would be a second heavy blow to the children. Sometimes, he wished that these handicapped children wouldn't have to face such trauma again but things were out of his control.</p><br/><p>In the office.</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan and Liu Xiao Tian entered the office, Director Huang was speaking to a middle-aged woman. The woman looked thin and pallid.</p><br/><p>The middle-aged woman went towards Liu Xiao Tian. \"Is my child here?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the situation and wasn't sure what was going to happen. But he had to face the truth no matter what.</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian nodded. \"He is currently outside. But I have to inform you about your child. I hope you can be mentally prepared.\"</p><br/><p>The middle-aged woman shook her head. \"I've been looking for him for six years. I can accept anything. I want to see my child right now.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan opened the door to let the child enter the room.</p><br/><p>As the child had been tortured by the human traffickers. He was frail and weak. His psychological health wasn't good either.</p><br/><p>When the middle-aged woman saw the boy, she was extremely emotional. She looked at the boy's eyes and face and she could confirm that he was the child that she had lost. She immediately went forward to hug him and felt the empty sleeve. Lin Fan and the rest weren't sure of what was going to happen.</p><br/><p>The middle-aged woman grabbed onto the empty sleeve and looked at her child. Her tears started to flow down her face. Then, she hugged the boy even tighter.</p><br/><p>\"No matter what you become like, I will never forsake you. You are my precious treasure. I will protect you and you will never end up in the hands of the evil again,\" the middle-aged woman cried.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan and Liu Xiao Tian looked at each other and they smiled. Although sometimes things were infuriating, there were instances that moved them too.</p><br/><p>The child looked a little happier as he was being hugged by the woman. After all, blood is thicker than water. Then, he rested his head on the woman's shoulder. He patted her back with his only arm. \"Mommy\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian smiled. He allowed them to interact for a while before saying, \"Let's process the documents.\"</p><br/><p>The middle-aged woman held the child's hand and nodded. She was extremely grateful to them. She immediately took out her personal identification. This was a moving sight to Lin Fan and the others. There was still some hope in this world. If their opinions were swayed by solely the negative occurrences, things would be awful for them.</p><br/><p>Everything was processed smoothly.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled at Liu Xiao Tian. \"I feel so much better after this. That day, too, I only focused on the bad occurrences but there were actually so many other parents that were willing to accept their children.\"</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian nodded. \"Yeah. I heard the people on Cloud Street have agreed to come here on the 20th of each month?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded, \"This was all initiated by the people on Cloud Street. Although they aren't able to help a lot of people, they wanted to be involved in this to help these children out.\"</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian smiled. \"Should I do an announcement for you guys? The world should know about this.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved his hands. \"It's okay. You should know how the netizens are these days. People would say that it's all an act. Let's take it slow. Furthermore, they didn't agree to do this to fish for compliments. There's no need to advertise it.\"</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian lamented, \"You're the most responsible young man I've ever seen.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. \"You're the only policeman I know that loves to be at the forefront of things.\"</p><br/><p>The both of them just looked at each other and laughed.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

He was angry in his heart too but he was Master Lin now. He wasn\u2019t at the level of a bunch of children. There was no need to act out of his anger.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-1\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>The people who had failed to get chosen had conflict in their hearts. Letting it out would make them feel better.</p><br/><p>He was Master Lin after all. And he knew that letting the truth out would only do them more harm.</p><br/><p><em>If I don\u2019t go to hell, who would go to hell? Let me bear all the troubles.</em></p><br/><p><em>Forget it. Let\u2019s play a game of Arena of Valor first. I haven\u2019t played in almost two months. My Li Bai is definitely 6.</em></p><br/><p>When Zhao Zhong Yang saw that Brother Lin was still in the mood to play games, he really respected him.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan stood behind Brother Lin, watching him focused on playing the game. She was watching him with great interest.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-2\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Since Brother Lin had already said not to bother about the matter, she wouldn\u2019t bother about it. As for what was going on on the Internet, they would just let it be.</p><br/><p>*Ring ring*</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, f*ck! Why is that Wang Ming Yang calling me?\u201d Lin Fan had been controlling his hero, getting ready for a kill, but his plan got ruined by the call.</p><br/><p>And he could already predict that he was going to get f*cked by the opponent.<em>Forget it, I\u2019ll just answer the call.</em></p><br/><p>\u201cHey, what is it? Do you know that your call made me sacrifice my life?\u201d said Lin Fan in an annoyed tone.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? What are you talking about?\u201d Wang Ming Yang was startled. Then, he didn\u2019t bother about that and just asked, \u201cBrother, what\u2019s up with that incident on the news? How could a recruitment turn out like this? Did you not tell them something?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing much. Just a small matter. No need to explain, just let them be.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang said, \u201cD*mn, you\u2019re not even going to explain yourself? Things have gotten out of hand. Look at the discussion on the Internet. Just looking at it made me feel unhappy. I\u2019ve already opened tens of sub-accounts to help you clear your name. Look at how much I love you. Hurry up and thank me.\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-3\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cThank your sister! Wait, why does it feel like there\u2019s something wrong with what you just said?\u201d Lin Fan was stunned. Then, he came back to his senses. \u201cF*ck your mom! You f*cking gay, get away from me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, enough jokes. For real, it\u2019s best if you clarify things. You are representing a welfare institute, which is different from other organizations. If you don\u2019t explain yourself, it wouldn\u2019t be good for your welfare institute.\u201d Wang Ming Yang had really thought about this sincerely.</p><br/><p>Welfare institutes were under heavy scrutiny from society. If there was any corruption or unfairness involved, it would give the welfare institutes a bad name. Although it wouldn\u2019t be too much of a problem, it would still leave a bad impact.</p><br/><p>\u201cI got it. I\u2019m hanging up,\u201d said Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Then, he looked at the game and was dumbfounded. All four of his teammates were flaming him, while the opponents were encouraging him to keep on idling.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Lin Fan couldn\u2019t take it anymore. He immediately started going all out.</p><br/><p>After a tough battle, they finally lost the game.</p><br/><p>Li Bai: 0-12-1</p><br/><p>He had died 12 times. How awesome. When he went back to the main page, he immediately got reported by his four teammates. How awesome.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing had gone to Beijing for a few days already. Lin Fan decided to give him a call to inquire about how he was doing.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-4\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cMing Qing, how are things over there?\u201d asked Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing, who was far away in Beijing, was just performing acupuncture on Ma Jun Guo. When he saw his teacher calling, he immediately answered.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, things are pretty good. I haven\u2019t come across any issues.\u201d He had only found out who he was treating after arriving at the scene. At that time, he had been slightly shocked. Afterward, when remembered that time when his teacher had rejected the request, he became very moved.</p><br/><p>He hadn\u2019t thought that his teacher would reject an invitation from such a big shot all because of him.</p><br/><p>With Zhao Ming Qing\u2019s past medical ability, he definitely would not have been able to treat this illness but now, although it was still a little challenging, it wasn\u2019t too difficult for him anymore. He already had a way to treat it.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good that you haven\u2019t come across any issues. Alright then, I\u2019m hanging up. Once you\u2019re done, come back earlier,\u201d said Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>After hanging up, Lin Fan just lay there. \u201cYou Lan, help me massage my body. My brain is feeling uncomfortable.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Wu You Lan nodded. She knew that Brother Lin must have been having a headache. After all, the matter on the Internet was quite frustrating.</p><br/><p>Soon after, noises came from outside.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Fraud Tian was smoking as he became curious. When he looked outside, he cried out in shock, \u201cKid, it\u2019s bad. The reporters are here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan opened his eyes. He was a little annoyed. He hadn\u2019t expected the reporters to come. This was troublesome.</p><br/><p>The reporters were very interested in that day\u2019s news. They all knew that Nanshan Children\u2019s Welfare Institute was managed by Master Lin. Seeing that such a scandal had occurred, they naturally wanted to get the full picture.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-5\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>They wanted to hear just what Master Lin had to say about this incident.</p><br/><p>In an instant, the reporters had surrounded the shop.</p><br/><p>The surrounding shop owners were all a little curious.</p><br/><p>\u201cSister Hong, what\u2019s happened with Little Boss this time? Why are the reporters all here so diligently?\u201d</p><br/><p>Sister Hong said, \u201cI saw on the news that there was an issue about the Children\u2019s Welfare Institute\u2019s teacher recruitment. They\u2019re saying there\u2019s corruption involved. I don\u2019t know what the full situation is. I think the reporters are probably here to find out the full situation as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s hurry and go take a look.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat for? Don\u2019t cause more of a mess for Little Boss,\u201d said Sister Hong.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The reporters were all eager to ask questions.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, regarding yesterday\u2019s teacher recruitment for the welfare institute, what exactly were the requirements?\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-6\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cCapital Normal University\u2019s students failed to be chosen. Was it because they lacked scholarly knowledge, or was it something else?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, did you see the situation on the Internet? What do you think about it? What the people who failed to be chosen said, is that true?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, could you please say a few words?\u201d</p><br/><p>Facing these reporters, Lin Fan kept of smiling. \u201cMy dear reporters, I do not wish to say much regarding this incident for now.\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporters were stunned and it seemed that they didn\u2019t recover from their daze.</p><br/><p>Was this still the Master Lin that they knew?</p><br/><p>In the past, when things happened, he would always have a whole lot to say. But now, he actually didn\u2019t want to say anything.</p><br/><p>At that moment, a bad feeling arose in their hearts and minds.</p><br/><p>Could it really be like what those people had said?</p><br/><p>Was there really corruption involved?</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-7\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>If that was really the case, they would feel regretful. After all, this Master Lin before them wouldn\u2019t be the same Master Lin that they knew anymore.</p><br/><p>In their hearts, Master Lin had always been righteous. For there to be such a Master Lin in this society was what they, as reporters, wanted to see the most.</p><br/><p>But now that Master Lin had chosen to remain silent about the matter and just face them with a smile, it made them a little disappointed.</p></div>\n</div>"}

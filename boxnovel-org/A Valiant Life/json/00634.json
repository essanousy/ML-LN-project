Godfather Ma just got in the car. We must go and see. If Godfather Ma really goes to turn himself in, in afraid the repercussions would be huge.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have an event later and I invited Godfather Ma as the guest of honor. Who on earth stole him from me?\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, all the people around were panicking. They immediately got into their cars and followed the car that Godfather Ma was in. Where on earth was Godfather Ma headed to?</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t tell us that he really is going to the police station.</p><br/><p>If that was for real, the repercussions would be huge, and it wasn\u2019t going to be any ordinary consequence.</p><br/><p>Qing Zhou was about to be turned upside down.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Inside the car!</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was taking out his phone while driving, as he gave Chen Chang a call.</p><br/><p>Director Qin had passed this phone number to him. The number belonged to Director Chen from Qing Zhou police station.</p><br/><p>Night time, eight o\u2019clock.</p><br/><p>The police station.</p><br/><p>Chen Chang Ping was sorting out the files in his hands. He heaved a huge sigh as he plopped his body against his chair.</p><br/><p>He was disappointed at how Qing Zhou had turned out. It was a city that was controlled by a gang of bad people and ever since he had graduated from the police academy, he had been working in the police force for more than thirty years. After rising to the more senior position, he had planned to make the city a safer and more harmonious place to stay in by eradicating the gang that controlled the city.</p><br/><p>Only after rising to that position did he realize how Qing Zhou really was.</p><br/><p>Even as the director of the police force, he was a useless figure.</p><br/><p>What did Ma Qing Zhou not know? He had full control over Qing Zhou, countless men under him and it was almost as if he created the rules in the city.</p><br/><p>\u201cDirector Chen, it\u2019s rather late, you should go home to get some rest,\u201d a police officer said.</p><br/><p>He had the utmost respect for Director Qin, and he saw the Director as a hero.</p><br/><p>Chen Chang Ping waved him away. \u201cNo problem, but I still have some work to do. Right, how is the case at the southern part of the city coming along? Have you guys caught the murderer?\u201d</p><br/><p>The police officer shook his head awkwardly.</p><br/><p>\u201cStill haven\u2019t caught him huh?\u201d Chen Chang Ping said helplessly.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, not that.\u201d The police officer hesitated for a moment, before continuing. \u201cActually, we already found a lead, but the clue points to Ma Qing Zhou. Director, you know what happens in Qing Zhou\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Chang Ping lowered his head in disappointment after hearing what the police officer said. He had been working against Ma Qing Zhou for ages to no avail.</p><br/><p>When he had first started his position, he would continue to pursue the case no matter what, relentlessly pursuing the criminal after getting any lead.</p><br/><p>And one time, he had caught three of Ma Qing Zhou\u2019s men.</p><br/><p>However, the ending was unbelievable.</p><br/><p>Ma Qing Zhou came to the police station and in front of everyone, he slapped himself in rage, saying all sorts of negative things.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow dare you arrest my men? Do you guys have a mental problem?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qing Zhou\u2019s three men stood at one corner as the laughed silently as they watched Godfather Ma continue in his tantrum.</p><br/><p>After that, the three people were released without any charge as they went to other cities.</p><br/><p>\u201cGo down first,\u201d Chen Chang Ping waved his hands, saying.</p><br/><p>He had been at this position for more than ten years, and he didn\u2019t want to quit at all. He knew that it was Ma Qing Zhou that was arranging everything, causing him to be stuck at Qing Zhou as a dummy.</p><br/><p>The police officer nodded his head. I knew that Director Chen wanted to bring these men to justice badly, but his individual power was too limited.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Chen Chang Ping\u2019s handphone rang.</p><br/><p>The call was coming from Shanghai. Whose number could it be? Was it one of his own classmates?</p><br/><p>Click!</p><br/><p>\u201cHello, is this Director Chen? I am Lin Fan. Director Qin from Shanghai\u2019s police station gave me your number. I don\u2019t know what else to say, but I\u2019ll get straight to the chase. In a few moments time, I\u2019ll bring a hugely influential person to the police post. You guys better get ready. Something huge is going to happen tonight,\u201d Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean? I don\u2019t understand,\u201d Chen Chang Ping said.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo problem. You don\u2019t have to understand. When you see him, everything will become clear. All I can say is that it\u2019ll be a great occasion for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Chang Ping was puzzled. Why was this person beating around the bush? What great occasion was there going to be?</p><br/><p>Before he could say anything more, Lin Fan hung up the phone.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Outside the police post.</p><br/><p>A car rolled down the driveway. A few people who were walking past were frightened after seeing the number plate of the car, as they scuttled away.</p><br/><p>Qing q00000. This was the number plate of Ma Qing Zhou, and no one dared to oppose him.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve reached our destination. Are you ready to get off the car?\u201d Lin Fan asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cMm. However, when I come to the police post, they might not take me seriously. I was thinking of calling the reporters here so that when I give myself up, they would know it\u2019s genuine and that bad deeds wouldn\u2019t go unpunished.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan clapped his hands, \u201cThat\u2019s good, that\u2019s good. I\u2019ll call you Godfather Ma. You have become someone with a good sense of self-awareness and to even think of calling the reporters. That is something commendable.\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, Lin Fan thought of how overpowered his knowledge of Wuxia was.</p><br/><p>He never thought that \u2018enchantment\u2019 would be that amazing to cause such a reaction.</p><br/><p>Not only did that ability cause the receiving party to express their kind and good side, it caused them to have heightened self-awareness and it was just too amazing to be used.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Godfather Ma\u2019s men were following behind. When they saw Grandpa Qing\u2019s car pull over at the driveway of the police post, they were all terrified.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo way, he really came to confess his crimes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, definitely not. You guys didn\u2019t see Godfather Ma come down from the car right? Something must have happened. They are probably negotiating how this would go down.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy do I feel as if something bad is about to happen? My heart is beating really fast.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cQuickly, call the rest. If Godfather Ma really confesses his crime, this problem would become huge.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Liu Ren made the phone call in the car.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs this the news agency of Qing Zhou? I am Liu Ren. Could I trouble you guys to come down to the police station? I am here with Godfather Ma to surrender ourselves to the authorities. I hope that you guys can report this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCrazy lunatic.\u201d</p><br/><p>The person on the other end of the line was cursing. Who didn\u2019t know who Godfather Ma was? Him confessing his crimes? What kind of idiot do you think I am.</p><br/><p>Liu Ren called the number again.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs this Qing Zhou law news agency? I am Liu Ren. Godfather Ma and I are here to give ourselves up to the authorities. We have done a lot of bad things in the past and now we have been awakened to the evil that we had committed. I hope that you guys can send some reporters down to capture this moment. I want everyone to know how sorry we are.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs this the People\u2019s News? We are here to give ourselves up\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Ren diligently called every single news agency in the region. However, no one dared to do anything about it.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the two people, shaking his head helplessly.</p><br/><p>No one believed their story.</p><br/><p>Who in their right minds would give themselves up to the authorities with such joy? Anyone who did that was either mentally ill or an idiot.</p><br/><p>Even more so for Godfather Ma.</p><br/><p>No one dared to stand up against Godfather Ma in Qing Zhou.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome, let us get down from the car. It doesn\u2019t matter if the reporters come. You guys should at least see the police officers right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, you have a point. I will confess every single evil thing that I have done even thinking about it now, I can\u2019t even forgive myself for what I have done.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan gave him a thumbs up. \u201cThat is really good self-insight!\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

Where are these words from?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan had already mounted up the calligraphy works and was about to hang them up in the shop to give it a little literary feel. Although he didn\u2019t understand this field very much, putting up a front couldn\u2019t be bad.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow are these words? They\u2019re all written by me. Aren\u2019t they just grand and magnificent, like the world\u2019s best calligraphy?\u201d Lin Fan praised himself delightedly. These were great works by himself and it felt good to place them in the shop.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey\u2019re alright, just slightly worse than mine.\u201d Fraud Tian was a crude man. How could he have known how to appreciate these things?</p><br/><p>Lin Fan glanced over at Fraud Tian and said, \u201cWhat do you know? Take a look at these two paintings. Not bad, right? They\u2019re drawn by two masters of Chinese traditional arts and they\u2019re probably worth several tens of thousands on the market.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho are you trying to fool? I, Tian, have never even seen any famous paintings in my life. You\u2019re saying that this painting is worth several tens of thousands? I wouldn\u2019t want it even if you gave it to me.\u201d Of course, Fraud Tian didn\u2019t believe it. How could this kid know any masters? Even if I tell a ghost, the ghost wouldn\u2019t believe me!</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang said, \u201cThat\u2019s true. It was really drawn by masters.\u201d</p><br/><p>He had witnessed the whole scene for himself. When Brother Lin had won over the two masters with his supreme art skills, Zhao Zhong Yang had been completely astonished. He couldn\u2019t quite figure out how Brother Lin was so brilliant. He was simply too brilliant.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian waved his hand and said, \u201cI don\u2019t trust you all. I don\u2019t even trust a single punctuation mark in what you just said.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan and Zhao Zhong Yang made eye contact for a moment, then burst into laughter. Fraud Tian could doubt them if he wanted to but if he really knew how much this was worth, he would definitely worship the paintings like his ancestry.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan didn\u2019t know what had happened to the calligraphy that he had given to Zhao Ming Qing the previous day either. But meanwhile, Zhao Ming Qing was in his study room, studying the \u2018Various Types of Typhoid Illnesses\u2019. He frequently looked up once in a while at the calligraphy work that was mounted on his wall.</p><br/><p>\u2018\u2019. Old but vigorous.</p><br/><p>Why did it feel a little strange when he looked at it?</p><br/><p>But it was a gift from his teacher. Even if it was even stranger, he would still have to mount it in his study room. If he didn\u2019t do that and it was discovered by his teacher, he wouldn\u2019t be able to face his teacher. If his teacher got angry, he would really be tragic.</p><br/><p><em>Ring ring</em></p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing\u2019s phone rang.</p><br/><p>The voice on the other end of the call was rather polite and respectful. \u201cElder Zhao, you haven\u2019t been to the academy in two days. Did something happen?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing had been completely absorbed in the \u2018Various Types of Typhoid Illnesses\u2019. When he received this call, he suddenly awoke from his daze. It seemed that he had indeed not gone to the academy for two days straight. Including the current day, it had been three days.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing much. I\u2019ll be coming in the afternoon,\u201d said Zhao Ming Qing after thinking for a moment. The Chinese medical knowledge in \u2018Various Types of Typhoid Illnesses\u2019 was plentiful and he needed some time to digest it. He had gradually started to understand some parts, which he hadn\u2019t understood before, after his teacher\u2019s guidance but he still needed a deeper understanding to get a thorough grasp of it.</p><br/><p>After hanging up, Zhao Ming Qing saw that it was still early and continued to immerse himself in the writings.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing\u2019s wife had long gotten used to his current lifestyle of being absorbed in his work. As long as he was happy, it was fine.</p><br/><p>In the afternoon.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan drove his car towards Nanshan Children\u2019s Welfare Institute.</p><br/><p>At that moment, he saw that quite a number of people were gathered at the roadside far up in front. He could roughly make out a person lying down on the ground in the middle of the crowd.</p><br/><p>He thought for a moment, then looked at the weather.</p><br/><p>Since he had already come across this, he should stop to take a look.</p><br/><p>He stopped his car at the side.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan broke through the crowd and saw a middle-aged lady lying on the road. He saw that the lady had been overworked and because of the hot weather on top of that, she had fainted onto the ground.</p><br/><p>The surrounding passers-by were murmuring amongst themselves.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happened to this person?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShould we go take a look?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou go. I\u2019m not going. This is too dangerous. If something happens, we might get dragged into the trouble.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease, move aside\u2026\u201d A girl who looked like a student went forward and kneeled down. \u201cAuntie, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>This female student was quite helpless in this situation but at least she was better than those passers-by who were watching from the side.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t touch her,\u201d Lin Fan went forward and said. Then, under the surprised gaze of the female student, he checked the condition of the middle-aged lady. But when he saw the middle-aged lady\u2019s face, he felt that she looked familiar as if he had seen her somewhere before. However, at that moment, he couldn\u2019t quite figure it out.</p><br/><p>\u201cGive me water,\u201d said Lin Fan. The female student passed him a half-filled mineral water bottle. With Lin Fan\u2019s help, the middle-aged lady regained consciousness.</p><br/><p>When the middle-aged lady came to, she was still in a daze but as soon as she saw Lin Fan, she grabbed tightly onto his hand. \u201cLittle Boss\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Gan was slightly surprised. \u201cYou know me?\u201d Suddenly, after seeing the middle-aged lady\u2019s eyes, he figured it out. \u201cYou\u2019re the mother of that anorexic girl.\u201d</p><br/><p>Madam Wang nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s me, Little Boss. That\u2019s me.\u201d</p><br/><p>It had been some time since that incident had happened. Lin Fan didn\u2019t know if he had seen this person on Cloud Street during this period. There were too many people that queued up for his scallion pancakes and it was only natural for him not to notice such a thing.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan noticed that there were quite a lot of people around, so he said, \u201cIf there\u2019s something to say, say it later. Get up first.\u201d</p><br/><p>When the passersby saw that the lady was fine, they dispersed. The weather was too hot, no one was willing to idle under the Sun. Lin Fan faced the female student and said, \u201cYou\u2019re very kind, young lady. What\u2019s your name?\u201d</p><br/><p>The young lady looked to be eighteen or nineteen. She had a sweet and beautiful appearance. When she saw that the Auntie was fine, she let out a smile and said, \u201cI\u2019m a freshman from Shanghai University, Fang Yue.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded and smiled. \u201cAlright, she\u2019s fine. Thank you very much.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fang Yue replied with a smile, \u201cJust doing what I should.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>In the car.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan switched the air conditioner to the highest setting. He had already remembered about this mother of the anorexic girl. In the past, she would always go to his shop to queue for scallion pancakes but he hadn\u2019t seen her for a period of time. Today, he saw that Madam Wang was slightly more at ease than in the past but she seemed to have aged quite a bit.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow is your daughter? Has her sickness gotten better?\u201d asked Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>This matter had nothing to do with him. Although it is said that a doctor is like a parent to his or her patients, Lin Fan was not a doctor. However, after seeing the girl, Lin Fan couldn\u2019t help it.</p><br/><p>As of then, his medical abilities were superb and he had gained a complete understanding of anorexia. This sickness has two extremities to it. One type is when the patient refuses to eat on his or her own accord, the other is when one feels a certain mental suppression or has taken a psychological blow. The latter involves one taking some mental damage, causing one to detest food and be resistant to consuming food.</p><br/><p>Madam Wang shook her head. \u201cHer sickness is getting more and more severe. She\u2019s already so skinny that she doesn\u2019t even look human.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd how did you faint on the road?\u201d asked Lin Fan. Actually, he didn\u2019t have to ask. He already knew. She was clearly malnourished and her body was fatigued, causing it to be in a weak state. With the hot weather on top of that, it had only been natural for her to feel dizzy. She had hypoglycemia.</p><br/><p>Wang Mu shook her head as if she didn\u2019t want to reply, then she looked at Lin Fan and said, \u201cLittle Boss, could you take pity on me and give me one scallion pancake?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was startled. He hadn\u2019t expected Madam Wang to talk to him with such a tone. She was basically begging him.</p><br/><p>Sigh!</p><br/><p>In the past, he hadn\u2019t had the ability but he did now. This sickness was because of the patient herself but her parents had been dragged into it. It really made him frustrated.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go to the hospital first to take a look at your daughter and see just what stage this sickness has developed to,\u201d said Lin Fan. He had never thought that after going around and doing so many things, that he would be involved with anorexia once again.</p><br/><p>However, this matter had to be taken slowly.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Although it didn\u2019t have a long history, it was considered to be the grandest and luxurious place in Qingzhou.</p><br/><p>Godfather Ma had a passport for the Yun Villa and he naturally brought a lot of guests with him. Regardless of whether the guests were there just for a good time or if they were there to improve their relationship with Godfather Ma, there were a lot of people.</p><br/><p>There were at least a million people there enjoying the service as if they were kings.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan followed behind Liu Ren and looked around. He realized that the people working in the Villa were extraordinary.</p><br/><p>The females could be considered to be people\u2019s goddesses. The males were tall and muscular. They were extremely good-looking as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, they really know how to enjoy themselves.\u201d Lin Fan thought to himself. Whoever that came here probably didn\u2019t bear to leave. Ma Qing Zhou was so powerful and his money was all from illegal means. If he didn\u2019t earn it via illegal means, he wouldn\u2019t have been able to come here to enjoy himself.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre we there yet?\u201d Lin Fan asked with a frustrated tone. They walked for quite some time and they had been winding around places but they hadn\u2019t reached the place yet.</p><br/><p>Liu Ren smiled, \u201cWe will be reaching soon. Godly doctor, don\u2019t be anxious. We have been waiting for your arrival. Godfather Ma used the biggest and most grand room for your reception.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha!\u201d He bragged too much. If not for his disciple being a pro at bragging, he probably would be in the clouds now from all the compliments.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>At Shui Xi Pavilion of Yun Villa.</p><br/><p>It was the grandest pavilion of Yun Villa.</p><br/><p>Countless guests were talking among themselves. If a normal average citizen were to see this sight, they would probably be shocked.</p><br/><p>Everyone there was from Qingzhou and they were extraordinary. They were powerful big shots.</p><br/><p>There was a good-looking man who caught the eye of a lot of wealthy ladies.</p><br/><p>He was one of the most famous actors in the country. Although he wasn\u2019t exactly a good actor, he was handsome. A lot of the wealthy females were attracted to him.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t a ceremony that could be attended by anyone. They had to be approved by Godfather Ma before being granted entry.</p><br/><p>He was the actor that Godfather Ma spent money to train and he proved to be a good money making machine for Godfather Ma.</p><br/><p>Although he was famous enough to expand his business on his own, he was afraid of Godfather Ma\u2019s rage. Hence, he still loyally served him.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre we inviting the godly doctor for tonight\u2019s ceremony?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. Everyone knows Godfather Ma\u2019s situation. Only that godly doctor can heal Godfather Ma.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, didn\u2019t the godly doctor create trouble for Godfather Ma on Weibo? Why did he dare to come to Qingzhou? Did he resolve the conflict with Godfather Ma already?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know but I don\u2019t think so. How could he withstand the might of Godfather Ma? What can a godly doctor do? He has so powerful medical skills and he has to make use of his skills to make money.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat is true.\u201d</p><br/><p>In the room.</p><br/><p>A group of people was sitting there.</p><br/><p>The people there were big shots that controlled most of the finances in Qingzhou.</p><br/><p>\u201cCongratulations, Godfather Ma for inviting the godly doctor here. Looks like your illness will be resolved,\u201d said the leader of Qingzhou\u2019s Green Industrial Park.\u201d</p><br/><p>He was of the same status as Godfather Ma. However, he was not as ruthless as him. However, if not for Godfather Ma\u2019s strong backing, his family would definitely be able to kick him out of Qingzhou with their power.\u201d</p><br/><p>During Godfather Ma\u2019s illness, they had already planned to take over the territories. If Godfather Ma were to pass away, the territories would have to be newly allocated and it would have to depend on their capabilities.</p><br/><p>However, the situation had changed since Godfather Ma managed to get the godly doctor over.</p><br/><p>Ma Qing Zhou looked at everyone and smiled. \u201cEveryone, I heard that you guys want to sever all ties with me after knowing that I\u2019m sick. I wonder if it is true.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Shan He answered, \u201cHow could that be? We have been working with Godfather Ma for so many years. How could we sever ties with you? I wonder which family spread that rumor. If I were to find out, I would definitely make them pay a price.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. That\u2019s impossible.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGodfather Ma, don\u2019t worry. Our relationship isn\u2019t so easily broken. I just wonder when the godly doctor will arrive. He must be really powerful for all of us to be waiting for him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ma Qing Zhou smiled, \u201cThat\u2019s good. The godly doctor is at Yun Villa already. He is on the way here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, I heard that the godly doctor\u2019s medical skills are incredible. I really want to see how powerful he is.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ma Qing Zhou said, \u201cThat would depend on whether he is an honest man. I, Ma Qing Zhou, am a benevolent man. I didn\u2019t do anything to him for scolding me on Weibo. I just want to see if he knows his status today.\u201d</p><br/><p>The crowd started to talk among themselves after hearing what he said.</p><br/><p>Godfather Ma was clear with his words. He was still in conflict with the godly doctor. However, since the godly doctor was in Yun Villa, his life was in the hands of Ma Qing Zhou.</p><br/><p>His survival depended on whether he knew how to be polite and courteous.</p><br/><p>They had been working with Godfather Ma for so long and they knew what Ma Qing Zhou was like as a person.</p><br/><p>Regardless of how many favors he owed you, if you don\u2019t know how to behave yourself in front of him, you will suffer a tragic fate.</p><br/><p>The least he would do is to beat someone up and throw the person out of Qingzhou. The worst he could do was to keep the person in Qingzhou and make life a living hell.</p><br/><p>Then, the atmosphere was a little tense. Everyone looked at each other in confusion. This ceremony was set up with the aim of murdering a guest.</p><br/><p>They had to see what was the decision made during the ceremony.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe is here. The godly doctor is here. Go and welcome him. After all, he is the godly doctor,\u201d Ma Qing Zhou said with exaggeration as if the godly doctor was extraordinary.</p><br/><p>However, he knew that Ma Qing Zhou was just taunting him.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Outside.</p><br/><p>As Liu Ren was bringing him in, everyone made way for them.</p><br/><p>The crowd looked at the people that were walking in.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, who is that young chap beside Brother Liu?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. He must be incredible to be led by Brother Liu personally.\u201d</p><br/><p>Those that were there were familiar with Liu Ren. He was the most well-known right-hand man of Godfather Ma.</p><br/><p>Besides Godfather Ma, Liu Ren was the second most powerful individual there. Sometimes, Godfather Ma would even listen to Liu Ren\u2019s words and think about his decisions.</p><br/><p>They believed that it was considered to be scary.</p><br/><p>Liu Ren stopped there and turned around, \u201cGodly doctor, please.\u201d Then, he pushed the door open.</p><br/><p>There was a beam of light that emitted from the door and it was getting brighter.</p><br/><p>To others, it was a dazzling sight.</p><br/><p>However, to Lin Fan, he felt a sense of evil from this light.</p><br/><p>It was as if he was entering a world of evil.</p><br/><p>He had to be steady about it.</p><br/><p>When he entered the door, a lot of people that were in the room looked at him.</p><br/><p>The crowd stood up as they looked at the door.</p><br/><p>I am coming, evil.</p><br/><p>I am Justice Fan and I am here to meet all of you.</p></div>\n</div>"}

Chinese medicine had managed to find the cure for anorexia. To the relevant departments, this was very shocking. Under the Chinese Medicine Management Agency\u2019s guidance, the documents were issued immediately to support Zhao Ming Qing\u2019s medical research.</p><br/><p>Of course, this was still the internal department\u2019s order. It had not been communicated to Zhao Ming Qing yet.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing was the face of this matter and Lin Fan was the boss behind it. Besides Zhao Ming Qing, no one else knew who had formulated this cure.</p><br/><p>Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan sighed. This was the first accomplishment in Chinese medicine. Of course, things were not as easy as what he had thought. By formulating the cure for anorexia, the world might change their opinions of Chinese Medicine slightly and think that it was powerful. However, it seemed like there was not much change. The basic Chinese Medicine techniques were still unable to compete with Western Medicine.</p><br/><p>Western Medicine had a conventional medical standard. Chinese Medicine had it too. It was just that it required an old qualified Chinese Medicine doctor to teach it personally. Chinese Medicine could not be as widespread as Western Medicine because of this. It lost out when compared to Western Medicine.</p><br/><p>However, Chinese Medicine was a quintessence of national culture. The nation would not allow Chinese Medicine to perish. Even if it could not rise, it had to remain.</p><br/><p><em>Ring ring</em></p><br/><p>At this moment, Zhao Ming Qing called. Lin Fan looked at his phone and knew that something had happened. The person who had talked to him previously must have been Zhao Ming Qing\u2019s friend.</p><br/><p>With regards to whether Zhao Ming Qing allowed others to see the book, he did not actually mind. He wanted to experiment with the outcome. He wanted to know if he would gain Encyclopedic Points if someone understood his book. However, he could not just allow others to read the book so easily. People would want it even more if it was harder to get.</p><br/><p>If it was too easy, there would be no point.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello, Ming Qing, what happened?\u201d Lin Fan took the call calmly.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing respectfully said, \u201cTeacher, the person who called you just now was my good friend, Zhou Qing Quan, the director of the Chinese Medical Association. He wants to meet you, are you free any time?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled and regretfully said, \u201cI am busy lately. Let him wait a few more days. Ask if he is willing to wait. If not, then forget it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Before Zhao Ming Qing managed to ask, Zhou Qing Quan who was eavesdropping immediately replied, \u201cYes, I\u2019m willing, I am willing to wait no matter how long. During this time, I will talk to Brother Zhao and stay with him for now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGo and stay at the hotel by yourself.\u201d Zhao Ming Qing did not want to stay with Zhou Qing Quan. It wouldn\u2019t bring anything good. However, Zhou Qing Quan could not spare this opportunity, he wanted to stay here no matter what.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. \u201cMing Qing, if the reporters pester you with regards to the cure, you can take over and decide. I won\u2019t get involved.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing was shocked. \u201cTeacher, the cure was made by your instructions, how can you not get involved?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDecide for yourself, I am hanging up.\u201d Lin Fan smiled and said. His goal was not to have control over this cure. He had a greater goal. He wanted to finish his task and earn more Encyclopedic Points.</p><br/><p>Recently, because of this Chinese Medicine matter, he had not been able to go to the Children\u2019s Welfare Institute. He had to go for a visit soon to teach the children how to draw and cultivate more talents while earning more Encyclopedic Points.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing was so touched that he almost cried. He had not imagined that his teacher would entrust such an important matter to himself, allowing him to have full control over it. He felt so motivated that he had to do a good job and not let his teacher be disappointed.</p><br/><p>After hanging up.</p><br/><p>Zhou Qing Quan looked at Zhao Ming Qing. \u201cElder Zhao, tell me the truth. Is your teacher very young?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing nodded. \u201cYes, very young. He\u2019s twenty-something.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis\u2026\u201d Not only Zhou Qing Quan was shocked, the rest were shocked too. Twenty-something years old? Zhao Ming Qing\u2019s teacher was only twenty-something years old. That was really frightening.</p><br/><p>Elder Mu said, \u201cDo not look down on Master Lin. Even though he is very young, he has great knowledge of Chinese Medicine. You all know that Elder Zhao had a lung disease but look at him now. Does he look like a person who has lung disease?\u201d</p><br/><p>When this was brought up, Zhou Qing Quan suddenly remembered. Oh yes, Elder Zhao had had a lung disease last time. Frequently, he would cough and he couldn\u2019t stand the smell of smoke. However, now, if it hadn\u2019t been for Elder Mu\u2019s reminder, they would not have noticed that Elder Zhao had not coughed at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Zhao, your body\u2026?\u201d Zhou Qing Quan asked curiously.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing smiled and calmly said, \u201cThanks to my teacher who helped me personally, my long-time disease was cured. I have no problems now. Elder Zhou, based on our decades of friendship, I am willing to share this with you. Otherwise, I wouldn\u2019t tell you all this.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Vice-Chairman of the Chinese Medicine Association, Wang Tian Feng said in surprise, \u201cElder Zhao, you are not neglecting us, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy would I neglect you all? At the ceremony when I became my teacher\u2019s disciple, I invited all of you but you all did not turn up to see my teacher. Who else can you blame?\u201d Speaking of this matter, he was still unhappy.</p><br/><p>\u201cSigh.\u201d Zhou Qing Quan slapped his thigh. \u201cWhy did we listen to those kids of yours? They thought that you were being lied to. We did not come because we were afraid that you would be embarrassed when you found out that you were cheated if we came. We did not think that it would become like that. I will go and question those brats right now for making me lose such an opportunity.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing waved his hand. \u201cEnough. That\u2019s the past. Let\u2019s not talk about this anymore. I have already told you before that my teacher is young and might come across as suspicious. I used to suspect him before but I am not one bit suspicious of him anymore. My teacher is a genuine talent, and his knowledge is frightening. You guys are from the same generation as me. Be courteous when you see him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Qing Quan was shocked. \u201cElder Zhao, this is not right. We are the same generation as you but your teacher is way too young. We are halfway into the coffin and to a young man, this\u2026this\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing raised his eyebrow and pretended to be angry. \u201cIf you are like that, then forget about meeting him. This will save us the trouble.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, no, I\u2019m just saying. Elder Zhao, you are starting to become proud now that you\u2019re so awesome. You should think about last time, how I painstakingly collected a copy of the ancient book and you just borrowed it away like that. You did not even return it to me but did I say anything about it?\u201d Zhou Qing Quan said.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha\u2026\u201d Zhao Ming Qing laughed. \u201cDon\u2019t mention about the past. I just wish that I can learn Chinese Medicine from my teacher now. Chinese Medicine cannot rise from our hands anymore. However, I am not giving up. I will use my remaining life to contribute something great to Chinese Medicine. My teacher said to meet a few days later. Now, help me think about what I should do with this cure. I think the National Chinese Medicine Management Agency will contact me. If this was my own cure, I wouldn\u2019t mind, but this is my teacher\u2019s hard work, so I will try to fight for some benefits.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Qing Quan nodded. \u201cYour teacher just said that you can have full authority over it. This means that he does not mind giving up full control over his cure or letting it benefit the society. This is a true hero of Chinese Medicine. Even though we have not met, I am already in admiration. If it was a businessman, he could have wanted a sum of money. After all, the most profitable thing in the world is medicine.\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, Lin Fan received a call.</p><br/><p>The Chinese art expert Yue Qiu Ju Shi called and invited Lin Fan to his exhibition. The exhibition was on the day after the next.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

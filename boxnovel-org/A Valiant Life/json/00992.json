If it was me, I would have charged forward and started fighting with these two people long ago.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian chuckled. \u201cDon\u2019t blame me for underestimating me but judging by your physique, you would probably be beaten to a pulp.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang had wanted to argue back by saying \u2018Why don\u2019t you go if you\u2019re so awesome?\u2019, but then he suddenly remembered that this Fraud seemed to know kungfu and he was rather good at it too. Hence, he didn\u2019t say another word.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian was very pleased. He had spent his whole life honing his Ba Gua Zhang skills but now, it seemed that it hadn\u2019t been a waste. He had managed to use his Ba Gua Zhang to show off and make this kid speechless.</p><br/><p>Then, he looked to the front. Those two guys really deserved a beating. When that crippled guy had acted impudently, Fraud Tian had wanted to go forward and slap him to the ground but he hadn\u2019t expected that kid to immediately make a move on him. This style of doing things was reminiscent of Fraud Tian\u2019s younger days.</p><br/><p>Zhou Shi Ming\u2019s driver saw the scene and was astonished. He wanted to come and help but then decided against it. This was Master Lin, who even had the title of Vice-Chairman of the Martial Arts Association. He couldn\u2019t match up to him.</p><br/><p>At the same time, this was the first time he had seen his boss get treated like this. His heart couldn\u2019t quite take it.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Boss, what\u2019s going on?\u201d The shop owners gathered around, wondering what had happened.</p><br/><p>But before Lin Fan could explain the situation, Zhou Jun couldn\u2019t take it anymore. He felt that he had been humiliated. He immediately burst out cursing.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck your mom! You f*cking\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>*Smack!*</p><br/><p>Before he could finish, he was slapped stupid by one of the shop owners.</p><br/><p>\u201cShut your foul mouth. If you you dare to scold Little Boss again, I\u2019ll beat your mouth until it\u2019s swollen shut.\u201d This shop owner had a muscular physique. He sold gym equipment in his shop. He had a flat top hairstyle and his muscles were bulging. He obviously trained very often. He usually didn\u2019t like to speak much but today, he had spontaneously made a move.</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, this kind of person should be beaten. He even dared to scold Little Boss. Does he really think he can take advantage of our Cloud Street so easily?\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Liang said, \u201cLil\u2019 Hui, that was a good hit. Tonight, let Elder Liang treat you to a drink.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cBrother Hui, don\u2019t stoop down to his level.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Boss, this kind of person deserves to be beaten. He thinks he\u2019s better than everyone else just because he has some money. He doesn\u2019t even look at where he is.\u201d Lil\u2019 Hui was a thirty-something-year-old man. When he became furious like this, he was a little scary.</p><br/><p>Zhou Jun looked at the group of Cloud Street shop owners and gritted his teeth. \u201cYou\u2026you guys\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about us? Try pointing your finger at us again and let\u2019s see if we\u2019ll break it. Do you not know what pain is?\u201d Brother Hui barked as he raised his hand to prepare for another slap.</p><br/><p>When Zhou Jun saw this, he was so frightened that he backed off immediately and didn\u2019t dare to say anything.</p><br/><p>Zhou Shi Ming was losing his mind in a rage. He hadn\u2019t expected things to turn out like this. Had all these Cloud Street people gone crazy along with this Lin?</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, alright. You guys are good.\u201d Zhou Shi Ming crawled up. He nodded at Lin Fan as if to say he\u2019ll remember this.</p><br/><p>This matter really wasn\u2019t over yet.</p><br/><p>In so many years of his life, he had never been humiliated like that before. But he admitted his defeat here. Then, he looked at the motionless driver and yelled, \u201cWhat are you waiting for? Drive the car over now!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, yes.\u201d The driver hurriedly drove the car over. He didn\u2019t dare to be unbridled anymore. He knew that his boss was really pi*sed this time.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the two of them and didn\u2019t say much. He just waved his hand. \u201cEveryone, go back. It\u2019s fine now.\u201d</p><br/><p>The shop owners were all chattering at the same time.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Boss, if they still dare to come again, you can call us. We\u2019ll definitely teach them a good lesson.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. They\u2019re really too impudent, to dare to bully our Little Boss. They must not want to live.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo they think that we, the people of Clouse Street, are so easily bullied?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat slap by Lil\u2019 Hui today was pretty good. I think that it was great.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Jun glared at these commoners with his heart filled with fury.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Elder Dog walked over cheerily from afar. When he neared Cloud Street, he took a sniff and seemed to have smelled something suspicious.</p><br/><p>Then, Elder Dog\u2019s eyes fixated on Zhou Jun\u2019s crippled leg. He gritted his teeth and growled in a deep voice before charging forward furiously.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan and the rest were already getting ready to go back.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, an ear-piercing scream sounded out.</p><br/><p>They saw Elder Dog biting Zhou Jun\u2019s leg and not letting go. There even seemed to be blood.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha.\u201d</p><br/><p>When the surrounding shop owners saw this scene, they burst into laughter.</p><br/><p>\u201cEven Elder Dog doesn\u2019t feel comfortable looking at him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood bite, Elder Dog!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph. You were looking for trouble when you tried to bully Little Boss. Now, Little Boss\u2019s protector is here. You\u2019re in trouble.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was slightly surprised. Elder Dog understood human nature and he wouldn\u2019t attack anyone for no reason. Now that he had bitten Zhou Jun, it seemed that he had sensed something.</p><br/><p>The shop owners who had been laughing initially saw that Elder Dog was becoming more fearsome as he bit onto Zhou Jun and they started to get worried.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Boss, will Elder Dog cause a problem by biting him like this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, Elder Dog is so ferocious. I have never seen him like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s stubbornly biting on and not letting go. This\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Jun was still screaming miserably. As Zhou Shi Ming saw this, he started trying to kick Elder Dog. Meanwhile, the driver rushed forward to try to chase Elder Dog away as well.</p><br/><p>But Elder Dog was not a typical dog. If Elder Dog wanted to deal the killing blow, it would happen in the blink of an eye and these people would all go to hell.</p><br/><p>\u201cDoggy, that\u2019s enough,\u201d Lin Fan said after taking a look. He had bitten Zhou Jun long enough. If Elder Dog bit him any longer, that guy\u2019s leg might become useless.</p><br/><p>Elder Dog heard Lin Fan\u2019s words and let go obediently. Then, he dashed to Lin Fan\u2019s side and barked a few times at Zhou Jun.</p><br/><p>\u201cSon, are you okay?\u201d Zhou Shi Ming asked anxiously.</p><br/><p>\u201cDad, I was bitten by that dog. I was bitten. I have to get a rabies vaccination.\u201d That wound on his leg was hurting so much that Zhou Jun was trembling. He was dying from the pain.</p><br/><p>Zhou Shi Ming glared at Lin Fan. \u201cLin, you ordered your dog to bite someone. I\u2019ll sue you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at Zhou Shi Ming and raised his hand. \u201cAlright, go and sue me. I\u2019ll wait.\u201d</p><br/><p>When he only received such a response, Zhou Shi Ming\u2019s body started trembling in anger. He wasn\u2019t frightened at all but his rage was causing his whole body to tremble. \u201cAlright, just you wait.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, he quickly told the driver to help Zhou Jun onto the car and they left for the hospital immediately.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at Elder Dog. \u201cThat was a pretty good bite. He deserved to be bitten.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWoof woof!\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Dog was now a righteous dog. He had already done countless good deeds outside.</p><br/><p>When he came across a wallet, he would return it to the police station immediately. Such deeds left everyone in shock and in disbelief that they were done by a dog.</p></div>\n</div>"}

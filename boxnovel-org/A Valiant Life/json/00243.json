He thought that all he had done was destroy a shop. It was no big deal. He just wanted to see that fella become furious and frustrated. But Lin Fan looked carefree and wasn't anxious at all.</p><br/><p>This wasn't what he had expected to see. He wanted to see this fella complain about him at the police station. Then, he wanted to use his own power to resolve this matter perfectly and upset Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>When Qiao Fei saw Lin Fan, he realized that this man was still laughing at him.</p><br/><p>He should be laughing at his sister instead!</p><br/><p>After a short while.</p><br/><p>\"According to our investigation, you destroyed his shop and caused it to suffer losses. After further investigation, the losses amount to more than five thousand dollars,\" the policeman said.</p><br/><p>Qiao Fei waved his hand. \"Let's not talk about that. I did it on purpose. Now, I offer to pay for the renovation costs in full.\"</p><br/><p>The policeman looked at Lin Fan. \"Are you willing to settle this privately with him?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan placed the cup of tea on the table. \"I am not willing to do so. I wish to settle this by law.\"</p><br/><p>The policeman nodded and recorded his statement.</p><br/><p>Qiao Fei laughed, \"Bro, it doesn't matter whether you wish to settle this with me privately or not. I mean what I said. I won't be affected at all. I will pay for your renovation costs and give you additional reimbursement. You better take my offer.\"</p><br/><p>\"Police officer, please give me a pen and a piece of paper. I have to calculate the amount,\" Lin Fan said. The losses had to be be calculated accurately.</p><br/><p>\"Haha, count slowly. There's no hurry. In the end, just tell me how much it costs,\" Qiao Fei said casually. He wasn't bothered at all and wanted to see the amount that Lin Fan was going to claim from him.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan took the piece of paper and wrote down a list of items including tables, stools, teapots, teacups, artworks, etc\u2026</p><br/><p>Qiao Fei was stunned when he saw how serious this fella was. Then, he glared at him, \"Wow, tables? I can buy you a good one. Is $2000 enough? If it isn't enough, I can pay more for it. I can buy you ten stools if your shop can contain them. As for the teapot, I can buy a few of them for you. You can slowly make your tea. Is that enough? Tell me, how much is it? There should be enough cash in my bag for me to pay for everything now.\"</p><br/><p>The processing officer furrowed his brows. He had seen many cocky and unreasonable people before but this was the first time he had seen a man that was so cocky.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan raised his head and smiled. \"Be patient, I'll be done soon.\"</p><br/><p>\"Alright, how much is the evaluating department suggesting?\" Lin Fan asked.</p><br/><p>The police officer replied, \"About $7000.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded. \"Hmm, that's okay. They should classify this as a case of damage to public property.\"</p><br/><p>The police officer nodded. \"According to the evidence provided by the witnesses, the fact that he destroyed your shop on purpose can fully justify it to be classified as a case of damage to public property.\"</p><br/><p>Qiao Fei laughed, \"Bro, stop pretending. It's just $7000. I can give you $10,000, is that enough?\"</p><br/><p>\"This is a local police station, please watch your tone and language,\" the police officer warned Qiao Fei.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at Qiao Fei. \"That was just for damage to my property. The larger losses are coming up. I am calculating them now and I'll give you the total cost in a while.\"</p><br/><p>\"You destroyed my shop and the renovation works would take about ten days. Let me calculate my losses for these ten days. I'll take it as a loss of $30,000 per day. In ten days, that would be $300,000. Plus the $7000 due to property damage, it would be around $307,000. Forget it, I'll just accept $300,000 from you,\" Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>Qiao Fei had been waiting for this fella to calculate the losses but when he heard him, he was infuriated. \"I think you should just go and rob a bank instead. $300,000? If I were to give you that amount, I'd be a fool.\"</p><br/><p>Then, he added, \"I've seen many cases of this. When someone gets shameless, it can be indeed very scary. Let's not even talk about $300,000. I wouldn't even give you $200,000.\"</p><br/><p>The processing officer took the piece of paper from Lin Fan and looked at it. He knew about the business that was booming at Master Lin's shop. Furthermore, there were no problems with the list. \"I will let the evaluating department have a look at this list.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded. \"Sure, don't worry. Take it slow. I won't interfere in this. I'll be happy with the result that they propose.\"</p><br/><p>The police officer thought for a moment, then said, \"This is already classified as a case with severely high costs. It is sufficient for a lawsuit to be filed. Although there weren't any injuries, damaging public property can gravely affect people's reputation. According to the law, he should be punished accordingly. At the same time, he has to pay for the economic losses and will be detained for four to six months.\"</p><br/><p>\"That's better.\" Lin Fan nodded with satisfaction.</p><br/><p>Qiao Fei chuckled when he heard him, \"Are you kidding me? And you, too. Please don't take me for a fool. I can tell that you're in cahoots with him, right? The losses amount to $300,000? Why not $3,000,000?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled, \"You want to try $3,000,000? I can make it come true. Come destroy my shop again in the future and I can assure you that you'd be paying $3,000,000.\"</p><br/><p>*Ding ding!*</p><br/><p>Then, Qiao Fei's phone rang.</p><br/><p>Qiao Fei laughed when he saw the incoming call. Then, he picked it up. \"Hi Chief Lu, yes, I'm already in Shanghai. However, I can't leave now. I am currently at the local police station. I have to stay here until tomorrow. I'm afraid we have to wait for awhile for the contract to be signed. Huh? You want to come here? Sure, I'll wait here for you.\"</p><br/><p>After hanging up the phone, Qiao Fei looked at Lin Fan as if he was trying to brag about his status. However, it didn't mean anything to Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled. It was pointless for him to call anyone. Lin Fan hadn't hurt or sabotaged anyone in this incident. Even if a God were to come, he wouldn't be afraid at all.</p><br/><p>After a while.</p><br/><p>A middle-aged man came.</p><br/><p>This matter wasn't considered big but it wasn't small either. It all depended on how the people decided to resolve it. Hence, there were no problems for someone to visit him.</p><br/><p>Qiao Fei immediately stood up when he saw the man. He smiled. \"Chief Lu, I didn't expect you to have to visit me at the local police station here in Shanghai.\"</p><br/><p>Chief Lu looked impressive. He was well-dressed and he looked classy. He looked like a successful man. Then, he smiled. \"Chief Qiao, what happened to you? Why did you end up at a local police station on your first day in Shanghai?\"</p><br/><p>Qiao Fei shook his head. \"I had a conflict with this fella here. Something happened and it infuriated me so much that I destroyed his shop. You know my temper, I can't stand being taken advantage of.\"</p><br/><p>Chief Lu chuckled when he heard what Qiao Fei said, \"Chief Qiao is young and reckless. You always do whatever you want. However, I thought this would've been settled easily if you'd just pay the losses? Why are you still here? Are you thinking of not paying him?\"</p><br/><p>Qiao Fei laughed and looked at Lin Fan unhappily. \"How could that be? I only have to pay $20,000 to $30,000. How could I not be able to afford it? But this fella is hilarious. He wants me to pay $300,000. Furthermore, he wants to sue me and detain me for months.\"</p><br/><p>Then, Lu Li Jiang looked at Lin Fan. Although $200,000 or $300,000 wasn't much, it wasn't right to ask for so much money. Money was hard-earned after all.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

I saw the news and it looked terrible.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cHe is okay now. He is alive but he needs to undergo treatment in the hospital. He needs at least three months to recover.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan said, \u201cIt\u2019s good to not be in danger anymore. Why are the students like that? How could they do such a thing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Lin Fan was stunned. \u201cHow did you guys know about this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan said, \u201cThe video surfaced online. It was frightening. I don\u2019t even dare to watch it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang said angrily, \u201cIf I saw them, I would\u2019ve slapped all of them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, the other shop owners came. They all asked how was Elder Chen\u2019s son. Although Sister Hong and the others told them that Lil\u2019 Liang was fine, they were still worried about him. Although he wasn\u2019t their child, they had a really good relationship with each other and they were worried about him.</p><br/><p>However, when they heard Little Boss say that he was fine, they heaved a sigh of relief. It was good that he was fine. If something had happened to him, what would Elder Chen do about it?</p><br/><p>To them, it was awesome to have Little Boss. They knew that Lil\u2019 Liang managed to survive because of Little Boss. If not for Little Boss, the situation would\u2019ve been way worse.</p><br/><p>The Internet didn\u2019t seem very peaceful.</p><br/><p>There were a lot of versions of the incident.</p><br/><p>Some said that he had already died.</p><br/><p>Some said that he became paralyzed.</p><br/><p>There were a lot of other versions on the Internet.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan felt that there was a need to clarify things.</p><br/><p>On Weibo: \u2018The victim of the Shanghai Jin Yang Secondary School\u2019s suicide case has been saved. He is currently recovering. Everyone, please refrain from spreading rumors.\u201d</p><br/><p>The netizens were curious.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, Master Lin actually came forward to talk about it. But how did you know about this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to ask the same thing too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe netizens are all concerned about this matter. We have to stop school violence.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe is fine after jumping down from the sixth level? Are you lying?\u201d</p><br/><p>He was helpless after seeing the comments of the doubtful netizens. Didn\u2019t they know who he was and what he was good at?</p><br/><p>However, some netizens spoke the truth a while later.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you guys stupid? Master Lin is a godly doctor. Are you guys asking for fun?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin\u2019s medical skills are second to none. He can even save someone who\u2019s on the brink of death. How could he not save the victim?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI am the doctor of the hospital. Master Lin personally operated on the victim.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cImpressive.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Lin Fan wasn\u2019t ecstatic from reading the compliments at all. After all, it wasn\u2019t something that deserved to be happy about.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Boss, how are we going to resolve this matter? Are those people free to go?\u201d Zhao Zhong Yang asked.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shook his head, \u201cI don\u2019t know but the police station said that they\u2019re all not 14 years old yet and they can\u2019t be held responsible. I believe you guys should know about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang was furious, \u201cThat\u2019s just bullsh*t.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cIt\u2019s just like that, you can\u2019t do anything about that.\u201d</p><br/><p>The others shook their heads. What else could they have done about this?</p><br/><p>The rules were rules after all and they couldn\u2019t have done anything about it. They could only pray that this wouldn\u2019t happen in the future again.</p><br/><p>At night!</p><br/><p>At a random bar on a street.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan stood there and looked around. Then, he placed Elder Dog Nicholas down. He stretched his hand forward in front of him. \u201cSmell it, besides my smell, could you smell anyone else?\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Dog barked, \u201cI smell it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan patted Elder Dog, \u201cGo and look for it. See where this man is at. If you managed to find him, you\u2019ll get five scallion pancakes.\u201d</p><br/><p>After hearing that his reward was five scallion pancakes, Elder Dog jumped about ecstatically. Ever since those incorrigible fans sent dog food over, he had never eaten scallion pancakes anymore. Now that he was entitled to five, he was over the moon.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was elated when he saw Elder Dog start running. He realized that Elder Dog had become smarter. It looked as if the defective Little Intelligence pill was useful.</p><br/><p>With Elder Dog\u2019s ability, it was definitely not a problem for him to find a man based on his smell.</p><br/><p>Li Hu didn\u2019t look like a decent man at all. It wasn\u2019t that Lin Fan wanted to mess with him. It was just that he had to mess with him. Chen Liang was Elder Chen\u2019s son. He had suffered so much and how could they live comfortably just because his son wasn\u2019t fourteen years old yet?</p><br/><p>Those that bullied him wouldn\u2019t be able to escape so easily.</p><br/><p>Especially since this fella\u2019s dad wasn\u2019t a decent man at all. If he didn\u2019t mess with him, who else would he mess with?</p><br/><p>If he was a decent man, he wouldn\u2019t have done anything to him. Even though this matter was unfavorable, he couldn\u2019t have done anything to the laws in place.</p><br/><p>After a while.</p><br/><p>Elder Dog Nicholas returned. It looked like he had found out about something.</p><br/><p>*bark*</p><br/><p>\u201cFollow me,\u201d Elder Dog said.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan followed Elder Dog and they went to a few districts before stopping in front of a bar.</p><br/><p>\u201cLooks like it\u2019s here,\u201d Lin Fan said to himself. Then, he kept Elder Dog Nicholas in his clothes and walked into the place.</p><br/><p>It was dimly lit and he couldn\u2019t really see. He brought Elder Dog to the toilet and left after he confirmed that there wasn\u2019t anybody there.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Dog, I\u2019ll leave the rest to you. Find the man and follow behind him. Don\u2019t be found out by anyone. If it\u2019s possible, hear what they say and report it back to me. Remember, don\u2019t get caught,\u201d Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>He read the fortune of his facial appearance and realized that he was going to do something illegal in the near future. Hence, he didn\u2019t want to miss that opportunity.</p><br/><p>According to his fortune-reading skills, Li Hu was only going to face the law in a year\u2019s time.</p><br/><p>However, he didn\u2019t want to wait for a year. He wanted to change his life now and bring the time forward.</p><br/><p>Elder Dog looked at Lin Fan, \u201cBro, why can\u2019t we be caught?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan felt that Elder Dog seemed a little dumb. \u201cWe just can\u2019t get caught.\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Dog said, \u201cWhy must I listen to you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was speechless. What was Elder Dog doing? Why wasn\u2019t he being obedient?</p><br/><p>Suddenly, he understood what was happening.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Dog, ten scallion pancakes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Dog was initially pretending to be dumb but his eyes lit up and he ran towards the exit of the toilet.</p><br/><p>In the dimly lit area, the small body of a dog wouldn\u2019t attract any attention.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan stood outside and saw a white silhouette. He went to the second level from the first level. Furthermore, he also saw him hiding from strangers. When the strangers left, he continued to look for his target.</p><br/><p>Then, Lin Fan sighed. Elder Dog was probably capable of being a spy.</p><br/><p>His body was small and he was intelligent. Even if he was caught by someone, they wouldn\u2019t have thought much about it.</p><br/><p>Then, he came to a table and sat there alone. He was waiting for Elder Dog\u2019s good news.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat should I do?\u201d Elder Dog hid behind a flower pot and looked into a closed private room. He couldn\u2019t enter it at all.</p><br/><p>He knew that the target was inside.</p><br/><p>If he didn\u2019t complete the mission, he wouldn\u2019t be able to get ten scallion pancakes.</p><br/><p>Just when Elder Dog was thinking of what to do, a service crew member walked over. He was carrying a handful of beer and he pushed the door of the private room open.</p><br/><p>Elder Dog quickly ran in.</p></div>\n</div>"}

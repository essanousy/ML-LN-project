Naturally, he knew about the situation on the Internet. However, it was really hard to convince the public that he had tasted the problem. Hence, he was pondering about whether he should look for the relevant department to do a test.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian had a dumbfounded look on his face. \u201cKid, how can you still sit still? Aren\u2019t you going to find a way to resolve this? Your post has only come out for two days and it has already caused such a huge impact. If you don\u2019t resolve this properly, you\u2019ll be in deep trouble.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled as he said, \u201cI\u2019m thinking of a way right now. But this can\u2019t be rushed. I have to take it slow. I\u2019m going to bring the milk for testing. When the test results are out, the problem will be resolved.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen why don\u2019t you hurry up l? I feel that the situation on the Internet is getting out of hand.\u201d Fraud Tian looked at the situation on the Internet and was very anxious. He felt that this kid was playing around with a super huge problem.</p><br/><p>Moreover, if the kid didn\u2019t resolve it well, it was very likely that he would get implicated as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the hurry? I\u2019ll go soon.\u201d Lin Fan wasn\u2019t in a hurry at all. Although the situation on the Internet wasn\u2019t too friendly to him, he wasn\u2019t afraid at all. It wasn\u2019t like other people could distort the truth regarding this.</p><br/><p>At that moment, the phone rang. It was an unknown number.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello, who is this?\u201d Lin Fan answered. However, he felt that it was probably Tianshu Milk.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello, I am calling from Tianshu Milk\u2019s law department. Right now, our company is going to officially sue you for disseminating false information on the Internet and causing a negative impact on Tianshu Milk Company. We wish that you may delete all your comments on Weibo before the situation further develops to a worse state. Also, we hope that you may send a serious apology on Weibo and bring your personal particulars to give yourself up to the authorities,\u201d the man on the other end of the call spoke calmly.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was taken aback when he heard that. \u201cWait. You\u2019re from Tianshu Milk\u2019s law department?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. As a public figure on the Internet, you\u2019ve caused a serious impact on our company through your false accusation,\u201d said the man.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan: \u201cI think you\u2019re mistaken. Don\u2019t you have an idea of whether there\u2019s a problem on your side? I\u2019d advise you to quickly recall all your distributed products and organize a press meeting to apologize so that you can minimize the impact. If you still carry on stubbornly, it will tremendously affect you. When that happens, it would be too late to regret. This isn\u2019t a small matter after all.\u201d</p><br/><p>The man on the other end of the call was silent. It was as if he hadn\u2019t expected Master Lin to say such a thing. After a while, he spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you really not going to repent? This is a serious false accusation. It has been spread to an extensive range of people.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan stopped him. \u201cI think you should investigate the entire situation properly. I\u2019m just someone who drinks milk and I managed to discover the issue when drinking your milk.\u201d</p><br/><p>*Clatter!*</p><br/><p>The opposite party hung up.</p><br/><p>Tianshu Milk Law Department.</p><br/><p>After the man hung up, his colleagues gathered around him. \u201cHow was it? What did Master Lin say? Is he so frightened that he\u2019s going to immediately delete his comments? But it\u2019ll be useless even if he deletes them. This matter has already caused a severe impact.</p><br/><p>The man shook his head. \u201cNo, he doesn\u2019t know how to repent. He thinks it\u2019s a problem with our company. Alright, since it\u2019s like this, we should get to work and sue him. We\u2019ll sue him for making a false accusation and make him pay the compensation.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is the Internet age. Anyone can be an author on the Internet. But the stories they tell can\u2019t be blindly written. He has caused a huge problem and he has to be severely dealt with.\u201d</p><br/><p>Some of these people knew about Master Lin. Some of them had good impressions of Master Lin. But after this incident, they wondered if there was something abnormal with Master Lin\u2019s brain.</p><br/><p>He had actually dared to post something so baseless. Did he not know how severe it was?</p><br/><p>Tianshu Milk\u2019s official account immediately made a statement on their seriousness towards this matter. At the same time, they stated that they would exercise their rights to make the accuser compensate them. They also stated that Tianshu Milk was manufactured under stringent conditions. It definitely wouldn\u2019t contain any problems.</p><br/><p>When this statement was released, it naturally drew many people\u2019s attention. Some other companies publicly supported them as well. Some television programmes which were sponsored by Tianshu Milk also stated their support and delivered harsh criticism against Master Lin\u2019s false accusation.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian said, \u201cWas that call from Tianshu Milk Company?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded. \u201cYeah, it was from their Law Department. They told me to delete my post and give myself in.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang looked at Lin Fan in shock. \u201cBrother Lin, let\u2019s not play around anymore. If there\u2019s evidence, we have to quickly release it. Otherwise, when this situation gets out of hand, we\u2019ll be screwed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan said anxiously, \u201cBrother Lin, look at your Weibo. Your fans are telling you to quickly release the evidence. Otherwise, they\u2019d be worried and anxious about you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMmm, I got it. I\u2019ll bring the product for testing later. But actually, I shouldn\u2019t have to do it. Someone else should test it,\u201d said Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>At that moment, noises came from afar.</p><br/><p>A group of reporters was charging towards Cloud Street yet again. When Lin Fan saw those figures, he had a dumbfounded look on his face. <em>What are these reporters here for? Isn\u2019t the news out already?</em></p><br/><p><em>They\u2019re still coming to interview me? I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a need for that, is there?</em></p><br/><p>The reporters rushed over hurriedly. They viewed this matter with great importance.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, was your Weibo account hacked?\u201d a reporter yelled. It was as if he was giving Lin Fan a chance to escape. After all, such incidents of hacking were very common. Although some people would likely say that he hadn\u2019t been hacked, most netizens would believe it without a problem.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cNo, my account wasn\u2019t hacked. I posted it myself.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn\u2026\u201d When the reporter heard that, he felt helpless. He cursed madly in his heart. <em>My dear Master Lin, it was such a good opportunity to escape but you didn\u2019t cherish it. Now, things will get complicated.</em></p><br/><p>Lin Fan lifted up the remaining half a box of milk and headed towards the door. \u201cI\u2019m going out. You guys look after the shop. Don\u2019t worry about this. I have faith in myself. There\u2019s definitely a problem with this milk.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian and the rest looked at Lin Fan and sighed in their hearts. They really wished that things would turn out that way as well. Otherwise, it would really be f*cked up.</p></div>\n</div>"}

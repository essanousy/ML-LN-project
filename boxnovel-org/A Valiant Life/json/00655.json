Wasn\u2019t the situation very grave just now? What did you guys do to that Chen He? He even actively paid the bill after eating. That doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled, \u201cI won\u2019t tell you. I\u2019ll let you guess\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCheh. You say it as if I want to know very badly,\u201d responded Liu Xu. However, she really looked like she wanted to know very badly. What had happened just now? And just how badly did this Chief Chen get f*cked?</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I shan\u2019t tell you.\u201d Lin Fan smiled. He just didn\u2019t want to tell Liu Xu what had happened. He wanted to let this woman slowly think.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cMing Yang, what are you guys going to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xu Zi Le had returned, so naturally, Wang Ming Yang had to go have some fun with his wife.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou drank some wine today, so you definitely cannot drive. Let me send you home then,\u201d said Wang Ming Yang.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cSorry for the trouble then. I\u2019ll have to disturb your precious night.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck, you\u2019ve become so crude after just a little alcohol,\u201d scolded Wang Ming Yang jokingly. Xu Zi Le\u2019s face turned a little red too as she said, \u201cBrother Lin, you have to hurry up and find yourself a girlfriend. Then, you wouldn\u2019t be so lonely at night anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled, \u201cLet\u2019s go. Enough nonsense.\u201d</p><br/><p>In the car.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t Zi Le get on this car with us?\u201d asked Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang looked at him and said, \u201cShe\u2019s driving with that Qiao Xue and they\u2019re following behind us. Oh right, you said that Chen He won\u2019t take revenge, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said confidently, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, he won\u2019t.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang nodded, \u201cThat\u2019s good. That guy, Chen He, is quite powerful in the North. If he holds a grudge against us, Zi Le won\u2019t be able to go to the North anymore. But regardless, I would still let Zi Le go to the North. This Southside has been developed enough already.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d Lin Fan nodded and didn\u2019t say much else.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh right, what do you think about that Qiao Xue?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan thought for a moment. \u201cShe\u2019s a pretty good little lady. She\u2019s beautiful and sensible.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang nudged Lin Fan\u2019s arm and grinned. \u201cJust now, Zi Le talked to me. If you want, she can stay with you tonight. In future, that little lady would have someone to watch over her in this industry.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh please. Are you still my Brother? You\u2019re forcing me to be the kind of person I dislike the most?\u201d Lin Fan said, \u201cI took a look. This Qiao Xue has a pretty good relationship with your wife and she\u2019s a reliable friend. You can just help her out a little and it\u2019ll be enough, you don\u2019t have to take this path.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, I knew you would say this. But I\u2019m really suspicious about whether you\u2019re gay. Fortunately, I have a girlfriend. Otherwise, people would definitely think I\u2019m gay.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck. I just want to experience this beautiful society. When the time comes, I\u2019ll find a girlfriend,\u201d said Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang shook his head, \u201cI think it will be difficult. It\u2019s not that it would be hard to find a girlfriend but your luck with women is a little too strong. Enough talk. I\u2019m sure you have some plan. Let\u2019s see how you resolve it when the time comes but I would advise you not to drag this out. Men bloom at thirty-one but women already start withering at thirty. Even if you don\u2019t think for yourself, you have to give others a statement.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked over at Wang Ming Yang. \u201cYou b*stard\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>In the pink car behind.</p><br/><p>Xu Zi Le was in a very good mood. She let out a heavy sigh from the bottom of her heart.</p><br/><p>Qiao Xue looked at Sister Xu curiously.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it, Xue Er? Is there a flower on your Sister Xu\u2019s face or something?\u201d asked Xu Zi Le with a laugh.</p><br/><p>Qiao Xue shook her heard and said in a gentle tone. \u201cNo, it\u2019s just that I never thought Sister Xu\u2019s Big Bro would be so amazing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xu Zi Le smiled, \u201cOf course he is. He\u2019s a good brother of Ming Yang\u2019s. I am only able to be together with Ming Yang because he put in a good word for me. Sometimes, I\u2019m even envious of Big Bro. He has an even better relationship with Ming Yang than I do.\u201d</p><br/><p>Today\u2019s incident had given Qiao Xue a huge shock. She had known how messy this industry was but she had never expected to see what she had seen that day.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow could that be? I can tell that Chief Wang really likes you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xu Zi Le smiled but didn\u2019t reply to that. \u201cOh right, Xue Er, are you going to continue being in this industry?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qiao Xue nodded, \u201cMmm, I\u2019ll keep working hard.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t mind what I\u2019m going to say to you. About today\u2019s incident, if your Sister Xu wasn\u2019t Ming Yang\u2019s girlfriend, what do you think would have happened tonight?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qiao Xue didn\u2019t say anything. Naturally, she knew what the outcome would have been.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can see that you\u2019re sensible. Sister Xu shall tell you bluntly. If you want to be in this industry, it\u2019s very hard to succeed without paying in some way. There are very little people who become popular without paying in some way. Brother Lin is a pretty good man, he\u2019s good-looking and he\u2019s amazing too. If you don\u2019t want to become someone\u2019s plaything, Sister Xu can help you. Although you don\u2019t have a high status, you can at least get a pillar of support.\u201d Xu Zi Le said this very bluntly but there was no other choice. She liked this Xue Er very much and she was willing to treat her like a sister. However, with her current status, Xu Zi Le couldn\u2019t guarantee that she could protect Qiao Xue.</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t dare to tell Wang Ming Yang about this. After all, Ming Yang didn\u2019t have the time to care about others.</p><br/><p>But if Qiao Xue formed a relationship with Brother Lin, Ming Yang would have to care about her.</p><br/><p>She knew that this would be Qiao Xue\u2019s first time. Men cared very much about these kinds of things. Being in this industry was sometimes a gamble as well.</p><br/><p>Although this was a little dark, all that she had said was true.</p><br/><p>But\u2026</p><br/><p>She hadn\u2019t said a certain thing yet. Brother Lin might not agree because he wasn\u2019t that type of person.</p><br/><p>Qiao Xue wasn\u2019t a newbie, she knew that Sister Xu was doing this for her own good. And it was only because she had been so sincere towards Sister Xu that Sister Xu would say this and help her find a reliable pillar of support.</p><br/><p>However, Qiao Xue hadn\u2019t decided yet.</p><br/><p>Xu Zi Le smiled as she drove. \u201cAlright, little girl, don\u2019t think too much. This matter isn\u2019t confirmed yet. Brother Lin is a warm-hearted man. If you can become his friend, Brother Lin would be happy to help you. So later on, Sister Xu shall introduce you to Brother Lin. as for whether it works out or not, that will depend on you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qiao Xue said, \u201cThank you for looking out for me, Sister Xu.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xu Zi Le laughed, \u201cHaha, I thought that you would be annoyed with me for doing this. Oh right, next time, if you\u2019re doing any shows and you see Wu Huan Yue, you have to form a good relationship with her because she\u2019s Brother Lin\u2019s friends.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qiao Xue said, \u201cYou\u2019re talking about that Wu Huan Yue who rose up very quickly and now has many great hits?</p><br/><p>Xu Zi Le nodded, \u201cMmm. Also, did you know that those great hits were all written by Brother Lin? Now you understand how amazing Brother Lin is, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMmm, that\u2019s really amazing.\u201d Qiao Xue nodded.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>At the entrance of Lin Fan\u2019s home.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan and Wang Ming Yang were leaning on the car, smoking. Xu Zi Le\u2019s car arrived.</p><br/><p>They got off the car.</p><br/><p>Xu Zi Le said, \u201cBrother Lin, thank you for today.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan flicked the cigarette ashes away. \u201cNo need to thank me. We\u2019re family, what\u2019s there to thank for?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Lin, this is my Little Sister, Qiao Xue,\u201d introduced Xu Zi Le.</p><br/><p>Qiao Xue said nervously, \u201cHello, Brother Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan sized her up for a moment and said, \u201cMmm, not bad. A very kind-hearted little lady. Zi Le, this Little Sister of yours is not bad. In future, you have to take care of her. I shall go up now. You guys should go back early too.\u201d</p><br/><p>After saying this, Lin Fan turned around and left.</p><br/><p>After Lin Fan had left, Xu Zi Le asked, \u201cMing Yang, what did Brother Lin say?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang sighed, \u201cSigh, I\u2019m gonna be busy again from now on.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d asked Xu Zi Le in a puzzled tone.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang said, \u201cYou don\u2019t understand? I told you that this wouldn\u2019t work but it ended up very well. Qiao Xue, you\u2019re really pretty good. Do you want to hop over to Brother Wang\u2019s company? Your Brother Wang will pay your contract termination fee for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xu Zi Le smiled as she held onto Qiao Xue\u2019s shoulder. She gently patted her head and said, \u201cYou\u2019ve gotten lucky, little girl.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qiao Xue had no idea what was going on yet. But eventually, she understood. Brother Wang was willing to let her join his company and was even willing to pay her contract termination fee.</p><br/><p>\u201cSighhh.\u201d Wang Ming Yang shook his head, \u201cI have to work hard to earn money. Otherwise, I won\u2019t be able to cover you guys in future.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xu Zi Le held onto Wang Ming Yang\u2019s waist. \u201cHusband. Muacks.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang chuckled and said vulgarly, \u201cLet\u2019s go back and have sex!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xu Zi Le blushed. \u201cXue Er is still here, don\u2019t talk nonsense.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Qiao Xue looked enviously at Sister Xue. She had found a home.</p></div>\n</div>"}

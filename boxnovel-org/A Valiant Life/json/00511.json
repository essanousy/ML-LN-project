This was written based on ancient texts. However, is that correct? Does it mean that whatever the ancient scholars wrote is true? We need to use our own logic to differentiate this too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPage 35, third paragraph.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPage 48, sixth paragraph.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPage 103, the twelfth paragraph.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The netizens on the Internet were stunned. They realized that Master Lin was incredible.</p><br/><p>\u201c666\u2026He\u2019s just brutally humiliating them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin is indeed Master Lin. What he said was based on facts and there\u2019s nothing we could argue about.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI feel that what Master Lin said is very true. The ancient scholars are humans and we\u2019re humans too. Why should we hold firmly onto ancient beliefs? We need to use our own logic and challenge them sometimes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, the medical technology is so advanced now. That\u2019s something that the ancient scholars can\u2019t compete with.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing sat in front of his computer and scrolled through Weibo. He saw that his mentor was doing extremely well. However, he wasn\u2019t particularly happy. He was serious about what his mentor posted on Weibo. He treated it like a lesson.</p><br/><p>He started to flip through a Chinese Medical Foundation textbook as he continued reading the posts. He tried to look for the ideas that Lin Fan had posted and used a pen to mark them out in the book.</p><br/><p>He also realized that the Chinese Medicine foundational teachings had something wrong but he wasn\u2019t clear about it. When he looked at it again, he realized that things seemed really wrong.</p><br/><p>At the Chinese Medical Association.</p><br/><p>Zhou Qing Quan immediately got everyone to open up Weibo and look at Master Lin\u2019s Weibo. Although Master Lin\u2019s words sounded a little stupid, they were indeed true. They looked through some of the questions and found out that what he said was correct.</p><br/><p>Wang Tian Feng heaved a sigh, \u201cMaster Lin is going to create a revolution in Chinese Medicine.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Qing Quan smiled bitterly, \u201cYeah, I didn\u2019t expect it too.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Tian Feng smiled, \u201cI feel that what the godly doctor said was true. We should reflect on his words.\u201d</p><br/><p>The surrounding crowd nodded in agreement.</p><br/><p>This was the first time someone had criticised the Chinese Medicine foundational teachings online. Also, he did it with evidence and it was difficult to argue about it.</p><br/><p>The students in the Chinese Medical Academy were all stunned.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, is it true? There are so many mistakes in the teaching materials?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. My medical skills are average and I don\u2019t understand anything. Anyway, I just believed whatever the book wrote.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe \u2018Qing Yuan Medical Text\u2019 is a book that we have had to memorize by heart. The godly doctor said that it had a lot of misconceptions. Does that mean that we memorized it for nothing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, that can\u2019t be. That means we\u2019ve been played.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cQuick, make a note of what he wrote. What the godly doctor said must be logical and true. If he removes his posts, we won\u2019t be able to find it anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan started to publish more posts. He had already offended people and he wasn\u2019t afraid anymore. He just wanted to spill the beans and cause chaos.</p><br/><p>\u201cI shall answer the above question with another question.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy is Chinese Medicine still using the wrong theories and using them to develop misconceptions? The teaching materials are practically useless.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI think it is because of people\u2019s thinking. That caused this to happen,\u201d Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing had been concentrating on his mentor\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>Those questions were worthy of consideration.</p><br/><p>Then, he realized that the teacher\u2019s words were shocking. It was the most shocking thing on earth.</p><br/><p>Ding ding!</p><br/><p>His phone rang.</p><br/><p>\u201cDirector Zhao, please appease the godly doctor. His words shouldn\u2019t be said now,\u201d someone from the Education Department called.</p><br/><p>They were dumbfounded by those posts online.</p><br/><p>The peaceful world of Chinese Medicine was going to be overturned.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing said regretfully, \u201cSorry, I agree with his ideas. Also, my mentor has his own way of thinking. As his disciple, I don\u2019t have any reason to go against him.\u201d</p><br/><p>He hung up the call</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing continued to read what Lin Fan had posted. He wasn\u2019t going to be commanded by anyone.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, he felt that what his mentor said was flawless.</p><br/><p>The modern society had advanced technology and the medical facilities were highly capable. Chinese Medicine should be progressing rapidly in such a good environment. People should be able to create more medications to benefit people. However, Chinese Medicine was stagnant.</p><br/><p>He felt that Chinese Medicine had to be reformed but it was difficult.</p><br/><p>If an average Chinese medical doctor said those things, he would definitely have been attacked by people as they would think that he was spreading nonsense.</p><br/><p>Students in the Chinese Medical Academy were brilliant. However, they could only handle exams. If they were to face patients, they might be lost and not know what to do.</p><br/><p>Although they didn\u2019t know what was going to happen in the future, his words were extremely impactful.</p><br/><p>Countless of netizens were looking at Lin Fan\u2019s Weibo.</p><br/><p>Although they didn\u2019t really understand what was going on, they felt that he was incredible.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was typing non-stop and he published a lot of posts.</p><br/><p>The modern medical students were also looking at his Weibo.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis Master Lin is incredible. Just by reading these posts, I can tell that he understands modern medicine very well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard this godly doctor isn\u2019t just good at Chinese Medicine. He is also amazing in modern medicine. It is incredible.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Wu Xi Jun was infuriated. He didn\u2019t expect this fella to talk so much regarding this.</p><br/><p>\u201c@Master Lin, that\u2019s enough. Stop it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was extremely happy from posting. When he saw Wu Xi Jun directing a message at him, he smiled and replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot enough. It will never be enough. There are so many things I want to talk about. Wait till I\u2019m done.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Xi Jun was dumbfounded by his reply. He really wanted to kill this man. However, he couldn\u2019t do anything about it.</p><br/><p>He felt that things were about to go down after looking at the situation online.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour mum! I want to see how long you can continue posting.\u201d Wu Xi Jun knew that he couldn\u2019t have stopped him. However, he didn\u2019t believe that Lin Fan wouldn\u2019t stop posting.</p><br/><p>Half an hour later.</p><br/><p>The netizens were stunned because Lin Fan was still posting.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing was dumbfounded too. His mentor had so much to say and it was all based on evidence.</p><br/><p>An hour later.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was still feeling energetic and he was still typing non-stop.</p><br/><p>Wu Xi Jun felt like killing himself. He didn\u2019t expect this fella to have so much to say.</p><br/><p>The people from the Education Department were stunned. They could only laugh at it. He wasn\u2019t even finished and this matter was blowing up. They could already predict what was going to happen the next day.</p><br/><p>It wouldn\u2019t have mattered if it was posted by an average citizen but he was a godly doctor.</p><br/><p>He was a godly Chinese medical doctor. His sudden stream of posts would definitely cause a chain reaction.</p><br/><p>The Education Department was going to be the first group of people to be affected.</p><br/><p>After all, they were the ones who were managing the Chinese Medical Academies.</p><br/><p>People from the Chinese Medicinal Association were helpless. Zhou Qing Quan could only laugh about it. He knew that this would happen.</p><br/><p>Two hours later.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was a little tired from typing. \u201cThat\u2019s all for today. I\u2019ll post more in the future. If I were to continue, I\u2019d get beaten up.\u201d</p><br/><p>Some of the netizens observed it for two whole hours and they could only post the following lines.</p><br/><p>\u201c6666\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the most awesome guy ever.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve spoken about it for two hours and you\u2019re still afraid of being beaten up?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Fan has the most knowledge in society. It is truly terrifying.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p></div>\n</div>"}

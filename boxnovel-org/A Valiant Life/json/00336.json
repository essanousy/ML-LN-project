He looked at Zhang Meng Jun with a puzzled look and asked, \"What is it?\"</p><br/><p>\"Nah, I just saw that you seemed to be distracted. Are you still bothered by that matter? Actually, I think that you shouldn't keep thinking about it. It has already passed for so long,\" said Zhang Meng Jun. He felt helpless. Back then, he hadn't said the truth because he felt had that it would sow discord but after seeing Bai Qi this time, he felt that he should say it. He could see that Bai Qi still missed Jia Hui. To him, this wasn't worth it at all. That was why he had told him the truth. Although it was hurtful, at least it was better than being kept in the dark.</p><br/><p>Autumn Sword Fish Killer nodded., \"I know that. Don't worry, I'm not thinking that much.\"</p><br/><p>Zhang Meng Jun nodded. \"It'd be best if you could accept it.\"</p><br/><p>At that moment, a female classmate who was sitting at the side asked curiously, \"Bai Qi, what are you doing now?\"</p><br/><p>\"Nothing much, just working some public relations on the Internet and getting through the days,\" said Autumn Sword Fish Killer very honestly. It was the truth but he put it in a more pleasant way, 'public relations'. If he had put it in a less pleasant way, it would have been 'Chief of the Internet trolls'.</p><br/><p>\"Oh, it sounds really impressive,\" said the female student. Then, she didn't care further about this matter. She took out her phone and took a photo of the stage.</p><br/><p>The banquet had already begun. The light dimly shone downwards and the music started to play. Many people took out their phones to capture photos of this moment.</p><br/><p>Autumn Sword Fish Killer looked at the beautiful bride on the stage and felt an aching in his heart. However, he had already accepted it. He didn't feel any bitterness in his heart. He even wished for them to be well.</p><br/><p>He took out his phone and recorded a video. Then, his finger pressed on the 'caption' box and in that moment, he didn't know what to type. Finally, his fingers moved.</p><br/><p>'May you live a hundred years happily together.'</p><br/><p>The video was posted.</p><br/><p>This time, Autumn Sword Fish Killer could feel his classmates pointing at him and talking about him. Although they didn't laugh at him, he knew that in their hearts, they were all laughing at how fat he had become.</p><br/><p>300 pounds, he was fat indeed. However, he had worked hard too. He just couldn't lose any weight. Who could be blamed for that?</p><br/><p>If there was anyone to blame, it should be those guys who made the food. Why did they make the food so delicious? If the food had tasted bad, he surely wouldn't have eaten so much.</p><br/><p>This blame was thrown beautifully.</p><br/><p>The atmosphere at the banquet was pretty good. Zhang Meng Jun raised his cup. \"Let's have a toast.\"</p><br/><p>Autumn Sword Fish Killer didn't like to drink white wine but this time, he drank a little. He wouldn't have felt good if he didn't drink. He had pain in his heart that he couldn't let go of. He could only use alcohol to dispel his sadness. But instead, he only got more and more depressed. His tears started to fall. If the lighting wasn't so dim, other people would have seen this.</p><br/><p>From the stage, the two of them walked down.</p><br/><p>Wu Hao Yun said, \"I'm dead tired. Weddings really are too tiring.\"</p><br/><p>Wu Heng Liang urged them, \"Two of you, go change your clothes. Later on, follow me next door to propose a toast.\"</p><br/><p>\"Huh?\" Wu Hao Yun was surprised. \"Dad, there's no need to be in such a rush, right? At least let us rest for a while. We haven't even had a toast with our family elders, why are we going over there now?\"</p><br/><p>Wu Heng Liang frowned. \"I'm telling you to go, so just go. Stop talking so much.\"</p><br/><p>If they had a toast with their own family members first, with so many tables, how long would they take? The people next door might already have left by then. Hence, they had to change immediately and go to the room next door to propose a toast.</p><br/><p>After Wu Hao Yun and Liu Jia Hui had changed, Wu Heng Liang warned them, \"Remember, you have to be courteous to the people next door. Don't speak any nonsense. They're all important people of Shanghai. Don't give them any bad impressions of you.\"</p><br/><p>Wu Hao Yun had mixed around in society as well and he knew how important it was to get to know important people, hence, he was thrilled. His family background was pretty good too and for those people to be recognized as important people by his father, they had to be pretty f*cking awesome. Their fortunes were probably hard to imagine.</p><br/><p>Liu Jia Hui was slightly astonished as well and she was also a little excited. She felt proud of herself and she felt that among her fellow classmates, she was the one who had married the best man.</p><br/><p>Wu Hao Yun asked, \"Dad, who's there?\"</p><br/><p>Wu Heng Liang replied, \"I don't know either but the chief witness of your wedding, Chief Huang, is already a powerful man in Shanghai. Even he personally rushed over there. From that, you can imagine what kind of beings those people next door are.\"</p><br/><p>Wu Hao Yun nodded. \"Oh, oh. They must be very impressive.\"</p><br/><p>Liu Jia Hui said, \"Dad, neither I nor Hao Yun recognizes them, so who should we propose a toast to first later on?\"</p><br/><p>Wu Heng Liang hesitated for a moment, then said, \"Just listen to what I say later and you'll be fine.\"</p><br/><p>\"Understood,\" said Wu Hao Yun with a nod. In his heart, he vowed to himself that he would prepare himself properly and portray himself well. If he could let those uncles remember him, then he would be fortunate in future.</p><br/><p>Very soon, the three of them were outside the entrance of the room.</p><br/><p>*Knock knock*</p><br/><p>The door was opened.</p><br/><p>Wu Heng Liang walked at the front while Wu Hao Yun and Liu Jia Hui followed behind. When their gazes fell on the people inside, they were puzzled. They had no idea who these people were.</p><br/><p>Wu Heng Liang looked at the people inside and his heart shifted. When he scanned the room, he recognized a few people while he didn't recognize the others. Those he did recognize were all much more powerful than him and even a little more powerful than Chief Huang.</p><br/><p>Huang Zhi Qiang smiled widely and said, \"Speak of the devil. Chief Wu's son is getting married today and he said he would bring them over to have a toast. I couldn't stop him even if I tried. A wedding is an important event, he didn't have to trouble himself.\"</p><br/><p>Wu Heng Liang said with a face full of smiles, \"What are you talking about, Chief Huang? If I had known, I would have invited everyone over to the wedding as well. Chief Huang, I'm going to propose a toast to you first. Later on, I'll have to trouble you to introduce us to all these sirs.\"</p><br/><p>Out of all these people here, he was the most familiar with Chief Huang. He thought that toasting to Chief Huang first couldn't be wrong. At least he wouldn't offend Chief Huang.</p><br/><p>Huang Zhi Qiang waved his hand and smiled. \"Chief Wu, I cannot accept this toast. The first person you should toast to is this man. Let me introduce him to you. He's Master Lin. Don't judge him because he's young. He's actually our big brother. You can afford to offend all these rich men around here but you mustn't offend him.\"</p><br/><p>Wu Heng Liang looked at that man and was stunned. As Chief Huang had said, he was very young indeed. If Chief Huang hadn't said anything, he really would have overlooked this man. Although he didn't know who this man was, he saw that everyone else didn't have any objections about what had been said. It was clear that the person with the highest status there was this Master Lin. Then, he raised a cup and smiled. \"Master Lin, this lowly man, Wu Heng Liang, would like to propose a toast to you.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded and smiled. \"I'm driving, so I'm going to use another drink as a substitute.\"</p><br/><p>Wu Heng Liang said, \"I'll drink first as respect.\"</p><br/><p>He drank the whole cup in one mouth.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan took a sip of his drink.</p><br/><p>\"Master Lin, this is my son, Wu Hao Yun, and my daughter-in-law, Liu Jia Hui. The two of you, give a toast to Master Lin,\" said Wu Heng Liang.</p><br/><p>When Wu Hao Yun and Liu Jia Hui looked at Lin Fan, they were startled. He was very young indeed, perhaps even younger than them. However, they didn't dare to look down on him. They were even envious of him for having such high status at such a young age. When they compared themselves to him, it made them a little upset.</p><br/><p>\"Master Lin, this toast is to you,\" said Wu Hao Yun.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded and smiled. \"I wish for you two to be happy together. I've heard a little about the two of you.\"</p><br/><p>Astonishment!</p><br/><p>Wu Hao Yun and Liu Jia Hui were both stunned. They had never expected Master Lin to say that. Then, they let out puzzled expressions as they didn't know how Master Lin knew them.</p><br/><p>They instantly felt humbled.</p><br/><p>Wu Heng Liang was delighted. \"Master Lin, you know about my son?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved his hand. \"That's not exactly true. The Chief Technological Director of my Internet security, a little brother of mine, was a classmate of your son and your daughter-in-law. It seems that he is at your wedding as well.\"</p><br/><p>Huang Zhi Qiang exclaimed in shock, \"Ah, little brother Bai Qi is a classmate of Chief Wu's son? That's unexpected. Bai Qi is an important person under Master Lin.\"</p><br/><p>Wu Hao Yun and Liu Jia Hui were dumbfounded. What the f*ck was going on?</p><br/><p>This didn't seem right.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

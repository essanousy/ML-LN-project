The first prize didn\u2019t just consist of $100,000, it also allowed the winner to be personally guided by a mentor.</p><br/><p>The second and third prize winners would also receive monetary awards.</p><br/><p>The commendable pieces would receive a set of Chinese Arts accessories and tools.</p><br/><p>The prizes were awesome.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cSister, can you give me a piece of this poster?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSure, no problem. Little Boss, do you have a kid that wants to participate?\u201d The middle-aged lady asked.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled and nodded. \u201cYeah, I want him to have an eye-opening experience.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, he didn\u2019t say anything else. He continued with his day and he brought the poster around. When he was finished with this, he wanted to go and have a look. If it was possible, he wanted to let the children go and audition for it.</p><br/><p>They consumed the Little Intelligence pill and worked hard to learn arts and craft. He wanted to let them prove themselves.</p><br/><p>So that they would understand they were not inferior.</p><br/><p>After a while, he finished selling the ten scallion pancakes. Those that didn\u2019t manage to get any scallion pancakes were dejected. However, they consoled themselves and wanted to come and try again the next day. They didn\u2019t believe that they wouldn\u2019t win.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cI\u2019ll be heading out.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian was smoking, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Did something happen again?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved the poster, \u201cNothing much, I just want them to register for the Youth Chinese Arts Cup. I want to see how\u2019s the situation like.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, Fraud Tian started to get serious, \u201cThat\u2019s true. Those children can really draw. If they were to participate in this, they\u2019d definitely win.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled, \u201cI don\u2019t want to belittle the other contestants. They are awesome too. I\u2019ll be taking a look.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, he left the shop.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian shook his head, \u201cI think he will be involved in the Children\u2019s Welfare Organisation for a long time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan was cleaning up the table. She turned around and said, \u201cIsn\u2019t that good? That shows that he is caring.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian replied, \u201cI didn\u2019t say it wasn\u2019t good. It is really meaningful.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>On the way there.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was driving to the destination. The registration venue was at Chuan Mao Building, level 13.\u201d</p><br/><p>He parked his car when he arrived.</p><br/><p>As he entered the lift, there were several parents who brought their children there. The parents started talking in the lift.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Youth Chinese Arts Cup prizes are amazing this time. The best contestant will be personally mentored by someone from the National Chinese Arts Association.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. We don\u2019t really care about the money. We just want to be the best and let my child have a mentor. That is extraordinary.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d</p><br/><p>They were discussing among themselves and Lin Fan just listened.</p><br/><p>The National Chinese Arts Association had a strong impact. The artists there were well-liked and respectable figures. Especially when their artworks could be sold for up to a few million dollars. It was crazy.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, their child could be mentored by one of those grandmasters. Their future would definitely be secured.</p><br/><p>On the 13th level.</p><br/><p>There were a lot of people there. Some of the parents were there to inquire about the event. While others brought their children to register for it.</p><br/><p>There was a long table in the spacious classroom. The people in charge of registration were talking and explaining to the parents.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan went forward, \u201cCan I ask if the only requirement is that the children must be below 14 years old?\u201d</p><br/><p>A middle-aged man replied Lin Fan, \u201cYes, as long as they\u2019re below 14, they\u2019re eligible. This time, the Youth Chinese Arts Cup is organized by the National Chinese Arts Association. It is a nationwide event. If your child is eligible, you just have to pay $50 for the registration fee.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow should I register then?\u201d Lin Fan asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is our website. You can register online. You have to provide identification details. You can also come here to register,\u201d the man replied.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was a little lost. The online registration required identification details. Most of the children in the welfare organization didn\u2019t have any form of personal identification. It was going to be a difficult situation. Also, there were 365 children. If he were to send all of them here, it was going to be difficult to take care of them.</p><br/><p>The worker added, \u201cIf you\u2019d like to register for your child, you have to register soon. Today is the last day.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cSorry, my situation is a little complex. I am here to register for children in a welfare organization. However, there are a lot of children and their identification details are not complete. Furthermore, if I were to bring all of them here, it would be impractical. Is there any other way that I can do this?\u201d</p><br/><p>The worker was a little stunned, \u201cThat\u2026 Hold on, I will ask the person in charge. I haven\u2019t met your situation yet.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><br/><p>The worker stood up and went to the office. He was willing to help him register for those children in the welfare organization. After all, it was a good deed. As long as the children were eligible, they could register for it. There weren\u2019t any hidden criteria.</p><br/><p>When he talked about the Children\u2019s Welfare Organisation, some of the parents turned around in shock.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, are you Master Lin?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled and nodded, \u201cYes, hello everyone.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, are you registering for the children too?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cYeah, I want to let the children from the welfare organization participate in this. Even if they don\u2019t win anything, it would be a good experience for them.\u201d</p><br/><p>The parents nodded and then continued talking to Lin Fan. Everyone in Shanghai knew who Master Lin was.</p><br/><p>The Internet was booming and this event was going to take place in Shanghai. Some of the Shanghai publishers occasionally reported news about Lin Fan. Hence, everyone knew about him.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, what Master Lin did in Qingzhou won their respect. At the same time, they were happy about it. After all, Master Lin was from Shanghai.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, I admire you a lot.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled calmly at their compliments. It was already a common sight. He naturally didn\u2019t think too much about it.</p><br/><p>Soon, the person in charge came out. When he found out about it, he also tried to think of a way to solve it. When he knew that it was Master Lin\u2019s request, he became even more passionate about it.</p><br/><p>Master Lin was famous. The person in charge wasn\u2019t from the National Chinese Arts Association and he didn\u2019t know that Lin Fan was in it.</p><br/><p>If he had known that Master Lin was a member of the association, he would\u2019ve been more passionate about it.</p><br/><p>However, he was definitely going to treat the matter seriously.</p><br/><p>Then, the person in charge said that he was going to send some people to the Children\u2019s Welfare Organisation to handle the children\u2019s registration. The service was superb. Lin Fan felt a little embarrassed about it.</p><br/><p>It was as if they were backdooring the registration.</p><br/><p>However, he had to thank them for being so courteous.</p><br/><p>After all, it resolved a big problem for him.</p><br/><p>Initially, the person in charge wanted to waive the registration fees but he didn\u2019t have the rights to do so. He just sighed and shook his head.</p><br/><p>Then, Lin Fan brought a few people back to the Children\u2019s Welfare Organisation.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t know if the children were ready but he was looking forward to it. He hoped that the children would be well-ranked.</p><br/><p>It was time for him to show his capabilities as a mentor.</p></div>\n</div>"}

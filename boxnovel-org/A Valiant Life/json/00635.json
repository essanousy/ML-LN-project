Could he really be going there to give himself up?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>At this moment, everyone saw Godfather Ma get down the car. He followed the brat into the police station. From what they could see, that was an impossible situation.</p><br/><p>Outside the police station, Godfather Ma\u2019s men were anxiously making phone calls.</p><br/><p>\u201cPresident Huang, something big is about to happen, We are about to be royally screwed over.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m not lying. I\u2019m seeing it with my own eyes. We\u2019re screwed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Although it was night time, there were still a few policemen working the night shift inside the station.</p><br/><p>The policemen who were standing guard outside the station saw the men and thought that they were here to report a case, but as they walked closer, they were frightened.</p><br/><p>Those men were under Godfather Ma.</p><br/><p>Normal people would be afraid of the policemen.</p><br/><p>However, it was the opposite for Godfather Ma\u2019s men. The policemen were the ones afraid of them.</p><br/><p>The color from the policemen faces were all drained as they Godfather Ma himself outside the police station.</p><br/><p>What on earth was Godfather Ma doing here?</p><br/><p>Could it be something big?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere is your Commander?\u201d Ma Mu Feng asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cUpstairs\u2026\u201d one of the policemen answered, trembling.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome, cuff me up,\u201d Ma Mu Feng lifted his hands, gesturing to the policeman.</p><br/><p>\u201cCuff?\u201d the policeman looked puzzled.</p><br/><p>\u201cHandcuffs. We are here to give ourselves up,\u201d Ma Mu Feng said.</p><br/><p>The policemen who were standing around were stunned. What on earth was he talking about?</p><br/><p>Give themselves up?</p><br/><p>The office upstairs.</p><br/><p>\u201cCommander Chen, not good. Ma Mu Feng is here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Chang Ping was still pondering what the phone call was about just now. After hearing what his man told him, his facial expression changed. What was this guy here for? Was he here to cause more unnecessary trouble?</p><br/><p>\u201cGo down and ask,\u201d Chen Chang Ping said with an air of confidence. As the commander of the police station, he could not fear any troublemaker.</p><br/><p>Other people may be frightened by him, but he absolutely could not.</p><br/><p>Chen Chang Ping got himself ready, but he got the shock of his life when he walked downstairs.</p><br/><p>Ma Mu Feng and Liu Ren were both in handcuffs.</p><br/><p>The policeman who handcuffed Ma Mu Feng was trembling in fear, as if he never imagined this day would even be possible.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan examined Commander Chen who was walking towards them, seeing if he was as just as Chief Qin had described him to be. At that moment, he felt that Chief Qin was right.</p><br/><p>He had the look of a justice warrior.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow do you do, Commander Chen. I was the person who called you a while back,\u201d Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>\u201cLin Fan?\u201d Chen Chang Ping asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. I\u2019ll explain the situation. This is the infamous Ma Qing Zhou, or Godfather Ma, as some of you guys may call him. This person here is his right-hand man Liu Ren. I brought both of them here to surrender themselves to the law. They have seen the evil that they have done and they both are very regretful for what they had done, so they wanted to come here to give themselves up.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Chen Chang Ping thought he was dreaming.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Commander Chen? I wasn\u2019t kidding,\u201d Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>Ma Mu Feng\u2019s face was dead serious. \u201cI, Ma Mu Feng have done evil against heaven and earth. With the guidance of Master Lin, I have seen the error of my ways and how much evil I have caused. I am here to give myself up to the law. I\u2019m not here to seek forgiveness. I am just here to absolve myself.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh?\u201d Chen Chang Ping couldn\u2019t believe what he was hearing. His brain was like tofu, and he didn\u2019t know how to react. The other policemen were completely in a daze. They couldn\u2019t believe what was happening.</p><br/><p>Could Ma Mu Feng be pranking them?</p><br/><p>Or maybe Ma Mu Feng was testing them to see if they would do anything at all.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan furrowed his brows. \u201cCommander Chen, what are you going to do? I see that you know Chief Qin, so I brought him to you. If you aren\u2019t willing to do anything, I\u2019ll bring them elsewhere to give themselves up,\u201d Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Chen Chang Ping snapped himself out of his daze. He looked at the two people, realizing that both of them didn\u2019t look like they were joking. With all of his might, he shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cCommence the investigation!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d The policemen all reacted, looking on excitedly.</p><br/><p>Although they didn\u2019t know the full story of what was going on, they were elated. They had been waiting for this moment for too long.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello. Can I ask for the full story here? I\u2019m not dreaming, am I?\u201d Commander Chen asked Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. This is real. I came over from Shanghai and heard that Ma Mu Feng who was in Qing Zhou was in power over here. I went to have a little chat with him and he was influenced by me. He has reflected on all the bad things that he had done and has decided to give himself up to the law.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Chang Ping looked at Lin Fan, thinking that this was unimaginable and freakish.</p><br/><p>Chen Chang Ping thought he was dreaming as he walked into the interview room.</p><br/><p>Ma Mu Feng was sitting there, not concealing anything. \u201cI got other people to do this for me, and I asked them to dump the body near the rive. This is the location. You guys should be able to find it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd the case with the Green Jewel Land. I used underhand means to obtain the land. I kidnapped the rival competitor\u2019s daughters and forced him to pull out of the competition.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026and also in the Old City District one year back. The householder refused to vacate the property and so that night, I got people to break into the house and the residents were buried alive\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026and also\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ma Mu Feng didn\u2019t stop confessing everything he did, and everything that he said sounded like it was something normal.</p><br/><p>The policemen who were conducting the interview were listening in cold sweat. Could someone really be capable of that much evil?</p><br/><p>They could never have imagined anyone committing those crimes; it was simply too terrifying.</p><br/><p>Unimaginable evil, nauseating.</p><br/><p>Chen Chang Ping stood at one side, his fists clenched tightly. He felt as if there was a ball of gas in his stomach which just couldn\u2019t be removed.</p><br/><p>He knew that Ma Mu Feng was a bad person, but he never thought it would be to such an extreme degree. It was abominable and heartless- countless innocent men and women had perished under his hand.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was extremely uncomfortable. Ma Mu Feng was on tenterhooks as he confessed everything that he had done, and saying it out loud made everything he had done sound bad, and being locked up wasn\u2019t even going to begin to atone for his sins.</p><br/><p>He probably had to be tortured to death before he could finally get rid of all the indignation in his heart.</p><br/><p>It was unimaginable to have this sort of people is such a harmonious society.</p><br/><p>From the start to the end.</p><br/><p>Half an hour had passed.</p><br/><p>Ma Mu Feng showed no signs of stopping yet. The list went on and on.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhatever you\u2019re saying is the truth?\u201d Chen Chang Ping said, his tone of voice becoming more serious. He couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that he was being pranked.</p><br/><p>\u201cAbsolute truth. No a single half lie,\u201d Ma Mu Feng said, nodding his head.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Outside.</p><br/><p>Ma Mu Feng men were standing outside, rapidly making phone calls. They had been outside for more than half hour, and Godfather Ma still hasn\u2019t walked out yet. There could only be one possibility- that Godfather Ma really went to give himself up.</p><br/><p>They were hanging on to the last strand of hope.</p><br/><p>Suddenly!</p><br/><p>A convoy of news vans pulled up into the driveway, directly parking at the entrance of the police station.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck, they journalists are really here. What on earth is going on?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt can\u2019t be, this\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, outside the police station, a huge group of journalists got out from their vehicles, armed with notepads and cameras.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s here, Godfather Ma is confessing his crimes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that for real?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care if its real or not. This is going to be a huge piece of news.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p></div>\n</div>"}

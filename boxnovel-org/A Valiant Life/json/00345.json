I am the legendary songwriter, Master Lin.\"</p><br/><p>When the post was published, everyone was stunned.</p><br/><p>\"666\u2026 A war is about to happen. What is this stupid post about? Besides you, who else would dare to flame Ying Jin? They'd be looking for trouble.\"</p><br/><p>\"D*mn, that's hilarious. It's going to be big news. Master Lin is infuriating Ying Jin.\"</p><br/><p>\"What is going on? I just started reading about this and I'm totally clueless.</p><br/><p>\"Same here, I don't know what's going on either.\"</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan looked at Lin Fan in shock. \"Did you have to be so ruthless? But I think nobody would dare to help you flame her.\"</p><br/><p>\"I know.\" Lin Fan nodded.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan was speechless. \"You know that and you still posted that?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. \"I'm just trying to make myself famous but at the same time, I can assure you that there will be people that regret this opportunity in the near future. They'd be making a huge loss.\"</p><br/><p>This reason made her absolutely speechless and she couldn't think of any reply.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian shook his head. \"Would you feel uncomfortable if you don't cause trouble?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at Fraud Tian. \"I don't have anything to do anyway. If I don't find something interesting to do, I'd be very bored.\"</p><br/><p>It had to be said that Lin Fan's idea was brilliant.</p><br/><p>Ying Jin was a legend in the music industry and she was extremely experienced. If she personally started a flame war, it would definitely attract a lot of attention. Some news companies would definitely look into this.</p><br/><p>If they were to investigate this matter, the cause and events involved would be dug up.</p><br/><p>It could be considered digging up old news.</p><br/><p>An Internet celebrity, 'Nosy Parker', started to publish something about the cause of this incident.</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan saw the post, he sighed. There were indeed a lot of capable people on the Internet. This guy had posted about it in such a short time.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Ying Jin was already speechless. She immediately ranted, \"This fella wants to play this game with me. Alright\u2026\"</p><br/><p>The manager replied, \"Sister Ying, are you looking to Elder Si for help?\"</p><br/><p>Ying Jin waved her hand. \"No need for that. This fella doesn't require me to owe anyone else a favor.\"</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Then, Lin Fan's Weibo fans were all stunned.</p><br/><p>\"What is going on? Why did Master Lin start a fight with a world famous artist?\"</p><br/><p>\"I don't know. I realized that Master Lin is drifting further away from us. He was doing so well selling scallion pancakes. Now, he suddenly got involved with the entertainment industry and I feel like he's drifted away.\"</p><br/><p>\"That's awesome. Master Lin wants to be the most awesome person in the world. He dared to challenge Ying Jin.\"</p><br/><p>\"Why wouldn't he dare to do so? Master Lin is a legend. It's an easy task for him.\"</p><br/><p>A lot of people were intensely discussing it while Li Mu Ze and Lu Dao Ren were on Ying Jin's side. They were flaming Lin Fan too.</p><br/><p>This war was an intense one in the eyes of many people. However, it was a boring one to Lin Fan. It was just for him to kill time.</p><br/><p>At the same time, some artists snorted disdainfully when they saw Lin Fan's post. They felt that it was a joke for him to offer his songwriting services for infuriating Ying Jin.</p><br/><p>They didn't dare to offend Ying Jin, given her status in the music industry. Besides, what kind of quality would the album have? This person wasn't even well-known among the songwriters. He wasn't even worth talking about.</p><br/><p>Therefore, his post was ignored by a lot of people as they all thought that it was a joke.</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>Then, Wang Ming Yang called.</p><br/><p>\"Bro, why did you start fighting with Ying Jin again?\" Wang Ming Yang was impressed by this friend of his. He was the king of all troublemakers. The 'The New Voice' incident was an old one and the conflict between him and Ying Jin had already been resolved. However, it was still being dug out by the media again. It was going to be endless.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \"Nothing much. I just felt like doing that. Anyway, I'm in control of everything. Ying Jin's Weibo post was obviously targeting us. Why should I give her any face?\"</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang replied, \"That's true.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \"How are the album preparations going?\"</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang replied, \"The tune has been almost finalized. Wu Huan Yue is currently practicing her singing. These ten songs are going to be classics. Wu Huan Yue wants to give her best for all of them.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \"There's no need for that. Just release it sooner. Oh right, you have to use 'Master Lin' for the credits.\"</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang said, \"It's not up to me. Why not quit your scallion pancake business and come to write songs? This job is so simple and there's not much to do.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \"Get lost. I can't give up on the scallion pancake business. I can only stop when it's famous worldwide.\"</p><br/><p>\"That's ambitious. I'm supportive of you.\" Wang Ming Yang sighed. He was seriously impressed by this friend of his.</p><br/><p>After hanging up, Lin Fan stopped caring about what was happening online. After all, he wasn't a celebrity and the matter didn't affect him much. He could just flame her bit by bit when he had the time.</p><br/><p>Then, someone shouted outside.</p><br/><p>\"Someone's getting beaten up! Someone's getting beaten up!\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was stunned when he heard that. Who would dare to beat someone up on Cloud Street?</p><br/><p>Elder Liang said, \"Little Boss, quick, come out and have a look. There's a fight over there.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was stunned, \"What's going on?\"</p><br/><p>Elder Liang replied, \"I'm not sure. All I heard was that an old man started to sell peaches with his cart and got detained by the city enforcement officers. Now, it seems that they've started fighting.\"</p><br/><p>\"D*mn, this happened again? I thought it got resolved already?\" Lin Fan was stunned.</p><br/><p>Elder Liang replied, \"I don't know\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian and the others quickly rushed over.</p><br/><p>In the past, when Lin Fan hadn't had his Encyclopedia, he would run away as quickly as he could when he saw the city enforcement officers. However, it was different now. He knew that the old man was selling peaches in the area. That time when this old man had just started his business, he had offered all the shop owners a peach. Most of the shop owners hadn't accepted his gift but they agreed to let him sell peaches on Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>After all, it was still a business district. It wouldn't be a problem for him to move around to do business as long as he didn't set up a stall in the middle of the road. Furthermore, Elder Liang wasn't using a trishaw. He was using a bicycle and there were two baskets installed behind it.</p><br/><p>When they arrived at the scene, there were already a lot of people there. However, all of them were townsfolk.</p><br/><p>The shop owners also went forward to mediate the situation. However, it didn't seem too positive.</p><br/><p>The seventy-year-old man was being pressed onto the ground by three muscular and strong men. The floor was extremely hot from the scorching sun. The bicycle had collapsed at the side and the peaches were scattered all over the floor.</p><br/><p>\"D*mn it, all of you, stop right there!\" Lin Fan shouted.</p><br/><p>The district was different now. It wasn't like the past when Liu Xiao Tian had been in charge of it. Now, there were a bunch of crooks mixed in with the honest folk.</p><br/><p>However, they didn't stop after Lin Fan shouted. Lin Fan immediately went forward and kicked the three guys aside. Then, he helped the elderly man up and protected him.</p><br/><p>Then, Lin Fan looked at the seven people in front. \"What do you want?\"</p><br/><p>The three young men who got kicked aside frowned in anger. \"Did you just kick us?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes. Why did you hit him? Aren't the three of you ashamed of hitting an old man like him? Don't you know how hot the ground is? How about you guys give it a try?\" Lin Fan chided.</p><br/><p>One of the young men replied, \"Who are you to interfere with our work?\"</p><br/><p>Then, another man pointed at the bicycle. \"Bring everything back to our headquarters.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shouted, \"Don't touch anything!\"</p><br/><p>However, the city enforcement officers ignored his words.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the surrounding shop owners. \"Let's do this together. Block the exits. This is Cloud Street and it is our territory. It's not a place where you can do whatever you want. If you don't resolve this, all seven of you can forget about leaving this place. Why are the city enforcement officers so different these days? Do you guys have to be so violent?\"</p><br/><p>Elder Han was still panting. His face was red and there were injuries on him. Then, he said softly, \"Little Boss.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved his hand. \"It's okay. This is Cloud Street. We didn't mind you doing business here. What rights do they have to say no? Leave this to us.\"</p><br/><p>Then came the chance for the entire Cloud Street community to unite.</p><br/><p>Under the command of Lin Fan, the shop owners immediately gathered around and brought their brooms.</p><br/><p>Some people who didn't know what was going on also came out when they heard that Little Boss was getting bullied.</p><br/><p>Elder Zhang held onto a broom and said, \"If we don't resolve this, the seven of you can forget about leaving this place.\"</p><br/><p>Sister Hong added, \"How dare you come to Cloud Street and hit people? What did this old man do? He didn't even cause any trouble. He was just selling peaches and you guys hit him. Do you really think that the people of Cloud Street are pushovers?\"</p><br/><p>*Commotion*</p><br/><p>Then, the people that had come to Cloud Street to shop were stunned. It was something they had never seen before.</p><br/><p>They had been filming the entire process of the old man being pressed onto the ground but they didn't have the courage to step forward.</p><br/><p>The group of seven was stunned. \"Are you guys trying to impede law enforcement?\"</p><br/><p>...</p><br/>\n</div>"}

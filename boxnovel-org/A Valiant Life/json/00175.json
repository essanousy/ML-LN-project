In her heart, she felt that she didn't deserve to be treated like that. \"Mum, Dad, what are you doing\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Father Xia was filled with anger, \"Are you stupid? Why did you get yourself involved in this? How capable do you think you are? Even if you were the best, Starlight has already expelled you. Your past twenty years of hard work has been ruined. When we go back, I want you to go for matchmaking and get married.\" </p><br/><p>Mother Xia just sat in a corner and cried. She didn't blame her daughter as she knew that her daughter did it for justice. However, this matter wasn't something that an ordinary person could interfere with.</p><br/><p>Xia Yi Mo's eyes turned red as she looked at the scenic views outside. \"I'm not going for matchmaking. You don't understand. We can't just care about ourselves. Tolerating it and not doing anything would only have caused even more trouble.\"</p><br/><p>Mother Xia tried to console her, \"Your dad is just caring for you. Don't think too much. If you go for the exams again next year, you will still be able to return.\" </p><br/><p>\"What do you mean by that?\" Xia Yi Mo was stunned. She had a bad feeling about things.</p><br/><p>Father Xia waved his hand and said, \"Don't ask. Just listen to your mum and me.\" </p><br/><p>Xia Yi Mo was a little hot-tempered. With regards to something that concerned her, she had to do something about it. \"No. You have to tell me now, or else I will not go back.\"</p><br/><p>Father Xia's face became more stern, \"Just listen to me. Don't be involved in this matter any further and do not cause any more trouble.\" </p><br/><p>\"I remember that the school management called for you. What exactly did you tell them?\" Xia Yi Mo anxiously asked.</p><br/><p>Father Xia just closed his eyes and didn't reply while Mother Xia was sitting at the side. She tried to console her, \"Nothing much, your dad just begged for mercy. The school management agreed to let you go back next year.\" </p><br/><p>She didn't buy their story. Then, she received a Weibo notification on her phone. When she saw it, she was so angry that she cried. \"How could they do that? When did I even have clinical depression? They're maligning me. No, I have to clear things up.\"</p><br/><p>Father Xia snatched the phone over and looked at her, \"Do you really want to infuriate your mum and I to death?\"</p><br/><p>\"Did you agree with the school management about something? Otherwise, they'd never let me go back. Dad, tell me, honestly, did you make any agreement with them?\" Xia Yi Mo looked at her dad and asked. \"If you don't want me to die, you have to tell me.\"</p><br/><p>*slap*</p><br/><p>A slap went across her face. </p><br/><p>The passengers on the train looked over to see what was happening.</p><br/><p>\"What was that for\u2026\" Mother Xia's face changed as she grumbled at Father Xia.</p><br/><p>Father Xia looked at his daughter and he was heartbroken. Even then, he shouldn't have done that.</p><br/><p>\"Yes, it's my fault. I'm incapable. I agreed with the management to admit that you have clinical depression. But you have to understand that this matter is not something you can be involved in. I know exactly what you did and I'm proud of you. But you have to remember that this is not something that a teenager like you can interfere with.\"</p><br/><p>Then, he calmly said, \"Listen to me. Don't get involved in this incident again. It's not easy for your mum and me. We can't afford to offend anyone. Listen to me, okay?\"</p><br/><p>Xia Yi Mo looked at her dad as she held onto her clothes tightly with both hands. She lowered her head and her tears started to flow down her face. </p><br/><p>Father Xia sighed. He thought to himself that maybe things would get better once he counsels her at home.</p><br/><p>\"Dad, pass my phone to me,\" Xia Yi Mo said.</p><br/><p>\"No,\" Father Xia declined.</p><br/><p>\"Dad, pass it to me. I promise I won't post anything. I just want to have a look at Weibo,\" Xia Yi Mo added.</p><br/><p>Finally, when Xia Yi Mo received her phone, she opened Weibo and read through it intently.</p><br/><p>Master Lin\u2026</p><br/><p>She believed that justice will prevail one day. It was just a little late.</p><br/><p>... </p><br/><p>At Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang looked at the current situation and shook his head, \"This matter is technically finished.\"</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan didn't believe it. \"How could it be? Things have blown up. There's definitely more to this.\" </p><br/><p>Fraud Tian sighed, \"The conclusion has been written. She has clinical depression.\"</p><br/><p>Wu Tian Gang was a wise and experienced man. Naturally, he had seen these things happen before. \"The more people that are dragged into this, the greater the impact. They all don't want any of this to damage their reputations. It's not that simple.\"</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Lin Fan stroked his chin as he looked outside. Nobody knew what he was thinking.</p><br/><p>*Ring ring*</p><br/><p>Wu Tian He's phone rang. When he looked at it, he shook his head. \"Looks like it's almost finished. Mr. Zhao tried his best.\"</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming said, \"Elder Wu, I'm really sorry. I can only help you till this point. All related content on Weibo has to be removed. I will keep your mentor's Weibo unblocked but he can't post about this any further.\"</p><br/><p>Wu Tian He already knew it was going to happen. Naturally, he didn't have much of a reaction. \"Mr. Zhao, thank you very much.\"</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming replied, \"Elder Wu, I can't afford to take any responsibility for this. I can only help you so much.\"</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>When he hung up the phone, the shop became silent.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan didn't believe it. \"How can things just end like that?\"</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang cursed, \"They're despicable.\" </p><br/><p>Fraud Tian looked at Lin Fan and asked, \"What do you plan to do? Is it really going to end like this?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan recovered from his daze and smiled. \"I have no choice. I'm not powerful enough to defeat them all.\"</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian took a glance, \"This is unlike you.\" </p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled but he was a little angry inside. Then, he opened up Weibo.</p><br/><p>Indeed!</p><br/><p>The headlines that just went viral got removed. He couldn't seem to open the articles. </p><br/><p>Although the Weibo accounts of the Internet celebrities didn't get banned, the related content that they reposted were all removed. In an instant, the matter was back to ground zero. It was as if it never happened before.</p><br/><p>Some of the ordinary netizens were flaming them online but it was useless. </p><br/><p>Furthermore, Lin Fan's first few reposts were also removed. At least he managed to keep his Weibo account.</p><br/><p>Many netizens flooded Lin Fan's Weibo and discussed in the comments.</p><br/><p>\"F*ck their moms, what's going to happen to Master Lin?\" </p><br/><p>\"They've started to remove posts again. We can't seem to avoid it. At least they didn't ban us. Otherwise, we'd be crying now.\"</p><br/><p>\"Haha, the truth will always prevail. Evidence must be provided, if not, everything is nothing but a lie.\"</p><br/><p>\"This rubbish Master Lin must be riding the waves and he's probably just creating rumors.\" </p><br/><p>\"To the one above, can you bloody get lost?\"</p><br/><p>\"Master Lin is helpless. In front of the mighty, Master Lin can't do anything. But I still admire Master Lin a lot. Nobody dared to repost about it, only Master Lin dared to do so.\"</p><br/><p>Just when everyone was filled with hopelessness, Master Lin's Weibo shocked them again.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan: \"@Jiang Li @Chen Juan, hahahahahahaa\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan: \"@Jiang Li @Chen Juan, f*ck your moms\u2026\" </p><br/><p>Lin Fan: \"@Jiang Li @Chen Juan, why did the old man die naked on the streets? Why did hundreds of donkeys cry out in the middle of the night? Why do condoms cause people to suffer? Why do females lose their panties in hostels? Who was involved in the gang-rape case of a female pig? Who was responsible for the sudden death of hundreds of puppies? Behind all these things, were they caused by fractures in the human soul or differences in moral values? Please stay tuned and look out for Master Lin's annual show, 'The untold secret behind Jiang Li and Chen Juan'. Let us follow the cameras and zoom into the world of these two inhumane beasts so that we can see how these humans became beasts.\"</p><br/><p>...</p><br/>\n</div>"}

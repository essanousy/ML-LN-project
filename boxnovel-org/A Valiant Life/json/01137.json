They really didn\u2019t know how to reply.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you all think about this matter? I\u2019m standing on Master Lin\u2019s side. I\u2019m not afraid of being hit in the face.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c^Your words have touched the bottom of my heart. But the main point is that Master Lin even said that he doesn\u2019t understand, yet he still wants to develop perfect prosthetic limbs. Do you think that\u2019s possible?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t talk to me about all that. I won\u2019t listen. I won\u2019t listen at all. Anyway, I\u2019m convinced. Whether or not it\u2019s possible, I\u2019ll still treat it like it\u2019s possible.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m maintaining neutral this time. I\u2019m not giving any comments.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m still giving Master Lin a thumbs up. I keep feeling this indescribable pain. Let\u2019s trust in Master Lin. If we don\u2019t trust in Master Lin, my face just keeps feeling a little painful as if I\u2019ve been hit in the face.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEnough said. I\u2019ll keep observing the situation. Right now, those specialists are all doubting Master Lin on Weibo. We have to be calm. We mustn\u2019t be reckless.\u201d</p><br/><p>Regarding this incident, the netizens had all been very trusting to Master Lin initially because Master Lin was a miracle-maker to them. However, the current situation made them a little hopeless.</p><br/><p>Even Master Lin had said that he didn\u2019t understand. What were they supposed to say?</p><br/><p>Even some companies which specialized in producing prosthetic limbs had spoken out and expressed their various opinions on this matter. There was a big group of them collectively developing prosthetic limbs. How could it be as simple as what one man said?</p><br/><p>Cloud Street!</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang looked helpless. \u201cBrother Lin, look at the situation now. It looks like no one on Weibo believes you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was very calm. \u201cIf they don\u2019t believe me, so be it. I didn\u2019t ask them to believe me. They can speak as they like.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian pondered for a moment before saying, \u201cIf you ask me, you shouldn\u2019t have said it on Weibo back then. Look at the situation now. If you don\u2019t produce some results, they won\u2019t believe you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled and didn\u2019t bother about it. Regarding the situation on Weibo, he was only just playing with them on purpose. He wanted to get them stirred up first. The spectacular part would come later. What was the rush?</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Boss, it\u2019s time to sell scallion pancakes!\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, the townsfolk had arrived outside. For the scallion pancakes, they would reach on time every day. Regarding the situation on the Internet, they didn\u2019t care at all.</p><br/><p>After eating Master Lin\u2019s scallion pancakes, they had complete faith in Master Lin. It wouldn\u2019t be an exaggeration to call them crazy fans.</p><br/><p>However, they grumbled in their hearts as well. They felt that Little Boss\u2019s boasting was a little too much this time. Although boasting was free, he couldn\u2019t be so unbridled.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m coming, I\u2019m coming.\u201d Lin Fan tidied up and put on his apron. He had started from scratch by relying on scallion pancakes and he had sold scallion pancakes here for so long. It still felt great.</p><br/><p>A middle-aged man who had received a number tag asked curiously, \u201cLittle Boss, if you only sell ten servings a day, do you earn enough money?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan\u2019s actions didn\u2019t stop as he smiled and said, \u201cI don\u2019t. It\u2019s not even enough to cover my costs.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought. Ten servings a day only gives you five hundred dollars. Even if you add fortune-telling on top of that, it wouldn\u2019t be enough. If you sell a hundred servings a day, you would definitely make a fortune,\u201d said the middle-aged man.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I had Little Boss\u2019s skills, I would go all out and sell as much as I could every day.\u201d</p><br/><p>A woman behind felt that this man wasn\u2019t right. She rebutted, \u201cWhat you said isn\u2019t right. If Little Boss wanted to earn money, he wouldn\u2019t sell scallion pancakes. Look at Little Boss\u2019s fame. Even if he just does advertisements on Weibo, who knows how much he would earn in a month?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. \u201cIf you sell that much every day, would you find any joy in life?\u201d</p><br/><p>The middle-aged man laughed. \u201cIsn\u2019t earning money the joy in life?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t feel that way. Life\u2019s joy is in experiencing life. I really enjoy selling ten servings of scallion pancakes a day but I also enjoy doing other things. That\u2019s why you can\u2019t just think about earning money. You have to think about other interesting things too.\u201d</p><br/><p>The middle-aged man had wanted to say more but he decided to forget about it.</p><br/><p>This wasn\u2019t what he thought. He felt that this was a waste. If he was able to make such delicious scallion pancakes, he would sell them maniacally every day. Then, he would expand his shop and even have manufacturers to help him earn a big sum of money.</p><br/><p>The townsfolk behind were chattering.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe just hope that Little Boss will keep selling ten servings a day. Coming here every day to queue up is a joyful thing too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. What\u2019s the point of making Little Boss so tired? Little Boss has other things to do. He even has to take care of things at the welfare institute.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy luck today is pretty good. I managed to have my number selected. This is the first time in half a month. I even sent pictures to my friends. It\u2019s as if I\u2019ve won the lottery. My mood has been lifted up for the whole day.\u201d</p><br/><p>Initially, these townsfolk hadn\u2019t been able to accept just having ten servings a day. But now, they had all accepted it. And it felt pretty good too.</p><br/><p>Coming every day, queuing up, and chatting with their neighbors. It was a pretty good choice.</p><br/><p>When else would they have a moment to relax like this in their busy schedules?</p><br/><p>The scallion pancakes came out of the wok one by one.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, aren\u2019t you a reseller? You\u2019ve been selected?\u201d Lin Fan looked at the man in front of him and started laughing. \u201cYour luck today is great!\u201d</p><br/><p>The reseller smiled. \u201cMaster Lin, this is to make a living. I try my luck every day. I didn\u2019t expect my luck to be so good today.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t go and get a queue number at the hospital too, did you?\u201d Lin Fan asked jokingly.</p><br/><p>When the reseller heard that, he immediately waved his hand. \u201cNo. I\u2019d never do such immoral things. I only go and buy concert tickets and Little Boss\u2019s scallion pancakes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled as he swiftly prepared another serving of scallion pancake and passed it to the reseller. At the same time, he received fifty-dollars from the reseller.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour scallion pancake is done.\u201d</p><br/><p>The reseller took the scallion pancake. He was thrilled as he shouted, \u201cDon\u2019t miss out on this opportunity! Little Boss\u2019s scallion pancakes, one whiff for ten dollars! It will only be around for ten minutes. Afterward, I will deliver it to the buyer.\u201d</p><br/><p>Some of the people who hadn\u2019t managed to buy the scallion pancakes really missed the scallion pancakes.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m coming.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to spend ten dollars for a whiff too.\u201d</p><br/><p>With those shouts, the reseller had drawn numerous people.</p><br/><p>The middle-aged man, who was at the side nibbling at his scallion pancake, let out a look of enjoyment. He said, \u201cLittle Boss, look. This guy is better at doing business than you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. \u201cThat\u2019s because he needs to make a living. He isn\u2019t doing any immoral activities, so I\u2019m happy to sell my scallion pancakes to him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Boss, how are you able to tell?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan pointed at his own eyes. \u201cI can see through him with one look. Do you believe me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha!\u201d The man burst into laughter as he nodded. \u201cI believe you. Whatever Little Boss says, I\u2019ll believe.\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

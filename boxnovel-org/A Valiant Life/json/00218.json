Just stop talking.\" Wu Yun Gang felt that the situation was getting a little tense. He thought that things shouldn't have to end up so awkward since everyone was friends. He regretted bringing Brother Sun to Shanghai since he knew that Wang Ming Yang didn't like him. He should've known that bringing him would cause problems.</p><br/><p>\"Just be frank and speak your mind, Master Lin, go ahead. I, Sun Lian Ming, will definitely be able to handle it,\" Sun Lian Ming said. It seemed as if he wasn't bothered by what was going on. He was still a little doubtful of Lin Fan's fortune-telling abilities. As for Wu Yun Gang's case, he felt that it was a case of luck.</p><br/><p>If he really was that good, wouldn't he be a God? Why would he still be in such a small shop? He would definitely be a famous VIP and receive privileged treatment. A wealthy man like himself would be considered a small fry to him. Of course, he must be really capable in order to reach that level. But from the looks of it, for him to still be in a small shop like this, it showed that he wasn't that capable.</p><br/><p>This was how Sun Lian Ming viewed it. He thought that everyone had the same thinking as him, which was to pursue fame and wealth.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang glanced at Sun Lian Ming. He trusted Lin Fan and since Lin Fan had already put it that way, it showed that this man wasn't a good person after all. Lin Fan had wanted to save him some face and not say it but now that Sun Lian Ming was still demanding for his fortune to be read, it showed how shameless he was.</p><br/><p>If Lin Fan said that Sun Lian Ming would be badly beaten up later, Wang Ming Yang would definitely believe him. After all, he trusted Lin Fan a lot.</p><br/><p>The trust had been gained from countless incidents. It couldn't be gained from just a one-time event.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at Wu Tian He. \"Look at him, what do you think of his destiny?\"</p><br/><p>Sun Lian Ming chuckled, \"Master Lin, I'm asking for you to read my fortune. Why did you ask him?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan just ignored him as he waited for Wu Tian He to reply.</p><br/><p>Wu Tian He looked at Sun Lian Ming closely. He wasn't afraid of offending people. After all, Wu Tian He was a powerful man. If he was still his old self that pursued fame and power, perhaps even the three of them couldn't match up to his standards.</p><br/><p>\"From just his appearance, it doesn't seem good. There will be changes to his wealth. This is just a superficial analysis. I have to analyze it further,\" Wu Tian He said.</p><br/><p>When Sun Lian Ming heard it, he laughed, \"I'm afraid this old man here doesn't know who I am, right? You can just search my name up on the Internet. Although I'm not considered an extremely wealthy man, I still have some power in Beijing. My net worth is more than ten billion. How could my wealth be plummeting?\"</p><br/><p>Although his words weren't offensive, he sounded unhappy. It was as if he was saying that Wu Tian He was speaking blindly. It sounded as if he was trying to insult him.</p><br/><p>Wu Tian He didn't say much. He looked at Lin Fan and said, \"Master Lin, I'll let you do it. I can't read as much as you just from one's appearance.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled and nodded. Then, he took a sip of his tea and looked at Sun Lian Ming. \"Since you want to know it so badly, I'll say it. After all, if you listen to it, you'll be able to change your life. If not, that'll be your fate.\"</p><br/><p>Sun Lian Ming chuckled. Lin Fan spoke as if everything would come true. Sun Lian Ming was ready to let him continue bragging about his abilities. He had been through tough times and he wasn't going to be affected by just a few sentences.</p><br/><p>If things were really true, then life would be meaningless for him.</p><br/><p>\"Master Lin, please go ahead. As long as you're accurate, I, Sun Lian Ming, will definitely listen to you,\" Sun Lian Ming said.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was laughing in his heart. It would be a miracle for him to listen to his words. He didn't like this person at all. Then, he started to speak, \"Your life is considered to be pretty good. Now that you have such fame and power, it has something to do with the important person in the first half of your life. But it's a pity that\u2026\"</p><br/><p>When Sun Lian Ming heard that, he chuckled, \"What do you mean by 'important person'? I've been depending on myself all my life. It's a pity that...? Master Lin, please finish your sentence.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled and continued, \"It's a pity that you're an obstinate person. You're not willing to listen to those that have differing opinions. Furthermore, you're a two-faced backstabber. You don't hold your friends' opinions in high regard and you only care about your own benefits even if it's at the expense of your friends. The only important person you'll have in your life is your ex-wife. She deserves half the credit for your accomplishment today. However, you don't care about her anymore despite her having gone through the tough times with you\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan spoke fluently and Sun Lian Ming's expression changed. He looked upset and felt that Master Lin was humiliating him.</p><br/><p>I don't hold my friends' opinions in high regard? I only care about my own benefits even if it is at the expense of my friends? What does he mean by that?</p><br/><p>Is he trying to sow discord?</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang laughed, he knew that Sun Lian Ming wasn't good. He was like a time-bomb for Wu Yun Gang. Sun Lian Ming was a ruthless man. Most people who did business with him suffered horrific fates.</p><br/><p>If they didn't get kicked out halfway, the project would fail. Sun Lian Ming would destroy his partner's reputation and wealth just to minimize his losses. On the surface, it seemed like he was being a kind man but he always looked for ways to protect himself only.</p><br/><p>When Wu Yun Gang heard Master Lin's words, he was stunned. He hadn't expected Master Lin's judgment of his friend to turn out like that. It was nothing like what he had expected.</p><br/><p>\"Master Lin, did you exaggerate things?\" Wu Yun Gang asked awkwardly. After all, Sun Lian Ming was his friend. Now that Master Lin said something like that to him, he didn't know how to resolve the situation.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at how unhappy Sun Lian Ming was but he wasn't bothered by it. After all, it was requested by him. He had to speak the truth. But since he had spoken the truth, Sun Lian Ming was unhappy. Sometimes, it was difficult to please wealthy men like him. Then, he smiled at Wu Yun Gang. \"Your fate has gone through a major change from the previous time I looked at you. Previously, you were destined to go through trials even though you were fated for wealth and fame. However, things look better for you now. Your life will be steady and you will be wealthy and powerful. But you must still be cautious. Good friends will help to bring you good luck but if you hang out with the wrong company, things will change again. As for the current situation, things are looking good for you. Just continue hustling and do not look down on others. Continue with your slow and steady progress and you will be wealthy for the rest of your life.\"</p><br/><p>When Wu Yun Gang heard what Master Lin said, he just nodded. In the past, he hadn't believed in fortune-telling but now, he believed in it. He only believed in Master Lin, not anyone else.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang patted Wu Yun Gang on his shoulder, \"Since Master Lin has already said it, it is definitely accurate. In the future, just listen to my brother. Good friends will bring you good fortune while bad company will destroy you.\"</p><br/><p>Wu Yun Gang knew who Brother Wang was referring to and he looked a little awkward. After all, Brother Sun was his friend. He really didn't know what to say.</p><br/><p>Then, Lin Fan looked at Sun Lian Ming again. If he didn't destroy him with his words today, he wouldn't be called Master Lin.</p><br/><p>But if Sun Lian Ming was willing to take his words positively and make a change, he could still change his fate. As the saying goes, one can learn a lot about someone's heart just by looking at his appearance.</p><br/><p>Of course, appearance didn't just mean physical appearance. It also referred to his spiritual and physical well-being on a whole.</p><br/><p>An example would be Wang Shen. He looked like a sensible man. If Lin Fan hadn't looked at him closely, he would definitely not have noticed that Wang Shen was a human trafficker.</p><br/><p>Then, Lin Fan chuckled, \"Chief Sun, you have to be calm and less hot-tempered. Sometimes, the truth hurts but it can also do you good. It just depends on how you view things.\"</p><br/><p>Sun Lian Ming sneered. He couldn't hide his emotions any further.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

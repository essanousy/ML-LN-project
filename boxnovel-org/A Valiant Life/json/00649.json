These are tigers, man!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, quick, take a picture. This is terrifying.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s with these five tigers? Why are they lying down? They\u2019re not even moving!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t this the tiger king of our zoo? Why did it become so calm?\u201d</p><br/><p>The tourists were talking among themselves and they didn\u2019t know what to say. This was totally unexpected.</p><br/><p>The zoo-keepers were also dumbfounded. They\u2019ve been working there for many years but they\u2019ve never seen such an occurrence before.</p><br/><p>Although these tigers were raised in captivity, they knew that these tigers were ruthless and they\u2019ve never dared to go close to them.</p><br/><p>Zhu Shou Jun collapsed to the ground after seeing that the tigers were defeated. He started sobbing uncontrollably. He felt as if he had been saved from the God of Death. He swore to never be a Scrooge anymore.</p><br/><p>He almost lost his life for such a small amount of money. It was pathetic.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan clapped with satisfaction. One of the tigers didn\u2019t know how to behave itself. He actually saved his life and he still acted wildly. However, his behavior had improved.</p><br/><p>*clap*</p><br/><p>Then, there was a thunderous applause. The tourists on the platform looked at Lin Fan in awe. They felt that it was literally law-defying.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan heaved a sigh of relief. At the same time, she looked at Lin Fan in awe too. That was the Brother Lin of her dreams. He was awesome.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou Lan, do you want to come down? I\u2019ll let you ride the tigers.\u201d Initially, Lin Fan wanted to return to the platform. However, since he was already at the tiger\u2019s den, he felt that You Lan should experience tiger riding as it was a once in a lifetime experience.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Wu You Lan was stunned. She was frightened. \u201cBrother Lin, I\u2019m scared.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled, \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid, I\u2019m here. What can possibly happen to you? Come, jump down. I\u2019ll catch you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan looked down and realized the platform was really high.</p><br/><p>However, she trusted Lin Fan a lot. Then, she said without hesitation, \u201cYou have to catch me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, she jumped down.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan stretched out his hand and caught Wu You Lan. Then, he smiled, \u201cHow was it? That was exciting, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan nodded. However, she felt that Brother Lin\u2019s hands were at places that he shouldn\u2019t be touching. She blushed and nodded, \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled but he realized that his hands were in the wrong positions. He immediately placed Wu You Lan down and said, \u201cSorry, I didn\u2019t do that on purpose.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan\u2019s face turned even redder as Lin Fan said it so directly. \u201cBrother Lin, how can you say that?\u201d</p><br/><p>He took advantage of her and still pretended he didn\u2019t do it. That was infuriating.</p><br/><p>The visitors on the platform were stunned again.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, she just jumped down like that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat was horrifying.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThose are tigers! They\u2019re inhumane beasts. If they were to turn around and bite them, they\u2019d be doomed.\u201d</p><br/><p>The zookeepers were speechless. What else could they have said? Another tourist jumped down and they didn\u2019t manage to stop her. If something were t happen, they\u2019d face unimaginable consequences.</p><br/><p>Zhu Shou Jun had already been saved. However, he stuck himself to the wall as he looked at the five tigers. He didn\u2019t dare to move as he was afraid that the tigers would strike at him when they realized that he was moving.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan held Wu You Lan\u2019s smooth and slender hand, \u201cLet\u2019s try riding the tigers. You\u2019ve never felt it before, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan looked at the five tigers in fear. \u201cBrother Lin, are we really going to ride the tigers? Will something go wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019m here. What could happen? Since we\u2019re already at the zoo, let\u2019s try riding the tigers. If not, we\u2019d be wasting our entrance fees. Don\u2019t you think so?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan was stunned by Lin Fan. She didn\u2019t even know how to answer his question. The thought of riding tigers in the zoo was terrifying.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you not trust me?\u201d Lin Fan smiled and asked.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan shook her head immediately, \u201cNo, no, why wouldn\u2019t I trust you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d Lin Fan chuckled. Then, he pointed at a tiger, \u201cIt\u2019s you then. Come here now.\u201d</p><br/><p>One of the tigers looked at Lin Fan who just called it. Its head moved in fear. Then, it looked around and realized that Lin Fan was calling it.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, you. Stop turning your head and come here now,\u201d Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>*cries*</p><br/><p>The tiger that got called upon whimpered in fear.</p><br/><p>However, the others felt that the tiger was going to go crazy.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan was dumbfounded when she saw the tiger moving towards them. She leaned towards Lin Fan in fear. It was normal for a girl like her to be afraid of these things.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be afraid. I\u2019ve reprimanded these tigers. They\u2019re as obedient as kittens now,\u201d Lin Fan consoled her and Wu You Lan nodded. When the tiger came before them, she bent down slightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cGo, have a seat. Let\u2019s get the tiger to bring us around in here,\u201d Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2026 if I didn\u2019t see this with my own eyes, I\u2019d never have believed this is possible.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m totally in awe this time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan was nervous about riding a tiger for the first time. However, when Lin Fan climbed onto the tiger behind her, she wasn\u2019t nervous anymore.</p><br/><p>\u201cHold onto its fur,\u201d Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan nodded and her curiosity soon overcame her fear. She was filled with surprise, \u201cBrother Lin, tigers really don\u2019t bite people at all.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled, \u201cIt\u2019s not that they don\u2019t bite. It just doesn\u2019t dare to bite.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re asking why? That\u2019s obviously because I\u2019m here. Even if I gave him twenty tiger guts, he wouldn\u2019t dare to bite us.\u201d Then, Lin Fan hugged Wu You Lan\u2019s waist and said, \u201cLittle Tiger, let\u2019s go one round around this place.\u201d</p><br/><p>The tiger whimpered and started to move after hearing Lin Fan\u2019s command.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan was ecstatic and her face turned red. It was her first time experiencing it.</p><br/><p>It was an unforgettable experience for her as she would never forget riding a tiger with Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>The tourists on the platform were dumbfounded. They didn\u2019t expect them to really ride the tiger. The tiger was really obedient and didn\u2019t cause any trouble.</p><br/><p>You\u2019re the king of all beasts and you\u2019re being ridden on by humans. That\u2019s utter disrespect.</p><br/><p>Then, the zoo workers came over with the anesthetic gun, \u201cMove aside, move aside\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>However, when they managed to squeeze through the crowd, they were stunned by what they saw.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d</p><br/><p>Didn\u2019t they say that a tiger bit someone? Where\u2019s the person that got \u2018bitten\u2019?</p><br/><p>Why were they looking at two people riding a tiger? The tiger looked like it was being commanded. That\u2019s not logical at all.</p></div>\n</div>"}

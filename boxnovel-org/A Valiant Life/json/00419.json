You can do your own things.\u201d</p><br/><p>The situation had become slightly complicated. They knew that Elder Zhao would not forgive them easily.</p><br/><p>In the study room, Zhao Ming Qing was holding and reading a notebook. Beside him, there was also a book which recorded his thoughts and opinions.</p><br/><p>Elder Mu sat at the side, drinking his tea with a face full of smiles. This matter did not concern him as he was not a Chinese Medical Association member. Therefore, he could not help much in this matter.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Zhao, we are here.\u201d Zhou Qing Quan saw Elder Zhao reading his book but Elder Zhao did not seem to notice them.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing acted as if he did not see them at all. He looked down and continued looking at his book.</p><br/><p>Zhou Qing Quan looked at the others and felt helpless. This Elder Zhao really took it to heart. The people behind walked up and stood in front of Elder Zhao but Elder Zhao still acted as if nothing had happened.</p><br/><p><em>Flip!</em></p><br/><p>The soft flipping sounds of the book were amplified in the quiet study room. Elder Zhao continued staring at the contents of his book, not raising his head. He acted as if the others were not present.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Zhao\u2026why are you not talking?\u201d Zhou Qing Quan softly asked. He became slightly impatient and commented, \u201cWhat are you looking at? Is it that interesting?\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Mu looked at this situation and smiled internally. This Elder Zhao really had a temper. However, it made sense. He knew the amount of stress Elder Zhao had been under these few days even though he had not experienced it himself.</p><br/><p>The internet had had such a huge commotion and the comments left behind were so nasty.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Elder Mu realized that the situation had become different. Zhou Qing Quan and the rest stood behind Elder Zhao and did not dare to move. They all stared at Elder Zhao\u2019s book and did not recover from their daze for a long time.</p><br/><p>\u2018Shortage of Yin and Abnormal Pulse Disease.\u2019</p><br/><p>Zhou Qing Quan and the rest looked closely at the contents. The contents were easy to understand. Those who had studied Chinese Medicine before would understand. The issues were described clearly and all possible situations were also depicted.</p><br/><p>This book seemed to be unfamiliar, and it looked as if it was handwritten.</p><br/><p>Huh?</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Zhou Qing Quan gasped and saw that there was a medical solution to the disease written behind. However, when Zhou Qing Quan wanted to take a closer look, the book was suddenly closed.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing raised his head, \u201cWhat are you guys doing here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Zhao, let me see it again. Don\u2019t close it so hurriedly,\u201d Zhou Qing Quan immediately asked. It was his first time seeing such a book and he was instantly attracted to it.</p><br/><p>There were also some theories in it that he had not seen or known of before. It was as if he had been learning something new but only got to understand the front. And when it reached the climax, someone blocked it.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you looking at? This is a book with important theories on diseases. You cannot look at it,\u201d Zhao Ming Qing said.</p><br/><p>Wang Tian Fen had not seen as much as Zhou Qing Quan and did not care much about it. He smiled and said, \u201cElder Zhao, we called you but you did not answer.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI did not want to answer. Being alone in a battle is tiring.\u201d Zhao Ming Qing sighed.</p><br/><p>Everyone understood what he was talking about.</p><br/><p>Zhou Qing Quan had been completely sucked in by the contents of the book and asked, \u201cElder Zhao, we have known each other for several decades. Can you tell me what kind of book that is?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing smiled. \u201cYou can never find it elsewhere because there is only one such book in the world.\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Mu sat there at smiled. He knew that Elder Zhao was doing this on purpose and he knew that Elder Zhou liked to read ancient books while seeking new knowledge. What Elder Zhao had done just now by turning his back was to purposely let Zhou Qing Quan have a peek at the book he was reading.</p><br/><p>Once Zhou Qing Quan had seen that book, Elder Zhao would close the book and make him be attracted to it but not be able to see it.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy do you guys come to look for me now? There\u2019s nothing else to do in Beijing?\u201d Zhao Ming Qing asked.</p><br/><p>Zhou Qing Quan immediately said, \u201cElder Zhao, that matter is different. The previous issue was our fault and what I want to know is whether you can lend me that book. Whatever requests you have, I will help you if it\u2019s within my means.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou want to look at it?\u201d Zhao Ming Qian smiled.</p><br/><p>Zhou Qing Quan nodded. \u201cElder Zhao, isn\u2019t that obvious? If I did not want to look, would I ask so much about it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t read it now and you won\u2019t be able to read it too because my teacher gave it to me. This is his medical experience. If this was in the past, it would have been a treasured book. Also, there are many other things in this book. I read it for a few days and still have not finished it. It contains not only the description of various medical conditions but also the medicine to administer. The instructions are also very clear. In these few days, I\u2019ve learned a lot.\u201d Zhao Ming Qing sighed. He already said that Zhou Qing Quan couldn\u2019t read it but still continued praising the book. He was causing Zhou Qing Quan\u2019s heart to itch with desire.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Zhao, you are so cruel. We have had several decades of friendship but you won\u2019t even help me with such a simple request?\u2019 Zhou Qing Quan pestered Elder Zhao, making him frustrated.</p><br/><p>Wang Tian Feng and the rest were also surprised. What had happened to Elder Zhou? They had come here to discuss with Elder Zhao, yet they were talking about something else instead.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing waved his hand and said, \u201cElder Zhou, I\u2019m not cruel. These are the rules. My teacher gave it to me, without his permission, I cannot allow you to read it. Also, I am not angry about that matter, I am not that petty.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Qing Quan said anxiously, \u201cElder Zhao, then call your teacher and let me ask him personally. If I ask him personally, your teacher will agree. If you do not call now, it means you are doing this on purpose. Our decades of friendship will end here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing looked at Zhou Qing Quan and shook his head helplessly. He took out his phone and dialed a number. \u201cMy teacher, Master Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Qing Quan nodded and took over the phone. At this moment, the call went through and he anxiously asked, \u201cIs this Master Lin? This is Zhou Qing Quan, the director of the Chinese Medical Association. I am Zhao Ming Qing\u2019s good friend. I would like to request to see the book that you gave to him. I would be eternally grateful.\u201d</p><br/><p>There was no response and Zhou Qing Quan asked softly, \u201cMaster Lin, are you there?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan asked, \u201cDo I know you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Qing Quan was shocked. \u201cMaster Lin, you do not know me but I am very familiar with Elder Zhao.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan asked, \u201cThe sentence you said earlier, how did you arrive at that conclusion?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Qing Quan could not understand what he was talking about and asked, \u201cAre you Master Lin?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry, you called the wrong number.\u201d</p><br/><p><em>Click!</em></p><br/><p>The call was hung up.</p><br/><p>Zhou Qing Quan was dumbfounded. \u201cElder Zhao\u2026this\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing hid his laughter and said, \u201cI do not know either, maybe I really called the wrong person. Let\u2019s not talk about this first. What exactly are you all here for?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Qing Quan knew that what he did was on purpose. \u201cInitially, there was nothing but there\u2019s something now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d Zhao Ming Qing was puzzled. Why would there be something now?</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Zhao, I want to see your teacher,\u201d Zhou Qing Quan said seriously.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing was shocked. Then, he laughed</p><br/><p>You want to see my teacher? That\u2019s a very difficult thing.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

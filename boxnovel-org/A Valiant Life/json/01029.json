He was filled with gratitude. He hadn\u2019t expected Master Lin to really come.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at this middle-aged man in front of him and was a little dazed. This Mayor Niu gave off the feeling of a simple farmer. He didn\u2019t seem like a modern person who would follow celebrities. Then, Lin Fan said softly, \u201cMayor Niu, are you really my fan?\u201d</p><br/><p>Niu Da Ming was a little embarrassed but he nodded. \u201cYes, yes. I, Niu Da Ming, am your fan.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMayor Niu, I can tell from your eyes that you\u2019re lying,\u201d Lin Fan said with a smile. But regardless, it didn\u2019t matter. Actually, he wouldn\u2019t have sat idly by if he had known the severity of this situation.</p><br/><p>Niu Da Ming had not expected Master Lin to see through him. He shamefully scratched his head as he said, \u201cMaster Lin, I\u2019m really sorry. I\u2019m actually a fake fan. I\u2019ve seen Weibo and I know that you are an amazing person. As Huang Yun Town\u2019s Mayor, I pretend to be a fan of amazing people sometimes so that if a problem arises, I\u2019d be able to request help.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat day, I called you because I had no other choice. I couldn\u2019t watch my people continue getting tortured by the illness\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, alright. That\u2019s enough, Mayor Niu. You can become my fan from now on then. Next time, if I argue with someone on Weibo, you have to remember what happened here today and help me to scold the opposition,\u201d said Lin Fan with a laugh.</p><br/><p>After all, there were sure to be many flame wars in the future. If he had more fans, he would have a greater chance of winning these flame wars.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. Of course. From now on, you\u2019re my savior,\u201d said Niu Da Ming.</p><br/><p>The influenza had finally been conquered now. The townspeople\u2019s health was not an issue anymore.</p><br/><p>Li Chong had been watching from the side the whole time. At this moment, he grabbed Lin Fan\u2019s hand and said, \u201cMaster Lin, I thank you on behalf of all the county\u2019s citizens. If it wasn\u2019t for you, who knows when the influenza would\u2019ve been conquered? And I don\u2019t know if those townspeople would have been able to make it through.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re too courteous.\u201d Lin Fan smiled. He had already received many words of thanks. He had had a pretty good rest the previous night as well, so he was very energetic.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, right. I think this matter has had a large impact on the Internet. I\u2019m going to send a Weibo post now to explain things to the public,\u201d said Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Actually, he felt as if his own Weibo post was more convincing than a Weibo post sent by government units.</p><br/><p>When he brought that up, Li Chong thought about something as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter this incident, I have to go to the city\u2019s pharmacies to punish them. They actually raised the prices of medicine and some of them obviously raised it on purpose.\u201d</p><br/><p>After the incident when purchasing medicine the previous day, Zhao Ming Qing felt that this problem was rather severe as well. Normal citizens wouldn\u2019t know the full situation but after the scare on the Internet, they were sure to make decisions for their own safety.</p><br/><p>This allowed the distributors to take advantage of the situation by inflating the price of the medicine and earning a huge profit.</p><br/><p>This indeed needed to be rectified. And it had to be done harshly. That was the only way to let those people know the severity of the situation.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan opened his Weibo without hesitation. After putting together his thoughts, he started to type on the screen.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Huang Yun Town influenza has been conquered by me, so I\u2019m naming it \u2018One-hour influenza\u2019. It has already been resolved completely, so the public doesn\u2019t have to worry anymore. After today, the problem here in Huang Yun Town is over. As for those medications promoted by pharmacies, they are completely useless. Don\u2019t buy them.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was very simple. And he had named the influenza. No matter what, he was the one who conquered the influenza, so he had the right to name it.</p><br/><p>When this post was uploaded, the comments section instantly blew up.</p><br/><p>\u201c????\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI f*cking spent hundreds of dollars on the medications. You\u2019re telling me now that you\u2019ve conquered it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck. Thankfully, I took a look at Weibo before buying the medicine. I would\u2019ve wasted my money otherwise. Do you know how expensive it is?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell done, Master Lin. These evil businessmen are destined for disaster once they meet Master Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat scared the heck out of me. But Master Lin is amazing. As long as you intervene, there is nothing that cannot be resolved.\u201d</p><br/><p>In a certain city.</p><br/><p>There was a huge crowd queuing at the entrance of a pharmacy. These people were all here to purchase medicine. The danger of the influenza had made them all frightened, so they were here to buy medicine for the safety of themselves and their family members regardless of the costs.</p><br/><p>\u201cThose in front, please buy less. Leave some for us.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah! There\u2019s no point buying so much. I need some for my family too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSigh, how can this influenza pop up all of a sudden. Is it trying to kill us?\u201d</p><br/><p>When the pharmacy owner saw this situation, he felt amazing. <em>I\u2019m going to be rich. I\u2019m really going to be f*cking rich.</em></p><br/><p>If he sells all those medications, his wallet would be bursting.</p><br/><p>Thinking about those bosses in the chat group who had hyped things up to inflate the prices, he was really in admiration. He had really benefited thanks to them this time. Then, he happily opened his Weibo and sent a red packet.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not much but I hope everyone will be happy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Once the red packet was sent, it got snatched up in an instant.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, looks like Elder He is happily earning money.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow can he not be happy? He managed to catch this great opportunity. But don\u2019t sell all the medicine. Leave some for later. When that time comes, we will really earn lots of money. This is just a little teaser.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks for the advice, Boss. Don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ve basically kept all of my medicine for later on.\u201d</p><br/><p>Just as he was chatting cheerily in the group, a voice broke through his excitement.</p><br/><p>In the crowd, a young man looked at his phone and suddenly yelled.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck! What are we still buying this for? Master Lin has already conquered the influenza and he even said that the medications being promoted are completely useless against it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? The influenza has been conquered?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, that\u2019s amazing. Master Lin\u2019s medical abilities are too strong. He conquered the influenza just like that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, I\u2019m going home to go on the Internet. This gave me a scare but if it has been conquered, I don\u2019t need any medicine anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis pharmacy is really evil. I\u2019ll never buy medicine from here again.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMe too. They took this opportunity to take our hard-earned money.\u201d</p><br/><p>Soon, the crowd dispersed all of a sudden. And as they left, they kept cursing this pharmacy. They really looked down on such behavior.</p><br/><p>When the pharmacy owner saw this, he didn\u2019t know what to say.</p><br/><p>And when he picked up his phone as he wanted to tell the people in the group about it, he realized that the group was filled with mournful cries and everyone was talking about this.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck! This f*cking Master Lin doesn\u2019t want to let us live.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI hoarded so much stock, how am I going to sell it?\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

How could I have known beforehand?\u201d</p><br/><p>Sister Hong nodded, \u201cThat\u2019s true, you did come with us and you couldn\u2019t have known. But how did you know just by feeling his pulse?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you all already? My medical abilities are great. It\u2019s a shame you all don\u2019t believe me.\u201d Lin Fan felt very helpless. At times like these, when he wasn\u2019t even trying to hide his abilities, people didn\u2019t believe him. On the other hand, when he did want to hide his abilities, people always seemed to find out the truth.</p><br/><p>This really made his very frustrated sometimes.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh right, it\u2019s almost the twenty-second day of the month. We\u2019ll be going to Nanshan Children\u2019s Welfare Institute then. Don\u2019t be shocked when that time comes,\u201d said Lin Fan with a grin.</p><br/><p>The crowd was puzzled, \u201cWhy would we be shocked? Could it be that something has changed?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed mysteriously. He wouldn\u2019t reveal the truth. To them, the truth would have been too shocking.</p><br/><p>According to Lin Fan\u2019s plan, he would bring Zhao Ming Qing out after the twenty-second. After all, he couldn\u2019t miss this monthly affair. After experiencing it twice, it had probably become the most anticipated event for the children. If Lin Fan didn\u2019t go, they would be very disappointed.</p><br/><p>*ring ring*</p><br/><p>At that moment, Zhao Ming Qing\u2019s call came.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan answered.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, do you still remember what I talked to you about the last time?\u201d Zhao Ming Qing asked softly through the phone.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Lin Fan was taken aback. He couldn\u2019t recall what it was and had no idea what Ming Qing was talking about.</p><br/><p>\u201cThose old friends of mine have been staying here for a period of time, wanting to meet you once,\u201d said Zhao Ming Qing. Zhou Qing Quan and Wang Tian Feng had already stayed in Shanghai for a while. When his teacher returned, Zhao Ming Qing didn\u2019t call him at once because he wanted to let his teacher have a good rest. Now that a few days had passed, he took the initiative to call so he could ask about it. If his teacher didn\u2019t want to meet them, he wouldn\u2019t have any qualms about it too.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan thought for a moment. While he had been in Beijing, the Chinese Medical Association had sent people over. No matter what, it was still a favor for him. Since this was the case, it would be best for him to go and meet them.</p><br/><p>\u201cOn the twenty-second, let\u2019s meet at the Nanshan Children\u2019s Welfare Institute,\u201d said Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>During this time, he had to have a proper rest and also teach the children to draw every day so that the children would be able to go into the profession as soon as possible. Although some of the children had a better understanding and had already earned Lin Fan some Encyclopedic Points, most of the children didn\u2019t understand it yet.</p><br/><p>After hanging up.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing looked at the old friends beside him and said, \u201cYou heard it yourselves, right? On the twenty-second, at Nanshan Children\u2019s Welfare Institute.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Qing Quan started smiling brightly. \u201cThis is meaningful, Elder Zhao.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing said helplessly, \u201cI have no idea what you all are trying to do.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Qing Quan said with a grin, \u201cElder Zhao, let\u2019s discuss something. That \u2018Various Types of Typhoid\u2019 of yours, shouldn\u2019t you let us study it a little?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t even think about it. Unless my teacher says so, I won\u2019t let you see it,\u201d said Zhao Ming Qing.</p><br/><p>Ever since reading \u2018Various Types of Typhoid\u2019, Zhao Ming Qing\u2019s medical abilities had been raised significantly. In Chinese medicine, one cannot just blindly memorize things, instead, one must be able to infer multiple things from a single case. The medications used in Chinese medicine have fixed effects but when combined in different ways, they produce different effects.</p><br/><p>Also, when Zhao Ming Qing was faced with something he didn\u2019t understand, he could ask his teacher. It was very rewarding.</p><br/><p>Now that Zhou Qing Quan wanted to meet his teacher, how could Zhao Ming Qing not know his intentions? It was clear that Zhou Qing Quan wanted to learn from his teacher as well. Even if Zhou Qing Quan wasn\u2019t thinking of becoming a disciple of his teacher, he was definitely thinking of obtaining \u2018Various Types of Typhoid\u2019.</p><br/><p>Sigh\u2026</p><br/><p>Zhou Ming Qing decided not to think too much. The more he thought the more depressed he felt.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher is mine, not yours!\u201d he thought to himself.</p><br/><p>A few days later.</p><br/><p>The monthly event was here.</p><br/><p>This was a special day for Cloud Street and everyone had been eagerly anticipating it.</p><br/><p>The previous times, they had bought many things so this time, they didn\u2019t buy much. They just bought some snacks. But even so, it was a large number of snacks when they added them up.</p><br/><p>Participating in this event wasn\u2019t about spending money. It was about having fun with the children. And the most important thing was to taste Little Boss\u2019 dishes.</p><br/><p>Little Boss\u2019 dishes had a special place deep in their hearts. They could only eat his dishes twelve times a year and they treasured the opportunity very much.</p><br/><p>At that moment, at Cloud Street. Multiple cars were parked on the road.</p><br/><p>When the surrounding townsfolk saw this scene, they couldn\u2019t help but be surprised.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is going on?\u201d</p><br/><p>The people who asked questions like these were all townsfolk who had just come to Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>A familiar townsfolk said, \u201cThis is a monthly activity for Cloud Street, where they go to the Children\u2019s Welfare Institute to help out. On this day, all the shops are closed. Are you an outsider? If you\u2019re here to shop today, then you would have wasted your time.\u201d</p><br/><p>The outsider asked in a surprised tone, \u201cThere\u2019s actually an activity like this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. It has already happened for a few times.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Boss, let\u2019s move out,\u201d yelled Elder Zhang.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan saw that it was about time and replied, \u201cAlright, move out.\u201d</p><br/><p>The cars slowly moved one after another out of Cloud Street and towards Nanshan Children\u2019s Welfare Institute.</p><br/><p>Nanshan Children\u2019s Welfare Institute.</p><br/><p>Director Huang and Han Lu knew that it was the twenty-second. Originally, they had wanted to call the children out to welcome everyone but they never thought that the children were even more excited than them. They had woken up early in the morning in anticipation. Each of them had climbed onto the railings and were gazing afar as if waiting for something.</p><br/><p>At that moment, a car appeared at the entrance of Nanshan Children\u2019s Welfare Institute.</p><br/><p>When the children saw this car, their eyes gleamed with excitement.</p><br/><p>When they saw someone get off the car, some of the children started shouting.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the old grandpa from the other day\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing had brought Zhou Qing Quan and Wang Tian Feng here. When Zhou Qing Quan saw this scene, he asked, \u201cElder Zhao, what is this place?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is Nanshan Children\u2019s Welfare Institute. My teacher comes here on the twenty-second of each month,\u201d said Zhao Ming Qing.</p><br/><p>As the Vice-President of the Association, Wang Tian Feng was very excited, \u201cIn a while, we\u2019ll be able to meet Elder Zhao\u2019s teacher. This is really exciting!\u201d</p><br/><p>They had no doubts about Elder Zhao\u2019s teacher. Whether he was young or not, it wouldn\u2019t cause their hearts to waver one bit.</p><br/><p>During this time that they had been with Elder Zhao, Elder Zhao would sometimes let them read a page or just half a page of his book. Just from that, they could tell that his teacher had exceptional abilities.</p><br/><p>\u2018Various Types of Typhoid\u2019 was indeed a masterpiece of Chinese medicine. Compared to those ancient books, it was much more all-rounded and easy to understand.</p><br/><p>Each of the illnesses inside came with a description. They wanted to borrow it from Elder Zhao to read it but Elder Zhao refused. He kept carrying it in his hands and reading it everyday. Except when he was sleeping or eating, he would spend all his time studying it.</p><br/><p>And the most important part was that he managed to find a medicine for anorexia. Who could possibly compare to such capability?</p><br/><p>They wanted very badly to meet with this godly Chinese doctor. Besides enquiring about \u2018Various Types of Typhoid\u2019, they also wanted to get to know him.</p></div>\n</div>"}

F*ck! F*ck! Brother, you are f*cking awesome! Have you seen the news yet?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan distanced himself from the phone. That voice was too piercing. \"Are you f*cking crazy? Calling me ten over times early in the morning. If you don't give me a good reason, I'll kill you.\"</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang was extremely happy, so he didn't mind what Lin Fan said. \"No, just look at the news. The album has gone viral. It has completely exploded. Don't you feel excited?\"</p><br/><p>\"Oh.\" Lin Fan didn't feel much at all. \"Just because of that, you called me over ten times?\"</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang was taken aback. \"Brother, aren't you even a little emotional? The album has gone viral. This is your album!\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was not the least bit interested in all this. It was just an album going viral. It was all within his expectations. Didn't they know who produced that album? If it hadn't gone viral, that would really be unacceptable.</p><br/><p>\"Alright, I'm hanging up. I thought it was something important. Calling me so many times just because of this\u2026 Isn't it completely normal for the album to go viral? Seeing you like that, it's like you've been doubting my ability,\" said Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang was dumbfounded. He had lost his excitement after being told off by Lin Fan. He suddenly felt that what Lin Fan said made sense. That album had been produced by his own brother, what was there to be excited about? It was completely normal for it to go viral. It wasn't anything unexpected at all.</p><br/><p>\"Right, my brother, you are right. Why was I so excited? It really is a very normal thing. Alright then, go on and continue resting. I have to start helping Huan Yue with the promoting. I can't waste these current circumstances. If I don't do a good promotion, it would be a waste,\" said Wang Ming Yang.</p><br/><p>Lin fan nodded. \"Mmm. Don't get too emotional. Calm down. It's not a big thing, it's just an album. I can make many more of such albums and any one of them would go viral.\"</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang nodded and said, \"That makes sense.\"</p><br/><p>After hanging up, Wang Ming Yang thought for a moment. His brother was right. What was there to get emotional about? It was perfectly normal. But still, he had to handle his business.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile.</p><br/><p>After hanging up, Lin Fan laughed. He laughed ecstatically. \"D*mn, it really went f*cking viral! This is wonderful! I'll have things to do later on.\"</p><br/><p>Ever since Autumn Sword Fish Killer had been taken in by Lin Fan, he had been staying low-profile and living humbly, mainly because Master Lin was not someone to be provoked. He often deducted his pay and he was a merciless boss. To Autumn Sword Fish Killer, this was a pretty good feeling. Quite a number of his schoolmates would often call him out for gatherings but he would reject them all. As a successful individual, how could he live the nightlife? He was busy working every day. In the past, they wouldn't invite him. Now that they did, how could he accept so easily?</p><br/><p>Just as Autumn Sword Fish Killer was thinking about all this, Lin Fan's call came.</p><br/><p>Autumn Sword Fish Killer said, \"Boss, what instructions do you have for me?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \"Go online and make an announcement, saying that Wu Huan Yue's album was produced by me. I want to show off a little right now. I think you should be up for the job.\"</p><br/><p>Autumn Sword Fish Killer said, \"Boss, the amount of work required for this task is rather large. About the pay...do you think you could pay me a little?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \"Mmm, don't worry. I won't owe you any debts. I've already transferred $5000 to you via WeChat.\"</p><br/><p>Autumn Sword Fish Killer was ecstatic. It was as if he had eaten some honey. With a smile, he said, \"Boss, what about the remaining $5000?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \"It will depend on your performance. If your performance is unsatisfactory, your pay will be deducted. I'm going to hang up now. Work hard, I have high hopes for you.\"</p><br/><p>*clatter*</p><br/><p>He hung up.</p><br/><p>Autumn Sword Fish Killer cursed, \"This unscrupulous boss! Am I not getting scammed by you? I, Autumn Sword Fish Killer, am the king of the Internet trolls!\"</p><br/><p>\"Forget it, let's just work first. Otherwise, if my pay gets deducted, I'd be f*cked.\"</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>After washing up, Lin Fan cheerily headed towards Cloud Street. Those townsfolk were looking all waiting for his scallion pancakes.</p><br/><p>In the shop.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian said, \"In the future, that Children's Welfare Institute will be ours. Do you think we will have to move there?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved his hand and replied, \"No, there's no such need. We'll just stick to the way things are.\"</p><br/><p>The Children's Welfare Institute was now under his management but he wouldn't interfere with it too much. He would just go there every day to have a look. He had a tremendous plan in his mind that he was going to implement but for now, he had to do the proper preparations.</p><br/><p>Some of the Encyclopedia knowledge that he possessed was really not bad. He could pass them down.</p><br/><p>Recently, he had been wanting to take the exams for the medical qualifications. Together with that major classification task, he had immense pressure on him.</p><br/><p>He couldn't get stuck on this task. If he really got stuck, that would be a little f*cked up.</p><br/><p>He now understood that the Encyclopedia's tenth page's task was not simple. It required him to slowly grind through it.</p><br/><p>He unlocked his phone and opened Weibo.</p><br/><p>*ding ding*</p><br/><p>His Weibo private messages inbox was instantly filled.</p><br/><p>\"Master Lin, I'm the manager of Spring Star Arts Company. We want to make a song.\"</p><br/><p>\"$200,000 for one song. How's that?\"</p><br/><p>\"We want to produce a song with you. You can decide the price but the quality must be as good as Wu Huan Yue's songs.\"</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>He scrolled through the messages. These messages were all asking him to produce songs for them. Moreover, their conditions were not low. They all wanted premium-quality songs. Who the f*ck did they think they were, trying to buy him using money? He wasn't such an undignified person.</p><br/><p>*Ding ding!*</p><br/><p>At that moment, an unknown number was calling him.</p><br/><p>He answered.</p><br/><p>\"Hello, Master Lin. I'm Zuo Teng Fei.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was stunned and a little suspicious. \"Who are you? I don't know you.\"</p><br/><p>Zuo Teng Fei was startled. He hadn't thought that this would happen. Then, he said embarrassedly, \"Master Lin, I'm the judge from 'The New Voice', Zuo Teng Fei. Do you remember?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan thought very hard. Then, he suddenly remembered. \"Oh oh, so you're Teacher Zuo. I wonder, is there something Teacher Zuo wants?\"</p><br/><p>Zuo Teng Fei coughed lightly. \"It's like this, actually. I'm going to get right to the point. On behalf of my company, I would like to produce a song with Master Lin. If Master Lin is interested, we can discuss it. Don't worry about the price. You give us a quote and we definitely won't try to bargain.\"</p><br/><p>\"Who's going to sing?\" asked Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Zuo Teng Fei didn't understand Master Lin's intention. He said, \"It'll be sung by a singer under our company, Kuang You.\"</p><br/><p>\"Wait a moment.\"</p><br/><p>Not long after.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan spoke, \"I'm sorry, Teacher Zuo. I just did a search for that person on Weibo. I discovered that he flamed me together with Ying Jin in the past. Wouldn't you think there's something wrong with my brain if I were to write a song for him? I'm sorry, I still have some things to do. Let's leave it at that for now. I'm hanging up.\"</p><br/><p>\"Hey! Hey\u2026!\"</p><br/><p>*clatter*</p><br/><p>The call was hung up.</p><br/><p>Inside a certain company.</p><br/><p>\"How was it?\"</p><br/><p>Zuo Teng Fei shook his head. \"He didn't agree. Kuang You, did you scold Master Lin on Weibo before?\"</p><br/><p>Kuang You was around twenty-seven or twenty-eight years old. He was very young. At that moment, he was stunned. \"I think so.\"</p><br/><p>Zuo Teng Fei was frustrated. \"What were you thinking? Why did you scold Master Lin? Don't tell me you were following Ying Jin.\"</p><br/><p>Kuang You answered indifferently, \"Forget it, Teacher Zuo. What could possibly happen? We just couldn't get the song, it's no big deal.\"</p><br/><p>As a first-rate producer, Zuo Teng Fei had a pretty large temper and he didn't have to give others respect. At that moment, he looked at Kuang You and scolded him, \"You don't know sh*t.\"</p><br/><p>Kuang You was upset but he had no choice. He didn't dare to offend Zuo Teng Fei.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

They were spread all over the country. This medicine hadn\u2019t been used much in the past but later on, experiments proved that this medicine was very effective against infantile spasms.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-1\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>And although infantile spasms weren\u2019t very common, if you added up all the cases across the country, it wasn\u2019t a small number.</p><br/><p>More importantly, this medicine had been too cheap in the past and they had been unprofitable. Hence, when ACTH became a lifesaver for infants, the distributors started to have some ideas.</p><br/><p>They immediately started hoarding the medicine.</p><br/><p>Even some hospitals couldn\u2019t manage to obtain the medicine. It became one of the hardest medications to obtain.</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan sent his Weibo post, it drew the attention of many people.</p><br/><p>At the same time, in a WeChat group, which was the group of distributors, some people started discussing.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-2\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cDid you all see Master Lin\u2019s Weibo? He says that he\u2019s going to start developing this medication and he\u2019s telling us to sell our stocks immediately. Otherwise, they will become worthless.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, how awesome. He nearly scared me to death.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve hoarded hundreds of boxes but I\u2019m going to use them to gain riches. Let him slowly develop his medicine.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight now, the price for this medicine is pretty good. One box is priced at 3800. I wonder how many people will buy it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLast time, I sold a few boxes at 2000 each.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, he won\u2019t be able to develop it. This is a hormone, how could he develop it? Is he going to rely on Chinese medicine?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnyway, we can\u2019t possibly unload all this. If we manage to sell all of it, we would be rich.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo what you need to, everyone. Don\u2019t be scared by this guy.\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-3\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cHe really loves meddling in others\u2019 business. Why won\u2019t God just get rid of him? Getting in the way of other people\u2019s wealth is unforgivable. I really can\u2019t stand him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>To these distributors, Lin Fan\u2019s action was really despicable.</p><br/><p>Getting in the way of one\u2019s path to wealth was as bad as killing one\u2019s parents.</p><br/><p>But some distributors were afraid. They were fearful of Master Lin\u2019s capabilities. If he really managed to develop it, they really might not be able to sell the medicine anymore.</p><br/><p>Suddenly.</p><br/><p>The chat group went crazy.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Wang, are you f*cking insane? How much are you selling it for on the Internet? 80 for one box? Have you gone mad?\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Wang: \u201cI\u2019m out. I don\u2019t want to mess around with Master Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Wang, you\u2019re crazy. You\u2019re ruining our market. Stop selling it. Give it all to me. I\u2019ll pay 200 for each box.\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-4\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take them too. You\u2019re spoiling the market price. Are you trying to harm us?\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Wang saw that they all wanted to take his stocks and he didn\u2019t hesitate at all. \u201cAlright, if you guys want it, I\u2019ll sell it to you. I\u2019m getting rid of them right now. I have a bad feeling about this.\u201d</p><br/><p>This kind of situation became quite common in this WeChat group. Gradually, a few more people came out and agreed to sell their stocks to the others.</p><br/><p>They didn\u2019t want to stockpile anymore. Master Lin\u2019s words had frightened them.</p><br/><p>If what he had said really happens, this medicine would become worthless in their possession. Hence, to be safe, they decided not to go against Master Lin.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The next day!</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing waited for his teacher in the school\u2019s research lab. He was filled with excitement because he was about to be immersed in research.</p><br/><p>He believed that, as long as he had his teacher, they would definitely develop the medicine successfully. But it was only at 9 AM that Lin Fan walked in leisurely.</p><br/><p>This time, the development of the prescription basically had no difficulty to it. It was exceptionally simple.</p><br/><p>But even if it was so simple, Lin Fan had to give a feeling that this problem was very challenging, the research was very difficult, and it had to be discussed thoroughly.</p><br/><p>Otherwise, if he just solved the problem easily, Zhao Ming Qing would definitely feel that they could keep on going and tackle some other diseases while they were at it.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-5\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>If that really happened, then it would be f*cked up.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, the medicinal ingredients have all been prepared,\u201d Zhao Ming Qing said with a smile. When the person-in-charge of the ingredients had heard that they would be developing a prescription again, he had personally come to deliver the ingredients. He had even proudly patted his chest and promised that they could take however much they needed. If they needed more, all they had to do was call.</p><br/><p>\u201cMmm. Think for a moment first and write down your thoughts. I\u2019ll come to take a look later on,\u201d Lin Fan said. Then, he sat down and took out his phone to look at the news.</p><br/><p>But when he saw his Weibo, he realized that all of a sudden, there were many haters.</p><br/><p>However, he was already used to it. After all, he was disrupting other people\u2019s benefits. If no one came to flame him, that would really be strange.</p><br/><p>There was a Weibo post that tagged him. He took a closer look and found out that it was Shanghai First Pharmaceutical Company.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe welcome Master Lin to develop the prescription. However, we wish for Master Lin not to just work on what is already available. After all, this prescription is the blood and sweat of our many professionals.\u201d</p><br/><p>With a glance, he didn\u2019t find any problems with this post. But when he took a closer look, he discovered the issue.</p><br/><p>Was Shanghai First Pharmaceutical Company giving him a warning?</p><br/><p>He chuckled as he felt that this Shanghai First Pharmaceutical Company wasn\u2019t too friendly to him. He held his phone as he hesitated for a moment, thinking about whether he should reply.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-6\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>But this matter did seem to be related to this pharmaceutical company, so he decided that he should reply in order to prevent a misunderstanding.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan: @ShanghaiFirstPharmaceuticalCompany, thank you for the heads up. But don\u2019t worry, I definitely won\u2019t build upon your prescription. I\u2019ll be directly researching and developing a prescription to cure infantile spasms. Also, I\u2019d like to give you a heads up too. Your medicine can soon be taken off the shelves, so don\u2019t produce too much of it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Initially, when the netizens had seen Shanghai First Pharmaceutical Company\u2019s post, they had been upset.</p><br/><p>They felt that the post was challenging their Master Lin.</p><br/><p>But after Master Lin uploaded his post, they were all cheering.</p><br/><p>\u201cAwesome, my Master Lin!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, LMAO. Shanghai First Pharmaceutical Company thinks too highly of themselves. They even told Master Lin not to build upon their product. Master Lin is going to completely conquer the disease of infantile spasms.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin is really a good man. He knows that he\u2019s going to develop a new medicine, so he even told them not to produce any more of the old medicine.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s see how Shanghai First Pharmaceutical Company will handle this. If Master Lin gets serious, it will really be scary.</p><br/><p>Shanghai First Pharmaceutical Company.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-7\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Facing Master Lin\u2019s warning, they anxiously held a meeting.</p><br/><p>They weren\u2019t really concerned about this kind of unprofitable medicine.</p><br/><p>But this prescription belonged to them. They were the only company in the country that could produce it.</p><br/><p>Now that Master Lin said that he wanted to conquer this disease, that meant that the medicine would become worthless in future. To a medicine manufacturer, that was a huge loss.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you all think about this matter regarding Master Lin?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you ask me, we should just let him try to develop the medicine. I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll be able to.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t forget that Master Lin even managed to conquer leukemia. I think he has a ninety percent chance of doing it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Amongst the medicine factory\u2019s higher-ups, most of them felt that Master Lin would definitely be able to develop the medicine.</p><br/><p>They had no idea how someone like Master Lin could even exist.</p><br/><p>If he really conquers all kinds of diseases, what would they, as medicine manufacturers, do?</p></div>\n</div>"}

Please come to me.\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-1\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Lin Fan settled his heart as he fished. Through this period of hard work, he had managed to gather most of the herbs he needed and he was left with the last one. It hadn\u2019t appeared the whole time and it left him helpless.</p><br/><p>Initially, he had wanted to substitute it with other herbs but he realized that there was no other herb that could replace the purple lingzhi. In other words, this purple lingzhi was the key component of the pill.</p><br/><p>If he used a substitute, he wouldn\u2019t be able to produce a perfect medicinal pill.</p><br/><p>*Ding ding*</p><br/><p>Message notification sound.</p><br/><p>Perhaps they already knew that calling wouldn\u2019t get through to Lin Fan, so they sent a message instead.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-2\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Lin Fan took out his phone and took a look. Then, he started to become anxious.</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang: \u201cBrother Lin, Director Zhao isn\u2019t going to last much longer\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Just these few words made Lin Fan feel a tremendous amount to stress.</p><br/><p>\u201cMing Qing, you have to hold on for a while more.\u201d Even if he were to go back now, he would be helpless. He wouldn\u2019t be able to help Zhao Ming Qing at all.</p><br/><p>Right now, Zhao Ming Qing wasn\u2019t suffering from any illness but rather, his bodily functions had reached their limits. Without a nature-defying procedure, he couldn\u2019t be saved.</p><br/><p>They could only rely on the medicinal pill now.</p><br/><p><em>Relax the mind. Release all anxiety and worry. </em>There were countless godly techniques in the Wuxia major class of knowledge. And the number of techniques that could be used to calm the heart was many.</p><br/><p>The hospital.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-3\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing had many good friends. At that moment, they had all rushed over.</p><br/><p>Amongst them, Elder Mu wasn\u2019t involved in Chinese medicine but he had a very good relationship with Zhao Ming Qing. When Lin Fan and Zhao Ming Qing had first met, Elder Mu had been there and he could be considered a witness.</p><br/><p>And when Zhao Ming Qing officially became Lin Fan\u2019s disciple, Elder Mu had been the host of the ceremony as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cLi Xing, tell me the truth. How long more does your dad have?\u201d Elder Mu asked in a serious tone.</p><br/><p>Zhao Li Xing replied, \u201cUncle Mu, I\u2019m not sure either. The doctor says it\u2019s three days at most but looking at the situation, it seems like he can sustain himself for a while more.\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Mu felt that this had been too sudden. He hadn\u2019t been prepared at all when he suddenly received the call. He didn\u2019t even know what to say.</p><br/><p>The professor cum deputy director of Shanghai People\u2019s Hospital, Sun Zong Yun, came over in a hurry. \u201cLi Xing, what happened to your father exactly? How did he suddenly come into this state?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUncle Sun, I don\u2019t know either. The doctor says his organs have aged too much.\u201d Zhao Li Xing was already out of his wits. After all, this situation had caught them completely unprepared. Their father had been perfectly fine a while ago but he had suddenly gone into this state.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about Master Lin? Why didn\u2019t Master Lin come?\u201d Elder Mu asked in a panicked tone.</p><br/><p><em>Elder Zhao is Master Lin\u2019s student. If Master Lin comes to treat him, he will definitely be fine.</em></p><div class=\"code-block code-block-4\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Zhao Li Xing sighed. \u201cI\u2019m afraid Master Lin has no confidence as well. Previously, my dad had a flu and Master Lin came to see him. He treated his flu but didn\u2019t say much after. He probably knows that my dad\u2019s situation can\u2019t be helped.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd the news has reported too that Master Lin has disappeared for a few days. He hasn\u2019t appeared at Cloud Street.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Elder Mu heard this, his expression went blank as he mumbled, \u201cCould there really be no way left?\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, Zhao Shi came out of the ward and saw the people outside. \u201cElder Zhao is awake. You guys can go in to see him.\u201d</p><br/><p>When the crowd heard this, they quickly entered. Their friendship was one that had lasted decades.</p><br/><p>In the ward.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing was lying on the bed, wearing an oxygen mask. His eyes looked unfocused. When he saw his old friends enter, he took out his oxygen mask and mustered a thin smile. He spoke weakly.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you all here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Mu grabbed Elder Zhao\u2019s hand. \u201cWe\u2019re here to see you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing smiled. \u201cWhat\u2019s there to see? There\u2019s nothing to see here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. You\u2019ll be fine.\u201d Elder Mu appeared upset. And Sun Zong Yun\u2019s eyes started to well up as well. They had known each other since they were ten. In the blink of an eye, several decades had passed. Those kids full of vigor and energy had turned into old men. Time had really flown by.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing said, \u201cI\u2019ll definitely be fine. My teacher has promised me that he\u2019ll teach me powerful Chinese medicine techniques in the future. And he\u2019ll even develop new prescriptions with me. How could anything happen to me?\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-5\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cRight, right. You\u2019ll definitely be fine.\u201d Elder Mu nodded.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing swept the room with his gaze but he didn\u2019t see who he wanted to see. \u201cWhere\u2019s my teacher?\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Mu didn\u2019t know what to say. \u201cMaster Lin, he\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Before he could finish, Zhao Ming Qing interrupted with a wave of his hand. \u201cIt\u2019s a little too fast. I didn\u2019t expect it to happen so fast. I haven\u2019t even studied until the end. I haven\u2019t even thanked Teacher for his guidance\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Mu patted Zhao Ming Qing\u2019s hand as he lowered his head. He had no words. He didn\u2019t know what to say.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin knows it in his heart. He definitely knows it,\u201d said Sun Zong Yun.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing said, \u201cI\u2019m a little tired. I\u2019m going to rest for a bit. I have to wait for Teacher to come and see me before I go. Otherwise, I can\u2019t go yet.\u201d</p><br/><p>His four children stood at the back. Their eyes had turned red and Zhao Shi was wiping her tears.</p><br/><p>Everyone left the room.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere exactly is Master Lin?\u201d asked Elder Mu.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-6\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Zhao Li Xing replied, \u201cI don\u2019t know where he went. I called Master Lin but he didn\u2019t pick up.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sun Zong Yun said, \u201cIt\u2019s good if he doesn\u2019t come for now. I\u2019m afraid that if Elder Zhao sees Master Lin, he\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t finish his sentence but everyone understood. If Zhao Ming Qing got what he wanted, there would be nothing keeping him here anymore.</p><br/><p>\u201cI think that Master Lin won\u2019t just sit idly by. There must be a reason he has disappeared for a few days. He must be doing something,\u201d said Elder Mu.</p><br/><p>Elder Zhao and Master Lin had a great teacher-disciple relationship. Judging by Master Lin\u2019s personality, he definitely wouldn\u2019t just ignore the situation. He definitely would have a plan.</p><br/><p>However, this was just Elder Mu\u2019s hope. He had no idea at all about what would happen in the end. Looking at Elder Zhao\u2019s current situation, how could he possibly be saved?</p><br/><p>The next day!</p><br/><p>The doctors were astonished. They realized that Elder Zhao was still holding on. His fuel had completely depleted but his heart was still beating. To them, most people wouldn\u2019t be able to persevere until such a stage.</p><br/><p>Most people would just allow themselves to quietly leave the world in a painless way.</p><br/><p>Zhao Li Xing had been in contact with the doctors the whole time.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-7\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>The doctor said, \u201cMister Zhao, your father has been holding on the whole time but we\u2019re not sure how much longer he can hold on. Perhaps he has something that he can\u2019t let go of.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Zhao Li Xing heard that, he understood what it was. \u201cMy dad is waiting for his teacher to come. He wants to see his teacher once more.\u201d</p><br/><p>The doctor nodded. The human body is a mysterious thing. At times, willpower can sustain oneself and allow one to accomplish the impossible.</p><br/><p>Right now, Zhao Ming Qing only had one thought in his mind. That was to see his teacher once more.</p><br/><p>Perhaps that was what kept him going.</p><br/><p>By the river.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was very calm but his expression was becoming more and more grave.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m begging you, come out quickly. Stop hiding.\u201d</p><br/><p>The fishing line moved.</p><br/><p>He eagerly lifted his fishing rod. At that instant, a herb dangled from the fishing line.</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan saw that, he was instantly delighted. But suddenly, he realized that something wasn\u2019t right.</p><br/><p>The medicinal herb that was hanging from the fishing line was removing itself from the hook as if it was struggling to escape.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-8\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare\u2026\u201d Without hesitation, Lin Fan tossed the fishing rod to the side. As his body turned into a flash of light, he dashed forward and jumped into midair. Then, he grasped the herb with his hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cPurple lingzhi, you\u2019ve finally come.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p></div>\n</div>"}

Those words.\u201d</p><br/><p>They were already in so much shock that they didn\u2019t know what to say. They just felt that everything seemed too unreal. This amazing Little Boss, who sold scallion pancakes and read fortunes, could now treat illnesses as well. Moreover, it wasn\u2019t just any illness.</p><br/><p>When they heard about this, their minds were blown.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true,\u201d replied Lin Fan. This was a very simple matter but Elder Chen didn\u2019t trust him. This left him with no choice. Anyway, it didn\u2019t have a large impact. He could just let the hospital treat him.</p><br/><p>Because Shanghai was a large city, the medical expertise in this hospital was quite good. The level of expertise they had couldn\u2019t be compared to hospitals in county-level cities or third-rate cities.</p><br/><p>Elder Liang chuckled, \u201cThis Elder Chen just missed out on a great opportunity.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sister Hong shook her head helplessly, \u201cSigh, I used to wonder why Little Boss told us back then to look for him if there was anything wrong with our bodies. So this was the reason.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled, \u201cAs the saying goes, don\u2019t let your own fertile water flow into others\u2019 fields. We are all family. If there were any problems with your healths, I surely would not spare any effort to treat you all. But don\u2019t think too much about this matter. In future, if you have any health issues, come and look for me. However, this is only limited to you and your family members.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha,\u201d everyone started laughing, \u201cWhy do we feel like the greatest fortune that we\u2019ve attained in our lives is getting to know Little Boss?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said brazenly, \u201cThat is indeed a fortunate thing.\u201d</p><br/><p>The shop owners exchanged a few more words before Zhao Ming Qing came over. \u201cTeacher, these two are my old friends, Zhou Qing Quan and Wang Tian Feng.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the two of them and smiled, \u201cNice to meet you. Let\u2019s chat over there.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Qing Quan and Wang Tian Feng looked at Lin Fan and couldn\u2019t help but sigh in their hearts. He\u2019s young. He\u2019s really too young. If it wasn\u2019t for Elder Zhao, they would never have dared to believe this.</p><br/><p>But even Elder Zhao didn\u2019t believe it at first. If he hadn\u2019t been tied to the tree by his teacher back then, this would never have happened.</p><br/><p>At the resting area by the side.</p><br/><p>Zhou Qing Quan said warmly, \u201cMaster Lin, we keep hearing from Elder Zhao about you. Elder Zhao really admires and respects your medical expertise to no end. I was also fortunate enough to see one or two pages of that \u2018Various Types of Typhoid\u2019. Although it was only one or two pages, I really feel that your medical expertise far exceeds ours by a large margin.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at Zhou Qing Quan, then at Zhao Ming Qing. He felt that these two guys probably wanted to see him because they had seen Zhao Ming Qing\u2019s copy of the \u2018Various Types of Typhoid\u2019.</p><br/><p>\u201cPresident Zhou, Vice-President Wang, you want a copy of it?\u201d asked Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing said, \u201cTeacher, don\u2019t listen to them. That\u2019s just the way they are.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Qing Quan was slightly startled, \u201cThis\u2026this\u2026\u201d It wasn\u2019t easy to reply him. However, Lin Fan had said it so bluntly that they had to reply. \u201cMaster Lin, this \u2018Various Types of Typhoid\u2019 is a great medical writing. We would definitely be interested.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing got angry. \u201cElder Zhou, you two are too cunning. I\u2019m giving you an introduction but you two just want \u2018Various Types of Typhoid\u2019 from my teacher.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was silent as he thought about something in his heart. If this \u2018Various Types of Typhoid\u2019 was to be distributed and Chinese doctors from everywhere were able to read it and understand its information, then Lin Fan would surely earn Encyclopedic Points.</p><br/><p>When he thought about this, Lin Fan\u2019s face became serious as he said, \u201cMing Qing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher,\u201d responded Zhao Ming Qing.</p><br/><p>\u201cOur Chinese medicine has been declining because we\u2019ve valued it too much as our own. Sooner or later, \u2018Various Types of Typhoid\u2019 has to be distributed to the masses to benefit Chinese medicine. When you go back, photocopy the original version for them and let them bring it back with them,\u201d said Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>When Zhou Qing Quan and Wang Tian Feng heard this, they were extremely excited. Then, they looked at Lin Fan and praised him with a changed tone, \u201cMaster Lin, your moral values in medicine are truly unmatched. We respect you. If you don\u2019t mind, why don\u2019t you join the Chinese Medical Association?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Tian Feng added, \u201cIf Master Lin joins the Chinese Medical Association, I, Wang Tian Feng, am willing to give you my appointment as Vice-President.\u201d</p><br/><p>An appointment as Vice-President was really not low.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing nodded. He was content. On this condition, it was worth giving up the great medical writing, \u2018Various Types of Typhoid\u2019. However, he knew that his teacher had a habit of staying ordinary. He didn\u2019t care much for such things and was probably going to reject the offer.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was delighted. Yet another appointment as Vice-President of an association. How fun.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, since it\u2019s like this, it\u2019s not nice for me to reject the offer. Joining the Chinese Medical Association and doing my part for Chinese medicine is a responsibility of mine. I shall accept the appointment as Association Vice-President,\u201d Lin Fan accepted with no hesitation.</p><br/><p>By joining three associations, he received a significant pay each month. It would be pointless not to accept it so he chose to join.</p><br/><p>Zhou Qing Quan started smiling, \u201cElder Wang, you don\u2019t have to give up your place as Vice-President. It\u2019s very normal to have two Vice-Presidents. Master Lin, please wait for us to go back to Beijing before we prepare the documents. We\u2019ll do it as soon as possible.</p><br/><p>Lin fan waved his hand, \u201cThere\u2019s no rush. However, do study \u2018Various Types of Typhoid\u2019 properly. You can even pass it on to other people who are interested in Chinese medicine.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Qing Quan was moved by Lin Fan\u2019s moral principles.</p><br/><p>He thought to himself, \u201cLook, this is what it means to be a Master. Such a masterpiece and he so casually shares it with us without asking for anything in return. His only request is for it to be passed down to even more Chinese doctors.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Zhou Qing Quan heard this, he had an urge to start crying.</p><br/><p>He thought of some of the old doctors in the association who, when they discovered a type of medicine or a certain piece of knowledge, would try everything they could to keep it to themselves. When compared to this Master Lin, the difference was simply too huge.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Lin Fan was thinking in his heart, \u201cHurry up and come to me, Encyclopedic Points!\u201d At that moment, he only had five pitiful points. Unbelievable!</p><br/><p>But Lin Fan had an idea. If these two old men went out with him to complete his task as well, that would be great.</p><br/><p>Moreover, when he went out, if he was to be alone, he would definitely spend his own money. But if he brought these two with him, he would be able to spend public money instead.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Lin Fan cleared his throat and said, \u201cMing Qing, prepare yourself. In a few days, you will be going with me to five cities. We\u2019ll be volunteering to treat the sick without taking any repayment. Treating various illnesses will help your medical skills to improve greatly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing nodded. He was very excited. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, teacher. I\u2019ve already done the preparations.\u201d</p><br/><p>To him, following his teacher to go out and practice medicine was the fastest way to improve his medical abilities. If he came across anything he didn\u2019t understand, he could ask his teacher. He would be luckiest if he came across more difficult and challenging illnesses.</p><br/><p>He believed that with his teacher\u2019s abilities, no illness could be an issue.</p><br/><p>Indeed\u2026</p><br/><p>When Zhou Qing Quan heard this, his eyes lit up.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, what are you two talking about?\u201d he asked curiously.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed in his heart. The little fish has taken the bait.</p></div>\n</div>"}

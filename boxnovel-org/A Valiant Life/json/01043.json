When she put on her makeup meticulously, she was really so beautiful that she did not even seem like a local person.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Lin, I took a leave to come here,\u201d said Wu Huan Yue. Then, she seemed to suddenly recall something as she said softly, \u201cI haven\u2019t asked for your approval and just came. It wouldn\u2019t be a problem, would it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan blinked several times. He wanted to say that it was fine since she was already there but he was afraid this wouldn\u2019t be so easily explained.</p><br/><p>He hadn\u2019t expected that Weibo post that he had sent to create such a situation. If he had known, he wouldn\u2019t have sent it even if he had been beaten to death.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan and Wu Huan Yue were very familiar with each other. Naturally, it was fine.</p><br/><p>But when Yun Xue Yao saw Wu You Lan at this moment as well as the two girls next to her, she couldn\u2019t help but raise her alertness. She felt as if she had come across some strong competitors.</p><br/><p>Women have very accurate instincts. She felt a sort of competition going on.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan\u2019s parents were both completely dumbfounded, especially his father. He seemed to be unable to sit still anymore. It was as if he wanted to stand up to move about because he really couldn\u2019t take it. It had been too heavy of an impact.</p><br/><p>After sizing up the others, Yun Xue Yao felt as if she and the other three girls were neck and neck with regards to their attractiveness and physiques. But in terms of the closeness of their relationships with Lin Fan, she was far from the rest.</p><br/><p>However, she felt helpless. She was a child of the Yun Family and her family business was very busy. After all, her family didn\u2019t raise her up to be an idle person and she couldn\u2019t just ignore her family business.</p><br/><p>Also, Hao Jiang was very far from Shanghai. It seemed that all she could do was go over to Shanghai more often when she was free in the future.</p><br/><p>*Thump!*</p><br/><p>Huang Yun Ge saw the situation at the scene and was completely shocked. He couldn\u2019t even sit steadily and just fell onto the ground with a look of astonishment on his face.</p><br/><p>To a pampered child like him, this was too huge of a blow.</p><br/><p>He even started to compare himself with Lin Fan. He felt that his dressing was a level higher than Lin Fan\u2019s but he didn\u2019t have such good luck with the ladies.</p><br/><p>Huang Ting furrowed his brows. He felt like Elder Lin\u2019s son\u2019s lifestyle wasn\u2019t too good.</p><br/><p>This birthday banquet had already exceeded everyone\u2019s expectations. No one had expected things to turn out like this.</p><br/><p>At that moment, a guest\u2019s laughter could be heard.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Lin, are you going to be going for your son\u2019s wedding soon?\u201d</p><br/><p>When these words were said, Lin Fan\u2019s parents didn\u2019t know what to say. They really didn\u2019t know what to reply to that.</p><br/><p>They both knew that their son was very capable. But with so many young and beautiful ladies around, it wouldn\u2019t be nice to say anything.</p><br/><p>If they were just friends, that would be fine. However, that didn\u2019t seem to be the case at all. These ladies were all extremely courteous towards them as if each of them wanted to be picked by Lin Fan\u2019s parents.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan\u2019s parents were dazed and completely lost.</p><br/><p>Right now, they weren\u2019t the only ones dazed. Even Lin Fan himself was a little dazed. He didn\u2019t even know what to do.</p><br/><p>He was at a loss as he had no idea how to handle this situation.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, you\u2019re Wu Huan Yue.\u201d Huang Yun Ge\u2019s gaze had fixated on Wu Huan Yue. The more he looked at her, the more he realized that she looked like Wu Huan Yue. Then, he cried out in surprise.</p><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue had been actively shooting movies and television shows, so her fame was gradually rising. Some young people would naturally recognize her.</p><br/><p>Huang Yun Ge had just recognized her and he was holding his phone in front of him to compare her with a picture of her.</p><br/><p>After all, seeing someone on television and seeing someone in real life were two different things.</p><br/><p>When he confirmed that it was her, he couldn\u2019t help but cry out once again.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn! Dad, this is the celebrity, Wu Huan Yue,\u201d said Huang Yun Ge as he pulled on his father and pointed at Wu Huan Yue.</p><br/><p>Huang Ting was startled. Naturally, he knew what his son was talking about but what made him doubtful was that Elder Lin\u2019s family was supposed to be just an average family. How could they know a celebrity?</p><br/><p>Then, he thought about the incident from before. Could it be that it was because of this that so many people had come?</p><br/><p>Thinking about that, everything made sense.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026you\u2026\u201d At that moment, Huang Ting realized that his son seemed to have become possessed. He had taken out his phone and he looked at the screen time after time. He even kept on comparing it with Lin Fan as if he was trying to confirm who he was.</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry for disturbing\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly, the banquet hall\u2019s doors were pushed open.</p><br/><p>A middle-aged man led two other people as he walked in with a wide smile.</p><br/><p>With his arrival, gasps of shock rang out from the guests. They seemed to have recognized this middle-aged man.</p><br/><p>When Huang Ting saw who had come, his brows were suddenly raised. Then, he stood up immediately. Ignoring his son who was pulling him, he went around the dining table and approached the man as if he had seen someone incredible.</p><br/><p>\u201cMayor Zhang.\u201d</p><br/><p>He hadn\u2019t expected that the Mayor of Zhongzhou would come.</p><br/><p>When those classmates at that table heard that this person was a mayor, all of them stood up as well. To them, this was an important person with great social standing.</p><br/><p>Even some of the surrounding guests did the same. Some of them were Zhongzhou locals and they saw the news every day. Naturally, they knew who this man was.</p><br/><p>Mayor Zhang saw someone approaching him and was taken aback. \u201cChief Huang is here too?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. Hello, Mayor Huang.\u201d Huang Ting immediately lowered his ego as he spoke very courteously.</p><br/><p>Mayor Zhang shook hands with Huang Ting and hurriedly let go. Huang Ting wanted to say something but realized that this Mayor Zhang actually passed him quickly and hurriedly went over to his old classmates\u2019 side.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, Master Lin. Hello, hello,\u201d Mayor Zhang greeted very excitedly as he shook Lin Fan\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan sighed, then chuckled. \u201cMayor Zhang, hello. Why did you come here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Mayor Zhang said, \u201cWhat are you talking about? Today is Master Lin\u2019s father\u2019s fiftieth birthday. As Zhongzhou\u2019s official, of course I had to come over. After all, Master Lin has brought honor to our Zhongzhou.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDad, he\u2019s Master Lin!\u201d Huang Yun Ge, who had regained his senses, shouted.</p><br/><p>When Huang Ting heard the words \u2018Master Lin\u2019, he was completely stunned.</p><br/><p>When he saw that youngster talking to Mayor Zhang on equal terms, he was completely dazed as he just stood there stupidly.</p><br/><p><em>This is my former classmate\u2019s son?</em></p><br/><p><em>My former classmate\u2019s son is the famous Master Lin?</em></p><br/><p><em>But why have I never heard my ex-classmate talk about it in the group before?</em></p><br/><p>The classmates from those two tables were all stunned. Then, they looked over at the astonished Huang Yun Ge. \u201cWho is this Master Lin?\u201d</p><br/><p>Huang Yun Ge cried out, \u201cThis Master Lin is a big shot! Ah, d*mn! I actually wasn\u2019t able to tell.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mayor Zhang exchanged a few words with Lin Fan before going over to shake his father\u2019s hand. \u201cElder Brother Lin, happy birthday. Your son is not a simple man. He\u2019s amazing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan\u2019s parents were both at a loss. After all, this person was a mayor. Then, Papa Lin hurriedly replied, \u201cThank you, thank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mayor Zhang looked at Lin Fan and said, \u201cMaster Lin, when are you going to come back to Zhongzhou to develop further? Our Zhongzhou is developing well now. If you come back, you can choose wherever you want and we\u2019ll definitely give it to you. We\u2019ll even make it Zhongzhou\u2019s main development area.\u201d</p><br/><p>These words weren\u2019t words that hadn\u2019t been thought through. This Master Lin was really that capable.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. \u201cShanghai is still alright for now. There will be opportunities in the future. But don\u2019t worry, Mayor Zhang. Zhongzhou is my hometown. I will definitely return.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good. For our Zhongzhou to have produced a man like Master Lin, we can be proud wherever we go. Sometimes, I even benefit thanks to you,\u201d said Mayor Zhang with a laugh.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, Mayor Zhang really knows how to joke.\u201d Lin Fan laughed.</p><br/><p>They continued to chat joyously. When Mayor Zhang had found out about Master Lin\u2019s return, he had immediately come over because he wanted to get Master Lin to stay in Zhongzhou. After all, this Master Lin was an incredible individual.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, I shan\u2019t bother you any further. When there\u2019s an opportunity, we have to arrange a meet-up, Master Lin,\u201d said Mayor Zhang.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, anytime is fine,\u201d replied Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>After Mayor Zhang left, the whole place was silent.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan saw the situation and didn\u2019t know what to do either. Then, he quickly gestured towards the four ladies to go to the private room next door. As for this place, he would leave it to his parents to settle things.</p></div>\n</div>"}

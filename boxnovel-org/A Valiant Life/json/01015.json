Initially, he would have casually used his kick to handle such an irascible guy.</p><br/><p>But he hadn\u2019t expected that Shanghai was so small and his circle of friends was so big. He wasn\u2019t required to do anything himself and he let the guy\u2019s father handle it instead.</p><br/><p>Although he wasn\u2019t too bothered by it, Huang Yang Shan naturally knew the severity of the matter. Since they knew each other, they had to keep it between themselves. Huang Yang Shan knew about Lin Fan\u2019s temper and what Lin Fan despised as well.</p><br/><p>Huang Yang Shan\u2019s own brat had done such a thing and that had worsened Master Lin\u2019s impression of him. How could he stand that?</p><br/><p>To Lin Fan, it seemed that that guy was in for another session of whipping when they went home.</p><br/><p>As for how bad it would be, it was heard to say. Even if that guy didn\u2019t die from the whipping, he would at least lose a layer of skin.</p><br/><p>In the car, Lin Fan felt that the car didn\u2019t feel right. It wasn\u2019t running smoothly. Although he hadn\u2019t shown any signs of heartache before, now that no one was around, his heart ached very much because his car had been damaged.</p><br/><p>He immediately made a call to his brother.</p><br/><p>\u201cMing Yang, something big has happened,\u201d Lin Fan sighed helplessly as the call was answered.</p><br/><p>On the other end of the call, Wang Ming Yang really thought that there was a huge problem. He asked anxiously, \u201cWhat is it? What happened exactly?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cI had a car accident and my car has been damaged.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Wang Ming Yang heard that, he immediately had some thoughts. \u201cBrother, you\u2019re a car wrecker. Tell me, how many cars have you destroyed now. It seems that I should invest in a car company when I have the time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEnough talk. I\u2019ll get my driver to send a car to your shop. I\u2019ll get someone to drive this damaged car back tomorrow. I\u2019ll repair it and drive it myself.\u201d</p><br/><p>Thinking about it, Wang Ming Yang couldn\u2019t bear to give up the car. Although it had been damaged, it could still be repaired and he could drive it himself. For his brother, he was very willing to do all this.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cThat\u2019s brilliant. Alright, there\u2019s nothing else. I\u2019m hanging up.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just going to\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>*Beep beep!*</p><br/><p>Lin Fan didn\u2019t wait for Wang Ming Yang to nag at him and immediately hung up. With their relationship, they didn\u2019t need all those fake formalities. He could just say what he needed to say bluntly.</p><br/><p>After parking the car, Lin Fan stood in the public square where people came and went. His eyes swept his surroundings.</p><br/><p>Although it wasn\u2019t so easy to meet someone who met the requirements, there were many of them. It was just that he would miss them sometimes.</p><br/><p>At that moment, a figure drew his attention.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t because that person met the requirements of the task, but he felt it was a little strange. A small girl was standing at the entrance of KFC, holding a metal bowl in her hand and asking the passersby for money.</p><br/><p>But not many people gave her money. The passersby seemed very annoyed and they all avoided her.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan stood there for a while. His meddlesome heart started beating quickly again. Then, he walked towards the young lady.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle sister, what are you doing? Where are the adults in your family?\u201d he came to the little girl and bent down as he asked.</p><br/><p>The little girl looked at Lin Fan. A timid look appeared on her not-so-clean face. Then, she lowered her head and wanted to leave.</p><br/><p>However, Lin Fan pulled her back.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle sister, I\u2019m a good person. Can you tell me where are your parents? Why are you here alone asking for money?\u201d Lin Fan asked with a gentle smile. This kind of situation wasn\u2019t uncommon in Shanghai. However, one wouldn\u2019t see it if he or she wasn\u2019t paying attention.</p><br/><p>The little girl didn\u2019t say a single word. She just lowered her head and held on to the metal bowl in her hands.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the little girl and didn\u2019t ask more. He could already tell. \u201cAlright, big brother will bring you to the police station, okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, brother, what are you doing? Don\u2019t stick your nose where it doesn\u2019t belong.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, a hand was placed on Lin Fan\u2019s shoulder. That person\u2019s tone wasn\u2019t friendly. In fact, it was threatening.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs there something wrong with you? Do you know this kid?\u201d A young man grabbed onto the little girl\u2019s collar, then glared at Lin Fan. \u201cDon\u2019t be nosy.\u201d</p><br/><p>After saying that, he looked around before wanting to bring the little girl away from here.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan took a step forward and grabbed the man\u2019s wrist. It was so painful that the man immediately released his grip. \u201cOuch! What are you doing? Let go of me!\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, two other men came over. One of them was trying to pull Lin Fan back. \u201cWhat are you doing? This is a public place. Why are you fighting?\u201d</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, the other man wanted to take the little girl and run away from this place. However, to Lin Fan, if anyone on this planet could take away someone who he didn\u2019t want to be taken away, it would simply be like seeing a ghost. It was not possible.</p><br/><p>He immediately pushed the two men away and grabbed that man who was holding on to the little girl. With a ferocious blow, he struck the man to the ground. \u201cWhat are you doing? Did I let you bring the girl away?\u201d</p><br/><p>The other two men panicked when they saw this. They looked at each other before nodding. It was as if they hadn\u2019t expected there to be someone so meddlesome.</p><br/><p>When people saw this situation, who wouldn\u2019t know what was going on with the child? But why did no one care? Could it be that they really didn\u2019t understand the situation?</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just asking for death.\u201d The two men charged up and wanted to beat Lin Fan to the ground.</p><br/><p>But to Lin Fan, he only needed one finger to crush these people.</p><br/><p>*Bam!*</p><br/><p>In the blink of an eye, Lin Fan used his martial arts to take down both of these men. They laid on the ground, hugging their legs and groaning in pain.</p><br/><p>The passers-by had all gathered around, wondering what had happened.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Why did they start fighting?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know but it looks like it was for that little girl.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know that little girl. She\u2019s always here begging. I feel like this girl has been manipulated by someone.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis person is way too daring. He even dares to meddle with such things. Those people have accomplices. Isn\u2019t he afraid of others taking revenge on him?\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, Lin Fan took out his phone and dialed 110.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello, police. I want to make a report. There\u2019s someone manipulating a child beggar. I suspect that this child was kidnapped and sold.\u201d</p><br/><p>The police replied, \u201cWe can\u2019t handle this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was startled. \u201cWhy can\u2019t you handle it?\u201d</p><br/><p>The police answered, \u201cI\u2019ll give you a phone number. This kind of matter has to be handled by them.\u201d</p><br/><p>*Clatter!*</p><br/><p>Lin Fan immediately hung up and gave Liu Xiao Tian a call. He explained what had happened.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, are you Master Lin?\u201d At that moment, the surrounding people recognized him.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded at the crowd. Then, he patted the little girl\u2019s head. \u201cIt\u2019s fine. Since you\u2019ve met me, nothing will be a problem anymore.\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

What he saw was unbelievable.</p><br/><p>The first place on Weibo's trending list was 'Celebrity Family'.</p><br/><p>'An awesome man put Li Mu Ze and Lu Dao Ren in their place.'</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The comments section below was also in an uproar.</p><br/><p>\"After watching 'Celebrity Family' halfway yesterday, I realized that there was something wrong with the tempo of the show.\"</p><br/><p>\"I was too stunned. Li Mu Ze and Lu Dao Ren are simply too embarrassing.\"</p><br/><p>\"Who is Master Lin? He's too d*mn awesome. He actually scolded the both of them. He must be looking for trouble.\"</p><br/><p>\"It was hilarious. Li Mu Ze was extremely proud of his taekwondo but he was trashed by him. It was simply hilarious.\"</p><br/><p>\"Li Mu Ze is so vain. He actually said he was the most good-looking person and he got humiliated by Master Lin. Yang Tao had an advantage but he still acted like he was at a disadvantage. But I've always thought that Yang Tao is better looking than Li Mu Ze.\"</p><br/><p>\"Haha, Master Lin gave an interesting and meaningful fortune-telling session. Li Mu Ze and Lu Dao Ren were previously backstabbers. They were the type that backstabbed their friends just to please their girls. Master Lin must have used this to infuriate them.\"</p><br/><p>\"These two fellas are so disgusting. This third episode is simply too amazing. It feels so good watching it.\"</p><br/><p>\"I went to search up 'Master Lin' and the results are unbelievable. I didn't know Master Lin was so famous.\"</p><br/><p>\"I already knew who he was. He's Master Lin from Cloud Street. He is pretty famous in Shanghai. Especially the craze about his scallion pancakes. You have to queue up for them and it's not guaranteed that you'd get them.\"</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>The online discussions were getting more intense.</p><br/><p>Li Mu Ze's team.</p><br/><p>\"What can I do now? Tell me, what can I do?\" Li Mu Ze shouted. He saw all the online comments. Many of them were laughing at him and humiliating him.</p><br/><p>The manager frowned. \"We're in trouble this time. However, there's something wrong with this. We have to quickly improve our public relations. If not, there'd be no way out.\"</p><br/><p>The other team members were also helpless. They couldn't think of anything at all.</p><br/><p>Li Mu Ze replied, \"Too much, this fella is simply too much. It was so d*mn embarrassing. He beat me to the ground and humiliated me. Even though Lu Dao Ren is in the same boat as me, everyone's talking about me now. Please, think of something!\"</p><br/><p>The manager was deep in thought. Suddenly, he smiled. \"Right! Isn't this a variety show? We can use\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Li Mu Ze was pleasantly surprised after hearing what the manager said. He felt that this suggestion was good.</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>The production team.</p><br/><p>\"Insane! It's so insane! The viewership rating is out. It's even higher than the past two episodes. And it's so much higher!\"</p><br/><p>Director Hu was stunned. \"Really? It's that good?\"</p><br/><p>\"It's not just that. The online broadcast almost reached a hundred million people. It's unbelievable.\"</p><br/><p>Director Hu replied, \"Alright, we've done such a good job this week. I believe the leaders must be ecstatic too. We've distinguished ourselves from the other variety shows. We're the best!\"</p><br/><p>\"Director Hu, I looked up on something. In the past, Shanghai's Television invited Master Lin on the second episode of Northern and Southern Gambling Kings. The viewership rating was insane too. This time, Master Lin attended our variety show. Why do I feel like as long as Master Lin joins something, the viewership rating would definitely be soaring.\"</p><br/><p>Director Hu paused for a moment. \"Really? Looks like we have to research it. But for now, let's not think about it. We have to celebrate today's results. Just check what's happening on the Internet.\"</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was stunned at what had happened. Then, he smiled. This was insane. The number of Weibo followers had increased again. Perhaps he had become one of the more popular online celebrities.</p><br/><p>There were so many new followers and Lin Fan wanted to greet them. Then, he posted something.</p><br/><p>\"Hello to all new followers!\"</p><br/><p>In the past, he had only had a few followers on Weibo. Now, he had over two million followers. It was such a rapid improvement.</p><br/><p>When the post was published, the comments started to appear rapidly. Lin Fan opened them happily. He thought that the new fans were worshipping him like a God. But when he opened the comments section, he realized that something was wrong.</p><br/><p>\"F*ck your mom. How could you scold my Mu Ze?\"</p><br/><p>\"Mu Ze was just being nice to you. How could you do anything to our Mu Ze with your useless skills?\"</p><br/><p>\"You still dared to be angry at our Mu Ze and Dao Ren. Looks like you're an idiot.\"</p><br/><p>\"You must have ganged up with others that were jealous of Mu Ze and purposely made things difficult for him.\"</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was furious when he saw these comments. It looked like a war was about to happen.</p><br/><p>Then, he immediately made a call.</p><br/><p>Autumn Sword Fish Killer was still sleeping. He had only managed to fall asleep late last night. He dreamt that he had successfully lost weight and he had a superb figure. There were a lot of pretty ladies around him.</p><br/><p>*Ding ding!*</p><br/><p>The unwelcomed sound rang. Autumn Sword Fish Killer opened his eyes slowly. He was a little upset. But when he saw who was calling, he was shocked. He realized that he had a 'boss' now.</p><br/><p>He picked up the call.</p><br/><p>Autumn Sword Fish Killer said, \"Boss, what is it?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \"Start a war now. My Weibo just got attacked. Please get your army of trolls here.\"</p><br/><p>When Autumn Sword Fish Killer heard that there was going to be a war, his eyes lit up. He touched his peanut-sized p*nis and tried to wake himself up. He wore his clothes and washed up. \"Boss, I'll be there soon.\"</p><br/><p>After hanging up.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan realized that the situation on Weibo was getting more intense. Then, he went to look at Li Mu Ze and Lu Dao Ren's Weibo but there was nothing happening.</p><br/><p>But he felt that something intense was about to happen.</p><br/><p>He looked at the time and it was almost 8 AM. He immediately left for Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>He reached the shop.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan and the rest gathered around, \"We all read the news. Your Weibo has been attacked by the fans of those celebrities. The situation doesn't look good. Do you want to shut down your Weibo?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled confidently. \"There's no need for that. It's just a war. There's nothing to fear. There will be someone joining me later.\"</p><br/><p>Weibo.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan's loyal fans weren't able to cope with the sudden firepower from the fans of the other celebrities. They were extremely stunned.</p><br/><p>At that exact moment.</p><br/><p>An ID suddenly appeared. The ID made them feel like there was hope.</p><br/><p>Master Lin's Weibo's one and only God, the Flame War Emperor, had risen again after disappearing for a very long time.</p><br/><p>...</p><br/>\n</div>"}

When she appeared in the broadcast room, she would gain everyone's attention. She was a Goddess, indeed. </p><br/><p>She was even prettier than some of the popular female anchors. </p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang felt suddenly that his existence was so small. Previously, his fans loved to watch him boast but now, all his fans wanted to watch Master Lin and their goddess instead. What was even more frightening was that these fans even liked Fraud Tian, who sat at the entrance smoking every day. </p><br/><p>He understood why he wasn't as popular as Master Lin and Wu You Lan, but he did not understand why he couldn't even be compared to Fraud Tian. When Fraud Tian opened his mouth, all it showed was a row of yellow teeth. Zhao Zhong Yang really couldn't accept it. </p><br/><p>The fans requested to see Fraud Tian, so Zhao Zhong Yang went to the entrance and pointed his camera towards him. </p><br/><p>The initial silly expression of Fraud Tian turned into a deep expression when he discovered the camera. His cigarette in his hand was left with the stub only. </p><br/><p>Zhong Zhong Yang looked at the comments and the gifts sent and did not know what to say. What did the fans nowadays like to watch? Even when Fraud Tian did not speak a word, the fans were still so excited.</p><br/><p>\"Wah, he's so handsome. His stance when he's smoking is so imposing.\"</p><br/><p>\"That expression in his eyes shows how much he has experienced throughout his life.\"</p><br/><p>\"Enough said, I will send some rockets\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian smoked one puff, threw the cigarette stub under his feet, and spat his phlegm. With his hoarse voice, he said, \"I was once undefeatable on this Earth. I hugged beautiful girls too but with the times changing, I'm becoming useless and old.\" </p><br/><p>Everyone in the broadcast became excited as it was their first-time hearing Fraud Tian speak.</p><br/><p>\"666\u2026I told you all, he is a great man. Look at that expression in his eyes, he must have experienced a lot.\"</p><br/><p>\"I feel like becoming his disciple.\"</p><br/><p>\"There can be nothing we can do with the changing of times. Even with skills, we will still be useless. This is a tragic truth.\"</p><br/><p>\"Idol, don't say anymore. I will send you a gift\u2026\" </p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang was shocked. This guy's bragging was flawless. What an actor.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian stood up, held his hands behind his back and walked towards the house\u2026</p><br/><p>This consistent style of his made the fans become obsessed. Zhao Zhong Yang was shocked. He couldn't help but sigh as he could not even compare to Fraud Tian\u2026 </p><br/><p>At this moment, Zhao Zhong Yang saw a bunch of reporters walking towards the house. Then, he shouted towards the inside of the house.</p><br/><p>\"There are reporters coming!\" </p><br/><p>Lin Fan was playing with 'Arena of Valor' on his handphone. He was fully immersed in it. When he heard Zhao Zhong Yang's voice, he was startled. </p><br/><p>Why are the reporters here again? </p><br/><p>When the reporters reached the entrance, it was confirmed that these reporters were here for him again. Many townsfolk also surrounded the entrance.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan asked, \"What are you all doing here?\" </p><br/><p>This time, the reporters acted a little different. They came fully equipped and did not crowd up to him to interview him. It was as if they were shooting some show. </p><br/><p>At this moment, a middle-aged man walked in, looked at Lin Fan and initiated a handshake.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan felt suspicious but shook his hand. Lin Fan asked, \"You are?\"</p><br/><p>Chief Zhong replied politely, \"Hi Master Lin, I am the chairman of Supreme Tiger Electronic Fingerprint Doors, Zhang Zhong Ming. I am here to issue you a challenge.\" </p><br/><p>Lin Fan did not expect that they would personally visit him. </p><br/><p>According to normal situations, the matter should have been over.</p><br/><p>Chief Zhong continued, \"Master Lin, you said in the broadcast that you can unlock the fingerprint doors in 10 minutes. I do not believe this, so this time, I have brought a sample of the door to let you try to unlock it. If you can unlock it, I will give you $2 million as your reward.\"</p><br/><p>The reporter said, \"Master Lin, this is a live broadcast. Will you accept Chief Zhong's challenge?\" </p><br/><p>Lin Fan was shocked and did not imagine that such a thing would happen. </p><br/><p>Meanwhile, on some online website. </p><br/><p>Many netizens are watching the live broadcast.</p><br/><p>\"This time, Supreme Tiger Electronic Fingerprint Doors are personally going to announce their challenge, what do you think will happen?\"</p><br/><p>\"Hehe, what else can happen? They will lose. What on earth can stop Master Lin?\"</p><br/><p>\"This broadcast's influence is huge, and it will affect Supreme Tiger Electronic Fingerprint Doors a lot.\"</p><br/><p>\"I realized that this has no connections to Master Lin at all. I think this must be the doing of some other locks company.\"</p><br/><p>\"I think so too, even if that video broadcast was popular, it can't have been so popular that everyone is aware of it. It must be the doing of someone trying to pull Supreme Tiger Electronic Fingerprint Doors down.\"</p><br/><p>\"This Supreme Tiger Electronic Fingerprint Doors is so unlucky. This was a top-selling product but they've met someone terrifying like Master Lin.\" </p><br/><p>Inside the broadcast room.</p><br/><p>\"666\u2026finally something interesting is about to happen. Brother Yang is on the site having a live broadcast too. We are so lucky.\"</p><br/><p>\"This Supreme Tiger Electronic Fingerprint Doors is about to become a tragedy. They actually dared to visit Lin Fan upfront to declare their challenge. This chairman must be someone who hates losing.\"</p><br/><p>\"What are you all talking about? I'm new here and just followed Brother Yang. Is this Brother Yang's live broadcast? What is happening now?\"</p><br/><p>\"Newbie, come over. I will explain to you.\"</p><br/><p>\u2026 </p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at Chief Zhong and turned to look at the reporters. They were serious about this challenge. </p><br/><p>The Supreme Tiger Electronic Fingerprint Doors was the top product in their industry. However, unlocking it was not difficult. </p><br/><p>Also, since this $2 million came up to his door by itself, it would be a waste for him to not take it.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled, \"Sure, I will accept this challenge.\"</p><br/><p>Chief Zhong nodded, \"Don't worry Master Lin, I brought the $2 million. No matter what the result is, I will accept it. However, I believe in my product.\" </p><br/><p>Chief Zhong's attitude was good, so Lin Fan didn't want to embarrass him. Also, he was aware of the situation on the internet. The impact of this challenge was going to be big. </p><br/><p>The Supreme Tiger employees brought a new fingerprint door and placed it at the store's entrance. </p><br/><p>More citizens surrounded the shop and started discussing. </p><br/><p>The reporters were very excited.</p><br/><p>A reporter asked, \"Chief Zhong, are you nervous now? If Master Lin really unlocks the Supreme Tiger Electronic Fingerprint Door, it will affect your company greatly.\"</p><br/><p>Chief Zhong replied, \"I am a little nervous but I believe in my company's product. Being affected by external situations is what each company will face. We can only improve if we know where the mistake lies.\" </p><br/><p>At this moment, several chairmen of different lock companies were also watching the broadcast. </p><br/><p>Yue Xin Locks, which was also a big lock company had been waiting for this moment. If Master Lin were to unlock the Supreme Tiger Electronic Fingerprint Door, this would affect the Supreme Tiger greatly. Their market capital would then drop and they could use this opportunity to take over the market. </p><br/><p>This time, since Supreme Tiger Electronic Fingerprint Doors got involved in this incident, they naturally used this chance to expand their influence.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian asked, \"Are you confident?\" </p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled but did not speak a word. He touched the Supreme Tiger Electronic Fingerprint Door, the texture of the copper door made Lin Fan a little fearful.</p><br/><p>At the same time, Chief Zhong prepared the toolbox for the lockpicking and left it at the side. The employees of Supreme Tiger held their breath while they waited for the result.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Their many hours of hope were all gone in a second.</p><br/><p>The Encyclopedia was indeed very reliable. It even had a backup plan ready. It was as if it knew something like that would happen.</p><br/><p>He knew that the Web Supervisors did not actually want to investigate him. They were just going through the motion. They were personally people with a huge sense of justice. They knew that many of these cases required evidence from the net. However, for this matter, they were secretly praising Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>If they were really to conduct their investigation, it would definitely not be as simple as crafting a few sentences.</p><br/><p>As the Web Supervisors were leaving, Li Xiangrong patted Lin Fan on his shoulders, \"All the best. Please don't learn from 'Heavenly Wolf Dog' and use your abilities for dishonest practices.\"</p><br/><p>'Heavenly Wolf Dog' got unjustly wronged.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed, \"I have always been a good citizen.\"</p><br/><p>After sending the Web Supervisors out the door, he collapsed on his sofa and let out a huge sigh. A huge smile emerged on his face. Even though he was only left with 18 Encyclopedic points, it had all been worth it.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Wang Ming Yang was ringing him.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang said, \"Brother, is everything fine on your side? I read on Weibo that the Web Supervisors went to look for you?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan gripped his phone and laughed out loud, \"No problem. How can a good citizen like me have any problems?\"</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang: \"That's good to hear. I was all prepared to use my name to bail you out.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled, \"Bail my a*s. Would a good citizen like me ever do anything against the law? I didn't deliberately download those videos.\"</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang replied with a cunning laugh, \"If I trust you, I must be possessed.\"</p><br/><p>He hung up the call. Before long, another call came in.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian said, \"How was it? There's nothing wrong right?\"</p><br/><p>A sequence of expressions burst out of Lin Fan, \"Sigh\u2026 It's a tragedy. I might have to go to jail\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"Ah\u2026\" Fraud Tian was shocked. After which, he replied, \"No worries. You can go. I'll take care of the shop for you.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan: \"...\"</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian didn't have a single bit of worry. He didn't even give any thought on how to save Lin Fan. He really was a dog.</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>The next day.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was no longer following the issue on Weibo. The rest of the situation was up to the officials to deal with. This was the most he could do.</p><br/><p>However, Xia Yi Mo sent him a private message. She was showing her appreciation towards him, and at the same time, she reported something to him.</p><br/><p>She had been sabotaged by Jiang Li and Chen Juan and had been expelled. After Starlight Film School did some investigation, she was allowed back into the school and was also given some form of compensation. At the same time, they shouldered the responsibility for the losses that Xia Yi Mo had suffered as a result of the Weibo incident.</p><br/><p>Jiang Li and Chen Juan dealt with the matter very swiftly. There was quite a lot of information available on the videos and it involved even more people. However, in order to settle the public opinions, Starlight Film School didn't dare to procrastinate any longer. At this point, it wasn't a matter of just trying to suppress the issue as and when they liked, but it was to give the followers some sort of notice. At the same time, the higher-ups looked at this matter very seriously. This gave Starlight Film School a lot of pressure. Jiang Li and Chen Juan were stripped of their positions and were subjected to investigation. It was the end for these two people. It didn't matter how large of a support they had, it was of no use. Under such circumstances, no one dared to take any risks.</p><br/><p>Inside the shop.</p><br/><p>Elder Dog Nicholas was lying atop Lin Fan's legs with his eyes closed. It was quietly laying there.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was using his phone. Originally, his follower count on Weibo had dropped tremendously, but now, it had increased significantly. He now had three million followers!</p><br/><p>\"Hehe, I'm now an Internet celebrity!\"</p><br/><p>However, he knew that his follower count would drop again. It was only for this period when he had gained the attention of many netizens that he gained so many followers. It wouldn't be long before his follower count would drop once more.</p><br/><p>He was no celebrity, nor did he have any entertainment skills. He also wasn't an entertaining Internet star. He knew that he would be forgotten by the netizens without anything to attract their attention.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Zhao Zhong Yang took out his phone and went over to Lin Fan. \"Master Lin! I, as your fan, would like to give thanks to you!\"</p><br/><p>Since he was bored, he decided to do a broadcast. As soon as the live stream display popped up, his audience started sending gifts.</p><br/><p>\"I finally get to see my Master Lin. How exciting!\"</p><br/><p>\"Say no more. I've sent a gift. Master Lin is way too domineering.\"</p><br/><p>\"666\u2026I have been following this issue from the beginning to the end. Only Master Lin dared to challenge them. He is a true warrior.\"</p><br/><p>\"Master Lin, I'm a pretty girl. I like you. I have a great figure. I have a D cup. I can let you get real comfortable. Do you want to be my boyfriend?\"</p><br/><p>\"666\u2026young girl, if Master Lin is not willing, I am.\"</p><br/><p>Little Brother also wants to be God Hao: \"Master Lin, thank you so much! After roaming around in the garden for two days, I have finally found my significant other and have since left the single life!\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan finally spoke on his live stream. \"Congratulations to this 'Little Brother also wants to be God Hao' on finding his significant other! It seems that my predictions are still pretty accurate.\"</p><br/><p>Little Brother also wants to be God Hao: \"Say no more. During this month, even if I have to eat dirt, I will send a hundred rockets to show my appreciation to you, Master Lin.\"</p><br/><p>Master Lin clapped his hands. \"No need to send gifts. Save the money for dating use. When dating, money is a must. If you really must send, just one will do.\"</p><br/><p>Little Brother also wants to be God Hao: \"Much thanks to Master Lin for your understanding. One is definitely not enough. I'll send 10 first. I'll top up the rest another time.\"</p><br/><p>10 rockets started flying.</p><br/><p>One rocket already cost 500 dollars. 'Little Brother also wants to be God Hao' had used 5000 dollars in a blink of an eye. From Lin Fan's point of view, doing live streams could sometimes be a great way to earn money. This was because they were all imaginary goods. You don't feel a thing when sending them. However, if it were actual cash, it would be a different story.</p><br/><p>\"666, Little Brother is really talented.\"</p><br/><p>\"Master Lin is a really good person, unlike other broadcasters. They only want gifts.\"</p><br/><p>\"Master Lin I beg you to help me read my fortune. I have already been alone for thirty years. I have already mastered all my skills, but now I just need to find love.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed, \"Sorry everyone, if you want your marriage fate to be read, you can come down to Shanghai Cloud Street, Shop No. 8861 to find Master Lin. I will be waiting here for anyone to visit.\"</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhongyang was watching from the corner and he was very envious of Master Lin. He realized that even on his own live stream, Master Lin was more welcomed that himself. He then looked at the lens and mumbled, \"You all don't love me anymore. You'll be losing this baby soon.\"</p><br/><p>The sad expression on Zhao Zhongyang caused some of the audience to laugh out loud.</p><br/><p>Little Brother also wants to be God Hao: \"Brother Yang, my gift is for Master Lin. Don't use it for your own selfish reasons.\"</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhongyang slapped his own forehead, displaying his grief. \"You actually dare to think that I would use Master Lin's gift for my own selfish reasons? You've really hurt me\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"666\u2026Brother Yang, don't cry.\"</p><br/><p>\"Brother God Hao, your words are too honest. Look what you've done! You've hurt Brother Yang.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed while looking at this discussion. At that moment, Elder Dog Nicholas woke up. He lifted his head and looked directly at the live stream. His eyes were lifeless as if he had just woken up.</p><br/><p>The netizens watching the live stream went crazy after seeing Elder Dog Nicholas. The gifts kept coming in.</p><br/><p>\"Brother Yang, this gift is for Elder Dog. Don't you dare snatch it from him.\"</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhongyang: \"...\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed. However, at this moment, he looked out and saw that something had happened.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

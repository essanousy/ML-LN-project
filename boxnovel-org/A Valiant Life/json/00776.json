I haven\u2019t seen him the whole day. It can\u2019t be that someone has turned him into hot pot, can it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Just as Lin Fan was cursing, a little silhouette appeared in his view.</p><br/><p>Woof woof~</p><br/><p>Elder Dog\u2019s voice rang out but when the shop owners and townsfolk saw this dirty little dog, they were stunned. Where did this dog come from?</p><br/><p>They couldn\u2019t be blamed for not recognizing him. In that state, even Lin Fan couldn\u2019t recognize Elder Dog.</p><br/><p>He was so dirty that it was a little scary.</p><br/><p>Elder Dog came to the shop entrance delightedly as if he hadn\u2019t noticed everyone\u2019s gazes.</p><br/><p>Woof woof~</p><br/><p>Elder Dog stood in front of Lin Fan and barked cheerfully.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was cursing in his heart. Then, he said, \u201cTell me, what did you do? How did you become like this? You didn\u2019t go to play in the mud, did you??\u201d</p><br/><p>Woof woof~</p><br/><p>He had done a good deed. Of course, he had to let it be known.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Lin Fan and Elder Dog\u2019s hearts became linked. In an instant, Lin Fan\u2019s expression changed.</p><br/><p>He understood now and he was speechless.</p><br/><p>This d*mned dog has done a good deed for the first time?</p><br/><p>In the past, he would only lie in the shop and rest. It was the same Elder Dog who would not do anything at all in the past.</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan found out that Elder Dog had run into a fire to save that infant under the eyes of the crowd, he didn\u2019t know what to say.</p><br/><p>However, it had been beautifully done. But Lin Fan definitely would not allow this d*mned dog to be too proud. Looking at that proud and satisfied expression on Elder Dog\u2019s face, Lin Fan felt that it was really asking for a beating.</p><br/><p>\u201cStop bragging. Are you trying to defy nature? Why didn\u2019t you just jump straight from the 21st floor, do a 360-degree flip and land firmly on the ground? You would have been able to announce your existence to the world and people would capture you. They would also dissect you for research.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said all this, but in his heart, he was shocked beyond belief.</p><br/><p>He had not expected Elder Dog to be so valiant.</p><br/><p>His speed had increased and so had his strength. Even his fire-resistance had increased.</p><br/><p>It seemed that the Great Animal Spell had not been useless.</p><br/><p>Also, what was inconceivable to Lin Fan was that the \u2018Righteous Pet Food\u2019 seemed to have benefitted Elder Dog plentifully.</p><br/><p>\u201cAhh, what happened to this dog? How did he become like this?\u201d Fraud Tian was startled when he saw Elder Dog. Was this still the same white dog that he knew?</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan squatted down and checked on Elder Dog. \u201cBrother Lin, Elder Dog\u2019s fur looks like it\u2019s been burnt. Just what on earth happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd his paws look like they\u2019ve been scalded.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing what Wu You Lan said and seeing Elder Dog\u2019s state, Lin Fan sighed helplessly. He stared at Elder Dog Nicholas.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe cost of you acting awesome is pretty high. You Lan, bring some water over and wash him up. And bring scissors too. His fur has to be trimmed a little,\u201d said Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d Without a second thought, Wu You Lan quickly went to get water. Elder Dog was a member of their team. Now that he had become like this after going out for a while, something major must have happened.</p><br/><p>To Wu You Lan, this must have been the work of humans. Elder Dog was so smart, how could he have brought suffering on himself?</p><br/><p>However, she didn\u2019t know who it was that abused this little dog.</p><br/><p>Elder Dog wasn\u2019t that big, how could he take such abuse? If she found out who it was who caused this, she would teach that person a lesson.</p><br/><p>The shop owners.</p><br/><p>Elder Liang said, \u201cLittle Boss, how did Elder Dog become like this? He\u2019s unrecognizable.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled, \u201cHe went and became a hero. How could he not be a little hurt?\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Liang was taken aback. Without thinking much, he said, \u201cA hero? What hero?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLook at the news tonight. He has really done it this time.\u201d Lin Fan predicted that the whole nation would find out about this. Anything else wouldn\u2019t be right in view of what Elder Dog had done.</p><br/><p>However, he had not expected Elder Dog to spontaneously go saving someone. Could it have been because of the \u2018Righteous Pet Food\u2019 taking effect?</p><br/><p>That was very possible.</p><br/><p>If he had used the \u2018Evil Pet Food instead, perhaps Elder Dog would have become cruel and violent and he would have gone to harm other people.</p><br/><p>Very soon, all the preparations were complete.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan moved the stool over and sat down. \u201cCome here quickly. It\u2019s time for a shower.\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Dog barked, \u201cQuick, praise me. Praise me.\u201d</p><br/><p>His expression was filled with anticipation.</p><br/><p>Other people couldn\u2019t understand what Elder Dog had said but how could Lin Fan not understand?</p><br/><p>\u201cF*cking awesome. Brilliant. You saved someone, Righteous Elder Dog. You\u2019re the best. Is that enough?\u201d Lin Fan didn\u2019t know what else to say. Things had gotten big. Although the news wasn\u2019t out yet, it would definitely be out by nighttime.</p><br/><p>When it came out, Lin Fan already knew that it was going to be an earth-shattering, major incident.</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s see if anyone will recognize him.</p><br/><p>However, it would be best if no one recognized him. Otherwise, things would become noisy again.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow dirty are you?\u201d Upon placing Elder Dog in the basin of water, the clear water instantly turned black.</p><br/><p>Elder Dog let out a few sounds as this happened. It was too comfortable.</p><br/><p>\u201cBring some more water. Looks like one basin isn\u2019t going to be enough. Then, he turned to Elder Dog and said, \u201cYou can consider your whole life to have been worth it. Not many people have the opportunity to be given a bath personally by this Master. You\u2019re the first dog.\u201d</p><br/><p>After washing him four or five times, Lin Fan had made Elder Dog sparkling clean.</p><br/><p>However, there were some problems with his fur.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan took the scissors and cut off the fur that had curled up due to the burns.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was wondering how strong Elder Dog was exactly. If it had been a fire, how could it be that the only thing that had happened to Elder Dog was his fur curling up? His body\u2019s durability was very great.</p><br/><p>*splash*</p><br/><p>Elder Dog played around in the water. His little paws hit the water surface, causing the water to splash everywhere.</p><br/><p>\u201cStop moving. I\u2019m cutting your fur.\u201d Lin Fan grabbed onto the Elder Dog\u2019s head and started cutting his fur. *kacha kacha* The fur that had curled up was being cut off</p><br/><p>When Elder Dog heard that Lin Fan was cutting his fur, he panicked and barked.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t. If you cut my fur, I won\u2019t look good anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan knocked Elder Dog\u2019s head. \u201cIf you want to look good, why did you go in in the first place? Stop moving. If you keep moving, there\u2019ll be blood.\u201d</p><br/><p>The shop owners cried out in shock.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Boss has started talking to the dog again. I really envy his ability.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if you envy him, you won\u2019t gain his ability.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Nighttime.</p><br/><p>He closed the shop.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan brought Elder Dog home with him.</p><br/><p>He had to study Elder Dog properly tonight. As of now, he still couldn\u2019t quite figure out the situation with Elder Dog. If he could figure it out, he would be delighted.</p><br/><p>8 pm.</p><br/><p>He turned on the television.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood evening, fellow friends and viewers. Up next, we will be broadcasting an impromptu piece of news. In the afternoon today, a fire broke out in a residential flat along Shanghai\u2019s Lanling Road. fortunately, no one was hurt. However, during the rescue, a shocking thing happened. An infant had been left home alone on the 21st floor with no one supervising him. He had not escaped the fire at first but just as everyone was on the verge of hopelessness, a miraculous scene occurred. Please look at the news coming up next.\u201d</p><br/><p>The image on the screen changed. The television showed the scene on the site.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis fire is quite severe,\u201d Lin Fan gasped in shock.</p><br/><p>As Elder Dog looked at the figure on the screen, he started barking ecstatically.</p><br/><p>\u201cLook! That\u2019s me\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cI know it\u2019s you. Don\u2019t be too proud.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p></div>\n</div>"}

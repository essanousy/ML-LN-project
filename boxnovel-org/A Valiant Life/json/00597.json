He hurriedly waved his hand and said, \u201cMaster Lin, I won\u2019t take the card back. I know that you don\u2019t think much of money but I also know that you have taken over a Children\u2019s Welfare Institute. I don\u2019t usually do good deeds but please just accept it as my way of helping those children.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis\u2026\u201d Lin Fan thought about it for a moment.</p><br/><p>The surrounding shop owners said, \u201cLittle Boss, why don\u2019t you just accept it? This kid is pretty good. He has some kindness in him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, the Children\u2019s Welfare Institute requires some money to run as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou donated the extra funds raised from the art sale the last time. The Children\u2019s Welfare Institute will definitely need more money in future. This will help to solve some issues.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded, \u201cThen I shall accept it. I will pass on your goodwill.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was ten million dollars. If he didn\u2019t accept it, it would have been a waste.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian watched as Lin Fan kept the bank card in his pocket. He was dying of envy.</p><br/><p>This money was too easily earned.</p><br/><p>Chang Hai He let out a deep breath. Although those ten million dollars were all the circulating money he had, he didn\u2019t bother much about money.</p><br/><p>His father was a high-ranking official and his mother was a business expert. Although there were rules that there cannot be government officials and business people in the same family, his mother had already started a huge family business before she had gotten together with his father.</p><br/><p>Hence, his allowance was quite high. Starting companies was like a game to him.</p><br/><p>These ten million dollars were indeed painstakingly earned himself. The circulating funds from the company were all in that card.</p><br/><p>Ever since Lin Fan had gotten his godly medical skills, there had been many things added to his shop. Chang Hai Ge\u2019s injury was indeed very severe. Using modern medicine to treat him would definitely result in him being crippled.</p><br/><p>However, as compared to the children of the Welfare Institute, he was still much better off.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough the nerves in your legs are dead, it hasn\u2019t been too long and they can still be recovered. It isn\u2019t anything too difficult. I just hope that you will do what you have promised me. I don\u2019t like being lied to,\u201d said Lin Fan with a smile.</p><br/><p>Chang Hai Ge nodded, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Master Lin. I will definitely change as I said. I definitely will not go back on my words anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>He really wanted to change, mainly because he wanted to get to know this mystical person, Master Lin, better.</p><br/><p>With the silver needles in his hands, Lin Fan expertly placed the needles into Chang Hai Ge\u2019s legs.</p><br/><p>To activate the nerves, using only acupuncture was far from enough. He needed the Encyclopedia\u2019s mystical boost to do it.</p><br/><p>The shop owners watched from the side in wonder. To them, Little Boss\u2019s technique was amazing. When he removed the needles, he was lightning quick. It left them flabbergasted. It was too quick. It was really too quick.</p><br/><p>Chang Hai Ge had been very nervous the whole time. Then, his expression slowly changed as he said delightedly, \u201cI can feel it, I can feel it! A rush of heat is flowing into my legs.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shen Ming gasped in shock, \u201cThat\u2019s way too amazing.\u201d</p><br/><p>He knew the condition of Brother Chang\u2019s legs. The hospital\u2019s doctor had already said that these legs would be useless for the rest of his life. Who would have thought that once he came here to Master Lin, he would regain feeling in his legs? That was really shocking.</p><br/><p>As Shen Ming looked at Master Lin\u2019s eyes, a change happened in him. He realized that this Master Lin was really too mystical and he drew admiration from everyone around.</p><br/><p>\u201cTry lifting your legs,\u201d said Lin Fan as he removed the silver needles from Chang Hai Ge\u2019s legs.</p><br/><p>Chang Hai Ge was a little nervous. He gently lifted his legs and he really felt them move.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Chang Hai Ge was moved to tears. \u201cMaster Lin, my legs are well. They\u2019re really well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cThey\u2019re alright but they still need to slowly recover. I\u2019ll give you a prescription. Go back and take some medicine to nurture your body for half a month. Then, you\u2019ll be pretty much fully recovered.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chang Hai Ge nodded, \u201cMmm, I understand. But will there really be no issues in the long run, Master?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved his hand, \u201cThere won\u2019t be. Just take the prescription and get the medicine when you go back and you\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>Initially, Lin Fan could have instantly cured him but in order to make this guy suffer a little, he sneakily left our a procedure. However, Chang Hai Ge would indeed be fine if he just rested for a period of time.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you, Master,\u201d said Chang Hai Ge gratefully. He felt like hugging Master\u2019s legs as he started to weep.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved his hand and said, \u201cI\u2019ve already treated you. Next time, be more careful. I shan\u2019t make you all stay. Why don\u2019t you go back to Beijing now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan didn\u2019t want to carry on interacting with this Chang Hai Ge. They were people on very different paths. Although they might still come across each other in future, there was no need to interact any further at the moment.</p><br/><p>After Shen Ming and Chang Hai Ge left, Lin Fan couldn\u2019t help but burst out laughing as he lay on the chair.</p><br/><p>Sometimes, it was really too easy to earn money.</p><br/><p>Of course, that was on the condition that he met a nouveau riche like Chang Hai Ge.</p><br/><p>Moreover, that nouveau riche had to have come across some kind of problem.</p><br/><p>Ten million dollars to treat his legs that originally had to be amputated. Was that expensive?</p><br/><p>To normal people, that would have been very expensive but to this kind of nouveau riche, it was simply too cheap. It was so cheap that it was scary.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Fraud Tian came to Lin Fan\u2019s front. His eyes gleamed with vigor as he said, \u201cDo you think I can learn Chinese medicine?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan took a look at Fraud Tian and said, \u201cWeren\u2019t you learning fortune-telling from Elder Wu?\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian said, \u201cLearn my a*s. That\u2019s too advanced. How can I learn that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Tian He said, \u201cElder Tian, what I\u2019m teaching you is just the foundation. If you can\u2019t even learn that, how can you blame me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian said, \u201cI\u2019m not blaming you. It\u2019s just that my own foundation is too firm. It\u2019s not compatible with your foundational knowledge.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian used to swindle people. He was already too used to his way of doing things. Learning new foundations was not suitable for him.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cFraud, I think that you should just watch over the shop properly. These things aren\u2019t suitable for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, I think you\u2019re scared that once I learn it, I\u2019ll surpass you. I understand that. Geniuses are always unwelcome by others. Sigh, forget it. I, Tian, shall stick to being a low-key unrecognized talent,\u201d said Fraud Tian.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha!\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, everyone burst into laughter.</p><br/><p>*ring, ring*</p><br/><p>Zou Tian Fu\u2019s call came.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, has Chang Hai Ge gone over to your place?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMmm, I\u2019ve already seen him. He\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>On the other end of the call, there was silence. Then, there was a sigh, \u201cYou\u2019re amazing indeed.\u201d</p><br/><p>To Zou Tian Fu, this Master Lin was really very mystical and he really drew the admiration of others.</p><br/><p>Zou Tian Fu wanted to give a proper explanation for what had happened but he kept feeling as if Master Lin was deliberately trying to distance himself from him. Of course, this was just Zou Tian Fu\u2019s thoughts and he wasn\u2019t sure of it.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan had his reason for distancing himself from Zou Tian Fu. If Lin Fan were to be with this guy, there would probably be a lot of trouble.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan could tell by reading his fortune.</p><br/><p>To keep himself safe, it was best to stay away from this Young Master Zou.</p><br/><p>The two of them chatted for a while more before they hung up.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Lin Fan looked at the blue sky and white, fluffy clouds outside. These days were really very comfortable and pleasurable.</p><br/><p>Half a month later.</p><br/><p>Every day in Cloud Street was the same as usual. There was no change at all.</p><br/><p>On this day, Zhao Ming Qing came to the shop.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, the teaching materials have started being distributed to various parts of the country.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan heard this, delight appeared on his face.</p></div>\n</div>"}

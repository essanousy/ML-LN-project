Others were trying to avoid the place while this person dared to go in by himself. That was way too scary.</p><br/><p>On the path to the town, Lin Fan walked with the medicine box on his back and both hands in his pockets.</p><br/><p>Li Chong watched his back view. Then, he took out his phone and was about to take a photo. Through the lens, that back view looked rather lonely. But somehow, that back view became big and mighty as if it was bigger than the skies.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin is really worthy of respect.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing nodded. \u201cMmm, my teacher has always been like this.\u201d As he said this, he was filled with pride. After all, being able to become a disciple of such a great teacher in his old age was really a proud and fortunate thing for him.</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan entered the town, he sucked in a breath of air. He could feel the virus present in the air. Although the virus couldn\u2019t survive in the air for long, it would attach itself crazily to any living person. However, as soon as it entered Lin Fan\u2019s body, it was burnt to nothing by a burst of flames.</p><br/><p><em>What a joke. There\u2019s no way the Wuxia major class of knowledge could be so weak.</em></p><br/><p>When the townspeople discovered Lin Fan\u2019s presence, they were astonished. They had no idea how this person had managed to come in from that side. Moreover, he wasn\u2019t even wearing any protective attire. What was he here for?</p><br/><p>\u201cHello. May I know if your Mayor is around?\u201d Lin Fan asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho are you? Our Mayor Niu has been infected too. He\u2019s resting in the house now. He\u2019s a little dazed,\u201d said one of the townspeople.</p><br/><p>Hearing that his fan had become dazed, Lin Fan decided to forget about it. It seemed that he would have to rush the process a little.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh. I\u2019m here to treat your sickness. I\u2019ll see what exactly is going on with this influenza,\u201d said Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>The townspeople were taken aback. It seemed like they were in disbelief and didn\u2019t know what to say.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre there still any doctors in the clinic?\u201d asked Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, yes. But there\u2019s only one doctor left. The nurses and the other doctors have all been infected,\u201d said one of the townspeople.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan didn\u2019t ask more. He went straight towards the clinic. When he entered, he saw a doctor with weak footsteps. The doctor was wearing a mask and treating the townspeople with IV drips. Meanwhile, he had actually been infected as well but he kept on going.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. Don\u2019t worry, everyone. You will definitely be okay,\u201d said the doctor as he gave the townspeople IV drips. His voice was hoarse. Perhaps it was because he was infected or perhaps it was because he had spoken too much trying to assure the townspeople.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, you will be okay,\u201d said Lin Fan from the side.</p><br/><p>Then, the doctor looked up to see who it was. But when he saw Lin Fan\u2019s face, he was utterly shocked. He hurriedly removed his mask, revealing a flushed face as he said excitedly, \u201cMaster Lin, why are you here?\u201d</p><br/><p>He was a doctor from the city. Initially, he had worn a protective uniform to treat the townspeople but later on, after he got infected as well, he had stopped wearing it. It didn\u2019t make a difference anyway.</p><br/><p>There were very few hospital doctors now who didn\u2019t know about Master Lin. In the hearts of these basic level doctors, he was a godly doctor.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan patted the doctor\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI found out about the situation here, so I came. Alright, leave the rest to me. I\u2019ll play with this influenza and see what exactly it is. It has tortured so many people. How naughty.\u201d</p><br/><p>*Pfft!*</p><br/><p>The doctor burst into laughter after hearing what Lin Fan said. Then, his body turned soft and he fell towards the ground. Lin Fan immediately caught him and helped him to the side to rest. \u201cRest well. Just leave the rest to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, we\u2019ll be depending on you now.\u201d He had unwavering faith in Master Lin. He felt that since Master Lin was here, everything would be fine.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded, then walked towards the inside of the clinic to see what facilities they had. If they had sufficient facilities, he could use them to analyze the virus. But after looking around, he didn\u2019t find the required facilities. It was a bit of a shame.</p><br/><p>Then, he went in front of an infected patient and felt his pulse to check the patient\u2019s inner condition. At the same time, this virus spread through the air and into Lin Fan\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan didn\u2019t exterminate it. Instead, he used the true qi inside his body to envelope this virus and slowly observe and analyze it. He wanted to see how he could tackle this virus.</p><br/><p>Since unlocking the Wuxia knowledge, he had had all kinds of techniques. He could interchange between true qi of different attributes.</p><br/><p>Minutes and seconds passed by.</p><br/><p>To others, Master Lin was feeling their pulses and pondering about it. But they didn\u2019t know that, inside his body, there was a battlefield. The battlefield was split into different areas and in each area, there were viruses present. He was now using various different methods and testing them out to see which one could exterminate the virus.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Lin Fan stood up and took out his phone. He immediately called Zhao Ming Qing and listed a long list of Chinese medicine before telling Zhao Ming Qing to buy them.</p><br/><p>When Zhao Ming Qing heard that, he immediately rushed towards the county\u2019s pharmacy under the lead of Li Chong.</p><br/><p>When they reached the county pharmacy, it was packed with people.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy is honeysuckle so expensive? Wasn\u2019t it just $90 per kilogram in the past? Why is it $540 now? This inflated too quickly, didn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><br/><p>The pharmacy staff looked emotionless as they said calmly, \u201cThey\u2019re all this price now. If you want to buy it, you have to hurry. They\u2019re running out. Also, it\u2019ll be a different price tomorrow.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe blue mountain root that usually goes for $6 per box is now $30 too. That\u2019s way too expensive.\u201d</p><br/><p>When the people came to the pharmacy and saw these prices, they were dumbfounded. They had come to buy preventive medicine after seeing the news on WeChat. But the price had made them speechless.</p><br/><p>When Zhao Ming Qing heard about them selling all these medications unreasonably, he wanted to argue the staff. But when he remembered that his teacher was still waiting for the Chinese medicine, he resisted the urge. He went in front of the counter and recited a long list of medications.</p><br/><p>That staff member who was at the counter was surprised. Other people were all buying other medicine while this old man wanted these. He couldn\u2019t help but say, \u201cMister, these medications are useless. Only those medications can prevent it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEnough nonsense. Just get me what I asked for,\u201d said Zhao Ming Qing impatiently.</p><br/><p>When the staff member heard this old man\u2019s arrogant tone, he slammed the table. \u201cWe\u2019re not selling.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Chong saw this and whipped out his credentials. \u201cGet them for me now. You private pharmacies are heartless. When this matter is over, I\u2019ll teach you all a lesson.\u201d</p><br/><p>The staff member had wanted to refute but when he saw the credentials, he was stunned. Then, he lowered his head and didn\u2019t dare to say more. He obediently went to grab the medicine.</p><br/><p>\u201cGive me the real stuff. If you give us fake medicine and waste our time, you won\u2019t be able to bear this responsibility.\u201d Li Chong was from the county and he was the leader of a certain unit. His tone was very stern.</p><br/><p>He had already thought about it. After this matter, he would make things difficult for this pharmacy.</p><br/><p>After the Chinese medicine was prepared, the two of them left in a hurry.</p><br/><p>Huang Yun Town.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan sat there and shook his head before laughing bitterly.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat a powerful influenza. I\u2019ve gone all out and it still took an hour. It\u2019s quite troublesome but it shall end here.\u201d</p><br/><p>The problem had been solved. It was indeed a ferocious influenza. It had managed to resist Lin Fan for an hour.</p><br/><p>Now, he had finally found the solution.</p><br/><p>All that was left was to wait for Zhao Ming Qing to return with the Chinese medicine and see the effects.</p></div>\n</div>"}

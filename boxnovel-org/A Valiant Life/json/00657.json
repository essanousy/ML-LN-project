There\u2019s even corruption in this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Zhang said, \u201cIn any competition, corruption is unavoidable. However, this is just a children\u2019s competition. How could they be so unfair? No, we have to say something about this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sister Hong was furious as well but she was powerless. \u201cSigh, what can we do even if we are angry? This competition was organized by the Chinese Arts Association. These names have already been announced. Even if there was a shady deal, they won\u2019t admit it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian\u2019s righteous spirit was bursting out. \u201cF*ck. This is simply pushing it too far. There\u2019s not one bit of fairness in this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be impatient, everyone.\u201d Lin Fan indicated for everyone to be silent. They weren\u2019t the only ones angry about this, even Lin Fan was very angry. If things had been carried out fairly, he wouldn\u2019t have much to say. However, anyone who knew a little about Chinese arts could tell which artwork was better. What was most infuriating was that even some of the experts in the Chinese Arts Association pretended that they couldn\u2019t tell.</p><br/><p>This made Lin Fan suspicious. Just what kind of demon was behind this matter.</p><br/><p>*Ring ring*</p><br/><p>At that moment, Director Huang\u2019s call came.</p><br/><p>Director Huang said, \u201cMaster Lin, the results of the Youth Chinese Arts Cup are out, right? How did the children do?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cDirector Huang. The children have done very well. All 365 of them won prizes.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Director Huang heard that, she was delighted. \u201cReally? These children are really so outstanding? I\u2019ll tell the children right now. Master Lin, you don\u2019t know this, but the children have been asking me about the results every day. Lil\u2019 Fatty, in particular, has been asking me several times a day. Oh right, which prize did Lil\u2019 Fatty get?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDirector Huang, don\u2019t tell the children about the results yet. Something has come up.\u201d After some thought, Lin Fan decided it was best not to tell them yet. So that if anything was to happen, the children wouldn\u2019t feel hurt.</p><br/><p>Director Huang was stunned. She had a kind of bad feeling. \u201cMaster Lin, could it be that a problem has occurred?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cIt\u2019s nothing major. Just leave this to me. Just pretend that nothing has happened for now.\u201d</p><br/><p>After hanging up, Lin Fan felt as if he couldn\u2019t let this matter end just like that. He had to deliver justice.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Liang, find a way to contact the judges. I want to have a chat with them,\u201d said Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Elder Liang nodded. Then, he started searching on the Internet. \u201cI found it. This is the phone number of the judges.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chinese Arts Association Assessor contact: 1358xxxxxx</p><br/><p>Sister Hong asked, \u201cLittle Boss, what are you going to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan took out his phone and said, \u201cOf course, I\u2019m going to clarify what is going on. Perhaps they made a mistake.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone was astounded. Was such a thing even possible?</p><br/><p>*brrp brrp*</p><br/><p>The call was dialed.</p><br/><p>Over at the Chinese Arts Association, the General Diplomatic Department\u2019s head, Xiao Chen was refreshing the webpage. As of now, the names of the winners had been decided. According to the higher-up\u2019s request, he had decided on the first prize winner. Of course, he gained some benefits from this.</p><br/><p>For this kind of children\u2019s competition, fairness is important. However, that\u2019s only when no one says anything.</p><br/><p>At that moment, an unknown caller called.</p><br/><p>Xiao Chen picked up the phone. \u201cMay I know who this is?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cIs this the person-in-charge of the judging for the Chinese Arts Association Youth Cup? I want to inquire about something.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Xiao Chen heard that the caller wanted to ask something, he couldn\u2019t help but start laughing. Looks like there was another person calling to ask about the situation. Ever since the winners had been announced, he had received numerous calls. Some called to thank him. Of course, there were others that asked why their children did not win. All sorts of questions came, causing him to be a little distressed.</p><br/><p>However, this caller had a calm tone. Hence, Xiao Chen was willing to chat with him.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I am the person-in-charge here, Director Chen. You can ask me if you have any queries,\u201d said Xiao Chen.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was in a peaceful state of mind. He didn\u2019t start scolding. \u201cThis is the situation. I\u2019ve seen the competition winner list and I\u2019ve also seen the artworks of the first prize winner and the second prize winners\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Chen said, \u201cMmm, so is there an issue?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said bluntly, \u201cI feel that there is a huge difference between the first prize winner\u2019s artwork and the second prize winner, Lil\u2019 Fatty\u2019s artwork. It\u2019s not just a bit of difference either. Did you guys make a mistake during the judging?\u201d</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan asked this, Xiao Chen, on the other end of the call, was taken aback. He was surprised that this person was able to see through that. Of course, the first prize had been awarded by underhanded means but he definitely could not admit that.</p><br/><p>\u201cSir, I think you\u2019re mistaken. These winners were all chosen by various masters. There is definitely no unfairness in this. As for this question that you\u2019ve asked, I have asked those masters before. They say that this Lil\u2019 Fatty\u2019s artwork cannot compare to Wang Hao Yang\u2019s. Just from the brushing technique\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Before Xiao Chen finished talking, Lin Fan interrupted, \u201cDon\u2019t talk about the brushing technique. Lil\u2019 Fatty\u2019s freehand brushwork is high-level. I understand the Chinese arts more than anyone else. Tell me, which masters said that Lil\u2019 Fatty isn\u2019t as good as the first prize winner? I\u2019ll question them myself.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck!\u201d Xiao Chen was dumbfounded. This guy was a little impudent, for him to say such things. \u201cSir, what do you mean by that? Could it be that you\u2019re saying that those masters are inferior to you? Let me tell you that one mustn\u2019t be overconfident. Those masters\u2019 paintings can fetch a price of hundreds of thousands each. Okay, I\u2019m hanging up. You wouldn\u2019t understand even if I said more. The names have already been decided and they definitely will not be changed.</p><br/><p>*beep beep*</p><br/><p>The call had been hung up.</p><br/><p>\u201cRetard.\u201d Xiao Chen shook his head. There were all kinds of people these days. For him to dare to question the Chinese Arts Association, that guy really didn\u2019t know what was good for him.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>Elder Liang said, \u201cWhat does that guy mean? Can they even compare to Little Boss\u2019s Chinese art skills?\u201d</p><br/><p>Sister Hong said, \u201cYeah. Little Boss, what do you think we should do now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan had already been pissed off. \u201cI\u2019ll call again.\u201d</p><br/><p>That person was way too arrogant. He hadn\u2019t even given any reason. Comparing the two artworks, it was obvious which one was better.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan made the call once again.</p><br/><p>When Xiao Chen saw that it was the same number again, he was a little angry. He answered the call and said in a nasty tone, \u201cDid you not understand what I said? These winners were all chosen by masters. There aren\u2019t any problems. If you still want to persist, then believe me, I will remove this Lil\u2019 Fatty\u2019s name from the winners\u2019 list.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan kept silent as he listened to the opposite party\u2019s snarling. When he mentioned removing Lil\u2019 Fatty\u2019s name, Lin Fan instantly erupted. \u201cAlright, just try it if you dare.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRetard. Just watch and see if I dare or not,\u201d responded Xiao Chen.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cAs a member of the Chinese Arts Association, you organize an activity but aren\u2019t fair to it. You guys perform shady deals even in a children\u2019s competition. No wonder the younger generations are getting worse and worse. It\u2019s all the fault of people like you.\u201d</p><br/><p>*clatter*</p><br/><p>As Lin Fan finished speaking, the opposite party hung up.</p><br/><p>It seemed that he was angry.</p></div>\n</div>"}

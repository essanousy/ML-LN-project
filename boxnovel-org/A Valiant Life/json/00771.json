Thanks. I have sent someone to handle this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, the shops must have the relevant supporting documents. We will never allow shop owners to set up businesses without them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPresident Huang is such a wise man to have thought about this matter. It is really impressive. Right, this is a superstition. How could we let people believe in this? I got people to handle it. How can I let President Huang ask about it personally? When the results are out, I will tell President Huang about it immediately. Alright, I\u2019ll hang up now.\u201d</p><br/><p>After hanging up.</p><br/><p>The person in charge shook his head and sighed.</p><br/><p>At Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>\u201cHi, Master Lin. I am Xiao Zhao from the Trade and Commerce Centre. We have received a report that you reported yourself as an unemployed citizen. Therefore, I am here to investigate it and would like to find out more about it,\u201d Xiao Zhao said politely.</p><br/><p>Master Lin was the good role model of Shanghai. He just didn\u2019t know which fella reported Master Lin and even called their director.</p><br/><p>They definitely had to have a satisfactory reply to the authority about this.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was helpless. He had never expected Huang Guo Hui to do this to him.</p><br/><p>Huang Guo Hui was incorrigible. He thought that he would send ten men to destroy his shop but he didn\u2019t expect Huang Guo Hui to do this to him.</p><br/><p>He was rather disappointed.</p><br/><p>The shop renovation happened a while back and he wanted to renovate it again but nobody was willing to help him.</p><br/><p>Then, Elder Liang walked by and he was unhappy when he heard that. \u201cBro, does Little Boss seem like a scammer? Ask the people around and see if Little Boss is really accurate with his predictions.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Zhao replied, \u201cMister, I did not mean that. It was just that someone reported his job as a superstition. Furthermore, his main profession is fortune-telling. He went to our Trade and Commerce Centre to get his fake certificate.\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Liang was anxious, \u201cThen why did you say that Little Boss is spreading superstitious ideas?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan interrupted, \u201cAlright, Elder Liang, don\u2019t argue with this fella. He didn\u2019t say anything at all but you\u2019re so anxious. Doesn\u2019t that mean that you\u2019re guilty?\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Liang glared at Xiao Zhao and stood aside, \u201cI\u2019ll shut up then. Anyway, these people are just messing with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Zhao was a little awkward. They weren\u2019t really messing with him. They were doing it based on their rules. Those with official certificates would be spared from this. That would prevent the public from being scammed too. Even if they were to be scammed, they still had the information to check on the scammers. That would be much simpler for their investigation process.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said seriously, \u201cI\u2019ll explain it. We read fortunes here but I am not spreading superstitious ideas. However, my predictions are absolutely spot on. If people were to say that I am spreading superstitious ideas, they can come and examine it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Zhao felt that Master Lin was a little angry. He immediately replied, \u201cMaster Lin, I didn\u2019t want to say anything when I came here. I\u2019m here to resolve your problems. Our manager said that Master Lin is the role model of Shanghai. Why would you spread superstitious ideas? Hence, I am here to get some information to help you create an official certificate.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan felt a little awkward. He felt like he misunderstood him. \u201cSorry, I was a little too rash with my words. I am really a fortune teller. How should we proceed with the certification?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Zhao replied, \u201cMaster Lin, perhaps you don\u2019t really understand it. If you said that you\u2019re a fortune-teller, you will not be able to get a certificate. However, if you say that you\u2019re doing some cultural research work, then, there will be no problems. There are a lot of fortune-tellers now with shops that have certificates. They managed to do it by declaring that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, I see.\u201d Lin Fan understood it. He didn\u2019t know that it was being played like that. However, that was good. The earlier he could get his certificate, he would run into less trouble in the future. \u201cWhat do you need from me, then?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Zhao smiled, \u201cI just need a photocopy of your identification. Then, fill up a form and we will contact you when it is ready.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, sorry to trouble you then.\u201d Lin Fan smiled. He didn\u2019t expect it to be resolved this way. However, he guaranteed that the person that reported him was Huang Guo Hui.</p><br/><p>He just didn\u2019t expect the worker from the Trade and Commerce Centre to have offered help. This was totally unexpected.</p><br/><p>However, he understood it after thinking about it.</p><br/><p>Although Huang Guo Hui was powerful, he wasn\u2019t a Shanghai citizen. Furthermore, Lin Fan was the role model of Shanghai. How could anyone go up against him?</p><br/><p>So what if Huang Guo Hui was really unhappy? The worker was just doing his job based on the rules. He was just doing legal procedures and he didn\u2019t abuse his power. Even if he were to report it secretly, Lin Fan wouldn\u2019t be afraid at all.</p><br/><p>Everything was settled.</p><br/><p>Xiao Zhao took the documents, \u201cMaster Lin, I\u2019ll be making a move first. I think it should be ready in about two days.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, thanks,\u201d Lin Fan smiled and said.</p><br/><p>At the Trade and Commerce Centre!</p><br/><p>Xiao Zhao returned, \u201cSir, I have spoken to Master Lin and got others to process his documents.\u201d</p><br/><p>His manager replied, \u201cAlright, that\u2019s good. When it is done, just inform Master Lin to come and collect it.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Xiao Zhao left, his manager called Huang Guo Hui.</p><br/><p>\u201cPresident Huang, sorry to disturb you. I am calling to report on the work. The investigation results are out.\u201d</p><br/><p>Huang Guo Hui immediately sneered.</p><br/><p>He went to look for this fella to have his fortune read but this fella didn\u2019t even give him any face. At the same time, he spoke with such a horrendous tone. If he didn\u2019t teach him a lesson, he wouldn\u2019t have known how powerful he was.</p><br/><p>With his status as a wealthy man, he was able to make life difficult for him with just one call.</p><br/><p>He wanted his shop to close down.</p><br/><p>Then, he would report it to the media and Lin Fan would not be able to open a shop so soon.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow\u2019re the results?\u201d Huang Guo Hui asked with anticipation.</p><br/><p>The manager replied, \u201cWe have to thank President Huang for your report this time. If not for you, we wouldn\u2019t have found out about the illegal shops. Therefore, I got my worker to speak with the shop owner to process his certificate. Now that he has one, it wouldn\u2019t be illegal anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>Huang Guo Hui was initially filled with anticipation but as he continued listening, he realized that something was wrong.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? That isn\u2019t correct. He is spreading superstitious ideas. How could he continue with his operation?\u201d</p><br/><p>The manager smiled, \u201cPresident Huang, I think you don\u2019t really understand it. Fortune-telling is something used frequently by the public. It is something that is against the rules. However, it can be considered to be a cultural research work.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis time, it\u2019s a slip-up on our part and President Huang has pointed it out. In the future, we will definitely do stricter checks. We will not let this happen again. Alright, I won\u2019t waste any of Chief Huang\u2019s precious time anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>Huang Guo Hui wasn\u2019t stupid. He knew that the Trade and Commerce Centre was on Master Lin\u2019s side. Then, he sneered, \u201cAlright, good\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The manager replied, \u201cThank you, President Huang, for your compliment. In the future, if President Huang would like to set up a company in Shanghai, the Trade and Commerce Centre will warmly welcome you.\u201d</p><br/><p>*bang*</p><br/><p>Huang Guo Hui immediately slammed his phone. He didn\u2019t want to say anything else.</p><br/><p>It was incorrigible, truly incorrigible.</p><br/><p>The manager looked at his phone and laughed.</p><br/><p>He knew what Huang Guo Hui was thinking. He clearly wanted to mess up Master Lin\u2019s shop. How could he let that happen?</p><br/><p>That was impossible.</p><br/><p>It was already illegal for him to abuse his authority. What was worse was that he was trying to go against Master Lin, who was the role model of Shanghai.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t want to think about whether Huang Guo Hui would take revenge again.</p><br/><p>Shanghai wasn\u2019t like the other cities. The notable leaders in the other cities had to give in to the requests to satisfy them.</p><br/><p>In Shanghai, people didn\u2019t care about what the wealthy people wanted. If they were willing to help, that would be good. If not, they didn\u2019t want to be involved in anything.</p><br/><p>There were a lot of entrepreneurs that wanted to come to Shanghai to develop their businesses but they often had to go through a lot of difficulties in order to get a plot of land.</p><br/><p>There were a lot of entrepreneurs around but only a handful was like Master Lin.</p><br/><p>He was a talented and cultured man.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Huang Guo Hui was furious. He was about to vent his anger but his office door got opened.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuang Guo Hui, you have to give me an answer today,\u201d a middle-aged lady stormed into the room.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p></div>\n</div>"}

Are you for real? How can he be that fast? Even the most powerful elder would not have been able to do that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c^ Are you stupid? Master Lin is the most powerful elder. Is there even an elder that is comparable to him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s true. However, this is too unbelievable. He wrote three songs in twenty minutes. How could that be? Was Master Lin just kidding? He might have said that just because Brother Yang was broadcasting.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t wish to comment on this because I\u2019ve been proven wrong by Master Lin twice. I don\u2019t wish for it to happen again. Hence, I believe him unconditionally. I think Master Lin is that powerful.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c^ I support you. I think so too.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, the netizens in the broadcast flooded the comments section as they discussed about it intensely. They were fully convinced.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, the people who hated Master Lin laughed behind their screens when they saw what had happened. It was as if they had discovered something new.</p><br/><p>They knew that Brother Yang worked at Cloud Street and that he would broadcast all the time. Hence, they had been hiding in the midst of the netizens, awaiting for something to happen.</p><br/><p>However, before now, they had never discovered anything major.</p><br/><p>It was simply impossible to write three songs in twenty minutes. Furthermore, it was Master Lin who had written them.</p><br/><p>His standard of English was poor. How could he have written three English songs in such a short time?</p><br/><p>They did not believe it at all.</p><br/><p>They secretly downloaded the livestream and extracted this part. They were prepared to make this piece of news go viral. Although they could not completely ruin Master Lin\u2019s reputation, they wanted to create an uproar.</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang looked at the situation in the comments section and said firmly, \u201cTo all my viewers, please calm down. We have to believe in Master Lin\u2019s capabilities. It may be impossible to others, but it is an easy feat for Master Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI support what Brother Yang said.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy do I feel like I\u2019ve entered a cult after hearing that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c^ Don\u2019t you know we are hardcore fans? Even so, I willingly believe in Master Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was not bothered by the situation in the broadcast at all. It was an expected outcome. He did not care about it. He just wanted to complete his task.</p><br/><p>However, he had selected three well-known classic songs that had won a lot of prizes.</p><br/><p>Hence, he believed that if Wu Huan Yue could sing to her full potential, it would definitely be free of any problems.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan was shocked. She looked at the stack of papers on the table that were full of words. Brother Lin had really written the songs in twenty minutes. It was simply unbelievable.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow\u2019s that? It\u2019s okay, right?\u201d Lin Fan chuckled.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan nodded. \u201cYeah. Although I\u2019m not sure of the situation, I think that\u2019s amazing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, that\u2019s great. Let me tell you a secret. Actually, forget it. When the songs get released, you\u2019ll find out about it.\u201d Lin Fan wanted to keep everything a secret. He did not really understand the songs, but he knew that they were awesome songs.</p><br/><p>At night!</p><br/><p>When people started to leave Cloud Street, a video emerged online.</p><br/><p>\u201cBreaking news! Master Lin wrote three English songs in twenty minutes. Can you believe it?\u201d</p><br/><p>When that headline appeared, a lot of people started to pay attention to it.</p><br/><p>They were shocked at how he could write three songs in just twenty minutes. Furthermore, they were in English. How could Master Lin write English songs when his command of English was so bad?</p><br/><p>At the same time, a lot of netizens started to watch the video.</p><br/><p>In the video, Lin Fan could be seen writing the songs. He did not stop at all, and it seemed as if he was just writing words instead of songs.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t really believe it. Doesn\u2019t he need to stop to think?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. After seeing this video, I feel that Master Lin is going to be flamed. How can it possibly be true? I think the main problem is we do not know what he wrote. If only we could find out what the songs are about.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c^ Stop dreaming. Wouldn\u2019t it ruin the surprise if he released the content of the songs?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, don\u2019t force yourself to do these things. If this were to go wrong, you\u2019d be in deep trouble.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, I\u2019m going to laugh to death. This Lin is acting like he knows everything. I swear everything he wrote was in Chinese. What else could it be?\u201d</p><br/><p>Some of the celebrities who saw the video were stunned.</p><br/><p>In a random group of celebrities.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you see the video? Master Lin wrote three songs in twenty minutes. That\u2019s a god-like speed. I don\u2019t really believe it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho knows? I\u2019ve never seen such a thing in my life before.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard to say. I prefer to stay neutral regarding this matter. Master Lin is scarily powerful. We can\u2019t afford to offend him. You should not comment on this matter to protect yourselves.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, we know how it\u2019s like after witnessing the past incidents. However, I think Zheng Ya posted about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, why did he do that? Let me go have a look.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zheng Ya had laughed uncontrollably after finding out about this matter. He immediately posted on Weibo.</p><br/><p>\u201cThree songs in twenty minutes?! How powerful\u2026 This has never happened before, and it definitely surpasses anything that\u2019s happened in the past.</p><br/><p>When he posted that on Weibo, a lot of people started to comment on it.</p><br/><p>Some of them were Lin Fan\u2019s fans. They immediately went to the comments section.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince you know that he\u2019s so powerful, why did you post about it? What\u2019s your motive?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s mocking our Master Lin. You must be asking for trouble.\u201d</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Zheng Ya\u2019s fans started to argue with Lin Fan\u2019s fans.</p><br/><p>When Jin Can saw the video, she laughed too. She felt that people were getting crazier these days, especially Master Lin, who looked like an idiot after claiming that he wrote three songs in twenty minutes. Perhaps he wrote nursery rhymes.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Lin Fan had just gotten home. He could not be bothered by whatever was happening online. He just went to sleep.</p><br/><p>He did not care about what was happening online. There was no need to be involved in it. When the songs were released, he wanted to shame everyone that doubted him.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

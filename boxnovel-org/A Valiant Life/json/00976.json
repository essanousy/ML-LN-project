By now, every person in Cloud Street knew that Elder Wang had gotten tricked by a multi-level marketing organization.</p><br/><p>To them, this was really too worrying. They thought about those people who had been tricked by multi-level marketing organizations in the past and how they would always end up tragically.</p><br/><p>But luckily, Little Boss had gone over. They believed that as long as Little Boss, made a move, there was nothing that couldn\u2019t be solved.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Boss is back.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, someone saw the two figures walking back and was delighted.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-2\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cElder Wang is back too. Looks like the matter is already resolved.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis was really scary but luckily, we have Little Boss. Otherwise, who knows what we would do?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGo, let\u2019s go and take a look.\u201d</p><br/><p>In the distance.</p><br/><p>Elder Wang realized that everyone was walking towards them and he couldn\u2019t help but become suspicious. \u201cLittle Boss, what\u2019s this? Does everyone really not know?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the situation before them and he grumbled in his heart before saying unsurely, \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone knows.\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Wang made a doubtful expression. <em>If they don\u2019t know, then what are they doing?</em></p><br/><p>But a small part of him still thought that perhaps everyone really didn\u2019t know. Perhaps they were walking over because they had something to say to Little Boss.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-3\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>But soon, that wishful thinking completely vanished.</p><br/><p>Elder Chen patted his shoulder. \u201cElder Wang, you\u2019re usually quite astute. Why did you get tricked by the multi-level marketing organization?\u201d</p><br/><p>Sister Hong added, \u201cYeah. We were all worried to death. Luckily, Little Boss brought you back. You have to be smarter in the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Liang said, \u201cElder Wang, you have to learn from this. Don\u2019t ever get tricked again.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone surrounded Elder Wang, saying things one after another.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Lin Fan had been maniacally trying to use his facial expression to stop them at first but in the end, he gave up. It was useless as they completely ignored him.</p><br/><p>Elder Wang had a dumbfounded look on his face as he saw the current situation. <em>Didn\u2019t Little Boss say that no one knows?</em></p><br/><p><em>But what\u2019s going on now? How come so many people know? This is so humiliating!</em></p><br/><p>Then, he wanted to question Little Boss. <em>At least give me a reasonable explanation!</em></p><br/><p>But in the blink of an eye, he realized that Little Boss had disappeared completely.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-4\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>In the shop!</p><br/><p>Lin Fan sighed. This really couldn\u2019t be blamed on him. Who had known that after going out for a while, the whole Cloud Street would know about it? Initially, it had only been Elder Chen and Sister Hong who had known about it!</p><br/><p><em>Forget it, forget it. I shan\u2019t think about this. This doesn\u2019t have much to do with me.</em></p><br/><p>But now, he still had something that he had to settle.</p><br/><p>That lecturing teacher, Ma You Min, was actually a member of the Chinese Medical Association. If this were to be made known, it would be unbelievable.</p><br/><p>He took out his phone and gave a call to the Chairman Zhou Qing Quan of the Chinese Medical Association.</p><br/><p>The call went through.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, why are you so free to call me?\u201d Zhou Qing Quan said excitedly. Right now, Master Lin and Elder Zhao were progressing too quickly. The rest of them couldn\u2019t even keep up.</p><br/><p>Moreover, Master Lin was a member of the Chinese Medical Association. This made him feel honored.</p><br/><p>After all, for there to be such a big shot in the association, he would be respected when he went out and told people about it.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cChairman Zhou, I want to report something to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Zhou Qing Quan heard that, he immediately paid more attention. \u201cTell me, Master Lin.\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-5\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cThis is the situation. A member of our Chinese Medical Association is bringing shame to our association. He was working as a lecturer in a multi-level marketing organization and lying to regular citizens. This is very severe\u2026\u201d Lin Fan explained the day\u2019s happenings. Regarding that behavior, Lin Fan absolutely could not just ignore it.</p><br/><p>On the other end of the call, Zhou Qing Quan listened seriously. When he found out that there had been such an incident, he was very concerned.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow could that be?\u201d Zhou Qing Quan was in disbelief. He really didn\u2019t dare to believe such a thing. How could there be someone like that in their Chinese Medical Association?</p><br/><p>\u201cChairman Zhou, that is exactly what happened. What I want to say is that this kind of people in the association affects the association greatly. And I think that this case is probably not the only one of its kind,\u201d said Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, don\u2019t worry. I will definitely deal with this situation severely. I\u2019ll immediately kick Ma You Min out of the association and also crack down on other similar cases. This kind of behavior has already severely impacted the name of the association. We have to quickly organize a press meeting to clarify things with the public,\u201d said Zhou Qing Quan.</p><br/><p>Right now, the situation was really quite complicated. Kicking Ma You Min out was not a problem. The main point was what Master Lin had said at the end. There wasn\u2019t only one such case in the association. That made the situation much more complicated.</p><br/><p>The Chinese Medical Association had developed until now and the number of members was very high. To completely get rid of all impurities was practically impossible.</p><br/><p>And it was an intricate and complicated thing. The network of connections was huge. To make a move was really not simple.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cChairman Zhou, can I suggest a plan for this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease do,\u201d said Zhou Qing Quan. He had a lot of faith in Master Lin. Whether it was regarding Master Lin\u2019s medical skills or his social standing, he was capable enough to take on the appointment of Chairman of the association.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-6\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Zhou Qing Quan felt that as long as Master Lin was willing, he would give up his appointment without hesitation.</p><br/><p>To have such capable people amongst them. That was the only way for the association to keep progressing</p><br/><p>Lin Fan thought for a moment before saying, \u201cI suggest that the members of the association go through a Chinese medicine-related evaluation once again. Kick out members who joined the association through backdoor means and for their own personal gain. Secondly, find a professional company to establish a platform and upload personal introduction and achievements of each member onto the platform. It would be good to give citizens a platform which they can search and find information.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlso, have a reporting system. If there are citizens that discover any Chinese Medical Association member publicly giving lessons, they can share the video to verify if what they are teaching is effective or if it is just multi-level marketing or something else\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said quite a lot of things but Zhou Qing Quan had heard them all. He couldn\u2019t help but start becoming slightly worried.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, although these suggestions are good, I\u2019m afraid they\u2019ll be very hard to realize. Right now, the association isn\u2019t just an exchange of knowledge. A lot of economic benefits are involved. There is a complicated network of relations. If I make such an announcement, I\u2019m afraid that it will be very hard to implement.\u201d Zhou Qing Quan was aware of himself. He was already old and he couldn\u2019t afford so much trouble.</p><br/><p>Moreover, he didn\u2019t have the energy to do it. The association would definitely go through a complete change. When that happened, he truly felt that it would be difficult to appease the people.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan didn\u2019t think too much. \u201cElder Zhou, how about this? I\u2019ll take over as Chairman. Do you think that\u2019s possible?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Qing Quan was startled. Then, he gasped in astonishment, \u201cMaster Lin, you\u2019re really willing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI am,\u201d replied Lin Fan. Although he didn\u2019t want trouble, this matter wasn\u2019t troublesome at all. He would just suppress everyone with an iron fist. Anyone unwilling could just leave.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-7\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div></div>\n</div>"}

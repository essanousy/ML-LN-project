In the end, the biggest winner was, of course, him.</p><br/><p>As for Ye Zhen Ming and Ou Yun Xing, they didn't have any qualms about it. Even their best skills couldn't stand a chance against Lin Fan. Even if they were unhappy, they had no choice.</p><br/><p>Backstage.</p><br/><p>The director was shaking Lin Fan's hand as he said, \"Teacher Lin, I'm really grateful for you. That ending was way too spectacular.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. \"Nah, it was nothing. I just stole the spotlight a little.\"</p><br/><p>The director waved his hand immediately. \"That's not stealing the spotlight, you just have real skills, Teacher Lin. If you didn't show them, it would have been a shame. I hope that, for our next show, you'll be our guest once again, Teacher Lin.</p><br/><p>\"We'll see about that,\" Lin Fan chuckled. If his task was complete, there was no way he would go for another show. His main objective this time was just to see if he could complete his task. As for promoting anti-gambling, it may or may not have been effective. People nowadays, if they're set on something, even if you threaten them with a knife, they might not change their minds.</p><br/><p>Ou Yun Xing, with a courteous expression, said, \"Teacher Lin, could we learn from each other next time?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled as he replied, \"Teacher Ou, I'd rather not. I won't be touching cards very often in future.\"</p><br/><p>Ye Zhen Ming said, \"That's a real shame. Teacher Lin's gambling skills really deserve respect. This level of skill is the most amazing I have ever witnessed in my life. I'm still wondering how you were able to do it.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan kept his smile. \"I think it's better not to wonder. You two teachers have already washed your hands clean and entered the anti-gambling business. If you were to get mixed in with these, then it would all be meaningless.\"</p><br/><p>\"Haha,\" the two men laughed, \"Right, right. We were wrong to think of that. But regardless, as long as we've managed to raise awareness about this issue, we'd have gotten results. I believe that this show will be very popular. But you have to be careful, Teacher Lin. You revealed so much on stage that I'm afraid there might be people who will come and threaten you.\"</p><br/><p>\"Thank you for your concern, but don't worry. I'm not only awesome at gambling, my fists are awesome as well. If they come, they might not be able to leave,\" said Lin Fan with a laugh as if he wasn't worried about it at all.</p><br/><p>The two men's initial disdain for Lin Fan had turned into respect. Whether it was in terms of skill or behavior, they deeply respected him. To be able to go on stage and speak so earnestly was truly extraordinary.</p><br/><p>Ye Zhen Ming said, \"Master Lin, why don't you leave your number? Next time, if there's any problem you come across in the Northeast, you can contact me. I have quite a number of contacts there.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. \"Alright, then I'll give you my number. If you face any issues, you can call me too. This anti-gambling business of yours is full of dangers as well. Please take care in future.\"</p><br/><p>From their faces, Lin Fan could tell that they sincerely supported anti-gambling. They were not using their reputations to scam others.</p><br/><p>It was just that Ye Zhen Ming enjoyed standing out. It was normal. Every person enjoys standing out but Ou Yun Xing was a little more modest and quiet. He had gone through many experiences and as such, he had a larger perspective on things.</p><br/><p>On the show, Lin Fan had shown off quite a bit. In Ye Zhen Ming's business, it was very competitive. If Lin Fan hadn't shown enough skill to stifle everyone and make them lose all will to resist, Ye Zhen Ming might have tried to compete with Lin Fan at the gambling table.</p><br/><p>After parting ways with the two of them.</p><br/><p>At the Television Station entrance.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang and the rest came forward, \"Brother, your technique was f*cking awesome. I really have to give in to you for today.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was very proud. \"Of course. There's no way you wouldn't give in. My gambling skills are no joke. No one can beat me. If I want to gamble, the whole world's casinos would add me to their blacklists.\"</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian coughed. \"Be a little low-profile. This is the Television Station. Don't get the innocent into trouble.\"</p><br/><p>\"Haha.\" Lin Fan patted Fraud Tian on the shoulder. \"What do you all say? Shall we part ways now and leave or go for some BBQ skewers together?\"</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan said, \"You've done an hour of the show. You must be tired. Let's call it a night. You can go home and have a good rest.\"</p><br/><p>\"Alright then. In a few days' time, the shop will open. When that time comes, we can have a nice gathering,\" said Lin Fan. He just remembered that if the task was complete, he should go and do some preparation.</p><br/><p>Now, he knew that no matter what knowledge it was, it would be very powerful. Before that, he had thought that some knowledge would be useless but that was just a lack of understanding on his part.</p><br/><p>To say it in one sentence:</p><br/><p>There are no lousy skills, there are only people who don't know how to utilize them.</p><br/><p>In the end, they all parted ways and left. This programme, to Lin Fan, had brought some gains. He had shown off so impressively that there would definitely be some fireworks the next day.</p><br/><p>The next day!</p><br/><p>The Shanghai Television evening show was out on the Internet.</p><br/><p>'The God of Gambling movie was pathetic. The real God of Gambling will leave you astounded.'</p><br/><p>'Earth-shaking gambling skills shakes the whole of Shanghai. Master Lin shows his hand and everyone is convinced.'</p><br/><p>'I'll take you through slowly. If you can see through my cheat, then I lose.'</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>These headlines were all captivating.</p><br/><p>Especially the headline by UC Breaking News. It really lacked integrity.</p><br/><p>'Breaking! North and South Gambling Kings have been forced to orgasm by a pair of hands\u2026'</p><br/><p>\"F*ck me! UC editor, has your house exploded? Can you not use click baits? If you do that again, I'll kill you.\"</p><br/><p>\"After watching this video, I'm speechless. I only beg for Master Lin's contact details. I want him to be my master.\"</p><br/><p>\"That's unreal. If I didn't see it with my own eyes, I wouldn't dare to believe it.\"</p><br/><p>\"That changing of cards was really impressive. Who would be able to beat him?\"</p><br/><p>\"LMAO. I'll take you through slowly. If you can beat him, I lose.\"</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>However, when some of the authorities saw this video, they were suspicious. But when they thought about this being an anti-gambling video, they didn't say much and just supported it since its motive was good.</p><br/><p>As for some of the problems with the video, they chose to close one eye.</p><br/><p>This week's director, Zuo Hu was questioned by many people. They said that this week was a little too much, for him to start using special effects on the show.</p><br/><p>But these questions left Zuo Hu startled. What special effects? It was all completely real techniques used in the show.</p><br/><p>Shanghai Television.</p><br/><p>\"Are the ratings out yet?\"</p><br/><p>\"They're out. This show has always been low-performing. During the first season, the ratings rose significantly. I wonder how it will do in the second season.\"</p><br/><p>\"I hope it will be slightly higher than the first season. But as long as it doesn't decrease again, it's fine.\"</p><br/><p>\"We'll see. I hope that happens.\"</p><br/><p>A man came over with the rating sheet.</p><br/><p>\"Everyone, the ratings are out.\"</p><br/><p>Everyone was curious as they wondered how high the ratings were.</p><br/><p>The man looked at the crowd. Then, a smile appeared on his face.</p><br/><p>\"The rating for this season is\u2026\"</p><br/><p>The whole place was silent as they all awaited the news.</p><br/><p>\"3.85%\"</p><br/><p>The place was in an uproar!</p><br/><p>\"What? That high? In the past, going above 1% was like a miracle! Who knew it would get so high in the second season.\"</p><br/><p>\"This is a first!\"</p><br/><p>\"Yeah! I never thought our choice would be so good.\"</p><br/><p>The man smiled. \"Alright, everybody. You have to remember this. For the next show, we have to choose properly. Those North and South Gambling kings were amusing and when Master Lin appeared, he brought the whole place alive. My wish for the coming shows is not for them to exceed this but just to maintain this standard. Are you confident that we can do that?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Lin Fan was faced with a big situation. The task completion notification sound had rung.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Haven\u2019t we gone through this yesterday? What is with all the fierce boasting today?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAll these editors really don\u2019t have any morals, do they? Their headlines are all suspicious and the content is all just bragging and flattery.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2018Today\u2019s Big News\u2019 has been beaten to the ground by all the other news agencies.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs the Godly Doctor that impressive? Treating patients outside a big hospital? This is the first I\u2019ve seen something like that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is the first time I\u2019ve heard of anything like this too. Sounds impressive.\u201d</p><br/><p>The crew from \u2018Today\u2019s Big News\u2019.</p><br/><p>The host for the previous day was sulking. His comment on the piece of news yesterday was being bashed by the other news agencies today.</p><br/><p>He had been merciless when he was criticising the Godly Doctor the previous day, denouncing him as a fraud. He had urged the public not to believe such rumors, but looking at the situation now, it looked like something wasn\u2019t right.</p><br/><p>Something wasn\u2019t right with his colleagues either. They were all looking at him differently.</p><br/><p>The host went back to his own office, wanting to get down to what was going on.</p><br/><p>Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, I just saw a ghost,\u201d Fraud Tian exclaimed as he saw what was on the news.</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang turned around, looking at him suspiciously. \u201cFraud Tian, what are you doing, making such a ruckus in the morning?\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian pointed at his phone, his face looking shocked. \u201cQuickly, take a look at the news. This kid went all the way to Jiangning.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan was frozen for a while before taking out her phone. She stood there in a daze when she saw what was on the news.</p><br/><p>\u201cVoluntary treatments? What\u2026\u201d Everyone in the shop couldn\u2019t believe what they were reading. What was Lin Fan thinking? How crazy did he have to be to go around giving people free medical treatments?</p><br/><p>It was really like seeing a live ghost.</p><br/><p>All the other shop owners all started to rush to Master Lin\u2019s shop after seeing what was on the news.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Boss has gone to Jiangning to treat patients voluntarily?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, this Little Boss\u2019 actions are totally unpredictable. Why would he ever think of going to Jiangning People\u2019s Hospital to give free treatment to the patients there?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho knows? Maybe he thought of doing it impulsively?\u201d</p><br/><p>The people all gathered around, discussing the situation at hand. The conclusion was that this situation was about to explode.</p><br/><p>Weibo.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, isn\u2019t that Master Lin?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy gosh, Little Boss has become the Godly Doctor.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe guy above me, what are you talking about? Are you sleeping? Why would Little Boss become the Godly Doctor?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTake a look at the news yourselves! The Internet is going crazy over this! Able to cure all diseases? Since when did Little Boss have this ability?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck, is that for real? Master Lin really defies all natural laws! Since when was he able to treat patients? If you really think about it, what is the purpose of Master Lin doing this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, it is always a pleasure to see news related to Master Lin. There\u2019s always something new and interesting happening with him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI really want to ask, what does Master Lin not know? He really is a Master. He is so talented!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiangning Fu Bao Hospital</p><br/><p>The doctors were all exploding in fury and panic.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe rumored Godly Doctor from online has come to our doorstep.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI already know that. Most of the patients in the hospital have gone to see him already.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere did this person come from? This will affect the image of your hospital!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did the Chairman of the hospital say?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot sure yet, but some of us have already made a report.\u201d</p><br/><p>In the office of the Chairman of the Hospital.</p><br/><p>An elderly man nodded his head emotionlessly as he listened to the doctors who were reporting to him.</p><br/><p>\u201cChairman, what do you think we should do about this? That guy is currently outside our hospital doors and a lot of our patients have gone to see him. If this continues, this wouldn\u2019t be good for us.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDirector Zhou, what is the aim of our hospital?\u201d Chairman Bi asked, his face indifferent.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s to save lives, to do our best, and to help patients recover to full health,\u201d Director Zhou answered.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I don\u2019t see a problem. All the patients are well, so I don\u2019t see what harm it\u2019s causing to our hospital. If that man is really what they claim him to be, a \u2018Godly Doctor\u2019, it would be a great thing for the patients. Alright, come down with me, and we\u2019ll visit this fabled \u2018Godly Doctor\u2019. We\u2019ll see what he\u2019s doing. If he\u2019s a fraud, I will deal with him strictly,\u201d Chairman Bi said, his tone authoritative.</p><br/><p>\u201cChairman, do we have to call any other people?\u201d Director Zhou asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need. Two of us should be enough\u201d Chairman Bi said.</p><br/><p>Ever since the Godly Doctor had appeared, People\u2019s Hospital and Jiangning Hospital had both been affected in their patient numbers. All their patients were discharged and this had never happened before.</p><br/><p>At the same time, the fabled Godly Doctor was something of an illusion.</p><br/><p>Being able to treat a wide array of diseases was believable, but an instant cure was impossible.</p><br/><p>Outside the Hospital.</p><br/><p>The queue of patients waiting for treatment was unbelievable. With all the din that this was causing, Lin Fans name had spread far and wide across Jiangning. As word spread of the Godly Doctor being in Jiangning, everyone wanted to come over to see what the whole commotion was about.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing was stunned when he saw the crowd. \u201cTeacher, that\u2019s a lot of patients.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled, \u201cDon\u2019t you worry, this isn\u2019t surprising. \u201d</p><br/><p>This really didn\u2019t come as a surprise at all. If he put in his heart and soul into whatever he was doing and didn\u2019t make a name for himself, something would be seriously wrong.</p><br/><p>But admittedly, there were really too many patients to handle.</p><br/><p>But he had to use all the energy he had to make scallion pancakes to treat illnesses. Nonstop treatment.</p><br/><p>Chairman Bi and Director Zhou were squashed in between the crowd. It was as if no one took notice of them. Chairman Bi\u2019s expression changed after seeing that the Godly Doctor was a young lad.</p><br/><p>He was suspicious and shocked. This \u2018Godly Doctor\u2019 looked a little unreliable.</p><br/><p>But after observing him a while longer\u2026</p><br/><p>His facial expression changed, and the shock and suspicion that he had at first turned into disbelief.</p><br/><p>This young Godly Doctor\u2019s movements were deft, precise, calculated and intentional. He knew what he was doing.</p><br/><p>His style of treatment was distinctly from Traditional Chinese Medicine.</p><br/><p>He scrutinized the faces of the patients. As the Chairman of the Hospital, his medical skills were naturally superior to the rest. Before he rose to the position of Chairman of the Hospital, he was the best practicing doctor in the hospital. Although his discipline wasn\u2019t Traditional Chinese Medicine, he could still tell a few things from the complexion of the patients.</p><br/><p>After the treatment, the complexion of the patients changed greatly. From what he could see, it was beyond anything that he had ever experienced before.</p><br/><p>After working so long in the medical line, he had met only a few doctors who could be considered to be Godly Doctors, but what they did were completely explainable and within a structure.</p><br/><p>What he was seeing at this moment, however, was almost impossible to him.</p><br/><p>\u201cDirector, this is almost magical. Even if it\u2019s Traditional Chinese Medicine, how is it possible that the patients would have such a drastic improvement over just one treatment?\u201d Director Zhou asked suspiciously.</p><br/><p>Chairman Bi nodded. \u201cThat is indeed correct. However, I don\u2019t know the full circumstances of this yet. Perhaps what he\u2019s doing is really magical. Oh yeah, do you find that guy\u2019s face familiar?\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Zhou looked at Zhou Ming Qing, subtly raising his eyebrow as he tried to recall that familiar face. \u201cChairman, I think we met that guy at the Chinese-Western Medicine Conference a while back, but I forgot his name.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go up to ask him. I have a hunch that the Godly Doctor\u2019s name is not in vain and that his skills are actually legitimate. For him to be able to create such a huge improvement with just acupuncture alone, it\u2019s something that our treatments can\u2019t do.\u201d/ </p><br/><p>Director Zhou kept silent, but he agreed with what the Chairman had said. They couldn\u2019t produce the results that the Godly Doctor was producing right now.</p></div>\n</div>"}

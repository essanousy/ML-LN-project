Can he wake up so quickly after just a surgery?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan didn\u2019t say much. If it was a typical patient, he/she would definitely still be in a coma. However, with the mystical boost of the Encyclopedia, the patient would definitely wake up in no time. If not, the boost would have been useless.</p><br/><p>Chen Liang started to make soft noises from the bed. Elder Chen was ecstatic, \u201cHe\u2019s awakened, he\u2019s awakened! This fella scared the hell out of me. I have to talk to him about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>This matter nearly shocked Elder Chen to death. If not for Little Boss, the consequences would\u2019ve been unimaginable.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cElder Chen, hold it in. Your son just woke up. You can scold him in the future. Furthermore, this matter isn\u2019t as simple as it seems. I will help you to handle the aftermath of this incident. How could the school advocate violence? It is unacceptable.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDad\u2026\u201d Chen Liang was still in a daze. However, when he saw his dad\u2019s anxious expressions, he thought of what had happened. He was embarrassed and fearful at the same time. He wondered why he was so rash.</p><br/><p>Elder Chen said, \u201cLil\u2019 Liang, how do you feel? Do you feel uncomfortable anywhere?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt hurts\u2026\u201d Chen Liang was in pain everywhere. It was as if every part of his body was broken.</p><br/><p>Initially, Lin Fan could\u2019ve removed the pain but he didn\u2019t. He wanted this kid to feel the pain and realize how foolish his actions were.</p><br/><p>However, some things cannot be understood by third parties. The individual\u2019s mental health is different and people would act rashly under certain circumstances.</p><br/><p>The medical knowledge of the Encyclopedia did mention that the brain would secrete a substance under rash circumstances to trick the brain. People would normally feel remorseful for doing it but it was useless to be regretful.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou deserve to be in pain. This should teach you to not be so impulsive in the future. Your dad was almost shocked to death,\u201d Lin Fan reprimanded.</p><br/><p>Elder Chen felt helpless. Initially, Little Boss told him to not scold his kid but Little Boss actually reprimanded him. However, he wasn\u2019t angry at all because Little Boss meant well for Lil\u2019 Liang.</p><br/><p>Elder Chen said, \u201cHurry up and thank Uncle Lin. If not for Uncle Lin, you wouldn\u2019t be here now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Liang knew who Lin Fan was as his dad told him about him before.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you, Uncle Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded. \u201cNo problem. What happened to your face? Did you get bullied by the students?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Liang hesitated for a moment and nodded, \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell your dad about it?\u201d Lin Fan asked.</p><br/><p>Chen Liang said softly, \u201cI was afraid of being beaten up by them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Chen shook his head helplessly, \u201cLittle Boss, this kid has been a timid boy since young. He has been soft-spoken and doesn\u2019t really like to talk to people.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cIt\u2019s okay when he recovers, he can undergo my special training for two months. This way, he wouldn\u2019t be timid in the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>Naturally, Elder Chen knew that Little Boss was just kidding. He just wanted his kid to be fine.</p><br/><p>Then.</p><br/><p>The people from the school came.</p><br/><p>The principal and the class\u2019 form teacher brought some things in.</p><br/><p>Elder Chen stood up, \u201cPrincipal, Teacher Zhang\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Regardless of what had happened, these people were the leaders of the school. Although it was somewhat related to them, it wasn\u2019t something that they wanted to witness.</p><br/><p>The principal said, \u201cMr. Chen, sorry. As the principal of the school, I didn\u2019t expect this to happen at all. I want to apologize to you and I hope you would forgive me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Chen was furious but he wasn\u2019t someone that would scold people for nothing. \u201cHey, I don\u2019t blame all of you. I just want an explanation to seek justice for my son.\u201d</p><br/><p>The principal said, \u201cOf course, the school will definitely give Chen Liang a satisfactory answer.\u201d</p><br/><p>They had been extremely nervous after the incident. They were afraid that something would happen. After all, this involved the school\u2019s education system.</p><br/><p>Teacher Zhang came to Chen Liang, \u201cChen Liang, sorry. In the past, you have reported it to me before but I wasn\u2019t bothered by it. I didn\u2019t expect this to happen at all. Would you forgive me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Liang replied, \u201cTeacher, I don\u2019t blame you. You\u2019re just in the dark.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan wanted to scold the two of them for being so ignorant about what was happening in school. However, they seemed repentant and his rage slowly disappeared.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is happening now?\u201d Lin Fan asked.</p><br/><p>The principal knew that this man was the person that saved Chen Liang. He was the godly doctor of Shanghai. Hence, he replied politely, \u201cTeacher Zhang and I just came out from the police station. The investigations have concluded that Li Yang led a few other students and bullied Chen Liang. The school will definitely follow up on this matter and give all of you a satisfactory answer.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cThis is school violence. If you don\u2019t follow up with it, who will? You can forget about washing your hands off this matter.\u201d</p><br/><p>The principal nodded, \u201cYes, yes. We will definitely follow up with it till it is over.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan didn\u2019t want to say anything else. The school\u2019s management had already put it that way. Then, he stood up and said, \u201cElder Chen, take good care of your son. I will be heading to the police station.\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Chen didn\u2019t know what Little Boss was up to but he just nodded. Then, he spoke to Teacher Zhang and the others. Something like that had happened in the school and regardless of whether it was because of the school or him, they were both important factors. At the end of the day, it was all because he didn\u2019t take good care of him.</p><br/><p>The doctors of the hospital wanted to keep the footage of the surgery as a specimen for them to study it. When they wanted to look for the godly doctor, they couldn\u2019t find him and they were regretful.</p><br/><p>On the Internet.</p><br/><p>A video was posted online.</p><br/><p>\u2018Shanghai Jinyang Secondary School had a case of violence. The victim committed suicide by jumping down from the sixth level. His fate is still unknown.\u2019</p><br/><p>When the video was posted online, it immediately caused an uproar.</p><br/><p>School violence happened occasionally but serious cases like this were rare.</p><br/><p>Most of the netizens who watched the video were furious.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, is he even human?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I was there, I would\u2019ve beaten the hell out of this fella.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe education system is too useless. Are these even kids? I\u2019m afraid that even adults aren\u2019t as inhumane as them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happened to the kid? Does anyone know the final outcome?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe jumped down from the sixth level. Do you think he can still survive that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The video was posted from the police station. One of the workers found the video after checking the phones and he was furious after watching it. Then, he immediately sent to the online groups.</p><br/><p>In the end, it went viral.</p><br/><p>The online discussions were endless and they were all talking about the flaws in the education system.</p><br/><p>A lot of people started reading about it.</p><br/><p>The principal who was still in the hospital didn\u2019t expect the matter to have blown up. The educational department immediately instructed that this incident must not happen again.</p></div>\n</div>"}

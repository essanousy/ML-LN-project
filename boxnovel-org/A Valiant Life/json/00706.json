His head was bald. \u201cTeacher Ying, you look so pissed after coming out from the toilet.\u201d</p><br/><p>If the people from the television station were here, they wouldn\u2019t have cried out in surprise. This was the vice-president of Shanghai Satellite TV network.</p><br/><p>And at the same time, there were a few reputable people sitting around in the table.</p><br/><p>\u201cI just taught a junior a lesson. That ought to let her know how to pay respects to her seniors,\u201d Ying Jing said calmly, not caring too much about what had just happened.</p><br/><p>After mentioning about juniors, the room started going into a whole discussion on the topic.</p><br/><p>\u201cThese people from the younger generation really need to learn some respect. Now, all these young people are acting as if the whole world revolves around them. Once I had this TV show and had invited someone to come and participate in it. He saw me backstage but didn\u2019t even bother to greet me, and so I just gave him an earful and sent him packing!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, we need to teach them properly. Looks like the younger generation needs it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Haha, since when did we start talking about the younger generation? Come let us drink!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes! Bottoms up!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ying Jing laughed coldly. She felt good after putting Wu Huan Yue in her place.</p><br/><p>Ever since she started out, she would always scold those juniors who considered themselves too good and who were too arrogant as she always expected those who were under her to pay their due respects.</p><br/><p>Outside.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuan Yue, where do you want to go after this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue took a deep breath, calming herself down. Thereafter, she forced a smile, \u201cWhy don\u2019t we go watch a movie afterward? There\u2019s a new one that just came out, I heard the ratings were really good.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded his head. \u201cAlright, let us go there afterward.\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Lin Fan realized that Wu Huan Yue\u2019s expressions weren\u2019t natural. \u201cDid something happen?\u201d Lin Fan asked suspiciously.</p><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue shook her head. \u201cNothing happened, I just knocked myself against something in the washroom just now. It still hurts.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow careless of you. You have to be more careful next time,\u201d Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>\u201cMm,\u201d Wu Huan Yue said, nodding her head. She didn\u2019t dare to tell him the truth of what had happened.</p><br/><p>Tonight, all she wanted was to spend time with Brother Lin, to eat and watch a movie. It was a rare and well-deserved break and she was not going to let it slip away like that.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet me go to the washroom first,\u201d Lin Fan said, getting up from his seats. He had drunk a little too much water and had to use the loo.</p><br/><p>In the washroom.</p><br/><p>After taking a leak, his body felt like a huge weight had been lifted off it.</p><br/><p>\u201cMister, wait up.\u201d Just at this moment, a waitress rushed over to Lin Fan just as he was about to leave the washroom.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d Lin Fan asked, looking perplexed.</p><br/><p>\u201cMister, just now I saw your female companion getting slapped inside the washroom. I feel like I should tell you this,\u201d the waitress said.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was originally full of smiles but after hearing what the waitress said, his face completely darkened.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho hit her?\u201d Lin Fan\u2019s tone of voice became serious, harboring an erupting anger.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I\u2019m not mistaken, it should be that big celebrity Ying Jing,\u201d the waitress said.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs she still here?\u201d Lin Fan asked. \u201cWhere is she?\u201d</p><br/><p>The waitress pointed to the direction of the private room. \u201cThere. If there\u2019s nothing else, I\u2019ll take my leave.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded his head, thereafter taking out a few notes from his pocket, handing it to the waitress \u201cHere, thanks for your help.\u201d</p><br/><p>The waitress declined to keep the money, \u201cMister, I know that you are the Master Lin, but I am currently working and I cannot call customers by their names.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood, take it,\u201d Lin Fan said, insisting on giving the money. After handing it to her, he turned towards the private room and rushed towards it.</p><br/><p>F*ck. Lin Fan thought that their little argument online was the end of it. He never imagined that she would dare to use physical force in real life to hit one of his own. This was just asking for it.</p><br/><p>From the outside of the room, sounds of laughter and conversation could be heard.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan flung open the doors.</p><br/><p>Inside the private room.</p><br/><p>The people in the private room immediately ceased their conversation after seeing the arrival of a stranger.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho is this?\u201d one of the people asked.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan\u2019s eyes scanned the room, resting his gaze on Ying Jing.</p><br/><p>Ying Jing looked at him stunned. She never imagined that this brat would be in the same place as her.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you hit her?\u201d Lin Fan asked, staring at Ying Jing.</p><br/><p>Ying Jing remained silent, continuing to eat her food while remaining calm.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan slammed the table, asking viciously, \u201cStop eating and answer me. Did you hit her?\u201d</p><br/><p>The heavyset table shook and some of the plates fell onto the ground. The rest of the people who were sitting around the table retreated, some of them looking on in annoyance.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho on earth are you, causing a ruckus here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWaiter, waiter\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBrat, what do you want?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAll of you shut the f*ck up. If you wish to live, go and stand at that corner,\u201d Lin Fan said, demanding forcefully.</p><br/><p>One of the people who was sitting at the table suddenly exclaimed, \u201cYou are that Master Lin, why are you here? This\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan didn\u2019t pay any attention to that person, but continued to stare at Ying Jing, \u201cI\u2019m going to ask one last time. Did you hit her?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ying Jing remained silent, her expression still calm. Although she looked stead on the outside, she was trembling on the inside.</p><br/><p>Although she had argued with Master Lin quite violently online, it was a completely different experience meeting him face to face. She was feeling a little scared- all the newspaper articles about Master Lin, about how he controlled a vicious tiger in the zoo and all the other feats that he had done before. It was just too scary.</p><br/><p>She never thought that Wu Huan Yue would be with this guy tonight.</p><br/><p>If it were anyone else, she wouldn\u2019t even be afraid. What was the worst that other people could do to her?</p><br/><p>All the other guys around the table would have been able to stop that person in a second.</p><br/><p>But the person who was standing in front of her right now was the skillful and powerful Master Lin. If anyone were to raise their fists against him, they would be made to regret their decision immediately.</p><br/><p>She might even be beaten up.</p><br/><p>But it wasn\u2019t an issue right now. At that moment, Ying Jing stood up, putting up a strong front against Lin Fan, \u201cYea, I hit her, but I was teaching her some manners to respect her seniors, so I don\u2019t see a prob\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Before she could mutter her last word, a palm streaked across the air, slapping her face. She fell onto the food that had toppled onto the ground earlier.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho gave you the right to do that?\u201d Lin Fan said after he had mercilessly slapped her.</p><br/><p>The people who were standing around looked at him scared. \u201cMaster Lin, please don\u2019t be rash. This is public property, and we don\u2019t want any trouble.\u201d</p><br/><p>There were many people who were talking but no one had to courage to go up to help Ying Jing back up.</p><br/><p>Ying Jing had been slapped into a daze. She had never met this sort of opposition before and she was starting to get angry.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you know who I am? How dare you slap me?\u201d she said, her face seething with pure rage.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to teach you a lesson today, and no one is going to stop me from doing so,\u201d Lin Fan pointed at Ying Jing viciously.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

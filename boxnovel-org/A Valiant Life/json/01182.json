But I am looking forward to it, more than anything else.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s awesome that Master Lin appeared in our country. He researched about various diseases and even cured them. It\u2019s so awesome. I hope he can cure every terminal illness in the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c^ Bro, that is impossible. Viruses will evolve, and there will always be new variants appearing even if he were to cure a particular one. I think it\u2019s impossible.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe that. I am really curious about what Master Lin would choose to cure. How about we start a poll and let him choose one?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSure, I\u2019ll suggest heart disease.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have asthma, so asthma then.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2026 can you guys suggest something else?\u201d</p><br/><p>The netizens discussed about it enthusiastically. The hospitals were also very curious about it.</p><br/><p>Several doctors were also discussing about it.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you think Master Lin is going to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard to say. In the past, I would think that this man must be joking. However, I\u2019m fully convinced that Master Lin is a godly doctor. An extraordinary one.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, Master Lin is my idol. If only I had his knowledge.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDream on. Master Lin is a genius. Nobody can be as good as him even after practising for a lifetime.\u201d</p><br/><p>The doctors loved to discuss about him. Also, they had been sharing various videos about Master Lin.</p><br/><p>They learned a lot from the videos were in awe of Master Lin\u2019s capability.</p><br/><p>They were really in awe of him.</p><br/><p>Some of the doctors were even afraid of him.</p><br/><p>Some of the doctors gathered and discussed about it on an online forum.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin is going to choose another illness to combat. Please do not let it be my specialty. If it is, I\u2019m doomed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll always remember leukemia. Ever since he cured it, I know of a lot of specialists that changed professions or specialisations.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, he\u2019s so powerful that it\u2019s getting scary.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cActually, Master Lin is a decent chap. Although he destroyed the livelihood of these people, he also helped many people along the way.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, I give up. Regardless of what Master Lin chooses to cure, I am fully supportive of it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Those doctors that specialised in the treatment of leukemia started to laugh upon seeing Master Lin\u2019s post. They wondered who was going to be the next unlucky group of people.</p><br/><p>Now that they changed their specialisations, they transferred to another hospital. Although they received lower wages, they could at least secure their livelihoods.</p><br/><p>Also, some even chose to open Chinese medical halls.</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan posted that on Weibo, some international websites also reported about it.</p><br/><p>There was even a website dedicated to recording the illnesses that Master Lin cured.</p><br/><p>Foreigners did not know much about the impact of Master Lin\u2019s work since they did not live in China. However, they knew that the cure of leukemia had helped a huge amount of people.</p><br/><p>The sudden rise in popularity of Chinese medicine in other countries was all because of Master Lin.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, a thread became viral.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Chinese Master Lin is going to cure another illness. Please pray that it\u2019s something that you need.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although it was posted late at night, international netizens started to reply to the thread.</p><br/><p>Although they knew that Master Lin was not going to look at it, they were still hopeful that their wishes would come true.</p><br/><p>If they were to choose a Chinese idol, patients would most definitely choose Master Lin.</p><br/><p>Besides, there was no other suitable candidate apart from Master Lin.</p><br/><p>At Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>Master Lin was amused by the happenings on Weibo.</p><br/><p>\u201cThese netizens are too lively. They\u2019re actually guessing my next move.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang smiled. \u201cOf course, Brother Lin. To them, you\u2019re a godly doctor. They would obviously take this seriously. After all, they wouldn\u2019t know if they would contract these illnesses in the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian looked at Lin Fan. \u201cYou should take it slow. I swear someone might start a conflict with you in the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved his hand. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. Illnesses cannot be cured forever. We aren\u2019t the only ones improving. These viruses are improving too. It may take some time, but if they were to become incurable, we would be unprotected again.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSince you know that, why are you still trying to cure these illnesses?\u201d Fraud Tian asked.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said helplessly, \u201cBecause I can\u2019t take it anymore. These illnesses are torturing people. Since I am here, I will try to eradicate it. I can\u2019t just not do anything because I\u2019m afraid of the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan smiled. \u201cBrother Lin is right.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan gave her a thumbs up. \u201cYou Lan, I think you\u2019d be a great hardcore fan of mine.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha.\u201d Wu You Lan smiled. Of course, she was more than willing to be a hardcore fan of Brother Lin.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, a lengthy reply to his post went viral on Weibo.</p><br/><p>Initially, Lin Fan was just scrolling through the banter between netizens. However, when he saw this post, he was stunned.</p><br/><p>\u201cCould it be true?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true, I went to his profile and saw the picture of his daughter. It\u2019s real.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so pitiful. She\u2019s just four years old. Because of the incorrigible hospital staff, his wife contracted AIDS. I hope Master Lin can help them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou must be kidding. It\u2019s AIDS we are talking about. How can it be cured so easily? Also, I think Master Lin wouldn\u2019t be willing to take this challenge since it would be a disaster if he were to contract it.\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

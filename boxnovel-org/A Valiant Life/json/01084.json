They were here to see what exactly Master Lin had to say. They were already so familiar with Master Lin and they didn\u2019t want anything bad to happen to Master Lin.</p><br/><p>But this time, the opposition was quite powerful. Moreover, Master Lin didn\u2019t have any evidence. Wasn\u2019t it the same as banging his head against the wall? Master Lin could have said that it was a misunderstanding. For example, he could have said his account had been hacked.</p><br/><p>Regardless of whether other people believed it, they would definitely believe it. They loved Master Lin after all.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled as he carried the half a box of milk in his hand. \u201cYou want evidence, don\u2019t you? I\u2019ll go and do a test. Once the test results are out, I\u2019ll have evidence.\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporters were stunned. \u201cMaster Lin, at this stage, you still don\u2019t have evidence. How would you know that there\u2019s a problem with the milk?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI do have evidence. I drank many bottles and I could taste it. But even if I say all this, you definitely won\u2019t believe me. That\u2019s why I\u2019m going to do a test now to get the evidence out,\u201d said Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>A gust of wind blew past.</p><br/><p>The reporters just stood in their original spots, dumbfounded. It was as if they had heard something terrifying.</p><br/><p>This was the first time they had heard someone say that he could taste a problem in milk. If that were the case, who would believe him? Even an idiot wouldn\u2019t believe him.</p><br/><p>To them, it seemed that Master Lin was going to be in trouble. Moreover, if his words were to be deemed as false rumors, he would definitely have to go to jail.</p><br/><p>After all, even if his social status was even higher, it would be useless.</p><br/><p>This Tianshu Milk definitely wouldn\u2019t go easy on him. They would definitely bite tightly onto him and not let him off at all. They might even lose their image of an awe-inspiring large corporation in the process.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the reporters standing there stupidly. He shook his head and smiled. \u201cAlright. There\u2019s actually nothing much to interview me about right now. In a short while, the evidence will be released.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, the reporters watched as Master Lin left and they exchanged looks with each other.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy do I feel that Master Lin is going to end up tragically this time?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, I feel that too. This situation has already become very severe. Tianshu Milk is already making their move. I\u2019m afraid that he will have to go to court soon. Moreover, this situation is so severe that the police will probably be taking action soon as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you saying that the police will come and capture Master Lin?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s not likely. After all, Master Lin is not an average person. They have to look at the big picture.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you believe that Master Lin really tasted it? Why do I feel as if this is getting more and more unreal.\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporters kept discussing with each other. They felt that this matter had developed to a scary stage. It was really difficult to believe what Master Lin had said.</p><br/><p>Moreover, the situation in various parts of the country wasn\u2019t looking good. Many people were protesting. The destructive force of those words posted by Master Lin was enough to scare some people to death.</p><br/><p>Countless supermarket owners were grumbling and complaining.</p><br/><p>Some people wanted to return their stock but Tianshu Milk didn\u2019t allow it. Their reason was that it was a false rumor. However, even if they didn\u2019t return the milk, they couldn\u2019t sell it.</p><br/><p>Then, the crowd of reporters left the area.</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian arrived in his car. When he arrived at the shop, he immediately called out, \u201cMaster Lin\u2026 Master Lin\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian saw him and said, \u201cHe\u2019s not around. He just left.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian was taken aback and couldn\u2019t help but be anxious. \u201cWhere did he go?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s bringing the milk for testing. Inspector Liu, do you think that this will turn out badly?\u201d asked Fraud Tian.</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian\u2019s expression was very grave. \u201cThere definitely won\u2019t be a problem if he has appropriate evidence. But without evidence, I\u2019m afraid that this will turn out very badly. Previously, when he didn\u2019t have any evidence, the higher-ups have already given orders to bring Master Lin in for investigation but I defended him. However, if there\u2019s no evidence, I\u2019m afraid that I won\u2019t be able to hold them back for long.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s that serious?\u201d Fraud Tian was dumbfounded. He hadn\u2019t expected things to develop to such a stage.</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian nodded. \u201cMmm. This is a very serious matter. If it isn\u2019t resolved, he\u2019ll have to go to jail. Sigh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>After Lin Xiao Tian left, Wu You Lan\u2019s little heart was thumping furiously.</p><br/><p>\u201cDad, Brother Lin won\u2019t be in trouble, will he?\u201d</p><br/><p>She was out of her wits. It wasn\u2019t that she didn\u2019t trust Brother Lin but this situation was really quite scary.</p><br/><p>Wu Tian He sat there calmly and let out a smile. \u201cIt\u2019s fine. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nowadays, when he read the fortunes of the average townsfolk, he would reveal 30% and keep 70% to himself. He was still very powerful. When he had read Lin Fan\u2019s fortune, he couldn\u2019t see how there could be a problem. Therefore, he believed that this matter wouldn\u2019t cause any negative impact on Lin Fan at all.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan heard her father\u2019s words and let out a breath of relief. Perhaps all she needed was a reassurance.</p><br/><p>At the testing center.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan carried the milk over. The people there saw Lin Fan and immediately went forward. These days, everyone knew about Master Lin. And with the recent news, his popularity had blown up.</p><br/><p>A staff member went forward and said, \u201cMaster Lin, how can we help you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled and replied, \u201cI\u2019d like to ask for help in testing this milk.\u201d</p><br/><p>The staff member looked at the milk, then said cautiously, \u201cMaster Lin, is what you said really true?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cYou can just do a quick test. If it\u2019s not true, I\u2019ll have to go to jail again. I haven\u2019t been there in a long time and I do miss it a little.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d The staff member had a stupefied look on his face. This was the first time he had heard someone saying that he missed being in jail. It seemed quite domineering to him.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow long will the test take?\u201d asked Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>The staff member had wanted to say that it would require at least a week. However, he thought that this was Master Lin they were talking about and he really wanted to know the truth behind this too.</p><br/><p>\u201cTomorrow. Master Lin, the results will be out tomorrow.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded his head contently. <em>Tomorrow wouldn\u2019t be too late. Does Tianshu Milk Company really not know about the problem with their own milk?</em></p><br/><p><em>When the evidence is out, they will know just how severe this matter is.</em></p><br/><p>Then, he came out of the testing center. This wasn\u2019t the Quality Inspection Office but since it was in Shanghai, it was reliable. Testing the milk definitely wouldn\u2019t be a problem.</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan came out, a call from Wu Huan Yue came.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Lin, are you alright?\u201d Wu Huan Yue had been dumbfounded when she found out about the news. She had even stopped practicing her songs temporarily.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. \u201cI\u2019m alright. Have you been practicing your songs?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue said, \u201cBrother Lin, how can I be in the mood to practice songs? I heard from Chief Wang that, if this isn\u2019t resolved, you will go to jail.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t listen to his nonsense. I have confidence in myself. Go and practice your songs well. That Wang Mei Tian or whatever even dared to step over me. You have to avenge me.\u201d</p><br/><p>He wasn\u2019t bothered by this milk incident at all. To him, it was just a casual and convenient move.</p></div>\n</div>"}

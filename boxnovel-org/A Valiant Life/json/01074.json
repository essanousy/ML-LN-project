The entertainment reporters weren\u2019t shy at all. They took over the chairs, placed them down, and sat down in an orderly manner.</p><br/><p>They were very familiar with Master Lin as well as those shop owners.</p><br/><p>Master Lin had already said it, so of course, they had to do as he said, because Master Lin would definitely give them the opportunity to interview him.</p><br/><p>But the sports reporters seldom came into contact with Master Lin, so they didn\u2019t sit down. They even felt that it wasn\u2019t very good. But when they saw that the entertainment reporters had all sat down, they were dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>An entertainment reporter looked at them and said, \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you all sitting? How will Master Lin answer our questions if you don\u2019t sit? With one look, I can tell that you guys haven\u2019t interacted with Master Lin much before.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. Our relationship with Master Lin is solid. Interviewing him is a common occurrence. Without coming here at least seven or eight times a month, I wouldn\u2019t feel comfortable.\u201d</p><br/><p>When the sports reporters heard these words, they were a little surprised. Then, they took some chairs and sat down as well.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan heaved a sigh of relief. They had finally settled down. Then, he stood in front of the reporters and said, \u201cAlright. I said I would let you interview me, so let\u2019s do it. Ask your questions one by one in an orderly manner. Don\u2019t rush it. I\u2019ll definitely give you your chance.\u201d</p><br/><p>Some of the townsfolk came to watch the show. They had already seen this kind of situation many times before. Those who came here often, in particular, had seen reporters come countless times.</p><br/><p>They knew that Little Boss and the reporters were inseparable.</p><br/><p>A sports reporter spoke, \u201cMaster Lin, are you going to conquer the entire sports world?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shook his head. \u201cNo. I have no such intentions.\u201d</p><br/><p>He would have to be crazy to enter the sports world. It was too tiring. He would much rather enjoy the comfort of running his shop.</p><br/><p>At that moment, a female reporter asked, \u201cMaster Lin, what are your thoughts about what Coach Wu Ze said? He said that you\u2019re the top goalkeeper in the world, the number one in the world. Do you think that this brings pressure to you or is Coach Wu just flattering you?\u201d</p><br/><p>This question was quite deep but Lin Fan had not expected Wu Ze to think so highly of him and give such positive criticism.</p><br/><p>Although Lin Fan was someone who liked to stay low-key, he wasn\u2019t someone who liked to lie either.</p><br/><p>Moreover, Coach Wu had already said so much. If Lin Fan didn\u2019t admit to it, he wouldn\u2019t be giving Coach Wu face. Hence, after some thought, Lin Fan decided to give a clear answer.</p><br/><p>To that female reporter, Master Lin was probably thinking about how to tactfully express that he wasn\u2019t at that level. After all, most people would be extremely humble in front of cameras. Humility is a virtue.</p><br/><p>But suddenly, when she heard Master Lin\u2019s reply, she was completely dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said very seriously, \u201cActually, what Coach Wu Ze said is right. Although I\u2019m not a part of the sports world, after this match, I feel that goalkeeping is too simple. I didn\u2019t even use my full abilities. If he says that I\u2019m the number one in the world, I\u2019ll admit to that. After all, I\u2019m not someone who likes to lie. Sometimes, being too humble can be artificial.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, the place went completely silent. Not a single person spoke.</p><br/><p>The surrounding shop owners nodded calmly as they felt that what Little Boss said was completely right. What he said was the truth. Seeing that Little Boss was still the same as he had been before, they were able to relax.</p><br/><p>If Little Boss suddenly became humble, they would really be afraid that Little Boss had gone through something that caused his personality to change.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*cking awesome!\u201d an entertainment reporter exclaimed. They were very familiar with Master Lin. Naturally, they knew what kind of person Master Lin was.</p><br/><p>In their hearts, Master Lin was the embodiment of wisdom and charm. He was someone worthy of worship.</p><br/><p>They felt that Master Lin had answered this question pretty well. Moreover, they could feel that Master Lin was actually already being very humble.</p><br/><p>But to the sports reporters, that answer had left them completely dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, regarding that answer, don\u2019t you think that you\u2019re being too arrogant?\u201d a male reporter asked. He felt that Master Lin\u2019s reply had been too arrogant.</p><br/><p><em>What do you mean that goalkeeping is too simple? It\u2019s not simple at all!</em></p><br/><p>As for Lin Fan saying that he hadn\u2019t used his full abilities, they felt that he was simply bragging too much.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shook his head. \u201cMy dear reporter, there\u2019s no need to go on further about questions that I\u2019ve already answered. The situation is indeed as such.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI give in.\u201d That reporter was speechless. He could only shake his head and continue recording.</p><br/><p>At that moment, another reporter raised his hand. \u201cMaster Lin, since your goalkeeping is so awesome, why don\u2019t you become a goalkeeper? If it\u2019s really as you say and you\u2019re number one in the world, you could definitely lead the team to greater heights.\u201d</p><br/><p>This was something that all the other reporters wanted to ask as well.</p><br/><p>After all, since Master Lin had said that he was so awesome, why didn\u2019t he just do it? They simply couldn\u2019t understand.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. \u201cMy dear reporter, this is a very good question. Why don\u2019t I join official competitions? That\u2019s because I feel that I can\u2019t do it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Before he finished speaking, the reporter hurriedly prompted, \u201cMaster Lin, with your abilities, many teams would welcome you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. Let me finish.\u201d Lin Fan waved his hand and said, \u201cFootball is a great activity. Like any other competition, it is only meaningful if there are wins and losses. If I become a professional player, it wouldn\u2019t be worth watching anymore because no one would be able to score at all with me defending the goal post. I\u2019m afraid that it would ruin the sport. So, for the sake of this sport, I won\u2019t join.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn!\u201d</p><br/><p>The sports reporters\u2019 jaws all dropped. They had never heard such arrogant words before. If they were to report this, it would scare people to death.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*cking awesome.\u201d The entertainment reporters applauded as they felt that Master Lin had said it too well.</p><br/><p>One of the reporters asked, \u201cMaster Lin, don\u2019t you think that you\u2019re being too arrogant by saying those things?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at that reporter and answered, \u201cThis isn\u2019t being arrogant. It\u2019s the truth. My medical skills are awesome, aren\u2019t they? But I won\u2019t be a doctor. My drawings are awesome, aren\u2019t they? But I won\u2019t become an artist. My martial art skills are amazing, aren\u2019t they? But I won\u2019t become a martial artist. That\u2019s because I don\u2019t want to ruin these industries. For these industries to have reached their current states, it hasn\u2019t been easy.\u201d</p><br/><p>When the sports reporters heard this reply, they were completely astounded.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, the entertainment reporters just nodded. They felt that what Master Lin said made a lot of sense and there was nothing wrong at all. They truly believed in those words without a doubt.</p><br/><p>They had followed Master Lin all along. Regarding how f*cking awesome Master Lin was, they understood best.</p></div>\n</div>"}

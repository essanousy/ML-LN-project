I feel like beating him up.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say that. Master Lin is not that type of person. He must have a solution. Furthermore, the result isn\u2019t out yet and it isn\u2019t fair for you to scold him yet.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c^ Stop being a troll. I\u2019ll give you fifty cents and you can call me daddy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c^ Stop being unreasonable. Did I offend you? The results aren\u2019t even out yet. Which one of you saw that it\u2019s a failure?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI see that your family is f*cked up with my own eyes.\u201d</p><br/><p>The people in the broadcast room started to scold each other and it was getting intense.</p><br/><p>Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>A bunch of people surrounded Zhao Zhong Yang.</p><br/><p>Elder Liang said, \u201cSigh, Little Boss is being roasted like crazy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Zhang said, \u201cWhat\u2019s happening? Little Boss didn\u2019t even offend them. Why do they hate him so much?\u201d</p><br/><p>Sister Hong said, \u201cLil\u2019 Yang, please speak up for Little Boss.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang held his phone and he was extremely helpless. \u201cSister Hong, it can\u2019t be helped. There are too many people scolding him. My post wouldn\u2019t mean a thing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian shook his head. \u201cI guess this fella has been with this old fella recently. I wonder how he\u2019s going to resolve this problem. I saw that a lot of his fans started to defame him on Weibo. It\u2019s hopeless.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan was worried but she didn\u2019t know what to say.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Tian, how\u2019s the situation?\u201d Then, Wang Ming Yang came. He was stunned by the broadcast as his good friend was being scolded so badly online. Therefore, he wanted to see what was happening.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian shook his head. \u201cSigh, it\u2019s so bad. Just look outside.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang went outside and looked up. He was stunned by what he saw. \u201cD*mn, who did this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian was helpless. \u201cWho else could it be? It was definitely done by these people. They destroyed the shop\u2019s signboard.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang shook his head. \u201cSigh, what is he up to? This matter had nothing to do with him. Why did he interfere with it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho knows? He didn\u2019t say anything. We only see him in the morning. Other than that, he\u2019s not even at the shop,\u201d Fraud Tian replied.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>At the hospital.</p><br/><p>There were a lot of people outside the ward. When Lin Fan appeared, the people got infuriated.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck, it\u2019s this guy. He\u2019s together with this old fella. He even supported this fella\u2019s work. He\u2019s an inhumane beast too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin? I think he\u2019s a dog.\u201d</p><br/><p>They started to scold him and it sounded awful.</p><br/><p>Professor Chang sneered as he felt that the situation was as expected.</p><br/><p>\u201cAll of you, shut up.\u201d Zhao Ming Qing was infuriated. He couldn\u2019t take it anymore when he heard people scolding his mentor.</p><br/><p>If not for Zhao Ming Qing\u2019s old age, he might have beaten them up.</p><br/><p>\u201cShut up, old hag. If not for your old age, I\u2019d have beaten you to death.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAn old fella with a young one. They\u2019re both despicable things.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was upset when he heard them. Then, he scolded, \u201cWho said that? Step forward now. I\u2019ll kill your entire family. Do you have to scold us so badly? You want to act as if you\u2019re so righteous and awesome, right? Come and have a go, let\u2019s see who gets to learn a lesson.\u201d</p><br/><p>The people started to quieten down after what Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan didn\u2019t want to let them off. He added, \u201cI don\u2019t know what you guys are doing. You guys feel righteous by scolding us? You think you\u2019re right after watching the video? Did you watch the video properly? Do you know what was happening? Furthermore, the results aren\u2019t even out and you\u2019re scolding us. Are you guys crazy? This team of professionals spent a few days and don\u2019t even have a preliminary solution. Do you have to wait until the patient dies before you start scolding this professional team for wasting time?\u201d</p><br/><p>Professor Chang frowned unhappily. This fella was saying that his team of people were incapable. This illness was difficult to cure and it was normal for them to not come up with a solution in such a short time.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou guys are so horrible. You think you\u2019re so righteous and just but you don\u2019t even know the truth. If you\u2019re so capable, please do something else. It\u2019s better than being here,\u201d Lin Fan scolded.</p><br/><p>Then, the people rebutted, \u201cWhy? You dare to do something like that but don\u2019t want people to criticise you for it? That\u2019s the truth. If you\u2019re so capable, heal her then.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so unreasonable.\u201d Lin Fan waved his hand and nodded at Zhao Ming Qing.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing was infuriated but he felt that there wasn\u2019t a need to go against these people because his main aim was to cure Wang Li Li.</p><br/><p>Director Zhang said, \u201cDirector Zhao, you can go ahead.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Zhao Ming Qing nodded. Then, he went forward and measured her pulse. He could tell a lot about a patient just by measuring their pulse. Then, he took out a box of needles. \u201cThe patient\u2019s condition is too serious. Her stomach is badly damaged and I have to implement acupuncture into my treatment so that her stomach will be well protected when she consumes the medicine.\u201d</p><br/><p>Professor Chang laughed disdainfully, \u201cProtect her stomach just by using these needles?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cIf you don\u2019t know anything, keep quiet. The human body is one of the most wonderful vectors. These are all based on evidence. One\u2019s skin can heal on its own after a superficial injury because the skin\u2019s base layer has a layer of cells for development. In the stomach, the cells of the mucous membrane of the stomach can secrete substances to combine with various compositions to protect the stomach. Acupuncture can help to increase the rate of secretion and reaction to protect the stomach sufficiently. It\u2019s useless to tell you so much since you won\u2019t understand it. Just watch.\u201d</p><br/><p>Professor Chang was stunned speechless. What did he mean that this guy wouldn\u2019t understand it? He was an expert in this matter, yet this guy said that he wouldn\u2019t understand. He wanted to see just how capable they were.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing looked extremely stern. Although he was treating her alone, he was extremely confident and he didn\u2019t want to let his mentor down.</p><br/><p>The needles were slowly inserted around Wang Li Li\u2019s abdomen and it looked a little scary.</p><br/><p>Then, Zhao Shi and her four children were staring intently at the broadcast. They were extremely anxious and if they could choose the outcome, they\u2019d definitely choose for their father to succeed.</p><br/><p>Many of the experienced elderly Chinese medical doctors were also watching the broadcast closely. They were afraid that they would miss out anything.</p><br/><p>He had to succeed. That was what everyone was thinking.</p><br/><p>The acupuncture was over and Zhao Ming Qing took out the prepared Chinese medicine to let Wang Li Li consume it. Wang Li Li would\u2019ve rejected it but she had no energy at all. She was fed the medicine.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing pressed onto the abdomen several times and used a special technique to stimulate the different acupuncture points before he removed the needles.</p><br/><p>Then, Zhao Ming Qing stood up and didn\u2019t say anything. It was as if he was waiting for something.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all?\u201d</p><br/><p>Professor Chang laughed. It seemed like a joke.</p><br/><p>Even Director Zhang was doubtful of it.</p><br/><p>The people outside started to scold them, \u201cHaha, how shameful. It\u2019s such a joke.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI said it. This fella isn\u2019t a good man. He\u2019s acting as if we\u2019re all stupid monkeys.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLooks like this old fella thought that this girl was a test subject too.\u201d</p><br/><p>The broadcasting room went crazy too.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow hilarious. This is so shameful.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happened to the treatment? Did it get eaten by dogs? How can she be healed within such a short time? He must think that we\u2019re fools.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF<em>ck your moms, you two f</em>cking dogs.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Li Xing sighed as he watched the broadcast. It looked like his dad was doomed.</p><br/><p>The elderly Chinese medical doctors also sighed and shook their heads. They didn\u2019t know what Zhao Ming Qing was doing and thought that he had gone mad.</p><br/><p>The situation in the hospital was about to blow up and the reporters couldn\u2019t bear to watch any further.</p><br/><p>Then, a sound came.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m so hungry\u2026\u201d Wang Li Li said in her weak voice.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing had prepared a bowl of porridge and Lin Fan brought it to Wang Li Li\u2019s side.</p><br/><p>Wang Li Li suddenly took the bowl and took huge gulps.</p><br/><p>\u201cMing Qing, let\u2019s go,\u201d Lin Fan took a deep breath and said.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing nodded and followed Lin Fan. The people at the entrance made way for them.</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan and Zhao Ming Qing left, there was a loud noise in the ward.</p><br/><p>\u201cAH\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p><em>uproar</em></p><br/><p>Everyone went crazy.</p><br/><p>The people that had been stunned slowly recovered from their daze.</p><br/><p>When someone went to look for Zhao Ming Qing and Lin Fan, the two of them were already gone.</p><br/><p>At this moment, everyone was dumbfounded</p><br/><p>The broadcast room went silent.</p><br/><p>Elderly Chinese Medical Doctors: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Li Xing: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The spectating crowd: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone had been stunned by what had happened.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

It\u2019s called \u2018Kiss Goodbye\u2019 and it\u2019s on every single major music station.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is the song that Master Lin sang on the \u2018Strongest Heavenly Voice\u2019. However, he sang it without any accompanying instrumentals that time. Now that it\u2019s out with the accompaniment, it is simply out of this world.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou definitely should not listen to it unless you want to embarrass yourself. If you want to listen to it, you better listen to it alone. Don\u2019t say I didn\u2019t warn you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNow that this godly song has appeared, I realized that the songs I listened to in the past are like a pile of shit.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m on my knees looking for other songs by Master Lin. It can\u2019t be that he has only released this song.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin has composed quite a few songs. However, he has only personally sung this song.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t talk to me about this song. I\u2019ve already blacklisted it. Motherf*cker, the one and only time I listened to this song, I was destroyed by it. I really hate him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c^, what kind of sh*t did you go through to have such a huge grievance towards this song?\u201d</p><br/><p>The discussions about this topic were red hot. Everyone had a very high assessment of the song.</p><br/><p>On Weibo.</p><br/><p>\u201cOnce the godly song \u2018Kiss Goodbye\u2019 came out, every other song lost its flavor.\u201d</p><br/><p>The headlines of the front page were overbearing. When some of the famous singers saw this, they felt very uncomfortable. However, they did not dare to say anything.</p><br/><p>They had already heard the song, and when they were finished with listening to it, they were filled with tears. To them, this song had some magical powers. Also, the magical powers were pretty strong. It was practically taking over their life.</p><br/><p>QQ Music.</p><br/><p>Netease Music.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2018Kiss Goodbye\u2019 was one of the top songs on their lists of music, and it was continuously rising. In a single night of work, it had reached over twenty million downloads.</p><br/><p>It could be said that this was exceptionally scary.</p><br/><p>Also, the number of times it had been listened to was even scarier. It had reached 160 million.</p><br/><p>When talking about a song, these numbers were out of this world. It was really very scary.</p><br/><p>At the Eastern Han Group.</p><br/><p>When Wang Ming Yang saw the results of his song, he immediately gave his brother a call.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello, big brother. A big loss, really a big loss.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up? What did you lose?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust look at the rankings yourself. If we made an album, we would have been rich a long time ago.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t keep thinking about getting rich. Why are your eyes always fixed on money?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I don\u2019t earn money, then how am I going to get the money for you to squander? Do you have any idea how much pressure is on me now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy f*cking one billion dollars have been wasted by you. Return it to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI was wrong.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>He had already anticipated these sort of results. If this song was still not able to reach that sort of level, then he would have wasted his life already.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, the results were not even high enough. Given his target, it had to reach an even higher ranking.</p><br/><p>At Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan saw the news online and then gave a huge and bright smile. Although it was just for his own amusement, but to be able to succeed like this made him feel very satisfied inside.</p><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue called him.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Lin, congratulations.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe. How is it? Is it cool or not?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCool. It is really too cool. I never thought that Brother Lin could sing so well. In the past, I sang the lyrics that you gave to me but now I feel so inferior. I\u2019m afraid that I couldn\u2019t show the true essence of your songs and yet I still felt so satisfied with myself back then. No, I have to work even harder from now on,\u201d Wu Yuan Yue said.</p><br/><p>When she heard the \u2018Kiss Goodbye\u2019, the song filled her mind.</p><br/><p>Initially, she thought that she had shown the essence of the songs Brother Lin had given her to the finest of details. However, looking at it now, her singing was a pile of sh*t compared to it. Wait no, not even a pile of sh*t could compare to it.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cActually, your singing is already very good. Don\u2019t compare yourself to me. I\u2019m an insurmountable mountain. Do you understand?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Lin, when you put it like that, it\u2019s extremely hurtful. Can you at least give me some encouragement?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed. Afterward, they talked for a while before hanging up.</p><br/><p>Thereafter, he took a quick browse on the Internet and he realized that he already had a music fan base.</p><br/><p>To have such a status made him feel pretty awesome inside.</p><br/><p>However, he wondered why this task was still not finished. This was simply impossible.</p><br/><p>He had already done so well and yet he still hasn\u2019t completed the task. It was really too disgusting.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher,\u201d at this moment, he had Zhao Ming Qing\u2019s voice from afar.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was stunned. He felt happy inside, \u201cMing Qing, when did you get back?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing laughed and said, \u201cTeacher, your student just came back today. I just came from the airport to report to my teacher.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the appearance of Zhao Ming Qing and said, \u201cYou\u2019ve become a lot skinnier and darker. Looks like it was pretty tough there.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing said, \u201cIt wasn\u2019t that tough, it was just that the mountainous paths were not easy to walk on,\u201d then he rushed to introduce his friend, \u201cTeacher, this is the mute uncle. He followed me to Shanghai to find his daughter.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the old man next to Zhao Ming Qing. He looked like he was at least seventy. Then he said, \u201cHello mute uncle.\u201d</p><br/><p>The mute uncle waved his hand and was gesturing. An \u2018ah ah\u2019 sound came from his mouth. It was like he was trying to say hello to Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter coming back this time you\u2019re probably not going to go back right?\u201d Lin Fan asked.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing said, \u201cI won\u2019t be going back this year but I\u2019m preparing to go next year. The standards of medical treatment are very poor over there. I\u2019m thinking of getting help from the people on Weibo and then when I go down again next year, I\u2019d bring some medical equipment for them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan patted Zhao Ming Qing on the shoulder and said, \u201cYes. However, you have to pay attention to your own body. Don\u2019t push yourself.\u201d</p><br/><p>To be able to get the concern of his teacher, it made Zhao Ming Qing very happy. He nodded and said, \u201cGot it, Teacher.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, Lin Fan looked at the mute uncle and said, \u201cWhere is his daughter?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing said, \u201cI heard some of the villagers say that his daughter has a position at a company in Shanghai. I think she\u2019s a host at Shanghai TV.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was dumbfounded. Working at Shanghai TV. They definitely would not have too much discrepancy on that.</p><br/><p>The only thing was that looking at the mute uncle\u2019s clothing, it was really very old.</p><br/><p>If he had a daughter like that, he could not possibly be in this situation.</p><br/><p>It was like Zhao Ming Qing had seen the suspicions that his teacher had and said, \u201cTeacher, I\u2019ve asked the villagers already. His daughter has been in Shanghai all the while. However, the last time they made contact was two years ago. After that, they had no contact at all. The mute uncle didn\u2019t feel assured, so when he heard that I was from Shanghai, he followed me back.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, I don\u2019t know what is the situation is with his daughter. Even if she is very busy, she can\u2019t just go two years without even giving him a call. If it were my child, I would break his leg if he did that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan whispered, \u201cMing Qing, I don\u2019t think that the girl is the mute uncle\u2019s real daughter. Looking at him just now, he didn\u2019t have a son or daughter in his whole life. I think she was adopted.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing knew that his teacher was very powerful and had no suspicions as well. He said, \u201cTeacher, I heard from the villagers that the mute uncle\u2019s daughter was a girl that he picked up from the streets twenty over years ago and raised her himself. He raised her like she was his own. I\u2019m a little concerned that since she did not contact him in the past two years that something could have happened to her.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the mute uncle and then shook his head. He said, \u201cJudging by his appearance, it doesn\u2019t demonstrate the appearance that something happened to her. But since the mute uncle has already come here with you, we should send him to Shanghai TV, then send you home.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing nodded and said, \u201cOkay Teacher.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, Zhao Ming Qing looked at the mute uncle and said, \u201cMute uncle, we\u2019ll bring you to find your daughter.\u201d</p><br/><p>The mute uncle waved them off. He took out tens of dollars from his pocket and then let out a voice from his throat. It was like he was telling them that he could go himself and did not want to trouble them.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan did not say anything and said, \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p></div>\n</div>"}

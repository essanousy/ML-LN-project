Then, he grabbed it in disbelief, \"Don't you want to consider it?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled, \"No need to consider.\"</p><br/><p>Lu Li didn't give up yet, \"Two years free rent!\"</p><br/><p>\"Mmm.\"</p><br/><p>\"No more rent increases in future,\" Lu Li said.</p><br/><p>With the same smile, Lin Fan nodded indifferently.</p><br/><p>Silence.</p><br/><p>Liu Guo Qiang and the rest didn't know what to say. They didn't understand the situation at all. Chief Lu had given such generous conditions but he was still rejected.</p><br/><p>And those shop owners were a bit too stupid, weren't they? Didn't they have any decision-making abilities themselves? Why did they have to keep following Master Lin?</p><br/><p>But of course, Liu Guo Qiang didn't understand just how much trust the shop owners had in Master Lin. They knew that as long as they followed Master Lin, it didn't matter if it was North or South, they wouldn't have to suffer regardless of where they went.</p><br/><p>That was the kind of charisma that Master Lin had displayed.</p><br/><p>Lu Li, for the first time, felt so helpless in this situation. It was completely different from what he had imagined.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan opened his mouth, \"Just now, you shouldn't have torn the contract. Now you have to make a new one. How troublesome.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan then turned his gaze to the crowd. \"Everyone, go pack up your things. We'll be leaving soon. We need to save more time for renovating the new shops. Don't delay too much.</p><br/><p>The shop owners nodded. \"Don't worry, Little Boss. We won't have any problems with that.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded, then said to Lu Li, \"My apologies, Chief Lu, but I'm sticking with my decision. Let's cooperate again in future. I've already promised Chief Huang of Tian Hong Commercial Street. I'd rather not have to stand him up.\"</p><br/><p>Lu Li looked at Lin Fan. His heartfelt unwilling to give up. He had never thought that even though he appeared personally, the situation wouldn't be solved. This guy's way of thinking was strange. It was very different from the other people he had encountered before.</p><br/><p>\"You really don't want to reconsider?\" Lu Li couldn't resist asking once more.</p><br/><p>\"Really.\" Lin Fan was firm. This matter was finished. There was no need to ask about considering anymore.</p><br/><p>Lu Li felt as though he was a powerful fist thrown at cotton, simply useless. He felt extremely sullen. This was the first time he experienced the feeling of not being to solve a situation that he was displeased with.</p><br/><p>This had never happened before.</p><br/><p>Even against the most demanding clients, he could offer lucrative benefits to leave them with no way of rejecting him.</p><br/><p>Problems that had to do with money were not problems at all. If it wasn't solvable, it was because of a lack of money.</p><br/><p>But now, he had to give up. This problem clearly had to do with money, yet, he couldn't solve it.</p><br/><p>Lu Li stared at Lin Fan seriously but didn't say anything in the end. He then gave the orders to get the contract done and to refund a year's worth of rent to the shop owners as compensation.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan didn't want to accept this refund, but he couldn't refuse on behalf of the other shop owners. After all, they still needed money to pay for the renovations later on.</p><br/><p>Lu Li started to let it go. \"Alright, if you have any ideas in future, we can continue working together. This time, due to our Skyworth Organization's management negligence, we've caused trouble for you.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled and said, \"Of course, with a Chairman like you in Skyworth Organization, I will still maintain my trust in you guys.\"</p><br/><p>The Xin Yu Corporation left.</p><br/><p>Then, only the townsfolk and Lin Fan remained.</p><br/><p>\"Little Boss, you're really leaving. We can't bear it!\" said the townsfolk in a hurt tone.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan just smiled. \"Yeah, I'm leaving. But don't be too depressed. It's not like I'm going overseas. I'll still be in Shanghai. Come to visit when you have the chance. I will still welcome all of you.\"</p><br/><p>The townsfolk said, \"Little Boss, this is your decision and we wouldn't want to impede but can you remove the limit for today and let us eat one last time?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the crowd and laughed, \"Alright, no problem. Then I'll make sure everyone is filled up today. I'm going to miss all of you.\"</p><br/><p>The townsfolk replied, \"We will miss Little Boss too. If we have the time, we will surely go to Hong Tian District to visit Little Boss in future.\"</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang held his phone and said, \"Everyone, you've seen the conclusion. We are going to move to a new place. My Hong Tian District buddies, have you ever been this excited in your life? If you want to see Brother Yang, then hurry up. Brother Yang will be there waiting for you.\"</p><br/><p>Some of the netizens in the broadcast room were overwhelmed with happiness.</p><br/><p>\"Haha, Master Lin is finally coming.\"</p><br/><p>\"Hong Tian District is going to get lively. But what if we get ruled over by Master Lin's scallion pancakes?\"</p><br/><p>\"I hope that Master Lin can consider Qingpu District. We more than welcome you!\"</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian looked at their shop. \"When we move to the new place, we should get a bigger shop.\"</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan nodded. \"Yeah, that way, it will look more imposing.\"</p><br/><p>Wu Tian He didn't say anything, but just looked at her daughter and smiled. He had gotten used to their current life, especially the gradual change in his daughter's fortune. His heart could relax now. If he slowly grinded at it, things would turn out well eventually.</p><br/><p>Going through certain events with Master Lin had made him feel like he was young again, like he was back to his greenhorn days, reading fortunes for people.</p><br/><p>At that moment, an earth-shattering noise came from outside.</p><br/><p>\"Boo hoo. Master Lin won't be here anymore. My heart can't bear it.\"</p><br/><p>\"Today's scallion pancakes will seem even more delicious than before.\"</p><br/><p>\"I want to go to Hong Tian District to find work and become neighbors with Master Lin.\"</p><br/><p>\"Work is easy is find but such delicious scallion pancakes are hard to come by. For these delicious scallion pancakes, I've decided to change jobs and move.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was helpless. Even till the end, they didn't really love him but they only loved his scallion pancakes. The reality was harsh. His heart felt hurt and it wasn't going to recover for a while.</p><br/><p>He worked all the way until six o'clock.</p><br/><p>It was only until all the ingredients were depleted that he could finally stop and rest. Looking at all those red notes in the drawer, he had lost track of how many servings he had sold but it looked like at least several tens of thousands of dollars.</p><br/><p>This money had come too fast but it was also too painful.</p><br/><p>Therefore, when he moved to the new place, it was better to sell just ten servings a day after all. Twenty servings a day could be considered as well. Although it would be more tiring, he could earn a little more money each day. It might not be a bad choice.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Wang Ming Yang appeared at the shop entrance. \"You're really going to move?\"</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang had only found out when he saw his Weibo. His brother was really going to move. But it was all the same to him, as long as it was still in Shanghai.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. \"Yeah, I'm moving. Going to a new place, meeting new people and spreading my scallion pancakes to every district.\"</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang shrugged. \"That's up to you. It's hard to imagine that you'll be changing locations often next time. If the whole of Shanghai's citizens become trapped under the demonic powers of your scallion pancakes, how f*cked up would that be?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed as he said, \"Do you want me to die of fatigue? Then wouldn't all the Shanghai citizens come and queue up for my scallion pancakes?\"</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang came barging forward. \"I can't imagine that either. To rule the whole of Shanghai with the power of the scallion pancakes. I'm getting excited just thinking about it.\"</p><br/><p>\"Ahh,\" Lin Fan sighed, \"I think you're all just dreaming. Where are we gonna eat tonight?\"</p><br/><p>\"The same old place,\" replied Wang Ming Yang.</p><br/><p>\"Okay.\" Lin fan stood up and said, \"We'll close the shop and go in full force to the old place for a feast!\"</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian cried out, \"Time to eat some good food!\"</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang laughed cheerily too. This matter hadn't affected them at all. It was just a few days of rest.</p><br/><p>These bright and leisurely days were just beginning.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

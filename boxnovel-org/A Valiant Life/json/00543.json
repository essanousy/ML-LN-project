Those two girls are suffering from their own actions.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang was laughing as well, \u201cThey tried to taint Brother Lin\u2019s reputation but now that the truth is out, they\u2019re getting flamed. It might end up miserably for them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan had watched calmly as they put on an act and he never disturbed them. However, putting on an act has its risks too. The chances of something going wrong was very high.</p><br/><p>The direction of the wind on the Internet had started to change as they discussed this matter. The subject of public cleanliness workers had been brought up.</p><br/><p>And what added to the severity of the matter was that the Public Cleanliness Office\u2019s officials had started to speak, expressing that they would investigate further on this matter.</p><br/><p>This had turned out beautifully.</p><br/><p>Initially, if they had left the matter alone, probably nothing would have happened but these two girls actually went about causing their own deaths. No one else could be blamed for that.</p><br/><p>This felt great.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan swiftly updated his Weibo.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough public cleanliness workers do not stand out much, they provide boundless help to our city. This is something unmatched by anyone else. To be able to live in clean cities, we have to be grateful. As for these two idiots, you brought this upon yourselves.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c666\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is the first time I\u2019ve seen Master Lin make such a deep comment but the style of the last few words were incompatible with the earlier parts. I couldn\u2019t help laughing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLin Fan is just that domineering. Whoever dares to be impudent will get screwed by him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, I\u2019ll always be your fan!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis matter has been resolved beautifully.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Lin Fan had already stopped caring about this matter. These were all small matters and it would be boring to keep paying attention to them. Whether or not those two girls continued to try and cause trouble for him, it didn\u2019t matter. But judging by the situation, it didn\u2019t seem likely.</p><br/><p>At that moment, a call came from Zhao Ming Qing.</p><br/><p>\u201cMing Qing, what is it?\u201d asked Lin Fan as he answered the call.</p><br/><p>He had not been chatting with his student for this period of time, mainly because he had been in prison and this disciple of his had been immersed in the ocean of Chinese Medicine, unable to free himself from it.</p><br/><p>Over the phone, Zhao Ming Qing said in an excited voice, \u201cTeacher, the teaching materials have gone through the audit successfully. The Chinese medical experts from various universities think very highly of your teaching materials and they reckon that these are the most perfect teaching materials in recent generations.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan didn\u2019t have much of a reaction. \u201cOh, is that so? Alright then, is there anything else?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing was taken aback. \u201cTeacher, aren\u2019t you excited at all?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said indifferently, \u201cWhat\u2019s there to be excited about? Isn\u2019t it a very normal thing? Right, how has your Chinese medicine studies been lately? Have you come across any challenges?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. Earlier on, Elder Zhou was treating an important person but he had no way to treat his illness, so he told me to go have a try. I was at a loss at first too but after some research, we started making progress. Now, I\u2019ve already found a way to cure him and the effectiveness is pretty good,\u201d said Zhao Ming Qing excitedly. To him, this matter was enough to make him excited for a long time. He had never seen those kinds of symptoms before but during his time of studying with his teacher, he had understood a lot and his views towards illnesses had gradually changed as well. He had relied on his own knowledge and finally found a way to solve this problem.</p><br/><p>This sense of accomplishment, regardless of his old age, made him incomparably excited.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled, \u201cIs that so? Tell me, what symptoms were there?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing told him all of the symptoms, then explained the method of treatment that he had used. Lin Fan nodded as he heard this. It was not bad indeed. He had made a huge improvement. There were still some small issues with his methods but there was nothing big.</p><br/><p>After Lin Fan went through the issues, Zhao Ming Qing benefitted from them. However, he hadn\u2019t said the important part yet. \u201cTeacher, the Education Department is organizing a conference to discuss the teaching materials and they\u2019re hoping that you can join.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cConference, eh? Can I not join?\u201d Lin Fan disliked these conferences. They weren\u2019t anything substantial. Since the audit had already been done, what was the use of a conference? They should just start using the teaching materials and let the Encyclopedic Points start coming to him.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing said embarrassedly, \u201cTeacher, it\u2019s not too good if you don\u2019t join. Why don\u2019t you just come?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSigh,\u201d Lin Fan sighed, \u201cAlright then, I\u2019ll go. When is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTomorrow, nine in the morning.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGot it.\u201d</p><br/><p>After hanging up, Lin Fan looked at the time on his phone. It was still early. Then, he went to Nanshan Children\u2019s Welfare Institute. The fundraising had been completed but there were still some procedures that had to be done before the funds arrived.</p><br/><p>The matter of education would be left to Director Huang. Director Huang had been at Nanshan Children\u2019s Welfare Institute for almost her whole life. She was familiar with these things and she knew how to handle them.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan didn\u2019t understand these aspects very much so he wouldn\u2019t get involved. If he did not understand but still pretended to understand, that would really be scary.</p><br/><p>At a certain conference room in the Education Department.</p><br/><p>Some experts from the medical world were in discussion.</p><br/><p>One of the senior experts was reading the teaching materials. He nodded, \u201cThis is pretty good indeed. These teaching materials are much more well-rounded than the old ones. If there are no mistakes inside, we could probably use them for them for at least sixty years.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cProfessor Yang, you\u2019re a senior expert that has written teaching materials before. For this to be used for sixty years, isn\u2019t that a little exaggerated?\u201d</p><br/><p>Professor Yang waved his hand, \u201cNot at all. These are Chinese Medicine foundational teaching materials. The basic theories inside are very accurate and they\u2019re very extensive as well. It can be said that they have covered everything. I think that sixty years is already considered too short.\u201d</p><br/><p>Some of the other professors gave strange looks. They had some ideas about this.</p><br/><p>\u201cProfessor Yang, do you think we can sign our names on these?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, we should add our names on them. No matter what, we were the ones who audited them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Professor Yang had such thoughts as well but he was someone with good morals and virtues, so he said it less directly, \u201cAccording to the regulations, we didn\u2019t make any changes to these teaching materials, so it isn\u2019t right to sign our names. However, as long as there are certain parts that are lacking, we can add a few words and then sign our names.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, right, Professor Yang is right. We\u2019ve all been writing teaching materials for our whole lives. Adding a few points would be easy. However, would that Master Lin be agreeable?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s there not to agree about? We\u2019re senior experts. For us to add some personal opinions and adding our names in is something that many other people would beg for. What kind of objections could he have?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, we\u2019re all friends in here. Let me say something. That Master Lin\u2019s Chinese Medicine is indeed amazing but he is just a young kid, of course we can eat him up. If these teaching materials keep being passed, we can be remembered for generations to come by adding our names in.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis cannot be said in front of him. If he finds out, he\u2019ll definitely bang the table and scold us.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d</p><br/><p>The group of teaching material-writing big shots were extremely aroused. They had been invited by the Education Department to conduct an audit and were astonished by the contents of the teaching materials. It was really too well-rounded.</p><br/><p>They had been writing for their whole lives and could definitely distinguish between good and bad. For there to be such good teaching materials, it would be a shame not to sign their names on them.</p><br/><p>After all, it was very common for this kind of thing to be done within their circles.</p><br/><p>I sign your name, you sign my name, everyone signs each other\u2019s names and everyone helps each other out.</p></div>\n</div>"}

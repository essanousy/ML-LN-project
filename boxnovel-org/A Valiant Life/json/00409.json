You mentioned that you\u2019re going to conquer anorexia. Is that true? Or did you get hacked?\u201d a good friend of his asked.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing was full of confidence. \u201cOf course it\u2019s true. My mentor and I have been researching it intensively. There are some results and I believe the perfect medicine will be coming out soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMentor? Is that the young chap? Elder Zhao, that\u2019s\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing laughed confidently. \u201cit\u2019s okay, I know you don\u2019t believe my mentor is amazing. However, I\u2019ll let you guys know of his superior medical skills through this. You have to keep this a secret for me and not publicize it. My mentor hasn\u2019t told me that I can mention his name yet.\u201d</p><br/><p>They hung up after a while. Zhao Ming Qing\u2019s friend sighed after hanging up. He felt that Elder Zhao had gone mad. He didn\u2019t know how this was going to turn out and if someone were to make a big fuss out of it, it would definitely affect Chinese medicine.</p><br/><p>They both were experienced elderly men and they knew that there were baddies online who were anti-government. These people were corrupted and they wanted to destroy things like the national treasures and defame government officials. Those that didn\u2019t know the truth wouldn\u2019t be greatly impacted but things could go really wrong in certain circumstances. This matter had the potential to blow up.</p><br/><p><em>Ding ding!</em></p><br/><p>The phone came again.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing shook his head. But when he saw it was Elder Mu, he smiled. \u201cElder Mu, what\u2019s up?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Zhao, you\u2019re curing anorexia with Master Lin?\u201d Elder Mu was shocked.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing smiled. \u201cYeah, what is it? Are you not confident in us?\u201d</p><br/><p>There was silence.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that I\u2019m not confident. I have absolutely no confidence. You guys are rushing things. Although anorexia isn\u2019t a terminal illness, my understanding of it is that it is an even more complicated disease. You guys should\u2019ve said it after the prescription is out. You\u2019re attracting unnecessary attention and if this fails, it would be devastating,\u201d Elder Mu said.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, I believe in my mentor and he has made me understand something after guiding me. Let me tell you the truth. He has already come up with the prescription. However, he\u2019s just teaching me about it now to let me understand it. Do you think my teacher would let me do this if he wasn\u2019t confident?\u201d</p><br/><p>Mu Xian shook his head. \u201cElder Zhao, I realized that you\u2019ve really gone mad. You\u2019ve just had this mentor for a few days and you trust him so much? You gotta have your own way of thinking.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing smiled. \u201cAlright, alright. I\u2019ll hang up here. You guys don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><br/><p>He hung up the call.</p><br/><p>Mu Xian looked at his phone and shook his head helplessly. How could he not understand about Chinese medicine?</p><br/><p>A few calls later, Zhao Ming Qing was still really happy. Although his friends were all worried about him, he wasn\u2019t worried at all because he trusted his mentor.</p><br/><p>On the Internet.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, it\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve seen Chinese medicine being so awesome. It\u2019s really trying to prove something here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, trust me, this will be gone in a few days and the stupid old Chinese doctor will become a joke.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cComing up with a cure for anorexia is the stupidest joke I\u2019ve ever heard.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI agree. Chinese medicine has already fallen in favor. Just let it die. Why did this clown come up and say something like that? Furthermore, he\u2019s the director of a Chinese medical university.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, the Chinese medical academy is also an empty institute with no substance.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShanghai\u2019s First Chinese Medical Academy has been around since 1900. It had a lot of great masters in the past but it only started to accept students again after the war in 1975. The student cohort remains steady at about 1300 people. About 20% of them withdraw halfway and only 10% of them stick to becoming a Chinese medical doctor after graduation. The others turn to Western medicine and other professions. There are only a handful of famous Chinese medical doctors. The school became a reputable university after the government supported it. If not for the government, it would be just a small and lousy university.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe person above is right, his statistics are all correct.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI went to read the discussions on other Chinese medical doctors\u2019 Weibo. They don\u2019t think highly of this matter at all.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey\u2019re just waiting for a joke to happen.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian and the others didn\u2019t know what was happening between Lin Fan and Zhao Ming Qing. Lin Fan didn\u2019t want to tell them anything about it. However, when they saw what was happening online, they just laughed. Even a fool could tell that people didn\u2019t think highly of Chinese medicine at all.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing was indeed a pro at Chinese medicine but he couldn\u2019t help to make Chinese medicine a great success.</p><br/><p>Then, Lin Fan posted on Weibo.</p><br/><p>\u201cI believe Chinese medicine will have a prescription to cure anorexia. I\u2019ll just say this. If the prescription doesn\u2019t work, I will eat sh*t on a live broadcast. If the prescription works, all of you have to post good things about Chinese medicine in all your online groups. Does anyone want to bet on this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan had a few million fans on Weibo and it immediately caught their attention.</p><br/><p>\u201c666\u2026 Master Lin is going to eat sh*t on a broadcast? I\u2019m in.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c+1.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, take it slow. You\u2019re definitely going to lose this. It\u2019s not too late to withdraw from it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cToo awesome, I\u2019ll bet too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, I\u2019m so impressed. However, sometimes, you still have to look at the situation before acting. Everyone can see that this is an impossible feat.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian scrolled through his phone and gasped, \u201cD*mn, you\u2019re playing it too big this time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan was stunned. \u201cBrother Lin, don\u2019t do that. You\u2019ll definitely lose.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha.\u201d Lin Fan raised his head and looked extremely calm. \u201cI\u2019ll lose? Let me tell you that it\u2019s impossible for me to lose.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was just anorexia. How difficult could it have been? If not for training Zhao Ming Qing, he would have brought out the prescription already. However, Zhao Ming Qing was making decent progress and he was gradually able to grasp the medicine combinations. He still needed some time to make the prescription work.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, take care of the shop. I\u2019ll go out for a while,\u201d Lin Fan waved his hand and said.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian and the rest didn\u2019t know what he was up to but he had been acting suspiciously. They didn\u2019t know where else he could go besides the children\u2019s welfare institute.</p><br/><p>The web forum of the Shanghai\u2019s First Chinese Medical Academy was also buzzing.</p><br/><p>The students were discussing it intensely.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe director is crazy on Weibo. This is a shocking Weibo post about curing anorexia. Do you guys think he can do it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe it. Although Director Zhao has brilliant medical skills, it still can\u2019t beat Western medicine.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too late to regret after entering a Chinese medical university. I\u2019m extremely regretful. I get embarrassed to answer my family and friends back at home when they ask me what I\u2019m currently studying.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI agree. I thought I could get myself a girlfriend in university but there are only guys and that old fella here. It\u2019s hopeless.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWait till our school becomes a joke. I will definitely withdraw and study again to enroll in another university.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPathetic, how pathetic. Director Zhao is so old already, why did he cause such a stir on the Internet? He\u2019s going to get himself scolded by everyone.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, Director Zhao has been secretly researching about something in the lab with a young chap. Do you guys think he\u2019s researching about this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey\u2019re probably gays.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s old and probably has a lot of vitality.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c^ can you please be more respectful towards our director?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, anorexia isn\u2019t a normal disease. If it can be cured by just two people, the sun would rise from the west.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

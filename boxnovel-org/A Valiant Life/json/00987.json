However, he wouldn\u2019t have anything to do with this old man in the future. He knew that if he didn\u2019t eliminate the roots of the problem, it could grow out again.</p><br/><p>Especially when he saw how contemptible this old man was, acting righteous while doing despicable things, Lin Fan couldn\u2019t stand it.</p><br/><p>If Lin Fan didn\u2019t take completely crush him in one go, he wouldn\u2019t know what else to do.</p><br/><p>As for the situation on the Internet, Lin Fan waited quietly.</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang had been paying attention to Weibo. When Brother Lin posted the latest Weibo post, he thought that Brother Lin was explaining something. But when he saw the contents, he was completely dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>His eyes widened as he stared at Brother Lin in astonishment. \u201cBrother Lin, where did this come from?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled calmly. \u201cWhen you have more friends, you have more options. With more options, you have more ways of doing things as well. It\u2019s good that the friends I know are all very righteous.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang was dumbfounded. The contents of the post were very explosive. Now that Brother Lin had uploaded this, the effects were shocking. It was more than just a complete defeat. Perhaps the opposition might even think of killing himself.</p><br/><p>On the Internet.</p><br/><p>The Internet trolls were shaming him very delightfully. After all, they were hiding behind the Internet. As long as they had keyboards, they would dare to dig out a gigantic hole in the world.</p><br/><p>And the person being shamed was Master Lin. Some of those with poor attitudes were filled with jealousy and envy.</p><br/><p>Master Lin was just as young as them. How could this guy be so famous and have such a high status? Although he didn\u2019t have a beautiful female partner, they knew that he had very good relationships with several beautiful ladies.</p><br/><p>Hence, with jealousy as their motivation, they kept on shaming him on the Internet tirelessly.</p><br/><p>Some people were fans of Master Lin. However, seeing the previous news, they felt that Master Lin seemed to have gone overboard. He hadn\u2019t considered other people\u2019s feelings at all.</p><br/><p>But at that moment, the newly posted Weibo post by Master Lin made their jaws drop.</p><br/><p>They didn\u2019t dare to believe it.</p><br/><p>Could it be real?</p><br/><p>The comments completely erupted at this moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn! Is this for real? Are all those things said by Master Lin true?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s true, then we are all idiots. We even thought that the former Vice-Chairman was really worthy of respect. If this is true, I want to beat him to death.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe kept saying that it was for the good of the association. I didn\u2019t think that he was actually afraid that the reform would be too drastic and it would affect his benefits.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck, I said it all along. He was so set on preventing the reform, it turns out that it\u2019s because the reform affects his benefits. I couldn\u2019t tell. I really couldn\u2019t tell. He was actually so evil.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn. This old man even has extramarital affairs. I can\u2019t understand that. At his age, how can he even erect?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you stupid? Have you forgotten what he does? He\u2019s an old Chinese doctor. Those mysterious home remedies are scary. Even going all night wouldn\u2019t be a problem.\u201d</p><br/><p>To go against this reform, most of the Chinese Medical Association\u2019s members had banded together.</p><br/><p>With Zhang Guo Shou as the leader, they\u2019ve initiated a boycott. They believed that, with Elder Zhang\u2019s status, boycotting it was just a simple task.</p><br/><p>But at that moment, everyone was shocked.</p><br/><p>Because they had already seen Chairman Lin\u2019s latest Weibo post. Everyone looked at each other with a heavy sense of fear in their hearts.</p><br/><p>Especially when Zhang Guo Shou saw it, he was so furious that he gave up on his life. If he didn\u2019t think of all the wealth he had accumulated, he would want to just die right there.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow can this be? How can this be?\u201d Zhang Guo Shou paced back and forth in the house. In the end, he sat down on the chair and all his strength left his body.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Zhang Han had a stupefied look on his face as he looked at his father in disbelief. He raised his hand which was trembling with rage. \u201cDad, you have extramarital affairs.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Guo Shou waved his hand. \u201cAlright. It\u2019s already come to this. Don\u2019t think about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. Dad, you are really disappointing. Back then, Mom was angered to death by you. I didn\u2019t think that you haven\u2019t changed at all. You\u2026\u201d Zhang Han had known all those other things very well. However, he hadn\u2019t known about his dad\u2019s extramarital affairs at all. It was unbearable.</p><br/><p>When he had been young, he had lost his mother. Everything had been because of his father\u2019s fooling around that caused his mother to become bedridden due to rage. In the end, she passed away.</p><br/><p>He hadn\u2019t thought that, after so many years, his dad hadn\u2019t changed at all. His dad had been fooling around behind his back. Zhang Han was enraged.</p><br/><p>The association.</p><br/><p>When Zhou Qing Quan saw all this, he was astounded. He hadn\u2019t known about all this, not even the businesses Zhang Guo Shou was involved in. now that he saw all this information, he felt that it was earth-shattering.</p><br/><p>The former Vice-Chairman, even after retiring, had a huge influence. But who would have thought that he had meddled so much, using his connections for his personal benefit. This were simply shameless acts.</p><br/><p>Wang Tian Feng gasped, \u201cElder Zhou, Chairman Lin\u2019s capabilities are really scary. To find out all this information, it\u2019s really not easy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Qing Quan nodded. \u201cIndeed. This information is very complete. It feels as if Zhang Guo Shou said it all himself. But Chairman Lin has done a great deed. If he didn\u2019t say it, no one would believe that Zhang Guo Shou is actually so corrupted. If this had continued, the association would probably become one of his ways of gaining personal benefits.\u201d</p><br/><p>They really approved of this move by Chairman Lin. Since Zhang Guo Shou had done these things, he had to be prepared for them to be exposed. Although he wasn\u2019t young anymore, it wasn\u2019t a valid excuse.</p><br/><p>The remaining matters didn\u2019t concern them anymore. The rest would be left up to the relevant authorities.</p><br/><p>After this incident.</p><br/><p>The association\u2019s members quietened down. They seemed to already be afraid. Some of them removed their Weibo posts and some of them apologized. It seemed that they had recognized their faults.</p><br/><p>At the same time, some people started to push the blame.</p><br/><p>Everybody hits a man who is down.</p><br/><p>Zhang Guo Shou had fallen. Some members, in order to protect themselves, couldn\u2019t wait to rid themselves of any relations with him.</p><br/><p>\u201cI was forced. Zhang Guo Shou forced me to do that. I have brought shame to the association. I admit my mistake.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cZhang Guo Shou secretly manipulated the association. Those who didn\u2019t follow him would\u2019ve been suppressed. I truly love the Chinese Medical Association. Regarding my mistakes, I am sorry. I hope that the association will give me one more chance.\u201d</p><br/><p>One after another, they completely laid their cards on the table.</p><br/><p>The netizens were all startled as well. This turn of events had been too sudden.</p><br/><p>So sudden that it left them dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>Some netizens who had held Zhang Guo Shou in reverence felt as if they had swallow flies. It was disgusting.</p><br/><p>They had spoken in defense of such a person and even thought that Master Lin had been wrong.</p><br/><p>Thinking about that now, they were filled with regret. If they had trusted in Master Lin\u2019s decision, this wouldn\u2019t have happened.</p><br/><p>But the good thing was that it wasn\u2019t too late.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p></div>\n</div>"}

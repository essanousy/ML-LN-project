It wasn\u2019t a small thing to be able to achieve that. With the all the news about him circulating online, it was going to be big trouble.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck, is this for real? This is just too shady!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf this news is real, things would start to get really complicated from here with that terrible guy as the representative of the People\u2019s Congress.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is just plain despicable. He has been exposed by the Godly Doctor. If he had been treated, it would just spell more trouble. I can\u2019t believe that this b*stard used such an underhand tactic to prevent other people from getting treated by the Godly Doctor.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLuckily, the people who reported this stood on the side of justice.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe need more checks to expose all these corruptions and scandals.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe owed his workers money, didn\u2019t pay up and even beat them up. That is just pure evil and lawlessness.\u201d</p><br/><p>Weibo.</p><br/><p>This piece of news instantly became a sensation overnight, even hotter than the news of the Godly Doctor. It showed that the public cared the most about these kinds of news. How could there be this sort of people in such a harmonious society?</p><br/><p>Not only did he have money, he had influence and power.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, he was the representative of the People\u2019s Congress and he wasn\u2019t supposed to have any links with corruption and bribery.</p><br/><p>All the person-in-charge from the relevant department of national agencies sent Weibo posts.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis situation has come to our highest attention. We will conduct an investigation as soon as we can and bring justice to this situation.\u201d</p><br/><p>The netizens were all shocked.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, even the government agencies are appearing to control the situation.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo a thorough investigation. If there isn\u2019t any problem, nothing would happen. With the reports of the foreign workers being hospitalized, there definitely is something up.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey must also do an investigation on the foreign workers.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis kind of person could get that kind of position? Something is fishy.\u201d</p><br/><p>On the internet, when something happened, it spread like wildfire. Some of the leaders of different companies paid close attention to this situation.</p><br/><p>Wu Tao was sound asleep at home. Suddenly, his phone started ringing violently.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat the f*ck, who the hell is that calling so early in the morning?\u201d Wu Tao spurted, pissed off from being woken up so abruptly and early.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello, who is it?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly!</p><br/><p>Complete silence.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Wu Tao\u2019s sleepiness completely disappeared. His face completely changed in color as he started trembling.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d Wu Tao asked, unable to believe what he had just heard.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do those guys want? Do they have a death wish? Alright, raise a report then. I\u2019ll make sure they regret it!\u201d</p><br/><p>Slam!</p><br/><p>The person who was at the other end was stunned as he continued to shout into his phone, \u201cHey, hey!\u201d</p><br/><p>He wanted to call back again, but he had a million other things to tend to.</p><br/><p>In the hospital.</p><br/><p>The foreign workers who had no way to defend their legal rights looked at the reporters in a daze, not knowing what was going on. Just one day later, there were so many reporters and journalists in the hospital ward. Furthermore, when they came, they all gave the foreign workers gifts and reassured them that they were going to fight for their justice as they interviewed them about Wu Tao.</p><br/><p>At this moment, the helpless foreign workers finally saw some hope. They poured out everything they had experienced and everything they knew about Wu Tao.</p><br/><p>Bam!</p><br/><p>Suddenly, the doors of the hospital were flung open.</p><br/><p>A group of angry thugs bashed their way into the hospital ward, shouting. \u201cYou bloody foreign workers\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>An uproar!</p><br/><p>Everyone in the room turned and looked at the thugs who were standing at the doorway.</p><br/><p>The group of thugs was stupefied, looking around the room in a panic, before meekly retracing their steps. \u201cSorry, wrong room.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go.\u201d Because the situation was severe, people from all the relevant departments all gave the foreign workers an interview and that included the police department. Now there were people coming in to seek revenge; did they belittle the police department?</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re dead,\u201d one of the thugs quipped in dismay. He had never thought that this sort of situation would happen.</p><br/><p>This situation didn\u2019t affect Lin Fan in any way as he left the other people to do the work. Whatever the outcome was, Lin Fan didn\u2019t bother calculating too much. However, he was more than happy to add more fuel to the fire to make the situation even more severe.</p><br/><p>But with the situation developing to such a state, Lin Fan\u2019s help was completely unneeded.</p><br/><p>With all the relevant departments having their eyes on this situation and the huge influence of the netizens, one wrong move on Wu Tao\u2019s part would cause a huge problem.</p><br/><p>Anyone who had ties to Wu Tao would also be in question.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, the patients are just coming endlessly. I never thought that Chinese Medicine would have this kind of day,\u201d Zhao Ming Qing said excitedly, looking at the huge crowd of patients who were queuing up.</p><br/><p>This was something of a miracle for Zhao Ming Qing, who had opened done volunteer medical work before. Looking at the current situation, the difference was just too huge.</p><br/><p>Even if Zhao Ming Qing offered free treatment to people, no one would dare believe it. At most, a couple of old uncles and aunties would come to get their blood pressure checked for free.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was overjoyed.</p><br/><p>For him, this sort of situation was very normal. For a Godly Doctor like him, it would be weird if there weren\u2019t any patients at all.</p><br/><p>News of the Godly Doctor spread far and wide by words of mouth and the internet.</p><br/><p>Beijing.</p><br/><p>The Chinese Medical Association.</p><br/><p>Zhou Qing Quan looked at the pictures online and in that instant, felt a sense of regret.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou guys, take a look. This is the golden age of Chinese Medicine! So many patients queuing up for treatment! Could you ever have imagined this day?\u201d Zhou Qing Quan said, astonished at what he was seeing.</p><br/><p>The crowd shook their heads. This situation had surpassed their imagination. All of them were members of the Chinese Medical Association and all of them have had volunteer medical work experience before. However, when they compared themselves to this Godly Doctor, the difference was just too huge. There was no point in comparing at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cI really regret it! If I knew earlier, I would have gone with them!\u201d Zhou Qing Quan said.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t just Zhou Qing Quan who was feeling the regret. Vice President Wang Tian Feng also felt it. This sort of situation was rare and he had let the opportunity slip past his hands.</p><br/><p>If he had another chance, he would definitely have chosen to follow them.</p><br/><p>Shanghai\u2019s first Chinese Medical Academy.</p><br/><p>A heated discussion!</p><br/><p>\u201cShocking! Director Zhao and the rest are all so awesome! Their clinic in Jiangning is so popular!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn! I\u2019m amazed. I know Qiu Jie and Zhang Tong Tong personally. The internet is now calling them the most attractive upcoming successors of Chinese Medicine!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mmit, if I knew earlier, I would have signed up as well. So much regret!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou had your chance. In the end, only both of them signed up. No one else was willing to go.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs Chinese Medicine that amazing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFrom what I read online, there were people who had diseases which were severe but under his treatment, all of them were cured.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not so sure now. Should I continue learning Chinese Medicine or do I change to Western Medicine?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMe too! I don\u2019t know which one to choose!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf Chinese Medicine is that impressive and we jump over to Western Medicine, will we regret it next time?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPal, I won\u2019t say anything else but Director Zhao is an amazing person and our institution is the finest. Recently, there were quite a lot of journalists who came to our school for interviews and all the department heads were all busy dealing with them.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Godly Doctor\u2019s volunteer medical clinic had gotten a lot of attention and the netizens had also started comparing Western Medicine with Chinese Medicine.</p></div>\n</div>"}

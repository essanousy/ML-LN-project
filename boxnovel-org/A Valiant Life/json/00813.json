He took several buses before arriving at his destination.</p><br/><p>Then, he saw a cleaner cleaning the road and he went forward, \u201cSorry, may I know where is Master Lin\u2019s shop?\u201d</p><br/><p>The cleaner was ecstatic when she saw that it was a Caucasian. \u201cAre you here to buy scallion pancakes?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Henry Wang nodded.</p><br/><p>The cleaner held onto the broom and said, \u201cYoung man, I think you should forget about it today. Master Lin only sells scallion pancakes in the morning. I think you\u2019ve missed the timing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Henry Wang replied, \u201cMay I know where is his shop?\u201d</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t expect the Chinese lady to be so chatty. He wanted to end the conversation quickly, or else he didn\u2019t know when it would end.</p><br/><p>The cleaner was clearly not going to tell him the answer immediately, \u201cMaster Lin\u2019s scallion pancakes are seriously terrific. I would smell the aroma every morning when I come to clean the streets. It is unbearable. When you place it in your mouth, the taste is\u2026 literally indescribable.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know, you\u2019re just here to try your luck. Let me warn you that it is really difficult. People have come and queued for an entire month and they still didn\u2019t manage to buy it. They almost went crazy,\u201d the cleaner lady rambled on.</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t want to let go of this Caucasian in front of her.</p><br/><p>However, this Caucasian seemed really young.</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung man, are you married?\u201d</p><br/><p>Henry Wang was stunned. She wasn\u2019t answering his question at all. He just wanted to find out where Master Lin\u2019s shop was. It had nothing to do with his marital status.</p><br/><p>Then, Elder Liang walked past, \u201cWoman, he\u2019s asking about the location of Master Lin\u2019s shop. Are you trying to matchmake your daughter again?\u201d</p><br/><p>The cleaner lady smiled upon seeing Elder Liang, \u201cI think he looks decent so I just wanted to ask.\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Liang smiled. Then, he looked at the Caucasian, \u201cMaster Lin\u2019s shop is just in front.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Henry Wang said and nodded. Then, he walked towards the shop. He was feeling a little fearful.</p><br/><p>At the entrance of Master Lin\u2019s shop.</p><br/><p>Henry Wang looked at it and was a little stunned. What kind of shop was that?</p><br/><p>It didn\u2019t look like one that made delicacies.</p><br/><p>\u201cMay I know if this is Master Lin\u2019s scallion pancake shop?\u201d Henry Wang asked. He had to ask if it was the right shop.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian was smoking at the entrance and when he saw someone approaching the shop, he immediately went forward, \u201cYes, this is the famous Master Lin scallion pancake shop. However, the timing for the scallion pancakes has passed. Do you want to have your fortune read?\u201d</p><br/><p>Henry Wang looked around, \u201cI think you don\u2019t seem like you sell delicacies. Where is the cooking set up?\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian smiled, \u201cWe don\u2019t need to set up anything. We just need a pushcart. Do you want to have your fortune read? You can come here again tomorrow to buy the scallion pancakes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Henry Wang was really doubtful. It didn\u2019t even look like a proper scallion pancake shop. How delicious could their scallion pancakes be if they didn\u2019t have a proper shop?</p><br/><p>He felt like he got cheated again.</p><br/><p>However, those people that he just met really recommended the scallion pancakes here. He was really curious and he felt that there was something he hadn\u2019t found out yet.</p><br/><p>At the same time, he thought of something.</p><br/><p>Never judge a book by its cover.</p><br/><p>Just because a shop looked ordinary, he couldn\u2019t belittle it. However, he really wanted to roast the shop owners. They could\u2019ve made the shop look better.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am not here to have my fortune read. I am here to buy scallion pancakes,\u201d Henry Wang said.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian was disinterested when he heard that he wasn\u2019t there to have his fortune read. \u201cSince you\u2019re not here for fortune-telling, come back here tomorrow for scallion pancakes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat time tomorrow?\u201d Henry Wang asked.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian replied, \u201c9 am tomorrow.\u201d</p><br/><p>To Henry Wang, he had to try it once regardless of what happened. \u201cAlright, sorry for the inconvenience. I will be back tomorrow.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, he left.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian shook his head, \u201cThis Caucasian is so ignorant. He might not even buy any pancakes when he comes here tomorrow.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan stood up, \u201cAlright, look after the shop. I will be heading to the Children\u2019s Welfare Institute.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan\u2019s life was pretty routine now. He only went home, Cloud Street and the Children\u2019s Welfare Institute.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t have anything else to do besides these things.</p><br/><p>The next day!</p><br/><p>In the morning.</p><br/><p>Henry Wang went there early in the morning. He didn\u2019t understand the reason for the shop\u2019s rules and regulations. Why would they open at 9 am and only sell ten scallion pancakes every morning? Furthermore, would people really be there to buy them?</p><br/><p>However, when he reached the shop, he was instantly stunned.</p><br/><p>What the f*ck?</p><br/><p>What was going on? Why were there so many people?</p><br/><p>Those townsfolk that were queuing up started to look at Henry Wang in confusion.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, Master Lin\u2019s scallion pancakes are awesome. Even a Caucasian is here to queue for them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never seen him before. He must be new here. Who is going to tell him about the rules here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do it. We have to tell him about it since he is new here so that he won\u2019t do anything that he would regret.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although everyone was there to buy scallion pancakes, they were still the \u2018seniors\u2019 and they had to explain things to the first timer.</p><br/><p>This was the experience that they had accumulated from spending their mornings there.</p><br/><p>Initially, there were people who queued up for the scallion pancakes for a long time but didn\u2019t manage to get them. They were furious and wanted to smash Master Lin\u2019s pushcart. The townsfolk didn\u2019t want to let that repeat again. How could they let someone so arrogant misbehave in front of Master Lin?</p><br/><p>They had to prevent it right from the start.</p><br/><p>Of course, they couldn\u2019t have done it in a friendly way.</p><br/><p>Hence, it was ultimately for the peace and harmony of the situation there.</p><br/><p>Some of the experienced people grouped together and whenever there were first-timers, they would go forward to speak to the person.</p><br/><p>Initially, they explained that they had to be patient for Master Lin\u2019s scallion pancakes. It depended on their luck. If they weren\u2019t lucky, they wouldn\u2019t be able to get it even after waiting for a month.</p><br/><p>Hence, they had to tell them to behave themselves if that were to happen. They could choose to leave but they should never pretend like they own the place.</p><br/><p>Especially since this first-timer was a Caucasian, they felt that they had to communicate effectively with him. If this foreign friend were to blow up right there, it would definitely be a messy affair.</p><br/><p>Henry Wang didn\u2019t expect these people to be so welcoming. They hadn\u2019t seen him before and they actually came forward to speak to him.</p><br/><p>After hearing what they said, Henry Wang smiled and nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t do that. Rules are rules and I will obey them.\u201d</p><br/><p>The townsfolk that were queueing up were relieved after hearing that.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan stood at the pushcart and he was preparing the first scallion pancake.</p><br/><p>Henry Wang was being trapped in the crowd and he couldn\u2019t see what was happening. Suddenly, there was an aroma in the air. It was something he had never smelled before.</p><br/><p>It was simply unbelievable.</p><br/><p>Then, he saw a youngster holding the first scallion pancake in his hands. He took a bite and everyone stared at him with envy.</p><br/><p>Henry Wang was shocked by what followed after that. The normal-looking youngster suddenly looked abnormal.</p><br/><p>His expressions looked really exaggerated.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow could that be?\u201d Henry Wang was in disbelief. The youngster\u2019s looked as if he just had an orgasm.</p><br/><p>Could the scallion pancake be that delicious?</p><br/><p>Then, he was filled with even more anticipation.</p></div>\n</div>"}

He didn\u2019t dare to believe it.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother, you\u2019re way too thick-skinned.\u201d He didn\u2019t even know what to say anymore. Although he would\u2019ve been able to see the Secretary with his social status and wealth, he would definitely be unable to get the Secretary to help out with such a big matter.</p><br/><p>But thinking about how f*cking awesome his brother was, what else was there to say? He could only say that he was proud.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. \u201cWhat do you mean thick-skinned? This is a good deed after all.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, you\u2019re right. If we can be exempted from the taxes, it would be a huge amount saved. Oh right, is the government going to subsidize anything?\u201d asked Wang Ming Yang anxiously.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said helplessly, \u201cThat\u2019s enough. You really are greedy. They\u2019re already helping us out so much. It\u2019s already a great thing and you still want subsidies. Why don\u2019t you subsidize it yourself?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI was just asking. I didn\u2019t have any intentions.\u201d Wang Ming Yang laughed.</p><br/><p>If this was really successful, things would be much easier to handle.</p><br/><p>At the same time, Wang Ming Yang thought about the situation on the Internet and felt a fire burning in his gut. <em>Those people are really ridiculous. When this matter is revealed, let\u2019s see what they have to say.</em></p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cAlright then. I\u2019m hanging up. This matter will be settled by tomorrow.\u201d</p><br/><p>After hanging up, Lin Fan felt delightful. He started his car and just roamed around on the road. As for the situation on the Internet, he had tossed it to the back of his mind long ago.</p><br/><p>Trying to explain too much was just a waste of saliva. He decided to just let them talk. When the documents are passed down, all he would have to do is take a picture of it.</p><br/><p>He arrived at one of Shanghai\u2019s public squares.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was in no hurry to go back. He started to search for a target and see if there were any suitable people. He was still short of a few people for the task and he wanted to finish it as soon as possible.</p><br/><p>Although he might not meet a suitable person, coming here to test his luck was a pretty good option.</p><br/><p>He stayed there until nighttime.</p><br/><p>And he really managed to find a suitable person. When he took out that wooden carving, that person\u2019s expression changed as if he didn\u2019t know what was the meaning of that.</p><br/><p>But in the end, that person still accepted the carving and kept it in his pocket.</p><br/><p>There were many kindhearted people who didn\u2019t have things going their way. However, Lin Fan was rather unlucky and hadn\u2019t met many of them yet.</p><br/><p>At night.</p><br/><p>On the Internet!</p><br/><p>A certain friend group started discussing.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is up with Master Lin? He hasn\u2019t replied in a day. Could it be that it\u2019s really as the Internet says?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not possible. There must be something else going on. If you tell me that the Master Lin that I believe in only took over the welfare institute because of that piece of land, I won\u2019t believe you even if you beat me to death.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMe too. I believe in him too. All these news must be fake.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSigh, I think you guys trust Master Lin too much. This kind of situation is common. After all, how many people could resist such a temptation?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat sounds quite true.\u201d</p><br/><p>In a certain household, a family of three was having dinner.</p><br/><p>\u201cSon, what are you doing? Why do you look so troubled when you look at your phone?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDad, they\u2019re saying on the Internet that Master Lin only took over the welfare institute because he wanted that piece of land. But I don\u2019t believe them. What do you think?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSigh, what\u2019s there to think about things like that? It doesn\u2019t even concern you. Just do good on your part.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. Master Lin is my idol. I have to be clear about this. Otherwise, I can\u2019t even enjoy my food in peace.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat else is there to say? Everyone likes money. Even Master Lin likes money. It\u2019s such a big piece of land and it\u2019s even in the center of Shanghai. It must be worth a great deal of money.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not possible. Master Lin isn\u2019t like other people.\u201d</p><br/><p>The mother couldn\u2019t keep on watching.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, alright. What are you two arguing about? Hurry up and eat.\u201d</p><br/><p>Some celebrities who had a grudge against Lin Fan started laughing to themselves when they saw this piece of news. They didn\u2019t dare to flame Master Lin on the Internet but seeing this kind of bad rumor spread, they were all elated.</p><br/><p>One of those people was Ying Jin. Ever since that incident with Lin Fan, she had been very miserable.</p><br/><p>Right now, she was already overseas. She couldn\u2019t even go back to China.</p><br/><p>What was the point of going back? She would only get flamed by the people there.</p><br/><p>Perhaps when the right time came, like when this Master Lin fell from power, she might go back to start afresh.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph. Lin, I didn\u2019t think that even you would have such a day. I\u2019m waiting for you to be scolded to death.\u201d</p><br/><p>Thinking about past events, she felt wronged. If it hadn\u2019t been for that Lin, she would still be that high and mighty empress. But now, whenever she went to search for news related to herself, they were all criticizing her. There wasn\u2019t even a single word of praise.</p><br/><p>*Ding ding*</p><br/><p>At that moment, as Ying Jin was looking at Weibo, someone sent her a message. Hearing that notification sound, she already knew what was going on. Someone must have sent her a personal message to scold her.</p><br/><p>But when she opened the message, she was stunned.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you hate that person with the surname Lin? Do you want to kill him? Have you been defeated and crushed by him? If you have, please join this group. The people inside are all like you.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Ying Jin saw this message, she had wanted to delete it. But for some reason, she felt as if there were like-minded people inside, so she curiously decided to join.</p><br/><p>When she joined, the comments inside started appearing at an insane rate.</p><br/><p>\u201cWelcome, welcome. Our team has become stronger once again.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe all hate that guy\u2019s guts.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet me say this. My oppa has been crushed and sent back to his country by this Lin. I won\u2019t ever get to see my oppa again. I want revenge.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m a pharmacist. I hoarded a large amount of medicine and now, I can\u2019t sell it. I want to tarnish this guy\u2019s reputation for the rest of my life.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m a human-trafficker. It\u2019s because of this Lin who meddled with my business that I\u2019m now a fugitive.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNewcomer, what relationship do you have with that Lin?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ying Jin saw these messages and instantly felt as if she had found a team. Her hate for Lin Fan had always been bottled up in her heart and she had never been able to release it. But now that she had joined the group, she suddenly felt as if she had found close friends.</p><br/><p>But now that they were asking her that, she couldn\u2019t say that she was Ying Jin. Instead, she thought about it.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m Ying Jin\u2019s fan. Because of him, I can\u2019t see my idol anymore.\u201d Ying Jin was quite satisfied with this reason she had come up with.</p><br/><p>\u201cYing Jin? That ugly hag?\u201d</p><br/><p>When Ying Jin saw that, she instantly raged and replied, \u201cWhat the f*ck did you just say? Who are you calling an ugly hag?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry, it was a slip of the tongue. Alright, we\u2019re all friends here. I\u2019ll give you the task now. Hurry up and go on Weibo and repost the news. This time, we have a great opportunity. That guy is done for.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Ying Jin saw this, she eagerly went to repost that piece of news.</p><br/><p>A grand empress like her had turned into a hater and an Internet troll. It was really quite tragic.</p></div>\n</div>"}

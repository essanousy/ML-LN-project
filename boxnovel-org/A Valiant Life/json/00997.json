He really didn\u2019t want it to be this way. He felt that showing off was not his style. However, in such a situation, he had no choice but to show off a little.</p><br/><p>This was the Elder Dog who was going to become one of Touching China\u2019s Top Ten People. If they were to capture him, how would he receive his award?</p><br/><p>It would have huge impact, hence, they had to consider it carefully.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian said, \u201cLet me tell you that Little Boss is not boasting. It\u2019s true. The delivery man just came personally to deliver it.\u201d Then, he raised the invitation letter into the air. \u201cLook at the stamp. It\u2019s real.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang said, \u201cFor Elder Dog to be chosen, it is well-deserved. Previously, there was an advertisement saying that dogs are good friends of humans. For a dog like this that loves and protects humans, he is a good friend among good friends.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThinking back when Elder Dog lead a hundred dogs to battle the human traffickers, that was really awe-inspiring.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLater on, he even charged bravely into a fire. His whole body had been burned and covered in black soot but he brought the dying infant out. Even humans wouldn\u2019t have such bravery.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd another time, Elder Dog dived into the water and dragged three drowning people out. Who could compare to such a heroic dog?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t even get me started on that time he helped an old granny cross the road and rescued the granny who had fainted in the middle of the road.\u201d</p><br/><p>In one breath, Zhao Zhong Yang praised Elder Dog endlessly.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Elder Dog, who had been furious before, raised his head proudly as he heard all his accomplishments. His eyes glimmered with a strong and steady light as if he had been touched by his own deeds.</p><br/><p>The shop owners nodded as well. \u201cYeah. When you think about that, it makes sense. Elder Dog is really that capable.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the crowd, then at the workers. \u201cHeard that? I\u2019m not stopping you from enforcing the law but this really will not do. This dog has to go and attend the prize presentation. And these dogs are all his comrades as well as his family. If you take them away like that, will your leader agree? Why don\u2019t you give your leader a call. As long as he agrees, I won\u2019t say more and you can even take this dog away. The worst case is that I\u2019ll go to the prize presentation ceremony alone and say that the hero has been captured by you guys and buried alive. Is that alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>When the workers heard that, they groaned in their hearts. <em>Why does this sound like a f*cking story? But this story really seems true. </em>Then, they hesitated for a moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet us make a call then.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded. \u201cAlright, go ahead.\u201d</p><br/><p>One of the workers took out his phone and called their leader. When he explained the situation, the leader started scolding them furiously, calling them brainless for believing such things. But when he heard that it was Master Lin who had said those things, the leader immediately took it more seriously.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, our leader would like to speak to you.\u201d The worker had been berated by their leader. Then, he helplessly passed the phone to Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan received the phone. \u201cHello, leader. I\u2019m Master Lin from Cloud Street. This is the situation. My dog is very honorable. He has been chosen as one of the Touching China\u2019s Top Ten People and he was the only dog chosen. You guys are capturing stray dogs and I don\u2019t think you\u2019re doing a bad thing but you\u2019re trying to capture my heroic dog. I feel that I have to say something about it, otherwise, if something happens later on, wouldn\u2019t I be to blame for not giving you a heads up?\u201d</p><br/><p>The leader on the other end of the call seemed to have been stunned by Lin Fan\u2019s words. Then, the sound of a keyboard being pressed could be heard. He was probably searching it up on the Internet.</p><br/><p>Most major awards had their results reported on the Internet.</p><br/><p>When he saw the the list of the Top Ten People on the website and saw that one of them was not a human, he was shocked. He felt that he had lived his life for so many years for nothing.</p><br/><p>*Cough cough!*</p><br/><p>He coughed a few times.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, it\u2019s a misunderstanding. I made a mistake in my arrangements. These are all heroes, isn\u2019t that right? If I had known, I wouldn\u2019t have arranged for this to happen.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, please don\u2019t talk about this joke of an incident when you go to the award ceremony. I won\u2019t be able to take it.\u201d</p><br/><p>The leader wasn\u2019t afraid of anything else but he was just afraid of Master Lin going to the award ceremony and recounting this incident as a joke.</p><br/><p>Master Lin wouldn\u2019t be bothered if he said it but the leader would be in trouble. In the best case scenario, he would get scolded by the public. The worst case was that he would be criticized by his organization for not doing his job well.</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan heard that, he couldn\u2019t help but laugh. \u201cAlright, alright. I definitely won\u2019t talk about it. But leader, I have to give you a heads up. The person who reported this is that Zhou Shi Ming, right? Let me tell you that it is best not to interact with him. He is a lot of trouble.\u201d</p><br/><p>When the leader heard that, he felt that something wasn\u2019t right.</p><br/><p>He knew about Master Lin\u2019s capability. Thinking about that Liu Xiao Tian from the local police station, things had been smooth sailing for him ever since he had gotten to know Master Lin. The leader really envied him.</p><br/><p>But thinking about today\u2019s incident, he felt that something really wasn\u2019t right.</p><br/><p>He had only just interacted with that guy the previous day and he was already facing this problem today. What Master Lin said was really accurate.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you, Master Lin, for the heads up. I will remember it. I\u2019ll get those people to hurry back right now,\u201d said the leader anxiously.</p><br/><p>He really didn\u2019t want to allow this situation to drag on. If he had known that this would happen, even though that person was a wealthy tycoon, he wouldn\u2019t be bothered. This matter would only cause trouble for himself.</p><br/><p>As for that dog being chosen as one of Touching China\u2019s Top Ten People, he felt that it defied all logic.</p><br/><p>Then, he didn\u2019t think more and just called the workers back hurriedly.</p><br/><p>The worker who received the phone had a look of embarrassment on his face.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan saw that things were pretty much settled. \u201cDoggy, go and release your little brothers then.\u201d</p><br/><p>To the workers, this dog seemed to understand human speech. After Master Lin said that, Elder Dog immediately ran to the car boot. He raised his paws and unlocked the cages from above before opening the cage doors and letting the dogs out.</p><br/><p>Then, the dogs that had been released wandered around in a circle before skillfully opening the other cages as well.</p><br/><p>It was like seeing a ghost. They had captured so many stray dogs but this was their first time seeing such a thing. If they hadn\u2019t seen it for themselves, they wouldn\u2019t have believed it.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the workers and said, \u201cYou guys have to grow bigger hearts in the future. Capturing mad dogs is fine but you have to be kinder to some pitiful stray dogs. They\u2019re all living things too.\u201d</p><br/><p>Right now, no matter what Master Lin said, they would accept it. They nodded their heads frantically, absorbing his words into their minds.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded. \u201cAlright then. Go on then. Remember, our Cloud Street\u2019s dogs are all good dogs, got it?\u201d</p><br/><p>The workers nodded once again in response. This had been really eye-opening for them. They would have to go back and tell people about it.</p><br/><p>A dog chosen as one of Touching China\u2019s Top Ten People. Would you believe that?</p><br/><p>Even a ghost wouldn\u2019t believe that!</p><br/><p>\u2026</p></div>\n</div>"}

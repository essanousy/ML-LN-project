As he described the whole first half of Brother He's life, they chose to stop believing him.</p><br/><p>Who would dare to believe him?</p><br/><p>But now, Brother He actually admitted to it personally. How could they all not be shocked?</p><br/><p>They were in an uproar!</p><br/><p>\"It can't be. Brother He, was what he said really accurate?\"</p><br/><p>\"I don't believe that. Brother He must have planned this with them to play a prank on us. If it was real, that would be too scary!\"</p><br/><p>Some people had their mouths wide open, some had their eyes gaping while some had a flabbergasted look on their faces.</p><br/><p>Especially when He Cheng Han said that he was convinced, the whole place went completely silent as they felt that everything was too unreal. It was unbelievable.</p><br/><p>\"How exactly did you know all that?\" He Cheng Han asked once more. He had to get things straight.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed and said calmly, \"Didn't I say from the start? I'm a fortune-teller. Of course, I can see through all that.\"</p><br/><p>He Cheng Han was lost for words. When he saw Lin Fan's eyes, he didn't even know how to open his mouth.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan, on the other hand, wasn't bothered by this. He said, \"Chief He, I said everything so bluntly, I hope you don't mind.\"</p><br/><p>\"No...I don't mind.\" He Cheng Han couldn't figure it out. What the heck was going on? It wasn't that he didn't want to believe it but he really didn't dare to believe it. It was beyond his expectations and it wasn't even within the realm of science anymore.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, he thought of what Wang Ming Yang had said at the start. Words that no one had bothered to think much about.</p><br/><p>\"I admit my loss. I probably have never been so convinced of my loss in my whole life,\" said He Cheng Han.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed, \"It's just for the fun. Don't take it as the truth.\"</p><br/><p>He Cheng Han stared blankly at Lin Fan. \"Ming Yang has done it this time. He's really done it. I was willing to bet and I'm willing to lose. I'll stick to my word.\"</p><br/><p>That old brother who had bet ten million sighed, \"Me too. Although it's a large sum of money, it's worth it. I only hope that I will be able to gain Master Lin's friendship.\"</p><br/><p>Li Hao laughed, \"Brother Zhang, that's a large price for a friend. But I still feel that it is a profitable move. If you can be friends with Master Lin, a one-time payment of ten million is not much at all.</p><br/><p>Brother Zhang laughed, \"You're good at everything, kid. But you talk too much. If you need anything in future, don't find me for help.\"</p><br/><p>\"Don't say that, Brother Zhang! I was wrong but please don't stop caring about me,\" said Li Hao hurriedly with a slight laughter.</p><br/><p>Brother Zhang shook his head, then looked at Lin Fan. \"Master Lin, let's be friends.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed, \"We're all seated here already, of course we're friends\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"Master Lin is a straightforward man,\" said Brother Zhang.</p><br/><p>At that moment, He Cheng Han said, \"Master Lin, you only spoke until when I reached forty-five. What about after that?\"</p><br/><p>Suddenly, everyone held their breaths as they listened intently.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled and waved his hand. \"Chief He, if you were to know your whole life ahead of you, would it have any meaning? Ignorance is bliss. A life filled with pleasant surprises is much more marvelous. Alright, alright, enough about this. Let's talk about something else.\"</p><br/><p>He Cheng Han nodded, acknowledging those words.</p><br/><p>No one can say accurately what is to come. One might be able to see into the future, but it can always be changed and it can change drastically. If Lin Fan told He Cheng Han everything about his future, then that future would definitely be changed.</p><br/><p>That's why it was better not to talk about that.</p><br/><p>If he said it too straightforwardly, he would get struck by lightning.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Lin Fan was surrounded by a crowd.</p><br/><p>Li Hao was happily calling Lin Fan 'Brother'.</p><br/><p>Sometimes, when Lin Fan talked a little about this topic, everyone would change their minds. Right now, these people all wanted him to read their fortunes.</p><br/><p>But some things could be talked about. Giving pieces of advice here and there was no big issue.</p><br/><p>What made Lin Fan pleasantly surprised was that this gathering that he thought would be meaningless had actually turned out to provide so much support for the Children's Welfare Institute.</p><br/><p>With his level of ability, who could not be convinced? There was just no way not to be convinced. Chief He ran a toy business and at that moment, he was banging his chest and saying proudly that he would provide all the toys for that Children's Welfare Centre from then on.</p><br/><p>As for the others, they were doing the same. Those that had promised to donate things were going to donate abundantly.</p><br/><p>The reason was simple. Lin Fan had said a single phrase, \"To be lucky, you need to be kind.\"</p><br/><p>It was just a few casual words but they all really believed it.</p><br/><p>If it was anyone else saying it, they would have just scoffed at it. But because it was from Master Lin, they had to believe it.</p><br/><p>Halfway through, Master Lin went to the toilet.</p><br/><p>Jin Yun Min was suddenly surrounded by the crowd. He had gotten a piece of advice from Master Lin earlier and it made them all very envious of him. They felt that Elder Jin's luck was way too good.</p><br/><p>Even then, they wanted Master Lin to give some advice but Master Lin kept changing the topic. This made them frustrated and they all fixed their eyes on Jin Yun Min.</p><br/><p>\"Elder Jin, we're friends, right? Master Lin gave you advice, right? Don't forget about me. For your next project, I want to invest in it.\"</p><br/><p>\"Brother Jin, my luck hasn't been good recently. You have to let me invest as well.\"</p><br/><p>\"Ahem, are you free tomorrow? I have a bottle of wine that I've been saving for thirty years. Let us two brothers finish it tomorrow.\"</p><br/><p>Jin Yun Min was a little annoyed. He looked at those people and said, \"The last time I wanted to drink, you said you were saving it for your grandkid. And now you want to let me drink?\"</p><br/><p>\"Ahh, what are you saying? When did I say that I would save it for my grandkid? It was because I had only preserved it for twenty-nine years and eight months at that time. It just reached thirty years today!\"</p><br/><p>Jin Yun Min laughed, \"Alright, alright. Everyone here has been friends of mine for many years. If there's money, we'll earn it together. Since Master Lin gave me some advice, I can't forget about you guys. Let's invest together then. If it's money or friendship, I'd rather take the latter!\"</p><br/><p>\"I respect you, Elder Jin.\"</p><br/><p>\"Good brother. That's real loyalty.\"</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>\"Hey, if you're talking about loyalty, then Ming Yang is the really loyal one here. He was willing to introduce such a f*cking awesome brother to us. But really, where has Ming Yang gone? I haven't seen a shadow of him since after he got here.\"</p><br/><p>\"He's upstairs, playing cards with Chen Li Hao. It seems they're playing with big money.\"</p><br/><p>\"It can't be. He dares to play with Chen Li Hao? That guy is famous for being merciless in his gambling.\"</p><br/><p>\"Even I'm afraid of that Li Hao kid. He seems normal but when he's at the gambling table, he's a whole other person. It's really terrifying.\"</p><br/><p>\"That's enough talk. Master Lin is back, let's chat with him.\"</p><br/><p>During this Salon, Lin Fan was like everyone's baby. He was like a natural socializer, engaging in all kinds of talk and gossip with everyone else.</p><br/><p>But what made Lin Fan delighted was that he could chat about different things with these people. He heard many funny things that he wouldn't normally hear. And unknowingly, he had expanded his knowledge again.</p><br/><p>At that moment, a lady with a gloomy expression rushed down from upstairs. She then went towards the main door.</p><br/><p>Zhu Zhu saw her and hurried forward. \"What's wrong?\"</p><br/><p>The lady's eyes were slightly red as she said angrily, \"He's a b*stard! Once he's at the gambling table, he's inhumane. It was just several tens of thousands at first but then he lost his temper and he started betting more and more. I tried to warn him but he just scolded me...Ming Yang told him not to play so big too but his words were really infuriating. He actually said that if we don't dare to play big, then we shouldn't even play. Now things have gotten crazy upstairs, it's like their playing with their lives now.\"</p><br/><p>When the crowd heard this, they were startled.</p><br/><p>He Cheng Han said angrily, \"What is that Li Hao kid trying to do? It's always like this!\"</p><br/><p>\"This is just a gathering. Who decided to start gambling? Didn't we already say that we wouldn't play?\"</p><br/><p>\"If it's not Li hao, then it's Ming Yang. Ming Yang knows that whenever Li Hao gambles, he becomes like this. He shouldn't have agreed to play.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan blinked several times. This situation was a little unexpected. He said, \"Let's go up and see.\"</p><br/><p>\"Right, let's go.\"</p><br/><p>Then, the whole crowd went upstairs.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

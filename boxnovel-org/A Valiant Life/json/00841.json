They\u2019re just trampling all over the law!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you guys save this video?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve saved it long ago, from start to end. I didn\u2019t even miss a single moment.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHurry up and tag the @InternetPolice! F*ck, I\u2019ve thought that it was shady all along but this is the first time I\u2019ve heard someone talk about something so shady so matter-of-factly. My eyes have been opened. I will never believe that this world is fulll of love anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNothing bad will happen to Master Lin, right? If he gets discovered, he might get chopped to death.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck, should we call the police?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck, things have gotten big.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Everyone watching the live broadcast was dumbfounded. They had never thought that things would turn out like this. But when the opposite party personally admitted it, they realized that this was how things actually were.</p><br/><p>The person-in-charge of the broadcast platform had placed this broadcast on their homepage the whole time. The number of viewers had already reached several million. These were all real viewers. It could be said that most of the real viewers on that platform had been drawn to this broadcast.</p><br/><p>Some of the other popular broadcasters realized that their viewers were decreasing in number and they had no idea what was going on. But when they heard that Master Lin was personally doing a broadcast, they immediately stopped broadcasting and clicked on Master Lin\u2019s broadcast instead.</p><br/><p>Millions of netizens had seen the process of the three men chatting.</p><br/><p>Also, quite a number of reporters were among the viewers. When they witnessed this scene, they felt their breathing quicken. This was really huge news!</p><br/><p>If it was to get exposed, it would cause an unimaginable earthquake.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>In the private room.</p><br/><p>Godfather Qin came back from the toilet. When he saw Lil\u2019 Liu and Master Lin chatting so merrily, he couldn\u2019t help but smile, \u201cLil\u2019 Liu, what are you talking to Master Lin about? You seem so happy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Godfather Liu was already high from drinking. His eyes were squinting in joy.</p><br/><p>\u201cGodfather Qin, I\u2019m telling Brother Lin about this incident. I\u2019m telling him that if Godfather Qin didn\u2019t help me by making use of your connections, I would\u2019ve been executed for hiding so much drugs. That\u2019s why\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>*bam!*</p><br/><p>Before Godfather Liu finished, his head was slapped by Godfather Qin\u2019s palm.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat rubbish are you talking about?\u201d Godfather Qin glared at Lil\u2019 Liu, then looked alertly at Lin Fan. He had felt that something wasn\u2019t quite right from the start.</p><br/><p>But since the beginning, he had not realized what was wrong.</p><br/><p>Now that he heard Lil\u2019 Liu say that, he had a bad premonition.</p><br/><p>Godfather Liu looked at Godfather Qin unhappily. \u201cWhy did you hit me?\u201d</p><br/><p>If it had been anyone else, he would\u2019ve cut the opposite party to death. But this was Godfather Qin. Even if he was upset, he didn\u2019t dare to show it.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust because we\u2019re eating your food and drinking your wine, do you feel very proud of what you\u2019ve done?\u201d Godfather Qin reprimanded him. Then, he looked at Lin Fan. \u201cMaster Lin, my apologies. This kid doesn\u2019t learn from his mistakes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled, \u201cNo problem. I feel that Godfather Liu has a genuine personality. Come, Godfather Liu, let\u2019s give the camera a smile.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, this is good.\u201d Godfather Liu smiled. Then, he put his arm around Lin Fan and smiled brightly. Then, he said in a puzzled tone, \u201cBrother Lin, aren\u2019t we taking a picture? Why are there so many words on the screen?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said indifferently, \u201cOh, it\u2019s nothing. This is just the \u2018bullet screen\u2019. Don\u2019t mind it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Godfather Liu shook his head. His vision was a little blur. As he looked at the words on the screen, he started reading them out loud, \u201cDou\u2026Yu Live Broadcast. What\u2019s that?\u201d</p><br/><p>In the broadcast room.</p><br/><p>\u201c666\u2026is this guy an idiot? He doesn\u2019t even know what\u2019s a live broadcast?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s very normal. How would grown-ups know about what young people play around with?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, I\u2019m dying of laughter. These two guys don\u2019t even know that they are done for. They are still taking group photos with Master Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin is f*cking sinister! He\u2019s f*cking them up so badly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean f*cking them up? This is righteousness. Against such evil, this is how you should treat them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled, \u201cThis is a live broadcast. Let\u2019s see\u2026there are several million watching. Godfather Liu, we\u2019re really popular!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPopular? What do you mean by that?\u201d Godfather Liu was still dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>But when Godfather Qin heard this, he could no longer keep his calm. His eyes instantly changed. Then, he bellowed, \u201cYou\u2019re screwing with us!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan stood up and backed up to the side. \u201cMmm. Godfather Qin is Godfather Qin after all. Actually, I\u2019m not screwing with you. But I just have a habit of broadcasting. That\u2019s why, since I walked into this room, every move and every action by anyone of us has been exposed to the eyes of the masses of netizens.\u201d</p><br/><p>Godfather Liu still looked dumbfounded. Then, he looked at Godfather Qin with a puzzled face. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><br/><p>Godfather Qin immediately stomped Godfather Liu onto the ground. \u201cYou idiot! You still don\u2019t know what has happened. Don\u2019t you know what you\u2019ve said? And now, everyone knows about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, a chill entered Godfather Liu\u2019s body. He suddenly woke up from his daze. He looked at Lin Fan in disbelief. Why would his Brother Lin, who had been drinking and chatting happily with him a moment ago, betray him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Godfather Liu stood up and glared at Lin Fan furiously. He roared, \u201cI\u2019ll kill you!\u201d</p><br/><p>He could guarantee that today, this guy would not step out of this place.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shrugged. \u201cThis is the era of high-technology. Broadcasting is the best way to obtain evidence. But Godfather Qin, even though you\u2019ve been implicated in this, you\u2019ll only be in prison for a few years at most. But if he kills me, you\u2019ll be an accomplice. With your age, you may not leave the prison alive like this. So what happens next depends on you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Godfather Qin looked at Lin Fan with his teeth clenched. There was no way to reverse the situation now. Anyway, more importantly, he didn\u2019t even know what that b*stard Lil\u2019 Liu had said.</p><br/><p>At that moment.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan held his phone and pointed the camera at the two men. \u201cMy righteous fans, you\u2019ve all seen it. If I get killed by them today, you guys have to bear witness.\u201d</p><br/><p>In the broadcast room.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck! Master Lin is in danger!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho\u2019s in the Northeast? Hurry up and go save Master Lin!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck! Hurry up and run! Things have gone out of hand!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat on earth do you want to do?\u201d Godfather Qin said to Lin Fan. He was on the verge of falling apart. He had not expected this kid to have such guts. He had actually used live broadcast to expose the entire situation to the public.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said in a helpless tone, \u201cGodfather Qin, I think you\u2019ve misunderstood. It\u2019s not about what I want right now. It\u2019s about what the relevant departments want. Even if I want to turn things back to the way they were, it\u2019s too late now. I\u2019ve broadcasted it and so many people have seen it. Even if the richest person in the world tried to bribe them, he wouldn\u2019t have enough money. So listen to what I say. Take out your phone and call the police on your own. Then, put your hands behind your head, squat down, and wait for the police to come.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen that time comes, confess honestly. You might get a second chance.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck your mom.\u201d Godfather Liu could not stand it. He became rash and swung the wine bottle towards Lin Fan\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>When the people in the broadcast room saw this, they were on the edges of their seat, fearing for what was about to happen.</p><br/><p>*bam!*</p><br/><p>Lin Fan raised his leg and swung it against Godfather Liu\u2019s side. Godfather Liu slammed against the wall heavily before falling to the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou guys have to testify for me. I\u2019m just doing self-defense. I wasn\u2019t the one to initiate the attack.\u201d</p><br/><p>The netizens in the broadcast room burst into laughter.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck, I just remembered that Master Lin is the Vice-President of the Chinese Martial Arts Association. His strength is overwhelming.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p></div>\n</div>"}

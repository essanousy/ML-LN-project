Judging by the situation, Chinese songs aren\u2019t too appropriate.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang was very troubled. He had seen the situation on the Internet. That Jin Can was full of zest.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t difficult to find an English song composer. But the hard part was getting well-written songs.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know about that.\u201d Wu Huan Yue shook her head. She had not dabbled in this field before.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang was frustrated. \u201cSigh. This brother of mine isn\u2019t good at English. If only his English was a little better. Then, we would have no problems getting him to write a song.\u201d</p><br/><p><em>Knock knock</em></p><br/><p>\u201cCome in.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang and Wu Huan Yue were just discussing this matter.</p><br/><p>After all, this competition could be a huge opportunity for anyone. If Wu Huan Yue could garner fame outside of China, she would be bringing glory to the country. And she could get her name out there too.</p><br/><p>However, the only problem was getting a song.</p><br/><p>\u201cChief Wang, I just contacted a famous singer. He can help to compose a song,\u201d said Yang Qian.</p><br/><p>Yang Qian was Wu Huan Yue\u2019s manager as well as her personal bodyguard. She knew some kungfu too. After all, Wu Huan Yue was a superstar now. She had to have a bodyguard.</p><br/><p>Moreover, Wang Ming Yang definitely had to take good care of Wu Huan Yue. This was his Brother\u2019s lady. If he didn\u2019t protect her, he would end up in misery.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho is it?\u201d asked Wang Ming Yang.</p><br/><p>Yang Qian replied, \u201cThe old-school emperor, Zheng Ya. He has written lots of English songs and he\u2019s very talented. If we hire him, we\u2019ll be set.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang thought for a moment. \u201cHim, eh? I know him. He\u2019s quite an impressive composer. But what conditions does he have?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yang Qian said, \u201cWe don\u2019t know for now. He said he would think about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThink about it? It seems like he\u2019s really interested!\u201d Wang Ming Yang laughed. He had not expected that response. However, he wondered what exactly Zheng Ya would ask for.</p><br/><p><em>Ding ding!</em></p><br/><p>At that moment, Yang Qian\u2019s phone rang. She took a look at the screen. \u201cChief Wang, it\u2019s Zheng Ya.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnswer it then. Let\u2019s see what he\u2019ll ask for,\u201d said Wang Ming Yang.</p><br/><p>Yang Qian answered the call and turned on the loudspeaker.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello. I\u2019ve thought about it. I can write a few songs for Wu Huan Yue. However, I have to request your Chief Wang to help organize a solo concert for me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zheng Ya\u2019s voice could be heard through the phone.</p><br/><p>When this request was stated, Wang Ming Yang\u2019s expression suddenly changed.</p><br/><p>Yang Qian said, \u201cThis request is a bit too much, isn\u2019t it? We\u2019re just asking for a few songs.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha. Actually, I\u2019m just saying. With my current status, a song from me is worth a lot. I\u2019ve been very busy lately. I\u2019ve really been very busy. This is just a tactful way of rejecting your offer. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><br/><p>He hung up.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis guy is a little unbridled.\u201d Wang Ming Yang furrowed his brows. He had not expected such a request.</p><br/><p>Yang Qian was speechless. \u201cThis guy must not have even considered it. He was just playing with us.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cChief Wang, actually, I don\u2019t have to participate,\u201d said Wu Huan Yue.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang shook his head. \u201cThat won\u2019t do. Since there\u2019s such an opportunity, why shouldn\u2019t we give it a shot? Does that guy think he\u2019s the only one who can write a song? He\u2019s way too arrogant.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, on the Internet.</p><br/><p>Zheng Ya posted on Weibo.</p><br/><p>\u201cEastern Han Organization\u2019s Wu Huan Yue\u2019s manager just called me to ask me to write a few songs for Wu Huan Yue. However, I rejected tactfully because I already promised to write songs for Jin Can. After all, to me, Jin Can\u2019s abilities are pretty good. She should give the competition a shot.\u201d</p><br/><p>When this was posted, everyone was instantly stunned.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn. This is awesome. I didn\u2019t expect the bigshot Zheng Ya would get involved and help Jin Can to write songs. That\u2019s really amazing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha. The bigshot rejected the Eastern Han Organization like that. Isn\u2019t he afraid of being suppressed by them?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSuppressed my a*s. Even if the Eastern Han Organization were even more awesome, they wouldn\u2019t be able to do anything.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true. But it looks like Master Lin really isn\u2019t going to write songs for her. Otherwise, they wouldn\u2019t have approached Zheng Ya.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt can\u2019t be helped. Master Lin\u2019s English is just terrible. This is beyond his abilities.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is quite a humiliation. Doesn\u2019t this mean Jin Can is better than Wu Huan Yue?\u201d</p><br/><p>The netizens were discussing intensely over this topic. To them, this Zheng Ya was quite ferocious. However, he had the fame to back it up.</p><br/><p>Eastern Han Organization.</p><br/><p>When Wang Ming Yang saw the Weibo post, his expression changed.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn. What\u2019s that guy\u2019s problem? Is he explicitly going against me?\u201d When Wang Ming Yang saw the post, he was so angry that his face turned red. It was an inexplicable rage.</p><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue sighed. If she had just joined the industry, perhaps she would have been angry. However, looking at it now, it was very normal. There was no need to be angry at all.</p><br/><p>As her manager, Yang Qian was very angry too. There had been no need to post it on Weibo, but Zheng Ya had gone and done it. That wasn\u2019t right.</p><br/><p>Jin Can\u2019s agency.</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha. Elder Zheng played it beautifully. This will p*ss Wang Ming Yang off.\u201d The person-in-charge of the agency was roaring with laughter.</p><br/><p>He felt that this whole thing had been beautifully done. This would definitely draw a lot of hate.</p><br/><p>As Jin Can looked at the Weibo post, she giggled. In the country, she had always been suppressed because of Wu Huan Yue. She had not gotten the recent award because of Wu Huan Yue too.</p><br/><p>She had not gotten a single award.</p><br/><p>Best song, best composer, best performer\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd Not a single award had gone to her. She felt unyielding.</p><br/><p>If Wu Huan Yue hadn\u2019t had Master Lin, she would have nothing. In terms of voice, Jin Can felt that she would not lose to Wu Huan Yue. Why would she?</p><br/><p>All Wu Huan Yue had was Master Lin.</p><br/><p>Right now, everyone in the music industry was envious of Wu Huan Yue. It was all because she had Master Lin behind her to keep writing good songs for her.</p><br/><p>Each of the songs written by him was a classic. It was completely shocking.</p><br/><p>But this time, the tables had turned.</p><br/><p>There was no way Master Lin could write English songs. It was impossible for Wu Huan Yue to take part in the international competition.</p><br/><p>As for getting Zheng Ya to write songs for her, Wu Huan Yue could keep dreaming. After all, the Eastern Han Group had deep connections in other industries, but they only had very shallow connections in the music industry.</p><br/><p>\u201cJin Can, you have to put in your best this time. There are several composers helping you. If you still don\u2019t suppress her, it wouldn\u2019t be right.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jin Can nodded. \u201cI understand. I will work hard.\u201d</p><br/><p>She believed that there would be no problems at all.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

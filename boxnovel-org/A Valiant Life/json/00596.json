Especially when he saw that handsome face of Master Lin\u2019s. The fear in his heart completely dispersed.</p><br/><p>Because he believed that as long as Master Lin was on his side, nothing could go wrong.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian went forward and said in astonishment, \u201cLittle Bro, these legs are as good as crippled.\u201d After saying that, he couldn\u2019t help but go forward and press his legs.</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang and the rest all fixed their gazes on Chang Hai Ge.He was so young but both his legs had been crippled. That\u2019s really pitiful.</p><br/><p>Shen Ming, who had been by his side, begged, \u201cMaster Lin, can you please take a look at Brother Chang and see if he can still be helped?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou guys are putting me in a tough spot,\u201d said Lin Fan as he looked at the two of them, \u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you already not to participate in dangerous activities for seven days? Why didn\u2019t you listen? Tell me, how did this happen?\u201d</p><br/><p>It was hard for Chang Hai Ge to explain as well. Now that he thought about it, he was really unlucky when it happened.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, I had initially stayed away for dangerous activities until the sixth day but because of an accident, I joined a street racing competition. Who would\u2019ve thought that halfway up a mountain, a big tree would fall and smash into my car? I was lucky that it didn\u2019t fall on my torso. It only crushed my legs. Otherwise, I would\u2019ve lost my life.\u201d</p><br/><p>When he said all this, he felt a sense of lingering fear in his heart.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian said, \u201cFrom my point of view, you really are unlucky.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chang Hai Ge replied, \u201cI\u2019m still not considered unlucky. At least it didn\u2019t crush my torso. If it had gone a little higher, my life would\u2019ve been gone.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve seen a situation like yours. His fortune-telling predictions are very accurate. For you to not listen to him, you are pretty amazing,\u201d Fraud Tian shook his head as he said this. He really felt a deep admiration for this guy.</p><br/><p>Chang Hai Ge was filled with embarrassment. He lowered his head and said, \u201cI believe him. It\u2019s just that\u2026it\u2019s just that\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He was really in deep regret. It wasn\u2019t that he hadn\u2019t trusted Master Lin but he had been spurred on by his friends. He had thought that maybe the prediction wouldn\u2019t be so accurate. But he had never expected it to really be so accurate. He only drove his car halfway up the mountain before this happened, causing him to lose his legs.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, can my legs be recovered?\u201d Chang Hai Ge looked at Lin Fan like a beggar. He had no other choice now. If Master Lin was to say that it couldn\u2019t be helped, he would be done for.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at him. \u201cSigh, you really are awesome. You\u2019re the first one not to listen to my advice. Thinking back to the past, a family of three were going for a vacation but after heeding my advice, they avoided a calamity. You\u2019re good for not believing me. Now, something has happened. Are you regretting it yet?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chang Hai Ge nodded, \u201cI\u2019m regretful. I\u2019m really regretting it to death.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can see that you aren\u2019t a good person but neither are you bad. You don\u2019t stick to your words. Initially, I hadn\u2019t planned to save you but the heavens are kind, so I had decided to help you change your fate and help you avoid this disaster. But I never thought that you\u2026sigh, I shan\u2019t say anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chang Hai Ge looked nervously at Lin Fan. \u201cMaster, I really know my mistake now. I will change.\u201d Then, he took out a card from his pocket. \u201cIn here is ten million dollars, please don\u2019t think that it\u2019s too little, Master. This is already all the money I have in cash right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ten million!</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian stared at Chang Hai Ge. He hadn\u2019t expected this guy to have so much money.</p><br/><p>And when he saw the card on the table, Fraud Tian suddenly realized that the bank card\u2019s shine was dazzling.</p><br/><p>Ten million dollars. How long must he painstakingly work in order to earn that much?</p><br/><p>Lin Fan glanced at the bank card. Ten million, it was really not a small amount. This Chang Hai Ge was really rich. However, as a Master, how could Lin Fan be so shallow?</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care if my patient has money when I see the sick. This all depends on my mood. If my mood isn\u2019t good, I won\u2019t treat the patient. Even if he has a mountain of gold and silver, I won\u2019t even blink a single time, so you can take back your card.\u201d Lin Fan shoved the bank card forward.</p><br/><p>Some shop owners had gathered around. When they saw this scene, they gasped in shock.</p><br/><p>\u201cAmazing, Little Boss sees money the same way he sees dirt. We really can\u2019t compare to him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s ten million dollars. How long would we take to earn that much? I don\u2019t even know if we have a chance to earn that much in this lifetime.\u201d</p><br/><p>The shop owners kept on gasping in shock. They really had incomparable admiration for Little Boss.</p><br/><p>This was the Little Boss that they knew.</p><br/><p>How resolute his mind must be.</p><br/><p>If it was someone else, the person would have definitely accepted the ten million dollars straight away.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan looked at Lin Fan and her eyes gleamed with a deep sense of adoration. This was the Brother Lin of her heart. He was simply different from other men.</p><br/><p>To Chang Hai Ge, the fact that Master Lin didn\u2019t accept the money meant that he wasn\u2019t willing to treat him. Then Chang Hai Ge begged, \u201cMaster Lin, I know that this is very little money but that is all I have right now. Please, accept it. I will remember your grace and I will definitely repay it someday.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said calmly, \u201cI don\u2019t see the sick depending on whether they have money. It depends on if they are good people. Tell me, are you a good person?\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, Chang Hai Ge was deep in thought. \u201cAm I a good person?\u201d he thought.</p><br/><p>Besides bullying people occasionally, he hadn\u2019t done anything ridiculous.</p><br/><p>Before Chang Hai Ge opened his mouth, Shen Ming said, \u201cMaster Lin, Brother Chang is a good person. He really is. Although he has some small issues and he occasionally has sex with small celebrities, he doesn\u2019t have a bad heart.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at Chang Hai Ge and frowned. \u201cHey, judging by your physiognomy, it seems that you aren\u2019t quite trustworthy. In the past, you\u2019ve promised people things but forgot about them. That\u2019s not quite right. The kind of people I hate the most is people who go back on their words.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chang Hai Ge was dumbfounded. Go back on their words?</p><br/><p>When had he ever gone back on his word?</p><br/><p>At that moment, he couldn\u2019t recall.</p><br/><p>Shen Ming was thinking as well. Brother Chang was quite a trustworthy person and he usually wouldn\u2019t go back on his words. But Master Lin said that about Brother Chang. What was that based on?</p><br/><p>No\u2026wait a moment!</p><br/><p>At that moment, Shen Ming seemed to have remembered something. Then, he lowered his head and whispered into Brother Chang\u2019s ear.</p><br/><p>When Chang Hai Ge heard it, his expression changed as if he had figured it out.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cFigured it out yet?</p><br/><p>Chang Hai Ge was a little embarrassed as he nodded, \u201cI\u2019ve figured it out.\u201d Then, he said, \u201cMaster Lin, don\u2019t worry. I will definitely change this bad habit of mine. I definitely won\u2019t do it again.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian had been thinking about the ten million dollars the whole time. Then, he said, \u201cI think you should just help him out. He\u2019s so young and something like this has already happened. It is really quite pitiful.\u201d</p><br/><p>The surrounding shop owners said as well, \u201cYeah, Master Lin, this kid looks refined and gentle. He seems pretty good. If he were to become crippled, it would be pitiful.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKid, you should know your mistakes and change. Don\u2019t be an untrustworthy person anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOur Little Boss isn\u2019t the type of person to watch someone suffer and not do anything. As long as you change, there won\u2019t be a problem.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan came to Chang Hai Ge\u2019s front and patted him on the shoulder. \u201cAs long as you know your mistake and change, it\u2019s fine. Your leg won\u2019t be a problem.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, Chang Hai Ge was close to tears. He had finally heard the news that he had been waiting for.</p></div>\n</div>"}

This is really too good.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI never thought that we would have a show with a rating past 4.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, \u2018Strongest Heavenly Voice\u2019 has broken past 4. It has pulled apart from \u2018Where has mommy gone?\u2019.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is just the third episode. Each episode better than the last. Director, your foresight is really too sinister. Getting Master Lin to be a mentor was indeed the wisest decision.\u201d</p><br/><p>The deputy director did not forget to lick the director\u2019s boots. However, he was really very happy. Shanghai TV had been oppressed for so long. Now that it had turned over, if he said he wasn\u2019t excited, he would have been lying.</p><br/><p>Director Liu was in a pretty good mood too. \u201cYou guys may not know this but Hunan TV gave me a call today. Although they didn\u2019t say much, they sounded very bitter.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn the past, Hunan TV was always number one. Now that we\u2019ve overtaken them, my mood is terrific. However, Master Lin has completely blown up in popularity. I wonder how many television stations will be inviting him onto their shows. After all, having him on a show means that they will get good ratings.\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Liu cleared his throat. \u201cAlright. What matters is we good on our part. We have to do our best and make a good first season.\u201d</p><br/><p>The staff members were all filled with confidence and hope for the future.</p><br/><p>On the Internet.</p><br/><p>\u2018Shanghai TV takes the glorious first place in ratings.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Contestant loses out on a big opportunity for a small gain. She is filled with regret.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Master Lin possesses an intense individuality that cannot be reproduced.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Zhao Li flames a contestant on the show but is ridiculed by Master Lin.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The headlines of these articles were each more overbearing than the last.</p><br/><p>When Zhao Li saw these articles, she wanted to kill herself. She had never expected things to turn out like this. Back then, she had been in a bad mood and had been unable to control her emotions.</p><br/><p>Now, she had been represented badly on the Internet. She felt extremely unlucky.</p><br/><p>In the end, she blamed all of this on Lin Fan. If it had not been for him, this would definitely not have happened.</p><br/><p>Ever since the \u2018Strongest Heavenly Voice\u2019 had started showing, the masses of netizens felt that they had gained greater joy in their lives. Every day, regardless of whether anything had happened, they would look through the Internet in anticipation of more news.</p><br/><p>\u201cI strongly recommend \u2018Strongest Heavenly voice. You will definitely not regret watching it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis show has broadened my horizons. Master Lin is simply incredible. Whenever he gets an opportunity, he would start flaming someone.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYing Jin has been flamed. Zhao Li has been flamed. Liu Ying Dong has been flamed so much that he doesn\u2019t dare to speak anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThese are all big shots. I feel like Master Lin is the only one who would dare to do this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that obvious? Who else would dare to do something like this?\u201d</p><br/><p>According to Shanghai TV\u2019s calculations, discussions regarding Master Lin had reached a level of 89%. This was enough to prove that this was a one-man show.</p><br/><p>Moreover, it was because of this one-man show that the ratings of \u2018Strongest Heavenly Voice\u201d had blown up and crushed everything else. Even Hunan TV was not a worthy competitor.</p><br/><p>If they had not seen this for themselves, they would never have dared to believe it.</p><br/><p>Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang called.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother, what\u2019s the current situation?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you watch the show? I\u2019ve already found two good, young talents for you. They are very reliable.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s not what I\u2019m talking about. It\u2019s good that you\u2019ve found young talents for me but you can\u2019t just take choose two contestants. At the end of the show, you\u2019ll need to rely on them to take the first prize. If you have so little people, it will be very hard to take the first prize.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. It doesn\u2019t matter whether I become the champion or not. I\u2019m on this show just to play around.</p><br/><p>The two of them casually chatted for a while more before hanging up.</p><br/><p>Although \u2018Strongest Heavenly Voice\u2019 was quite meaningful, it was quite tiring to keep participating in it.</p><br/><p>In a certain town.</p><br/><p>Yang Jie was very displeased. He realized that he had been ignored.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have reached my number. I am currently unable to answer.\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking at the phone number, a malevolent expression appeared on Yang Jie\u2019s face. He had not expected Ying Jin not to answer his call. Did she really think that he wouldn\u2019t dare to expose the truth to the reporters?</p><br/><p>To someone who had nothing at all and had nowhere to go, there was nothing that he would not do.</p><br/><p>So what if Ying Jin\u2019s background and identity were impressive?</p><br/><p>He had reached a point where he had nowhere else to go. There was no point in thinking too much.</p><br/><p>He found a phone number on the Internet.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello, is this Shanghai Entertainment\u2019s reporter?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. You are\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have proof of Ying Jin\u2019s corruption when she acted as a judge two years ago.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs this true?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, because I am that contestant who was involved back then. However, I want\u2026 I want one million dollars.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yang Jie sniffled. He was a drug addict. However, he had no money at the moment. He didn\u2019t think too much, he just wanted to sell this evidence for a sum of money so he could take drugs to his heart\u2019s content.</p><br/><p>\u201cOne million is too much. How about a hundred thousand?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. Do you think I\u2019m a beggar?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThree hundred thousand, nothing more. If you don\u2019t want it, then forget it. You have to know that this is news from two years ago. Even if it is exposed now, it won\u2019t create much of an impact.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yang Jie wanted to refuse. However, that tormenting drug addiction was causing him to crumble.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, alright, I\u2019ll take it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>In a certain luxurious hotel in Shanghai.</p><br/><p>\u201cSister Ying, that guy from two years ago looked for you?\u201d Zhao Li was sitting on the sofa. She was in a gloomy mood. Her heart was heavy. She had no idea how things had changed so much for her since she had arrived in Shanghai.</p><br/><p>And Sister Ying was supposed to leave Shanghai. However, because of this incident, she stayed.</p><br/><p>Ying Jin smoked a cigarette. \u201cMmm, he contacted me. He\u2019s really scum. He asked for twenty thousand for him to keep his mouth shut.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Li was taken aback and she looked furious. \u201cHe actually said that?\u201d But then, she said worriedly, \u201cSister Ying, what would happen if he tells the reporters?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ying Jin was blinded by self-confidence. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, as long as he isn\u2019t stupid, he should know what to do. Back then, he was able to pay five million, which means he doesn\u2019t lack money. But if he dares to oppose me, I\u2019ll make sure he loses everything.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Li heaved a sigh of relief. She believed in Sister Ying because Sister Ying was that capable.</p><br/><p>She felt that as long as that person wasn\u2019t dumb, he would not do such a thing.</p><br/><p>Of course, they had no idea that Yang Jie really had nothing left. He had even become addicted to drugs. When he went crazy like this, he wouldn\u2019t think that much.</p><br/><p>After contacting Shanghai TV\u2019s reporter, Yang Jie contacted several other news agencies.</p><br/><p>There was no way he was only going to sell this important piece of news to only one news agency. He had to sell it to several agencies and earn even more money.</p><br/><p>Three hundred thousand.</p><br/><p>Two hundred thousand.</p><br/><p>A hundred thousand.</p><br/><p>In the end, he even sold it for fifty thousand.</p><br/><p>If Ying Jin and Lin Fan found out about this, they would definitely vomit blood.</p><br/><p>One cannot be so shameless but also must have a certain standard.</p><br/><p>Several days passed.</p><br/><p>Ratings for \u2018Strongest Heavenly Voice\u201d stayed at around 4.85%. It couldn\u2019t get much higher and at times, it fell back down to around 4.352%.</p><br/><p>However, the people of Shanghai TV were already content. They were exceptionally pleased.</p><br/><p>This was the peak results that they had never achieved before.</p><br/><p>In these few episodes, Zhao Li had been flamed by Lin Fan so much that she was falling apart. However, as a mentor, she had to endure it. She could only go home and smash things up in a frenzy in order to console herself.</p><br/><p>In the morning of this day.</p><br/><p>Something major happened.</p><br/><p>Everyone who was watching the news stared at it with their mouths gaping.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, when Ying Jin saw the news, she was so frightened that her face turned pale.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p></div>\n</div>"}

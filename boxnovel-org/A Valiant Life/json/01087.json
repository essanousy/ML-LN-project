His eyes were burning with fury.</p><br/><p>The employees were trembling as they didn\u2019t dare to look at the leader. This time, they were f*cked.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t expect this either,\u201d said one of the employees softly. They couldn\u2019t be blamed. If anything, their good luck should be blamed for making them select the good products for testing.</p><br/><p>But it didn\u2019t seem possible. There had never been problems in the past. How could there be a problem this time?</p><br/><p>Was there a problem in the working process or was there corruption in one of the departments that had led to this change?</p><br/><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t expect it? Why didn\u2019t you expect it?\u201d the leader bellowed furiously. He wanted to just swallow these guys whole.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, he realized that they were simply digging their own grave.</p><br/><p><em>No, I have to salvage the situation. Otherwise, it will really be too late.</em></p><br/><p>Without caring about the employees, he immediately made a call to Master Lin.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was just using his phone and about to post the test results onto the Internet when his phone rang. He helplessly answered the call.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello, who is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>The person on the other end of the call sounded very gentle as if he knew he had done something wrong. \u201cMaster Lin, hello. I\u2019m Ma Guo Fu from Tianshu Milk Company. This whole incident was because of us. It was our negligence. Could you just forget about it? I\u2019ll immediately send people to retrieve the goods. Do you think that\u2019s fine?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan instantly started laughing upon hearing that. \u201cI think that\u2019s a very difficult thing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ma Guo Fu was powerless now. But no matter what, he had to stay calm. He couldn\u2019t let the situation collapse. \u201cMaster Lin, give us a chance. This mistake was unexpected. Do you think this is okay? We know that you\u2019ve been criticized on the Internet lately. We\u2019re willing to compensate you for that. We just hope that Master Lin will be merciful and let this matter slip.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you think it\u2019d be okay if we settle this matter ourselves?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Lin Fan directly rejected.</p><br/><p>Ma Guo Fu was taken aback. \u201cMaster Lin, you\u2019re a public figure and we\u2019re a large corporation. We\u2019ll likely interact with each other again in the future. There\u2019s no need to be like this, is there?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is. There really is a need. Also, I\u2019m not a public figure. I\u2019m just a shop owner. I just know more people than the average person,\u201d said Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Ma Guo Fu didn\u2019t know what to say anymore. But right now, his fate was in Master Lin\u2019s hands. He couldn\u2019t possibly refute.</p><br/><p>\u201cTell us. What do you want to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan pondered for a moment. \u201cI don\u2019t want to do anything. I have to be responsible for the masses. I have to publicize the test results. Oh right, I can\u2019t talk to you anymore. I feel that talking to you is just a waste of time. Who knows how many people have drunk your milk during this time that we\u2019ve been talking? I\u2019m hanging up.\u201d</p><br/><p>*Clatter!*</p><br/><p>Ma Guo Fu heard the beeping sound from the phone. At that moment, he just stood there stupidly.</p><br/><p>The Quality Inspection Head Office had just released the test results and they also included a deep reflection.</p><br/><p>When the netizens saw this, they were completely stunned as if they had seen a ghost.</p><br/><p>The Quality Inspection Head Office\u2019s leader was looking at the situation on the Internet as well. When he saw Master Lin post the test results shortly after them, he heaved a sigh of relief. He thought that it was just as they had thought. Master Lin had indeed been waiting for them.</p><br/><p>Touched. Grateful.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t even know how to thank Master Lin. Master Lin was completely taking care of them.</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan saw the situation on the Internet, he was startled. It was really fast. He hadn\u2019t expected the Quality Inspection Head Office to release the test results so quickly.</p><br/><p>Netizens.</p><br/><p>Initially, they had been discussing this matter on the Internet. After all, this was a very severe matter. Moreover, there hadn\u2019t been any evidence at all and they had no idea who to believe.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn! Hurry up and take a look at the Quality Inspection Head Office\u2019s Weibo. They\u2019ve released the test results!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin has posted it too. They\u2019ve done it one after the other.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn! It can\u2019t be. There really is a problem with Tianshu Milk. I\u2019ve drunk it for a few days.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSh*t. I suggest that you go to the hospital to clean your intestines quickly. Otherwise, you\u2019ll get cancer.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck off. Who are you trying to scare? My intestines have terrible absorption. It\u2019ll be excreted soon. I won\u2019t absorb the toxins.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c666\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>When Ma Guo Fu saw the Quality Inspection Head Office\u2019s public statement, he was stunned. Right now, he only had one thought in his mind. They were really in deep trouble. Moreover, they were probably beyond hope.</p><br/><p>And when he saw Master Lin\u2019s Weibo post, it was as if a ball of fire was about to burst out of his heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck your mom\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He was really enraged. If it hadn\u2019t been for this Master Lin, things wouldn\u2019t have turned out this way.</p><br/><p>Wang Mei Tian was at home, drinking some milk. At the same time, she scrolled through Weibo. She was filled with confidence for her future. Tianshu Milk wanted her to be their brand ambassador. And when she looked at her Weibo comments, they were all supporting her.</p><br/><p>This made her feel as if she was about to reach the pinnacle of life.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, what\u2019s this?\u201d At that moment, Wang Mei Tian saw a Weibo post that was being reposted maniacally.</p><br/><p>\u201cTest results reveal that Tianshu Milk contains a 200% excess of aflatoxins. The evidence is clear. The Quality Inspection Head Office has apologized publicly.\u201d</p><br/><p>*Pfft!*</p><br/><p>She had just taken a mouthful of milk but before she swallowed it, she spat it all out. Her snow-white face turned green.</p><br/><p>\u201cAn excess of carcinogens?\u201d Wang Mei Tian looked at the delicious bottle of milk in her hand and was completely dumbfounded. Then, as if she had seen a ghost, she threw the bottle into the dustbin.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow is this possible? How did things turn out this way? It can\u2019t be!\u201d</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t dare to believe what had happened. How could there have been an excess of carcinogens? There must have been a mistake.</p><br/><p>But when she saw the Weibo comments, she was completely dazed.</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha. Do you feel good, Wang Mei Tian? Do you feel happy drinking that toxic milk?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck. You f*cking donated ten thousand boxes to the mountainous areas. Are you trying to poison all those children? You monster.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin already said that it was toxic but you were so f*cking stubborn. Why are you just so stubborn?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re screwed. When this incident started, you tried so hard to suck up to Tianshu Milk Company, causing people to trust Tianshu Milk. Now that the truth is out, what will you do?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd you want us to support your album? Keep dreaming.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn. I actually didn\u2019t trust Master Lin. I regret it so much.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, Wang Mei Tian looked at the situation on Weibo and was completely stupefied.</p></div>\n</div>"}

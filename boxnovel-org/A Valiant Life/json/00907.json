It was clear that he had decided to oblige to Lin Fan\u2019s requests.</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t afford to infuriate Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Elder Liang had been eating his melon seeds and watching the show. He only left to receive his customers when they went to his shop. After that, he immediately ran back over with even more melon seeds.</p><br/><p>The most important thing was that he wanted to see the purpose of this fella\u2019s visit.</p><br/><p>He Jun was really upset with Elder Liang for treating him like a monkey in a circus. However, since Master Lin was there, he couldn\u2019t say anything about it.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-2\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>He was raging. He wondered why people were such busybodies these days. Furthermore, Master Lin didn\u2019t give him any face at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow are you doing now?\u201d Lin Fan asked after looking at the time.</p><br/><p>He Jun had to realign his thoughts and emotions. His bosses had already ordered him to resolve the issue. He had to complete the task.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m good now, I\u2019m good now,\u201d He Jun said anxiously. He wanted to leave as soon as he completed the task.</p><br/><p>It was humiliating. Really humiliating.</p><br/><p>He was an elderly man and he was rather powerful but he had been reprimanded by a youngster. Furthermore, he didn\u2019t have any rights to say anything. How was that possible?</p><br/><p>However, Master Lin was indeed extraordinarily powerful. He had an extensive network of friends and he was influential. It wasn\u2019t easy to mess with him.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, it would also create negative consequences.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-3\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cAlright, tell me. What do you want?\u201d Lin Fan asked.</p><br/><p>He Jun sighed helplessly. He had already told Lin Fan everything. How could Lin Fan still be clueless? In the end, he just decided to repeat what he had said earlier.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, it\u2019s an error on our part. We have decided to invite Zhao Ming Qing to be reinstated as the Director of Shanghai\u2019s First Chinese Medical Academy. I hope Master Lin won\u2019t be unsatisfied with the Health Department for this matter,\u201d He Jun said.</p><br/><p>Elder Liang understood everything after hearing that.</p><br/><p>He had been wondering where this fella came from. Now that he found out about his identity, he knew what was going on.</p><br/><p>Master Lin\u2019s disciple had been messed up by these fellas and they actually came to repent.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t make any decisions regarding the matter you just spoke about. Furthermore, you should be speaking to my disciple instead. If my disciple forgives you, it would be true forgiveness. Why are you here?\u201d Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>He Jun finally realized that Master Lin wasn\u2019t easily appeased. He wanted to go forward to add on to what he had said but he got stopped by Master Lin.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t come near me. Just stand at the entrance and talk,\u201d Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>With that, Lin Fan didn\u2019t give him any face at all.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-4\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>He Jun was trying his best to tolerate everything that Lin Fan was doing.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, Zhao Ming Qing is your disciple. As his mentor, you can make a decision for him. Could you help us ask him? We are really sincere. I think Zhao Ming Qing would definitely be more than happy to accept it.\u201d</p><br/><p>If not for his bosses, He Jun swore that he would flame anyone that treated him like this.</p><br/><p>However, he had to tolerate everything now. If not, things weren\u2019t going to be resolved.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled and took out his phone. \u201cLet me ask then.\u201d</p><br/><p>He believed that his disciple had dignity and would reject the offer.</p><br/><p>The phone call got through.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan didn\u2019t switch on the loudspeaker mode as he was afraid of his disciple agreeing to take up the offer.</p><br/><p>\u201cMing Qing, let me ask you something. The people from the Health Department are here and they asked me if you would be willing to be the Director of Shanghai\u2019s First Chinese Medical Academy again. Are you willing to do so?\u201d Lin Fan asked.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing was stunned after hearing that.</p><br/><p>He really couldn\u2019t bear to leave the medical academy and he had sworn that even if he were to die, he wanted to die in the school.</p><br/><p>During this period of time, he had always felt that something was amiss at home.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-5\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>After hearing that, Zhao Ming Qing immediately answered, \u201cTeacher, I am willing\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>D*mn it!</p><br/><p>That sentence was very impactful to Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>His disciple was really unreserved about it.</p><br/><p>However, Lin Fan could understand why. He had worked so hard for his entire life. If he really wanted to retire, he would have retired a long time ago.</p><br/><p>He Jun looked at Lin Fan. He didn\u2019t know what was being conveyed over the phone.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, just wait for my notification.\u201d Lin Fan hung up the phone calmly. Then, he turned to He Jun. \u201cMing Qing said that he will leave this matter to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, alright.\u201d He Jun immediately nodded.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan really didn\u2019t want Ming Qing to go for it but he had to consider his disciple\u2019s needs. Perhaps it would be more tiring for him to go back to the medical academy. However, if he were to stay at home all the time, he might develop some illness from idling.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince that\u2019s the case, I will make a request. When you return, make an official invitation and repent for what all of you have done. Are you able to do that?\u201d Lin Fan asked.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-6\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Of course, that scenario would typically be impossible. However, He Jun had to ensure that it was possible.</p><br/><p>He Jun immediately replied, \u201cOf course. Definitely.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded. \u201cAlright, leave then. I\u2019ll wait for the official announcement. However, stop involving me in this. Stop looking for me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSure, sure.\u201d He Jun heaved a sigh of relief. He had finally managed to resolve this.</p><br/><p>Although he was infuriated, he felt that it had been worth it since the matter was resolved.</p><br/><p>As for Master Lin, he swore to never interact with him again.</p><br/><p>\u201cLeave now. I have a bad mood whenever I see you.\u201d Lin Fan waved his hand and He Jun smiled before leaving.</p><br/><p>In a random corner.</p><br/><p>He Jun was extremely unhappy and he was cursing in his heart.</p><br/><p>The next day!</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-7\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>The official announcement from the Health Department was released.</p><br/><p>\u201cWith regards to Zhao Ming Qing\u2019s appointment, we have looked into the problem and we would like to sincerely apologize to Zhao Ming Qing. At the same time, we would like to invite him to continue being the Director of Shanghai\u2019s First Chinese Medical Academy. We have realized our mistake after Master Lin\u2019s suggestion and we hope the public continues to monitor us and remind us of it.\u201d</p><br/><p>When the announcement was made, a lot of people were stunned.</p><br/><p>They felt that it was illogical.</p><br/><p>They actually realized their mistakes?</p><br/><p>Did the sun just rise from the west?</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan saw the announcement, he tagged the official account and replied to it. \u2018It\u2019s good that you know your mistakes. Do not make such stupid decisions in the future. It has ruined your entire image.\u201d</p><br/><p>The official Weibo page of the Health Department specially replied to Lin Fan\u2019s message with a few smiley faces which were nodding in agreement.</p><br/><p>The netizens and reporters were all stunned.</p><br/><p>Did something happen to the department?</p><br/><p>Lin Fan felt that they were really shameless for still acting cute.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

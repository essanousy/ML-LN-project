He told you to come here.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Yun Xue Yao saw this situation, she knew that a problem was about to break out. However, this Ma Shao Hao was a little deranged.</p><br/><p>If a conflict were to break out between Brother Lin and Ma Shao Hao, she was worried that Ma Shao Hao would cause trouble for Brother Lin.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Lin, I\u2026\u201d Just as Yun Xue Yao started to speak, Jin Meng pulled her back. Yun Xue Yao turned around and saw Jin Meng shaking her head at her. Then, she didn\u2019t say more.</p><br/><p>Jin Meng whispered to her, \u201cXue Yao, don\u2019t say anything. This matter is between those guys now. If you speak now, you would be humiliating Brother Lin. Just watch from the side. You have to have faith in the man you like. If you interfere, you would be disrespecting him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d Yun Xue Yao nodded and didn\u2019t say more.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Ma Shao Hao didn\u2019t believe that this Master Lin could do anything to him.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan gestured with his hand. He said calmly, \u201cCome here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ma Shao Hao was extremely displeased. He had set his eyes on Yun Xue Yao long ago but now, someone had stolen her from him. This made him furious.</p><br/><p>Then, after pondering for a moment, Ma Shao Hao stepped forward and stood in front of Lin Fan. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p><br/><p>*Bam!*</p><br/><p>Lin Fan immediately threw a slap that dropped Ma Shao Hao to the ground. Then, he raised his hand and said with a cold voice, \u201cScram.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ma Shao Hao, who had fallen to the ground, had a dumbfounded look on his face. He had not expected this to happen at all and there was an indescribable rage in his heart. He had not thought that this guy would dare to hit him.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou dare to hit me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan sat down and ignored him. \u201cEveryone, let\u2019s carry on eating.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian started grabbing the food and munching on it. \u201cWhat an idiot.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang laughed. \u201cFraud, that\u2019s a very appropriate word to describe him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan and Liu Xu weren\u2019t bothered by this. They understood Brother Lin very well and they knew that this was nothing much to Brother Lin. As for that Ma Shao Hao, they just treated him as a passing guest.</p><br/><p>However, Jin Meng and Yun Xue Yao both felt that things had gotten complicated.</p><br/><p>They understood Ma Shao Hao and they knew that he wouldn\u2019t just let this matter end like this.</p><br/><p>When Ma Shao Hao saw that Lin Fan was eating casually after hitting him in the face, his heart was filled with immense rage.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m talking to you. Are you f*cking deaf?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan ignored him and carried on chatting with Wu You Lan and the rest.</p><br/><p>At that moment, the restaurant manager came over. \u201cMister, please don\u2019t cause a racket here.\u201d</p><br/><p>*Bam!*</p><br/><p>Upon saying that, the manager was slapped in the face.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re f*cking blind. Don\u2019t you know who I am? You actually dared to talk to me like that. Scram!\u201d Ma Shao Hao barked.</p><br/><p>The restaurant manager was taken aback and he was angry as well. Everyone who came to this restaurant had some sort of status. Now that a young man had slapped him, he could not take it.</p><br/><p>But just as he was about to retaliate, one of the staff members rushed over and pulled the manager to the side.</p><br/><p>The manager yelled with a red face, \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>The staff member said, \u201cManager, have you gone mad? That man is Ma Shao Hao!\u201d</p><br/><p>The manager was shocked. \u201cYou mean Ma Shao Hao of the Ma Family?\u201d</p><br/><p>The staff member nodded. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s him. I regularly take the night shift and I frequently see him. I\u2019m definitely not mistaken.\u201d</p><br/><p>The manager was silent for a moment as if he was thinking about something. Then, he said, \u201cJust now, it seemed like that Ma Shao Hao had been hit by someone. If we go and help him to gain his favor, do you think\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cManager, don\u2019t even think about it. It\u2019s true that that is Ma Shao Hao, but do you know who that lady sitting over there is? That\u2019s Yun Xue Yao. That place we went to gamble last time is owned by her family.\u201d</p><br/><p>When the manager heard the staff member\u2019s words, his heart froze. He felt a sense of terror as he had never expected two big shots to be here.</p><br/><p>If he had really gone in to help Ma Shao Hao, things would have ended up terribly. No matter which side he helped, he would be offending the other side.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, you\u2019ve done very well. From now on, I guarantee that no one will bully you in the restaurant.\u201d The manager heaved a sigh of relief. He was immensely grateful to the employee. If it hadn\u2019t been for the employee, he would\u2019ve been in big trouble.</p><br/><p>The employee was delighted. \u201cThank you, Manager.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although he was knowledgeable, he could never hope to establish relationships with those big shots. Having his manager protect him was the best thing that he could achieve.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Ma Shao Hao stood there. His face had turned greenish-pale.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you hear me? How can you dare to hit me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan carried on eating. He already didn\u2019t care about this guy anymore. He felt that it was a waste of time. Then, he turned to Ma Shao Hao and said, \u201cIf you dare to say another word of nonsense, I\u2019ll teach you a good lesson.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to the toilet.\u201d Fraud Tian stood up, indifferent to the current situation as well.</p><br/><p>But when Ma Shao Hao saw this old man walking over, he had a fury in his heart that he wanted to unleash on the old man.</p><br/><p>As Fraud Tian passed Ma Shao Hao, a palm was swung towards Fraud Tian\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve done it now, kid.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian immediately reacted and grabbed Ma Shao Hao with both hands before executing a shoulder throw.</p><br/><p>*Thud!*</p><br/><p>With a loud slam, Ma Shao Hao crashed onto the ground. He was confused as his body felt like a broken shelf.</p><br/><p>\u201cAH!\u201d</p><br/><p>An ear-piercing scream rang out. Ma Shao Hao hadn\u2019t expected this old man to be so powerful.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat the heck? You tried to hit someone without even understanding the situation first. Do you really want to die?\u201d Fraud Tian dusted off his hands, then walked over Ma Shao Hao\u2019s body. He had not attacked someone in a long time but someone actually came to attack him.</p><br/><p><em>Did this guy think I could be bullied easily?</em></p><br/><p>Jin Meng\u2019s eyes widened. She had not expected this old man to be so powerful either. Then, she looked at Ma Shao Hao, who was wailing in pain.</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung Master Ma, I think you should leave quickly. There\u2019s nothing for you to do here. Don\u2019t find trouble for yourself.\u201d</p><br/><p>She knew that Ma Shao Hao definitely wouldn\u2019t benefit from staying here any longer.</p><br/><p>His brain had really short-circuited. He had caused trouble for himself out of nothing.</p><br/><p>Didn\u2019t he know who was here? This was Master Lin. Did he think that Master Lin could be defeated so easily?</p><br/><p>Moreover, it didn\u2019t seem that the people with Master Lin were easy to defeat either. He would just be causing more pain for himself by staying here.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust you wait,\u201d Ma Shao Hao stood up and threatened them before leaving hurriedly.</p><br/><p>He had not thought that he would be hit by someone. This was something he had not even dared to imagine.</p></div>\n</div>"}

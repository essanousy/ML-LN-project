Their two hostel mates avoided them as if they didn't want anything to do with them. Otherwise, they might run into bad luck.</p><br/><p>It was actually a common occurrence but their case was a special one and it was rare. </p><br/><p>One of the hostel mates laughed sarcastically at them, \"The class chairman just came and the fact that the two of you have created false rumors has affected the school. Therefore, you must move out by today.\"</p><br/><p>Xia Yi Mo turned to her, \"What do you mean?\" </p><br/><p>\"It's the class chairman's idea, not ours. If you have a problem with that, you can go look for him.\"</p><br/><p>Then, these two students avoided them like a plague. They took their bags and left. As they reached the entrance, they said in disbelief, \"To be spread by an Internet celebrity? They must be dreaming. Perhaps they don't know that the Internet celebrities on Weibo are forbidden from posting such things.\" </p><br/><p>Huang Miao Miao remained silent. This issue was destined to end this way. It had been a few days since it happened but she didn't have any evidence. Even the reporters didn't care about this because what Jiang Li and Chen Juan could do with their capabilities was unimaginable.</p><br/><p>Xia Mo Yi looked at her phone and exclaimed, \"Miao Miao, look. There's an Internet celebrity that posted!\"</p><br/><p>Huang Miao Miao looked at the phone and started to tear up. She had been waiting for this for the past few days. It was as if years had passed. She felt like she had been under all the pressure in the world.</p><br/><p>... </p><br/><p>Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan gave Lin Fan a thumbs up and said, \"Master Lin, you're too awesome. We should help them in situations like this.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled, \"I did what I could.\" </p><br/><p>A simple post could be a form of immense motivation for some people.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan's Weibo had at least a million followers and these fans were all active ones. There weren't any ghost accounts. Therefore, a simple post made by him could have a great impact.</p><br/><p>\"Two old and inhumane beasts, indeed.\"</p><br/><p>That was the caption for the cropped picture. Then, he casually mentioned Jiang Li and Chen Juan by '@-ing' their profiles.</p><br/><p>When the post was uploaded, online discussions went wild.</p><br/><p>\"Hey, where did Master Lin get this news from? It's so infuriating.\"</p><br/><p>\"After reading the content, I feel like Master Lin was right. They are indeed old and inhumane beasts.\"</p><br/><p>\"Let's help to repost it.\"</p><br/><p>As long as one was popular on Weibo, he could start intense discussions about anything they post.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was extremely cautious when he was posting about it. He specially read the fortunes of these two accused men. In regards to the violation accusal, the accuser was more credible.</p><br/><p>Jiang Li was well connected on some of the small e-platforms online. At the same time, he had a nickname, Big Three Jiang'.</p><br/><p>'Lots of money, connections and female students.'</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>Things were starting to explode on Weibo.</p><br/><p>Some of the Internet celebrities were stunned when they read this piece of news. They were told to not repost false news, otherwise, their Weibo accounts might get banned.</p><br/><p>To these Internet celebrities, they weren't going to risk their accounts for this. After all, it wasn't easy for them to accumulate their followers and gain their popularity. Furthermore, they were getting up to $200,000 monthly for their advertising fees. If they were to get banned because of this, they'd be crying over their loss.</p><br/><p>But now that they've seen an Internet celebrity posting about it, they were impressed by his bravery.</p><br/><p>Night time, at a banquet.</p><br/><p>Jiang Li and Chen Juan were eating with a bunch of people. It was crowded and joyous. Then, Jiang Li looked at Weibo and his face suddenly changed.</p><br/><p>Chen Juan asked curiously, \"What's wrong?\"</p><br/><p>Jiang Li passed the phone to Chen Juan and said, \"Look at it yourself.\"</p><br/><p>When Chen Juan read the news, her face changed as well. She didn't expect an Internet celebrity to post about it. Furthermore, the discussion below had increased to over a hundred thousand comments. The issue had been blown up.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan's Weibo couldn't have generated such a great impact alone. However, after countless fans have reposted it, more people started to discuss it more intensely. It even had the potential to reach the top searched list.</p><br/><p>Jiang Li couldn't tolerate it and he replied to the post.</p><br/><p>\"You're posting a piece of false news. It's damaging to Professor Chen Juan's and my reputation. I will sue you.\"</p><br/><p>When the reply was posted, the comments section went wild again.</p><br/><p>\"Wow, he actually dared to challenge Master Lin. Be careful, Master Lin will definitely teach you an unforgettable lesson.\" </p><br/><p>\"How disgusting. If Master Lin didn't post about this, I wouldn't have known that the world had such inhumane people like the two of you.\"</p><br/><p>\"I am unconditionally supportive of Master Lin.\"</p><br/><p>... </p><br/><p>In Shanghai.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was eating supper with Wang Ming Yang. They hadn't met in a long time. Wang Ming Yang had asked Lin Fan out for a simple gathering.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang asked curiously, \"What's so nice to read on your phone?\" </p><br/><p>Lin Fan didn't even look up, \"Nothing much. I posted about a piece of news today and the culprits have found me and they want to sue me. I'm writing a reply to them now.\"</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang took the phone from him, \"Why do you even bother with them? Let them sue you then. I'll reply for you. Let's continue drinking.\" </p><br/><p>Lin Fan just smiled and didn't say much. Wang Ming Yang didn't bring his girlfriend and even prepared a chauffeur. It was implied that he wouldn't return home unless he got drunk.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang took the phone and tapped away on the screen. Then, he closed the Weibo app and returned the phone to Lin Fan. </p><br/><p>\"Some things don't deserve your attention. Let's continue drinking.\"</p><br/><p>They lost track of how much they drank, but it was until they started to vomit.</p><br/><p>In the car.</p><br/><p>The drunk Wang Ming Yang held onto Lin Fan's shoulder and said, \"Bro, I want to get married. Which day is good?\" </p><br/><p>Lin Fan had also lost it. He didn't know what he was doing anymore. \"Getting married my a*s. Wait until I get married before you do so.\"</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang laughed and waved his hands, \"Sure, you can get married first but you don't even have a girlfriend. How long do I have to wait?\" </p><br/><p>Lin Fan felt extremely dizzy and he mumbled, \"Soon, soon\u2026 I'll take a rest first. Please wake me up when I'm at my house.\"</p><br/><p>In his daze, he felt like someone was helping him up the stairs and he even heard the drunk Wang Ming Yang talking to the chauffeur. </p><br/><p>\"Help my friend up and take care of him. I'll just stay here and vomit first.\"</p><br/><p>... </p><br/><p>Lin Fan was still in a daze as he ended up on his bed. As he was about to sleep, he tried to read his Weibo but his vision was already blurry. He suddenly felt like he was looking at a few phones. As he gathered himself, he felt like vomiting but he still managed to read what Wang Ming Yang said.</p><br/><p>\"Sue your mum. Shanghai Eastern Han Group awaits your lawyer's letter.\" </p><br/><p>Then, he couldn't take it anymore. His head felt extremely dizzy.</p><br/><p>...</p><br/>\n</div>"}

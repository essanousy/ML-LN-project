Moreover, the shutter was pulled down. They were curious.</p><br/><p>\u201cFraud, what are you all doing? Did you get chased out by Master Lin?\u201d Elder Liang asked with a chuckle.</p><br/><p>However, when he saw Wang Da Fu, he didn\u2019t quite understand what this person was doing here. This person looked filthy and his clothes were torn and tattered like a beggar.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian said, \u201cWe\u2019re not doing much. Your Master Lin is busy with something inside and he doesn\u2019t want us to see. That\u2019s why he told us to come out and wait.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s he busy with? Could he be\u2026 Hehehe\u2026\u201d Elder Liang asked halfway and started laughing cunningly.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian looked at Elder Liang disdainfully. \u201cThere is something really wrong with your mind.\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Liang laughed. But when he saw that Wang Da Fu\u2019s fists were tightly clenched as if he was very anxious, Elder Liang asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s this person doing? What has Master Lin done this time?\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian knew how Lin Fan thought. Lin Fan wouldn\u2019t want this to be made known. Fraud Tian waved his hand. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing much. Just a small matter. There are customers at your shop, why don\u2019t you hurry up and do your business.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere are you, boss?\u201d at the entrance of Elder Liang\u2019s shop, two young men were hollering.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m coming, I\u2019m coming.\u201d Seeing that there were customers, Elder Liang rushed over with a wide smile to welcome them.</p><br/><p>In the shop.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan turned on the lights and the inside of the shop completely changed. It was as if they were in a dream-like world. It seemed as if the shop was filled with a strange glow.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, that child was floating in mid-air. Lin Fan was hitting each of the child\u2019s acupuncture points. At the same time, he was infusing the Encyclopedia\u2019s mystical boost into his strikes.</p><br/><p>\u201cSigh. Why must I be so kind? I can\u2019t stand idly by and watch someone die.\u201d Lin Fan shook his head. However, it was fortunate that this brat hadn\u2019t died yet. Using his nature-defying procedures, this child could still be saved.</p><br/><p>Outside.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian looked at Wang Da Fu. \u201cBrother, why don\u2019t I bring you to have a bath? Your body is quite dirty.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Da Fu shook his head. \u201cNo, I have to wait here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat for? Let me tell you that it\u2019s definitely fine now. Also, it will require some time. It\u2019ll be great if you could clean yourself up and put on a new set of clothes,\u201d said Fraud Tian. He was quite welcome here at Cloud Street. He wouldn\u2019t have to pay for most clothes. The shop owners would sometimes even invite him to be their model and give him a set of clothes afterward.</p><br/><p>This would make Fraud Tian laugh delightedly. After all, his unique temperament was not something most people could compare to.</p><br/><p>When he put on a brand new set of clothes, he had an exceptional grandeur.</p><br/><p>Wang Da Fu shook his head. \u201cI can\u2019t leave.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian sighed. \u201cBrother, it\u2019s really fine. You have to trust Master Lin. Your current state really isn\u2019t good. Listen to me. It\u2019s just next door. Clean yourself up and change to a new set of clothes. Perhaps when you\u2019ve cleaned up, your son will be jumping around and waiting for you here.\u201d</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t that Fraud Tian just wanted this guy to bathe at such an important time. However, this smell was really too pungent. He could endure it for a while but after a long period of time, his eyes were even starting to well up with tears.</p><br/><p>Before waiting for Wang Da Fu to say anything, Fraud Tian pulled his arm and started walking towards the bathhouse at the side of the road. Then, he shouted at Zhao Zhong Yang, \u201cGet us a new set of clothes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGot it.\u201d Zhao Zhong Yang nodded and didn\u2019t say more.</p><br/><p>He felt that it was indeed pointless to just wait there. It would be good for Wang Da Fu to get cleaned up.</p><br/><p>In the end, only Wu Tian He and his daughter were left standing at the shop entrance.</p><br/><p>\u201cDad, will that child really be alright?\u201d asked Wu You Lan. She could tell what Fraud Tian had wanted to say when he first saw the child and her heart had sunk as well. She had thought that the child definitely couldn\u2019t be saved.</p><br/><p>Wu Tian He was silent for a moment before he replied, \u201cInitially, I saw from the child\u2019s fortune that he was going to die. But after Master Lin touched him, his fortune changed and he\u2019s going to live.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan was elated. \u201cDoes that mean that the child will be fine?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Tian He nodded. He was actually very curious. He had no idea what was going on and he felt that it was inconceivable.</p><br/><p>He had been here at Cloud Street for a long time and he sometimes felt that his heart had been through tremendous changes.</p><br/><p>Take the surrounding shop owners for example.</p><br/><p>In the past, when he had just come to Cloud Street, he had read the fortunes of those shop owners and he had known how they were.</p><br/><p>But not long after, he realized that these people\u2019s fortunes had been through drastic changes. It had left him in disbelief.</p><br/><p>Because the changes were simply too great.</p><br/><p>Even the most unlucky and poorest fortunes had gradually changed after being with Master Lin.</p><br/><p>The bathhouse.</p><br/><p>Usually, if Wang Da Fu walked in, he would definitely be chased out by people.</p><br/><p>But because Fraud Tian was with him, the bathhouse owner just asked some questions curiously. Fraud Tian just said that they were here for a quick bath</p><br/><p>In the past, Master Lin had been a back scrubber here before. During that time, the owner had been so happy that he would laugh to himself. His business had gotten very good.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian said, \u201cSomebody, come and give us a back scrub.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, Fraud, why are you coming here to bathe today?\u201d the back-scrubber asked with a smile.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian smiled back. \u201cI\u2019m not the one bathing. It\u2019s him. Get someone with good technique to clean him up well.\u201d</p><br/><p>These back-scrubbers had received Lin Fan\u2019s teachings before and their technique could be said to be very reliable. They played an important role in this bathhouse.</p><br/><p>Whenever customers came, they would have endless praise for the back-scrubbers.</p><br/><p>Wang Da Fu\u2019s heart was now filled with thoughts about his child. However, he understood that Fraud Tian had brought him here because he was too dirty and his smell was too pungent.</p><br/><p>Half an hour later.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian brought Wang Da Fu out from the bathhouse. And this Wang Da Fu was enormously different from before. He wasn\u2019t dirty anymore.</p><br/><p>He still looked like a normal farmer but his body was now very clean. His skin was rough and he had the calloused hands of a farmer.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you, thank you\u2026\u201d Wang Da Fu was so moved that he was about to cry. He hadn\u2019t thought that these people would be so good to him.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian smiled. \u201cNo need to thank me. This is the traditional virtue of our Cloud Street. Don\u2019t worry. I guarantee that your son will be fine. Although that youngster isn\u2019t usually very reliable, he is very serious when something like this happens. He won\u2019t let one hair go out of place.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment.</p><br/><p>The shutter was opened.</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang and the rest rushed forward to look at the situation.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s done. He\u2019s fine now,\u201d said Lin Fan as he looked at them. However, when he saw Wang Da Fu, he was startled. It was as if he hadn\u2019t expected Wang Da Fu to have cleaned up during this period of time. Then, he looked at Fraud Tian and understood. Fraud Tian must have brought Wang Da Fu to have a bath.</p></div>\n</div>"}

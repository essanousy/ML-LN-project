As long as he got first place, he would have accomplished his mission and unlocked the sixteenth page of knowledge.</p><br/><p>At the same time, he was very curious as to what kind of task the sixteenth page would bring. If it was something nature-defying, it would be very cool.</p><br/><p>However, he was just daydreaming. He would never be that lucky.</p><br/><p>To be able to get the Wu Xia classification of knowledge was already considered very lucky.</p><br/><p>At night!</p><br/><p>Somewhere at a relatively good looking villa.</p><br/><p>Wu Ya Ting was in her room getting dressed. Tonight, she was going to go out with her girl friends to play so naturally she had to make herself pretty.</p><br/><p>At this moment, her room door was opened. A girl came in and when she saw Wu Ya Ting, a smile appeared on her face. However, the smile quickly disappeared.</p><br/><p>\u201cQing Qing, where are we heading to today?\u201d Wu Ya Ting asked with a smile on her face.</p><br/><p>In front of her was one of her girl friends. There was another one who was still at work and had yet to finish. The three of them had already planned beforehand what time to meet. And when they reached the location, they would just show their reservation.</p><br/><p>Zhang Qing Qing smile and said, \u201cI have already thought about where to go. How about we go to the nightclub my boyfriend runs? Ever since he opened it, we have yet to visit it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh?\u201d Wu Ya Ting was stunned. \u201cWhy are we going there? I feel like that place is very noisy. My head would probably explode.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. Once we go there, we can just open a private room and everything will be fine. So are you okay with it?\u201d</p><br/><p>In the face of the coaxing from Qing Qing, Wu Ya Ting was convinced. She said, \u201cOkay, however, it should just be the few of us, there can\u2019t be anyone else.\u201d</p><br/><p>Her uncle had always been very strict with her and prohibited her from going there alone. As a result, she had not gone there all along. However, after much thought, she felt that it should be fine. Qing Qing was her girl friend and the place that they were going to was opened by Qing Qing\u2019s boyfriend. It should definitely be very safe.</p><br/><p>She had seen Qing Qing\u2019s boyfriend before, he was a very earnest man, so there should not be any issues.</p><br/><p>\u201cYa Ting, I love you. Oh, yeah, you have to wear this today. I gave it to you for your birthday and up till now, you still haven\u2019t worn it. You have to wear it today,\u201d Zhang Qing Qing said as she found the gift that she gave Ya Ting for her birthday in her drawer.</p><br/><p>When Ya Ting saw the present, her face turned red and she said, \u201cAre you crazy? You want to let me wear this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about it? Isn\u2019t it cool? Just wear it this once, please. Ever since I gave it to you, you haven\u2019t even worn it once. It breaks my heart, \u201cZhang Qing Qing pitifully said.</p><br/><p>Wu Ya Ting covered her face. She did not know how she came to know such a best friend. But in the face of her request, she gave in again.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, okay. Just this once, but never again,\u201d she said. To a woman, it was pretty normal to wear underwear like that. However, she was a little shy and felt very embarrassed to do it.</p><br/><p>She wanted to wear a skirt, but now she definitely could not. Thus, she changed to jeans. To her, this was much safer.</p><br/><p>When they were going to leave, Zhang Qing Qing saw that Wu Ya Ting had changed from a skirt to jeans and was momentarily disappointed. However, she quickly started to smile again.</p><br/><p>After all, the jeans were very tight fitting and made her butt look more outstanding, making it more attractive.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Along a certain street.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was sitting there alone and rubbing his chin as he was looking very solemn. Luckily, Wu Yun Gang called him today, if not, he would have missed a big opportunity. Also, this issue not only involved Wu Yun Gang but also Wang Ming Yang.</p><br/><p>Thus, he had to embrace the entire situation to ensure that Wang Ming Yang was safe.</p><br/><p>The horoscope indeed had countless permutations that were very hard for people to understand. Even if they understood the surface of it, it did not mean that they would get everything.</p><br/><p>Afterward, he took out his phone and gave a familiar person a call.</p><br/><p>Chang Hai Ge was playing around at that time. Then, when he saw the caller I.D, he immediately quietened down and he anxiously said, \u201cMaster Lin, you\u2019re looking for me?\u201d</p><br/><p>To Chang Hai Ge, Master Lin was a god. He was the person that he worshipped. Since Lin Fan called him today, naturally, it made him feel very excited.</p><br/><p>When he put the phone down, Chang Hai Ge, with a face full of excitement, said, \u201cShen Ming, let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chang Hai Ge\u2019s face was gleaming with a huge smile. He was very pleased with himself as he was shaking his phone around as he said, \u201cDo you know who called me just now? I\u2019ll tell you. It was Master Lin. Master Lin is in Beijing and he asked me to go and find him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWow!\u201d Shen Ming heard that it was Master Lin and he got excited also. He said, \u201cBrother Chang, Master Lin actually reached out to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>He was very grateful towards Master Lin. The last time, Brother Chang almost became handicapped. But in the end, Master Lin saved him. Also, Master Lin was very good at fortune-telling. It made them feel very awesome that Master Lin had reached out to Brother Chang. Something definitely must have happened.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>9 pm at night.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan, Chang Hai Ge and Shen Ming were sitting there. The surrounding music was blasting and almost destroying their eardrums.</p><br/><p>Chang Hai Ge and Shen Ming had always been here in Beijing. However, they rarely came to a place like this, mainly because it was too noisy. Also, some of the people were like madmen, swaying from side to side, they had no idea what they were doing.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, what are we doing here?\u201d Chang Hai Ge shouted into Lin Fan\u2019s ear.</p><br/><p>If he was not loud, Lin Fan would not be able to hear him.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan snarled, \u201cWait\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh\u2026\u201d Chang Hai Ge immediately nodded. If Master Lin said wait then they would wait.</p><br/><p>Inside the private room.</p><br/><p>The three of them, Wu Ya Ting, Zhang Qing Qing and Su Fang, were playing around inside the room.</p><br/><p>\u201cYa Ting, come here and drink some alcohol,\u201d Zhang Qing Qing said as she poured a glass.</p><br/><p>Wu Ya Ting said, \u201cQing Qing, I can\u2019t drink alcohol. If I drink, I\u2019ll get drunk.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Qing Qing waved her off and said, \u201cIt\u2019ll be fine. I don\u2019t get drunk even after a thousand glasses. If you get drunk, I\u2019ll send you home. Since we came out today, you must have fun.\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Fang said, \u201cQing Qing, we agreed to come out and have fun but we shouldn\u2019t get drunk. This place is a little shady so what do we do if something happens?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Qing Qing boasted, \u201cThis is my boyfriend\u2019s turf. Who would dare to touch us?\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, four men came in.</p><br/><p>Zhang Qing Qing saw one of them. She immediately stood up and with a face of excitement, said, \u201cDear\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Hao grabbed onto Zhang Qing Qing then laughed and said, \u201cYa Ting, Su Fang, welcome. Today, you guys are here at my place. Order whatever you want, no need to feel bad.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Hao was Zhang Qing Qing\u2019s boyfriend. Wu Ya Ting and Su Fang did not have any reason to be alarmed, so they laughed and said thank you.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet me introduce you guys. These three are my good buddies and we\u2019re brothers to the death.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThese two are my wife\u2019s girl friends, Wu Ya Ting and Su Fang. These two are really pretty so if you are single, then you guys better seize the opportunity.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if you guys recognize this pretty lady but you definitely will recognize her uncle. Wu Yun Gang is a famous entrepreneur here in Beijing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Hao smiled as he introduced them. He did not see any problems at all.</p><br/><p>This moment, one of the men stepped forward and said, \u201cI know Wu Yun Gang. He has done a lot of business with my family. To meet someone who knows him, I must definitely drink with her. Beautiful lady Wu, I offer you a drink.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Ya Ting wanted to take a drink herself but then Zhang Qing Qing passed her the glass of alcohol she had poured just now and said, \u201cYa Ting, have some alcohol. You won\u2019t get drunk from a bit of it. Also, even if you get drunk, I\u2019m here so it is okay.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Hao laughed and said, \u201cYa Ting, I feel like you should drink with Brother Liang. Your uncle has earned a lot of money from working with Brother Liang\u2019s family. This drink is definitely a must.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Ya Ting stopped to think for a moment. She had some conflicting thoughts but she had no choice. She wanted to share the responsibility with her uncle so she had no choice but to take a drunk.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, our female hero,\u201d Wang Hao said as he clapped his hands, trying to flatter her.</p><br/><p>These polite words made the environment slightly awkward.</p><br/><p>Wang Hao said, \u201cQing Qing, you guys just play here. It seems that you guys aren\u2019t able to relax with us around. Also, if anything happens, give us a call.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Qing Qing nodded, \u201cGot it.\u201d</p><br/><p>When the few guys were here, Wu Ya Ting and Su Fang did not talk at all so the environment was definitely very awkward. As a result, them leaving was probably for the best.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

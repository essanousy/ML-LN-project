It has such nice eyes.\"</p><br/><p>\"Shiba Inu your mom. It's a Formosan Mountain dog.\" </p><br/><p>\"Your sister's a Formosan Mountain dog. This is Chinese rural dog. Please don't look down on Elder Dog Nicholas.\"</p><br/><p>\"Hey, where did the Flame War Emperor go? It seems like I haven't seen him in a long time.\"</p><br/><p>\"Yeah, from past experience, he would have appeared on Master Lin's Weibo but now there's no sight of him at all.\" </p><br/><p>\"To the one above, don't talk about that for now. Didn't Master Lin's Weibo get banned recently? How did it get unbanned so quickly?\"</p><br/><p>\"Haha, did you forget who Master Lin is? How could anyone ban his Weibo for a long time?\"</p><br/><p>\"Enough said, repost, let's repost\u2026\" </p><br/><p>Master Lin's Weibo account ban got lifted in such a short time that it stunned countless internet celebrities. Qi Yi Weibo had sent out a notice to the other celebrities and told them not to get involved in this matter. But now that Master Lin's Weibo had been banned and unbanned in such a short time, many people were shocked. Could it be that there was a new policy in place? Furthermore, the normal netizens didn't receive any warning after reposting such news. There must be more to this. </p><br/><p>One of the Internet celebrities tried reposting to test it out and realized that nothing went wrong indeed. Then, a few other internet celebrities also followed suit. This issue started to go viral again on Weibo.</p><br/><p>At Starlight.</p><br/><p>Jiang Li slammed the table angrily, \"Where did this stupid Master Lin come from? What's the matter with Qi Yi Weibo?\" </p><br/><p>Qi Yi Weibo had warned everyone about this matter and prevented any Internet celebrity from getting involved in this. They had to delete all the related news. The issue had died down for a moment but now, it seemed like it was going to go viral again. Jiang Li and Chen Juan were extremely angry. At the same time, they were anxious too. They knew they couldn't hide everything. The most they could do was to hide it from the ordinary crowd. But if things were to go out of hand, they'd be helpless too. </p><br/><p>Chen Juan was pretty worried but she calmed herself, \"Don't be anxious, we need to tackle this problem properly. I just contacted the person in charge of operations in Qi Yi Weibo. He said he can't be held responsible for this matter. The chief had already given his instructions. I am going to the organization now to make things clear and prevent things from worsening.\" </p><br/><p>Jiang Li nodded. That was all they could do. He didn't expect a small issue like this to create such a big uproar. It was extremely disadvantageous to them and they had to make a comeback.</p><br/><p>The netizens online didn't know the truth but they all thought that this student was officially finished. No matter what the truth was, her career was over. </p><br/><p>\"This student, Xia Yi Mo, is basically dead meat.\"</p><br/><p>\"Yeah, she's a true lady. I'm impressed. People would avoid this matter like a plague but she dared to charge forward and tackle this problem directly. I'm really impressed.\"</p><br/><p>\"Although an Internet celebrity is involved in this matter, he still has to produce evidence to make substantial claims.\" </p><br/><p>\"Let's remain neutral. When we first read this piece of news, everyone was just influenced by rage. But there isn't any evidence and it can't represent anything.\" </p><br/><p>\"This matter isn't just a one-time thing. The Xin Cheng Professor incident and this Starlight incident are practically the same. But at least the Xin Cheng incident came to a perfect conclusion.\" </p><br/><p>At Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan helped to doll up Elder Dog Nicholas. He realized that Elder Dog Nicholas was extremely suitable to be a model dog. But the graceful glimpse of his had disappeared and no matter how he tried to communicate with Elder Dog Nicholas, it was useless. </p><br/><p>\"Come, give me another fearsome look.\" Lin Fan held onto his phone as he gave Elder Dog Nicholas a makeover.</p><br/><p>Elder Dog Nicholas, who was laying down, glanced at Lin Fan and stuck out his tongue. He yawned and crossed his paws as he rested his head on them. It was as if he was reflecting on his life as a dog.</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang laughed, \"Haha, Master Lin, Elder Dog is so indifferent.\"</p><br/><p>Woof, woof!</p><br/><p>Elder Dog Nicholas barked a couple of times but Lin Fan understood what he meant. </p><br/><p>\"These people are so boring. They keep disrupting my rest.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was speechless, \"...\"</p><br/><p>Woof woof! </p><br/><p>At that instant, there was a series of barks from the street. Elder Dog Nicholas fiercely raised his head and looked outside. A poodle was walking on the street casually. Elder Dog Nicholas charged towards the poodle without any hesitation. </p><br/><p>Lin Fan sighed, this 'chap' really wasn't suitable for him. He decided that he wouldn't give him any scallion pancakes the next day.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian smiled, \"How can a dog understand your words?\" </p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled, \"He definitely understands. I can even understand what he's saying.\"</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan was playing with her phone and suddenly, she screamed, \"Quick, come have a look. Starlight has issued a letter to Weibo. It's so infuriating. They're clearly trying to cover up the truth.\" </p><br/><p>Lin Fan stood up. Elder Dog Nicholas was not giving him any respect. He would have to teach him a lesson in future. Then, he looked at the phone.</p><br/><p>Official Starlight Weibo: \"Student Xia Yi Mo has mild clinical depression. The latest report confirmed that the incident happened due to the illness. As a result, it has caused damage to the school's reputation as well as that of two professors. The school has already made internal arrangements (relevant parties have been expelled). Please refrain from spreading rumors and worsening the situation.\" </p><br/><p>The netizens weren't surprised at the news as they had predicted it.</p><br/><p>\"The student from Starlight still had to give up her education in the end. Perhaps she would have become a formidable figure in the entertainment. But now that everything's over, she should pack up her stuff and go home. It's not just Starlight expelling her; the whole world is looking to flame her. That's the biggest problem here.\" </p><br/><p>\"This problem hasn't ended yet. We are still seeking the truth.\"</p><br/><p>\"Seek my a*s, the truth is that Starlight had nothing to do with this matter. It's just Xia Yi Mo's clinical depression acting up, causing her to damage the reputation of others.\" </p><br/><p>\"To the one above, do you have any evidence to support that?\"</p><br/><p>\"To the one above the one above, you don't have to say anymore.\"</p><br/><p>... </p><br/><p>Lin Fan immediately reposted Starlight's message and said, \"F*ck your mom's dog sh*t.\"</p><br/><p>When the message got sent out, it immediately caused a stir online.</p><br/><p>\"666\u2026, Master Lin is too awesome.\"</p><br/><p>\"I believe in Master Lin unconditionally and I will definitely fight for him until the end.\"</p><br/><p>\"Forget it, Master Lin. Although you're powerful, you can't do anything about this matter.\" </p><br/><p>\"Yeah, Starlight won't allow such a thing to happen. Furthermore, there isn't any evidence in this matter. There's no turning back from this.\"</p><br/><p>\"I agree with the views of the person above.\" </p><br/><p>Jiang Li and Chen Juan looked at Master Lin's Weibo and immediately replied. They thought he was crazy since this matter had nothing to do with him anyway.</p><br/><p>Jiang Li said, \"May I ask this Master Lin to be cautious with your words? As for your malignment, we have already gathered the evidence and we will deal with it by law.\" </p><br/><p>Chen Juan also replied, \"Now that the truth is out and it all happened because of Xia Yi Mo's clinical depression, you don't have to guess any further. Please erase all relevant content or we will take action accordingly.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \"@Jiang Li @Chen Juan, f*ck your moms' dog sh*t.\"</p><br/><p>Netizens: \"...\"</p><br/><p>Jiang Li: \"...\"</p><br/><p>Chen Juan: \"...\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

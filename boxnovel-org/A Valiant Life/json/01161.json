At a restaurant.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian and Zhao Zhong Yang had their heads lowered as they ate silently. They had no business being in this environment.</p><br/><p>This kind of place was the kind that only true big shots could go to.</p><br/><p>To Fraud Tian, this meal was really too abundant, so much so that he couldn\u2019t quite take it.</p><br/><p>Following the boss here was pretty good. He was able to enjoy all kinds of delicacies.</p><br/><p>\u201cFraud, give me some of your winnings later,\u201d said Zhao Zhong Yang softly as he ate.</p><br/><p>He was really filled with envy.</p><br/><p>Even this Fraud had managed to win money but he, on the other hand, had lost all his money. It didn\u2019t make sense. <em>How can such a dashing guy like me be inferior to this flashy Fraud?</em></p><br/><p>Fraud Tian swallowed an abalone in one go. \u201cAre you kidding me? Just eat your food and don\u2019t try to take my money.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re too stingy. This is the end of our friendship.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang didn\u2019t know what else to say. This Fraud didn\u2019t have any sense of brotherhood at all.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Wu You Lan and the rest were gathered together, looking at the photos they had taken today as they laughed and chatted cheerily.</p><br/><p>\u201cLook. This photo is good. The only bad thing is that Brother Lin\u2019s expression looks weird.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, what an awkward smile.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Lin, look at yourself. Doesn\u2019t this photo make you look ugly?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the photo on the phone and wouldn\u2019t admit it. \u201cI don\u2019t look ugly at all. I feel that I\u2019m smiling really brightly here. There must be a problem with your eyes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Xu said, \u201cIf you look ugly, just admit it. One has to be honest.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re speaking as if you look great in the photos. Look\u2026 Look at\u2026\u201d Lin Fan scrolled through the photos on the phone. But even after scrolling through many photos, he still had nothing to say. <em>Did she edit these photos? How can she look so perfect? There are no flaws at all!</em></p><br/><p><em></em></p><br/><p><em>If she actually edited all of these photos, it would be normal. But it doesn\u2019t seem like the case at all!</em></p><br/><p>Liu Xu smiled. \u201cRemember this. Beautiful people will always appear beautiful in photos. Don\u2019t overthink things. Look. Can you even find a photo where I don\u2019t look good?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was speechless. Then, he passed the phone back. \u201cThat\u2019s amazing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan covered her mouth as she giggled. \u201cBrother Lin, let\u2019s take a better-looking photo tomorrow.\u201d</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Yun Xue Yao praised, \u201cActually, you look good in the photos, Brother Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s just the view from the eyes of a lover. Even if he looked terrible, you would still think he\u2019s good-looking.\u201d Liu Xu didn\u2019t hold back her words at all.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Jin Meng agreed very much with Liu Xu\u2019s words. Master Lin did indeed look very strange in those photos. He was smiling but he didn\u2019t quite look like he was smiling.</p><br/><p>It was as if he didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry.</p><br/><p>However, her best friend and that Wu You Lan had completely fallen into this man\u2019s grasp. It was impossible for them to remove themselves from it.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan, on the other hand, didn\u2019t want to dwell on this matter any longer. He immediately tried to change the topic of conversation.</p><br/><p>\u201cFraud, can\u2019t the two of you eat a little slower? You look as if you have never eaten before.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian swallowed his food, then said, \u201cKid, don\u2019t turn the attention on us. We\u2019re just eating and not speaking. This conversation has nothing to do with us.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang nodded as he hummed in agreement.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou guys\u2026\u201d Lin Fan felt helpless. The two of them really didn\u2019t know how to act graciously. He felt as if he had wasted his efforts caring for them. They didn\u2019t even know how to help him to change the topic.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, Xue Yao, you\u2019re here! What a coincidence!\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, a voice came from in front.</p><br/><p>When Yun Xue Yao saw who it was, her brows instantly furrowed. He hadn\u2019t expected Ma Shao Hao to come.</p><br/><p>Jin Meng was taken aback as well. She couldn\u2019t understand why Ma Shao Hao would appear here. Hadn\u2019t she already warned him not to mess with Master Lin?</p><br/><p>What was he trying to prove by coming here?</p><br/><p>Ma Shao Hao said with a smile, \u201cDon\u2019t misunderstand. I\u2019m not here for any unusual reasons. I\u2019m here today to eat with a guest of mine but I saw Xue Yao, so I came over to take a look.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet me guess. Which one is Master Lin?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ma Shao Hao scanned the room, then his gaze landed on Zhao Zhong Yang. \u201cThis one looks particularly wretched. You\u2019re definitely not Master Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis one is dressed so flashily. You\u2019re definitely not him either. After all, you look like you\u2019re close to sixty-years-old. I don\u2019t think Xue Yao would fall for you even if she was blind.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen it leaves one last person. You look alright and you\u2019re very calm. You have to be Master Lin. I didn\u2019t think that the Master Lin who has such an incredible influence on the Internet would look so normal. If you weren\u2019t sitting with Xue Yao, I might not even be able to recognize you.\u201d</p><br/><p>*Bam!*</p><br/><p>Yun Xue Yao slammed the table furiously. \u201cMa Shao Hao, don\u2019t go overboard!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, Xue Yao, please mind your image. This isn\u2019t your company,\u201d said Ma Shao Hao hastily as smiled.</p><br/><p>He was a self-knowing person. He knew that he really couldn\u2019t mess with this Master Lin. Since Yun Xue Yao didn\u2019t like him, he definitely couldn\u2019t get her. However, there was nothing wrong with coming over to take a look and saying a few words to vent his emotions.</p><br/><p>Seeing that Brother Lin was still there, Yun Xue Yao felt that she couldn\u2019t show her angry side. If Brother Lin didn\u2019t like it, what would she do?</p><br/><p>Then, she took a deep breath and said, \u201cMa Shao Hao, please leave. I\u2019m eating with my friends.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jin Meng added, \u201cWhat are you still doing here? Don\u2019t go overboard.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ma Shao Hao shrugged helplessly. \u201cI\u2019m really not here to do anything. I\u2019m just here to take a look. Hello, Master Lin, nice to meet you.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, Ma Shao Hao extended his hand.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan\u2019s brows furrowed as he felt that this was quite interesting. He could tell that this Ma Shao Hao seemed to like Yun Xue Yao. Was he really here just to take a look?</p><br/><p>Then, Lin Fan extended his hand with a smile. Although this person\u2019s words were unpleasant, it was fine to shake hands.</p><br/><p>But then, Ma Shao Hao suddenly retracted his hand forcefully.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I just washed my hands. I\u2019ll still have to go and hold a very clean thing later on. I shan\u2019t be shaking your hand.\u201d Ma Shao Hao laughed. He felt an indescribable pleasure.</p><br/><p>\u201cMa Shao Hao.\u201d Yun Xue Yao was so angry that her face was red. She hadn\u2019t expected this guy to humiliate Master Lin in front of her. That was unforgivable.</p><br/><p>Jin Meng\u2019s brows scrunched up together. She felt helpless. Love can easily make a person blind, especially a man who has lost his loved one. He would definitely feel extremely unpleasant.</p><br/><p>This guy\u2019s brain had really short-circuited. He was actually acting unbridled in front of Master Lin.</p><br/><p>Ma Shao Hao laughed. Then, he quickly turned away and prepared to leave.</p><br/><p>He had already let out the anger in his heart. It really felt great to come here and make fun of Master Lin.</p><br/><p>\u201cStop. Come back.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, Lin Fan stood up and shouted at Ma Shao Hao.</p><br/><p>Ma Shao Hao was stunned as he stood rooted to the ground. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCome here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p></div>\n</div>"}

He couldn\u2019t bear to use any Encyclopedic Points at all and he just saved them up.</p><br/><p>It seemed that it was the day of Liu Xu\u2019s opening ceremony. Wu You Lan had meticulously dressed herself up. She was wearing a dress and she really looked pretty good. She was quite beautiful.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Lin, how do you think I look?\u201d Wu You Lan spun around in front of Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded, \u201cMmm, you look very nice.\u201d</p><br/><p>This was the truth. It wasn\u2019t a lie. Wu You Lan had always been rather beautiful. When she dressed up like this, she was naturally even better looking.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go. It\u2019s time for us to go.\u201d Wu You Lan tugged on Lin Fan\u2019s hand as she wanted to head over to the place.</p><br/><p>\u201cGo where?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan replied, \u201cIt\u2019s Sister Liu Xu\u2019s opening ceremony today! Didn\u2019t you agree to go together with me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cI need to consider it. Why don\u2019t you go first?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan shook her head, \u201cNo, you promised me. Moreover, you\u2019re in such a good mood today. You said that if your mood is good, you\u2019ll go.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan didn\u2019t say much else. He stood up. \u201cAlright then, let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><br/><p>An ecstatic look appeared on Wu You Lan\u2019s face. \u201cThis is great!\u201d</p><br/><p>Her ultimate goal was to bring Brother Lin with her to attend the ceremony. If she went alone, it would definitely be boring.</p><br/><p>Long River Road.</p><br/><p>Dongyue Entertainment Hotel.</p><br/><p>Liu Xu had bought this place from someone. This place had always been decorated luxuriously but its business was always bad. The original boss had been distressed and he had never expected a wealthy, beautiful lady to be willing to take over the place. This made him extremely happy. But soon after, the original boss became distressed again.</p><br/><p>This wealthy, beautiful lady had a very steady strategy. She had decreased the price to its lowest. Even if he didn\u2019t want to sell it, he had no choice because he couldn\u2019t keep sustaining the place.</p><br/><p>In the end, this hotel had been sold to Liu Xu at a very low price.</p><br/><p>Liu Xu had reverted to her former occupation, fusing entertainment and hotel into one. She would go down the high-end path right from the start.</p><br/><p>At the entrance.</p><br/><p>There were many flower baskets. These weren\u2019t gifted by other people. They were bought by Liu Xu herself. No matter what, she couldn\u2019t lose out to others in grandeur.</p><br/><p>\u201cChief Liu, there aren\u2019t many people here to congratulate us,\u201d said Wang Xin. She was a helper that Liu Xu had found. This hotel required people to manage it.</p><br/><p>Liu Xu nodded as if she wasn\u2019t bothered by that. She had gotten many connections in Jiangning in the past but she didn\u2019t know many people in Shanghai. This opening ceremony was naturally very cold and empty.</p><br/><p>When Wang Xin saw that Chief Liu didn\u2019t say anything, she felt helpless. She used to be a great student of Hotel Management. After graduating, she had held a post in a large hotel in Shanghai. However, she had been pulled over by Chief Liu because Chief Liu could give her what other hotels couldn\u2019t.</p><br/><p>Although her appointment wouldn\u2019t be low in other hotels, she would never have the opportunity to make a great impact.</p><br/><p>Therefore, once Chief Liu made a promise to her, she immediately jumped over.</p><br/><p>Now that it was the opening ceremony, she was filled with worry. This Entertainment Hotel was catered towards high-end guests but at that moment, there wasn\u2019t even a single supporter. This made her feel very hopeless.</p><br/><p>Also, that would still have been okay but what was worse was that another hotel had just opened nearby as well.</p><br/><p>At their side, it was very lively. There was heavy traffic and it was bustling with activity.</p><br/><p>At that moment, a middle-aged man walked over. When he saw Liu Xu, his eyes gleamed as if he had discovered some new piece of land. He asked curiously, \u201cDongyue Entertainment Hotel, that\u2019s a pretty good name. Do you know who\u2019s the boss of this place? It\u2019s a little too quiet for an opening, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, I forgot to introduce myself. I\u2019m the boss of that Ruyi Hotel, opposite from here. When I saw another hotel opening, I decided to come and take a look.\u201d</p><br/><p>This introduction was perfect. He had unintentionally revealed himself as the boss of the opposite hotel and sent out the message that he was a rich man.</p><br/><p>Liu Xu didn\u2019t even give him a single glance. Wang Xin, who was next to her said, \u201cThis is Dongyue Entertainment Hotel\u2019s Chief Liu.\u201d</p><br/><p>The man was taken aback. He looked at Liu Xu with disbelief. He had never expected this lady to be the chief of this hotel. He couldn\u2019t help but be astonished.</p><br/><p>But when he saw that no one was here to congratulate them, he laughed in his heart. It seemed that this lady didn\u2019t know how to run a business, nor did she have any social connections.</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think that Chief Liu would not only be young and beautiful but also capable of running such a business. That is admirable. But this opening ceremony is a little cold and lifeless. If you don\u2019t mind, Chief Liu, you can go over to my side to have a seat. I can recommend you to various wealthy people in Shanghai as a way of helping a fellow person in the same industry,\u201d Xu Ming said with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need for that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Xu said that coldly, without even looking at him. She just ignored him like that.</p><br/><p>Xu Ming was startled. A slight look of displeasure appeared on his face but he didn\u2019t show it. \u201cChief Liu, let\u2019s get to know each other. I, Xu Ming, have some insight in the hotel management field. We can exchange numbers and discuss some business matters in future when we have the opportunity.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need for that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Another cold reply. This made Xu Ming a little upset.</p><br/><p>This lady really didn\u2019t know what was good for her. But it was fine that way too. He was quite knowledgeable about running hotels. Moreover, he had pretty good connections in Shanghai.</p><br/><p>He wanted to see how long this lady\u2019s hotel could last.</p><br/><p>The liveliness of an opening ceremony has a lot to do with one\u2019s reputation.</p><br/><p>This was the first time he had seen such an opening ceremony, without a single person. It was really a joke.</p><br/><p>Wang Xin, on the other hand, was panicking. Although people in the same industry were enemies, that man seemed to have some reputation. Treating him so coldly didn\u2019t seem like a very good choice.</p><br/><p>Since she was under Liu Xu, she naturally wanted the hotel to do well. But now, things didn\u2019t seem quite right. It was just the opening and she had already offended another person in the industry. This happened way too quickly.</p><br/><p>\u201cChief Xu, you seem to be very knowledgeable about running a hotel. If you have any suggestions, please tell us,\u201d said Wang Xin with a smile.</p><br/><p>Xu Ming smiled, then his expression turned serious. \u201cI don\u2019t have any suggestions but this Chief Liu of yours is too cold. She isn\u2019t suitable for social interaction. In</p><br/><p>Shanghai, there are as many five-star hotels as there are dogs. If you want to stand out among the many entertainment hotels, it depends not on service or decoration but on networking skills.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Xin was a little embarrassed. She didn\u2019t say any more.</p><br/><p>At that moment, a voice came from afar.</p><br/><p>\u201cSister Liu Xu.\u201d Wu You Lan had arrived.</p><br/><p>When Xu Ming looked over, his eyes lit up once more. It was another beautiful lady. This beautiful lady was very different from Chief Liu.</p><br/><p>One of them was cute and lively, the other was cold and silent.</p><br/><p>Of course, the cute and lively one was better.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan got off the car and said, \u201cHehe, Liu Xu, this opening ceremony of yours is really cold and lifeless. There\u2019s not even a single person.</p><br/><p>This was the most miserable opening ceremony that he had ever seen. Even when a normal hawker started a business, there would be many people.</p><br/><p>How pitiful.</p><br/><p>Liu Xu looked at Lin Fan with an emotionless face. \u201cYou aren\u2019t the first person to say that. This Chief Xu has already said that long ago. He wanted to introduce some people to me to help me improve my hotel.\u201d</p><br/><p>Of course, Lin Fan could see the problem at hand. He looked afar and there was indeed another hotel there.</p><br/><p>Chief Xu smiled, \u201cChief Liu, we are in the same industry. Of course, we have to help each other out.\u201d</p><br/><p>He was harboring errant thoughts.</p><br/><p>Although Lin Fan and Liu Xu had some little misunderstandings between them, Lin Fan could tell that something was amiss about Chief Xu. He was a little unreasonable.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou just need people, right? I\u2019ll call some over. Just wait, I guarantee that this place will be very lively. But you have to be able to handle the crowd.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Xu smiled thinly and replied with a giggle.</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p></div>\n</div>"}

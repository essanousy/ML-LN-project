But he wasn\u2019t afraid at all.</p><br/><p>Godfather Qin smiled cheerily, \u201cHello, Master Lin. I\u2019m Lil\u2019 Liu\u2019s friend. My friends affectionately call me Godfather Qin. Today, I want to invite Master Lin for a meeting. I have paid particular attention to Master Lin\u2019s past deeds and I admire you very much. I want to make friends with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled, \u201cFinally, someone who knows how to talk. But I don\u2019t know you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not important. Please give me some face, Master Lin, and have a meal with me. After that, we\u2019ll be friends, isn\u2019t that right?\u201d Godfather Qin\u2019s tone was warm. It was as if he really wanted to get to know Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan pondered for a moment. It seemed that the breakthrough for this incident would have to depend on tonight. Then, without hesitation, he said, \u201cAlright, judging by your voice, you\u2019re probably an old man. I may not be good at anything but I respect my elders. Since you\u2019ve requested this, it\u2019s not a problem. What time? And where?\u201d</p><br/><p>Godfather Qin smiled, \u201cTell me your address. I\u2019ll send someone to pick you up.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, no problem.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two of them hung up happily.</p><br/><p>Godfather Qin smiled confidently. He had been able to move unhindered for tens of years. He had seen every kind of person and every kind of situation there was to see. Regarding Lil\u2019 Liu\u2019s way of doing things, he didn\u2019t like it. It was too unpleasant and it offended people too easily.</p><br/><p>To have been able to get to where he was, Godfather Qin had many friends and few enemies.</p><br/><p>With his tens of years of competence, how could he not be able to resolve matters with a youngster?</p><br/><p>Nighttime.</p><br/><p>Godfather Qin sent a driver over.</p><br/><p>In the car, Lin Fan unlocked his phone. He had already asked for Zhao Zhong Yang\u2019s broadcasting account. He registered it on his phone and started broadcasting. Then, he put his phone in his chest pocket, leaving the camera lens exposed.</p><br/><p>The broadcast title was very dominant.</p><br/><p>\u2018Master Lin brings you into the darkness.\u2019</p><br/><p>The fans had originally wanted to see Zhao Zhong Yang broadcasting but when they saw the title, they boiled up in excitement.</p><br/><p>Master Lin was actually broadcasting. This was big news.</p><br/><p>This was probably the first time.</p><br/><p>And what did this title mean?</p><br/><p>What darkness?</p><br/><p>The driver occasionally looked into his back mirror at the young man at the back. He was Godfather Qin\u2019s personal chauffeur. Naturally, he knew what had happened recently.</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t understand why this guy had the guts to anger Godfather Qin.</p><br/><p>Godfather Qin, to him, was a god. His hand could cover the skies. He had the entire Northeast in his grasps. Although he was already old, a single move from him could cause huge impacts.</p><br/><p>In the broadcast room.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, why isn\u2019t Master Lin talking?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShh, be quiet. Master Lin is allowing the mood to ferment. Can\u2019t you see he\u2019s in a car? He must be heading towards the destination.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat makes sense.\u201d</p><br/><p>Soon, they reached their destination.</p><br/><p>The driver got off the car and opened the door for Lin Fan. \u201cMaster Lin, please. Godfather Qin and Godfather Liu are already waiting inside.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan heard that Godfather Liu had come as well, he couldn\u2019t help but smile. It seemed that tonight would be quite rewarding.</p><br/><p>Golden City Hotel.</p><br/><p>This hotel was Godfather Liu\u2019s property. It was one of the top hotels in the Northeast. Most people who came here were wealthy and respected people. Mainly because Godfather Liu\u2019s social connections were vast, many people wanted to come here to meet him, to boost their connections.</p><br/><p>But today, the hotel wasn\u2019t receiving any guests. It was only waiting for Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>In the private room.</p><br/><p>Godfather Liu was sitting there with an unnatural expression on his face. He knew that that despicable b*stard was coming but he couldn\u2019t do anything. And he even had to eat with that b*stard and chat together. This was not his style at all.</p><br/><p>However, Godfather Qin requested for this, so he was helpless. Still, he asked unwillingly, \u201cGodfather Qin, if that kid still doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s good for him, what will we do?\u201d</p><br/><p>Godfather Qin\u2019s hair was snow white but he was still full of energy. He had a smile on his old face. His eyes were full of vigor and they seemed to see through everything. He said, \u201cThat won\u2019t happen.\u201d</p><br/><p>Creak!</p><br/><p>At that moment, the private room door was pushed open.</p><br/><p>To Lin Fan, this hotel seemed lavish and luxurious. A single meal was probably not cheap.</p><br/><p>As he entered the private room, he saw the two of them and smile. \u201cGodfather Qin, Godfather Liu, nice to meet you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Godfather Liu looked at Lin Fan with a gleam of rage in his eyes. However, he resisted it. \u201cNice to meet you, Master Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>Godfather Qin smiled, \u201cMaster Lin, please sit.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan didn\u2019t refuse and just sat down.</p><br/><p>Godfather Qin waved his hand, signaling for the rest of the people to go out. Then, he extended his hand. \u201cMaster Lin, this is our first time meeting. Let\u2019s chat as we eat.\u201d</p><br/><p>In the broadcast room.</p><br/><p>The netizens were crying out in surprise.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, they\u2019re big shots! They\u2019re all big shots!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck, Master Lin is going into the enemy lines alone. He\u2019s walking into the lion\u2019s den!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGodfather Liu. That\u2019s the behind-the-scenes mastermind that Master Lin talked about. He\u2019s Ying Jin\u2019s lover.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShh. Everyone, be quiet. Let\u2019s see what the situation is like.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Godfather Qin looked at Lin Fan and nodded. He couldn\u2019t help but be in admiration. At such a young age, Lin Fan was already so capable. It was unheard of. Then, Godfather Qin raised his wine cup. \u201cMaster Lin, please.\u201d</p><br/><p>The three of them drained their cups in a single gulp.</p><br/><p>The white wine was hot but to Godfather Qin and Godfather Liu, it wasn\u2019t a problem at all. Lin Fan, on the other hand, felt that drinking it like this was unbearable. He sneakily bought a Alcohol-Dissipating Tablet from the Encyclopedia\u2019s department store. Then, he would be fine no matter how much he drank.</p><br/><p>Godfather Qin put down his wine cup and said, \u201cMaster Lin, Lil\u2019 Liu had some conflict with you previously. I know that but I think that everyone\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the situation and didn\u2019t give Godfather Qin the chance to talk. He raised another cup and said, \u201cLet\u2019s not talk about anything else and just drink first. When we\u2019re done drinking, our connection will be deeper.\u201d</p><br/><p>Godfather Qin was startled. He hadn\u2019t expected this kid to say that. Then, he smiled, \u201cAlright, alright. As they say, \u2018No discord, no concord\u2019. Tonight, I\u2019ll drink with you to the end. Lil\u2019 Liu, what are you waiting for. Hurry up and propose a toast to Master Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>Godfather Liu was unhappy but he had to listen to Godfather Qin. He raised his cup. \u201cMaster Lin, this toast is to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell said.\u201d Lin Fan smiled and gulped down the wine in one go. Then, he ate some dishes before filling up the cups again.</p><br/><p>In the broadcast room.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, what\u2019s going on? This is what Master Lin wants to show us?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck. They\u2019re working hand in hand. I shan\u2019t watch anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m a little disappointed. He knows that these are bad people but he\u2019s still eating together with them. This is really disappointing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c^Are you retarded? Just watch slowly. Has Master Lin ever disappointed us?\u201d</p><br/><p>Several cups of wine entered their stomachs.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan patted Godfather Liu on the shoulder. \u201cLil\u2019 Liu, really, you should\u2019ve just invited me for a meal long ago and everything would have been fine. You had to cause trouble to such an extent. Don\u2019t you think that you\u2019ve been wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>Godfather Liu was enraged. This kid actually called him Lil\u2019 Liu. However, he held in the rage. \u201cYes, it\u2019s my fault. It\u2019s because I didn\u2019t think it through. I\u2019ll drink a cup as punishment.\u201d</p><br/><p>A cup of wine went down his stomach.</p><br/><p>When Godfather Qin saw this, he nodded contently. He had been doing business in the Northeast for so many years and he had never come across someone who didn\u2019t know how to appreciate favors. To him, this Master Lin was someone who looked at the bigger picture. He was already so capable at such a young age. It was clear that he wasn\u2019t unwise.</p><br/><p>\u201cGodfather Qin, let\u2019s drink as well,\u201d shouted Lin Fan as he raised his cup.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, okay.\u201d Godfather Qin nodded. If it was just anyone, he wouldn\u2019t have given that person face but he knew that this kid had people behind him with high statuses, hence, this kid was worth getting to know.</p><br/><p>And looking at the kid drinking, he seemed very happy as well.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Lin Fan patted Godfather Liu on the shoulder. \u201cLil\u2019 Liu, I\u2019m really sorry about this. I reported your things and caused you to lose quite a sum of money. I was too rash about this. If you were nicer to me at first, this wouldn\u2019t have happened, would it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Godfather Liu\u2019s face was slightly red. He had clearly drunk a lot but his mind was still clear. He waved his hand. \u201cNo problem, it\u2019s just a little money. If I can make friends with Master Lin, this money is nothing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha,\u201d Lin Fan laughed, \u201cGood. That\u2019s a good attitude. Let\u2019s drink once more.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Godfather Qin heard these two talking, he kept feeling as if something wasn\u2019t right. However, the atmosphere was good so he didn\u2019t think too much of it.</p><br/><p>However, the people in the broadcast room were boiling up.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck, Master Lin is really sinister. Once he drinks and becomes merry, he starts saying these polite words.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck. Only this kind of people can become big shots. If it was me, I would be able to control the whole world.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShh, be quiet. Keep watching. I feel that something incredible is about to happen.\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

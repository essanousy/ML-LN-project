The donated money will be returned to their respective accounts.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018After the surgical doctors in the hospital saw Master Lin\u2019s operation, they have all requested for leaves.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Let us walk into the world of doctors to see what Master Lin has done to them.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018A true lucky star. It turns out that Master Lin likes to appear and disappear unpredictably.\u2019</p><br/><p>The netizens had long gotten used to such news. After all, that was just how Master Lin was.</p><br/><p>Sometimes, he would suddenly appear at a hospital to give someone a huge pleasant surprise.</p><br/><p>\u201cActually, I honestly think that everyone shouldn\u2019t flame Master Lin anymore in the future. This person is genuinely good. The things he does are always righteous.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. I\u2019ve never flamed him before. Even if other people are flaming him, I would never follow along.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if Master Lin does something horrible, I would automatically assume that it\u2019s because he\u2019s too awesome that someone drugged him and made him do it. He would never do anything horrible by his own will.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c^This is a true understanding fan. We should all be like that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBunch of idiots. You\u2019re saying that he\u2019s genuinely good? If his medical skills are so awesome, why doesn\u2019t he help other people by treating their illnesses? Aren\u2019t other people suffering as well?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSigh, there are idiots every year but this year, there are especially many. ^You should stop talking. Once you talk, I can tell that you\u2019re a hater.\u201d</p><br/><p>The various large hospitals all envied that hospital. They hadn\u2019t thought that the godly doctor, Master Lin, would go there and even perform an operation in the hospital.</p><br/><p>This Master Lin was a super powerful advertisement. Whichever hospital he went to would explode in popularity.</p><br/><p>But as of now, there had been no hospital that had been able to successfully invite Master Lin over.</p><br/><p>Many hospitals had calculated this before. If any hospital could invite Master Lin to join them, that hospital would definitely become the most popular hospital in the country.</p><br/><p>After all, it would have the godly doctor with them. Who wouldn\u2019t know about that?</p><br/><p>At the entrance of the shop, the surrounding shop owners had gathered.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Boss, this was pretty good!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Boss, take a look at my body. I\u2019ve been having a hip ache recently.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan glanced over. \u201cDon\u2019t you have any idea why it\u2019s aching? You\u2019re already close to fifty and you still treat your body as if you were a young man.\u201d</p><br/><p>When he said this, the crowd roared with laughter.</p><br/><p>\u201cEven so, you can\u2019t say it so directly. I have my pride too.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shook his head. Right now, all he had to do was think things through and he would know what to do.</p><br/><p>Besides his task, what else was there?</p><br/><p>The angling knowledge was good. It could give him many fun things. However, it was too time-consuming. He was now busy completing his task, how could he waste his time on angling?</p><br/><p>Perhaps in the future, when things settled down, he would be able to fish every day.</p><br/><p>In the afternoon, Lin Fan drove his car and went out to roam around. He wanted to try his best to complete the task soon.</p><br/><p>At that moment, he passed by a bank and realized that an old man was sitting at the entrance of the bank. No matter what the surrounding staff said, he wouldn\u2019t budge.</p><br/><p>Moreover, there were many people standing around and spectating.</p><br/><p>Rong Mao bank.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan stopped his car by the road. He didn\u2019t know what was going on, so he went forward curiously. Before he reached the scene, he could already hear the noise.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy money was deposited in your bank. Why can\u2019t I withdraw it? Where have you put my money?\u201d</p><br/><p>It was very noisy. Many townsfolk had surrounded them to spectate the scene. Lin Fan stood there as well, listening to the townsfolk\u2019s discussion.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis old uncle deposited one million dollars in the bank. Now, this money got loaned to a certain start-up. And the procedure has already been settled too. But this old uncle had never done this procedure.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s strange. Then how was it done?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho knows? Nowadays, banks have all these procedures that really can give you a headache.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen they won\u2019t return the money to the old uncle now?\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, a middle-aged lady dressed in the bank working attire pointed at the old uncle. \u201cHurry up and leave. This was done by yourself. The procedures have all been completed.\u201d</p><br/><p>When the old uncle heard this, he patted the photocopied documents in his hands. \u201cHow is that possible? Look at this. When did I ever agree to this? I have to wait thirty years to get it back? How can I wait so long?\u201d</p><br/><p>The spectators all shook their heads upon hearing that.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn. This is one of those new programs. It has to be deposited for thirty years before it can be withdrawn.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey\u2019re just tricking people. But I feel like this old uncle\u2019s situation is helpless. If he wants to go against Rong Mao Bank, he would have to be very capable.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. Sigh. Nowadays, money isn\u2019t safe no matter where you put it. I previously heard that a lady deposited several tens of thousands but it disappeared all of a sudden. The bank said that they didn\u2019t know where it went. Isn\u2019t that strange? The money had been deposited with them but they actually didn\u2019t know where it went.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard about that. In the end, after the big ruckus, there was no conclusion, was there?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s nothing. I used my credit card a long time ago and I forgot to pay one dollar. After many years, I actually received a call telling me that I have to pay tens of thousands. I was bewildered. I don\u2019t even use credit cards anymore, how could I owe so much?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen how did you resolve it in the end?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI went to court. The court said that the bank was the disadvantaged party and I had to pay. I just admitted that I was unlucky.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe. \u2018Disadvantaged party\u2019. What a way to put it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. They didn\u2019t tell me that they were short of one dollar. When it reached tens of thousands, then they call me to repay the money. It was even after so many years. Even a tycoon would be able to feel the pain of losing that money. If the bank had waited a few more decades to call me, that one dollar might have turned into millions.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan listened from the side and started to understand some things.</p><br/><p>At that moment, that woman was getting rough. She felt that the old uncle was affecting them too much by staying at their entrance. She called two security guards over to carry the old uncle away.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you doing? Let go of me!\u201d The two security guards came over and lifted him from his arms and legs and were about to carry him away. That old uncle struggled but, at his age, how could he break free from these two young men?</p><br/><p>The middle-aged lady watched this old man with a glimmer of fury in her eyes. In her heart, she mumbled to herself. <em>D*mned old man. Can\u2019t you see where this place is before coming to cause a ruckus?</em></p><br/><p>They were a private bank. They didn\u2019t care about all this.</p><br/><p>\u201cStop.\u201d Lin Fan stepped out. He felt that, although this had nothing to do with him, he had to condemn it.</p>\n</div>"}

It had been a long while since he last touched a computer.</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian sat at the side with his eyes fixated on Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>\u201cChief Liu, what are you staring at me for?\u201d Lin Fan asked curiously. Then, he added softly, \u201cCould it be that you\u2019re afraid I might do something bad?\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian immediately waved his hand. \u201cNo, definitely not. I have immense trust in you, Master Lin. I trust that Master Lin wouldn\u2019t use the computer to do anything else. We just have to find those despicable people, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded very seriously. He hadn\u2019t expected that Liu Xiao Tian would be worried about this. He wanted to say that there was no need to worry at all.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was a man of integrity. If he said he wouldn\u2019t touch a computer, he definitely wouldn\u2019t touch a computer.</p><br/><p>However, this was a special case. He couldn\u2019t watch the budding flowers of his country get harmed by those people.</p><br/><p>Although he didn\u2019t know those budding flowers personally, he was willing to be their protector in order for them to grow and flourish.</p><br/><p>\u201cChief Liu, just watch. I\u2019m a man of integrity.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, Lin Fan\u2019s fingers started moving as they rained down on the keyboard. Those fingers became a blur in Liu Xiao Tian\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, slow down, slow down. I\u2019m getting dizzy.\u201d Liu Xiao Tian was in a daze. Those fingers are too fast. Isn\u2019t he afraid of his fingers cramping up? Liu Xiao Tian couldn\u2019t see clearly at all.</p><br/><p>However, Master Lin was completely immersed in it. Stopping was not an option. This was the only way that he could utilize his true abilities.</p><br/><p>He had to attack the keyboard at high speeds in order to find those criminals.</p><br/><p>Protecting the budding flowers of the nation was everyone\u2019s responsibility.</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian saw that Master Lin\u2019s expression was quite serious, so he just sat there silently. His eyes remained steadily on the screen. But even so, he couldn\u2019t quite understand what was going on.</p><br/><p>QQ was being attacked.</p><br/><p>The technicians at the company had been doing a check, but suddenly, they realized that there was a problem. Someone was hacking into the website violently.</p><br/><p>To Lin Fan, there was no need to hide. There was no need at all. He had to hack it as maniacally as possible.</p><br/><p>\u201cSh*t! It\u2019s bad. Someone has hacked into our back-end.\u201d</p><br/><p>One of the technicians started pressing his keyboard maniacally as well, but it was useless. The opposition was too strong. The technicians were so scared that they were about to p*ss themselves.</p><br/><p>Those technicians who had been eating were stunned when they heard this. Who would be so wild?</p><br/><p>Then, they quickly put down their food and rushed over. If something were to happen, they would lose their jobs.</p><br/><p>However, when everyone joined in, something terrifying happened. The opposition completely ignored them. Even though they were defending, it didn\u2019t even take a second for the opposition to blow past their defense.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is going on? Since when was there such an expert in the country?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah! Our captain has been to international competitions, and he has even been a champion before. Even if his security skills aren\u2019t the best in the world, he\u2019s definitely in the top ten.</p><br/><p>The technicians were all dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>At that moment, the captain\u2019s hands stopped moving. \u201cThat\u2019s enough, everyone. Just stop.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. Even though the opposition is strong, we can\u2019t just let him in. If something goes wrong, we won\u2019t be able to bear the consequences.\u201d</p><br/><p>The captain took out a cigarette and lit it up silently. \u201cThe attacker is at Shanghai\u2019s police station. There\u2019s no need to do anything. There\u2019s only one man on this planet who can completely overwhelm us.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>When everyone heard it, they were instantly stunned.</p><br/><p>The captain sucked in the smoke. \u201cMaster Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn. It can\u2019t be. Didn\u2019t Master Lin get banned from using computers? How could he be using a computer?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. I know what happened back then. Master Lin is really incredible. Before him, all the defenses in the world are as thin as paper. No one can stop him.\u201d</p><br/><p>The captain said, \u201cThis is from the police station. They must be investigating something. We can all stop. Moreover, it\u2019s clear that Master Lin is searching for someone\u2019s IP.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even if he used all his power, he wouldn\u2019t be able to do anything. That\u2019s why he completely gave up.</p><br/><p>At the police station!</p><br/><p><em>Clatter</em></p><br/><p>Lin Fan tapped the enter key. \u201cIt\u2019s done. I\u2019ve found their address. We don\u2019t need to get in touch with any foreign police. These criminals are in Shanghai. Hurry up and get your men. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian was stunned. Then, he said, \u201cYou found them just like that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan responded, \u201cWhat did you expect?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s just that this speed is a little shocking,\u201d said Liu Xiao Tian. He was a computer idiot. How could he understand all this?</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. \u201cOf course it\u2019s fast. Did you think this Internet Era was a joke? Even if you scold someone on the Internet, that person would be able to find you if he wanted to. Don\u2019t you know that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian replied, \u201cOf course I know. This is a police station. We know that bank accounts, phone calls, room bookings, and just about anything can be found it you really want to find it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSince you know, let\u2019s go then. We have to catch them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian couldn\u2019t wait any longer. Since Master Lin had found the criminals, they had to go and arrest them at once.</p><br/><p>People these days were f*cking lowly. They would do all kinds of sinister things.</p><br/><p>Fraudsters\u2019 tactics had gotten more complicated and they had become more cautious. Although the times were progressing, it seemed as if people were becoming less wise.</p><br/><p>If it had been a thirteen-year-old girl from the olden days, she would have known not to follow others blindly, much less do it to get pregnant and retaliate against her family.</p><br/><p>What kind of IQ must one have to have such thoughts?</p><br/><p>Lin Fan and Liu Xiao Tian rushed out. Meanwhile, the policemen who were waiting outside had no idea how things had developed.</p><br/><p>However, Yang Dong had already confessed everything.</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan and Liu Xiao Tian came out, Yang Dong raised his head as well. He looked at Lin Fan as if he was begging Lin Fan to let him go.</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian said, \u201cGet me some men. We\u2019re going to catch the culprits.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes sir.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cYou guys have to interrogate this guy thoroughly. He\u2019s not a first-time offender.\u201d</p><br/><p>When he said this, Yang Dong was stunned.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t malign me.\u201d How could he reveal his past? If he were to reveal it, he would be done for.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright. You\u2019re still not honest, are you? Tell me. How many times have you done it already?\u201d The policeman interrogated him with a stern tone. He hadn\u2019t expected this guy to be so slippery.</p><br/><p>In the police car, the policemen asked, \u201cHas the culprits\u2019 location been found?\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian replied, \u201cYes, we\u2019ve found it. It was all thanks to Master Lin. His hacking skills are the real deal. Just incredible.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s just a small matter.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

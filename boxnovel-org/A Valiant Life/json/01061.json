They were all wondering what was going on with this Rong Mao.</p><br/><p>In the past, they had seen similar news on the Internet before but all those only appeared for a while and would never reach any conclusion.</p><br/><p>The reporters would stop reporting about those incidents and they probably just let the citizens deal with the issues themselves.</p><br/><p>But this time, it was different. Master Lin had actually gotten involved and this incident had drawn the attention of the public. They all wanted to know how this incident matter would be resolved or if the victim would just have to accept this misfortune.</p><br/><p>At the entrance of Rong Mao.</p><br/><p>When Director Jin reached, he realized that there was quite a number of people outside. Then, he pulled Wang Xiu over to ask her what was going on. But when he found out that these townsfolk had seen the news and come here to see the situation, he was completely dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>Outside, a group of spectators was murmuring amongst themselves.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is the bank that was on the news, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. This is the place that was mentioned on the news. I wonder when Master Lin will arrive and how this problem will be resolved in the end.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho knows? But with Master Lin involved, I feel that they will definitely have to give an answer. And the staff here already said yesterday that they would definitely give an answer today.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSigh. It\u2019s lucky that Master Lin is involved. But in my opinion, this problem is really difficult to resolve.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMmm, that\u2019s true. I think so as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, the old man arrived. When he arrived, Director Jin\u2019s lit up as he hurried over.</p><br/><p>\u201cOld man, come, come. The matter has already been settled for you. We\u2019ll just transfer the money over to your card now, okay?\u201d Director Jin was thinking of just transferring the money over, then quickly sending the old man off.</p><br/><p>If he did that, then even if Master Lin and the reporters come, he could say that he had already transferred the money over and the matter was settled.</p><br/><p>But something unexpected happened.</p><br/><p>The old man immediately shook his head. \u201cNo. I have to wait for that youngster from yesterday to come. Before he comes, I won\u2019t go in.\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Jin became anxious. \u201cOld man, this is your money. This is about you. Why do you have to wait for him?\u201d</p><br/><p>Right now, Director Jin\u2019s attitude was very polite. It was completely different from before.</p><br/><p>The old man glanced at Director Jin. \u201cDon\u2019t think that I\u2019m easy to trick because I\u2019m old. I\u2019m not stupid. My eyes aren\u2019t able to see clearly anymore. Who knows what you\u2019ll make me sign? No. I have to wait for that youngster to come.\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Jin almost puked blood. He went next to the old man as if he was the old man\u2019s grandson. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I definitely won\u2019t make you sign anything. Really. Just come in with me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo,\u201d said the old man firmly. Then, he sat down at the side of the steps as he waited for the youngster from yesterday.</p><br/><p>At that moment, cars arrived one by one. The reporters had come here in a hurry. They had to give yesterday\u2019s news a conclusion.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, Master Lin isn\u2019t here yet. We have to wait.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLook. Isn\u2019t that Director Jin? What is he doing pestering the old man? Let\u2019s go over there and see. This old man is easily lied to. We can\u2019t let him get tricked.\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporters started talking amongst themselves. Then, they rushed over to that side.</p><br/><p>\u201cDirector Jin, may I ask what you were saying to the old man?\u201d asked the reporters.</p><br/><p>When Director Jin saw that the reporters had come, he was startled. \u201cNothing, nothing.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, a sedan stopped by the roadside.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan had finished selling his scallion pancakes and rushed down here. When he reached the scene, he realized that everyone was already here. It seemed that he was the latest. He smiled and said, \u201cSorry, I\u2019m late.\u201d</p><br/><p>The old man saw Lin Fan and immediately stood up. He then ran over to Lin Fan and said, \u201cYoungster, you\u2019re here. I was waiting for you. I can\u2019t trust anyone else.\u201d</p><br/><p>Being trusted by someone else felt pretty good. Since this old man trusted him now, Lin Fan felt like he had nothing more to say. And when he saw all these people spectating, he felt that the news had really been useful. It had actually drawn the attention of so many people.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, can this matter be resolved today?\u201d amongst the crowd, a man raised his voice and asked. He was particularly concerned about this matter. When he read about it on the news, he felt that there was definitely something shady going on.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt should be,\u201d replied Lin Fan with a smile.</p><br/><p>Director Jin went forward. \u201cMaster Lin, let\u2019s go in and talk.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d Lin Fan nodded. He wanted to see today how this matter was going to be resolved.</p><br/><p>When the reached the lobby, Director Jin said with a smile, \u201cMaster Lin, let\u2019s go to the office. We won\u2019t be disturbed there.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved his hand. \u201cNo need. Let\u2019s just talk here. There are so many reporters. The office would be too cramped.\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Jin felt helpless. His intention had been to minimize the impact, so he didn\u2019t want to let other people know about this. However, Master Lin wasn\u2019t giving him the chance to do that at all. Master Lin was insistent on talking in the lobby and that left him with no choice.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow\u2019s the situation?\u201d asked Lin Fan. \u201cYou have the video already, right? The employee should be back at work already.\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporters were conducting interviews all around. Today, they had come with Master Lin to get a clear idea about the situation.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, the old man was at the side, not saying a single word. It was as if he was leaving all his matters to this youngster as he quietly awaited the outcome.</p><br/><p>Director Jin smiled. \u201cMaster Lin, this matter has already been settled. Yesterday, I had the staff stay back for a meeting and we also conducted a chat. We realized that there has been a lapse in our work.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded as if urging him to carry on.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis was caused by a mistake from one of the staff members and we are all ashamed. This was due to negligence in our work.\u201d director Jin had thought about it the whole night. According to the leader\u2019s intentions, he had thought of this plan.</p><br/><p>The plan was to blame it on a work mistake. As for any other excuses, he had none.</p><br/><p>\u201cMistake?\u201d questioned Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, it was a mistake. A mistake in our work.\u201d Director Jin mustered a smile. Regardless of whether Master Lin believed it or not, he had already made himself believe it.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the reporters. \u201cDo you all believe this?\u201d</p><br/><p>One of the reporters said, \u201cAlthough my IQ isn\u2019t too high, I can\u2019t be satisfied with such an explanation. I don\u2019t believe it.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Director Jin heard that, he cursed in his heart. <em>What the heck is this reporter doing? Just take your photos and don\u2019t f*cking interrupt. </em>But at that moment, he could only smile awkwardly. He didn\u2019t say anything at all.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan had not expected that, in the end, Director Jin would just brush it off by calling it a mistake.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright. You say that it\u2019s a mistake. But who signed that signature? You can\u2019t possibly mistakenly make someone forge a signature.\u201d</p><br/><p><em>Director Jin felt as if his throat was stifled. If you ask me, who the f*ck do I ask?</em></p></div>\n</div>"}

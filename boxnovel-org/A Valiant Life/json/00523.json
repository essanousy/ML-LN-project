However, this was a risky move, as at the end of the day when all the records were checked, it would definitely be found out by a bank worker. So, Lin Fan had to finish everything and get out within twenty-four hours.</p><br/><p>The bank server had five checkpoints of defense against hackers, but for Lin Fan, it was just child\u2019s play.</p><br/><p>The first checkpoint was a firewall, the second was ips encryption. The third was waf encryption and the fourth was a web protocol. The final line of defense was the database server.</p><br/><p>For any other hacker, getting past the five checkpoints was something of an impossible feat. For Lin Fan whose hands were skilled, it was like taking candy from a baby.</p><br/><p>The guys which he had met just now had enough balls to go up against him. Righteous Fan was doing his thing and those guys still dared to go against him. If he hadn\u2019t shown them who was boss and hadn\u2019t taught them their lesson, it wouldn\u2019t be right.</p><br/><p>Against other hackers, the group of guys who had tried to stop Lin Fan would have a fighting chance, but to Lin Fan, they were nothing.</p><br/><p>On Weibo.</p><br/><p>The activity on Weibo was more than usual, with the hacking incident trending.</p><br/><p>Numerous netizens were paying attention to Master Lin\u2019s Weibo page, shocked and baffled. Some didn\u2019t dare to believe what they were witnessing.</p><br/><p>This had never happened in Weibo history before.</p><br/><p>A whole train of personal information of all the scammers from before had been posted on Master Lin\u2019s Weibo, and every single detail was accurate and precise.</p><br/><p>It included everything. Their old addresses, their new addresses\u2026it was scary beyond belief.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn, what is this name list about?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh? These guys also hacked into the bank servers, met Master Lin and got kicked out of the server. Now Master Lin got their names and posted them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWait a minute? I think I found out some bad news.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat thing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you guys see? The job description of the guys who got kicked out of the server by Master Lin?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck? It\u2019s the National Internet Safety Department. Those guys work there. So what is the meaning of this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI understand. This is definitely because Master Lin hacked into the bank servers, causing the Internet Safety Department to intervene. Master Lin didn\u2019t realise who they were and thought that they were other hackers who were trying to destroy the back server, so he immediately screwed them and kicked them out of the server. That\u2019s why\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo this is a huge misunderstanding?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe good guys got labelled by Master Lin as intruders and they got annihilated. All their personal information is online as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid that this is the only interpretation of the information right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTerrifying! This is just too terrifying!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI would like to know if Master Lin actually knows about this.\u201d</p><br/><p>The discussion on the Internet was intense. For most people, they had never seen this happen before.</p><br/><p>Even if the bank servers were hacked, the news would be suppressed. The journalists would not report the news for fear of widespread paranoia.</p><br/><p>But this time, with Lin Fans quirky character, he did everything justly and honourably, accounting for his every action on Weibo.</p><br/><p>Everyone was blowing up.</p><br/><p>This was just provoking so many people.</p><br/><p>Some people just enjoyed looking at the world burn.</p><br/><p>Every part of the country.</p><br/><p>The scammers had been well hidden within society for quite some time. Even if you saw their faces, you wouldn\u2019t know that they were scammers. But after Lin Fan\u2019s one act, all the scammers who were still active, going about cheating people, were all weeded out.</p><br/><p>Although it was a huge collective effort, it had to be done to make life more pleasant.</p><br/><p>A young man was walking down the street. He was handsome, and his arms were wrapped around another girl. The girl thought that her boyfriend was just the best. Not only did he have money, he was generous and he always spent his time with her in the day. Where could one find such a boyfriend?</p><br/><p>The young man enjoyed his life. There were too many idiots in society who had too much money and were easily cheated. Now that he had a girlfriend, he felt more fulfilled than ever.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t move!\u201d</p><br/><p>At that instant, a group of police officers ran up to him, pinning the young man to the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you guys doing? Who are you guys?\u201d the girl shrieked out loud.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe are police officers,\u201d the policemen pinned him to the ground. \u201cYou are suspected of conducting illegal scams. Please follow us.\u201d</p><br/><p>The young man was in a daze after hearing what the policemen just said, but he refused to be honest. \u201cYou guys got it wrong. Since when have I ever cheated anyone? What proof do you have?\u201d</p><br/><p>One of the police officers took out their phones and opened Weibo. \u201cLook, this is all the evidence that we need. This is your picture and the identification is yours, right? And all these bank transactions are yours too, right? You have been busted by Master Lin and the evidence is overwhelming, so there is no use resisting.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho the f*ck is Master Lin? I don\u2019t know who he is. You guys can\u2019t arrest me! I didn\u2019t do anything wrong, \u201d the young man exclaimed.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if you did or didn\u2019t. Please follow us to the police station,\u201d the police officer said, directing the young man to the police car.</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung lady, this young man is suspected of conducting scams. If you want to know a little more, you can go and see Master Lin\u2019s Weibo page. Everything you need to know is over there,\u201d one of the female police officers said.</p><br/><p>The young lady froze on the spot, not knowing what to do. After snapping out of it, she opened her Weibo and looked for Master Lin. After seeing what Master Lin had posted, she was completely stunned.</p><br/><p>This happened throughout the whole nation.</p><br/><p>There were some scammers who paid close attention to Weibo. After they saw their information being posted online, they became flabbergasted.</p><br/><p>What on earth was going on? All of them did their best to stay low-profile. How did they get exposed? This was completely illogical.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t that they hadn\u2019t thought of running, but since they had scammed so much money, they would definitely become wanted and they would definitely have trouble hiding after that.</p><br/><p>Brother.</p><br/><p>F*cking Master Lin, where the hell did you even come From? This is unforgivable.</p><br/><p>I\u2019ll submit to you. I\u2019ll give myself up now. You got me this time.</p><br/><p>This was happening throughout the whole nation.</p><br/><p>Many police stations could barely handle the load.</p><br/><p>One by one, the scammers all started streaming in, surrendering themselves. All the police officers were puzzled since they still didn\u2019t know what was going online. All they knew was that Weibo was getting really popular that day, but the online news agencies hadn\u2019t reported the news yet.</p><br/><p>If the scammers hadn\u2019t given themselves up, the only other way was that they would be found and arrested.</p><br/><p>Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan paused what he was doing.</p><br/><p>He silently lit up a cigarette and took a deep puff, his vision fixed towards the distance.</p><br/><p>This case had been handled beautifully.</p><br/><p>Although there were still some fish which escaped the net, he was satisfied with his results.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Lin\u2026\u201d Zhao Zhong Yang said, looking worried. Wu You Lan wanted to say something but decided not to. She didn\u2019t feel right on the inside.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, just let me relax for awhile\u2026\u201d Lin Fan waved them away.</p><br/><p>Police car sirens filled the air.</p><br/><p>The people who were in Cloud Street all were stunned after hearing the sounds of the police sirens. They didn\u2019t know what had happened which warranted so many police cars.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan took the opportunity to access his Weibo.</p><br/><p>\u201cI won\u2019t be with you guys anymore, but my legend lives on. The police officers are here and I\u2019ll be arrested, so I\u2019ll see you guys on the other side!\u201d</p><br/><p>After sending that post, Lin Fan silently turned off his computer.</p><br/><p>A police officer brashly ran forward and shouted for the rest to follow. He didn\u2019t know anything other than the fact that they were here to catch a huge criminal.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s him. Get him!\u201d he shouted, after seeing Master Lin.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you insane? Stand aside!\u201d Liu Xiao Tian breathed him as he got off his car.</p><br/><p>Walking into the shop.</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian heaved a sigh of helplessness. \u201cWe can\u2019t help you much. The higher ups have spoken. We\u2019ve got to bring you in.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded his head. \u201cI understand.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian nodded back. \u201cThe guys from the Internet Safety Department are here. They are going to bring your computer away.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSure, no problem. But this computer is brand new, so please don\u2019t destroy it. Also, I\u2019ve got a few movies downloaded inside which I haven\u2019t watched yet. If they delete it, I won\u2019t let them go,\u201d Lin Fan nodded his head in agreement.</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian smiled, his face showing a hint of helplessness.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Lin\u2026\u201d Wu You Lan stood at one side, her face full of worry.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo problem. I wouldn\u2019t have been able to hide anyway,\u201d Lin Fan waved her away.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan didn\u2019t understand what Lin Fan meant by hiding, but seeing Lin Fan being taken in, she didn\u2019t know what else to do.</p><br/><p>Just at this moment, a commotion arose outside.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck, what do you police officers want with him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Little Boss, we are here to save you\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck, if you guys want to bring Little Boss in, you guys can keep on dreaming.\u201d</p><br/><p>All the shop owners of Cloud Street gathered, adamant about their case. They didn\u2019t know what was going on, but one thing was for sure: the police officers will not arrest Little Boss.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked a little helpless. \u201cSigh, it can\u2019t be helped. I\u2019m just too welcome over here. Come let me handle this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, but you don\u2019t have to worry. I\u2019ve discussed this with the bureau chief. We will protect you as much as we can.\u201d Liu Xiao Tian shook his head, saying.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need. I\u2019ve already found my support, and it is more valiant than anything else. It is more than adequate.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian was puzzled, but he replied positively. \u201cAdequate?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYep,\u201d Lin Fan nodded.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p></div>\n</div>"}

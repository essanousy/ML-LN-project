A shred of calmness appeared on his panic-stricken face.</p><br/><p>Ou Xing Yun, who had four fingers missing, asked eagerly, \u201cDid Master Lin agree to come?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye Zhen Ming nodded, \u201cHe agreed and he\u2019ll be coming tomorrow. If even Master Lin can\u2019t do anything, then nothing can be done.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ou Xing Yun nodded. He appeared to feel very helpless. During this period of time, they had been tormented. They had been tortured so much by that man that they were close to collapsing.</p><br/><p>When someone cheated, with their sharp eyes and experience, there was no way they wouldn\u2019t be able to see through it.</p><br/><p>However, they had observed that man for so many days now. They hadn\u2019t missed a single card but they could not see anything wrong at all. To them, this was impossible.</p><br/><p>The only other possibility was that the man did not cheat.</p><br/><p>But was that even possible?</p><br/><p>How could one\u2019s luck be so good? Perhaps that man\u2019s technique was so brilliant that even they could not see through it.</p><br/><p>*thud thud*</p><br/><p>A staff member entered. \u201cMr. Ye, Mr. Ou, that man is here again.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two of them exchanged looks of frustration. All they could do was go down to take a look.</p><br/><p>In the casino.</p><br/><p>That middle-aged man was casually and coolly sitting there. A crowd had gathered around. During this period of time, everyone had realized that this man was a gambling god. As long as they followed him, they would not lose. He was causing the casino to fall apart.</p><br/><p>But even so, the casino could not close its doors to him because that would mean that they could not afford to lose. It would greatly impact their business and reputation.</p><br/><p>Ye Zhen Ming and Ou Xing Yun arrived.</p><br/><p>The dealer, who was under a lot of pressure, was drenched in sweat. He immediately moved aside. In the face of that middle-aged man, he was under a lot of stress. Even his hands were trembling.</p><br/><p>\u201cMr. Zhang, you\u2019ve already won quite a lot in these few days. You should know how to be content,\u201d said Ye Zhen Ming. However, there was a slight tremor in his tone as well. It was clear that in these few days, he had been overwhelmed by the man\u2019s imposing manner.</p><br/><p>The middle-aged man was playing around with his chips as he couldn\u2019t help but laugh, \u201cCould it be that even Mr. Yun\u2019s casino cannot afford to lose so much? If that\u2019s the case, then it would be a shame. I think it\u2019d be best for it to close down soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye Zhen Ming had a look of fury on his face but he was at his wit\u2019s end. There were so many people around, what could he possibly do?</p><br/><p>Moreover, this man was very well-liked by the other guests. At this moment, these guests were shouting from the side as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah! If you can\u2019t afford to lose, then don\u2019t even open the casino.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t even cheat, why isn\u2019t he allowed to win? Are you the only ones allowed to win?\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, a loud bellow rang out.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho said that the Yun casino can\u2019t afford to lose?\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone looked over and couldn\u2019t help but gasp.</p><br/><p>What a beautiful woman.</p><br/><p>Almost like a siren.</p><br/><p>\u201cLady Yun.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGreetings, Lady Yun.\u201d</p><br/><p>When the staff saw that she had come, they all greeted her courteously.</p><br/><p>This was the Yun family\u2019s little princess and also their famous successor who had always been responsible for the casino. Although she was only twenty-one, she had been regarded as a genius since young and had received numerous degrees.</p><br/><p>After she returned, she took over the casino business. What shocked everyone was that Lady Yun\u2019s gambling skills were actually amazing.</p><br/><p>But if you thought about it, it was understandable. The Yun family had opened this casino in Haojiang and it had many experts under its banner. And naturally, it wasn\u2019t an issue for Lady Yun to study skills and techniques under them.</p><br/><p>At 1.75m tall and wearing high heels, the crowd of men felt suppressed by her.</p><br/><p>Some of the men who were shorter even felt a little ashamed as they stood before her.</p><br/><p>Ye Zhen Ming walked over. \u201cLady Yun, this man\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yun Xue Yao raised her hand to interrupt. Then, she looked at them and said, \u201cThe Yun family\u2019s business is to let everyone play happily. Winning and losing is a law. Winning means that one is capable. Losing means that one has bad luck. For this Mister to win so much, it means that he is capable.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Yuan smiled, \u201cThey say that those with big boobs have no brains. I see that Lady Yun is an exception. Since Lady Yun has come, I shan\u2019t gamble anymore today. I wonder if Lady Yun will have the time for a gamble tomorrow, right at this place.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye Zhen Ming\u2019s brows furrowed. \u201cLady Yun, this\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yun Xue Yao didn\u2019t say much. She just replied swiftly, \u201cAlright, I\u2019ll accompany you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Yuan stood up to leave. \u201cOkay. Tomorrow, I shall compete against the genius of the Yun family. But I wonder if there will be anything on the line.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye Zhen Ming was infuriated. \u201cMr. Zhang, don\u2019t be ridiculous.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha,\u201d Zhang Yuan laughed, \u201cThat\u2019s fine too. Since she knows she\u2019ll lose, Lady Yun wouldn\u2019t dare to put anything at stake. Forget it, forget it. Just come on time tomorrow.\u201d</p><br/><p>When the other gamblers saw that the guru had left, they became anxious. They had wanted to follow the guru and win some money. Now that the guru had left, how would they win? However, the itch to gamble rose up in their hearts again. Then, they gradually dispersed and joined in at various gambling tables.</p><br/><p>In the face of the young but beautifully moving Lady Yun, Ye Zhen Ming was also a little anxious. However, he steadied himself and said, \u201cLady Yun, you shouldn\u2019t have agreed with him. His gambling skills and superb.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yun Xue Yao said, \u201cI know that but it\u2019s better to lose to him than to lose my face. How is the investigation going? Have you found any problems?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye Zhen Ming shook his head, \u201cNo, not a single hint. However, I\u2019ve invited an expert. Tomorrow, we\u2019ll definitely be able to discover his cheating techniques.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yun Xue Yao didn\u2019t think much of the expert. \u201cRelying on oneself is better than relying on others. Tomorrow, I will gamble with that man. You guys look closely. If you find any problems at all, bring him down immediately.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood.\u201d Ye Zhen Ming nodded.</p><br/><p>Haojiang was the heaven of gambling. Experts from around the world would come here to win money. However, the checks here were very strict and many cheaters would get caught on the spot.</p><br/><p>Eventually, those cheaters would be handed over to the police. Over here, cheating was against the law and those who cheated would be prosecuted.</p><br/><p>The next day!</p><br/><p>Lin Fan had not packed much. He just carried his backpack with his clothes inside. After all, he would only be there for a few days. There was no need to bring too much.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian had already found out the previous day that Lin Fan would be going to Haojiang. Naturally, he had begged for his boss to bring him along to see the world together.</p><br/><p>However, he had been instantly rejected by Lin Fan. Lin Fan was not going there to play and he would be back in one or two days at most. He had no idea what would happen if he brought Fraud Tian along, so he rejected him.</p><br/><p>At the airport.</p><br/><p>He boarded the plane</p><br/><p>This was Lin Fan\u2019s first time to Haojiang. Although he was going there to help Ye Zhen Ming, he saw it as a tour.</p><br/><p>Then, the air stewardess notified the passengers that they had reached Haojiang.</p><br/><p>Standing in the airport, Lin Fan found the exit. Then, he dialed Ye Zhen Ming\u2019s number. After confirming his bearings, Lin Fan headed towards his destination.</p><br/><p>Outside the airport, Ye Zhen Ming\u2019s saw Lin Fan and raised his hand. \u201cMaster Lin, over here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan heard his voice and looked over. Then, he smiled, \u201cHaojiang is really a pretty good place.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye Zhen Ming chuckled. \u201cTeacher Lin, most people who come here are here to gamble. However, the environment is pretty good indeed. Please, follow me.\u201d</p><br/><p>In the car.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the scenery outside as he said, \u201cTeacher Ye, when did you come to Haojiang?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye Zhen Ming said, \u201cI only came over after I was notified. I\u2019ve been idling over there and not making any developments these few days. I can only leave when this matter is over.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher Lin, this matter is urgent. The Yun family\u2019s lady is going head to head with that man right now. We have to hurry over and prevent anything bad from happening,\u201d said Ye Zhen Ming.</p><br/><p>\u201cYun family? I always see it on the news. It\u2019s a very big clan in Haojiang.\u201d Although Lin Fan wasn\u2019t very knowledgeable about it, he often saw it on the news and he knew about it.</p><br/><p>Ye Zhen Ming nodded, \u201cMmm, the Yun family has a very strong presence in Haojiang. This Lady is the Yun family\u2019s youngest princess and she\u2019s very powerful. The casino I work in is managed by her.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Lin Fan nodded and didn\u2019t ask more. There was no point in asking too much. After all, it had nothing to do with him.</p></div>\n</div>"}

It was just made of a row of wooden blocks, and the height of the fence was about half the height of a human. The area beside it was used to plant crops. Also, the building was barely visible due to the lack of light in the night. However, Lin Fan\u2019s vision was not affected by that. He could still see clearly.</p><br/><p>It was a house held together by mud and it looked really old and fragile.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, bring me inside to take a look.\u201d Lin Fan carried the little girl out of the car and spoke to Wang Qin.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan had asked her about many things in the car and had found out more about her family.</p><br/><p>To others, it might seem like a situation that was impossible to resolve. However, it was not difficult to him at all. He thought that it was a pretty simple task.</p><br/><p>In a distance, a man walked towards them. When he saw car lights shining outside Wang Qin\u2019s house, he was curious about what was happening. After all, who would come over at such a late hour?</p><br/><p>However, when he saw that a man carried the little girl into the house, his face changed. He held his breath and spied on them.</p><br/><p>\u201cWang Qin is having an affair. Furthermore, she made it so obvious. Her husband hasn\u2019t even died yet.\u201d</p><br/><p>The man mumbled to himself furiously. Then, when he saw the door was closed, he quickly ran over. He looked at the car and hesitated for a moment before running away.</p><br/><p>He wanted to tell people about Wang Qin bringing a man to her house.</p><br/><p>In the house.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan felt that the house was a little humid. It was apparent that it rained for the past few days which caused the interior of the house to be damp and reek of a musky smell.</p><br/><p>A wooden plank was used as a bed and a man was lying down on it. With the help of the light, he could see that this man was pale and skinny.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, this is my husband, Zhou Zhuang. He used to work in the city, but he fell from the roof and has been in a coma since then. I am unable to pay for the costly medical fees, and if my child were to stick with us, she would be suffering\u2026\u201d she said as she started to cry.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t cry. Let me have a look at him.\u201d Lin Fan went forward and felt the pulse of Zhou Zhuang which was rather weak. Then, he added, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, it\u2019s not a big problem. I can help him become healthy again.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was the furthest place away from home that he had ever gone to treat a patient. However, he felt that it was worth it to help the family of three be reunited again.</p><br/><p>Outside.</p><br/><p>The man who saw Wang Qin bringing another man home went to every house in the village.</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone, wake up! Wang Qin brought a man home. She must be having an affair while her Husband is in a coma.\u201d</p><br/><p>After saying that, the lights of each house started to light up. Everyone was so shocked that they woke up.</p><br/><p>What?</p><br/><p>Wang Qin was having an affair? How could it be?</p><br/><p>They knew that Wang Qin really loved her husband. She had never given up on him for the past year. Now that she suddenly brought someone home, things seemed unbelievable.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you lying?\u201d</p><br/><p>The man replied, \u201cWhy would I do that? I saw it when I came home. The man drove here and stopped outside her house. Does Wang Qin have any relative? No. Furthermore, it\u2019s a luxurious car and it must be a wealthy man. Do you think she knows any wealthy man?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, but if she\u2019s really having an affair, she shouldn\u2019t have brought him here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you stupid? I\u2019ve heard that wealthy men these days are all perverts. They love to be in the houses of these women. Let\u2019s kill this adulterous couple.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, the male villagers each took a set of tools and went over to take revenge.</p><br/><p>Soon, they reached Wang Qin\u2019s house.</p><br/><p>\u201cShh, keep your volume down. Look, that\u2019s the car. The lights are still on.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLook at the door, it\u2019s closed tightly. The lights are on too. They must be doing something.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDisgusting. Lil\u2019 Zhuang is my childhood friend, and I can\u2019t just watch him get bullied like that. I\u2019m going in to settle scores for him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s smash his car.\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly, a loud shriek could be heard from the house. The villagers outside were furious after hearing that.</p><br/><p>In the house.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan managed to awaken Zhou Zhuang.</p><br/><p>However, Zhou Zhuang was still groggy when he woke up. He did not know what was going on.</p><br/><p>Wang Qin immediately ran to Zhou Zhuang and hugged him. \u201cZhuang, you\u2019re finally awake.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Zhuang gradually regained his senses and asked, \u201cMy wife, what happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. \u201cYou fell from high up and became paralyzed, but you\u2019re fine now. Nothing\u2019s wrong anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d Zhou Zhuang was stunned upon seeing Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Wang Qin replied, \u201cZhuang, Master Lin saved you. I wanted to take care of you and send our daughter to the Welfare Institute. I didn\u2019t expect to meet Master Lin at all. When he found out about us, he came back with us and saved you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Zhuang was stunned speechless. While he was in a coma, he felt as if he had entered a dark void and was not able to find any source of light. However, he felt a surge of light enter his world earlier when Lin Fan saved him.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you, Master Lin\u2026\u201d Zhou Zhuang said in gratitude. Especially when he heard that his wife wanted to send their daughter to the Welfare Institute, he was frightened. He did not expect his wife to make such a great sacrifice for him.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled, \u201cIt\u2019s okay. it\u2019s great that you\u2019re fine now.\u201d</p><br/><p>*slam*</p><br/><p>Suddenly, a loud thud could be heard.</p><br/><p>\u201cWang Qin, how dare you bring a man home? How could you betray your husband? Get out of the house now!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, get out of the house. Otherwise, we will destroy you and the adulterer.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was confused after hearing that. Suddenly, he sighed, \u201cOh my, my car\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He knew that the people outside probably thought that Wang Qin brought him home to have an affair. He inferred that they must have smashed his car.</p><br/><p>\u2018D*mn, why am I so unlucky? Why must I lose something so precious even though I helped someone?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Qin immediately rushed out and said hurriedly, \u201cSTOP! Do not smash anything. What are you doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you asking us that? We should be the ones asking you that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Zhuang, who was lying on his bed, wanted to get up to see what was happening outside. \u201cMaster Lin, could I trouble you to help me up? I want to explain it to them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan helplessly carried Zhou Zhuang up, who probably was the only one who could explain things.</p><br/><p>The villagers outside started to argue with her, and some of them even smashed the car repeatedly.</p><br/><p>\u201cSTOP!\u201d Zhou Zhuang shouted.</p><br/><p>When the villagers saw him, they were stunned.</p><br/><p>\u201cLil\u2019 Zhuang, you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>They were stunned and they did not know what was happening.</p></div>\n</div>"}

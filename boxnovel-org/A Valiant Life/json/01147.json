He had absolute self-confidence regarding this matter.</p><br/><p>The perfect artificial limbs were definitely perfect. There wouldn\u2019t be any problems at all.</p><br/><p>*Ding ding!*</p><br/><p>At the moment, his phone rang. It was from his parents who were all the way in Zhongzhou.</p><br/><p>It seemed that this incident had drawn their attention. Lin Fan answered.</p><br/><p>His mother said worriedly, \u201cSon, how\u2019s the situation on the Internet lately? Why am I hearing that you\u2019re going to develop artificial limbs? Did something bad happen?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. \u201cMom, there\u2019s no problem. That\u2019s just what the Internet is saying. I\u2019ve actually already developed it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mama Lin: \u201cIf you\u2019ve already developed it, why are so many people scolding you on the Internet?\u201d</p><br/><p>Was Lin Fan supposed to tell his mother not to care about those people? It didn\u2019t make sense.</p><br/><p>\u201cMom, don\u2019t worry about this matter. The artificial limbs are a success. Recently, we\u2019ve been in talks with the government and I haven\u2019t been bothering about the situation on the Internet. It will be settled in a few days,\u201d Lin Fan assured her.</p><br/><p>At that moment, his father\u2019s voice rang out, \u201cSon, do your best! Your dad believes in you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. \u201cMom, tell dad not to worry. It will be fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mama Lin: \u201cThat\u2019s good. When I saw the situation on Weibo, I thought you were in trouble. If there are no problems, that\u2019s good. Your dad and I will be able to relax.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, they chatted a while more before hanging up.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian gave a thumbs up. \u201cF*ckng awesome. What you said in front of those reporters was quite admirable.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing. I shouldn\u2019t even have to explain all this. When Wang Ming Yang\u2019s discussion with the government is settled, it will be publicly announced.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut I really respect you, kid. You really didn\u2019t choose to sell it yourself. That would have earned you a lot of money.\u201d Fraud Tian really respected that decision. He had seen those artificial limbs and they were simply perfect. If Lin Fan were to manufacture and sell the artificial limbs himself, he would definitely dominate the market and become rich in an instant.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved his hand. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to respect me for that. Money is nothing to me. It\u2019s not even worth mentioning. If I wanted this kind of money, I would have become rich a long time ago. Do you believe me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI believe you. I believe whatever you say.\u201d Fraud Tian nodded. He would never doubt this kid\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>Even without the artificial limbs incident, the number of diseases the kid had cured was enough to make Fraud Tian respect him.</p><br/><p>The next day!</p><br/><p>The news came out on the Internet.</p><br/><p>\u2018Master Lin has already successfully developed the perfect artificial limbs.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Master Lin warns artificial limbs companies not to sell at ridiculous prices. Don\u2019t regret it when it\u2019s too late.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Master Lin has personally said that his perfect artificial limbs are much better than any artificial limb on the market.\u2019</p><br/><p>When the netizens saw this situation on the Internet, they didn\u2019t know what to say.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m maintaining neutrality in this matter. He\u2019s just boasting every single day. I don\u2019t even know what to say anymore.</p><br/><p>\u201cMe too. All this scolding is really tiring.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin is f*cking awesome. I absolutely believe in him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI trust that the perfect artificial limbs developed by Master Lin are definitely very amazing. Those on the market definitely can\u2019t match up to them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bor Artificial Limbs Company was helpless when they saw the news. They had been battling against Master Lin on the Internet for the past few days and they didn\u2019t even want to say more. But they hadn\u2019t expected that this Master Lin would provoke them even further.</p><br/><p><em>Don\u2019t sell at ridiculous prices? He must be joking!</em></p><br/><p>Bor Artificial Limbs Company: \u201cMaster Lin, our company doesn\u2019t want to say anything more to you. Please conduct yourself with dignity.\u201d</p><br/><p>Arc Artificial Limbs Company: \u201cOur artificial limbs are all high-tech and reasonably priced. You don\u2019t have to worry about us, Master Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was now very famous. He had so many haters on the Internet that it was scary. Hence, the number of people scolding him in the comments was scary as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat Lin is trying to generate hype again. I give up.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. If he isn\u2019t anything special, he should just stop pretending. Perfect artificial limbs? Why don\u2019t you show us instead of bragging so much?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck!\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, a netizen cursed.</p><br/><p>\u201cHurry up and take a look at Shanghai\u2019s official Weibo. Something big is going to happen!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust go and see for yourself. I\u2019m shocked. When I saw that video, I was completely stupefied.\u201d</p><br/><p>Many netizens had no idea what was going on but when they saw these comments, they became very curious. Then, they immediately went to see what Shanghai\u2019s official Weibo had posted.</p><br/><p>When they saw the message from Shanghai\u2019s official Weibo, they were all stunned.</p><br/><p>Shanghai Official Weibo: \u201cOur department is collaborating with Eastern Han Group to manufacture the perfect artificial limbs developed by Master Lin. These artificial limbs will be officially named \u2018Run My Life\u2019. This will be the biggest development in the history of artificial limbs. We have also invited some of the children from Nanshan Children\u2019s Welfare Institute to exhibit the capabilities of the perfect artificial limbs. Furthermore, we\u2019d like to thank Master Lin for his selfless contribution. These artificial limbs, which cost over two thousand dollars to manufacture will officially retail for three thousand dollars.\u201d</p><br/><p>When the message was posted on Weibo, everyone was dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, some netizens clicked on the video. The video was of a scene at Nanshan Welfare Institute.</p><br/><p>Little Mei Mei appeared in front of the lens and she was in her wheelchair. \u201cDirector, I want to run.\u201d</p><br/><p>But because she had lost her legs, she had no way to get off the wheelchair. At that moment, Director Huang brought the perfect artificial limbs over. Then, the incredible function of the artificial limbs allowed them to fuse perfectly with Little Mei Mei\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>After the limbs had fused to her body, Little Mei Mei jumped off the wheelchair and landed stably on the ground. Then, she started sprinting away like a little rocket man. She even kicked a ball on the ground playfully as she passed it.</p><br/><p>The scene changed and she was going to take a bath.</p><br/><p>Little Mei Mei went into the bathtub, then lay down and played with the water. She didn\u2019t even remove the artificial limbs.</p><br/><p>After that, more children appeared.</p><br/><p>Some of them had missing arms. But after putting on the perfect artificial limbs, they were able to hold chopsticks, use pencils and do all kinds of things without any problem at all. They did all these very nimbly and with great ease.</p><br/><p>At that moment, the netizens watching the videos stared blankly at the screen with their mouths gaping. They were clearly in disbelief. It was as if they had seen a ghost.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is too f*cking unreal, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn. It\u2019s f*cking waterproof? And are those movements really possible with artificial limbs? If I didn\u2019t see them put on the artificial limbs, I wouldn\u2019t even believe that they were doing all those things using artificial limbs.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn\u2026\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

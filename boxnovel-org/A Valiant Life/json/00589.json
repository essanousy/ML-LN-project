However, when he heard that Master Lin had once again solved another case, he became extremely anxious.</p><br/><p>He worshipped Master Lin. From what he can tell, Master Lin wasn\u2019t one to concern himself with trivial matters and liked to uphold justice. Hence, he requested for guidance, as well as an interview.</p><br/><p>He looked around he didn\u2019t manage to see Master Lin. It seems he hasn\u2019t arrived.</p><br/><p>At this moment, the discussion the reporters around him had caught his attention.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey! This interview is pointless.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIndeed! What\u2019s the big deal about this Honors Ceremony? However, this Master Lin is really amazing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI feel that it\u2019s rather ordinary. It seems that he is probably just blind luck.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Yuan listened to their conversation for a while, but after a while, he couldn\u2019t take it anymore. He retorted, \u201cWhat you said is wrong! What kind of blind luck are you talking about? Master Lin is an amazing person! Do you even know what he did in the past?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou speak as if you know what happened.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Yuan replied, \u201cLet me tell you, Master Lin had once cracked down on a human trafficking group, rescuing hundreds of children. He even took these children into his own care. As for the Starlight Film School incident, Master Lin defied the threats and violence and continued to fight for justice on Weibo for a female student. What\u2019s more\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Regarding Lin Fan\u2019s past achievements, Chu Yuan can be said to be an expert, not leaving out a single detail. It was as if the events all happened to him personally.</p><br/><p>If Master Lin were to know that he has a first-rate fan, he would feel rather apprehensive and wonder what this chap was thinking. It couldn\u2019t be that he had fallen in love with Lin Fan?</p><br/><p>One other reporter even changed the way he addressed Chu Yuan, \u201cBrother Chu, is everything you say true?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Yuan took a glance at him, \u201cOf course it\u2019s real! As a reporter yourself, do you not watch the news?\u201d</p><br/><p>The other party awkwardly shook his head, \u201cI was brought over to Shanghai from another place, so I don\u2019t quite understand the situation here in Shanghai.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Yuan lowered his head, \u201cI suggest you go and look up this news. You will definitely like Master Lin after reading them. Such a person like Master Lin is hard to come by. There\u2019s sort of an indescribable charm about him.\u201d</p><br/><p>The rest of the crowd nodded their heads. If what Chu Yuan said is true, then Master Lin is truly a hero. He is definitely much better than those that are currently seating in the hall.</p><br/><p>Chu Yuan was feeling pretty good about himself, for he has once again spoken out for his idol.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, the hall became very quiet.</p><br/><p>He knew that the Honors Ceremony was starting soon. He looked intently in front of him, with his cameras all pointing towards the stage, waiting for Master Lin to appear.</p><br/><p>This time, catching Scorpion had a huge influence.</p><br/><p>Scorpion was the number one drug lord who had control over many big leads. After interrogation, it revealed a number of questions. Originally, according to the police\u2019s intention, it was to continue to hide it and secretly control these clues so as to lure and arrest more criminals.</p><br/><p>However, because the arrest operation that night was already exposed by the reporters, it wasn\u2019t much of a surprise.</p><br/><p>Because of this, there wasn\u2019t a need to hide anymore. They may as well had blatantly put out to intimidate these drug traffickers.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis Master Lin is really godly. He was so successful in taking down the human trafficking group the previous time. Never would I have thought that he would be able to take down Scorpion this time as well!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIndeed! If only Master Lin was a police officer. It would really be something with these two huge successes in his bag.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, I would say that the inspector of this city district, Liu Xiao Tian, is really lucky to know a friend like this. From what I heard before, whenever something happens with Master Lin, he would inform Liu Xiao Tian at moment\u2019s notice. Why haven\u2019t we met anyone like this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSay no more, say no more\u2026 It looks like this time there\u2019s someone from the above coming down. With the success of Scorpion\u2019s arrest, it has caught the attention of the people above and it seems they want to present the award.\u201d</p><br/><p>The representative of the police force went up on stage and reported the situation over the past week, and at the same time, he explained the Scorpion situation.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease welcome Lin Fan up on stage! This is the hero from the citizens who cooperate with the police force!\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, Chu Yuan\u2019s attention was fixated on the stage. Master Lin had finally arrived.</p><br/><p>At the backstage, Lin Fan looked at Elder Dog Nicholas, \u201cElder Dog, it\u2019s our turn to go on stage! I have helped you to get on stage this time, don\u2019t you dare take it for granted!\u201d</p><br/><p>There was a thunderous round of applause. The policemen were all clapping for him</p><br/><p>There were many whispers amongst the leaders.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis Master Lin looks so young!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look down on Master Lin just because he\u2019s young. Even though he\u2019s not a cop, he has provided many contributions. Even our professionals aren\u2019t comparable to him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe managed to sabotage the human traffickers the previous time, and now he has caught the drug abusing Scorpion. Out of these two events, which of these aren\u2019t considered as a huge case?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan went on stage. Elder Dog squatted by his side. \u201cGood evening everyone, I am Lin Fan. This is only my second time on stage, so I\u2019m still rather nervous.\u201d</p><br/><p>The audience erupted in laughter.</p><br/><p>The policemen passing by the Honors Ceremony knew that Master Lin was a smooth talker and was very arrogant.</p><br/><p>The ordinary people who come here would be hoping to wear the monkey suit. However, Master Lin is not one of them. He didn\u2019t wear it at all. He even called out for the criminals to come and seek revenge on him.</p><br/><p>They were a little stunned by that.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan took the microphone and said, \u201cEven though I may be an ordinary citizen, but being the just and good-natured citizen I am, when dealing with criminals, I am never lenient. Just a while ago, Inspector Liu Xiao Tian passed me a piece of paper with an unclear picture of Scorpion on it. At that moment in time, I asked Inspector Liu if this was a joke. With such an unclear picture, how was I supposed to catch him? However, Liu Xiao Tian said this\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian sat below the stage. He originally only planned on watching Master Lin present himself. He didn\u2019t know that Master Lin would bring him into the matter. This made him extremely shocked.</p><br/><p>Even to the point that he felt like crying.</p><br/><p>Master Lin had once again recognized his efforts.</p><br/><p>Looking at this, the leaders from the other districts were both envious and resentful towards Inspector Liu. Why couldn\u2019t they meet someone like Master Lin? This Liu Xiao Tian was simply too lucky.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was speaking with much assurance on stage. He wasn\u2019t a single bit nervous. \u201cThe success of catching Scorpion is down to three heroes. Firstly, it is me. Secondly, it\u2019s the dog squatting at my feet, Elder Dog Nicholas. Thirdly, it is Inspector Liu Xiao Tian. Of course, the entire indispensable police force is also to thank! Please, I would like to welcome Inspector Liu up on stage. After all, this Honors Ceremony is not only for me, but it is for the entire police force. However, I hope it isn\u2019t a problem allowing Inspector Liu to represent the force.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian was sitting below the stage. He was completely stunned. Should I go up or should I stay seated?</p><br/><p>This was a difficult decision.</p><br/><p>Such a huge amount of credit, and yet Master Lin is throwing it onto himself. Was he out to kill him?</p><br/><p>\u201cLet us welcome Inspector Liu!\u201d Lin Fan announced.</p><br/><p>The audience applauded.</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian finally understood. He had no choice but to go up on stage. He mustered all his courage. He could feel his heart beating. He was inwardly very excited, but yet nervous.</p><br/><p>On stage.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood evening colleagues and leaders.\u201d Upon arriving on stage, Liu Xiao Tian immediately tried to suppress his anxiousness and display calmness instead. He was an inspector. If he showed any signs of nervousness, it would definitely leave a bad impression of himself on the leaders sitting below.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, he could not claim all the credit for himself.</p></div>\n</div>"}

The surgery was a success? They want to hire that 'fake doctor'?</p><br/><p>D*mn!</p><br/><p>Did they mean that the person had godly surgical skills and cured the little girl?

The fact that he had said that in front of everyone meant that it was definitely true.</p><br/><p>The reporters didn't want to let the matter rest like that. They immediately tried to ask more questions as they wanted to find out more. However, Director Chen was quite affected by this. He needed to recover from what had happened.

Then, a pretty female police officer came over \"Inspector Yang, I heard you guys went to Nanjing hospital. How was the girl? Was the surgery a success?\"</p><br/><p>Inspector Yang looked at her and smiled. \"It succeeded. It was perfect and she's recovering well.\"</p><br/><p>The female police officer replied, \"Inspector Yang, are you lying? Even if it was a success, she can't be recovering well so soon!\"</p><br/><p>Inspector Yang waved his hand. \"I still have stuff to do. I'll let them tell you about it. I'm curious as to who this mysterious fella is.\"</p><br/><p>The female police officer didn't understand what Inspector Yang meant. Then, she went to ask the other colleagues.

It was as if she had heard the happiest news in her life.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Lin Fan had already arrived in another city.</p><br/><p>Hangzhou.</p><br/><p>He had casually chosen a city that was further away. It'd be safer for him to go to a place that was further away. He didn't know if people had found out about what he had done in Nanjing. He was just thinking if he'd get arrested and end up in jail. He was frightened.</p><br/><p>After exiting the subway, he went to look for a place to spend the night. He didn't want to think about whether he'd be arrested. He wanted to wait until the task was completed first.</p><br/><p>The next day!</p><br/><p>The internet was buzzing with the news of the little girl. The reporters had posted online and many people were reading about it. When they read the news, they were extremely happy for the little girl. They had been reading about it and they had even donated money to help the little girl after knowing that her family background wasn't very good.</p><br/><p>\"Haha, this is the happiest news today.\"</p><br/><p>\"I've been anxious the entire time. I was afraid of the surgery failing, but now, I feel so much better after reading this piece of news.\"</p><br/><p>\"Wait, did you guys read the article? The person that performed the surgery for her was a mysterious man disguised as a doctor. According to what I know, the best doctor in the hospital wasn't even confident of the surgery being a success.\"</p><br/><p>\"I read about it too. This mysterious and silent godly doctor left after being chased by everyone.\"</p><br/><p>\"The video clip is out too. Look, he ran so quickly.\"</p><br/><p>\"Wait, do you guys remember that a mysterious doctor also appeared in a hospital at Suzhou? He actually successfully cured a patient of cancer.\"</p><br/><p>\"D*mn it, that sounds legit but I don't think they're the same person. I feel that the Suzhou incident could be a fake one. How can anyone successfully cure cancer?\"</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The netizens were discussing intensely on the Internet.</p><br/><p>At Nanjing's police station.</p><br/><p>A police officer held a document and came hurriedly to Inspector Yang's office. \"Inspector Yang, look at this piece of news. Recently, a mysterious man also cured a man of cancer in a hospital in Suzhou. Then, he disappeared. Nobody could find him. These pictures were taken from the Suzhou hospital. They're a little unclear. Meanwhile, this picture was taken from the Nanjing hospital. The person lowered his head and they didn't manage to capture his facial appearance.\"</p><br/><p>Inspector Yang took the documents over and looked at them closely. He started to frown.</p><br/><p>The police officer asked, \"Inspector Yang, are they the same person?\"</p><br/><p>Inspector Yang was curious and he examined the pictures carefully. Then, he nodded. \"I can confirm that they're the same person. Pass these two pictures to them and let them analyze it to confirm their identities. If they're the same person, it would aid in our investigation greatly.\"</p><br/><p>\"Alright.\" The police officer nodded. He was extremely curious and he wanted to know who the mysterious doctor was and how he possessed such powerful abilities.</p><br/><p>Of course, a lot of people on the Internet started to talk about this matter. These people were professional doctors from hospitals all over the world and there were some reputable figures too. They didn't believe in it at all. At the same time, they criticized Nanjing hospital for faking everything even though they were a big hospital.</p><br/><p>A lot of people had been watching the news about the little girl closely. Many hospitals knew about the condition of the little girl. If they said that she had recovered from just a mere surgery, it would've been an impossible feat. They definitely did not believe it.</p><br/><p>However, Nanjing hospital didn't defend themselves about it. They felt that there wasn't a need to do so and they couldn't be bothered anyway. There was no need to argue with a bunch of ignorant people. They just wanted to find the mysterious doctor as soon as possible and express their sincerity in hiring him.</p><br/><p>A good doctor would be snatched by a lot of big hospitals. Furthermore, Doctor Mao wanted to learn more from him.</p><br/><p>Upon arriving in a new city, Lin Fan naturally wanted to look around and he decided to visit the best hospital there. If he was in luck, he might even meet someone of his caliber.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, at Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian looked at the video online and asked everyone to gather around, \"Come and have a look. Doesn't that guy's back view look like someone?\"</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan looked over and said, \"Hey, isn't that Brother Lin? Why is he on the internet and why did he get chased by so many people?\"</p><br/><p>She didn't know what had happened but that back view was extremely familiar.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian was stunned. \"Why are you so certain that it's him?\"</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan looked at Fraud Tian. \"Of course I am. Let's not just talk about his back view. His clothes were bought by us. That white t-shirt with the print on the back.\"</p><br/><p>\"Oh, right!\" Fraud Tian gasped. Then, he called Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was looking for a target and when he saw the incoming call, he was annoyed. He wondered what was happening at the shop.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \"Fraud, what's up? I'm busy now!\"</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian said, \"Why did you go to Nanjing and why were you chased by so many people?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was stunned. \"What do you mean?\"</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian looked at the news and read, \"A mysterious man appeared at Nanjing hospital and saved a little girl\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was stunned. \"D*mn, how do you guys know?\"</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian said in disbelief, \"Was it really you? I didn't recognize you at first but I felt that the person looked familiar. You Lan was the one who identified you. She said that the clothes that you wore were bought by us. Also, the person was running so quickly and that had to be you. I don't get it. Why did you go to Nanjing to treat a patient?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan had initially been extremely happy but now, he was shocked. What was happening? He hadn't even revealed his face and he had already been discovered by them?</p><br/><p>It wasn't logical at all.</p><br/><p>\"Fraud, tell them not to tell anyone about this. Pretend like you've never seen it,\" Lin Fan said. He even felt like crying. What was going on? How had he suddenly gotten recognized so easily?</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian said, \"Understood. You want to stay low-key. Don't worry, we won't tell anyone about it.\"</p><br/><p>After hanging up the call.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan hit himself on his head. This situation was f*cked up. He had to quickly rush and finish the task as soon as possible.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

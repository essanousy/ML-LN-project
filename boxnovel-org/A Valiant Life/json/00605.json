He couldn\u2019t help but get excited as he asked, \u201cMaster Lin, you know Chief Xu?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shook his head, \u201cI don\u2019t. I\u2019m here today to attend Chief Liu\u2019s opening ceremony.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Jin Yun Min took a look at the hotel, then at Liu Xu, who was at the side. With one look, he had formed some thoughts in his head. Could it be that such a beautiful lady with such good qualities have some kind of relationship with Master Lin?</p><br/><p>Of course, that was definitely not possible.</p><br/><p>\u201cSigh, Master Lin, why didn\u2019t you let everyone know? It would\u2019ve been good to get everyone here to congratulate Chief Liu,\u201d complained Jin Yun Min.</p><br/><p>Ever since that gathering at Nanshan Children\u2019s Welfare Institute, they had never gathered again. Now, Master Lin was definitely not average anymore. Compared to when they had just met him, he had become much more amazing.</p><br/><p>He had initially thought that Master Lin looked down on them.</p><br/><p>But now that he had seen Master Lin, he could tell that Master Lin was still as warm and kind. That dispelled his worry. Master Lin was still the same old Master Lin.</p><br/><p>Just as Lin Fan was about to speak, Liu Xu interrupted. She grumbled, \u201cI initially wanted him to help me call some people over but he said that it was too troublesome. Now, there\u2019s basically no one at my opening ceremony. It\u2019s so embarrassing.\u201d</p><br/><p>F*ck!</p><br/><p>Lin Fan had not expected this Liu Xu to be so heartless. He had only taken advantage of her a little and now, she had started taking her revenge mercilessly.</p><br/><p>Indeed!</p><br/><p>When Jin Yun Min heard this, he couldn\u2019t stand it. \u201cMaster Lin, why are you being so modest with us? Don\u2019t worry, Chief Liu. I\u2019ll inform them right now. If they knew that Master Lin didn\u2019t call them over because he was afraid that it would be troublesome, they would definitely think that Master Lin is looking down on them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Xu smiled, \u201cChief Jin, wouldn\u2019t that be too troublesome?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot at all, not at all.\u201d Jin Yun Min waved his hand. His phone was dialing. \u201cChief Xu, why don\u2019t you go back first? I\u2019ll stay here for a while.\u201d</p><br/><p>The current situation had left Chief Xu completely dumbfounded. What was going on?</p><br/><p>This situation wasn\u2019t quite right.</p><br/><p>Jin Yun Min was his guest but now, he was going to stay here?</p><br/><p>What kind of person was that kid? He actually got respect from Chief Jin and Chief Jin even personally made calls to call people over.</p><br/><p>Even his relationship with Jin Yun Min wasn\u2019t that good. They had only met at a gathering, exchanged numbers and gradually done some business with each other.</p><br/><p>And this Chief Jin was a pretty good person. Regardless of the relationship, he would treat everyone courteously. He was very honorable.</p><br/><p>The call got through.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder He, hurry down to Long River Road. Master Lin is here at an opening ceremony and he actually didn\u2019t let us know. If I hadn\u2019t caught him, I wouldn\u2019t have known either. Let the others know while you\u2019re at it. I\u2019ll wait here for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLi Hao, what are you doing? Eating? Stop eating and hurry down to Long River Road. Master Lin\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Jin Yun Min made several tens of calls consecutively.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan felt that he had been entrapped by Liu Xu this time. He hastily said, \u201cChief Jin, there\u2019s no need to call so many people. You\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Before he could finish his sentence, Jin Yun Min interrupted, \u201cMaster Lin, that won\u2019t do. We haven\u2019t gathered together in so long. Isn\u2019t today perfect? Chief Liu is opening her hotel, how could we not come here to congratulate her?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMe and her\u2026\u201d Lin Fan was about to explain the situation but this Jin Yun Min was too headstrong. He didn\u2019t give Lin Fan a chance to explain it at all. He gave a f*cking boorish laugh and said, \u201cI understand, no need to say it. I understand\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstand my a*s!\u201d Lin Fan was close to tears. This time, he had been planning to mercilessly f*ck Liu Xu up. But he had never expected to run into Jin Yun Min.</p><br/><p>Especially now, in the end, he had probably f*cked himself up.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Liu Xu laughed. She laughed very happily. Then, she looked at Chief Xu. \u201cMy apologies, it seems that there will be people coming over to my side.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh.\u201d Chief Xu was already completely dumbfounded. He didn\u2019t even know what to say. \u201cChief Jin, why not\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Jin Yun Min waved his hand. \u201cChief Xu, you should go back first. I haven\u2019t seen these old brothers for some time now. I shall be here for this opening ceremony. Next time, I\u2019ll treat you to some wine as compensation.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jin Yun Min had already said this much, what else could Xu Ming say?</p><br/><p>He looked at Lin Fan once more. Just who on earth was this guy? Why was he given so much respect?</p><br/><p>Chief Xu was still a little unwilling to give up. He still wanted to see who exactly would be coming.</p><br/><p>Soon after.</p><br/><p>Cars started appearing in their view. These cars, as compared to the previous ones were significantly different. Compared to the previous ones, it was simply like heaven and earth.</p><br/><p>He Cheng Han got off the car and waved at Lin Fan. \u201cMaster Lin, this isn\u2019t your usual self. Such a big event and you didn\u2019t even call us. Are you looking down on us?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Hao said, \u201cYeah! If Elder Jin hadn\u2019t informed us, we wouldn\u2019t even know.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan sighed. What else could he say? There were all here already, what was there to explain? He felt especially helpless when he saw Liu Xu\u2019s proud smile. She had f*cked him up and taken her revenge on him.</p><br/><p>\u201cChief He, Chief Li, that\u2019s not what I meant. Sigh\u2026I shan\u2019t say more. You\u2019re all already here, so let\u2019s treat this as a gathering then.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan didn\u2019t want to say anymore. It would be useless to say more as they were already here. What could he possibly do? Ask them to leave?</p><br/><p>When Xu Ming saw the people who came, he was a little shocked. He didn\u2019t recognize Li Hao but he did recognize He Cheng Han.</p><br/><p>Only two people had reached and there was already one that he knew he couldn\u2019t compare to. Moreover, Chief Jin had made tens of calls. If they all came, then it would be insane.</p><br/><p>Thinking back to before, he had to give his own wisdom a thumbs up. It was lucky that he hadn\u2019t laughed at them. Otherwise, he would\u2019ve been humiliated.</p><br/><p>Especially when he saw Lin Fan\u2019s face, Xu Ming had an urge to puke out blood. So many big shots had come and yet this guys was showing an expression that said \u2018What are you all doing here?\u2019.</p><br/><p>This was just driving him crazy.</p><br/><p>Although Xu Ming wanted very much to stay here and get to know more people, the opposite party didn\u2019t wish for him to stay.</p><br/><p>\u201cChief Jin, I shall take my leave then. Next time, let\u2019s have a proper meetup,\u201d said Xu Ming.</p><br/><p>Jin Yun Min nodded, \u201cAlright, Chief Xu. See you next time then. Sorry about this. My brothers are all here and it wouldn\u2019t be nice for me to leave.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xu Ming replied, \u201cI understand, I understand.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gradually, everyone came.</p><br/><p>In the end, even Wang Ming Yang reached the scene.</p><br/><p>Liu Xu let out a smile. It was a proud smile and also a happy smile.</p><br/><p>Regardless of who it was, there was a bit of vanity in every person.</p><br/><p>That included Liu Xu.</p><br/><p>Her initially lifeless opening ceremony had, at this moment, become bustling with life.</p><br/><p>Wang Xin looked at the scene before her and was stunned. When did so many big shots suddenly appear?</p><br/><p>Liu Xu went forward suddenly and pulled on Lin Fan\u2019s arm. She opened her lips slightly and said, \u201cWon\u2019t you give me an introduction?\u201d</p><br/><p>F*ck!</p><br/><p>This woman f*cked me up!</p><br/><p>No, I absolutely must not let her have her way.</p><br/><p>Since it\u2019s like this, don\u2019t blame me.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan\u2019s arm moved and held onto Liu Xu\u2019s slender waist. It was really soft and tender. He couldn\u2019t help but give it a pinch. \u201cAlright, I\u2019ll give you an introduction.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Xu\u2019s expression changed. Then, she leaned over and said softly, \u201cIf you pinch me again, I\u2019ll cut off your dog paws.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was all smiles as he whispered, \u201cI\u2019m not that easily taken advantage of.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue went forward. \u201cYou Lan, the two of them\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan said, \u201cThey\u2019re battling each other.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Wu You Lan was startled. She didn\u2019t quite understand it.</p></div>\n</div>"}

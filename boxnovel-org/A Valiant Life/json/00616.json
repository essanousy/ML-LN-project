Encyclopedic points +100.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBeginning the fifteenth page of knowledge. Since it is the fifteenth page of knowledge, the knowledge will be chosen from knowledge related to the people next to the host.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLiu Xu has enormous feelings of being humiliated by the host. Thus, the classification which will determine the sub-classification is vehicle driving skills.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour mission: Participate in the Beijing Qingtian Bay Race and come in first place.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMission reward: +20 Encyclopedic points and the opening on the sixteenth page of knowledge.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNote: Since you have opened a subclassification, there is not need to involve things from the past careers.\u201d</p><br/><p>F*ck!</p><br/><p>Useless knowledge.</p><br/><p>He thought he would obtain some sort of earth-shattering knowledge. He never thought that he would get this kind of trash and useless knowledge. But forget it, at least it was still an important life skill.</p><br/><p>However, the encyclopedia did not give the notification that he had reached the end of the mission with the Little Intelligence Pill. So there was still another reward of another page of knowledge.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe random selection of knowledge will begin.\u201d</p><br/><p>In front of Lin Fan, a circular turntable appeared. The top of it densely covered a countless number of different classifications. There were large classifications as well as sub-classifications. There were too many to be counted and it was extremely dazzling.</p><br/><p>\u201cDing! Beginning the random selection.\u201d</p><br/><p>The turntable began to spin.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan did not have any particular wishes. This was free knowledge so what kind of good things could the encyclopedia possibly give?</p><br/><p>Even so, his heart was still in anticipation. Inside, he was still feeling a little nervous. He was just hoping he would get a good piece of knowledge as this fifteenth page was really underwhelming.</p><br/><p>Besides street racing, what other uses were there?</p><br/><p>In the real world, it was useless.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing saw his teacher just standing there motionless, he felt a little puzzled. He said, \u201cTeacher, what\u2019s up? What are you thinking about?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNothing, just thinking about some stuff.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although he did not really think much about this random selection of a classification of knowledge, he still cared a lot about it. Inside, he was still hoping that something good would be selected.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing did not saying anything else as he did not want to interrupt his teacher\u2019s thoughts. To him, his teacher must definitely be thinking about something important.</p><br/><p>He had never seen his teacher in such deep thought under such a situation.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck, it\u2019s a subclassification of knowledge.\u201d Lin Fan said as he saw the needle on the turntable slow down. From what he could see, the needle was going to stop on a subclassification of knowledge.</p><br/><p>To Lin Fan, right now, most of these subclassifications were trash. It was very uncommon to have something that would brighten up someone\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan stopped thinking about the turntable and said, \u201cMing Qing, if you have time, you should visit here more frequently. Tell the children more stories about the traditional Chinese medicine. You should understand that these children are different.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing nodded. The children were perhaps pretty mediocre before but now it was different. He still had no idea what kind of power the perfect quality Little Intelligence Pill would have.</p><br/><p>If it was like those antique magical potions, it would really stimulate their brains and make learning anything easy.</p><br/><p>If he could let these children learn all about traditional Chinese medicine by ear, he was scared that it would take less than a few years for these children to have a level of understanding of traditional Chinese medicine equal to the actual doctors.</p><br/><p>Although their practical skills will probably be very poor, their theory knowledge will definitely be very strong.</p><br/><p>After all, he himself was not the same as before. Comparing his medical expertise to back then, the difference was night and day. Not to mention he had a teacher who was pretty much like a god on earth.</p><br/><p>If he still could not teach these children, he would be a laughing stock.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck!\u201d</p><br/><p>All of a sudden, the sound of a vulgarity entered Zhao Ming Qing\u2019s ear. When he realized that this vulgarity came from the mouth of his teacher, he was a little dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, happened to you?\u201d Zhao Ming Qing asked as he stared at his teacher in shock. But suddenly, he realized that the situation was a little off. The vibe his teacher was giving him was totally different.</p><br/><p>Then, he gave his eyes a rub. He had just undoubtedly seen his teacher\u2019s face have a ray of light shining from it but it had disappeared already.</p><br/><p>This scene was not something only he saw. Director Huang and Han Lu had seen it also. The two of them also gave their eyes a rub. When they looked back, it had disappeared already.</p><br/><p>Could it be a problem with the lighting here?</p><br/><p>At that moment, Lin Fan\u2019s body started to shiver slightly. His expression was one of astonishment like he was in disbelief.</p><br/><p>His eyes which were normally filled with calm were filled with astonishment at this moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow could it\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan stood there dumbfounded and rooted to the spot. He did not want to believe the sounds coming from his brain.</p><br/><p>Could he be the Heaven\u2019s beloved pet?</p><br/><p>\u201cDing! The random selection is finished. Congratulations, you have received a major classification of martial art knowledge.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGreetings host, congratulations! You must be one of the heaven\u2019s beloved pets as you have obtained a seemly impossible major classification of knowledge. You are close to leaving the Earth and ascending to the heavens already.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe big category of martial art knowledge is proceeded only by the hero classification of knowledge, fantasy classification of knowledge and the Shinto classification of knowledge.\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, Lin Fan\u2019s forehead was suddenly flowing with sweat, his face was slowly turning white.</p><br/><p>This was not fear or being anxious but it was that his brain was having a huge amount of change. The big classification of knowledge about martial arts was rushing right into his brain.</p><br/><p>Third-rate!</p><br/><p>Second-rate!</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Innate!</p><br/><p>Acquired!</p><br/><p>The magical power of the three flowers and five senses!</p><br/><p>\u201cDing! The imparting of the big classification of knowledge of martial arts is complete. The level of knowledge is at its maximum. If the host wants to reach a higher level, he has to unlock the hero classification of knowledge, fantasy classification of knowledge and the Shinto classification of knowledge. However, these classifications are impossible to be unlocked.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan\u2019s head was hurting a bit. This whole situation was pretty scary.</p><br/><p>He had never imagined that he would randomly select a big classification. Although the encyclopedia allowed him to exchange for a big classification of knowledge, however, the amount of Encyclopedic Point required was an astronomical amount. It was basically only for you to look it, you were dreaming if you were trying to exchange for it.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn it. In just this short moment, I am invincible in this world.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was lamenting inside. He had a sort of indescribable feeling.</p><br/><p>It felt like he was dreaming.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, teacher\u2026\u201d Zhao Ming Qing realized his teacher\u2019s condition was little off. This feeling was very weird. He had no idea how to express it but he just knew that it was weird.</p><br/><p>He saw a ray of light coming from his teacher but then it was gone in an instant.</p><br/><p>Also, his teacher was just standing there dumbfounded. Could something have happened to him?</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha\u2026\u201d All of a sudden, Lin Fan started laughing. He was in an excited state. At this moment, he felt like he could fly.</p><br/><p>\u201cMing Qing, don\u2019t say anything. Today, I, your teacher, am really too happy. If you have any requests, just say it, I will gladly oblige.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan mode was joyful beyond compare. He never thought that this random selection would be such a huge present to him.</p><br/><p>Although this did not have much use in the modern world, he felt invincible right now and his mood was definitely very happy.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you okay, teacher?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing did not sigh in relief but he became even more concerned. What in the world is teacher doing? He was not too good just now and then suddenly had such a huge change.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at Zhao Ming Qing and said, \u201cWhat could be wrong? Your teacher is feeling very good right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>In the Daoism beliefs, the magical powers of the five senses were the most powerful state that anyone could achieve. It was a symbol of endless powers and even immortality. However, this was just a major classification of martial art knowledge. He wouldn\u2019t possibly be able to become an immortal. Who knew how the encyclopedia worked?</p><br/><p>Nevertheless, he felt like he had a never-ending amount of energy right now.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good, that\u2019s good. Teacher, you gave me a very weird feeling just now,\u201d Zhao Ming Qing said.</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan\u2019s ecstasy died down, he slowly started to calm down. He could not be too excited and had to keep a low profile.</p><br/><p>To Zhao Ming Qing and the rest of them, this was a trick that could not possibly exist.</p><br/><p>He had to conceal it and just live his normal everyday life.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed and said, \u201cWhat weird feeling? Your teacher just suddenly understood something that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing nodded. If that\u2019s what his teacher said then so be it, as long as he was fine.</p><br/><p>At this moment, a few strangers appeared at the Children\u2019s Welfare Institute door.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello, Director Zhao\u2026\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

He felt that he had gotten better and better at it. The core contents were inputted into the machines. Also, Wang Ming Yang had given him a very good piece of news.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang had managed to reach the initial stages of collaboration with the government and they had even come to an agreement regarding the price.</p><br/><p>Initially, when Wang Ming Yang had presented the product to the leaders, they had thought that such a perfect artificial limb would definitely be very expensive, at least several tens of thousands in cost. But when they found out that it only cost two thousand dollars to produce, they were completely stunned.</p><br/><p>They felt that it was impossible.</p><br/><p>A leader had suggested to price it at around ten thousand. But once this was suggested, Wang Ming Yang immediately declined. He would follow his brother\u2019s instructions and he definitely had to price it at the lowest possible price. It was absurd for that leader to suggest ten thousand dollars.</p><br/><p>However, what surprised Wang Ming Yang was that the other leaders actually agreed with that suggested price and they felt that it was very appropriate. After all, to them, this perfect artificial limb was very impressive indeed. It was much more advanced than the other artificial limbs on the market.</p><br/><p>It was so advanced that they couldn\u2019t quite believe it.</p><br/><p>Then, when Wang Ming Yang announced the final price, everyone was stunned.</p><br/><p>\u201cThree thousand dollars!\u201d</p><br/><p>To them, three thousand dollars was way too cheap. They couldn\u2019t quite accept that.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang immediately revealed that this artificial limb had been developed by Master Lin and it wasn\u2019t meant to be used to generate income. If the government wouldn\u2019t accept it, Wang Ming Yang would just bring the product into the market on his own.</p><br/><p>However, Secretary Chen slammed the table and decided on the spot to begin producing the artificial limbs and bring them into the market as Master Lin intended. At the same time, he initiated a discussion regarding the issue of other artificial limb companies in the market.</p><br/><p>After all, if these perfect artificial limbs were to be released, it would have a great impact on those companies.</p><br/><p>But it couldn\u2019t be helped. This was an inevitable problem that came with any reform.</p><br/><p>Cloud Street!</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was feeling refreshed and energetic. After working hard for this period of time, he had already finished producing artificial limbs for all those crippled children of the welfare institute. He really felt amazing.</p><br/><p>When he reached the shop and Fraud Tian and the rest saw him, it was as if they were looking at an amazing person. They were all so excited that they didn\u2019t know what to say.</p><br/><p>\u201cKid, you\u2019re finally back. If you still didn\u2019t come back, I would have thought that you were so addicted to your research that you couldn\u2019t stop.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang and Wu You Lan came over as well. They were all in immense admiration of the things Brother Lin had done. They had no idea how to even express their admiration. They could only say that he was amazing.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha. I was busy doing big things,\u201d said Lin Fan with a laugh, \u201cHow is it? Judging by your expressions, you probably already know about the perfect artificial limbs.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang nodded. \u201cMmm. We all know about it. We specially went to the welfare institute to take a look. These perfect artificial limbs are really too amazing. If they wear clothes over those artificial limbs, you wouldn\u2019t even be able to tell that those are artificial limbs.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan grinned. \u201cOf course. Don\u2019t you know who made those artificial limbs? But this matter isn\u2019t over yet. I\u2019ve resolved the situation at the welfare institute but there are still many people outside that are just like those children. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve gotten Wang Ming Yang to talk to the government to start spreading these artificial limbs to the masses. I think it should be done soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat would really be amazing!\u201d Zhao Zhong Yang exclaimed. At the same time, he thought that if these were to be spread to the masses, those artificial limb companies would probably be miserable.</p><br/><p>However, since they were collaborating with the government, the government definitely wouldn\u2019t let those companies take too great of a hit. The government would probably find a solution.</p><br/><p>Of course, this matter was out of their hands. It was the government\u2019s concern now.</p><br/><p>On the Internet.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan took out his phone. He hadn\u2019t posted anything on Weibo in a long time. If he were to remain silent for any longer, those netizens might start to forget about him.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, after being secluded for so long, I\u2019m finally out. I can finally let loose now.\u201d</p><br/><p>When this post was sent, the netizens instantly boiled over with excitement.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn. Master Lin has finally appeared.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere the heck has he been recently? I didn\u2019t see any updates from him and I even thought that he had run away.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, how is the perfect artificial limb research going? A lot of people are mocking you. You have to show them your true abilities.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSome specialists have been talking a lot recently. You have to teach them a lesson.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, did you manage to develop it or not? They\u2019re all saying that you haven\u2019t appeared recently because you were waiting for the news to die down. But some people are deliberately bringing up the topic and not letting it go.\u201d</p><br/><p>The netizens kept commenting below the post. They were very curious about this matter and they were all wondering what exactly was going on.</p><br/><p>However, judging by the situation, something didn\u2019t seem right.</p><br/><p>Master Lin hadn\u2019t said anything after sending that post. To them, it really seemed like he was avoiding the problem.</p><br/><p>At that moment, the official Weibo account of Bor Artificial Limbs Company made a post.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, have you successfully developed it? How is it? How are the perfect artificial limbs? Our company has recently released a new product, which is an improved version of our previous product. Right now, it is only priced at $48,000 and it will change the lives of our crippled friends.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Bor Artificial Limbs Company sent that post, many netizens commented below it.</p><br/><p>These netizens were all either crippled or they had family members who were crippled, so they paid special attention to these companies. They would always pay attention to the latest updates. When they saw that Bor Artificial Limbs Company had released a new product, they were excited.</p><br/><p>However, when they saw the price, they were stunned. This was too expensive and it was difficult for them to accept it.</p><br/><p>But when they thought about the condition of their bodies, they had no choice but to accept it.</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan saw Bor Artificial Limbs Company\u2019s post, he commented as well. \u201cYou\u2019re selling your product at too high of a price. People won\u2019t be able to afford it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bor Artificial Limbs Company: \u201cExpensive? This isn\u2019t expensive at all. This is a very high-tech product.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan continued to comment. \u201cThe perfect artificial limbs that I\u2019ve produced will be sold for just three thousand dollars. And all the materials used are very good too. You\u2019re too greedy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bors Artificial Limbs Company: \u201cMaster Lin, please mind your words. We\u2019re already offering a very generous price. What could a three thousand dollar artificial limb possibly do? You must be joking. Talking to an outsider like you about this subject is like talking to a cow about feelings.\u201d</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, when the netizens saw Master Lin\u2019s reply, they were astonished.</p><br/><p>Three thousand dollars?</p><br/><p>What kind of artificial limbs are those?</p>\n</div>"}

In the past, Master Lin could have cured AIDS but he just didn\u2019t come up with the medicinal recipe? I don\u2019t even wanna talk about it anymore. It\u2019s unbelievable.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not just you. Me too, there\u2019s simply nothing to say anymore. This man is too awesome. We\u2019ll never know what his next move is going to be.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI too am convinced.

They were simply too stunned by the Chinese and they did not even know what to say.</p><br/><p>To them, they could not describe it with anything at all besides that they were convinced that Master Lin was simply too powerful.</p><br/><p>There were even foreign media companies who were competing to see who could publish articles about this matter first.</p><br/><p>When they found out that a Chinese man eradicated AIDS, they felt that it was impossible because China\u2019s medical knowledge and technology was not as good as some of the more advanced countries out there.</p><br/><p>After all, a lot of people went abroad to seek medical treatment.</p><br/><p>At Cloud Street!</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan arrived there, Cloud Street was already buzzing with life. A lot of people from all around the world were there to see Master Lin.</p><br/><p>The reporters had been camping there since early morning as they had agreed to let Master Lin rest yesterday.</p><br/><p>Now that he was finally ready, they wanted to interview him.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was already used to situations like this. He knew that this was going to happen after eradicating AIDS.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, can we finally interview you today?\u201d The reporters asked.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded. \u201cSure, you can ask anything you want.\u201d</p><br/><p>He was ready to be bombarded with questions.</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang took out his phone and started a livestream. \u201cEveryone, Cloud Street is flooded with people and it\u2019s buzzing with life!\u201d</p><br/><p>When he started the broadcast, a huge wave of netizens tuned in. They were curious and wanted to see how the situation was like.</p><br/><p>When they saw it, they were dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, that\u2019s a lot of people\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s frightening. If we were to go there now, we\u2019d probably be standing at the end of Cloud Street.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to start donating presents again. It\u2019s a joyous occasion!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s to congratulate Master Lin on eradicating AIDS.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang could not stop smiling. He was really proud of being a part of Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Lin Fan was surrounded by reporters, and he was answering all sorts of questions without any hesitation.</p><br/><p>The townsfolk observed the situation and started to discuss among themselves. Everyone was in awe of Master Lin.</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan was being interviewed, the manufacturer of the Chinese herbs was literally tied down with work. Everyone from all around the world wanted to buy it.</p><br/><p>His company was recognised by Master Lin for his reasonable price and quality. Of course, his business was great.</p><br/><p>He did not just have local customers. Even foreigners called to order the herbs from him.</p><br/><p>It was considered to be spreading the power of Chinese medicine to the whole world.</p><br/><p>After all, AIDS could occur anywhere outside of China as well. It was one of the most feared diseases of the world.</p><br/><p>At the same time, a person\u2019s personal information was spreading throughout the government sector.</p><br/><p>This person\u2019s information was simple, but he was extremely powerful.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan, a member of the Han ethnic group from China.</p><br/><p>A master in Chinese Arts, Martial Arts, Chinese Medicine, Western Medicine, gourmet food, etc\u2026</p><br/><p>The list of specialties was like an unending list of words.</p><br/><p>At the same time, the list of achievements was simply stunning.</p><br/><p>Eradicated anorexia, leukemia, AIDS, etc\u2026</p><br/><p>All the details were specifically reported and the document was given to the top of the management board.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan still had no idea what just happened.</p><br/><p>A few days later.</p><br/><p>This was not reported yet. However, many foreign representatives came to China to speak with various leaders about it.</p><br/><p>After all, this Chinese man just eradicated AIDS, and he deserved to be respected by everyone.</p><br/><p>He just resolved one of the most complicated problems of humanity. It could even be said to be a miracle.</p><br/><p>On this day.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was in his shop when his phone suddenly rang.</p><br/><p>When he saw the caller ID, he was confused.</p><br/><p>\u201cSecretary Chen, why did you call me?\u201d Lin Fan asked curiously. After all, he was an influential figure.</p><br/><p>Secretary Chen replied, \u201cMaster Lin, congratulations.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCongratulations?\u201d Lin Fan was stunned. He added, \u201cSecretary Chen, what do you mean? I don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><br/><p>Secretary Chen smiled. \u201cMaster Lin, I have received news that you will be given a prize. Also, it\u2019s not an ordinary one. It\u2019s extraordinary, and this piece of news was just handed to me by the leaders.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was confused. He still did not know what just happened.</p><br/><p>\u201cSecretary Chen, could you please get straight to the point? I still don\u2019t get you,\u201d Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>Secretary Chen replied, \u201cHaha, don\u2019t worry. You\u2019ll find out soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan wanted to try and foresee it with his fortune-telling skills, but he dismissed that thought as he felt that it would not be fun anymore if he were to do that.</p><br/><p>\u201cSecretary Chen, may I know when will it be then?\u201d Lin Fan asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm, I still don\u2019t know yet. Anyway, just wait for my good news. When I found out about this, I was shocked too. However, I believe someone like you deserves to be treated specially like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Secretary Chen was really impressed by Master Lin.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

It was not very meaningful to him to discuss Chinese Art with a bunch of old men. Also, they obviously did not want to talk much but just wanted to quietly stand there and look at the painting.</p><br/><p>Every time they looked at the \u2018Along the River During the Qingming Festival Painting\u2019 it would give them a stunning feeling.</p><br/><p>They had already looked at it a few times and yet they still could not keep calm when seeing it.</p><br/><p>Ding ding!</p><br/><p>Unexpectedly, it was a phone call from Wu Yun Gang. When he answered the phone, there was the distinct Wu Yun Gang happy laughter.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, you didn\u2019t even tell me you were here in Beijing. If it wasn\u2019t for me talking to Ming Yang on the phone, I wouldn\u2019t even know that you were here,\u201d Wu Yun Gang had always been always in Beijing. Whenever he went to Shanghai, it was all for work reasons. Also, every time he came to Shanghai, he would personally go and visit Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>\u201cDirector Wu, you\u2019re a busy person. I came here to Beijing just to play around. I didn\u2019t want to disturb you,\u201d Lin Fan smiled and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, Master Lin, you must look down on me. For you to come to Beijing and me to not receive you, if Ming Yang were to know about this, he would curse and scold me. Where are you now? I\u2019ll come and pick you up,\u201d Wu Yun Gang opened his mouth and asked.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan hesitated for a moment and said, \u201cNo need for me that. I\u2019ll come and find you. It\u2019s a chance for me to see your office as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Yun Gang heard that and was momentarily very excited as he said, \u201cOkay, okay. I\u2019ll be here looking forward to seeing you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then they hung up.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan did not have anything to do anyway so he might as well go there and take a look.</p><br/><p>He started driving and within about half an hour, he reached his destination.</p><br/><p>In Beijing, Wu Yun Gang\u2019s reputation was not that spectacular. However, it was not bad and he was still considered a famous entrepreneur.</p><br/><p>Once Wu Yun Gang was done talking to Master Lin on the phone, he rushed down to the first-floor lobby to wait for him. The people at the front desk saw the boss arrive and they immediately started doing their jobs properly and did not dare to play with their phones.</p><br/><p>However, they had some suspicions. The boss came down and was just standing in the doorway. Could he be waiting for someone?</p><br/><p>However, they did not receive any news that a big shot was going to come by.</p><br/><p>Regardless, they could only just be well-behaved. If the boss saw any of their dirty tricks, it would be a huge tragedy.</p><br/><p>At this moment, as Wu Yun Gang was glancing left and right, his eyes suddenly lit up and there was a smile on his face as he said, \u201cMaster Lin\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan came out from the rented vehicle and then caught a glimpse of Wu Yun Gang. Then he momentarily smiled, saying, \u201cDirector Wu. You even came down to personally receive me, I feel so bad.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need, no need. For Master Lin to come to my company, it is an honor for me. Come, let\u2019s go up and chat. Recently, I\u2019ve been extremely busy here and haven\u2019t had the time to go to Shanghai,\u201d Wu Yun Gang said with a gleaming smile on his face.</p><br/><p>Ever since the previous incident, the project that he and Ming Yang had been working on in Beijing had been smooth sailing and had not met any obstacles.</p><br/><p>Although Master Lin did not say it, he knew that it was because of Master Lin that people did not dare to inconvenience him.</p><br/><p>The female receptionist at the lobby had just seen her boss chatting and laughing with a young man. She felt a little apprehensive and was wondering who this young man was. He was being treated to courteously.</p><br/><p>In the office.</p><br/><p>Wu Yun Gang had asked his secretary to prepare some tea as he said, \u201cMaster Lin, what do you think of this place?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan scanned the surroundings. When he looked at Wu Yun Gang, his heart sank. He felt that it was impossible, but he calmly said, \u201cNot bad, it\u2019s really not bad. Also, your complexion is looking pretty good. Your wealth and luck must be very good. Looks like you have sealed another big business deal?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Yun Gang was stunned. Then, he started laughing and saying, \u201cMaster Lin is indeed Master Lin, being able to see everything. However, it\u2019s not a done deal yet.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved his hand and said, \u201cI see that it will be done.\u201d</p><br/><p>If it was anyone else who said these words, Wu Yun Gang would respond politely. However, since these words were from Master Lin, it was a different story.</p><br/><p>Who was Master Lin? Other people did not even know about this. How could he have known?</p><br/><p>Those were the words from a golden mouth. His words were extremely accurate. What he said was what would happen. He was really amazing.</p><br/><p>Very quickly, the secretary returned with the tea.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan glanced at her. She was very pretty and had a great body. It looked like this Wu Yun Gang really knew how to enjoy things. However, inside, he was still thinking about what had happened a moment ago.</p><br/><p>Wu Yun Gang sensed that something was fishy in Master Lin\u2019s expression. He was scared that he was doubting himself. He said, \u201cMaster Lin, this is my niece, Wu Ya Ting. Ya Ting, greet Uncle Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Ya Ting said, \u201cHello, Uncle Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although the greeting was very natural, Lin Fan could sense a hint of doubt coming from her eyes. At the same time, she was a little mysterious. She just stood at the side, very well behaved and not saying a word, but her eyes were sizing up Lin Fan and filled with curiosity.</p><br/><p>In her heart, she was wondering who this young man was. Why was he so familiar with her Uncle? Moreover, this man didn\u2019t seem much older than herself. It was weird for her to call him Uncle.</p><br/><p>But why did he keep staring at her?</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Lin Fan did not know that, just like that, Wu Yun Gang\u2019s niece\u2019s mind was already filled with many different thoughts.</p><br/><p>Wu Yun Gang saw that Master Lin was constantly staring at her niece and became a little suspicious. If it was any other men, he would have thought that they were interested in her. But since it was Master Lin, he did not think that way.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, are there any problems with my niece?\u201d Wu Yun Gang quietly asked. He knew that Master Lin would not stare at his niece for no reason at all. There had to be something. He could only hope that it was nothing bad.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan snapped out of his daze and then gave a gentle laugh, saying, \u201cNothing much. It is just that your niece is not very cautious when it comes to making friends. She needs to pay attention to the close friends by her side. But it\u2019s nothing big, no need for concern.\u201d</p><br/><p>He was starting to get a rough idea of things. It looked like everything he saw just now was all coming from the niece of Wu Yun Gang.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Wu Yun Gang sighed in relief. As long as everything was fine. He really loved and cared for his niece. His brother had died in a car accident a few years ago and left this one daughter. He took on the job of caring for her and he loved her like his own daughter.</p><br/><p>\u201cYa Ting, you heard what Uncle Lin said right? Always remember to take note of the people around you. Don\u2019t trust others too easily,\u201d Wu Yun Gang reminded her.</p><br/><p>Wu Ya Ting nodded, \u201cGot it, Uncle.\u201d</p><br/><p>Against her uncle, she did not dare to refute. However, as for what Lin Fan had said, she did not take it to heart. She felt that the friends she had were all very good and she could not possibly have made friends without being cautious.</p><br/><p>A fraud, trying to scam people. She did not even know how his uncle knew this type of person.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Lin Fan had been given such a label by a pretty lady. It was a kind of offense.</p><br/><p>Wu Yun Gang did not really dwell on this problem and started to make little conversations with Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, what did you come to Beijing for?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled, saying, \u201cNothing much. There\u2019s an international art exhibition coming up soon. I\u2019m pretty familiar with the people in the Chinese Art Association and I\u2019m even a member there. So I came here to prepare some artworks for them and after a few busy days, I finished it and I\u2019m going to return to Shanghai.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Yun Gang said, \u201cMaster Lin you really know everything. I didn\u2019t know you were actually so amazing. If there\u2019s a chance, I\u2019ll have to be thick skinned and ask you to help me do a painting.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed. For many masters with very high reputations, their works were very precious. However, Lin Fan was very indifferent about it. He said, \u201cSure. When you\u2019re 50 years old, I\u2019ll give you one.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Yun Gang laughed and said, \u201cMany thanks, Master Lin. I\u2019ll be waiting for it.\u201d</p><br/><p>However, when that time came, Wu Yun Gang definitely would not be as calm as he is right now.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

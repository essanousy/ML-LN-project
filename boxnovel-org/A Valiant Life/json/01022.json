She couldn\u2019t help but ask curiously, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on, Brother Lin?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t Fraud Tian talk about that influenza in Huang Yun Town the other time? One of my fans, a mayor, gave me a call, asking me to save his townspeople. I want to go and take a look right now,\u201d said Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>When Wu You Lan heard that, she became a little worried. \u201cBrother, if it\u2019s an influenza, isn\u2019t it fine to just leave it to the professionals? Will it be dangerous if you go?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved his hand. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. There will be no danger. If this sickness can put me in danger, I guarantee that no one will be able to treat it.\u201d</p><br/><p>He wasn\u2019t even exaggerating. With his Wuxia class of knowledge as well as the medicinal pill knowledge, if that influenza could still cause trouble for him, it would be a really valiant influenza. If that were the case, perhaps even a real god would be in danger.</p><br/><p>\u201cEnough talk. I\u2019m going now. You guys watch over the shop. Help me to tell the townsfolk who come to buy scallion pancakes tomorrow that I\u2019ll be busy for the next few days,\u201d said Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian sighed. \u201cGo on. I know you\u2019re going to save people so you\u2019re not selling scallion pancakes. Let me take the blame then.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing was at home, packing up his things. Notebooks, acupuncture needles, as well as some clothes.</p><br/><p>\u201cOld man, where are you going?\u201d Lady Zhao saw the old man packing his things and wondered what he was going to do. It had been so rare to see him resting at home today but then, he was leaving again.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m going with Teacher to treat the sick. I\u2019ll be back in a few days,\u201d said Zhao Ming Qing.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere is it?\u201d Lady Zhao did not worry but she still wanted to be clear about it.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing had wanted to tell her but then, he thought that if he told his partner about the influenza, she would be scared stiff. He smiled and said, \u201cI\u2019m going to treat a group of important people. Alright, don\u2019t ask too much. And don\u2019t tell the kids. I\u2019ll be back in a few days.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGet as much rest as you can. Don\u2019t tire yourself out too much.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGot it.\u201d Zhao Ming Qing finished packing up his things and left through the door. Outside, his teacher\u2019s car was waiting for him. He then entered the car.</p><br/><p>In the car.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan switched on his phone navigation and did a search. It was quite far and it would be quite a long drive.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, do we know what influenza it is now?\u201d asked Zhao Ming Qing.</p><br/><p>\u201cNope. It seems that this influenza is rather severe. The good thing is that it has been controlled and it hasn\u2019t spread to the outside. But a few days have already passed. If we don\u2019t cure it, it will become complicated. We\u2019ll only know the full situation when we get there,\u201d said Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing couldn\u2019t help but become solemn. Typically, when an influenza was discovered, the government would immediately gather professionals to find a cure. Now, a few days had passed and the cure hadn\u2019t been found. It seemed that it wasn\u2019t an average influenza.</p><br/><p>But with his teacher, he had a lot of faith. He believed that it would definitely not be a problem with his teacher\u2019s medical ability.</p><br/><p>But what made him confused was why the professional team hadn\u2019t looked for his teacher despite the situation being so complicated. Then, thinking about his teacher\u2019s relationship with those people, it became apparent to him. It seemed that they just didn\u2019t want to have anything to do with his teacher.</p><br/><p>Although some hospital doctors treated his teacher as an idol, professionals believed more in scientific analysis than in Chinese medicine.</p><br/><p>Even though his teacher was a Nobel Prize winner, those people still had conflicting thoughts deep in their hearts.</p><br/><p>In the big research lab.</p><br/><p>A group of professionals had been researching for very long. Although they had already found out many things from their analyses, they hadn\u2019t found a good treatment solution.</p><br/><p>\u201cSigh. What are we going to do? If this drags on, lives will be lost.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although this kind of sickness wouldn\u2019t cause death so quickly, the sufferers\u2019 conditions were getting worse by the day. The virus was slowly destroying the systems in their bodies.</p><br/><p>At that moment, a middle-aged woman spoke, \u201cIf we let Master Lin come and analyze this, we\u2019d have a very good chance of conquering the influenza.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHush. Don\u2019t talk about Master Lin. The people in charge don\u2019t like that Master Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>When the middle-aged woman heard that, she frowned as she lowered her voice. \u201cThat\u2019s their problem. In such a severe situation, we can\u2019t use other people\u2019s lives as a gamble.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve been researching for days and nights too and they want to rely on themselves to conquer this influenza. Let me tell you a secret. I\u2019ve already discussed with a group of people. If the research isn\u2019t successful, we\u2019ll immediately report to the higher-ups and request Master Lin to join the research group.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight now, the conditions in the sufferers\u2019 bodies are still considered stable. They haven\u2019t reached the point of no return yet. We still have a chance.\u201d</p><br/><p>The male professional spoke softly. Then, he continued immersing himself in the research.</p><br/><p>The middle-aged woman didn\u2019t say more. She just sighed and continued researching as well. They were all professionals. They had studied countless illnesses before and they were quite capable.</p><br/><p>And they knew that most of the people here wanted to prove one thing. And that was that they wouldn\u2019t lose to Master Lin.</p><br/><p>Huang Yun Town.</p><br/><p>Ma Jia Jun was a broadcaster from the county. At that moment, he was hiding behind a tree, holding his phone, and pointing the camera at the town entrance. He spoke softly.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrothers, do you see that? Huang Yun Town has already been sealed off. I heard that there\u2019s an influenza spreading inside and they\u2019ve been quarantined. No one is allowed to enter or leave.\u201d</p><br/><p>The netizens in the broadcast room were stunned upon hearing this.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn! Is that for real? Why haven\u2019t I seen any news reports about this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuang Yun Town. I remember it now. A few days ago, I saw a piece of news that talked about a problem here. But afterward, there were no more updates. I thought that it wasn\u2019t a problem anymore but I never thought that it would be this serious.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHost, you\u2019re pretty awesome. Aren\u2019t you afraid of death? Aren\u2019t you afraid of being infected?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ma Jia Jun held the phone as he cautiously went closer to the town. \u201cWait a moment, I\u2019m going closer to look at the whole situation. But I have to hide my phone. If they see it, it will definitely be confiscated.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c666\u2026 the host is asking for a disaster.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGo closer. I want to see what\u2019s the situation.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn. It looks like what the host said isn\u2019t far from the truth. But this place is way too desolate. It looks so poor that it\u2019s scary. I haven\u2019t seen a thatched cottage in a long time.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Ma Jia Jun walked over, the workers over there immediately chased him away. \u201cYoungster, this place is out of bounds. Go home quickly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBig Bro, what\u2019s happening to Huang Yun Town? Is there a problem?\u201d asked Ma Jia Jun. He wanted to start a conversation and find out what exactly was going on. Was it the same as he thought?</p><br/><p>The worker said, \u201cThere\u2019s no problem. Hurry up and leave. Don\u2019t loiter around.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ma Jia Jun wanted to ask more but after a long time, he still hadn\u2019t managed to find out anything from the worker. He was a little unyielding but he had no choice. He could only walk off into the distance. Then, he faced the camera and spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can guarantee that there\u2019s definitely something wrong.\u201d</p><br/><p>The next day!</p><br/><p>A piece of news was released. At that moment, all the netizens who saw the news were shocked.</p><br/><p><em>Another f*cking influenza has appeared?</em></p><br/><p>Although it hadn\u2019t happened close to them, it made their hearts jittery</p></div>\n</div>"}

When his phone rang, he immediately answered impatiently.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on now?\u201d He seemed to be very calm but on the inside, he couldn\u2019t help but be nervous. He had no idea how that guy had discovered that there were these things in his logistics company.</p><br/><p>When he established this logistics company and when he invested in Chen Chang Sheng, he had certain objectives.</p><br/><p>He definitely could not earn that much money from transport alone.</p><br/><p>Of course, he had to make use of these channels to secretly transport those things. If he used the whole country\u2019s channels and his personal connections network on top of that, what would there be that he could not transport?</p><br/><p>\u201cGodfather Liu, things are bad. The police have found drugs inside the meat. Now, they\u2019ve cordoned off the area and many people have already been caught,\u201d said an underling as his heart trembled in shock.</p><br/><p>At first, he hadn\u2019t known that there were drugs inside those meat products. He had thought that even if they got caught, the worst that could happen was that the company would be closed down temporarily and somebody would take the blame and go to prison for a few years. And with Godfather Liu\u2019s connections, that person might not even have to be in prison for long.</p><br/><p>But now, it was different. The police had found a large amount of drugs inside. That amount was enough to warrant an execution.</p><br/><p>\u201cGodfather Liu?\u201d</p><br/><p>His underling didn\u2019t hear anything from the other end of the call and couldn\u2019t help but become anxious. He had no idea what to do anymore.</p><br/><p>*beep beep*</p><br/><p>The call was hung up.</p><br/><p>Godfather Liu sat on the sofa. His head was aching very much. He didn\u2019t know what to do.</p><br/><p>The logistics manager was probably not willing to take the blame for him anymore. If they hadn\u2019t found the drugs, it wouldn\u2019t have been a problem but now, no one would be as stupid as to take the blame for him and risk their own lives.</p><br/><p>No. He had to quickly beg for help.</p><br/><p>Then, he immediately took out his phone and made a call.</p><br/><p>\u201cGodfather Qin, save me.\u201d Once the call was answered, Godfather Liu started begging bitterly. The only other path was death.</p><br/><p>\u201cLil\u2019 Liu, what\u2019s going on?\u201d Godfather Qin\u2019s voice was deep. It was the first time he had seen Lil\u2019 Liu in such a panic.</p><br/><p>Although Godfather Liu pretended to be calm, his face was pale white. He knew that if this matter wasn\u2019t handled properly, he would be in a very bad spot. With his status in the Northeast, he had not expected anyone to have the guts to search his logistics company and even if they did search it, they definitely would have informed him in advance and he would have had enough time to move the goods away.</p><br/><p>But now, that Master Lin from Shanghai had brought reporters and charged into his company, exposing the scene. This speed left him unable to respond in time.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe things that I\u2019ve been hiding in my logistics company have been discovered,\u201d said Godfather Liu nervously.</p><br/><p>Godfather Qin said, \u201cOh, those meats that have been chilled for tens of years, right? So what? Isn\u2019t it fine if you just get someone to take the blame for you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. If it was like that, I definitely wouldn\u2019t have had to trouble you, Godfather Qin. But I hid some drugs over there and now, they\u2019ve been discovered. I\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Godfather Qin: \u201c???\u201d</p><br/><p>Godfather Liu didn\u2019t know what Godfather Qin would think of this but he had no other choice now. \u201cGodfather Qin, you have to help me out. I really have no other way. If they continue investigating, I\u2019ll have to bear the consequences. You know how strict the policies are these days and the amount of drugs I possess exceeds the amount that warrants a death sentence tens of times. I\u2019m afraid that manager of mine won\u2019t take the blame for me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Godfather Qin was considered one of the top behind-the-scenes big shots in the Northeast. He knew many influential people. In all these years, he rarely managed any matters. He would leave all the matters to his underlings to manage.</p><br/><p>In the Northeast, Godfather Liu was known as an underground big shot but when Godfather Qin was around, he would never dare to be called a big shot.</p><br/><p>Because Godfather Qin\u2019s power was immense. His network of connections was complicated. If he just randomly picked one of his social connections, it would be enough to shock Godfather Liu.</p><br/><p>Godfather Qin was angry. \u201cLil\u2019 Liu, are you a f*cking idiot? How could you get caught for something like this? How have you been doing things all these years?\u201d</p><br/><p>Godfather Liu said, \u201cGodfather Qin, please save me. I am really at a loss this time. I\u2019ve been targeted by that Shanghai piece of sh*t. He came to the Northeast to cause trouble for me. He brought the reporters and charged into my company. My men were simply unable to stop them. I don\u2019t even know how he found out about these things.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShanghai\u2019s Master Lin?\u201d Godfather Qin was startled. Then, he said coldly, \u201cDidn\u2019t I already tell you not to anger him? And you still f*cking angered him. Don\u2019t you know that the higher-ups have already warned you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Godfather Liu lamented, \u201cGodfather Qin, I didn\u2019t anger him. That guy actively came to anger me. I got angry and scolded him a little. But who would have known that that guy would really come to the Northeast? I didn\u2019t expect that at all.\u201d</p><br/><p>Godfather Qin said, \u201cLil\u2019 Liu, I\u2019m very disappointed in you. I usually tell you to look at Weibo more but you don\u2019t f*cking listen. Can\u2019t you see for yourself what kind of character that Master Lin is? And you still went to scold him. Do you know how Ma Qing Zhou died? He f*cking asked for his own death.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026\u201d Godfather Liu wiped the sweat from his forehead. His heart was panicking. Although nothing had happened to him yet, he could tell that by tomorrow latest, he would be taken away.</p><br/><p>As for making a run for it, he didn\u2019t even think about it. If he ran, he would never be able to turn back. If he stayed, he could still think of ways to suppress the situation.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make some arrangements for you. As for whether it succeeds, it will depend on your luck. I\u2019ll do what I can to suppress the news and media\u2026\u201d Godfather Qin had started to think of solutions.</p><br/><p>Although he had scolded Lil\u2019 Liu, he couldn\u2019t just watch him die. Lil\u2019 Liu helped him to manage his influence underground. If something really happened to Lil\u2019 Liu, he was afraid that he would be implicated as well.</p><br/><p>But he was really disappointed in Lil\u2019 Liu and thought he was an idiot.</p><br/><p>That Master Lin from Shanghai was a f*cking madman, but Lil\u2019 Liu still angered him. Wasn\u2019t that just asking for death?</p><br/><p>After hanging up, Godfather Liu\u2019s expression gradually turned cold and gloomy. He couldn\u2019t just rely on Godfather Qin. He had to do his part as well.</p><br/><p>The next day!</p><br/><p>There weren\u2019t many news agencies in the Northeast that reported the incident. This was all due to the opposition, who had told the media not to report it.</p><br/><p>However, a wonderful thing happened.</p><br/><p>News agencies from Shanghai, Zhongzhou, Qingzhou, Lianzhou and other places had started to report the news.</p><br/><p>\u2018The Northeast\u2019s XX Logistics has been hiding meat products that have been chilled for tens of years. And inside those meat products, drugs were hidden.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Upon reaching the Northeast, Master Lin performs a huge deed.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018A logistics company has done a shockingly bad thing.\u2019</p><br/><p>These news articles kept on bursting out.</p><br/><p>The previous day, just when the matter had been exposed, Godfather Liu and Godfather Qin already made their move. They first suppressed the media and news agencies within the Northeast, not permitting them to report this matter. And these agencies did not dare to go against their requests at all. They could only accept it. However, even though they accepted it, there were a number of righteous agencies that were also quite nimble-minded. They weren\u2019t allowed to report it, however, they had not been told not to send the materials that they recorded to other people.</p><br/><p>Hence, many agencies in the Northeast sent their news materials to other fellow reporters, telling them to publish it.</p><br/><p>This matter involved Master Lin. To the news reporters, it was big news. Hence, regardless of anything else, they immediately published it.</p><br/><p>They weren\u2019t news agencies in the Northeast, hence, they were unafraid. They immediately exposed the matter on the Internet without restraint.</p></div>\n</div>"}

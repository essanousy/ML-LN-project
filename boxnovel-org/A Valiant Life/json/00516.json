This matter was clearly causing trouble for Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf there\u2019s anything to talk about, we can meet another day. It\u2019s pretty late now,\u201d Lin Fan looked at the time and realized that it was quite late. Then, he turned and was prepared to go.</p><br/><p>Brother Qiang Qiang wasn\u2019t going to let him go. She held onto Lin Fan\u2019s wrist. Although she put on a fierce face, a pretty lady would still look cute. She said gently, \u201cYou can\u2019t go, you have to be responsible for me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cResponsible for what? If you don\u2019t say it clearly, people would be suspicious,\u201d Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>Brother Qiang Qiang had a stern look on her face. She stared at Lin Fan and shook her head, \u201cNo, you have to give me an answer today. If not, I will not back down.\u201d</p><br/><p>If he had known that things would turn out this way, he wouldn\u2019t have gotten involved in this. This person actually went to look for him and was interfering with his life. What could he do?</p><br/><p>*click*</p><br/><p>A neighbor\u2019s door opened.</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung man, I heard what you guys were talking about. This is your fault. You can\u2019t be wishy-washy about this. She is already so pitiful, how could you do this?\u201d It was a middle-aged man and he woke up in the middle of the night to go to the toilet. He eavesdropped when he heard a commotion outside. When he opened the door and saw Brother Qiang Qiang\u2019s face, he was stunned. She looked like a beautiful lady. At the same time, he was a little doubtful of why Lin Fan would dump a pretty lady like her.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said apologetically, \u201cSorry to have disturbed your rest.\u201d</p><br/><p>The middle-aged man didn\u2019t want to go back. He added, \u201cThat\u2019s okay. It\u2019s just this incident\u2026I\u2019ve been involved in a similar situation before. I regretted it so much. Look at me\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He started to talk about himself and things were getting interesting.</p><br/><p>Brother Qiang Qiang looked at him, \u201cThis is none of your business, get lost!\u201d</p><br/><p>Huh?</p><br/><p>The middle-aged man was a little embarrassed. He hadn\u2019t expected a beautiful lady like her to be so hot-tempered. Then, he understood it. Just as he was about to close the door, he shouted, \u201cBro, I support you for dumping a lady like her. She deserves it\u2026\u201d Then, he slammed the door shut.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan felt so helpless. This matter didn\u2019t concern him at all but he had to make things clear. If not, this would continue to drag.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cTell me what you want. I\u2019ll be frank. This can\u2019t be changed. When things can\u2019t be changed, you have to find joy in what you have.\u201d</p><br/><p>Brother Qiang Qiang sounded a little different, \u201cI regret it so much. I shouldn\u2019t have believed you that time. I didn\u2019t know that there were people like you. You\u2019re so irresponsible after what you\u2019ve done. It\u2019s clearly your fault, okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan thought about it for a moment. \u201cLet me study about this and if I can figure this out, I will let you know. What do you think? With my current medical knowledge and skills, it shouldn\u2019t be a problem if I were to put in some effort.\u201d</p><br/><p>Brother Qiang Qiang thought for a moment. She knew that this matter wouldn\u2019t be resolved so quickly. Initially, she had wanted to kidnap Lin Fan and torture him everyday. If he didn\u2019t transform her back, he could forget about being free.</p><br/><p>However, she could tell that this fella was way more powerful than her. She couldn\u2019t have matched up to him.</p><br/><p>Perhaps the hard approach wouldn\u2019t work and she had to use the soft approach.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll give you some time. One month. If you can\u2019t help me after a month, I\u2019ll kill you,\u201d Brother Qiang Qiang said angrily.</p><br/><p>One month wasn\u2019t too short.</p><br/><p>He needed to calm her down first.</p><br/><p>As for the one month offer, that could still be negotiated later.</p><br/><p>The most important thing was to return home for a good night\u2019s rest.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan patted his chest, \u201cAlright, no problem. One month it is then. If it doesn\u2019t work after a month, we can discuss it again.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph!\u201d Brother Qiang Qiang left after saying what she needed to say.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shook his head and returned home to sleep.</p><br/><p>Brother Qiang Qiang left the small district full of frustration. She hadn\u2019t expected to be scammed by a godly doctor. If he didn\u2019t change her, she wouldn\u2019t let this matter go.</p><br/><p>After all, she had done a search online and bought some sex hormones to consume. However, they didn\u2019t help at all.</p><br/><p>she didn\u2019t know what this fella had fed her with. Even the sex hormones didn\u2019t work.</p><br/><p>She wasn\u2019t prepared to leave Shanghai so soon. If she couldn\u2019t resolve this matter, she would be too ashamed to return to Jiangning.</p><br/><p>After being slammed to the ground, she felt as if her waist was broken.</p><br/><p>There wasn\u2019t anyone on the way out.</p><br/><p>Then, a young man looked like he was drunk. He walked over unsteadily and when he saw Brother Qiang Qiang, his eyes glimmered. \u201cA beautiful lady, a beautiful lady indeed. You\u2019re even wearing a uniform. Come, sleep with me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Brother Qiang Qiang was indeed a woman now but she still had a man\u2019s heart. She was wearing unisex clothing but it couldn\u2019t have hidden her figure.</p><br/><p>The man walked to Brother Qiang Qiang and wanted to touch her face.</p><br/><p>Brother Qiang Qiang was furious. This man was asking for trouble.</p><br/><p>\u201cGo back and sleep with your mom.\u201d Brother Qiang Qiang kicked the young chap\u2019s private part and slapped his face. He collapsed to the ground. \u201cYou\u2019re a f*cking loser. Go to Jiangning and find out who Brother Qiang Qiang is.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, he screamed in pain as he held onto his private part. Brother Qiang Qiang immediately left.</p><br/><p>It had been such an infuriating day. Her hips were still hurting. Furthermore, she had a black belt in Taekwondo. She was qualified to be a coach but this a*shole still messed with her. He was simply asking for trouble.</p><br/><p>However, when she thought of being slammed to the ground by that fella, she was extremely furious. At the same time, she knew that the fella was perhaps an extremely powerful individual.</p><br/><p>After everything, she couldn\u2019t let this matter rest so easily. She had to do something about it.</p><br/><p>She had to continue pestering him until he changed her back.</p><br/><p>Upstairs, at the apartment block.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was holding a glass of water as he looked below from his balcony. As he looked at the road, he drank a sip of water. \u201cYou\u2019re a pretty valiant individual.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although it had already been late at night and he couldn\u2019t see clearly, he knew that the person that attacked him had probably been feeling tragic.</p><br/><p>Then, he shook his head helplessly.</p><br/><p>This matter really left him helpless. He was actually being pestered by a fake man.</p><br/><p>A lot of bizarre things existed in this world and it was normal to see a transgender. However, he had never seen one that requested to have her inner self changed. Furthermore, she wanted to have a beard and rougher skin.</p><br/><p>Where did this kind of people come from?</p><br/><p>He thought of those young male idols who wanted to change into women and have better skin so that they could seduce anyone with just one look.</p><br/><p>He shook his head and decided to not think about it anymore.</p><br/><p>He went to sleep.</p><br/><p>He hoped that he would be able to settle things soon.</p><br/><p>However, he couldn\u2019t just change what had happened. He could have answered her that right then. The matter had already happened and he couldn\u2019t do anything to change it.</p><br/><p>It looked like he had to think of a solution to resolve this.</p></div>\n</div>"}

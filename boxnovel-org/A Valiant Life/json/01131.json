Even the elevator is bullying us!\u201d Chu Shen bellowed exasperatedly.</p><br/><p>Being in the elevator, he was very afraid. If it were to suddenly fall, wouldn\u2019t he die instantly?</p><br/><p>No matter how much money he had or how many connections he had, it would all be useless. They would all disappear the moment the elevator falls.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are all useless. What were you all saying before? That you are inheritors of martial arts. That the martial arts association is no match for you. Now, in front of that Lin, you don\u2019t even dare to move. What do I pay you so much for?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Shen got angrier the more he thought about it. He vented his rage on the bodyguards.</p><br/><p>The bodyguards looked at Chu Shen helplessly. \u201cChief Chu, you can\u2019t blame us. That\u2019s Master Lin, who\u2019s wide-regarded as the strongest in the martial arts world. How could we possibly match up to him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Chu Shen didn\u2019t want to say more. The flame in his heart was difficult to extinguish. If they couldn\u2019t redeem themselves, he wouldn\u2019t let them work for him anymore.</p><br/><p>The elevator phone rang.</p><br/><p>Chu Shen immediately answered it as he snarled, \u201cWhat kind of elevator is this? How can it just stop all of a sudden? Hurry up and fix it!\u201d</p><br/><p>The technical staff had received Master Lin\u2019s instructions. He said in a very unfriendly tone, \u201cWhat are you guys doing? Don\u2019t you have any values? Don\u2019t you know that you can\u2019t hit the elevator? Now, the elevator has been broken by you. We\u2019re repairing it right now. Later on, come down and pay for it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat kind of attitude is that? Let me tell you this. If you don\u2019t hurry up and fix the elevator, I\u2019ll make sure you suffer the consequences.\u201d Chu Shen was enraged. He had been slapped by that Lin and it was still stinging. Now, a lowly technical staff member dared to act impudently towards him. Could it be that everyone dared to be impudent towards him now?</p><br/><p>The technical staff said, \u201cWhat kind of attitude is that? Just wait inside then. When your attitude improves, call us back.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck!\u201d Chu Shen was so angry that flames nearly emitted from his eyes. Then, he calmed himself down. \u201cPlease hurry up a little. Please.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s more like it. Just wait a moment. We\u2019re repairing it right now,\u201d said the technical staff. Then, they hung up.</p><br/><p>At that moment, the technical staff looked at Master Lin as if awaiting the next instruction.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cThere\u2019s no hurry. Wait half an hour before fixing the elevator.\u201d</p><br/><p>The technical staff member nodded. \u201cUnderstood, Master Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang stared blankly at Lin Fan. \u201cBrother, you really are awesome.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled. \u201cWhat\u2019s so awesome about this? But I have to say, Ming Yang, you\u2019re way too soft. You didn\u2019t even dare to retaliate against this kind of trash.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang sighed. \u201cThis is different. This guy is from Huaizhou\u2019s Chu Family. His business influence is great. If it weren\u2019t for you, I wouldn\u2019t know what to do.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCheh. Business influence? Even a person who just runs a shop along Cloud Street can scold him until he doesn\u2019t dare to speak nonsense. But a big boss like you is scared?\u201d Lin Fan said with a laugh. Regarding this matter, he really felt that Ming Yang\u2019s courage was lacking.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang rolled his eyes. \u201cBrother, you can\u2019t say it like that. You only run a shop along Cloud Street? Even a ghost wouldn\u2019t believe that. Look at all the things you\u2019ve done. Those people were scared out of their wits.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, Ming Yang, you should learn from me. We can\u2019t look at how awesome the opposition is. If he\u2019s not human, we\u2019d have to be a little afraid. But as long as he\u2019s human, why should we be afraid of him? Look. Isn\u2019t he still in the elevator and wailing like a child?\u201d Lin Fan smiled as he said, \u201cBut what exactly happened between the two of you? Why did you suddenly start fighting?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang sighed. \u201cThis is a long story. I saw this guy showing off on a business forum, so I went to expose him. Then, we started arguing. You know the rest.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut brother, you\u2019re really too domineering. I can\u2019t help but admire you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved his hand indifferently. \u201cIt\u2019s not much.\u201d</p><br/><p>Half an hour later.</p><br/><p>The elevator came down.</p><br/><p>Chu Shen, who had been stuck in the elevator, had nearly fallen apart. When the elevator doors opened, it was as if he was welcomed into a new world.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere did that technical staff go? Why did he take so long?\u201d Upon coming out, Chu Shen started scolding. He even wanted to cause trouble for that technical staff member.</p><br/><p>But when he saw the two people sitting in front, his face instantly turned dark.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cChu Shen, do you have a problem? Did the elevator offend you? A perfectly fine elevator was broken by you. Just now, the technical staff had to change many parts to get the elevator repaired. Tell us. How are you going to compensate?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Shen was filled with rage. \u201cWhat do you mean by that? There was a problem with your elevator which caused us to be locked in for so long and now you want me to compensate?\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, Lin Fan took out his phone.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Chu Shen asked in a cold tone. He had no idea what this guy was taking out his phone for.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing. I\u2019m just calling the reporters. The person in charge of a big organization in Huaizhou doesn\u2019t have any morals at all. He kicked an elevator, causing it to stop and he still won\u2019t admit it. But it\u2019s fine. There are surveillance cameras in the elevator. I want to let the reporters have a look. I think they\u2019d definitely be interested.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Chu Shen heard this, he let out an expression as if to say \u2018You win.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, alright. I admit defeat today. Tell me how much I have to pay.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cMing Yang, how much does it cost to repair the elevator? Or would we have to get a new one?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang thought for a moment before replying, \u201cWhenever elevators in my company have a problem, we typically change it. This elevator isn\u2019t too expensive. It\u2019s a local product. Specially produced. Several tens of thousands will do. Maybe around 50 thousand.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you f*cking snatching money?\u201d When Chu Shen heard that, he burst out cursing. \u201cLet me tell you that you can\u2019t snatch money like that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cForget it, forget it. Hurry up and leave then, Chief Chu. I\u2019m going to call the reporters over and let the reporters see how Chief Chu doesn\u2019t pay his debts. My brother doesn\u2019t lack money anyway. He doesn\u2019t need a few tens of thousands from you.\u201d Lin Fan waved his hand and started dialing a number.</p><br/><p>*Beep beep!*</p><br/><p>At that moment, the call got through.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll pay,\u201d Chu Shen said in a deep tone. He had given in.</p><br/><p>They were clearly trying to screw with him. Moreover, these two people had clearly waited here for so long just to play around with him.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello? Master Lin. Master Lin\u2026\u201d the reporter\u2019s voice came from the phone.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I called the wrong number.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, he hung up.</p><br/><p>\u201cChief Chu, are you paying using a card or by cash?\u201d asked Lin Fan with a grin.</p><br/><p>Chu Shen looked at Lin Fan as he cursed maniacally in his heart. <em>You\u2019re f*cking retarded. Who would bring a few tens of thousands in cash?</em></p><br/><p>\u201cCard!\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

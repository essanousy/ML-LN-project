When they said they were going to take a picture of you, they were really going to do that. When they said they were going to expose you, they were really going to do it. There was no ambiguity or confusion about what they were going to do.</p><br/><p>\u201cStop taking photos,\u201d one of the thugs said, shielding his face with his hands. The camera hovered in front of their faces.</p><br/><p>\u201cI told you to stop taking photos.\u201d</p><br/><p>The journalists were still righteous on the inside. Although they occasionally used underhand tactics to obtain their news, one couldn\u2019t argue that they still ultimately fought for justice and goodness, unafraid to expose even the most intimidating of people.</p><br/><p>These thugs were blocking the patients from receiving treatment, prolonging their suffering. This was almost as good as taking their lives.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou guys have the guts to cause trouble but not the guts to face the camera?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat right. We\u2019ll take photos of your faces and post them online. Everyone who uses the Internet will be able to see who you are.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere isn\u2019t any point in covering your faces anymore. We\u2019ve already taken your pictures.\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporters continued their patter, capturing the thugs in every angle possible. They couldn\u2019t stop the reporters from posting their pictures online.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou guys win.\u201d The thugs couldn\u2019t throw the reporters off. The Internet was a massive killing machine and it was brutal, almost terrifying. They definitely didn\u2019t want to be infamous online, to become the target of ridicule. The thugs ran off with their tails between their legs.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed. This situation didn\u2019t even require him to do anything, and these guys just ran off. But this showed that these thugs still cared about their image. It would have been more troublesome if they had met thugs who didn\u2019t care about anything at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe should expose these guys online,\u201d the reporters said angrily.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved his hands. \u201cThank you, my fellow reporters. You guys have brought justice in face of unfairness.\u201d</p><br/><p>After hearing what the Godly Doctor said, the reporters couldn\u2019t help but laugh with their faces blushing. This was the first time they heard someone compliment them this much.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have nothing to worry about, Godly Doctor, Once everyone sees them, the effect would be irreversible.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan answered the reporters\u2019 questions while treating patients. To him, the reporters didn\u2019t really affect what he was doing.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing was still angry about what happened just now. However, he did have a change of heart in his view towards the reporters. They had a really strong sense of justice.</p><br/><p>Far away, in a limousine.</p><br/><p>Wu Tao was raging. \u201cWhy are you guys back here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBoss, there were reporters there and they were taking pictures of our faces. They said they were going to put them online. We were scared that other people would know who we are, so we ran back here,\u201d one of the thugs said helplessly.</p><br/><p>\u201cReporters? You guys are scared of reporters? Are they the ones that provide for you, or am I the one that provides for you? Furthermore, you\u2019ve done so little for me, and you\u2019re still scared that others will find out?\u201d Wu Tao was seething with anger. He never thought that his henchmen would be scared of reporters.</p><br/><p>Last time, he had asked his henchmen to go to the factory to beat all the migrant workers who asked for repayment and now, they were scared of this.</p><br/><p>All the thugs remained silent, heads hung low in shame. If Wu Tao had asked them to beat someone up, they would have done it without hesitation. However, if any news of his misdeeds got onto the internet, the people that would suffer most would be themselves. They would be the shame of the group.</p><br/><p>\u201cGo back. Wherever they go, you will follow and cause disruption.\u201d</p><br/><p>The thugs looked at their boss, not knowing what to say. Their hearts were racing. If you want it done, do it yourself! We don\u2019t want to go\u2026</p><br/><p>But they didn\u2019t dare to say that and just stood there silent.</p><br/><p>Wu Tao furrowed his brows in disgust. \u201cWhat? You\u2019re disobeying my command?\u201d</p><br/><p>Silence.</p><br/><p>Wu Tao\u2019s heart exploded with rage. \u201cYou guys\u2026 alright. You guys aren\u2019t reliable.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Tao took out his handphone and dialed the local mafia boss.</p><br/><p>\u201cChief Wu, what\u2019s up?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Hu, I need your help. Could you bring around ten of your men and cause some trouble outside Fu Bao Hospital? I\u2019ll pay you handsomely.\u201d</p><br/><p>After making the call, Wu Tao looked at his henchmen. They were usually very reliable, but now, even they were scared. Looking at the current situation, he had to hire professionals to complete the job.</p><br/><p>Not long after.</p><br/><p>Brother Hu brought his men over to Wu Tao, who was sitting in his limousine.</p><br/><p>\u201cChief Wu, what is the problem?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Tao pointed toward the direction of the hospital. \u201cThose volunteer medical workers over there. Use your own methods to make sure he doesn\u2019t get to see a single patient. Wherever he goes, you go there to cause trouble.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Tao was very petty. Since the Godly Doctor wouldn\u2019t see him, he wouldn\u2019t let the Godly Doctor see anyone else. Let\u2019s see how long the Godly Doctor can last like that.</p><br/><p>\u201cChief Wu, there are reporters over there\u2026\u201d Brother Hu said, looking at the scene.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? You\u2019re afraid of reporters?\u201d Wu Tao spurted.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course not. This just means the price would be a lot higher. I brought a total of fifteen of my men here and they are trained people. Not just anyone I picked off the street. Five hundred each for my men and two thousand for me, so a total of nine thousand five hundred dollars. Are you agreeable to that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you ten thousand.\u201d Ten thousand dollars to him was nothing. Sometimes, his meals cost more than that amount.</p><br/><p>Brother Hu grinned. \u201cAlright, don\u2019t you worry. I\u2019ll settle this problem for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Tao looked into the distance, smiling coldly.</p><br/><p>\u2018I\u2019ll get you this time\u2026\u201d Wu Tao thought to himself.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The patients were all smiles, overjoyed after getting treatment. \u201cThank you, Godly Doctor. You are like the reincarnation of the Buddha.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan\u2019s skills allowed his patients to experience instantaneous healing. Whatever ailments they had were cured immediately after his treatment. But still, the patients still had to take care of themselves, eat their prescribed medicines at the appropriate timing and also had to have adequate rest. The body rejuvenates itself at 1 o\u2019clock in the morning and the patients had to sleep before that to amplify the healing effects.</p><br/><p>Seventy percent medicine, thirty percent rest.</p><br/><p>No matter the condition, one could not just rely on medications to get better. They also had to take care of themselves and rest appropriately. Without sufficient rest, the medications would be useless.</p><br/><p>Chairman Bi looked on in awe. The Godly Doctor knew every single ailment at his fingertips, his knowledge of medicine was unparalleled and his acupuncture skills were just too amazing. It was just too unbelievable.</p><br/><p>Shocking!</p><br/><p>A master of the medical art at such a young age. If he hadn\u2019t seen it for himself, he would never have believed it.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing was used to the Godly Doctor\u2019s awesomeness after being around him for quite a while. His teacher\u2019s medical skills and knowledge was almost demonic. He knew how to treat every single illness and nothing was too hard for him.</p><br/><p>He had originally thought that all he needed was a little hard work to learn everything that his teacher knew and that it wouldn\u2019t be a problem.</p><br/><p>But now he realized that he would still never attain his teacher\u2019s standards even after twenty years of being his disciple.</p><br/><p>The more he saw his teacher treat his patients, the more he realized how inadequate his knowledge was.</p><br/><p>But he was contented being where he was. To be able to learn from his teacher the art of Chinese Medicine, he considered himself the luckiest doctor alive.</p><br/><p>\u201cNext patient,\u201d Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>The patients who were standing in the queue had been waiting for quite some time. However, they weren\u2019t in a hurry, since they knew that they would definitely be treated.</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone, move aside!\u201d</p><br/><p>Just at this moment, a loud, booming and evil voice spread across the area.</p><br/><p>The patients standing at the front all got shoved to one side.</p><br/><p>One look and anyone could tell that he was no good man.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked up, sighing helplessly, thinking of how much trouble they were going to cause.</p></div>\n</div>"}

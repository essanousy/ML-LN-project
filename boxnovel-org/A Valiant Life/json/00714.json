I thought that Master Lin was a good person and I never thought that he wouldn\u2019t be able to differentiate right from wrong. They\u2019re the child\u2019s only remaining relatives. Why won\u2019t he let the child go?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. We believe in what we\u2019ve seen for ourselves. They\u2019ve presented all the required documents. They\u2019re clearly the child\u2019s relatives.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone, say it together. Tell them to release the child!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRelease him!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRelease him!\u201d</p><br/><p>The voices kept getting louder and louder. The entire crowd had been fooled completely by Wang Cheng Shan and Qiu Yan Lan\u2019s pitiful performance.</p><br/><p>The crowd felt as if they were standing on the side of justice. They felt that only they were right and everyone else was evil.</p><br/><p>The townsfolk passing by outside heard this noise and stopped in their tracks.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on over there?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know but it seems like something major is happening. Let\u2019s go take a look.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><br/><p>The number of spectating townsfolk became higher and higher until they surrounded the entire Welfare Institute.</p><br/><p>When Wang Cheng Shan and Qiu Yan Lan saw this scene, they exchanged looks. Even they had not expected to attract so many people.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan took a deep breath. Sigh, these people\u2026</p><br/><p>At this moment, Qiu Yan Lan did something that caused the whole place to erupt.</p><br/><p>*thud*</p><br/><p>Qiu Yan Lan knelt down at the entrance of the Welfare Institute and let out a heartbreaking expression as she knocked her head onto the ground, making thudding sounds.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m begging you, give us back the child. We don\u2019t have children of our own and we just want to raise our nephew up as our own son. I\u2019m begging you, give us the child.\u201d</p><br/><p>Those cries of hers were extremely pitiful. It was simply too dramatic.</p><br/><p>When the surrounding crowd saw this scene, the fire in their hearts burst out completely.</p><br/><p>\u201cMotherf*ckers, are you going to release him or not?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou Welfare Institute people are too ridiculous. They\u2019ve already done this much, why won\u2019t you release the child?\u201d</p><br/><p>A big man stood out and said, \u201cSince I\u2019ve come across this situation today, I absolutely will not ignore it. I\u2019m giving you one minute. If you don\u2019t hand over the child, we\u2019re going in to snatch him.\u201d</p><br/><p>With someone taking the lead, the rest of the crowd became braver as they cheered the big man on from the side.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>When Director Huang saw this, a worried look appeared on her face. \u201cMaster Lin, what should we do now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan had not expected the crowd to become so riled up. However, he wasn\u2019t bothered by it. \u201cIt\u2019s not an issue. Just watch over the children. I\u2019ll resolve this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, the reporters arrived. When they saw the situation before them, they were dumbfounded as well. They had not expected things to have developed to such a stage. It was simply inconceivable.</p><br/><p>What could have caused all this outrage?</p><br/><p>Although the incident was still ongoing, news had already appeared on the Internet.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, Master Lin is in trouble this time. A large number of people have surrounded the Welfare Institute, asking for Master Lin to release the child. Otherwise, they\u2019re going in to snatch the child away.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat can\u2019t be.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t it be? I\u2019m at the scene right now. I have always believed in Master Lin but I don\u2019t dare to say anything right now. These old men here have all gone mad. If I speak well of Master Lin, I\u2019d definitely be beaten up.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy isn\u2019t the police there yet?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already called the police. They should be on the way now. Even the reporters have reached already.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBrothers, I\u2019m not in Shanghai right now. If I was, I would bring my Bros there and beat up those guys who are bullying Master Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Reporter Jiang stood in front of the metal gates. \u201cMaster Lin, I\u2019m Lil\u2019 Jiang from Qian Jiang News Agency. Can I ask you a few things?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, I\u2019m a reporter from People\u2019s News Agency. Could you comment on the current situation?\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporters were all asking questions as they stood in front of the metal gate. They wanted to know what exactly had happened. Usually, Master Lin would definitely not do such a thing. But now that things had gotten so out of hand and Master Lin still didn\u2019t want to release the child, it was a little suspicious.</p><br/><p>Why didn\u2019t Master Lin release the child?</p><br/><p>Was this child really so important?</p><br/><p>If there really was some kind of shady deal involved, why would he draw such public outrage just for a single child?</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at these reporters. After thinking for a moment, he said, \u201cYou can ask those two why they\u2019re in such a rush to take the child away.\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporters were taken aback as they wondered what Master Lin meant. But judging by the situation, they probably wouldn\u2019t be able to get any useful information from Master Lin.</p><br/><p>But at this moment, the young lady, Reporter Xiao Jiang, asked angrily, \u201cWhy won\u2019t you release the child? People like you are really disgusting.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Reporter Jiang heard his own colleague talk to Master Lin like that, he immediately held her back and said, \u201cXiao Jiang, how can you speak to Master Lin like that? Before the matter is settled, you can\u2019t speak about someone so emotionally. How can you not have such professional qualities as a reporter?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Jiang yanked her arm away from Reporter Jiang\u2019s grasp. \u201cI only believe what I\u2019ve seen for myself. If this man isn\u2019t doing this for his own benefit, why else would he not release the child?\u201d</p><br/><p>Reporter Jiang said apologetically, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Master Lin. She just started working and she\u2019s still young.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved his hand. \u201cI\u2019ll prove myself with the truth later on.\u201d</p><br/><p>He wasn\u2019t in a rush to prove himself. He wanted to see how many people would be deceived. Sometimes, when one thinks that he is doing something righteous, he could actually be taking the side of evil.</p><br/><p>However, Lin Fan didn\u2019t blame such people. He just wanted to etch a lesson into their memories so that they wouldn\u2019t just look at who\u2019s more pitiful when they are met with a situation like this. Sometimes, the pitiful side could be the evil side.</p><br/><p>The reporters surrounded Wang Cheng Shan and Qiu Yan Lan and started questioning them. The couple had already thought of what to say. In front of the reporters, they pretended to be very pitiful, saying that they were willing to beg and plead just for their nephew.</p><br/><p>When some of the reporters heard this, they were a little shaken. Could it be that they were right and it was indeed Master Lin who was in the wrong?</p><br/><p>But according to their knowledge of Master Lin, Master Lin was not such a person.</p><br/><p>At that moment, the reporters started to hesitate as they didn\u2019t know who to trust.</p><br/><p>If they had to choose, they would trust Master Lin more. However, Master Lin hadn\u2019t said anything and hadn\u2019t given any explanation at all. On the other hand, what this couple said seemed to be true and they seemed very pitiful.</p><br/><p>As a young lady, Xiao Jiang was rather emotional. Seeing how pitiful the couple was, she couldn\u2019t help but squat down and comfort them.</p><br/><p>Lil\u2019 Jiang shook his head. He felt that Xiao Jiang was still too young and she hadn\u2019t been trained enough. She was too easily affected by emotions. After all, there were many situations that would be suddenly reversed in the end.</p><br/><p>The police car arrived.</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian had personally brought a team down. When he had found out that a situation had broken out at Nanshan Children\u2019s Welfare Institute, he had no hesitation at all and he immediately brought his team down.</p><br/><p>But when he reached the destination and saw the scene, Liu Xiao Tian was completely dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>What the heck had happened? Why were so many people gathered here?</p><br/><p>Were they rioting?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

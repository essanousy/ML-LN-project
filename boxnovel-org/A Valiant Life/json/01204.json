He was a regular customer and he was definitely given the VIP treatment.</p><br/><p>However, when the manager saw one of the youngsters in the group of people, he gasped.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was chatting with a group of people. He just smiled and waved when he heard his name.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease, just enter.\u201d</p><br/><p>The manager served them personally and the other service crew were prevented from serving this group of customers.</p><br/><p>Everyone knew that Master Lin went to receive an important award.</p><br/><p>Perhaps there were still people who did not know about it yet. However, when the videos surface at night, things would definitely go crazy.</p><br/><p>The service crew did not know who the group of people were but when they heard that Master Lin was there, they were stunned. They quickly took out their phones and sneakily took photos of Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>If not for their manager, they would have rushed to him and asked for a picture together.</p><br/><p>\u201cPhew!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan heaved a sigh of relief after the long and exhausting day.</p><br/><p>It had been an emotional day for him too since he managed to interact with so many elders in person.</p><br/><p>\u201cSon.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, Mama Lin tugged Lin Fan\u2019s arm.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan asked, \u201cMum, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCome over for a moment,\u201d Mama Lin said.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan and the others just sat at the table with the others. Even though they did not know what she wanted to talk to him about, they could feel that it had something to do with them.</p><br/><p>They stared at each other and smiled before continuing with their conversation about what happened earlier.</p><br/><p>Outside.</p><br/><p>\u201cMum, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d Lin Fan asked.</p><br/><p>Mama Lin took a glance at the situation inside. \u201cSon, what are you doing? I can tell what the ladies think of you. I also know what you\u2019re thinking.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. \u201cMum, what can you tell?\u201d</p><br/><p>Mama Lin replied, \u201cI gave birth to you. How could I not know? You should quickly make a decision and not waste their time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMum, you\u2019re maligning me. I\u2019m not wasting their time.\u201d Lin Fan helplessly waved his hand at her.</p><br/><p>Mama Lin glared at him. \u201cFine, let\u2019s just say I\u2019m maligning you. Just like how a housefly can still penetrate a flawless egg, if you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWait, mum, what you just said doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d</p><br/><p>He was stunned. The analogy seemed a little unique and if the ladies were to hear it, they would probably be furious about it.</p><br/><p>When did they become houseflies?</p><br/><p>At that moment, Wang Ming Yang appeared. \u201cHey, you\u2019re here. We\u2019ve been looking for you. Let\u2019s head inside now.\u201d</p><br/><p>At the same time, he looked at Mama Lin and asked curiously, \u201cAunty, what are you doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMing Yang, which of the few ladies inside suits my son the most?\u201d Mama Lin asked. It was not easy to get her son to speak the truth. She had no choice but to target Wang Ming Yang.</p><br/><p>After all, he was his son\u2019s close friend and he would know it better than her.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang did not really think too deeply about it. \u201cI think all of them are suitable.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026 How can that be? You have to choose one of them,\u201d Mama Lin said.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang replied, \u201cAunty, that\u2019s a really tough thing to do. Just get him to choose one of them. With his capabilities, he can definitely afford any of them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d Lin Fan glared at Wang Ming Yang.</p><br/><p>Mama Lin shook her head. \u201cHow can he choose all of them? Isn\u2019t that illegal?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang smiled awkwardly. \u201cYeah, it\u2019s illegal. Alright, I\u2019ll head inside first. Bro, you can continue to chat with your mum. Just come in soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>He felt that the topic was a little difficult to answer and he decided not to be involved anymore.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, wait for me. Let\u2019s go in together. Mum, we can talk about this when we get back. Let\u2019s eat first,\u201d Lin Fan said. He did not know what else to say to his mum.</p><br/><p>This was a frustrating subject to discuss about anyway.</p><br/><p>Mama Lin sighed. She did not manage to find out anything from her son. She obviously could not make the decision for him since it would only cause people to gossip about her.</p><br/><p>However, bigamy is a crime and she could not let her son do illegal things like this.</p><br/><p>She was actually pretty satisfied with these few ladies but it was not up to her to decide. It had to depend on Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>She did not want to think about it anymore. After all, youngsters these days do not really care about relationships. It was not like the past where it was difficult for couples to separate.</p><br/><p>At the dining table.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang said, \u201cBro, what your mum said is meaningful. Don\u2019t you think my suggestion was decent? You should find out more about it. It might really work.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEat your food.\u201d Lin Fan placed a piece of meat into Wang Ming Yang\u2019s bowl.</p><br/><p>Then, he looked at the other table. Wu You Lan and the other ladies were chatting with his parents. They seemed to be having a great time.</p><br/><p>He decided to not think about it anymore and continued eating.</p><br/><p>He could not return home and he had to go to Elder Zheng\u2019s house at night.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang shook his head and looked at his best friend who was usually straightforward and brave but he could not treat this matter the same.</p><br/><p>If it was him, he would have gathered them around and asked all of them about it.</p><br/><p>Just a simple question could solve everything.</p><br/><p>Although he was envious of him, he was loyal to Xu Zi Le and he did not want to be related to these ladies.</p><br/><p>At the other table, Mama Lin smiled. \u201cI really like all of you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan and the others smiled upon hearing that.</p><br/><p>\u201cI wonder who my future daughter-in-law would be,\u201d Mama Lin sighed and looked at the expressions on their faces.</p><br/><p>In the end, she managed to figure out their expressions.</p><br/><p>To Mama Lin, it was a rather complicated task to accomplish.</p><br/><p>Of course, besides Liu Xu, the others seemed to look uneasy.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, let\u2019s eat.\u201d Mama Lin did not want to say anything more. She just wanted to see their reactions.</p><br/><p>She felt that something was wrong.</p><br/><p>She wondered why her son had to be involved with several of them at once. She wanted to discuss about it with Lin Fan\u2019s dad after the meal.</p><br/><p>The restaurant was booming with life.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang loved to stir things up and many people started to drink.</p><br/><p>If they did not have any chauffeurs, they would have had to stay there for the entire meal.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

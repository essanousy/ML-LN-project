Things are getting out of hand.\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-1\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>He hadn\u2019t expected things to turn out this way. He had passed the medicinal pill to Yang Yuan out of pity. At the same time, it was also because they had been somewhat fated to meet.</p><br/><p>After all, he still had a long way to go and his house was a great location for him to rest. The fact that Yang Yuan\u2019s brother had been really ill meant that he had to do something about it.</p><br/><p>However, things were different now.</p><br/><p>How many leukemia patients were there in the country?</p><br/><p>He really didn\u2019t know and he didn\u2019t want to know. Now that the news had been reported, who knew how many people would come to him to seek help?</p><br/><p>Even if he was a god, he wouldn\u2019t be able to handle it.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-2\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Medicinal pills were difficult to concoct and it was impossible to mass-produce them.</p><br/><p>He had to think of a solution. If not, things would definitely worsen.</p><br/><p>He immediately started his car to return home.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>In the afternoon, 3 PM.</p><br/><p>Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan appeared, the shop owners gathered around him.</p><br/><p>Elder Liang said, \u201cLittle Boss, is everything in the news true?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded and replied calmly, \u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Liang stared at Little Boss in disbelief. He felt that Little Boss was really too incredible and it was becoming a little scary.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-3\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cHow are you going to resolve this? I saw online that a lot of people are going to come to Cloud Street to look for you. Even if you hide, you wouldn\u2019t be able to hide forever,\u201d Elder Liang said.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy should I hide? I didn\u2019t do anything wrong. It\u2019s okay. I can settle this,\u201d Lin Fan replied. Although he had messed up a little, it wasn\u2019t going to hurt anybody. He didn\u2019t see the need to hide at all.</p><br/><p>He was probably destined to live such a life.</p><br/><p>He had helped the young lady recover her looks and gone away for a few days to avoid any trouble but something bad still happened.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, things had even become worse.</p><br/><p>Some things weren\u2019t that easy to resolve now.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian was standing at the door and waiting. When he saw Lin Fan, he immediately ran over and said anxiously, \u201cYou\u2019re finally back. If not, things would have been impossible to resolve.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan felt a little helpless. \u201cWhat\u2019s up with you again?\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian replied, \u201cThose medical suppliers haven\u2019t left yet. They\u2019ve been waiting for you to return. They visited us every single day.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. \u201cWhat\u2019s so bad about that? Did you read the news online? There are worse things to follow. Brace yourself.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Fraud Tian felt that his workload had suddenly increased and things were going to become more stressful.</p><br/><p>He walked into the shop.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-4\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang, Wu You Lan, and the others rushed over. They had not seen Lin Fan for quite some time and they had really missed him.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Lin, how are you going to resolve the situation?\u201d Zhao Zhong Yang asked.</p><br/><p>If it had been a typical person, he or she would\u2019ve laughed his head off about the rubbish that the news reported. However, they couldn\u2019t just laugh about it since it was about Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Things were really out of hand and typical people wouldn\u2019t be able to handle things like this.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan heaved a sigh. Although he felt that it was going to be tedious, he still felt that it was manageable. \u201cI don\u2019t have a solution yet. Don\u2019t be anxious. I will definitely think of something. My return to Shanghai has definitely been reported. Things should be okay today. I\u2019m afraid it\u2019ll be chaotic tomorrow. Let me go back and think about it carefully.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI guess that\u2019s the only way now,\u201d Zhao Zhong Yang replied.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan was really worried. \u201cBrother Lin, why not try hiding again?\u201d</p><br/><p>She felt that the best solution was for Lin Fan to hide again and return after things became better.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cThere\u2019s no need for me to hide. It\u2019s not good to do so anyway. It\u2019s okay. It doesn\u2019t matter what happens tomorrow. I\u2019ll think on my feet. Anyway, it\u2019s not a bad thing after all. Don\u2019t be afraid.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan stayed in the shop for a short while before leaving.</p><br/><p>Before he thought of a solution, he felt that it was better to leave.</p><br/><p>As he drove, he stopped his car at a random sidewalk and called Zhao Ming Qing.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher.\u201d The call got through.</p><br/><p>\u201cMing Qing, you should know what happened, right?\u201d Lin Fan asked.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-5\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing was still dumbfounded after seeing the news. He hadn\u2019t expected his teacher to be able to treat such a difficult illness. It was simply unbelievable.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, I know about it,\u201d Zhao Ming Qing replied.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan felt that if someone else were to think of a solution with him, it would definitely be easier to resolve this problem.</p><br/><p>\u201cMing Qing, tell me, how should I resolve this? You should know what\u2019s going to happen tomorrow. The reporters are going to come and I believe many leukemia patients will be coming too. It\u2019s going to be a difficult situation,\u201d Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing remained silent for a short while. \u201cTeacher, you used the medicinal pills to cure the illnesses. If you handle this on your own, it\u2019d be impossible. There are so many leukemia patients in the country. If you want to resolve it all at once, it\u2019s extremely difficult.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, could we just research and develop a prescription to cure leukemia? Just like how we did it previously,\u201d Zhao Ming Qing asked.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shook his head and replied, \u201cIt\u2019s almost impossible. I don\u2019t feel confident in coming up with the prescription.\u201d</p><br/><p>He knew the situation about the medicinal pills and how difficult the situation was.</p><br/><p>Firstly, the mystical boost of the Encyclopedia wasn\u2019t something that could be replaced. Also, the magical essence of the medicinal pill wasn\u2019t something that could be produced by a machine.\u201d</p><br/><p>Without the mystical boost of the Encyclopedia, things weren\u2019t going to be effective.</p><br/><p>According to the Encyclopedia description about the medicinal pills, pill concoction required spiritual energy which wasn\u2019t something that could be found on Earth. They had to depend on the mystical boost of the Encyclopedia for that.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf not, I really can\u2019t think of a solution,\u201d Zhao Ming Qing replied.</p><br/><p>If he tried to use medicinal pills to eliminate leukemia, the chances of that succeeding would be almost zero. He\u2019d probably die of fatigue.</p><br/><p>\u201cForget it. Come to Cloud Street tomorrow. I will discuss it with you further and see how it goes. If we can\u2019t come up with something to cure leukemia instantly, we can try to produce something that would cure it gradually.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although he said that he wasn\u2019t afraid, he was actually pretty scared of what was to come.</p><br/><p>Wasn\u2019t he implying that there was a possibility for them to come up with a prescription?</p><br/><p>He was probably doomed.</p><br/><p>He felt miserable for not reading the future in advance and seeing this coming.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, Teacher. I will be on time tomorrow.\u201d Zhao Ming Qing was feeling really confident. If he was alone in this, he would probably have no confidence at all. However, he was feeling really confident as he had the help of his mentor.</p><br/><p>His mentor was extraordinary. How could they not successfully develop the prescription?</p><br/><p>However, little did he know that his teacher was feeling miserable too.</p><br/><p>The news on the Internet had reached the climax. A lot of netizens were talking about it.</p><br/><p>Several medical professors had been arguing against the news. They were doubtful of the credibility of the reports.</p><br/><p>However, Specialist Mao was the department head of the leukemia department of his hospital. He was considered an influential individual. Furthermore, the kid had been cured in his hospital. The reports and medical history were all present. How could they be fake?</p><br/><p>If he had really made fake reports, he would be tarnishing his reputation.</p></div>\n</div>"}

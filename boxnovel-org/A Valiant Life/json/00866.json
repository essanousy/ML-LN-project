The scallion pancakes were truly delicious to them. Although it was difficult to purchase them, they really liked the atmosphere that it brought.</p><br/><p>It was because they had a glimpse of hope every day.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn! He ran away again.\u201d</p><br/><p>One of the townsfolk was shocked. It was clear that he didn\u2019t understand what had just happened.</p><br/><p>In the shop.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-2\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Fraud Tian had been waiting for Lin Fan a long time and he felt that something was wrong.</p><br/><p>After thinking about what had happened the day before, he suddenly understood that the fella had run away.</p><br/><p>\u201cTo think I trusted him so much. He actually ran away again!\u201d Fraud Tian felt like crying to himself. What was he supposed to do now?</p><br/><p>He looked at the townsfolk that gathered outside and he didn\u2019t know how to answer them at all.</p><br/><p>Ever since he had been awarded with three Michelin stars, the number of people that queued up had been steadily increasing. If no proper answer were to be given to them, the customers would definitely not take it lightly.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan sighed, \u201cFraud, go and explain to them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMe again?\u201d Fraud Tian\u2019s eyes widened in disbelief.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t expect them to rely on him for a matter like this.</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang looked at Fraud Tian and said, \u201cYou\u2019re in charge of the shop now. If not you, who else?\u201d</p><br/><p>He was speechless. He went to the entrance and looked at the townsfolk in the queue. He didn\u2019t know how to tell them about it.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-3\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cUmm\u2026 Um, Master Lin is out of town. There won\u2019t be any scallion pancakes for sale today and probably the upcoming days,\u201d Fraud Tian mustered his courage and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><br/><p>Indeed, the townsfolk were furious.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian sighed helplessly and tried to settle the crowd down.</p><br/><p>On the expressway.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was driving and humming a song. He felt really great to be able to escape from everything once in a while.</p><br/><p>It was awesome to be traveling freely.</p><br/><p>He could practically go anywhere he wanted.</p><br/><p>However, after thinking for a moment, he thought of a good spot to go. Since his life hadn\u2019t been really peaceful lately, he felt that it was a good idea for him to visit the Taoist temples to interact with the priests there. If he could forge strong bonds with them, his next Encyclopedic task might allow him to become an immortal. That would be awesome.</p><br/><p>He navigated his way on his phone.</p><br/><p>Wuxiang Taoist Temple.</p><br/><p>Although it was a little far, it was normal for him to be driving further than usual for a solo trip.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-4\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>He didn\u2019t want to think about the situation at his shop. Anyway, Fraud Tian was there to help maintain peace and order. Even if he were to be flamed by people, Fraud Tian would be able to take care of the situation.</p><br/><p>*Ding ding*</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing called.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher,\u201d Zhao Ming Qing said ecstatically through the phone.</p><br/><p>\u201cMing Qing, what is it?\u201d Lin Fan asked.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing called Lin Fan after reading the news. \u201cTeacher, was the student cured by the pill?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, why did you only find out about it now?\u201d Lin Fan asked. He was pretty impressed with his disciple.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have been busy writing a Chinese medicine book. I just read the news today and decided to give you a call.\u201d Zhao Ming Qing wanted to spread the knowledge of Chinese medicine through his books.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s great to hear that you\u2019re going to publish books. I am currently driving to somewhere and I would need some time before I return. I will take a look at it after you\u2019ve completed it,\u201d Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing smiled after hearing what he said. If his mentor were to oversee the publication of the books, they would be of even higher value. However, he was curious, \u201cTeacher, why did you leave?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said helplessly, \u201cIt\u2019s all because of the pills. Now that this has been made known to the public, a lot of people would definitely come to Cloud Street for it. In order to avoid the trouble, I have decided to leave for the time being.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing understood the situation clearly. The pills that his mentor concocted were law-defying and a lot of people would definitely look for him for it. Therefore, a short getaway seemed like a good idea.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, please be careful. If you require any assistance, you can give me a call,\u201d Zhao Ming Qing said.</p><br/><p>\u201cSure.\u201d He was pretty satisfied with his disciple for being so caring.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-5\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>However, since he was driving, he didn\u2019t want to talk for too long.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>At Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian tried really hard and wasted a lot of saliva to subdue the crowd.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t know how to reply to them when they asked him when would Master Lin return. He had no control at all.</p><br/><p>In the afternoon.</p><br/><p>There were no customers in the shop.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian and the others were really bored. Suddenly, a group of people came.</p><br/><p>As the representative of a medical firm, Li Yang came to discuss a possible collaboration with Master Lin.</p><br/><p>\u201cMay I know if Master Lin is in?\u201d Li Yang asked.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian looked at them in shock. He didn\u2019t know why these people came.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d Fraud Tian asked.</p><br/><p>Li Yang replied, \u201cHi, I am a representative of a medical firm. I am here to look for Master Lin to discuss a possible collaboration. May I know if he is in?\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, Fraud Tian understood what was going on. He knew why the fella decided to run away. Master Lin knew that trouble was brewing.</p><br/><p>However, it was not right. Why did he have to run? He could just explain things to them.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe is not in. He just left today and I don\u2019t know when he\u2019ll return,\u201d Fraud Tian replied.</p><br/><p>Li Yang felt helpless after hearing that. Then, he took out his name card. \u201cMy number is on this card. If Master Lin returns, please tell me about it. I\u2019ll be waiting in Shanghai.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Fraud Tian was stunned. He didn\u2019t expect this fella to be prepared to stay in Shanghai until Master Lin returned.</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t have done anything but accept the name card.</p><br/><p>After Li Yang left, another group of people came.</p><br/><p>\u201cMay I know if Master Lin is here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian looked at them and repeated what he had said to Li Yang previously.</p><br/><p>After sending them away.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian felt really helpless. \u201cWhat are these people trying to do? Why are there so many waves of them?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang was busy playing with his phone. \u201cWhat else could they do? They\u2019re here to collaborate with Brother Lin. Looks like he made the right decision to hide. If not, he\u2019d be in trouble.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s not talk about it for now. Another group of people has arrived. Fraud, you can continue talking to them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian didn\u2019t even have any time to react. He turned around and saw another group of people.</p><br/><p>It was devastating. It looked like the crowds weren\u2019t going to stop.</p><br/><p><em>F*ck!</em></p><br/><p>If he had known about this, he would probably have escaped too. He was indeed left with another mess.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>At night.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, what is this stupid navigation system? Why did I end up here?\u201d He drove at a steady speed since he left and he had been following the navigation system. However, he realized that something was wrong. The roads were getting narrower and steeper. It was really frustrating.</p><br/><p>Especially since it was getting dark and there was nowhere for him to rest.</p><br/><p>However, it looked like there was an accommodation in front. He decided to talk to them and see if he could spend the night there.</p><br/><p>He did not want to sleep in the car.</p><br/><p>If he did not open the windows, he would probably die in the car.</p></div>\n</div>"}

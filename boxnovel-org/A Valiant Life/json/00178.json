To people in the celebrities' circle, they definitely wouldn't dare. But so what if they didn't dare? That didn't mean that Lin Fan wouldn't dare.</p><br/><p>Everyone, please continue to spam me, or get even more people to spam me!</p><br/><p>Right now, he was just pouring more fuel into the fire, making it an even larger flame.</p><br/><p>This matter seemed to have been censored for unknown reasons. Weibo was blocking out all the news regarding this matter. At the same time, Starlight Film School was announcing the final conclusion.</p><br/><p>The conclusion was that the reporter had a mental disability and had given his report under the influence of his mental illness.</p><br/><p>If there were to be no follow-up to the news with each passing day, such a matter would vanish without a trace within a day or two. With nobody paying attention to it, it would disappear like smoke vanishing into thin air.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the situation on Weibo. It wasn't enough. He decided to probe further at the celebrities' Weibo. As long as they were Starlight Film School graduates, he would spam them all, disregarding which faculty they graduated from.</p><br/><p>Man Ting Chao was a hugely popular star. He had acted in several big IP movies and won various awards. Even though he was over forty, many young ladies still regarded him as their number one male star.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan: \"@ManTingChao You're the student of two old b*stards! What a surprise! I really look down on you now...\"</p><br/><p>Man Ting Chao was currently advertising his new film when he saw the Weibo. He was stunned for a moment. Who the hell is this guy? What does he mean?</p><br/><p>After researching for a bit, he found out that this Master Lin was arguing with Jiang Li and Chen Juan, and they were on awfully bad terms with each other. Even though he had graduated from Starlight Film School, he had zero connections with those two people.</p><br/><p>Man Ting Chao: \"What are you talking about?\"</p><br/><p>He wanted to find out what exactly Lin Fan meant, but Lin Fan didn't care about any of this. He had already begun probing other celebrities' Weibos.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan: \"@SummerFlower, you actually dare to support those two old b*stards? I really look down on you.\"</p><br/><p>Summer Flower was a famous actress. She was very pretty, and thus enjoyed the favor of many fans. However, at that moment, she got randomly scolded by this Master Lin for no reason and was stunned. What is this guy doing? Could it be that he's a brainless Internet troll?</p><br/><p>Since when did I support those two people?</p><br/><p>Lin Fan continuously searched for more than ten other famous celebrities, and somehow linked the two old b*stards to them, regardless of anything.</p><br/><p>All this was done just to thoroughly and completely piss off the fans of those celebrities.</p><br/><p>Even though his personal Weibo had millions of followers, it was useless. Most of them were just there to join the hype. He had angered so many celebrities, which would definitely lead to the retaliation from their fans.</p><br/><p>He took a look at his Weibo, but decided not to look through it anymore after seeing such a tragic sight. Those fans were scolding him so much that he didn't know what to say anymore.</p><br/><p>However, he had already achieved his objective.</p><br/><p>Haha!</p><br/><p>They wanted to wait for the news to die down before dealing with it. How could he give them such a chance?</p><br/><p>As for the fans of Master Lin, they felt that he had gone insane.</p><br/><p>When Jiang Li and Chen Juan looked at their Weibo, all they could do was laugh. He was indeed a madman. They didn't even have to deal with this matter by themselves. They could just leave it to their fans to sort him out.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan was momentarily stunned. \"Master Lin, you have really enraged the beast this time. Nothing bad will happen right?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed, \"This is exactly what I wanted.\"</p><br/><p>Wu Tian He laughed, \"Sometimes when nothing is reported, we have to take it into own hands. It might even have a better outcome. You wouldn't already have the evidence, would you?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shook his head, \"Not for the time being.\"</p><br/><p>After scolding more than ten over celebrities, Lin Fan had started an all-out war on Weibo. Once he was done with scolding people on Weibo, he closed it. He had already achieved his objective and didn't need to care about it anymore. What mattered most then was whether or not he could get the evidence.</p><br/><p>He didn't know what the situation was with his old computer back at home. He wasn't sure if he had gathered any useful evidence.</p><br/><p>Nighttime.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan reached home. He arrived in front of the old computer, hopeful that it had managed to gather evidence.</p><br/><p>When he looked at the screen, he was momentarily stunned. All the windows on the screen had disappeared. It seemed that the computer program hadn't been successful.</p><br/><p>Just like that, those 100 Encyclopedic Points might as well have been flushed down the toilet bowl. Without the necessary evidence, there was zero chance that the situation could be turned around. Everything that he had done in the day would have been for nothing.</p><br/><p>\"Hey!\" To Lin Fan's amazement, there were two folders on the desktop of the computer. The folders were even named!</p><br/><p>Jiang Li!</p><br/><p>Chen Juan!</p><br/><p>Burning with excitement, he sat down and hurriedly opened one of the folders.</p><br/><p>He took a glance at it. There was only ten minutes worth of videos. As for the content, there was no way he would know what it was about. He had to watch it at least once.</p><br/><p>A display popped up. It showed the interior of an office. It seemed that it was showing what Jiang Li's phone was recording, and it was nicely placed facing Chen Juan.</p><br/><p>Chen Juan: \"Starlight Film School has already helped us suppress this matter. What do these netizens think they can do?\"</p><br/><p>Jiang Li: \"The media doesn't even dare to expose this matter. Only this guy with only a few million followers on Weibo dares to challenge us. I really don't know where he gets his bravery from.\"</p><br/><p>Chen Juan: \"Xia Yi Mo's father has agreed to our request to admit that she has clinical depression. Are you really prepared to take her back in next year?\"</p><br/><p>Jiang Li: \"Do you think that's possible? It would be too late by then. And did I even that before? Did I agree to any of his conditions? But if I take her back in next year and force it on her again, don't you think that's even better?\"</p><br/><p>Chen Juan laughed but immediately changed to a stern-looking face. \"Elder Jiang, you should do less of these immoral things in future. This time, you met someone that doesn't fear death. If it weren't for these special reasons, something might really have happened.\"</p><br/><p>\"Relax. What could happen? Unless they decide to come here and mess around.\"</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>Looking at the video, Lin Fan was enraged. However, he was more excited that he had finally gotten the evidence. The Encyclopedia wasn't just any encyclopedia, but also produced awesome results! It had taken all the useful videos and put them together.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, the video also showed a lot more infuriating content. Even after they did all that, Jiang Li still continued his nasty acts. He still dared to book a room with one of his students. But of course, the Encyclopedia blurred out the face of this female student, giving her a chance.</p><br/><p>Another video showed Chen Juan inviting a superior for dinner. After which, they did some shameful acts.</p><br/><p>As of now, these videos were the best evidence he had and was enough to cause them to be in deep trouble. If this won't work, then there wasn't anything else he could do.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan downloaded the videos onto his phone. Tomorrow would be the day to expose them.</p><br/><p>He was content, and he let out a sigh of relief.</p><br/><p>He didn't regret getting involved in this case, nor was he scared. Even if people dared to come to his doorstep, what could they do?</p><br/><p>His Ba Gua Zhang was no joke.</p><br/><p>Of course, these were just his thoughts. Ultimately, he had to remain calm. As for the videos, where would he say they came from? Of course, he had gotten them unintentionally when he had been downloading other movies.</p><br/><p>Who knew which b*stard had uploaded it?</p><br/><p>After going through so much trouble to download a few gigabytes of movies, in the end, all he got was this nonsense?</p><br/><p>Of course, the Encyclopedia was still rather humane. The computer displayed a lightning bolt icon, and he was still downloading several tens of gigabytes of movies.</p><br/><p>As for the names of these movies, they were really not appropriate to be seen.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

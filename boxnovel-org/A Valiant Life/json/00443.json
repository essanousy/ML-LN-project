Must we really drink?\u201d</p><br/><p>Young Huang was feeling the same. \u201cWhat else can we do? It\u2019s not like you haven\u2019t seen what\u2019s going on. Although we don\u2019t know any information about this person, Jin Sheng Wen didn\u2019t even dare to stand up for Young Jiang. You can imagine what kind of background he has.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s find reinforcements. I won\u2019t believe that nobody in Beijing can suppress him,\u201d said Young Zhao.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho will we find? Tell me. Don\u2019t even think about calling your family. You\u2019ve already seen the situation. Forget it, just drink.\u201d Young Huang didn\u2019t want to speak any further. This time, they had to admit defeat. He looked at the bottle of alcohol in his hands and an incomparable sense of fear rose up in his heart. However, he gritted his teeth and gulped down the alcohol.</p><br/><p>Outside.</p><br/><p>Jin Sheng Wen looked at Lin Fan. In his mind, he was wondering who the heck this was. However, he didn\u2019t seem familiar. It was clear that he simply did not know this man.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang stumbled forward like a drunkard, \u201cHey, why are you here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan sighed and was a little annoyed, \u201cI came early. Did you really get yourself drunk?\u201d</p><br/><p><em>sob sob</em> Suddenly, Wang Ming Yang started crying. A grown man suddenly started crying and this caused Lin Fan to jump up from the shock. \u201cI knew you would come. I was forced to drink and I\u2019m too sullen so I had to drink.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan took out his phone and didn\u2019t say a word. He started recording. He filmed Wang Ming Yang\u2019s current state while Wang Ming Yang continued to talk. He was saying things that he would never say if he was sober. However, now that he was drunk, all kinds of disgusting things came out from his mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, alright, stop feeling wronged. I\u2019ve already helped you regain your face,\u201d said Lin Fan as he patted Wang Ming Yang on the shoulder.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang continued sobbing. Suddenly, he squatted down and waved his hand, saying, \u201cDon\u2019t touch me. I need to squat down for a moment.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shook his head. He was really wasted. But it was normal. Seeing how Wang Ming Yang was squatting down there, Lin Fan kept his phone. What he needed to record had been recorded. He would show it to Wang Ming Yang tomorrow. Lin Fan wondered what kind of expression he would make when he saw it.</p><br/><p>However, it was good that he puked out the alcohol in time, otherwise, he wouldn\u2019t just be walking unstably, he would just collapse onto the ground. In his state, he wouldn\u2019t even know what happened.</p><br/><p>Lil\u2019 Wang stood there, waiting for Master Lin to speak. If Master Lin said it was over, then it would be over. If he said it wasn\u2019t over, then it wouldn\u2019t be over.</p><br/><p>Wu Yun Gang\u2019s jaw had already dropped. How the situation unfolded was completely beyond his expectations. He didn\u2019t know how Master Lin had so much power in Beijing. He only knew that Master Lin ran a shop and was a mysterious person. However, that day had completely changed his impression of Master Lin.</p><br/><p>If Wang Ming Yang hadn\u2019t been messed with, he might not have been able to see Master Lin act out violently.</p><br/><p>Putting it in an unpleasant manner, it was being arrogant and overbearing, not giving anyone any respect. He didn\u2019t keep his unhappiness to himself, instead, he let it burst out.</p><br/><p>As for how Wang Ming Yang was able to get along so well with Master Lin, Wu Yun Gang felt envious over that.</p><br/><p>Master Lin did all this just for Wang Ming Yang.</p><br/><p>But it was a shame. Wang Ming Yang was already drunk and he had no idea what had happened.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Lin Fan pointed at Sister Yan.</p><br/><p>\u201cMe\u2026\u201d Sister Yan was startled. She was a little afraid and even a little nervous.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan raised the bottle of alcohol in his hand and said, \u201cI remember you. You were involved too. Seeing that you\u2019re a lady, I won\u2019t make it hard on you. Just drink one bottle and this matter will be over.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sister Yan looked at her brother-in-law. Although she had gone through a lot at the Tian Yun Villa, she was really afraid in the face of such a situation.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan probed her, \u201cWhat? Is there a problem?\u201d</p><br/><p>Sister Yan lowered her posture and said, \u201cBrother, I\u2026I can\u2019t drink. I\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>If she drank the whole bottle, she would definitely lose consciousness. She might even end up in the hospital.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you can\u2019t drink, then why did you tell my friend to drink so much? Do you think it\u2019s fun? No problem, I have a lot of time today. I can play with you slowly.\u201d Lin Fan didn\u2019t care that she was a lady or even a beautiful lady. In his eyes, everyone was the same.</p><br/><p>Jin Sheng Wen went forward. He was ready to take responsibility for this situation. No matter what, she was still his sister-in-law and also his confidante. He couldn\u2019t watch her down the whole bottle.</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung Lin\u2026\u201d Judging from how Wu Yun Gang had addressed him, this man\u2019s surname was Lin and regardless of his background, he should be called \u2018Young Lin\u2019.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved his hand and said, \u201cDon\u2019t call me Young Lin. I don\u2019t like to be addressed like that. You can call me Master Lin. Also, who are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jin Sheng Wen didn\u2019t know this man\u2019s background and he felt very nervous. \u201cMaster Lin, she\u2019s my sister-in-law. If there are any problems, allow me to compensate. She\u2019s a lady and she can\u2019t drink. Could I drink in her place? I understand the rules. Two bottles.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan let out a thin smile, \u201cYou want to substitute your sister-in-law?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, please be benevolent and forgive her,\u201d said Jin Sheng Wen.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright,\u201d said Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother-in-law\u2026\u201d Sister Yan was very worried. If he drank two bottles, how would he still be conscious?</p><br/><p>Jin Sheng Wen waved his hand and received the bottle from Lin Fan. Then, he got someone to fetch him another bottle. Without another word, he immediately downed the bottle.</p><br/><p>Wines with high alcohol content cause a burning sensation upon entering the stomach. They can make someone collapse instantly.</p><br/><p>However, Jin Sheng Wen resisted it until his face turned red. Without taking a single breath, he finished the whole bottle. His chest puffed as if he was about to puke. However, he resisted it with all his might, took the second bottle and raised it to his mouth.</p><br/><p>A short while later.</p><br/><p>Jin Sheng Wen panted slightly and said, \u201cMaster Lin, I\u2019ve finished drinking. Is this okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan applauded him, \u201cGood. Not bad at all. Although you\u2019re not a good person, you have a strong will. Lil\u2019 Wang, let\u2019s go. This matter is settled.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Yun Gang supported Wang Ming Yang as they left the place.</p><br/><p>After Lin Fan and the rest had left, Jin Sheng Wen\u2019s body was very unstable and he knelt on the ground. He opened his mouth and puked furiously. What he puked out was all alcohol.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother-in-law, are you okay?\u201d Sister Yan\u2019s eyes had turned red and she was filled with worry. She was afraid that something might happen to her brother-in-law.</p><br/><p>Jin Sheng Wen waved his hand, \u201cI\u2019m okay, I\u2019m okay. This matter is over. In future, don\u2019t offend people. This time, it was someone who could be negotiated with. If it wasn\u2019t someone like that, things would have turned out different.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sister Yan nodded, \u201cI understand, Brother-in-law. I\u2019ll support you over there to rest.\u201d</p><br/><p>He had downed two bottles. Even if he was even more unyielding, he wouldn\u2019t have been able to take it.</p><br/><p>In the private room</p><br/><p>Young Zhao and Young Huang hadn\u2019t even finished one bottle. They had already puked all over the place. They really couldn\u2019t keep drinking but they didn\u2019t know that Lin Fan had already left so they kept on trying.</p><br/><p>The waiters came.</p><br/><p>The two of them barked, \u201cWhat are you looking at?\u201d</p><br/><p>The waiter was a little frightened, \u201cYoung Zhao, Young Huang, that man has already left.\u201d</p><br/><p>When the two of them heard this, they immediately flung the bottle away from their hands. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you say so earlier?\u201d Then, they collapsed onto the ground, not wanting to move at all.</p><br/><p>They were too fatigued. They were really way too fatigued. They felt as if they had almost lost their lives.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

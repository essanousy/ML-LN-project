That\u2019s strange. What are these reporters here for?\u201d Lin Fan was doubtful. He didn\u2019t know why these reporters had come for. Could it be because of the Ma Qingzhou matter? It shouldn\u2019t be. Ma Qingzhou was only infamous in Qingzhou. These reporters shouldn\u2019t be here because of him.</p><br/><p>However, he didn\u2019t want to care too much about it for now. He wanted to take a look at the situation first.</p><br/><p>The townsfolk stood in front of his shop\u2019s front door.</p><br/><p>\u201cLook! There are reporter\u2019s here again. Our Little boss of Cloud Street is famous once again. Every once in awhile, there will be reporters that come here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s that awesome?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course! Who are we talking about here? It\u2019s the Little boss of Cloud Street!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, Little boss didn\u2019t do anything recently. What\u2019s the meaning of these reporters coming here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle boss is here!\u201d</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan appeared in the line of sight of the crowd, the reporters\u2019 eyes began glowing. They hurriedly rushed over to surround Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>\u201cDear reporters, what are you all doing here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, regarding the discussion that you posted on Weibo yesterday, is it true? Did this Ma Qingzhou really do all those bad deeds?\u201d the reporters asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cFrom our understanding, Ma Qingzhou is a distinguished entrepreneur from Qingzhou. But his name is actually Ma Mu Feng, so why is he called Ma Qingzhou?\u201d</p><br/><p>Sure enough!</p><br/><p>The reporters have come because of that matter!</p><br/><p>Being famous can actually be a sin as well. He\u2019s rather famous on Weibo, so his every action and every word can attract much attention.</p><br/><p>Just like the more famous stars. Their casual gossipping online can even get them on the hot trending list. Isn\u2019t that just scary?</p><br/><p>As for Lin Fan, his exposure of Ma Qingzhou this time was rather huge. His position in Qingzhou was quite high and hence the reporters would probably have heard of it as well. They, therefore, wanted to come and get a better understanding of the situation. They never know if this might be a big news or not.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cEverybody! If you have questions, please ask one by one. The pretty lady over here, you may ask first.\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporters had many questions. With all these questions, their skulls might just blow apart.</p><br/><p>The pretty reporter asked, \u201cMaster Lin, according to your Weibo, you said that this Ma Qingzhou is looking for you to treat his illness. What makes you so sure that he\u2019s a bad person?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded while smiling, \u201cThis is a very good question. However, I don\u2019t have to answer this question. You all can take a look the discussion on my Weibo. The huge crowd of people online would have said everything.\u201d</p><br/><p>Another reporter asked, \u201cMay I ask, why is he called Ma Qingzhou?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cThis question is somewhat complicated. However, in order to be addressed as Ma Qingzhou, it definitely isn\u2019t easy. He might be someone with great influence in Qingzhou, and hence the name.\u201d</p><br/><p>A reporter asked, \u201cMaster Lin! May I ask why you chose to believe what you read online? From what we know, Ma Mu Feng is one of the top ten entrepreneurs in Qingzhou and is also a charitable person. He shouldn\u2019t be like what\u2019s described him online, should he?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed and waved his hand, \u201cThis matter isn\u2019t whether or not it looks like it or not, but rather, whether you trust it or not. The bad person can tell you to your face that he\u2019s not a bad person. In future, you all will know if he\u2019s a bad person or not.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The reporters continued to ask a lot of questions. They asked till they were all satisfied before leaving.</p><br/><p>Another day passed.</p><br/><p>This news spread like wildfire online. Many people were confused after reading the news. They didn\u2019t know who this Ma Qingzhou was. He wasn\u2019t a star, so why was he being exposed?</p><br/><p>At Qingzhou.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is he trying to do?\u201d Ma Qingzhou was thoroughly filled with rage. He was also somewhat in disbelief. He actually dared to say those words to the reporters.</p><br/><p>\u201cQingzhou bully Ma Qingzhou. Influential?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ma Qingzhou was especially stunned when he saw such headlines. Which f*cking newspaper company wrote that? Were they trying to die?</p><br/><p>In Qingzhou, no one dared to provoke Ma Qingzhou. But when the news came out, they were all shocked.</p><br/><p>Ordinary people aren\u2019t able to come into contact with Ma Qingzhou like this, but they knew that Ma Qingzhou was very powerful in Qingzhou.</p><br/><p>Some of the citizens who had been bullied by Ma Qingzhou before were very happy. They felt that his retribution was coming soon.</p><br/><p>However, not after long, all the news online suddenly disappeared. It was as if it wasn\u2019t even there before.</p><br/><p>In a random meeting area in Qingzhou.</p><br/><p>A group of wealthy kids was gathered together, playing.</p><br/><p>\u201cGuys! Take a look! It seems that Godfather Ma has been ridiculed by someone!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy do you say that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTake a look online! Someone is messing with Godfather Ma. Just which troop is this Shanghai\u2019s Master Lin from? He has some guts.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh! The news is gone. Looks like Godfather Ma has made his move to suppress all the news. It\u2019s unbelievable to see someone dare to mess with Godfather Ma. Should we put a bet?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow do you want to do it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s bet on how long it takes before this fellow kneels before Godfather Ma. I\u2019ll bet one day.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bet two days!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The kids all placed their bets. In Qingzhou, there wasn\u2019t anyone that didn\u2019t know who Godfather Ma was. Even for them, they didn\u2019t dare to be presumptuous in front of Godfather Ma.</p><br/><p>Some families had properties that worthed millions of dollars. Some even had 100 million and above. However, they still didn\u2019t have the rights to even speak to Godfather Ma normally</p><br/><p>At this moment, a young man sitting on an expensive chair said with disdain, \u201cMa Mufeng handles things to tyrannically! What society are we currently living in? Does he really think that he can rule us oppressively? Such things are inevitable. I\u2019ve already heard some news that there are people who want to displace him but just couldn\u2019t find the opportunity.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight now, something has happened and it has been brought up online. Let\u2019s see how he does it.\u201d</p><br/><p>The rest of the people shook their heads, \u201cI don\u2019t necessarily think that he would be able to carry it out. Everyone knows the background of Godfather Ma. What\u2019s more is that he has a strong group of supporters backing him. It wouldn\u2019t be easy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I think as well. However, Godfather Ma isn\u2019t in a good condition as of now. His influence is starting to weaken. The Huang family of Chengxi and the Ye family of Qingyuan District are intending on parting ways. Godfather Ma might not be able to do anything to stop them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEnough! Let\u2019s not talk about this anymore. It doesn\u2019t have anything much to do with us.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, yes. However, speaking seriously, others can\u2019t wait to avoid someone like Godfather Ma. This Shanghai person is really awesome. He actually dares to ridicule Godfather Ma online. These days, it\u2019s game over when it catches the eye of many online. For example, Liang Hao of the Liang family. All because of a girl, he knocked over her boyfriend in broad daylight and it was put online by passers-by. It caught the attention of many, and what happened in the end? The older generation didn\u2019t even want to protect him despite coming from a powerful family. He had no choice but to serve a jail term.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, here\u2019s something that you probably don\u2019t know. He was sentenced to ten years in jail. But from what I know, he is living comfortably in jail and would be released soon to fly overseas to hide.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s impossible.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean by that\u2019s impossible? This is but a common occurrence in Qingzhou.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck!\u201d Someone suddenly shouted, scaring the people around him.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGo and take a look at Weibo! That Master Lin said that he wants to come to Qingzhou. Isn\u2019t he just seeking death?\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone was shocked. They hurriedly opened up their Weibo.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan: Qingzhou, wait for me. Here I come!</p><br/><p>The crowd was speechless.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s basically like a goat entering a tiger\u2019s mouth.\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

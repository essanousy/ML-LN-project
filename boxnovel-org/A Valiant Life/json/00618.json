He could no longer hide his angry.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou ungrateful animal.\u201d</p><br/><p>He did not think that there would actually be people who would reject Godfather Ma\u2019s requests.</p><br/><p>Given the situation, the problem was no longer his as now Godfather Ma will deal with it.</p><br/><p>He took out his phone.</p><br/><p>\u201cGodfather Ma, Zhao Ming Qing has rejected us. Also, the teacher who taught him everything was there also, he also rejected us,\u201d he said respectfully. He did not dare to say anything rash.</p><br/><p>\u201cYea.\u201d</p><br/><p>The other end of the phone did not say much but only gave a response that was down playing the situation.</p><br/><p>Liu Ren knew that although on the outside, Godfather Ma was very calm, he was scared that inside he was not as calm. He was like a fierce beast being awakened.</p><br/><p>He knew that Godfather Ma\u2019s medical condition was very serious. For the moment he was not scared but if he did not find help soon enough, he would be pretty close to death.</p><br/><p>Someone of such high power like Godfather Ma could not just simply die like that.</p><br/><p>In times where his life was at risk, there was nothing he was not willing to do.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing said, \u201cTeacher, we were so firm in our rejection, I\u2019m scared that Ma Qingzhou will get revenge on us.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. \u201cYou knew that they would get revenge? Then why weren\u2019t you scared from the start?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing said, \u201cAt the start, it was just about me. I am of a very old age already, how can I be scared of people getting revenge. However, since you got involved, I\u2019m scared\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, don\u2019t say so much. There isn\u2019t really anything to be afraid of. When I saw your appearance just now, there was a dark wind blowing over you and there was undoubtedly going to be a huge calamity, one which will result in calamity. However, it\u2019s okay now. I let you be my disciple so now I am substituting you,\u201d Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing was stunned. Then, he anxiously said, \u201cTeacher, this is\u2026 this\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled and said, \u201cAre you touched? Do you feel that your teacher is good? Having someone to replace you when you\u2019re in trouble.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even when dealing with this kind of situation, he did not have the slightest bit of dread. Even if he did not have the major classification of martial arts, he would not be scared. Even more so now.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing\u2019s was very worried. He said, \u201cTeacher, I should not have brought so much trouble to you. I\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He blamed himself. He deeply blamed himself.</p><br/><p>From when he first became his disciple, he had never brought any good to his teacher, it was always his teacher helping him.</p><br/><p>He was already so old. He was a burden to the younger generation.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, what\u2019s up? I don\u2019t really like this expression. I\u2019m asking you, are you touched or not?\u201d Lin Fan asked.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing slowly nodded, \u201cI am touched.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan gave Zhao Ming Qing a pat on his shoulder and said, \u201cAs long as you\u2019re touched, it\u2019s okay. Remember, I am your teacher. If I don\u2019t carry the burden then who will. After all, this Ma Qingzhou is not good news. Also, who is your teacher? It is Justice Fan, do you understand? This b*stard, if he does not offend us, then it is fine. But if he does, I will definitely put him behind bars.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming QIng was very touched. His old eyes were going to crash already.</p><br/><p>Teacher, I feel it\u2019s probably not possible to put him behind bars. You don\u2019t know how powerful Ma Qingzhou is in Qingzhou. Also, the relationships there are very complicated. Teacher, you probably don\u2019t know this but I\u2019ve been to Qingzhou before. Ma Qingzhou has links to people in every level in Qingzhou. Also, he has the support of many people behind the scenes,\u201d Zhao Ming Qing said.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough, you don\u2019t have to think about this so much. Just leave this all to your teacher. I don\u2019t care if he is Ma Qingzhou or Malan Zhou. I have an idea.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan decided to do another huge good deed and that was to defeat this Ma Qingzhou. However, he did not really understand this Ma Qingzhou yet so he had to do some research and see what it turns up.</p><br/><p>However, there was also one man who could tell him something.</p><br/><p>That was Lu Li.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The next day.</p><br/><p>At the Lu Corporation.</p><br/><p>A limousine appeared at the corporation\u2019s door and immediately, there were bodyguards there, welcoming them.</p><br/><p>After going through the kidnapping incident, Lu Li was deeply terrified. He would definitely not let this kind of thing happen again and thus he arranged for a large number of bodyguards for protection.</p><br/><p>He never thought that he would be kidnapped before so he only hired 4 or 5 bodyguards back then.</p><br/><p>He never thought that in the face of these drug dealers, these few bodyguards were not enough protection. After being rattled by other people, he did not want to leave any margin for error.</p><br/><p>Whenever he moved out, the minimum was twelve bodyguards and they were fully armed.</p><br/><p>Although it required a lot of logistics for a long journey, it was nothing when compared to how much he wanted to stay safe.</p><br/><p>He looked around and then all of a sudden, saw a familiar figure.</p><br/><p>The bodyguards also caught a glimpse of Lin Fan and wanted to question him but Lu Li stopped them.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need, that is Master Lin. You guys can just wait here for me.\u201d</p><br/><p>In front of others, Lu Li was cold and arrogant. At a glance, he seemed like a tyrant. This sort of vigor was not something everyone could have.</p><br/><p>If it was Lin Fan had not seen Lu Li\u2019s true side, he would probably also be tricked by him.</p><br/><p>Lu Li let out a big smile and said, \u201cMaster Lin, what brings you here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI want you to tell you a name and see how much you know about him,\u201d Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>Lu Li confidently smiled and said, \u201cGo ahead. As long as he has any sort of power, I will know him. If it is just some small fry, then he is not worthy of me knowing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan did not ask the question yet but just looked at him and said, \u201cCan you just be normal? Why are you still acting in front of me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Lu Li was a little embarrassed. Then he laughed and said, \u201cBrother Lin, just ask. Are we not at the door of my corporation? It\u2019s not a good look for me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cQingzhou\u2019s Ma Mu Feng, do you recognize him?\u201d Lin Fan asked.</p><br/><p>When he heard this name, Lu Li was stunned. He replied, \u201cBrother Lin, are you talking about Ma Qingzhou?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, it is Ma Qingzhou.\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking at the way Lu Li was, he obviously knew the man. But from the look in his eyes, he could feel that this Ma Qingzhou was something else. After all, the number of people that were able to make Lu Li on his guard was not a lot.</p><br/><p>In Shanghai, the Lu family was one of the top corporations. Even Wang Ming Yang could not compare.</p><br/><p>Lu Li took out two cigarettes and passed one to Lin Fan. He even personally lit it for him.</p><br/><p>When the bodyguards who were waiting for Lu Li saw this, it set a huge wave in their hearts.</p><br/><p>How could this be? Did Chief Lu just personally light a cigarette for someone?</p><br/><p>And he was even having such a huge smile.</p><br/><p>To them, it was something that was impossible.</p><br/><p>Who was Chief Lu? He was the head of the Lu Corporation. His powered scared others and countless people, upon seeing him will go crying for their father.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cI know this Ma Qingzhou. He is very powerful in Qingzhou. I have seen him before and he is a very shrewd man with lots of connections. Even some leaders in Qingzhou who see him call him Godfather Ma. I heard that he was an awesome supporter backing him. Brother Lin, do you have some grudges with him?\u201d Lu Li asked.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan thought carefully. It seems like this b*stard was really powerful.</p><br/><p>Lu Li saw that Lin Fan did not say anything so he knew that there were grudges. He said, \u201cHowever, it is fine. As long as you stay in Shanghai, no matter what he will still be in Qingzhou showing off. Shanghai is a city that is very special. Since it is an international metropolis, it is not somewhere he can just be impudent if he wanted to.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Lin Fan said as he was very curious. He didn\u2019t see anything special about Shanghai.</p><br/><p>Lu Li smiled and said, \u201cShanghai is the heart of the country. Top in GDP, top in Asia and an international harbor. If he comes to Shanghai and does dirty business, he will be dead within two days and no one will know how he died. Here, no one dares to do dirty business, even if is the Lu family, we also do our business honestly. This is a regulation and these important places won\u2019t tolerate him.\u201d</p><br/><p>So it was like that!</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, this Ma Qingzhou is not to be trifled with. In Shanghai, I am not scared, but in Qingzhou, even if it is the Lu family, you will have to tread carefully.\u201d</p><br/><p>This was the final evaluation from Lu Li.</p></div>\n</div>"}

Then, he sat up and leaned against the bedrest. He couldn\u2019t even remember what had happened last night.</p><br/><p>It seemed like he had drunk a lot. However, his head didn\u2019t feel uncomfortable at all.</p><br/><p>Usually, when he drank too much, his head would feel muddled the next morning. But he didn\u2019t understand what was going on this time. Could it be that the wine was so good that it didn\u2019t have any negative effects on him?</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re awake. Have some sweet soup.\u201d Lady Zheng carried some sweet soup over. Then, she said, \u201cReally. You\u2019re already so old, but you still drank so much last night.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zheng Zhong Shan got off the bed. As he put on his clothes, he sighed.</p><br/><p>\u201cSigh, what a shame. I thought I could get Elder Lin drunk and make him create a drawing for us. I didn\u2019t think that I would suffer a complete defeat. I didn\u2019t get the drawing, and even all my wine has been finished by Elder Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>Just as Elder Zheng sighed, two other sighs came from outside.</p><br/><p>Yue Qiu Ju Shi and Tao Shi Gang had woken up as well. Their heads didn\u2019t hurt, but as they thought about the previous night\u2019s incident, they felt that it was a real shame.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Zheng, what happened in the end? Did we get the drawing?\u201d asked Tao Shi Gang.</p><br/><p>Elder Zheng answered, \u201cObviously not. All of us fell unconscious last night. How could you all get drunk?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yue Qiu Ju Shi retorted, \u201cHow can you blame us? Who would have known that Elder Lin could drink so much? We were just\u2026 Sigh, forget it. We\u2019ve lost. We\u2019ve all lost.\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Zheng felt helpless. He looked at the time. It was just past 7AM. It wasn\u2019t early, nor was it late. As he had entered his later years, his daily hours of sleep had gradually decreased. Usually, he wouldn\u2019t be able to sleep anymore once the Sun rose.</p><br/><p>He went into the study room.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh!\u201d A cry of shock rang out.</p><br/><p>When Tao Shi Gang and Yue Qiu Ju Shi, who were outside, heard this, they were startled. They wondered what on earth was going on. Then, they rushed into the room to take a look. It can\u2019t be that Elder Zheng has fallen ill because he\u2019s too sad, can it?</p><br/><p>However, when they reached the study room, they saw Elder Zheng standing there alone, staring at the tabletop. It seemed as if he was stunned.</p><br/><p>When they looked over and saw the drawing on the table, they were completely flabbergasted.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yue Qiu Ju Shi was stunned for a moment, then he regained his senses and wanted to go and touch the artwork.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t touch it.\u201d Elder Zheng was alarmed. He quickly stopped Yue Qiu Ju Shi and looked at them alertly. \u201cWhat did we say last night? This is mine, not yours!\u201d</p><br/><p>Initially, both of them had promised that they were helping Elder Zheng to get a drawing. However, when they saw Lin Fan\u2019s drawing in person, that promise completely disintegrated.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Zheng, you can\u2019t do that. Look closely at who those four people in the drawing are. Besides Elder Lin, the other three are us, aren\u2019t they? This is Elder Lin\u2019s gift to us, not just you alone,\u201d said Tao Shi Gang. With one look, he had fallen in love with the drawing. How could he just let Elder Zheng have it?</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s the four of us. But Elder Lin drew it here in my home. Moreover, we already agreed yesterday. I\u2019ll let you two choose whichever artworks you want from my study room. Go ahead.\u201d Elder Zheng guarded the artwork. He really loved it very much.</p><br/><p>At the same time, he sighed emotionally. He hadn\u2019t expected that Elder Lin had known his intentions all along. Before leaving, Elder Lin had made a drawing for him.</p><br/><p>He was beyond delighted. There was an indescribable joy in his heart.</p><br/><p>Tao Shi Gang and Yue Qiu Ju Shi couldn\u2019t let it go. Then, they looked at the piece of paper on the table and said, \u201cThere are words written there. It must have been left here by Elder Lin. Take a look.\u201d</p><br/><p>The three of them looked at the words on that piece of paper. The next moment, they were stunned.</p><br/><p>I\u2019ll leave the writing to you. Write your own names. As for who it\u2019s for, you guys can slowly discuss about it.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s mine. You guys can choose among the other artworks in the house.\u201d The more Elder Zheng looked at it, the more he liked the artwork. How could he give it away?</p><br/><p>Yue Qiu Ju Shi said, \u201cElder Zheng, give it to me. I\u2019ll give you all of the artworks in my study room.\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Zheng refused, \u201cNo. Even if you give me all your artworks, they wouldn\u2019t be worth this one.\u201d</p><br/><p>The three of them debated for a long time. In the end, they still couldn\u2019t reach a conclusion.</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan woke up, it wasn\u2019t early anymore. It was already 9AM.</p><br/><p>Because of the previous day\u2019s incident, Weibo was buzzing with activity.</p><br/><p>It monopolized Weibo\u2019s trending page.</p><br/><p>Everything else was pushed aside.</p><br/><p>Even news of celebrities\u2019 divorces were no exception. No one else could take the headlines.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, why hasn\u2019t Master Lin posted on Weibo since the award ceremony?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. Could it be that he forgot about it because he\u2019s too excited?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI think that\u2019s very likely. Perhaps Master Lin was so excited that he forgot to post on Weibo.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s too scary. Master Lin is so young. It seems that he\u2019s still single, right? Whoever becomes Master Lin\u2019s partner will have hit the jackpot.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin isn\u2019t single. Doesn\u2019t he have a relationship with that celebrity, Wu Huan Yue? Didn\u2019t someone take a photo of Master Lin with three ladies?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c^It\u2019s not what you think.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m a fan of Wu Huan Yue. Actually, I really approve of her being with Master Lin. However, as for the photo, it wasn\u2019t like what was reported, so don\u2019t speak nonsense.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan had fans and so did Wu Huan Yue.</p><br/><p>Usually, something like this would cause one to lose fans. However, Lin Fan\u2019s fanbase was way too huge. Wu Huan Yue\u2019s fanbase couldn\u2019t compare to Lin Fan\u2019s. Moreover, most of Wu Huan Yue\u2019s fans were fans of Master Lin as well.</p><br/><p>Hence, Wu Huan Yue\u2019s fans were happy to see their idol together with Master Lin.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Lin Fan refreshed his Weibo.</p><br/><p>He took a photo of the reward and posted it on Weibo.</p><br/><p>\u201cStay low-profile. Last night, I drank too much with some old friends. I came back home and slept until now. Today, I\u2019m going back to Shanghai.\u201d</p><br/><p>When this message was posted, the netizens were all stunned.</p><br/><p>He had just won such a big award, but he could still sleep in. If it had been anyone else, they would have taken a selfie with the award immediately.</p><br/><p>Everyone was in awe.</p><br/><p><em>Knock knock</em></p><br/><p>At that moment, someone knocked on Lin Fan\u2019s door. When he opened it, Fraud Tian and the rest were waiting outside. Then, they went out for breakfast.</p><br/><p>Yun Xue Yao had come to Beijing to see Lin Fan receive the award. Now that he had received it, she had to have a meal with him.</p><br/><p>She had sent the photo to her friends the previous night.</p><br/><p>Her friends didn\u2019t recognize who was in the photo. However, what she hadn\u2019t expected was for her grandfather to actually give her a call.</p><br/><p>This had surprised her. She didn\u2019t know what was going on.</p><br/><p>Over the phone, her grandfather was mainly asking about the old man in the photo.</p><br/><p>Young people probably wouldn\u2019t recognize him, but how could someone like her grandfather not recognize that old man in the photo?</p><br/><p>If his own granddaughter knew that old man and went to his house for a meal, it represented something great.</p><br/><p>What Yun Xue Yao didn\u2019t know was that because of this incident, her family\u2019s status had gradually risen.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

All these celebrities could count themselves unlucky for meeting someone like Lin Fan. When Lin Fan didn't like the look of somebody, he wouldn't give them any face.</p><br/><p>This was especially so for Li Mu Ze and Lu Dao Ren. If they were to come back to look for trouble even after the filming, they would better have to think twice. If they came to pick a fight with Lin Fan, they would definitely be beaten to a pulp.</p><br/><p>What a tragedy.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan didn't feel comfortable at all. Was Lin Fan treating Tang Ying better just because she was pretty? But she was pretty herself too. Or was it a male thing to eye for things elsewhere when he already had something on his plate? Or was it because he wanted something that wasn't his?</p><br/><p>Or had she just become a spare tire for Lin Fan? So that after he had his fun, he could finally settle down with her?</p><br/><p>At this moment, Wu You Lan's heart raced with worry as all the possibilities crossed her mind.</p><br/><p>Tang Ying beamed at Lin Fan. \"Master Lin, I'm a fan of your Weibo. I know every single thing that you post on Weibo and that your fortune telling is really accurate. I must say that you are an extraordinary man.\"</p><br/><p>\"Your woman's intuition is correct. It is true that most of these fortune tellers are just scammers but my fortune telling is true. No one has yet to surpass me,\" Lin Fan said confidently.</p><br/><p>Blush!</p><br/><p>Tang Ying hadn't expected that level of self-confidence from Lin Fan but she didn't dislike it. Although she was considered a celebrity, she would still manage her own life. When she wasn't too busy, she would manage her own Weibo account herself and, at the same time, catch up with the news. The other bigger celebrities like Li Mu Ze didn't have time to manage their own accounts, so they handed it over to professionals to manage their accounts unless there was a huge online news that concerned them.</p><br/><p>\"Stop blowing your own horn. How shameless.\" Li Mu Ze commented.</p><br/><p>\"What did you say?\" Lin Fan squinted his eyes at him in doubt.</p><br/><p>\"Nothing.\" Li Mu Ze didn't want to talk back anymore, admitting defeat this round. If they weren't filming, he would definitely have become hostile and made Lin Fan regret what he had said.</p><br/><p>It was a pity that he didn't realize that once Lin Fan was set on disliking a person, he would never give them any face at all.</p><br/><p>The fact that those two celebrities were part of the backstabbing club made Lin Fan feel that his hostility towards them was justified since they were just scum.</p><br/><p>After looking at Li Mu Ze up close, Lin Fan finally understood why he was like this. He was too good at concealing things and most people didn't realize the truth, especially his fans. He was always prepared and refined, and no one could ever guess what his intents were.</p><br/><p>\"It doesn't matter if you say it or not. Your words are fake and your teeth have a gap between them. You're the kind of person to talk behinds other people's backs anyway and that isn't any good news.\"</p><br/><p>F*ck!</p><br/><p>Li Mu Ze's face was green with rage but he maintained his smile. \"Master Lin, your mouth isn't any better. My temper is very mild and I've practiced Taekwondo before. Now you've pissed me off. If this was any other time, I would definitely beat you up.</p><br/><p>Although he said it jokingly, but everyone around knew that he was spitting venom, or maybe he was really angry and really wanted to beat up Master Lin.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan wasn't angry at all. \"You are not a worthy opponent. I practice Ba Gua Zhang. One strike and your face will never be the same again. Oh, and I forgot to mention that I'm the Vice-President of the Shanghai Martial Arts Association. If you don't believe me, we can have a little brawl over here but I'll hold back.\"</p><br/><p>Since the programme was still being filmed, both parties hadn't shown their ugliest sides yet.</p><br/><p>Li Mu Ze had originally wanted to gain the one-up but he had never thought that this brat wouldn't be forgiving at all, immediately suppressing him. He was at the end of his patience.</p><br/><p>Huang Yue clapped her hands together. \"That's great! But how about we add one more condition that if Brother Ze wins, he gets the clue to the next stage?\"</p><br/><p>\"That isn't too bad a proposition. Brother Ze has been practicing all this while. Last time when we were filming, Brother Ze performed wonderfully, even the teachers who were helping out with the movie said that his skill was good.\"</p><br/><p>Brother Ze had originally wanted to reject Master Lin's offer but after seeing that Master Lin had a little inkling of wanting to escape this, he grinned to himself. \"Alright. Since Master Lin is the president of the Martial Arts Association, he definitely has some skill over there. Let us test our skills against each other. Don't worry, I won't go all out in order to spare you.\"</p><br/><p>He had taken the bait.</p><br/><p>In that instant, Lin Fan grinned before standing up. \"Alright...\"</p><br/><p>\"Director Hu, this isn't right...\" the filming crew turned towards Director Hu and said.</p><br/><p>Director Hu waved them away. \"There is no right or wrong. The script is merely a framework and whatever happens after that is just another branch off from it.\"</p><br/><p>\"But I feel that there's something wrong with the atmosphere here and it might easily escalate into something more serious.\"</p><br/><p>\"Conflicts have existed since ancient times and didn't you see how they maintained their temper just now? Everything is going to be fine.\" Director Hu smiled.</p><br/><p>The film crew didn't say anything more and just followed Director Hu's instructions.</p><br/><p>Li Mu Ze had never thought that this brat would actually agree to his challenge. He had been practicing Taekwondo for the longest time and he couldn't help but laugh with confidence. Furthermore, he had been keeping in shape regularly. This fight would be a piece of cake for him.</p><br/><p>One punch was all he needed to beat him into oblivion.</p><br/><p>\"Come at me. I'm open.\" Lin Fan gestured at Li Mu Ze.</p><br/><p>F*ck.</p><br/><p>Li Mu Ze felt like he was getting belittled. What's the meaning of that? Is this guy looking down on me? Well, bring it on. I'll knock you out with one punch.</p><br/><p>Li Mu Ze was all ready to strike as he focused intently on Lin Fan's face as the target.</p><br/><p>\"Are you ready? Once you've taken enough time, just come at me. I'll just use one hand, lest you say that I am bullying you,\" Lin Fan said casually.</p><br/><p>F*ck your mum! Li Mu Ze cursed in his mind. Lin Fan was really getting on his nerves.</p><br/><p>The crowd that was standing around all moved back a little and gave them a little space. This program was getting a little more interesting by the minute. Everyone was eager to see what would transpire.</p><br/><p>Suddenly!</p><br/><p>Li Mu Ze made a move, his fists came flying at Lin Fan. Lin Fan let out a little grin as he deflected Li Mu Ze's attack, making a swift and deft sidestep and causing Li Mu Ze's weight to be completely shifted forward. Li Mu Ze was thrust forward into the ground, landing in an awkward position on all fours.</p><br/><p>\"Are you okay? I thought you said you knew a little about martial arts. If I had known better, I would have used less strength,\" Lin Fan said in a concerned tone.</p><br/><p>\"I'm fine\u2026\" Li Mu Ze was on the verge of exploding, but he still maintained his composure.</p><br/><p>The fight was over.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan returned to his chair, shaking his head at Li Mu Ze.</p><br/><p>F*ck!</p><br/><p>Everyone who was standing around was stunned. He's just too fast!</p><br/><p>Li Mu Ze crawled up from the ground, looking awkwardly around, his heart full of anger. Thereafter, he dusted himself off, trying not to let the embarrassing situation affect him.</p><br/><p>Huang Yue laughed. This season was just getting better and better. She didn't know what to say.</p><br/><p>This was creating trouble out of nothing.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

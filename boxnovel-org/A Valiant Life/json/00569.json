When he saw the messy situation inside, he was startled. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Why are you fighting?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung Master!\u201d</p><br/><p>When Young Chang and Young Shen saw him, they were delighted. Then, their expressions became slightly embarrassed. They felt that they had humiliated themselves and it was in front of the Young Master too.</p><br/><p>They weren\u2019t very close to the Young Master. They were just in the same social circle and they would occasionally exchange a few words.</p><br/><p>When they had come to Shanghai this time, it was supposed to be just the two of them, but somehow, the Young Master found out and came to Shanghai with them. To them, it was an exceptionally joyous thing. They felt as if it was time to put on a good display.</p><br/><p>But how could they have known that something like this would happen? They had basically humiliated themselves in front of the Young Master.</p><br/><p>At that moment, both of them looked at Lin Fan. they were filled with deep hatred. They wanted to kill him.</p><br/><p>When He Ming Hui heard the two of them say \u2018Young Master\u2019, he immediately looked over at Zou Tian Fu. His heart was thumping furiously. Could this be the super important figure that the two of them had talked about?</p><br/><p>His heart raced.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan\u2019s eyes met Zou Tian Fu\u2019s. They were both astonished.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s you?\u201d</p><br/><p>They said that simultaneously, clearly in disbelief.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Zou Tian Fu actively spoke, \u201cSo you\u2019re here. I went to Cloud Street but couldn\u2019t find you. But, this\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled, \u201cWhy are you here, Young Master? Are these two your friends?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zou Tian Fu looked at the two of them and hesitated for a moment. Then, he nodded, \u201cMmm, my friends.\u201d</p><br/><p>When the Young Master said the word \u2018friends\u2019, Young Shao and Young Shen were almost moved to tears. They didn\u2019t think that the Young Master would acknowledge them as friends.</p><br/><p>They had boundless fury towards Lin Fan in their hearts but what came after that was excitement.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied with an \u2018Oh\u2019. Then, he said, \u201cI was the one who hit them.\u201d He pointed at Chen Yun Yi and Luo Dan. \u201cThese two are my friends. Your two friends were trying to mess around with them so I taught them a lesson.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zou Tian Fu never expected his second meeting with Master Lin to be under such circumstances. He had great admiration for Master Lin. That fortune reading that he gave him was too accurate. Also, while he had been in Beijing for several months, he had successfully regained an inning. Since then, Zou Tian Fu had been planning to thank Lin Fan properly when he came to Shanghai.</p><br/><p>But now, this situation was a little awkward.</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung Master, we\u2026\u201d Young Chang started speaking but halfway, Zou Tian Fu stopped him.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, thank you for the previous matter. Although these two are a little unbridled, they\u2019re my friends. By hitting them, you aren\u2019t giving me any face. But you have done me a favor before. How about this? We shall cross exchange blows for a bit. If you can withstand me for three seconds, we\u2019ll let this matter pass. I\u2019ll admit our mistake on their behalf and we can treat it as my lack of stern teachings. If you can\u2019t withstand three seconds, then we\u2019ll forget about this incident as well.\u201d Zou Tian Fu removed his outer clothing and flung it to the side. He revealed a majestic muscular body.</p><br/><p>It was very stunning.</p><br/><p>Seeing Zou Tian Fu\u2019s muscles, Lin Fan smiled, \u201cYour muscles are pretty well-trained. Looks like you have some ability.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zou Tian Fu smiled, \u201cI come from a family with many generations of military men. If I am not capable, it would be a joke. How is it, Master Lin? Are you okay with it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shook his head, \u201cAlthough you are a pretty good person, you really are asking for a beating. I shall satisfy your request but don\u2019t regret it.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Young Chang saw that Lin Fan dared to belittle the Young Master, he scolded, \u201cYou\u2019re nothing! Young Master, he\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShut up.\u201d Zou Tian Fu glared at Young Chang. \u201cMaster Lin has done me a great grace in the past, what are you trying to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026\u201d Young Chang immediately lowered his head and didn\u2019t dare to say another word.</p><br/><p>He never thought that this guy actually knew Young Master. Their relationship seemed pretty good too.</p><br/><p>However, for this guy to dare to exchange blows with Young Master was basically asking for death.</p><br/><p>In Beijing, everybody knew how f*cking powerful Young Master was. Challenging ten other men on his own was not a problem. Lin Fan was going to be in trouble.</p><br/><p>Zou Tian Fu didn\u2019t want to fight with Lin Fan but he was a prideful person. Although these two people weren\u2019t important, they were still considered his people. They had been beaten and if he didn\u2019t do anything about it, it would be a little humiliating.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why he had come up with this idea.</p><br/><p>Zou Tian Fu said, \u201cMaster Lin, don\u2019t worry. I will have mercy. I won\u2019t let you get hurt.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed and waved his hand. \u201cNo need, come at me with full strength.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Yun Yi pulled on Master Lin\u2019s sleeve worriedly. \u201cMaster Lin, maybe you shouldn\u2019t fight.\u201d</p><br/><p>She saw Zou Tian Fu\u2019s muscles and was a little frightened. If his fists land, it would probably be really bad. And Master Lin looked so skinny and fragile. Was he really going to be fine?</p><br/><p>Zou Tian Fu smiled, \u201cAlright, I shall let Master Lin experience it. When I was in the military, I beat ten over people on my own. Although I got a little injured, there was nothing big. If you can withstand just three seconds, you can be considered good already.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at Zou Tian Fu. This guy really was overbearing with his cockiness.</p><br/><p>He would be considered good just by withstanding three seconds?</p><br/><p>If Fraud Tian heard that, he would die of laughter.</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung Master, I have something to say too. If you can withstand my attacks for three seconds, you can be considered powerful,\u201d said Lin Fan</p><br/><p>He Ming Hui, who had been watching from the side, felt helpless. What the heck were these two doing?</p><br/><p>What was all this about three seconds?</p><br/><p>If they were gonna fight, then they should hurry up and fight. It didn\u2019t matter who won. The matter would be settled either way. What was all this trouble for?</p><br/><p>\u201cPrepare yourself, Master Lin. I\u2019m coming.\u201d Then, Zou Tian Fu\u2019s expression changed. He immediately went at Master Lin with formidable might. He didn\u2019t want to hurt Master Lin, so he was going to take him down and pin him to the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re pretty quick.\u201d Lin Dan smiled. His body turned, his legs shifted and he thrust his palm into Zou Tian Fu\u2019s back.</p><br/><p>Bam!</p><br/><p>Zou Tian Fu fell to the ground heavily.</p><br/><p>Shock!</p><br/><p>Young Chang and Young Shen were dumbfounded. What was going on? Why did Young Master fall to the ground?</p><br/><p>Young Master Zou, who was flat on the ground, felt his brain short-circuiting. What just happened? How did he suddenly end up on the ground?</p><br/><p>F*ck, Master Lin was a trained person.</p><br/><p>In this short instant, Zou Tian Fu\u2019s brain started to think.</p><br/><p>Just from this one move, he could tell that he wasn\u2019t a match for Master Lin. If he didn\u2019t admit defeat and went at Master Lin again, he would be forced to kneel. When that happens, it would be humiliating.</p><br/><p>No, he had to think of another way out.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, Master Lin, this move of yours is amazing. But I just came to Shanghai so I\u2019m not acclimatized. My feet are slippery and I can\u2019t draw out my full strength. Forget it, let\u2019s count this as my loss,\u201d said Young Master Zou with a smile as he hastily crawled up. He had found a perfect excuse.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled and didn\u2019t try to expose him but he wouldn\u2019t let him off so easy. \u201cAh, then let\u2019s exchange blows again next time when we have the chance.\u201d</p><br/><p>Young Master Zou smiled, \u201cAlright. Once I acclimatize to Shanghai, let\u2019s trade blows once again. But a win is a win. I have to admit my defeat. I shall apologize to you on their behalf. I hope you won\u2019t bear a grudge.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved his hand, \u201cNo need for that, it\u2019s just a small matter. But next time, don\u2019t bother these two friends of mine anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>Young Master Zou looked over at the two of them. \u201cDid you hear that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Young Chang and Young Shen immediately nodded, \u201cWe understand, Young Master.\u201d</p><br/><p>They weren\u2019t idiots. They could clearly see the relationship between Young Master and Master Lin.</p><br/><p>As for the rage in their hearts, it had dispersed long ago. If they were still to hold a grudge against Lin Fan, they had to be stupid.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Lin Fan looked towards He Ming Hui. \u201cChief He, tell me, what must we do in order to terminate the contract?\u201d</p><br/><p>He Ming Hui was startled. Then, he smiled and said, \u201cMaster Lin, what are you talking about? You\u2019ve already spoken, how could I not terminate the contract? I\u2019ll get someone to process the termination right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Chen Yun Yi and Luo Dan heard this, smiles of immense joy appeared on their faces.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled. That was just f*cking despicable.</p></div>\n</div>"}

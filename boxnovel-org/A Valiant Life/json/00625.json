People that lived there must have been suffering.</p><br/><p>As the righteous Lin Fan, he couldn\u2019t just watch them suffer. He had to stand up for them and create a harmonious environment.</p><br/><p>The air stewardess announced, \u201cWe have arrived at Qingzhou Airport. Welcome to the beautiful Qingzhou. We hope you\u2019ve had a pleasant flight.\u201d</p><br/><p>Outside the airport.</p><br/><p>Some luxurious cars were parked there and it attracted the attention of a lot of people. After all, there were quite a number of luxurious cars and perhaps they were welcoming an important guest.</p><br/><p>However, when they saw the car plate number of the first car, they hid in fear.</p><br/><p>Qing Q00000.</p><br/><p>This car plate number belonged to Ma Qing Zhou. As long as one was from Qingzhou, he would definitely know who this car belonged to.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy is Ma Qing Zhou at the airport?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy isn\u2019t he arrested? He\u2019s still living such a luxurious life.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou must be asking for it. If someone were to hear it, you\u2019d be doomed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Can he kill me? We\u2019re living in a harmonious society now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>A group of men in black stood in two rows. They wore shades and looked fearsome.</p><br/><p>Liu Ren stood in front of the car and bowed, \u201cGodfather Ma, the person had alighted from the plane.</p><br/><p>Ma Qing Zhou replied, \u201cOk, look out for him and inform me when he is found.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRoger.\u201d Liu Ren nodded and looked out.</p><br/><p>After a moment, a silhouette emerged at the entrance of the airport.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe air in Qingzhou seems a little salty,\u201d Lin Fan remarked as he took a deep breath.</p><br/><p>He was a little nervous after arriving at a foreign city.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, someone appeared in front of Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked up and it was a middle-aged man. He looked a little domineering and the way he looked at him was abnormal.</p><br/><p>\u201cWelcome, welcome\u2026\u201d Ma Qing Zhou looked at Lin Fan and smiled. \u201cHow is it? Godly doctor, are you satisfied with the warm greetings?\u201d</p><br/><p>When he saw Lin Fan, Ma Qing Zhou didn\u2019t expect the godly doctor to be a young. However, when he thought about how he scolded him on Weibo, he was furious. He even thought about making life difficult for him.</p><br/><p>Perhaps that would feel better.</p><br/><p>After all, Qingzhou was his territory and he didn\u2019t believe that this fella could create an uprising against him here.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, you must be Ma Qing Zhou, right?\u201d Lin Fan smirked. Then, he looked at him closely and said, \u201cYou don\u2019t look too good. I think you\u2019re going to die soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry, I\u2019m just so direct. If you don\u2019t like it, you can choose not to listen to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Indeed, after Lin Fan said that, Ma Qing Zhou\u2019s face changed. However, he remained calm and smiled, \u201cThe godly doctor is indeed a godly doctor. You can tell the situation with just one look. I told the godly doctor that I, Ma Mu Feng will definitely give you a memorable welcome.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Ren added, \u201cGodly doctor Lin, our Godfather Ma is a benevolent man. He doesn\u2019t hold any grudges. Godfather Ma has already prepared everything for you. It\u2019s just that we don\u2019t know if the godly doctor will give us any face.\u201d</p><br/><p>As the right-hand man of Godfather Ma, he had to resolve things for him. Especially since Godly doctor Lin was just too overboard. Now that Godfather Ma required his help, he had to be nice to him. He needed Godly doctor Lin to treat his illness first.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled, \u201cSorry, I\u2019m not going to give you face.\u201d</p><br/><p>*clatter!*</p><br/><p>Those bodyguards were expressionless but when they heard him say those words, they were stunned.</p><br/><p>They had followed Godfather Ma for many years and they\u2019ve seen a lot of different situations before. However, they\u2019ve never seen someone who dared to speak to Godfather Ma with such disrespect in Qingzhou.</p><br/><p>Those that were rude to him all suffered the same fate.</p><br/><p>Ma Qing Zhou\u2019s face changed and changed the way that he looked at Lin Fan. He looked vicious and fearsome.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, godly doctor, don\u2019t you think you\u2019re a little too arrogant?\u201d Ma Qing Zhou glared at Lin Fan. Although he needed his help, he was still someone reputable and influential. Otherwise, why would people call him Ma Qing Zhou?</p><br/><p>At Qingzhou, nobody dared to make things difficult for him.</p><br/><p>His main purpose of coming to Qingzhou was to cause trouble for Ma Qing Zhou. Why would he bother to speak nicely to him?</p><br/><p>\u201cArrogant?\u201d Lin Fan chuckled. \u201cYou\u2019re right. I\u2019m just this arrogant. But what can you do to me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Ren didn\u2019t expect the godly doctor to be so arrogant. He even felt like he was there to cause trouble for Godfather Ma.</p><br/><p>Of course, it was just a brief feeling. After all, he believed that nobody dared to cause trouble at Qingzhou, especially in front of Godfather Ma.</p><br/><p>Perhaps this fella felt that he had a strong backing and dared to be so disrespectful towards Godfather Ma.</p><br/><p>But what could they do about it?</p><br/><p>He could only console himself.</p><br/><p>In front of Godfather Ma, nothing was fearsome to him.</p><br/><p>Ma Qing Zhou took a deep breath. He was furious. Then, he tried to lower his volume, \u201cYou\u2019re asking for it, right?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replies, \u201cYeah, I\u2019m asking for it. But can you even finish me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ma Qing Zhou replied, \u201cYou\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Some of the passers-by stopped in their tracks.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, what\u2019s happening? That person looks like Ma Qing Zhou. Who is that youngster? They seem to be arguing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally? How could that be? This is Qingzhou. Who even dared to mess with Ma Qing Zhou?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho is Ma Qing Zhou?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBro, are you a foreigner?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m a tourist. Is this Ma Qing Zhou very powerful?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Qingzhou local shook his head. That fella was a foreigner and there was no point talking to him about it. To the locals, Ma Qing Zhou wasn\u2019t just a powerful man. He was like the most powerful man there.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the surroundings and sighed, \u201cQingzhou has a nice scenery and looks to be a decent place. I just arrived today and I don\u2019t want to talk too much with you. I\u2019m not afraid to tell you that I\u2019m here today to mess with you. You want me to treat your illness? I think you should just forget about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ma Qing Zhou took a deep breath. If they weren\u2019t in a public place, he might have finished this man off.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, that\u2019s fine. I, Ma Mu Feng will play along with you. I want to see how long you can last for.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Ma Qing Zhou didn\u2019t say any rubbish. He knew that he couldn\u2019t possibly reach a negotiated agreement.</p><br/><p>However, as long as he was in Qingzhou, he could play along with him slowly.</p></div>\n</div>"}

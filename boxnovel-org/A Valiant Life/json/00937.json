This is the first time we\u2019ve met.\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-1\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at this person before him as he casually took the name card. He glanced at it before keeping it in his pocket. \u201cChief Yang, this is indeed the first time we\u2019ve met.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, right. I\u2019ve heard of Master Lin\u2019s great name a long time ago and I have always been eager to meet you. I didn\u2019t think that it would be in such a setting. I\u2019ve really leeched on Lady Wu\u2019s luck.\u201d Chief Yang lowered his ego greatly and even gave Wu Huan Yue a different salutation by calling her Lady Wu.</p><br/><p>This kind of little changes was very common but everyone already knew what was going on.</p><br/><p>These little celebrities, in particular, knew what was going on very clearly.</p><br/><p>They had been quietly watching these people boast initially but now that an even more amazing big shot had arrived, these people couldn\u2019t keep boasting anymore. They had to know their place.</p><br/><p>But these little celebrities were all really envious of Wu Huan Yue for having such a great supporter.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-2\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Many people there knew that Wu Huan Yue knew Master Lin but knowing each other was one thing. Whether or not Master Lin would stand up for her depended on the closeness of their relationship.</p><br/><p>Now, it was obvious. Master Lin had personally come to the filming site to visit her. Of course, they could tell what kind of relationship these two shared.</p><br/><p>Xie Qing opened her mouth slightly in disbelief. She felt that this change was too great. She wasn\u2019t able to respond at all. How had things changed so much in the blink of an eye?</p><br/><p>Her group had been high and mighty just a while ago but now, they had been suppressed.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t right.</p><br/><p>The rage in her heart grew bigger and bigger but she didn\u2019t dare to act unrestrainedly. Her own supporter was humbly and honestly handing over his name card to Master Lin. What was she supposed to do?</p><br/><p>Chief Yang hurriedly said, \u201cMaster Lin, let me introduce you. This is Hua Tian Film Corporation\u2019s Deputy Director, Wang Xun.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Lin Fan nodded gently but didn\u2019t really bother about him. There were people that relied on these men to survive but Lin Fan wasn\u2019t bothered by them at all.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-3\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>He had just responded with an \u2018Oh\u2019 indifferently, causing many people to be in awe of him. This was the grandeur of a big shot.</p><br/><p>To the celebrities, Wang Xun was someone that they might not even be able to suck up to even if they tried but right now, Lin Fan had acted indifferent towards him, leaving them speechless.</p><br/><p>This was the difference between them. A difference that was impossible to overcome.</p><br/><p>For Wang Xun to have reached his status, he had to have some self-awareness. Like Chief Yang, he quickly took out his name card and presented it to Lin Fan with both hands. \u201cNice to meet you, Master Lin. This is the first time we\u2019ve met. I\u2019m Wang Xun.\u201d</p><br/><p>He received the name card, took a glance, and kept it in his pocket.</p><br/><p>Chen Bao Guo was laughing in his heart. Since Master Lin had arrived, the atmosphere had completely changed.</p><br/><p>They had been showing off mercilessly before but now, they had completely stopped. He was a little not used to this.</p><br/><p>Probably only a handful of people didn\u2019t know about what had happened on the Internet earlier on.</p><br/><p>At Nanshan Children\u2019s Welfare Institute\u2019s teaching block\u2019s opening ceremony, countless big shots had appeared as guests. Moreover, amongst them was Lu Li, a big shot among big shots.</p><br/><p>Even if Wang Xun and Yang Tai Shan combined, they wouldn\u2019t amount to Lu Li\u2019s fingertip.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-4\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>But even so, Lu Li had pushed aside all his other work to attend the opening ceremony. Anyone with a brain would have been able to tell how great the relationship they shared was.</p><br/><p>Wang Xun was rejoicing his luck. He had had some thoughts about Wu Huan Yue before but fortunately, he hadn\u2019t acted on them. Otherwise, it would probably be difficult for him to leave that place that day.</p><br/><p>And even if he managed to leave, he might not be able to endure the after effects.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Lin, I\u2019m going to go and change my clothes. I\u2019ll accompany you later to walk around,\u201d said Wu Huan Yue.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, go ahead.\u201d Lin Fan nodded.</p><br/><p>Then, Wu Huan Yue followed the manager to the changing room. At the site, the atmosphere was dead silent. It was as if everyone was following Lin Fan\u2019s lead.</p><br/><p>If Lin Fan didn\u2019t speak, nobody spoke.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan realized this as well, so he tried to break the silence. \u201cWhat were all of you talking about? So many of you are gathered here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Wang replied with a smile, \u201cWe were talking about a new show. Director Zhu is a capable man. Chief Yang and I want to shoot a new show in the next half of the year and invite Director Zhu as the director.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at Director Zhu and nodded. \u201cWith one look, I can tell that Director Zhu is very capable indeed. He is very responsible for his work and you should indeed carry on having Director Zhu direct your films.\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Zhu was exhilarated. \u201cThank you, everyone, for your compliments. I\u2019m beyond honored.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Xun wanted to get a little closer to Lin Fan. \u201cMaster Lin, as for the cast, I feel that Lady Wu should be the first female lead. With Lady Wu\u2019s ability, she would definitely be up for the task.\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-5\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>When Xie Qing, who was standing by Chief Yang\u2019s side, heard this, she was enraged. She felt as if she had misheard him.</p><br/><p><em>I\u2019m supposed to be the first female lead! How could you just change it all of a sudden?</em></p><br/><p>Just as she was about to speak out, Chief Yang glared at her, indicating for her to shut up.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Xie Qing felt as if she had been wronged.</p><br/><p>Some of the celebrities around were laughing in their hearts. <em>You were acting so smug before. Not anymore, eh? This is brilliant!</em></p><br/><p>Director Zhu nodded from the side. \u201cRight, right. Wu Huan Yue has the capability to be the main female character. I approve of this!\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Yang added, \u201cRight. That film is going to have big intellectual properties. If anyone else were to take up that role, we wouldn\u2019t be at ease. Lady Wu\u2019s acting skills have caught everyone\u2019s attention here. She will definitely be perfect for the job.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed. He looked at Chief Wang and Chief Yang and said jokingly, \u201cThere aren\u2019t any dirty deals involved, are there?\u201d</p><br/><p>Just as he said that, the atmosphere tumbled into awkwardness.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, of course not.\u201d Wang Xun shook his head anxiously.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-6\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Chief Wang added, \u201cThat\u2019s right. We, the people of this profession, hate those kinds of dirty deals the most. They completely taint the reputation of our industry. Looking at the criticism from outside, they all talk about how corrupted we are. We definitely have to put in our utmost effort to fill this industry with light and purity.\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Zhu looked at Chief Wang strangely as he grumbled in his heart. <em>Why does it sound so strange coming from you?</em></p><br/><p><em>You really are shameless.</em></p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed. \u201cCorruption cannot be completely obliterated but whoever dares to use such tactics on my people, I\u2019ll make sure they drown in suffering. Isn\u2019t that right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, right.\u201d Chief Wang and Chief Yang nodded anxiously. \u201cMake them suffer for a lifetime and make them regret it forever.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cIt\u2019s just a joke. Wouldn\u2019t they die if that happened? That would be against the law. How could someone like me, who often receives Good Citizen Awards, do such a thing? Isn\u2019t that right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, yes.\u201d They felt that what Master Lin was saying was meant specifically for them to hear.</p><br/><p>Also, they really believed what Master Lin had said.</p><br/><p>Although the Internet hadn\u2019t reported that Master Lin had killed anyone, they believed that he definitely had killed a number of people before.</p><br/><p>For example, the incidents at Qingzhou and the Northeast. He had charged into the lion\u2019s den single-handedly and come out in one piece, even defeating the enemy. How could he not have killed anyone?</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-7\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Even if the two of them were beaten to death, they wouldn\u2019t believe that he hadn\u2019t killed anyone before.</p></div>\n</div>"}

Although it took very long, he would definitely be able to resolve the problem for the children in Nanshan Children\u2019s Welfare Institute.</p><br/><p>*Ding ding!*</p><br/><p>Lin Fan answered the call.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Lin, how are things going?\u201d asked Zhao Zhong Yang anxiously through the phone. He didn\u2019t know how the situation now. Brother Lin hadn\u2019t been to Cloud Street in a few days. Initially, Zhao Zhong Yang hadn\u2019t dared to call for fear of disturbing Brother Lin.</p><br/><p>But as time passed, and with the rest of them in the shop urging him, he decided to call.</p><br/><p>\u201cThings are going pretty well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang: \u201cBrother Lin, does that mean you\u2019ve succeeded?\u201d</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t ask too directly. If Brother Lin didn\u2019t answer this question, he wouldn\u2019t ask more. However, he felt that it would have a pretty big impact on Brother Lin if it failed.</p><br/><p>After all, there was the situation on the Internet. A lot of people were waiting to laugh at Brother Lin.</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang really felt helpless about those people. They were a bunch of people with nothing better to do than to laugh at others.</p><br/><p>In the research lab, Lin Fan finished producing another set of artificial limbs and said with a smile, \u201cOf course I succeeded. Don\u2019t you know who I am? If I fail on something like this, it would mean that I\u2019ve wasted my whole life.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve really succeeded?\u201d Zhao Zhong Yang was thrilled. His tone suddenly went very high as if he couldn\u2019t believe it.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cYes, really. Why would I lie to you? If there\u2019s nothing else, I\u2019m hanging up. I still have to make a few more artificial limbs. When I\u2019m done here, I\u2019ll head back.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was busy working. In these two days, he had helped many of the children from the welfare institute regain working limbs. Although they weren\u2019t real limbs, these limbs allowed the children to move about like normal people.</p><br/><p>\u201cMmm. We\u2019ll be waiting for you at the shop.\u201d</p><br/><p>They hung up.</p><br/><p>Cloud Street!</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan immediately came over and asked, \u201cHow is it? Did Brother Lin succeed?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang nodded. \u201cMmm. He succeeded. Judging by his tone, there weren\u2019t any problems at all. But I still don\u2019t know the full situation.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian commented from the side, \u201cAre you all stupid? What are you still waiting here for? If you want to know, why don\u2019t you just go straight to the welfare institute?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right!\u201d Zhao Zhong Yang suddenly realized that, then said to Fraud Tian in surprise, \u201cFraud, you\u2019re actually really wise! You even thought of something like that. Let\u2019s go. We\u2019ll go to the welfare institute right now to check out the situation.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d Wu You Lan was now very curious about this matter. She wondered what exactly had happened.</p><br/><p>Nanshan Children\u2019s Welfare Institute.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan and the rest appeared.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you all here?\u201d Han Lu asked curiously when he saw them.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe came to take a look at the situation,\u201d said Zhao Zhong Yang.</p><br/><p>Hearing that, Han Lu instantly smiled. \u201cThat\u2019s a good idea. Master Lin is really too incredible. I have to respect him. Let\u2019s go. I\u2019ll bring you to see how the children are doing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even though two days had passed, Han Lu was still thrilled when this matter was brought up.</p><br/><p>Lil\u2019 Fatty brought Little Mei Mei to play in the courtyard and they were running around crazily, so were the other children.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan was startled. \u201cIsn\u2019t something different here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Han Lu pointed at those children. \u201cCan\u2019t you tell what\u2019s wrong with these children?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>The group of them strained their eyes, trying to take a closer look but they couldn\u2019t find anything wrong at all. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? I can\u2019t see anything wrong with these children.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, these children seem really happy running around. But it isn\u2019t good to run around so vigorously. They might collide into something or trip over.\u201d Fraud Tian nodded in agreement. He had no idea what Han Lu had brought them here for.</p><br/><p>Han Lu smiled. \u201cCan you really not tell?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNope.\u201d Everyone shook their heads. Then, Fraud Tian suddenly jolted in shock. He said in disbelief, \u201cDon\u2019t tell me that these children\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing Fraud Tian\u2019s shock, Han Lu nodded. \u201cMmm. Your guess is right. These children were all previously crippled. But now, after putting on Master Lin\u2019s perfect artificial limbs, they can run and jump as they want. You couldn\u2019t tell, could you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cActually, it\u2019s not just you. Even I wouldn\u2019t have been able to tell if I hadn\u2019t known.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn. Those are actually artificial limbs. But they don\u2019t look any different from real limbs. They\u2019re so nimble. Can artificial limbs really do that?\u201d Zhao Zhong Yang was dumbfounded and he couldn\u2019t believe it.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Mei Mei, come here,\u201d Han Lu called out to the little girl beside Lil\u2019 Fatty.</p><br/><p>Lil\u2019 Fatty held Little Mei Mei\u2019s hand as they came over to Han Lu.</p><br/><p>\u201cUncle Han,\u201d Lil\u2019 Fatty and Little Mei Mei greeted.</p><br/><p>\u201cLil\u2019 Fatty, why didn\u2019t you greet me when you saw me?\u201d Fraud Tian pinched Lil\u2019 Fatty\u2019s face as he asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe,\u201d Lil\u2019 Fatty giggled. \u201cHello, Grandpa Tian.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang went forward and rolled up Little Mei Mei\u2019s pants. When he saw what was underneath, he couldn\u2019t help but be stunned. \u201cThis is incredible.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian was looking as well. Those legs were too nimble. They seemed like real legs. It was really astounding.</p><br/><p>Han Lu smiled. \u201cIf you ask me, it\u2019s Master Lin who\u2019s incredible.\u201d</p><br/><p>Over at the government side.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang had started working on this matter. He wouldn\u2019t look for just any leader because it would be useless. Instead, he went straight to the most powerful leader in Shanghai.</p><br/><p>He had already recorded videos and gotten through some procedures to prepare for the discussion.</p><br/><p>When he had brought this matter up to some leaders previously, no one believed him. They felt that Wang Ming Yang was just boasting or perhaps he was bluffing.</p><br/><p>Hence, they hadn\u2019t paid much attention to this matter at all.</p><br/><p>This time, Wang Ming Yang was looking for the biggest leader in Shanghai. He hoped that they would find a good way to collaborate on this project. According to his brother\u2019s wishes, the price definitely couldn\u2019t be too high.</p><br/><p>When Wang Ming Yang met Secretary Chen and they looked through the information and documents, Secretary Chen paid a lot of attention. When he found out that these limbs were developed by Master Lin, Secretary Chen was shocked.</p><br/><p>The last time he had met Master Lin was for the construction of the apartment building. But he hadn\u2019t expected something like this to happen not long after.</p><br/><p>To him, this was great news!</p><br/><p>Thinking about how Master Lin was actually willing to collaborate with the government in distributing these artificial limbs, Secretary Chen was speechless.</p><br/><p>He had met many people before.</p><br/><p>But he had never met someone who would give away a fortune that was put in front of him.</p><br/><p>After Wang Ming Yang had explained Lin Fan\u2019s intentions, Mayor Chen immediately nodded. As long as they could maintain the flow of production, he didn\u2019t demand a high price. He would abide by Master Lin\u2019s intentions.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

We\u2019ll just examine the computer. If there is no problem, we will return it in the same state.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d Lin Fan was less worried now. As long as the computer wasn\u2019t destroyed, it wasn\u2019t a problem.</p><br/><p>The people of the Internet Safety Department started getting busy.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, let\u2019s go,\u201d Liu Xiao Tian said.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded his head, before looking towards the rest of the shop owners, waving them goodbye. \u201cGuys, I\u2019ll make a move first. See you guys in a while.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBe safe!\u201d the shop owners replied, unwilling to let him go.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you need anything, tell us!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey\u2019re taking away my Little Boss. I am lost.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCome back quickly, will you?\u201d</p><br/><p>The journalists all rushed over after hearing wind of what had happened, but they were cordoned off by the police.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is going on?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot sure. Sir, could you let us in to take a look? As journalists, we have the right to know the truth about what happened.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, such a big news story and they don\u2019t let us cover it. They must be joking.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happened to Master Lin? He\u2019s being taken away.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHave you been hiding under a rock? Master Lin caused such a big situation to happen. If he wasn\u2019t taken away, it would be a great injustice.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWeibo is now filled with Master Lin\u2019s doings. All I can say was that he did a d*mn good job, but his tactics were rather violent and questionable.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf this happened out of the country, Master Lin would definitely still be okay. What a shame\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShame my a*s. He\u2019s only being taken away. We still don\u2019t know what is going to happen to him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d</p><br/><p>The journalists went around in pairs, discussing what had happened. Although they couldn\u2019t capture anything of value, they still stuck around. The shop owners were a gold mine of information.</p><br/><p>\u201cSir, how do you do? Can we ask what happened to Master Lin?\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Zhang was moody. \u201cThey took away Little Boss, and we really can\u2019t bear to see that happen.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are your views on this?\u201d the journalists continued asking.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat other views can I have? Little Boss is a good man. It isn\u2019t right that he was taken away. If I was younger, I would have gone out to save him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>In the police car.</p><br/><p>\u201cChief Liu, where will we be going?\u201d Lin Fan asked, his face calm.</p><br/><p>\u201cTo our police station. Don\u2019t worry, although you caused quite a huge situation, Bureau Chief and I will do all we can to protect you. Keeping you in our station would be a safer option,\u201d Liu Xiao Tian smiled, reassuring Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>\u201cSure, I\u2019ll follow whatever you say. I\u2019ll make a phone call first.\u201d Lin Fan whipped out his phone and made a call to his supporter.</p><br/><p>The phone was ringing.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Lin, how did everything go?\u201d Zheng Zhong Shan asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Zheng, I\u2019m headed to the local police station now. This thing escalated quite a lot, so I better lay low for awhile.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow big can it get? The three golden rules that I told you, you didn\u2019t break any of them, did you?\u201d Elder Zheng asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cI definitely didn\u2019t. How can you not trust me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good, how big can it get, really? Who\u2019s the one in charge of your case? Can you pass the phone to him? I\u2019ve got a few words to say.\u201d Elder Zheng asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure who\u2019s the one in charge of me yet, but the guys from the Internet Safety Department came down. I\u2019m thinking of staying about a month in jail, but that\u2019s what I\u2019m thinking. No matter what, me hacking into the bank and police servers today is definitely illegal.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBreaking the law is breaking the law, but sometimes you also have to look at the situation? Why do you have to be in jail for a month? Come let me arrange some things for you,\u201d Elder Zheng said.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t, please don\u2019t. This one month in jail is of my own request. If you ask around, you\u2019ll probably know the reason why. I won\u2019t say much for now,\u201d Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>After Lin Fan up the phone, Liu Xiao Tian turned to ask Lin Fan, \u201cWho did you call?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cZheng Zhong Shan, an old general,\u201d Lin Fan replied casually.</p><br/><p>\u201cZheng Zhong Shan?\u201d Liu Xiao Tian pondered for a moment, realising that the name sounded really familiar, but he thought that something wasn\u2019t right. At that instant, he looked at Lin Fan, astonished. \u201cDid you say Zheng Zhong Shan?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYep,\u201d Lin Fan nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn\u2026\u201d Liu Xiao Tian was stunned, looking at Lin Fan in unbelief. That person was a legend. Unthinkable, simply unthinkable.</p><br/><p>At night.</p><br/><p>The Internet Safety Department met at the same time, same place.</p><br/><p>Shen Jie Yun\u2019s face was stern, as his gaze fixated on the computer. The first order of business was to get the password to the computer.</p><br/><p>\u201cHas the password cracking specialist arrived yet?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be here soon.\u201d The atmosphere was tense.</p><br/><p>This case was more high-staked and important compared to anything they had ever done. Normally with their level of skill, cracking the password to any computer wouldn\u2019t have been an issue. But now, the issue was who the computer belonged to.</p><br/><p>It belonged to the Computer Guru!</p><br/><p>Was it that easy to crack the password to the computer which belonged to the Computer Guru? No one dared to handle his computer causally. All they could do was to wait for the password cracking specialist to arrive. After all, those guys were specialists in that field. Although the guys from the Internet Safety Department were all-rounders and knew a little about password cracking, it was better to leave this to the professionals who had been doing it for years.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe specialist is here.\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, a middle-aged man came over, his hand holding on to a briefcase.</p><br/><p>\u201cLeader Shen, what\u2019s the situation?\u201d the specialist asked.</p><br/><p>Shen Jie Yun pointed at the computer in front of him. \u201cElder He, you better be careful with this one. This computer hacked into every single national bank server today. Now with the password to this computer, we thought we better left this job to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder He\u2019s face became even more serious. He had heard of the legendary hacker online, and that his skills were beyond any human comprehension, and no one could compare.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet me try.\u201d Elder He had cracked countless passwords in the past, but at this moment, he had his doubts. \u201cI can imagine this hacker\u2019s password to be hard to crack. One wrong move and the whole hard drive would be wiped.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you talking about the case that happened five years ago?\u201d Shen Jie Yun asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cYep, it was the number one hacker in the nation. His computer was taken in by us. His password was twenty-one digits and was extremely complex. Even if we had managed to break it, it would have taken weeks, even months. And the skills of the hackers now are way better than before, and I have no idea how many digits this password is.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBoss, can we just call that guy and ask him for his password? We don\u2019t have to crack it if we just get it from him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh yeah, all we have to do is just ask. Why didn\u2019t I think about that before?\u201d Shen Jie Yun realised, looking stunned.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need. This is a rare opportunity, to be able to break into a hacker\u2019s computer. How about we try first? What do you guys think?\u201d</p><br/><p>No one said anything. Like Elder He, they all wanted to pit their abilities against this Computer Guru.</p><br/><p>Especially Elder He. Ever since he was young, he always had an interest in mathematical puzzles, and now that he had learnt cryptography, he had an unreserved interest in cracking codes.</p><br/><p>With the Computer Guru\u2019s computer right in front of him, he wouldn\u2019t feel contented until he managed to crack his password.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet us begin.\u201d Elder He opened his briefcase, taking out his gadgets. He opened the computer case and installed his own hardware.</p><br/><p>After working for half an hour, he finally got everything ready.</p><br/><p>Elder He looked at the computer, excited. \u201cAlright, everything is set up, let the hardware do its job. What do you guys want to drink?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJuice!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI want\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Beep beep!</p><br/><p>Password cracking success!</p><br/><p>At that instant, everyone gasped in unison.</p><br/><p>Everyone was stunned, unable to believe what they had just witnessed.</p><br/><p>Elder He looked astonished. \u201cHow is that possible?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt can\u2019t be, that was too quick.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cElder He, could there be an error?\u201d Shen Jie Yun asked.</p><br/><p>In everyone\u2019s eyes, this computer belonged to the Computer Guru. How was it possible that the password had been cracked almost instantaneously?</p><br/><p>\u201cThe password is as follows.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, the crowd looked on in silence.</p><br/><p>Everyone looked at each other in dismay.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? The password is just these six digits?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c123456. Isn\u2019t that a password that a child would set?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLeader Shen, is this the Computer Guru that you speak of? His password is only 6 digits. Anyone with basic knowledge of cracking passwords would be able to break it. Even if they didn\u2019t know it, they probably could have guessed it. I rushed all the way here from the Capital City just to crack this 123456?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shen Jie Yun was in a daze. He looked like he was about to cry. \u201cElder He, I didn\u2019t know\u2026 \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn it\u2026\u201d Elder He was speechless.</p></div>\n</div>"}

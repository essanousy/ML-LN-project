Of course, at such times, what had to be done had to be done. It wouldn\u2019t affect them much anyway.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t a matter of picking sides but they were protecting Lin Fan\u2019s image.</p><br/><p>With so many entrepreneurs around, how would they not be able to support the expenses of a single welfare institute?</p><br/><p>If they really weren\u2019t able, then they would\u2019ve wasted all their time.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan slowly went beside Chen Shi and whispered, \u201cLeader Chen, if you\u2019re about done, why don\u2019t you go back down and sit? You don\u2019t need to worry about this matter.\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-2\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Chen Shi\u2019s face was greenish and pale. He felt as if he had lost his face but with so many reporters around, he couldn\u2019t flare up. He could only laugh awkwardly, say a few more words of formality, and hurriedly get off the stage.</p><br/><p>Then, he didn\u2019t even stay any longer. He brought his people with him and left, saying that he had a meeting to attend.</p><br/><p>Of course, everyone knew that that was just an excuse to cover up his shame. But no one exposed him.</p><br/><p>The reporters were delighted at this piece of news. It was quite amusing. The leader had come, gotten rejected by Master Lin mercilessly, and left with a black face.</p><br/><p>That would be a pretty good headline.</p><br/><p>But this time, they once again had gained a new understanding of Master Lin. They hadn\u2019t expected Master Lin to have such wide connections in Shanghai.</p><br/><p>If they ignored Wang Ming Yang and Lu Li, all these connections were still very broad but they were considered normal. But if they included Wang Ming Yang and Lu Li into the mix, the amount of power in here was not to be looked down on.</p><br/><p>The important part was that these people seemed to treat Master Lin with respectful attitudes.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-3\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>What was the hardest thing in the world? Besides returning money, the hardest thing would be borrowing money.</p><br/><p>Although Master Lin had only casually asked, everyone\u2019s response had shocked the reporters.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Outside the welfare institute.</p><br/><p>Chen Shi\u2019s expression gradually calmed down. He was silent as he walked to his car.</p><br/><p>His secretary by his side also felt helpless. When they returned, they would probably be met with fury.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you know who those people below the stage were?\u201d asked Chen Shi.</p><br/><p>Chen Shi couldn\u2019t touch Master Lin, nor did he dare to. Otherwise, the repercussions would be too great. But those people below who had caused a scene below the stage, although he might not touch them, he wanted to at least know who they were. After all, perhaps they would have to come to him for help in the future.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure. I\u2019ll go back and check it,\u201d said the secretary. This matter wouldn\u2019t be too troublesome. All he had to do was gather some information from the reporters,</p><br/><p>His job was to serve the leader and find out whatever the leader wanted to know. However, this leader of his was a little narrow-minded.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-4\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>The opening ceremony ended very soon.</p><br/><p>Some of the entrepreneurs left while some closer ones stayed.</p><br/><p>He Cheng Han said with a smile, \u201cMaster Lin, you\u2019ve offended someone once again.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied helplessly, \u201cSo be it then. It\u2019s not the first time that has happened.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true. It really isn\u2019t the first time.\u201d He Cheng Han nodded. This kind of incident probably wouldn\u2019t happen to them very often but to Master Lin, it was just a common occurrence.</p><br/><p>Since he had gotten to know Master Lin, so many things had happened. Master Lin had quarreled with so many people and each time, he would flame the opposition in an earth-shattering manner.</p><br/><p>Some of those people, even to He Cheng Han and the rest, would make them fearful but to Master Lin, they were just like normal citizens. When most people would be scared, Master Lin would be fearless.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang patted Lin Fan\u2019s shoulder, then placed his arm around Lin Fan. With a beaming smile, he said, \u201cHey, what\u2019s there to be afraid of? If you lack funds, just tell me. How could I not give you funds? We\u2019re brothers. Am I right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, right. Whatever you say. But if you dare not to give me money\u2026if you dare, believe me, I\u2019ll f*ck you up\u2026\u201d Lin Fan laughed as he said.</p><br/><p>When Wang Ming Yang heard that, he immediately hid far away. \u201cDon\u2019t. Your words are making me scared. I ate some hot pot recently and my butt is hurting like mad. I won\u2019t be able to take it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck your mom\u2026\u201d Lin Fan had no words to say. They were around the same age and they joked around freely.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, although He Cheng Han and the rest were much older than Lin Fan, they were the same. It was just that they would act calmly in front of elders. But if they were all of the same statuses, their jokes wouldn\u2019t lose out to young people.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-5\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, I\u2019m going to leave first,\u201d said Lu Li as he shook Lin Fan\u2019s hand. Their relationship was quite subtle. They could be said to know each other well but they could also be said to barely know each other.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, then I shan\u2019t hold Chief Lu up. I\u2019m really thankful for your presence during the ceremony,\u201d said Lin Fan gratefully.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan felt that, although he was usually pretty good at offending people, he still had quite a number of friends.</p><br/><p>Lu Li smiled. \u201cAlright. If you have any problems in future, let me know. I\u2019ll stick to what I said before. I definitely won\u2019t decline any request from you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled and didn\u2019t say much else. He was quite grateful for the respect he had been given.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang looked at Lu Li. The two of them were far apart in status but he wouldn\u2019t admit defeat. Wang Ming Yang had started by himself from nothing while Lu Li had had a tremendous foundation to work from. Wang Ming Yang felt that if he himself had had that head start, he would definitely have done even better.</p><br/><p>However, he also understood that in his younger days, he had worked maniacally but had also been a little stupid. He had managed to work to where he was partly because he had taken many losses and paid for many mistakes.</p><br/><p>On the other hand, Lu Li\u2019s starting point had already been very high and the education he had received wasn\u2019t something an average person could receive.</p><br/><p>After Lu Li left, Lin Fan patted Wang Ming Yang\u2019s shoulder and smiled. \u201cWhat is it? You\u2019re unsettled because you saw him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou even saw through that. Let me ask you, did you put a worm in my stomach? Why do you know everything that I\u2019m thinking? Wang Ming Yang was startled, then he started scolding Lin Fan jokingly.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-6\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>He Cheng Han and the rest were very envious of Wang Ming Yang, to be able to be so close to Master Lin.</p><br/><p>They had also racked their brains to try and get closer to Master Lin but somehow, a wall would always be blocking them from making it happen. They could never reach the kind of relationship that Wang Ming Yang had with Master Lin.</p><br/><p>But even with their current relationships with Master Lin, they were already very satisfied.</p><br/><p>To them, Master Lin was loyal. Although they hadn\u2019t reached the point that they would talk about anything and everything, they could already be considered good old friends.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe reporters are still here. Let\u2019s go take a look. I think the reporters won\u2019t leave without asking a few questions. \u201cLin Fan had seen the reporters silently waiting and not stepping forward. It was as if they were afraid of affecting the opening ceremony, so they waited for him to finish before asking their questions.</p><br/><p>For that, Lin Fan felt quite grateful.</p><br/><p>Since it was like that, he wouldn\u2019t let them wait for too long.</p></div>\n</div>"}

He had really helped quite a few people with their gambling problems. He wanted to continue this as it was a win-win situation.</p><br/><p>Although the task didn't notify him that it was completed, he believed that he would complete it one day.</p><br/><p>At 'xx' broadcasting platform, this 'genre' of live streams went viral. It caused quite a number of people to start doing similar live streams. However, they couldn't match up to the standards of Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>However, there were some people that just discussed their life experiences and that attracted a lot of viewers. They also talked about their lives after quitting gambling ever since they had started watching Master Lin's live stream.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was getting complimented by every single person on the Internet and he was starting to be a little complacent. There were so many people that benefited from him but why was his task still incomplete?</p><br/><p>Of course, in the midst of completing his task, he was extremely happy to be able to help so many people quit gambling.</p><br/><p>At a certain house.</p><br/><p>Chen Qiang was already addicted to watching the live streams. He stayed at home every day just to watch Master Lin's live streams. He didn't bother much about it the first time he watched it. However, he started to reflect on it after watching it subsequently.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, the phone rang.</p><br/><p>\"Brother Qiang, we're winning so much money today from them! Do you want to join us? I assure you that you'll win,\" the employee tried to lure Chen Qiang to gamble again.</p><br/><p>Chen Qiang replied, \"I've stopped gambling. Don't ask me to join you anymore. It's all a scam.\"</p><br/><p>The person on the phone was shocked, \"Brother Qiang, how could it be a scam? Did someone tell you something bad? Don't believe them. It's all based on your abilities.\"</p><br/><p>Chen Qiang replied, \"Master Lin said it on his live stream. You lose 9 out of the 10 games you play. I feel like I've wasted my life. After seeing Master Lin play with poker cards, mahjong and dices on his live stream, I finally understood everything. Alright, I'll hang up now. I'm watching the live stream and I'll be looking for a job when it ends.\"</p><br/><p>*click*</p><br/><p>The phone was hung up.</p><br/><p>\"D*mn, that's crazy. It's the third person that mentioned Master Lin.\"</p><br/><p>He couldn't figure out who Master Lin was. So, he decided to do a search on the Internet using his phone. He realized that there were so many news articles about him.</p><br/><p>Especially the news about 'Quit Gambling Now' as many people shared about it.</p><br/><p>After reading about it, he finally understood everything. The fact that this Master Lin was trying to get people to quit gambling was obstructing him from earning money.</p><br/><p>He opened up his WeChat group consisting of his close friends. They were employees of casinos all over the world.</p><br/><p>\"How's your business recently? Did it get affected by that idiot Master Lin?\"</p><br/><p>After a while, the messages came flooding in.</p><br/><p>\"D*mn, I get angry every time I hear about him. I was prepared to lure someone over to cheat his money. Did you know what he told me?\"</p><br/><p>\"He actually said that Master Lin told everyone that gambling is a scam and that we'll always cheat their money. Don't you think that's crazy?\"</p><br/><p>\"The live stream was only played for a minority of people but even this small group of people caused so much trouble for us.\"</p><br/><p>\"Not all the viewers of the live stream are gamblers but those that love to gamble would definitely start to quit gambling. The entire web forum is filled with anti-gambling messages. It has such a great impact on us.\"</p><br/><p>\"I did a check. This Master Lin is from Shanghai. Who can teach him a lesson?\"</p><br/><p>\"Haha, Shanghai? I've been infuriated for a long time now. Recently, business is deteriorating. It seems like most of the big customers have been brainwashed and they decided to stop coming.\"</p><br/><p>\"Alright, leave this to me. I'll teach him to be smarter.\"</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>In the afternoon.</p><br/><p>The live stream ended.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan did some stretching and said, \"Broadcasting is not bad. I think I've helped many people to quit gambling.\"</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang was fully convinced of Lin Fan's abilities. \"You're too awesome. I saw many messages on the web forums and they were all related to you. I feel like it's really working out.\"</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan smiled. \"A lot of people left comments on your Weibo but there were also some that scolded you. I think you must have ruined their businesses.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled, \"Just ignore them. They're earning money through illegal ways. They'll have their retribution one day.\"</p><br/><p>*Ding ding!*</p><br/><p>Then, his phone rang. It was a call from an unknown number.</p><br/><p>He picked up the phone.</p><br/><p>\"You must be the Master Lin that does live streams.\" His voice was rather monotonous and gloomy. He sounded like a middle-aged man.</p><br/><p>\"Yes, you are?\" Lin Fan asked.</p><br/><p>\"Let me warn you that you should stop broadcasting. If you still continue to talk rubbish on your live streams, you'll face the consequences. We have already done a thorough check on you. You opened a shop on Cloud Street previously and now you've moved to Tian Hong Commercial Street. If you do not wish to have any trouble in the future, I suggest you to stop broadcasting. If not, you might lose a leg or even your tongue one day.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled and pointed at the phone. \"Someone's calling to threatening me.\"</p><br/><p>\"Don't think I'm just threatening you. If you don't believe it, you can continue with your live streams. You'll regret it when the time comes.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed, \"Are you afraid?\"</p><br/><p>The person was stunned. \"What am I afraid of?\"</p><br/><p>\"You're afraid that I'll reveal too many secrets? If more people know about it, it will be harder for you to continue with your business, right?\" Lin Fan chuckled. \"Also, don't even try to threaten me. I don't even know your name. If possible, just look for me. I can assure you that I won't kill you.\"</p><br/><p>\"F*ck your mom. Are you really that cocky? You don't even know me? Brother Long?\" Brother Long sounded really angry over the phone. He figured that Master Lin had gone overboard.</p><br/><p>\"Oh, Brother Long... \" Lin Fan purposely dragged his words. \"Sorry, I didn't know that.\"</p><br/><p>\"Alright, just wait. You think you can really make a difference with what you're doing? Stop dreaming. Also, if you have guts, just tell me your address. If not, you better watch your words,\" Brother Long scolded.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan just laughed.</p><br/><p>\"Alright, I'm on the 'xx' floor of 'xxx' apartment. Come over then.\"</p><br/><p>He hung up the phone.</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang looked at Lin Fan. \"Could he be from the casino?\"</p><br/><p>\"Who knows? There are all sorts of people nowadays and they're exotic,\" Lin Fan laughed as he said. He wasn't bothered by this at all.</p><br/><p>At the same time, Brother Long was seething after hanging up the phone.</p><br/><p>\"F*ck, he even tried to challenge me.\"</p><br/><p>His subordinates asked, \"Brother Long, what do we do now?\"</p><br/><p>Brother Long looked at his subordinates. \"Don't even ask me that. If I don't teach him a lesson, they wouldn't know who Brother Long is.\"</p><br/><p>The subordinates replied, \"Brother Long, are you sure you want to do that? It's\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Brother Long turned his eyes towards him. \"You think I'm a fool? We'll go look for him together. We'll stand in front of him and tell him that he's been marked by us. We wouldn't be breaking any laws if we just follow him around.\"</p><br/><p>The subordinate nodded and smiled. \"Brother Long, you're so smart, shrewd and ruthless. If all of us stand in front of him, he'd probably be scared to death.\"</p><br/><p>Brother Long smiled. \"You should learn more from me.\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

He looked extremely different. He was looking out of the window into the city.</p><br/><p>Then, he was breathing deeply and his four limbs seemed to have hardened. They were trembling.</p><br/><p>\u201cWang Ming Yang, what are you doing?\u201d Lin Fan said sternly.</p><br/><p>He had heard of people being possessed by ghosts but he had never seen it before.</p><br/><p>This was a common occurrence in the villages and the main reason for that was still unknown.</p><br/><p>Some said that it was a mental illness and some said that these people were possessed by ghosts.</p><br/><p>Nobody had a complete explanation for the occurrences.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am not Wang Ming Yang. I am Zhao Shan,\u201d Wang Ming Yang said. His tone had changed and it really seemed like he was possessed by a ghost.</p><br/><p>Xu Zi Le said worriedly, \u201cBrother Lin, what happened to Ming Yang?\u201d</p><br/><p>The others started to whisper amongst themselves.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid Chief Wang really get possessed by a ghost?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI think so.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow could it be? I thought ghosts only possessed those people who are plagued with illnesses? Chief Wang is so young. How could he be possessed by one?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right but regardless, it could still happen.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan touched Wang Ming Yang\u2019s forehead and arms. They both felt cold.</p><br/><p>His body was fine.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan\u2019s medical skills were considered the best. He could tell if a person had a problem just with one touch. However, Wang Ming Yang didn\u2019t have any problems at all.</p><br/><p>If that was the case, something was wrong.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, I think Chief Wang really got possessed by a ghost. Should I get a professional here?\u201d An employee asked.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan remained silent. Then, he asked, \u201cZhao Shan, right? What do you want?\u201d</p><br/><p>Since Wang Ming Yang was believed to be possessed, Lin Fan wanted to ask him some questions as if he was really possessed.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang trembled. \u201cI don\u2019t want anything. I don\u2019t want to leave. I want to stay here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said sternly, \u201cYou are not him. He is not you. Why are you staying here? Get lost!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Shan shook his head, \u201cI\u2019m not leaving, I can\u2019t bear to leave.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, Lin Fan really couldn\u2019t do anything about it.</p><br/><p>He knew little about people being possessed by ghosts. It was something that couldn\u2019t be explained by modern science.</p><br/><p>Then, he took out his phone and searched online to see what to do about it.</p><br/><p>He had to do it out of desperation. Although he didn\u2019t know what was happening, he wanted to see how netizens solved the problem.</p><br/><p>He was stunned after searching it online. There was a lot of news about it and many netizens shared about it.</p><br/><p>He felt that one of the methods would work.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan plucked a strand of hair from Xu Zi Le\u2019s head and placed it in front of Wang Ming Yang. Then, he allowed Wang Ming Yang to take a breath before he swirled the strand of hair in front of him thrice in the clockwise direction and thrice more in the opposite direction.</p><br/><p>The crowd was stunned and they didn\u2019t know what Master Lin was doing. Did Master Lin know something about being possessed by a deity?</p><br/><p>Xu Zi Le was dumbfounded. She could only rely on Brother Lin.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan then pulled the hair in front of Wang Ming Yang and struck it with a finger. The strand of hair broke into two.</p><br/><p>Huh?</p><br/><p>Nothing happened.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan felt that he had been pranked.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang had nothing wrong with him but he seemed mentally unsound. Lin Fan didn\u2019t know what had happened.</p><br/><p>He opened up the Encyclopedia\u2019s knowledge classifications and there was one about spirit possession. It was a small classification but it was expensive. It was impossible to buy with his current Encyclopedic Points.</p><br/><p>The Internet also had another method. If that didn\u2019t work, he would have to temporarily borrow the Encyclopedia\u2019s knowledge.</p><br/><p>Xu Zi Le and the others stood there and looked but nothing happened. They were nervous and they wondered if Brother Lin could handle the situation.</p><br/><p>However, they could only rely on Brother Lin.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan took a deep breath and grabbed onto Wang Ming Yang\u2019s collar. According to the Internet, one had to be stern. \u201cAre you leaving or not?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI am not leaving!\u201d Wang Ming Yang shouted.</p><br/><p>*slap*</p><br/><p>Lin Fan slapped him. According to the Internet, if the ghost didn\u2019t want to leave, one didn\u2019t have to treat it nicely. He/she could start hitting the person until the ghost decided to leave.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you leaving?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang was stunned. It was as if he didn\u2019t expect to be hit.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan saw that there wasn\u2019t a response. Hence, he slapped him consecutively on both sides of his face. He didn\u2019t give him an opportunity to speak.</p><br/><p>After more than ten slaps, Lin Fan said angrily, \u201cGet lost now!\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, a miraculous thing happened. Wang Ming Yang\u2019s eyes closed and his body froze. It was as if he had fallen asleep.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan measured his pulse and checked that there wasn\u2019t any problem with him.</p><br/><p>However, the situation didn\u2019t seem favorable. He didn\u2019t know if the method had worked or not. If it didn\u2019t work, he would have to unlock the \u2018spirit possession\u2019 classification temporarily. Although it was expensive, he had no choice.</p><br/><p>Xu Zi Le went forward, \u201cBrother Lin, is he okay now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan wasn\u2019t sure. \u201cI don\u2019t know. We have to wait and see.\u201d</p><br/><p>After a period of time, Wang Ming Yang opened his eyes. When he saw Lin Fan in front of him, he asked, \u201cWhy are you here?\u201d</p><br/><p>When he heard that, Lin Fan heaved a sigh of relief. That really worked.</p><br/><p>Indeed, the fastest way to overcome it was to use force.</p><br/><p>Xu Zi Le went to Wang Ming Yang, \u201cMing Yang, you scared me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang was in a daze. He didn\u2019t know what had happened.</p><br/><p>*hiss*</p><br/><p>\u201cOuch, why does my face hurt so much? What happened just now?\u201d Wang Ming Yang asked.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved his hand at the other workers. \u201cYou guys can make a move first.\u201d</p><br/><p>They nodded and left the conference room.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan pulled a stool over. He was curious and wanted to know if he had really gotten possessed by a ghost.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you really not remember what just happened?\u201d Lin Fan asked.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang shook his head, \u201cI don\u2019t remember anything but I know I got hit by someone. Why is my face swollen?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNobody hit you. It was a hallucination. Also, you got possessed by a ghost. You said you were Zhao Shan. Do you know who he is?\u201d Lin Fan asked.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang\u2019s face changed drastically when he heard that name.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan knew that he really knew this man. At the same time, he was curious about why the ghost had possessed him.</p><br/><p>Why would something like this happen in the modern society?</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang looked at Lin Fan, \u201cYou said I was possessed by a ghost called Zhao Shan? That\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cJust tell me your relationship with Zhao Shan. I don\u2019t really believe in these things. However, I am quite interested to find out about it after seeing what had happened earlier. I feel that it was weird.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang remained silent for a moment. Then, he nodded, \u201cI know Zhao Shan. He was my childhood friend. However, he died more than ten years ago. We went to the river to swim but he drowned. I have always remembered this incident and I feel like I caused his death\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan continued listening and Xu Zi Le didn\u2019t expect Wang Ming Yang to have faced such an incident.</p><br/><p>Then, Lin Fan stood up. \u201cIt\u2019s okay now. However, I think you should go back to the village and visit Zhao Shan\u2019s family. Since you were possessed by him, I don\u2019t think he did it for fun. Something must have happened. If something happened to his family, you should help them out.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang nodded. \u201cWhy do you know so much about this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled, \u201cThere\u2019s Baidu, why wouldn\u2019t I know about it? I\u2019ll head back first. Have a good rest.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat exactly happened to my face? Why do I feel like I got beaten up by someone?\u201d Wang Ming Yang asked curiously.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shrugged his shoulders. \u201cAnyway, I wasn\u2019t the one that hit you. You should ask someone else.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>After leaving, Lin Fan started to think about what had happened. It wasn\u2019t a mental issue. It could be that Wang Ming Yang had always been stressed and guilty about causing Zhao Shan\u2019s death. In the long run, it caused him to develop a split personality which would be activated randomly. Could that be the case?</p><br/><p>However, that was just Lin Fan\u2019s guess. He still didn\u2019t know the exact details.</p><br/><p>If he traded his Encyclopedic Points for the \u2018spirit possession\u2019 minor classification knowledge, he would definitely understand it. However, it was extremely expensive. Only an idiot would trade for that.</p></div>\n</div>"}

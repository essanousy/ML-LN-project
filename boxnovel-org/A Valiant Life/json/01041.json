Why did all of you come over from Shanghai?\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, he pointed at Wu Yun Gang. \u201cAnd you, aren\u2019t you supposed to be in Beijing? Why did you come here too?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang chuckled. \u201cBrother, you really don\u2019t treat us as friends, do you? This is a big event. If you don\u2019t inform them, that\u2019s pardonable. But if you don\u2019t inform me, you must be looking down on me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMing Qing, that\u2019s not right of you to say. What do you mean that it\u2019s pardonable to not inform us? Do you mean that only you have a deep friendship with Master Lin while the rest of us are just fair-weather friends?\u201d Wu Yun Gang argued.</p><br/><p>He Cheng Han said in an upset tone, \u201cYeah. My son was taught by Master Lin. Now, he\u2019s so obedient and he\u2019s so understanding. I\u2019ve been able to relax a lot more. Now that there\u2019s such an event, even if I\u2019m not invited, I have to come.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang looked at everyone. \u201cThat\u2019s enough. You guys can talk all you want but my relationship with my brother is not an average relationship. His father is my godfather.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHa! You call him your godfather but you didn\u2019t even know his birthday,\u201d He Cheng Han retorted. He wasn\u2019t giving Wang Ming Yang any face at all.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the group of them who were making a ruckus and he slapped his own head. \u201cAlright, alright. Just tell me which one of you is responsible for this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone, without hesitation, pointed at Wang Ming Yang.</p><br/><p>\u201cMing Yang, please give me a valid explanation. Otherwise, I won\u2019t forgive you. This little game of yours has caused this banquet to go out of hand,\u201d said Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang said, \u201cI won\u2019t admit to that. How did I make it go out of hand? I\u2019m here to celebrate. Oh right, Chief Lu asked me to bring this gift. He said it\u2019s for Uncle.\u201d</p><br/><p>A bank card.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the bank card and his brows furrowed. \u201cWhat\u2019s the meaning of this? How much is there inside?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c10 million,\u201d said Wang Ming Yang, \u201cHe said it\u2019s just a small gift for your old man to have some fun.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, having fun with 10 million dollars. He really is wealthy.\u201d Lin Fan laughed. He thought that Chief Lu had probably given him this money because he had saved his life the last time.</p><br/><p>But Chief Lu had already returned the favor. Why did he still give a present?</p><br/><p>If Lin Fan had known, he wouldn\u2019t have made that post on Weibo. Then, nothing would have happened. Thinking about it now, Lin Fan was really a little regretful.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s well-known that this guy is wealthy. His family business is huge. 10 million is just peanuts to him. Since he has given it, I think you should just accept it. At least it helps to take something off his hands.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the card and didn\u2019t think too much. He just kept it. When he goes back to Shanghai, he would have to look for Chief Lu and ask him just what was the meaning of this.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho called those helicopters over?\u201d asked Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>At that moment, everyone pointed at Wang Ming Yang once again.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was lost for words. He placed a hand on Wang Ming Yang\u2019s shoulder. \u201cMy brother, you really are awesome. You can even think of something like that and you\u2019re not afraid of any problems at all.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat problems could there be? This is a legal procedure. I only hired professional pilots. It\u2019s just a banner. There\u2019s nothing much to it,\u201d said Wang Ming Yang.</p><br/><p>Then, as if he suddenly thought of something, he added, \u201cOh right, your shop employees should be here soon. They\u2019re coming too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Lin Fan was startled. He was instantly speechless. <em>Why is everyone suddenly coming?</em></p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, don\u2019t go anywhere. Just wait here. Once I settle everything, I\u2019ll come here and have a good chat with you guys. Regarding this incident, I have to give you all a lesson.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan now felt overwrought. It had been so hard to manage Wang Ming Yang and the rest but now, Fraud Tian and the rest were coming too.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan wasn\u2019t worried about Fraud Tian and the rest of the guys but the main issue was Wu You Lan. How could he not know what was going on in her mind?</p><br/><p>If his mother were to find out, Lin Fan would have no escape.</p><br/><p>When he reached the banquet hall, Lin Fan saw a few people standing in the distance. Meanwhile, his mother was grabbing onto someone\u2019s hand. There was no need to think about who it was. Other than Wu You Lan, who else could it be?</p><br/><p>\u201cSon, come here.\u201d When Lin Fan\u2019s mother saw that he had come, she gestured for him to go over.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan sighed, then walked over. \u201cMom.\u201d</p><br/><p>He looked at Fraud Tian and the rest. \u201cYou guys go to the private room next door first. They\u2019re all there.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian and the rest had arrived and they were all a little hungry. Naturally, they didn\u2019t stay any longer. There was nothing much for them to do here anyway. You Lan could just stay here by herself.</p><br/><p>When Huang Yun Ge saw the lady over there, his jaw dropped and he was stunned. <em>What a beauty!</em></p><br/><p>Then, he whispered, \u201cDad, look. That kid is hiding way too many things. He has such a beautiful girlfriend but he actually said that he didn\u2019t have a girlfriend. If I really introduced those friends of mine to him, what do you think would have happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>To him, this guy was a romantic expert. He was definitely highly-skilled.</p><br/><p>But this guy had actually said that he didn\u2019t have a girlfriend. Moreover, he only ran a small shop but was able to find such a beautiful lady. That meant that he was definitely adept at picking up girls.</p><br/><p>Huang Ting gradually became displeased. He felt that this was really unlike what he had thought.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan looked at the Auntie in front of her and her face turned completely red.</p><br/><p>\u201cMom.\u201d Lin Fan went in front of his mother, then looked at Wu You Lan. \u201cWhy did you all come?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan had wanted to reply but Lin Fan\u2019s mother shot Lin Fan a glare. \u201cWhat are you talking about? It\u2019s good that they came. It makes me happy. Just ignore him, girl. We\u2019ll chat slowly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan nodded. She was a little nervous. Although she had seen Lin Fan\u2019s mother before, now that they were meeting once again, her nerves were hard to control.</p><br/><p>Huang Yun Ge said softly to his father. \u201cDad, look. This is a playboy. That beautiful lady came but he actually asked her why she came. He wanted to hide her existence. Even my sharp eyes were nearly fooled. Your classmate\u2019s son is not simple at all.\u201d</p><br/><p>Huang Ting frowned as he felt that the situation wasn\u2019t good. He kept feeling as if he had misjudged the situation.</p><br/><p>The surrounding people started talking softly amongst themselves as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not simple. This son of Elder Lin\u2019s isn\u2019t simple at all.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut really, this girl is really beautiful. If my son can find such a beautiful girlfriend, that would be great.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you think Elder Lin\u2019s son tricked her into coming?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard to say. Look, Elder Lin\u2019s son looks at a loss now. It seems as if this was unexpected.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan\u2019s father just sat there. Although his classmates spoke softly, he could hear them and he felt a little uncomfortable.</p><br/><p>It was as if he had been misunderstood and it felt very bad.</p></div>\n</div>"}

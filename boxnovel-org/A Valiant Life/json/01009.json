Master Lin</h1>\n<div class=\"chr-c\" id=\"chr-content\" style=\"font-family: Minion, serif, serif; font-size: 18px; line-height: 160%;\">\n<div class=\"cha-words\"><br/><p>The workers came out from the kitchen. One of them held a sheet of paper in his hands as he looked at the boss indifferently. \u201cThe hygiene in your noodle shop doesn\u2019t meet the requirements. It will be closed temporarily. Whenever you\u2019ve cleaned it up, come to us again to apply for the reopening.\u201d</p><br/><p>The outcome was simple. It didn\u2019t meet the requirements and it had to be closed down temporarily. But to the boss, this was plain slander.</p><br/><p>This was just a small shop and his whole family relied on it for a living. If it were to close down, who knew when it would be able to open up again?</p><br/><p>He was very aware of things. Negotiating with these people was not simple at all. If they really wanted to screw him over, they would be able to find all kinds of problems even if his shop was very well-maintained.</p><br/><p>For example, they could say that the drainage system wasn\u2019t good and it had to be fixed.</p><br/><p>Or they could say that the wall was a little dark and needed repainting.</p><br/><p>Or they could even say that there were wires exposed and that was too dangerous.</p><br/><p>Regardless, they could definitely find a reason if they wanted to prevent him from reopening his shop. The most common method was to tell him that they weren\u2019t in the office if he came to look for them. And if he asked when they\u2019d be back, they could just say that they didn\u2019t know and tell him to come back the next day.</p><br/><p>And if he were to come back the next day, they would say that they were away again. They would drive him mad and make him even want to kill himself.</p><br/><p>When the middle-aged woman heard those words, she laughed delightfully. \u201cI told you. Your hygiene is terrible. This place is not clean at all.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d The boss\u2019s face was green with rage. Then, he looked at the workers. \u201cThat\u2019s not possible. How could I not meet the requirements? Your checks aren\u2019t right.\u201d</p><br/><p>The workers frowned. \u201cHow is it not right? Are you saying that there\u2019s an issue with our checks? Let me tell you that hygiene is of utmost importance. Moreover, this is close to a primary school. If those students eat any dirty food and a problem arises, would you bear responsibility?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEnough talk. Take this sheet of paper. When you\u2019ve settled your hygiene, then you can open the shop again.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Lin Fan could see that they had purposely come to cause trouble for the boss. Then, he sat there as he held his phone. \u201cNot bad. Your check is very strict. I\u2019ve already recorded this on video.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing that, the workers were very displeased. One of them looked at Lin Fan and said, \u201cWhat are you doing? Don\u2019t you know that you can\u2019t record this? Hand over your phone. It has to be deleted!\u201d</p><br/><p>*Bam!*</p><br/><p>He slammed the table furiously.</p><br/><p>This noise made everyone in the shop jump in shock.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you crazy?\u201d the middle-aged woman yelled at Lin Fan as she had been given a shock as well.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan placed his phone on the table, then raised his head. Looking at those people, he said, \u201cAlright, my phone is here. If anyone of you has the capability, come and take it. I, Lin Fan, can\u2019t believe that you can bully someone like that.\u201d</p><br/><p>As these workers looked at Lin Fan, who had been sitting there silently all along, their muttered in their hearts.</p><br/><p><em>This face looks way too familiar.</em></p><br/><p>These workers usually just sat in their office and didn\u2019t do much each day. They would just go through their phones, looking at the news. They knew about the news on the Internet very well.</p><br/><p>Especially regarding people in Shanghai, they were incomparably knowledgeable.</p><br/><p>Recently, who had been stealing all the spotlight on the news?</p><br/><p>Besides Elder Dog, there was only Master Lin.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin,\u201d one of the workers cried out.</p><br/><p>Although the noodle shop boss didn\u2019t see the news much, he knew about Master Lin. Master Lin was a very famous being in Shanghai. When he heard that, he gasped in shock, \u201cYou\u2019re Master Lin?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded at the boss, then looked over at the workers. \u201cWhat do you base your checks on?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you checked the shop according to the rules and there was indeed a problem with the shop, I wouldn\u2019t say anything. I would even support you. But you guys are causing trouble for the shop owner because of this woman. I\u2019m sorry but I will be going against you to the very end.\u201d</p><br/><p>Those workers\u2019 hearts were thumping furiously. If Master Lin were to become serious, it would be a big problem.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, we really checked it according to the rules,\u201d one of the workers stammered. At this point, he could only reply stubbornly.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright then. I\u2019ll make a call to your unit and let them send someone else to check. It shouldn\u2019t be an issue. But if there happens to be an issue with your checks, then don\u2019t blame me for being merciless.\u201d Lin Fan\u2019s penetrating gaze was directed at these workers.</p><br/><p>These workers knew that Master Lin wasn\u2019t from their line of work and he had no authority over them. However, Master Lin\u2019s status was not average.</p><br/><p>Moreover, they had acted unreasonably this time. There had indeed been no issues with this shop\u2019s hygiene. Compared to other shops, it was already much more hygienic.</p><br/><p>How could they have known that Master Lin had actually been here all along? Moreover, Master Lin had even seen and heard the entire situation clearly.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho are you? What does this have to do with you?\u201d the middle-aged woman scowled, \u201cStop being so meddlesome!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBrainless vixen.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shot her a glare, then ignored her. Instead, he looked at the workers. \u201cIn life, you have to be able to carry out your job honorably. I call tell that you don\u2019t want this to go down badly either. I\u2019ll give you one last chance. Tell me what exactly is going on.\u201d</p><br/><p>These workers exchanged looks with each other. If they had been facing someone else, perhaps they would have felt lucky. But facing Master Lin, they really didn\u2019t know what to say.</p><br/><p>Then, they said honestly, \u201cMaster Lin, please forgive us. We didn\u2019t purposely come to cause trouble for this shop. This is our leader\u2019s wife. She called us over and we couldn\u2019t reject. That\u2019s why\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The noodle shop owner didn\u2019t say a single word as he just listened from the side. He hadn\u2019t expected Master Lin to stand up for him. This made him feel exceptionally moved and excited.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat nonsense are you speaking? Do I even know you?\u201d The middle-aged woman saw this and was startled. Although she was a brute, she still had a brain. She knew that if people found out that she had been using her husband\u2019s authority to bully others outside, things would be very bad.</p><br/><p>However, she hadn\u2019t expected that these guys would tell everything to this young man.</p><br/><p>Had they gone mad?</p><br/><p>The workers looked at the woman helplessly. \u201cThis is Master Lin. Don\u2019t hide the truth anymore. Otherwise, things will turn out very badly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at these workers and said, \u201cGive your leader a call and explain the situation. If he can come, tell him to come. If he\u2019s busy, then it\u2019s fine. Regardless, this shop is clean and it meets the standards. You can\u2019t use your power to bully others.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, yes.\u201d The workers nodded, then hurriedly took out a phone and called their leader.</p></div>\n</div>"}

He didn\u2019t want to be involved in it anymore.</p><br/><p>The situation after this would definitely be very complicated. Although he wasn\u2019t afraid of it, he felt that he should know his place. If not, who knew if they would threaten his life?</p><br/><p>As for Godfather Qin, Lin Fan knew that he was going to be fine since he was a powerful Godfather after all. As for Godfather Liu, he was probably doomed.</p><br/><p>Because of the incident in the northeastern region, Lin Fan\u2019s Weibo became really famous. Although the situation was still progressing, his actions had stirred up emotions in the righteous townsfolk.</p><br/><p>When he opened up Weibo, he felt as if he was being blinded.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019d lick only for Master Lin,\u201d ID \u2018why am I so powerful\u2019 admired Lin Fan a lot. As a northeastern man, he was ecstatic when he read about the incident.</p><br/><p>It was because the goddess that he had been secretly in love with was taken away by Godfather Liu. He could only watch him take her away and do nothing about it.</p><br/><p>Now that Master Lin had done something for him, he even felt that he wanted to sacrifice his \u2018clean body\u2019 for Master Lin.</p><br/><p>However, he felt that he could look for his goddess again. As long as she had a reasonable explanation, he would forgive her.</p><br/><p>After all, a man should be benevolent and forgiving.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs Master Lin going to leave again?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s highly possible. I have to go to Shanghai to visit Master Lin at least once in my lifetime. However, I have to finish my studies first.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy wish is to enroll in the Shanghai University so that I can meet Master Lin every day.\u201d</p><br/><p>After reading those comments, Lin Fan felt great about himself. He had done another righteous deed as the righteous Master Lin. Then, he started to type.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan: \u201cAll I can say is that it wasn\u2019t really planned. I didn\u2019t expect to have lured such a big catch. I am afraid and I would be disappearing tonight. Goodbye, fans of Righteous Fan.\u201d</p><br/><p>After posting that, comments started flooding his Weibo.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck, if you didn\u2019t pretend to be awesome this frequently, we\u2019d be good friends.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m tearing up from laughing. These two fellas must be regretting their actions. Why did they agree to dine with Master Lin?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, Master Lin is such a low-profile person. He did such a good deed but he is still so humble about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan read those comments, he felt really great about himself.</p><br/><p>It looked like there were fans that understood how low-profile he was. Why would he want to attract so much attention for?</p><br/><p>At night!</p><br/><p>He booked a night flight as it was cheaper. He didn\u2019t book it in advance as it was really expensive.</p><br/><p>He wore a cap and went to process his paperwork.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t want to be recognized. Every northeastern person would recognize him. If he were to meet righteous fans, that would be great. However, if he met those that wanted to take revenge, he would be doomed.</p><br/><p>Even the thought of it frightened him.</p><br/><p>At midnight.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan stood at the Shanghai Airport. The feeling of returning back to Shanghai was great. However, he had returned alone again.</p><br/><p>When he was prepared to leave the airport, a voice could be heard.</p><br/><p>\u201cBro\u2026 Here!\u201d Wang Ming Yang shouted as he raised his hands at the waiting area.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn! Why are you here?\u201d Lin Fan was stunned. He didn\u2019t expect someone to fetch him from the airport but it felt great. Then, he walked out of the departure hall and came before Wang Ming Yang. He patted his shoulder, \u201cThat\u2019s nice of you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang laughed, \u201cI knew you\u2019d be here by midnight. How can I not be here? Let\u2019s go. You haven\u2019t eaten, right? Let\u2019s go for supper.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright. Now that you mentioned it, I am famished.\u201d Lin Fan smiled and they placed their arms around each other and left the airport together.</p><br/><p>On the way out, Wang Ming Yang kept talking.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s impressive. I was in disbelief when I read the news. You dragged these two Godfathers down, aren\u2019t you afraid of dying?\u201d Wang Ming Yang felt that this good friend was really too awesome. If not for what had happened, he wouldn\u2019t have believed that things would progress to this stage.</p><br/><p>After the news articles were published, he finally understood how horrifying Godfather Liu was.</p><br/><p>If he were to go to the northeastern region to settle scores with Godfather Liu, he probably wouldn\u2019t be able to come back.</p><br/><p>However, his good friend was awesome. He went there and destroyed them. Who else besides him was this powerful?</p><br/><p>At Wang Ming Yang\u2019s villa.</p><br/><p>Xu Zi Le was alone in her room. She had returned to Shanghai after acting in a film. She wanted to have some alone time with Ming Yang. However, Ming Yang left her alone at midnight. He said that he was going to the airport to fetch his friend.</p><br/><p>She understood how he felt but she felt that he should have brought her along.</p><br/><p>However, Ming Yang rejected her. He asked her to sleep first as the two of them wanted to catch up with each other\u2019s lives.</p><br/><p>Xu Zi Le was talking to her best friend on her phone. Her best friend was also a celebrity who had a pretty good status in the industry. Her salary was at least ten million dollars for a film.</p><br/><p>Xu Zi Le: Mo Han, are you asleep?</p><br/><p>Qin Mo Han: Nope, what is it, baby?</p><br/><p>Xu Zi Le: Nothing much. I just wanted to ask something. My boyfriend went out at midnight to fetch his friend from the airport. He left me alone at home and it seems like he treats his friend better than me. Do you think there\u2019s a problem with that?</p><br/><p>Qin Mo Han: Are they engaging in homosexual practices? There\u2019s definitely a problem with that.</p><br/><p>Xu Zi Le: \u2026</p><br/><p>All she could think of was Ming Yang and Brother Lin being alone in a hotel. She didn\u2019t dare to think of what followed next.</p><br/><p>Then, she dismissed that thought. She didn\u2019t want to think of that as it was impossible.</p><br/><p>Qin Mo Han: Is Master Lin the friend that you\u2019re referring to?</p><br/><p>Xu Zi Le: Yes, Brother Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Mo Han: \u2026</p><br/><p>At the roadside shop.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was eating barbecued food. He suddenly felt like someone was thinking of him and he paused.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang was having a good time eating and he asked, \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shook his head, \u201cNothing much. I just feel like someone is thinking of me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha,\u201d Wang Ming Yang laughed despicably. \u201cStop acting, that\u2019s impossible. It\u2019s just your hallucination.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, I think it\u2019s hallucination too,\u201d Lin Fan said and nodded. However, he wondered who was the one that was thinking of him.</p><br/><p>After eating supper, they took a cab home.</p><br/><p>The next day!</p><br/><p>At Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan appeared at Cloud Street, the other shop owners gathered around him.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Boss, you are back! How\u2019re things at the northeastern region?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, we were really worried after seeing the news. It\u2019s so dangerous.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShh, do you know who Little Boss is? How can it threaten him?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled, \u201cThat\u2019s right. What\u2019s so dangerous? With my ability, who can possibly hurt me? Did anything happen to my shop during the past few days?\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Liang said, \u201cNothing really happened. However, you just got cursed a lot.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn!\u201d Lin Fan was stunned after hearing that. \u201cSomeone scolded me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. Who told you to leave without saying anything? The queue for your scallion pancakes is crazy. I wonder how many people there are.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, every time I see the people queueing up for the scallion pancakes, I always feel like they\u2019re really pitiful. Sigh.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was a little helpless. Was that his problem?</p><br/><p>He went to his shop.</p><br/><p>Everyone was curious as to how Lin Fan resolved the matter in the northeastern region and they kept asking him questions.</p><br/><p>They felt that the matter was too unbelievable. However, the truth was right before their eyes and they had to believe it.</p><br/><p>They really admired Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Especially Zhao Zhong Yang, who almost kneeled in front of Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>This man was too awesome.</p></div>\n</div>"}

Then, they started whispering into each other\u2019s ears.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis Shanghai association person actually dares to go on stage?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis Zheng Bin knows no restraint. What kind of kung fu could that association person actually know? He\u2019d get an internal injury with one strike. Should we hurry up and stop this? Otherwise, something bad might really happen.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. No matter what, this association is a government recognized unit. It\u2019s considered to be the department that passes down martial arts in our society. If someone from the association gets injured, it would be really bad.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI think we should let it be. He willingly went on stage, so we couldn\u2019t possibly tell him to come down. He would be ashamed. In the past, martial arts practitioners like us would settle disagreements by fighting to the death. We wouldn\u2019t care about things like giving face.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true. But this association person really doesn\u2019t know how to hold his temper. Does he really think that this is a performance for normal people? This is true martial arts. Someone can get beaten to death.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA newborn calf isn\u2019t afraid of the tiger. Look at that young man. He\u2019s white and pure. His hands are soft and tender. It\u2019s clear that he doesn\u2019t practice martial arts. I\u2019m afraid he only knows some superficial moves. It would be good for this kind of city person to receive some punishment. At least he would have some reverence for martial arts practitioners like us in the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>The association members who had come along were very worried now. \u201cChairman Wang, will there be a problem if President Lin goes up?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2026\u201d Wang Yun Jie really didn\u2019t know how to answer. It was hard to say if there would be a problem. Even Wang Yun Jie wouldn\u2019t be a match for that guy on the stage.</p><br/><p>As for President Lin, of course Wang Yun Jie knew he was powerful. However, the current situation was difficult to predict. Then, he turned to Jiang Fei as if to ask him what were the odds.</p><br/><p>Jiang Fei was stunned after seeing President Lin go on stage. He hadn\u2019t expected President Lin to really do it. Something bad could really happen. This time, they had come just to spectate and record some of the scenes at the event so that they would be able to publish it when they go back.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look at me. I don\u2019t know what to say either.\u201d Jiang Fei shook his head. He really didn\u2019t know what to say. They knew about President Lin\u2019s strength. He was really powerful. However, the opponent was not weak either.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian was hooting from the side, \u201cKill that fella. Let him know what happens when he acts too arrogantly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang pointed his phone camera at the stage.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrothers, watch closely. Our Master Lin has gone on stage. According to my prediction, the opponent will be on the ground within three seconds.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c666\u2026 It seems that Master Lin can\u2019t stand it anymore. He\u2019s going to use real kung fu to educate that guy. That guy is too unbridled. It was fine that he won but he still went on to humiliate the opposition.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. Although the opposition is a foreigner and we should be proud to see our own people win, I can\u2019t feel proud at all now. Our image has been thrown to the ground by him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSending gifts. As long as Master Lin teaches this guy a good lesson, I\u2019ll send a big gift later on.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut Master Lin wouldn\u2019t get beaten down, would he? I\u2019m doubtful.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c^Are you dreaming? If Master Lin could get beaten down, I would each sh*t .\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan was clenching her tender fists tightly. She appeared to be very excited.</p><br/><p>When Jiang Fei saw this, he was dazed. Why did they seem as if Master Lin would win for sure?</p><br/><p>On stage.</p><br/><p>Huang Ru Zhong saw the situation in the arena and said softly, \u201cWho is this young man?\u201d</p><br/><p>The old-timers by the side shook their head. \u201cNo idea. But I think he\u2019s a representative from the Shanghai association. Why did he go on stage all of a sudden?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. This association helps us a lot with promotion. If this Zheng Bin injures this person, it would be hard to explain.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, Huang Ru Zhong spoke, \u201cZheng Bin, that\u2019s enough.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zheng Bin stood in the arena arrogantly. Then, he nodded at Elder Huang. \u201cElder Huang, don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll definitely go easy on him. I\u2019ll just make him search for his teeth on the ground.\u201d</p><br/><p>Huang Ru Zhong shook his head. He couldn\u2019t foresee that person doing anything to Zheng Bin. After all, that young man looked plain and he didn\u2019t seem like a martial arts practitioner at all. He had probably only learned some moves for display in the association.</p><br/><p>But Huang Ru Zhong decided to let it be. Since that person had stepped on stage, he couldn\u2019t tell him to come down. Otherwise, that young man would lose face.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Zheng Bin looked at Lin Fan and said, \u201cKid, I was already unhappy with you since yesterday. Now that you\u2019ve come on stage, I shall teach you a lesson.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at him and shook his head. \u201cYou really don\u2019t have good morals.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShut up. That has nothing to do with you. I\u2019ll teach you a lesson today,\u201d said Zheng Bin maniacally. Then, he raised his hands and prepared to teach the opposition a lesson.</p><br/><p>\u201cTiger Fist, the eighth fist of Cha Quan. Coincidentally, I know this technique too. Let me give you a lesson then,\u201d said Lin Fan as he raised his fists as well.</p><br/><p>The people below the stage were astonished.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn. This guy knows Tiger Fist as well?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt can\u2019t be. Wasn\u2019t the Tiger Fist only passed down to Zheng Bin? And if it\u2019s from another branch, he couldn\u2019t possibly dare to compete with Zheng Bin. He must be bluffing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Now, it\u2019s gotten interesting. I wonder how this will turn out.\u201d</p><br/><p>The association members were stunned. \u201cDoes President Lin really know that technique?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. But looking at his stance, it seems quite alike.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian was curious after seeing this. \u201cStrange. Doesn\u2019t the kid only know Ba Gua Zhang? When did he learn this technique?\u201d</p><br/><p>The biggest shock he had gotten from Lin Fan was when he found out that this kid\u2019s Ba Gua Zhang was actually better than his at such a young age. This made Fraud Tian, who had trained his whole life, feel a tremendous pressure. He felt as if his whole life couldn\u2019t compare to one young man.</p><br/><p>Now that Lin Fan said that he was going to use Tiger Fist, it was a little scary.</p><br/><p>Even the old-timers on the viewing platform were curious.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis Tiger Fist requires a deep level of Qi in the Dantian. It consists of steady strikes and it\u2019s as fierce as a tiger. People who practice it typically have strong and muscular builds. But this young man looks rather weak. He doesn\u2019t seem like a Tiger Fist user at all. Could it be that he just learned some moves for show and he\u2019s treating it like the real thing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMmm\u2026 It\u2019s hard to say. I feel that we should have gotten this young man to come down. If something really happens, it would be difficult to settle.\u201d</p><br/><p>Those big shots on the viewing platform were discussing. They didn\u2019t have much faith in Lin Fan because they could tell the level of one\u2019s martial arts skills just by looking at his or her energy and physique.</p><br/><p>However, this young man\u2019s physique seemed lackluster.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re good. You actually dare to humiliate me by using my technique. Watch out.\u201d Zheng Bin was enraged. Like a tiger descending from a mountain, he pounced at Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>To Lin Fan, this was like bullying a newborn baby. He felt a little reluctant to strike.</p><br/><p>*Bam!*</p><br/><p>*Bam!*</p><br/><p>*Bam!*</p><br/><p>After three resounding blows.</p><br/><p>The initially noisy venue sank into a deep silence.</p></div>\n</div>"}

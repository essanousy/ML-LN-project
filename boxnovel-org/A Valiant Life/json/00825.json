Now that some of his friends here were familiar with Lin Fan, Lin Fan did not need him to introduce him anymore.</p><br/><p>This was not needed. All the people that knew him all went up to say hello to him.</p><br/><p>He Cheng Han was in a good mood recently and said, \u201cMaster Lin, you\u2019ve become more and more well off. You look a lot more handsome compared to the last time I saw you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed and then raised his thumb to He Cheng Han. He said, \u201cPresident He, I like these words that you\u2019re saying. As a young man, I have to get more and more handsome.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha,\u201d the surrounding people all laughed. They really enjoyed these salon gatherings.</p><br/><p>They were not just able to talk about the current major events but they could also talk about their business problems.</p><br/><p>Everyone was all on the same side so there were times where they would be able to help each other out.</p><br/><p>A few of the younger people who were around there felt a bit unhappy as they looked at this stuck up chap. They were not happy that he was cooler than they were.</p><br/><p>Jin Yun Min walked up to Lin Fan and said, \u201cMaster Lin, it\u2019s been awhile.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDirector Jin, judging by your expression, it looks like the past year has gone by smoothly,\u201d Lin Fan smiled and said.</p><br/><p>Jin Yun Min gratefully replied, \u201cThis was all thanks to Master Lin\u2019s advice, letting me drown in profit this past year,\u201d then, he looked in the distance and beckoned, \u201cCome here, you little brat.\u201d</p><br/><p>In the distance, there was a young man, whose hair was very well styled, sitting down. During the gathering this time around, there were many people who brought along the extra burden in their family members. They were hoping to use this salon gathering to boost their reputation.</p><br/><p>\u201cDad,\u201d Jin Rui obediently came to his dad.</p><br/><p>\u201cGreet Uncle Lin,\u201d Jin Yun Min instructed him.</p><br/><p>Jin Rui looked at Lin Fan. Jin Rui was normally based in Beijing and very rarely came to Shanghai. However, when he came to Shanghai this time, he was dragged to this gathering by his father. Or in more common terms, his father brought him here to see a different side of the world.</p><br/><p>He still did not recognize the fact that this was the internet famous Master Lin. However, the fact that his father was making him call the man in front of him, who did not look too far off in age from him, as \u2018uncle\u2019, was pretty embarrassing.</p><br/><p>However, he could not ignore his father\u2019s orders so he forced himself to say, \u201cUncle Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Lin Fan nodded. He looked at the young man in front of him and could sense his lack of willingness.</p><br/><p>Jin Yun Min smiled and said, \u201cThis is my son. He\u2019s been going about his life aimlessly back in Beijing and I brought him here to see the other side of the world. Also, I brought him here to meet all these uncles and aunties so that maybe they\u2019ll be able to take care of him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed and said, \u201cDirector Jin, your son is not bad. However, there\u2019s something that I don\u2019t know if should tell you guys or not.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jin Yun Min was stunned. Then he anxiously asked, \u201cMaster Lin, please tell us.\u201d</p><br/><p>In this place, everyone all knew that Master Lin\u2019s fortune telling was extremely accurate. There was not a single word that came out of his mouth that was rubbish.</p><br/><p>And today, Master Lin was going to give advice to his own son. He definitely could not hold back his excitement.</p><br/><p>He did not care if it was something good or bad. He could accept it.</p><br/><p>At least they would be aware of the situation and he could let his son change.</p><br/><p>Jin Rui was stunned as well.</p><br/><p><em>Master Lin?</em></p><br/><p><em>Wasn\u2019t this the chap who has been very popular online? My own father actually knows Master Lin and he has never mentioned it to me before?</em></p><br/><p>\u201cThere isn\u2019t too much with Little Jin. It\u2019s just that his private life is a little messy. I\u2019m afraid that the circle of friends that he has picked up isn\u2019t too good and there is a disaster in their midst. He shouldn\u2019t be hanging out with the bad company anymore,\u201d Lin Fan was very direct in his words.</p><br/><p>When Jin Rui heard this, he was dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>He never thought that Master Lin would actually say these type of words. Was he not just throwing him into the fire?</p><br/><p>Sure enough, he realized that there was an obvious change in the expression on his father\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>\u201cDad, I didn\u2019t. I\u2026\u201d Jin Rui rushed to try and refute what Lin Fan had said.</p><br/><p>However, he had underestimated how much confidence his father had in the words from Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Jin Yun Min glared at his son and said, \u201cYou\u2019re not going to go back to Beijing for now. You\u2019re going to stay with me here in Shanghai and then we\u2019ll go back together. When we reach back to Beijing, I\u2019m going to sort you out.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, he looked at Lin Fan with a face full of gratitude and said, \u201cThank you very much, Master Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan patted Jin Yun Min on the shoulder and said, \u201cThere\u2019s no need to thank me. We\u2019re all on the same side. The least I could do was to warn you about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m f*cked\u2026\u201d Jin Rui was completely astonished. He had no idea what was going on.</p><br/><p>If he had known that this was going to happen, then he would not have come. Even if he threatened to beat him to death.</p><br/><p>To Jin Rui, he had so much anger inside of him and he just wanted to lash out. However, he knew that if he were to lash out, then it would just be a death sentence for him.</p><br/><p>His boss would definitely immediately teach him how to be a good son.</p><br/><p>When the others saw this situation, they also rushed to ask their children to come over and seek Master Lin\u2019s help.</p><br/><p>In the past, they felt like this salon, although had its meaning, did not have that much of a use.</p><br/><p>However, now that they feel like they will be able to assimilate into this social circle, they will be very excited.</p><br/><p>One gathering a year was not a problem at all. They would be able to ask Master Lin questions as well as get advice from Master Lin. His words would all be beneficial. To them, this was really too good of a profit to turn down.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, it\u2019s been a long time,\u201d Zhu Zhu walked over and said.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at Zhu Zhu and could not help laughing and saying, \u201cYour complexion is looking pretty good.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone here knew how quick Zhu Zhu was at changing boyfriends. It was at a blistering pace that made everyone scared.</p><br/><p>Some of them could not take it. They felt that as a lady, she should not act like that.</p><br/><p>However, to some, they felt like it was understandable.</p><br/><p>Men were allowed to change girlfriends as often as they pleased. So were ladies not allowed to do the same?</p><br/><p>With regards to this type of heroic lady, Lin Fan had no objections to it. He felt that that was their own issues and he had no right to object.</p><br/><p>Zhu Zhu said, \u201cI\u2019m placing a lot of emphasis on taking care of my own body now. My body still requires a lot of protection.\u201d</p><br/><p>He Cheng Han laughed and said, \u201cZhu Zhu is really not bad now. She\u2019s found a new boyfriend and rumor has it that they\u2019re preparing to talk about marriage already.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Zhu gave a short and shallow laugh and said, \u201cWe\u2019re still not at that level yet. I\u2019ll have to see how obedient he is.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone blushed in shame.</p><br/><p>Up till now, Chen Li Hao was still a little embarrassed to say hello to Lin Fan. He did not give him the best impression when they met the first time.</p><br/><p>However, when Lin Fan saw him, he said, \u201cBrother Chen, did you become rich already? You didn\u2019t even acknowledge me after seeing me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing like that Master Lin. I was just a little embarrassed,\u201d Chen Li Hao awkwardly laughed and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you still gambling?\u201d Lin Fan asked.</p><br/><p>Chen Li Hao immediately waved him off and said, \u201cI quit gambling a long time ago. I\u2019ve abolished it already.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Hao (different one) laughed and said, \u201d Chen Li Hao took a massive loss that time, which had some huge consequences. If not for Master Lin giving him a taste of what skill was, he would have lost his entire family fortune.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say things like that, you\u2019re the one who will lose everything,\u201d Chen Li Hao refuted. He was very grateful to Master Lin. If not for him, he would have gone further and further down the path of gambling and to the point of no return.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, as long as you\u2019re not gambling anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone was all gathered together talking and chatting idly.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang finished up what he was doing and came back and said, \u201cWhy are you guys still chatting here? Come, let\u2019s go upstairs, sit down, drink some wine and talk.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p></div>\n</div>"}

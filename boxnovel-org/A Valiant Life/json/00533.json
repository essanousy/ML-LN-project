Every day, there was new eye-catching news that drew everyone\u2019s attention away.</p><br/><p>However, the shop owners of Cloud Street missed Little Boss very much.</p><br/><p>Elder Liang and a few other people came to the \u2018Master Lin\u2019 shop.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Boss should be back soon, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Zhang said, \u201cIt should be soon. It\u2019s already been twenty-something days. He should be back in just a few days.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sister Hong smiled, \u201cI wonder how it feels like to be in there for a month. But why do I keep feeling as if Little Boss is being lazy?\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Liang said in surprise, \u201cSister Hong, you have that feeling too?\u201d</p><br/><p>Sister Hong smiled, \u201cThis isn\u2019t just a feeling, it\u2019s the truth!\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian came over. \u201cSigh, it\u2019s like this everytime. With a flick of a wrist, he\u2019d be gone and we\u2019d be out of luck. The townsfolk wait for his scallion pancakes every day. Why have I followed such an unreliable person?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, Elder Tian, you should be content with your situation. Look at how, ever since you\u2019ve followed Little Boss, those scallion pancake-buying townsfolk pass you a cigarette every time they see you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian said cheerily, \u201cDon\u2019t talk about that. That has to do with my personal charm. That\u2019s why they pass me cigarettes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, there\u2019s been a development on WeChat. A one dollar art sale and it\u2019s by our Nanshan Children\u2019s Welfare Institute. What\u2019s going on?\u201d Elder Liang said in astonishment as he used his phone.</p><br/><p>\u201cNanshan Children\u2019s Welfare Institute?\u201d Fraud Tian was startled as well. He took over the phone. \u201cYou\u2019re not kidding. I know, it must have been done by him. When I went to Nanshan Children\u2019s Welfare Institute a while back, all their artworks had been taken away. They said it was for some activity, to raise funds for the children\u2019s education.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan unlocked her phone. \u201cI\u2019m buying an artwork. These children\u2019s artworks are really pretty good.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Zhong Yang was broadcasting, \u201cBrothers, open your WeChats and participate in the one dollar art sale. Do your part to help the children. I, Brother Yang, will thank you all by broadcasting while dressed up as a female as long as the donations reach a certain level. I don\u2019t go back on my words.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c666\u2026in order to see Brother Yang\u2019s broadcast, I shall contribute a hundred dollars.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, I am waiting for the female clothing broadcast. I\u2019ve already bought from the sale.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough these drawings are average-looking, they are pretty good as screensavers.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already bought.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBrothers, WeChat really is problematic, selling one piece for one dollar. How long do I need in order to buy ten thousand pieces? If only I could change the price on my own.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWealthy man, please share some wealth with me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a really wealthy man.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Zhang smiled. He was just doing his best on Weibo in order to contribute an effort for the children.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrothers, no need to spend too much. Buying one piece each is enough.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat a kind broadcaster. I\u2019ll give you a \u2018like\u2019.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>In a certain group.</p><br/><p>Autumn Sword Fish Killer: \u201cMy underlings, come out. Participate in the one dollar art sale. Whoever doesn\u2019t participate, don\u2019t call me your Brother anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>The group members sprang to life.</p><br/><p>\u201cWow, that\u2019s just what I want.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is to help children. One dollar isn\u2019t much. We have to buy.\u201d</p><br/><p>WeChat was now widespread and in everyone\u2019s hands, hence, the impact of this was very huge. Many people saw this activity promoted by WeChat when they opened their WeChats.</p><br/><p>One dollar sale?</p><br/><p>What kind of activity is that?</p><br/><p>Many citizens were puzzled when they opened their WeChats.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, this kind of sh*tty drawing for one dollar? I wouldn\u2019t want it even if it was free.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWeChat must have gone crazy for money. This is a high-level money-earning method.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, this is to help children from an orphanage to receive education. It\u2019s a charity activity.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis Nanshan Children\u2019s Welfare Institute is here in Shanghai. Most of the children in there were previously kidnapped by human traffickers.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI never thought these children would be able to do such good drawings. I have to buy them. It\u2019s time to change my screensaver.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck, didn\u2019t you just say that they were a sh*tty drawings? Why are you saying that they\u2019re good now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is different. This is charity. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI agree.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis drawing is not bad. It has a good creative concept.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCreative concept my a*s. These children might not even know what that means.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEnough nonsense. As long as I like them, it\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>In the detention house.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan knew that today was the time for the WeChat promotion. He unlocked his phone to take a look.</p><br/><p>*ring ring*</p><br/><p>A call came from Zhang Long.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, the activity is online. We just checked. In ten minutes, we\u2019ve raised fifty thousand dollars. This is just the beginning. The number of buyers will keep increasing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said gratefully, \u201cI really have to thank you, Chief Zhang.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Zhang said, \u201cNo need to thank me. This is something that we should do. But are you doing well in the detention house, Master Lin? You should be coming out soon, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cMmm, I\u2019ll be out in a few days. I\u2019ve had to trouble you with this matter, Chief Zhang.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Zhang said, \u201cMaster Lin, you\u2019re too courteous. Being able to help these children is the wish of all our staff members. Don\u2019t you worry, this activity will definitely succeed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan had very much confidence in this as well. The people of this country were very charitable, so this kind of activity would definitely receive large support. However, the follow up must be done well too.</p><br/><p>After all, nobody liked not knowing how their donated money would be used. Hence, they had to be transparent with their follow up work.</p><br/><p>Also, this kind of matter would definitely draw questions. The charity industry in the country was simply too complicated. There were many cases of people using charity funds to feast and dine, drive luxurious cars and live in luxurious villas. These cases cause even the organizations that do real charity work to be tainted black.</p><br/><p>In a certain work unit.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you all doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cChoosing drawings. WeChat promoted an activity, a one dollar art sale, to help those pitiful children.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI feel that the drawings are really pretty good. I wonder what kind of brains these children have to be able to make such abstract artworks.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLook at this drawing I\u2019ve chosen. How is it? Doesn\u2019t it look great?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, it\u2019s really pretty good. What\u2019s its serial number? Although I don\u2019t know what it\u2019s supposed to be, I think it looks pretty good.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSerial number 003. This is drawn by a Lil\u2019 Fatty. The description says that it\u2019s a tiger.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c???\u201d</p><br/><p>In a certain household.</p><br/><p>The daughter said, \u201cDaddy, I want to buy an artwork. I want to help the little children.\u201d</p><br/><p>The father looked at the activity, then smiled as he patted his daughter\u2019s head, \u201cOkay, okay. My daughter is really kind. Daddy will buy it for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Across the country, countless people had noticed this sale. To them, one dollar wasn\u2019t much and they could buy it on a whim.</p><br/><p>Moreover, such a charity project was sure to receive positive comments.</p><br/><p>However, what soon followed was negative news.</p><br/><p>On a certain web forum.</p><br/><p>A thread had been posted.</p><br/><p>\u2018Discussion about the feasibility and dark secrets of the one dollar art sale\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cToday, I\u2019ve been flooded by people in my circle of friends who were all buying artworks. But when I saw them, they simply could not be called art. They should be called scribbles. If I drew these, I could draw several thousand in a day. Of course, that\u2019s not the important part. The important part is the motive of this one dollar art sale. Below, I will give an analysis for everyone to see. They say that they\u2019re doing this to raise education funds for the Children\u2019s Welfare Institute but according to what we know, these Children Welfare Institutes are managed by the government. We aren\u2019t needed to worry about their educational aspect. Although one dollar isn\u2019t much, WeChat is relying on quantity. If everyone buys from them, it will be a tremendous amount. I can\u2019t help but suspect that this one dollar art sale is a way of dredging for money. Everyone, please do not be cheated.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, is this true? I feel that it makes some sense.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you all realize that this is all just for one orphanage? What about other orphanages? Just what is the history of this Nanshan Children\u2019s Welfare Institute, for them to specially do such an activity?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat does make some sense.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is f*cking annoying. Everyone in my social circle is raving about this. I won\u2019t give a single cent.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSome of the artworks are really not bad but some are clearly done by four-year-old kids. Do you really believe that a four-year-old kid can draw good Chinese artworks?\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, another type of public opinion had arisen.</p><br/><p>This type of public opinion became more and more popular.</p></div>\n</div>"}

In the morning.</p><br/><p>At a luxurious villa.</p><br/><p>Xu Zi Le woke up in a daze. She sat on the bed with her head lowered and didn\u2019t regain her senses for a long time. It was as if she was thinking about something.</p><br/><p>Her gaze shifted to the drawer beside the bed. It was open. The condoms inside drew her attention.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happened last night?\u201d</p><br/><p>She couldn\u2019t figure out what had happened. However, she had a feeling that something very serious had happened.</p><br/><p>Suddenly!</p><br/><p>A loud scream rang out.</p><br/><p>\u201cMing Yang, wake up, quick!\u201d Xu Zi Le shook Wang Ming Yang.</p><br/><p>The previous night, Wang Ming Yang had gotten wasted as well. Even now, he was still in a daze. \u201cWife, what is it? I\u2019m really tired.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. Something bad happened last night. I think I said something extreme to Huan Yue.\u201d Xu Zi Le recalled bits and pieces of memories from the previous night and was trying to piece them together.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang was startled for a moment as he recalled the incident. \u201cWhat is it? What happened between him and Huan Yue? Did they do it?\u201d</p><br/><p>*Flapping sound*</p><br/><p>Xu Zi Le flung open the bedsheet. \u201cLet\u2019s go. Follow me to take a look outside. If something happened, I would be able to tell.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang didn\u2019t think much before getting up. He hadn\u2019t even gotten out of his clothes before going to sleep the previous night.</p><br/><p>In the living room.</p><br/><p>Xu Zi Le saw the clean dining table and was immersed in thought. \u201cThe table has been cleaned up. This isn\u2019t right. When their emotions are raging, how could they think about cleaning up the table? Could they have cleaned it up this morning?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother, are you here?\u201d Wang Ming Yang shouted in the living room but no one replied. \u201cLet\u2019s go. Let\u2019s take a look upstairs.</p><br/><p>The first room hadn\u2019t changed at all.</p><br/><p>The second room hadn\u2019t changed at all either.</p><br/><p>When Xu Zi Le looked at the third room, she felt that something wasn\u2019t right. \u201cThis isn\u2019t right. How could there be nothing at all? Could it be that nothing happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang was confused as well. But when he saw Zi Le sprawl on the bed, he was curious. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m smelling it. If something happened, there\u2019ll definitely be a smell.\u201d Xu Zi Le sniffed but there weren\u2019t any strange smells. Then, she looked closely at the pillow and the bed. \u201cThere aren\u2019t even any hairs. It can\u2019t be that nothing happened, could it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt can\u2019t be. Brother Lin drank so much wine too. How could he have been able to control himself?\u201d Xu Zi Le had taken on the role of a detective as she analyzed the situation.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang said, \u201cYou could just give Huan Yue a call and ask about yesterday, couldn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow can I do that? How can I ask a lady so directly? Can\u2019t you call Brother Lin to ask?\u201d said Xu Zi Le.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang looked at the time. \u201cIt\u2019s still too early. But okay, I\u2019ll call him to ask.\u201d</p><br/><p>He had gone all out the previous night to drink with his brother but in the end, he didn\u2019t even know what had happened.</p><br/><p>When he woke up, things were already in this state.</p><br/><p>The call got through.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang smiled as he said, \u201cBrother, did last night feel good? Did anything happen?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xu Zi Le rolled her eyes at Ming Yang. His words were really crude.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan: \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you, calling me at six in the morning? I\u2019m still sleeping at home.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, don\u2019t be angry. Are you alone or are you with someone?\u201d Wang Ming Yang asked anxiously.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m alone. Do you think I don\u2019t know about your evil schemes? I\u2019m hanging up. I\u2019m going to sleep.\u201d</p><br/><p>*Clatter!*</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang shrugged. \u201cLooks like it didn\u2019t happen. He\u2019s sleeping at home.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Xu Zi Le was stunned. \u201cIt can\u2019t be. Even that didn\u2019t work? But I feel like I said something last night that\u2019s making me anxious right now. No. I have to give Huan Yue a call and ask her indirectly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Very soon, the call was over.</p><br/><p>Xu Zi Le sighed, \u201cSigh. Looks like it\u2019s not the fated time yet. Huan Yue has already gotten up to exercise. And I realized that something\u2019s a little wrong with Huan Yue. It\u2019s as if I really said something bad last night.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut I just can\u2019t remember what I said.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang shook his head. \u201cForget it. We\u2019ll just let them be. We can\u2019t help anyway. If we force it and something bad happens, it would be hurting them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xu Zi Le nodded. \u201cMmm. That\u2019s true.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cloud Street!</p><br/><p>9 AM.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan appeared on time. Regarding the previous night\u2019s incident, he was helpless. <em>Wang Ming Yang and his wife are too much. Just to get me drunk, they went all out to drink with me.</em></p><br/><p><em>Don\u2019t they know who I am? Am I someone who would get drunk so easily?</em></p><br/><p>Every day, the townsfolk who came to Cloud Street to queue for the scallion pancakes were neverending. When they saw Little Boss, the townsfolk were very excited.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Boss is here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled and waved at the crowd. Then, he looked at Fraud Tian. \u201cHave the numbers been given out?\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian replied, \u201cI gave them out long ago. We\u2019re just waiting for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Very soon, the ten servings of scallion pancakes were prepared. Then, he sat on the chair and rested. Recently, he had been very tired.</p><br/><p>However, when he unlocked his phone, he realized that he had successfully gone on the trending list once again.</p><br/><p>\u2018Master Lin subdues the Beijing association. The association president changes his order on site.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018The shocking Master Lin. Can anyone still stop him?\u2019</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang looked at his phone as well. \u201cBrother Lin, this time, the news is really extreme. These comments are all explosive.\u201d</p><br/><p>The netizens.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, this is too awesome. A single person subdued the entire Beijing association. This kind of thing can only be done by Master Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. I\u2019m shocked. How f*cking awesome can he get? Look at the situation at the scene. It\u2019s really a tragic sigh.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn. The Shanghai association is really lucky to have Master Lin as the Vice-President. In the future, who would still dare to be impudent to Master Lin?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. I don\u2019t even know what to say about that Vice-President Jiang. Even I felt pity for him when he was screaming miserably on the ground but who would have thought that he would stand up like normal right after Master Lin left? That was completely an act!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, this is strange. Why isn\u2019t anyone coming out to criticize him? This move by Master Lin has a huge impact. Are those big shots really not going to flame him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFlame my a*s. Master Lin said it very clearly on Weibo. He would go against whoever flames him. Do you think those famous people would still dare to flame Master Lin?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn. That\u2019s f*cking awesome.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was just as the netizens had said. When some famous people saw this situation, they had really been prepared to flame Master Lin. To them, the severity of this matter was way too high.</p><br/><p>But when they saw Master Lin\u2019s post on Weibo, they all resisted the urge.</p><br/><p><em>You must be kidding me.</em></p><br/><p><em>This guy will really go against us.</em></p><br/><p><em>If he comes to us and has a direct confrontation with us, we wouldn\u2019t be able to take it.</em></p></div>\n</div>"}

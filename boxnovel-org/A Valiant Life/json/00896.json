How could he immediately come and make scallion pancakes after performing a huge deed? Of course, he had to have a good rest and soothe his soul first. He thought that those townsfolk would understand him.</p><br/><p>He had taken a look at the news on the Internet and he felt that it was a little exaggerated. At the same time, he couldn\u2019t help but admire himself a little. He hadn\u2019t expected himself to be so f*cking awesome, to think nothing of money. His heart couldn\u2019t quite take it.</p><br/><p>But since it had been publicized already, nothing could be done to change it. This also saved him a lot of trouble.</p><br/><p>However, the class of knowledge that he had unlocked this time made him rather excited. The angling major classification of knowledge\u2026 Could it be that it was for him to go fishing?</p><br/><p>Of course, he would go and test it out in the afternoon to see just how it worked. After all, no matter what, it was still a major classification of knowledge. It had to have some kind of advantages that he didn\u2019t know yet.</p><br/><p>If all he would manage to get were fishes and prawns, then the Encyclopedia could go to hell.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-2\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cLittle Boss\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan reached Cloud Street, the shop owners all came out of their shops. Their faces were filled with admiration.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Boss, you\u2019re too f*cking awesome.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Boss, just what goes through that mind of yours? A large sum of money and you just tossed it away like that. Don\u2019t you feel a little heartache?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean by that? Do you think Little Boss is someone like that? Little Boss is doing this for the good of the masses.\u201d</p><br/><p>Not only the shop owners were in admiration of Little Boss. Even Little Boss was in admiration of himself.</p><br/><p><em>What exactly was going through my mind when I made that decision?</em></p><br/><p>After pondering for a while, he still couldn\u2019t figure it out.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-3\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled and said, \u201cYou all ask me what goes through my mind, but even I have to ask myself that. However, if I kept the prescription for myself, I would have become a tycoon. Then, this shop probably won\u2019t be open anymore. Sigh, I really regret it. That work-free life was just within my grasp but I threw it away.\u201d</p><br/><p>When the shop owners heard this, they instantly became anxious. \u201cDon\u2019t say that, Little Boss. We all approve of your actions. You handled this matter beautifully. Am I right, everybody?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, right. It was beautifully handled. We have to learn from you, Little Boss.\u201d</p><br/><p>Of course, they couldn\u2019t bear for Little Boss to leave Cloud Street. If Little Boss really left, Cloud Street wouldn\u2019t be the same anymore.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled before entering his shop.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian looked at Lin Fan with a sad smile as he sighed and shook his head. It would\u2019ve been better if he didn\u2019t know about this. Now that he knew, his heart was aching very much.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan came over to Lin Fan. \u201cBrother Lin, I really worship you.\u201d Then, she hugged Lin Fan\u2019s arm as if she was overly-excited and she couldn\u2019t control herself.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, don\u2019t be like that. It isn\u2019t the first or second time you\u2019ve said that. Just get used to it,\u201d said Lin Fan with a laugh. Then, he patted Wu You Lan\u2019s head and said, \u201cCome, give me a massage. Recently, I\u2019ve been so busy that my muscles have become stiff. I need to relax a little.\u201d</p><br/><p>He thought highly of Wu You Lan\u2019s massaging technique. Although she wasn\u2019t a professional, she was almost as good as one.</p><br/><p>To Lin Fan, this matter had finally ended. There was no need to talk about it anymore.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-4\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>He unlocked his phone and looked at Weibo.</p><br/><p>His followers had increased sharply. But those comments about the prescription made Lin Fan a little confused.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood people will live happy and peaceful lives\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, Lin Fan laughed. It was only a matter of time before the prescription would be spread.</p><br/><p>On the Internet, there were netizens saying that foreigners would be benefiting from this unfairly.</p><br/><p>But to Lin Fan, that was just overthinking. This kind of logic wasn\u2019t right.</p><br/><p>Sufferers couldn\u2019t be categorized by their nationalities. They were all suffering from pain that ordinary people would never be able to imagine. Moreover, because the prescription was Chinese medicine, it would let foreigners know about the greatness of Chinese medicine</p><br/><p>It was a sort of promoting.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan thought that his student must\u2019ve been delighted. After all, this was what he had wanted to do his whole life, to promote Chinese medicine to the world and to let everyone understand the importance of Chinese medicine.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Shanghai Chinese Medical Academy.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Zhao Ming Qing was meeting a leader. However, the atmosphere wasn\u2019t quite right. The leader wanted to move him out of Shanghai to another Chinese medical academy.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-5\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>If Shanghai Chinese Medical Academy was classified as a first-class academy, then that academy they wanted to send him to would be classified as a very low-grade academy. The people who studied there were mainly just there to pass time and the environment wasn\u2019t conducive for learning.</p><br/><p>This was the result of instructions being passed down through many layers of people. Of course, the leader wouldn\u2019t just remove Zhao Ming Qing from his appointment, but appointing him to somewhere else was the best option.</p><br/><p>They said it was to improve the environment for studying Chinese medicine and that it was a huge responsibility.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing sighed. He understood in his heart that the higher-ups must\u2019ve been enraged and decided to take a strike at him.</p><br/><p>\u201cMing Qing, this is a task given to you by the organization. It is a huge responsibility and I hope you won\u2019t let us down,\u201d said the leader naggingly. He spoke of it highly as if it was some kind of important mission.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing didn\u2019t really want to go, mainly because it was too far from Shanghai. But since the leader had spoken, he couldn\u2019t do much. To him, it was still a Chinese medical academy but for this Chinese medical academy to recover from its poor state in a short period of time was practically impossible.</p><br/><p>In the end, the told the leader that he would think about it.</p><br/><p>Naturally, the leader was fine with that. They had already appointed the new Academy Director and thus, Zhao Ming Qing was completely blocked out.</p><br/><p>Even if he chose not to go to the new academy, Shanghai Chinese Medical Academy already had a new Director.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-6\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>In the office.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing was silently pondering. He hadn\u2019t expected the higher-ups to be so furious about this. There was nothing wrong with what his teacher had done. It was all for the benefit of the people.</p><br/><p>The sufferers would be able to treat themselves back to health just by buying and brewing the medicine according to the prescription. The procedure was not complicated and it was cheap too. It was a great thing for the sufferers.</p><br/><p>But he had never expected that the higher-ups would be so displeased about this.</p><br/><p>In the end, after much pondering, he took out his phone and gave his teacher a call. He was going to tell his teacher about the situation and move to the new academy to take up his appointment.</p><br/><p>After all, this was all for the development of Chinese medicine. It didn\u2019t matter where it was.</p><br/><p>Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was enjoying a massage when his phone rang. He answered the call.</p><br/><p>\u201cMing Qing, what is it?\u201d asked Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>On the other end of the call, Zhao Ming Qing was silent for a moment before saying, \u201cTeacher, I\u2019ll soon be going to another place to take up an appointment. I\u2019m calling to let you know.\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-7\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Lin Fan was startled. \u201cAppointment? What appointment? Aren\u2019t you doing well right now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing said, \u201cMy superior came to talk to me. He told me that I\u2019ll be delegated to Jingchuan Chinese Medical Academy to be the Director. I\u2019ve thought about it and\u2026\u201d Before he could finish speaking, Lin Fan interrupted.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait a moment, I\u2019ll take a look.\u201d Lin Fan frowned. Then, he did a search on the Internet for that academy.</p><br/><p>Upon looking at the description, he was furious.</p><br/><p>\u201cTo hell with that! Stay in Shanghai. What kind of school is that? At your age, aren\u2019t they sending you there to make you die of fatigue? If you are still willing to listen to me, then don\u2019t go. I\u2019m telling you to stay here in Shanghai as the Academy Director.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p></div>\n</div>"}

I see his car! Quickly catch up with it.\u201d</p><br/><p>When the reporter heard that, he quickly made a U-turn and chased after it. The other vehicles also followed him.</p><br/><p>They didn\u2019t expect Master Lin to have taken action so quickly. They almost didn\u2019t have enough time to react.</p><br/><p>However, it was lucky that they managed to catch up with him.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-2\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you think Master Lin is going to use to treat her?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho am I supposed to ask? If I knew the answer, I wouldn\u2019t have rushed here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSome of the professionals have expressed their thoughts online. They said that it\u2019s literally impossible.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho knows? I don\u2019t want to go against those professionals blindly.\u201d</p><br/><p>They were really convinced by Master Lin\u2019s power. The professionals had claimed a lot of things to be impossible only for Master Lin to prove them wrong.</p><br/><p>On the internet.</p><br/><p>Shanghai\u2019s best plastic surgeon immediately expressed his thoughts online.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn this situation, her face is already so severely burned that it is impossible to cure with the current technology. Master Lin was simply bullsh*tting. I have been a plastic surgeon for twenty over years and I definitely don\u2019t believe that Master Lin can help this female student regain her looks. It\u2019s impossible now and even ten years from now. If anyone of you doesn\u2019t feel confident in your looks, you can come and look for me. We are professional and our doctors are the best from all around the world. We can give you the perfect looks that you want. Please call the number below for inquiries.\u201d</p><br/><p>This surgeon spoke about this matter to gain some popularity.</p><br/><p>The plastic surgery industry had really stiff competition. If he didn\u2019t think of something to boost his popularity, it would have been difficult to survive.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-3\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cI feel that his words are really logical. Her face is so badly burned. If he can help her regain her looks, I\u2019ll broadcast myself eating sh*t.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what to say about Master Lin. I think he is overconfident. I wonder who gave him so much confidence.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a bunch of idiots. Is Master Lin someone that you can understand? If you don\u2019t believe in him, just wait for your face to get smacked.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, come at us. I\u2019ll put my face on the line for him to smack. I want to see how he\u2019s going to cure it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. This professional has more than twenty years of experience. How could he be wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if she were to go to Korea, she wouldn\u2019t be able to fix her face.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGuys, don\u2019t argue with these idiots. Let\u2019s just wait for Master Lin\u2019s good news.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, let\u2019s wait.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The discussion online wasn\u2019t really intense. However, an interesting poll appeared on Weibo.</p><br/><p>It was about whether the student could regain her looks.</p><br/><p>She will recover: 15032 votes.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-4\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>She won\u2019t recover: 52101 votes.</p><br/><p>The community on Weibo was paying close attention to this too. After all, it was about Master Lin. Now that there was a poll feature, they wanted to see what people thought about it.</p><br/><p>Of course, a lot of people felt that it was impossible.</p><br/><p>However, Lin Fan\u2019s fans had to believe it even if they didn\u2019t. Even if they were to lose, they still had to show their support for Master Lin.</p><br/><p>At the hospital.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan parked his car and looked at the nervous Jin Shan Ping. He smiled, \u201cDon\u2019t be too nervous. Be confident. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Jin Shan Ping nodded and tried to encourage herself.</p><br/><p>Regardless of the final outcome, she was already in her worst state. Why should she be afraid of it becoming worse?</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan raised his head and turned around. He was stunned by what he saw and he sighed. The group of reporters was really crazy. They actually followed him there.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Lin Fan smiled and asked.</p><br/><p>The reporters looked at Master Lin ecstatically, \u201cMaster Lin, yesterday, you said that you\u2019re going to treat student Jin\u2019s face. May I know how you\u2019re going to do it? Some of the professional plastic surgeons expressed their thoughts online and they said that it\u2019s impossible.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was stunned. He didn\u2019t know who he had offended. What did this have to do with those professionals?</p><br/><p>\u201cHow am I supposed to answer this? I am not on the same level as them. They want to improvise people\u2019s faces but I want to regain her looks. Therefore, they can\u2019t understand my methods at all.\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-5\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>He didn\u2019t care about what the professionals said. They felt that what Master Lin said made sense too.</p><br/><p>He was really young and it was infuriating to compare him to the experienced professionals.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, may I know how you\u2019re going to treat student Jin\u2019s face?\u201d A reporter asked.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan wanted to pretend to be awesome and say that he was going to use a medicinal pill. However, it would have sounded crazy. Therefore, he had decided to stay low-key.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to use the tools in the hospital and a medicinal pill that I specially crafted.\u201d He felt that it was better to put it that way.</p><br/><p>When the reporters heard that, they were stunned.</p><br/><p>What did Master Lin just say?</p><br/><p>He said that he was going to use the hospital\u2019s tools and a medicinal pill.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan felt that the expressions of the reporters seemed a little weird. He wondered if he had shocked them.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, how long would she need to recover?\u201d The reporters asked.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was fearless. He didn\u2019t even need to think about how many days he required. The medicinal pill had immediate effects. Furthermore, he loved to play with people\u2019s thoughts. He immediately raised one finger.</p><br/><p>The reporters were stunned, \u201cOne month?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shook his head, \u201cOne day.\u201d</p><br/><p>*clatter!*</p><br/><p>The reporters felt that Master Lin was crazy. He wasn\u2019t treating a cold. He was trying to regain his looks.</p><br/><p>Even if the best plastic surgeon were to perform the surgery, she would need a long time to recover.</p><br/><p>What did they just hear?</p><br/><p>Who would believe that she would only require one day to recover?</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled, \u201cAlright, don\u2019t say too much. Time is precious. I\u2019ll speak to you after this.\u201d</p><br/><p>He had the medicinal pill and he wasn\u2019t afraid of others knowing about it.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d Lin Fan smiled and said.</p><br/><p>Jin Shan Ping was really stunned. She just nodded and followed Lin Fan. She just heard what he said and she was also in disbelief.</p><br/><p>The Director of the hospital knew that the Godly Doctor Lin was coming to the hospital and he needed a surgical theatre. He immediately agreed to his request without any hesitation.</p><br/><p>However, Lin Fan didn\u2019t want anyone to see this surgery.</p><br/><p>Because if they were to see it, Lin Fan was afraid that they would question themselves about life.</p></div>\n</div>"}

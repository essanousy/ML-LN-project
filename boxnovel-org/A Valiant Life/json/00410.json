They didn\u2019t dare to call their dad because of what had happened earlier.</p><br/><p>When they found out that their dad had gone mad, they were stunned. Something bad was going to happen.</p><br/><p>Their father was a conservative person but he actually did something like this after having a mentor.</p><br/><p>Sigh!</p><br/><p>They wanted to call their dad and tell him to stop it as it would get him scolded. However, when they thought of their dad\u2019s temper, they thought twice about it. They were extremely anxious after seeing their dad sinking deeper into this mess.</p><br/><p>They felt that their dad was definitely going to get scolded online.</p><br/><p>At the hospital\u2019s research lab.</p><br/><p>The team of professionals was extremely busy and they couldn\u2019t even do anything in such a short time. They could only use the most basic methods to continue their treatment.</p><br/><p>Director Zhang was the main doctor for Wang Li Li and he was waiting for the team\u2019s solution to the problem but there was no progress. They only thought of basic treatment methods and it probably wouldn\u2019t be effective at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cSpecialist Chang, is there any solution?\u201d Director Zhang asked. He was being pestered by Wang Li Li\u2019s mother and that was all he could do. He had to ask the team of professionals about it. He had seen the news online that the Chinese medical doctor, Zhao Ming Qing, was trying to cure anorexia too.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t believe the piece of news at all. He thought it was just an act and that it wasn\u2019t possible for Chinese medicine to cure anorexia.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait, wait. We\u2019re still researching about it,\u201d Specialist Chang said.</p><br/><p>He was a little anxious too. Recently, the reporters had been watching this matter closely. Especially after the director of the Shanghai\u2019s Chinese Medical Academy had spoken about it, it was as if the reporters had gotten a big piece of news. They had been camping outside the entrance of the hospital and as long as there was something new, they would rush to interview them.</p><br/><p>The reporters\u2019 main target was Wang Li Li\u2019s mother. The reporters wanted to get something useful out of her, such as whether the team had come up with something effective or whether the patient, Wang Li Li\u2019s condition was improving or not.</p><br/><p>If not for Zhao Ming Qing\u2019s abrupt post, this matter wouldn\u2019t have blown up. However, the reporters now saw it as a battle between Chinese and Western medicine.</p><br/><p>Director Zhang didn\u2019t know what to say at all. The team of professionals didn\u2019t have anything at all. They couldn\u2019t do anything about the treatment. Only the professional team could do something about it.</p><br/><p>\u201cSpecialist Chang, the reporters are waiting outside. If it\u2019s possible, please go out and speak to them. If not, they would stay here and it would affect the operations of the hospital,\u201d Director Zhang said.</p><br/><p>Specialist Chang nodded and went there.</p><br/><p>He hadn\u2019t expected this matter to blow up so much and the reporters were watching it so closely.</p><br/><p>The reporters charged towards Specialist Chang when they saw him walk out of the building.</p><br/><p>\u201cSpecialist Chang, may I know your current progress? What do you think of Director Zhao Ming Qing\u2019s post on Weibo?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you think it\u2019s possible for Chinese medicine to overcome anorexia?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSpecialist Chang, please say something.\u201d</p><br/><p>Specialist Chang waved his hand. \u201cEveryone, I have to say that Wang Li Li\u2019s anorexia case is far more serious than any other one. Therefore, the treatment has to be unique. Our team of professionals is currently researching it. I can assure you that it won\u2019t take long for a conclusion. I do not wish to speak about the Chinese medical doctors but I feel that everyone has to be responsible for their words. I recognize that Chinese medicine is a national treasure but Western medicine is more scientific and is based on more evidence.\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporters listened closely to Specialist Chang\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>Shanghai\u2019s First Chinese Medical Academy.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan and Zhao Ming Qing were in the research lab and it was filled with the pungent smell of Chinese medication. They kept trying to combine different ingredients.</p><br/><p>There should\u2019ve been a person to test the medicine but Lin Fan could tell if the medicine was good enough just by looking at it.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing tried his best to take down notes in his notebook. He would make a conclusion every time he failed by writing down the reasons behind it.</p><br/><p>Then, a noise came from outside.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan raised his head and saw some students behaving sneakily outside. It looked like they were spying on them. \u201cMing Qing, go out and have a look.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing immediately agreed and went out.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you guys doing?\u201d Zhao Ming Qing opened the door and saw a bunch of students hiding there. He frowned and shouted.</p><br/><p>The students were shocked when they heard him. Then, they just stood there. \u201cDirector Zhao, we\u2026we\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>They didn\u2019t know what to say at all. They didn\u2019t even know if they should say that they were there to spy on them.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing didn\u2019t want to waste his time on these students. He waved his hand. \u201cLeave here now and do not come here again.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d The students nodded and ran after saying goodbye to Zhao Ming Qing.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat was scary.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, we actually got caught by the director. What do you think they\u2019re doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho is that young chap? Could he be a Chinese medical doctor too?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow could it be? I think he\u2019s a test subject.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt can\u2019t be. A person being the test subject? That\u2019s scary.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you take any pictures just now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI did. It\u2019ll definitely cause an uproar when I post these pictures.\u201d</p><br/><p>The students were satisfied. They had filmed what they wanted to find out. At the same time, they were curious. The room had been filled with smoke and when Director Zhao had opened the door, a strong aroma of Chinese medicine had almost choked them. It was horrifying.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, a group of students was spying on us,\u201d Zhao Ming Qing said.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded. \u201cAlright, it\u2019s okay. You have to be careful with this medicine. This medicine has a great impact and if you put too much of something, the patient will definitely not be able to take it. It\u2019d be better for you to replace it with something else.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing lowered his head and thought about it. His old and wrinkly face suddenly lit up and he gasped, \u201cTeacher, I thought of it!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe can use Gou Huang to replace it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded. Although Zhao Ming Qing was pretty old, he was smart. He had thought of it in a matter of seconds. This was also because he had a strong foundation.</p><br/><p>The others were looking at it as a battle between Chinese and Western medicine. However, to Lin Fan, he was just teaching Zhao Ming Qing.</p><br/><p>The faster he helped Zhao Ming Qing realize it, the faster he could leave him.</p><br/><p>However, he felt that it was not quite possible. Zhao Ming Qing couldn\u2019t learn everything with his current standard of medical skills. Still, Lin Fan could definitely help to improve his standard.</p><br/><p>Then, a video suddenly appeared online.</p><br/><p>The video only appeared on the school\u2019s web forum but people downloaded it and posted it elsewhere online. It attracted a lot of attention.</p><br/><p>\u2018The Director of Shanghai\u2019s First Chinese Medical Academy, Zhao Ming Qing, used a human as a test subject for the medicine. It\u2019s as if he has gone mad.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

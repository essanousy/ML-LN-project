He answered.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing said excitedly, \u201cTeacher, we\u2019ve bought the medicine. I\u2019m bringing them to you now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was startled. \u201cWhy are you coming in? Can\u2019t you just use the machine to send it in?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, you\u2019ve already conquered the influenza. It\u2019ll be fine if I come in. You\u2019ll need an assistant for brewing the medicine and what not, won\u2019t you?\u201d said Zhao Ming Qing. He trusted his teacher very much. Although they hadn\u2019t tested the treatment, he believed that, if his teacher said it had been conquered, then it had been conquered. He had absolutely no doubt.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan thought for a moment before replying, \u201cAlright, come in then.\u201d</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t just Zhao Ming Qing who believed in him, he also had extreme faith in himself. This influenza had indeed been conquered and it wouldn\u2019t be a problem at all.</p><br/><p>Outside!</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing carried the medicine as he entered Huang Yun Town.</p><br/><p>Li Chong was a little anxious and he wanted to stop Zhao Ming Qing. However, Zhao Ming Qing said that his teacher had already conquered the influenza and he was required inside. What else could Li Chong say? In the end, he could only hope Zhao Ming Qing was right.</p><br/><p>Initially, he had been exhilarated about Master Lin\u2019s arrival. Later on, he started becoming incomparably worried. Until now, he kept repeating in his heart \u2018This has to succeed.\u2019</p><br/><p>But before they saw the final outcome, no one apart from Master Lin and Zhao Ming Qing dared to say that the problem had been resolved.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you think it has really been resolved?\u201d asked one of the workers.</p><br/><p>Li Chong shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Let\u2019s wait and see. If it really succeeds, it would be great.\u201d</p><br/><p>No one wanted this problem to develop to a stage of no return. They all hoped that it could be resolved.</p><br/><p>But even if Master Lin said it personally, they wouldn\u2019t believe that it could really be cured until they saw the final outcome.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing entered Huang Yun town and felt that the stench of the town was horrible. When he saw the surrounding townspeople, he felt the terror of this influenza for the first time.</p><br/><p>Looking at the pale complexions on the townspeople and their feeble appearances as if they would fall down anytime, he knew that they had to resolve this as soon as possible.</p><br/><p>In the clinic.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing saw his teacher sitting there and he hurriedly rushed forward. \u201cTeacher, I\u2019ve brought all of it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMmm. Follow me to brew the medicine,\u201d said Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>The doctor who was lying down asked, \u201cMaster Lin, how is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. There will be no problems soon. Just rest here for a bit. I\u2019m going to brew the medicine.\u201d</p><br/><p>When the doctor heard that, he was taken aback. \u201cMaster Lin, has it already been resolved?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled, then nodded at this doctor without saying whether it had been resolved or not. He was afraid that the townspeople would become too excited and affect his medicine brewing. After all, no one would be willing to see other people cured before themselves.</p><br/><p>Moreover, there were way too many sufferers. Just relying on himself and Zhao Ming Qing, how could they brew so much medicine so quickly? Hence, they had to cure one person first and then the rest would be much easier.</p><br/><p>On the Internet.</p><br/><p>The netizens were all discussing this hot topic.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, it\u2019s unbelievable. This medicine is too expensive, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah! Do you know what they said to me when I was about to buy those medications that were posted on Weibo? They said that these medications were temporarily out of stock and they would only be restocked the next day. How scary is that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou think that\u2019s scary? It\u2019s even scarier here. The price increased by five times! Even if they want to snatch our money, they can\u2019t do it like that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you see that video that came out subsequently? The people infected in Huang Yun Town are many. I feel like there are definitely people who have escaped from there. If they bring the influenza out, we\u2019re screwed.\u201d</p><br/><p>The discussions on the Internet were intense. To some pharmacists, it was great.</p><br/><p>In the pharmacies group chat.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, we\u2019re going to be rich! Honeysuckle has inflated five times and so has blue mountain root. I think the price will be even higher tomorrow.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt will definitely be higher. Right now, everyone\u2019s hearts are jittery. Before this sickness is cured, our medicine will keep inflating.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe blue mountain root manufacturer is going to stop production.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happened? Why is it stopping?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause of the inflation of Chinese medicine prices, they are losing $95 for every box of blue mountain root. Those legal manufacturers are under the control of the government. Of course, the government wouldn\u2019t let them inflate the price.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are countless people coming to my pharmacy to buy medicine every day now but I\u2019m telling my staff to tell them that we\u2019ve run out of medicine. I\u2019m going to take out my stock in a few days and sell them for a high price.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. We have to make them feel as if the medicine is very scarce. That will make them feel as if the medicine would run out if they hesitate any further.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. I\u2019ve already started piling a large amount of stock. Before this incident was even exposed, I already bought a large pile of medicine from the Chinese herbal medicine suppliers and it was for the uninflated price.</p><br/><p>\u201cI bought mine from a Chinese medicine company in Shanghai. I heard that that company hasn\u2019t inflated its prices yet. I don\u2019t even know what they\u2019re thinking.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaybe they want to do good.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha. As long as this influenza hasn\u2019t been conquered, the price will not fall. I\u2019m guessing that this influenza will still go strong for another one or two months.\u201d</p><br/><p>Huang Yun Town.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan and Zhao Ming Qing had brewed over ten servings of the medicine. Zhao Ming Qing was very serious about this. He was very afraid that problems might crop up.</p><br/><p>\u201cMing Qing, help the doctor over. Let him take the medicine and let\u2019s see how it goes,\u201d said Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing nodded, then hurried to help the sick doctor over.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, have you conquered it?\u201d Now that there was no one around, he was eager to ask.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cI know that I\u2019ve conquered it but we still have to see the effects after you take the medicine. Come, have a try.\u201d</p><br/><p>That doctor had no hesitation. He had immense faith in Master Lin. Then, he slowly started to take the medicine. The medicine was still hot. He was very excited. He was just hoping medicine would be useful and that it would completely cure the influenza.</p><br/><p>At that moment, his panic completely vanished.</p><br/><p>The medicine definitely wouldn\u2019t be effective immediately. It needed time to take effect in the body.</p><br/><p>\u201cMing Qing, go and find the more severe patients and let them come in to try it,\u201d said Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>\u201cGot it, Teacher.\u201d Zhao Ming Qing went out again. But this time, he had drunk some medicine as well. Although the symptoms hadn\u2019t shown yet, he was already infected.</p><br/><p>Very soon, over ten patients with severe cases came in. They didn\u2019t know what was going on at first but under the guarantee of the doctor, they found out that they would recover after taking the medicine. Hence, they started taking it without hesitation.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing said, \u201cTeacher, how long must we wait?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cI already know now that this medicine is useful. But the effect will only be made known tomorrow morning.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Zhao Ming Qing nodded. It seemed that he would have to wait until the next day.</p></div>\n</div>"}

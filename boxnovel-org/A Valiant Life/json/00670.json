I didn\u2019t really buy anything for all of you this time. I\u2019m a little embarrassed,\u201d said Lin Fan as he entered the house.</p><br/><p>Xiu Fang was busy in the kitchen, \u201cWhat\u2019s the point of the formality? Your presence as a guest here is good enough.\u201d Then, she shouted, \u201cLil\u2019 Bao, your Uncle Lin is here. Quickly come down and see him. Weren\u2019t you crying for him?\u201d</p><br/><p>The kid ran down excitedly from the stairs, \u201cUncle Lin\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Although he was still young, his grandparents and parents told him that he was able to run so quickly because of Uncle Lin. Therefore, Lil\u2019 Bao had always seen Lin Fan as his hero.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan gently touched his head, \u201cLil\u2019 Bao, you\u2019ve grown taller.\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Zheng said, \u201cElder Lin, let\u2019s go and drink some tea. When my wife is done with the food, we can drink some beer.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lil\u2019 Bao stuck to Lin Fan wherever he went. He felt that he had this power that could attract kids since every child loved to be with him so much.</p><br/><p>In the study room.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at one of the artworks on display. It was the one that was given to Elder Zheng by him. It had been mounted on the wall.</p><br/><p>Elder Zheng said, \u201cElder Lin, what are you thinking of drawing? How could you not have the materials to draw it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved his hand, \u201cIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t have it. It\u2019s just that I don\u2019t have a space that is big enough for me to draw. This time, it is going to be the biggest artwork that I\u2019ve ever drawn. It is about 5 meters long\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>*Clatter!*</p><br/><p>Elder Zheng spat out his tea, \u201cElder Lin, what did you say? Five meters long? What are you going to draw? Till this date, the biggest artwork was only 3 meters long and it was a legendary piece that lasted for many decades and generations. Isn\u2019t yours a bit too big?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cToo big? This is an International Arts Exhibition. We can\u2019t just do average things. Now, do you understand why I decided to come to Beijing? I really can\u2019t find a place that is suitable to draw such a big artwork. Therefore, I decided to come to Beijing to do it. Furthermore, we can keep it after the exhibition. If it is ruined, my efforts would be wasted.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zheng Zhong Shan took a deep breath to calm himself down. He didn\u2019t expect Elder Lin to do such a thing. It was shocking.</p><br/><p>He was almost shocked to death.</p><br/><p>Then, Lin Fan took a piece of paper and a pen to write down what he was going to need to draw the artwork.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Zheng, look. All of my requests are here. Just prepare them and I can start anytime. However, you have to hurry. These artworks will take up a lot of time. It is really very different from other artworks.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zheng Zhong Shan felt that he wasn\u2019t going to be shocked any further. However, when he saw Elder Lin\u2019s requests, he swallowed his saliva forcefully. All ten artworks were going to be grand and big. They weren\u2019t the usual type of artwork. Then, Elder Zheng nodded, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I will get someone to prepare them tomorrow. Perhaps I\u2019m lucky enough to see a groundbreaking artwork in my lifetime. I\u2019m ecstatic even at the thought of it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The two of them chatted in the study room for some time.</p><br/><p>Xiu Fang said, \u201cCome on down, masters. The food has been prepared.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zheng Zhong Shan and Lin Fan discussed about many things in the study room. Even though they mainly discussed about artworks, they also discussed about some daily family activities. A youngster discussing with an elderly man about that would be a rather shocking sight to others.</p><br/><p>The others somehow knew about Lin Fan\u2019s arrival in Beijing and they immediately came over in the middle of the night.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was a little helpless. He was a youngster after all. He felt that he would become \u2018old\u2019 after interacting with so many elderly men.</p><br/><p>Two days later.</p><br/><p>At the Chinese Arts Association</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen did Master Lin come to Beijing? Why didn\u2019t you tell us?\u201d</p><br/><p>Most of the core members of the association knew Lin Fan and they greeted him warmly. The bulk of the pressure was on Lin Fan for the upcoming International Arts Exhibition.</p><br/><p>The others wanted to share the workload with him but they knew that they couldn\u2019t match up to Master Lin\u2019s standards at all.</p><br/><p>Some of the other members of the association looked at the youngster that was being surrounded by a group of elderly men and they were curious.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho is this youngster? Why is he so welcomed here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, why would I know him? I\u2019m already so old, how would I know a youngster like him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t even know Master Lin. Recently, something happened to the association. You should know that, right? The incident about the Youth Chinese Arts Cup.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know about that. Could the youngster be Master Lin?\u201d He looked at the youngster in disbelief. He didn\u2019t expect the youngster to be Master Lin. If he didn\u2019t see him with his own eyes, he probably wouldn\u2019t have believed it.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, I heard Master Lin is going to draw really grand artworks for the upcoming International Arts Exhibition. I wonder what it\u2019s going to be like. Everyone is looking forward to it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded at the people to acknowledge them. Although he didn\u2019t remember some of their names, they were really friendly to him and he had to greet them with positivity too.</p><br/><p>The core members of the Chinese Arts Association stood by Lin Fan while some of the ordinary members wanted to see what was going on. However, there were too many people and they couldn\u2019t squeeze through the crowd. They could only stand outside to watch.</p><br/><p>The crowd came to a spacious room meant for drawing.</p><br/><p>The room was packed cleanly and there was a long table placed in it. There were a lot of brushes placed on the table.</p><br/><p>Zheng Zhong Shan introduced, \u201cElder Lin, what do you think? Is there anything that you\u2019re not satisfied with? I got people to prepare this setting after looking at your requests. Our association has the five-meter long sheet of picture scroll.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan walked around and nodded, \u201cIt\u2019s really good.\u201d</p><br/><p>The other masters that looked at the long table were stunned.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy would he need such a long table?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, I was already thinking about that when I was arranging this. I still can\u2019t figure it out.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs he really going to draw such a long artwork?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Yue Qiu Ju Shi said, \u201cElder Lin, why did you ask for such a long table?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled mysteriously, \u201cYou guys would find out in the future. It is still a secret.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Lin, stop hiding it from us.\u201d Yue Qiu Ju Shi felt a little helpless. However, he looked at Elder Zheng\u2019s confident face and he knew that Elder Zheng knew something about it. Then, he wanted to ask Elder Zheng about it.</p><br/><p>He really wanted to know what was the final outcome going to be like.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Also, the amount of confidence that everyone had in Master Lin was pretty decent. To them, believing in Master Lin was their only choice.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-1\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Furthermore, when analyzing the past, it seemed that Master Lin had never disappointed anyone before.</p><br/><p>Right now, he had 10 pills that could cure Leukemia. With this amount of pills, he could already accomplish his mission.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, my reporter brothers, I have an announcement to make and I\u2019m hoping that you guys can help me spread the message. Right now, I only have 10 pills. Thus, for the moment, I will be giving the pills to the Leukemia patients who are in more critical conditions. I request that the major hospitals all help me out in choosing these patients. As for the prescription, I will quickly try to develop it. Those Leukemia patients whose condition aren\u2019t as serious can wait for a while,\u201d Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>When these words came out of his mouth, it temporarily caused a huge stir.</p><br/><p>There were a lot of Leukemia patients at the scene and their greatest wish was to quickly regain their health. However, after hearing what Master Lin had said, they momentarily felt helpless.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, can you just give us the pill first?\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-2\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cYes, we are really already in critical conditions.\u201d</p><br/><p>Some of the family members of the sick cried out. At this moment, all they were thinking about was to take the few existing pills for themselves as no one knew whether making a prescription would be possible or not.</p><br/><p>They all did not know what they would do if it Master Lin failed to develop the prescription.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan immediately waved them off and said, \u201cOkay, I\u2019ve already said my share. Everyone can leave already.\u201d</p><br/><p>None of the people at the scene left. None of them were willing to leave. They really wanted to get their health back.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan felt a little helpless as he said, \u201cIf you guys stay here and delay me, then you all are delaying your health as well. If you guys quickly leave, I can quickly develop a prescription. Even if all of you guys gather and stay here till tomorrow, it will be completely useless.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan really understood the mindset of these family members. However, in this situation where the pills were scarce, he could not just use the pills as he wished and he had to give them to the patients in more critical conditions.</p><br/><p>The minds of these critically ill patients had already been filled with despair. If they were to use the pill he had concocted and regain their health, they would definitely change.</p><br/><p>The reporters started taking pictures as they said, \u201cMaster Lin, don\u2019t worry. We will be sure to spread this news around.\u201d</p><br/><p>However, even after what Lin Fan had said, a few families still did not leave and were insistent on staying there and waiting.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-3\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Everyone was just looking at each other. It was like they were waiting for the other people to make the first move. They felt that if they were to leave first, they could possibly lose out in the end.</p><br/><p>A few of the surrounding townsfolk said, \u201cI think you guys should just quickly leave and give Master Lin some time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, there is no use for you guys to just gather around here. You are just wasting Master Lin\u2019s time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin\u2019s medical skills are so amazing, he will definitely have a solution.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, all of you guys should just quickly leave and let Master Lin carefully think about this whole situation. There is no use to gathering around here. You guys are just troubling Master Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>Finally, after the words from the townsfolk, the families started leaving.</p><br/><p>They finally understood the whole situation. They were afraid that even if they were to keep staying here and wait, there would not be any use at all.</p><br/><p>Slowly, some of the families decided to leave.</p><br/><p>After which, even more of them started to leave.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan let out a sigh. It was really scary for him as he realized that since his abilities had reached such a high level, he could not just live his life as freely and easily as he wanted.</p><br/><p>He had not been careful and he had exposed such a huge secret, making him feel pretty helpless now.</p><br/><p>However, the feeling was pretty good. Perhaps he had already become a savior in all their eyes. But of course, he was only just treating Leukemia.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-4\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>The reporters were still on the scene. However, Master Lin, having jumped on top of the roof, made it very difficult for them.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, you should quickly come down.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, we will just ask a few questions and then leave.\u201d</p><br/><p>In the face of this request from the reporters, Lin Fan did not have any objections at all. He then jumped off the roof.</p><br/><p>One reporter quickly stepped up and said, \u201cMaster Lin, what do you have to say about this situation? Right now, a large majority of the family members of the sick are counting on you. Do you feel like the pressure is very high?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shrugged his shoulders and replied, \u201cIt\u2019s alright. With regards to the pressure, it isn\u2019t really very high. I\u2019ll try my best. Furthermore, I have a lot of confidence in myself. If I was able to concoct the pills that could cure Leukemia, then would I not be able to develop a prescription?\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporters were already very used to Master Lin\u2019s character of very high self-confidence.</p><br/><p>If it had been an ordinary person, they would definitely feel like that person was being too proud.</p><br/><p>However, they had a huge amount of confidence in Master Lin. This was due to the fact that, if they were to lay out Master Lin\u2019s history and everything he had done, it would surprise a lot of people. His stories were really too stunning.</p><br/><p>Another reporter asked, \u201cMaster Lin, besides curing Leukemia, have you cured any other diseases?\u201d</p><br/><p>When this question came out, everyone eagerly waited for the answer. To them, if any other diseases were dealt with by Master Lin, it would be really amazing.</p><br/><p>Also, Master Lin would definitely become the noblest person in existence. In the entire history of medicine, no one would be able to surpass him.</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan heard this question, his little heart began to throb.</p><br/><p><em>Are they trying to toy with me?</em></p><div class=\"code-block code-block-5\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>If he were to say that he could cure these other diseases, he would definitely not be able to enjoy the rest of his days.</p><br/><p>However, the reporter had already asked the question. If such an awesome being like him were to say that he could not cure them, he would definitely lose face.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, even if he were to admit to it, what could they do? What could he possibly be scared of?</p><br/><p>*Cough cough*</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is a very serious question. At the moment, I have not cured any other diseases. However, with my abilities, if I to do a little research, it should not be too much of a problem. Of course, this is just me being confident in myself. You guys don\u2019t have to take it as the truth,\u201d Lin Fan calmly said.</p><br/><p>The reporter replied, \u201cMaster Lin, I believe you. I am a huge fan of yours and I completely believe everything that you say. I want to ask, have you thought about completely eradicating all these complicated diseases?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled and did not answer. His smile was a profound and meaningful one which answered his question.</p><br/><p>In the end, after Lin Fan\u2019s efforts, the reporters left as well.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing came over to his side and said, \u201cTeacher, do you really have such a high level of certainty?\u201d</p><br/><p>Right now, he was very worried. If they really could not develop the prescription, he was afraid that something would happen to them. However, he had huge confidence in his teacher\u2019s medical abilities.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course I\u2019m certain. If I wasn\u2019t certain, why would I have said all of that? However, we will need to work a bit harder. This period of time is going to be quite tough for us,\u201d Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>If he did not make the situation sound more complicated, others wouldn\u2019t feel like it was difficult.</p><br/><p>If he made it seem so simple, it would not be as shocking to others.</p><br/><p>However, Lin Fan had a little interest in one of the questions the reporters had asked just now.</p><br/><p>To be able to eradicate all the complicated diseases in the world. Perhaps that was a little scary.</p><br/><p>For example, in a few hundred years, a medical teaching material might introduce him saying: \u2018In the year 2017, the greatest master in medical history, Master Lin Fan, cured lung cancer, liver cancer, leukemia, brain cancer\u2026etc. Let us take a look into Master Lin\u2019s life.\u2019</p><br/><p>These small thoughts made him a little excited.</p></div>\n</div>"}

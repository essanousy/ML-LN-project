It was considered the best hotel in Haojiang.</p><br/><p>Gazing at the night sky outside, Lin Fan lay on the bed leisurely.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, at the Yun home.</p><br/><p>Yun Tai Nian, Yun Xue Yao, Ye Zhen Ming, Ou Xing Yun and the rest were looking at the video display. Their brows were all furrowed.</p><br/><p>\u201cPause. Enlarge it,\u201d said Yun Tai Nian.</p><br/><p>What they were watching at that moment was the video of Yun Xue Yao and Zhang Yuan\u2019s gamble during the day.</p><br/><p>\u201cGrandfather, I didn\u2019t see wrongly. My card was a 9 of hearts. I remember it clearly,\u201d said Yun Xue Yao. Up until now, she still did not understand how Lin Fan had changed the 9 of hearts to an A.</p><br/><p>Ye Zhen Ming was watching unblinkingly. \u201cThis is too mysterious. If he only changed the card, it would still be fine but how did he manage to place the card back into the box? This is inconceivable.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCarry on. Play it at the slowest speed.\u201d Yun Tai Nian wanted to carry on watching the video, but with the speed set to the lowest.</p><br/><p>Their Yun family had raised their empire through gambling. However, they did not rely on their gambling skills to do so. They did it using their brains.</p><br/><p>There were many gambling experts and no matter how great they were, they wouldn\u2019t get noticed much. However, Yun Tai Nian and the rest wanted to get to the bottom of what had happened that day. How had that card changed so suddenly?</p><br/><p>The video was played very slowly. At this moment, a hand had already been extended and it grabbed onto Yun Xue Yao\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>When Yun Xue Yao saw this, her face turned a little red. However, she still stared at the screen.</p><br/><p>Then, Ou Xing Yun gasped in shock, \u201cIt changed. The card changed. How is that possible?\u201d</p><br/><p>At the moment that the card was revealed. The 9 of hearts had already turned into an A of spades. However, they still couldn\u2019t see how this had been done.</p><br/><p>They had already played the video at the slowest speed. No matter how fast Lin Fan\u2019s hand had been, it couldn\u2019t have escaped the camera.</p><br/><p>After that, the video showed Zhang Yuan searching for the non-existent A of spades in the poker box but when he saw the 9 of hearts inside, everyone looked at each other in shock. There were no loopholes at all and not a single trace of cheating.</p><br/><p>If one hadn\u2019t known what the card had been at first, one would have thought that it really was an A of spades.</p><br/><p>Ye Zhen Han sighed, \u201cThis is perfection. With this technique, if he joined the World Gambling Tournament, the title of \u2018God of Gambling\u2019 would belong to no one else.\u201d</p><br/><p>Every gambling expert\u2019s greatest dream was to receive this official title. However, they could only think about it. To achieve it, the difficulty was unspeakable. It was really too difficult.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s truly amazing,\u201d Yun Xue Yao gasped in shock as her lips opened slightly.</p><br/><p>On the other hand, Yun Tai Nian was very calm. \u201cAlright, Xue Yao. Accompany Master Lin around tomorrow.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI got it, grandfather,\u201d said Yun Xue Yao with a nod. Although their Yun family had great influence, they would always treat such amazing individuals as equals. Especially in such a competitive place as Haojiang, if they were too arrogant, it wouldn\u2019t be good.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The next day!</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was still in his sleep when he heard the sound of the door being knocked.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho is it?\u201d asked Lin Fan sloppily.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s me, Master Lin. Yun Xue Yao.\u201d A sweet voice emanated from outside.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, so it\u2019s Lady Yun. Please wait a moment while I tidy up a little.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan didn\u2019t mind interacting a little more with that beautiful lady outside. Of course, it was just social interaction.</p><br/><p>Not long after, Lin Fan opened the door. When he saw the beautiful lady in front of him, his eyes gleamed. Her style had changed very much from the previous day. She was dressed very casually. Her wavy, long hair was tied up behind. She gave off a \u2018girl next door\u2019 feeling.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, you haven\u2019t eaten breakfast yet, right? I\u2019ll bring you to a breakfast place that\u2019s very well-known in Haojiang. After that, we\u2019ll go to the scenic areas to have a look. Our Haojiang is known for its eight sceneries. For people who come to Haojiang, if they don\u2019t go to these few places to have a look, it would be a wasted trip,\u201d said Yun Xue Yao with a face full of smiles.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled and replied, \u201cAlright, then I\u2019ll have to trouble Lady Yun with this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>It was a very small shop. It seemed to have existed for a very long time already.</p><br/><p>Yun Xue Yao saw Lin Fan sizing up the shop, thinking that it was old and shabby, so she quickly explained, \u201cDon\u2019t judge this shop by its size. It has already been open for almost sixty years. It is very well-known in Haojiang.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin fan smiled, \u201cI wasn\u2019t. I\u2019m just looking at it curiously.\u201d</p><br/><p>While waiting for the specialty snacks, Yun Xue Yao looked curiously at Lin Fan. \u201cMaster Lin, I\u2019m very curious. Yesterday, I went back and did a search for you on the Internet. On the Internet, they say that you are very amazing. Is it true?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m just alright. I just know a little of everything. But Lady Yun really surprised me. You\u2019re so young and you already manage a casino,\u201d said Lin Fan with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cLady Yun sounds too formal. You can call me Xue Yao. If it wasn\u2019t for your help, I would have lost myself to the opposition,\u201d said Yun Xue Yao. It was hard to tell if she was mocking herself or just rejoicing.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan didn\u2019t say much. For this Yun Xue Yao to be able to manage a casino at such a young age, she wasn\u2019t a simple person. It is scarcely known that the more harmless a person looks, the more dangerous a person is likely to be.</p><br/><p>If Lin Fan was to treat this Yun Xue Yao as one of those foolish and sweet young ladies, he would have to be a dumba*s.</p><br/><p>Very soon, two servings of specialty snacks were served.</p><br/><p>Tianfa imitation shark fin soup.</p><br/><p>The shop had actually not opened yet but since Yun Xue Yao was the Yun family\u2019s princess, they had to open their business for her even if they had not opened yet.</p><br/><p>\u201cMmm, it tastes pretty good.\u201d Lin Fan took a spoonful and it was indeed delicious.</p><br/><p>Yun Xue Yao smiled delightedly as if her favorite thing had gotten praised by someone. \u201cSince I was very young, I would always eat here. Although it\u2019s a little expensive, it tastes very good.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan thought, \u201cWith the Yun family\u2019s wealth, even if it was more expensive, it would probably still be cheap to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCalling you Master Lin feels awkward. Can I call you Brother Lin?\u201d asked Yun Xue Yao.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded, \u201cSure. That\u2019s not a problem. Sometimes, when people call me Master Lin, I feel old.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo way. Brother Lin is very young and very dashing as well. Moreover, you\u2019re more amazing than anyone that I\u2019ve seen,\u201d complimented Yun Xue Yao.</p><br/><p>Soon, the two of them left the shop.</p><br/><p>He was unfamiliar with Haojiang but luckily, he had Yun Xue Yao to guide him. The first stop was A-Ma Temple.</p><br/><p>It was very well-known in Haojiang and had a history of over five-hundred years.</p><br/><p>However, on the way there, they were met with a very unpleasant situation.</p><br/><p>At the road junction, two cars nearly collided with each other and the two sides immediately started cursing at each other.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan realized that Yun Xue Yao looked a little infuriated but her expression quickly changed back. However, he saw Yun Xue Yao take out her phone and send a message.</p><br/><p>He inadvertently took a look and realized that this Lady Yun had dominance akin to that of a mafia boss.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeach them a good lesson.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, Yun Xue Yao kept her phone and flashed her dazzling smile. \u201cBrother Lin, this kind of situation is common in Haojiang. But there won\u2019t be any problems. The law and order here are good.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan didn\u2019t expose her and didn\u2019t say much. He just smiled and nodded. This was her business and he didn\u2019t need to care too much.</p><br/><p>However, that man before had a pretty dirty mouth and he did deserve a good lesson.</p></div>\n</div>"}

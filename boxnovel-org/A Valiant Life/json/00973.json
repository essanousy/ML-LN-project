He immediately turned it off as he exclaimed, \u201cIt can\u2019t be. Elder Wang is such an astute man. How could he be tricked into joining something like that?\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-1\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cAstute people are the easiest to trick. I am 90% sure that this is multi-level marketing. When he comes back, we have to question him,\u201d said Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Sister Hong had brought her kids to buy some snacks. As she walked past, she decided to come in. \u201cLittle Boss, Elder Chen, what are you two talking about?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shifted his position to allow Sister Hong to stand next to him. \u201cSister Hong, Elder Wang has been acting abnormally lately. My friend saw him at some kind of conference. It seems like he\u2019s been tricked into multi-level marketing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sister Hong was startled. \u201cThat can\u2019t be. Elder Wang hasn\u2019t told us anything about this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Of course, she didn\u2019t believe it. Elder Wang was such an astute man and he was usually very careful about the things he did. Now that they were telling her that he had been tricked into multi-level marketing, she wouldn\u2019t believe it even if she was beaten to death.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, stop talking about this. Elder Wang is back.\u201d Elder Chen looked into the distance at Elder Wang, who was carrying a red bag and a smile as he chatted cheerily with the people around. \u201cShould we call him over to ask him about it? We won\u2019t say that it\u2019s multi-level marketing, we\u2019ll just ask him what he\u2019s been up to lately.\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-2\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cThat is a must,\u201d said Sister Hong.</p><br/><p>They were all a part of Cloud Street. Everyone was very united. Whenever someone came across trouble, the rest naturally couldn\u2019t sit idly by. Moreover, they didn\u2019t know if Elder Wang had actually been tricked into joining multi-level marketing and how much money he had been scammed of.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan hollered, \u201cElder Wang, come over for a moment.\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Wang saw Little Boss and the rest at Elder Chen\u2019s shop and started smiling as he came over. \u201cLittle Boss, what are you guys doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>Sister Hong and Elder Chen just watched without saying anything. They decided to leave the talking to Little Boss.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cElder Wang, I see that you\u2019ve been very busy lately. What have you been doing? Is it something important?\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Wang smiled embarrassedly. \u201cNo, I\u2019ve just been learning some new knowledge to enrich myself. I\u2019ve just finished my lesson, so I\u2019m back.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan glanced at the red bag. It seemed to be containing something and it was all full. \u201cWhat are you learning? Tell us more.\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-3\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Elder Wang said, \u201cAlright, I shall tell you then. I came across something good so I definitely have to share it with everyone.\u201d Then, he opened the bag and took out a book, which he then placed on the counter. \u201cLook at this book.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cover page: \u2018Mysterious elements are all around us\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat kind of book is this?\u201d Lin Fan was stunned. It really seemed very unsafe.</p><br/><p>Elder Wang explained with a smile, \u201cThis is basic teaching material. It means that around us, in the air, there is a kind of mysterious element that exists. When we can sense these elements, our spirits will enter an immense relaxation. We could even mediate the magnetic fields in our bodies. There are many things. I\u2019ve only just listened to several classes and I haven\u2019t learned as much as those fellow disciples of mine.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sister Hong and Elder Chen looked at each other. At this moment, they understood that Elder Wang had been scammed.</p><br/><p>And judging by the looks of things, he deeply believed those lies.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cAh, it\u2019s so mystical. How much did you spend?\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Wang waved his hand. \u201cNot much. The fee is only 1880. With this book, I spent a total of around three or four thousand. This isn\u2019t much. Some of those who have attended the further classes have spent tens of thousands on buying items. I wanted to buy as well but because I haven\u2019t learned enough, they weren\u2019t willing to sell the items to me either.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan\u2019s mouth twitched a little. <em>That\u2019s f*cking harsh.</em></p><br/><p>Elder Wang seemed to sense Sister Hong and Elder Chen\u2019s distrust, so he said, \u201cDon\u2019t think that this is a scam. Let me tell you that this is not a scam. They are very responsible. Before you reach a certain level, they wouldn\u2019t sell you items. If they are scammers, they would definitely sell things to you, wouldn\u2019t they?\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-4\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Lin Fan wanted to say a certain sentence but didn\u2019t say it in the end.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s not that they don\u2019t want to f*cking sell it, they\u2019re just afraid that they haven\u2019t brainwashed you enough and that you\u2019ll escape!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen is the next class?\u201d asked Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Elder Wang replied, \u201cThere\u2019s another class in the afternoon. This class is very important. There will be a professional teacher coming to teach us. I have to go and do some revision. I\u2019m going to ask the questions I don\u2019t understand in the afternoon.\u201d</p><br/><p>Before Lin Fan said anything, Elder Wang kept the book and left immediately.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan tilted his head and said softly, \u201cDid you hear that? Elder Wang seems to have fallen deep into the trap.\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Chen asked, \u201cLittle Boss, what should we do?\u201d</p><br/><p>Sister Hong sighed, \u201cSigh, Elder Wang is usually a really astute man. How did he become so stupid?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cDon\u2019t tell other people about this for now. I\u2019ll go and take a look in the afternoon. We have to help Elder Wang avoid this plight, isn\u2019t that right? If we can\u2019t save him, then he\u2019ll be screwed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Chen and Sister Hong nodded immediately. That was indeed the case. They hadn\u2019t expected Elder Wang to have fallen deeply into a scam. It was simply scary. If they hadn\u2019t discovered this early and Elder Wang had really been scammed of a lot of his money, that would have been tragic.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>In the afternoon!</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-5\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Dongyue Hotel.</p><br/><p>Elder Wang reached the venue very early and most of the other participants had reached very early as well. They felt that if they missed out on even a bit of content, it would be a great loss.</p><br/><p>Liu Xu watched from afar and felt that these people were really maniacs. She roughly estimated that there over a hundred people.</p><br/><p>Spiritual Exchange Conference.</p><br/><p>The person-in-charge was a middle-aged lady who was dressed brightly and had short hair. With one look, you could tell that she was capable of big things.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs the lecturer here yet?\u201d</p><br/><p>The assistant said, \u201cHe\u2019s coming. He\u2019s on the way.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMmm, that\u2019s good. Prepare the materials. After the lecture is over, get the students to buy them,\u201d said the middle-aged lady.</p><br/><p>The class fees were just a small sum. The real profits came from these materials and other supplementary goods.</p><br/><p>When the members were really immersed, something worth ten dollars could be sold for several thousand or maybe even ten thousand.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-6\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s ready.\u201d The assistant nodded. In this line of work, in order to brainwash others, one had to first brainwash himself or herself. Otherwise, how would one convince others?</p><br/><p>Hence, they were now feeling the energy from around them as well.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, they could never feel any energy but this didn\u2019t make them give up. They just believed that they were not competent enough to feel it.</p><br/><p>In the very large conference room.</p><br/><p>A group of students were seated.</p><br/><p>And amongst them, Lin Fan was seated as well. He had utilized his Wuxia class of knowledge to make others not notice him. There was indeed a way to do this.</p><br/><p>He wanted to see what exactly they would talk about is such a \u2018powerful\u2019 lesson.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, all the members stood up and shouted towards the entrance, \u201cTeacher Zhou\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Teacher Zhou nodded and gestured for everyone to be silent.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease sit.\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-7\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>On the platform in front, that lady who had been greeted as Teacher Zhou stood in front of a drawing board. Then, she pointed at the content on the board.</p><br/><p>\u201cToday, we will be learning how to absorb the mysterious elements around us more effectively.\u201d</p><br/><p>The crowd nodded. They were very eagerly anticipating it.</p></div>\n</div>"}

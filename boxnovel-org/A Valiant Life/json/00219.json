But before he could continue, he was interrupted by Sun Lian Ming. \"I don't believe in fortune-telling. I won't acknowledge the words you've said. I am truthful and sincere to all my friends and I can say that without feeling guilty. I have never done anything wrong to my friends. You're speaking as if I'm an immoral man.\"</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang chided, \"My brother has said it very clearly, right from the start. The truth hurts and you were the one who forced him to say it. Therefore, you shouldn't be unhappy since you were the one who asked for it.\"</p><br/><p>Sun Lian Ming snorted, \"Chief Wang, it may seem like the truth to you but to me, it's all a fraud. Today, I will show some face to Brother Wu and not be calculative about this.\"</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang sneered, \"Calculative? So what if you're calculative? What can you do to my friend? I, Wang Ming Yang, am more than willing to keep you 'company'.\"</p><br/><p>They started to argue again.</p><br/><p>\"Stop arguing. Both of you, please stop talking. Master Lin, please don't be angry,\" Wu Yun Gang quickly said to Lin Fan. This matter was a difficult one. He hadn't expected Wang Ming Yang and Sun Lian Ming start quarreling. Furthermore, it looked like they could start a fight anytime even though it was just a small disagreement.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled and waved his hands. \"I'm not angry at all. I only spoke the truth. But I have to add on.\"</p><br/><p>Wu Yun Gang was helpless. My dear Master Lin, please stop talking.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at Sun Lian Ming. \"Please be careful. Your physiognomy doesn't seem too good. You will have a difficult trial ahead of you. It all depends on you on how you want to resolve it.\"</p><br/><p>Sun Lian Ming sneered and walked towards the entrance, \"What a load of rubbish\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Wu Yun Gang chased after him. \"Brother Sun, Brother Sun, what are you doing?\"</p><br/><p>At the entrance, Sun Lian Ming shrugged his shoulders. \"I can't stay here any longer. I will be heading back to Beijing first. Also, let me remind you that this type of fortune-telling is all a gimmick. Don't be cheated by it.\"</p><br/><p>Wu Yun Gang wanted to mediate the situation but Sun Lian Ming just left immediately. He didn't even want to stay any longer.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at Sun Lian Ming and laughed. The truth had really infuriated him. But what could he have done about it? It was indeed the truth. He did nothing wrong at all.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang chuckled, \"You can't show this kind of person any face. He's such a despicable man.\"</p><br/><p>Wu Yun Gang returned to the shop and sighed, \"Master Lin, I'm sorry. My friend is just like that.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved his hands. \"I already said what I wanted to say. If you heed my advice, please be more cautious next time. In terms of your profits, do not be involved with him. Whether you want to continue being friends with him, that's not up to me.\"</p><br/><p>Wu Yun Gang nodded. Although he believed in Master Lin, he couldn't just unfriend Sun Lian Ming because of his words. But he also kept Master Lin's words in mind. In future, he would be more cautious with his wealth.</p><br/><p>What worried Wu Yun Gang was that Master Lin had said Sun Lian Ming was going to face a trial. He wondered if it was really true.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan noticed Wu Yun Gang's suspicious expressions. He said, \"What I said was true. I didn't lie to him.\"</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang chuckled, \"He deserves it for having such a sh*tty personality. Brother Wu, I think you should just forget about it. Even if you want to help him out, he might not acknowledge your efforts. He might even think you're being nosy.\"</p><br/><p>Wu Yun Gang nodded. What Wang Ming Yang said was true. For someone like Sun Lian Ming, if he didn't believe in something that you said, he would definitely ignore it, especially since it created such a conflict. If you were to continue talking about it, it would just anger him.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian was dumbfounded. He had witnessed everything from the start till the end. He was shocked. Was Master Lin really speaking the truth? It couldn't be that accurate.</p><br/><p>Wu Tian He was extremely impressed by Master Lin's standard of fortune-telling. He was able to completely analyze someone just based on his/her appearance. Ever since he had come to Shanghai from Lianzhou, he had been observing the situation of his daughter. Her fate had really been changed. Although it wasn't very obvious, things looked much better for her.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang chuckled, \"Alright, Brother Wu, let's not talk about such unhappy things. Let me tell you, Master Lin is not just good at fortune-telling, he is also extremely good at cooking. Do you remember that time we had an international chef cook for us?\"</p><br/><p>Wu Yun Gang ignored what had happened and laughed after hearing what Wang Ming Yang said, \"What is it? Do you want to eat it again? It's a little difficult now. The chef isn't in the pink of health and he doesn't cook as often now.\"</p><br/><p>\"Haha,\" Wang Ming Yang laughed. \"I'm telling you that Master Lin cooks even better than that chef! You wouldn't know it until you eat it. You'll be addicted after just one bite. It's like comparing heaven and earth.\"</p><br/><p>Then, Wang Ming Yang looked at Lin Fan. \"What do you think of cooking a feast for Wu Yun Gang? Since he's come such a long way.\"</p><br/><p>When he mentioned food, everyone in the shop raised their heads. Their eyes lit up and they looked like they were yearning for it.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed and shook his head. \"You're such a scheming man. You must be craving for it.\"</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang chuckled, \"I'm not craving for it. It's because I've tasted your food before. If I was a girl, I would stick to you 24/7 even if I have to drug you.\"</p><br/><p>\"An old man like you saying such things, shouldn't you feel disgusted?\" Lin Fan chuckled. This motherf*cker is teasing me.</p><br/><p>\"Haha,\" Wang Ming Yang laughed hysterically. \"What's so disgusting about that? As long as you agree, I will fly to Thailand tomorrow to undergo an operation to change my gender.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chided, \"Get lost!\"</p><br/><p>Then, Fraud Tian added, \"Brother Wang, if you're going, please bring me along. I feel like I'm capable of it too.\"</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang held his phone and pointed it at everyone. \"Guys, look. Master Lin is going to be in a dilemma.\"</p><br/><p>The netizens laughed as they watched the broadcast. They felt that the 'Master Lin' shop was such a fun place to be in. Initially, the atmosphere there had been a little tense but they hadn't expected things to become so lively now.</p><br/><p>*Ding ding!*</p><br/><p>Then, the phone rang.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at it and picked it up. \"Mum, what's wrong?\"</p><br/><p>\"Come back tomorrow.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was shocked, \"Mum, did something happen?\"</p><br/><p>\"Don't talk too much. Your dad and I picked a lady for you. She seems really good. Come back tomorrow and go for the matchmaking session.\"</p><br/><p>Although he didn't use the loudspeaker, Wang Ming Yang and the others managed to hear the conversation. Then, they pointed at Lin Fan and laughed, \"Look, someone's being urged to get married\u2026\"</p><br/><p>When Wu You Lan heard 'matchmaking', her expression changed.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan glared at Wang Ming Yang. He wanted them to shut up.</p><br/><p>\"Why are you guys so noisy\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied to the phone, \"I can't go back tomorrow. Why did you arrange a matchmaking session for me? I'm not prepared to get married.\"</p><br/><p>\"What do you mean by you're not prepared? It doesn't require any preparation. Your dad and I have prepared everything. Just come back. This time, she's really decent. She is pretty and she just graduated from a music school. Your dad and I both know that you will like someone as pretty as her. Please listen to us and come back.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan helplessly said, \"Mum\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"Alright, I'll stop right here. You must come back tomorrow. Your dad and I are picking clothes for you to wear. Your dad is such a clueless man. He doesn't even bother to dress up for such a big occasion like this. He said he wanted to wear old clothes. Wouldn't that create a bad impression?\"</p><br/><p>\"Also, please make your dad and I proud. Elder Li that lives beside us always compares himself to your dad. Your dad only loses in one aspect: Elder Li gets to take care of his grandson everyday. Meanwhile, your dad is empty-handed. Elder Li always makes fun of him and your dad feels very lonely.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was speechless, \"...\"</p><br/><p>What a sh*tty reason!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

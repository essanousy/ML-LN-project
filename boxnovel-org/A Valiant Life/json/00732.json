For something like this to have happened when it had just begun, who knew what would happen later on?</p><br/><p>Initially, the Deputy Director had wanted to clear things up with Lin Fan and tactfully express that they didn\u2019t wish for anything like this to happen again in future. They really couldn\u2019t afford for it to happen. It would likely draw ridicule. However, when he saw Lin Fan\u2019s relaxed smile, the Deputy Director\u2019s words, which he had already rehearsed beforehand, were kept bottled up in his heart.</p><br/><p>On the Internet.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you watch yesterday\u2019s \u2018Strongest Heavenly Voice\u2019? It was freaking awesome. It was so good to watch. The contestants in the show sing very well but the most important thing is that Master Lin is really amazing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, I know about \u2018Strongest Heavenly Voice\u2019 but I didn\u2019t watch it. Is it really so good?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s freaking good. Although the show\u2019s style is similar to previous shows, you definitely won\u2019t regret watching it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin is really too dashing. He\u2019s godly. That contestant was an idiot. He wanted to act pitiful to get sympathy but he was immediately exposed by Master Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI think Zhao Li and Liu Ying Dong\u2019s faces must be black right now. They are both seniors in the music industry but they got flamed by Lin Fan so badly. I almost died of laughter.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI think that the only one who dares to talk this way is Master Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is the show that I want to watch.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, you guys are making me curious. When I saw the show\u2019s name, I didn\u2019t really want to watch it. I never thought that it would be so good. I\u2019ll go and watch the replay right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe second episode will begin at 8 pm sharp tonight. I\u2019ve already canceled all my plans. I\u2019ll just stay right in front of my computer.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was very popular on the Internet.</p><br/><p>Weibo!</p><br/><p>Forums!</p><br/><p>Tieba!</p><br/><p>They had been filled with talk about \u2018Strongest Heavenly Voice\u2019, especially the previous night\u2019s number one contestant, Huang Fei. She had gotten on trending but she immediately got flamed by everyone.</p><br/><p>Zhao Li looked at the news and her face turned green. She slammed her phone on the table furiously, clenching her teeth.</p><br/><p>\u201cOutrageous. That b*astard shamed me. Look at what the Internet is saying.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Ying Dong sat there without saying anything. He wasn\u2019t in a much better position. However, he took a look and his face turned black as well. If it was possible, he would want to cut Lin Fan to death.</p><br/><p>\u2018Master Lin educates Zhao Li. Don\u2019t think that you are always right. Listen to different opinions.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Strongest Heavenly Voice\u2019s number one contestant toys around with Zhao Li but Master Lin exposes her.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Liu Ying Dong\u2019s inner qualities are too low and he suffers Master Lin\u2019s criticism.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>*ring ring*</p><br/><p>Zhao Li\u2019s phone rang.</p><br/><p>\u201cSister Ying\u2026\u201d Zhao Li answered the phone. She knew what it meant when Sister Ying called. However, she felt wronged. She had never experienced such humiliation on a show before.</p><br/><p>Ying Jin said, \u201cI\u2019ve seen the show. Don\u2019t be too bothered by it. This kid is too ridiculous. I\u2019ve already decided that I\u2019m going to teach him a lesson. Otherwise, he wouldn\u2019t know the just how vast this world is.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Li was taken aback. \u201cSister Ying, what do we need to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to care about this. I\u2019ve already made arrangements. Ignore him on the show. People like him cannot go far. There are many people who want to teach him a lesson,\u201d said Ying Jin.</p><br/><p>Zhao Li nodded, \u201cUnderstood, Sister Ying.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two of them chatted for a while more before hanging up.</p><br/><p>Liu Ying Dong asked, \u201cIs Sister Ying going to make a move?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Li nodded, \u201cMmm. Sister Ying wants us to ignore him. You know too that Sister Ying got humiliated by that guy greatly. Do you think Sister Ying would just swallow it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Ying Dong thought about what that kid had done to Sister Ying and couldn\u2019t help but start sweating. That guy was probably the only one who dared to do such a thing to Sister Ying.</p><br/><p>But then, Liu Ying Dong started laughing. Ying Jin was high in status and she had a great network of connections. Defeating that guy would be a simple task.</p><br/><p>Shanghai TV.</p><br/><p>A group of people was anxiously waiting. From the Director to the small staff, everyone was waiting in anticipation.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre the results out yet?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI wonder how it will be. If the ratings aren\u2019t good, we\u2019re screwed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI feel that this show is good. I don\u2019t think it will be too bad.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s useless for us to say that it is good. We have to see if the audience likes it. A problem occurred right at the start yesterday. I\u2019m afraid that it might affect the results.\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Liu sat there and coughed softly. \u201cHasn\u2019t the statistics sheet come out yet?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Deputy Director said, \u201cThey should be adding it up now. It\u2019ll be out soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>A middle-aged lady was very displeased as she said, \u201cIn my opinion, Master Lin should never have been allowed to come and be a mentor. Look, an initially good show now has such a bad start. It can\u2019t be any good now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHead Wu, it isn\u2019t right for you to say that. Master Lin spoke the truth. That contestant was trying to trick the audience and the mentors. If people found out afterward, even if it wasn\u2019t our Shanghai TV\u2019s fault, we would be affected for sure.\u201d</p><br/><p>Head Wu frowned. \u201cEven so, he shouldn\u2019t have criticized the two mentors on the spot.\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Liu rubbed his temples. \u201cAlright, stop quarreling. We\u2019ll know once the statistics are out.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, a staff member hurried into the room with a statistics sheet in his hands.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe statistics are out.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow much is it?\u201d Everyone was energized. To them, whether or not the show was well-received would be represented by the results.</p><br/><p>The staff member looked at the sheet and took a deep breath. He was greatly shocked. Then, he spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cTelevision ratings: 3.524\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMarket share: 14.44\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow much?\u201d the Deputy Director was startled as he asked in astonishment. He was clearly in disbelief.</p><br/><p>Everyone else was the same. They had all been shocked by those statistics.</p><br/><p>That staff member wanted to say it once more but the Deputy Director snatched the sheet away. He fixed his gaze on it. On it were all the ratings of every show on every channel.</p><br/><p>The first place was, to his surprise, \u2018Strongest Heavenly Voice\u2019. Its rating was at 3.524 and it was 0.5 higher than the second place show.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha,\u201d the Deputy Director started laughing, \u201cLook, the viewership rating is 3.524. It\u2019s 0.5 higher than the second place and that\u2019s Hunan TV\u2019s hottest show. Our show is even hotter than Hunan TV\u2019s hottest show!\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone immediately gathered around. When they saw the ratings, they were astounded.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s really in first place. It\u2019s a hit!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c3.524. Have we ever exceeded such a rating before?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI think it has happened once before. And I remember that that time, Master Lin participated as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I remember it. That was the North and South Gambling Kings show. That time, the ratings reached 3.85 but it was only for one episode. Afterward, the show went downhill.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCould it be that every variety show that Master Lin participates in will get such a high rating? That\u2019s too scary. It\u2019s enough for him to earn the title \u2018Ratings Reaper\u2019.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bam!</p><br/><p>At that moment, Director Liu slammed his table. With a face of excitement, he said, \u201cGood. This is very good. The first episode was a hit. I was worried about yesterday\u2019s incident but it seems that I worried for nothing. Listen carefully, all of you, whatever Master Lin does or says on the show in future, as long as he doesn\u2019t hit anyone, don\u2019t stop him. Alright, we\u2019ve blown off some steam. We\u2019ve finally surpassed Hunan TV.\u201d</p><br/><p>When the crowd heard this, they all nodded.</p><br/><p>Shanghai TV had always been over the tenth place or seventh or eighth place at best in the past. That Hunan TV had been like a great mountain that they could never surpass. Now, this \u2018Strongest Heavenly Voice\u2019 had given them limitless possibilities. How could they not be excited?</p><br/><p>\u2026</p></div>\n</div>"}

In an instant, he had been screwed over by Lin Fan.</p><br/><p><em>Kacha</em></p><br/><p>That was the sound of the screen unlocking.</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t screw you over. You\u2019re dishonest. If you just confessed, everything would have been fine. Although you would be punished, there would have been some leniency. What\u2019s the point of being so sneaky and evasive?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shook his head and looked at the phone. Then, he opened QQ.</p><br/><p><em>Buzz buzz buzz</em></p><br/><p>The phone kept vibrating. Numerous groups were sending messages nonstop.</p><br/><p>With one look, his eyes were dazzled. He didn\u2019t even know which messages to look at.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan passed the phone to the policeman beside him. \u201cTake a good look and see if there are any suspicious messages inside.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d The policeman took the phone and started checking. He was looking at those messages very seriously and wouldn\u2019t even miss a single one.</p><br/><p>Very soon, the policeman found a particular group.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, look at this. There\u2019s something fishy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan took the phone and took a close look. Indeed, there was something wrong. There weren\u2019t many things said in the chat. However, there were a lot of messages. It made him feel that this was not as simple as it seemed.</p><br/><p>Then, he opened a certain message.</p><br/><p>\u201c$5000, thirteen-years-old\u2026\u201d Lin Fan read it out aloud. When Yang Dong heard that, his face turned pale. He didn\u2019t know what to say.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026\u201d Yang Dong was about to speak, but he was interrupted.</p><br/><p>The investigating policeman said, \u201cYang Dong, the evidence is right there. I hope that you\u2019ll answer us truthfully. Don\u2019t think that you\u2019re not in trouble just because you haven\u2019t done anything, understand?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yang Dong\u2019s throat was trembling. His expression was unsightly. He had been discovered and he had lost hope.</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian said, \u201cMaster Lin, what do you think we should do now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cLet me ask this girl what happened. I feel that this matter is quite complicated. There is definitely something we don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian nodded. He agreed very much with what Lin Fan had said.</p><br/><p>\u201cI think we\u2019d better go to your office,\u201d said Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>There were too many people and policeman here. It wouldn\u2019t be good to frighten the little girl.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou guys keep interrogating him.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Liu Xiao Tian followed Master Lin up, he told his colleagues to continue interrogating that guy.</p><br/><p>They would not help to conceal this crime. They were definitely going to let his family and his company know what he had done.</p><br/><p>Such behaviour had to be dealt with severely. They could not let this criminal feel like he got let go easily at all. Also, they had to find out for sure if he was a first-time offender or a repeat offender.</p><br/><p>In the office.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan tapped the girl\u2019s head lightly, and the little girl suddenly regained her senses. When she saw the situation around her, she was clearly a little frightened.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle girl, what\u2019s your name?\u201d Lin Fan asked.</p><br/><p>Li Xiao Xiao looked at everything in front of her. But when she saw Lin Fan, she was startled. Then, she asked cautiously, \u201cAre you Master Lin?\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian instantly smiled. He hadn\u2019t thought that Master Lin\u2019s fame had gotten so big. Even children knew him. That was quite scary.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cYes, I am. Do you know me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xiao Xiao nodded. \u201cYes, I do. My classmates all know you. My Dad really likes you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. \u201cOh, looks like I\u2019m quite famous. Oh right, what happened just now? Why did you go to a place like that all alone?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xiao Xiao\u2019s expression changed when she heard that. Then, she lowered her head, took out her phone, opened an application, and handed her phone over.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan took the phone and looked at the screen.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Liu Xiao Tian stood behind and looked closely as well. He was still a little dazed. What exactly was going on? In that instant, he was a little confused.</p><br/><p>However, when he saw the QQ group, he was stunned.</p><br/><p>\u201cUnion Against the Second Child\u201d</p><br/><p>What kind of organization is that? Why would anyone create such a group?</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the group description and his expression changed drastically. Now, he understood what had happened.</p><br/><p>It turned out that this was a group of children who didn\u2019t want to have siblings.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan found it quite hard to understand. First, he didn\u2019t have a wife. Secondly, he didn\u2019t have children.</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t imagine what on Earth was going on at all.</p><br/><p>However, when he clicked on the group creator\u2019s details, he could immediately tell that although she was female, she was not a student.</p><br/><p>When he opened the other administrators\u2019 profiles, they were all adults.</p><br/><p>Then, he looked at the information in the group. There were few male students. Most of them were female students. Moreover, most of them were around thirteen years old. Some were even eleven or twelve years old.</p><br/><p>Just as Lin Fan was looking through the group, something happened.</p><br/><p>Another female student joined the group. Looking at her profile, she was fourteen years old. It seemed as if all those group administrators had been waiting. Once she joined, all of them welcomed her.</p><br/><p>After looking for a while, Lin Fan understood.</p><br/><p>This group was created by people with devious intentions. They wanted to get primary school students who didn\u2019t want to have siblings into this group. Then, they would brainwash the students.</p><br/><p>Also, judging from what he had seen on Yang Dong\u2019s phone, they would put these students\u2019 personal information in another group and put them up for a price for these people with fetishes.</p><br/><p>Once one of the students\u2019 took the bait, things would turn out horribly.</p><br/><p>Once they set a place to meet, the student would be dragged in. Even if he or she resisted, it would be useless. Once the student got frightened or was given some money, everything would be resolved.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, this matter is very severe,\u201d said Liu Xiao Tian.</p><br/><p>He had not thought that something like this was going on.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded. \u201cMmm. This matter is very severe indeed. Chief Liu, you have a huge responsibility now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian took this matter very seriously now. \u201cWe have to find out where these administrators are. And we have to link up with the chat application company and get them to cooperate with us.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is no room for delay. Perhaps while we were speaking, another child was tricked by them. If these people are caught by me, I\u2019ll definitely teach them a good lesson.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cLeave this to me. Just touching a computer wouldn\u2019t be illegal, would it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Naturally, Liu Xiao Tian knew about Master Lin\u2019s situation. He had been restricted from touching computers. However, this matter could not be delayed. Those people had to be located immediately.</p><br/><p>\u201cGo ahead. If anything happens, I\u2019ll bear the blame. This matter must be resolved as soon as possible. We have to find those people at once.\u201d Liu Xiao Tian allowed Master Lin to do it without hesitation.</p><br/><p>If one were to ask whose computer skills were the best in the world, the answer would definitely be none other than Master Lin\u2019s. Finding those people wouldn\u2019t even be a problem.</p><br/><p>But after this situation was resolved, there would still be other matters to take care of, like dealing with the children\u2019s psychological well-being.</p><br/><p>This time, even if the group were disbanded, these children\u2019s attitudes would still be wrong. They would still get manipulated by others.</p><br/><p>They had to be guided.</p><br/><p>But that wasn\u2019t a matter that concerned the two men.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

You actually humiliated me by rejecting my kindness. I won\u2019t give it to you anymore. I\u2019m going to give it to someone else.\u201d Then, Lin Fan kept the pill. This fella didn\u2019t know how to appreciate things at all. He thought of him the moment he got something good. Now, he even said that the pill he crafted was like bird sh*t.</p><br/><p>However, he also admitted that it somewhat looked like bird sh*t because it was white with streaks of yellow.</p><br/><p>But he shouldn\u2019t have said that.</p><br/><p>It was heartbreaking, truly heartbreaking.</p><br/><p>\u201cI was just kidding and you thought I was serious,\u201d Wang Ming Yang said as he grabbed onto Lin Fan\u2019s hand. Then, he smiled and placed the pill on his hand. He looked at I closely and asked, \u201cAre you sure this pill is edible? Why do I feel like something is wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn you, why did you take it if there\u2019s something wrong? Return it to me then,\u201d Lin Fan pretended to snatch it from him.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang smiled and swallowed it. \u201cNot going to return it. I\u2019ve eaten it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at him, \u201cIsn\u2019t there something wrong with it? Why did you eat it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang said, \u201cI don\u2019t really care if there was something wrong. You\u2019re the one who gave it to me. I know you wouldn\u2019t harm me. If someone else gave me this, I\u2019d have thrown it away. But really, what\u2019s this pill for? Why does it taste a little sweet?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled, \u201cI\u2019ll tell you then. This is the little Intelligence pill. It\u2019s f*cking awesome. There are only 3 pills and you took 1. Now, there\u2019s 2 left. It wasn\u2019t easy to make these.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang was anxious to find out what the pill could do. \u201cTell me, what\u2019s the main function of the pill?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you dumb? Haven\u2019t I told you the name of the pill? Little Intelligence pill is used to increase intelligence. If you want to become a genius, you have to depend on it.\u201d Lin Fan didn\u2019t know what the pill was capable of achieving but he knew it was good stuff.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang gasped, \u201cThat sounds so f*cking awesome. You\u2019re not lying, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was fed up, \u201cYou still don\u2019t believe me. Forget it, I won\u2019t talk about it anymore. Anyway, you\u2019ve eaten it already. When I come up with I the perfect pill, I\u2019ll not give it to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2018No way, we\u2019re good friends. Are you sure you won\u2019t give it to me? I was just asking a question out of curiosity. Why are you so angry?\u201d Wang Ming Yang asked.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded, \u201cThat\u2019s more like it. This pill is definitely something good. I spent so much time and effort to create it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang nodded, \u201cI\u2019ll believe you then. Since you said it\u2019s good, it\u2019s definitely good.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s right to trust me. I wouldn\u2019t harm you.\u201d Lin Fan thought of something else. \u201cOh, do you know where to buy alchemy furnaces?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlchemy furnace?\u201d Wang Ming Yang paused for a moment. \u201cIt\u2019s so rare nowadays. Nobody even uses it anymore. However, quite a number of people use it as a display item.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was a little disappointed. It was indeed something rare.</p><br/><p>If he didn\u2019t have an alchemy furnace, it would be nearly impossible to craft the little intelligence pill. The pressure cooker could only craft normal pills. It wouldn\u2019t meet his standards at all.</p><br/><p>After leaving Wang Ming Yang.</p><br/><p>He still had the new Jeep. Although Wang Ming Yang didn\u2019t say anything about it, the way he looked at him was obvious. He couldn\u2019t afford to let him continue spending money this way. Nobody could handle the rapid rate.</p><br/><p>Before he could obtain an alchemy furnace, he wouldn\u2019t practice pill creation anymore since it was useless.</p><br/><p>At Cloud Street!</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan asked anxiously, \u201cBrother Lin, is everything ok?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Lin Fan smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s perfectly fine now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although he encountered some difficulties, everything was still considered to be okay.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Then, Liu Xiao Tian appeared. Lin Fan was a little shocked. \u201cInspector Liu, what brought you here today?\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian smiled, \u201cMaster Lin, look at this. If you encounter something like this, you have to let me know.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan took the paper over. It was a drawing of someone\u2019s face. \u201cWho is this guy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe is a drug trafficker. We got information that this man secretly entered Shanghai but we do not have a picture of him. We only have a drawing from a long time ago,\u201d Liu Xiao Tian replied.</p><br/><p>The entire Shanghai police force was on high alert for this case. The police force with the drugs department had been working hard to crack this case.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow can I find him with this? Is there only this blur picture?\u201d Lin Fan asked.</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian sighed, \u201cWe can\u2019t help it. This man is difficult to arrest. However, there is a scorpion tattoo on his neck. That is the only clue we have. You are one of us and I\u2019ll just be frank with you. This man is extremely dangerous. The entire Shanghai police force is working together to capture this man. If not, we\u2019d never know the number of drugs he will be bringing into Shanghai.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded, \u201cAlright, don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll keep a lookout. If I find out anything, I\u2019ll tell you immediately.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was virtually impossible to find a man in Shanghai just based on his tattoo.</p><br/><p>Although Lin Fan was righteous and morally upright, he could only handle small cases. These big cases should be left to the police force.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have to go. We have to continue our investigations,\u201d Liu Xiao Tian said.</p><br/><p>As Lin Fan watched Liu Xiao Tian leave, he shook his head. Life seemed good for Liu Xiao Tian after he became an inspector. His status was high now and he was in charge of a lot more things now. He looked way skinnier than what he used to be.</p><br/><p>He held onto the paper and looked at it. This man was crazy. He must be asking for trouble to be bringing drugs into Shanghai.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Boss\u2026\u201d Then, Chen Jun, a shop owner, came with a bag of fruits. \u201cThis is what I got from my hometown. The apples are extremely sweet. I came here to deliver some to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled, \u201cElder Chen, you\u2019re so thoughtful.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Jun replied, \u201cLittle Boss, don\u2019t mention it. You don\u2019t have to feel bad. We are all from Cloud Street and we\u2019re one.\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Liang came over and when he saw the bag of apples, he asked on purpose, \u201cElder Chen, that\u2019s unfair of you. You gave Little Boss a bag but only gave us two apples. That\u2019s a little unfair.\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Chen rebutted, \u201cI wanted to give more to Little Boss. He contributed so much to this Street. I have to give him more. If you don\u2019t have enough, I\u2019ll give you a little more later.\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Liang twitched his lips, \u201cNo, I knew you\u2019d come here to curry Little Boss\u2019s favor.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled, \u201cAlright, alright. It\u2019s good enough for Elder Chen to give you some. Don\u2019t ask for too much.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you hear that? What Little Boss said was right. You guys think that I gave you too few apples. You are so greedy,\u201d Elder Chen said.</p><br/><p>Of course, it was just friendly banter between the both of them. Lin Fan really liked the friendly atmosphere that they have created here.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Lin Fan looked at Chen Jun\u2019s face and he was stunned.</p><br/><p>Chen Jun was shocked, \u201cLittle Boss, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan suddenly realized that Chen Jun\u2019s fortune had changed. It seemed a little weird. Then, he took a closer look and started to read his fortune.</p><br/><p>If he hadn\u2019t looked closely, he wouldn\u2019t have realized it.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, it can\u2019t be. Are my eyes playing tricks on me?\u201d Lin Fan was in doubt. Then, he grabbed onto Elder Chen\u2019s hand and looked at his palms.</p><br/><p>He was going to experience the death of a youngster in his family.</p><br/><p>Elder Chen was dumbfounded by the Little Boss\u2019s actions. \u201cLittle Boss, what are you doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cElder Chen, where is your son studying at?\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Chen didn\u2019t realize the nature of the conversation, he smiled, \u201cLittle Boss, my son is with me in Shanghai. However, after he came here with me, he has been staying in the school\u2019s hostel. I believe even Little Boss hasn\u2019t seen him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said sternly, \u201cElder Chen, I am not kidding. Where is your son studying at? Something bad is going to happen.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Elder Chen was initially smiling but his happiness vanished. It was replaced with shock.</p><br/><p>Elder Liang started to look serious too, \u201cElder Chen, Little Boss is asking you something. Why aren\u2019t you replying? Do you know what Little Boss is trying to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, Elder Chen recovered from his state of shock.</p><br/><p>If someone else said that, he would have slapped his face for insulting his son. However, everyone knew who Little Boss was.</p><br/><p>Perhaps everyone in Cloud Street knew how capable Little Boss was.</p><br/><p>Then, Elder Chen started to stutter. \u201cLittle Boss, my son\u2026 my son\u2026 is studying at Jin Yang Secondary School.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go, let\u2019s go. We have to go to Jin Yang Secondary School now. Quick\u2026\u201d Lin Fan pulled Elder Chen and walked out anxiously.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian and the others rushed out, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Why did they leave so hurriedly?\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Liang said, \u201cI don\u2019t know. Little Boss said that Elder Chen\u2019s son is going to be in trouble. Then, he took him away.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Tian He said, \u201cMaster Lin\u2019s fortune-telling ability is second to none. I\u2019m afraid something bad is really going to happen.\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Liang felt unsettled after hearing that, \u201cElder Tian, can you help me look after my shop? I would like to go along too.\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

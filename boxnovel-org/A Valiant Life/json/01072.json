Don\u2019t you think so?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan nodded as she seemed to agree. \u201cI feel that way too. Did you see how dispirited the Yokohama F. Marinos players were in the end? Even when they gained possession, the Golden Flowers players would just rest in the original positions, waiting for you the throw the ball over. When I saw that, I nearly died of laughter.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled. He felt that that had been a little unfair. The Yokohama F. Marinos players had been running up and down the field and they had been exhausted. Meanwhile, the Golden Flowers players had just been resting on the opposition\u2019s side of the field just waiting for the ball to come to them.</p><br/><p>In terms of stamina, the Yokohama F. Marinos had already been completely drained. How could they even compete in the end?</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan said, \u201cBrother Lin, when tomorrow comes, this will definitely blow up. This wasn\u2019t even broadcasted live. If it was, things would have already gone out of control.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shook his head helplessly. \u201cSigh. I just wanted to live my life in a low-key fashion, opening a shop and making scallion pancakes. Now that things have become like this, it really makes me helpless. Oh well. I\u2019ll just treat it as giving everyone something to be happy about.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan slanted her head and looked at Lin Fan with a bit of a confused look on her face. She felt that it was really strange for Lin Fan to be able to say such things.</p><br/><p><em>Low-key?</em></p><br/><p><em>If Brother Lin is considered low-key, no one else </em>be <em>considered high-key.</em></p><br/><p>Nighttime!</p><br/><p>On the Golden Flowers forums, people were having a commotion about Lin FAn.</p><br/><p>\u2018A f*cking awesome goalkeeper. If you didn\u2019t see it for yourself, you would never believe it.\u2019</p><br/><p>This post was very popular. It even contained videos and photos. However, because these had been taken from too far of a distance, they weren\u2019t clear at all. Still, one could roughly see what was going on.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn. This is really too f*cking awesome.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat movie is this from? Someone please tell me. I want to watch this movie. The special effects look awesome.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you stupid? This isn\u2019t a movie. This is from the match between Golden Flowers and Yokohama F. Marinos that happened today.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck, don\u2019t lie to me. I\u2019m not very well-educated and I might just believe you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true. I was there today and I was completely astounded. If I didn\u2019t pinch myself, I would\u2019ve thought that I was dreaming.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDoes anyone know who this goalkeeper is? He\u2019s too powerful, isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah! If Golden Flowers has such a strong goalkeeper, why didn\u2019t they let him play from the start? If they let him play, no one would have been able to score against them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease allow me to describe this in one word. Terrorizing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go. We\u2019ll post on the Golden Flowers\u2019 official Weibo. If they don\u2019t let this goalkeeper play in the future, we won\u2019t watch anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, a wave of football fans invaded Golden Flowers\u2019 Weibo and requested them to publicly announce who this goalkeeper was, as well as to let this goalkeeper play every match from now on.</p><br/><p>At the same time, another forum thread also drew many people\u2019s attention.</p><br/><p>\u2018I heard that this goalkeeper is Master Lin. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s true either. I heard it from other people.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck, are you crazy? That\u2019s just blind talk. If it\u2019s really Master Lin, I\u2019ll eat my own sh*t\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, don\u2019t talk rubbish. That\u2019s not possible.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI admit that Master Lin is amazing too but when it comes to goalkeeping, don\u2019t joke around. That\u2019s not possible.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSigh, people nowadays can post anything. Admin, please hurry up and delete this thread.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, stop playing around.</p><br/><p>To the Golden Flowers fans, this was a joyous day because they had won. And that wasn\u2019t even the important part. The important part was that they had won way too dominantly. They had plowed their way through without giving the opposition a chance at all.</p><br/><p>That goalkeeper was simply like a god. As long as he stood at the goal post, no matter who shot the ball, he would be able to block it.</p><br/><p>Also, Yokohama F. Marinos player, Tanaka Hiroshi, had shot the ball so many times but not a single ball had entered the goal. The goalkeeper had even tossed the ball back to him to let him shoot a few more times but it had all been useless.</p><br/><p>To everyone, it had been an unbearable blow.</p><br/><p>But no matter what other people said, this scene had really made the fans\u2019 blood boil. They didn\u2019t even know what to say anymore.</p><br/><p>Wu Ze was now attending the victory feast. When he called Master Lin, Master Lin was already resting so he didn\u2019t join.</p><br/><p>This made Wu Ze feel helpless. He had wanted to get Master Lin to come and play around with the team. But thinking about how busy Master Lin was, he decided to forget about it.</p><br/><p>Still, he was very curious as to what was up with Master Lin. How had he gotten so good at goalkeeping? He was simply way too good\u2026</p><br/><p>At that moment, a middle-aged man walked over. \u201cWu Ze, you\u2019re saying that it was really Master Lin?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Ze looked at this man. This man was the team\u2019s big boss. Then, Wu Ze nodded. Mmm, it\u2019s true. The goalkeeper today was Master Lin. If we could invite Master Lin to join our team, getting into the world cup would not be a problem.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust relying on him?\u201d This middle-aged man seemed not to believe him.</p><br/><p>Wu Ze said, \u201cIf Master Lin really joins, it would be very likely. Because Master Lin\u2019s goalkeeping is really too good. I\u2019m afraid even the top players in the world wouldn\u2019t be able to score against him.\u201d</p><br/><p>He was serious. If Lin Fan had only blocked one or two shots, he wouldn\u2019t have dared to say this. But the opponents had shot so many balls in the match. Even a top goalkeeper wouldn\u2019t have been able to block so many shots.</p><br/><p>But Master Lin had done it. Moreover, he had done it with great ease as if he hadn\u2019t even had to use any strength.</p><br/><p>If Master Lin were to exhibit his true strength, how terrifying would that be? It was unimaginable.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you think we have a chance of getting Master Lin to join us?\u201d The middle-aged man started to form ideas.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not possible. If it was someone else, we could definitely invite him. But this is Master Lin. It\u2019s definitely not possible,\u201d said Wu Ze regretfully. At the same time, he felt helpless. Master Lin was such a good goalkeeper but he wouldn\u2019t join them. If he did, perhaps the world cup rankings would be shifted.</p><br/><p>Number One in the World.</p><br/><p>What a domineering title.</p><br/><p>The Yokohama F. Marinos players were all lying down in the hotel. None of them could muster any energy.</p><br/><p>To them, it was as if they had seen a ghost today.</p><br/><p>Tanaka Hiroshi, in particular, had taken a huge blow to his heart. That goalkeeper was like a darkness that had seeped into his heart.</p><br/><p>He had forgotten how many times he had kicked the ball at the goal today. Even though he had used all his strength, it had been completely useless.</p><br/><p>This left him in utter despair.</p></div>\n</div>"}

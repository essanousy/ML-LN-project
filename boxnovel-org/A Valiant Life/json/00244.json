Then, he stood up. \"This is a local police station. Please wait for him outside. He intentionally damaged public property and has to be detained here till the results are out.\"</p><br/><p>Lu Li smiled at the police officer. \"I am friends with your Chief Liang. Chief Qiao was at fault but I would like to speak to this man before taking any further action. We can talk about it and there's no need to escalate this matter.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded at the police officer. \"It's okay, we'll just be chatting.\"</p><br/><p>He knew that this police officer was trying to protect him and he was grateful for that. However, he was surely not going to be in any trouble by staying there even if they wanted to take him on 1-to-1 or in a group fight. Nobody could match him. As for the abuse of power, it would be useless against him. If a businessman like him wanted to make things difficult for him and went to look for a leader, it would still be useless. He wasn't a 'paper tiger'. Whoever tried to mess with him would definitely suffer a horrific fate.</p><br/><p>Lu Li stood before Lin Fan. \"Brother, this isn't a serious matter. We will definitely pay you for your losses. As for the $300,000, it seems like it's too much. After all, money doesn't grow on trees. Let's both compromise and settle this matter privately. We don't have to go to court for this.\"</p><br/><p>Then, Lu Li took out his name card from his pocket. \"Let's be friends. You can look for me in future if you need any help.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan took the name card with golden borders. Then, he looked at it. \"CEO of the Skyworth Organisation, Lu Li.\"</p><br/><p>The information was clearly written on the name card and there wasn't any other irrelevant information. Furthermore, he had heard of this Skyworth Organisation before. It was a mega company. Also, the headquarters were on the waterfront. They were a renowned company in Shanghai too.</p><br/><p>\"Oh, so you're a big boss. You're indeed young and capable,\" Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>Lu Li remained speechless. Skyworth Organisation hadn't been started by him. He had merely inherited it from his dad. He wasn't so capable to start up a well-known company all on his own at this age.</p><br/><p>Qiao Fei couldn't match up to him but he had a lot of power as the Vice-Chairman of a shipping company in Zhongzhou. However, his net worth wasn't as high as his.</p><br/><p>This time, Qiao Fei had come to Shanghai to discuss a contract with Lu Li. Skyworth Organisation needed help with shipping for some of their projects.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan immediately placed the name card aside and said, \"You mentioned that $300,000 is too much. Then, do you know who I am?\"</p><br/><p>Lu Li was stunned while Qiao Fei chuckled, \"Haha, you dare to ask Chief Lu if he knows who you are? You're just a small fry, who do you think you are?\"</p><br/><p>\"Chief Qiao, let me handle this,\" Lu Li shook his head and said. He hadn't expected Chief Qiao to be so hot-headed even though he knew about his temper. He looked at Lin Fan and chuckled, \"I don't know that you are.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied calmly, \"I am Master Lin from Cloud Street. $300,000 is actually considered very little. Do you think I'm asking for too much?\"</p><br/><p>The police officer interrupted, \"Master Lin sells scallion pancakes every morning. The townsfolk queue up for it every morning and the queue can stretch until the end of Cloud Street. Now that his shop has been destroyed, he can't continue with his business. The renovation would take ten days and $300,000 would be considered little.\"</p><br/><p> Qiao Fei couldn't help it and he started to laugh, \"What did you say? He sells scallion pancakes and you're saying he can make $300,000 in ten days? Please continue bragging.\"</p><br/><p>Lu Li was stunned. \"The legendary Lin scallion pancakes?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yeah,\" Lin Fan said as he nodded. Then, he looked at Lu Li. \"Do you think $300,000 is still considered too little?\"</p><br/><p>Lu Li nodded. \"I've heard people talk about the Lin scallion pancakes before. If that's indeed the case, $300,000 doesn't seem to be a lot.\"</p><br/><p>\"Chief Lu, don't listen to his bullsh*t. Do you think it's possible?\" Qiao Fei asked.</p><br/><p>\"Chief Qiao, if it is really the case, $300,000 isn't considered a lot,\" Lu Li said. Then, he looked at Lin Fan. \"How about this, I'll pay for the $300,000 and we'll settle this matter in peace. I'll treat you to dinner tonight and we can get to know each other.\"</p><br/><p>Qiao Fei sneered, \"Have a meal with him? I'll pass. It'll probably decrease my net worth.\"</p><br/><p>Lu Li furrowed his brows as he couldn't figure out why Qiao Fei hated him so much. The matter could be settled in such a peaceful manner and everything would be okay. There was no need for conflict at all.</p><br/><p>Of course, he didn't know that Qiao Fei had gotten slapped by Lin Fan at the airport. If he had known about it, he probably wouldn't think the same way.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Qiao Fei didn't want to tell this to other people as he was embarrassed about it.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved his hand. \"Forget it, we can forget about having a meal. The money shouldn't be paid by you. He will have to pay for it. If this matter isn't resolved, then we will go to court.\"</p><br/><p>Lu Li frowned and whispered into Lin Fan's ear, \"Actually, there's no need for that. He has some connections and he knows several notable leaders. This matter isn't that serious. The final outcome might even disappoint you.\" Then, he raised his head and patted Lin Fan on his shoulder. \"Listen to me. I'll give you $300,000 in cash immediately.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled and pinky promised Lu Li. \"Please come over here, I want to tell you something too.\"</p><br/><p>Lu Li was a little curious and then he lowered his head. Lin Fan whispered into his ear, \"Do you believe that any leader who dares to go against me will be jobless within one month? If he's a 'clean' leader then perhaps I won't have anything against him but can you ensure that all the leaders surrounding him are 'clean'?\"</p><br/><p>After hearing what Lin Fan said, Lu Li was stunned. He realized that his smile was just a normal one and he wasn't smiling because he was plotting something against him.</p><br/><p>Then, he said, \"Actually, I have another profession. I am also a fortune-teller. But normal people wouldn't believe in it. Do you believe in it?\"</p><br/><p>Lu Li was stunned. He remained silent for a while as if he was shocked by what Lin Fan had said.</p><br/><p> Qiao Fei didn't know what they were whispering to each other about. But when he saw Lin Fan's cocky expression, he immediately went forward. \"Chief Lu, this matter can remain like this for now. I will stay here for the night. When this is over, I will settle the contract matters with you.\"</p><br/><p>Lu Li felt like this person was unlike anyone he had seen before. It was an indescribable feeling. It was like he was in control of everything. If it had been someone else, he/she would have immediately agreed to his offer without any hesitation.</p><br/><p>But he didn't understand why Lin Fan was so confident in dealing with all the leaders. He claimed that he could make any leader jobless as long as they were corrupted.</p><br/><p>That sounded like bullsh*t.</p><br/><p>However, he somehow felt as if this person wasn't lying at all.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan wasn't lying and if someone really pushed him to the edge, he had a lot of ways to destroy the person.</p><br/><p>Then, Lin Fan looked at the police officer. \"The matter should be resolved for now, can I leave?\"</p><br/><p>The police officer nodded. \"You can leave now. The evaluation department is already handling the case. There will be an outcome soon.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at Qiao Fei. \"Chief Qiao, we can take our time with this. In the future, you can continue with your 'performance'. My shop will forever be open for you to destroy.\"</p><br/><p>\"F*cker, you better not be so cocky. I'm telling you this, I will not be in trouble at all,\" Qiao Fei scolded.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shrugged. \"Who knows?\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

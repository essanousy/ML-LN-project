I just looked at the International Nobel Prize Lottery website. I saw you on it and the odds are pretty good. I\u2019m prepared to place my hopes on you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh? There\u2019s actually something like that? Wow.\u201d Lin Fan laughed. He hadn\u2019t expected there to even be odds on the international website. It was a little scary.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang: \u201cBrother, I shan\u2019t say more. In order to support you, I\u2019m going to place a bet on you getting the prize. It\u2019s meaningful, isn\u2019t it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t. Wait a minute. Let me predict it for you.\u201d Lin Fan rubbed his fingers together and read the future. \u201cMing Yang, I\u2019d advise you not to place your bet. I\u2019ve just read your fortune for you. You have signs of suffering financial losses in the near future.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSigh, why don\u2019t you have any faith in yourself? The cure for leukemia! What a big development that is! I\u2019ll say it here. If you don\u2019t get the prize, I\u2019ll run naked around Shanghai. Do you believe me?\u201d Wang Ming Yang had blind faith in this brother of his.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-2\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>He had so much faith that he would go streaking if his brother didn\u2019t win the award.</p><br/><p>Wouldn\u2019t you be scared if you were in Lin Fan\u2019s place?</p><br/><p>\u201cI believe you.\u201d Lin Fan definitely wanted to make Wang Ming Yang streak. But that shameless guy was probably just talking bullsh*t.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh right, when will the Nobel Prize in Medicine be given out?\u201d asked Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>\u201cSoon. Within a month. Now, your name has already entered the lottery. That means you\u2019ve pretty much qualified. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll keep an eye out for you. If anything happens, I\u2019ll notify you immediately,\u201d said Wang Ming Yang.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan sighed. \u201cBut I\u2019ve read the future. I really won\u2019t get the award. Forget it, if you want to keep watching it, then so be it. I won\u2019t be paying any attention.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, he just hung up.</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang said excitedly, \u201cBrother Lin, if you really get the award, that would be awesome. You would be the first person from our country to win it.\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-3\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled. \u201cAlright, don\u2019t think about it anymore. It\u2019s not possible.\u201d</p><br/><p>But he felt like even if he said that, the others wouldn\u2019t believe him. He had just read the future and seen that he wouldn\u2019t receive any prizes in the near future.</p><br/><p><em>Forget it, forget it. Let them rejoice blindly then. When the truth is out, they\u2019ll know.</em></p><br/><p>Several days later.</p><br/><p>On a certain foreign Nobel Prize forum.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy is there a Chinese man nominated for the Nobel Prize in Medicine? Are my eyes deceiving me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, the Nobel Prize in Medicine is the most unlikely prize that the Chinese would win. I never thought that there would be a Chinese man nominated this year.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLin Fan. What a strange name. Does anyone know what achievements he has?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know. He\u2019s not a professor, nor a scientist. He\u2019s a Weibo host.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s a Weibo host?\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-4\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cThat means he\u2019s an Internet celebrity.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGod, you must be joking. How can an Internet celebrity be nominated for the Nobel Prize in Medicine?\u201d</p><br/><p>Japan.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis year, Naoko Hegeki has been nominated for the Nobel Prize in Medicine. He will surely break through and win the award.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSomeone from China has been nominated as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not possible. You must be mistaken.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSee for yourselves. I saw it on the Nobel Prize official website.\u201d</p><br/><p>On the internet, discussions were intense.</p><br/><p>But Lin Fan didn\u2019t care about all this at all. However, media agencies were all rushing to report this incident.</p><br/><p>Although he hadn\u2019t received the award, he had already been nominated. To them, Master Lin had conquered leukemia, so the award was a sure thing. There definitely wouldn\u2019t be any problems.</p><br/><p>Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan reached the shop, reporters charged over from all directions. To them, this matter was definitely something worth reporting.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-5\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>When he saw these reporters, Lin Fan couldn\u2019t respond in time.</p><br/><p>Because this had happened too suddenly.</p><br/><p>It left him dazed and confused.</p><br/><p>A reporter asked, \u201cMaster Lin, what are your thoughts after being nominated for the Nobel Prize in Medicine?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, do you think you will get the award?\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporters wouldn\u2019t let go of this opportunity. They kept on questioning him.</p><br/><p>The large number of reporters had resulted in the shop being surrounded. They couldn\u2019t even stand still amidst the crowd.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved his hand. \u201cEveryone, please don\u2019t push and don\u2019t make so much noise. I\u2019ll answer your questions one by one. Be quiet.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, the reporters quietened down. They had already figured out Master Lin\u2019s style. As long as everyone was quiet and maintained their order, he would definitely answer their questions.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cI can answer your queries now. I won\u2019t receive the award. I really won\u2019t.\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-6\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>The reporters were startled. They hadn\u2019t expected such a reply. Then, they started speaking in disbelief, \u201cMaster Lin, why are you so sure that you won\u2019t receive it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Was there even a need to answer that? Of course, he had predicted it. Wang Ming Yang had wanted to bet on him but he had seen that Wang Ming Yang would end up losing money. Didn\u2019t that mean that Lin Fan wouldn\u2019t receive the award?</p><br/><p>\u201cI read the future,\u201d said Lin Fan calmly.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d The reporters were dumbfounded. <em>What kind of f*cking reason is that? Even if we believe it, we wouldn\u2019t dare to report it. If we report this, we would get flamed to death!</em></p><br/><p><em>We might not even be able to keep our jobs if we do that.</em></p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true. I really read the future. I, Lin Fan, definitely won\u2019t receive the award. I don\u2019t care if you believe me. You can wait until the day the results are out to see for yourselves,\u201d said Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>The reporters still didn\u2019t believe him. \u201cMaster Lin, then who will receive the award?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan had a stupefied look on his face. \u201cI can\u2019t answer that question because I don\u2019t even know those people who got nominated.\u201d</p><br/><p>In the end, the reporters still hadn\u2019t recovered from the shock. What had they gotten out of the interview?</p><br/><p>Master Lin hadn\u2019t even bragged at all and he just said that he wouldn\u2019t get the award. Could it be that he had just been acting humble?</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-7\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>But thinking about how Master Lin had always acted in the past, it seemed unlikely.</p><br/><p>They couldn\u2019t figure it out and they stopped trying. They stopped caring and decided to just post the actual words from Master Lin on the Internet. As for the rest, they would just leave it to the netizens\u2019 imagination.</p><br/><p>The next day!</p><br/><p>When the news was reported, all the netizens were astounded.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow humble. Master Lin is too f*cking humble.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. I\u2019m thinking the same thing. If Master Lin won\u2019t get the award, who would be qualified to get it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSigh. Humility helps one to improve but being too humble is not good either.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cActually, I think Master Lin is speaking the truth. He understands the situation best.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNonsense. Can\u2019t you tell that he\u2019s just being humble? Didn\u2019t you see Master Lin\u2019s calm face? That\u2019s the face of \u2018everything is under control\u2019. Don\u2019t you understand?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan had been paying attention to the situation on the Internet as well. He was completely helpless. <em>If you won\u2019t believe me, I really can\u2019t do anything about it.</em></p><br/><p>\u2026</p></div>\n</div>"}

Also, they used more advanced techniques than him.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, I\u2019ve seen this middle-aged person on TV before. He seems like a powerful dude.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI remember him too. Although I forgot his name, I know he is awesome.\u201d</p><br/><p>The netizens discussed among themselves in shock.</p><br/><p>The cameras changed angles repeatedly to capture the faces of the elders that were present at the event.</p><br/><p>The netizens were in even more shock.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, these people are really influential. Is this really a prize ceremony?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m speechless. It\u2019s shocking! It feels like a grand conference.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin is law-defying this time. Nobody can stop him! Anyway, he is really insane.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, the cameras turned to Lin Fan. When Lin Fan appeared on the screen, everyone went wild.</p><br/><p>\u201c666\u2026 Look, Master Lin is smiling so happily. He must be over the moon.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that rubbish? Anyone in his position would be joyous too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, furthermore, the crowd is really influential. I am really convinced by Master Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho are the elders that are talking to Master Lin? I think I\u2019ve seen them before when I was young, but it\u2019s been a long time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Some of the netizens were in their twenties, and they found the faces of some of these elders familiar which meant that it had been more than ten years since they saw them on TV.</p><br/><p>Besides the netizens, some celebrities were also watching the ceremony.</p><br/><p>Those that had conflicts with Master Lin in the past also trembled when they saw the images on their screens.</p><br/><p>They realised that Master Lin finally grew up and matured. He was also much more influential now, and nobody could mess with him. After all, with the number of connections with the elders now, which celebrity could mess with him?</p><br/><p>They knew their place and decided not to flame Master Lin on the Internet anymore.</p><br/><p>However, only a handful of celebrities dared to flame Lin Fan now even though they probably would never be able to match up to his influential power.</p><br/><p>Even their most loyal fans would be willing to slap them if the celebrities were to mess with Master Lin.</p><br/><p>Especially since the situation was a little unfavourable for them.</p><br/><p>Some of the celebrities did not repost the broadcast video and were questioned by their fans.</p><br/><p>If it was just a single fan asking about that, it would have been fine since people liked to flame celebrities anyway.</p><br/><p>However, everyone after that comment started to ask that question too.</p><br/><p>In the end, the celebrities had no choice but to repost the videos.</p><br/><p>At the ceremony hall.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was a little nervous. After all, he was about to go up on stage.</p><br/><p>The person on stage was a famous and experienced host. He had participated in a lot of grand events before.</p><br/><p>The fact that this host was invited to this event showed how important this ceremony was.</p><br/><p>Soon, the event started and the host started speaking.</p><br/><p>\u201cMay we now invite Master Lin on stage, please,\u201d the host said.</p><br/><p>Then, there was a thunderous applause, especially from Zhao Zhong Yang and the others.</p><br/><p>Master Lin was their close friend and now that he was going up on stage, they had to cheer as loud as they could for him.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin is our country\u2019s Chinese Arts Master, Wushu Master, medical expert, artificial limbs scientist, Internet security professional, etc\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The host said a lot of titles in one go. Although some of these titles did not mean much, it was spectacular that a person possessed all of them.</p><br/><p>Especially because Master Lin\u2019s contributions to the medical world was simply impeccable, it was literally terrifying.</p><br/><p>Besides Master Lin, nobody else could force some hospitals to be closed down.</p><br/><p>The reporter took a quick glance at Master Lin and realised that he was a young but successful man. He was really envious of him.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved to the crowd when he stood on stage.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy dear host, you forgot to mention a title.\u201d</p><br/><p>The host was stunned. \u201cMaster Lin, which one was it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. \u201cMusic producer.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, yeah, and music producer.\u201d The host immediately reacted to his request. Master Lin wrote the famous tune sung by Wu Huan Yue and it was something that nobody could possibly come up with in this lifetime. Master Lin managed to write more than ten of such songs.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cActually, there\u2019s another title.\u201d</p><br/><p>The host answered, \u201cReally?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, God of Gamblers,\u201d Lin Fan said firmly. Many did not know about this specialty of his.</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang and the others laughed when they heard that.</p><br/><p>Although Brother Lin did not gamble frequently, he was extremely good at it.</p><br/><p>Zheng Zhong Shan sat there and laughed while shaking his head. He did not expect this fellow to have said that.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, is there anything else that I missed?\u201d The host asked. He was afraid of missing another one out.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m also a gourmet food expert too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, Master Lin is recognised by the Michelin.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded again. \u201cAlso, I\u2019m a master pianist and\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The host was stunned after hearing that. He did not even hear of anyone having that title before.</p><br/><p>The elders in the crowd just laughed uncontrollably.</p><br/><p>They really believed him when he said that.</p><br/><p>After all, Master Lin was seen to be a godly person, and they would believe anything he said.</p><br/><p>In the broadcast.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, Master Lin is crazy. Did anyone count how many titles he has?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck, I don\u2019t even know man. What was the sculptor title about? I don\u2019t understand it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMe too. What\u2019s the cleaning title about?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Cleaner sounds fine but what was the one about back-scrubbing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, you guys probably don\u2019t know about this, but Master Lin used to work as a back-scrubber at a public bath.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck, are you serious? Why didn\u2019t I know about that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere must be a lot of things you don\u2019t know about. I live in Cloud Street and I know everything about these thi</p><br/>\n</div>"}

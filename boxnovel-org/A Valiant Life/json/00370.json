Although the two did not have much in common, He Cheng Han really admired Lin Fan. He had heard from Wang Ming Yang that Lin Fan was going to take over Nanshan Children's Welfare Institute and to him, that sort of action was really one to be admired.</p><br/><p>This was a strenuous task that brought with it very little gain and it was also a sink financially, requiring a lot of resources. Accounting for the fact that there were hundreds of mouths to feed as well as many other factors, it was definitely not going to be a small sum of money. It was definitely not something many people would go into and if it was not for the government, no one would dare to do something like this.</p><br/><p>Even the richest man in the world would not dare to go into something so strenuous and unrewarding. After all, it was something that had no personal benefit, so who would be willing to do it?</p><br/><p>However, the thing that made him admire Lin Fan the most was that not only was he willing to do it, he did it with no hesitation.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan put out his cigarette and threw it into the bin at the side. \"Let's go in.\"</p><br/><p>\"Wait.\" He Cheng Han was about to nod his head when suddenly, he saw a few people enter through the door. He suddenly let out a smile and said, \"Ah, what a surprise. What is she doing here?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan glanced up and saw the celebrity that he had just dealt earlier with and he looked like he had come with ill-intentions. He said, \"You recognize her?\"</p><br/><p>\"I know her but not very well,\" He Cheng Han replied, \"That lady at the front is a very cunning lady. However, she usually only deals with the entertainment business and she has made many male teen idols famous. She is definitely seen as a very successful woman. However, what is she doing here? She is normally at those high-class wine-receptions or doing important business.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed and said, \"She looks like she's come here to find trouble.\"</p><br/><p>He Cheng Han looked at Lin Fan in astonishment and said, \"Why do you say that?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan calmly replied, \"You see that man next to her? That is the celebrity, Jin Yang. I just dealt with him just now, had him stripped of his clothes. I think that woman was asked to come here by him.\"</p><br/><p>He Cheng Han looked at Lin Fan in shock and replied, \"Amazing, however, you do not need to worry. We are here for you and we will not let them harm you. She may be a powerful woman but we are not scared of her. If there's any trouble later, I'll deal with it.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled and said, \"There's no need for such trouble.\"</p><br/><p>He Cheng Han waved him off and said, \"No, I'll settle this. The lady's name is Zhang Hui. She is not a simple lady and she has a lot of connections, definitely not easy to deal with.\"</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, when Jin Yang saw Lin Fan, his expression turned to one of anger and he wished that he could just get rid of this b*stard. Then, he said, \"Sister Zhang, that's the guy.\"</p><br/><p>Sister Zhang looked in front and nodded, replying, \"Mmm.\"</p><br/><p>She stood up for Jin Yang not because she looked up to him but because he was her actor. Especially since the situation was pretty serious, for a big-time actor to have such a scandal, it would definitely cost a huge amount in damages.</p><br/><p>At this point, if she did not handle this situation perfectly, she was determined to not let it go.</p><br/><p>At that moment, there was a group of people standing in front of Lin Fan. Jin Yang looked directly at him could not help groaning, \"Sister Zhang, that's him.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked right at the b*stard and could not help smiling and saying, \"What? Can I help you with something?\"</p><br/><p>Jin Yang could not hold it in anymore. He said, \"Are you people crazy? Do you guys not know what you all did to me?\"</p><br/><p>\"Woah, wasn't it just stripping you naked? Wasn't that it?\" Lin Fan calmly replied.\"</p><br/><p>All of a sudden, a slap came from the side.</p><br/><p>The one who initiated it was Zhang Hui, She was standing there and without saying a word, she had lifted up her hand and was trying to slap Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was shocked and then immediately grabbed her wrist.</p><br/><p>Zhang Hui said, \"Young man, up till now, do you still refuse to admit that you're in the wrong?\"</p><br/><p>\"Were you trying to hit me?\" Lin Fan looked at Zhang Hui. He looked very composed as he replied.</p><br/><p>Zhang Hui glared at Lin Fan and said, \"Let go of me. You young people don't understand the complexity of situations like this.\"</p><br/><p>He Cheng Han finally reacted and rushed to say, \"Sister Zhang, this is\u2026\"</p><br/><p>*Pa!*</p><br/><p>He Cheng Han had yet to finish his sentence when Lin Fan immediately lifted his hand and slapped Zhang Hui in the face.</p><br/><p>At that moment, it was just complete silence, as if everyone was completely stunned.</p><br/><p>Jin Yang looked on with a stunned expression. He had not thought that this young man would dare to hit back. Also, the bodyguards behind Zhang Hui were all dumbfounded and wanted to tackle Lin Fan to the ground.</p><br/><p>\"Do be rash,\" He Cheng Han shouted, trying to get everyone to stop.</p><br/><p>\"You have the nerve to hit me?\" Sister Zhang's eyes were filled with rage.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan giggled and replied, \"You wanted to hit me, so why shouldn't I be able to hit you?\"</p><br/><p>He Cheng Han had not thought that Lin Fan had meant it when he had said he was going to take action. Without giving anyone any time to react, this Zhang Hui had started to take action and he had been stunned by that. He had not expected that Lin Fan's reflex was that quick, to be able to grab her wrist and then strike back.</p><br/><p>\"What are you guys still looking at? Do something!\" Sister Zhang ordered her bodyguards, \"Beat him to death. Anything that happens, I'll take responsibility.\"</p><br/><p>He Cheng Han saw this whole situation and panicked. \"Sister Zhang, can we just talk this out?\"</p><br/><p>\"You\u2026\" Zhang Hui was prepared to give the guy a huge scolding but after she saw He Cheng Han, she felt that this person looked familiar and said, \"You must be He Cheng Han from Xin Cheng Toys.\"</p><br/><p>He Cheng Han nodded and said, \"Correct, it is me. Sister Zhang, please give me some face. He is my friend, so please don't make a big fuss out of this.\"</p><br/><p>Zhang Hui's face immediately turned black and she said, \"So what you're saying is that it is okay for your friend to hit me? If I want to make a big deal out of this, I will. I, Zhang Hui have worked for so many years and I've never been afraid of anyone.\"</p><br/><p>He Cheng Han rushed to say, \"Sister Zhang, I don't mean it like that. He is my friend, so I'm hoping that you'll give me some face.\"</p><br/><p>\"Face? Your face isn't even worth any money.\" Zhang Hui was really mad now. She had not expected to get slapped. To her, her own reputation was more important.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \"Chief He, don't worry about this. I can handle it myself.\"</p><br/><p>He Cheng Han waved him off and said to him, \"Master, I don't need you to worry about this. If I don't settle this properly, I'll be scolded to death by the rest.\"</p><br/><p>To He Cheng Han, although this situation was very serious, he did not want to back down. He knew that, through this situation, he could get closer to Master Lin. Also, disregarding his relationship with Master Lin, he knew that if he backed down, he would be a joke.</p><br/><p>\"Okay, Zhang Hui, if you want to play, I'll play with you. I actually wanted to see what abilities you have. If you can't even move me then you have no right to do anything,\" He Cheng Han said as his aggression was leaking out. His previously polite and kind attitude had taken a drastic turn.</p><br/><p>Zhang Hui looked at He Cheng Han and said, \"You want to protect him?\"</p><br/><p>He Cheng Han said, \"Yes. If you think about the odds right now, you should probably end this here. If not, if you wish to keep going on, I'm not afraid of you.\"</p><br/><p>Jin Yang was standing at the side and said, \"Sister Zhang, these people are really too arrogant.\"</p><br/><p>\"Okay.\" Zhang Hui looked at He Cheng Han as well as the calm and composed Lin Fan before saying, \"You guys have guts. I want to see how you guys plan to match me.\"</p><br/><p>At this moment, Zhang Hui took out her phone and made a call. \"Brother, I am at Nanshan Children's Welfare Institute. Bring back up. I have a small problem here. Yes\u2026 You'll know when you get here.\"</p><br/><p>After putting down the phone, Zhang Hui looked at He Cheng Han and said, \"Chief He, you're very unyielding. If I, Zhang Hui, cannot convince you, then I am a disgrace.\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

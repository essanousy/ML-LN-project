It was like an intense battle.</p><br/><p>This was their first time meeting Brother Lin\u2019s parents. Naturally, they had to put on a good appearance.</p><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue, in particular, wanted to leave a good impression on Brother Lin\u2019s parents\u2019 hearts.</p><br/><p>Because of work, she had very little free time.</p><br/><p>Mama Lin was now very happy. She had taken a lot of photos with the two of them. She became more pleased the more she looked at the two of them. But what gave her a headache was wondering who exactly her son liked.</p><br/><p>At the Children\u2019s Welfare Institute.</p><br/><p>\u201cDad, this is the Welfare Institute that I\u2019ve taken over. There are a total of 365 children inside,\u201d introduced Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>\u201cDirector Huang, these are my parents.\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Huang was going to spend her New Year at the Welfare Institute as well. Meanwhile, Han Lu had gone back to his old home.</p><br/><p>Director Huang was all smiles. \u201cWelcome, welcome.\u201d</p><br/><p>Papa Lin looked at all those smiling children and felt very gratified. He patted Lin Fan on the shoulder. \u201cSon, your Dad is proud of you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled, \u201cIt\u2019s thanks to your education, Dad.\u201d</p><br/><p>Boot-licking.</p><br/><p>Papa Lin beamed delightedly. \u201cRight, right, it\u2019s thanks to my education. Since young, I\u2019ve taught you to be kind to others. You\u2019ve done well. If you\u2019re too busy, your Mom and I can come down to help.\u201d</p><br/><p>How could he let his parents come? If his parents were to come, the sky would be overturned.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need, we have enough people here already,\u201d said Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Mama Lin said, \u201cHow thick is your skin? Was our son even educated by you? It was thanks to my education.\u201d</p><br/><p>Papa Lin responded, \u201cRight, right. It\u2019s all thanks to your education. I was just supporting you, okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s more like it.\u201d</p><br/><p>The children saw that many people had come and were very happy. Every one of the children liked Lin Fan exceptionally.</p><br/><p>And Lil\u2019 Fatty\u2019s mouth was very sweet.</p><br/><p>He greeted Lin Fan\u2019s parents as Grandpa and Grandma, making Lin Fan so happy that he felt like he was soaring.</p><br/><p>Initially, Lin Fan\u2019s parents had had some negative opinions about him taking over the Children\u2019s Welfare Institute. They had felt that he would be to busy and the stress would be too great.</p><br/><p>But when they reached the place, they realized that these children were indeed very pitiful but also very adorable. For their son to be able to do such a good deed, they felt very proud.</p><br/><p>After visiting the Children\u2019s Welfare Institute, they went to the Oriental Pearl Tower.</p><br/><p>To Lin Fan, that kind of place made him want to puke as soon as he saw it.</p><br/><p>But his parents hadn\u2019t seen this place before, so naturally, he had to bring them to go look around.</p><br/><p>At night time.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was driving Wu Huan Yue to the airport.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Lin, Uncle and Auntie are really good people,\u201d said Wu Huan Yue with a big smile.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded, \u201cMmm, my parents are very good people.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh right, how many days will you be going home for?\u201d</p><br/><p>When Wu Huan Yue thought about the number of days that she would be at home, her whole body slouched back onto the chair as if her energy was drained. \u201cIt won\u2019t even be a few days. Once the New Year celebrations are over, I\u2019ll have to come back immediately.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you want to rest for a few more days, I\u2019ll help you talk to Wang Ming Yang and tell him to push back whatever activities he can,\u201d said Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue shook her head, \u201cSince I\u2019ve already embarked on this path, I have to go forward bravely. Even if it\u2019s even more tiring, I won\u2019t be afraid.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled, \u201cMmm, not bad. I believe that you can become a big star singer.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue smiled brilliantly. Then, she plucked up her courage and said, \u201cBrother Lin, can I ask you something?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat requirements do you have for a spouse?\u201d asked Wu You Lan timidly. It seemed that she wasn\u2019t too confident.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan felt apprehensive. He knew what Wu Huan Yue meant by that. Then, he smiled, \u201cRequirements? Actually, I don\u2019t have any. As long as I think she\u2019s fit for me, it\u2019s fine. But I don\u2019t have any thoughts for now. I\u2019ll wait until I\u2019m more mature before I think about all these things.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Wu Huan Yue was surprised. \u201cBrother Lin, I feel that you\u2019re already very mature.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled and didn\u2019t let himself be tangled up in this matter any further. \u201cWhen you go back, take care of your safety. When you get off the plane, give me a call.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing these words of concern, Wu Huan Yue felt very happy. \u201cMmm, got it.\u201d</p><br/><p>After sending Wu Huan Yue to the airport and watching her enter the airport, Lin Fan drove off.</p><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue stood there, thinking back about what had happened in the past six months. It was like a dream.</p><br/><p>She felt that it had been a great change.</p><br/><p>Somehow, she had become a famous singer all of a sudden and she had met the person that she liked.</p><br/><p>However, her revolution had not succeeded yet and it made her very troubled.</p><br/><p>Initially, she had thought that if she relied on her personal traits and acted a little more spontaneously, it wouldn\u2019t be a problem.</p><br/><p>But now, she realized that things were not she had expected to be.</p><br/><p>It was very stressful.</p><br/><p>Then, she didn\u2019t think too much about it. She put on her cap, lowered her head and walking further into the airport.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>At night.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan let his parents stay at his place. Although it wasn\u2019t a great house, at least he had a place for them to stay.</p><br/><p>After bathing, he was about to go and rest. However, his Mom was sitting on the sofa.</p><br/><p>\u201cSon, come here for a moment.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cMom, what is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Mama Lin asked, \u201cLet Mom ask you, who do you like between Huan Yue and You Lan?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh? Why are you asking this?\u201d Lin Fan laughed awkwardly.</p><br/><p>Mama Lin said, \u201cYou\u2019re my son. How could I not ask? These two young ladies are both pretty good people. Mom doesn\u2019t want you to hurt them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan scratched his head. \u201cThis\u2026Mom, can we not talk about this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Can\u2019t you tell your Mom about your feelings?\u201d said Mama Lin.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s just that I really don\u2019t know either. Even if you ask me, I don\u2019t know how to reply.\u201d Lin Fan really didn\u2019t know what to say.</p><br/><p>Regarding this question, he thought about it frequently but he felt that it was too complicated. Just thinking about it gave him a headache.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Papa Lin helped his son out of this situation. \u201cWhy do you keep asking our son about all this? Our son has his own thoughts and his own world. We\u2019re just here to visit and take a look. I think both of those young ladies are pretty good. Don\u2019t give our son too much pressure.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mama Lin looked at Papa Lin. \u201cDo you think I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re thinking?\u201d</p><br/><p>Papa Lin gave an innocent look. \u201cWhat does this have to do with me? I\u2019m just saying this on behalf of our son. Don\u2019t we want to have a grandchild to hug?\u201d</p><br/><p>Mama Lin glared at him. \u201cHug? All you know is hugging. If something happens, let\u2019s see what you\u2019ll be hugging.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was embarrassed. In this family, his Mom was the big shot. When she started scolding someone, his Dad wouldn\u2019t dare to say a word of nonsense.</p><br/><p>\u201cOur son is here, give me some face,\u201d said Papa Lin softly.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan didn\u2019t want to be involved in all this. He waved his hand and said, \u201cDad, Mom, I\u2019m going to sleep. If you have anything to talk about, you can carry on yourselves. I\u2019m going to sleep.\u201d</p><br/><p>Before his Mom could say anything, he closed the door and went to sleep.</p><br/><p>In a certain villa.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang and Xu Zi Le just had some intimate time. At this moment, Wang Ming Yang was leaning back on the bed and smoking a cigarette.</p><br/><p>Xu Zi Le was lying in Wang Ming Yang\u2019s embrace. \u201cWhat are you thinking about?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang replied, \u201cIt\u2019s nothing much. I\u2019m just thinking about how my brother\u2019s relationship situation should be resolved.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up with Brother Lin?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not what\u2019s up with him but the problem is huge. Other people may not see it but I can see it. His heart is troubled. In fact, it\u2019s very troubled. He can\u2019t decide between Wu Huan Yue and Wu You Lan. It seems that I have to help him out.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xu Zi Le rolled her eyes. \u201cYou men are always so greedy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t say that. You can only blame my brother for being too outstanding and meeting too many good girls.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xu Zi Le said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just be together with Brother Lin then.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang said helplessly, \u201cI want to as well. If I was a girl, I would have gone for him long ago. But I\u2019m a guy so it can\u2019t be helped.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat other solutions do you have then? You want the three of them to be together peacefully? You must be dreaming,\u201d said Xu Zi Le.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m thinking of another plan now, aren\u2019t I? As for this dream, sometimes, when you do the impossible, it might just happen. You have to see how it turns out. Forget it, let\u2019s not think about it for now. I\u2019ll wait till the new year celebrations are over before thinking about it. Hehe,\u201d Wang Ming Yang said. Then, he looked at Xu Zi Le and let out a cunning smile.</p><br/><p>Xu Zi Le rolled her eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re a sweetheart.\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

Lil\u2019 Bao, greet Uncle Lin.\u201d Elder Zheng picked his grandson up from his wheelchair as he grinned cheerily.</p><br/><p>\u201cUncle Lin,\u201d Lil\u2019 Bao blinked a few times before greeting him innocently.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled as he touched Lil\u2019 Bao\u2019s head. \u201cGood boy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cXiu Fang, Master Lin is around today so you have to prepare some good dishes,\u201d said Elder Zheng with a smile. He was in a good mood today. He had gotten what he wanted. That painting really made him very satisfied. Compared to Yue Qiu Ju Shi and Tao Shi Gang\u2019s paintings, it was definitely much better.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, alright.\u201d Elder Zheng\u2019s wife smiled. There were very few young people who could impress her husband. And there was probably no other youngster whom he would invite to stay for a meal.</p><br/><p>Hence, even if she didn\u2019t understand what was so special about this young man, she liked him very much because he made Elder Zheng happy.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved his hand and said, \u201cElder Zheng, no need to trouble yourselves. I won\u2019t be having a meal here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat trouble would it be? Just having a meal is no trouble at all. The two of us can have a nice chat. Later on, we\u2019ll give them a call as well. We need to get them to send you the Association\u2019s certificate,\u201d said Elder Zheng with a smile.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan decided not to say too much. He nodded and said, \u201cAlright then, I shan\u2019t be too courteous.\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Zheng instantly laughed, \u201cThat\u2019s more like it.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Elder Zheng\u2019s wife heard this, she immediately got to work. She left Lil\u2019 Bao to Elder Zheng\u2019s care.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan kept observing Lil\u2019 Bao\u2019s leg. One of his legs had a bend between the thigh and the calf. It was similar to someone with \u2018pigeon-toes\u2019. However, it was much more severe. It affected his walking. His other leg, however, was perfectly normal.</p><br/><p>Elder Zheng noticed that Lin Fan kept looking at his grandson\u2019s leg, so he said, \u201cSigh, this kid has been like this since birth. Now the doctors are saying that his inner-nerves have been damaged. As for the complete explanation, I don\u2019t remember too clearly but with the current medical standards, the chance of recovering from this is quite small.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded. This kind of situation had gone on for so many years. With Elder Zheng\u2019s power, he probably had already looked for the world\u2019s best doctors. But for his grandson to still be like this, it must have been because there was no way to treat it. Otherwise, this problem wouldn\u2019t have dragged on for so long.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Zheng, allow me to feel his leg for a moment,\u201d said Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d Elder Zheng didn\u2019t think too much of it. This kind of situation was common. For example, when Yue Qiu Ju Shi and Tao Shi Gang came to visit his place, they had similar requests as well.</p><br/><p>It was a pain for this child.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan touched Lil\u2019 Bao\u2019s leg and the area around his knee joint. An idea gradually formed in his mind. Then, he casually said, \u201cElder Zheng, I\u2019m going to buy something with Lil\u2019 Wang. I\u2019ll be back in a bit.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut what? You can just send Lil\u2019 Wang to buy it,\u201d said Elder Zheng with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need. He wouldn\u2019t know. Only I know about it.\u201d Lin Fan waved his hand. It was better not to say too much.</p><br/><p>After all, saying too much wouldn\u2019t do any good. It would even cause an ill-feeling in Elder Zheng\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>He had seen the world\u2019s best doctors and still couldn\u2019t treat him. What could this young man possibly do? Hence, it was best to stay subtle about it.</p><br/><p>Lil Wang had been on standby in the residence the whole time. When Lin Fan said he wanted to buy something, he drove the car over.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Lin, don\u2019t come back too late. Don\u2019t take too long,\u201d urged Elder Zheng.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded, \u201cAlright. I\u2019ll be quick.\u201d</p><br/><p>In the car.</p><br/><p>Lil\u2019 Wang asked, \u201cMaster Lin, where do you want to go?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled and replied, \u201cGo to the nearest Chinese medical hall.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lil\u2019 Wang nodded without asking much. He immediately started the car and drove off. Although Master Lin was young, he was highly regarded by Elder Zheng. Hence, his attitude towards Master Lin was one of respect. He wouldn\u2019t underestimate him because of his age. If he did that and it got discovered by Elder Zheng, Elder Zheng would be extremely disappointed in him.</p><br/><p>\u201cOld man, where\u2019s that Lil\u2019 Lin?\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Zheng said, \u201cHe went with Lil\u2019 Wang to go and buy something. He\u2019ll be back soon. I have to go contact Elder Tao and the rest. You do your work first.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>At the urban district.</p><br/><p>Lil\u2019 Wang stopped his car. \u201cMaster Lin, that\u2019s the shop. The one in front.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded, \u201cAlright, wait for me for a while. I\u2019ll be back very soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo problem. Take your time, Master Lin. As long as we go back before lunch, it\u2019s fine.\u201d said Lil\u2019 Wang.</p><br/><p>When he saw Master Lin enter the shop, Lil\u2019 Wang started to think. He wondered what Master Lin wanted to do in a Chinese medical hall. But after thinking for a long while, he still couldn\u2019t think of any reasons.</p><br/><p>In the Chinese medical hall.</p><br/><p>Lin fan looked at the things at the counter. In his mind, he was thinking about Lil\u2019 Bao\u2019s condition.</p><br/><p>This kind of condition was a little complicated. Of course, it was only complicated if he didn\u2019t have the Encyclopedia\u2019s mystical boost. But with the mystical powers, it was not a problem at all.</p><br/><p>It was just that the procedures required were a little bit complicated.</p><br/><p>\u201cBoss, please get me these,\u201d said Lin Fan after thinking it through.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Soon after.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan exited the shop. There was nothing in his hands. When he entered the car, Lil\u2019 Wang gazed at Master Lin, not knowing what he had bought.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, did you not manage to get what you needed? We can go somewhere else to look,\u201d said Lil\u2019 Wang warmly.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved his hand and smiled. \u201cNo need. I\u2019ve already bought it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lil\u2019 Wang took once more surprised glance at Lin Fan. If he had bought it already, then where was it? But after thinking for a while, he thought it was better not to think too much about this.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan naturally couldn\u2019t hold the item in his hands. He had hidden it inside his clothes pocket so that it wouldn\u2019t be discovered. If it was to be discovered, it would be troublesome.</p><br/><p>To Lin Fan, helping to treat illnesses felt pretty good.</p><br/><p>He thought to himself that when he went back, he had to work hard to complete the task.</p><br/><p>He had been stuck at this task for some time now. If he still didn\u2019t complete it, he would become useless soon.</p><br/><p>At Noon!</p><br/><p>Lunchtime.</p><br/><p>Tao Shi Gang, Yue Qiu Ju Shi and a few other masters had gathered over there. When they had arrived early and had nothing to do, Elder Zheng purposely brought them over to his study room to look at the newly-made painting by Lin Fan. He was clearly showing it off.</p><br/><p>When Tai Shi Gang and Yue Qiu Ju Shi saw this large painting, they were astounded. It was a painting that comprised of mountain streams, flowers, birds, and people.</p><br/><p>They didn\u2019t even have something like this and they never expected Elder Zheng to obtain it. How could they not have been jealous?</p><br/><p>Then, Lin Fan noticed that everyone looked at him in a slightly different light now.</p><br/><p>During the meal, everyone chatted very cheerily.</p><br/><p>But on that day, it seemed that Elder Zheng\u2019s alcohol tolerance was very low. He only drank just a little. Clearly, it was because he was in his own home and it was only noon, so he exercised some restraint.</p><br/><p>After Lil\u2019 Bao had been fed, he was carried upstairs to sleep.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan saw that it was about time. He got up and used the excuse of going to the toilet to go upstairs.</p><br/><p>It was roughly twenty minutes before he came back downstairs. However, he didn\u2019t draw any attention. Meanwhile, Elder Zheng\u2019s wife was in the kitchen preparing dishes as well so she didn\u2019t notice.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>After the meal.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Zheng, we\u2019ll be leaving first,\u201d said Lin Fan with a smile.</p><br/><p>Elder Zheng replied cheerfully, \u201cAlright. Elder Lin, the next time you\u2019re in Beijing, be sure to give me a call.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded with a smile. This Elder Zheng was very hospitable. Although they had only known each other for a while, their relationship felt close.</p><br/><p>Everyone left the place.</p><br/><p>Elder Zheng sat on the sofa and couldn\u2019t help but laugh, \u201cWife, today has been a happy day.\u201d</p><br/><p>The wife tidied up the dining table. She said with a smile, \u201cIt\u2019s good that you\u2019re happy\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGrandpa, Grandma\u2026I want to pee.\u201d At that moment, a series of voices came from upstairs.</p><br/><p>\u201cLil\u2019 Bao, Grandpa is coming,\u201d replied Elder Zheng.</p><br/><p>But at that moment.</p><br/><p>Elder Zheng, who had already stood up, took one more look in front and was completely stunned.</p><br/><p>\u201cGrandpa, Lil\u2019 Bao wants to pee,\u201d yelled Lil\u2019 Bao in a daze.</p><br/><p>The wife said, \u201cOld man, what are you standing there for? Hurry up and\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly.</p><br/><p>Xiu Fang\u2019s hands stopped moving. Her gaze fell on that little silhouette by the staircase. The bowls and chopsticks in her hands fell onto the ground.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

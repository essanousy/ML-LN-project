His Encyclopedic Points were at 8500, exceeding his target by a long shot. However, the Encyclopedic Points were increasing at a very slow rate. He was scared that he was already reached a certain level where what he could learn he had already learned and what he had not, he had no way of learning. Unless he were to start his own research and properly study it. But it was still not certain that he would be able to gain a new wave of Encyclopedic Points.</p><br/><p>However, this was not the time to be thinking about this kind of things. It was time to go to the Nan Shan Children\u2019s Welfare Institute and let the children try out the perfect quality Little Intelligence Pill.</p><br/><p>After using this Little Intelligence Pill, what would be too difficult to learn?</p><br/><p>He was afraid that the intelligence gained would be something the average person could compare to.</p><br/><p>To call them geniuses would be an understatement. However, after all of this, he would have to personally teach them new information.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey!\u201d Lin Fan exclaimed in surprise. When he reached the Nan Shan Children\u2019s Welfare Institute, he saw Zhao Ming Qing\u2019s car parked out and his driver was resting in the car.</p><br/><p>Could it be that Zhao Ming Qing was here at the Children\u2019s Welfare Institute also?</p><br/><p>When he went inside, Zhao Ming Qing was really inside.</p><br/><p>\u201cMing Qing, what are you doing?\u201d Lin Fan opened his mouth and asked.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing was giving the children body check-ups and then when he saw some arrive, he stopped what he was doing. He said, \u201cTeacher, I am here to give the children a body check-up. The weather nowadays has turned cold, it\u2019s very easy to fall sick.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow kind of you,\u201d Lin Fan smiled and said, \u201cHow have you been recently? Has there been any change in the situation?\u201d</p><br/><p>When he said this, Zhao Ming Qing could not help sighing and he said, \u201cTeacher, the Little Intelligence Pill is is not normal. As time passes, I can feel an increase in this mysterious feeling.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded. That was how the Little Intelligence Pill was. After using it, using your brain nonstop can increase the processing power of your brain and you will become a genius. It was not a difficult thing to do.</p><br/><p>However, the prerequisite was that you had to take the initiative to study. If you just sit back and wait for results, then there won\u2019t be any benefits.</p><br/><p>When Zhao Ming Qing saw the pouch in his teacher\u2019s hand, he could not help being curious and asking, \u201cTeacher, what is in your pouch?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled and then opened up the pouch. Zhong Ming Qing looked inside and was dumbfounded. His tone started to become shocked as he said, \u201cTeacher, this\u2026 this\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He was a little dumbfounded. He recognized what was in the bag. It was the Little Intelligence Pill. Also, by the looks of it, it was the perfected quality one his master was talking about.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Zhong Ming Qing had a realization. He said, \u201cTeacher, you are thinking of letting these children use the Little Intelligence Pill, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded and said, \u201cYou guessed right. I want to let these children use the Little Intelligence Pill. You see, these children are very pitiful. Although they are just like other children, from birth, they were just lacking the other children but that little bit. I\u2019m afraid that when they grow old, they will not be able to enjoy a peaceful family. That is why I want to let their brains become better and make them smarter. They may not have a prosperous and comforting family so I will let them use their own brains and make their own perfect future.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing stared at this teacher. He was not in objection of this teacher giving this precious thing to the children to use but was rather surprised that his teacher\u2019s heart was in such a place.</p><br/><p>If this pill were to come into the hands of anyone else, he was scared that they would not give it to the children to use. Even if it were him, he was not sure if he would bear to give this precious medicine to the children.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cWhat\u2019s up? Is there a problem?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhong Ming Qing shook his head and said, \u201cNo problem. It\u2019s just that I really admire you, teacher.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved him off and said, \u201cEnough, no need to compliment me. You said you\u2019re a different generation, why are you acting like all the youngsters?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing laughed and said, \u201cTeacher, I am young at heart. My young heart doesn\u2019t change with age. If I was still in my young state, teacher, you would be so scared that you would chase me away and end my apprenticeship.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shook his head and laughed. He said, \u201cLooks like you were still too much even when you were young. Okay, go inform the children. Don\u2019t tell anyone else about this incident. Only you and I will know about it and that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYea.\u201d</p><br/><p>After awhile.</p><br/><p>Han Lu and Director Huang came.</p><br/><p>Han Lu curiously asked, \u201cMaster Lin, what is that in your pouch?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled but with a lot of secrecy, said, \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing and will benefit the children a lot. However, I can\u2019t tell you what it is.\u201d</p><br/><p>Han Lu was still very curious. But since Master Lin was not willing to say it, he naturally did not ask further. In the period of time he was here at Nan Shan Children\u2019s Welfare Institute, he felt like his thoughts had been raised to another level, a sort of feeling that he did not get anywhere else before.</p><br/><p>Calmness, gentleness and being able to experience the world with his heart. It was not like the ambitious and aggressive person he was before.</p><br/><p>For this change, he owed it all to Master Lin. If it was not for Master Lin, he would not have come here.</p><br/><p>The children all came out.</p><br/><p>\u201cWow, Uncle Lin has brought us some good treats.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cQueue up properly, don\u2019t fight over it,\u201d Lil Fatty said with clear enunciation. Lil Fatty had evidently become one of the big figures here.</p><br/><p>The children also evidently listened to Lil Fatty. They all queued up and then their curious eyes were all locked on to the pouch in Lin Fan\u2019s hands. They were all very curious, wondering what treat was inside.</p><br/><p>Lil Fatty wiped away his mucus and then carefully looked at them and said, \u201cLittle Hui, you should let your little sister stand in front.\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Hui wanted to be the first to try the treat so when they were all queuing, he snuck his way to the front. He did not expect to get noticed by Lil Fatty.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have to remember. Let the girls go first next time,\u201d Lil Fatty said, as he instructed the whole group of them.</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan and the rest of them saw this, they could not help laughing. This Lil Fatty was really very capable.</p><br/><p>However, at this moment, Lil Fatty stood in front of the queue, forgetting what he said about letting the ladies go first. He opened his hands and his waited eagerly in anticipation.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cLil Fatty, isn\u2019t it ladies first? Why are you standing in front?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lil Fatty laughed and said, \u201cI\u2019m their elder. Elders should go first.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan flicked his head gently and said, \u201cYou can\u2019t just use your rights like this. You\u2019ve eaten this before. Just stand aside and help to maintain the order of the queue.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lil Fatty sighed and said, \u201cWhat a pity\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shook his head and laughed. This Lil Fatty was very amusing. After this, he started to give out the perfect quality Little Intelligence Pill.</p><br/><p>When Director Huang and the rest of them saw the golden pill, they were all astonished, not knowing what it was. However, when the children saw it, they were all drawn in by the bright gold and dazzling gleam of the pill.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan wanted to personally see the children ingest the pill before letting them go.</p><br/><p>If there was a single child who did not use the pill, then his mission was not accomplished. After today, if he wanted to check who did not use the pill, it would be extremely hard.</p><br/><p>After all, this Little Intelligence Pill was not something that would work in a short period of time.</p><br/><p>The children were still very young and their brains were all developing. As long as they used the Little Intelligence Pill, worked hard in pursuing new knowledge and keeping their brains active, the results would be beyond imagination.</p><br/><p>After an hour of hard work.</p><br/><p>All of the children had taken the Little Intelligence Pill.</p><br/><p>At this moment, the notification sound from the encyclopedia finally came.</p><br/><p>Mission accomplished.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan had a huge smile on his face.</p></div>\n</div>"}

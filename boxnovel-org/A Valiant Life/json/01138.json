However, he was also thinking about something. He was making plans for the welfare institute\u2019s future.</p><br/><p>He was planning to continue introducing some things to the welfare institute but he hadn\u2019t decided what to introduce yet. Then, he stopped thinking too much. He would leave it as it was for now and only start implementing his ideas when they came.</p><br/><p>A few days later.</p><br/><p>The situation on the Internet did not die down just because Lin Fan had stopped saying anything. Instead, it became more and more intense. This caused Lin Fan to be dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>Even some of the big shots involved in artificial limbs had spoken out.</p><br/><p>\u201cPerhaps an outsider like Master Lin wouldn\u2019t understand how much knowledge is encompassed in a small artificial limb and how much efforts have been poured into the discovery of each bit of knowledge. Hence, to someone who doesn\u2019t understand, this will always be so simple,\u201d a certain high-status artificial limb specialist said.</p><br/><p>Although he hadn\u2019t scolded Lin Fan, there was disdain in his words.</p><br/><p>Following that, many people backed him up as well and started injecting their criticism into this matter.</p><br/><p>Even some people from different industries spoke out.</p><br/><p>Former leukemia specialists criticized Lin Fan as well, stating a big bunch of reasons.</p><br/><p>When the netizens saw this situation, they were amused</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, I\u2019m dying of laughter. These leukemia specialists also came out to scold Master Lin. I think Master Lin has many enemies and few allies this time. A few days have passed and the topic hasn\u2019t died down at all. Instead, people have been using it to flame him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can understand the artificial limb specialists coming out to criticize Master Lin but what are these leukemia specialists doing? Master Lin didn\u2019t offend them, did he?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t. But this hatred has a deep story. Let me tell you about it. Ever since Master Lin conquered leukemia, these people have hated him so much that they probably want to swallow him whole.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn. I get it now. So that\u2019s why. But they can\u2019t blame Master Lin for that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t they? Do you know how many people have lost their jobs because of Master Lin? The things he did were really despicable.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe. ^I think you must be a moron. Losing their jobs means that they won\u2019t have money to earn. But those people who were sick didn\u2019t just have to give up their money, they even had to endure suffering and some of them might even lose their lives. That\u2019s why I support what Master Lin has done.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI support him too. If they lost their jobs, they can just find new ones. Times are changing and nothing lasts forever. This disease has already been cured. Are we supposed to pretend that it hasn\u2019t been cured just in consideration of these people?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI just can\u2019t f*cking get through to you idiots. Let me tell you that Master Lin has caused harm to many people and made many people lose their jobs.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone, don\u2019t talk to the person above. I didn\u2019t close the fence of my pigsty and he managed to escape.\u201d</p><br/><p>The discussion on the Internet broke out into an argument once again. It was all because of the artificial limb matter that Master Lin had talked about.</p><br/><p>They were all waiting but Master Lin had disappeared without a trace. He didn\u2019t reply to any comments on the Internet. This left the netizens at a loss.</p><br/><p>Even if they trusted Master Lin, Master Lin didn\u2019t appear.</p><br/><p>But if they didn\u2019t trust Master Lin, they would be afraid of getting slapped in the face in the future. Hence, in the end, most people maintained their silence and decided to just let these specialists and professors talk for now.</p><br/><p>However, they definitely couldn\u2019t just sit and watch their idol get flamed. They still had to scold those who deserved to be scolded.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, there was the Chief of Internet Trolls here. Following his rhythm, they were more steady.</p><br/><p>Autumn Sword Fish Killer was very troubled right now. Sitting in front of the computer, his door was closed. His eyes were filled with melancholy. Looking at the flame war on the Internet, he felt a little powerless.</p><br/><p>If it was in the past, he would have been able to educate these arrogant people with his phantom butterfly hands.</p><br/><p>But now, he couldn\u2019t anymore. A few days ago, he had been masturbating. And because he had gone too fast, his fingertip got injured and it affected his typing speed.</p><br/><p>In an instant, his mind lit up as he thought of an idea. He immediately opened a group chat.</p><br/><p>This was the group that he had infiltrated. The people inside were all of Master Lin\u2019s enemies. In particular, Ying Jin was inside.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe time has come. Something big needs to be done.\u201d</p><br/><p>When he sent that message, the people inside sprang into life. During this time, the people inside had come to respect Autumn Sword Fish Killer very much. It was as if they had found a leader.</p><br/><p>Ying Jin was the first to respond. \u201cChief, what is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Pharmaceutical company: \u201cAre we going to resume the war?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRecently, this Lin has had tough luck. We must add fuel to the fire.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Chief of Internet Trolls\u2019 fingers rained on the keyboard. \u201cTonight\u2019s task is to go to that Lin\u2019s Weibo and completely suppress those haters.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the meaning of this? We\u2019re going to help that Lin? Chief, you must be mistaken.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief of Internet Trolls: \u201cWhat do you know? This is called changing our perspective. Right now, there are already enough people scolding him. It would be useless even if we join in now. That\u2019s why we\u2019re going to stand on Lin\u2019s side and scold those haters to draw an even larger conflict. Think about it. How could he possibly develop artificial limbs? We\u2019ll wait until that day when this matter completely blows up. Wouldn\u2019t that create an even greater impact?\u201d</p><br/><p>The group was silent for a moment. But soon after, the messages started flying in.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn. That\u2019s awesome. Chief is the Chief for a reason. I didn\u2019t even think about that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha. We\u2019ll cause the flame war to get even bigger and enrage those haters. In the end, when that Lin fails to develop the prosthetic limbs, he\u2019ll be slapped in the face!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ying Jin: \u201cSigh. You\u2019re the Chief after all. Why didn\u2019t we meet you earlier? If we met you earlier, we wouldn\u2019t have turned out like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Autumn Sword Fish Killer laughed calmly. His fat face jiggled and he let out an immensely confident smirk as he typed a few words.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust a small idea.\u201d</p><br/><p>Regarding this matter, this was all he could do. He didn\u2019t have enough hands. It was hard to find groups of experienced trolls. But fortunately, there were lots of them here. Moreover, their battle power was very high and he could use them.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll delegate the tasks now. Make sure you don\u2019t mix up your responsibilities. Otherwise, we won\u2019t be able to create as big of an impact.\u201d</p><br/><p>Autumn Sword Fish Killer was very familiar with this line of work. He relied on this to make a living after all. Also, thinking about that $500 reward, his fighting spirit soared.</p><br/><p>At that moment, under the lead of the Chief of Internet Trolls, A.K.A. the Flame War Emperor, a large group of trolls attacked.</p><br/><p>Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was talking to Wang Ming Yang on the phone.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe research lab will be ready soon, by the day after tomorrow latest,\u201d said Wang Ming Yang.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cAlright, hurry up. I\u2019ve been waiting for very long.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang felt very helpless as well. He had seen the situation on the Internet. His Brother was going to defy nature.</p></div>\n</div>"}

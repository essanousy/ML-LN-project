Jin Can almost messed up. I didn\u2019t expect her to finish the song.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck, if she didn\u2019t even sing, it would have been really embarrassing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, that\u2019s weird. I heard someone cheering her on earlier. It sounded like Master Lin\u2019s voice.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s impossible. Why would Master Lin cheer Jin Can on? You must have heard it wrongly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s correct. It was Master Lin.\u201d Zhao Zhong Yang admitted it and the netizens were stunned.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy did he cheer her on?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCan anyone please explain?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand why he would do that. Did he shout wrongly?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI think Master Lin just didn\u2019t want Jin Can to embarrass us. After all, she\u2019s representing our country.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c^ D*mn, that makes sense.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that instant, the broadcasting room went wild. They were discussing Master Lin\u2019s class act.</p><br/><p>In the changing room.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happened earlier? Why were you speechless?\u201d Director Zhang looked a little displeased. He was clearly disappointed.</p><br/><p>He was not even expecting her to win an award. He just wanted her to do better than Wu Huan Yue.</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry, Director Zhang, I was too nervous just now,\u201d Jin Can said. She wanted to tell him that Master Lin had cheered her on earlier, but she decided to remain silent.</p><br/><p>If she were to say that, it might cause other problems.</p><br/><p>However, she felt that Master Lin deserved to be respected. Although she had something against Wu Huan Yue, she should not have anything against him.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the likelihood of her making it to the next round now?\u201d Director Zhang asked Zheng Ya. He felt that it was unlikely for her to make it.</p><br/><p>Zheng Ya replied, \u201cIt\u2019s hard to say. Jin Can did pretty well. If the judges deduct points from her screw up, we will have to let fate decide.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was really difficult to judge, and there were quite a lot of singers. Furthermore, they were all professionals.</p><br/><p>Hence, they had to depend on luck.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm, as long as Wu Huan Yue loses, it doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d Director Zhang said. He just wanted Master Lin to be embarrassed. He was not interested in winning any awards.</p><br/><p>You\u2019re reading on ReadReadNovelFull .com Thanks!</p><br/><p>Jin Can just stood there quietly.</p><br/><p>The competition continued, and the singers were really good. Although Lin Fan did not understand the songs, he could feel the atmosphere. It was something that only beautiful melodies could create.</p><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue was taking deep breaths with her fingers crossed. She seemed a little nervous.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuan Yue, are you nervous?\u201d Lin Fan asked. He knew that it was normal to be nervous. After all, the singers there were professionals.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, a little. I\u2019m trying to fight it.\u201d As it got closer to her turn, she felt even more nervous.</p><br/><p>Initially, she was not that nervous, but as each singer finished their performance, she started to feel the pressure.</p><br/><p><em>knock knock</em></p><br/><p>The staff knocked on the door and spoke in English. Although they did not really understand him, they knew what he meant.</p><br/><p>It was Wu Huan Yue\u2019s turn.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuan Yue, all the best.\u201d Lin Fan patted Wu Huan Yue\u2019s shoulders.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian also wished her luck. \u201cYou can do it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue nodded and took a deep breath before leaving. She was prepared to give it her all.</p><br/><p>In the broadcasting room.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, it\u2019s Wu Huan Yue\u2019s turn.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t wait. I wonder what she will be singing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI just know that the songs were written by Master Lin. I believe in him, and I know it will be great.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s hard to say. Although I believe in Master Lin too, we can only find out after hearing the songs.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Yang, you gotta do your best. You have to make sure we get to see Wu Huan Yue perform.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang replied, \u201cBros, don\u2019t worry. I will definitely do my best.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just donate some presents. It\u2019s difficult for Brother Yang to be broadcasting this for us.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, let\u2019s donate some presents guys.\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly, the broadcasting room was filled with presents.</p><br/><p>Other broadcasters wondered why their viewership rates were so low. They were stunned.</p><br/><p>However, when they saw that Zhao Zhong Yang\u2019s broadcast had a few million fewers, they were shocked. That was impressive.</p><br/><p>When they clicked on it, they just decided to stop their own streams and watch his broadcast instead.</p><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue walked on stage.</p><br/><p>The crowd began chattering a little again. After all, they had already seen an Asian singer earlier.</p><br/><p>Although the previous one had performed well, she had made a small hiccup, and they all remembered it.</p><br/><p>You\u2019re reading on ReadReadNovelFull .com Thanks!</p><br/><p>Hence, they felt that this singer would not be great too.</p><br/><p>The female judge, Abigail, started to discuss with Ralph. They were discussing Wu Huan Yue\u2019s situation.</p><br/><p>They had the information of all the singers in their hands.</p><br/><p>They did not really know much about the industry in China. They had not expected two Chinese singers to be participating in this competition.</p><br/><p>After all, this was the first time.</p><br/><p>Perhaps they felt that these singers were there to see their standards.</p><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue bowed to the four judges and spoke in fluent English. \u201cI am Wu Huan Yue, and I\u2019m from China. I\u2019m going to sing \u2018Because of You\u2019.\u201d</p><br/><p>Abigail realised that she was much more steady than the previous Asian singer. She smiled and signalled for her to begin.</p><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue took a deep breath.</p><br/><p>Then, the music started to play.</p><br/><p>At that instant, the four judges focused their attention on Wu Huan Yue.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

But the atmosphere in the broadcast room was quite lively.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-1\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Naturally, she didn\u2019t want to affect the atmosphere. There were some of her online friends trying to egg her on while some of them were telling her to avoid it.</p><br/><p>Especially when she saw the concrete mixer truck operating with loud rumbling noises, she even became a little afraid.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrothers, I think it\u2019s best if we take a detour,\u201d said Fang Qian with a wide smile at the camera. Then, she went far from the concrete mixer truck to go around it.</p><br/><p>\u201cLook. Even if I didn\u2019t take a detour, nothing would have\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Before she could say \u2018happened\u2019, a thunderous sound rang out as she saw the large concrete drum on the truck suddenly roll down. It landed squarely on the road.</p><br/><p>When the construction workers saw this, they were completely dumbfounded.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-2\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Is everyone alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo one got caught under it, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The construction workers had been scared stupid. The man standing behind the vehicle, in particular, had been so shocked that he was sweating profusely. They didn\u2019t even dare to imagine what would have happened if they had been standing beside the vehicle when the drum had fallen. They would probably have been squashed into a pancake.</p><br/><p>In the distance, Fang Qian was standing there with a look of shock. She hadn\u2019t recovered from her daze yet.</p><br/><p>She just stared at the concrete mixer truck in disbelief. If she had walked past it, how would things have turned out?</p><br/><p>The broadcast room had sunken into a temporary silence.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-3\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>They were watching the broadcast but didn\u2019t know what had happened. When Fang Qian shifted the camera over, all of her fans were completely stunned by the scene.</p><br/><p>Suddenly!</p><br/><p>The broadcast room exploded.</p><br/><p>At the very beginning, Lin Fan had always done fortune-telling at his stall but later on, he had basically stopped doing fortune-telling. Hence, many people didn\u2019t know that Lin Fan knew how to read fortunes. And even if they had found out about Lin Fan\u2019s fortune-telling, they thought that his fortune-telling skills were just average.</p><br/><p>Hence, many people thought that Master Lin only dabbled in fortune-telling and that he was only slightly more trustworthy than those random fortune-tellers that they saw on bridges.</p><br/><p>But now that this had happened, they were completely shocked and they were speechless.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck! Somebody tell me whether this is real or not.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did Master Lin say earlier? He told Qian Qian to avoid the truck. Now\u2026\u201d This fan had been so shocked that he didn\u2019t know what to say. To him, this was way too strange.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t believe in these things and he had never believed that fortune-telling could be used to see through someone\u2019s fate. But now, his mind had been blown. This had gone beyond his expectations and he couldn\u2019t figure out how this had happened.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow you know how great Master Lin is. Let me tell you, I\u2019ve been a fan of Master Lin for a very long time and I know him very well. Although Master Lin can do fortune-telling, not everyone knows about it. This time, Qian Qian was lucky to have bumped into Master Lin and avoided a disaster.\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-4\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Many netizens, when they saw this comment, were surprised as well. That was indeed the case.</p><br/><p>If Qian Qian hadn\u2019t taken a detour and she had passed by that concrete mixer truck instead, when the concrete drum had fallen, the outcome would have been horrifying.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Fang Qian stood there, still not recovered from her daze. Her heart was still filled with thoughts and emotions about what had just happened.</p><br/><p>Thinking about how she hadn\u2019t been bothered at first by what Master Lin had said, she started to feel a sense of fear. If she hadn\u2019t broadcasted her journey home and her online friends hadn\u2019t influenced her, she would probably have gone straight past the concrete mixer truck instead of taking the detour.</p><br/><p>If that had happened, would she still be alive?</p><br/><p>At that moment, Master Lin\u2019s glory instantly grew in her heart\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>At home.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan took out a wooden box from his cabinet. The results of his fishing this time had been pretty good. If he slowly accumulated items, he would definitely be able to gather all the medicinal herbs and ingredients that he needed for his pills.</p><br/><p>He carefully placed the medicinal herbs inside the wooden box, then placed the box back into the cabinet.</p><br/><p>As for that broadcaster from before, he wasn\u2019t too bothered about her. Since they had bumped into each other and she had even spontaneously gone to say hello to him, that clearly meant that she was destined for a change in her fate.</p><br/><p>Since he had seen through it, he had to warn her. After all, this young lady was quite good-looking. He had to take care of her.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-5\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>The next day!</p><br/><p>Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan reached the shop, the number of people queuing for scallion pancakes was already uncountable. Ever since he had received the Michelin 3 Stars, the number of people who came just because of the shop\u2019s reputation was terrifying.</p><br/><p>In the past, before the shop had become so famous, the number of people queuing daily had probably been several hundred. But now, it was nowhere near as small a number. During the holidays, the number was even scarier.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian always sat at the entrance, looking at the situation and sighing. To him, these people were all moving dollar bills. But that kid just wouldn\u2019t be moved at all, so they continued selling ten servings a day. Fraud Tian had almost been frustrated to death.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Lin, you saved someone again yesterday?\u201d Wu You Lan came to Lin Fan\u2019s side and asked as she looked at the news on her phone.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Lin Fan was taken aback. Then, he realized it. He had indeed given that broadcaster a piece of advice. It couldn\u2019t have appeared on the news, could it?</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan saw that Brother Lin was a little curious, so she handed him her phone.</p><br/><p>As Lin Fan looked at the contents on her phone, he had a surprised look on his face. He hadn\u2019t expected that such a small incident would appear on the news.</p><br/><p>But he hadn\u2019t considered that that Fang Qian from yesterday was not just a small broadcaster. She had hundreds of thousands of fans. Moreover, there had been so many people watching yesterday\u2019s broadcast. It was practically impossible for the incident not to appear on the news.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-6\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u2018Broadcaster has a chance encounter with Master Lin. After receiving advice, she avoids a disaster.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Master Lin\u2019s fortune-telling ability has reached perfection. It is completely shocking.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Is Cloud Street\u2019s Master Lin\u2019s fortune-telling really amazing?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The official broadcasting website had released a piece of news as well and several forums and message boards were being flooded with this news.</p><br/><p>Many netizens were stunned when they saw the news. To them, this was very strange.</p><br/><p>Many uninformed netizens\u2019 first thoughts were that the broadcaster was trying to promote herself.</p><br/><p>But there were many people who had been watching the live broadcast when it happened. Moreover, Master Lin was one of the characters involved in the news. To them, it was unlikely that it had been done to generate hype, because Master Lin definitely wouldn\u2019t do this to help to promote a broadcaster.</p><br/><p>Hence, this incident made many people feel a little terrified.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was feeling helpless. \u201cIt was just a chance encounter. I didn\u2019t think it would make the news. Sigh\u2026\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-7\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>He really didn\u2019t want to go on the news anymore. It was way too scary.</p><br/><p>It was better to stay low-key.</p><br/><p>However, what Lin Fan hadn\u2019t expected was that many netizens were rushing to Weibo and digging out the comments and posts that he had sent a long time ago when he had just created his Weibo.</p><br/><p>When he saw what was happening, he felt a little embarrassed.</p><br/><p>After all, he had been way too arrogant in the past\u2026</p><br/><p>He hadn\u2019t been as low-key as he was now. Wouldn\u2019t that affect his image in other people\u2019s eyes?</p></div>\n</div>"}

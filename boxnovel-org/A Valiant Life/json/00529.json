It had to do with their life and death.</p><br/><p>\u201cBoss, make the decision. This opportunity is hard to come by.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. It\u2019s rare to see such a guru. If we don\u2019t discuss with this guru, we\u2019ll definitely regret it in future.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is a real guru. And he\u2019s unlike the average guru. We\u2019ve researched for a few days. This hacking method is incomparably cruel but the outcome is exceptionally great. Even though we worked together against him, he screwed us so badly. How strong must he be?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shen Jie Yun looked at his subordinates and said sternly, \u201cHave you all really decided?\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cMmm, okay. I\u2019ll go and consult this guru.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. We deal with technology and we\u2019re always trying to upgrade our skills. Now that we\u2019ve met someone so great, we have to go and get to know him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although Shen Jie Yun was the boss, these brothers would live and die together with him. They roamed around on the Internet and would sometimes get beaten to pulps but they would never lower their heads. They would keep working hard to strengthen their abilities and counter-attack.</p><br/><p>But this time, they had no confidence in a counter-attack because the opponent was too strong. He was ridiculously strong.</p><br/><p>Have you ever seen someone just meet another person and get beaten down on all fours before they even have the chance to greet each other?</p><br/><p>It was like a big man wiping out a whole playground of children in a frenzy. He was simply too strong and there was no chance to hit back.</p><br/><p>Shen Jie Yun said, \u201cYou all have to remember that letting him touch a computer would be against the law.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBoss, if you don\u2019t talk about it and we don\u2019t talk about it, who would know?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, we can take the risk.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shen Jie Yun looked at his subordinates and said, \u201cAlright, we\u2019ll go to the shopping center right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh? Boss, why are we going to the shopping center? Aren\u2019t we going to the detention house?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shen Jie Yun said, \u201cAre you all stupid? If we\u2019re going to interact with the guru, we have to bring gifts.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, right, Boss is really thorough with his thinking.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Detention house.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan sat there with his head lowered, playing with his phone. Right now, there was a lot of news related to him on the Internet and there were even a good number of netizens trying to uphold justice for him.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was a little touched. What a cute bunch of people. He hadn\u2019t wasted his time helping them.</p><br/><p>When he got out, he would definitely treat them well on the Internet and not bully them.</p><br/><p>At that moment, the convict opposite him yelled, \u201cBig Bro, what\u2019s your history?\u201d</p><br/><p>To these convicts, this was really inconceivable. This was the first time they had seen something like this. Who would even believe this if they told them about it?</p><br/><p>How could being imprisoned be so comfortable. If it was the same for everyone, then perhaps many people would be willing to go to prison.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you know about Cloud Street\u2019s Master Lin?\u201d asked Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>The convict shook his head, \u201cMaster Lin? Who\u2019s that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan felt a little helpless. He was so famous and yet they didn\u2019t know him. But thinking about it, these people had already been locked up for a few months, so of course, they wouldn\u2019t know.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat crime did you commit to end up here? And how long is your sentence?\u201d asked Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>The man said tragically, \u201cI am an architect. When I was remodeling the design of a house in Laocheng District, I tore down a wall. How was I supposed to know that that was a load-bearing wall? After tearing it down, the house collapsed that night. Fortunately, it was under renovation and no one was hurt. Initially, it should have been resolved just by paying a compensation fee but who would have thought that they would hold a world conference or something like that there in those few days? That\u2019s why I was sentenced to seven months.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen you really are quite unlucky. But you really have a lot of money. Even the old houses in Shanghai are worth a lot of money,\u201d said Lin Fan with a sigh. Being an architect was pretty profitable.</p><br/><p>The man shook his head and laughed bitterly. \u201cHow could I be wealthy? Before tearing down the wall, I didn\u2019t dare to guarantee that it could be torn down so I asked my superior. He said it could be torn down so I did. In the end, he paid three million. I didn\u2019t have money, so I have to serve several months in prison.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was speechless, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, some people came.</p><br/><p>\u201cGuru\u2026\u201d Shen Jie Yun didn\u2019t open his mouth. It was a young man who shouted excitedly.</p><br/><p>\u201cAhem.\u201d Shen Jie Yun coughed lightly, \u201cBe quiet.\u201d</p><br/><p>The young man retracted his head as he realized as well that he was a little too excited.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at them in surprise. Then, he thought about what he was most concerned about. \u201cYou didn\u2019t destroy my computer, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>When he brought this up, the Internet safety team\u2019s people were all a little embarrassed. This matter really left them helpless. The guru\u2019s computer was really wiped clean. It was so clean that only an action movie was left inside.</p><br/><p>\u201cNope, everything has been kept intact,\u201d said the young man cheerfully.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan let out a breath of relief. \u201cThat\u2019s good. Why are you all here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian opened the cell door. He had an idea of why these Internet specialists were here. He didn\u2019t even have to think about it to know. They definitely wanted to exchange some skills with Master Lin.</p><br/><p>However, it wasn\u2019t an exchange. It should be said that they were here to learn some skills.</p><br/><p>They had been completely wiped out by Master Lin before they could even lift a finger. How could they have an exchange with Master Lin?</p><br/><p>Shen Jie Yun went forward and said with a smile, \u201cThis is the first time we\u2019ve come so we brought some gifts.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan took a look. There were big and small packets of things. Although they weren\u2019t any expensive things, they were a sign of their regard.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou could have just come, there was no need for gifts. Come, please come in,\u201d said Lin Fan happily as he received the gifts.</p><br/><p>The surrounding convicts all stared blankly at this scene. If they hadn\u2019t witnessed this on their own, they would never have believed it to be true.</p><br/><p>This was a detention house. Were they here as f*cking guests?</p><br/><p>Was there a need for this?</p><br/><p>It was simply inhumane.</p><br/><p>It was the first time that Shen Jie Yun and the rest had been invited into a cell. But since the guru had invited them, they didn\u2019t think too much. But really, the guru\u2019s cell had a very different environment. Although it was a little small, as a whole, it was still pretty good.</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian saw that he wasn\u2019t needed and he left for the moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cGuru, I\u2019m Sun Neng. Your skills are really too great. I really worship you greatly,\u201d the young man from before shrieked excitedly.</p><br/><p>He was a technical nerd, always engrossed with the Internet. He hadn\u2019t even found a girlfriend yet.</p><br/><p>Now that he had met a guru that he idolized, he was naturally very excited.</p><br/><p>The others were the same. Although they didn\u2019t express it, they all had looks of marvel on their faces. In their line of work, technical skills were the most important thing. If someone\u2019s technical skills were f*cking awesome, then that person would be their Big Bro.</p><br/><p>Shen Jie Yun really admired the technical skills of that guru in front of them. They were here hoping to learn something from him.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan put down the gifts and said with a beaming smile, \u201cYou must have some reason for coming here. I don\u2019t like beating around the bush, if there\u2019s something, then say it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shen Jie Yun said, \u201cGuru, we\u2019re here today because we would like to discuss technical skills together with you. Your technical skills are amazing and we all respect you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled, \u201cAh, so that\u2019s it. Alright, I don\u2019t have anything to do anyway. I shall discuss with you all. Oh right, did you bring a computer?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe brought it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGuru, you must be lonely here. We\u2019ll accompany you for this period of time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p></div>\n</div>"}

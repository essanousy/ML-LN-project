After being pestered by someone last night, he was still extremely lively today. He wasn\u2019t bothered by it at all. He didn\u2019t even think about it. Sometimes, he would think about it but realize that there was nothing he could do to change the situation.</p><br/><p>He was concentrating on writing the books. It was finally the last book and it would be a relief to finish it. Then, the matter wouldn\u2019t concern him anymore.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, things at Nanshan Children\u2019s Welfare Organisation were normal. The kids loved Chinese arts and although they didn\u2019t make much progress, he believed that they would definitely become potential young Chinese artists in a few months\u2019 time.</p><br/><p>As he thought about that, he felt much happier.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Fraud Tian came forward and looked into the distance. He said, \u201cLook there. That person has been staring at me for a long time. I have been noticing her for some time now but she\u2019s still staring.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was stunned when he looked towards that direction. That b*tch was just standing there watching him as if she was following a movie star.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you know her?\u201d Fraud Tian asked.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shook his head, \u201cNope.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian replied, \u201cLooks like we have to be more careful. I\u2019ve seen quite a lot of movies and this types of people are usually up to no good. Look at her. She\u2019s a woman but she\u2019s wearing men\u2019s clothing. I think she\u2019s a pervert. Besides me in this shop, I doubt anyone else would be her target. I have to be careful.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan just stared at Fraud Tian in shock. Could he be any more shameless?</p><br/><p>After a moment, Brother Qiang Qiang disappeared. It looked like she had left.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan wasn\u2019t bothered by it as he continued writing his books. When he felt tired, he just scrolled through Weibo.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck!\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Lin Fan gasped. Then, the others came over. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Did something happen?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shook his head. \u201cNothing, it\u2019s just a pity that an old grandma died.\u201d</p><br/><p>The others didn\u2019t know what was happening. \u201cWhat does it have to do with you? Why did you make such a big deal of it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan pointed at the screen, \u201cTake a look at it for yourselves.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian looked at it and read. \u201cAn old lady picked up a stranger\u2019s call and the person said that her retirement funds were ready to be collected. Then, she went to the bank to make a transaction and lost $50,000. She was devastated and she died from that. D*mn, these scammers are too inhumane. If they\u2019re so capable, try me. I would definitely make them eat sh*t.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan remarked, \u201cThat\u2019s so pitiful. There are so many scammers now. We can\u2019t seem to stop them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang said, \u201cLook, do these netizens have a screw loose? They even commented bad stuff about this. That\u2019s so immoral.\u201d</p><br/><p>The netizens discussion.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe deserved it for being so stupid.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe had $50,000 and she still wanted to \u2018redeem\u2019 retirement funds. She\u2019s already so rich. Why did she apply for it? It\u2019s normal for her to be scammed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c^ are you guys stupid? How could you scold her for this? It shows how inhumane you guys are.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow pitiful, the scammer should be shot to death.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn the past, this happened before too. The scammer said it was for a scholarship. In the end, he cheated the person of his school fees. These scammers look for people that need help. Furthermore, they know a lot about their family situations. Someone must have sold the information to them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that rubbish? I bought a house and I received a lot of random calls a few days later. They told me they needed to renovate the house and asked me about mortgage loans. The housing department must have sold our information to them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThings are different now. They talk about retirement funds and that information can only be found in government departments. How do these people get it? Besides arresting these scammers, they have to arrest those who sold the information too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat makes sense.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat makes a lot of sense.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was infuriated. \u201cLook, these scammers are too incorrigible. I can\u2019t take it anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian added, \u201cYeah, I can\u2019t tolerate it. As long as you\u2019re human, you shouldn\u2019t be able to tolerate this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan opened up Weibo. \u201cLet\u2019s look at other news.\u201d</p><br/><p>On Weibo.</p><br/><p>This incident had become the headlines and everyone had been discussing it.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis incident reminded me of the news that happened three years ago where Xu Jiao Feng died after being scammed too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn the end, the scammer got caught, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, he got caught. I think they spent about a month on it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, if people didn\u2019t die, the authorities wouldn\u2019t have treated the matter seriously.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is about whether they\u2019re determined to arrest the culprits or not. It\u2019s totally two different things altogether.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to see how long they\u2019ll need to arrest this culprit.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cLook, the netizens on Weibo are friendlier. It\u2019s unlike the other websites.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian nodded, \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan immediately posted on Weibo. \u201cThis matter is too heartbreaking. We have to arrest the culprit.\u201d</p><br/><p>When it was published, netizens immediately commented on it.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin is right. This person is so inhumane. He actually cheated the money of an elderly woman.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI am an Internet policeman. It is extremely difficult to capture these scammers. It is unlike the past. After those incidents in the past, the scammers have become smarter.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, please read their fortunes and see where these scammers are.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you think Master Lin is a God? Reading fortunes? But if there were super hackers. They\u2019d be able to hack into banks and steal information.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c^ I think that\u2019s logical. However, did you think about the consequences of hacking into a bank? They\u2019d definitely be imprisoned.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>After looking at the discussion of the netizens, Lin Fan thought of something. \u201cI have an idea.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian was stunned. \u201cWhat idea do you have?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled, \u201cI gotta stay low-key. Can\u2019t tell you about it yet.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan said confidently, \u201cI believe Brother Lin has definitely thought of a plan. We have to capture these people.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded, \u201cI\u2019ll be heading out for a while.\u201d</p><br/><p>He had thought about this. His computer skills were awesome and it was easy to capture these people. However, he knew that it was difficult to erase trails after hacking into a system. He would definitely be arrested for that.</p><br/><p>Therefore, he needed the support of someone.</p><br/><p>He thought for a moment and felt that he could only approach Liu Xiao Tian about this.</p><br/><p>Justice had to be sought for this incident. He didn\u2019t care about completing his task anymore.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was a man of morals.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian looked at him, \u201cWhere is this fella going again? He\u2019s so secretive.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan said, \u201cBrother Lin must have gone to seek justice. He is the man that I admire.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang said to his broadcasting camera, \u201cBrothers, did you guys hear that? Master Lin is going to seek justice. Under his might, any criminal would definitely be caught.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c666\u2026that\u2019s impressive.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s happening? Why is Master Lin trying to seek justice?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t really understand but I think he\u2019s awesome.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll only shout 666 and say nothing else. However, that\u2019s enough. I would only shout 666 for Master Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p></div>\n</div>"}

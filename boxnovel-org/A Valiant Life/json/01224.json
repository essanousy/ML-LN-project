Don\u2019t you have better things to do?\u201d Lin Fan said as he entered the shop.</p><br/><p>He did not expect Wang Ming Yang to be here so early in the morning.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang\u2019s eyes lit up, and he quickly rushed to Master Lin.</p><br/><p>\u201cBro, I know you finished writing the songs yesterday. I wanted to come over early to pass the song sheets to Huan Yue so that she can start practising now. We can\u2019t let your efforts go to waste.\u201d</p><br/><p>He was stunned at how Lin Fan had written three songs in twenty minutes. However, could he doubt Master Lin like everyone else?</p><br/><p>Even if the world was going to end the next day, he had to believe in him.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan took out a few sheets of paper and placed them on the table. \u201cThey\u2019re here. Don\u2019t lose them. There\u2019s only one copy of each song.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang looked at the papers which were filled with English characters. He put them away properly and replied, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll be holding onto them and won\u2019t lose them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang heaved a sigh of relief. He had finally accomplished a great feat. Then, he whispered to Lin Fan, \u201cBro, I gotta tell you the truth. Didn\u2019t you say that you weren\u2019t good at English? How did you write these songs?\u201d</p><br/><p>He was really curious. Although his friend was an all powerful person, he wanted to know how he had written the songs.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, you really want to know?\u201d Lin Fan smiled. It was a complicated thing to explain.</p><br/><p>However, he did not like to explain complicated things like this.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Wang Ming Yang said and nodded repeatedly. He really wanted to know.</p><br/><p>\u201cActually, I\u2019m good at English,\u201d Lin Fan whispered.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang raised his fingers in disbelief. \u201cYou\u2019re not being honest. I saw your results for the online tests. It\u2019s okay. I\u2019ll stop asking. I have to bring these lyrics back.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGo on, go on.\u201d Lin Fan chuckled and waved. He also did not want to talk about this matter. After all, there was no need to talk about it.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang came and left in a rush.</p><br/><p>To him, time was extremely precious. The international competition was around the corner, and he wanted to make full use of the time he had left.</p><br/><p>He had wanted the songs to be quickly composed. Wu Huan Yue needed time to practise too.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian sneakily walked towards Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t write anything additional before he left. Are you sure you wrote everything in twenty minutes?\u201d</p><br/><p>He was in disbelief. Although he did not know much about the music industry, he read people\u2019s comments about how impossible it was. Hence, he felt that it was impossible too.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled. \u201cOf course. I wrote them all yesterday afternoon. Get back to work. The townsfolk will be here soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>At Shanghai Eastern Han Group.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang parked his car in the garage and rushed up to his office. His employees saw the big smile on Director Wang\u2019s face and started to talk among themselves.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, why is Director Wang in such a good mood today?\u201d A female employee asked.</p><br/><p>A plump male employee guessed, \u201cI think it\u2019s because of Master Lin\u2019s songs.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI thought Master Lin doesn\u2019t know English. How could he have written them?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s not think about it. Who do you think Master Lin is? He was probably just messing with us.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang went to his office and started to call Wu Huan Yue and other musicians into the room.</p><br/><p>When everyone was there, Wang Ming Yang waved the song sheets in his hands. \u201cThey\u2019re here. We can work on them later.\u201d</p><br/><p>The song composer went forward to look at the sheets.</p><br/><p>Although he knew that Master Lin was really powerful, it seemed too unbelievable this time. If Master Lin had really written the song sheets, he wanted to be the first person to look at them.</p><br/><p>He read through them slowly, as if he had been transported to another dimension.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang waited patiently. He wondered how were the songs like.</p><br/><p>He really trusted Lin Fan, and he wanted Master Lin to get the recognition of others too.</p><br/><p>He had spent a lot of money to hire these song composers, and they were all qualified people.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh my god.\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly, one of the composers gasped.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang was stunned after hearing that. He had been patiently waiting for their feedback.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d He wanted to find out what happened.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable.\u201d</p><br/><p>Another composer exclaimed.</p><br/><p>Just as Wang Ming Yang wanted to ask another question, another composer\u2019s face turned red. It was as if he had been hit by something.</p><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue was stunned too. She did not know what was happening. She just felt that something was wrong with these composers.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, stop making noises. Tell me what\u2019s going on.\u201d Wang Ming Yang was anxious after hearing the gasps.</p><br/><p>One of the composers replied, \u201cDirector Wang, Master Lin\u2019s songs are awesome. They\u2019re of elite quality, and all three songs are simply amazing songs.\u201d</p><br/><p>The other two composers nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cInitially, I was doubtful of the quality of his work since it was completed in twenty minutes. However, now that I\u2019ve read it, I think we\u2019re not qualified to comment about his work. These are classics.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang chuckled. He knew that his brother would not disappoint him. He did not expect the songs to stun all three composers.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you read the lyrics? Are they good?\u201d Wang Ming Yang asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cDirector Wang, of course. I think if nothing goes wrong, Wu Huan Yue might even win a prize,\u201d said one of the composers.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, that\u2019s great.\u201d Wang Ming Yang chuckled in disbelief. It was simply an amazing feeling.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuan Yue, you have to do your best!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue nodded after hearing Director Wang\u2019s words. She did not want to let Brother Lin\u2019s songs go to waste. She wanted to work hard for it.</p><br/><p>\u201cDirector Wang, we will compose the songs now. I\u2019m really excited to see the final result. I think it\u2019s going to be unbelievably good,\u201d said one of the composers. It was as if he wanted to start work immediately.</p><br/><p>\u201cGo ahead, but please keep this a secret. Do not leak anything,\u201d Wang Ming Yang reminded them.</p><br/><p>He trusted these people and knew that they would not leak any information. However, he felt that there was a need to repeat that.</p><br/><p>If anything were to be leaked, they would suffer a great loss.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Director Wang.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

It seemed that these topics were becoming popular.</p><br/><p>The netizens were actively discussing it.</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe. There\u2019s not even any fairness when it comes to job-searching nowadays. You have to rely on connections. Without connections, even if you\u2019re from an elite school, you would still lose to people who didn\u2019t graduate from secondary school but have connections.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI am already used to seeing such things. There is only fairness if no one has connections. If somebody has connections, then it would be completely unfair.\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-2\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cI can relate to this deeply. I graduated from a first-tier university and applied for a job in a foreign enterprise. I was number one in the written test and the interview but in the end, the second place got the job instead. I would like to ask, why the heck would that happen?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, isn\u2019t this Nanshan Children\u2019s Welfare Institute managed by Master Lin? I don\u2019t believe that Master Lin would be unfair.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c^just how much do you worship Master Lin? He\u2019s human too and he has selfishness too. How could he always be fair? The way I see it, it must be because that lady looks too ugly. Master Lin didn\u2019t like her, so he chose the pretty one instead. In the future, when he gets the opportunity, he would be able to violate her a little.\u201d</p><br/><p>F*ck your mom. Don\u2019t insult my Master Lin. If you dare to f*cking insult my idol again, believe me, I\u2019ll beat the sh*t out of you.*</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, beat the sh*t out of me? I don\u2019t believe you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The netizens\u2019 discussion was rather intense. Lin Fan was already a Weibo celebrity and frequent Internet users all knew about him.</p><br/><p>But it was naturally impossible for one person to be liked by everyone. The number of haters he had was quite high as well.</p><br/><p>Whenever they had the chance, they would flame him. Using the keyboard to release the darkness in their hearts felt very satisfying. It wasn\u2019t a crime anyway. They had nothing to be afraid of.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-3\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>The reporters had interviewed a number of people involved as well. Those well-qualified applicants were all exceptionally furious as they spoke to the reporters.</p><br/><p>One of them, a young lady, felt that this unfairness had hurt her heart. In front of the camera, she sobbed while complaining.</p><br/><p>\u201cI graduated from East China Normal University. When I heard that Nanshan Children\u2019s Welfare Institute wanted to recruit teachers, I was very excited, because I feel that being able to teach children from a welfare institute is a very meaningful thing. Although the salary and benefits cannot match up to those public schools, I am willing to use what I\u2019ve learned to give back to society. However, when I happily went to apply, I realized a terrifying thing. There is no fairness in the application process.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDuring the interview, everyone was gathered. The examiner was Master Lin. He didn\u2019t ask any questions, nor did he state any requirements. He just told us to stand in a line. After that, he read out thirty names. In the end, he told the rest of us that we have failed to be chosen and those thirty people were hired.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t even know how all this happened. I still don\u2019t understand what the requirements for the recruitment were. What was the point of all this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf he had already chosen the names in advance, why did he even call us over? In order to apply for Nanshan Children\u2019s Welfare Institute, I had to miss out on another school\u2019s interview.\u201d</p><br/><p>When this young lady reached the sad part, she started weeping terribly.</p><br/><p>The reporter who was interviewing her was moved as well. He felt that Master Lin was very likely in the wrong regarding this matter.</p><br/><p>After all, Master Lin was human as well. And all humans make mistakes.</p><br/><p>But this \u2018mistake\u2019 left them really speechless.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-4\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>And this incident had implicated some current students.</p><br/><p>The cause of this incident was a current third-tier school student going to Capital Normal University and East China Normal University\u2019s school forums and taunting them.</p><br/><p>It had instantly started a war between the students of the three schools.</p><br/><p>On the forums.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis Master Lin is ridiculous. When I saw this young lady\u2019s interview, I was very angry. If he had already picked the applicants in advance, why did he play with them by asking them to go for the interview?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. Seeing this young lady cry made me very uncomfortable.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t cry, young lady. If Nanshan Children\u2019s Welfare Institute doesn\u2019t want you, it\u2019s their loss.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour qualifications are so high, you\u2019ll definitely find a better job.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m actually a fan of Master Lin but I would like to say that what Master Lin did this time seems ridiculous indeed. I\u2019ve read through all the news articles but I still couldn\u2019t understand how exactly Master Lin chose who to hire. Could it be that he chose people based on appearances?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, this Lin is just a young man after all. He must have picked the prettiest ladies. Those bookworms don\u2019t look very pretty, why would he hire them?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to stay neutral but I don\u2019t believe that Master Lin would do something unreasonable. And as for those who are insulting him, be careful of getting slapped in the face later on. Don\u2019t blame me for not warning you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, getting slapped in the face? If he can do that, I\u2019ll eat sh*t immediately.\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-5\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan was looking at her phone, frowning. \u201cBrother Lin, are you really not going to say anything about the matter on the Internet?\u201d</p><br/><p>She felt as if this matter had blown up. How could these netizens say such things? They didn\u2019t even bother to clarify the situation before saying such things so irresponsibly.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat am I supposed to say? There\u2019s nothing to say. It\u2019s fine. This news will only last for a while and it\u2019ll be forgotten soon. No need to bother about it.\u201d Lin Fan really didn\u2019t want to say much regarding such things.</p><br/><p>If they were going to grumble about it, then so be it.</p><br/><p>However, this news was a little biased. And some of the articles\u2019 titles were clearly exaggerating the controversy.</p><br/><p>What did \u2018First-tier is not as good as third-tier\u2019 mean?</p><br/><p>There were so many teachers that he had picked who had been from first-tier schools as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cSigh\u2026\u201d Lin Fan sighed and stopped thinking about it. He started looking at other news.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-6\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Nowadays, the entertainment news was rather popular.</p><br/><p>The new television series that Wu Huan Yue was acting in was trending as well. It was pretty good.</p><br/><p>Although she was just a secondary female character, her role was already very important. After all, Wu Huan Yue had never acted in a show before. For her first time, she naturally had to go through some practice.</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang grumbled angrily, \u201cBrother Lin, how could these reporters say all this? They seem to have believed the biased words from others and published such news. This isn\u2019t good. I want to let the truth out!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved his hand. \u201cDon\u2019t bother about all this. Releasing the video would negatively affect those who failed to be chosen. It\u2019s not like we\u2019ll lose a piece of flesh if we just let it be anyway.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut this is too much. I can\u2019t stand it.\u201d Zhao Zhong Yang was frustrated. Brother Lin was protecting those people who hadn\u2019t been chosen, but those people didn\u2019t even know. All they did was keep on saying that there was some kind of corruption involved.</p><br/><p>How was it possible that Brother Lin would be corrupted?</p></div>\n</div>"}

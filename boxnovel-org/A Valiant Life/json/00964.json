In the past, people had been more excited about the physics award but as the quality of life had increased, people were more mindful of their own health.</p><br/><p>The award representative went on stage and picked up the name sheet. \u201cThe Nobel Prize in Medicine goes to\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone held their breaths and waited in silence.</p><br/><p>\u201cHall Wade.\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-2\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Uproar!</p><br/><p>All the viewers in China were dumbfounded. In each of their hearts, certain words popped up.</p><br/><p>\u2018F*ck your mom! Did you make a mistake?\u2019</p><br/><p>Hall, who was sitting below the stage, was stunned. His face appeared blank.</p><br/><p>He had never expected himself to receive the award. But that was his name that had been announced.</p><br/><p>The scientists at the side saw that Hall was motionless, so they patted him on the shoulder. \u201cCongratulations.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hall awoke from his daze but he didn\u2019t show the joy of someone who had won an award. Instead, he felt that he didn\u2019t deserve it.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-3\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>In the broadcast room.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck. How could it not be Master Lin?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, I\u2019m dying of laughter. I don\u2019t even know what you idiots were waiting for. How could someone with the surname Lin even win the award? Do your faces hurt now from being slapped?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c^F*ck off. I\u2019ll only recognize Master Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m done watching. I\u2019m done. What the heck is this? If this isn\u2019t because of a f*cking shady deal, I\u2019ll eat sh*t.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense. Master Lin developed such an amazing thing. Even if you take away the leukemia prescriptions, that anorexia cure should have been enough for him to win the award. What\u2019s the reason for this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck. I\u2019m not watching this anymore. This is outrageous.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cloud Street!</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shrugged. \u201cSee? I told you all that I wouldn\u2019t get the award, so I really won\u2019t.\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Liang\u2019s neck was red. \u201cThere\u2019s something wrong with this. How could Little Boss not get the award with what you\u2019ve managed to discover? Could it be that that guy brought someone back to life or something?\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-4\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cYeah, there\u2019s definitely something wrong.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang was stunned too. He had really believed that Brother Lin would definitely receive the award. But now, the reality was hard to accept.</p><br/><p>This was completely different from what he had imagined.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved his hand. \u201cAlright, alright. Go back to your shops. Let it go.\u201d</p><br/><p>Now that he hadn\u2019t received the award, he still had to reconcile them. This really felt strange.</p><br/><p>Zhongzhou.</p><br/><p>Papa Lin and Mama Lin, as well as a group of neighbors, had gathered in front of a television.</p><br/><p>Papa Lin, in particular, had been very excited. When he heard the name of the winner announced, he lost it.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis\u2026\u201d Papa Lin had no words. He felt that this time, he had embarrassed himself. At the same time, he felt injustice for his son.</p><br/><p><em>How did he not receive the award?</em></p><br/><p>Mama Lin saw her partner\u2019s face all red, so he comforted him, \u201cAlright, alright. Our son didn\u2019t get the award. It\u2019s no big deal.\u201d</p><br/><p>Papa Lin shook his head. \u201cThis isn\u2019t right.\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-5\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cYes, this is not right. Let\u2019s stop watching and go down for a stroll.\u201d</p><br/><p>Papa Lin waved his hand. \u201cNo, I have to keep watching and see what this guy has achieved.\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment that countless people had been waiting for ended in disappointment. Besides Lin Fan, everyone watching the broadcast had similar thoughts going on in their minds.</p><br/><p>On-site.</p><br/><p>Hall walked up on stage. The award ceremony was ending. The medicine award had been the climax.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello, can I say a few words?\u201d Hall said to the award committee representative.</p><br/><p>The representative said with a smile, \u201cOf course.\u201d Then, he faced everyone and said, \u201cThe Nobel Prize recipient wants to share his joy with everyone. Let us welcome him.\u201d</p><br/><p>There was laughter from the audience mixed with applause.</p><br/><p>Many of the scientists who were friends of Hall\u2019s were very happy. Although they hadn\u2019t received the prize, they were happy for Hall.</p><br/><p>Hall cleared his throat. \u201cI want to tell a story to everyone. Perhaps I shouldn\u2019t call this a story as it is true.\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-6\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>When the crowd heard this, they quietened down and listened attentively.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy name is Hall. There are quite a number of you here that are my friends. I\u2019m from a small state in America. I have a fortunate family but, very unfortunately, a few months ago, a problem suddenly appeared in this fortunate family of mine\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The people in the broadcast room couldn\u2019t quite understand what this guy was saying.</p><br/><p>And even some of the scientists at the scene didn\u2019t know what he was talking about. But they continued listening silently and attentively.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, leukemia. My wife contracted the very terrifying leukemia. I could only immerse myself in my research every day in order to forget the despair of it. But everytime my work ended, I would see my wife on the sickbed and my heart wouldn\u2019t be at peace.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, the people understood. Hall was describing the difficulties and challenges he had faced in his life and in his work.</p><br/><p>This kind of speech was very common. Every scientist had problems in their families. Before receiving the award, they had all endured countless sufferings.</p><br/><p>This was a very common way of opening a speech.</p><br/><p>However, the stage now belonged to Hall, so they quietly listened.</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, a few weeks ago, I was in my friend\u2019s cafe, drinking coffee, when I suddenly saw that a Chinese medicine shop had opened opposite the cafe. At that time, my friend said that he would have to endure the awful smell of Chinese medicine when making coffee in the future. I felt that that was just idle talk and it didn\u2019t draw my attention.\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-7\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cBut when I looked over, I was enraged because, on the door of the Chinese medicine shop, there was a poster that infuriated me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt said that leukemia can be cured and you only have to use Chinese medicine.\u201d</p><br/><p>When he said these words, everyone started laughing.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, what a joke. Chinese medicine is mystical indeed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen a real medical scientist sees a joke of an advertisement like that, there is sure to be a disaster.\u201d</p><br/><p>The netizens in the broadcast room were stunned.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck. What is this guy talking about?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck. Could that be the prescription developed by Master Lin? Which boss brought it overseas? Could he have been beaten to death already?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLook at the laughing faces of those people. I know that this definitely isn\u2019t something good.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>As Hall heard the noise from below the stage, he gestured for them to quieten down. \u201cThat\u2019s right. It\u2019s the mystical Chinese medicine indeed. But it is not funny. Because it is thanks to this that my wife\u2019s leukemia has been cured.\u201d</p><br/><p>The audience was stunned. Some of their smiles froze. It was as if they had heard something unbelievable.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-8\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Hall continued, \u201cAnd later on, I found out from that Chinese medicine shop owner that this Chinese medicine prescription was developed by a Chinese medicine master from his country. Also, this master was nominated for the medicine award too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen I heard that I was awarded the prize, my first reaction wasn\u2019t joy, but shock. I didn\u2019t dare to believe that I had received the award instead of the Chinese medicine master from China who conquered leukemia.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHence, I feel that this award should be presented once again and not to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you!\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

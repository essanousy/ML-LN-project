He hid behind the corner of the sofa motionlessly. Then, he slowly stuck out his dog head and observed the surrounding situation.</p><br/><p>After the waiters finished serving the wine, he would go out.</p><br/><p>There were a total of four people in the private room and Li Hu was surprisingly one of them. The other three people didn\u2019t look like good people. Although they didn\u2019t look fierce, there was darkness within their eyes. Also, their eyes kept looking around alertly. They were very vigilant. If anything happened, they would definitely leave immediately.</p><br/><p>One of them, a long-haired man, was playing with a wine glass in his hands. \u201cBrother Hu, this is a big business deal. It just depends on whether you can take it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Hu laughed softly, \u201cLong Hair, don\u2019t talk about whether I can take it. It\u2019s whether you can do it or not. Don\u2019t be like the last time, talking so much but unable to back it up with action.\u201d</p><br/><p>Long Hair was a little embarrassed. But he seemed to have a lot of confidence this time. \u201cLast time was last time. This time, I\u2019m serious. I will bring the goods. You\u2019re a salesperson. This time, you have someone great to help you. As long as you dare to do it, the reward will be unimaginable.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Hu looked at him and smiled, \u201cAlright, alright. Enough said, let\u2019s drink. Today, you all have come to look for me, it\u2019s an honor. Let me take care of all the expenses.\u201d</p><br/><p>Long Hair and the other two men exchanged looks as if they were talking with their eyes. He placed a hand on Li Hu\u2019s thigh and said, \u201cBrother Hu, I\u2019m serious. You should consider it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Hu shook his head and smiled, \u201cLong Hair, I\u2019m someone who does honest business.\u201d But then, his expression suddenly changed. There was a white packet of things on his thigh.</p><br/><p>Long Hair smiled as he looked at Li Hu, \u201cBrother Hu, you can take a look.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, as Li Hu placed his hand on his thigh, the door was opened.</p><br/><p>The waiter said, \u201cChief Li\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Hu waved his hand, indicating for the waiter to leave.</p><br/><p>This had initially been arranged by him, for the waiter to come in and check on the situation. In case something happened, at least it would be discovered.</p><br/><p>Long Hair seemed to realize the situation. \u201cBrother Hu, this time I came with sincerity.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Hu was silent for a moment, then he loosened his hand. Looking at the item in his hand, his expression changed. \u201cAre these new goods?\u201d</p><br/><p>Long Hair smiled, \u201cMmm, they\u2019re new goods. Authentic new goods. You can have as much as you want. This is just a sample. Brother Hu can have a try. As long as Brother Hu agrees, there will be a never-ending source of income. It will definitely satisfy you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Hu was a little emotional. \u201cLong Hair, according to my knowledge, you can\u2019t possibly obtain these goods. A while back, someone smuggled them into Shanghai and he is now wanted by the police. Don\u2019t tell me that you got it from there. If that\u2019s the case, I wouldn\u2019t dare to accept this.\u201d,</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha\u2026\u201d Long Hair laughed, \u201cBrother Hu, if you\u2019re going to be like this, then there\u2019s no need to talk anymore. You know too that not just one person dares to do this in Shanghai. In the past, I\u2019ve relied on your wealth and I\u2019ve received your grace. Now that I have something good, you were the first person I looked for. If you really don\u2019t want it, I won\u2019t force you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Hu paused for a moment before saying, \u201cAlright, let\u2019s arrange a meeting for me to take a look. I want to confirm it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Long Hair waved his hand, \u201cThat\u2019s not possible. You know the rules. It\u2019s not convenient. Tomorrow night, we\u2019ll still meet here and make the first transaction.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay. Let\u2019s drink. Enough talk about this. Although this place is safe, there are various kinds of people here,\u201d said Li Hu.</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, right.\u201d Long Hair smiled. The two other people were silent but they had let out smiles as well.</p><br/><p>Li Hu\u2019s gaze fell on these two men once again. He had never seen them before and he didn\u2019t know where Long Hair met them.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Downstairs.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan had been waiting for a long time. Why wasn\u2019t Elder Dog out yet? Could it be that something had gone wrong?</p><br/><p>Just as he was about to go up to take a look, Elder Dog appeared at his feet.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was delighted. He picked Elder Dog up into an embrace and they retreated together.</p><br/><p>Outside.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Dog, how\u2019s the situation? Did you hear anything?\u201d asked Lin Fan curiously. He didn\u2019t know the full situation and he hoped that Elder Dog had heard some useful information.</p><br/><p>Although he knew that Li Hu was going to do something big soon, he wasn\u2019t sure of what information they would be able to scout out that night.</p><br/><p>\u201cWoof woof~\u201d Elder Dog barked, \u201cCan\u2019t take it, can\u2019t take it. The reward is big. I\u2019m an honest man. Very authentic new goods\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan stared at Elder Dog stupidly. What kind of game was this?</p><br/><p>What use would it be if he didn\u2019t understand any of it?</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was disappointed in Elder Dog. He couldn\u2019t expect too much. If he thought that Elder Dog would be able to understand what those people had said, then he was undoubtedly an idiot that was dreaming.</p><br/><p>However, when he realized that Elder Dog had an anticipatory look on his face, he was stunned. This face was so mischievous. It was as if he had some sort of hidden agenda.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan raised a finger, \u201cTen servings.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Elder Dog Nicholas saw Lin Fan raise his finger, he had become energized but when he heard that he would only get ten servings, his legs softened and he lay flat on the ground as if he was very exhausted.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Lin Fan understood. Elder Dog had turned bad.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan patted Elder Dog on the head. \u201cTwenty servings, that\u2019s the most. If you don\u2019t agree, then forget it. Although you\u2019re a dog, you have to know that even a dog mustn\u2019t be too greedy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWoof woof~\u201d Elder Dog barked excitedly, \u201cBrother Hu, this is a big business deal. It just depends on whether you can take it\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan never expected that Elder Dog was hiding so much. Elder Dog had clearly remembered it but he had been acting like he hadn\u2019t. What a f*cking devil.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Lin Fan listened closely and his expression slowly changed.</p><br/><p>Judging by Elder Dog\u2019s description, although they hadn\u2019t said explicitly what was going on, Lin Fan understood.</p><br/><p>\u201cDrugs.\u201d</p><br/><p>And from this, he realized in astonishment that there seemed to be many big secrets hidden among this.</p><br/><p>Wanted by the Shanghai police.</p><br/><p>Wasn\u2019t that the same guy that Liu Xiao Tian had mentioned?</p><br/><p>How did that guy get implicated in this?</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, this is interesting, coming to such a place with a mutt.\u201d At that moment, a sly laughing voice rang out.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked up at the person. Long Hair glared at Lin Fan. \u201cWhat are you looking at, kid? If you look anymore, I\u2019ll beat you up.\u201d</p><br/><p>The man by his side said, \u201cDon\u2019t cause trouble.\u201d</p><br/><p>Long Hair\u2019s expression changed. He became cautious. \u201cYes\u2026yes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, the three men passed by Lin Fan\u2019s front.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the three men and a grin appeared on his face. These three men had something to do with Li Hu.</p><br/><p>As one of them lowered his head to board the car, his shirt collar slipped down and the tattoo on his neck was revealed.</p><br/><p>\u201cScorpion!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan suddenly recalled the image that Liu Xiao Tian had shown him. Although he hadn\u2019t seen the person\u2019s face clearly, Liu Xiao Tian had described him clearly. The distinctive feature of the drug lord was the scorpion on his neck.</p><br/><p>In an instant.</p><br/><p>The three men drove off.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan didn\u2019t chase them because he knew that they would be back the next day.</p><br/><p>\u201cBeautifully done, Elder Dog. Let\u2019s go home.\u201d Lin Fan smiled.</p><br/><p>Elder Dog barked. Thinking about the next day\u2019s scallion pancakes, he was filled with delight.</p></div>\n</div>"}

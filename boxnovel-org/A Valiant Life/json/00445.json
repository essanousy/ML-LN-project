How did that situation end off and how did he get here?</p><br/><p>These questions filled Wang Ming Yang\u2019s mind. If he didn\u2019t clarify these matters, he wouldn\u2019t be at peace.</p><br/><p>There were just too many suspicious points. Why did he sleep naked? It didn\u2019t make sense! Did someone do something to him?</p><br/><p>Just as he was about to open the door, Wang Ming Yang subconsciously touched his butt. It didn\u2019t hurt much. There shouldn\u2019t be a problem.</p><br/><p>He opened the door.</p><br/><p>When Wang Ming Yang saw Lin Fan, he was startled. \u201cHey, brother, why are you here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin fan shook his head, \u201cSigh, Ming Yang. Do you really not know what happened last night?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang scratched his head. \u201cI was just about to ask you. What the heck happened last night? Why don\u2019t I remember anything?\u201d Then, he looked at Wu Yun Gang and asked, \u201cYun gang, I was fine yesterday, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Yun Gang just stood there and didn\u2019t say a word. He shook his head regretfully.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you shaking your head?\u201d Wang Ming Yang couldn\u2019t understand it. What did that head-shaking mean? What exactly had happened to him? Could something have really happened?</p><br/><p>Wun Yun Gang sighed, \u201cYou should ask Master Lin regarding this matter. I shan\u2019t speak about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang looked at Lin Fan and deep in his heart, he felt that something wasn\u2019t right. He couldn\u2019t help but be worried. \u201cCould it be that something really happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded regretfully as well. \u201cMing Yang, I couldn\u2019t tell. I really couldn\u2019t tell. I never thought that after drinking, you actually like to take off your clothes and expose your body in front of others. That situation was a little terrifying. If we hadn\u2019t stopped you in time, you would have really stripped yourself completely naked.\u201d</p><br/><p>When he heard the first part, Wang Ming Yang felt that it wasn\u2019t quite right. However, when he heard the back part, his whole face turned white.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat can\u2019t be true, right?\u201d Wang Ming Yang\u2019s throat moved slightly as he asked fearfully.</p><br/><p>\u201cAsk yourself that question,\u201d said Lin Fan in a disdainful tone. \u201cIf it\u2019s not true, then why were you butt naked when you woke up? However, you don\u2019t need to worry too much. We didn\u2019t let you embarrass yourself in public. Yun Gang and I dragged you back immediately. I even have a video that I will be sending to you. Later on, go take a look for yourself. After watching it, tell me your thoughts.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan, of course, couldn\u2019t hand his phone over to Wang Ming Yang. This was to prevent him from deleting the original video after watching it. That would make his efforts from the previous night a waste.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang took out his own phone. When he played the video, noises came from the phone that sounded like ghosts wailing and wolves howling. This voice was rather familiar too. When he saw the face of the person in the video, he was flabbergasted.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck, how could this be? How could I become like that? Oh god, my reputation!\u201d Wang Ming Yang had gotten completely dumbfounded. If this video was spread, he would be laughed at.</p><br/><p>Not many people might have known him in Beijing but it was different in Shanghai. It might even go on the headlines.</p><br/><p>He could even imagine what the headline would be.</p><br/><p>\u2018Billionaire makes a scene after getting drunk\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang put down his phone and remained stunned for another two seconds before yelling, \u201cNo, hurry up and delete this video! Don\u2019t ever let it leak out, otherwise, my reputation will be ruined!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan immediately guarded his phone and smiled, \u201cI can\u2019t. I have to save this video. In future, I\u2019ll let you watch it again when I have the chance. Deleting this video is not possible.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck! We\u2019re brothers! How could you do this? Hurry up and delete it, I\u2019m begging you! This is too dangerous!\u201d Wang Ming Yang was on the verge of crying. He never thought that he had been like that the previous night. It wasn\u2019t right! How could he be someone like that?</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed, \u201cStop dreaming. But honestly, did you go crazy yesterday? Why did you drink so much? Didn\u2019t you know that those guys were messing with you on purpose?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang was a little embarrassed. \u201cThis\u2026this\u2026 Actually, I didn\u2019t expect things to turn out this way but those guys had authority. If I didn\u2019t give them any face, the jointly-organized event by Yun Gang and I would be very difficult.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan patted Wang Ming Yang on the shoulder. \u201cAlright, it would be very difficult eh? Last night, if Yun Gang hadn\u2019t called me, I probably would have had to bury your corpse. That\u2019s enough talking for now. Go and rest for a while. I have to go out for a bit. I\u2019m going back to Shanghai tomorrow. How long are you going to stay here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re leaving so soon?\u201d Wang Ming Yang asked in a surprised tone.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you think I have nothing to do like you? Cloud Street is about to collapse without me. If I don\u2019t hurry back, something will really happen.\u201d Just thinking about the situation at Cloud Street gave Lin Fan a headache. While he had been at Beijing, no scallion pancakes had been sold. Those townsfolk came every day but didn\u2019t see him. They might even soon develop intentions to kill him.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m going out for a bit. Go and rest. As for this video, I\u2019ll take care of it for now. In future, I\u2019ll decide whether or not to delete it based on your performance,\u201d said Lin Fan as he waved his hand.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang asked, \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><br/><p>Without turning back, Lin Fan replied, \u201cReturning a favor for you. If I had known that you would cause so much trouble, I would never have followed you here to Beijing. But there\u2019s no choice since you\u2019re my brother. You\u2019re like an insect that I just can\u2019t get rid off.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Wang Ming Yang heard this, he exploded, \u201cF*ck, I\u2019m an insect? How am I following you? But who are you returning a favor to anyway? Why don\u2019t I know about this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, hey, we haven\u2019t finished talking. At least give me a rough explanation! At least let me understand the situation a little!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang saw watched as Lin Fan walked away without turning back. He sighed helplessly, then, he looked over at Wu Yun Gang and said, \u201cYun Gang, what exactly is going on?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSigh\u2026\u201d Wu Yun Gang sighed as well, expressing his helplessness.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang couldn\u2019t understand it and his heart was not at peace at all. \u201cDon\u2019t sigh! Hurry up and explain things to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Yun Gang looked at Lin Fan and lost his desire to speak. Then, he sighed once more, \u201cSigh, it\u2019s hard to speak. Ming Yang, just listen to me. Don\u2019t ask anymore. It\u2019ll always be better not to know. I\u2019m afraid that you might not be able to take it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck\u2026\u201d The more Wu Yun Gang behaved like that, the more curious Wang Ming Yang got. What the heck had happened? These two guys were acting way too mysteriously. Even if he had embarrassed himself, they still should have told him the full situation. If they just stayed mysterious like this and didn\u2019t say anything, how the heck would he know?</p><br/><p>However, he had a rough understanding of what had happened. The previous night\u2019s happenings were probably not simple.</p><br/><p>Those three \u2018Young\u2019-whatever, didn\u2019t seem like simple people at all. And since Wu Yun Gang had called Lin Fan to bring him back, it was clear that that situation had developed to stage that even Wu Yun Gang couldn\u2019t handle.</p><br/><p>However, something still wasn\u2019t right. Other than Wu Yun Gang, who else did Lin Fan know from Beijing?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Then, he looked at Master Lin. He was beyond dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>He wasn\u2019t shocked because there was a problem with Tianshu Milk but he was shocked that Master Lin had managed to discover this problem without the use of any kind of technology.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin,\u201d the employee spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d Lin Fan answered curiously. Then, he smiled and patted the employee on the shoulder. \u201cThank you. I\u2019ve troubled you.\u201d</p><br/><p>The employee shook his head. \u201cMaster Lin, I want to ask you how you found out about this?\u201d</p><br/><p>He was already shocked beyond words. He didn\u2019t even know what to say. He just felt that it was too unreal. And having seen the situation on the Internet, he wondered if it was truly possible that Master Lin could taste such a thing.</p><br/><p>But it didn\u2019t make sense. How could someone taste something like that?</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled calmly. \u201cDidn\u2019t I say on the Internet? I drank it and tasted the problem.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, don\u2019t lie to me. How can someone be able to sense the problem using one\u2019s mouth?\u201d The employee shook his head. He wouldn\u2019t believe it even if he was beaten to death.</p><br/><p>\u201cSigh!\u201d Lin Fan sighed helplessly. It really made things hard for him when people didn\u2019t believe him.</p><br/><p>But things were good now. The test results were out, which meant that he had evidence now. <em>What is up with that Tianshu Milk Company? I\u2019ve clearly managed to prove the problem but they don\u2019t believe me.</em></p><br/><p>Right now, the situation on the Internet had become very intense.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, I shan\u2019t ask about that anymore. But if we publicize this, it will be a huge blow to Tianshu Milk Company. It might even cause them to be ruined and many people would lose their jobs. Do you think we should settle this privately?\u201d asked the employee.</p><br/><p>He was quite worried about this. After all, it was a large corporation. If such a problem were to arise, it would be a big deal.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the employee in surprise. \u201cWhy would you think that way?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh? Could it be that there\u2019s a problem with my thinking?\u201d The employee was taken aback. He didn\u2019t feel as if there was anything wrong with his thinking. After all, he was considering the well-being of everyone. He didn\u2019t want to see a bad outcome.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a huge problem.\u201d Lin Fan looked at the sheet of paper and said, \u201cThink about it. Do you think they\u2019re more important or are the lives of countless citizens more important? Tianshu Milk Company\u2019s slogan is \u2018Children who drink Tianshu will have strong bodies\u2019. If we don\u2019t expose them, who knows how many children will drink this milk? Do you want those children to develop cancer when they reach twenty-something-years of age?\u201d</p><br/><p>When the employee heard that, he hastily waved his hands. \u201cNo, how could I have such thoughts?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. \u201cYou\u2019ve done brilliantly. By delivering the test results quickly, you\u2019ve saved even more people. This Tianshu Milk keeps saying that I\u2019m slandering them and spreading false rumors. They\u2019re saying that I\u2019m retarded and I have nothing else to do. Now that the test results are out, let\u2019s see what they have to say.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, Lin Fan exchanged a few more words with the employee before leaving.</p><br/><p>He was going to post the results on Weibo immediately for everyone to see.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, over at the Quality Inspection Office, they were busy inspecting as well since something like this had happened.</p><br/><p>This matter had caused a huge impact. Tianshu Milk was an established brand. Hence, the Quality Inspection Office trusted their products very much. They would usually just check some of the samples sent by the company.</p><br/><p>There had indeed been no problems with these tests but now that Master Lin had said on the Internet that there was a problem, they couldn\u2019t just use the past test results to say that there was no problem.</p><br/><p>In the end, they had sent someone to buy the currently-sold products for selective testing.</p><br/><p>At that moment, in the testing lab, a group of people was standing rooted to the ground with their jaws dropped. That sheet of paper was placed on the table and none of them dared to pick it up.</p><br/><p>Because they couldn\u2019t bear the responsibility for this outcome.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do we do?\u201d said one of the testers. His face was filled with fear and he was at a loss. They would have to bear full responsibility for this matter.</p><br/><p>In the past, when they tested samples from Tianshu Milk, there had been no problems. But now that they had bought a bottle from outside, they discovered a huge problem.</p><br/><p>This aflatoxin level had really exceeded the standard by a huge margin. The product had completely failed the requirements.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow could we have known? It wasn\u2019t us who discovered it but it was Master Lin. If this matter is exposed, we will lose our jobs. This is our responsibility.\u201d One of the men was about to collapse. His heart was cold and trembling. He even thought of dying right there.</p><br/><p>\u201cPublicize it. That\u2019s the only way to salvage the situation. If we still hesitate and wait until an irreversible stage, we will really be done for.\u201d</p><br/><p>This was the head office. If even they didn\u2019t know about it, they would surely lose their jobs.</p><br/><p>\u201cPublicize it? Are we going to say that there\u2019s a problem now?\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, the leader of the Quality Inspection Office rushed in. He picked up the sheet and took a look. He had an urge to scold someone but he decided to forget about it.</p><br/><p>This was their mistake. They had been too trusting towards Tianshu Milk Company\u2019s quality and they hadn\u2019t taken the job seriously enough.</p><br/><p>\u201cLeader, what do we do now?\u201d asked one of the employees.</p><br/><p>They were really at a loss. They were the ones who had checked the products. Now that such a problem had occurred, if people were to investigate, they would have to bear the consequences.</p><br/><p>The leader remained silent for a moment before saying, \u201cPublicize it. Apologize. It was a lapse in our work and our trust in Tianshu Milk Company that has led to this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut leader, if we say that, we will be scolded to death by the netizens.\u201d</p><br/><p>The leader glared at that employee. \u201cDo you want to avoid getting scolded or do you want to suppress the issue? If we were the ones who discovered this problem first, perhaps we could have settled this privately.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut now, do you think Master Lin doesn\u2019t have evidence?\u201d</p><br/><p>The employee said, \u201cIf Master Lin has evidence, why hasn\u2019t he publicized it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStupid. You really are stupid. Master Lin is waiting for us to declare our position. We\u2019re the Quality Inspection Head Office. If we don\u2019t manage to discover it from our tests, what do you think will happen? Will the netizens still trust us? That\u2019s why we have to hurry up and publicize it,\u201d said the leader impatiently. Then, he sighed. \u201cAlthough we\u2019ve never interacted with Master Lin, Master Lin actually thought about us. In the future, when we have the chance, we definitely have to thank him in person.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing that, the employees nodded. <em>So that\u2019s what happened. </em>At the same time, they were very grateful to Master Lin. they hadn\u2019t expected Master Lin to care about their feelings.</p><br/><p>But if Master Lin were to hear this, he would definitely say \u2018Don\u2019t f*cking overthink things. I was just waiting to get the test results.\u2019</p></div>\n</div>"}

The knowledge of the wuxia was indeed powerful. The cold or hot weathers didn\u2019t daunt him one bit. It helped him to maintain the most comfortable internal temperature.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan stood behind Lin Fan and placed her fingers on the temple of his head. She slowly massaged it. After which, she lowered her head to let down her hair, allowing her scent to surround his nose.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Lin, the results of the International Art Exhibition should be out soon, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was stunned, \u201cReally? How do you guys know that it\u2019ll be out soon?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan laughed, \u201cThe news is online! The exhibition is today. I\u2019m not sure how it will be.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed, \u201cThere shouldn\u2019t be any problems. Didn\u2019t I already paint ten paintings? As long as the audience has nothing wrong with their eyes, then there shouldn\u2019t be any problems.\u201d</p><br/><p>With regards to those ten paintings, he had utter faith in himself. If none of them would get the first place, then there really was nothing that could be done.</p><br/><p>He had originally wanted to call Zheng Zhong Shan, but after thinking about it, he decided to forget it. It was still night time over at their place and the Art Exhibition hadn\u2019t officially started. They had to wait until it was night time over here in Shanghai before the Art Exhibition would start over there.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou Lan, your skills have improved! The amount of pressure applied is just nice. Have you been practicing?\u201d Lin Fan laughed. These days were free and easy. Whenever he was tired, Wu You Lan would just give him a massage or rub the temples of his head. It was extremely comfortable.</p><br/><p>Moreover, this was exactly the kind of life that Lin Fan wanted. Although having the Encyclopedia and wealth came in handy, he didn\u2019t want to live such a tiring lifestyle. Being able to relax, be free, and do some of his favorite hobbies, those were the most important things.</p><br/><p>Receiving the praise from Lin Fan, Wu You Lan gave a very sweet smile, \u201cNo, I haven\u2019t! I\u2019ve only watched a few videos on it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan patted Wu You Lan\u2019s wrist, \u201cOkay, that\u2019s not bad. Keep up the good work!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d</p><br/><p>He proceeded to open up Weibo.</p><br/><p>The discussion online about the International Art Exhibition was still very intense.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe exhibition will begin in about ten hours time. I wonder what position our country will be able to clinch this time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt will definitely be a good ranking.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem likely this time. Didn\u2019t you see what happened the previous time around? We were laughed at by many. There doesn\u2019t seem to be much hope this time either.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTsk! Have some confidence in our own country!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe President of the Chinese Art Association, Master Zheng Zhong Shan, has impressive art skills. I\u2019m sure it won\u2019t be too bad this time around.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, yes. There\u2019s also Yue Qiu Ju Shi and Master Tao Shi Gang. They both have awesome art skills! In the market, their artworks are considered to have great value, but they\u2019re not for sale. It is extremely difficult to get your hands on one of their works.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey can be considered true masters, unlike some other masters who flood the market with their worthless artworks.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThose artworks can count for nothing. They are only used to promote themselves. However, I really do not know how this year\u2019s International Art Exhibition will be. If the artworks that we submitted for this year is anything like last year\u2019s, then I think there wouldn\u2019t be much hope.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDoes anybody know which artworks were submitted to the Exhibition? If anyone knows, please say it here!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNope. No one knows until the day of the Exhibition.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, from what I heard, our country has only submitted ten artworks.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? That can\u2019t be. From what I know, there should be at least thirty artworks.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>He closed his Weibo.</p><br/><p>Even though there wasn\u2019t a very big influence, there were still people talking about it. The most important thing was that the citizens of the country needed a victory after the many recent internal events that had happened. No matter where this victory came from, it would definitely raise the spirits of the citizens.</p><br/><p>This time, it was the International Art Exhibition. Naturally, it was something that the people looked forward to.</p><br/><p>Even if they didn\u2019t clinch the first place, they still had to win over some other countries.</p><br/><p>He hadn\u2019t started on the task of the sixteenth page of knowledge yet. Right now, he was thinking about one thing \u2013 the landscaping knowledge. This wasn\u2019t some kind of law-defying ability. It was considered more of an artistic ability. One that could be used cultivate the capabilities of the children.</p><br/><p>For the next few days, he would visit the Children\u2019s Welfare Institute and explain this knowledge to the children. And at the same time, getting the seeds for the landscaping wouldn\u2019t be a problem. They were sold at a very cheap price at the Department Store.</p><br/><p>Moreover, those sold at the Department Store weren\u2019t like the common trash that was sold elsewhere.</p><br/><p>As for exactly how the seeds would turn out, he had to wait for them to grow before finding out.</p><br/><p>At night.</p><br/><p>Everyone was in dreamland.</p><br/><p>However, it was bustling with noise and excitement over in America. The International Art Exhibition had officially begun.</p><br/><p>Zheng Zhong Shan was personally at the event, as well as many other members of the various countries\u2019 Art Associations. At the same time, Lin Fan\u2019s paintings were being transported over. For safety reasons, his paintings were handed over to professional transporters the moment they reached the venue.</p><br/><p>This was the first time they had been so serious. They had never been this nervous in the past.</p><br/><p>These paintings were personally painted by Master Lin. They were painted on huge canvases with rich scenes. There was a high level of skill involved in these paintings. It could even be said that these paintings were on the same level as National Treasures.</p><br/><p>In addition, Zheng Zhong Shan had also told others about these paintings, hoping that they would be able to be displayed in museums. One of the artworks, Along the River During the Qingming Festival, was especially high in research value.</p><br/><p>Of course, these artworks belonged to Master Lin. He didn\u2019t have the authority to decide where these paintings would go. However, he had discussed these possibilities with Master Lin before, and Master Lin didn\u2019t seem to have any problems with them. Everything was given to Zheng Zhong Shan to handle.</p><br/><p>Occasionally, when Zheng Zhong Shan thought of Lin Fan, he felt embarrassed, but at the same time, he felt touched. This was because Lin Fan had put too much trust into him.</p><br/><p>The next day.</p><br/><p>The citizens didn\u2019t know what had happened in America while they had been sleeping.</p><br/><p>However, the moment they opened their eyes and looked at the news on their phones, they were completely and thoroughly stunned.</p><br/><p>\u2018Good news! At the International Art Exhibition, our Nation\u2019s Chinese Art has stunned many artists from all over the world!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018America\u2019s Top Master Helton fainted on the spot after looking at a painting!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Chinese Art has demonstrated extraordinary skill.

The ten paintings at the exhibition were actually all drawn by one man!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>At this moment, the citizens who just woke up rubbed their eyes. What was going on? Did they read it wrong?</p><br/><p>These headlines were rather ambiguous. Was the editor sick? Even if he wanted to flatter the nation, he didn\u2019t have to go to such extents.</p><br/><p>Online.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck! What\u2019s going on today? Why is there all this news so early in the morning?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it real or fake? We clinched the first position in the International Art Exhibition?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHoly sh*t! The Masters from other countries fainted and cried? Isn\u2019t such praise going a bit overboard?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cProud of my nation!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha! Awesome! We managed to clinch it!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThese news articles are all real! My friend over in America told me that when he saw these paintings, he was f*cking shocked.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDoes your friend have any photos of the paintings? Hurry and let us see what these paintings look like!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHold on, let me ask him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need to ask. Just look at the trending page on Weibo. The Chinese artworks have already been uploaded there. I swear, when I saw the first painting, I was stunned. But when I saw the tenth painting, I f*cking pissed myself. Who the hell is so awesome?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Let me go and see!\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, the netizens online all flared up.</p><br/><p>They wanted to know who exactly was the artist.</p></div>\n</div>"}

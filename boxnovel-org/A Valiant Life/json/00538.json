As for those astonishing remarks by Master Lin, they equally shocked the netizens.</p><br/><p>Awesome!</p><br/><p>It is simply just too awesome!</p><br/><p>He was just released from the Detention House, yet he is already displaying the mindset that he can do whatever he wants.</p><br/><p>However, they liked this side of Master Lin. No need for fear, but only action.</p><br/><p>His computer was taken away and with it, his action movies. However, he did get a compensation for it.</p><br/><p>At Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>The surrounding townsfolk knew that Master Lin was back and hence approached him passionately.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha! The Little Boss is back! We can finally eat the scallion pancakes again!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOne month\u2026 For one whole month, there weren\u2019t any scallion pancakes. How did I manage to survive those days?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cToday is the happiest day of my life. Our Little Boss who has gone missing is finally back!\u201d</p><br/><p>A long winding queue had already formed early in the morning.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian grudgingly said, \u201cTake a look! The townsfolk have missed you so much during the time you weren\u2019t around. They\u2019ve all come the moment you came back!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhongyang always hung around in Lin Fan\u2019s shop. He didn\u2019t have any salary each month, yet he liked to live stream the daily proceedings in the shop. He is also very well -liked on the live streaming platform.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled as he approached the front of the store, \u201cLads, I\u2019m back!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Boss, welcome back!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe have been waiting for a long time!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t run away this time. If not, it\u2019d make us very sad.\u201d</p><br/><p>The surrounding shop owners looked at the Little Boss and smiled broadly.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe atmosphere is so much different with the Little Boss around. Cloud Street seems to have regained its life!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIndeed! Little Boss is really awesome!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the adorable townsfolk and said with much grief, \u201cLads, I\u2019m not sure if you know this, but during my one month in the Detention House, you guys were the one that I couldn\u2019t stop worrying about. For someone as dedicated as me, being unable to provide scallion pancakes for you all every day makes me feel very terrible. So, in order to make up for my mistakes, I will make fifty scallion pancakes today to reward you all!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWow! I don\u2019t believe it. I just can\u2019t believe it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m so touched I\u2019m going to cry.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Boss has such a good conscience.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Boss is a model for the industry.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo much respect for the Little Boss. This is just great!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Boss, don\u2019t tire yourself out. Take your time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved his hand, \u201cEveryone, say no more. I have already set my heart to it. There\u2019ll be fifty pieces today. Even if I tire myself out, I would still be happy. Everyone loves my scallion pancakes and that makes me even happier.\u201d</p><br/><p>The crowd felt touched. They thought that the Little Boss was too dedicated to his work. Never would they ever have imagined before that he would one day sell fifty pieces of scallion pancakes.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan couldn\u2019t help but sigh. The townsfolk were simply too adorable.</p><br/><p>Making only fifty pieces after resting for a month is really making a profit.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian stared blankly at the situation unfolding before him. Just what were these townsfolk thinking?</p><br/><p>How did this show that he was dedicated?</p><br/><p>It was too terrifying.</p><br/><p>Were they just brainless?</p><br/><p>At this moment, Fraud Tian saw that Lin Fan just stood rooted to the ground, with his gaze locked at the stall.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you staring at the stall?\u201d he asked.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cDon\u2019t you think that the stall is very dirty?\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian had his doubts, \u201cIs it? I don\u2019t think it\u2019s very dirty.\u201d</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t know why Lin Fan would bother himself with such specifics. Selling scallion pancakes was like that. The stall would definitely have some stains. This was already considered to be better than others because they don\u2019t use it for long periods of time. Moreover, Wu You Lan would frequently wash the stall. Compared to the others, it was many times better.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shook the thought out of his mind. He should not be thinking about these things for the time being. He should be concentrating on making the scallion pancakes.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian distributed the number plates for the draw.</p><br/><p>There were considerably more people today and so the distribution of the number plates took a bit longer.</p><br/><p>Fifty pieces might seem like a large amount, but looking at the number of the people in the queue, it would quickly be distributed out.</p><br/><p>Those who got chosen were extremely happy, but those who did not get chosen were devastated.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat the f*ck! My luck is terrible! I didn\u2019t even get chosen even though there were fifty numbers.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha! All is good! I\u2019ve been selected! It\u2019s been two months consecutively! Never would I have thought that my luck was so good.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho wants to sell their number plate to me? I\u2019m willing to pay five hundred dollars!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, right! It\u2019s merely five hundred dollars. Are you trying to undervalue us or Little Boss? We\u2019ve haven\u2019t had the scallion pancakes for over a month. Don\u2019t you know how valuable it is?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not selling mine! Not even over my dead body!\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian shook his head, \u201cAll these foodies have gone crazy!\u201d</p><br/><p>He was wondering, these scallion pancakes were simply magical, but the situation unfolding before them was just too fake.</p><br/><p>There were many scalpers in the queue. To his knowledge, the value of the scallion pancakes had shot up.</p><br/><p>The reason for this rise was an odd one. According to these scalpers, these scallion pancakes were as if they were made from the hands of a god-like doctor and it was said that they could cure any sickness.</p><br/><p>Originally, when these tyrants went shopping, they would only require an influence of ten thousand. But right now, it has inflated to an influence of fifteen thousand. Moreover, there was a lack of supply. It was terrifying.</p><br/><p>In the month that Lin Fan was in jail, the scalpers were in grief for their source of income had come to an abrupt stop. Isn\u2019t it just sad?</p><br/><p>\u201cWow! I finally achieved my dream of getting my hands on the scallion pancake!\u201d a middle-aged man exclaimed. Tears were flowing out of his red, swollen eyes. It was as if the scallion pancake in his hands were emitting dazzling rays of light. Those surrounding him who didn\u2019t get selected were staring at it with much envy. They were tempted to just snatch it out of his hands.</p><br/><p>One by one, the scallion pancakes were ready and gasps of surprise were endless. The entire Cloud Street was shrouded with a completely different kind of atmosphere.</p><br/><p>The other stall owners weren\u2019t surprised. It is a well-known fact that the godly scallion pancakes are able to steal the hearts of many.</p><br/><p>Even until now, they still could not comprehend the godly skill that the Little Boss possessed.</p><br/><p>Whatever the reason is, it still made them extremely surprised.</p><br/><p>In the afternoon.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was just sitting there. His gaze was directed at the stall.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? Since this morning, you have been staring at the stall. Is there a problem?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shook his head, \u201cNo, but I have this constant nagging feeling that the stall is very dirty and I keep having the urge to clean it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan was in doubt, \u201cIs it dirty? Let me go get a bit of water to wash it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan stood up and waved his hand. \u201cNo need. Let me do it. If I don\u2019t do this personally, I would feel very uncomfortable.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan stared at Lin Fan in disbelief, \u201cYou\u2019ll do it? You can do manual work?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed, \u201cDon\u2019t look down on me. I\u2019m an expert in cleaning.\u201d</p><br/><p>Since he said it, he\u2019ll have to do it.</p><br/><p>He immediately went to get the tools.</p><br/><p>Water, detergent, metal mesh, cleaning cloth, etc.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>In front of Master Lin\u2019s shop.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan squatted there. When he picked up the cloth, he felt a rush of energy. It was as if that his thoughts would remain blocked if he did not clean his stall.</p><br/><p>Elder Zhang was walking by but he stopped in his tracks. \u201cLittle Boss, what are you doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed, \u201cCleaning the infrastructure!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCan you do it?\u201d Elder Zhang asked skeptically.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled, \u201cTake a closer look. I\u2019ll let you see what is called amazing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Oil stains and dust was instantaneously removed by Lin Fan. The metal plate was shining. Everywhere that his cloth touched, only a trail of sparkle was left behind.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan was astonished, \u201cYou can even remove those stains? I\u2019ve tried many times before but to no avail!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed, \u201cTake a look! I\u2019m the best cleaner in the world! Any stains would vanish into thin air when it is handled by me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAmazing\u2026\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

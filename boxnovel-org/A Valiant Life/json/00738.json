The direction that the wind was blowing on the Internet wasn\u2019t right and her heart was irritated.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis Lin Fan doesn\u2019t have any abilities at all. He doesn\u2019t even have works of his own and yet, he has so many fans. I simply can\u2019t understand it,\u201d she thought to herself.</p><br/><p>She looked at the comments. What were they saying?</p><br/><p>\u201cYing Jin, hurry up and admit to your corruption. Otherwise, I\u2019ll pull down your panties.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about? Since when has she ever worn panties?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe citizens of Qingzhou are out. Enemies, hurry up and surrender. Otherwise, you\u2019ll taste our power.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The evidence from the incident two years ago had long disappeared into the stream of history. What basis did they have to say all this?</p><br/><p>Although she had been flamed very much, at least she had not let it get to her head.</p><br/><p>The previous incident had not even ended and now, they were out to flame her again. She really could not stand it.</p><br/><p>Since it was like this, she had to safeguard her honor using the law.</p><br/><p>She had sent out her Weibo post and its main purpose was to defend her own reputation.</p><br/><p>As she looked at the Weibo post that she had sent, Ying Jin nodded contently. She would first give Lin Fan an appetizer. The more impressive stuff was yet to come.</p><br/><p>Even if he was f*cking awesome, he still had to be responsible for his own words.</p><br/><p>There was a price to pay for starting a war so casually.</p><br/><p>*ring ring*</p><br/><p>Ying Jin looked at her phone display. Her brows furrowed. It was an unknown number and she had no idea who it was.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho is it?\u201d asked Ying Jin.</p><br/><p>From the other end of the call came a male voice. \u201cHello, Teacher Ying. Do you still remember me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ying Jin frowned. \u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Far away, in a certain city, a sloppy-looking young man wearing slippers was reading the news in the newspapers. A look of anticipated appeared on his face.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher Ying, two years ago, on \u2018Heavenly Male Voice\u2019, I gave you five million dollars. Do you still remember?\u201d</p><br/><p>Back then, this young man had given Ying Jin a gift in exchange for getting the first place.</p><br/><p>Back then, he was the son of a rich family and he had joined \u2018Heavenly Male Voice\u2019 for fun. He had done it just to play around. He just wanted the satisfaction of being surrounded by reporters.</p><br/><p>Within a month of becoming the champion, he had indeed experienced the feeling of being paid attention to by others and needless to say, it felt great.</p><br/><p>However, because his own talents were insufficient, it was only a month before the reporters forgot about him.</p><br/><p>However, to him, all this didn\u2019t matter anymore.</p><br/><p>He had already experienced it and that was enough.</p><br/><p>It was better to just enjoy his life as the son of a rich family.</p><br/><p>However, due to unforeseen circumstances, his family became bankrupt and he instantly hit rock bottom.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t have any skills, so naturally, he became very poor. He had thought about asking Ying Jin for money before but he knew that to get back that money, it was as difficult as trying to fly into the sky.</p><br/><p>Ying Jin\u2019s face slowly changed as she said in a stern tone, \u201cWhat are you talking about? I don\u2019t know you.\u201d</p><br/><p>*patter*</p><br/><p>She immediately hung up the phone.</p><br/><p>As the saying goes, whatever you fear will come to you. She had never expected to receive this man\u2019s call.</p><br/><p>However, thinking about it, she realized that this wasn\u2019t good. If that guy told the media something that he shouldn\u2019t, what would she do?</p><br/><p>She called him back.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher Ying, it seems that you have remembered me. I\u2019ve seen the \u2018Strongest Heavenly Voice\u2019 show. That Master Lin is just full of nonsense. I have no idea what he\u2019s talking about\u2026\u201d Yang Jie was all smiles. He had found a way to become rich. He just had to see how sincere Ying Jin was.</p><br/><p>Ying Jin\u2019s breathing quickened and she immediately blurted out, \u201cWhat do you want? Tell me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yang Jie heard this. The lion had opened its mouth. \u201cWhat are you talking about, Teacher Ying? I\u2019m just speaking facts. However, I\u2019m not doing very well now. If possible, could Teacher Yin sponsor me with ten or twenty million dollars? I will not breathe a single word, of course. And I definitely won\u2019t appear in public.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Ying Jin heard this, she was furious. Her expression turned icy cold. \u201cYou\u2019re threatening me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, no, how could I dare to threaten you? But I really have no choice. Once Teacher Ying has decided, you can give me a call again later on,\u201d said Yang Jie with a thin smile. It was as if he had already cornered Ying Jin. \u201cOh right, the judges all received considerable benefits back then. If I don\u2019t keep this a secret and I say the truth in front of the reporters, what do you think would happen?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck your mom,\u201d Ying Jin cursed. She had not thought that someone would dare to threaten her.</p><br/><p>Yang Jie said casually, \u201cAs long as Teacher Ying is willing to help, you can f*ck as long as you like.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ying Jin was speechless. In the face of this rascal, she had no idea what to say. In the end, she said through clenched teeth, \u201cYou scum, you better remember that I will never give you money, not even a single cent. Do you think anyone will believe you?\u201d</p><br/><p>She hung up.</p><br/><p>Yang Jie, who was somewhere far away, said fiercely, \u201cD*mn it. You\u2019re just forcing me to do it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ying Jin pressed her temples. Her head was aching incomparably. If she said she wasn\u2019t worried, she would be lying. However, she could stand the feeling of being treated as someone who had too much money on her hands.</p><br/><p>But the way she saw it, that guy would definitely call back.</p><br/><p>If it was just one or two million, she might give it to him. However, it would still be an unpredictable time bomb. She would never know when it would blow up.</p><br/><p>If Lin Fan had not existed, then even if that guy told the media about it, it wouldn\u2019t matter. However, if Lin Fan found out about it, he would definitely chew her up.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>*panting sounds*</p><br/><p>Yang Jie\u2019s body shivered. It was very uncomfortable. He reached into his pocket. Not a single cent.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe that I, Yang Jie, will carry on like this,\u201d said Yang Jie with a maniacal expression. Then, he dialed a number.</p><br/><p>\u201cGreetings, Master Lin.\u201d The call got through.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan, who was far away on Cloud Street, heard that cold and evil voice through the phone and nearly threw his phone away.</p><br/><p>Who was that?</p><br/><p>It sounded like he was sick.</p><br/><p>That voice was so feminine. Was he trying to defy nature?</p><br/><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d asked Lin Fan. He kept feeling as if something was wrong with that voice. It was as if that person wanted to eat him up.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, who I am is not important. I have evidence that Chen Rui An did not steal that song. Of course, you have to give me some remuneration if I give the evidence to you.\u201d Yang Jie was using a very soft voice, not because he was shy but because he felt that it would give Lin Fan that feeling that he really possessed the evidence.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh!\u201d Lin Fan was a little surprised. \u201cHow much remuneration do you want?\u201d</p><br/><p>If that was really the case, Lin Fan would not mind paying a bit of money in order to get evidence against Ying Jin.</p><br/><p>\u201cVery little. To you, it would only be a small bit of remuneration,\u201d said Yang Jie.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan asked, \u201cHow little exactly?\u201d</p><br/><p>On the other end of the call, Yang Jie licked his dried-up lips. \u201cI only need ten million, you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Before he finished, Lin Fan interrupted.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou must be living in a dream.\u201d</p><br/><p>*patter*</p><br/><p>The call was hung up.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan cursed unhappily, \u201cWhat a motherf*cker. If it was a thousand, I could consider. But he\u2019s asking for ten million? Does he think Ying Jin is made of diamond?\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

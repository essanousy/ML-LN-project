Is this true? Something like this actually happened in our country?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know but there are even videos. It should be true.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnimals. If these meats that have been chilled for tens of years enter the market, how many people will suffer?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe important thing now is not the meat anymore. It\u2019s the drugs hidden inside. This is a huge matter. Everyone knows that our government has zero tolerance against drugs.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin is really incredible. I\u2019m fully convinced now. He just arrived in the Northeast and he has already done such a great deed. This is worthy of celebration!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, Master Lin is our lucky star. He has come to the Northeast to save us poor fans. I\u2019m happy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis logistics company belongs to the Northeast\u2019s Godfather Liu. This behind-the-scene mastermind absolutely must not be forgiven. But according to how things usually go, I have a feeling that this mastermind will probably escape once again.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not possible. I believe in Master Lin. He definitely won\u2019t let Godfather Liu go. He will definitely round everyone up.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho is this Master Lin you all are talking about? Since when did this character appear?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c^Did you just get an Internet connection? I suggest you go on the Internet and enrich your knowledge.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>On Weibo.</p><br/><p>This matter was already the number one trending topic.</p><br/><p>Big and small forums had all reported about it. This had caused the whole country to know about it.</p><br/><p>And this person, Godfather Liu, had been exposed. After all, on the previous day, Lin Fan had analyzed everything clearly in front of the reporters. How could these reporters not know who this man was?</p><br/><p>They published everything that Master Lin had said on the news without changing a single word.</p><br/><p>Shanghai.</p><br/><p>Chen Chang Sheng and Wang Ming Yang were together. When this news came out, Chen Chang Sheng was completely dumbfounded. He had not expected such a thing to happen over in the Northeast. Moreover, it was Master Lin who caused it.</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t quite understand how Master Lin had been able to do that.</p><br/><p>At this moment, he looked at Wang Ming Yang in astonishment. \u201cChief Wang, how do you think Master Lin did this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang was already speechless in his heart. How could he have know how his brother had done it? If Chen Chang Sheng asked him, who was he supposed to ask?</p><br/><p>\u201cChief Chen, it doesn\u2019t matter how it was done. It has already happened. This has gotten out of hand, hasn\u2019t it? Do you think the opposition will have a life and death struggle with my brother? Will it be dangerous?\u201d Wang Ming Yang was now worried about those things.</p><br/><p>If the opposition already felt like he could not come back from this, would he go against Lin Fan to the death?</p><br/><p>This felt very dangerous.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis\u2026\u201d Chen Chang Sheng didn\u2019t know how to answer. He felt that the possibility was too great. He had some understanding of Godfather Liu\u2019s character and Godfather Liu was very vicious.</p><br/><p>The police station.</p><br/><p>That logistics manager stared blankly at the policemen in front of him.</p><br/><p>This situation was completely unexpected. He didn\u2019t even know what he should say.</p><br/><p>\u201cYang Fei, I\u2019m going to give you one chance. Who do these things belong to?\u201d A righteous old policeman stared at Yang Fei sternly. He didn\u2019t believe that those things belonged to the manager in front of him. Because according to their investigations, this manager didn\u2019t have the capabilities.</p><br/><p>After a night of searching, the amount of drugs they found was simply shocking. It was probably the most major case in the history of Northeast China.</p><br/><p>Yang Fei sat there with his hands handcuffed. His heart was very nervous.</p><br/><p>He wasn\u2019t stupid. He could not take the blame for those drugs. Otherwise, he would lose his life, because he would have to pay for it with his life.</p><br/><p>However, what was he supposed to do regarding Godfather Liu? If he betrayed Godfather Liu, he would probably not be the only one in trouble. His entire family would also be in trouble.</p><br/><p>\u201cTell me. Who do they belong to?\u201d asked the old policeman firmly.</p><br/><p>The gang led by Godfather Liu was very savage in the Northeast. He naturally wanted to take out this bunch of pests in one go but he didn\u2019t have the ability to do so in the past. He had never had the opportunity. Now that the opportunity had appeared, he naturally had to seize it and ask more questions to get more useful news.</p><br/><p>As long as he filed this information, he didn\u2019t believe that anybody would dare to take a risk against them. But at this moment, he underestimated the abilities of Godfather Liu\u2019s gang.</p><br/><p>A colleague came over. \u201cBrother Hui, the leaders asked you to go out for a while. Let the people sent by the higher-ups handle the interrogation.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on? I almost got my answer.\u201d The old policeman was puzzled but his expression suddenly changed. He felt as if there was about to be a plot twist.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know about that. It\u2019s an order from the higher-ups.</p><br/><p>Yang Fei had not known what to do the whole time. When he heard the conversation between these two, his hopeless heart suddenly gained some hope.</p><br/><p>This must be Godfather Liu way of rescuing him.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>At that moment, Lin Fan was still roaming the streets as if unaffected by this incident.</p><br/><p>He was just thinking about how this situation would change. Just thinking about it made him curious.</p><br/><p>*Ring Ring*</p><br/><p>His phone rang.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan answered the phone and said with a smile, \u201cAh, why would Godfather Liu think of calling me?\u201d</p><br/><p>On the other end of the call, Godfather Liu wanted to kill Lin Fan very badly but he resisted the urge.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, if there\u2019s anything, we can slowly talk. There\u2019s no need to play us like that, is there?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was startled. \u201cGodfather Liu, this is a misunderstanding. I would I have known that you hid those things. If I had known, I definitely wouldn\u2019t have done this. I would definitely have contacted the Drug Enforcement Troops instead.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026\u201d Godfather Liu almost couldn\u2019t resist shouting at Lin Fan in rage. \u201cDon\u2019t frame me. Those things aren\u2019t mine.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, if it\u2019s not then it\u2019s not. It\u2019s no use telling me this. You have to tell the police. But really, Godfather Liu, you shouldn\u2019t be angry. It\u2019s just going to prison, what\u2019s there to be afraid of? When I have the chance in future, I\u2019ll come and visit you,\u201d said Lin Fan, laughing.</p><br/><p>Right now, even without looking, he knew that Godfather Liu definitely wanted to cut him up into pieces. But sadly, such a wish was too unrealistic. It wasn\u2019t so easy to happen.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat exactly do you want with me?\u201d Godfather Liu was calling because he wanted Lin Fan to remove the news on Weibo. He had a way to suppress this matter and also guarantee his own safety but if Lin Fan kept biting him, things would not be so easy.</p><br/><p>\u201cGodfather Liu, that sentence isn\u2019t right. What have I done to you? I\u2019m just roaming the streets now. I haven\u2019t done anything to you. Has there been a misunderstanding between us?\u201d said Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe,\u201d Godfather Liu laughed coldly, \u201cHow about this? I\u2019ll remove myself from the logistics business and I won\u2019t get involved ever again. We\u2019ll forget about everything between us from now on, okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSure. There is no conflict between us anyway. It\u2019s just a misunderstanding. Alright, stop disturbing me. I have to go and buy things,\u201d said Lin Fan. Then, he hung up.</p><br/><p>When Godfather Liu heard the busy tone, he couldn\u2019t help but start roaring in anger.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck your mom!\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

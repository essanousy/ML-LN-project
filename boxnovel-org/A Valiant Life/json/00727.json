He had predicted that both Liu Ying Dong and Zhao Li wouldn\u2019t be friendly with Master Lin since they both had a close relationship with Ying Jing.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan\u2019s scuffle with Ying Jing in the slapping incident had already gone viral, and everyone knew about it.</p><br/><p>That was the most logical explanation. However, there was nothing much to worry about, but could it be possible that they would bring their emotions to the stage?</p><br/><p>The vice-president gave a light cough, \u201cSince this is a live broadcast, I hope that the four of you guys will be able to keep your professionalism. The contestants can give us problems, but the teachers shouldn\u2019t have any issues. That is our only requirement.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan and the rest nodded, giving the vice-president their guarantee. Lin Fan didn\u2019t find any problem with that request- people had spent money to invite them over, and it was only right that they didn\u2019t give them any trouble in the show.</p><br/><p>Only a moronic person would cause a scene during the program.</p><br/><p>It was business all the way until the afternoon.</p><br/><p>President Liu suggested that everyone had lunch. However, Liu Ying Dong and Zhao Li didn\u2019t want to sit on the same table with Lin Fan. Hence, they tactfully declined the invitation and gave the excuse that they had something to tend to.</p><br/><p>Huo Jian Xiang, on the other hand, was interested in getting to know more about Lin Fan, and so agreed without much thought.</p><br/><p>It was the few of them who had lunch together.</p><br/><p>In the late afternoon.</p><br/><p>A piece of news appeared on the web.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe four teachers for the TV program \u2018Strongest Heavenly Voice\u2019 have finally met. Of the teachers, both Liu Ying Dong and Zhao Li seem to have a negative sentiment against Master Lin. Investigations by the editor have revealed that Liu Ying Dong and Zhao Li are close friends of Ying Jing. Since Master Lin has enmity with Ying Jing, the negative sentiments from both Liu Ying Dong and Zhao Li have followed. Will this conflict of interest continue on into the program?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn, the editor is talking a lot of crap this afternoon. Where did he get his source from?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat the editor said does make a lot of sense. If you take a look at Weibo, Ying Jing and the two of the teachers have a very close relationship.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, I really can\u2019t wait for the \u2018Strongest Heavenly Voice\u2019 to start airing. I\u2019d love to see all the drama.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c^, you can keep on dreaming. That will never happen.\u201d</p><br/><p>If Lin Fan had seen that piece of news, he would have reeled back in shock. That article was clearly written by Shanghai Satellite TV Network\u2019s own people, and the piece of news was to create more hype for the show.</p><br/><p>Of the four teachers, three of them had conflict amongst themselves. The show would definitely be more popular with all the additional drama.</p><br/><p>At night.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was just about to leave his shop at Cloud Street when Wang Ming Yang arrived.</p><br/><p>What followed next was a huge bear hug.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn, if I don\u2019t come looking for you, you\u2019ll never find me,\u201d Wang Ming Yang complained.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t you seen how busy I am the past few weeks? I\u2019ve got so much on my plate. Anyway, what\u2019s up?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, I just felt like visiting you. How about we go for some drinks?\u201d Wang Ming Yang smiled cheekily.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan squinted his eyes, looking at Wang Ming Yang, \u201cZi Le is away filming, am I right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI really can\u2019t hide anything from you, can I? You\u2019re right, she\u2019s away filming,\u201d Wang Ming Yang said, chuckling, \u201cAnyway, I hear that you\u2019re a teacher for the TV competition \u2018Strongest Heavenly Voice\u2019, so I wanted to discuss something with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s talk when we get there. Let\u2019s go to Lu Chuan, but we better cut down on the drinking. I still have to work tomorrow,\u201d Lin Fan said, not asking Wang Ming Yang what it was that he wanted to discuss.</p><br/><p>\u201cSure, no problem. Now that you have to be a teacher on the show, you definitely can\u2019t drink too much.\u201d</p><br/><p>At night, at the open air restaurant.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at Wang Ming Yang puzzled, \u201cYou wanted to talk to me about this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat else? I tell you, my company has quite a few star-performers. However, the number of them is just too small. So I just want to make a simple request- if you see any promising singers during the program, please refer them to my company,\u201d Wang Ming Yang said.</p><br/><p>For Wang Ming Yang who had tasted success in the entertainment industry, he could not give up this huge piece of meat. Although he did have a few star performers in his company, Wang Ming Yang wanted to expand the number of talents that he had under his company.</p><br/><p>However, he didn\u2019t have a good eye for talent and couldn\u2019t see if someone had potential.</p><br/><p>His brother, on the other hand, was different- his eyes were deadly accurate. If he said that someone had the potential of making it big time, it was definitely going to happen.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan didn\u2019t reject him, \u201cSure, no problem. What you\u2019re trying to say is that I make the decisions, am I right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, you call the shots. As long as you say the word, I\u2019ll fully support your decision,\u201d Wang Ming Yang said confidently. Lin Fan had all the authority to act on Wang Ming Yang\u2019s behalf.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll do that. However, I have to remind you that Wu Huan Yue is one of us. You can earn money, but you better not exploit her, otherwise I\u2019ll get angry,\u201d Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy brother, that\u2019s no problem. I\u2019ll go and review the contract tomorrow to your satisfaction. However, I\u2019ve got to rely on you this time. Select out a few potential stars for me that can get popular really quick,\u201d Wang Ming Yang said.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan raised his glass, \u201cAlright. Cheers to this unscrupulous businessman using me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat is a whole load of cr*p. Since when have I ever used you? Even if I backstab people, I\u2019ll never betray my brother. Even if we committed a crime together and the police take me away, I\u2019ll never reveal you,\u201d Wang Ming Yang said.</p><br/><p>*Vomit*</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, alright, that was so sappy. Let\u2019s drink,\u201d Lin Fan cringed a bit after hearing Wang Ming Yang say that. He raised his glass.</p><br/><p>\u201cCheers.\u201d</p><br/><p>An entrepreneur from Shanghai, a Master from Shanghai. Both of them were sitting there at the cheap open-aired restaurant, talking about anything and everything. If anyone saw them, they wouldn\u2019t have believed that they were famous.</p><br/><p>The next day!</p><br/><p>6 o\u2019clock in the evening.</p><br/><p>The live broadcast of the \u2018Strongest Heavenly Voice\u2019.</p><br/><p>The people in the crowd all had to buy tickets to watch the show, and the ticket was extremely hard to get. The whole arena was packed to the brim, and all of them were waiting for the show to commence.</p><br/><p>The \u2018Strongest Heavenly Voice\u2019 competition was different compared to other singing competitions, and that was that the success of the competitors completely depended on the verdict of the teachers. The teachers had the power to determine if a competitor could stay in the competition.</p><br/><p>The crowd did not get to participate, they were just there to watch the show.</p><br/><p>There was quite a crowd outside the arena.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuo Jian Xiang, I love you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMusic god Liu Ying Dong, we will support you forever!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cZhao Li is so pretty!\u201d</p><br/><p>The crowd roared as the teachers walked by. The three teachers were already used to huge crowds of fans adoring them, but they still enjoyed shaking the hands of their fans.</p><br/><p>There was only one exception, and that was Lin Fan. Compared to the other three teachers, no one was cheering for him.</p><br/><p>Liu Ying Dong and Zhao Li were laughing coldly. With that kind of popularity, how did he still have the face to become a teacher? It was totally embarrassing.</p><br/><p>After Lin Fan got off the car, his face started looking helpless. He couldn\u2019t help but shout, \u201cHey, where are my supporters?\u201d</p><br/><p>Huo Jian Xiang chuckled helplessly. This was the first time he was seeing a public figure asking for people to cheer him on.</p><br/><p>Liu Ying Dong and Zhao Li were laughing. No matter how many times he pleaded, it wouldn\u2019t be of any use. None of his fans were there.</p><br/><p>Suddenly.</p><br/><p>Laughter spread through the crowd.</p><br/><p>The fans in the crowd started laughing.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, this is just too hilarious! Master Lin is such a tease.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStop laughing! Can\u2019t you see that Master Lin is on the verge of crying? No one is cheering him on.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, I love you, please don\u2019t cry!</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, I want to have your babies!\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, the crowd started roaring.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded his head in satisfaction, smiling, \u201cThis is more like it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p></div>\n</div>"}

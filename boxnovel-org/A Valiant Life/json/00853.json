His expression was a little angry as he said, \u201cMaster Lin, I hope that you will watch your tone. Also, how did you get in here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow I got in does not concern you at all,\u201d Lin Fan had talked to this headmaster on the phone and he expressed his anger to him before. Now that he was meeting him face to face, he was definitely not going to give him any face at all.</p><br/><p>To others, the headmaster was like a God. The children wanted to study here so they kept trying to flatter the headmaster. However, for Lin Fan, he didn\u2019t even have any kids, so there was no need for him to flatter the headmaster.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d the headmaster cast an angry look onto Lin Fan, \u201cDo you not have any basic courtesy at all? Can\u2019t you talk to me properly?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNope,\u201d Lin Fan said as he taunted the headmaster with his expression. Then, his gaze shifted to the female student who was standing there. He carefully looked at her. He felt helpless.</p><br/><p>However, in his eyes, there was not anything too scary about this. Maybe at a glance, he would think it was scary but he was already used to it.</p><br/><p>After which, he did not care about the headmaster and the students who looked like they wanted to beat up him but went directly to Jin Shan Ping\u2019s side. He patted her on the shoulder and tried to comfort her by saying, \u201cStudent Jin, don\u2019t be scared. Even though none of them want to help you, the Master is here to help you,\u201d then he looked at the students who were carrying a banner.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you students doing?\u201d Lin Fan asked.</p><br/><p>The rowdy students looked at Lin Fan and unhappily said, \u201cMaster Lin, don\u2019t bother about this issue. You said that we were trash on Weibo didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. You humiliated us.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn the past, I still thought that you were pretty decent. I didn\u2019t think that you were such a disgusting person.\u201d</p><br/><p>The students were not going to be afraid of Lin Fan just because he was famous on Weibo. They had so many people with them so they had nothing to be afraid of. They simply scolded as they wished.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed and said, \u201cTrash? I said that the people who enrolled themselves at this university were fools. I did not say that you guys were trash.\u201d</p><br/><p>When the rowdy students heard this, they could not help feeling complacent. To them, this Master Lin was in complete fear of them.</p><br/><p>However, when they thought about it, they felt like they were right. They were all higher education students, the future of the nation. Against them was just a guy who uses Weibo to amuse himself. How would he even dare to provoke them?</p><br/><p>But suddenly, something felt amiss.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan very calmly said, \u201cI did not think about it before, but now that you guys mentioned it, I\u2019ll have to add on to my statement. You bunch of rowdy students, in my eyes, are trash. Wait, no\u2026 you guys aren\u2019t even trash. Trash can still be recycled and become something useful, but if we recycle you guys, it will feel like we are just polluting the area.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The surrounding students heard this and could not hold control themselves and started shouting. However, in the blink of an eye, they shut up. They realized that the headmaster was staring at them with a killer look in his eyes. When they saw that, they panicked and felt like something bad was going to happen.</p><br/><p>Han Yan, as a female goddess, saw that Master Lin was standing up for Jin Shan Ping and was very unhappy.</p><br/><p><em>Such ugly people should just stay away.</em></p><br/><p>Master Lin, in her heart, was someone she deemed to be a suitable partner. However, she already had a partner. Even though he was a fat pig, but his load of money was even bigger.</p><br/><p>In her eyes, good looks came from assets.</p><br/><p>Although this Master Lin did not have a lot of money, he was famous enough. However, she did not see anything attractive in the way Master Lin was right now.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, as a famous public figure, don\u2019t you think that it is very inappropriate for you to say things like that?\u201d Han Yan arrogantly said.</p><br/><p>The moment she spoke, everyone\u2019s attention shifted to her.</p><br/><p>The surrounding students all saw that the female goddess had opened her mouth and they all agreed with her. To them, whatever the female goddess says, goes.</p><br/><p>\u201cSuitable or not, how does that concern you? I\u2019m here today to say one thing \u2013 You students, are trash. Do you understand?\u201d Lin Fan was lazy to talk about useless things with them and got straight to the point.</p><br/><p>Not surprisingly, when everyone heard that, they became furious in an instant. They felt like they had been humiliated.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck you mother, how can you be so untactful with your words?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*cker, calling us trash.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHumiliating our goddess. Disgusting. Really too disgusting.\u201d</p><br/><p>Han Yan\u2019s expression became very ugly. She had never had anyone speak to her like that before.</p><br/><p>Jin Shan Ping did not know what to do and was just rooted to the spot. She did not know what was going on and why Master Lin had come to speak up for her.</p><br/><p>The only thing she could feel was that the atmosphere was not right and that everyone was seemed to be angry.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin\u2026\u201d Jin Shan Ping said with a very weak voice as she was not very confident. However, when she was about to talk, she was cut off but Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>To Lin Fan, she did not need to say anything right now.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the headmaster and said, \u201cI really want to ask, since these trash are saying that this student is bothering them, how do the other students feel? Can I trouble you guys to tell me if you really think that her appearance is affecting your studies?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou guys should know that she is only like that because she saved someone\u2019s life three years ago.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan said that, the surrounding students all looked at each other in dismay.</p><br/><p>One of the darker skinned male students stood up.</p><br/><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t been affected at all. I feel like besides losing my head out of fear the first time, I got used to it the second time and it hasn\u2019t affected me at all.\u201d</p><br/><p>This male student had been holding back for a long time. He was a very righteous person inside, but in the face of so many people opposing him, he was a little scared. But now that Master Lin had stood up for her, he was not scared at all.</p><br/><p>Han Yan and the rest of them heard what he said and then immediately shouted at him. Their eyes were filled with anger and some of the rowdy students began to snarl at him.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhich class are you from?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck, I think he wants to die.\u201d</p><br/><p>Various words of abuse came from the crowd of people.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed and said, \u201cHeadmaster, are the students your school accept of such a manner? Or is it because your school is lacking money so you opened up your back door and let some rich hooligans come here and study?\u201d</p><br/><p>When the headmaster heard this, his expression looked a little green as well as a little white. He said, \u201cYou better not try and slander us. Our school\u2019s enrolment is all based on the grades of the students. There is definitely none of that \u2018opening the back door\u2019. Please watch the words that you use.\u201d</p><br/><p>In the sea of surrounding students, another one of them stood up.</p><br/><p>\u201cI did not feel like she was affecting us but rather, it was the actions of you guys that made me feel disgusted. She did not do anything to provoke you guys so why do you guys want to chase her out of the school?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. She came in through her results. How can people like you, who have access to higher education, still have this sort of discriminating eyes?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis was all the doing of Han Yan. I don\u2019t know if the rest of the group are crazy but this girl is already the mistress of some fat pig. Yet they still suck up to her every day and are being used as tools by her. It is really foolish.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, I have no complaints at all.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled and said, \u201cHeadmaster, what do you have to say? A majority of the students all have no problem with her and yet you are still listening to the displeasure of a small group of students and going to expel a student. Let me ask you \u2013 is your brain being controlled by them or are you taking bribes and doing deeds for them?\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

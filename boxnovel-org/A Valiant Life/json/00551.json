I hope you guys don\u2019t mind.\u201d Lin Fan smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho\u2019s coming? How do you know there will be people coming later?\u201d Fraud Tian said, looking puzzled.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf they don\u2019t come, something would be seriously wrong. The only thing is that I never thought that the video would be released that fast.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian understood what Lin Fan was saying. \u201cThose b*stards won\u2019t get any hospitality from us later, no chairs and no tea for them. They\u2019re just going to stand.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan nodded her head in agreement. They couldn\u2019t give them any grace at all.</p><br/><p>Just as Lin Fan predicted, a group of Senior Professors streamed towards Lin Fan\u2019s shop.</p><br/><p>The Senior Professors stood outside the door, looking into the shop. Some of them were sulking terribly, but given the current situation, they couldn\u2019t pit their might against Lin Fan anymore- it would just be suicide.</p><br/><p>Before they came, Professor Yang had prepared beforehand, his face beaming with friendliness. \u201cMaster Lin, we had to come down personally.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh? If you have anything to say, just say it. I don\u2019t really know you guys that well, so it wouldn\u2019t make a difference if you guys came or not,\u201d Lin Fan said, scanning the crowd.</p><br/><p>The professors cringed, that sentence was just so disrespectful.</p><br/><p>Regardless, they were the top of the Chinese Medicine business. They had good standings in the community and their network spread far and wide, and to be treated like this by Master Lin was something different.</p><br/><p>Professor Yang smiled awkwardly as he walked into the shop. Eyeing one of the stools, he walked over towards it, wanting to sit down before speaking to Master Lin.</p><br/><p>Just as he was about to sit, Fraud Tian put his foot on their chair, not even looking at him, treating them as if they weren\u2019t there.</p><br/><p>This embarrassing moment made Professor unsure on what to do.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled. He wasn\u2019t a man of big attitude, but he was someone who bore grudges. To those who wronged him, he sought never to give them any face.</p><br/><p>Although the people from the other party were elderly, a grudge was still a grudge. It wouldn\u2019t make a difference even if they were young.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan took up his tea cup, slowly sipping from it. \u201cProfessor Yang, if you have something to say, say it. I\u2019m rather busy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, this is Professor Yang, how can you not give him any face at all?\u201d one of the younger professors exclaimed, his face black with anger.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked up, wiping his face. \u201cYour reputation is what you make it to be, but if you guys keep on thinking that just because you\u2019re elderly and more senior and so you can defraud me, then you are terribly wrong. If you have something to say, please say it, otherwise please leave. I don\u2019t have that much time to deal with you guys now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Professor Yang put up his hands, signalling to the rest to shut up. Thereafter, he turned to Lin Fan. \u201cMaster Lin, do you really want to blow this issue up so big?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think so much. I\u2019m not the trouble maker here. This was completely your fault and has nothing to do with me. I\u2019m the victim here- I was the one who wrote those books and you guys just signed your name on the authorship without my permission, and now you come here acting as if I owe you guys?\u201d</p><br/><p>Professor Yang stayed silent. Just as he was about to speak, another noise broke his chain of thought.</p><br/><p>\u201cUncle Lin, I want to report that\u2026\u201d Lil\u2019 Fatty raced over.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan lit up as he saw Lil\u2019 Fatty. \u201cLil\u2019 Fatty Chang, what is the problem?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lil\u2019 Fatty Chang\u2019s shirt was dusty, and he looked like he had just been in a fight. \u201cZhang Xiao Hui copied my homework and so I went to tell his dad. In the end, Zhao Xiao Hui beat me up and I couldn\u2019t fight back at all.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled, as he continued his conversation with Lil\u2019 Fatty Chang, completely ignoring the presence of the Senior Professors, as if they were invisible.</p><br/><p>\u201cLil\u2019 Fatty, could you stand one side first. We have to discuss with Master Lin about adult matters, please don\u2019t disturb us,\u201d one of the senior professors said strictly.</p><br/><p>Lil\u2019 Fatty Chang looked at the people who were standing around with disgust. \u201cI know you guys. You guys are the ones who tried to steal the credit from Uncle Lin. You guys are adults and are completely shameless. If something doesn\u2019t belong to you, you shouldn\u2019t take iit\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou little brat\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing that the Senior Professors were going to scold him, Lil\u2019 Fatty Chang went and hid behind Uncle Lin.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you guys want? Are you guys here to bully the residents of Cloud Street?\u201d Lin Fan said, looking at them annoyed.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, please don\u2019t be angry. This is just a misunderstanding. Let us just discuss the issue at hand,\u201d Professor Yang said.</p><br/><p>Alright, then let\u2019s talk about this. What\u2019s up with all the other professors here, who just came here to scold Lil\u2019 Fatty. You guys are so old and still dare to bully little kids. You guys should apologise. If you don\u2019t, I don\u2019t think we have much else to say,\u201d Lin Fan said, looking pissed.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha,\u201d Lil\u2019 Fatty Chang laughed, his face looking gleeful. \u201cYou want to bully me, you\u2019ve got to go through my Uncle Lin first.\u201d</p><br/><p>Professor Yang didn\u2019t want to drag this small issue on since it was a complete waste of time. \u201cQuickly, apologise to him.\u201d</p><br/><p>The other senior professors looked at Lil\u2019 Fatty, finally caving in, realising that apologising was the only way out.</p><br/><p>Thereafter, Lin Fan asked Lil\u2019 Fatty to play at one corner, as he turned towards the senior professors, wanting to hear what they had to say.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, we can discuss this issue now. The video has spread online and it has quite a huge impact on us. We didn\u2019t think this through well enough and we didn\u2019t discuss with you our reasons before doing it, so we hope that you won\u2019t take offense because of it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh,\u201d Lin Fan chuckled. \u201cProfessor yang, you guys are really sincere. Now that the video is out and the damage is irreversible, you still want to come to me to ask me not to take offense at al. I\u2019ll tell you guys that I am unmoved by force or persuasion. All I care about is your attitude, and so if you guys would personally apologise to me in Weibo and admit that this was your fault, I am willing to forgive you guys. As for the video online, I have no control over it, since it wasn\u2019t me who posted it, but all the same. If you wish to continue bickering, by all means.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe apology we can do, but the video has to be deleted,\u201d Professor Yang said.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you think it\u2019s possible? The video was posted by the journalists and I\u2019m only an ordinary person. How much power do you think I have over them to ask them to delete the video? I won\u2019t discuss this further. Now, apology on Weibo, and I will forgive you guys.\u201d</p><br/><p>Professor Yang\u2019s face was heavy and solemn. If they apologised, it would mean that they would admit that they were in the wrong. It almost looked ridiculous, to have a bunch of respected Senior Professors to apologise to a young person.</p><br/><p>The other Senior Professors were discussing privately at the back. There was no way that they were going to apologise, they would just be shamed and embarrassed.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, I know that you are a member of the Chinese Medicine Association, and I am rather friendly with Zhou Qing Quan. I hope that you would do this for my sake. If Zhou Qing Quan knew that you troubled us this much, it wouldn\u2019t be a very good reflection on you, and would probably even affect your career progression in the future,\u201d Professor Yang said.</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, I\u2019ll just ask you guys one thing. Before you guys came to look for me, did you try to get some inside information on me?\u201d Lin Fan looked at Professor Yang, his head tilted.</p><br/><p>Professor Yang was stunned, not understanding what Master Lin meant. What insider information? What was there to know?</p><br/><p>\u201cCome, I have Zhou Qing Quan\u2019s number here. I\u2019ll give him a call. As long as he tells me that he is on your side, I, Master Lin will not say anything else and will write off your wrongs immediately,\u201d Lin Fan said, immediately taking out his phone.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan scrolled to one of his contacts and made a call.</p><br/><p>Speaker phone.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at Professor Yang.</p><br/><p>Professor Yang looked back at Lin Fan, thereafter taking the phone from him. \u201cElder Zhou, this is Elder Yang. I\u2019m standing next to Master Lin here. Could you pass your verdict on this? This case has a huge impact on us and as long as you say that you are on our side, Master Lin says that this case would be over.\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Zhou who was far away somewhere in the Capital City, was dumbfounded when he received the call. This call was meant to accuse Master Lin of being in the wrong. How could he not know Master Lin\u2019s hidden meaning in his call?</p><br/><p>Suddenly, there was some ruckus going on on the other side of the phone.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, not good, my heart problem is acting up again\u2026ah\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPlop!\u201d</p><br/><p>The phone hung up.</p><br/><p>The people who were standing around were stunned, and Professor Yang didn\u2019t know what to say. This\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, what did you want to say just now? Otherwise, please issue a public apology on Weibo and I\u2019ll forgive you guys. If not, we can bring this before the court of law,\u201d Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlso, I, Lin Fan, bear grudges but I also treat people kindly if they do the same. With you guys defrauding me, I\u2019ll make sure you guys regret your decision all the way to the court if you don\u2019t issue an apology. I\u2019m giving you this one chance, please choose wisely. Alright, I won\u2019t say anymore, talking to you guys is a waste of time. I still have to go to the Children\u2019s Welfare Institute.\u201d Lin Fan got up, preparing to leave. This issue didn\u2019t need to be discussed, and any further discussion would have been a waste of time.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still so young, and you really want to burn so many bridges now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled, \u201cI\u2019m not afraid of that. Oh, I forgot to tell you guys that Chinese Medicine is actually my side job. My main profession is actually selling scallion pancakes. I\u2019m not scared of you guys. If you want to smother and shut me out, go ahead, as if I care.\u201d</p><br/><p>Professor Yang and the rest had never met such a rascal in their lives before who wasn\u2019t scared of anything or anyone. If Lin Fan was concerned about this Chinese Medicine career, he would have at least tried not to offend the Senior Professors, but since he didn\u2019t fear them at all, the Senior Professors couldn\u2019t do anything about it.</p><br/><p>An apology would end this. If this case went to the courts, it would cause much more complications.</p><br/><p>This may even affect the harmony of the population.</p><br/><p>If it reached to that point, their reputations would really go down the drain.</p><br/><p>\u201cApology in Weibo it is.\u201d Professor Yang thought deeply, finally making his decision.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was full of smiles, immediately going out of his shop. \u201cAlright, please do this as soon as possible, and please address me properly and say things directly, otherwise it wouldn\u2019t count. Let\u2019s hope we never cross paths against, and anyway I\u2019m too lazy to meet you guys again.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>All the other senior professors looked at Professor Yang. \u201cDo we really have to apologise?\u201d</p><br/><p>Professor Yang heaved a sigh. \u201cWhat other options do you guys have? If we really pursue this, me may come to regret it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Professor Yang had already made his decision to kill this b*stard.</p><br/><p>Completely shut out and smother him, such that he\u2019ll never be able to show his face outside ever again.</p><br/><p>For Lin Fan, this wasn\u2019t even an issue for him. If they wanted to so something, it didn\u2019t matter to him, since he barely knew them anyway.</p><br/><p>His main profession was a scallion pancake seller, and he still hadn\u2019t completed his cleaning task yet, and he was still looking for spare time to complete it.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t have time to deal with those Senior Professors b*llshit.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Weibo.</p><br/><p>Everyone was reacting in a frenzy.</p><br/><p>Professor Yang: \u201cI express my deepest apologies to Master Lin. I have caused you alot of trouble and for that I am sorry\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>A whole essay\u2026</p><br/><p>The content of the apology was rather long.</p><br/><p>With Professor Yang as their unwilling leader, all the Senior Professors didn\u2019t have a choice. It was unfortunate for them that the other party was so stubborn and didn\u2019t even fear them at all.</p><br/><p>Professor Wang: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Professor Zhang: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The netizens all started laughing as they saw what had just happened.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied on Weibo.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince you guys have apologised, I won\u2019t pursue this matter anymore. You guys are respected Senior Professors, and so I\u2019ll say one thing. You should rely on your own abilities and talents to succeed instead of taking credit for other people\u2019s work. Learn humbly and work hard to come up with your own material. Resorting to such underhand tactics won\u2019t pay off.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPff!\u201d</p><br/><p>The netizens all couldn\u2019t help but laugh. Master Lin was just too awesome.</p><br/><p>Professor Yang\u2019s face turned sour after seeing Lin Fans reply. They were people of high standing and authority and they had just been schooled by someone so young. How embarrassing!</p><br/><p>But they could only endure this shame.</p><br/><p>You win this time!</p></div>\n</div>"}

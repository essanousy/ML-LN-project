Maybe they have a staff member who has the same name as the old man. Don\u2019t you all think so?\u201d</p><br/><p>When these words were said, all the spectators burst into laughter.</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, right. That\u2019s understandable. After all, anything can happen. It\u2019s just that we might not have come across such a thing before.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha. If even that was a mistake, it would be this year\u2019s greatest joke!\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Jin\u2019s face turned greenish pale as he raged in his heart. <em>All you people who are here to watch the show aren\u2019t afraid of the consequences at all. What the heck are you all saying?</em></p><br/><p>Although that was an excuse that he could\u2019ve given, he knew that things would really get out of hand if he said that.</p><br/><p>Director Jin immediately tried to avoid the problem. \u201cMaster Lin, let\u2019s not dig any further into this. We\u2019ll transfer the money to the old man\u2019s card right now, alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shook his head. \u201cDirector Jin, I think that you should resolve this matter properly. At least give an explanation. This signature got forged all of a sudden. You guys didn\u2019t check it and even approved of it. It really is inconceivable. Could it be that there really is some kind of corruption involved?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing that, Director Jin\u2019s expression changed drastically. \u201cMaster Lin, you can\u2019t just say things like that. How could we possibly do such things, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what exactly is going on?\u201d Lin Fan pressed.</p><br/><p>Director Jin didn\u2019t know what to say momentarily.</p><br/><p>At that moment, a fifty-something-year-old man walked over from afar. When he saw this situation, he looked displeased. \u201cWhat are you all doing? Don\u2019t you know that this is an important place?\u201d</p><br/><p>When Director Jin saw him, he immediately rushed forward. \u201cLeader, you\u2019re here. Please quickly speak about the incident to Master Lin and the reporters.\u201d</p><br/><p>The leader frowned. \u201cSpeak about what? What\u2019s there to speak about? Work mistakes are very normal. Isn\u2019t it alright if we just transfer the money over? What\u2019s so difficult to understand?\u201d</p><br/><p>His tone was rather impatient as if he didn\u2019t welcome all these people here.</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan saw him, he smiled and asked, \u201cYou are\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Jin hastily introduced him, \u201cThis is our leader here, Leader Zhu.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yu Min looked at Lin Fan. \u201cMaster Lin, you should know what kind of place this is. Countless citizens have their wealth stored here. What are you all doing, bringing all these reporters over? If there\u2019s an issue, we will solve it. Since there\u2019s an issue with the money, we\u2019ll transfer the money back now. What other problem is there?\u201d</p><br/><p>A leader was a leader after all. His demeanor was strong. When he spoke, his voice was resonant. If one didn\u2019t have enough confidence, he or she would have faltered.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cAlright then. Since the leader is here, we\u2019ll ask the big leader about the signature. Who over here has such authority to sign on behalf of someone else and even approve such a thing? Was there no need for even a confirmation call?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhats signature? I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d Zhu Yu Min saw the photocopied document and immediately waved his hand. Then, he turned to Director Jin. \u201cHas the matter been settled yet?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been settled. We just have to transfer the money to the old man\u2019s card,\u201d said Director Jin.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s settled then it\u2019s fine, isn\u2019t it? What other problem could there be? Alright, everyone, hurry up and leave. Don\u2019t stay here any longer.\u201d Zhu Yu Min waved his hand impatiently. He had seen such incidents before. Every time people came, he usually wouldn\u2019t have to personally show up. Most of the time, they would think of ways to settle it very quickly.</p><br/><p>This time, although it was a little troublesome because of Master Lin\u2019s involvement, what could possibly happen? This was their territory. How could others behave as they liked here?</p><br/><p>Lin Fan furrowed his brows. \u201cWhat we want to know now is who signed this signature.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yu Min was very impatient. \u201cI don\u2019t know who signed it. If you keep making a scene here, I\u2019ll call the police. And do you still want the money or not? The mistake has already been made. Are you so unwilling to forgive us?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan glanced at Zhu Yu Min and couldn\u2019t help but laugh. \u201cCould it be that you signed it? Judging by your physiognomy, you are quite greedy.\u201d</p><br/><p>When the reporters heard this, they were stunned.</p><br/><p>Master Lin was really ferocious, to be able to say such a thing so bluntly.</p><br/><p>When Zhu Yu Min heard that, he was instantly enraged. \u201cDon\u2019t accuse others like that. Hurry up and leave. Where\u2019s the security?\u201d</p><br/><p>The security guards who hadn\u2019t known what to do at first saw this and had only one option. They immediately rushed forward. Since the leader at spoken, they had to obey.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan hadn\u2019t expected the leader to be so fierce and his temper to be so explosive. But it was good too. Now, they had matched themselves against each other.</p><br/><p>\u201cRight now, either we transfer the money to him or you continue making a ruckus here and I call the police,\u201d said Zhu Yu Min.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan patted the old man\u2019s shoulder. \u201cGo. Get the money transferred to your card.\u201d</p><br/><p>When the old man heard that, he nodded.</p><br/><p>Director Jin saw this and laughed in his heart. He felt that this problem was too simple for his leader. This Master Lin was awesome but even he would get suppressed easily by the leader.</p><br/><p>Very soon, the transfer was done.</p><br/><p>The old man was in a very good mood after getting his money. He grabbed onto Lin Fan\u2019s arm full of gratitude.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright. This matter has been resolved. Hurry up and go then,\u201d said Zhu Yu Min impatiently.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan asked, \u201cAre you really not going to give an explanation for the signature?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yu Min turned around. \u201cWhat explanation? This was just a work mistake. What\u2019s there to explain?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, there\u2019s no hurry. I\u2019ll inquire slowly.\u201d Lin Fan knew that this matter wouldn\u2019t be resolved so quickly. Then, he turned to the old man. \u201cOld man, go home first.\u201d</p><br/><p>The old man looked at Lin Fan and asked, \u201cWhat about you, youngster?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. \u201cI should go too. All that\u2019s left is for justice to prevail.\u201d</p><br/><p>The old man didn\u2019t quite understand. But he nodded and then left.</p><br/><p>The reporters had been recording the whole scene. They felt that this leader was rude and unreasonable. It seemed that they would have to expose this incident.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright. My dear reporters, do what you have to do when you go back. Go on then,\u201d said Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>The reporters didn\u2019t know what Master Lin\u2019s hidden meaning was but they nodded as well. Then, they all left.</p><br/><p>After the reporters left, Lin Fan left too.</p><br/><p>Director Jin immediately went forward and started to suck up to the leader. \u201cThe leader always has a plan after all.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Yu Min glanced at him. \u201cIf you encounter such situations in future, don\u2019t give way. The more you give way, the more they will pursue.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, yes. Leader is right,\u201d said Director Jin quickly.</p><br/><p>When the leader spoke, he had to listen. And to him, it had really been useful. The Internet often talked about how awesome this Master Lin was, but now, Director Jin felt that he wasn\u2019t that great.</p><br/><p>With a few words from the leader, Master Lin had been forced to retreat and was out of options.</p></div>\n</div>"}

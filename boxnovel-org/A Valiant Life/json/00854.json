Initially, he would never let such things happen. However, this guy with the surname Lin was right, he had been taking bribes.</p><br/><p>After taking the money, he felt that this was something that was pretty hard to do. However, after investigating, he realized that this Jin Shan Ping\u2019s parents were divorced and they were also foreigners. Naturally, he did not fear the situation anymore.</p><br/><p>Getting rid of one family was easy. So much so that getting rid of some other of the poor families from this school was pretty easy as well.</p><br/><p>Especially since there started being demonstrations after that and the students were protesting. That made his life even easier.</p><br/><p>He did not really care even if the situation blew up. He had already thought of his excuse to tell others. This student had an individual problem which has caused a lot of objections from the large majority of the student body. In order to give the large majority of the students a better learning environment, he had no choice but to expel the student.</p><br/><p>Although this could possibly have some issues, he was just going to say it anyway.</p><br/><p>However, he never thought that after this situation occurred, the busybody from Cloud Street, Master Lin, would actually come to this school and get into a heated argument with them.</p><br/><p>Unbearable, it is simply unbearable.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Lin Fan\u2019s gazed shifted to the rowdy students and said, \u201cI\u2019m giving you guys a chance right now. Immediately disband and stop making all this noise. Whether or not Jin Shan Ping can study at this school is not up to you pieces of trash to decide, understood?\u201d</p><br/><p>The rowdy students heard this and one by one all became furious.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck you, what are you trying to say?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho do you think you are?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck, this is the first time I\u2019ve wanted to beat someone up so much.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou really are dogsh*t.\u201d</p><br/><p>The rowdy students frantically cursed him in rage.</p><br/><p>Then, the headmaster stepped up, he was controlling his anger as he said, \u201cMaster Lin, please leave our school grounds. This is a decision the school board has come to and is not for you to decide. I hope that you will quickly leave.\u201d</p><br/><p>The rowdy students all shouted loudly, \u201cThat\u2019s right. This is our school\u2019s issue, why is an outsider like you caring so much? Quickly get out of here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jin Shan Ping, who was standing next to Lin Fan, had an enormous change in her expression. She had received a deep amount of attack to her and her heart was already filled with despair.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan couldn\u2019t take it anymore. He immediately shoved the headmaster aside and then turned his eyes to this group of fierce-looking and easy to hate students and then angrily said, \u201cYou pieces of trash, I really just want to beat all of you guys up.\u201d</p><br/><p>The students could not take it after hearing that.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck, who do you think you are? Wanting to beat us up. Whether you believe it or not, we are going to make you unable to leave the school grounds.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan beckoned and said, \u201cGood, come, all of you, come at me. Take a look if I\u2019d beat you guys to a pulp.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck, who\u2019s afraid of you,\u201d one of the tall students angrily rushed up to him. Looking at his build, he looked like he frequently played basketball. Right now, they were all trying to get Lin Fan to leave the school. They didn\u2019t know what this b*stard was trying to do, being such a huge busybody.</p><br/><p>They did not think it was even possible that all of them could be afraid of this one guy.</p><br/><p>Then, at this moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, where are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone\u2019s gaze shifted into the distance.</p><br/><p>The silhouette of a group of people appeared in the distance. These were the people who had seen the posts on Weibo and rushed all the way down here. They were all from Shanghai.</p><br/><p>With regards to this issue, they were all very angry and did not agree with it. In their eyes, this group of brats was really too much. They were way too different from the love-filled days back when they were in university.</p><br/><p>The group of people came to Master Lin\u2019s side and looked at the group of students who were holding the banner. All of them with angry looks on their faces.</p><br/><p>One of the big sized men burst out in anger. He rolled his sleeve up and pointed at the students and scolded them. \u201cYou pieces of trash. What are you guys trying to do? Bully other people?\u201d</p><br/><p>The rest of them also joined in the scolding. It was very clear that they were all furious. But of course, when they saw Jin Shan Ping, they were a little taken aback, thinking that she was really a little scary. However, after making mental preparations, they were not that scared anymore.</p><br/><p>However, they knew that this situation was not easy to solve. They were outsiders so even if they made some noise today, then what about tomorrow and the next few days?</p><br/><p>It was simply not practical for them to just keep coming down to the school every day.</p><br/><p>If they wanted to deal with this issue, they had to tackle the root cause.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan saw that so many people had some and rushed to say, \u201cOkay, everyone relax. Today, we are here to settle this situation. Although we have no relation to this issue, but since we happened to find out about it, we couldn\u2019t just sit back and watch. What is happening to her today might happen to us in the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Master Lin is right. As long as we have the capability to help, we can\u2019t just sit back and watch.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis group of brats is really easy to loathe. How can they be university students? In my eyes, they aren\u2019t even at the level of primary school students. At least primary school students have respect.\u201d</p><br/><p>In the face of so many people, the rowdy students were starting to dread this situation,</p><br/><p>When the headmaster saw this situation, he rushed to shout, \u201cWhere are the security guards? Where have the security guards gone? Quickly call the police. These people are trespassing on school grounds, they should all be arrested.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the headmaster and said, \u201cLet me ask you, is it a must for you to expel her?\u201d</p><br/><p>The headmaster replied, \u201cThis is the conclusion that the school\u2019s discussion came to. Please leave the school right now, if not, we\u2019ll have to call the police.\u201d</p><br/><p>Amongst the rowdy students, some of them were filled with resentment and immediately took their phones out and said, \u201cEveryone, report this to the police and let them come over and arrest them. They came here to our school, made noise and even wanted to attack us.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, call the police. We have to call the police.\u201d</p><br/><p>The surrounding students were also furious in that moment. They said, \u201cThis group of b*stards are actually too shameless. F*ck, this is unbelievable!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI was actually friends with them before. Such an embarrassment.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSh*t, I really regret this. If I had known earlier, I wouldn\u2019t have come to this school.\u201d</p><br/><p>As the situation became more and more agitated.</p><br/><p>Han Yan did not think that there would be so many people who would come and protect this incomparably ugly girl. She became furious and couldn\u2019t take it anymore. She shouted, \u201cIf she isn\u2019t expelled, then we will drop out!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. We will drop out. If you want her, then we\u2019ll leave. If you want us then she\u2019ll have to leave.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHeadmaster, we request that you expel her.\u201d</p><br/><p>The rowdy students were all extremely stubborn and did not want to back down.</p><br/><p>At the same time, there were some people inside who liked the drama, who was making some noise also.</p><br/><p>To them, seeing other people\u2019s pain made them feel very blissful.</p><br/><p>As for whether Jin Ping Shan has distracted them or not, they did not care about that at all. Anyway, even if they were not playing around in the dormitories, they would be playing around outside, thus they would not even see her much during the school term.</p><br/><p>However, since everyone was making noise, they definitely wanted to make some noise as well.</p><br/><p>They were probably just following the opinions of the majority.</p><br/><p>In any case, there were so many people. What could the school possibly do to them?</p><br/><p>Furthermore, the headmaster was on their side so they had nothing to fear.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was so angry that the pit of his stomach was hurting. He really wanted to do something about it and beat this group of b*stards to death.</p></div>\n</div>"}

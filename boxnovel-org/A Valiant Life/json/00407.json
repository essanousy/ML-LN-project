He was a little displeased but this situation had been caused by them and they weren\u2019t able to resolve it at the moment, so he could only let this Chinese doctor resolve it. However, he didn\u2019t have faith in the Chinese doctor.</p><br/><p>Wang Li Li\u2019s mother was very anxious at that moment. \u201cDirector Zhang, will she be okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Zhang nodded. \u201cThis is Director Zhao Ming Qing from Shanghai\u2019s First Chinese Medical Academy. His medical abilities are superb. He\u2019s at the pinnacle of the Chinese Medicine world and he\u2019s well-known in the nation\u2019s Chinese medical scene.\u201d</p><br/><p>When the reporters heard this, they etched it into their memories. Some of the reporters even started thinking of headlines to write.</p><br/><p>\u2018The best of Chinese and Western medicine go head to head.\u2019</p><br/><p>ETC!</p><br/><p>Madam Wang looked at Zhao Ming Qing, \u201cMaster Zhao, I\u2019ll leave my daughter to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing nodded. \u201cI need four men. Come here and hold her limbs down. Don\u2019t let her move.</p><br/><p>Very soon, four muscular men appeared and held down Wang Li Li\u2019s limbs, pressing them down onto the bed so that she wouldn\u2019t move. With Zhao Ming Qing\u2019s medical ability, there was no need to remove her clothing. He had a firm understanding of the location of each acupuncture point.</p><br/><p>He pressed onto Wang Li Li\u2019s abdomen through her clothing with one hand, then, he picked up a silver needle and aimed it at the acupuncture point. According to his teacher\u2019s instruction, he placed the needle into her body with great accuracy.</p><br/><p>Specialist Chang didn\u2019t quite believe in the effectiveness of acupuncture. In his eyes, things like acupuncture points in Chinese medicine were simply unproven by science. Although there were now numerous theses that verified the existence of acupuncture points, there was no concrete evidence. Hence, he scoffed at such methods of treatment.</p><br/><p>When Zhao Ming Qing pierced the needle into her skin, everyone held their breaths in as if waiting for a miracle to happen.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing\u2019s expression was stern. He didn\u2019t dare to be careless. He knew the locations of these three acupuncture points but he didn\u2019t know the relationship between them. However, he trusted his teacher and he knew his teacher was trying to teach him something.</p><br/><p>The second needle went in. Wang Li Li evidently calmed down. She was no longer in so much pain. This made everyone cry out in shock.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, it looks like it really was effective.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, just now, Wang Li Li was squirming in pain but now it seems like she\u2019s no longer hurting.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow mystical. This is the first time I\u2019ve seen Chinese medicine\u2019s acupuncture. I didn\u2019t use to believe in it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing began to put in the third needle. Wang Li Li, who had still been struggling a little, suddenly stopped completely. Her expression was calm once again as if the pain had disappeared.</p><br/><p>After observing her for a moment, Zhao Ming Qing kept the unused needles.</p><br/><p>\u201cDirector Zhao, why did those three seemingly normal needles make the patient\u2019s pain go away? What kind of secret is hidden behind all this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing had already received instructions from Lin fan. He said, \u201cThe patient consumed porridge just now. Porridge is a great food that provides nutrients for people in weak states. However, this patient is suffering from severe anorexia and her stomach region has already atrophied long ago. With the stimulation of the porridge, the stomach becomes like a balloon, leaking gas and contracting profusely. If this isn\u2019t alleviated in time, it might even cost her life.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh\u2026\u201d The reporters nodded. Suddenly, a reporter recalled something. \u201cMaster Lin talked about this issue just now too but Specialist Chang didn\u2019t listen.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, Master Lin said that consuming porridge would be a problem. I never thought that it would really be true. Could it be that Master Lin knows Chinese medicine too?\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, Director Zhang looked at Master Lin, wondering how Master Lin had known this.</p><br/><p>Specialist Chang\u2019s expression was getting a little ugly. Especially after causing a problem in front of so many reporters and then having it resolved by a Chinese doctor, it made him very displeased.</p><br/><p>At that moment, he explained himself, \u201cEveryone, this kind of situation happens once in a while. We, the specialist group, wanted to see just how resistant the patient is towards food. We didn\u2019t expect this kind of thing to happen. We have also obtained some accurate data and we\u2019ve developed the early stages of our plan to treat her. Although the stomach contraction was resolved by this Director Zhao, we would\u2019ve been able to tackle it quickly as well by checking her, finding the cause and administering the relevant medicine. Hence, it\u2019s not that our Western medicine cannot solve the problem. Don\u2019t you agree, Director Zhang?\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporters aimed their cameras at Director Zhang. Director Zhang had been put in a tough spot. He was basically being forced to agree. If he didn\u2019t, he would be degrading Western medicine. Moreover, he didn\u2019t know how the reporters would report what he said. He smiled and said, \u201cWhat Specialist Chang said is true. Chinese and Western medicine should be used together. They each have their pros and cons. Therefore, there is nothing to compare. The patient\u2019s condition has been stabilized. Next up, the specialist group will be discussing the next step in the treatment. I believe it will have a positive outcome.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan stood amongst the crowd and didn\u2019t say anything. He wasn\u2019t here this time to scold anyone. He was really just here to look at the situation. It was only after seeing the situation that he could understand it.</p><br/><p>Also, he understood that sufferers of severe anorexia had rather weak stomachs. Hence, when prescribing medicine, this had to be taken into account.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Zhao Ming Qing saw his teacher\u2019s eyes and then he nodded. Lin Fan was telling him to leave this place for the moment. He had something to tell him.</p><br/><p>As of now, the patient\u2019s condition had stabilized and there wouldn\u2019t be any more news for the reporters to report. What happened before, to them, were already very big news topics.</p><br/><p>Outside the hospital.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing stood respectfully by Lin Fan\u2019s side. Lin Fan asked casually, \u201cDo you know what categories anorexia is divided into?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing nodded. \u201cTeacher, according to my knowledge, there are three types of anorexia. The first is stagnation. Due to not consuming food for a long period of time, one loses his or her appetite.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe second type is asthenia of the spleen. Due to the spleen being in a bad state, the asthenia occurs, causing symptoms of chest pain and vomiting.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe third type is a deficiency of Yin in the spleen and stomach. Due to consuming large amounts of spicy and hot foods, the Yin is affected, causing dry mouth and throat and immense thirst. It will also cause one to slim down and become jittery.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis has been a terrifying disease in recent years. It has many causes, such as extreme dieting as well as psychological pressure and stress. It is a kind of psychological illness. Back in our time, it was an inconceivable illness.\u201d Zhao Ming Qing sighed.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled and said, \u201cOf course. In the past, we didn\u2019t even have enough to eat, how could we even think about dieting? But according to studies, severe cases of anorexia are mostly caused by extreme dieting. As for those cases caused by stress, they mostly recover after receiving early treatment.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing nodded. \u201cTeacher, do we need to research about anorexia?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cDo you have any effective methods to treat anorexia?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing shook his head. \u201cNo, I can only prescribe medicine to support the patient and slowly nurse the patient. As for that patient that we saw just now, I\u2019ve never seen someone in her condition. It is already much too severe.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. \u201cAlright, you\u2019ve been my disciple for a while now. This time, with anorexia as the topic, we\u2019ll begin our research to tackle it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing was startled. He was stunned for a moment, then he asked, \u201cTeacher, are you going to do research to tackle anorexia?\u201d</p><br/><p>When he said this, he was in disbelief.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at Zhao Ming Qing and said, \u201cWhat? Could it be that you think it\u2019s not possible?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing immediately shook his head and replied, \u201cNo, I believe Teacher will definitely have a solution.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, let\u2019s go to your academy. We\u2019ll borrow your research room to conduct our research. During this time, I\u2019ll need you to accompany me and put in some hard work,\u201d said Lin Fan with a smile. He had an idea of the medications that should be used to treat anorexia but this wasn\u2019t the time to show off. Moreover, since Zhao Ming Qing had already become his disciple, he decided to give it a try using Chinese medicine.</p><br/><p>If he solved this problem immediately just like that, it would be meaningless and it wouldn\u2019t be of any use to Zhao Ming Qing too.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

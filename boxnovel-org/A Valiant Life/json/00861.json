If the severely burned female student really regained her looks, it was going to shock the whole world.</p><br/><p>Then, Lin Fan walked out lethargically. He didn\u2019t expect that there were so many people waiting outside. He smiled, \u201cDid you guys wait for a long time?\u201d</p><br/><p>The crowd felt like he had failed since Master Lin walked out of the surgical theatre alone.</p><br/><p>To the doctors, they felt that it was expected since it was theoretically impossible. The chances of a miracle were slim.</p><br/><p>However, the reporters didn\u2019t care about that.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-2\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, how is Jin Shan Ping?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDid she regain her looks?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporters kept asking questions. They wanted to know the final outcome regardless of whether he succeeded. It was going to be a breaking news. Based on their close relationship with Master Lin, they definitely wouldn\u2019t write bad stuff about him if he had failed. They would probably just criticise him a little.</p><br/><p>Master Lin was really nice to them and they couldn\u2019t bear to let Master Lin lose face.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh!\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly, a girl\u2019s voice could be heard in the surgical theatre. She sounded happy but shocked.</p><br/><p>The reporters and doctors\u2019 hearts skipped a beat when they heard that. Did something go wrong?</p><br/><p>Perhaps the surgery failed badly and Jin Shan Ping broke down because she couldn\u2019t accept it.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan turned around and smiled. \u201cYou can go in and have a look.\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-3\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>The reporters and doctors immediately rushed in after hearing that.</p><br/><p>In the surgical theatre.</p><br/><p>Jin Shan Ping sat on the floor motionlessly. She was stunned after looking at her flawless face. Her face was filled with tears and she looked as if she had lost her mind.</p><br/><p>Her looks had been regained. They really had been regained.</p><br/><p>She probably wouldn\u2019t want to forget how she looked like. It was the first time she had smiled so happily after the incident three years ago.</p><br/><p>*cries*</p><br/><p>She sobbed uncontrollably.</p><br/><p>She was ecstatic. She couldn\u2019t handle her emotions and that was why she cried. She didn\u2019t expect her looks to be regained and she could be a normal person in the future.</p><br/><p>She wouldn\u2019t be despised by others anymore.</p><br/><p>She could make friends and go out with them to taste delicious food. She wouldn\u2019t be mocked by people anymore. Also, she wouldn\u2019t have to wear a mask and sunglasses anymore as well. She didn\u2019t have to worry about scaring people again.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was really happy. He realized that a higher percentage of his Encyclopedic task had been completed.</p><br/><p>However, he still needed to press on.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-4\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>As for this incident, it was over. He wanted to leave it as it is.</p><br/><p>Although it was going to shock the world, he wasn\u2019t afraid at all. What could people do to him about it?</p><br/><p>The doctors and reporters rushed into the surgical theatre and they found Jin Shan Ping sitting on the floor motionlessly. She had her head lowered and her long hair covered her face. They were heartbroken.</p><br/><p>Then, they looked at the bloody gauze on the operating table and they felt that he must have failed.</p><br/><p>She probably looked even scarier after her burned flesh was being operated on. Also, it was easy to spread bacteria and diseases.</p><br/><p>The doctors sighed. It looked like Godly Doctor Lin didn\u2019t make it too.</p><br/><p>After all, it wasn\u2019t something logical.</p><br/><p>The reporters went to Jin Shan Ping and a female reporter empathized with her, \u201cStudent Jin, don\u2019t be too\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere is Master Lin?\u201d Jin Shan Ping raised her head and the female reporter was stunned. She discontinued her sentence.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow could it be\u2026\u201d The female reporter opened her eyes wider and was in disbelief.</p><br/><p>When the others saw Jin Shan Ping\u2019s face, they felt that the world had changed.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026 Who are you?\u201d A reporter stuttered. Then, he looked around, \u201cWhere did Jin Shan Ping go?\u201d</p><br/><p>They didn\u2019t believe this good-looking female was Jin Shan Ping. Even if they were beaten to death, they wouldn\u2019t believe it too.</p><br/><p>However, her clothes and hairdo were exactly the same as Jin Shan Ping.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-5\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cI am Jin Shan Ping. Where is Master Lin?\u201d Jin Shan Ping really wanted to kneel down and thank Master Lin. Master Lin gave her a new life.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are Jin Shan Ping?\u201d</p><br/><p>All of them were in disbelief.</p><br/><p>After being shocked, they went wild. The reporters felt that everything they had witnessed was fake. It was so unbelievable.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you really Jin Shan Ping? The student that got her face burned?\u201d The doctors were also in disbelief. The Director went forward to touch Jin Shan Ping\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>After touching it, he looked even more shocked.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow could it be? Her skin is like that of a newborn baby. How could she recover from such serious burns?\u201d The Director was stunned. Then, he grabbed Jin Shan Ping\u2019s wrist. \u201cWhat did Godly Doctor Lin do to you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jin Shan Ping was really emotional. She didn\u2019t know how to reply the Director.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Master Lin asked me to lie on the operating table. Then, I was unconscious. When I woke up, Master Lin wasn\u2019t here anymore and my face became like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>When the Director heard that, he didn\u2019t know what to say at all.</p><br/><p>This was his hospital and there was nobody else in the surgical theatre. He really thought that Master Lin swapped her with someone else. However, he could guarantee that the person in front of her was indeed Jin Shan Ping.</p><br/><p>The other doctors were dumbfounded. They were speechless. If they didn\u2019t witness it with their own eyes, it was really hard to believe.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn!\u201d</p><br/><p>A reporter gasped. \u201cIt\u2019s breaking news. Do you think anyone would believe it if we reported this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t they believe it? The victim is just here. What else do they need to believe it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWait, where is Master Lin? Did anyone stop him from leaving?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Master Lin just told us to come in and have a look. I think everyone just rushed in.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSh*t. If Master Lin really left, it\u2019d be over. Let\u2019s rush to Cloud Street. If this matter were to be reported, it would definitely cause a huge impact.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jin Shan Ping really wanted to see Master Lin. She wanted to thank him. To her, Master Lin had given her a new life.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go to Cloud Street now. Given Master Lin\u2019s personality, I think he might be hiding now.\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporters knew all about Lin Fan. They knew that he wouldn\u2019t appear on Cloud Street right after a groundbreaking event.</p><br/><p>However, they had to look for him regardless of the situation now.</p><br/><p>Because this matter was really too shocking.</p><br/><p>The Director looked at the reporters, \u201cI\u2019ll follow all of you.\u201d Then, he looked at the doctors around him, \u201cJust stay in the hospital and carry on working.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh?\u201d The doctors wanted to take a look too. However, they were stunned after hearing what the Director said.</p><br/><p>They were really curious too.</p></div>\n</div>"}

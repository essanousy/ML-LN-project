After being a host for so many years, he never experienced anything like this before.</p><br/><p>He only thought of one thing.</p><br/><p>It was that Master Lin was really powerful.</p><br/><p>He did not even manage to count how many titles Master Lin mentioned.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan realised that everyone in the crowd was smiling. Then, he said firmly, \u201cActually, whatever I just said was real. Please don\u2019t think I\u2019m joking.\u201d</p><br/><p>The crowd thought that Master Lin was going to say that whatever he said earlier was fake. However, they were shocked to see that Master Lin actually said everything was real with such a firm tone.</p><br/><p>At the seats.</p><br/><p>Papa Lin\u2019s face turned red. \u201cThis chap, how could he joke about these things at such a grand event? Sigh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The audience was filled with respectable individuals and elders and it was not appropriate to crack jokes like this.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang smiled, \u201cUncle, he\u2019s not kidding.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you serious? How could that be real?\u201d Papa Lin said in disbelief. He wondered why he did not know anything at all.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang said seriously, \u201cUncle, it\u2019s really true.\u201d</p><br/><p>Papa Lin was stunned at how serious Wang Ming Yang looked. He did not know what to say anymore. He still did not believe it.</p><br/><p>On the Internet.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, Master Lin is acting like he is a really powerful person at such a grand event. Isn\u2019t he scared that a lightning bolt would strike him and turn him into a vegetable?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, a lightning bolt? Master Lin has never been afraid of these things before.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha, that\u2019s hilarious. Look at the expression on the elders\u2019 face, they seem to be completely stunned by what Master Lin said. They\u2019re probably wondering if what Master Lin said was true.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s obviously true. Everyone knows that Master Lin doesn\u2019t lie.\u201d</p><br/><p>The host tried to think of an answer to reduce the awkwardness on stage.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, your contributions to the society and the world are remarkable. You saved countless people by curing terminal illnesses like leukemia, AIDS, etc.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan remained silent for a moment before replying, \u201cActually, I have to thank my disciple too. Zhao Ming Qing, the director of Shanghai Chinese Medical Academy. His passion for Chinese medicine really spurred our research. As his mentor, we worked together to eradicate these illnesses. If not for him, I would not have been able to do it so quickly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing was stunned after hearing that. He did not expect his mentor to praise him at a grand event like this.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Zhao Ming Qing\u2019s family members were watching the event on TV.</p><br/><p>His only daughter and three sons were accompanying his wife, Zhao Shi, as they watched the television together.</p><br/><p>Zhao Shi said, \u201cLook, remember when you thought Master Lin was a conman? Look at how things are like now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMum, how could we have known about this back then? He\u2019s such a young chap and we did not want him to cheat our dad.\u201d</p><br/><p>They felt a little embarrassed as they thought about what happened in the past.</p><br/><p>Their father managed to be so successful because he had been learning a lot from Master Lin.</p><br/><p>Thankfully their father was determined and did not listen to what they said. If not, his father\u2019s achievements would not have been possible.</p><br/><p>The camera turned to Zhao Ming Qing.</p><br/><p>It was the first time that he appeared on TV.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan\u2019s fans knew this elderly man was Master Lin\u2019s disciple, who managed to become so successful because of Master Lin.</p><br/><p>The host continued to facilitate the flow of the programmes and the award ceremony was about to begin.</p><br/><p>The netizens did not know what award was to be given and they were looking forward to it.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you think Master Lin would be awarded with?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA Good Citizen Award?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c^ are you stupid? I feel like hitting you with a hammer for saying that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, how about a \u2018Outstanding Medical Skills\u2019 award?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c^ please give me your address. I really want to hit you with a hammer.\u201d</p><br/><p>The netizens discussed about it enthusiastically and all of them were wondering what Master Lin was going to be awarded with. After all, nothing was leaked to the public.</p><br/><p>Everyone was guessing what it could be.</p><br/><p>However, they knew that it was not going to be a simple award. After all, there were many important elders around and if it was a simple award, they would not even be invited to this event.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan stood on stage and waited patiently. After all, he loved receiving awards and he wanted to fill the entire wall in his shop with awards.</p><br/><p>Now that a grand award was to be given to him, he was really excited about it.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang was also very anxious about it. If he had known what award Master Lin was going to receive, he would not have been this anxious. However, the fact that he did not know it made him really anxious.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan sat there with the others and they were discussing about it softly.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you think Brother Lin will get?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Xu whispered, \u201cIt has to be a grand prize. If not, why would it be so grand?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yun Xue Yao rushed over from Haojiang to witness this moment. Although she was not the one receiving the prize, she was even more anxious about it than Lin Fan. It was as if she was the one receiving the prize.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Lin\u2019s award is definitely not an ordinary one.\u201d</p><br/><p>Just as the crowd was discussing among themselves, the host started to explain the reasons for the award and what it entailed. Finally, he reached the most important part.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn order to recognise Master Lin for his outstanding achievements, we will be awarding him with a timeless award for being the most remarkable individual in the whole of China. Let\u2019s invite\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>When the netizens heard that, they were still wondering what it was about since they did not hear anything about this award before.</p><br/><p>However, when they heard who was going to be invited to give the award, they were stunned.</p><br/><p>The netizens were stunned speechless.</p><br/><p>\u201cWow, that\u2019s crazy. I didn\u2019t expect \u2018The Great\u2019 to be giving it out.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, he can probably brag about it for the rest of his life.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough I don\u2019t know what this award is, it has to be an extraordinary one since \u2018The Great\u2019 is the one giving it out.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis. Is. Crazy.\u201d</p><br/><p>The netizens spammed the entire chatroom and the screen was filled with words. Furthermore, Weibo was bombarded with a lot of new articles.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable that \u2018The Great\u2019 is the one presenting the award.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe prize presenter is\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Those that did not watch the livestream were stunned after realising that Weibo suddenly went wild. However, as they found out about it, they were dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>Nobody expected this to happen. The person presenting the prize was a really respectable elder.</p><br/><p>Papa Lin was so emotional that he held onto his chest as his face turned red. He even had the urge to stand up and shout but he resisted it.</p><br/><p>He had to remain calm.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was also stunned when he heard that \u2018The Great\u2019 was going to be the one presenting the award to him.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

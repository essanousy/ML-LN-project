Then, he looked up at Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Lin, what are you going to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>Under his gaze, Lin Fan stood up. His expression was very stern. It was as if he was about to go into battle.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat else am I going to do? Of course I\u2019m going to Beijing. If I say I\u2019m going to crush them, I\u2019m going to crush them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was fearless. This incident had made him furious. In the past, the Shanghai association had been in shambles. Now, it had slowly developed and, after the Kunlun Mountain incident, it had suddenly become popular.</p><br/><p>This wasn\u2019t just due to Lin Fan\u2019s efforts. It was also the effort of the whole Shanghai association.</p><br/><p>Now that the headquarters had given the order to transfer President Niu away and have someone else to take over, weren\u2019t they just leeching off of the Shanghai association\u2019s efforts?</p><br/><p>Lin Fan knew about the situation at the Beijing association. If he were to quarrel with them on Weibo, it would only make President Niu feel pressured and he would resign in the end.</p><br/><p>If that were to happen, they would be taken advantage of by the Beijing association.</p><br/><p>Hence, at this moment, Lin Fan had to use his overbearing hands and quick feet to go over to the Beijing association to see what exactly was going on over there.</p><br/><p>If they really were so impudent, he would crush them.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Lin, don\u2019t be rash,\u201d Zhao Zhong Yang shouted anxiously. He believed that Brother Lin would really crush them if he said he would. He definitely hadn\u2019t just said it casually on the Internet.</p><br/><p>\u201cLook after the shop. I may not be back tonight.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan threw those words out before leaving the shop and driving off.</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang looked at Fraud Tian helplessly. \u201cFraud, why didn\u2019t you try and stop him?\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian blinked a few times. \u201cWhat use would that be?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang was momentarily lost for words. They really wouldn\u2019t be able to stop him even if they tried.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan covered her mouth as she laughed. She wasn\u2019t bothered by this. But to Zhao Zhong Yang, this wasn\u2019t the time to laugh. He didn\u2019t even know what to say anymore.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. Brother Lin knows what he\u2019s doing. After so long, have you ever seen Brother Lin act rashly?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan spoke with a smile. She had been with Lin Fan for so long. She felt that this matter would definitely be resolved perfectly.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow has he never acted rashly?\u201d As Zhao Zhong Yang thought about some of Brother Lin\u2019s past events, he felt that Brother Lin had never considered the outcome of his actions.</p><br/><p>In the past, when he hacked the Internet, he had spent a month in prison.</p><br/><p>Then, Zhao Zhong Yang went to the entrance and saw a car driving off into the distance.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis time, the Beijing association is seriously screwed,\u201d said Zhao Zhong Yang with a sigh. He didn\u2019t know what to say anymore.</p><br/><p>The Shanghai association.</p><br/><p>As Jiang Fei looked at the news on Weibo, especially the argument between President Lin and the Beijing association, his expression changed dramatically.</p><br/><p>\u201cPresident Lin is going to crush the Beijing association\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Yun Jie was startled as he looked at Jiang Fei. \u201cHow can that be? President Lin can\u2019t be that rash.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Fei shook his head. \u201cTake a look at his Weibo. They\u2019re already arguing there.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Yun Jie took a look, then looked up. \u201cIt can\u2019t be, can it? Maybe President Lin is just saying this to vent his anger.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you think that\u2019s possible?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEr\u2026\u201d Wang Yun Jie swallowed his saliva. To him, President Lin was unpredictable. In the past, before President Lin had become famous, he had beaten up all of them in the association office.</p><br/><p>As for now, his temper definitely hadn\u2019t changed. He might really be going to crush the Beijing association.</p><br/><p>If the Beijing association were to respond nicely, perhaps it would be fine. But if they were to have a bad attitude, things would really turn out terribly.</p><br/><p>On the Internet. Weibo.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn. Could Master Lin really be going to crush the Beijing association? There are crouching tigers and hidden dragons over there. There are lots of experts. If he goes alone, won\u2019t he get bullied to death?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c^You must be dreaming. Crouching tigers and hidden dragons? I think they\u2019re just a bunch of snakes and rats. Don\u2019t you know about Master Lin\u2019s strength? He could probably send them flying with a single kick.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c^How can you call them snakes and rats? You should be calling them shrimp soldiers and crab generals*.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c^Brothers, you\u2019re both idiots. Your language teachers will probably die early.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe. He\u2019s just shooting his mouth. Do you really think he would dare to go to Beijing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. The Beijing association isn\u2019t afraid of him. They\u2019re clearly not even bothered by this.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, Lin Fan\u2019s Weibo was updated.</p><br/><p>No words were said.</p><br/><p>It was just a picture of an airplane ticket.</p><br/><p>And the destination was Beijing.</p><br/><p>When the netizens saw this, they completely lost it.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn. Is he trying to f*cking defy nature?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMotherf*cker. He\u2019s really going. Must he be so fierce? Isn\u2019t it just a normal online argument? Is there a need to go to this extent?.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou must all be new. Who do you think Master Lin is? Whenever there\u2019s a conflict, he would definitely treat it very seriously.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis time, the Beijing association will have to kneel. If they don\u2019t, I\u2019ll broadcast myself eating sh*t.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho would still dare to quarrel with this Lin in the future? Just because of a disagreement, he went to buy a ticket to fly to Beijing. This is going to be huge.\u201d</p><br/><p>To the netizens, this had become quite a big deal.</p><br/><p>They had initially thought that Master Lin was just talking big. Perhaps Master Lin was only going to quarrel with the Beijing association on Weibo and it would be resolved in the end.</p><br/><p>But who would have thought that Master Lin would buy an airplane ticket after one disagreement? And he had even posted it on Weibo. He was telling everyone that he was already going there and that they should prepare themselves for it.</p><br/><p>The Beijing association.</p><br/><p>The person who managed their Weibo account looked totally calm. He hadn\u2019t been bothered by the argument with Master Lin.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis Shanghai association Vice-President actually dares to be so impudent to the headquarters. Who do you think gave him his appointment? It wasn\u2019t given by us. He\u2019s really unbecoming of a Vice-President.\u201d</p><br/><p>The other man laughed. \u201cLook. He\u2019s saying that he\u2019s coming to Beijing to crush us. Who on Earth gave him the courage to\u2026to\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Before he could finish, he suddenly stopped. His eyes widened as he stared at his phone in disbelief.</p><br/><p>The colleague next to him couldn\u2019t help but laugh. Then, he asked curiously, \u201cWhy are you stuttering?\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly, a cry of shock rang out.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, is this guy trying to defy nature?\u201d That person shot up from his seat with a look of disbelief on his face.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat exactly is going on? Did something happen?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLook at this.\u201d That man immediately passed his phone over.</p><br/><p>When the other man saw the picture on the phone, the both of them were completely dumbfounded and they couldn\u2019t react at all.</p><br/><p>From Shanghai to Beijing, it was a two-hour journey. Even if they took into account the time taken to travel from the airport, it would take three hours at most. That meant that, in three hours, Master Lin would be standing at the entrance of the Beijing association.</p><br/><p><em>This\u2026</em></p><br/><p>*Note: Shrimp soldiers and crab generals is the direct translation of a Chinese phrase, used to refer to useless troops.</p></div>\n</div>"}

Since everyone was there, he wanted people to stay there for a longer time.</p><br/><p>Although Lin Fan drank alcohol, he did not reek of any alcohol at all. He knew that misunderstandings could happen if he were to be drunk. He did not want anyone to cause any trouble.</p><br/><p>\u201cXue Yao, when will you return to Haojiang?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xue Yao smiled. \u201cI\u2019m not in a rush. I can probably stay here for some time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Initially, she wanted to return home the next day. However, she decided to stay on after what Mama Lin said at the dining table because she felt that something was not right.</p><br/><p>As for the matters in Haojiang, she would make a call during the break to ensure that everything was fine.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cSince everyone\u2019s here, let\u2019s explore the place. I haven\u2019t been in Beijing in a long time.\u201d</p><br/><p>He could not even remember when was the last time he came to Beijing.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright,\u201d the group of people nodded.</p><br/><p>However, Lin Fan felt that it was a little weird to be exploring the place in the afternoon. The atmosphere did not seem very suitable for that.</p><br/><p>However, he could not decipher what was wrong with it.</p><br/><p>At the amusement park.</p><br/><p>It was not the place Lin Fan wanted to go but Wu You Lan and the other girls wanted to be there and he had to follow them along.</p><br/><p>At the haunted house, he finally felt the pain of having so many of them around.</p><br/><p>Whenever Lin Fan exited the haunted houses, Wu You Lan and the other ladies would be all over him.</p><br/><p>He could not understand what they were doing. Were they trying to seduce him?</p><br/><p>It seemed a little dark.</p><br/><p>If not for his strong will, perhaps something might have gone wrong.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan wanted to send them back to their hotels at night but they did not seem like they wanted to leave him.</p><br/><p>Elder Zheng\u2019s regular chauffeur was already there to fetch him. However, he did not want to go there alone and he decided to bring them along.</p><br/><p>At Elder Zheng\u2019s home.</p><br/><p>His wife was busy preparing food while Elder Zheng and the others were chatting and drinking tea.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have to help me today. I asked Elder Lin here today for a reason,\u201d Elder Zheng said.</p><br/><p>Yue Qiu Ju Shi nodded. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, we know what to do. We won\u2019t make him completely drunk. If not, there wouldn\u2019t be any artworks.\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Zheng nodded. \u201cThat makes sense. We will see how it goes later.\u201d</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, the others started to voice out their opinions.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Zheng, what if we become drunk before Elder Lin does?\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Zheng squinted his eyes. \u201cIn that case, we will say that he should drink more since he is the only youngster here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat makes sense.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, it\u2019s set. We have to give our all for these artworks.\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Zheng added, \u201cIf we\u2019re successful, you can choose an artwork from my room\u2019s collection. Of course, you can\u2019t take any of Elder Lin\u2019s works.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe can take any one of them?\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Zheng replied, \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about those drawn by famous artists?\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Zheng replied, \u201cWhat\u2019s with the questions? I said it earlier. You can take any of them besides Elder Lin\u2019s works.\u201d</p><br/><p>The bunch of them smiled upon hearing that. They knew that Elder Zheng secretly collected quite a number of fantastic artworks. These could not be valued in monetary terms. Furthermore, they were meaningful pieces.</p><br/><p>In the past, they knew that Elder Zheng treated these artworks like treasures. They did not expect him to give up on other artworks because of Lin Fan\u2019s artworks.</p><br/><p>Tao Shi Gang smiled. \u201cI\u2019m the main lead today. I can drink at least 1 litre.\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Zheng replied, \u201cNo, Elder Tao, you can\u2019t drink so much. We\u2019re all so old already.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yue Qiu Ju Shi added, \u201cYeah, you shouldn\u2019t drink so much.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tao Shi Gang replied, \u201d What\u2019s wrong? Elder Lin\u2019s artworks are the best in this world and his medical knowledge is second to none. If he\u2019s here, what else\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ding ding!</p><br/><p>The doorbell rang.</p><br/><p>\u201cComing!\u201d Zheng Zhong Shan stood up and opened the door. After that, he turned around and said, \u201cDon\u2019t let the cat out of the bag.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><br/><p>The door was opened.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, Elder Zheng, I\u2019m here with a few friends,\u201d Lin Fan said before entering the house.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan and the others were stunned. It was not exactly about how big the house was. It was because of how strict the security checks were for visitors like them.</p><br/><p>Elder Zheng was stunned. He looked at the ladies behind Lin Fan and asked, \u201cAre they all your girlfriends?\u201d</p><br/><p>When he asked that, Wu You Lan and the others\u2019 faces turned red.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said firmly, \u201cThey\u2019re just friends\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Shi smiled as she was preparing food in the kitchen. \u201cYou\u2019re here already?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cYeah, I\u2019m here. What is Sister Zheng cooking? I can smell the goodness of it from here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen did you become so sweet?\u201d Zhao Shi smiled. \u201cI heard your culinary skills are fantastic too. Care to share?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cSure, I can do that. I\u2019ll let all of you try the most delicious cuisine in the world that nobody besides me can cook.\u201d</p><br/><p>The house suddenly became lively.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan and the others were looking around the house. Elder Zheng took a glance at all of them and felt that it was strange to see Elder Lin bring so many people there.</p><br/><p>At the same time, was it right to bring these ladies here? Were they there to help?</p><br/><p>However, Xue Yao understood what was happening, especially after seeing the kind of things that were hung on the walls. They were impressive.</p><br/><p>There were many photos and awards which seemed a little ancient even though they were remarkable awards.</p><br/><p>After some time, a fragrant aroma started to fill the house.</p><br/><p>All of them were stunned after smelling that.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan washed his hands and wiped them dry. \u201cI just made two dishes for you to try.\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Zheng asked, \u201cThese were made by you? The smell is amazing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yue Qiu Ju Shi added, \u201cJust like how impressive your artworks are.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tao Shi Gang sighed, \u201cI can\u2019t wait to try this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. \u201cI\u2019m kidding, You should have known who made these other dishes. Alright, please have a seat. I know you want to make me drunk tonight but please before. I will not be intoxicated; it\u2019s not possible.\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Zheng smiled awkwardly. \u201cWhat are you talking about? How could we do that to you? It\u2019s a normal gathering. We haven\u2019t met up in a long time.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good. Alright, let\u2019s have a good chat among all the Chinese Artists,\u201d Lin Fan said. He smiled as he thought about how Elder Zheng and the others helped him so much.</p><br/><p>Elder Zheng even supported some of the things that he did.</p><br/><p>Although Elder Zheng did not explicitly say it, he knew everything.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

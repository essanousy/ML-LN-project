She would likely be recognised by people outside.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. \u201cThat\u2019s true. Huan Yue is a superstar now. How could you not be conscious about looks?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Lin, don\u2019t tease me. I\u2019m not a superstar,\u201d Wu Huan Yue said.</p><br/><p>She had not expected that there would be a day like this. She had not expected to become a superstar at all.</p><br/><p>However, she had managed to do it with Brother Lin\u2019s help.</p><br/><p>\u201cGo and play your hearts out. Don\u2019t come back too early,\u201d Wang Ming Yang said and waved.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlay, your f*cking head,\u201d Lin Fan said as he glared at him.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang was just a joker.</p><br/><p>After leaving the building.</p><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue asked, \u201cBrother Lin, where are we heading to?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan thought about it for a moment and realised that there was nowhere nice to go. \u201cHmm, let\u2019s just drive around for a while.\u201d</p><br/><p>He did not think of a place to go since his trip here was an impromptu thing. He would usually just go to Cloud Street or Nanshan Children\u2019s Welfare Institute. He did not really know anything much about nice scenic places to go.</p><br/><p>It was inappropriate to go to theme parks since they were really crowded. It would be difficult to leave if Wu Huan Yue was recognised.</p><br/><p>After all, he was also a public figure.</p><br/><p>If people were to see him together with a girl, they would be curious about it. People would definitely recognise her.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go. I thought of a place to go,\u201d Lin Fan said and smiled.</p><br/><p>After some time.</p><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue sat in the car and realised that it was heading to a secluded place with fewer and fewer people in sight. She began to be a little nervous.</p><br/><p>She started to overthink about the destination.</p><br/><p>Then, she wondered if he was going to bring her somewhere quiet to do something intimate.</p><br/><p>When she thought of that, her face turned red. Then, she realised that Brother Lin was smiling as if he was anticipating it.</p><br/><p>The more she thought about it, the more nervous she became.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, we\u2019re here. Follow me.\u201d Lin Fan brought Wu Huan Yue to the peak of a mountain.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a nice place. When I felt down in the past, I always came here to relax.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was just lush greenery in front of them since they were on a cliff.</p><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue looked at the view and took a deep breath. She instantly felt better. She was standing next to Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>\u201cActually, this is a really nice place. I love coming here, but I haven\u2019t been here in a long time due to work.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s beautiful and calming,\u201d Wu Huan Yue said.</p><br/><p>They remained silent for some time.</p><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue wanted to say something, but she hadn\u2019t managed to say it on the previous few tries.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Lin, I will do my best.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. \u201cDon\u2019t give yourself too much pressure. The rankings do not matter. Just be happy. Don\u2019t bother about what is going on online.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know, but I have to give my best since I joined this competition,\u201d Wu Huan Yue replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great, but don\u2019t overwork yourself.\u201d</p><br/><p>He brought Wu Huan Yue here to relax, and he actually needed a break too. He felt like his life was in good shape.</p><br/><p>He was not worried about completing the tasks of the Encyclopedia. He just wanted things to take place naturally.</p><br/><p>After some time.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan wanted to send Wu Huan Yue back. If not for the songs, she would not have wanted to go back so quickly.</p><br/><p>Although she did not need to work so hard, she had to put in some effort too. She wanted to do her best.</p><br/><p>At Cloud Street, Lin Fan received a call from Wang Ming Yang.</p><br/><p>On the phone, Wang Ming Yang was really curious as to how his friend had managed to do it. Wu Huan Yue did not practise so hard anymore.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan just told him what had happened earlier.</p><br/><p>However, Wang Ming Yang did not believe it. He even asked if anything else had happened.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan did not want to speak to a nosy fella like Wang Ming Yang about these things.</p><br/><p>When he reached the shop, Wu You Lan went towards him.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Lin, please help to repost this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan handed her phone to him. \u201cBrother Lin, look at this. This farmer couldn\u2019t sell his oranges for a long time, and they\u2019re going to spoil. Nowadays, many people don\u2019t buy a lot of fruits. With your help, they will definitely be sold!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at it and realised that it was a post by a farmer who planted oranges. They had harvested the oranges from their own farm. If the oranges were not sold, the farmers would not get any money at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cSure, I\u2019ll repost it then.\u201d Lin Fan nodded. He also wrote an extra comment. \u201cEveryone, please have a look. If you\u2019d like to buy some, please do.\u201d</p><br/><p>When that was posted, the netizens started to discuss about it.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, since when did Master Lin become a spokesperson for fruits?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust shut up. Since Master Lin posted it, we have to buy some.\u201d</p><br/><p>At the farm, everyone was depressed.</p><br/><p>They were wondering how they were supposed to clear their oranges.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, a group of farmers were outside trying to separate the good oranges from the bad ones. They were prepared to bring them home for consumption.</p><br/><p>There were no irrigation channels, and there were too few people buying oranges. If they remained unsold, the oranges would definitely spoil.</p><br/><p>A youngster said, \u201cDad, this can\u2019t go on. We have to think of something.\u201d He had started to plant oranges with his family after graduating from college.</p><br/><p>He had wanted to use his knowledge to help the villagers.</p><br/><p>However, the oranges could not be sold, and they were getting flustered.</p><br/><p>Chen Shan sat there and did not know what to do. \u201cI know, but what are we going to do?\u201d</p><br/><p><em>ring, ring</em></p><br/><p>Then, Chen Shan\u2019s son, Chen Xiao Dong, picked up the phone. \u201cHi, you are?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you selling oranges? Give me $100 worth of oranges. Is it possible?\u201d The person asked over the phone.</p><br/><p>Chen Xiao Dong was stunned. He did not know what was going on, but he nodded. \u201cSure, no problem. We will deliver it today.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, I will add you on WeChat and wire the funds to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>After that, he hung up the phone.</p><br/><p>Chen Xiao Dong was stunned after seeing the money being transferred. \u201cDad, someone bought oranges!\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Shan sighed, \u201cJust one? That\u2019s not sufficient.\u201d</p><br/><p>He was still feeling down.</p><br/><p>Then, Chen Xiao Dong\u2019s phone rang again.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

At that moment, he couldn't help but become suspicious. He felt that this man was not simple.</p><br/><p>\"How do you know my name?\" He had no impression of the man in front of him. He didn't think that that was his friend. Moreover, he seldom came to Shanghai so he didn't have many friends here. He didn't even have a single friend who ran a shop. How did this man know his name?</p><br/><p>At that moment, he realized that Lin Fan was pointing above his head. He was curious. \"What's the meaning of this?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \"Go and see what's written on the entrance outside.\"</p><br/><p>Young Master Zou immediately went to the entrance and looked up. He then asked in a surprised tone, \"Master Lin? And what does that mean?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed, \"You already know that I'm Master Lin. Then, how could you not know that with just a rub of my fingers I can read what color of underwear you're wearing today?\"</p><br/><p>Young Master Zou was startled. \"You're a fortune-teller? Alright, stop fooling around. What do you think about my proposition from before? I advise you not to let go of this opportunity. Even if you regret it next time, it won't come again.\"</p><br/><p>\"Red colored,\" said Lin Fan calmly.</p><br/><p>Young Master Zou's expression changed slightly. There was a little disbelief in his eyes. He had never thought that this guy would actually get it right.</p><br/><p>This year was the year of his Chinese Zodiac sign. For good luck, he wore red underwear but he had never thought that this guy would actually know.</p><br/><p>\"Who on Earth are you?\" Young Master Zou asked once more. This guy was really not simple, especially that calm and steady expression of his. It made him seem unusual.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled, then leaned back on his chair. \"Looks like you're not from around here. Then it's normal not to know me.\" He then pointed his finger. \"You're in luck today to have met me. I'll give you some advice and it'll also be my proposition for you.\"</p><br/><p>\"Your marriage fate is not too good. It's best if you hurry back to Beijing and do what you can. There's still some hope,\" said Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Young Master Zou laughed, \"What do you mean by that? My marriage fate? I don't even have a girlfriend and yet, you're telling me this.\"</p><br/><p>\"Hehe, I didn't say that you have a girlfriend. But the person that forced you out to Shanghai has a pretty good relationship with you. Your marriage fate has been rather close to hers as of late. But it isn't very stable,\" said Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>\"The person who forced me to Shanghai?\" Young Master Zou was curious. He then thought about it and was stunned. The person who forced me out to Shanghai...isn't that her? His expression changed as he said, \"Who exactly are you? How do you know all this?\"</p><br/><p>At that moment, he had no choice but to be alarmed. This man seemed to know a lot about him but he didn't know anything about this man.</p><br/><p>\"Young Master.\" Then, Li Yang Jun came. He had waited for a long time in the car but Young Master still hadn't returned so he was worried. When he reached the shop and saw Young Master chatting with this man, he was curious.</p><br/><p>He didn't know why Young Master was chatting with this man and from the looks of things, it didn't seem right.</p><br/><p>Young Master Zou didn't say anything to Li Yang Jun. Instead, he pressed his palm on the table and said in a deep and stern tone, \"Who are you? How do you know all this?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. \"Young Master, keep calm. Didn't I already tell you? Besides selling scallion pancakes, I'm also a fortune-teller. And reading your fortune isn't hard at all.</p><br/><p>Li Yang Jun said, \"Young Master. He really is a fortune-teller. I heard he's very accurate.\"</p><br/><p>Young Master Zou nodded but he still didn't get it. What was all of this? In his eyes, all this was impractical. But Lin Fan had such a calm and serious expression as if to tell him that he knew even more.</p><br/><p>As someone involved, he wondered what would happen and he became endlessly curious.</p><br/><p>\"What do you mean by what you just said?\" Young Master Zou asked pressingly.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan sipped his tea again and said, \"Come, sit. We'll talk slowly. You Lan, bring him some tea.\"</p><br/><p>Young Master Zou was a little suspicious but he still obediently went and sat down. Wu You Lan poured a cup of tea and brought it over. Young Master Zou nodded to express his thanks. Although Wu You Lan was beautiful, he only took one glance at her. At that moment, all his curiosity and attention had been captured by Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Li Yang Jun stood at the side and didn't interrupt. He was Shanghainese, so he naturally knew about this scallion pancake seller, Master Lin. He had heard that his fortune-telling was very accurate. But in today's society, people weren't too superstitious, hence it wasn't very far spread. And this Master Lin also intentionally kept it low-profile.</p><br/><p>Although people heard about his fortune-telling, not many bothered about it.</p><br/><p>After all, many things were exaggerated on the Internet, so many netizens only saw his fortune-telling as a hype. People who weren't directly involved didn't believe in it.</p><br/><p>\"What did you mean by what you said?\" Young Master Zou asked once more.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled thinly. \"Please call me Master Lin.\"</p><br/><p>Young Master Zou was stunned. The situation seemed to have taken a turn. Right now, he seemed to be the one being suppressed. But he really wanted to know what was going on.</p><br/><p>He didn't believe in fortune-telling but now, after what Li Yang Jun had said, he was wavering.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian looked at Lin Fan as he laughed in his heart. He knew this kid wouldn't be able to escape. As long as Lin Fan was tricking him, he would definitely fall into the trap. No, it couldn't be called tricking, it was the real deal. It wasn't a fake.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan rested his arms on the table and leaned his body forward. He fixed his gaze on Young Master Zou and said, \"I'll tell you right now but let me ask you this: Do you trust me?\"</p><br/><p>Young Master Zou looked at Lin Fan and replied, \"Tell me first. I'm still considering if I can trust you.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shook his head. \"Then forget it. I only read fortunes for those who trust me. If you don't trust me, then leave.\"</p><br/><p>Li Yang Jun was an experienced and knowledgeable man. He had seen many strange things in his life. He leaned towards Young Master Zou's ear and said, \"Some things can be trusted. This man in front of you at least has some reputation. There have been quite a few of his predictions that really came true.\"</p><br/><p>Li Yang Jun had done his research on this place. He was rather trusting towards this fortune-teller because he had unintentionally come across certain incidents during his research where things that couldn't be fully explained had happened.</p><br/><p>He had also wanted Lin Fan to give himself a reading once, but later on, Lin Fan started to only make scallion pancakes and no longer personally did fortune-telling. This caused Li Yang Jun to lose this desire.</p><br/><p>Young Master Zou nodded, then looked at Lin Fan. He said, \"Master Lin, I trust you.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. \"Alright then. I'll only tell you one thing. If you believe it, then listen to what I say. If not, then don't blame me for what happens. I've already warned you.\"</p><br/><p>\"Don't bother staying in Shanghai for three months. Go back to Beijing today. Otherwise, your marriage fate will be snatched by someone else.\" After Lin Fan said this, he didn't continue. He just looked at Young Master Zou with a smile on his face.</p><br/><p>Young Master Zou was a little doubtful. \"That's all?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded. \"Yes, that's all.\"</p><br/><p>No, wait\u2026</p><br/><p>At that moment, Young Master Zou suddenly came to his senses. How does this guy know that I'm planning to stay in Shanghai for three months to lie low?</p><br/><p>Young Master Zou stood up and looked at Lin Fan. \"Alright, I believe you. I, Zou Tian Fu, is not someone who is ungrateful. If you are correct, I'll owe you a favor.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed, \"You can pay me any amount you like for the fortune reading. As for favors, forget it.\"</p><br/><p>Young Master Zou was stunned. Then, he laughed. This was the first time he had heard this. Somebody didn't want a favor from him.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>After Young Master Zou left, Lin Fan couldn't help but let out a deep sigh. It was as if he had just sent out a devil.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian came over and said, \"Hey kid, why were you so nice to read his fortune?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan glanced at Fraud Tian, then said to Wu Tian He, \"Did you see anything?\"</p><br/><p>Wu Tian He nodded. \"I know his father but this is the first time I've seen him. But I feel like his link to you is quite strong. This reading is a little strange.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan sighed in his heart. When he first saw Young Master Zou, he had already felt that something wasn't right.</p><br/><p>If nothing had been said, this guy would have stayed in Shanghai for three months and within this period, he would have been met with numerous troubles. Moreover, all of these troubles were related to Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Hence, when he realized this, Lin Fan immediately tricked him into leaving.</p><br/><p>If there is loss, there must be gain.</p><br/><p>If this Young Master Zou stayed in Shanghai, they would get to know each other but a problem would arise in his marriage fate back in Beijing.</p><br/><p>By tricking him into leaving, his marriage fate would be maintained and he wouldn't come into contact with Lin Fan as much, saving him lots of trouble. But at the same time, judging from his physiognomy, this man was important to Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>But to Lin Fan, he didn't need any important people in his life.</p><br/><p>He only needed to be important to other people, not the other way around.</p><br/><p>What is this called?</p><br/><p>This is called defying nature and changing fates!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Why did he drag Master Lin into this? This isn\u2019t a joke! If Master Lin threw this match, we are all screwed!\u201d</p><br/><p>However, he knew never to look down on Master Lin\u2019s fans.</p><br/><p>Those fans were just too loyal to him, and now with the host inviting Master Lin on stage, this was just too brutal.</p><br/><p>When it reached that stage, President Liu was afraid it would have been too late. When the fans got angry, it was something that was very serious.</p><br/><p>Zhenping Yiming looked at the host, \u201cWhat scoring system are we playing?\u201d</p><br/><p>The host was at a loss for words. He didn\u2019t know how to answer him. What scoring system was he going to implement?</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled, \u201cLet us have a regular match, best of seven sets, and first to six sets wins.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhenping Yiming looked at him, \u201cBest of seven, first to six wins? Is there even such a scoring system?\u201d</p><br/><p>The host translated what Zhenping Yiming said for Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>\u201cI just want to play with the champion a little longer, to learn from him while playing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>In the broadcast room.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo! This isn\u2019t the Master Lin that I know.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow could Master Lin do this? He shouldn\u2019t take up the paddle at all.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt looks like Master Lin is taking this seriously though.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBulls*it, taking it seriously. He\u2019s even playing best of seven sets. It\u2019s better if he just played two balls and left. Maybe it\u2019ll be less embarrassing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSigh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Not a single person supported Lin Fan. From their perspective, this was going to be a huge disgrace.</p><br/><p>Zhenping Yiming smiled, \u201cAlright, I shall educate you properly on how to play. We Japanese people are very generous.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLess talk more play, come let us begin,\u201d Lin Fan said, passing the ball over to Zhenping Yiming.</p><br/><p>Zhenping Yiming smiled, \u201cOnce I serve, I\u2019m afraid that you won\u2019t be able to receive any of my balls.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan didn\u2019t understand a single word of Japanese, and so he just stared at him blankly, waiting for him to serve.</p><br/><p>However, the host translated what Zhenping Yiming said for Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled after hearing what he said.</p><br/><p>In the broadcast room.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re doomed. This match is an amateur against a professional player.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin is about to get screwed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe match has begun.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, Zhenping Yiming casually served the ball. However, his serve caused the ball to spin greatly.</p><br/><p>He wanted to make sure his opponent didn\u2019t even have a chance to return the ball.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan casually swung his paddle. From his perspective, the ball was traveling really slowly.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan swung violently, his shoulders and hands rotating as he returned the ball with maximum force.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>The ball bounced on the table and whizzed past Zhenping Yiming.</p><br/><p>Zhenping Yiming\u2019s relaxed posture suddenly changed into something serious. His body couldn\u2019t react fast enough for the ball- when he lifted his hands, the ball had already hit the floor.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck!\u201d</p><br/><p>The people in the crowd all stood up, looking on in shock.</p><br/><p>They couldn\u2019t believe it- Master Lin had just won a point.</p><br/><p>The broadcasting room exploded with shock and joy at that moment. Some of the people didn\u2019t even see where the ball went. From their perspective, the ball traveled too fast.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan swung his hands, \u201cI never thought that my skills are still with me. You better play your best with me! If you don\u2019t return my balls, there isn\u2019t any point in playing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhenping Yiming never thought that his opponent would be that powerful. He looked at Lin Fan with a serious face, \u201cYou have power, but I will not let my guard down this time. Continue.\u201d</p><br/><p>Just as the other party was about to pass the ball to Lin Fan, Lin Fan immediately stopped him, \u201cDon\u2019t pass me the ball. I\u2019m afraid that if you don\u2019t serve, you\u2019ll never have the opportunity to serve the ball at all.\u201d</p><br/><p>In the broadcast room.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn, I just realized that Master Lin is the arrogant one here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, I like his arrogance.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck! If Master Lin isn\u2019t arrogant, he isn\u2019t the Master Lin that I know.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Zhenping Yiming was getting a little angry, while the host who was acting as the translator was on cloud nine.</p><br/><p><em>Beat this b*stard!</em></p><br/><p>At this moment, Zhenping Yiming used all his might to serve. He felt that his opponent was mocking him and so he had to use everything he had to teach him a lesson. His serve required a certain skill level to receive, otherwise, the ball would just fly elsewhere.</p><br/><p>The national team.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a difficult ball. I never thought that Zhenping Yiming was that skilled. Not anybody can receive that ball.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe is indeed Su Jing\u2019s disciple. His skills are\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Before he could finish talking, the television screen showed a very different scene.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan used the same method, sending the ball back in a violent and aggressive, yet skillful manner.</p><br/><p>The ball flew past Zhenping Yiming even before he could react to it.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at him helplessly, \u201cChampion, are you alright? If you can\u2019t receive my shots, I might have to slow down for you. Please return my shots, otherwise, I\u2019ll feel quite awkward here, as if I\u2019m just practicing how to return shots.\u201d</p><br/><p>What Lin Fan said was streamed on the television broadcast as well as the internet broadcast and many people got to hear it.</p><br/><p>The members of the national team were all stunned as they looked at each other in disbelief. It wasn\u2019t just Zhenping Yiming that couldn\u2019t take those two shots- if they were in his shoes, they wouldn\u2019t have been able to take it either.</p><br/><p>For the spectators, this sight was just too awesome to behold.</p><br/><p>\u201cCool! This is so cool! Master Lin is soo f*cking awesome!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha! I\u2019m dying of laughter! That Japanese Champion\u2019s face is all black now!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Zhenping Yiming\u2019s heart was racing with rage and anxiety- he felt that he had been humiliated in front of everyone.</p><br/><p>Thereafter, he tossed the ball over to Lin Fan, \u201cYou serve.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at him helplessly, \u201cWell fine, but rest assured, I\u2019ll hit slower this time.\u201d</p><br/><p>After he had said that, Lin Fan took up his paddle and served a rookie service to Zhenping Yiming.</p><br/><p>Zhenping Yiming laughed mockingly after seeing the way Lin Fan served, and he definitely had to return a shot that would wreck him.</p><br/><p>Thump!</p><br/><p>The small, yellow ball hit the table top and Zhenping Yiming got himself ready as the ball was about to rebound to him. However, he realized that the ball suddenly changed its direction and increased in speed, causing him to be unable to react to it.</p><br/><p>The ball landed on the floor.</p><br/><p>\u201cJapanese champion, why didn\u2019t you receive my ball? It is actually quite easy to return it. You just have to stretch out your hands a little more. How did you even get your championship title? I have a deep suspicion that Xu Song had left quite a huge scar on you,\u201d Lin Fan said, looking like he was talking to himself. He was completely oblivious to Zhenping Yiming, who was looking at him with a death stare.</p><br/><p>The members of the national team were completely stunned. They realized that Master Lin\u2019s service was just too strange.</p><br/><p>How could the ball suddenly change direction and increase in speed after bouncing off? What was the explanation for it?</p><br/><p>Lin Fan himself was feeling helpless. He didn\u2019t know the principle behind his service either, and all he could do was attribute his skills to the encyclopedia.</p><br/><p>The time passed second by second.</p><br/><p>The audience members who were initially on cloud nine slowly turned serious.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin is a little too fierce. His opponent couldn\u2019t even touch the ball!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSportsmanship first, the competition second. I can\u2019t bear to watch this match anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLook at Zhenping Yiming. He looks like he\u2019s about to cry.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not \u2018about\u2019 to cry. He\u2019s already crying.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, please let him be able to return a shot! Don\u2019t completely humiliate him like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cJapanese champion, are you able to play?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJapanese champion, I\u2019ve already slowed down my movements for you. If you still can\u2019t return my shots, I really can\u2019t help you much. How about you serve the ball? At least you get to hit the ball at least once.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJapanese champion, that ball traveled in a straight path. Where were you going to hit?\u201d</p><br/><p>The crowd went silent. Lin Fan was the only person there who was talking to himself.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh!\u201d</p><br/><p>Just at this moment, Zhenping Yiming threw his racquet onto the table. He was losing it, especially after Lin Fan kept on mocking it with the words \u2018Japanese champion\u2019.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not playing anymore,\u201d Zhenping Yiming had never been humiliated this badly before. Tears were welling up in the corner of his eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did he say?\u201d Lin Fan looked at the host, asking.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe said that he didn\u2019t want to play anymore,\u201d the host replied.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at his opponent, despising him, \u201cWhat is the meaning of this? We agreed to play best of seven sets. Don\u2019t tell me that you Japanese people will just give up like this? This is completely disrespecting the game, and it isn\u2019t respecting the effort that I have put in training as an amateur outside of this game. Could it be that you\u2019re looking down on your amateur opponent?\u201d</p><br/><p>The host couldn\u2019t bear to see the match any longer, but he still translated what Lin Fan said for Zhenping Yiming.</p><br/><p><em>Amateur opponent?</em></p><br/><p><em>Amateur my a*s.</em></p><br/><p><em>Do amateurs play like this?</em></p><br/><p>Zhenping Yiming\u2019s spirit was completely crushed. He started tearing as he picked up the ball to serve again.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a good player.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan casually returned the ball, but his opponent couldn\u2019t even retaliate his shots.</p><br/><p>Zhenping Yiming couldn\u2019t take it anymore. Tears were streaming down his face as he continued to play</p><br/><p>He picked up the ball and served again.</p><br/><p>And again.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan stood over there, his legs unmoved as he returned another shot.</p><br/><p>Zhenping Yiming was already in a daze. He didn\u2019t know where the ball had flown to. He looked left and right, but the ball was nowhere to be seen.</p><br/><p>Where did the ball fly too?!</p><br/><p>\u201cChampion, the ball is in your collar. You didn\u2019t notice just now, but it flew inside,\u201d Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>Zhenping Yiming\u2019s eyes were red from crying as tears continued to roll down his cheeks. He picked up the ball from his collar and continued to serve.</p><br/><p>Backstage.</p><br/><p>\u201cPresident, do you want us to talk to Master Lin? I think we better ask him to let his opponent return his shots. After all, the Japanese are our international friends and this won\u2019t really be good for our international relations. Furthermore, Zhenping Yiming is the top champion of the Asia Pacific region, and to be unable to return a shot isn\u2019t good for his reputation\u2026\u201d one of the workers said.</p><br/><p>President Liu was completely stunned, but he managed to react, \u201cYes, yes. Please tell the host to tell Master Lin to purposely lose a point.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p></div>\n</div>"}

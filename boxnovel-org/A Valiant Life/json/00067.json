That feels good!\" Lin Fan\u2019s legs were getting a little numb. He had been squatting for at least twenty minutes. His thighs felt like they were on fire. He had to get up soon.</p><br/><p>This shopping centre was a good location. Lin Fan had thought of opening his fortune telling shop here once, but he didn\u2019t have the finances to do so.</p><br/><p>At that moment, someone called out Lin Fan\u2019s name.</p><br/><p>\"Young Fan!\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was startled. Who was it?</p><br/><p>The nickname \u2018Young Fan\u2019 was his nickname in high school.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was pleasantly surprised as he turned around. \"Big Tree\u2026\"</p><br/><p>The man in front of him was tall, dark and handsome.</p><br/><p>He never thought that he would meet one of his better friends from high school in the shopping mall.</p><br/><p>\"Ah, Young Fan! It really is you! I didn\u2019t recognize you at first.\" Yan Shu Ren excitedly said. He couldn\u2019t believe that it was his good friend from high school.</p><br/><p>Both of them were good friends in high school. But after they went on to university, they weren\u2019t as close as they used to be.</p><br/><p>Although they didn\u2019t contact each other often, they would still meet up every school holiday at Lin Fan\u2019s house.</p><br/><p>\"Big Tree, you should have told me that you were coming over to Shanghai! I would have brought you around!\" Lin Fan laughed as he said, turning to look at the two girls and one guy behind him.</p><br/><p>\"And who are these three?\" Lin Fan asked.</p><br/><p>\"Young Fan, this is my girlfriend Chen Mei Tong. The other girl is her best friend and this dude is her boyfriend.\"</p><br/><p>\"All looking good!\" Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>\"Hey fill me up! What are you doing in Shanghai?\" Yan Shu Ren laughed as he asked.</p><br/><p>\"Nothing much, just opened a shop over at Cloud Street passing my days. You\u2019re here on vacation?\" Lin Fan asked cheerily.</p><br/><p>\"You can say that.\" Yan Shu Ren congratulated Lin Fan. \"I didn\u2019t do very well in my exams, so I\u2019m here to look for a job. Just so happens that my girlfriend\u2019s best friend\u2019s boyfriend is quite familiar with the city.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan found the situation rather interesting.</p><br/><p>\"Xiao Yan, we should get going.\" Zhang Guo Yang said annoyed, as he stood there. He sized up Lin Fan and gave him a death stare. Lin Fan didn\u2019t want anything to do with that guy.</p><br/><p>Wang Xiao Yan and Chen Mei Tong were best friends, she managed to find a boyfriend with a car and an apartment. She followed him everywhere he went. Not wanting to anger him, she pulled on Chen Mei Tong\u2019s sleeve, motioning her to leave.</p><br/><p>\"Big tree, if you have anything to attend to, please go and do so. I\u2019ll leave you my number and if anything hit me up.\" Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>\"Alright, we should meet up once I\u2019ve settled down here.\" Yan Shu Ren was annoyed that he had to leave after such a short time of meeting his old friend. What was the hurry? Yan Shu Ren passed his phone number to Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>\"Young Fan, I\u2019ll take my leave.\" Yan Shu Ren said as he waved back.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan grinned at him.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan walked back to his shop after Big tree left.</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>\"Big Tree, who\u2019s your friend?\" Chen Mei Tong asked him softly. She met him at university. She didn\u2019t have any self-interest in Lin Fan. She just wanted to know her boyfriend\u2019s friends a little better.</p><br/><p>She looked for her best friend to help Yan Shu Ren. Chen Mei Tong didn\u2019t think much of it at first, but then she started to feel a little uncomfortable.</p><br/><p>Wang Xiao Yan\u2019s boyfriend kept on pressuring Chen Mei Tong\u2019s boyfriend. He seemed to look down on him.</p><br/><p>Although she was her best friend, Chen Mei Tong started feeling like Wang Xiao Yan forcefully dragged her along. It made her feel uncomfortable,</p><br/><p>\"Didn\u2019t he say just now? He opened a shop at Cloud Street.\" Yan Shu Ren replied.</p><br/><p>Chen Mei Tong didn\u2019t ask anymore.</p><br/><p>\"Big Tree, although you\u2019re a university grad, Shanghai is a whole new ball game. I\u2019ll bring you around. Soak it all in.\" Zhang Guo Yang said proudly.</p><br/><p>Yan Shu Ren laughed awkwardly.</p><br/><p>Chen Mei Tong wasn\u2019t looking too good.</p><br/><p>Wang Xiao Yan beamed at her boyfriend with an air of pride.</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>The city folk were anxiously waiting for Lin Fan. If he hadn\u2019t come back soon enough, they would probably have gone to the shopping mall to haul him back.</p><br/><p>After tending to all of them, the city folk made their way. Lin Fan stood in front of the counter, tidying things up a little as he prepared to rest.</p><br/><p>A black Cadillac rolled down Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>Wang Xiao Yan pointed at the shop front. \"Hey Big Tree, take a look. Isn\u2019t that your classmate? He\u2019s selling scallion pancakes.\"</p><br/><p>\"Ha, this guy really knows how to blow his trumpet. Just a pancake seller and he claims to have opened his own shop?\" Zhang Guo Yang said arrogantly as he drove his car down the street.</p><br/><p>The atmosphere in the car was a little oppressive. After Wang Xiao Yan\u2019s vanity complex was satisfied, things eased up a little.</p><br/><p>\"Mei Dan, you and your boyfriend should treat Guo Yang and me to a nice meal. That UV shop looks pretty good.\"</p><br/><p>\"Alright, alright...\" Chen Mei Tong\u2019s mood wasn\u2019t right. She blindly agreed without knowing what a UV shop was.</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>Night time!</p><br/><p>It was another uneventful day at work. Lin Fan didn\u2019t know what to do about the city folk who just wanted to eat his scallion pancakes.</p><br/><p>\u2018My fortune telling abilities are the best, yet you guys only know how to eat. What a heartbreaker.\u2019 Lin Fan thought.</p><br/><p>At that moment, his phone rang. It was Yan Shu Ren.</p><br/><p>\"What\u2019s up Big Tree?\" Lin Fan said cheerily.</p><br/><p>\"Young Fan, let me treat you to a meal.\" Yan Shu Ren said.</p><br/><p>\"Oh you don\u2019t have to. Let me treat you instead!\" Lin Fan replied.</p><br/><p>\"You can do that next time. Meet me at a diner called UV. It\u2019s located at Middle Mountain Road. I\u2019m on my way now, although I don\u2019t exactly know where it is. Just come here first, I\u2019ll call you later.\"</p><br/><p>\"Oh? UV diner? I know where it is. I\u2019ll be there.\" Lin Fan faintly remembered that restaurant. \"You don\u2019t have to worry about me. I just closed shop, will be there soon.\"</p><br/><p>Click.</p><br/><p>\"Fraud Tian, I\u2019ll be off first. Can you help me to lock up?\" Lin Fan asked.</p><br/><p>\"Ah. Have fun with your friend. I\u2019ll just go home, alone, and eat my porridge while you dine like a king\" Fraud Tian eavesdropped on his phone conversation with Shu Ren. He wished Lin Fan would bring him along as well.</p><br/><p>\"At least you understand that this is a special occasion. At least you aren\u2019t stupid. I\u2019m gonna go off first, please remember to lock the door.\" Lin Fan took his car keys and walked over to his car before driving off.</p><br/><p>The red wine and sprite cocktail there was not too bad.</p><br/><p>But he didn\u2019t think it was anything special the last time he drank it.</p><br/><p>This time his friend was treating him, so he\u2019d better moderate his spending a little.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

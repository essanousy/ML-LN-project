What\u2019s going on? Why did they give the opposition the chance to shoot again?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck. Golden Flowers is not on form today.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, the opposition\u2019s offense is just too strong.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if they will be able to defend this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho knows? But why is that Tanaka Hiroshi still there? Could it be that he didn\u2019t run back after the last shot?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Yokohama F. Marinos player who had seized the ball shouted out as he passed the ball to Tanaka Hiroshi.</p><br/><p>Tanaka Hiroshi responded. When he saw the Golden Flowers players charging towards him, he yelled out a battle cry. He wanted to wash away the shame of his failed shot. He ferociously dribbled the ball towards the opposition\u2019s goal post.</p><br/><p>Wu Ze, who was in the coaching stands, clenched his fists tightly. \u201cCome on, Master Lin. You have to catch this ball.\u201d</p><br/><p>The audience all held their breaths. They were incomparably anxious. Although the previous save had been beautiful, it might have just been a one-time miracle.</p><br/><p>*Bam!*</p><br/><p>Tanaka Hiroshi kicked the ball aggressively. This ball encompassed all his power as it flew towards the goal post.</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan saw it, his feet shifted slightly before he reached out with his hand once again.</p><br/><p>*Thud!*</p><br/><p>That lightning fast ball was caught with his hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*cking awesome!\u201d</p><br/><p>The whole stadium erupted in cheers once again. This time, everyone had seen it clearly. The previous time, some people hadn\u2019t seen a clear view of the shot but this time, it was crystal clear.</p><br/><p>\u201cBeautiful.\u201d Wu Ze was exhilarated. He felt as if he had picked up a gem. He felt incomparably lucky.</p><br/><p>He hadn\u2019t had much hope in Master Lin but Master Lin had now given him plenty of hope.</p><br/><p>Tanaka Hiroshi was already dumbfounded. This was already his second shot but this guy made him feel completely powerless.</p><br/><p><em>It\u2019s not possible. It\u2019s definitely not possible. He must have been lucky.</em></p><br/><p>When Wang Fei saw what had happened, he was exhilarated as well. He felt that Master Lin was really too awesome.</p><br/><p>But suddenly, he was stunned.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is Master Lin trying to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>At this point, he wasn\u2019t the only one stunned. Even the people in the audience were in the same.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn. What is this goalkeeper doing? Can\u2019t he even hold the ball steady?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck. Why do I feel like he spontaneously gave the ball to the opposition?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt can\u2019t be. Could this be God\u2019s will for Golden Flowers to lose this match?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan wanted to test it out again to see how it felt to catch the ball. Then, he directly threw the ball gently to Tanaka Hiroshi\u2019s feet.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome. Give it another kick.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tanaka Hiroshi didn\u2019t know why the opposition had thrown the ball to him but of course, he had to seize this opportunity. Without hesitation, he shot the ball towards the goal once more.</p><br/><p>*Bam!*</p><br/><p>Lin Fan very simply caught the ball. But he didn\u2019t feel quite satisfied yet.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome. One more time.\u201d</p><br/><p>The ball was tossed to the opposition once again.</p><br/><p>Tanaka Hiroshi was stunned. He realized that it wasn\u2019t a mistake by the opposition. It seemed that this goalkeeper was doing it on purpose. He looked at the ball at his feet, then at the goalkeeper.</p><br/><p>With a battle cry, he struck the ball with his foot once more.</p><br/><p>*Bam!*</p><br/><p>The ball was caught yet again. Moreover, it was just as easily caught as the last time.</p><br/><p>Tanaka Hiroshi was completely stunned. <em>How can this be? Why can\u2019t I score a single goal? What </em>the heck is <em>up with this goalkeeper? How can he catch every ball I shoot? It\u2019s not possible. This is definitely not possible.</em></p><br/><p>*Thud!*</p><br/><p>The ball rolled over and gently came to rest at his feet.</p><br/><p>The spectators\u2019 jaws had all dropped as they exchanged glances at each other.</p><br/><p>\u201cSomebody pinch me. Am I dreaming? Who on Earth is this goalkeeper? He\u2019s way too arrogant, isn\u2019t he? He\u2019s just passing the ball repeatedly to the opposition for the opposition to shoot. How brave and how confident must he be?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t a dream. This definitely isn\u2019t a dream. This is the f*cking reality.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow many shots has it been? Was that the fourth or fifth shot? I\u2019ve lost count already. All I know is that this goalkeeper just caught all those balls just by extending his arm and without any hesitation at all.</p><br/><p>Wang Fei and the rest, who had been running towards Lin Fan\u2019s side initially, were now all standing rooted to the ground. This was the first time they had seen such a thing.</p><br/><p>\u201cCaptain, what is Master Lin doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Fei shook his head slowly. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I really don\u2019t even know.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the opposition and said, \u201cHere, have another kick.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAH!\u201d Tanaka Hiroshi bellowed furiously as he felt a sense of shame. Then, he kicked the ball ferociously once more. The ball seemed to change shape as it flew towards the goal post.</p><br/><p>This shot really contained every ounce of power that he had. Its speed would make one utterly speechless.</p><br/><p>*Clatter!*</p><br/><p>When Tanaka Hiroshi saw this ball get caught by the goalkeeper easily once again, his whole body turned stiff as he knelt to the ground. He grabbed the grass with both hands.</p><br/><p>After taking so many shots, not a single one managed to enter the goal post. He felt a deep sense of shame.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan held the ball in his hand. This time, he wouldn\u2019t kick it. He looked into the distance and realized that his teammates were still on the opposition\u2019s side of the field. Meanwhile, the Yokohama F. Marinos players seemed to all be stunned as they looked at the kneeling Tanaka Hiroshi.</p><br/><p>It was as if they didn\u2019t believe that he hadn\u2019t scored after so many tries.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan pulled his arm back. Aiming at the players in the distance, he flung the ball ferociously.</p><br/><p>This ball was more vicious than a kicked ball as it flew towards the other side of the field.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn! Who on Earth is this goalkeeper? That\u2019s too f*cking far, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMotherf*cker. I\u2019ve watched football for decades but no match has ever made me this shocked. I\u2019m afraid something like this will never happen again.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLook. Where the heck is this ball going to fly to?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn. It actually reached the opposition\u2019s side.\u201d</p><br/><p>Those players who were standing at the opposition\u2019s side hadn\u2019t regained their senses yet when the ball landed at one of their feet.</p><br/><p>Wang Fei looked at Master Lin, then at the other side. This distance was way too scary.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, the Yokohama F. Marino players were shocked as well. It seemed that they weren\u2019t able to respond as they stood there stupidly. They didn\u2019t even show any response at all.</p><br/><p><em>What\u2019s happening?</em></p><br/><p><em>The ball was just here a moment ago. How did it suddenly end up over there?</em></p><br/><p>At that moment, the audience stood up as they cheered maniacally.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeng Chong, you have to f*cking shoot!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTeng Chong, shoot!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTeng Chong, shoot!\u201d</p><br/><p>Teng Chong stood at the same spot. He looked down at the ball at his feet and immediately regained his senses.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck. Is this still the same football that I know?\u201d</p><br/><p>Although his heart was in a mess, the ball was at his feet right now. If he didn\u2019t kick it, it would be a complete waste.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, without thinking more, he dribbled the ball towards the goal. He looked straight at the opposition\u2019s goalkeeper before viciously kicking the ball.</p><br/><p>\u201cGo in!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Yokohama F. Marinos goalkeeper was stunned. But when he regained his senses, he was given a huge shock. He dove towards the incoming ball.</p><br/><p>But unfortunately, all he caught was air.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s in.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that instant, the stadium completely erupted.</p></div>\n</div>"}

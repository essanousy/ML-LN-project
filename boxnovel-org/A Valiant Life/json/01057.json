However, this \u2018Stop\u2019 had no effect.</p><br/><p>After all, those people felt that he was just a normal person meddling with something he wasn\u2019t related to. They completely ignored him.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was getting upset. \u201cStop.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, his voice was raised and it shook the two security guards.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou two big guys treat an old man like that. If your children see this, how ashamed would they feel?\u201d said Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, it\u2019s Master Lin.\u201d Among the spectators, one of them had recognized Lin Fan. After all, there weren\u2019t many people in Shanghai who didn\u2019t know who Master Lin was.</p><br/><p>This \u2018handsome\u2019 face, in particular, refreshed the memories of many of them.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, I always buy scallion pancakes from your place.\u201d</p><br/><p>One of the townsfolk took out his phone. With a \u2018kacha\u2019 sound, he snapped a photo as he spoke excitedly.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded. He hadn\u2019t expected that he would even run into fans of his scallion pancakes here. It felt pretty good.</p><br/><p>When the two security guards had heard Lin Fan\u2019s words, they had been stunned. Afterward, when they heard that this was Master Lin, they immediately let the old man go. They knew who Master Lin was. He was a famous man.</p><br/><p>Now that this famous man had spoken, how could they dare to act unbridled?</p><br/><p>Lin Fan stepped forward and supported the old man. \u201cWhat\u2019s your situation?\u201d</p><br/><p>The old man passed the photocopied sheet to Lin Fan. \u201cYoungster, take a look. This was given to me by them. They said it\u2019s a contract I agreed to, to loan my money to some kind of start-up. But I have never signed such a thing. Moreover, this name on the sheet wasn\u2019t even signed by me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the piece of paper in his hand very closely. The date that the money would be returned was really ridiculous. It was thirty years later.</p><br/><p>Then, he looked over at that woman. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><br/><p>That middle-aged woman was an employee here. When she heard Lin Fan\u2019s words, she knew that this was Master Lin so she didn\u2019t want to make a big deal out of it. After all, Master Lin was not someone to be angered.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis was signed by himself,\u201d replied the woman simply.</p><br/><p>The old man immediately retorted, \u201cHow could it have been signed by me? I didn\u2019t even sign it. Back then, I just deposited my money here. I didn\u2019t do anything else.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGive me back my money.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan appeased the old man, \u201cBe patient. I\u2019ll help you to clarify things.\u201d Then, he looked at the woman. \u201cI hope you can help to check it out. See what exactly is going on.\u201d</p><br/><p>The middle-aged woman shook her head. \u201cWe\u2019ve already checked. The document in his hands is what we found. This has nothing to do with us. We still have things to do. If you have any problems, look for the related personnel.\u201d</p><br/><p>After saying that, she left in a hurry. She didn\u2019t want to stay here any longer.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Lin Fan had just opened his mouth when the middle-aged lady left along with the two security guards without turning back.</p><br/><p>The surrounding townsfolk gathered around.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, this situation is hard to resolve.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. They\u2019re really firm about this. Even if you look for the related person in charge, you wouldn\u2019t be able to find him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI feel that the old man will just have to count himself as unlucky.\u201d</p><br/><p>The townsfolk started a commotion.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan felt that since he had come across this, he had to help the old man resolve it. After all, this money had not been gotten so easily. He couldn\u2019t just let them do whatever they wanted.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go in to take a look,\u201d said Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>The old man followed closely behind as he wanted to have a word as well. He had already been here for a long time. Since a month ago, he had started coming over to question them.</p><br/><p>In the beginning, the people here would still receive him and treat him nicely but later on, they had stopped welcoming him. Even if he spoke to them, they would act as if they didn\u2019t hear it.</p><br/><p>Inside, the middle-aged woman was talking to someone. When she saw that Master Lin had come in with that old man, she purposely avoided them and went to another place.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan brought the old man to the reception counter. Then, he took out the document.</p><br/><p>\u201cMay I ask what\u2019s going on? He clearly didn\u2019t sign all this. Why did something like this happen?\u201d</p><br/><p>That employee seemed to already know the situation. He shook his head. \u201cSorry, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on either. Why don\u2019t you ask at the service booth?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan took a deep breath before taking the old man to the booth. At the booth, that person saw Lin Fan and the old man walking here and immediately left his original seat. At the same time, his \u2018Temporarily Occupied\u2019 sign lighted up.</p><br/><p>Those who were handling their work all waved their hand also as they acted as if they didn\u2019t know anything.</p><br/><p>After walking a whole round, everybody ignored them.</p><br/><p>The old man saw this situation and was anxious. He sat down on the ground furiously. \u201cWhat am I going to do? This is the money I\u2019ve painstakingly saved over decades!\u201d</p><br/><p>Some of the people who were handling their own businesses saw this situation and shook their heads. They had seen many such cases before. However, they had never seen anyone that could do anything to the bank.</p><br/><p>But they would rather put their money with the bank than keep it themselves. After all, they felt that such cases were rare and it definitely wouldn\u2019t happen to them.</p><br/><p>At that moment, a townsman walked over.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, you shouldn\u2019t care about this. It can\u2019t be helped.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s fine. I don\u2019t believe that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Outside!</p><br/><p>That middle-aged woman was making a call. \u201cDirector, that old man is here again.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIgnore him. It\u2019s all written in black and white. He can\u2019t just do whatever he wants,\u201d said the Director impatiently.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut we can\u2019t just let him cause a ruckus here every day. And Master Lin is here too. He seems to be helping that old man,\u201d said the middle-aged woman.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin?\u201d The Director had not expected that Master Lin would get involved in this. Then, he thought about it. \u201cAlright, just ignore it for now. Even if it\u2019s Master Lin, he can\u2019t do anything about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMmm, I got it,\u201d replied the middle-aged woman.</p><br/><p>She looked inside. They were still there. She wasn\u2019t about to go in again, so she just hid outside. She had really been troubled by this. How could she not know what was going on inside? It was all just procedures.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked around and felt that, sometimes, one man\u2019s power was really limited.</p><br/><p>Then, he took out his phone and made a call.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello, I\u2019m Master Lin. I want to report an incident. At Rong Mao. Yes, I\u2019ll wait for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>After hanging up, he made another call.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2018Today News Agency\u2019, I\u2019m Master Lin. I want to report an incident. I\u2019m at Rong Mao now.\u201d</p><br/><p>One after another, he made tens of calls before he finally stopped.</p><br/><p>The old man looked at Master Lin. \u201cWho did you call?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan grinned. \u201cReporters.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s useless. Reporters are useless. I\u2019ve already tried all these methods,\u201d said the old man as he shook his head.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cIt won\u2019t hurt to try, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>The surrounding townsfolk were all stunned.</p><br/><p>They had counted that Master Lin had made a total of thirty-two calls. Didn\u2019t that mean that he had called thirty-two news agencies? This was really going to blow up.</p>\n</div>"}

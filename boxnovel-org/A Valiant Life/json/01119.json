In the first-class cabin.</p><br/><p>Han Jun had a handsome face with a feminine look. His brows were drawn on and there was some makeup on his face.</p><br/><p>In reality, he had bad skin. But with Photoshop and with the use of make-up, his flaws were all covered up.</p><br/><p>His audience definitely wouldn\u2019t realize it.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre the security measures in place already?\u201d asked Han Jun. He really couldn\u2019t stand those maniacal fans. Every time he came out, it was extremely dangerous.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey\u2019re all in place. We have twenty security guards. Those fans definitely won\u2019t break through the safety barrier,\u201d said the manager with a smile. This time, they had come to Beijing to attend some business meetings. They had publicized their plans a long time ago so that more fans would be present to welcome them.</p><br/><p>At the same time, they wanted to let everyone know how influential Han Jun was.</p><br/><p>The manager was already thinking that the place would definitely be filled with people. Those passionate fans might even overfill the airport.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good. Those fans are really too crazy.\u201d Han Jun let out a deep breath. He was really helpless regarding the number of fans he had. But for some reason, he felt great too.</p><br/><p>The manager smiled and said, \u201cWe\u2019ve already contacted the airport. They\u2019ll arrange for their own security guards to come as well. There definitely won\u2019t be any problems.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, the airplane announcement sounded. They had reached the airport and were about to land.</p><br/><p>Han Jun took out his mirror and took a close look to ensure that he was looking perfect. Then, he looked at his manager and asked, \u201cThere\u2019s no problem with how I look, is there?\u201d</p><br/><p>His manager took a close look at him before replying, \u201cNo problem at all. Everything is perfect. When the fans see you, they\u2019ll definitely scream crazily.\u201d</p><br/><p>The airport.</p><br/><p>The director in charge of maintaining order in the airport hurriedly gathered the employees. \u201cGo over to that side quickly. The celebrity, Han Jun, will be reaching the airport soon. We have to ensure the safety on-site. We can\u2019t let the fans be too crazy.</p><br/><p>The ten over security guards nodded. They had no idea what exactly was going on and they couldn\u2019t understand what was so great about this celebrity. Why would he have so many fans?</p><br/><p>But they had worked in the airport for a long time and, naturally, they had seen many such situations. These situations could be said to be very shocking. The scenes would be explosive and would be enough to scare people to death.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, on another plane, an old man had his eyes closed, seemingly fatigued. There were two security guards next to him but they seemed very normal. One wouldn\u2019t feel that there was anything special about the three of them.</p><br/><p>Very soon, the plane arrived at the airport.</p><br/><p>The reporters had arrived too. They knew that the big celebrity, Han Jun, was coming. Hence, they were waiting there. However, the current situation wasn\u2019t quite right.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, what\u2019s going on? There are about ten people there holding up signs. They\u2019re here to welcome Han Jun. But there are so many people on the other side. Who are those people here for?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you stupid? That must be where Han Jun\u2019s fans are. These ten fellas must have got it wrong. Let\u2019s go. We have to hurry over there.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMmm. You\u2019re right.\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporters quickly changed their positions. They had no idea what those ten people holding the signs were doing.</p><br/><p>Suddenly!</p><br/><p>A series of ear-piercing screams filled the air.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh! Han Jun\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJun Jun\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Those ten over people screamed at the top of their lungs. Although they were small in number, their presence was not weak at all.</p><br/><p>The airport security rushed over and Han Jun\u2019s security guards started taking action as well, forming two human walls.</p><br/><p>But looking at the situation, the security guards were stunned.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Han Jun, who had just walked out of the airport, saw the situation and his expression changed drastically.</p><br/><p><em>What the f*ck is going on?</em></p><br/><p>Those ten over fans raised their signs high as they continued their heartrending screams. The atmosphere wasn\u2019t just lacking. It even made Han Jun feel a little awkward.</p><br/><p>The airport security pursed their lips as they cursed in their hearts. F*ck. What is this? Just a few people have gotten them all worried. <em>This\u2026 Sigh\u2026</em></p><br/><p>Their initially nervous hearts had calmed down. Then, they placed their hands down and moved aside.</p><br/><p>Including Han Jun\u2019s security guards, there were over thirty security guards. There were even more of them than the fans.</p><br/><p>Han Jun looked at his manager with a dazed look. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Didn\u2019t you notify the fans that I\u2019d be coming?\u201d</p><br/><p>The manager was as dumbfounded as well. \u201cI did notify them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen this\u2026\u201d Han Jun pointed at the situation in front of him. Over ten of his fans were standing there, screaming like a bunch of idiots. They had even drawn strange looks from the passersby.</p><br/><p>It was as if they were putting on a show by themselves.</p><br/><p>When the reporters saw this, they were stunned. Then, they looked at each other. \u201cD*mn. What\u2019s going on? Han Jun is over there.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis can\u2019t be right. Han Jun is so popular. How could there be so few people welcoming him? What\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go. We have to hurry up and take some photos over there. This is big news. Look at those security guards at Han Jun\u2019s side. There are even more of them than there are fans. Although it\u2019s a big event, there are way too little fans here.\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporters immediately went in front of Han Jun. \u201cThis time, there are only so few fans to receive you. Do you have anything to say?\u201d</p><br/><p>The manager blocked off the reporters. \u201cSorry. This time, we are making a low-profile trip. We didn\u2019t notify the fans.\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporters were stunned. <em>You didn\u2019t notify the fans? Who are you trying to kid?</em>The reporters had hidden amongst the fan groups and they knew that Han Jun had already notified the fans long ago.</p><br/><p>At that moment, a fan said furiously, \u201cIt\u2019s all because of that Master Lin. Otherwise, we would have lots of people here.\u201d</p><br/><p>When the reporters beard that, they were stunned. They looked at the fans and asked, \u201cMaster Lin? Where is he?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOver there.\u201d That young female fan ranted, \u201cWhat a despicable guy. He actually snatched our Jun Jun\u2019s fans away. Those people had already agreed to welcome Jun Jun previously but they suddenly changed their minds. All of us here are Jun Jun\u2019s true fans.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Han Jun heard this fan\u2019s words, his face became darker. He started cursing in his heart.</p><br/><p><em>What a f*cking retard.</em></p><br/><p><em>We just said that we didn\u2019t notify them but she actually revealed the truth.</em></p><br/><p><em>Who knows how the reporters will report this tomorrow? </em>Thinking about all the possible content that might appear the next day, Han Jun became too afraid to imagine it.</p><br/><p>Even the manager was slightly stifled. She hadn\u2019t expected this to happen.</p><br/><p>However, what surprised them even more was that Master Lin was here at the airport.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, a loud shout came from afar.</p><br/><p>\u201cWelcome back, Scholar Ma!\u201d</p><br/><p>This voice was resounding.</p><br/><p>Then, a series of even louder voices closely followed.</p><br/><p>\u201cWelcome back, Scholar Ma.\u201d</p><br/><p>Those people didn\u2019t know who this Scholar Ma was but since Master Lin had shouted, they just followed him. There wouldn\u2019t be a problem with that.</p><br/><p>When the reporters saw this, they picked up their cameras.</p><br/><p>\u201cQuick. Let\u2019s go and see what\u2019s going on.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, their presence is way too strong.\u201d</p><br/><p>In an instant, the reporters had dashed to the other side.</p></div>\n</div>"}

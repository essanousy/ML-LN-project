Reporters these days are really crafty with their questions.\u201d Lin Fan sighed. He sat down and took a sip of tea.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian came over. \u201cI don\u2019t think they are crafty. They\u2019re just too familiar with you. They\u2019ve interviewed you so many times that they don\u2019t know what to ask anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWow, Fraud, you\u2019re really clear-minded to be able to think of that. I feel really proud that you finally have a clear mind now,\u201d said Lin Fan with a chuckle.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn. What are you talking about? When has my mind ever been unclear? Only people like you with unrefined vision would think that way.\u201d Fraud Tian shook his head and didn\u2019t say more. He didn\u2019t want to say a single word anymore. It seemed as if he had been hurt by Lin Fan\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan burst into laughter.</p><br/><p>At that moment, he noticed that there were a few children at the entrance. They were carrying backpacks and pointing at the shop.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was startled. It can\u2019t be that they\u2019re here for revenge so soon, right?</p><br/><p>\u201cKids, what are you all doing?\u201d He felt that he had to make the first move and seize the higher ground, so he decided to find out what these kids wanted to do.</p><br/><p>But once he said this, the kids outside immediately fled.</p><br/><p>He smiled. He had no idea what was going on. Why had the kids run off just like that? He hadn\u2019t even had time to respond.</p><br/><p><em>Ding ding!</em></p><br/><p>A call from Wang Ming Yang came.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, Brother, those songs you wrote for Huan Yue that time are too f*cking awesome. They\u2019ve won an award!\u201d Over the phone, Wang Ming Yang\u2019s excitement could be heard.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said calmly, \u201cAh, isn\u2019t that very normal? What\u2019s the big deal?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang responded, \u201cThat\u2019s true. I was too excited. These songs were all written by you. You must have known how good they were all along.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, right. How has Huan Yue been recently?\u201d Lin Fan had not asked this question for a long time now. After all, Wu Huan Yue was in the field for a while now.</p><br/><p>In the musical world, because all her songs were written by Lin Fan, they were all classics. She didn\u2019t receive any criticism at all. Moreover, her style was always changing. She would never be stuck with a single style.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang hesitated a little. \u201cHow should I put this? She has been improving, but it seems like the improvement isn\u2019t huge. Right now, Huan Yue can be considered very famous in the musical world. Basically everyone has heard of her. But the problem is that she has not broken into the movie market.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cOh, there\u2019s no hurry. She only just debuted last year. Reaching where she is now is already a solid achievement.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang said, \u201cIt is pretty good indeed. But with a big shot like you supporting her, she ought to have even greater results.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBe patient. This matter must be taken slowly. What\u2019s the rush?\u201d said Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Then, he exchanged a few more words with Wang Ming Yang before hanging up.</p><br/><p>The next day!</p><br/><p>The news appeared on the Internet.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe impact of second pregnancies\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOnline crimes: Pay attention to the older child in the family\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBreaking! A group of scum were actually doing this\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMany problems exist on the Internet. More regulations on online chatting software are needed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin successfully rescues the budding flowers of our nation as a large number of criminals fall into the hands of justice.\u201d</p><br/><p>When these news articles were released, the netizens were instantly dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>\u201cF<em>ck! Something like this actually happened? That\u2019s too f</em>cking disgusting.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI suggest that we lock these perverted people up for life. They actually did something like this. They should just die.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat were those kids thinking? Although they\u2019re young, they can\u2019t be that stupid, can they? Could it be that as times are advancing, their intelligence is deteriorating?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm, this is interesting. The government isn\u2019t being too controlling at all. If they don\u2019t regulate things, we will really be doomed. This messaging software company is going to be in trouble this time. They actually allowed such a group to exist on their platform.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFortunately, Master Lin came across it. Otherwise, who knows how things would have turned out?\u201d</p><br/><p>The discussions on the Internet were intense. This wasn\u2019t a small matter at all. It was huge.</p><br/><p>At the same time, some parents who were about to have second children were stunned when they saw this. They couldn\u2019t help but think about the situation in their own families. Then, they called the whole family to discuss. They even brought their children out to play in order to show care for the children and talk to them</p><br/><p>To them, if what the news was saying was true, it would be horrifying.</p><br/><p>Those people who specialized in targeting children were really horrifying. If it really were to happen to them, it would be too late to have regrets.</p><br/><p>The messaging software company\u2019s public relations personnel was shocked when he saw the news. He definitely had to take care of this at once.</p><br/><p>If people were to dig into the matter, there would be trouble.</p><br/><p>Then, he immediately dispatched his \u201cdeleting\u201d crew. Any content related to this matter was deleted. One could say they were willing to kill off a thousand innocent ones just so that not a single guilty one was let off.</p><br/><p>In an instant, those related groups on the platform were all deleted. There was no warning or explanation given. They were just deleted.</p><br/><p>Some hosts of groups that had been innocently killed off started crying miserably. The groups that they had spent so much effort to build were gone just like that. It was f*cked up.</p><br/><p>Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan saw what had happened, he smiled. He had not expected the company to react so fast.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Boss, you really have a sharp eye!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, if Little Boss had not come across it, things would have turned out horribly.\u201d</p><br/><p>The queuing townsfolk raised their thumbs in praise.</p><br/><p>They were a little shocked by this incident as well. They had not expected that something like this had been happening. After all, in their minds, it was impossible.</p><br/><p>But looking at it now, they realized that they should never deem something as impossible just because it didn\u2019t seem possible to them.</p><br/><p>There were actually many more events that came as surprises to people. They could even be said to be unbelievable.</p><br/><p>Facing the townsfolk\u2019s praise, Lin Fan nodded calmly. He had already come to accept such praise.</p><br/><p>After all, those praises were all true. He really did have a sharp eye. He had seen through the entire case with one glance.</p><br/><p>As for what would happen to those pedophiles, they would be accompanied by cold metal bars for now. What happened next didn\u2019t concern Lin Fan anymore.</p><br/><p>After all, he was just a scallion pancake-selling Little Boss.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright everyone, get in line. We\u2019re going to start giving out the number tags,\u201d said Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian gave out the number tags routinely. As he saw so many townsfolk queuing, his heart ached.</p><br/><p>This was meant to be a fortune. But they only sold ten servings a day. It really felt like a crime.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

She immediately put down everything, \u201cThey\u2019re here, they\u2019re here! Son, come out quick!\u201d After completing her sentence, she opened the door.</p><br/><p>A smile emerged on her face after she opened the door and saw the people outside, \u201cCome in, come in! There\u2019s no need to take out your shoes. Come in!\u201d</p><br/><p>Although Shan Wei Yan\u2019s dad wasn\u2019t too happy with the house, he still managed a smile, \u201cAlright, alright. Since it\u2019s our first time here, we didn\u2019t buy you anything.\u201d</p><br/><p>Teacher Xia replied, \u201cYour presence is enough! There\u2019s no need to buy anything. Come in, please!\u201d After which, she shouted towards the kitchen, \u201cWhy are you still standing inside? Hurry up and come out to greet the guests!\u201d</p><br/><p>Shen Hong didn\u2019t smoke on a regular basis, but today, he had bought a pack of Zhong Hua cigarettes. He quickly helped Father Shan to light a stick.</p><br/><p>Father Shan nodded his head and went past him. He went to look around the moment he stepped into the house.</p><br/><p>The house was rather small.</p><br/><p>But it was still rather clean.</p><br/><p>\u201cShen Liang, why are you still hanging around in the house? Hurry out and meet the guests!\u201d Teacher Xia shouted. She then embarrassedly told the guests, \u201cThis child is rather shy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Father Shan laughed, \u201cNo worries. We\u2019ll see how this kid is like.\u201d</p><br/><p>They only had one daughter, so naturally, they\u2019d be more particular. Their family was still moderately affluent. Their jobs were also rather dignified. Who says that the house is all that matters? They still had to look at the child. If the child was the kind that had not been brought up well, then it still wouldn\u2019t be acceptable even if the other party had a lot of money.</p><br/><p>Shen Liang was rather nervous. He came into the living room and greeted, \u201cGood morning, uncle and auntie.\u201d</p><br/><p>Father Shan and Mother Shan widened their eyes and nodded inwardly. This kid wasn\u2019t too bad. He was refined in mannerisms, which could be considered rather attractive. They were rather satisfied with him. It was now down to their daughter to decide.</p><br/><p>Shan Wei Yan scanned Shen Liang intently. Her face was rather red, after all, it was her first time dating. She was also rather embarrassed. However, overall, she was still doing okay.</p><br/><p>However, Yang Ning Ning had rather high standards. Such an ordinary person had nothing to catch her attention.</p><br/><p>Father Shan opened his mouth and said, \u201cI\u2019m rather satisfied with this child. Daughter, how about you? If you aren\u2019t satisfied, just say it. There\u2019s nothing wrong.\u201d</p><br/><p>Teacher Xia stood by the side and laughed, \u201cYes, yes. If you aren\u2019t satisfied, just say it. If dating isn\u2019t successful, at least you can still be friends.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shan Wei Yan nodded her head rather embarrassedly. \u201cDad, I\u2019m alright.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing this, Teacher Xia\u2019s family laughed. This was a good step ahead. The children had agreed.</p><br/><p>In the living room, everyone chatted up. Teacher Xia went to get busy in the kitchen.</p><br/><p>Very quickly, the time had arrived.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s eat, Brother Shan. Do you want some wine?\u201d Shen Hong asked. This was what the host should do.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Father Shan nodded his head. If there was anything to talk about, they\u2019d talk about it at the dinner table. And they had to make things clear.</p><br/><p>They started eating.</p><br/><p>Very quickly, half an hour had passed.</p><br/><p>Father Shan put his cup of wine down, \u201cTeacher Shen, I\u2019m going to put this bluntly. I only have one daughter. Our family isn\u2019t poor, but neither are we very rich. I\u2019m very happy with your kid, Shen Liang. However, if they are to get married, I\u2019m hoping that your son would be able to provide a house. My family will provide the interior decoration and house appliances. I don\u2019t want my daughter to suffer later, or to not have a safe environment.</p><br/><p>Shen Hong grit his teeth, \u201cOkay, that\u2019s possible. However, our family doesn\u2019t have that much money. However, we\u2019d definitely be able to afford the down-payment. Is it okay with you all?\u201d</p><br/><p>Father Shan nodded his head, \u201cOkay. We aren\u2019t unreasonable people. Paying the down-payment is enough. We\u2019ll let the children earn their own money for the furniture.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yang Ning Ning was using her phone. She was actually texting Shan Wei Yan.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy would your father agree to this? This guy\u2019s house is mediocre. You can totally do better than this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, I\u2019ll just listen to my mum and dad. Moreover, this Shen Liang seems rather nice.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re okay with this? You\u2019re just a wooden block. In future, when you go to work, when you are released from work, when you cook, or when you buy stuff, you\u2019ll have to go through meticulous planning and calculations. How uninteresting is that? How about you disagree with this? I\u2019ll help you find someone better.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat won\u2019t be necessary. It seems rather good to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cArgh, why are you so stupid? This is a lifelong decision! Not just some small matter. Right now, the other party isn\u2019t even able to afford a house. In future, when everything has been settled, he still may not be able to buy a house!\u201d</p><br/><p>Mother Shan was sitting beside her daughter and naturally, she could read their chat. She read what Yang Ning Ning said and she felt that was true.</p><br/><p>As a parent, who wouldn\u2019t want the best for her child?</p><br/><p>This guy\u2019s family wasn\u2019t that bad. Their occupations were also good. However, it was just an ordinary family. She smiled and said, \u201cWe have said a lot today. Let\u2019s allow the children to mingle for a while. Let\u2019s talk some more after we finalize our decision?\u201d</p><br/><p>Father Shan was stunned. He didn\u2019t know why her wife said such things.</p><br/><p>However, when Teacher Xia heard this, she groaned inwardly. She felt that something wasn\u2019t quite right.</p><br/><p>Shan Wei Yan raised her head, \u201cMom, I feel that he\u2019s rather handsome.\u201d</p><br/><p>Teacher Xia\u2019s family was pleased when they heard this statement.</p><br/><p>\u201cShen Liang, why don\u2019t you bring her to your study to play for a bit. I\u2019ll be talking to auntie and uncle.\u201d Teacher Xia said.</p><br/><p>Shen Liang nodded, \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><br/><p>In the study.</p><br/><p>Yang Ning Ning couldn\u2019t really stand Shen Liang. She didn\u2019t even put him in her eyes. She didn\u2019t know what Shan Wei Yan saw in him.</p><br/><p>This house is just too dilapidated. If her own future boyfriend was to stay in such a place, she\u2019d definitely reject him.</p><br/><p>Shan Wei Yan scanned around his room. After which, she stared at a painting that was hung up on the wall, \u201cShen Liang, this painting is really pretty. Who painted it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shen Liang raised his head, \u201cI heard from my mum that it was a birthday gift from her student.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yang Ning Ning barged into the conversation, \u201cWho knows? They might just have spent ten dollars at a random roadside stall.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shen Liang laughed awkwardly.</p><br/><p>Shan Wei Yan frowned, \u201cNing Ning, don\u2019t say that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh.\u201d It seemed that Yang Ning Ning didn\u2019t take her words to heart. She sat in front of the computer and read the news.</p><br/><p>Shen Liang talked to Shan Wei Yan for a while. The two of them talked about a few small matters. Both of them were still unable to dispel the shyness between them.</p><br/><p>\u201cHoly sh*t, look at this news! Ten of Master Lin\u2019s paintings were taken in by the National Museum. One painting is worth at least ten million or more. Whoever has just one painting would be rich.\u201d Yang Ning Ning raised her voice and said.</p><br/><p>Shan Wei Yan and Shen Liang were both drawn over. They looked at the headlines and were immediately stunned.</p><br/><p>\u201cAmazing!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yang Ning Ning curled her lips, \u201cShen Liang, if your painting was painted by him, you\u2019d be rich.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHm?\u201d Shen Liang was momentarily dismayed, and then said, \u201cHow could that be?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yang Ning Ning said in disdain, \u201cIt\u2019s definitely not. If it is, the sun would rise from the West.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNing Ning.\u201d Shan Wei Yan was a little unhappy. Ning Ning was saying some nasty things.</p><br/><p>However, when Shan Wei Yan was about to help Ning Ning apologize to Shen Liang, she realized that he was just standing there like a fool, gazing at the painting.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Shan Wei Yan asked.</p><br/><p>Yang Ning Ning glanced at home, and said with some disdain, \u201cHe must definitely be thinking how good it would be if this painting was painted by Master Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>Just at this moment, Shen Liang finally reacted. He immediately pushed opened his door and ran towards the living room, \u201cMom, mom! Come here quick! What\u2019s the name of your student?\u201d</p><br/><p>The parents who were having a conversation at the dining table were shocked.</p><br/><p>Teacher Xia was rather unhappy at her son\u2019s impudence, \u201cWhat are you acting so crazy about?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shen Liang was feeling rather excited, \u201cMom! What\u2019s the name of your student who gave you the painting in the study room?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLin Fan. Why do you ask?\u201d Teacher Xia replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs he called Master Lin?\u201d Shen Hong asked again.</p><br/><p>Teacher Xia didn\u2019t quite understand. She thought about it, \u201cMy student did call himself Master Lin before.\u201d She then suspiciously asked, \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shen Liang was so excited that his face turned red, \u201cMom! Follow me for a while! I just read this piece of news. Just come with me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Teacher Xia didn\u2019t know what was going on, but she still followed him. Father Shan also tagged along.</p><br/><p>Inside the study room.</p><br/><p>Shen Liang pointed at the painting, \u201cMom! Look at this! \u2018Wishing Teacher Xia a happy birthday! Wishing you longevity! \u2013 From your student, Master Lin.'\u201d He then pointed at the news on the computer, \u201cMom! Look at this news. Are they the same person?\u201d</p><br/><p>Teacher Xia was stunned. She looked at the news on the computer, then looked back at the painting hung on the wall. She was astonished! She said in disbelief, \u201cIt can\u2019t be, can it?\u201d</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t dare to confirm it herself.</p><br/><p>However, Father Shan fixated his gaze on the painting, \u201cI\u2019ve read the news a few days ago. This Master Lin should be Lin Fan. The news going around right now is that one of Master Lin\u2019s pieces of artwork is worth up to ten million or more. In fact, it\u2019s so high in value but yet there\u2019s no market for it. There isn\u2019t even any of his artwork up for sale!\u201d</p><br/><p>Shen Hong stood at the side. He didn\u2019t say a word. His breathing seemed to have increased in pace. If this was true, what did it mean? He didn\u2019t even have to think about. He could be a millionaire in an instant.</p><br/><p>Yang Ning Ning was also stunned. She then skeptically said, \u201cHow could this be possible? Maybe they just have the same name and same surname?\u201d</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t believe this. If this was true, she wouldn\u2019t have any sense of superiority anymore. They were one painting away from being a millionaire. Who would be able to stand this?</p><br/><p>Shen Hong said, \u201cWife, why don\u2019t you make a call to your student? We won\u2019t have to keep guessing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Teacher Xia took out her phone, \u201cI\u2019ll call him now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Very quickly, the call got through.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher Xia, what is it?\u201d The voice of a young man could be heard through the phone.</p><br/><p>Teacher Xia asked, \u201cLil\u2019 Fan, let your teacher ask you this. Are you that Master Lin? You signed off with Master Lin on the painting you gave me, so\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan heard this through the phone, he momentarily laughed, \u201cTeacher, that\u2019s me! You haven\u2019t guessed wrongly. Right now, you have to keep my artwork safe. Currently, they have a high value but there\u2019s no market for it. The painting that I gave you is the Peace and Prosperity Painting. It\u2019s two meters by forty-three centimeters. It\u2019s considered one of the smaller paintings among my other artworks. If you are to sell it, it\u2019d easily be worth three to four million. However, I have a feeling that it\u2019d be higher, after all, none of my artworks are up on sale. Hence, many people prefer to keep them. If I am to die now, this painting could go up to billions\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone in the study was lost for words. When Lin Fan admitted that he was also known as Master Lin, all of them were completely and thoroughly stunned.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Teacher Xia hurriedly replied, \u201cLil\u2019 Fan, what kind of nonsense are you talking about? Your teacher didn\u2019t know! Let me return you the painting. It\u2019s too precious!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cTeacher, this is my birthday gift to you. If you are to return it to me, wouldn\u2019t you be looking down on me? This painting is considered yours now. It\u2019s none of my business if you sell it or give it to someone else. It\u2019s all up to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>During his teacher\u2019s birthday, he had already thought about this. Amongst all of his classes of knowledge, Chinese Art was the only one that could increase in value, and hence, he had given his teacher a painting. It was a form of thanks and repayment for all the care that Teacher Xia had given him during his time in the university.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not selling it. I\u2019m not going to sell it even if I\u2019m poor. Your teacher will definitely keep it and to pass it down the generations!\u201d Teacher Xia replied excitedly.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cThat\u2019s good! Teacher, if that\u2019s all, I\u2019ll put down the call now. Just call me if there\u2019s anything.\u201d</p><br/><p>Teacher Xia replied, \u201cOkay. Go and get a good rest, Lil\u2019 Fan. My son is currently on a date. If it\u2019s successful, you have to come for their wedding.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed, \u201cDefinitely. Even if Teacher doesn\u2019t invite me, I\u2019ll still come.\u201d</p><br/><p>After the call was put down, the room was completely silent.</p><br/><p>Shen Liang was still in shock. Never would he ever have thought that something worth millions would be hiding in his house.</p><br/><p>Shan Wei Yan\u2019s father sighed. Thereafter, he said, \u201cTeacher Shen, Teacher Xia, we\u2019ll take our leave now. We won\u2019t bother you.\u201d</p><br/><p>The situation now left both families on two different playing fields. The other party had a painting from a Master worth tens of millions. What rights did they have to negotiate with the other party? The other party obviously had better choices now.</p><br/><p>Teacher Xia said, \u201cHold on. Why leave when everything is going great? Didn\u2019t we say that we\u2019d let the children interact more? I\u2019m very pleased with your daughter. If possible, we should carry on.\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, both Father and Mother Shan smiled, \u201cOkay. Let us continue eating and let the children interact more.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><br/><p>Only Shen Liang and the other two were left in the study room.</p><br/><p>Yang Ning Ning\u2019s face suddenly looked constipated. This wasn\u2019t what she had imagined.</p><br/><p>How had it become like this all of a sudden?</p><br/><p>Of course, the painting was immediately kept by Teacher Xia. They didn\u2019t hang it in the study room anymore.</p><br/><p>It was just too precious.</p><br/><p>They didn\u2019t feel at ease placing such a precious item around.</p></div>\n</div>"}

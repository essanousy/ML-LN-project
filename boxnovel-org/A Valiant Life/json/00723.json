It was forty-five men against two, and if they were to get caught, it wouldn\u2019t be a pretty ending. They would definitely be beaten and chopped up into pieces, and it would have been impossible to run.</p><br/><p>Yun Xue Yao thought that they would probably have stood a better chance if they attempted to run. Even if they died, they couldn\u2019t just give up that easily.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yuan couldn\u2019t afford any delays. If the Yun Family got here in time, it would be curtains for him.</p><br/><p>He knew who the head of the Yun family was. He was a trustworthy and powerful man and was close to Yun Xue Yao.</p><br/><p>Finally, he could get some form of negotiation to get some investment in the casino. However, he still didn\u2019t know if he was going to succeed and now, there was this brat. It was such a major inconvenience!</p><br/><p>Now, he was using extreme tactics to get what he wanted.</p><br/><p>He had to force his way to get the investment. At the same time, he had to take Yun Xue Yao\u2019s nude pictures. If he had those pictures, he could use it as blackmail against the Yun family and he could finally get what he wanted. As for what the Yun family could do to him on the sly, he wasn\u2019t afraid at all.</p><br/><p>For now, his main concern was chopping that stupid brat into pieces.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy run? These guys are just pawns. Don\u2019t be scared,\u201d Lin Fan said, as he stretched out his hands, bringing Yun Xue Yao closer to himself, protecting her.</p><br/><p>Yun Xue Yao shrieked, not understanding what was going on. All she knew was that Lin Fan was holding her in his arms.</p><br/><p>\u201cGo to hell, pale face.\u201d</p><br/><p>The multitude of choppers glistened in the street lights as the thugs rushed over to Lin Fan, aiming for his head. Yun Xue Yao shut her eyes, preparing for the worst. She couldn\u2019t bear to see what was about to happen.</p><br/><p>Thump!</p><br/><p>Lin Fan lifted his legs, kicking the first thug that had ran towards him, causing him to be thrown back six meters. If Lin Fan had used more force, he would definitely have died.</p><br/><p>His chopper flung upwards into mid-air, and Lin Fan caught it as it descended.</p><br/><p>Yun Xue Yao who was still being held onto by Lin Fan was expecting Lin Fan to scream, but instead, it was the thug who had cried out in pain. She couldn\u2019t help but open her eyes in curiosity, and the scene that unfolded before her made her completely stunned.</p><br/><p>How could this be?</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was holding on to her with one hand and a chopper with the other hand. As the thugs rushed towards Lin Fan to take a swing at him, Lin Fan just blocked every single of their attacks while counter-attacking.</p><br/><p>It was carnage. Bodies were strewn across the floor.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m done holding you, let\u2019s go and beat them up,\u201d Lin Fan smiled, his face looking calm. Beating down these thugs were like dealing with ants- it didn\u2019t even require much effort at all.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan\u2019s male smell danced in Yun Xue Yao\u2019s nostrils, causing her to become a little disoriented.</p><br/><p>Of all the males that she had met, all of them were refined in their manner, and some of them were even effeminate. She had never seen someone who was that strong and rugged.</p><br/><p>Yun Xue Yao couldn\u2019t help but squeeze her grip on Lin Fan a little tighter, causing her to be even closer. It was as if her body was welded onto Lin Fan\u2019s</p><br/><p>Lin Fan furrowed his brows. There was a foreign object squashed against his body and the feeling was rather wonderful.</p><br/><p>However, it wasn\u2019t the right time to think of such things. There were other more pressing issues to settle.</p><br/><p>Ever since he had learned Wu Xia from the Encyclopedia, every single skirmish that he had been in was a piece of cake to him.</p><br/><p>After all, who could survive such an attack by such a large group of chopper-wielding thugs?</p><br/><p>It was pure brutality.</p><br/><p>Yun Xue Yao felt a sense of excitement tingling down her spine.</p><br/><p>She had only dreamed of this kind of scenario, and today, it had actually happened for real.</p><br/><p>From what she thought, this was an impossible situation. Who on earth would have been that powerful to be able to beat such a large group of aggressive thugs? It was as good as a dream- and Yun Xue Yao had seen it for real.</p><br/><p>While Lin Fan was fighting against the thugs, Yun Xue Yao\u2019s heart was pounding with adrenaline. The feeling was just too divine.</p><br/><p>Gradually!</p><br/><p>Yun Xue Yao realized that her pants had a little wet spot.</p><br/><p>Her face started blushing. She never thought that she was that kind of woman.</p><br/><p>Nothing had even happened, but why was she feeling this way?</p><br/><p>She stole a quick glance at Lin Fan\u2019s face. Even while he was defending himself, his face was as calm and peaceful as ever.</p><br/><p>Ah!</p><br/><p>A shrieking sound went on endlessly as Zhang Yuan looked on at the bloodshed before him. He had been frightened thoroughly.</p><br/><p>How was it possible that someone that awesome existed?</p><br/><p>All his forty-five men were all on the ground, groaning in pain. If he hadn\u2019t seen it for himself, he wouldn\u2019t have believed it.</p><br/><p>Unbelievable.</p><br/><p>All of his men were on the ground- not one of them could even stand.</p><br/><p>Clang!</p><br/><p>Zhang Yuan\u2019s chopper dropped on the floor. He stood there rooted with fright, looking at Lin Fan in terror.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan lobbed the chopper in his hands, causing it to land exactly in front of Zhang Yuan.</p><br/><p>Plop!</p><br/><p>Zhang Yuan got on his knees, his body trembling with fear.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you a human or a demon?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled, \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cXue Yao, that\u2019s enough. You can let go of me now,\u201d Lin Fan said in a helpless tone.</p><br/><p>The problem as finally over. However, Yun Xue Yao continued to hold on to Lin Fan with a tight grip. Her waist was slender and had elastic force. Although they were separated by clothing, Lin Fan could still feel her body pressed against his.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Yun Xue Yao reacted, immediately releasing her grip. However, she did it gradually, and there was a sense of reluctance as she did it.</p><br/><p>Her face blushed as she turned to look around at the scene. \u201cBrother Lin, you are really amazing\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing much. Oh, you called some people to come right? When are they coming over?\u201d Lin Fan asked, smiling.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt should be soon,\u201d Yun Xue Tao said. She was still trying to process what had just happened. It was just one man, and he beat all forty-five of them\u2026</p><br/><p>The strongest bouncer at the casino couldn\u2019t even stand a chance against Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Not long after.</p><br/><p>The people from the Yun family had finally arrived along with a few police officers.</p><br/><p>The members of the Yun family were all businessmen, especially Mr. Yun who had a great flourishing reputation.</p><br/><p>\u201cXue Yao, are you alright?\u201d At this moment, a middle-aged man walked over. From appearance, he looked about fifty years old and was in good health.</p><br/><p>\u201cDad, I\u2019m fine. If it wasn\u2019t for Brother Lin, I wouldn\u2019t be standing alive here right now,\u201d Yun Xue Yao said.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked around and his eyes met with the father of Yun Xue Yao. He gave a slight nod, greeting him.</p><br/><p>\u201cWas he the one who saved you?\u201d Yun Guo Xing\u2019s voice was calm but restrained. Anyone could tell that he was seething with anger.</p><br/><p>Yun Xue Yao nodded her head, thereafter telling her father everything that happened.</p><br/><p>Yun Guo Xing burst with anger after hearing what had happened. \u201cBring him here and break his limbs.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even with the police officers around, Yun Guo Xing just went on with his business. The police officers of Hao Jiang acted as if nothing had happened, and they didn\u2019t stop what was about to happen.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo\u2026 no\u2026 please\u2026 ah!\u201d Zhang Yuan was screaming with terror, thereafter fainting on the spot.</p><br/><p>\u201cMr. Yun, we\u2019ll bring all these men away,\u201d one of the police officers said.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood. Also, I don\u2019t want to see the face of that man ever again,\u201d Yun Guo Xing said.</p><br/><p>\u201cRest assured. He won\u2019t come back to Hao Jiang any time soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>The meaning was clear. Zhang Yuan was about to receive a life sentence.</p><br/><p>\u201cMr. Lin, thank you,\u201d Yun Guo Xing extended his hands out to shake Lin Fan\u2019s hands.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d Lin Fan replied.</p><br/><p>Yun Xue Yao\u2019s face blushed as she looked at Lin Fan\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>After all the thugs and Zhang Yuan had been taken in by the police officers, the rest of the Yun family made their way back home, inviting Lin Fan along with them.</p><br/><p>This situation caused Yun Tai Nian to burst with anger. At the same time, he was extremely thankful that Lin Fan was there to thwart the situation.</p><br/><p>The gathering was simple- it was a family meal.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan couldn\u2019t believe what he was seeing. Yun Tai Nian had so many sons and daughters. However, it seemed that some of them weren\u2019t living harmoniously with each other.</p><br/><p>Coming to think about it, Yun Tai Nian did have a few houses in his compound.</p><br/><p>It was the same father but a different mother. There would naturally be a barrier between the families.</p><br/><p>However, Yun Tai Nian had personally invited everyone to the table for dinner. Even, if there was disharmony between the families, no one dared to express their views.</p><br/><p>At night, Lin Fan didn\u2019t return to his hotel room but stayed in the Yun family house.</p><br/><p>Lying on his bed, his brain was still a little confused. However, it wasn\u2019t much of a problem.</p><br/><p>*Knock knock*</p><br/><p>Just at this moment, a knocking sound came from the door to his room.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Lin, it\u2019s me\u2026\u201d the voice on the other side of the door was soft, but he could hear it clearly.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan\u2019s heart was racing. Why on earth was Yun Xue Yao here in the middle of the night?</p></div>\n</div>"}

It was the first time that they had organized a gathering after graduation. If he didn\u2019t appear, he\u2019d definitely be cursed by people.</p><br/><p>In the past, he hadn\u2019t been powerful yet and he would have been too shameful to go for an event like this.</p><br/><p>However, he was so capable now and if he didn\u2019t go, people would think that he looked down on them.</p><br/><p>It was a vexing issue.</p><br/><p>He looked at the calendar and it was only mid-September. There was still time.</p><br/><p>The next day!</p><br/><p>Lin Fan immediately called Fraud Tian and asked them to take care of the shop. He wanted to go to Beijing to attend the important exhibition. After that, Wang Ming Yang called.</p><br/><p>When he knew that Lin Fan was going to Beijing, he wanted to sign up for it too. He didn\u2019t care about what Lin Fan thought of it. He immediately went to the airport.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan felt extremely helpless but he wasn\u2019t really bothered by it since he had company now. However, Lin Fan knew that he wouldn\u2019t be lonely since Wu Yun Gang was living in the capital.</p><br/><p>The two of them met at the airport. Wang Ming Yang lugged his luggage and walked towards Lin Fan. \u201cYou didn\u2019t even tell me about leaving this time. You have to tell me when you leave for the capital in the future. I frequent Beijing and I\u2019m familiar with the place.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I were to bring you along, it\u2019d definitely cause more trouble for me. I\u2019m going for only one or two days. Why did you bring so many things? It\u2019s as if you\u2019re going on a vacation,\u201d Lin Fan said. However, he was extremely busy these days and he didn\u2019t have time for Wang Ming Yang.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang was stunned. \u201cWhat is it? Isn\u2019t it normal? Look, a set for chilling, one more for meetings, and one for the main event. I need at least three sets in a day. If I\u2019m there for two days, I have to bring six sets of clothes\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, stop it. I can\u2019t handle your life. What time is the flight?\u201d Lin Fan immediately waved his hand. This fella was so particular about everything. The luggage was probably filled with clothes.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe have to register an hour later. Let\u2019s go.\u201d Wang Ming Yang was in a good mood. Initially, he had been supposed to go to Beijing to meet Wu Yun Gang for a partnership discussion. Now that Lin Fan was heading there too, he thought that it\u2019d be good for him to go there earlier.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang had a special partnership with the airport and he was the super VIP of the airport. He didn\u2019t have to book his tickets in advance. He just needed to go there on the day itself and ask for them. Lin Fan had gotten his tickets thanks to Wang Ming Yang.</p><br/><p>In the afternoon!</p><br/><p>Beijing airport.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang put his arm around Lin Fan\u2019s shoulders. Lin Fan nudged him. \u201cDon\u2019t do that. People might think we\u2019re gay.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, what\u2019s wrong with that? It\u2019s just a sign of brotherhood,\u201d Wang Ming Yang said helplessly.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shrugged his shoulders. \u201cIt\u2019s so weird. Just walk normally on your own. Don\u2019t do such things. Didn\u2019t you mention that Wu Yun Gang would meet us at the airport?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, he knew that you\u2019re coming and he\u2019s even more excited about you than me. This friend of mine makes me feel depressed.\u201d Wang Ming Yang said in despair. At the same time, he sounded a little jealous.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha.\u201d Lin Fan smiled. \u201cAlright, let\u2019s have a good meal tonight and tomorrow we can do our own things. Don\u2019t follow me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang was upset. \u201cWhat do you mean follow you? I\u2019m not a follower. I came to Beijing for something major. It\u2019s a big project that\u2019s worth a few billion dollars.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan stopped and looked at Wang Ming Yang to read his fortune.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang knew that his friend\u2019s fortune-telling abilities were awesome. He smiled. \u201cHow is it? Will this business be successful? I won\u2019t lie, I\u2019m quite confident about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although Wang Ming Yang was smiling, he was extremely anxious. If Lin Fan said that it was bound to fail, he definitely wouldn\u2019t invest in it.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go. No problem at all, it\u2019s just a small matter. You\u2019ll earn a lot in the future,\u201d Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang patted his chest and heaved a sigh of relief. \u201cThat\u2019s right. I told you I\u2019m confident about it. I have studied it for so long and if it\u2019s a success, the yearly profits will be pretty good. I have discussed it with Yun Gang and the both of us can be partners. It will definitely be successful.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cDon\u2019t tell me all of that. I don\u2019t care about it. This project is situated in Beijing and you have to come here frequently in the future. You have to look out for your safety.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know, I\u2019m not a kid. Safety first,\u201d Wang Ming Yang said and waved his hand.</p><br/><p>When they exited the airport.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang realized that there were a lot of people in front of them and he smiled. \u201cHey, there\u2019s a celebrity. Look at these girls. They\u2019re crazy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOppa!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOppa!\u201d</p><br/><p>The peaceful and calm airport suddenly became lively. Those girls were raising their signboards and cheering loudly.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang wanted to turn behind but suddenly, he was pushed from behind. If not for Lin Fan\u2019s swift actions, he would\u2019ve fallen down.</p><br/><p>At that instant.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan frowned and was prepared to push those that were behind them. Then, those security officers looked at them and started speaking gibberish. Lin Fan quickly did some moves and pushed them to the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you guys pushing?\u201d Lin Fan scolded.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, they must be crazy. Didn\u2019t they see that we\u2019re in front?\u201d Wang Ming Yang steadied himself and chided.</p><br/><p>The situation caused the cheering to stop.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you injured?\u201d Lin Fan asked.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m okay. If not for you, I\u2019d have ended up on the floor.\u201d</p><br/><p>In front of them.</p><br/><p>A group of uniformed security officers surrounded a man with golden hair.</p><br/><p>\u201c[email\u00a0protected]#%*[email\u00a0protected]%\u2026\u201d A security officer mumbled.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan didn\u2019t understand him. \u201cFind someone that knows how to speak properly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang said, \u201cIt\u2019s a Korean celebrity. I think he\u2019s called Jin Xuan Ming. Recently, they filmed a show here and he got famous because of it. He has a lot of fans.\u201d</p><br/><p>There were a lot of reporters at the airport. They were filming what was happening.</p><br/><p>Then, an airport staff came. \u201cHe said he\u2019s a celebrity and he wants you to excuse yourselves.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan frowned. \u201cSo what if he\u2019s a celebrity? It doesn\u2019t give him the right to push my friend. Apologise now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, a girl beside the celebrity went forward, \u201cDear gentlemen, sorry. Please forgive him.\u201d Then, she bowed.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease be careful next time. It\u2019s China here, don\u2019t act like you\u2019re so powerful.\u201d Lin Fan couldn\u2019t be bothered to say too much. \u201cLet\u2019s go. Yun Gang must be waiting for us anxiously.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang swept his clothes and took a glance at the people behind.</p><br/><p>\u201c????\u201d The person that was standing in between all the security officers, Jin Xuan Ming shouted something in an unpleasant tone.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was prepared to leave but he suddenly stopped, \u201cWhat did he say?\u201d</p><br/><p>The celebrity\u2019s staff shook his head. \u201cNothing. He didn\u2019t say anything.\u201d</p><br/><p>The airport staff frowned. \u201cHe said you\u2019re an idiot\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at Jin Xuan Ming and saw that he was smirking. His staff was also laughing as if they weren\u2019t bothered by it.</p><br/><p>\u201cMing Yang, help me carry these.\u201d Lin Fan passed the luggage to Wang Ming Yang and tilted his head. \u201cNot bad\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan sprinted towards them and did a leap. He jumped over the security officers and everyone was stunned.</p><br/><p>Then, a lot of people at the airport were looking over to see what was happening. They didn\u2019t know what this man wanted to do.</p><br/><p>Jin Xuan Ming was also stunned. He started to say something but nobody knew what he was saying. However, it definitely wasn\u2019t something pleasant.</p><br/><p>\u201cEat sh*t\u2026!\u201d Lin Fan didn\u2019t even hesitate. He immediately kicked him.</p><br/><p>At that instant.</p><br/><p>The entire place was in an uproar.</p><br/><p>Then, everyone gasped in shock.</p><br/><p>It was as if something horrible had happened.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

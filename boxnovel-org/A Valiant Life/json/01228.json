Is Master Lin for real?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, it seems like the case. It can\u2019t be formaldehyde. These people weren\u2019t wearing masks, and the smell is unbearable. Look at the liquid.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHa, you\u2019re an idiot. How could you just believe whatever Lin is saying? It\u2019s definitely formaldehyde.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI saw something like this done to bananas too. The green ones had to be soaked in a liquid like this too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c^ Just shut up. It just shows how stupid you are. Bananas aren\u2019t ripe when they\u2019re harvested. If you can find a ripe banana to harvest, I will eat sh*t.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c^ F*ck, where were you earlier when they were talking about this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have said this many times. You should do some research on your own. How could you just flame Master Lin like this? A bunch of idiots.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone, don\u2019t be fooled by Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck, who should I believe now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I really had to pick someone to believe, I would still choose Master Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>The discussions on the Internet went wild. Many people were arguing about this issue.</p><br/><p>People who did not know much about things like this would definitely be easily fooled. However, now that Master Lin had explained the issue, they felt more relieved about it.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the situation on Weibo and heaved a sigh of relief. The situation seemed to be improving. If things had gone downhill, he wondered what would have really happened.</p><br/><p>He would have caused these orange farmers to lose so much hard-earned income.</p><br/><p>At the village.</p><br/><p>Chen Shan was nervous. He had already explained the situation, but nobody believed him. He could not let things continue to be like this.</p><br/><p>Chen Xiao Dong was also nervous and furious. He wondered who posted that online to harm them. It was really damaging to them.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat should we do?\u201d The farmers asked.</p><br/><p>They had worked so hard. If the oranges remained unsold, their efforts would go to waste.</p><br/><p><em>ring, ring</em></p><br/><p>Then, Chen Xiao Dong\u2019s phone rang. When he saw that it was a foreign number, he prepared himself for another scolding. It was difficult for him to explain everything to everyone.</p><br/><p>He picked up the phone and something happened unexpectedly.</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry, I sent an angry text to you earlier. It was a misunderstanding. I was going to send these fruits to my friends. Help me prepare $1000 worth of oranges. I will transfer the money via WeChat later.\u201d</p><br/><p>When he heard what the person said, Chen Xiao Dong was stunned. He had not expected that at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello, are you there?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Xiao Dong immediately replied, \u201cYes, yes. It\u2019s just a misunderstanding. Actually, it\u2019s not formaldehyde.\u201d</p><br/><p>The person on the phone replied, \u201cI know, Master Lin already explained the situation on Weibo. I didn\u2019t expect that there would be someone so evil.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Xiao Dong was stunned after hearing that Master Lin had helped to explain the situation. He realised that he had scolded Master Lin in the past before on his Weibo account.</p><br/><p>After hanging up the phone, Chen Xiao Dong went to Master Lin\u2019s Weibo and became so emotional that he almost cried.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you so much, Master Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>That was the only thing he could do to express his gratitude to Master Lin.</p><br/><p>Anyway, there was not much time for him to think about this. His phone continued to ring, and he kept receiving texts too.</p><br/><p>The texts were sent by the people who had scolded him earlier. They texted him to apologise. Chen Xiao Dong was overwhelmed with emotions, and he started to tear up.</p><br/><p>\u201cDad, Master Lin explained the situation for us. We\u2019re going to be busy again. The phones are ringing again,\u201d Chen Xiao Dong said.</p><br/><p>Chen Shan was stunned. He had not expected this at all, and he was really happy about it.</p><br/><p>At Cloud Street!</p><br/><p>\u201cLook, what\u2019s this fella trying to spread? It\u2019s all gone now,\u201d Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian replied, \u201cThe credit goes to me, please. If not for me, you wouldn\u2019t have known.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. \u201cFraud, the credit goes to you, but if I did not post it on Weibo, nobody would have known.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I think I have to attract some fans on Weibo from now on. How can I let you get all the attention?\u201d Fraud Tian grumbled.</p><br/><p>\u201cSure, I\u2019ll let you do what you want. I\u2019m heading out. Please look after the shop,\u201d Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cThe person who was spreading the false rumour deserves to be punished. I am going to find out who it is.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSigh, I pity this fella already,\u201d Fraud Tian replied.</p><br/><p>At the local police station.</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian was busy with his work. Suddenly, his office door was opened.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet me borrow your computer for a moment,\u201d Lin Fan immediately said as he entered the room.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe computer? What are you going to do this time?\u201d Liu Xiao Tian was afraid. He did not dare to let Master Lin touch his computer as he was worried that something could go wrong.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. \u201cDid you see Weibo? We haven\u2019t found the person who was spreading the false rumour. I am going to find out who it is. Don\u2019t worry. It\u2019s safe.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Liu Xiao Tian asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you have faith in me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian really had faith in Master Lin. After all, Master Lin was really someone with no problems.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan used the computer for a moment. \u201cAlright, we\u2019re going to arrest this fella soon for spreading false rumours. Let\u2019s see how I\u2019m going to do it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, he continued to rapidly click on buttons and typed away. Liu Xiao Tian was confused at what he was doing.</p><br/><p>Not again\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

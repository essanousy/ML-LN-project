They had thought that Brother Long was going to beat the person up. After all, beating someone up in broad daylight in the streets would definitely get him arrested.</p><br/><p>However, Brother Long said they were going to just pay him a visit and pretend like they were going for sightseeing.</p><br/><p>Soon, a large group of people gathered together.</p><br/><p>The subordinate said, \"Brother Long, everyone's here. Shall we go now?\"</p><br/><p>When Brother Long saw that there were so many people, he immediately kicked his subordinate. \"Are you asking for trouble? If the police see all of us, what are we going to do? I just need a few of you with me. The rest of you can stay put.\"</p><br/><p>They left in a van.</p><br/><p>In the van.</p><br/><p>Brother Long sneered, \"Nowadays, people like to ask for trouble. Previously, the Anti-gambling God from Jincheng came to Shanghai for a performance. In the end, what happened to him?\"</p><br/><p>The subordinate laughed, \"That fella came to our underground casino after his performance and lost everything he had.\"</p><br/><p>\"Yeah, it's that fella. Do you think he is crazy? He even claimed to be the Anti-gambling God. In the end, he had to leave after he lost to our tricks and skills. He even tried to cheat and didn't get to play anymore. What a loser,\" Brother Long said proudly.</p><br/><p>There were quite a number of anti-gambling people and they had seen a number of them. They looked like they were incredible but they still lost horribly in the end.</p><br/><p>A subordinate asked, \"Brother Long, what are we going to do there later? Do you think he's luring us there to an ambush?\"</p><br/><p>Brother Long patted him gently on the back of his head. \"That's smart of you, guessing what he's thinking. He probably thinks that we won't dare to look for him. But do you think we're cowards?\"</p><br/><p>His subordinates immediately shook their heads.</p><br/><p>\"How could that be? He must have belittled our Brother Long.\"</p><br/><p>\"Haha, when we reach later, he'll probably be scared to death.\"</p><br/><p>\"But Brother Long, what if he gave us a fake address?\"</p><br/><p>Suddenly, everyone became silent.</p><br/><p>Even Brother Long hadn't thought about that. Then, he looked at him. \"Can't you say something nicer? What do you mean by fake? So what if it's fake? I could just bring all of you out for a drive. Is there a problem?\"</p><br/><p>\"No, no problem at all.\"</p><br/><p>\"Brother Long is bringing us out for a drive and you still said that\u2026\"</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>During the renovation of their shop, Zhao Zhong Yang and the rest would go to his house to watch the broadcast and how awesome Lin Fan was. His gambling tricks and skills were flawless. Sometimes, they'd wonder why did Lin Fan even opened a shop when he could've just gone to Macau and win big money.</p><br/><p>Obviously, they didn't know Lin Fan's dreams.</p><br/><p>He just wanted to lead a happy life and unlock more tasks. He also wanted to make more friends in the process.</p><br/><p>As for money, he didn't care much about it. It wasn't very important to him at all.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan laughed, \"Let's eat at home today. I'll cook a sumptuous feast for all you.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan asked in shock, \"You know how to cook?\"</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan rolled her eyes at Lin Fan. \"When I was in Lianzhou, I cooked every day.\"</p><br/><p>\"Capable at work and in the kitchen. In the future, the husband of Wu You Lan must be a really lucky man,\" Zhao Zhong Yang said. Then, he looked at Lin Fan. \"Master Lin, hmm\u2026\"</p><br/><p>He knew how Wu You Lan felt towards Master Lin. He thought about it and felt that Master Lin was indeed a rare breed of man.</p><br/><p>If Lin Fan knew what Zhao Zhong Yang was thinking about him, he would definitely be scared to death. He wouldn't have expected him to rate him so highly.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian looked at Lin Fan closely and was wondering if he was even a man. Sometimes, he was so oblivious to such obvious things.</p><br/><p> *Ding ding!*</p><br/><p>\"Oh, it's the same person that called earlier,\" Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang was stunned. \"Could they really be here?\"</p><br/><p>\"Who knows?\" Lin Fan picked up the phone and was greeted by a sneer.</p><br/><p>\"Master Lin, quick, look below.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan stood on the balcony and looked downwards. He was stunned when he saw a group of people looking up. Then, they pointed at him, \"Brother Long, that fella is up there!\"</p><br/><p>Brother Long was ecstatic. \"Haha, Master Lin. You're so stupid to have revealed yourself so easily. Should we go up or do you want to come down? We can go to a hidden corner and talk about things. If we come up, you'd be embarrassed.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan hung up the phone and shouted at them, \"Hey, idiots, wait for me. Let me have my meal first.\"</p><br/><p>\"D*mn, Brother Long, he called us idiots. Let's kill him.\"</p><br/><p>\"F*ck, this guy must be asking for a beating. Could it be that he knows who we are already?\"</p><br/><p>\"What are we waiting for? We gotta go up there and teach him a lesson.\"</p><br/><p>\"Shut up,\" Brother Long waved his hand and sneered, \"This guy is smart. He's trying to lure us up and then call the police. We will be arrested for trespassing. Well played but he should've thought about who I am. After all, I'm a university graduate. Let's just wait here. I don't believe that he won't come down.\"</p><br/><p>The group of subordinates felt enlightened by Brother Long and they looked at him in awe.</p><br/><p>\"Brother Long, you're so awesome. We wouldn't have thought of that.\"</p><br/><p>\"If we charge up to him and he calls the police, we'd definitely have broken the law.\"</p><br/><p> \"That's right. Let's just wait here and see if he comes down.\"</p><br/><p>Brother Long nodded happily. Then, he looked at them seriously. \"All of you have to remember that studies are important. When you're faced with a situation like this, you mustn't be rash. You have to think of what to do.\"</p><br/><p>The subordinates felt that they had learned a lot from Brother Long.</p><br/><p>\"Do you know why the fund's manager, Xiao Jie, has an easier and higher paying job than you?\" Brother Long asked.</p><br/><p>The subordinates nodded and one of them said softly, \"Because he's a university graduate?\"</p><br/><p>Brother Long nodded. \"That's right. Our loans at the casino are counted daily, not monthly or yearly. They have to be adjusted accordingly. Can a bunch of primary school graduates like you understand that?\"</p><br/><p>They shook their heads. \"We wouldn't understand it. That sounds difficult. There are inflation and interest, that would probably kill us.\"</p><br/><p>Brother Long laughed, \"That's why you have to remember to use your brains more. Studies are extremely important. Xiao Jie didn't just know how to calculate it since young. We selected him because he's a university graduate. His degree certificate can't be matched by all of you.\"</p><br/><p>\"Brother Long, we know that now. We will read more in the future.\"</p><br/><p>\"No wonder Brother Long said that we have to progress with time. It's already the twenty-first century. There are so many loan software online. Aren't they the same as loan sharks like us? But they're smart to make the illegal seem legal.\"</p><br/><p>Brother Long nodded. \"That sounds pretty smart. Just read more in the future. We will not beat or disturb this fella. This will affect him psychologically and let him realize the impact of his broadcast.\"</p><br/><p>\"Understood.\"</p><br/><p>\"He is probably scared to death.\"</p><br/><p>\"Brother Long, he said he's going to have his meal. I'll keep a lookout here. You can go and eat first.\"</p><br/><p>Brother Long replied, \"Alright, stay here then. We'll have our meal first and we'll bring something nice for you.\"</p><br/><p>...</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Elder Dog was really too ferocious.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, aren\u2019t Elder Dog\u2019s bites quite severe?\u201d Liu Xiao Tian looked at the bloody scene and he didn\u2019t even dare to keep looking. He couldn\u2019t allow any lives to be lost. If lives were lost, it would be hard to explain.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded. \u201cDoggy, that\u2019s enough. Stop biting. How many times have I told you not to bite people as you like? If you bite someone with contaminated blood, what would you do?\u201d</p><br/><p>In Elder Dog\u2019s frenzy, it was as if he had been venting his anger. He was a majestic and dominant dog. For him to have smelled sh*t, it was a huge disgrace.</p><br/><p>Now that he had come across these people who had splashed the sh*t, of course he had to bite them.</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian looked at Elder Dog\u2019s ferocious appearance and mumbled in his heart. <em>Perhaps even those trained dogs from the military are nothing before Elder Dog.</em></p><br/><p>\u201cAh! Come quickly. This kid isn\u2019t looking too good.\u201d Fraud Tian\u2019s voice rang from inside the house. Fraud Tian used to be unmatched with his Ba Gua Zhang skills. He had grown old but his technique was still there. With his palm strike, he had struck these people until some of their teeth were missing. But when he saw a boy on the ground who was breathing weakly, he shouted in a panic.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan rushed in. When he saw the boy lying on the ground, he immediately started checking the boy without hesitation. He ripped open the boy\u2019s shirt but then, he realized that this boy had bruises all over. He had nearly been beaten to death.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan then looked over at those guys who had been beaten to the ground by Fraud Tian and was filled with rage.</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian rushed in as well. When he saw the boy\u2019s condition, he gasped. The boy had green and purple bruises all over and what was worse was that he even had scars from being burned by cigarette buds. With one look, he was astounded. The people who had done this were simply inhumane.</p><br/><p>\u201cBring them all back and notify the people at the station that everyone will have an overtime meeting tonight.\u201d Liu Xiao Tian was fuming. He hadn\u2019t thought that, amidst the peace and security that they safeguarded, such things were still happening. Regardless of what other people thought, he felt that it was a slap to his face.</p><br/><p>Moreover, Master Lin was right there with him. It made him feel completely ashamed.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, is the boy fine?\u201d asked Liu Xiao Tian.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan performed some emergency treatment. \u201cHe\u2019s fine. They were too brutal to him. Liu Xiao Tian, I feel that this will really depend on your investigations. This shanty town has bad people mixed in with the good. There are so many people who pass through this place, you guys probably don\u2019t know what kind of people stay here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian\u2019s face turned red as Lin Fan said that. He was very ashamed.</p><br/><p>But what Master Lin said was right. This was a shanty town and many people who came from other places to work stayed here. There were also some outlaws who would stay here, mainly because the law was not stable here.</p><br/><p>The landlords would just take a quick look at the tenants\u2019 IDs before letting them stay. As for how many people stayed in their properties in the end, no one cared.</p><br/><p>Some landlords purposely cared less just so they could quickly rent their properties out.</p><br/><p>Hence, Liu Xiao Tian was going to treat this matter seriously. He had already reached his current appointment. Even if he was under even more pressure, he had to resolve this.</p><br/><p>Cloud Street!</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan returned, the shop owners all surrounded him.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Boss, were the culprits caught?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you find them?\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian flicked his hand. \u201cThey were found. Those little b*stards are too unbridled. When I went in, I beat all those b*stards down with a series of palm strikes to let them know that they can\u2019t be too ruthless.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, Fraud is amazing. I couldn\u2019t tell,\u201d said Elder Liang with a gasp. He knew that Fraud was quite capable and possessed real kungfu.</p><br/><p>However, what shocked them was that Elder Dog was so powerful. He had been able to sniff out even that. It was simply scary.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the shop. Someone had called a water truck to clean up the shop. Moreover, there were even a lot of cleaners dressed in uniforms who were performing a big clean up with all sorts of equipment.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho called these people over?\u201d Lin Fan asked curiously. After all, they were very professional.</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang replied, \u201cOne of your fans. He runs a cleaning company in Shanghai. This water truck and the workers were all sent over by him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan gasped in his heart. Having fans was really great. His fans held all kinds of professions. Lin Fan\u2019s mood brightened up significantly.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere is he then? I have to thank him properly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang shook his head. \u201cHe didn\u2019t come. He only sent his people here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, they didn\u2019t say much else. It seemed that this fan was very low-key. However, Lin Fan couldn\u2019t let these people go through this trouble for nothing. Most people wouldn\u2019t have been able to do what those workers were doing.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan told Zhao Zhong Yang to prepare some red packets for the workers.</p><br/><p>However, the cleaners all didn\u2019t accept the red packets. After cleaning the shop until it was sparkling clean and odorless, they left the place.</p><br/><p>After the cleaning, the shop was even cleaner than before.</p><br/><p>Nighttime!</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian\u2019s side had begun strict interrogations on those men. Also, they had investigated the boy\u2019s identity. Luckily, they managed to find this boy\u2019s family. They had contacted the family. When they found out that the family stayed rather far away, Liu Xiao Tian sent someone to send the boy back by the high-speed rail.</p><br/><p>The conference hall.</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian sat on the platform as the other police officers sat below. All of them knew what had happened that day. As for what their Deputy Bureau Chief was going to say, they had a rough idea.</p><br/><p>With a gentle cough, he adjusted the position of the microphone. \u201cToday, I\u2019ve gathered everyone here not to talk about some ambitious ideal or some distant goal. I will keep it short and not waste time. CCTVs have been installed up until now and they densely cover all of Shanghai\u2019s streets, business districts, shopping malls, etc. According to logic, not many crimes should escape our CCTVs.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut after this incident, I realized that everyone has been too relaxed. When people call the police from crowded places like malls and train stations to report such incidents, how often are police officers dispatched?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve looked through the records regarding this. There have been quite a number of police reports. However, the frequency of police officers being dispatched is disappointing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Little voices started to discuss amongst themselves. They all felt that they had been wronged. They were helpless in these situations. There were some cases where real mothers and children would go and beg for money. There was no way they could capture these beggars.</p><br/><p>How were they supposed to differentiate the real ones from the fakes?</p><br/><p>*Bam!*</p><br/><p>The platform shook as Liu Xiao Tian slammed the table with his palm. The people below were startled and even a little fearful.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care how other places handle things. Those who are working on the networks and those on standby, stay at the station. The rest of you, go to every public area and patrol them. Check the IDs of any suspicious individuals. If I find anyone in the office drinking tea and reading the newspapers, I\u2019ll say it now, you will be fired.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd I will be patrolling the streets too. If I find anyone lazing around in shops, the consequence will be the same.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDismissed!\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian left.</p><br/><p>The people below exchanged looks with each other. They hadn\u2019t expected Deputy Chief Liu to explode into such a rage.</p></div>\n</div>"}

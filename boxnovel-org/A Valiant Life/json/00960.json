Don\u2019t worry, there won\u2019t be any problems. Let\u2019s keep eating.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ke Hao was in admiration of Master Lin\u2019s calmness. Then, he raised his wine glass. \u201cMaster Lin, I am very grateful.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan raised his glass as well and their glasses clinked against each other. \u201cDirector Wang is too courteous. This is something that nobody wants to happen. But when gambling is legal, anything can happen.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ke Hao laughed. This topic of conversation had gone a bit far but Master Lin\u2019s words did make sense.</p><br/><p>When gambling became legal in designated areas, this kind of situation was unavoidable.</p><br/><p>But Haojiang was already much safer now. In the past, money lenders would roam around the entire city. Every day, disasters would happen. Every day, people would die.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-2\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cSigh. In the end, the fault comes back to me. If I hadn\u2019t brought him to Haojiang in the past, he wouldn\u2019t have become contaminated by such things. These few years, I\u2019ve repaid many of his debts. But I never thought that he would actually borrow this much,\u201d said Wang Ke Hao regretfully.</p><br/><p>The interest rates over there were very high. It was a well-known fact. Everyone who borrowed money knew about this. At the same time, the money lenders wouldn\u2019t lend money to people who didn\u2019t have the means to return it.</p><br/><p>After all, they wanted to earn money too. If someone couldn\u2019t repay their debts, what was the point of lending money to that person?</p><br/><p>As for the past, people who couldn\u2019t return money would be killed. There had been a drastic change since those times. After all, what was the point of taking someone\u2019s life?</p><br/><p>However, for the money lender to be willing to lend money to his son, it was because Wang Ke Hao had shot many big films in recent years. He had earned quite a lot of money and as such, they had faith that he would be able to repay the debt.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at Wang Ke Hao\u2019s depressed expression and comforted him, \u201cDirector Wang, look at the bigger picture. It\u2019ll be fine as long as he turns over a new leaf. At least he isn\u2019t addicted to drugs.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ke Hao nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Meng Hua asked suspiciously, \u201cMaster Lin, this friend of yours is from Haojiang? This person has so much authority.\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-3\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled. \u201cShe\u2019s from Haojiang but it\u2019s not that she has great authority. It\u2019s just that, coincidentally, she\u2019s the one who manages this business.\u201d</p><br/><p>When he said this, Wang Ke Hao and the rest were stunned.</p><br/><p>They didn\u2019t have to ask anymore. They already had an idea of what was going on.</p><br/><p>Which clan owned the Wynn Casino business in Haojiang? Besides the Yun Family, who else could it be?</p><br/><p>That old man from the Yun Family was a legendary character in Haojiang. He was someone that one definitely shouldn\u2019t offend.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, let\u2019s eat. But Director Wang, you still have to pay the money that was borrowed,\u201d Lin Fan urged. After all, this money had already been lost. There was a gap that had to be filled and since Yun Xue Yao would never ask Lin Fan to pay, she would have to absorb the damage otherwise.</p><br/><p>After all, although she managed this business, it wasn\u2019t hers. It belonged to the whole Yun Family.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. Don\u2019t worry. I know that,\u201d assured Wang Ke Hao.</p><br/><p>To Lin Fan, if he were to ask Yun Xue Yao for help and even have her pay the money on top of that, it was unreasonable. Even though she wouldn\u2019t say a single thing about it, nor would she resent him at all, he just wasn\u2019t the type of person to do such a thing.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s eat, let\u2019s eat,\u201d said Lin Fan with a smile, \u201cWhat were we talking about before?\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-4\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Wang Ke Hao didn\u2019t think too much either. Although 43 million was a large sum, he did have enough to pay for it. To a famous director like him, it was quite easy to make this sum of money.</p><br/><p>At the same time, he felt that this trip to Shanghai had really been worth it. Getting to know someone like Master Lin would be a great help to him in the future.</p><br/><p>After the meal, naturally, they went to the karaoke. Liu Xu had made great arrangements for them. Although she would quarrel with Lin Fan, she would do what needed to be done perfectly.</p><br/><p>The next day!</p><br/><p>Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan lay on the chair, recalling the previous night\u2019s events. Besides himself and that Zhou Xia Jun, the rest had all gotten drunk. In the end, he had to get Liu Xu to call some employees over to send them back.</p><br/><p>*Ding ding*</p><br/><p>He answered the call.</p><br/><p>Wang Ke Hao: \u201cMaster Lin, sorry for the trouble last night. We drank too much and forgot about ourselves.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. \u201cNo problem. That\u2019s how it is when you drink. As long as we\u2019re all happy, it\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ke Hao: \u201cAbout last night\u2019s incident, I haven\u2019t thanked you properly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no hurry. You\u2019ll be in Shanghai for a period of time. We\u2019ll meet again when we have the chance. If you come across any problems, you can contact me. I\u2019d be happy to help.\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-5\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>They chatted a while more before hanging up.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian said in an envious tone, \u201cYou went to have fun again yesterday?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed. \u201cNot really. It\u2019s just that I had a few guests and they treated me to dinner.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThese guests are probably not average people,\u201d said Fraud Tian.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cYou could say that. They\u2019re from Hong Kong and they came here to look for me. I had to give them face, didn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, Zhao Zhong Yang came over with his phone. \u201cBrother Lin, look at the news on the Internet. They\u2019re all talking about you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was surprised. \u201cTalking about me? Why are they talking about me? I don\u2019t seem to have done anything recently.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, look at this,\u201d said Zhao Zhong Yang.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan took a look. It turned out that it was a Weibo poll.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-6\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u2018Will the Nobel Prize in Medicine go to Master Lin this year?\u2019</p><br/><p>This topic had popped up all of a sudden. It seemed to have gone viral overnight. The number of people participating in the discussion had reached over 300,000.</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang said, \u201cIn the past, netizens didn\u2019t pay attention to these things. I didn\u2019t think that there would be so many people talking about it this year.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan smiled. \u201cI think it\u2019s because Brother Lin developed the leukemia prescription. Just this incident has already drawn many people\u2019s attention, so they created this poll.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang said, \u201cIt seems that none of our own people have even been awarded this prize before. Even if it has happened before, it probably happened a very long time ago.\u201d</p><br/><p>He looked at the discussion on Weibo.</p><br/><p>Most people were supporting him.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf Master Lin doesn\u2019t win the Nobel Prize in Medicine this time, it would really be unfair.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. Let me break it down. Master Lin has conquered anorexia, leukemia and infantile spasms. Especially with the first two diseases, Master Lin has saved countless lives. I dare to bet that this year\u2019s Nobel Prize in Medicine will definitely go to Master Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn the past, I cared most about the Physics prize but now, I care more about the Medicine prize because this is the category that benefits people the most.\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-7\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. Health is the most important. Without health, everything else doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI feel that Master Lin\u2019s chances of winning the prize are small because Chinese medicine isn\u2019t recognized internationally. I\u2019m afraid he might not even be nominated.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s rubbish. I hate to hear things from people like you. It\u2019s as I said. This year\u2019s prize will definitely go to Master Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. If Master Lin doesn\u2019t win it this year, it just proves that this award is biased towards foreigners and it has nothing to do with us.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at this comments and was momentarily stunned. He hadn\u2019t considered this before. He hadn\u2019t expected netizens to initiate a discussion about this.</p><br/><p>This prize\u2026 Of course, anyone would want it. But he wasn\u2019t so desperate for it. If it were awarded to him, he would take it. If not, it didn\u2019t matter.</p></div>\n</div>"}

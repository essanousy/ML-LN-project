Can anyone sell a box to me? Even 5 doses are enough.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRequesting medicine. Requesting medicine. Requesting medicine.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere on Earth has the medicine gone? The price on the black market is really too high.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYesterday, I bought the medicine for 2500. It\u2019s really too expensive. I can\u2019t afford it.\u201d</p><br/><p>In the group, many parents were complaining. Amongst them, many of them came from average families. The boxes of medicine cost several thousand each and they really couldn\u2019t afford it. But even so, they still had to buy it. Besides the black market, no other place sold it.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-2\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Li Xiu said, \u201cDon\u2019t be anxious. I have a huge piece of news to announce.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSister Li, what happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCould it be that you\u2019ve found a new supply of the medicine? I\u2019m very short on the medicine right now. My child\u2019s condition seems to be getting worse and worse.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xiu looked at the chat history in the group and, in her heart, she felt that those black market distributors were too despicable. They had completely monopolized a lifesaving medicine. They were selling a low-cost medicine for an insane price.</p><br/><p>Didn\u2019t they have any virtues?</p><br/><p>But to most distributors, as long as they could earn money, they could care less about anything else. Even if there were people\u2019s lives on the line, it didn\u2019t concern them.</p><br/><p>Li Xing: \u201cI\u2019ve just received news that the Chinese doctor, Master Lin, is currently trying to tackle infantile spasms. If you haven\u2019t managed to purchase the medicine, don\u2019t worry. There will soon be a cure.\u201d</p><br/><p>When the group members saw this, they instantly lost their minds.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-3\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>But some of them didn\u2019t use Weibo and they had no idea who Master Lin was.</p><br/><p>\u201cSister Li, is this for real?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, isn\u2019t Chinese medicine unreliable? How could he tackle this illness?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet me explain to everyone. This Master Lin is amazing. He is great at both Chinese and Western medicine. He was the one who conquered leukemia. Hence, I believe that infantile spasms will not be a problem for him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been overwrought because of my child\u2019s condition recently. I haven\u2019t even been looking at Weibo. I didn\u2019t expect that so many things have happened. I support Master Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf Master Lin develops the prescription, those black market distributors will be crying.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sister Li: \u201cThat\u2019s why, even if you didn\u2019t manage to buy the medicine, there\u2019s no need to worry. I believe that the prescription will be developed very soon. Pay attention to this group. I will be following the matter and if there\u2019s anything, I\u2019ll update this group immediately.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you for the trouble, Sister Li.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you, Sister Li.\u201d</p><br/><p>The group members were really too grateful towards Sister Li. After all, she was helping them so selflessly.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-4\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>They worked all the way until nighttime.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing sat down as he was deep in thought. His mind was filled with thoughts about the compatibility of different medicinal ingredients. To him, this domain was still rather foreign. He had to familiarize himself with it more.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Lin Fan sat there leisurely, thinking about the compatibility of different medicinal ingredients as well.</p><br/><p>If he were to just come up with a formula to replace ACTH, that would be too simple. However, he wanted to conquer infantile spasms. It was a prescription aimed at infants, hence, he had to consider it carefully. After all, this was not a game.</p><br/><p>However, the difficulty was still very low. It wasn\u2019t high at all.</p><br/><p>But up until now, he had only been contemplating the feasibility of the prescription as well as the after effects that it might bring.</p><br/><p>\u201cMing Qing, don\u2019t be impatient. Go back and rest first and come back tomorrow,\u201d said Lin Fan. There was no hurry on this matter. They could come up with the prescription the next day. Otherwise, if they did it too quickly, it wouldn\u2019t be too good.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing couldn\u2019t quite bear to stop but since his teacher had spoken, he had no choice. He nodded. \u201cGot it, Teacher.\u201d</p><br/><p>On the whole way back, Zhao Ming Qing kept thinking about how the ingredients should be combined. Even after Lin Fan had stopped the car and dropped him off, he was still thinking.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan didn\u2019t even know what to say. This disciple of his had become obsessed.</p><br/><p>However, if even such a person couldn\u2019t become a legendary master of Chinese medicine, then probably no one would be able to succeed.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-5\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>As for himself, he could just become the mentor of a legendary master of Chinese medicine.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan wasn\u2019t concerned about such titles at all.</p><br/><p>Staying low-key was the best.</p><br/><p>The next day!</p><br/><p>In the research lab.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing was racking his brains, still thinking about the matter.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the time and felt that it was about time. \u201cMing Qing, I got it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Zhao Ming Qing was startled and he couldn\u2019t quite respond. \u201cTeacher, what did you get?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI got the prescription!\u201d said Lin Fan. To other people, this problem might be very difficult but to Lin Fan, it wasn\u2019t difficult at all. However, this disciple of his had racked his brains for so long. He clearly was still inexperienced in this domain. Lin Fan had to nurture him properly.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing\u2019s grave expression instantly brightened up as he exclaimed excitedly, \u201cTeacher, have you really succeeded?\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-6\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded very calmly. \u201cMmm. I\u2019ve been thinking for a whole day and might. I didn\u2019t even sleep last night. I just kept on thinking about this. Now, I\u2019ve finally figured it out. This really isn\u2019t something anyone can do. After this is over, I\u2019ll have to rest for a long time. Otherwise, those brain cells that I\u2019ve used up won\u2019t recover.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing didn\u2019t care about all this. What he really cared about was whether the prescription would work.</p><br/><p>Weibo.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen will Master Lin\u2019s prescription be out? I\u2019m getting anxious.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you anxious about? This kind of thing can\u2019t be accomplished without at least six or seven days.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. Master Lin is creating a miracle. And this miracle requires a certain amount of time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no hurry. Wait patiently. We\u2019ll leave some comments each day to motivate Master Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight now, the Internet is way too noisy. Everyone is guessing when Master Lin will be done.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThese dumba*ses. I guarantee that he won\u2019t be done even after he dies.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck off, you hater. I hope your whole family dies.\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-7\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cD*mn! Hurry up and look at Master Lin\u2019s Weibo. Motherf*cker. The prescription has been developed.\u201d</p><br/><p>In an instant, countless netizens rushed to Master Lin\u2019s Weibo.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, those distributors who had been paying attention to this matter saw the Weibo post and were dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s <em>been developed?</em></p><br/><p><em>How can that be? Is he trying to leave us with no way out?</em></p><br/><p>At that moment, in the distributors\u2019 WeChat group, someone started cursing.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck! I was just about to make a business deal worth tens of thousands. I didn\u2019t expect that guy to suddenly ask for a refund. What a f*cker. I\u2019ve already remembered him. Next time, even if he begs me, I won\u2019t sell my goods to him.\u201d</p><br/><p>But before his anger had dissipated, a reply in the group made him feel as if he had fallen into a pool of ice.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t be begging you. I\u2019m afraid it\u2019ll be us begging them. No one will buy our goods anymore. Master Lin has already developed the prescription and publicized it on the Internet.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xiu had been checking Master Lin\u2019s Weibo every once in a while. When she saw this post, she immediately sent a screenshot of it to the group along with some words.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe prescription is out. Go take a look quickly.\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-8\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cI wish Master Lin a life of peace.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt looks like Chinese medicine. I\u2019ll try it right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWill this prescription really work?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI trust Master Lin.\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

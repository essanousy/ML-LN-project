He didn't want to see anymore because he finally knew why Autumn Sword Fish Killer hadn't appeared for so long. It turned out that he was f*cking working out.</p><br/><p>As for going up to him and greeting him, saying, 'Hey Autumn Sword, I'm your Master Lin,' Lin Fan thought he might be killed right there if he did that. Hence, for his own safety, Lin Fan decided that it was better to stay away.</p><br/><p>In the gym.</p><br/><p>Autumn Sword Fish Killer knew there was a problem with his pants. Because his butt was too big, when he squatted, that black silk pants would burst open, exposing his butt completely. Still, he wasn't afraid. If it weren't for those judgmental and mocking eyes, he would never have achieved today's success.</p><br/><p>The treadmill.</p><br/><p>Everytime he ran on the treadmill, the gym owner would look over with a painful expression in his eyes. The other people working out would distance themselves far away as if afraid that he would destroy the treadmill.</p><br/><p>The gym staff brought a bottle of water over. \"Here\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"I didn't buy any water,\" said Autumn Sword Fish Killer suspiciously.</p><br/><p>The staff replied, \"Your friend told us to give this to you.\"</p><br/><p>\"Friend?\" Autumn Sword Fish Killer became even more suspicious. He didn't remember having any friend. But then, he decided to forget it. Maybe it was just someone who wanted to mock him. As for the bottle of water, it would be a waste not to drink it.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Tian Hong Commercial Street.</p><br/><p>\"Little Boss is here\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"What have you been up to lately, Little Boss? You haven't been around the whole time.\"</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan reached the Tian Hong Commercial Street, the shop owners came over to surround him. They were all thinking about the renovation. The current progress was pretty good.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. \"I've been doing live broadcasts. I don't have to worry when I have the others handling the renovation. How're things going with you all?\"</p><br/><p>Elder Zhang replied, \"Not bad at all. It's just that the shop I chose is a little too big but the construction team has sent quite a few workers to help me keep up with time. After the water and electricity have been settled, the tiling, woodwork and painting will begin.\"</p><br/><p>Elder Liang was full of hope for the future as he said, \"When we left Cloud Street, I was a little hesitant, but recently, I've done some research and found that the potential visitor flow for this place is pretty high. Once we start our businesses, we will surely attract lots of people.</p><br/><p>At that moment, a car approached from afar.</p><br/><p>Sister Hong got off the car and with a face full of smiles, she said, \"I have a piece of good news.\"</p><br/><p>\"What good news do you have, Sister Hong?\" asked Lin Fan with a smile. To continue being neighbors with these people was a good thing to him. After all, they had been together at Cloud Street for so long. Moreover, quite a number of events had happened among them. Needless to say, their relationship was solid.</p><br/><p>\"Master Lin, I'm afraid it's something you would never think of. I went to Cloud Street today to pack my things, so I said casually that we couldn't bear leaving behind the name 'Cloud Street'. Then, that Director Liu Guo Qiang from Xin Yu Corporation said that he was willing to give us that name so that in future, we can keep using the name 'Cloud Street'. At that moment, I thought that after being at Cloud Street for so many years, we really have developed a connection with the name, so on behalf of everyone, I agreed. I just went to the person in charge of Tian Hong Commercial Street to ask and he said as long as everyone else is fine, then we can use it.\" Sister Hong shared this news cheerily.</p><br/><p>Everyone was delighted.</p><br/><p>\"That's great! Then we can change this place's name to Cloud Street!\"</p><br/><p>\"Even though the place has changed, as long as the name doesn't change, it would still be great.\"</p><br/><p>\"Looks like even Xin Yu Corporation know themselves that they were at fault. This must be a compensation.\"</p><br/><p>\"We'll still be Cloud Street from now on. Nothing has changed!\"</p><br/><p>Even Lin Fan hadn't expected this to happen, for Xin Yu Corporation to bear to give them the name. The popularity of the street was a factor and even the street name had some business value in it. For them to just give it to them like that, perhaps it really was a form of compensation.</p><br/><p>Cloud Street!</p><br/><p>These two words sounded much better than Tian Hong Commercial Street.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was elated. \"Since it's like this, then let's find someone to help change this street name for us. Someone will make the payment first and when we're all gathered, we'll split the cost among all of us. What do you all think?\"</p><br/><p>\"That's not a problem at all.\"</p><br/><p>\"You don't need to pay! Let us settle it!\"</p><br/><p>\"Yeah! You've helped us so much and we've yet to thank you properly. How much could changing a name cost?\"</p><br/><p>\"When Xin Yu Corporation raised the rent, if you hadn't taken charge, I'm afraid all of us would have split up, with some staying and some leaving. We would never have been able to find such a good place like this.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved his hand. \"Don't. This money must be split equally. No one is an exception, okay?\"</p><br/><p>The crowd looked at each other, then smiled. \"Alright, we'll listen to Little Boss. We'll keep working hard from now on!\"</p><br/><p>\"Right, we will work together from now on. If anyone faces a problem, then it's everyone's problem. As long as we're together, nothing will stand in our way.\"</p><br/><p>\"Haha, after running a shop for so long, I'm lucky to have met you all.\"</p><br/><p>\"No, no, you should say that you're lucky to have met Little Boss. He's the reason why we've all banded together. And our relationship is only getting better and better.\"</p><br/><p>\"Before Little Boss came, we would have our occasional little conflicts. Now, things are good. Whenever something comes up, everyone is willing to take a step back. I've run my shop for decades but I've never come across neighbors like you.\"</p><br/><p>\"Haha\u2026\"</p><br/><p>At that moment, everyone was laughing happily. They were in a very good mood. Lin Fan stood at the side, laughing as well. This kind of life was the most pleasant.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan wondered how things would be after the renovations were done. But he knew that things would surely be even more lively than before.</p><br/><p>From that day on, this Tian Hong Commercial Street would be known as 'Cloud Street'.</p><br/><p>That itself was something worth celebrating.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan now had some reputation on Weibo. On top of that, he had quite a number of loyal customers from Cloud Street. Good news like that had to be shared.</p><br/><p>He posted an update on his Weibo.</p><br/><p>\"Tian Hong Commercial District has officially been renamed as 'Cloud Street'. And one more easter egg: Everyone, please watch Shanghai TV at 8 pm tomorrow evening\u2026\"</p><br/><p>He locked his phone.</p><br/><p>His heart was content.</p><br/><p>He would go on television for the first time the next evening. It really was a little nerve-wracking.</p><br/><p>After the Weibo post, his phone kept ringing.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang: \"What's the meaning of you Weibo? You're going on Shanghai TV tomorrow at eight?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed and said, \"What do you think? Am I awesome, or what? They invited me to be their guest. You have to catch it.\"</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang: \"Catch what? I'm going straight to the venue!\"</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>He hung up.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian called and said, \"You're going on television tomorrow? Can you bring me with you?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \"What would you want to go for? They didn't ask for you.\"</p><br/><p>Fraud tian said, \"Don't be like that. It's no big deal, it would be good if you could just bring me to see more of the world.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled, \"Hehe\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"Don't hehe! Give me an answer. I'll hold your bag for you. Those people who go on television always have a follower to carry their bags. Don't look at me like that. I'm very skilled in this regard.\"</p><br/><p>The calls came one after another. Everyone that he was familiar with called to ask about him.</p><br/><p>He had put it so mysteriously that it made everyone curious.</p><br/><p>...</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Although the \u2018Silent Priest\u2019 couldn\u2019t say anything, his smile suggested that he knew that Lin Fan was just trying to brag about his abilities.</p><br/><p>He really felt like collapsing.</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t win Lin Fan in Weiqi and he had admitted defeat for that. He had tried to avoid him after that. After all, they were well-respected individuals and he cared about his image.</p><br/><p>However, he had gotten completely thrashed in terms of swordsmanship skills as well.</p><br/><p>Could it be that the ancestral Lu Dong Bin had something against him and sent an expert to educate him?</p><br/><p>Just when the \u2018Silent Priest\u2019 was thinking of what to do, a young priest rushed over.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-2\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cMentor, there are a few people out there and one of them has a serious illness. They would like you to take a look at her,\u201d the young priest said.</p><br/><p>After the \u2018Silent Priest\u2019 heard that, he immediately nodded without any hesitation. He finally could leave the place. He was already really fearful of the man before him.</p><br/><p>It was too damaging.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan passed the long sword to a young priest and said, \u201cI will follow you to take a look.\u201d</p><br/><p>The \u2018Silent Priest\u2019 nodded. He felt that he could finally win Lin Fan in something. He was really confident in his medical skills. He had spent decades studying medicine and he was confident in treating people.</p><br/><p>In the temple.</p><br/><p>Mu Dao Xiong waited patiently. He didn\u2019t know what was going to happen.</p><br/><p>His daughter had become paralyzed and he was becoming anxious the more he thought about it.</p><br/><p>\u201cMentor.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMentor.\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-3\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>The young priests greeted respectfully after seeing that the \u2018Silent Priest\u2019 had arrived.</p><br/><p>Mu Dao Xiong nodded politely after seeing him. He could tell that this priest was an extraordinary man. He had a special aura and class that not many could have.</p><br/><p>\u201cHi, \u2018Silent Priest\u2019. I am from Sichuan. My daughter has contracted a serious disease. I would like you to take a look at her,\u201d Mu Dao Xiong pleaded.</p><br/><p>Mu Hui Min\u2019s mother was really emotional. She looked at him desperately. \u201cMentor, please save my daughter.\u201d She looked as if she was going to kneel down to beg him.</p><br/><p>However, she got stopped by the \u2018Silent Priest\u2019. Then, he nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cDirector Mu, the \u2018Silent Priest\u2019 will definitely be able to help you,\u201d the high-ranking officer said. Everyone was pinning their hopes on the \u2018Silent Priest\u2019.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan stood among the young priests and didn\u2019t really attract any attention. He looked at the young lady and shook his head.</p><br/><p>It must have been painful.</p><br/><p>She was a really beautiful lady and it was a pity for her to have contracted such an illness.</p><br/><p>However, he could tell that Mu Dao Xiong and the others were wealthy people. He hadn\u2019t expected them to come to the mountains to treat their daughter\u2019s illness. It seemed like they had been forced to do so since there was nothing else they could do about it.</p><br/><p>Then, the \u2018Silent Priest\u2019 looked at her closely. He held Mu Hui Min\u2019s wrist and took her pulse.</p><br/><p>He furrowed his brows and let go of her wrist.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-4\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Mu Dao Xiong and the others became really anxious after seeing that.</p><br/><p>Time passed quickly.</p><br/><p>It was a form of suffering for the family members of the lady.</p><br/><p>The \u2018Silent Priest\u2019 was also feeling pretty anxious. It was a bizarre disease. However, he didn\u2019t give up. He wanted to win Lin Fan in something to show that he had superior medical skills.</p><br/><p>He wasn\u2019t being competitive. He just wanted Lin Fan to know that he knew a lot of things as the \u2018Silent Priest\u2019 and some things couldn\u2019t be understood by Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>However, he couldn\u2019t think of a feasible treatment plan. In the end, he let go of her arm and returned to the front of the desk.</p><br/><p>Mu Dao Xiong wanted to ask him how the assessment was but he resisted the urge to do so.</p><br/><p>The \u2018Silent Priest\u2019 took a brush and started to write on a blank piece of paper. Then, he passed the paper to her family members.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is a bizarre disease, I can\u2019t do anything about it as of now.\u201d</p><br/><p>The \u2018Silent Priest\u2019 didn\u2019t want to lie about being able to treat her illness.</p><br/><p>Mu Dao Xiong sighed in disappointment after seeing those words. He said, \u201cThank you so much. I am sorry to have disturbed you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy daughter\u2026\u201d Mu Hui Min\u2019s mother started to sob uncontrollably.</p><br/><p>The other young priests hadn\u2019t expected the disease to be incurable by their mentor.</p><br/><p>They believed that their mentor could treat all diseases besides terminal illnesses.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-5\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>The high-ranking officer also sighed. He couldn\u2019t believe that the legendary \u2018Silent Priest\u2019 was also unable to treat her. <em>It looks like the lady is\u2026 Perhaps the one in Shanghai can help to treat her instead. </em>He wanted to tell Director Mu about it afterward.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan stood there and was stunned when he saw that the Taoist priest couldn\u2019t do anything about it.</p><br/><p>It was a perfect opportunity to exchange medical knowledge.</p><br/><p>It looked like another opportunity to shine.</p><br/><p>However, he didn\u2019t want to act superior. He wanted to discuss it with the priests as he felt that it would be the best way to create better relationships.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy friend, please wait.\u201d Lin Fan walked out of the crowd.</p><br/><p>The \u2018Silent Priest\u2019 was stunned after hearing that. He had a bad feeling about it.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy friend, I think this disease is still curable. Look at this lady\u2019s face. Even though it is quite pale, there is still a hint of red. It shows that she doesn\u2019t really have an illness. Her mental condition is probably because of some damage to her brain\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan started to analyze her condition.</p><br/><p>The \u2018Silent Priest\u2019 listened attentively. He felt that the youngster was making logical statements. He hadn\u2019t thought about it so specifically before.</p><br/><p>After hearing that, he felt as if he had gotten enlightened. However, he didn\u2019t manage to think of a treatment plan.</p><br/><p>Mu Dao Xiong looked at this youngster and asked curiously, \u201cYou are\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>The high-ranking officer stared intently at Lin Fan and interrupted him, \u201cAre you Master Lin from Cloud Street?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, you recognize me?\u201d Lin Fan hadn\u2019t expected someone to recognize him.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. Why wouldn\u2019t I recognize you? I have seen your Weibo!\u201d The high-ranking officer was really excited. Then, he said, \u201cDirector Mu, this is Master Lin. The godly doctor from Cloud Street. He is really powerful. Initially, I was thinking that if her condition cannot be treated here, we can go to Shanghai. I didn\u2019t expect Godly Doctor Lin to be here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mu Dao Xiong didn\u2019t know who Master Lin was. However, when he heard the term \u2018Godly Doctor\u2019, he became really curious. <em>This Lin Fan looks really young, how can he be called a Godly Doctor?</em></p><br/><p><em>That\u2019s impossible.</em></p><br/><p>He was pretty disappointed with the high-ranking official of his company. He wanted to lecture him but those bodyguards that were following him also gasped in shock.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, Master Lin of Shanghai. Oh my God, I finally see you in person.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDirector Mu, Master Lin is godly. His medical skills are amazing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, Master Lin guided his disciple to come up with the prescription for anorexia. With Master Lin, your daughter\u2019s illness will definitely be cured.\u201d</p><br/><p>After hearing his workers praise the youngster before him, Mu Dao Xiong didn\u2019t understand what was going on.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan hadn\u2019t expected his skills to be so incredible that people all over the nation knew about him.</p><br/><p>He felt pretty helpless. Being too famous wasn\u2019t good after all.</p></div>\n</div>"}

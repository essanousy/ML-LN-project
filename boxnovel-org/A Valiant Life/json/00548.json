After the journalists watched the video, they were astonished. They never imagined that those Senior Professors would be that shameless.</p><br/><p>They dared to say something that arrogant and shameless. It was an outrage!</p><br/><p>\u201cYou guys take a look. All these Senior Professors don\u2019t give a crap about the law. At first, I didn\u2019t want to make this video public and I actually wanted to give them a chance to apologize for what they did. I never thought that all these Senior Professors would distort the truth and gang up to attack me. I\u2026 won\u2019t say any more. The more I say, the more depressed I get. All these Senior Professors are despicable. Countless students are looking forward to studying medicine while these people are just using it as the cornerstone for promoting themselves,\u201d Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy fellow journalists, don\u2019t you guys think that this is an injustice?\u201d Lin Fan grabbed one of the journalists, shaking them as he said.</p><br/><p>The journalists stood there stunned, his expression changing. \u201cReally despicable, really despicable.\u201d</p><br/><p>All the other journalists nodded their heads in agreement.</p><br/><p>\u201cI never imagined the truth to be this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBlame us for believing all these Senior Professors. I never thought that all they cared about was their reputation and would go to all these underhand methods to get ahead. Master Lin has contributed greatly to the Chinese Medicine field and yet your efforts have been taken by all these Senior Professors.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe definitely must expose these people.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. Only by exposing them will people realize and pay attention to this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian shook his head and sighed, his heart heavy. \u201cTake a look at Master Lin. Doesn\u2019t he look like he lost a lot of weight? All those months neglecting himself in order to finish those three books. I sometimes remind him to take it easy on himself, and you know what he tells me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCan you elaborate on that?\u201d the journalists turned their gaze towards Fraud Tian.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian said with esteem, \u201cHe said that these educational materials would benefit the new generation of talented Chinese Medicine Practitioners, and he couldn\u2019t afford to make a mistake and what he wrote had to be perfect. When he was writing those three books, he lost a lot of weight and sometimes, he almost looked like he was about to faint. We were really worried about him then.\u201d</p><br/><p>The shop owners who were standing around caught onto what Fraud Tian was doing and also started following suit.</p><br/><p>\u201cYea, we saw all of this with our own eyes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Boss is really too dedicated to his job. Sometimes, he doesn\u2019t sleep at night, saying that he cannot procrastinate, or else he might impede the learning of the future students. What do you guys think? Don\u2019t you think that what those Senior Professors did was a gross injustice? Did you guys know that they are posting false rumors about Little Boss online? Little Boss can\u2019t even lift up his head to face the world!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey used their seniority to bully him. That is just an abuse of power!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at everyone who was standing around, his mouth gaped open in shock. These guys were just too incredible to have been able to spin a story out like that.</p><br/><p>And Lin Fan joined in the fun. \u201cAlright, alright. You guys don\u2019t need to say anymore. This is my duty and now that this has happened, I just hope that I can get some justice for myself. I don\u2019t ask anything else. I just ask that the Senior Professors issue an apology.\u201d</p><br/><p>The journalists looked at Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, you\u2019re just too noble, and we respect you for that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, we will report the truth regarding this case. Could you send us the video?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin has sacrificed so much for society, holding a voluntary clinic to treat numerous patients, and now writing educational material for future students. If we don\u2019t help Master Lin to attain justice, I\u2019m afraid we can\u2019t call ourselves journalists.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, we all already know the truth about this case. Thinking about the despicable things that the Senior Professors did just makes me so mad.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI think sending the video to you guys won\u2019t be such a good idea. Those Senior Professors also contributed to society. We can\u2019t just discredit them for one mistake,\u201d Lin Fan said, his face looking embarrassed.</p><br/><p>The journalists looked at Lin Fan in awe.</p><br/><p>\u201cI never thought that Master Lin would still spare a thought for those Senior Professors after what they did to him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, please send us the video. If they issue an apology, we will not post the video.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. That\u2019s right, Master Lin. Maybe you can take this injustice, but we cannot just stand by and do nothing. You are one of the more famous and important people in Shanghai, and you always stand for justice. How can we just stand by and watch you get eaten up like that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan didn\u2019t reject the request of the journalists. Finally, he nodded his head. \u201cAlright, but you guys must promise me to keep this a secret. If the video gets leaked out, this would be a bad thing. I\u2019m worried that some of the Senior Professors might have a weak heart and probably can\u2019t take it since they aren\u2019t young at all.\u201d</p><br/><p>The journalists reassured Lin Fan. \u201cI never thought that you would still think about their wellbeing at this point in time. Don\u2019t you worry, Master Lin. We won\u2019t make the video public unless the Senior Professors refuse to issue an apology.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, that is great.\u201d Lin Fan was smiling, satisfied with how that turned out. Time to dance in joy!</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The journalists all left.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed out loud, as he continued to play with his phone. He didn\u2019t worry about the Senior Professors for bullying him anymore. He was just going to let the journalists do their job, and that was almost a guaranteed success.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian laughed. \u201cHow was I? Wasn\u2019t I amazing?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan gave him a thumbs up, grinning. \u201cAwesome!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s for certain. I\u2019m getting a little annoyed dealing with this, but those Senior Professors are really despicable. If you won\u2019t beat them up, what about let me do it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at Fraud Tian. \u201cForget it. If you start getting physical, I\u2019ll be the one seeing you in prison.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true. But going to prison for you? That is worth everything. I wouldn\u2019t do this even for a pretty lady and that\u2019s saying a lot.\u201d</p><br/><p>Just at this moment, a red sports car stopped outside the shop.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan stood there frozen in shock as he saw who it was coming outside the car. Was he dreaming? He rubbed his eyes, making sure he was seeing correctly.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn, what\u2019s this guy doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>All he saw was Brother Qiang Qiang wearing high-heeled shoes. She was originally tall, but with those shoes, she towered over everyone else. He walked over smiling, her face wearing light make up.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan smiled as she saw him walking over. \u201cLiu Xu, what brings you here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m here to bring you out and also at the same time, see the Godly Doctor,\u201d Liu Xu said, her face full of smiles.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian looked at Liu Xiao, her eyes scanning him curiously. She was becoming prettier, but she gave off a dominant vibe and that made people not want to go near her.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at Brother Qiang Qiang with strange eyes. What exactly provoked her? But it was a good thing- she looked more and more like a woman, but wait- she was a woman all along.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan smiled. \u201cBrother Lin, when you were in prison, she came over to our shop to look for you to treat her. Liu Xu is a good friend and I hope you treat her well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan couldn\u2019t figure out what Brother Qiang Qiang wanted, but he had a feeling that this lady had bad intentions.</p><br/><p>Liu Xu gave a smile. \u201cGodly Doctor, I\u2019ve got something to discuss with you. Can we go to the car?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Lin Fan said as he nodded. He wanted to find out what this person wanted.</p><br/><p>Inside the car!</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Qiang Qiang, what is the meaning of this?\u201d Lin Fan said directly.</p><br/><p>Brother Qiang Qiang chuckled. \u201cI\u2019m not called Brother Qiang Qiang anymore. Please call me Liu Xu. As for what I\u2019m here for, do you not know?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was feeling helpless. \u201cYou know what I was up to. I was in jail for a month, and I didn\u2019t have time to research your prescription. But give me another month and I\u2019ll complete that task.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Xu waved him away. \u201cThere\u2019s no need for that since I\u2019m feeling rather good. Right, You Lan is your employee right? I\u2019m thinking of bringing her away, and she can\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Lin Fan cut her off before she could finish what she wanted to say. Lin Fan looked at her strangely, \u201cCould it be that you still bear a grudge against me and you\u2019re here to steal my employee away? Didn\u2019t you say you were feeling fine and pretty now? Why are you still trying to compete against me? You should go back to Jiang Ning.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Xu chuckled. \u201cGodly Doctor Lin, I understand your situation. Your words are unreliable, and something is a little funny. You Lan is such a beautiful lady and you don\u2019t even like her. Could it be that you aren\u2019t straight?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat does me liking or disliking women have to do with you? What exactly do you want?\u201d Lin Fan said, starting to get a little annoyed. He couldn\u2019t read her mind and she was one nut case.</p><br/><p>Liu Xu smiled happily, seeing Lin Fan being all defensive and shriveled up. \u201cJust now you said I was pretty. How pretty do you think I am?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved her away. \u201cPlease, don\u2019t even think that. Why are you so narcissistic? I\u2019ll tell you, you\u2019re really ugly, so ugly that I feel like puking just seeing your face.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Xu was laughing on the inside, but she gave a straight face. \u201cTouch your conscience, does it hurt?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan thought for a while. \u201cNope, doesn\u2019t hurt at all. I take pride in telling the truth.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGet out!\u201d Liu Xu said.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha!\u201d Lin Fan immediately got down from the car and walked back to the shop.</p><br/><p>Liu Xu looked at Wu You Lan and called for her. \u201cYou Lan, could you come over for a while?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan couldn\u2019t let them leave like that, and so he called for Wu You Lan. \u201cYou Lan, I need to discuss something with you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan looked at Liu Xu and nodded, before going up to Lin Fan. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, Brother Lin?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan pointed at Liu Xu. \u201cJust now, that person said she wanted to bring you to Jiang Ning.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh?\u201d Wu You Lan stood there stunned, before looking at Lin Fan, \u201cBrother Lin, what did you tell her?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow else could I answer? I said that you were my employee and so you should stay, and I couldn\u2019t bear to let you leave.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan blushed as she heard what Lin Fan said. She intertwined and played with her fingers, and she said meekly, \u201cBrother Lin, what you said was quite sudden, and I didn\u2019t prepare for this at all.\u201d Thereafter, she looked up, her voice serious. \u201cBut don\u2019t you worry, Brother Lin, I won\u2019t leave Cloud Street.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded his head reassuringly. \u201cMm, that\u2019s good. My care for you was not in vain. Could you go to tell her, and let her know?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Wu You Lan nodded, as she turned and moved towards the sports car.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at Liu Xu, his face pleased.</p><br/><p>Take away my employee? Keep on dreaming! It won\u2019t be that easy!</p><br/><p>Otherwise, what\u2019s the point of staying in Cloud Steet?</p><br/><p>Lin Fan didn\u2019t know what Wu You Lan told Liu Xu, but as she left, she pointed her middle finger at him.</p><br/><p>Facing that insulting situation, Lin Fan couldn\u2019t take it, immediately retorting, \u201cDamn smelly woman, if you don\u2019t leave, I\u2019ll make sure you see something good.\u201d</p><br/><p>Screeching tires.</p><br/><p>Liu Xu got down from her car, seating on the bonnet of the car. \u201cWhat\u2019s that? What\u2019s the nice thing you wanted to show me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan rolled his eyes. F*ck, this stupid woman wouldn\u2019t quit it.</p><br/><p>Liu Xu chuckled. \u201cGodly Doctor Lin, I have all the time in the world. Oh right, I was thinking of opening a shop and I see that Shanghai is a pretty good location to do so. Also, you don\u2019t have to rush the prescription, you can slowly do your research. If you can\u2019t finish in one month, one year would be fine. If one year isn\u2019t enough, ten years is fine too. I can wait.\u201d After saying that, Liu Xu got back into her car and drove off.</p><br/><p>F*ck!</p></div>\n</div>"}

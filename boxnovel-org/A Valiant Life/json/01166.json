What kind of problem did you see in this guy?\u201d</p><br/><p>She couldn\u2019t see any problem, and she didn\u2019t believe that Master Lin could really see something.</p><br/><p>Yun Xue Yao was very curious as well. However, she didn\u2019t ask anything. When Ma Shao Hao\u2019s father came, they would probably find out what exactly was going on.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, let go of me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ma Shao Hao struggled. Right now, he was completely dumbfounded. They weren\u2019t giving him any respect at all.</p><br/><p>If he had known that things would turn out like this, he wouldn\u2019t have stayed. It was simply asking for death. He was being held onto the ground.</p><br/><p>Initially, he had thought that Zhao Xuan was f*cking awesome. But now, it seemed that he had been mistaken.</p><br/><p><em>Awesome my a*s. He just got defeated like that. How shameful.</em></p><br/><p>As for those martial art experts, they didn\u2019t even dare to say a single word right now. They just stood there respectfully.</p><br/><p>Ma Shao Hao knew that this Master Lin was f*cking awesome. But right now, it seemed that he was too f*cking awesome. After all, this was Haojiang. It would have been understandable if they were in Shanghai, but now, he couldn\u2019t understand it.</p><br/><p>Zhao Xuan groaned in his heart. He felt that something wasn\u2019t right. This Master Lin\u2019s gaze was quite peculiar. It was as if Master Lin was looking through him. It made him feel very uncomfortable.</p><br/><p>The diners around them had run away long ago after seeing the situation. They didn\u2019t want any part of this. Sometimes, one would get unnecessarily dragged into a bad situation.</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang held his phone as he pointed the camera lens at those two guys.</p><br/><p>Ma Shao Hao said, \u201cWhat are you taking photos of?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang retorted, \u201cI\u2019m not taking photos. I\u2019m broadcasting. It\u2019s fine, show your face and say hi to my Internet buddies.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck. What are you doing? Stop broadcasting my face. Take his face instead.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ma Shao Hao didn\u2019t want to say anything anymore. <em>What the f*ck is up with today? I was slapped in the face by this guy, and I was even thrown to the ground by that old man. Now, this guy is broadcasting me.</em></p><br/><p><em>If someone I know sees this, it would be humiliating!</em></p><br/><p>In the broadcast room, the netizens started roaring with laughter.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha. I\u2019m dying of laughter. These guys tried to cause trouble for Master Lin, but now, they\u2019ve been done in by Master Lin. I wonder what the heck they\u2019re thinking right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat else could they be thinking about? They must be wanting to cry. These people basically dug their own graves.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLook at this guy. He\u2019s so miserable. I feel that he\u2019s probably the most unfortunate person in the world.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin is just bringing his staff to Haojiang for a vacation, but so many things actually happened. How peculiar is that? If I could be there, it would really be great.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI wonder what will happen once that Ma Shao Hao\u2019s father comes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is up with those big guys? Why did they turn on their boss?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThose guys are martial artists. Don\u2019t you know who Master Lin is? At Kunlun Mountain, he amazed the crowd and became the undisputed Chief of the martial arts circles. How could these guys not be afraid of him?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang went all out to broadcast the scene for his Internet buddies. Even though Ma Shao Hao tried to hide his face, Zhao Zhong Yang found different angles to capture his face.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Fraud Tian shook his head. These guys were simply finding trouble for themselves. They really didn\u2019t know what was good for themselves.</p><br/><p>Going against Lin Fan was really stupid. Didn\u2019t they know how many people had ended up tragically after going against Lin Fan?</p><br/><p>Soon after.</p><br/><p>\u201cXue Yao\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>A middle-aged man, who looked around fifty years of age, was stunned upon looking at this scene. And that young man who was being held against the table seemed like his son.</p><br/><p>\u201cUncle Ma.\u201d Yun Xue Yao stood up.</p><br/><p>Ma Guo Hui walked over hastily. When he saw Lin Fan, he immediately extended his hand. \u201cNice to meet you, Master Lin. I\u2019ve been looking forward to meeting you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan stood up as well. \u201cNice to meet you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan could tell that this Ma Guo Hui was insanely wealthy. Moreover, anyone who knew Yun Xue Yao was no ordinary person.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou rotten brat, are you causing trouble again? And you\u2019ve even caused trouble for Master Lin?\u201d Ma Guo Hui barked.</p><br/><p>He was one of the big shots in Haojiang. He had a good understanding of matters happening in the country. He was particularly aware of Master Lin. After all, he would frequently meet some big leaders, and those leaders would often talk about Master Lin.</p><br/><p>Also, he even knew that Master Lin had a good relationship with that elderly man in Beijing. That made him feel that Master Lin was no simple man.</p><br/><p>Hence, after hearing Yun Xue Yao\u2019s description of the situation over the phone, he definitely had to come down to take a look and see what was going on.</p><br/><p>\u201cDad, I didn\u2019t!\u201d Ma Shao Hao cried out miserably.</p><br/><p>He was very fearful of his father. He deeply resented what Yun Xue Yao had done. It was really despicable to call his old man over. He was completely at a loss.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph. I\u2019ll settle this matter with you when we go back,\u201d said Ma Guo Hui furiously.</p><br/><p>Then, that big man let go of Ma Shao Hao. Although no one was holding him now, Ma Shao Hao still didn\u2019t dare to move.</p><br/><p>Since his father was here now, there was nothing more he could say. He could only stay there obediently.</p><br/><p>Ma Guo Hui looked at Zhao Xuan who was being held there as well, and he wondered who this young man was.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan raised his hand. \u201cChief Ma, you have to be wary of this man. He has bad intentions being with your son. He might cause you trouble and even harm your son in the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Ma Shao Hao heard this, he interrupted, \u201cDon\u2019t try to trick others. He\u2019s my friend. You\u2019re being absurd!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ma Guo Hui was taken aback. Then, his brows furrowed. \u201cMaster Lin, could I trouble you to elaborate further?\u201d</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t quite understand clearly what Master Lin\u2019s words meant. However, he had a rough idea. This man was dangerous.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, when Zhao Xuan heard those words, his expression changed drastically. Then, he growled, \u201cLet go of me! I\u2019m Ma Shao Hao\u2019s friend, why would I harm him? Don\u2019t accuse me of that!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. \u201cYou\u2019re from Hong Kong and you came here to collaborate with Ma Shao Hao. After all, Ma Shao Hao\u2019s family background could be of great benefit to you. Moreover, Ma Shao Hao is quite stupid, and he could never outsmart you. He would definitely end up getting fooled by you. As for the full story, I think Chief Ma can investigate and find out for himself.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not f*cking stupid!\u201d Ma Shao Hao couldn\u2019t stand being called stupid.</p><br/><p>\u201cShut up.\u201d Ma Guo Hui glared at him. He took out his phone and took Zhao Xuan\u2019s identity card from his body. Then, he made a call.</p><br/><p>\u201cI want you to look into this person. I want all his information immediately.\u201d</p><br/><p>With his abilities, he could investigate someone with a single phone call.</p></div>\n</div>"}

Does he really think that he is some big shot, able to preach to whoever he pleases?\u201d</p><br/><p>In his eyes, he felt like a lot of people would agree with what he said. After all, the way that b*stard had spoken was very aggressive and the look he has shot them as he had been leaving was one that would piss off anyone.</p><br/><p>However, this time, he thought wrong.</p><br/><p>\u201cActually, what Master Lin says makes sense. I suddenly realized how heartless I was just now, to be laughing at this kind of situation. I think I should go and apologize to the little boy so that he won\u2019t take this incident to heart,\u201d a young man, whose face was filled with shame, said.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. Actually, this Master Lin is really someone to be admired. In the face of such a heated situation, even though no one dared to go in, he went in without a second thought and, in the end, managed to resolve the entire situation. He is really a capable person.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, some of them shot a glare at the man who was unhappy and said, \u201cPeople like you are really unacceptable. You have no idea of repentance.\u201d</p><br/><p>In the face of all this criticism, the man left the area with a gloomy look on his face. However, in his mind, he was still scolding that group of idiots, thinking that they were all bullies.</p><br/><p>Afterward, many of the people started surrounding the little boy and were sincerely apologizing to him.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan had just reached his car. He felt that he had been in complete control of the situation just now. Also, when he saw all the people apologizing to that kid, he felt a blissful feeling inside him.</p><br/><p>\u2018I am sorry\u2019. These three words might have been very simple but in the mind of the little boy, it had an impact that none of them would have expected.</p><br/><p>It was a way of fostering and developing values in the boy, something that a large heap of teachings would not have been able to do.</p><br/><p>The next day!</p><br/><p>Zhongzhou.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan had reached his hometown.</p><br/><p>He rang the doorbell.</p><br/><p>Mama Lin rushed to open the door. When she saw the person who was at the door, she was momentarily stunned as she said, \u201cSon, why didn\u2019t you tell us that you were coming back?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled, then walked into the house as he said, \u201cMom, it\u2019s not like I don\u2019t know how to get home. Why would I have to tell you guys?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s dad?\u201d he said. He had scanned the entire house but had yet to see a single sign of his father, which he found pretty weird.</p><br/><p>His mother laughed and said, \u201cYour father is pretty busy. The moment he realized that we are going to do something for his 50th birthday, he let his friends and some of his relatives know.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan sat on the sofa and then took out the gift he had prepared for his father and said, \u201cMum, come and take a look. Do you think dad will like this gift?\u201d</p><br/><p>His mother took a look at the exquisite looking case on the coffee table and was a little curious as she said, \u201cWhat did you buy for him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOnce you open it up, you\u2019ll know,\u201d Lin Fan smiled and said.</p><br/><p>After opening it up, his mother was stunned as she said, \u201cSon, you\u2026still remember what your father told you in the past?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed and replied, \u201cDefinitely. How could I possibly forget what he told me in the past? He said he wanted a gold chain bracelet right? So I bought one before I came back home.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, some noise came from the door.</p><br/><p>\u201cLooks like your dad is home.\u201d</p><br/><p>Papa Lin opened the door and the moment he saw the figure on the sofa, he smiled and said, \u201cSon, when did you get back home?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan mischievously laughed, \u201cDad, the moment I step into the house, you come home as well. Looks like it must be fated.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFate? What kind of fate are you talking about?\u201d his father suspiciously said. He did not know what his son had up his sleeve.</p><br/><p>His mother grabbed the box and felt a little jealous as she said, \u201cTake a look at this gift that your son has gotten for you. You\u2019re the first to get a gift, I haven\u2019t gotten any yet.\u201d</p><br/><p>When his father heard that there was a gift, he was momentarily shocked. He could not wait to grab the box as he said, \u201cWhat? My son got me a gift? I have to see what it is.\u201d</p><br/><p>When he opened the box, he saw the gold chain bracelet that was lying inside the box and was dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>It looked as if he had not expected it at all.</p><br/><p>He stood rooted to the spot for quite a while.</p><br/><p>His father had an indescribable feeling of happiness. He gave his nose a rub and said, \u201cSon, you still remember what I told you in the past, huh?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed and said, \u201cHow could I forget? Quick, see if it fits. If it doesn\u2019t fit, I can still bring it to the gold store nearby to exchange it.\u201d</p><br/><p>His father\u2019s face was filled with happiness. He put the chain bracelet around his hand and waved his hand around and said, \u201cLook, it\u2019s just right. It\u2019s not too big and not too small. My son really has a good foresight.\u201d</p><br/><p>His mother glared at him and said, \u201cSeeing how happy you are right now, are you going to show off again? Everyone in this entire village knows how capable you are and how good he is to you, buying this and buying that for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed. He was feeling pretty good inside as he said, \u201cDad, mum, I\u2019ll leave you guys alone to talk first. I\u2019m going to go and check out the hotel as well as see what kind of drinks to serve. As for the invitation list, I can\u2019t help you guys with that. You guys have to settle that yourselves.\u201d</p><br/><p>His mother replied, \u201cGo ahead. Your father and I have prepared an invitation list a long time ago. Once your father knew you were preparing a 50th birthday party for him, he has been rushing to get the invites done, even inviting his friends from other countries.\u201d</p><br/><p>His father said, \u201cYou just got home and you\u2019re going to go out again?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m going to give my friend a visit and see what he has to recommend. Okay, I\u2019m going to go first.\u201d</p><br/><p>After that, he left the house.</p><br/><p>He walked towards his car and headed towards Bai Ke\u2019s place.</p><br/><p>He was curious as to how his restaurant was doing.</p><br/><p>When he reached the area, he almost did not recognize it. The exterior of it had been completely renovated, making it completely different from last time.</p><br/><p>When he entered the shop, the staff members immediately walked up to him.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cBring your boss out now, I have things to settle with him.\u201d</p><br/><p>The staff members were stunned. They had not thought that anyone would come over here to trouble. Then, they immediately rushed to the back to find him.</p><br/><p>\u201cBoss, bad news. Someone is here to settle things with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Ke was busy in the kitchen. When he heard what his staff members said, he became very curious, wondering who has come over to find trouble.</p><br/><p>However, when he came out and saw the figure standing outside, his face was filled with ecstasy as he said, \u201cLin Fan\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled and said, \u201cDidn\u2019t expect me, did you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Ke stepped up and immediately gave Lin Fan a hug as he said, \u201cI didn\u2019t expect this, I truly didn\u2019t expect it. When did you get back? How come you didn\u2019t tell me you were coming back?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled and replied, \u201cI just got back. My father is turning 50 so I\u2019m looking for your help to find a hotel. Can you leave now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about? Can I leave now? Even if I couldn\u2019t leave, I\u2019d still leave for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow could you not have told me that Uncle is turning 50?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Ke immediately took his apron off and then called out to his staff members, \u201cPass on the news, you guys are all dismissed for the day.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, he wrapped his arm around Lin Fan\u2019s shoulders and said, \u201cCome, let\u2019s go and choose a hotel.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed as the two of them left the shop.</p></div>\n</div>"}

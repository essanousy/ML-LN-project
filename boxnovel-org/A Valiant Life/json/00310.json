Sun Lian Min had offended Master Lin but he was still Wu Yun Gang's friend. Wu Yun Gang couldn't just stand idly by and watch him die. He only hoped that Master Lin could offer a few words of advice to help him redeem himself.</p><br/><p>\"Master Lin\u2026\" Wu Yun Gang was about to explain the whole situation but Lin Fan raised his hand and interrupted him.</p><br/><p>\"I don't need to know about Sun Lian Min's situation. I know you want to help him but I'm not a god, nor do I have control over the universe. If he wants to offset his problematic situation, he will only have one chance,\" said Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Wu Yun Gang had a grave feeling. He said, \"You gave Sun Lian Min a heads up a long time ago. It's a shame he didn't think much of it. This time I'm here, it's because, as his friend, I can't just watch him die. He really regrets his actions.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved his hand. \"I don't care whether he's regretful or not but since Chief Wu came all the way to Shanghai, I can't make your trip a waste. I'll tell you one thing. Make whatever compensation that should be made and cooperate proactively. Don't think of taking the easy road. There's still a chance.\"</p><br/><p>\"Huh?\" Wu Yun Gang was stunned. He looked at Lin Fan and said, \"Master, if the compensation is made, then he will most likely go bankrupt.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled and shook his head. \"I've read his physiognomy. This is the only way that he can still stand a chance. As for what else he decides to do, that's up to him. You just have to tell him what I said. Whether he listens is up to him. And you shouldn't think too much about it. You've already done your part as a friend.\"</p><br/><p>Wu Yun Gang was silent for a while, then he nodded and said, \"I suppose that's all I can do. I never thought that he would be exposed like that. These are all his accumulated sins.\"</p><br/><p>\"Good and bad deeds will both receive repayment. The Gods work in a cycle. Just look around us and we'll see. Whoever the Gods have spared will still have to pay for their sins eventually.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \"Chief Wu, don't get yourself involved in this matter.\"</p><br/><p>\"Sigh, I know that but he's an old friend of mine and I can't just watch him die. I apologize for what he did last time and I hope Master won't hold a grudge.\" Wu Yun Gang had a solemn expression. Although the matter didn't involve him personally, Sun Lian Min was a brother to him no matter what kind of person he was. Wu Yun Gang knew that what Master Lin had said was right. Sun Lian Min behaved unscrupulously with his work partners but through all these years, perhaps the person that he had treated most sincerely was Wu Yun Gang himself.</p><br/><p>No matter how bad a person is, he would still have one or two people that he truly cares about.</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>After leaving Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>Wu Tian He made a call. \"Lian Min, I've asked on your behalf. Master said that you should make whatever compensation that is to be made and cooperate actively. Don't think of any crooked thoughts.\"</p><br/><p>Through the phone, Sun Lian Min was silent for a long while. Then, he said, \"Brother Wu, I...I can't.\"</p><br/><p>\"What are you saying? Lian Min, listen to me. Master won't lie to anyone. If you cooperate actively, you'll still have a chance,\" said Wu Tian He agitatedly. Even at this point, he had never thought that Sun Lian Min would still be so stubborn. The situation could no longer be resolved through debate.</p><br/><p>Countless evidence was right there. What else could he do?</p><br/><p>Sun Lian Min said, \"I absolutely cannot go bankrupt. They have evidence, right? I'll hire the best lawyer and win this lawsuit.\"</p><br/><p>Wu Tian He was lost for words. He really didn't know what else to say. Sun Lian Min really wasn't going to repent.</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled. This matter involving Sun Lian Min was pretty much settled. From his view, if Sun Lian Min listened to him, he might really stand a chance. If not, he would be done for.</p><br/><p>\"Master Lin\u2026\"</p><br/><p>At that moment, the reporter, Chu Yuan came into the shop.</p><br/><p>\"Reporter Chu, why are you free to come here today?\" said Lin Fan with a smile.</p><br/><p>Chu Yuan was very curious about Master Lin. Even the articles about Lin Fan on the internet were written by Chu Yuan.</p><br/><p>He placed several tickets on the table and said, \"Master Lin, these are tickets to the Shanghai World Championships. I'd like to invite everyone to go and watch.\"</p><br/><p>Chu Yuan had always been looking for an opportunity to interact with Master Lin. When he received these tickets, the first thing he thought of was Master Lin.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the tickets on the table and asked, \"What kind of competition is it?\"</p><br/><p>Chu Yuan said, \"It's an athletics competition. There'll be world champions from numerous countries coming to participate. It's very intense. I was thinking if Master Lin and the rest are interested, you can go and watch. Our country's sole world champion will be participating as well.\"</p><br/><p>\"Really?\" Lin Fan wasn't very interested but then he thought about the ability that he had gotten. Regarding the task, he had been helpless so far.</p><br/><p>If he could become an athlete, that would be great. Then, he would be able to complete the task.</p><br/><p>But how was that possible?</p><br/><p>The possibility of that was basically zero.</p><br/><p>Those athletes had all trained for years to eventually be chosen to compete. Countless people have gone to extremes just to become athletes. With his current situation, it was practically impossible for him to become an athlete.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian came over. He was very interested. \"I've never seen a competition like this in my whole life. Let's go and take a look.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was fine with anything. He asked, \"What about you guys?\"</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang was pretty interested as well. \"I want to go and watch too. After all, this is a championship. We have to go and cheer on our country's athletes.\"</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan didn't say anything. If they had time to spare, then it wouldn't be a bad thing.</p><br/><p>In the end, Lin Fan nodded and said, \"Alright then. Since everyone wants to go, we'll go take a look. We don't have much to do anyway.\"</p><br/><p>A smile appeared on Chu Yuan's face as he said, \"Master Lin, when the day comes, go a little earlier. I'm a reporter so I can bring you to the inner area to take a look.\"</p><br/><p>\"Alright.\" Lin Fan nodded. He decided not to reject the offer.</p><br/><p>After Chu Yuan left.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan opened his Weibo and sent out a post.</p><br/><p>\"Hehe, the day after tomorrow, I'll be going to watch the world championships. I'm looking forward very much to their performance.\"</p><br/><p>Very quickly, a group of people commented below.</p><br/><p>\"666...Master Lin, will you go and run one round too?\"</p><br/><p>\"I believe that if Master Lin participates, he would crush all these champions or whatever. He'll show them the power of Master Lin.\"</p><br/><p>\"Haha, I'm dying of laughter. You all really think that Master Lin is a god.\"</p><br/><p>\"I'm looking forward very much to this World Championship as well. World champions from many countries will be participating. It will be a clash of titans. I wonder what place our own country's world champion will take.\"</p><br/><p>\"This is a professional competition. How could he take the first place? That Jamaican competitor, Seidel, will definitely win.\"</p><br/><p>\"D*mn, if you hadn't said that, I would have forgotten. That guy isn't human. He keeps breaking records. It's simply terrifying.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at those comments and couldn't help but feel helpless. He really wanted to participate. Just by participating once, he would be able to complete the task. It was so simple.</p><br/><p>It was a shame that he couldn't.</p><br/><p>But just going there to satisfy his eyes wouldn't be a bad choice either.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

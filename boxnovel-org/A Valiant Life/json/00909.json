However, Lin Fan felt that it was really important. He cared a lot about the teachers that were going to be in the welfare institute.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t want the kids to be hurt again. Hence, he decided to handle things on his own.</p><br/><p>A few days ago, he had told Zhao Ming Qing to get all the shortlisted people to the welfare institute.</p><br/><p>In the morning.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-2\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Lin Fan stopped selling scallion pancakes for a day and the townsfolk were pretty helpless about it. They thought that Little Boss was skiving but they forgave him after finding out that it was for the welfare institute.</p><br/><p>They really respected people with hearts of gold. Hence, they understood his position.</p><br/><p>Jiang Hui just took the public bus as per normal. She was about to graduate from the teacher-training college. She had been looking for a job through the semester but it was difficult to find one as there were a lot of students in the college doing the same thing.</p><br/><p>The competition was stiff and it was extremely difficult to enter the school that they wanted to teach in.</p><br/><p>This time, when she found out that Nanshan Children\u2019s Welfare Institute was employing teachers, she immediately signed up.</p><br/><p>Because Master Lin was her idol. If she could work with her idol, it would be a dream come true.</p><br/><p>It was also meaningful to work in a welfare institute. Hence, she had applied immediately after finding out about it.</p><br/><p>On the way there, she tried to calm herself down to prepare for the interview.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-3\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Nanshan Children\u2019s Welfare Institute.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan dressed himself up and stood in a shaded area.</p><br/><p>\u201cUncle Lin, when will it start?\u201d Lil\u2019 Fatty asked curiously. He had been specially selected by Uncle Lin the previous day and it made him really happy because Uncle Lin had given him a special task to do.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait a minute. Don\u2019t be impatient. Do you remember what I told you yesterday?\u201d Lin Fan asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cI remember it. I have made the necessary preparations.\u201d Lil\u2019 Fatty nodded ecstatically. After Lin Fan had told him about it, he had worked really hard the last night and was really confident.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded. \u201cLil\u2019 Fatty, I believe in your professionalism.\u201d</p><br/><p>Just when that happened, a wave of people came in.</p><br/><p>\u201cLil\u2019 Fatty, go!\u201d Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>Lil\u2019 Fatty immediately ran out and cried. He cried really loudly and it attracted the attention of interviewees.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Lin Fan just hid and watched.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-4\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>He hadn\u2019t known how to test the morals of the teachers that applied for a job in the welfare institute. In the end, he had to resort to this.</p><br/><p>On the walls of the welfare institute, there was a camera silently recording everything.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Zhao Zhong Yang was watching the screen attentively and he was recording things down in his notebook.</p><br/><p>The applicants arrived at the entrance of the welfare institute and stopped to look at the helpless boy who was crying. However, some of them looked at the time and hesitated for a moment before entering the institute.</p><br/><p>Some of the applicants walked towards Lil\u2019 Fatty.</p><br/><p>One of the ladies with a ponytail squatted down and asked, \u201cLittle boy, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lil\u2019 Fatty cried, \u201cI was separated from my uncle\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you know your uncle\u2019s number?\u201d the lady asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo\u2026\u201d Lil\u2019 Fatty cried and his tears and mucus made it look real.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan watched from a distance and felt that Lil\u2019 Fatty should\u2019ve learned how to act and become a child celebrity. He might even be able to get an Oscar Award for that.</p><br/><p>Some other ladies came over and didn\u2019t know what to do.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat should we do?\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-5\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cYeah, how are we going to find his uncle?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe interview is about to start. If we don\u2019t go now, we\u2019ll be late. It\u2019ll affect their impression of us but this boy is lost. We can\u2019t just leave him like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>The lady in the ponytail said, \u201cYou can go for the interview first. I\u2019ll stay here first.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, how can we let you stay alone? We\u2019ll stay with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Lin Fan listened to their words and actions and nodded in satisfaction. Then, he took out his phone and sent a message. \u2018Inspector Liu, proceed, proceed\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian had been helplessly dragged into this by Lin Fan. He had to play along too. Then, he went towards Lil\u2019 Fatty.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Liu Xiao Tian was wearing a police uniform.</p><br/><p>\u201cHi, sir, this boy is lost. He can\u2019t find his uncle,\u201d the girls said.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, leave it to me. You can go ahead with what you have to do,\u201d Liu Xiao Tian said.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-6\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>The girls were cautious when they heard that. They pulled Lil\u2019 Fatty over. \u201cAre you really a policeman?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded as he was hiding. They were really cautious. If they had really handed the kid over to the policeman so easily, he would have been disappointed. Although they were really caring, they had to be cautious.</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian took out his police identification card. \u201cThis is my ID. You can check it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, the ladies left.</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian brought Lil\u2019 Fatty to Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, what are you doing? Will this work?\u201d Liu Xiao Tian asked helplessly.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy not? I have to handle this well. The welfare institute is a big thing. I can\u2019t just let others handle this. If I hire some bad eggs, I would be harming the kids,\u201d Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>Although the method wasn\u2019t the best, it was effective.</p><br/><p>\u201cAm I still needed here?\u201d Liu Xiao Tian asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. Please hold on.\u201d Only a handful of applicants had come and there were more to come.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-7\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian felt that he was going to be occupied with this for the whole day but he felt that it was meaningful.</p><br/><p>He cared a lot about Nanshan Children\u2019s Welfare Institute and he had ordered policemen to patrol the area. After all, there were a lot of kids in the area. Even though they had dealt against the human traffickers in the area, the traffickers couldn\u2019t be stopped so easily. The best they could do was to prevent it.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, get back in position. Prepare for the next scene.\u201d This time, it wasn\u2019t just Liu Xiao Tian involved. Many others were involved too.</p><br/><p>\u2026.</p><br/><p>Jiang Hui reached Cloud Street and gradually, there were other applicants that arrived too.</p><br/><p>The security guard at the entrance was Han Lu. He had discussed with Lin Fan to gather people at the entrance for registration. It was actually to increase the number of applicants in each wave.</p><br/><p>Just then, a screeching sound could be heard.</p><br/><p>The crowd turned their heads over.</p><br/><p>Lil\u2019 Fatty fell onto the ground in front of them.</p><br/><p>In front of Lil\u2019 Fatty was a car. The driver exited the car and looked really furious. \u201cYou brat, are you trying to kill yourself? Don\u2019t you know how to look at traffic?\u201d</p><br/><p>The man was Wang Ming Yang\u2019s chauffeur and he had also been called upon by Lin Fan.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-8\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>*Cries*</p><br/><p>Lil\u2019 Fatty cried without any hesitation.</p></div>\n</div>"}

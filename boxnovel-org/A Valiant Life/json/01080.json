He was completely dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>Tianshu Milk was a Japanese company. Each year, the taxes they paid were scarily high. Hence, the government valued them.</p><br/><p>Now, Brother Lin was directly talking about Tianshu Milk having a problem on Weibo. If it were to cause bad influence, Brother Lin wouldn\u2019t be able to escape a lawsuit.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was very calm. He believed in himself. His mouth was like that of a god. Moreover, since getting the Wuxia major class of knowledge, he had a perfect body. Whatever went into his body would dissolve into various nutrients.</p><br/><p>But after drinking this milk, he had realized that something wasn\u2019t right. Those toxins had tried to accumulate inside his body before bursting out when they reached a certain amount. Hence, he had immediately extinguished them mercilessly.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not attracting a huge problem. They\u2019ve already caused a huge problem. I\u2019m just giving everyone a heads up to be careful,\u201d said Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan\u2019s jaw dropped. \u201cBrother Lin, is that really the truth?\u201d</p><br/><p>In her view, if that wasn\u2019t true, things would get very complicated. Although Brother Lin\u2019s social standing was very high, this Tianshu was a huge corporation.</p><br/><p>Also, Brother Lin had an exceptionally large following. It could even be said to be frighteningly large. When he posted anything, the impact it created was huge. If it turns out that Brother Lin was mistaken, he would be guilty of spreading a false rumor and he would be sentenced. He would even have to compensate them.</p><br/><p>Elder Chen walked over from nearby. When he saw Fraud Tian\u2019s mouth covered in milk, he was very curious. \u201cWhat are you all doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Liang immediately pulled Elder Chen over. \u201cElder Chen, you came just in time. Look at what Little Boss posted on Weibo. If this doesn\u2019t turn out well, a huge problem will arise.\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Chen was confused and even a little dumbfounded. He felt that everyone looked as if they had come across something terrifying.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuge problem? What kind of problem could Master Lin face?\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Chen didn\u2019t say more before taking out his phone. \u201cLook. This is what Little Boss just posted. One can\u2019t be so reckless with something like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Chen looked at the phone. When he saw the post, he was completely stunned.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan: \u201cUrgent notice. Urgent notice. Tianshu Milk contains a 200% excess of aflatoxins. This is a potent carcinogen. For your own health, please don\u2019t buy it anymore. And spread the news quickly to let more people know about this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Boss, where did you get this information?\u201d Elder Chen asked with an astounded look on his face. He really didn\u2019t dare to believe this.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan pointed at his own mouth before taking another sip of the milk. \u201cI tasted it. There\u2019s definitely a problem. Trust me. I can\u2019t be wrong.\u201d</p><br/><p>*Pfft!*</p><br/><p>Elder Chen nearly puked blood. He was now completely dazed. Initially, he had thought that Little Boss would give some other reason. But hearing that, he really didn\u2019t believe it.</p><br/><p><em>Little Boss, what did you just say?</em></p><br/><p><em>D*mn. Even we have trouble believing it. How can other citizens believe it?</em></p><br/><p><em>How can someone taste something like that?</em></p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s bad. We\u2019re too late. Brother Lin, your post has been reposted several tens of thousands of times in just a short while. That\u2019s way too fast,\u201d Wu You Lan gasped as she looked at her phone.</p><br/><p>She was already frightened by Brother Lin\u2019s fans. Only several minutes had passed, ten minutes at most. But it had already been reposted several thousand times. How terrifying would it be in an hour or in a day?</p><br/><p>On the Internet.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn! Is what Master Lin said true?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah! I was just drinking Tianshu Milk when I saw this post. I was so scared that I immediately threw it away.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet me give everyone some information. Aflatoxins are classified by the World Health Organization as a Group 1 carcinogenic agent. It\u2019s 68 times more toxic than white arsenic, second only to botulinum toxin. It\u2019s the most toxic out of all known molds. Hence, to all my milk-drinking friends, please consider this properly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c^Don\u2019t f*cking scare us. I\u2019ve already thrown away all of the Tianshu Milk in my home.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, I want to ask how Master Lin knows about this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t he know? Master Lin is such a mighty being. Of course he would know. Anyway, I have unconditional trust in Master Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re really a fanboy. We have to think for ourselves. If Master Lin says this, he needs to at least give us some evidence. Who would believe him if he just says these things with no evidence?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. We do need evidence. Moreover, these things can\u2019t just be said. Tianshu is a large company. And Master Lin is a public figure with a huge influence too. If this turns out to be fake, he would have to bear legal responsibility.\u201d</p><br/><p>After Lin Fan posted it, it instantly caused a huge stir. After all, to the public, this matter was even more explosive and even scarier than past events. It simply made them terrified.</p><br/><p>They hadn\u2019t expected that Master Lin would make a move against Tianshu Milk. However, they didn\u2019t know what was behind this whole situation. There wasn\u2019t even any evidence, so it was very hard for them to be convinced.</p><br/><p>Feiyue Entertainment Company.</p><br/><p>Wang Mei Tian was recording. After finishing one song, she took down the equipment contently. She didn\u2019t even have to listen to it to know that she had done perfectly.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood. Very good.\u201d Outside, Chief Chen was clapping with a smile on his face. To him, this Wang Mei Tian was perfect. Regardless of whether it was at night or at work, she made him very satisfied.</p><br/><p>\u201cChief Chen, did I do okay?\u201d asked Wang Mei Tian with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t just do okay. I think you were perfect,\u201d said Chief Chen. Then, he patted Wang Mei Tian\u2019s shoulder. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to think about anything else. Just focus on recording the songs. Once the album is out, you\u2019ll be the most popular star.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing that, Wang Mei Tian let out a bright smile. She had waited for this moment for very long. However, she still had a ways to go before she would reach her final goal. Still, she believed that it wouldn\u2019t be too long before she would overtake Wu Huan Yue.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d At that moment, Chief Chen looked at his phone. When he saw the news, his brows furrowed before he let out a smile. \u201cThis Master Lin is asking for death.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Mei Tian was very curious as she didn\u2019t know what Chief Chen meant. \u201cWhat is it, Chief Chen?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Chen passed her the phone. He was smiling very delightedly. \u201cSee for yourself. If this doesn\u2019t turn out well for him, he\u2019ll be in huge trouble.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Mei Tian looked at the phone curiously. When she saw it, she was stunned. It was as if she had seen something unbelievable.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe actually dared to post something like that on the Internet? He mustn\u2019t want to live anymore.\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

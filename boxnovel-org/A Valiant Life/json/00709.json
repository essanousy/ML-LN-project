At first, they couldn\u2019t believe what they had heard, but after seeing the video, they all started going crazy.</p><br/><p>F*ck! The chances of this news occurring were almost impossible!</p><br/><p>Thereafter the people at the news agency started getting busy, getting ready for the big headlines the next day, ready to blow everyone\u2019s minds.</p><br/><p>The next day.</p><br/><p>A few citizens had woken up early. For most of them, the first thing in their morning routine was to check their phones for any news updates.</p><br/><p>After the people saw the news on their phones, they all spat out their food, thereafter looking at the video in unbelief.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn, first thing in the morning and I see this piece of sensational news. Are they trying to scare me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI was just eating my breakfast and just as I was drinking my soy milk, I saw this piece of news and I kind of spat out my drink on her face.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat the f*ck? Is this real? Could this be fake news?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFake my ass. There\u2019s even a video on it, and the person that slapped Ying Jing was Master Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin is also a little too rash, isn\u2019t he? He just hit Ying Jing like that, and Ying Jing is one of the bigshots in the music world.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI remember Ying Jing was like that last time and looking at her angry in the video, I can\u2019t help but laugh.\u201d</p><br/><p>At the train station.</p><br/><p>There was a large working crowd, and after reaching the train station, they took out their phones, taking a look at their phones.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, a wave of shocked voices resounded across the whole station.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn, Ying Jing got slapped.\u201d</p><br/><p>The people who heard the exclamations were all stunned, and although they didn\u2019t know each other, they all started talking with one another. \u201cThat can\u2019t be right, isn\u2019t Ying Jing some bigshot? Who dared to hit her?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTake a look for yourselves. It\u2019s all over the internet.\u201d</p><br/><p>Thereafter, the people took out their phones, immediately opening the news sites. They were all stunned after taking a look at the headlines.</p><br/><p>\u2018Superstar Ying Jing slapped in the middle of the street.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Singer Wu Huan Yue slaps music icon Ying Jing.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Master Lin in an all-out rampage to the woe of Ying Jing, teaching her a lesson on using her seniority.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Wu Huan Yue slapped, and boyfriend Master Lin takes revenge on Ying Jing.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Shock! A man slaps music icon Ying Jing on the streets.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The headlines attracted the attention of everyone as even more people went to look at the headlines, and they couldn\u2019t believe what they were seeing.</p><br/><p>Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>A group of reporters had been camping there. They wanted to interview Master Lin first thing in the morning and they wanted to know what had happened exactly.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan didn\u2019t even bother about what happened the day before, but as he reached his shop, he was surrounded by a group of reporters.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, can we ask for full details of what happened yesterday?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, did you think about what was going to happen after you hit Ying Jing yesterday?\u201d</p><br/><p>This piece of news was just too sensational and the reporters wanted every single detail of it.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian still didn\u2019t know what happened, but his curiosity was aroused after seeing so many reporters. He turned to Zhao Zhong Yang, \u201cWhat on earth happened? What did this guy get into again?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang had crazy respect for Lin Fan. If he could, he would have wanted Lin Fan to be his father.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t know? Brother Lin slapped Ying Jing in the face yesterday.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho is Ying Jing? Is she famous?\u201d Fraud Tian asked.</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang felt helpless, \u201cDamn, are you for real? Don\u2019t you know who Ying Jing is? She is the Big Sister of the music scene, and she\u2019s at the top.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian didn\u2019t have any interest in any of that, \u201cAh, she was hit by that little rascal, how professional is she. Anyway, let me get some airtime with the reporters. Who knows, maybe one of the pretty reporters will see me and it\u2019ll be love at first sight. That\u2019ll be great.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang was lost for words. After seeing the news in the morning, he was completely bewildered.</p><br/><p>He felt that this Brother Lin had broken all the laws of the universe.</p><br/><p>It was as if the apocalypse was about to happen.</p><br/><p>Was hitting Ying Jing worth it? This was a huge situation.</p><br/><p>Ying Jing\u2019s influence on the music circle was deep and wide. Now that she had been treated like that, she was about to exact her revenge.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan looked at Lin Fan. She never imagined such a huge situation would arise in just one night.</p><br/><p>She couldn\u2019t remain calm after seeing Brother Lin just sitting there as if nothing was happening.</p><br/><p>The surrounding shop owners all came over. They had seen the news and they didn\u2019t know what to make of it.</p><br/><p>Counting up to today, Lin Fan had already seen so many journalists at his doorstep. Sometimes they were a pain in the neck, but sometimes they were useful for some publicity, and Lin Fan was about to perform his art.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy fellow journalists, could I trouble you guys to keep silent for a while? I just want to say that I slapped Ying Jing last night, and as to how many times I slapped her, I lost count of it, but it probably was somewhere near the thirty range.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow did this thing happen in the first place you may ask? Ying Jing is one of the seniors in the industry and she thought she was the big sister to everyone. She slapped Wu Huan Yue who was innocent. As Wu Huan Yue\u2019s producer, I simply could not take this lying down. If I did, I can\u2019t call myself a man at all. And so, I went up to this heartless person a few slaps to knock some sense into her.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is what happened yesterday, so if you guys have nothing more, I have a business to run.\u201d</p><br/><p>The journalists were all shocked as they looked at Master Lin in a daze. How did he have the mood to run his business after all that happened?</p><br/><p>If this had happened to anyone else, they would have hidden in their own homes and wouldn\u2019t have wanted to come out.</p><br/><p>At this moment, a journalist shouted out, \u201cMaster Lin, did you think of what was going to happen after you slapped Ying Jing?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan pondered for a moment before chuckling, \u201cWhat happens after? I always think of the consequences before I do something, so it doesn\u2019t matter what, I just know I did factor in everything.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, aren\u2019t afraid of going to jail? Although slapping someone isn\u2019t such a big crime, if the victim decides to press charges, you may end up serving a sentence.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you think I\u2019m scared of going to prison?\u201d Lin Fan asked calmly.</p><br/><p>The journalists looked at Master Lin, not knowing what else to say.</p><br/><p>Definitely, Lin Fan didn\u2019t look like he was scared of doing time at all.</p><br/><p>And it wasn\u2019t his first time going to jail. Compared to a prison sentence, Ying Jing\u2019s loss was much greater.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, alright. If you have nothing else, please leave. I have a business to run,\u201d Lin Fan said</p><br/><p>He had already slapped Ying Jing, and it was too late to regret anything now anyway.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>In a high-class hotel.</p><br/><p>Ying Jing had lost her mind, destroying everything in her sight while her manager cowered in one corner.</p><br/><p>\u201cYing Jing, we have to sue him for this,\u201d the manager said.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, she saw Ying Jing\u2019s eyes which were full of rage, and they started trembling. What a scary sight.</p><br/><p>This problem had affected Ying Jing a lot, and she understood why. Apart from filing a police report, there was nothing much they could do.</p><br/><p>Just at this moment, she saw Ying Jing\u2019s face light up, her mouth curling at the ends, and she knew that something terrifying was coming.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

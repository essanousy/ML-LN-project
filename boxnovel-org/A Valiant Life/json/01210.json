Of course, he had not actually tried stalking anyone before, but at least he hadn\u2019t been discovered yet.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis situation seems a little complicated.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Lin Fan followed her, he started to ponder. He felt that this was quite complicated. Something was very off about this young lady.</p><br/><p>Very soon, they had reached a small alley. This was far away from the crowded area.</p><br/><p>On the way here, Li Xiao Xiao had stopped several times. Each time, she would take out her phone to take a look. Then, it seemed as if she was being persuaded, so she kept walking.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan didn\u2019t understand the full situation, but he just kept following her.</p><br/><p>Very soon, Lin Fan realized that his target had stopped. She had stopped at a very rugged-looking hotel, \u201cLove Ocean Hotel\u201d.</p><br/><p>Li Xiao Xiao stood there, not knowing what to do. Then, her phone rang and she answered.</p><br/><p>After speaking for a while, she hung up.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis little brat, what exactly is she doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was very suspicious. This was definitely not anything good. After all, they had come to this shabby place and she was just waiting here. There was definitely some kind of problem.</p><br/><p>At that moment, a figure appeared. This figure had a cap on and was wrapped up completely. It seemed as if this person was afraid to be seen.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Lin Fan saw that Li Xiao Xiao seemed a little resistant. However, that figure grabbed her arm and dragged her inside. There was no way this little brat had the strength to resist.</p><br/><p>Moreover, there weren\u2019t many people around, much less people who would come to help.</p><br/><p>Yang Dong was thrilled. When he saw the little girl, his latent energy started bursting out. Even his body was responding. In his mind, images that should not be described had started appearing.</p><br/><p>The more he thought about it, the more excited he became. He dragged her straight into the hotel.</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t take it anymore. No matter what, he had to get her inside. After all, he had already paid thousands.</p><br/><p>\u201cBe obedient, be obedient. Don\u2019t judge me because of my height. I\u2019m actually just in junior high. I\u2019m just a little older than you. Don\u2019t be afraid, the group matched us together.\u201d</p><br/><p>As the man spoke, he impatiently dragged the girl inside.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Lin Fan placed a hand on Yang Dong\u2019s shoulder.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d Yang Dong knew that he was doing something wrong, and he immediately tried to swat away the hand. However, how could he swat away Lin Fan\u2019s hand so easily?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you doing? Why are you dragging a little girl into a hotel?\u201d Lin Fan sized up the opposite party. Then, he took Yang Dong\u2019s cap off. When he saw Yang Dong\u2019s face, he realized he was a thirty or forty-something year old man. With his glasses on, he seemed a little more refined.</p><br/><p>When Li Xiao Xiao saw what was happening, she tried to run away. However, Lin Fan pulled her back.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go. Come here and listen to me.\u201d Lin Fan\u2019s voice seemed as if it was projected magically, startling Li Xiao Xiao. She stood on the spot and didn\u2019t move at all.</p><br/><p>Yang Dong had not expected something like this to happen. He wanted to escape. However, he couldn\u2019t run away. Instead, because he moved too suddenly, his bag fell onto the ground, and all the clothes inside were scattered on the ground.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked over and was taken aback. This is too f*cking devious.</p><br/><p>What are these clothes?</p><br/><p>Student\u2019s uniforms?</p><br/><p>Cat costumes?</p><br/><p>And stockings?</p><br/><p>Then, he looked at the opposition. \u201cWhat were you planning to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yang Dong was shocked. \u201cNothing. I\u2019m not doing anything. Let go of me. This has nothing to do with you! And who are you anyway? Why are you grabbing onto me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yang Dong struggled frantically. But suddenly, his pupils contracted as if he had seen a ghost.</p><br/><p>Even his voice started to tremble.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026 You\u2019re Master Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>He was about to lose his mind. The sweat on his forehead trickled down profusely. He had not expected to bump into Master Lin.</p><br/><p>This person would never let anything go. He was even harder to deal with than the police.</p><br/><p>\u201cYup, I am. Come, tell me. What were you planning to do? Who are these clothes for? You\u2019re pretty amazing. The punishment is at least three years of jail and a death penalty at worst, but you still dared to do it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan had not expected the situation to unfold like this. It was simply despicable. This person wouldn\u2019t even let a primary school student go.</p><br/><p>If Lin Fan had not gone to the shop to buy things, he might not have come across this. If that had happened, who knew how it would have turned out?</p><br/><p>Yang Dong\u2019s mind was in a mess. Even his tongue was tied. If he had come across some other meddlesome person, he would have ways to escape.</p><br/><p>However, the person in front of him was Master Lin. Even if he was immensely capable, he wouldn\u2019t be able to get away.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026 I\u2026 This is for myself. I like to wear clothes like these. It\u2019s a hobby of mine. That\u2019s why I brought them here.\u201d Yang Dong didn\u2019t even know what he was saying himself, but this was the only thing he could say in hopes of bluffing his way out.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s for yourself? Then what\u2019s with this girl? I saw you pulling her in just now? Why were you pulling her in?\u201d asked Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Yang Dong was terrified. \u201cI don\u2019t know her. I\u2026 I just wanted her to help me take a photo. There was no other intention, really. How could I do that sort of thing? This is a misunderstanding!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, so that\u2019s the case.\u201d Lin Fan nodded as if he had not expected that to be the case.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s exactly it. It definitely isn\u2019t what you thought. You have to believe me!\u201d Yang Dong said nervously. His fearful heart was thumping profusely. Even his legs had started to tremble. He was scared to death.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Lin Fan placed his palm heavily on Yang Dong\u2019s shoulder. \u201cDo you think I\u2019m an idiot?\u201d</p><br/><p>His gaze became serious.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go. This place isn\u2019t suitable for you. Follow me to the police station.\u201d Lin Fan grabbed Yang Dong and wanted to head to the police station.</p><br/><p><em>thud!</em></p><br/><p>Yang Dong immediately knelt onto the ground, hugging Lin Fan\u2019s legs. \u201cMaster Lin, I\u2019m begging you. Please don\u2019t take me to the police station! My mind was clouded by corruption. Give me a chance. I promise I won\u2019t do it again. Really, I wouldn\u2019t dare to! Please just let me go!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t spout nonsense. If I let you go, I would be causing harm to others. Follow me. If you continue to kneel, I\u2019ll see just how heavy you are.\u201d Lin Fan didn\u2019t say another word. He grabbed Yang Dong by the back of his collar and walked away.</p><br/><p>He had not thought that there would be such people in this world.</p><br/><p>Sometimes, people would look at some photos on the internet, but it was just out of boredom. He hadn\u2019t expected that such despicable people really existed.</p><br/><p>Moreover, this little girl didn\u2019t seem like the kind of child with a complicated family background and no one to watch over her.</p><br/><p>There was definitely some bigger problem behind this.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

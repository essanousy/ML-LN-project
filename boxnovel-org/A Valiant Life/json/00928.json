That opening speech earlier had been supposed to make them feel bored but unexpectedly, a great piece of news had emerged from it and they were all very excited.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-1\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Now that they saw Master Lin walking towards them, they quickly kept their things and ran over hurriedly.</p><br/><p>They naturally had many questions in their hearts and most of them were about what had just happened.</p><br/><p>After all, others may not have recognized that man from before but they recognized him. That Chen Shi was in charge of the Education Department but just now, Master Lin hadn\u2019t given him any face at all. Of course, it would be embarrassing for him.</p><br/><p>The reporters wondered if he would take revenge and make things hard for Master Lin.</p><br/><p>A reporter said, \u201cHello, Master Lin. May I know why you were against what Leader Chen Shi said previously? Is it because you don\u2019t trust them?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied with a smile, \u201cIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t trust them but I don\u2019t want to make things so troublesome. This is a welfare institute and all I want is to nurture the children. We don\u2019t need to follow the standard way or whatever. If I choose my own teachers, I don\u2019t have to worry.\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-2\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Another reporter asked, \u201cMaster Lin, do you have any other prospects for the welfare institute?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan thought for a moment before answering, \u201cMy prospect is naturally for the welfare institute to keep improving. I want to build a library and I also want to build an apartment building for the teachers. Of course, the latter will have a great cost. I\u2019m still quite poor and I need to earn money slowly. But there\u2019s no hurry. It will eventually be realized.\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporters were all stunned. They hadn\u2019t expected Master Lin to have such ideas. He actually wanted to build an apartment building for the teachers. This made them very envious.</p><br/><p>If other people said such a thing, they probably wouldn\u2019t believe it but they trusted Master Lin very much. After all, out of all the things he had said he would do in the past, there was practically none that he hadn\u2019t actually done.</p><br/><p>A reporter said, \u201cMaster Lin, according to what we know, there are now many collectors who are willing to fork out large sums to attain a piece of your artworks. If you lack money, you could sell a piece.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled. \u201cI haven\u2019t thought of that before. But if I draw too much, there would be too many of my artworks. Moreover, I haven\u2019t died yet. How much could my artworks cost?\u201d</p><br/><p>Of course, Lin Fan was just being humble.</p><br/><p>The number of his artworks that had been given out was not many. The museum only had ten, Elder Zheng and the rest had several pieces, and he had given his ex-teacher a piece. There were actually very few pieces.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-3\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>He knew that the price of his artworks had inflated greatly and there were indeed many collectors who wanted one. However, he wasn\u2019t very bothered by these things. Anyway, there were many ways to solve this problem of money. There was no need to go down this path.</p><br/><p>After all, his artworks were not so easily obtained.</p><br/><p>When the surrounding entrepreneurs heard this, all of them wanted to beg for one of his treasures but sadly, they couldn\u2019t open their mouths.</p><br/><p>Then, the reporters continued asking a few more questions.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved his hand. \u201cAlright, dear reporters, let\u2019s end the interview here. If there\u2019s anything else, we\u2019ll talk about it next time, okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>If someone else said these words, the reporters would curse frenziedly, \u2018As if there\u2019d be a next time!\u2019</p><br/><p>But since it was Master Lin who said it, they believed him, because Master Lin was someone who people would never stop worrying about.</p><br/><p>The news that erupted around him was always ridiculous. If he went one week without appearing on the news, they would become suspicious. Would that even be the same Master Lin that they knew?</p><br/><p>Education department!</p><br/><p>\u201cImpudent! Just impudent!\u201d Chen Shi started raging upon his return. His secretary stood at the side, not daring to say a single word. He could only listen quietly.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-4\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>The secretary resented Master Lin now. <em>Things were perfectly fine, why did you have to agitate our leader?</em></p><br/><p>Now, they were out of luck. The leader\u2019s rage would definitely be taken out on them.</p><br/><p>But honestly, this Master Lin was really quite f*cked up. Anyone without a social problem would have known what to do.</p><br/><p>He could have kept quiet during the leader\u2019s speech and waited until it was over to discuss it. How could he just reject on the spot and not give the leader any face at all?</p><br/><p>\u201cGo, help me to gather the information. We\u2019ll have a meeting tomorrow,\u201d said Chen Shi.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d The secretary nodded. He didn\u2019t dare to show any hesitation at all. Since the leader had said so, he had to go to the reporters at once and gather the information they needed.</p><br/><p>The opening ceremony at the welfare institute ended. Those thirty teachers were all very excited.</p><br/><p>In the teachers\u2019 chat group.</p><br/><p>Jiang Hui: \u201cDid you all hear what Master Lin said to the reporters today? About how we\u2019ll have a teachers\u2019 apartment building in future?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard it. I was shocked at that moment. This is Shanghai! Will Master Lin really build an apartment building for us?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s possible. Master Lin always stays true to his words. That\u2019s something that I\u2019ve discovered from observing him all this while.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cActually, we don\u2019t need to talk about these things. I\u2019m really exceptionally pleased with this job. The welfare benefits are great, so, even without the apartment building, I\u2019ve already decided to stick to it all the way.\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-5\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cThink about it. If we nurture these children, won\u2019t we have a great sense of satisfaction? This is something that we won\u2019t be able to enjoy in other schools. Moreover, I don\u2019t really enjoy socializing. If I go to other schools, I\u2019m afraid I would be pushed aside. Anyway, I\u2019m just going to stay here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMe too. Trust in Master Lin. He will definitely keep improving the welfare institute.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, I know that Chen Shi from before. Who would\u2019ve thought that Master Lin would anger him so harshly? I\u2019m delighted. In the past, a fellow student of mine reported some problems in our school. Later on, that Chen Shi notified the school about it and that fellow student of mine got kicked out of the school.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>To these hired teachers, Lin Fan\u2019s words today had given them a lot of hope for the future. They wondered how things would turn out.</p><br/><p>But according to their thoughts, things would turn out amazing.</p><br/><p>The next day!</p><br/><p>The news appeared on the Internet.</p><br/><p>\u2018Nanshan Children\u2019s Welfare Institute\u2019s teaching block has completed its construction. Master Lin\u2019s networks appear for the first time.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018A gathering of big shots, all to join in the opening ceremony of a teaching block.\u2019</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-6\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u2018Chen Shi personally goes to Nanshan Children\u2019s Welfare Institute but is angered by Master Lin on the spot and leaves in a rage.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Master Lin claims that he wants to build a library and a teachers\u2019 apartment building for his welfare institute.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Breaking! A secret among Master Lin and various big shots that has to be said!\u2019</p><br/><p>When the netizens saw these articles, they were all stunned. Initially, they thought that it was a very normal thing but upon further reading, things became very abnormal.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn! I didn\u2019t think that my company\u2019s boss was friends with Master Lin. My God, if I keep being a hater and I\u2019m discovered by Master Lin, he might tell my boss and I would be dead.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c^good luck. That might really happen.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, look at that. Isn\u2019t that the successor of Lu Corporation, our country\u2019s top organization? I didn\u2019t expect even him to go.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin is really respected, so much so that it\u2019s scary.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, my boss is there too. This motherf*cker\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c^are you Shanghainese?\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-7\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cYeah, I work in Shanghai.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSh*t, could it be that all the entrepreneurs in Shanghai are Master Lin\u2019s friends?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

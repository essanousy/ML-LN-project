Had his brain snapped?</p><br/><p>This Tianshu Milk wasn\u2019t an average company. It was a huge corporation. It wasn\u2019t one that anyone could just anger. What was this Master Lin posting?</p><br/><p>He had actually said that there was a problem with Tianshu Milk. It was a fatal move that would cause him huge trouble if it didn\u2019t turn out well.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have a plan,\u201d at that moment, Chief Chen cried out. He had thought of a good plan.</p><br/><p>Wang Mei Tian looked at Chief Chen curiously. \u201cWhat plan?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Chen said with a grin, \u201cWe\u2019ll immediately support Tianshu. According to my knowledge, Tianshu\u2019s ambassador contract has already expired. If we can get that contract, it would be greatly beneficial to your career. After all, this is a type of promotion that you wouldn\u2019t be able to get elsewhere. It would greatly increase your exposure.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Wang Mei Tian heard that, her heart was filled with delight. However, she felt that something wasn\u2019t right. \u201cChief Chen, it\u2019s not so easy to get the ambassador contract. I don\u2019t have such a big reputation yet, why would they select me as their ambassador just because I support them?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Chen laughed confidently. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, just leave this to me. All you have to do is show them your support. Also, it\u2019d be best if you post a video. While everyone is still in confusion, show your support for Tianshu and also criticize Master Lin at the same time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMmm, okay. That isn\u2019t hard at all.\u201d Wang Mei Tian smiled. This kind of task was easy. There was no difficulty to it at all. And to her, if she could carry this out well, her reward would be exceptional.</p><br/><p>Eastern Han Group.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang was looking at the songs contently. But when he saw the news on the Internet, he was completely stunned.</p><br/><p><em>What is my brother doing? He just left and he\u2019s already attracting this kind of trouble.</em></p><br/><p>Especially after reading all the contents, he was completely speechless.</p><br/><p>If it turned out that what his brother had posted was false, it would really be troublesome. Even if his status in society was even higher, he would still have to bear legal responsibility.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang immediately called him.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you doing? What\u2019s going on?\u201d asked Wang Ming Yang in a surprised tone.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan: \u201cIt\u2019s nothing much. What I said is the truth. Remember, don\u2019t drink Tianshu Milk. But if you aren\u2019t afraid, you can drink it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang was dazed as he didn\u2019t quite understand the situation. \u201cHow did you know? When did you start researching all this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t research at all. After leaving your place, I went to a small shop to buy a pack of cigarettes and I conveniently bought a bottle of milk as well. But when I drank it, I was surprised that there was a problem with the milk,\u201d said Lin Fan indifferently. It was as if he couldn\u2019t feel how big of a blow these words had on Wang Ming Yang.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang was speechless as he held the phone. He hadn\u2019t thought that his brother would say that he could tell just by drinking it.</p><br/><p><em>D*mn!</em></p><br/><p><em>This will cause a f*cking huge problem.</em></p><br/><p>Initially, Wang Ming Yang had wanted to yell at his brother to not be reckless. But now, he just said calmly, \u201cBrother, let\u2019s delete the post. Or you could say that you were hacked. You have no evidence. Lives could be lost over this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded. \u201cYeah, I know. That\u2019s why I posted it on Weibo. If I didn\u2019t, who knows when people would start to discover this? Don\u2019t worry. You don\u2019t have to worry about what I do. I drank quite a few mouthfuls. If I wasn\u2019t sure, do you think I would have done this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Helpless and at a loss.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang had said so many things to Lin Fan with a single intention: To stay calm and don\u2019t be reckless.</p><br/><p>But what made Wang Ming Yang feel helpless was that this brother of his wouldn\u2019t listen at all.</p><br/><p>In the end, they didn\u2019t say much more before hanging up.</p><br/><p>Cloud Street!</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shook his head as he chuckled. If he hadn\u2019t been sure, he definitely wouldn\u2019t have spoken on Weibo. However, he understood that such a thing was very hard for others to believe. However, he wasn\u2019t worried. The truth would always be revealed in the end. Right now, all he had to do was to spread this information.</p><br/><p>At the supermarket.</p><br/><p>A pair of lovers were buying things. When they picked up a box of Tianshu Milk, a passerby said, \u201cYou still dare to buy that milk?\u201d</p><br/><p>The pair of lovers looked at that person in confusion. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Is there a problem with this milk?\u201d</p><br/><p>The passerby replied, \u201cTake a look at Master Lin\u2019s Weibo. Master Lin has said that there\u2019s a huge issue with this milk. It has a high-level of carcinogen. It\u2019ll harm your health.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d The lovers were stunned. They hadn\u2019t expected this at all. Then, they quickly took out their phones and took a look. \u201cIt\u2019s true. Then we shan\u2019t buy this anymore. We\u2019ll buy another brand.\u201d</p><br/><p>The boss was standing there and he felt annoyed. \u201cThere\u2019s no evidence. It might just be a false rumor.</p><br/><p>The lovers waved their hands. \u201cForget it. It\u2019s better if we don\u2019t buy it for now. Since Master Lin has said it, it might be true. We shan\u2019t take the risk.\u201d</p><br/><p>The boss shook his head at the pair of lovers. <em>How could there be a problem? F*ck. This is a f*cking false rumor.</em></p><br/><p>This kind of situation had already happened several times. Initially, he had been confused about what was going on. Later on, he found out about what had happened.</p><br/><p>The passerby warned out of goodwill, \u201cBoss, I suggest you quickly return this milk to the distributor. If Master Lin says that there\u2019s a problem, there\u2019s definitely a problem. Moreover, right now, anyone who has seen Master Lin\u2019s Weibo wouldn\u2019t buy it.\u201d</p><br/><p>The boss looked at the passerby with a dumbfounded face. Then, he opened his WeChat app and realized that the people in his profession were saying the same thing.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn. What\u2019s going on? I can\u2019t sell my milk.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck. No one is buying my milk. Even if they buy it, they come and ask for a refund a while later. I\u2019m confused.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is up with this Master Lin? How could he say such nonsense without any evidence?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEnough talk. I\u2019m returning my stock to the distributors. If I can\u2019t sell it, it\u2019d just rot in my hands.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing the situation in the group, the boss didn\u2019t know what to do. And what he didn\u2019t know was that the distributor was also dumbfounded. Everyone was asking for refunds, how could they accept that? Then, the distributor immediately called their agent. If they couldn\u2019t sell it, of course they had to send it back to the producers.</p><br/><p>The next day!</p><br/><p>Lin Fan\u2019s Weibo post had spread very quickly. In just one day, it had spread to various big groups.</p><br/><p>Forums, social media platforms, etc. Overnight, it seemed as if the whole country knew about it.</p><br/><p>And on the Internet, news had already appeared.</p><br/><p>\u2018Tianshu Milk contains a 200% excess of aflatoxins. Is this true or false?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Master Lin warns netizens not to buy Tianshu Milk.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018In one day, the country has been thrown into panic. Netizens are against buying Tianshu Milk. Does one man really have that big of an influence?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018There\u2019s no evidence at all. Is it a false rumor? The consequences could be tremendous.\u2019</p><br/><p>The appearance of the news had blown the situation up completely. It wasn\u2019t an exaggeration to say that it was now known by everyone in the country.</p></div>\n</div>"}

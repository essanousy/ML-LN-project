The atmosphere right now was really great.</p><br/><p>Director Huang was accompanying him. \u201cMaster Lin, do you feel like the welfare institute is different now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan noded. \u201cMmm. It is really different now. This is all thanks to everyone\u2019s combined efforts.\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Huang said with a laugh, \u201cMaster Lin, it\u2019s actually mostly your efforts. If it wasn\u2019t for you, the welfare institute wouldn\u2019t have become what it is today.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRecently, I\u2019ve been working on something. If it succeeds, those children who have been missing these will be able to become like normal people again,\u201d said Lin Fan as he pointed at his arms and legs.</p><br/><p>Director Huang looked at Lin Fan as her expression slowly changed. \u201cMaster Lin, you mean\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded. \u201cYep. Don\u2019t worry. It will be realized very soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, could it be really different from those prosthetic limbs that are already on the market?\u201d Director Huang asked eagerly. Her biggest worry was actually those children with missing limbs.</p><br/><p>Sometimes, when she looked at them, her heart would feel very uneasy.</p><br/><p>\u201cThose on the market?\u201d Lin Fan laughed mysteriously. \u201cDirector Huang, I shan\u2019t tell you for now. When they come out, you\u2019ll know.\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Huang decided not to pursue any further. However, she was looking forward to it very much. She trusted Master Lin very much, so she didn\u2019t doubt him at all.</p><br/><p>After all the incidents that had happened before, she could tell that Master Lin was a very responsible person. No matter what he did, he would do them to perfection.</p><br/><p>For example, a place like the welfare institute was not something that could be improved overnight. It had to be built up slowly and patiently over a long period of time.</p><br/><p>Up until now, Nanshan Children\u2019s Welfare Institute had gone through a long and arduous road but now, everything was great and it was developing in a good direction.</p><br/><p>To Director Huang, those prosthetic limbs on the market couldn\u2019t compare to real limbs at all. They were completely incomparable.</p><br/><p>These were high-tech things.</p><br/><p>Although Lin Fan didn\u2019t understand it either, the knowledge that the Encyclopedia imbued him with was no joke.</p><br/><p>*Ding ding!*</p><br/><p>At that moment, his phone rang.</p><br/><p>\u201cZi Le, what is it?\u201d Lin Fan hadn\u2019t expected Xu Zi Le to call him.</p><br/><p>Xu Zi Le spoke very softly, \u201cBrother Lin, could you come to Ming Yang\u2019s company?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was startled. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t figure what was going on. It was even a little mysterious.</p><br/><p>Xu Zi Le: \u201cJust now, a group of very fierce people came. Ming Yan\u2019s expression was a little unpleasant. That\u2019s why I want to ask Brother Lin to come and take a look.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll come right now.\u201d After hearing that, Lin Fan left the welfare institute without saying another word.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t want to ask too much over the phone. If there was no problem, he could treat it as a casual trip. However, if there was a problem, he had to be there.</p><br/><p>Eastern Han Group.</p><br/><p>Upstairs.</p><br/><p>Xu Zi Le stood outside. And by her side was Wang Ming Yang\u2019s secretary.</p><br/><p>\u201cSister Xu, do you think there\u2019ll be a problem?\u201d asked the secretary softly. There was a slight bit of worry on her face. The people who had just come looked very fierce and they made her a little afraid.</p><br/><p>Xu Zi Le didn\u2019t know what was going on either but she said calmly, \u201cI think it won\u2019t be a problem. I just called Brother Lin and he\u2019s already on the way now.\u201d</p><br/><p>When the secretary heard that Master Lin was coming, she heaved a sigh of relief. That Master Lin was really f*cking awesome. If he were to come, there definitely wouldn\u2019t be any problems.</p><br/><p>In the conference room.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang was sitting there, looking at the man in front of him with a dignified expression.</p><br/><p>That man had one leg placed over the other. He had an air of arrogance as he looked at Wang Ming Yang with a disdainful look. Then, he started playing with his phone.</p><br/><p>\u201cChief Wang, I\u2019m here. Tell me what you want to do with me,\u201d said Chu Shen calmly.</p><br/><p>Behind him were several big men. They seemed like bodyguards.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang didn\u2019t say anything. He hadn\u2019t expected to have drawn in such a big character.</p><br/><p>The young master of Huaizhou\u2019s Chu Family. In Huaizhou, the Chu Family\u2019s business empire was huge. It could be said to dominate the whole of Huaizhou.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang didn\u2019t have much of a relationship with Chu Shen but they had an argument on a business forum.</p><br/><p>Because Wang Ming Yang had been too rash, he had directly scolded the opposite party, saying \u2018If you stand in front of me, I\u2019ll beat you up until you look like a pig.\u2019</p><br/><p>He hadn\u2019t expected the opposite party to come all the way from Huaizhou just because of those words.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Why is the fiery and arrogant Chief Wang suddenly not speaking? Didn\u2019t you say on the forum that you were going to beat me up until I look like a pig? Why don\u2019t you dare to say anything now that I\u2019m here?\u201d Chu Shen stood up and walked around the table to Wang Ming Yang\u2019s side. He placed both hands on the table as he said, \u201cSay something, Chief Wang.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang looked at him with a dignified expression. In his heart, he was thinking about how to resolve this.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat exactly do you want?\u201d asked Wang Ming Yang.</p><br/><p>He wasn\u2019t afraid of trouble. But the opposite party\u2019s status was rather high.</p><br/><p>Chu Shen picked up the cup from the table and waved it around in his hand. \u201cChief Wang, do you think I\u2019d dare to splash this water on your face?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang looked at him and knew that this wouldn\u2019t be resolved easily.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang, you\u2019re really disappointing. Where\u2019s the bravery you had on the forum? If it was me, I\u2019d definitely beat you up until you looked like a pig. As for this cup of water, I don\u2019t care what you say but I\u2019d definitely dare to do it.\u201d Chu Shen placed one hand on Wang Ming Yang\u2019s shoulder. \u201cDo you know why? That\u2019s because of a difference in our power. Do you understand?\u201d</p><br/><p>*Clatter!*</p><br/><p>\u201cA difference in power? How much power?\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, the conference room door was pushed open.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d Wang Ming Yang was confused as he saw Lin Fan come in. But when he saw Xu Zi Le holding her phone outside, he understood.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan came to Wang Ming Yang\u2019s side and swatted Chu Shen\u2019s hand away. \u201cI just came for a visit. I didn\u2019t expect to see this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, he looked at Chu Shen. \u201cYou were saying whether you dared to splash the water on my brother\u2019s face. I actually want to see how you do it. Splash it then.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Shen looked at who had come. He had not expected it to be Master Lin at all. There weren\u2019t many with his status who didn\u2019t know about Master Lin.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, I don\u2019t think this has to do with you,\u201d said Chu Shen in a calm tone.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded. \u201cYep. It has nothing to do with me. But this master wants to know if you dare to splash the water. Ming Yang, hold your head steady. Let him splash the water.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, the big men behind Chu Yuan came over. They looked at Lin Fan alertly. They were all martial artists and they were much more powerful than those association people. They practiced genuine kung fu.</p><br/><p>However, they knew about that incident at Kunlun Mountain. This Master Lin was a true master. It wouldn\u2019t take him long to destroy them.</p><br/><p>Chu Shen said, \u201cMaster Lin, are you going to meddle into this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGive me the water.\u201d Lin Fan extended his hand.</p><br/><p>Chu Shen hesitated for a moment before passing the cup over. At that instant, he felt his face become wet.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan splashed the water on Chu Shen\u2019s face. Then, he placed the cup on the table.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just splashing some water and you\u2019re dilly-dallying.\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

Then, he looked at Lin Fan, \"Should I answer it?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan just looked at Wang Ming Yang and blinked. He didn't know what to say at all. He had been sabotaged by Wang Ming Yang and he had given up on the situation. Wang Ming Yang could really think of something.</p><br/><p>It was just a matchmaking session. It's normal to not be liked by the other party. What was he trying to do?</p><br/><p>But he was rather excited. After all, he's a human too and he had an egoistic side to him.</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan wanted to reply, his mother interrupted, \"Lil' Wang, pick it up. Why did this boy blacklist a beautiful girl? It just doesn't make sense. He even made them look for you instead.\"</p><br/><p>He looked at Lin Fan's mother and understood her intention. She wanted to open it for everyone to see.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \"Mum\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Then, he just shut up and pretended he didn't say anything. After all, it had already happened and there was nothing he could say. What else could he have said? He just let them continue with the show.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang picked up the phone.</p><br/><p>An elegant voice could be heard from the video call.</p><br/><p>\"Brother Wang, where is Fan Fan? I called him but couldn't get through. Did he blacklist me again?\"</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang wanted to reply but he realized that Lin Fan's mother was waving her hand at him. She didn't want him to speak the truth. Then, he replied, \"No, his phone ran out of battery and now it's switched off. I'll pass the phone to him for you.\"</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan saw Wang Ming Yang hand the phone over, he didn't know whether he should pick it up or not.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan's mother said, \"Quickly pick it up\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at his mum and Wang Ming Yang and realized that Wang Ming Yang was laughing. Then, he took the phone from Wang Ming Yang and pointed the phone's camera towards himself but he didn't say anything.</p><br/><p>Qiao Yue Yue said, \"Why are you ignoring me?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the face in the video call and was stunned. She looked very familiar.</p><br/><p>Then, he recovered from his daze.</p><br/><p>Qiao Yue Yue? The famous actress that was always talked about on Weibo? What is Wang Ming Yang up to? He's playing with such high stakes. How am I going to close the case? D*mn it\u2026</p><br/><p>Qiao Yue Yue said, \"Why are you not saying anything? Do you really hate me? I can leave if you hate me. I won't disturb you anymore. I am so exhausted from work every day but I always want to chat with you after work. You don't even want to pick up my calls.\" *cries*</p><br/><p>She immediately started tearing up. Her acting skills were top-notch. If she didn't get the best actress award, the tears would've gone to waste.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was speechless. How was he supposed to react to that?</p><br/><p>Sister Chen was stunned when she heard what the girl said over the phone. That\u2026</p><br/><p>Lin Fan's mother sat there and pointed at him. Then, she chided, \"A girl is speaking to you. Why are you not replying? Are you a mute?\"</p><br/><p>Qiao Yue Yue continued, \"Who is beside you? Did you really go for matchmaking today? Why did you go for matchmaking? Do you think I'm not good enough? Tell me why. I am willing to change. If you don't like my job, I can quit\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan wanted to reply with, \"Girl, can you not say such things? It would kill me.\"</p><br/><p>Then, Lin Fan's mother stood behind Lin Fan and patted his head, \"Pass the phone to mum.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan felt chills down his spine and he was stunned by his mum's expression. So, he handed the phone over to her.</p><br/><p>The stern expression on her face suddenly changed. She looked like a kindly woman. Then, she spoke to the person in the video call, \"Hi, I am Lin Fan's mother. Please don't be misunderstood. I am the one at fault for arranging the matchmaking session. He didn't tell me about you. I thought he was single and couldn't find a girlfriend. Therefore, I was anxious for him to come for this. Please don't blame auntie.\"</p><br/><p>Qiao Yue Yue quickly wiped her tears and she looked a little nervous, \"Hi Auntie, I\u2026 I\u2026\"</p><br/><p>When she saw the lady in the video call, she was stunned. \"Daddy, come here. This lady is so pretty.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan's dad was stunned when he saw the lady in the video call. His smile was so wide that his eyes were barely visible. He was happy again.</p><br/><p>The more Lin Fan's mum looked at the lady in the video call, the more she liked her. She was ecstatic too. She didn't expect her son to be wooed by someone so pretty. Their ancestors must be watching over them. Soon, they found this lady to be familiar. It seemed as if they had seen her before but they weren't bothered by it.</p><br/><p>\"Girl, how old are you now?\"</p><br/><p>Qiao Yue Yue replied, \"Auntie, I am twenty-four this year.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan's mum said, \"Where are you from?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan's presence had been completely ignored. He glanced at Wang Ming Yang. This fella really wasn't going to let things end normally. He had to create trouble one way or another. He wanted to see how Wang Ming Yang was going to end this. If he had known that this was going to happen, he wouldn't have let him follow along.</p><br/><p>Sister Chen left her seat and said, \"Sister Zhou, let me have look\u2026\"</p><br/><p>She was curious after hearing Sister Zhou praise the lady and she wanted to see it for herself.</p><br/><p>Yang Ting Ting looked at Zhang Xin Yue and smiled. They weren't bothered by it at all. In the eyes of their parents, as long as the lady looked normal, they would be considered to be pretty. Also, the conversation with the lady on the phone was pretty disgusting. They must have watched too many dramas to think of this.</p><br/><p>His mother's face lit up, \"Let auntie have a look at you.\"</p><br/><p>When Sister Chen saw the lady in the video call, she was also stunned. She was extremely pretty. Then, she exclaimed, \"This girl looks exactly like that famous actress, Qiao Yue Yue.\"</p><br/><p>Yang Ting Ting said, \"Mum, I think you're too addicted to 'The Legend of the Red Clouds'. It's normal for you to think that a pretty lady actually looks like Qiao Yue Yue. She's a real celebrity\u2026\"</p><br/><p>She didn't finish her sentence. She wanted to add on, \"How could she like someone like him?\"</p><br/><p>Zhang Xin Yue smirked and whispered, \"What a joke.\"</p><br/><p>Yang Ting Ting nodded, \"Yeah.\"</p><br/><p>But they were both stunned by what the person in the video call said.</p><br/><p>\"Auntie, I am indeed Qiao Yue Yue. I finished filming 'The Legend of the Red Clouds' three months ago.\"</p><br/><p>Sister Chen was dumbfounded when she heard it.</p><br/><p>Yang Ting Ting and Zhang Xin Yue were both in disbelief. They ran over out of curiosity. But when they saw the face in the video call, their jaws widened in disbelief.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan's mother was also stunned, \"You're really that super celebrity, Qiao Yue Yue! I've been following the show closely too.\"</p><br/><p>Qiao Yue Yue replied, \"Auntie, I'm indeed the one!\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan's mother was stunned at her answer. Then, she looked at her son. She thought that her ancestors have been such a blessing to them.</p><br/><p>Everyone looked at Lin Fan and then turned to look at the video call.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan patted Wang Ming Yang on his shoulder and whispered, \"You caused this trouble. Please settle it for me. I'll be leaving now.\"</p><br/><p>As of the current situation, the matchmaking session had officially come to an end. He didn't want to be involved in what was going to happen next. He wanted to leave immediately.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang wanted to say something but Lin Fan had already left the room.</p><br/><p>He felt helpless. Why did he leave so quickly? There were more to come.</p><br/><p>If Lin Fan knew about it, he would definitely vomit blood. Wang Ming Yang was crazy.</p><br/><p>Then, Qiao Yue Yue and Mother Lin chatted happily. Mother Lin was ecstatic. She didn't even bother about Lin Fan sneaking out of the room. She was extremely happy with this lady. She felt as if she had one less burden.</p><br/><p>*Ring ring*</p><br/><p>Another phone call came.</p><br/><p>The notification was Huang Tian Yang.</p><br/><p>When Zhang Xin Yue saw the name, she was dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>\"Lil' Wang, there's another phone call,\" Mother Lin said. She was chatting happily with Qiao Yue Yue but it was interrupted by the phone call. She accidentally turned on the loudspeaker mode.</p><br/><p>Then, a deep and resounding voice came from the phone.</p><br/><p>\"Brother Wang, I managed to get a limited sports car for you recently. I've kept it with me for you\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang took the phone over and said, \"We can discuss further when I get back to Shanghai.\"</p><br/><p>Then, he hung up the phone and said, \"Auntie, Lin Fan left this room earlier. I'll go look for him now and we can talk further when we return to your house.\"</p><br/><p>After saying that, he left the room too.</p><br/><p>Huang Tian Yang was shocked. Chief Wang should've replied with, \"If it costs less than thirty million dollars, I don't want it.\" Why did he hang up?</p><br/><p>Then, everyone in the room was stunned.</p><br/><p>Zhang Xin Yue was extremely stunned. The person on the phone was Huang Tian Yang. A lot of people knew who he was. Then, she turned to Yang Ting Ting. They must have missed out on someone powerful.</p><br/><p>As for Yang Ting Ting's ex-boyfriend, although he was a wealthy man, he probably can't even match up to this man at all.</p><br/><p>Anyway, everything was under Wang Ming Yang's control. He managed to brag in front of everyone. However, it wasn't done perfectly. It was because the first impact was too great and it stunned everyone in the room.</p><br/><p>He didn't want to continue with the prank anymore.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

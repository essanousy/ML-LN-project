Why is it so noisy?\u201d one of the customers said, looking dissatisfied. He had come to the restraint to eat and wanted the private room for quietness. Who knew that such a huge ruckus would break out? It sounded as if people were killing pigs in the other room, and it was disrupting everyone who was eating peacefully.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy apologies, Mister. Something serious happened in that room.\u201d</p><br/><p>People loved to see fights break out. When they heard that something serious happened, they all quieted down and started looking curious, \u201cWhat happened? Are they fighting?\u201d</p><br/><p>The waiter looked at the man, his mind flustered.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s serious, but they aren\u2019t fighting yet. Could I ask you guys to return to your rooms as a precautionary measure?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it that serious?\u201d the customers all looked on, stunned.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happened inside?\u201d the manager of the restraint rushed over, asking.</p><br/><p>\u201cManager, a fight is breaking out inside?\u201d the waiter replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? A fight? What are you waiting for? Break it up now!\u201d the manager said, looking concerned. If they didn\u2019t handle this properly, it would become a huge problem.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I can\u2019t. The person that got hit is Ying Jing, the famous celebrity. The person that hit her is Master Lin. Master Lin told us specifically not to come in.\u201d</p><br/><p>The manager was stunned. What on earth was going on? He knew who Master Lin was- he was the pride of Shanghai, but he never thought that Master Lin would be inside beating people up.</p><br/><p>This\u2026this\u2026</p><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue had been waiting for quite some time but didn\u2019t see Brother Lin anywhere. She started getting a little concerned, subsequently going up to one of the waiters, \u201cHave you seen the man that was with me just now?\u201d</p><br/><p>The waiter looked at her, \u201cMadam, your companion is in that private room beating up people.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue was completely dazed after hearing what the waiter said. She immediately took off and ran towards the private room.</p><br/><p>Inside the private room.</p><br/><p>Ying Jing\u2019s face was black and her nostrils were flared. Her expression was terrifying, \u201cDamned Lin, I want you to die.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re one stubborn fellow. Who gave you the courage?\u201d Lin Fan said to Ying Jing, who was sprawled on the floor. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you, if you even dare to touch Wu Huan Yue again, I\u2019ll beat you to a pulp, do you believe me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, please don\u2019t hit her. There are so many people outside watching you. If you have anything to say, just talk this out. We don\u2019t want anyone getting hurt here,\u201d the vice-president of the Shanghai Satellite TV network said.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you know who I am?\u201d Lin Fan turned to the vice-president.</p><br/><p>The vice-president of the broadcasting network nodded his head immediately, \u201cYes, you are Shanghai\u2019s Master Lin, everyone knows who you are.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou know me, and so you should know what my character is like. This problem has nothing to do with you. Do not interfere in any way. This is between me and her,\u201d Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>The vice-president of the broadcasting network didn\u2019t know what to say, his face in a daze. As a local Shanghai citizen, he had been following Master Lin for quite a while and knew how he was like.</p><br/><p>When you were on his good side, he would be the friendliest and kindest person ever. However, it was the complete opposite when he got angry at someone, even the ghosts would shudder if they had to go near him when he was pissed at someone.</p><br/><p>A crowd was gathering outside, and all of them were shocked.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn, this is just too awesome. That person inside is Ying Jing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn, what happened to Ying Jing? Did you see who hit her? That person is Master Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSh*t, this is big news, that Master Lin had hit Ying Jing. This will surely be in tomorrow\u2019s headlines.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI like this aggressiveness.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhich normal person would dare to do it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue pushed the crowd aside, and was completely shocked after seeing what had happened in the private room, \u201cBrother Lin, please don\u2019t hit her anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue held onto Lin Fan\u2019s waist tightly, wanting to pull him away from the place. However, her strength couldn\u2019t compare to Lin Fan\u2019s, and despite her efforts, Lin Fan didn\u2019t budge at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Lin, please don\u2019t hit her anymore. Everyone can see you,\u201d Wu Huan Yue said, tears rolling down her cheeks. Although she hated Ying Jing, she couldn\u2019t deny that Ying Jing won\u2019t take this with her lightly. She was a huge celebrity and now that she had been slapped by someone else, she could easily send Brother Lin to jail with her influence- and Wu Huan Yue dreaded the thought of that happening.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuan Yue, don\u2019t stop me. There isn\u2019t a problem here. I must let her know today that seniority doesn\u2019t count for anything if there isn\u2019t any substance. Let\u2019s see what she can do to me,\u201d Lin Fan said fearlessly.</p><br/><p>Ying Jing?</p><br/><p>It was all fun and games online when they were just bickering and trading insults. Now that it really happened in real life, it was something totally different.</p><br/><p>Ying Jing was a huge celebrity and could be considered as one of the legends in the music industry. People would always see her and pay respects to her, but now that she had been humiliated like that, she couldn\u2019t take it.</p><br/><p>She couldn\u2019t take it one bit.</p><br/><p>She was not going to let this die down without anything. She wanted revenge and wanted Lin Fan to suffer.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, you may have hit me, but mark my words. If this b*tch still stands in the music industry tomorrow, I am not Ying Jing,\u201d Ying Jing said, looking menacing. The people who were standing around were all on tenterhooks.</p><br/><p>This was the legend of the music industry when she was angry- full of power and threats. Everyone who was standing around was scared.</p><br/><p>Everyone but Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat b*llshit is that? Fine, you\u2019re one of the music legends right? I\u2019ll drag you out right now and let everyone see how I deal with scum like you. Move!\u201d Lin Fan commanded, dragging Ying Jing out.</p><br/><p>Ying Jing was completely shocked- did Master Lin not care about his dignity and reputation at all?</p><br/><p>If they went outside, everyone would have been able to see them. Both of them would be humiliated.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet go of me, you mutt,\u201d Ying Jing hollered, struggling to break free from Lin Fan\u2019s grip.</p><br/><p>However, Lin Fan had already made his decision. The sun wasn\u2019t going to rise tomorrow until he had sorted Ying Jing out.</p><br/><p>The onlookers were completely dumbfounded. They had never seen anything like this before, especially a huge celebrity that was fighting for control while screaming and kicking. That was Ying Jing.</p><br/><p>The vice-president of the broadcasting network didn\u2019t know what to do? How did all of this happen in the first place?</p><br/><p>The gathering they had today over dinner was to welcome Ying Jing, to celebrate her role as a mentor in the singing competition that they were hosting. How did all this turn out like this?</p><br/><p>Could Ying Jing still become a mentor?</p><br/><p>Definitely not.</p><br/><p>On the main street.</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone gather around! The celebrity Ying Jing is over here!\u201d Lin Fan shouted, as the people who passed by turned their attention to him.</p><br/><p>Ying Jing was embarrassed, but Master Lin was too thick skinned. Lin Fan used that to his advantage and decided to let everyone know what had happened.</p><br/><p>What will happen afterward?</p><br/><p>He hadn\u2019t thought about it.</p><br/><p>It was at most another month in prison. The facilities inside weren\u2019t too bad, and he had already gotten used to it the last time he was inside.</p><br/><p>The people were like ducks to water as they heard the name \u2018Ying Jing\u2019. A whole crowd of people gathered around.</p><br/><p>However, the people were shocked as they saw a Ying Jing being covered in food.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck, that really is Ying Jing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn, am I seeing things wrong? How did Ying Jing turn out like that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat person is Master Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Master Lin is here too? Could it be that Master Lin is teaching Ying Jing a lesson?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ying Jing started panicking after seeing a huge crowd of people gathered around her, some even taking videos.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t record, please don\u2019t take me,\u201d Ying Jing hollered. However, her cries were in vain. Suddenly, she turned to Lin Fan, viciously saying, \u201cI am going to bring you down.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck off,\u201d Lin Fan said. Without looking at her, he extended his arms, slapping her on the face again.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn, that was cool.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin is in big trouble.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is huge news! This is just too unexpected.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

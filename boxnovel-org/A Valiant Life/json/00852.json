He was wondering how they could be so unforgiving.</p><br/><p>This was totally different from what he was thinking.</p><br/><p><em>Could they have studied so much that they\u2019ve become stup*d?</em></p><br/><p><em>Have they really become so selfish, only caring about themselves as well as being so unforgiving?</em></p><br/><p><em>D*mn!</em></p><br/><p><em>This was really a pity.</em></p><br/><p>When he reached the entrance to Jin He University, he had already finished doing his preparations. Given the current situation this school was in, he was afraid that his righteous approach would not work.</p><br/><p>His Hummer stopped at the entrance. Lin Fan made his expression a little more serious to let the guards feel his vigor and then slowly opened the door.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe school does not allow outside vehicles to enter,\u201d the security guard at the door came by and said. However, when he took a closer look and saw who was in the car, the security guard was stunned. Then, he could not help crying out in excitement.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan\u2019s expression became friendlier. He did not expect that the security guard would actually recognize him. Thus, he couldn\u2019t be so cold anymore.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t wait for Lin Fan to say anything before he said excitedly, \u201cMaster Lin, are you here to uphold the justice in this place? I saw your post on Weibo saying that you would be coming.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded and said, \u201cYep.\u201d</p><br/><p>The security guard heard this and immediately pressed the button. The school\u2019s electronic gate slowly opened, \u201cMaster Lin, you should get in quickly. The rascals here are really out of this world. If I did not rely on this place to support myself, I would have taken a weapon and fought with them already, they are really huge bullies. I really pity those female students. Okay, I won\u2019t say so much, you should quickly get in.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He was a little stunned. Then he laughed. He never thought that this security guard was so righteous.</p><br/><p><em>D*mn, if I don\u2019t settle this situation today, I\u2019ll really be letting down this man who opened the gate for me.</em></p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, you can just wait for the good news. Although this doesn\u2019t really concern me and can be deemed as meddling with other people\u2019s business, but that\u2019s what I like to do. If anyone has any issues, I\u2019ll definitely come and butt in,\u201d Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. Master Lin, I\u2019m a big fan of yours. I really like your personality. However, you should quickly get in. From what I saw just now, there was some very barbaric ruckus. They are gathering below the female\u2019s dormitories, I\u2019ll give you the directions there. Just walk towards there and you will be able to see it,\u201d the security guard pointed to the nearby road and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cHeroic man. If anyone causes you trouble in the future, you can come to Cloud Street and find me. From how you opened the door for me today, I can feel that you\u2019re a real man,\u201d Lin Fan did not say much else then stepped on the gas pedal and quickly drove in.</p><br/><p>The security guard stood at the same spot and watched the car zoom away. Immediately, he felt very different.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said that he was a true man. Such a praise really made him feel exceptionally happy.</p><br/><p>They were also filled with anticipation. That group of rascals was done for.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Below the dormitories.</p><br/><p>The ruckus was even louder. A group of students was surrounding the area, watching, pointing around as well as holding on to their phones.</p><br/><p>They felt that this demonstration was really very unfathomable. They were merely studying and had to wear masks whenever they left the house, so how did this obstruct their cause?</p><br/><p>However, there were bits of gossip that were being spread around.</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard that Jin Shan Ping offended her roommate and now she is being aimed at.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI also heard that gossip. However, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s real or not. If it really is like that then it\u2019s really too disgusting.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it that Han Yan? She is the school\u2019s female goddess. There are a lot of people who secretly like her. I\u2019ve seen her circle of friends with a picture of Jin Shan Ping and I was very surprised. Then, a group of dumb*sses gathered together and wanted to chase Jin Shan Ping away for their goddess.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlso, I heard that Han Yan was raised by a gangster. That gangster has a very good relationship with the school\u2019s headmaster and he even sent him some money to chase Jin Shan Ping out of the school.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt can\u2019t be. Jin Shan Ping didn\u2019t even provoke them, how can they treat her like that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow would I know? This society is really extraordinary. If it is not you provoking other people, then other people will come and disturb you. In the end, no one would understand what is happening and wouldn\u2019t know why such a thing has happened.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHush! Don\u2019t talk about it anymore. If other people hear us talking about it, it will be bad for us as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>On the scene.</p><br/><p>Jin Shan Ping lowered her head in despair. Tears were flowing down her cheeks. She did not know how to act in the face of all of her own schoolmates trying to chase her out.</p><br/><p>At this moment, within the group of people, the girl that everyone was looking out for, stood up.</p><br/><p>\u201cJin Shan Ping, if I were you, I would not stay in this school anymore. All you ever do is think about yourself. You\u2019ve never thought about us before. You being in this school is affecting all of us,\u201d Han Yan very calmly said. However, on her face was a very complacent smile, one which frightened people.</p><br/><p>Right now, she was extremely satisfied. This whole situation was instigated by her. Initially, she just wanted to complain, so she wrote a small post on the school\u2019s forum to blame her. However, she did not think that it would actually blow up to such a large extent.</p><br/><p>Some of the male students heard their female goddess say that one sentence, and one by one they all agreed with it.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, it doesn\u2019t affect you but it deeply affects all of us.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust hurry up and go. Don\u2019t stay here any longer.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou must really not want any face. No one here welcomes you and you still insist on staying here. It\u2019s really a joke.\u201d</p><br/><p>The headmaster saw this entire scene and opened his mouth and spoke, \u201cOkay, students, stop it,\u201d then his gaze shifted to Jin Shan Ping, \u201cStudent Jin, I hope that you\u2019ll carefully think about this. Whether it\u2019s about you or about other students, you should try to empathize.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEmpathise your *ss.\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, booming noise could be heard. In everyone\u2019s eyes, a Hummer drove in flashily. Due to the friction between the tires and the ground, it made a monstrously ear-piercing noise. Ignoring the parking spot, it immediately came to a halt, blocking the entire road.</p><br/><p>The silhouette of a man appeared. It pushed the door open and a man immediately came out.</p><br/><p>The surrounding students saw the person and cried out in shock.</p><br/><p>\u201cSh*t! Master Lin is here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMotherf*cker, Master Lin really came. This is really going to blow up.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cQuick, start videoing! This thing is going to become disastrous. Master Lin is famous for poking his nose into others business because when he sees something that makes him unhappy, he will definitely go and settle it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cToo cool. We can see how presumptuous he can be.\u201d</p><br/><p>Some of the students who didn\u2019t dare to make any noise saw that Master Lin had come and finally found a backbone and became braver.</p><br/><p>Initially, they did not dare to say anything. But now, they were even louder in their discussion.</p><br/><p>The school\u2019s headmaster and teachers all came by and looked on.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy is this b*stard here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Right now, he had a deep amount of hatred for Lin Fan.</p><br/><p><em>Tell me, does this issue even concern him the smallest bit?</em></p><br/><p>He was really so insistent on poking his nose into other people\u2019s issues. He had been the school\u2019s headmaster for such a long time and regardless of what kind of parents he faced, he has always been very polite. However, right now, there was this young man, who became so cocky just because of some small accomplishments, thinking of himself as some sort of God.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p></div>\n</div>"}

They just nodded but didn\u2019t make any sound. They didn\u2019t want to affect Master Lin and they wanted to have a perfect artwork.</p><br/><p>Yue Qiu Ju Shi was extremely excited while he was looking at the artwork. This artwork was going to be another top-notch one. He wondered how Master Lin had managed to master his skills to draw such beautiful artworks. Its charm and grace were definitely exceptional. Although it wasn\u2019t completed yet, it already had a unique charm to it.</p><br/><p>Tao Shi Gang specialized in drawing the scenic mountains and waters and Master Lin was drawing that. Tao Shi Gang felt that Master Lin was using a lot of techniques that he had never seen before. He wanted to ask him about it but didn\u2019t dare to do interrupt him.</p><br/><p>However, Master Lin was actually thinking about a lot of things. Then, he started to speak, \u201cThis is the dotting technique. It involves the referral point, drooping vine point, rice point and moss point. The moss point is especially important.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy is it so important?\u201d Tao Shi Gang unknowingly asked. Then, he quickly kept quiet as if he felt that he had affected Master Lin.</p><br/><p>Master Lin smiled. \u201cWhen you use it in drawing scenic mountains and waters, you have to be cautious of your strokes. You have to press it at the center and when your pen leaves the paper, it has to be a clean break. You have to use a little bit of force and be firm like a rock dropping from a high peak. At the same time, you have to be like a chicken eating rice grains; quick and rhythmic. Also, you have to be cautious of the changes in colors and thickness.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough a scenic mountains and waters drawing could be said to only have mountains, there are a lot of drawing techniques and if you\u2019re able to execute them correctly, you\u2019d have a world-class artwork.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tao Shi Gang nodded. Although Master Lin had only spoken a few sentences, it was clear and concise. If he didn\u2019t practice more, he wouldn\u2019t be able to possess such skills.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan continued to draw slowly as if he wasn\u2019t bothered by anything else.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Outside, just opposite the art exhibition center.</p><br/><p>A lot of teenage girls were jumping and cheering while holding onto their flashy signboards.</p><br/><p>\u201cXuan Ming oppa\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, Xuan Ming oppa looked at me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jin Xuan Ming had just exited the hospital but he was in a wheelchair. He pushed himself into the corporate building and the female fans at the sides were cheering. It was as if they had gone mad.</p><br/><p>Some of the hardcore fans were filled with tears. \u201cWhy did my Xuan Ming oppa face such a punishment? God, I am willing to take his place instead.\u201d</p><br/><p><em>Ding ding!</em></p><br/><p>The female fan\u2019s phone rang and she took a glance at it.</p><br/><p>\u201cDaughter, mum is in the hospital. When will you be having your holidays? Please come and visit me.\u201d</p><br/><p>The message didn\u2019t even worry the female fan. She immediately exited the messages app and opened up the camera app. She pointed it at Jin Xuan Ming and cheered crazily.</p><br/><p>\u201cOppa, oppa\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Jin Xuan Ming loved atmospheres like this. He felt that he was center of attention. Everyone was looking at him and they were watching his every action and word. Their eyes slowly moved along with him.</p><br/><p>He waved his hand and greeted the Chinese fans. He felt that the fans were able to assist him greatly in his future.</p><br/><p>\u201cI love you guys.\u201d Jin Xuan Ming didn\u2019t know how to speak Mandarin but as a celebrity, he knew how to say a simple sentence like this. Furthermore, he was extremely good at deceiving fans and obviously he would know something like this.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t just know how to say \u2018I love you guys\u2019, he also knew how to say \u2018Thank you\u2019.</p><br/><p>The fans were cheering extremely loudly and it was as if the roof was about to collapse.</p><br/><p>In the lift.</p><br/><p>Jin Xuan Ming was helped into the lift by his assistant. He went up to the events floor.</p><br/><p>Some of the fans took the lift beside him while others started to climb the stairs. They weren\u2019t deterred by the fact that they had to climb over ten stories to the events floor.</p><br/><p>Xuan Ming oppa was there even though he was injured and they felt that it wasn\u2019t a big deal for them to climb the stairs for him.</p><br/><p>In the lift.</p><br/><p>Jin Xuan Ming spoke to the rest in Korean.</p><br/><p>Jin Xuan Ming said, \u201cLook, these Chinese fans are too crazy. It\u2019s something that\u2019s not possible in Korea.\u201d</p><br/><p>The manager nodded. \u201cYeah, as long as we can capture their attention, we\u2019ll be cashing in.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jin Xuan Ming replied, \u201cWhen I go back to Korea, I believe it\u2019ll be this good too.\u201d</p><br/><p>The manager nodded and smiled. She had managed a few Korean celebrities before and she had tried to send all those outdated Korean celebrities to China. At least eight out of ten of them could become famous in China.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, they became extremely popular. Earning money wasn\u2019t a problem for them at all but it didn\u2019t last long because there were a lot of Korean celebrities who were queuing to enter China. All of them wouldn\u2019t just rush there because it would affect the fans\u2019 attention span.</p><br/><p>In the past, some of the Korean celebrities had been famous in China because of some television programmes. Then, they came to make profits in China before returning back to Korea for another Korean celebrity to continue the trend.</p><br/><p>In the eyes of the Korean celebrities, China was like a pot of gold for them.</p><br/><p>The people there were especially dumb and rich.</p><br/><p>There were a lot of advertisement contracts being offered to these Korean celebrities.</p><br/><p>In the lobby of the corporate event.</p><br/><p>It was already filled with fans.</p><br/><p>Jin Xuan Ming pushed himself out on the wheelchair and smiled. \u201c^&amp;@!*#[email\u00a0protected]!\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The manager translated, \u201cHi fans, I am Jin Xuan Ming, how are you guys today?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re feeling great!\u201d The fans cheered.</p><br/><p>Jin Xuan Ming continued to speak and the manager continued translating, \u201cAlthough something unpleasant happened recently, I believe that most of the Chinese people here are as cute and kind as you guys. You guys are the angels of my heart. I love all of you.\u201d</p><br/><p>The hardcore fans were so moved that they started to cry. Those words really touched them.</p><br/><p>\u201cOppa, you are also our angel.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll love you forever.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat man is not a Chinese. He\u2019s not worthy of being a Chinese.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe will always treat oppa kindly. Oppa, we love you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat f*cking Master Lin actually bullied our oppa, we have to take revenge.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, we can\u2019t forgive him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Jin Xuan Ming just smiled. Although he didn\u2019t understand what the fans were saying, he knew that they were all supportive of him. He could tell from the smiles on their faces.</p><br/><p>The organizer sat down there without any expression. He was cursing Jin Xuan Ming in his heart. If not for his influential powers, he wouldn\u2019t have invited him. How disgusting.</p><br/><p>Angel? Your f*cking mom\u2019s an angel.</p><br/><p>Jin Xuan Ming spoke frankly with assurance and the crowd continued to cheer loudly.</p><br/><p>At the art exhibition center.</p><br/><p>There was an ambulance that came.</p><br/><p>A group of paramedics in white came, they were wearing masks as they pushed a stretcher in.</p><br/><p>The male doctor inside came over and pulled the curtains. \u201cDoctor, come quickly. It\u2019s a pregnant lady. Everyone, please excuse us.\u201d</p><br/><p>The surrounding people started to move aside to let the doctor in.</p><br/><p>They had heard that it was a difficult childbirth and were extremely anxious. They were afraid that something bad might actually happen.</p><br/><p>The pregnant lady was lying down there in pain and was being helped onto the stretcher by the doctors. They rushed her towards the exit.</p><br/><p>One of the women who was helping the lady also rushed behind them. Then, she made a hand gesture at the crowd and only one person understood it. The rest of them didn\u2019t notice it at all.</p><br/><p>The security officers were at a loss and they didn\u2019t know what to do. When they looked at the drawing on the wall, they frowned and realized that it seemed that the artwork was different. Then, they gasped.</p><br/><p>\u201cStop them! They stole the artwork.\u201d</p><br/><p>The pregnant lady and the others were stunned and their expressions changed. They hadn\u2019t expected to be found out.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey!\u201d</p><br/><p>A man standing at the lift shouted loudly and everyone looked towards that direction. The man was holding a grenade and he immediately threw it into the building.</p><br/><p>The crowd was stunned speechless when they saw the grenade.</p><br/><p>Then, there was an uproar.</p><br/><p>Smoke started to fill the entire room.</p><br/><p>It was messy and chaotic.</p><br/><p>The security officer quickly swept the smoke aside and looked outwards. The ambulance had already driven off. \u201cQuick, cover all the exits. Let\u2019s split up; one group can go to the lift and the other can go to the staircase. We have to find that man.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay!\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, he ran to the private room to report the situation.</p><br/><p>It was going to be a major incident.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

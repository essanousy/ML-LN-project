Every single thing seemed fresh and new to her.</p><br/><p>But because of her legs, she could not be like the other children who were able to go wherever they wanted. She always needed someone to help her.</p><br/><p>However, she had a joyful heart and she loved everything that she had right now because she had many friends.</p><br/><p>In particular, the welfare institute\u2019s Director, Uncle Han, and all the teachers really loved them. This made her feel very fortunate.</p><br/><p>Although Uncle Lin wasn\u2019t always with them, the children of the welfare institute all knew that Uncle Lin was earning money outside to buy good food for them and to let them live comfortable lives.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Mei Mei, do you want to be able to run?\u201d Lin Fan squatted down and patted this little girl\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>This was the little girl that Lil\u2019 Fatty liked the most. Thinking about how Lil\u2019 Fatty would push the wheelchair around every day to bring Little Mei Mei to the various places in the welfare institute, Lin Fan realized that Lil\u2019 Fatty was quite gifted. He was a pretty good little boy.</p><br/><p>\u201cRun?\u201d Little Mei Mei was a little excited but then, she looked at her legs. \u201cUncle Lin, will I really be able to run?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Lin Fan smiled. \u201cWith Uncle Lin around, how could anything be impossible?\u201d</p><br/><p>He had to implant a glorious image of himself into the hearts of these children.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan had actually always been waiting for the Encyclopedia to give him a class of knowledge that could be of help to these disabled children.</p><br/><p>Now, it had become a reality and it was great. The Encyclopedia was pretty awesome after all.</p><br/><p>Now, the research lab was done and the product had been developed as well.</p><br/><p>Of course, Lin Fan couldn\u2019t only think about the welfare institute. After all, there were lots and lots of disabled people outside who had lost all hope because of their physical disabilities. There were some who were able to maintain a positive outlook.</p><br/><p>However, if they could have perfect artificial limbs to replace their missing limbs, why not?</p><br/><p>They would be able to climb mountains, run, and even swim. It was such an exciting thing.</p><br/><p>\u201cUncle Lin, l do want that,\u201d said Little Mei Mei loudly.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, wait a moment.\u201d Lin Fan smiled as he quickly brought a pair of perfect artificial limbs over. These artificial limbs had automatic sensors. They could adjust and would change according to the growth of the user. They wouldn\u2019t have to be changed throughout the user\u2019s lifetime.</p><br/><p>Unless they were to break, they wouldn\u2019t have to be replaced. They would follow the user for life.</p><br/><p>The materials used were the best. Moreover, these materials were not expensive. The most expensive thing was the core technology.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan brought the artificial limbs over and started to attach them. The limbs possessed nerve sensors and they were able to respond according to messages sent by the brain.</p><br/><p>At the same time, they would send nervous feedback.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan didn\u2019t understand all this but he understood the theory behind it. This was why the Encyclopedia was so terrifying.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome. Try and move.\u201d Lin Fan helped Little Mei Mei up from the wheelchair, then supported her. \u201cCan you feel it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUncle Lin, let me try.\u201d This was Little Mei Mei\u2019s first time standing on the ground but the perfect artificial limbs didn\u2019t move momentarily. However, with Little Mei Mei\u2019s persistent effort, they slowly started to move. Although she wasn\u2019t very used to it, it proved that this product was a success.</p><br/><p>\u201cUncle Lin, I can move!\u201d Little Mei Mei exclaimed excitedly.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was all smiles. He felt an indescribable joy. \u201cDon\u2019t be in too much of a hurry, Little Mei Mei. With some effort, these will become like your very own legs. In the future, you\u2019ll be able to run around like your friends and you\u2019ll be able to go wherever you want.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d Little Mei Mei lowered her head and looked at the ground. She was a little nervous and a little afraid. But she would press on.</p><br/><p>Time passed, minute by minute and second by second.</p><br/><p>Outside.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang shifted anxiously. He had no idea what was going on inside.</p><br/><p>Initially, he hadn\u2019t cared much about this. But when the experiment started today, he suddenly became nervous.</p><br/><p>His fists were tightly clenched as he mumbled to himself.</p><br/><p>\u201cSucceed. This has to succeed.\u201d</p><br/><p>The secretary stood at the side, a little nervous as well. She hoped that Master Lin would be able to create a miracle but she didn\u2019t know if it was possible. The answer to that was behind that tightly shut door.</p><br/><p>At that moment, the door opened.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang immediately lifted his head and saw Lin Fan standing there.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother, how did it go?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was expressionless and he didn\u2019t reply. He looked as if it had failed.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang had been all smiles at first but when he saw this expression from Lin Fan, his excitement slowly faded away. Then, he patted Lin Fan\u2019s shoulder and gave a consoling smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother, it\u2019s fine. If it failed, so be it. Who hasn\u2019t failed before in their lives? Come, let\u2019s go and drink. No matter what they do, we don\u2019t have to care about all that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Since his brother had failed, he was thinking about the situation on the Internet. He thought about how they would resolve it. Perhaps his brother would have to say something on Weibo in order to defend himself against the criticism.</p><br/><p>But other people might not even accept that. Still, they would have to suppress the situation no matter what.</p><br/><p>\u201cUncle Lin, I can run! Uncle Lin\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, a little girl came over and tugged Lin Fan\u2019s sleeve excitedly.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang lowered his head and looked at that little girl who was drenched in sweat from running around. <em>Isn\u2019t this the girl we brought here just now? But look at her now\u2026</em></p><br/><p>\u201cThis\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan patted Wang Ming Yang\u2019s shoulder and smiled. \u201cBrother, what were you talking about?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck\u201d!\u201d Wang Ming Yang didn\u2019t care who was around and just burst out cursing. \u201cBrother, are you trying to scare me to death? Have you really succeeded?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan didn\u2019t bother about Wang Ming Yang but patted Little Mei Mei\u2019s head instead. \u201cLet\u2019s walk back to the welfare institute later, okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Little Mei Mei nodded with excitement. \u201cI can run. I can run with Lil\u2019 Fatty from now on!\u201d</p><br/><p>When the secretary, who was beside Wang Ming Yang, saw this, she was completely dumbfounded as well.</p><br/><p>To her, this was too surreal.</p><br/><p>She had felt sorry for this little girl initially. The little girl had lost her legs at such a young age. But looking at her now, it was too f*cking mystical. It was beyond scary.</p><br/><p>Moreover, looking at the situation, these perfect artificial limbs seemed exactly like real legs. There didn\u2019t seem to be any difficulty when the little girl ran. She looked very agile.</p><br/><p><em>This\u2026this\u2026</em></p></div>\n</div>"}

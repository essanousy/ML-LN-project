Just at this moment, pages of news appeared in their field of vision.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe exposure of the dirty dealings from the \u2018Heavenly Male Voice\u2019 two years go \u2013 Champion Yang Jie personally admits the origins of the dirty dealings.</p><br/><p>Some others immediately took out their phones.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey! Did you see the news? There\u2019s a big news online. The dirty dealings of the Ying Jin have been exposed!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it real or fake?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy would I lie to you? Hurry up and read the news!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay. I\u2019ll go and read it immediately.\u201d</p><br/><p>If there was conclusive evidence for this matter, that\u2019ll be the end of Ying Jin. Even though Ying Jin was frequently flamed online, but those were just small matters. It was just another method of doing things, to make the netizens unhappy.</p><br/><p>However, if the evidence were conclusive regarding the dirty dealings, then it\u2019ll be completely different.</p><br/><p>This could potentially destroy someone.</p><br/><p>Ying Jin practically doesn\u2019t even release any songs these days. She had been a mentor the past few years and was gaining popularity. However, if the dirty dealings had caused the contestant to bear the responsibility, then it would be absolutely unforgivable.</p><br/><p>The netizens could just drown Ying Jin if they all said their two cents.</p><br/><p>The entertainment reporter reported: \u201cA few days ago, a reporter interviewed Yang Jie, the winner of the \u2018Heavenly Male Voice\u2019 two years ago. He admitted that there were some dirty dealings involved with him winning the competition. At the same time, he admitted that the song wasn\u2019t written by him, nor was it by Ying Jin, but rather it was the work of Chen Rui An.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAs for why Ying Jin was involved with the dirty dealings, the persons involved confessed that he had given five million to Ying Jin. Right now, the involved personnel has announced this matter also because of the news online regarding Chen Rui An. His conscience wasn\u2019t clear and hence he announced the matter to clear things up for Chen Rui An. From everyone here, we would like to apologize to Chen Rui An on behalf of Yang Jie. We hope that we would be able to receive your forgiveness.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck! There are indeed dirty dealings! The evidence is out.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYing Jin you treacherous b*stard. How dare you get involved with such dirty tricks. You even dare to turn your back and sabotage others, causing them to bear the responsibility for over two years.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDespicable. Just too despicable. Is she even human?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAs it turns out, Master Lin was speaking the truth. As I\u2019ve already f*cking said before, Master Lin is a person of justice. There definitely isn\u2019t any problem with whatever he says. Where are all those fools that were backing Ying Jin now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s not talk about it anymore. Let\u2019s go and flame Ying Jin on her Weibo right now till she quits the music industry. Just like I said, the reason why there aren\u2019t any nice songs released recently is because of the existence of treacherous b*stards like Ying Jin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was still sleeping at home but was woken up by a call.</p><br/><p>He originally did not want to pick up the call, but he saw that it was from Wu You Lan. He reluctantly picked up the call.</p><br/><p>The moment he picked up the call, he could hear the excitement of Wu You Lan.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Lin, hurry up and look at the news! Ying Jing\u2019s luck has run out! The truth is out!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s regarding the dirty dealings that Ying Jin was involved in two years ago. Right now, a reporter has revealed the truth. Moreover, the person involved confessed on his own accord!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan jerked. He immediately got out of bed. He didn\u2019t expect the news to come out. But how was this possible?</p><br/><p>That b*stard had come to find him once. The first thing he asked for was ten million. Which fool would fork out ten million? Are they buying the news?</p><br/><p>However, that can\u2019t be it. There probably isn\u2019t anyone that foolish.</p><br/><p>Then what could it be?</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t think too much about it but went ahead to read the news. He briefly laughed the moment he read it.</p><br/><p>\u201cYing Jin you meddling woman. You are really unlucky,\u201d Lin Fan laughed. He laughed very happily. Using brute force to keep Ying Jin in order. He could still express his resentment for her, but he would feel a lot more refreshed if he could affect her reputation.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Lin Fan took out his phone and gave Ying Jin a call.</p><br/><p>Even though both of them were having a feud, Lin Fan was still glad to be able to inform the other party.</p><br/><p>The call got through.</p><br/><p>Ying Jin didn\u2019t say anything, but Lin Fan just couldn\u2019t wait to open his mouth, \u201cTeacher Ying, congratulations! You\u2019ve made it on the leading story! What are your thoughts?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re f*cking despicable.\u201d Ying Jin said furiously.</p><br/><p>*Beep Beep*</p><br/><p>She cut the call immediately after saying that.</p><br/><p>However, Lin Fan wasn\u2019t the slightest bit angry. He\u2019ll just let Ying Jin worry about the things to come. His responsibilities have not come to an end yet. He opened Weibo and sent out a post.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan: I never expected you to be such a person @YingJin</p><br/><p>The instant the Weibo was sent, it attracted the attention of many netizens</p><br/><p>More and more people learned of the news.</p><br/><p>Weibo started to buzz with activity. To others, this was a big news, hearing about the honest Ying Jin meddling with dirty dealings. Moreover, there was even evidence. She wouldn\u2019t be able to clear her name no matter how hard she tried.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin is formidable. What he said was true! With such an excuse, only a fool would be bluffed. How could Chen Rui An be such a fool?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe need to get Ying Jin out of the music industry.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExactly! There\u2019s always Ying Jin this meddling woman in every singing show. I can\u2019t watch it anymore even if I wanted to.\u201d</p><br/><p>In a hotel.</p><br/><p>Chen Rui An just woke up when he received a call from one of his friends. When he heard what just happened, he immediately looked at the news. The moment he saw it, tears started forming in his eyes, and soon, he started bawling.</p><br/><p>He felt that the burden he had been carrying around for two years was finally gone!</p><br/><p>Father Chen and Mother Chen were also relieved. It was their wish to see their son be able to walk out of the dark once again.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Ying Jin looked at the news, then looked at the discussion once again. Her expression was extremely ugly.</p><br/><p>However, this time, she did not smash anything to the ground. All she did was sit in fear on her sofa, not saying a single word.</p><br/><p>Her manager stood beside her, shivering. She didn\u2019t dare to say anything at all as she was terrified. She knew that Sister Ying was extremely furious, and it wasn\u2019t the ordinary kind of fury.</p><br/><p>Whoever touched her would be very unlucky.</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to know why this is so.\u201d Ying Jin asked coldly.</p><br/><p>Her manager cleared her throat. She didn\u2019t know what to say. She herself didn\u2019t know why it turned out like this.</p><br/><p>Moreover, didn\u2019t she herself say confidently that the other party wouldn\u2019t reveal anything to the reporters?</p><br/><p>However, after just a few days, the news was already out.</p><br/><p>*Ring ring*</p><br/><p>Her manager picked up the phone. Her expression became weirder and weirder, and finally, she put down the call.</p><br/><p>\u201cSister Ying, we\u2019ve checked it through. The entertainment reporter said that they bought it from him!\u201d her manager said.</p><br/><p>Ying Jin looked at her manager, \u201cTen million? Or is it twenty million? Is any new regarding me not worth anything? Doesn\u2019t everybody want to catch me for my bad points?\u201d</p><br/><p>Her manager lowered her head, and said softly, \u201cNo. They said that some of them only had to spend three hundred thousand. The least they spend was fifty\u2026 thousand.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck you! What\u2019s the use of having you around?\u201d Ying Jin started going as crazy as a mother lion. She stood up and gave her manager one tight slap.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou said three hundred thousand? Is my life only worth three hundred thousand?\u201d Tell me! Tell me\u2026\u201d Ying Jin shouted insanely.</p><br/><p>Her manager fell to the ground. She didn\u2019t dare say a word. \u201cSister\u2026Sister Ying. We should be trying to think of a plan now. That\u2019s right. We can spend money to get that b*stard to take back his words. We can say we got framed!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ying Jin kicked her manager, \u201cDo you think everybody is as dumb as you?\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, Ying Jin got a call.</p><br/><p>Zhao Li didn\u2019t feel at ease just sitting around. When she saw the news, she was shocked till her face turned white. She didn\u2019t think twice and immediately called Ying Jin.</p><br/><p>\u201cSister Ying! Something has happened! What should we do? We have been exposed! You forced me to do this! It\u2019s none of my business!\u201d Zhao Li was extremely nervous.</p><br/><p>At this moment, the only thing she could think of was to push the blame away from herself.</p><br/><p>Ying Jin replied, \u201cI forced you to do it? When you received the money that time, why didn\u2019t you say that I forced you to take it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Li said, \u201cI\u2026I\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get so nervous. Listen carefully. No matter what the reporters ask you, don\u2019t answer them. Let me handle this.\u201d Ying Jin said. She actually didn\u2019t have any plan. However, Zhao Li was worthless. When she\u2019s met with such situations, she would get all nervous. If she didn\u2019t warn her in advance, who knew what she would say.</p><br/><p>Ying Jin was having a huge headache facing such big problems. She finally picked up her phone and called Yang Jie.</p><br/><p>Only\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cThe number you have dialed is currently unavailable\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>*slam*</p><br/><p>The flower pots in front of her were all completely smashed.</p></div>\n</div>"}

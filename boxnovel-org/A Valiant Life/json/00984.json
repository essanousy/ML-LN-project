This was the first time that he had been reprimanded by someone and the worst part was that it was a young man.</p><br/><p>However, after thinking about the other party\u2019s position, he thought that he should just forget it and just bear with it. He did not want to bring himself down to the level of this young man.</p><br/><p><em>Since you insist on doing things your way, then I shall let it be. However, we\u2019ll see how you handle things when this situation gets out of hand.</em></p><br/><p>After Lin Fan had finished making that phone call, he was afraid that other people would come and meddle with this issue as well. Thus, he went on Weibo and made a post.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe reforms in the association are absolutely necessary. I request that all of you dishonest people don\u2019t stick your hands into this issue. This Chairman will fight with you to the death. Don\u2019t say that I didn\u2019t warn you. Also, I request that some of the members correct your attitude. Since you are already retired, just enjoy your old age at home. Other people may pamper you, but this Chairman won\u2019t.\u201d</p><br/><p>When this post was made, everyone was thrown into shock.</p><br/><p>The netizens.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, Master Lin is such a tyrant. He\u2019s saying some really nasty stuff.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho is he referring to? Did all those people not feel the pressure from him already?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. That\u2019s how it should be. Those people tried to interfere in with Master Lin\u2019s issue from behind the scenes. However, unfortunately for them, Master Lin is not so kind with his words.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m a doctor from a village. After seeing Master Lin\u2019s post, I\u2019ve already registered for the test and have started preparing for it to get into the Chinese Medical Association.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSame here. I wanted to join the Chinese Medical Association in the past but did not get recommended by anyone so I was not able to get in.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI think that Master Lin\u2019s approach is very good. If you want to get into the Chinese Medical Association, you have to prove yourself. That\u2019s very fair.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan\u2019s reform was something that was beneficial to a lot of these frontline doctors. In the past, if you wanted to join the association, it was not enough to sign up for it. You had to have someone inside recommend you. All these ordinary Chinese doctors definitely would not have such connections. As a result, they had not had the chance to join the association. But right now, it was different. There was no other prerequisite, all they had to do was sign up and through an exam, they would be able to join the Chinese Medical Association. This was a very good system.</p><br/><p>It was something very welcomed by those basic level Chinese doctors.</p><br/><p>When he was on the way back to Cloud Street from Nanshan Children\u2019s Welfare Institute, he received a phone call from the people from the National Internet Safety Bureau.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, the website has been set up. This is something that our people tirelessly worked through day and night to complete. Although I can\u2019t guarantee that it will be super awesome, it definitely is good.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was very grateful for these IT people from the National Internet Safety Bureau. \u201cThank you. The next time you come over to Shanghai, I\u2019ll treat you guys to a meal.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, Master Lin, the chance to have a meal with you is enough. Next time, when we have the chance, we have to learn more from you. Please do teach us some stuff as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed \u201cRelax, that will definitely not be a problem. As long as you guys are willing to learn, I will definitely teach you guys.\u201d</p><br/><p>After hanging up the phone, he made another phone call to Wang Tian Feng.</p><br/><p>He wanted him to take note of the new official website. Since this was a new system, it required someone to take care of it. At the same time, he wanted to backup all the original data and then completely delete the old website it.</p><br/><p>Also, the new system was not bad. They could upload the profiles of all the association members which made it convenient for the other people to check it. At the same time, other people could also report the members if they needed to.</p><br/><p>If there was an association member that made a speech or statement outside, other people could use this system to report them behind the scenes. Then, the association would be able to conduct an investigation and see if it was multi-level marketing or some kind of scam.</p><br/><p>Right now, many of the members were just standing around and watching how the situation would develop. However, when some of the members saw that the official website had completely changed, they were dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>Initially, all their information had been stored there, all their titles and their ranks. However, right now, it had all disappeared.</p><br/><p>This made the association members a little panicky.</p><br/><p>Before, all their personal profiles had been easily accessible and a lot of people just added on to their profiles as they wished, making themselves look very good. However, there was nothing left of that right now. Could it be that they had to start all over again?</p><br/><p>However, there were still a lot of the members that felt that this reform was good.</p><br/><p>They were very sincere and invested in Chinese medicine and did not partake in any of those dishonest practices. Also, they felt like those people who just added on titles to their profile as they wished to make themselves look good were extremely shameful.</p><br/><p>However, by now, the atmosphere of the association had already changed. If you did not join in and take part in these dishonest practices, you would not be able to assimilate into the community and they would even try to push you out.</p><br/><p>Whenever the association had some meetings where they would come together and chit chat as well as discuss their lives, those people who could not assimilate into the community would not come at all.</p><br/><p>The people there were all part of their own community.</p><br/><p>In the past, Zhou Qing Quan had wanted to change this situation. However, making any sort of change was very hard. The problem had already built up to such a huge extent that any sort of attempt to fix it would require an astronomical amount of effort.</p><br/><p>Given the situation of the association in the past, it was something that had been way too difficult.</p><br/><p>Also, he had not had the energy to do it.</p><br/><p>But right now, it was different. Master Lin had taken over the office and he was swift and decisive. He was extremely ferocious with his actions.</p><br/><p>The more senior people in the association were dumbfounded. Initially, they had thought that they could use their rank and power to make the newly appointed Chairman back out of the reform. However, they had never thought that the other party simply did not care about their feelings at all and would just immediately suppress them.</p><br/><p>This was really something that stunned them.</p><br/><p>The next day.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was in the middle of a dream when suddenly he was awoken by his phone.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happened? Who\u2019s causing trouble now?\u201d Lin Fan was very suspicious inside, not knowing who it could be. When he saw that the phone call was from Zhou Qing Quan, he felt very annoyed.</p><br/><p><em>Is it really that hard to handle this situation? It seems that there must be some other problem that he cannot solve.</em></p><br/><p>After answering the phone.</p><br/><p>Zhou Qing Quan\u2019s voice was very urgent as he spoke over the phone, \u201cChairman Lin, you should quickly check your Weibo. Zhang Guo Shou has made a post which has caused a huge stir. It doesn\u2019t look good for us.\u201d</p><br/><p>After hearing that Zhang Guo Shou was up to some other stuff, he did not want to say anything.</p><br/><p>He opened up his Weibo to take a look.</p><br/><p>On Zhang Guo Shou\u2019s Weibo, there were pictures posted of him being bedridden and looking extremely frail. Also, these posts had been made by his son. The intention of these posts was very obvious.</p><br/><p>It was to show that his father was so angered by what had happened in the association that he had fallen sick. At the same time, there were also some pictures from the past, showing the situation of association when he had first entered it.</p><br/><p>At that time, the Chinese Medical Association had still not been very huge. The previous generation had put in a lot of effort for the association to get it to where it was right now. However, the things that had happened these few days hurt them a lot.</p><br/><p>He had written a huge chunk of text meant to play on the emotions of the people. It was very easy to play on the feelings of the netizens and to make them feel pity and sympathy.</p><br/><p>Sure enough, when these posts were made, some netizens could not hold themselves back.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, after looking at this, I suddenly feel like Master Lin has gone too far. He has not even thought about the previous generation. I can\u2019t take this anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. Mister Zhang Guo Shou has given his life to the association. I never thought that he would be completely ignored once he got old.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is suppressing the older generation who have done so much. I hope that Master Lin will change his decision.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis sh*tty Master Lin. I think he is such a vile character. To be handed a position of power and yet not care about what other people think is disgusting.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c^ you shouldn\u2019t say things like that. Master Lin\u2019s actions are for the benefit of the association. It\u2019s just that he needs to calm down a little.\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

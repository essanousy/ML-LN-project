He still had some time to get something to eat.</p><br/><p>At that moment, a call from Zheng Zhong Shan came.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello, Elder Zheng,\u201d said Lin Fan as he answered the call.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zheng Zhong Shan was not too happy. \u201cElder Lin, you came to Beijing but didn\u2019t come and visit your old friends?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled and said, \u201cI had something to do. I\u2019m already at the airport now, about to go back.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Lin, this thing you\u2019re talking about, it\u2019s beating people up, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan heard that, he started laughing giddily. \u201cElder Zheng, I can\u2019t agree with that. What do you mean by that? I came here to reason with them. And they were pretty good too. They understood the situation and the matter was easily resolved.\u201d</p><br/><p>If President Chen had heard these words, he would definitely be cursing maniacally. You call <em>this reasoning? You were just using violence to resolve the matter!</em></p><br/><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you stay longer? I\u2019ll get my wife to prepare dinner for us and we can have a few drinks,\u201d Zheng Zhong Shan asked. He wanted to reminisce the old times with Lin Fan. At the same time, he wanted to get Lin Fan drunk and prepare a brush and a canvas for him to create a masterpiece.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cI can\u2019t do that. I\u2019ve already promised my friends that I would hurry back tonight. The next time I come to Beijing, I will definitely visit you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, then we\u2019ll agree on that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMmm. Let\u2019s agree on that.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two of them chatted for a while more before hanging up.</p><br/><p>Just as they hung up, Lin Fan stopped in his tracks. There was a group of young ladies gathered in front. Each of them was holding a brightly-colored red rose and a sign. There was a certain name on those signs.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan took a glance. He knew that it was a popular celebrity but he had not seen much of that celebrity\u2019s works and he had no idea how that celebrity had suddenly become popular.</p><br/><p>However, after some thought, he recalled. That celebrity had participated in some kind of variety show and because he was too handsome and he knew how to show off, he gained a lot of fans.</p><br/><p>Regarding this kind of matter, Lin Fan didn\u2019t really care. He was about to go and get something to eat but then, he stopped in his tracks again.</p><br/><p>On the other side, there were two men and a lady, holding a sign as if they were waiting for someone.</p><br/><p>Written on the sign was \u2018Scholar Ma\u2019.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan went forward curiously and inquired, \u201cHello, what does this Scholar Ma do?\u201d</p><br/><p>The three of them looked at Lin Fan curiously. Then, one of them seemed to realize something. He asked softly, \u201cAre you Master Lin?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d Lin Fan nodded.</p><br/><p>They recognized Master Lin but they didn\u2019t dare to confirm it. Due to the nature of their work, they seldom watched the news. However, they still had a certain understanding of Master Lin.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo it really is Master Lin. Master Lin, I really worship you. You brought fortune to the masses by conquering those diseases,\u201d said one of the men excitedly. According to their introduction, this man had the surname \u2018Cui\u2019.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled and said, \u201cAre you here to receive someone?\u201d</p><br/><p>The man with the surname Cui nodded. \u201cYeah. Our Scholar Ma is coming back from a conference overseas, so we\u2019re here to welcome him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, he explained everything about who Scholar Ma was.</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan heard it, he was slightly taken aback. He hadn\u2019t expected that Scholar Ma was a big shot. And he was a big shot who had contributed a lot. Moreover, the things that he researched had tremendous benefits to the country and to the masses.</p><br/><p>This time, his research had succeeded and he had gone overseas to engage in an exchange.</p><br/><p>This kind of person was coming back with such tremendous success but there were only three people welcoming him back. It seemed very miserable. Then, looking at those fans who were waiting for the celebrity to come, it was simply incomparable.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan glanced at those fans on the other side, then took out his phone and made a Weibo post. \u201cSigh. I\u2019m at the Beijing airport now. My idol is about to come out but there are way too few people here. Are there any Internet buddies who can come and help to liven up the atmosphere?\u201d</p><br/><p>When this post was sent, countless netizens entered the discussion.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn. Master Lin is at the airport now? I\u2019m here too! Please give me your location!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck. I live in Beijing and I\u2019ve never seen Master Lin in person before. I\u2019m going to charge over there right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin\u2019s idol? D*mn! But this isn\u2019t right. It seems that the only celebrity who will appear at the Beijing airport today is Han Jun.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn. Master Lin\u2019s idol couldn\u2019t be that sissy Han Jun, could it? If that\u2019s the case, I won\u2019t be able to take it. I\u2019ll even want to stop being a fan.\u201d</p><br/><p>^Your brain must have short-circuited. How could such trash be Master Lin\u2019s idol?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTrash? What has my Han Jun done to offend you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCheh. I\u2019m going to look for Master Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>Very soon, the already crowded airport became even more crowded.</p><br/><p>People came from all directions and even a whole group had come.</p><br/><p>Han Jun\u2019s fans were all discussing amongst themselves. But when they saw a group of people coming, they were delighted. \u201cLook. So many people have come. Could they be our fellow Jun fans?\u201d</p><br/><p>The young men and ladies looked over and were elated. \u201cThey must be. I didn\u2019t think that our Jun Jun had so many fans. There are even thirty and forty-year-olds. I didn\u2019t think our Jun Jun was so attractive that even these uncles and aunties are drawn in.\u201d</p><br/><p>But before long, this group of people had charged into the distance.</p><br/><p>Han Jun\u2019s fans shouted, \u201cYou\u2019re going the wrong way. We\u2019re Jun Jun\u2019s welcome group.\u201d</p><br/><p>In the group, a middle-aged man turned his head and muttered.</p><br/><p>\u201cRetards.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan and those three comrades from the Chinese Academy of Sciences were chatting. They talked about some rather serious topics.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, a series of voices came from afar. A middle-aged man had his hands raised up high and his face was filled with excitement. He had been a leukemia sufferer in the past but thanks to Master Lin conquering leukemia, he had regained his health. To him, Master Lin had given him a second life to be with his family.</p><br/><p>Thereafter, he had become one of Lin Fan\u2019s fans.</p><br/><p>When he had seen Master Lin requesting support on Weibo, he hadn\u2019t even had to consider before he rushed over.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved. \u201cOver here. I\u2019m over here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, when some of Han Jun\u2019s fans heard \u2018Master Lin\u2019, they seemed thrilled as well. \u201cD*mn. It\u2019s Master Lin. I have to go and take a look.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, we\u2019re here to welcome Jun Jun back. What are you going there for?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m going over to Master Lin\u2019s side. We\u2019ll see about Han Jun later. We get to see him every day, so there\u2019s no need to worry about this one time.\u201d</p><br/><p>A young lady growled furiously, \u201cAre you still a Jun fan?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJun fan my a*s. My real identity is a Fan fan. Compared to Master Lin, that Han Jun is nothing. I\u2019m going.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, most of the people in the Han Jun fan group started whispering amongst themselves.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Master Lin. I\u2019ve always followed him on Weibo. He\u2019s a super incredible person.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, me too. I worship Master Lin to death. I have to go and take a look.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go. Let\u2019s not receive Han Jun for now. We see him frequently anyway, so it doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, the number of people who were there to receive Han Jun had decreased by half. And there were some people beginning to stir as well.</p><br/><p>Because Master Lin had gone on all sorts of headlines for all kinds of mystical incidents. They had all been shocked by him.</p></div>\n</div>"}

He stuck out his hand and said, \u201cAlright, you may continue with your performance. Don\u2019t be nervous and don\u2019t be affected by this. No matter what the truth was, you just have to do your best right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>These words were like a tranquilizer, calming Chen Rui An down. Then, with red eyes, he bowed towards Lin Fan. \u201cThank you, Teacher Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Ying Dong had been silent the whole time. Now, he understood how great Lin Fan was at talking. He could even change something from black to white using his words.</p><br/><p>Zhao Li was completely asking for trouble. Moreover, she could not say anything more. Otherwise, she would really be proving herself to be petty.</p><br/><p>Backstage.</p><br/><p>The Deputy Director was applauding ecstatically. \u201cGood! This episode is probably going to be even more terrific!\u201d</p><br/><p>If this had been the previous day, the Deputy Director would have been frightened to death. However, the previous day\u2019s incident hadn\u2019t had any negative effects on the show and it had even caused the show to become even more popular. Now that something had occurred right at the start of the show once again, it meant that the ratings were going to be very high again, right?</p><br/><p>However, he was contemplating about something. Should the show\u2019s name be changed?</p><br/><p>It shouldn\u2019t be called \u2018Strongest Heavenly Voice\u2019. Rather, \u2018Strongest B*tch Fight\u2019 sounded more appropriate.</p><br/><p>On the Internet.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha. This Zhao Li woman has gotten flamed by Master Lin once again.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough he made a mistake in the past, it has already been two years. They should give him an opportunity to start over.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. He\u2019s still so young too. If she keeps holding it against him, she would really be too petty.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you guys notice what Master Lin said just now? \u2018No matter what the truth was. Doesn\u2019t that mean that there is something more to this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c^Are you a detective? How can you infer from something like that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat might be true. You guys don\u2019t know what kind of person Master Lin is. There might really be some kind of hidden truth behind this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Everyone became excited. They realized that this show was really meaningful. It was much more meaningful than any other variety show.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at Chen An Rui\u2019s emotions brewing as he stood on stage and Lin Fan did not rush him. He just silently waited.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Chen Rui An opened his eyes and calmed his emotions. \u201cAlright, I can begin now. Let me present to everyone \u2018Clear Skies After Rain\u2019.\u201d</p><br/><p>The accompaniment started to play.</p><br/><p>This song wasn\u2019t too old. It was quite popular. But when the accompaniment started playing, everyone was surprised. This accompaniment seemed to have been modified.</p><br/><p>Could it be\u2026</p><br/><p>Everyone listened attentively. They were trying to confirm something.</p><br/><p>Chen Rui An slowly closed his eyes and opened his mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter the rain ends, the clear skies come\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The style of his singing was completely different from the original. The crowd was completely drawn in by his voice.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded as his fingers tapped on his palm. His voice was very good. The emotions were on point and the pitch was great.</p><br/><p>Zhao Li\u2019s expression turned ugly. No matter how good the singing was, she didn\u2019t want to listen, nor would she turn on her light for him.</p><br/><p>What happened just now had already made her furious.</p><br/><p>Everyone was immersed in his voice as Chen Rui An tried his best to put on his best voice for everyone to hear.</p><br/><p>Backstage, Chen Rui An\u2019s parents looked at their son and were so moved that they were crying. They had finally witnessed their son walking out from the shadow of his past.</p><br/><p>This was the son that they wanted to see the most.</p><br/><p>And on this day, it had all become a reality.</p><br/><p>The song ended.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan pressed the button and his light lit up.</p><br/><p>Hao Jian Yang didn\u2019t let go of this chance either. His light lit up too. This voice, to him, was brilliant. Chen Rui An\u2019s natural tune was very unique.</p><br/><p>If one wanted to walk down the path of singing, it was best to have a unique voice, because no one would be able to replicate it.</p><br/><p>Liu Ying Dong also flashed his light in the end. He didn\u2019t want people to call him petty.</p><br/><p>In the end, only Zhao Li\u2019s light didn\u2019t light up.</p><br/><p>The audience applauded.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt sounds so good. It\u2019s really great.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI never thought that this contestant would be so strong. He doesn\u2019t seem like someone who would steal someone else\u2019s song at all.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Rui An opened his eyes. He had an emotional expression on his face. Then, he bowed towards the crowd. He had not expected that he would still have the opportunity to sing on stage. This made him very happy and very excited.</p><br/><p>The host went back on stage with a beaming face. After hearing that voice, he didn\u2019t quite believe that that young man would steal someone\u2019s song.</p><br/><p>\u201cCongratulations, Chen Rui An. Three mentors have flashed their lights for you. For the three mentors, you guys can fight over your desired contestant,\u201d said Cui Wei.</p><br/><p>Hao Jian Yang smiled, \u201cI flashed my light because he sang very well and I\u2019m very pleased but I know that this kid will definitely want to join Master Lin. Hence, I shan\u2019t fight over him. I\u2019ll let Master Lin break his record of zero and obtain a great member.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Ying Dong said, \u201cI feel the same as Teacher Jian. There\u2019s no need to fight over him.\u201d</p><br/><p>The host, Cui An, smiled, \u201cThen which mentor would you like to join?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Rui An said emotionally, \u201cI choose Teacher Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan stood up and applauded. \u201cYour voice is very good. Among all the male voices that I\u2019ve heard, your uniqueness is a few levels higher than theirs.\u201d</p><br/><p>Receiving such praise from Master Lin, Chen Rui An said gratefully, \u201cThank you, Teacher Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>The host nodded, \u201cAlright, let\u2019s invite the next contestant.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWait a moment,\u201d said Lin Fan, \u201cDon\u2019t carry on yet. I still have something I want to say.\u201d</p><br/><p>The audience was stunned. Then, each of them let out expressions of anticipation. To them, it seemed like something major was about to happen.</p><br/><p>With Master Lin\u2019s awesome personality, if nothing happened, the audience would be willing to broadcast videos of themselves eating sh*t.</p><br/><p>Chen Rui An looked at Lin Fan with a puzzled expression. \u201cWhat is it, Teacher Lin?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan glanced at Chen Rui An and nodded, \u201cYour appearance is delicate and pure. Let me ask you, is there a problem with your brain?\u201d</p><br/><p>When he asked this, the crowd was stunned.</p><br/><p>What the f*ck? What did that mean?</p><br/><p>This turn of events was a little too quick and the crowd could not respond fast enough.</p><br/><p>Chen Rui An was stunned as well. \u201cTeacher Lin, I don\u2019t have a problem.\u201d He was feeling puzzled. Why would Teacher Lin asked him that?</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the audience, \u201cDo you think he looks like someone with a problem with his brain?\u201d</p><br/><p>The audience had no idea what Master Lin was getting at.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think he looks like someone with a problem.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded, \u201cThat\u2019s right. I was thinking about something just now. Since there isn\u2019t a problem with Chen Rui An\u2019s brain, why would he dare to steal a song that has been partly composed by Ying Jin? How retarded must he be to do something like that?\u201d</p><br/><p>When he said that, everyone was stunned. That was true. It didn\u2019t quite make sense.</p><br/><p>If he knew that the song had been through Ying Jin\u2019s hands, a normal student like him wouldn\u2019t dare to steal it unless he didn\u2019t want his life anymore.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan continued to ask, \u201cChen Rui An, I want to ask you something. That person who said that you stole the song, what position did he end up getting? And where is he now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Rui An said, \u201cHe became the champion of the competition. Now, he has vanished without a trace. He has already left the musical world.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t seem right.\u201d Lin Fan shook his head, \u201cNo matter what, someone who is capable of getting the first place can\u2019t be weak. And that song must have been very good but now, it has also vanished without a trace. According to my guess, there is only one possibility. That person who won the competition was only average. And, that \u2018Heavenly Male Voice\u2019 must have been corrupted.\u201d</p><br/><p>The audience was completely astounded by Master Lin\u2019s speculation.</p><br/><p>How was something like that even possible?</p><br/><p>Chen Rui An became more and more emotional. Then, he opened his mouth and said, \u201cTeacher Lin, actually, that song was composed by me. However, no one believed me. Teacher Ying\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t dare to carry on. Because Ying Jin had a high status in the musical world, he didn\u2019t dare to infuriate her.</p><br/><p>\u201cI believe you,\u201d said Lin Fan without hesitation, \u201cYour fundamentals are very strong. I believe that the song was composed by you. If Ying Jin was the judge, then this problem is easily explained. Ying Jin is not a good person. She involves herself in many shady businesses. She\u2019s an expert in deliberate misrepresentation. A nameless and average person like you against a senior and well-respected person in the musical world. Even if you said the song was yours, no one would believe you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Uproar!</p><br/><p>Everyone was flabbergasted!</p><br/><p>No one had expected Master Lin to say something like this. This was completely and deliberately offending Ying Jin.</p><br/><p>Moreover, he had said all this on a live broadcast. Things had gotten really big.</p><br/><p>Hao Jian Yang\u2019s eyes and mouth gaped wide open. How did he dare to say something like that?</p><br/><p>Zhao Li was utterly flustered. \u201cWhat nonsense are you spouting? I was a judge too. How could we have done something like that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved his hand, \u201cWhy are you so angry, Teacher Zhao? I\u2019m saying that Ying Jin is corrupted. I didn\u2019t even say that you were corrupted. What are you panicking about?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Li said sternly, \u201cWhat proof do you have?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m just speaking the truth.\u201d At that moment, Lin Fan\u2019s face turned grave. His chin lifted slightly and he looked all around as if he was recounting the truth.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Chen Rui An could not hold back his tears.</p><br/><p>Finally, someone believed him.</p><br/><p>Moreover, it was his most-respected Teacher Lin.</p><br/><p>If it was possible, he would definitely cling onto Master Lin\u2019s legs and kneel down to him for the rest of his life.</p><br/><p>Ying Jin had been watching the broadcast. At that moment, she smashed her phone to pieces.</p><br/><p>\u201cLin, I\u2019m going to take your dog life\u2026\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

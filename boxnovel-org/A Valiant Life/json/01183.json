Just +1 for this. I\u2019m going to give it a +1 no matter what.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. Everyone, please support this so that Master Lin can see this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI will repost this and mention Master Lin so that he can see our desire.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, the netizens kept providing support for the post, and there were people reposting and mentioning Master Lin too.</p><br/><p>They really wanted Master Lin to see that. If Master Lin said it was impossible, then they would stop saying anything. After all, it was a difficult disease to cure.</p><br/><p>If Master Lin said he was unable to cure the illness, everyone would not be surprised at all since it was the expected outcome. They would not force or scold Master Lin at all.</p><br/><p>After all, only an idiot would agree to that.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yi Jun looked at the comments on the post and tears started to well up in his eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you. I am sincerely thankful for everyone.\u201d</p><br/><p>He did not expect to have garnered so much support for his post. He just hoped that Master Lin would see it.</p><br/><p>Although he was hated by the community around him, he was not resentful at all because he understood the severity of his daughter\u2019s illness. It was too scary and if he were to put himself in the shoes of others, he would have avoided a person like him too.</p><br/><p>His greatest wish was for Master Lin to reply.</p><br/><p>If Master Lin said the illness was too difficult to treat, he would be disappointed, but he would not bear any grudges.</p><br/><p>At Cloud Street!</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was talking to Zhao Ming Qing on the phone.</p><br/><p>\u201cMing Qing, speak slowly. I know you want to investigate a lot of illnesses. Just take it slow. You literally mentioned four or five illnesses in a second and it\u2019s too much,\u201d Lin Fan chuckled.</p><br/><p>He agreed with what Fraud Tian said about the lack of quality if they were to tackle multiple illnesses at once.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, it was not as simple as curing one specific case of an illness. It had to be targeted at the root cause.</p><br/><p>If he were to use the mystical power of the Encyclopedia along with the special ability of the Wuxia major knowledge classification, he would be able to cure particular cases of illness. However, if he were to target them at their root cause, he had to experiment with the medication in order to come up with the right combination.</p><br/><p>That was not an easy task and he had to keep trying.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing said, \u201cMentor, I was too excited. I have a lot of illnesses that I want to eradicate, but I guess we should take it slow. Do you want to look at the list that I created?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded. \u201cYeah, that would be great. Although it\u2019s a little difficult, I think we should be able to do it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing replied, \u201cMentor, that\u2019s what I thought of too. I studied this for a long time and came up with a lot of sample solutions. However, there\u2019s always something missing. Hence, I need your guidance.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha. Ming Qing, you have improved tremendously. Your capabilities in the past cannot even be compared to what you are now. It\u2019s literally worlds apart. Did you realise that?\u201d</p><br/><p>He realised that his disciple\u2019s ability had been improving greatly ever since he had consumed the perfect-grade little intelligence pill to enhance his mastery of Chinese medicine.</p><br/><p>He had become way better than what he used to be.</p><br/><p>It was just that Zhao Ming Qing probably did not realise that at all.</p><br/><p>The methods and thinking that he had mentioned over the phone were all correct and heading towards the right direction.</p><br/><p>Although he would get stuck sometimes, if he were to receive new knowledge from Master Lin, he would probably be able to master it.</p><br/><p>Perhaps Zhao Ming Qing would soon be able to eradicate illnesses on his own.</p><br/><p>It was just that Lin Fan felt that Zhao Ming Qing\u2019s age was the only problem. If only he could be twenty years younger, things would have been very different.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, go easy on your compliments. I still have a long way to go,\u201d Zhao Ming Qing chuckled.</p><br/><p>It had been a long time since he had executed any plans. He had been focusing on gaining new knowledge, and although he had not gone through any real challenges yet, he was definitely capable of picturing everything in his mind.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cOkay, okay, since you\u2019ve settled on the list, you can select one from it. It\u2019s great that I can help you with it.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two of them chatted for a while longer and they hung up.</p><br/><p>Then, people from the Health Department called again.</p><br/><p>He knew exactly what they were going to say, and hence, he did not pick up the call. He immediately sent a message.</p><br/><p>\u201cPublish the medical papers. Do not call me again.\u201d</p><br/><p>Since he managed to eradicate the illness, he felt that it should be published, and there was no need to hide it from the public.</p><br/><p>He still remembered what had happened earlier, and he did not want to forgive the other party so easily.</p><br/><p>Perhaps he was being a little too petty about it.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, Wu You Lan gasped in disbelief.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cYou Lan, what happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan looked at her phone and rushed over. \u201cBrother Lin, look at this. It\u2019s so pitiful.\u201d</p><br/><p>He was confused, but as he looked at the content in her phone, he was stunned.</p><br/><p>A post on his Weibo page had the support of 2.3 million people and it was crazy.</p><br/><p>Then, he began to read the post as he was curious as to how it managed to garner the support of the huge number of netizens.</p><br/><p>As he continued to read, his expression changed. A four year old girl actually contracted an illness like this.</p><br/><p>Obviously he did not mean that something like this would not happen in society. It was just that he did not think about it at all.</p><br/><p>Today, a netizen wrote a long post about it and the last sentence was really impactful.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease, Master Lin, save my daughter. I will do anything to repay you.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was the plea of a desperate father.</p><br/><p>After reading the post, Lin Fan remained silent.</p><br/><p>If he wanted to cure her illness, it would be easy. However, it was difficult to eradicate it from the world.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, the number of people contracting an illness like this was low, and it was practically over for those that were suffering from it.</p><br/><p>Especially since this little girl\u2019s mother had passed away because of this illness which saddened him a lot.</p><br/><p>If she were still alive, maybe things would be different.</p><br/><p>*tap, tap*</p><br/><p>Lin Fan sat there as he tapped the table with his fingers. Then, he shut his eyes thinking about AIDS.</p><br/><p>It was a horrifying illness, and it was a disease that even doctors were afraid of curing. Doctors were even afraid on operating on those who were suffering from AIDS. After all, it was a dangerous illness that could be easily transmitted.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou Lan, what do you think?\u201d Lin Fan smiled and asked.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan just lowered her head and mumbled, \u201cBrother Lin, I\u2019m afraid\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>She was afraid that Brother Lin would be affected by the illness if he were to try to eradicate it.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled, \u201cWhat\u2019s there to be afraid of? I\u2019ll take it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, the people in the shop just stared at Lin Fan in shock. They did not know what to say at all.</p></div>\n</div>"}

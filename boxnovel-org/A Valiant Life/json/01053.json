He hadn\u2019t expected this call from Autumn Sword Fish Killer. It seemed that thing hadn\u2019t been going that guy\u2019s way.</p><br/><p>If things had been going his way, Lin Fan could guarantee that that guy would definitely not come back to him.</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang raised his head. \u201cBrother Lin, who was that from?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cIt was my Chief of Internet trolls. He got screwed for hacking in computer games, so he wants to start being an Internet troll again.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha,\u201d Zhao Zhong Yang burst into laughter. \u201cI know about this. Recently, it was quite a big deal. There was a huge commotion about it. I didn\u2019t think that he actually got involved too.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, Lin Fan looked over at Wu You Lan. He felt that You Lan\u2019s expression wasn\u2019t quite pleasant. She looked like she was feeling sorry about something.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou Lan, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan placed her phone in front of Lin Fan. \u201cBrother Lin, look at this piece of news. This guy is really pitiful. He\u2019s already fifty but he isn\u2019t married. He has been selling fruits all along to support some less-fortunate students. Now, they\u2019ve discovered that he has a disease and this story has been published on the Internet, asking everyone to donate money to help him. I just donated a thousand dollars.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at that news article and read the content closely. Then, he stared at the image for a while and suddenly stood up.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Lin, where are you going?\u201d asked Wu You Lan.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cI\u2019m going to make a trip to the hospital. There\u2019s something I have to do.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although he hadn\u2019t said it clearly, Wu You Lan suddenly realized what he meant.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s right. If Brother Lin makes a move, he\u2019ll definitely be able to treat this disease.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled. Treating the disease was a part of it. The other reason he was going there was that this man fulfilled the conditions for the task. As of now, the task hadn\u2019t been completed yet. The chance of finding someone on the streets who fulfilled the conditions was too low.</p><br/><p>Moreover, he suddenly realized that Wu You Lan was simply like his lucky star. A lot of times, she would see the news and tell him about such incidents.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait here in the shop. I\u2019ll go out for a bit before coming back. It\u2019s even just in Shanghai. That\u2019s convenient,\u201d said Lin Fan with a grin. Then, he drove off.</p><br/><p>The hospital!</p><br/><p>On the sickbed, Liu Shan was lying down. Through the window, he looked at the scenery outside.</p><br/><p>A nurse walked in. She knew about this patient. His case had even drawn a report from the reporters the previous day. She had heard that he was a good person who had always been single. Besides leaving a bit of money for his day-to-day expenses, he basically donated all of his money to \u2018Project Hope\u2019. Moreover, he had even taken on the responsibility of paying for two university students\u2019 school fees.</p><br/><p>The nurse really didn\u2019t know what to say about such a person. There were a number of people like him in society. He already knew that his financial background wasn\u2019t great. If he kept his money, perhaps he would have been able to have a more comfortable life. Instead, he donated what little money he had to help those university students. She really couldn\u2019t understand that.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow are you? Is there anywhere that feels uncomfortable?\u201d The nurse was over forty as well. She was one of the older nurses in the hospital.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nowhere uncomfortable. Nurse, when can I be discharged?\u201d asked Liu Shan.</p><br/><p>The nurse smiled. \u201cJust wait. The operation hasn\u2019t even been done yet. I think it\u2019ll be at least a month.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe operation fee must be very high. Since I have nothing wrong at the moment, I think I should be discharged first.\u201d Liu Shan thought about it for a moment. Besides the previous pain which had made him faint on the street, he really didn\u2019t feel any major discomfort.</p><br/><p>The nurse hadn\u2019t expected him to still be thinking about the medical fees. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about all this. The reporters already came and they started a donation campaign for you. Our hospital will waive the taxes too. Don\u2019t worry. We won\u2019t make you pay a single cent.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh right. I\u2019m a little curious. You weren\u2019t doing very well previously, why didn\u2019t you leave more money for yourself? You still donated to the students,\u201d the nurse asked. \u201cThere are so many wealthy people in society nowadays. You shouldn\u2019t be the one who has to donate.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Shan chuckled. \u201cThat\u2019s not right of you to say. I don\u2019t care what others do. I understand the disadvantages of not being able to study. Look at me. I didn\u2019t get to study and I can only rely on selling fruits to make a living. Those students have poor family backgrounds. If they don\u2019t study, they\u2019ll end up like me.\u201d</p><br/><p>The nurse looked at Liu Shan and said, \u201cI heard from the reporters that the students you are supporting are studying in Shanghai. Now that you\u2019re sick, why don\u2019t they come and visit you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Shan seemed not to mind it. \u201cWhat\u2019s the point of visiting? Academics are the most important. It\u2019s not like it\u2019s some kind of big disease.\u201d</p><br/><p>The nurse wanted to say that the two students he was supporting were ingrates. However, she didn\u2019t say it. She felt that it would hurt his feelings if she said it.</p><br/><p>*Knock knock!*</p><br/><p>At that moment, a knocking sound could be heard from the door. A young man walked in. this young man looked young and immature. With one look, one could tell that he was a student. \u201cPapa Liu, I\u2019m here to see you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Shan saw him and immediately said, \u201cWang Hao, why are you here? Aren\u2019t you supposed to be attending your class?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Hao was dressed plainly. He was a kid from the mountain area. These few years, he had been able to attend a university thanks to this Papa Liu who had supported him.</p><br/><p>When he heard that Papa Liu had fallen ill, he had rushed here immediately.</p><br/><p>Liu Shan looked at the fruits in Wang Hao\u2019s hands and his expression changed. \u201cWhy did you buy fruits? I\u2019m a fruit seller. What a waste of money.\u201d</p><br/><p>When the nurse saw that a kid had really come to see him, she smiled. \u201cThe kid bought something for you out of goodwill. How can you start berating him?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Hao wasn\u2019t angry at all. It was as if he was really accepting the teachings of a father.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen should I go back and ask for a refund?\u201d Wang Hao was at a loss and he didn\u2019t know what to do.</p><br/><p>Looking at Wang Hao\u2019s expression, Liu Shan couldn\u2019t bring himself to be angry. \u201cAlright, since you\u2019ve already bought it, that\u2019s that. Come here and sit. Don\u2019t you have classes today?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Hao shook his head. \u201cI have no classes today. I saw the news on the Internet, so I came here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, as if he suddenly thought of something, he hurriedly took out an envelope from his pocket. \u201cPapa Liu, this is money donated by my classmates. They told me to bring it to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>The nurse smiled. \u201cThat\u2019s pretty good. It looks like there are many loving people around. Wang Hao, where\u2019s the other kid that your Papa Liu supports?\u201d</p><br/><p>When Wang Hao heard that, he instantly became a little angry and a little helpless at the same time. \u201cI already informed him but he said that he has classes today and he can\u2019t come.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSigh.\u201d When the nurse heard this, she laughed bitterly in her heart. <em>It\u2019s an ingrate after all.</em></p><br/><p>Liu Shan wasn\u2019t bothered by it. \u201cMmm. If he has classes, he should attend them. Studying is more important. If he misses a class, it would probably delay his progress.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Hao didn\u2019t say much. He knew that it wasn\u2019t a valid excuse at all. That person just didn\u2019t want to come.</p><br/><p>*Knock knock*</p><br/><p>\u201cIs Mister Liu Shan around?\u201d At that moment, a voice came from outside the door as everyone was still chatting.</p><br/><p>The nurse said, \u201cHe\u2019s here. Please come in.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was standing at the door. When he heard the reply, he pushed open the door and walked in with a smile.</p></div>\n</div>"}

As the righteous person that I am, I can\u2019t just sit idly by. Hence, I\u2019ve come out. My righteous Northeast fans, please raise your little hands so I know that you are still alive.\u201d</p><br/><p>In an instant, the comments started popping out maniacally.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn! The god is still alive!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf he\u2019s talking about the righteous fans, I\u2019ll be the first to raise my hand.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, where are you? Can you say something? I just want to take a photo with you. I don\u2019t have any other intentions.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin has appeared. I predict that something huge is going to happen.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan hadn\u2019t announced the matter yet. He had to at least wait until the reporters and related departments reached before doing so. Against such a matter, he had to sternly and righteously reject it, or even expose it.</p><br/><p>He stood facing the entrance of Godfather Liu\u2019s company.</p><br/><p>The security guard felt that something was wrong.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d asked the security guard.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan glanced at him and said, \u201cI\u2019m Shanghai\u2019s Righteous Master Lin. I\u2019m here to attack the evil.\u201d</p><br/><p>The security guard was dumbfounded, \u201c???\u201d</p><br/><p>He felt that this young man might have had a problem with his brain. Was he trying to attack evil over there?</p><br/><p>Did he not know whose territory this was?</p><br/><p>\u201cMove aside. Don\u2019t interrupt the work here,\u201d the security guard reprimanded. As one of Godfather Liu\u2019s men, he had a feeling of superiority that he never had before. Although he was just a security guard, he felt that he was f*cking awesome. Because it was Godfather Liu\u2019s territory, he didn\u2019t give face to anyone.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved his hand. \u201cI think you better leave now. Otherwise, I\u2019m afraid that you may not be able to leave.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d The security guard felt that he had met with a retard. Just as he was about to use violence to chase the opposition away\u2026</p><br/><p>Car after car drove over from afar.</p><br/><p>The media\u2019s cars stopped there.</p><br/><p>The reporters looked at Lin Fan and cried out in shock, \u201cHe\u2019s here! Master Lin is here!\u201d</p><br/><p>The security guard cursed when he saw this situation. He had no idea what was going on.</p><br/><p><em>Why were there so many reporters?</em></p><br/><p><em>What kind of f*cking situation was this?</em></p><br/><p>At that moment, he felt that things didn\u2019t seem right. He quickly contacted his colleagues and told them to come over. This wasn\u2019t something he could handle alone.</p><br/><p><em>And who the heck was this guy in front of him?</em></p><br/><p><em>Why did these reporters know him?</em></p><br/><p><em>Could it be that he was some sort of big figure?</em></p><br/><p>A reporter said, \u201cHello, Master Lin. Can I ask you why you\u2019re in the Northeast?\u201d</p><br/><p>Another reporter asked, \u201cMaster Lin, what has happened here? What is the huge matter that you mentioned on Weibo.\u201d</p><br/><p>The crowd kept asking questions non stop. Their hearts were very curious.</p><br/><p>Although they weren\u2019t Shanghai reporters, they knew in their hearts that wherever Master Lin appeared, there would definitely be big news.</p><br/><p>This was something that was widely known among the media circles.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan calmly waved his hand at these reporters. \u201cEveryone, please stay calm and don\u2019t be too excited. More people will be coming later on. When they come, I\u2019ll lead everyone in exposing evil.\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporters were in eager anticipation. They were all wondering what exactly that \u2018evil\u2019 was that Master Lin was talking about.</p><br/><p>However, some reporters realized that something wasn\u2019t right here.</p><br/><p>\u201cI think this is Godfather Liu\u2019s logistics company, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. because of that Ying Jin incident, Master Lin and Godfather Liu have had a conflict. It seems that Godfather Liu is involved in this matter.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen if we report this, will there be any problems?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you afraid of? They\u2019re all here, what do we have to be afraid of?\u201d</p><br/><p>Some reporters were a little worried. However, in the face of potential news, their professional qualities made them fearless.</p><br/><p>This was their dedication to big news.</p><br/><p>Very soon.</p><br/><p>A police car arrived.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho called the police?\u201d The police got off the car. When they saw so many reporters, they were startled and couldn\u2019t quite understand it. What was going on?</p><br/><p>However, they still had to carry on with the procedures.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was me.\u201d Lin Fan raised his hand.</p><br/><p>The policemen saw Lin Fan and went forward to him. \u201cWhy did you call the police? Is there an issue?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cPolice comrade, I called the police because I discovered an extremely vile matter. This matter concerns the health of tens of thousands of citizens. If it is left alone, it will cause extremely nasty repercussions.\u201d</p><br/><p>The policeman looked at Lin Fan and was taken aback by what Lin Fan had said.</p><br/><p><em>Did it concern tens of thousands of people?</em></p><br/><p><em>Could this man in front of him be retarded?</em></p><br/><p>The reporters realized that the policemen were making suspicious expressions. They hurriedly said, \u201cThis is Shanghai\u2019s Master Lin. He\u2019s very famous. Master Lin must have discovered a major problem You must all be alert.\u201d</p><br/><p>The old policeman clearly didn\u2019t pay attention to Weibo much. He had a suspicious look on his face. What was this about \u2018Master Lin\u2019?</p><br/><p>It was the young policeman beside him who started to be filled with excitement.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re Master Lin? I\u2019ve always followed your Weibo. I really worship some things about you,\u201d said the young policeman ecstatically. Then, he looked at his senior beside him. \u201cThis is Shanghai\u2019s Master Lin. He\u2019s a very good man. Something big must have happened. Otherwise, Master Lin wouldn\u2019t have called the police.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded contently. This young comrade was pretty good. He really understood Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. I\u2019ve discovered a huge matter. It requires the media and the police to be on scene in order to expose it,\u201d said Lin Fan calmly.</p><br/><p>The young policeman was very curious. \u201cMaster Lin, we\u2019ve all reached already. You can expose it now, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved his hand. \u201cNot yet. The Food Safety Department people aren\u2019t here yet.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><br/><p>The policemen were stunned.</p><br/><p><em>Why did the people from the Food Safety Department have to come too?</em></p><br/><p><em>Wasn\u2019t the police enough?</em></p><br/><p>In a certain villa.</p><br/><p>Godfather Liu was contemplating things. Suddenly, his urgent phone rang, interrupting his thoughts.</p><br/><p>When he answered the call, a hurried voice came from the other end.</p><br/><p>\u201cGodfather Liu, it\u2019s bad. Something has happened at the company. A lot of reporters have arrived here and there are even policemen,\u201d said one of his henchmen.</p><br/><p>Godfather Liu frowned, \u201cHow did this happen? Why would the police and reporters come?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. They were called over by some guy called Master Lin,\u201d said the henchman.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d When Godfather Liu heard this, he erupted. He had been looking for Lin Fan the whole time but had never succeeded. But who would have thought that Lin Fan would dare to appear in his own territory?</p><br/><p>Suddenly, he felt that something was wrong.</p><br/><p>Then, the more he thought about it, the wronger it felt. He hoped it wasn\u2019t as he thought. If it really was, things would be very bad.</p><br/><p>At the scene!</p><br/><p>The people from the Food Safety Department had reached.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan saw that it was about time to reveal the truth.</p><br/><p>Looking at those eager eyes of the reporters, he felt that he couldn\u2019t disappoint them.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Lin Fan took a deep breath, opened his mouth, and said, \u201cMy dear comrades, it\u2019s time to expose the truth. This company behind me, you all may already know about it. That\u2019s right, it\u2019s the Northeast\u2019s Godfather Liu\u2019s company. But you all might not have expected that in here, he is hiding a lot of things that will soon be distributed outside which will cause people to become sick. Now, everyone, please follow me and charge inside. I\u2019ll bring you all to take a look.\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporters were ecstatic. This was definitely going to be a piece of big news.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, the policemen were startled. They felt that things seemed far from good.</p></div>\n</div>"}

You have to stay calm.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian said softly by the side, \u201cYou can\u2019t hit them. Girls are naturally seen as more vulnerable on the Internet. You\u2019ll get flamed to death.\u201d</p><br/><p>This was the first time Wu You Lan had seen Lin Fan hit a girl. Suddenly, she was at a loss.</p><br/><p>Such individuality.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cLet me tell you, I hit you because I want to let you know that you should think before you speak. Don\u2019t think that just because you\u2019re females, you won\u2019t get hit. This is all I\u2019ll say today. Apologize to Auntie Gao. As for the matter between you and I, you can come look for me anytime. I\u2019ll slowly play with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Such dominance.</p><br/><p>The shop owners were all stunned. They always knew that Little Boss was very dominant but they couldn\u2019t tell that he could be this dominant. It was simply scary.</p><br/><p>If they hadn\u2019t seen this for themselves, they wouldn\u2019t have dared to believe that Little Boss would actually be this dominant.</p><br/><p>But this matter has already happened. He had hit someone and there was probably going to be some repercussion.</p><br/><p>The two girls were a little scared now. They never thought that this man would dare to hit them. Initially, they were relying on the assumption that no one would dare to hit them because this was Shanghai and hitting someone was a crime.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan\u2019s brows furrowed, \u201cDid you hear what I said?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh! Don\u2019t hit us.\u201d The taller girl\u2019s eyes had turned red and she was already completely frightened. She let out a miserable expression and gave off a feeling of someone who needed protection.</p><br/><p>The surrounding shop owners looked at the two girls and couldn\u2019t help but shake their heads and laugh. Where did that arrogance from before go to? Who knew they would turn so weak so quickly?</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t show this kind of disgusting expression as if I\u2019m bullying you. Did you hear what I said or not?\u201d Lin Fan said in a stern tone.</p><br/><p>The shorter girl nodded, \u201cWe heard it, we heard it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good. Now apologize to this Auntie and clean up the dog feces on the floor. As for me hitting you, I admit to it. You can do whatever you like. I\u2019ll cooperate willingly, okay?\u201d Lin Fan wasn\u2019t afraid of all this. They were asking for a beating and reasoning with them was not an option at that moment. The only reasoning they needed was to get hit.</p><br/><p>Auntie Gao was at a loss for words, \u201cLittle Boss, I\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved his hand, \u201cIt\u2019s nothing. I\u2019ll resolve this matter. We, the people of Cloud Street, will not be bullied. Isn\u2019t that right, everyone?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, don\u2019t worry Sister Gao. Little Boss will resolve this matter.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThese two ladies are too despicable. I don\u2019t know how they were raised. It\u2019s considered a good thing that they were hit by Little Boss. If it was somewhere else, it wouldn\u2019t have been the same.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard that in some places, they don\u2019t care if you\u2019re male or female, they\u2019ll hit you till half your body is paralyzed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat kind of thing indeed exists.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The two girls stood up, trembling. They had really been frightened. As they looked at Lin Fan, their faces were pale and they said weakly, \u201cDon\u2019t hit us anymore. We\u2019ll apologize.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHurry up then. What are you dawdling for?\u201d Lin Fan said strictly.</p><br/><p>The two of them went in front of Auntie Gao and said, \u201cSorry, Auntie. We didn\u2019t do it on purpose.\u201d</p><br/><p>Auntie Gao didn\u2019t say much. She just nodded.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan pointed at the dog feces on the ground, \u201cClean it up.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two of them were a little reluctant but seeing Lin Fan\u2019s fierce look, they took out tissues from their bags and wrapped up the dog feces. Then, they threw it into the rubbish bin at the side. \u201cBrother, is that okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRemember, it was me who hit you. If you want to come looking, then look for me. If I find out that you dare to trouble this Auntie after this, I\u2019ll make you face the consequences, understand?\u201d Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe understand, we understand.\u201d The two of them hurriedly nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cScram.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two of them immediately carried their little dogs and left the place. However, as they turned around, the two of them had rage in their hearts. They felt an urge to kill Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Then, they ran away without turning back at all.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan took a deep breath to calm himself down. \u201cD*mn, they even said that I was being cheated on. I don\u2019t even have a girlfriend. I don\u2019t even meet the prerequisite.\u201d</p><br/><p>Auntie Gao said gratefully, \u201cLittle Boss, I\u2019m really so thankful for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved his hand, \u201cIt was nothing. This kind of people just deserves a beating. Otherwise, they won\u2019t know the limit. Don\u2019t worry. If they come causing trouble for you, just tell me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey won\u2019t. I don\u2019t think they will,\u201d said Auntie Gao.</p><br/><p>The shop owners laughed, \u201cLittle Boss is indeed the most dominant. This kind of people really deserve to be beaten but we didn\u2019t have the guts, unlike Little Boss.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough hitting women isn\u2019t good, sometimes, you have to look at the situation. They were both spoiled kids.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI wonder which idiot said that men cannot hit women no matter what. How can this kind of people not be beaten?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone, time to disperse. There\u2019s nothing to see anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lil\u2019 Fatty Chang went in front of Master Lin. \u201cUncle Lin, don\u2019t worry. If anything happens in Cloud Street in future, I\u2019ll let you know immediately.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan patted Lil\u2019 Fatty Chang on the head. \u201cMmm, not bad. In future, you\u2019ll be responsible for safeguarding the peace of Cloud Street. Don\u2019t let me down.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lil\u2019 Fatty Change looked up at Uncle Lin. His eyes were filled with boundless hope as he said loudly, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Uncle Lin! With me around, Cloud Street will definitely be peaceful. I promise that I\u2019ll definitely carry out my responsibility.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGo on then. Look for me if there\u2019s anything in future,\u201d said Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Lil\u2019 Fatty smiled with exceptional joy. He had finally gained Uncle Lin\u2019s recognition. Who would dare to bully him anymore in future?</p><br/><p>Haha!</p><br/><p>Outside Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>The two girls hadn\u2019t left yet. They were clenching their teeth as one of them said, \u201cB*stard. He actually dared to hit me. I have to tell my boyfriend.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t been beaten in my whole life before. What rights does he have? I have to tell my father.\u201d</p><br/><p>The taller girl nodded, \u201cRight, tell Uncle.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan knew that this matter definitely wouldn\u2019t end so easily. But he didn\u2019t let it bother him. It was just a small matter.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian raised his thumb. \u201cAwesome. I thought you would have tender feelings for females. I never thought that you would hit her.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shrugged, \u201cIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t have tender feelings for females but this kind of people really deserves to be hit. If they were male, they would definitely have to be carried out of this place today.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Tian He said, \u201cNext time, you shouldn\u2019t hit them if it\u2019s avoidable. That situation just now would have been resolved easily by calling the police.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved his hand. \u201cCalling the police would only mediate things. The two girls would definitely not repent. When reasoning can\u2019t be used, fists are the only way to resolve things. If there are any issues, then come. I, Lin Fan, have never been afraid. I\u2019ve even been imprisoned before, who would I be scared of?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan said worriedly, \u201cBrother Lin, you can\u2019t be imprisoned again. We\u2019d be very worried.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded, \u201cMmm, got it.\u201d</p><br/><p>For some reason, Wu You Lan suddenly said, \u201cAnd don\u2019t let those words bother you. No one will cheat on you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEr?\u201d Lin Fan was taken aback. \u201cWhat did you just say?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNothing much. Oh yes, I recently met a very good friend,\u201d Wu You Lan said.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan didn\u2019t really pay attention. He casually replied, \u201cThat\u2019s a good thing. It\u2019s not bad to go shopping with friends when you\u2019re free. What\u2019s your friend\u2019s name?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan smiled, \u201cLiu Xu.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>\u201cLiu Xu?\u201d</p><br/><p>Motherf*cker, isn\u2019t that Brother Qiang Qiang?</p></div>\n</div>"}

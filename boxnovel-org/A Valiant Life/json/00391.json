The outcome was pretty good. In a few days, they would basically be done.</p><br/><p>\"How does it feel?\" Lin Fan asked Zhao Ming Qing.</p><br/><p>Although Zhao Ming Qing was old, he still had plenty of energy, especially when he was doing something that he liked. From start to end, he had never gotten distracted. And today was much too rewarding. He had recorded many things in his notebook. When he went back, he had to study it properly.</p><br/><p>\"Teacher, today was really much too rewarding. It's like everything was suddenly made clear. Some of the things that I didn't quite understand in the past, I can now gradually understand,\" said Zhao Ming Qing ecstatically.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded. \"It's good that it's rewarding. I'm going back first.\"</p><br/><p>It had been yet another packed day for him. Although he was tired, he was in a pretty good mood.</p><br/><p>\"Master Lin\u2026\" At that moment, Director Huang rushed out from the inside. \"Do we need to report this to the media?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved his hand. \"Not for now.\"</p><br/><p>This matter hadn't been properly prepared yet. If they were to report it to the media, who knew what would happen? If it affected his daily work, that would be f*cked up. Reporters these days were really maniacal. If they knew about this, Lin Fan might not be able to be as relaxed anymore.</p><br/><p>However, Lin Fan wasn't afraid of being discovered by the reporters because not many reporters were willing to go to the Children's Welfare Institute to look for news. There wasn't much juicy news that came from such a place. Who would be willing to come?</p><br/><p>In a certain villa.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing was completely immersed in his study room, studying the information that he had recorded that day. At the same time, he started flipping through his books. Today had really been much too rewarding for him. His horizons had been expanded. In particular, some of the knowledge taught by his teacher had been unheard of by him before.</p><br/><p>At that moment, the only sounds in the study room were those of Zhao Ming Qing flipping through his books and arranging his information.</p><br/><p>Outside.</p><br/><p>\"Dad isn't going to eat? We've already called him several times,\" said Zhao Li Xing with a frown.</p><br/><p>Zhao Bin came down from upstairs. \"Dad told us to eat first and not to wait for him. He says that he's researching about something.\"</p><br/><p>Zhao Li Xing shook his head. \"We can't do that. It seems like Dad is possessed or something. He's already so old, how can he endure this?\"</p><br/><p>Zhao Shi and Zhao Ming Qing had been together for almost their whole lives. Of course, she understood his personality well. She said, \"Alright, we'll eat first. The only thing that can make your dad neglect his food and sleep is Chinese medicine.\"</p><br/><p>In this family, there were three sons and a daughter. They had come home right after work. Without resolving this matter, they couldn't be at peace. If their Dad had really been tricked by someone, they would feel responsible for anything that would happen to him.</p><br/><p>\"Big Bro, why don't we go to Cloud Street to find that guy and clarify things,\" suggested Zhao Bin.</p><br/><p>Zhao Shi looked at her two sons and shook her head. \"Just keep an eye on your Dad. If your Dad finds out that you two are meddling, he might just go into a rage. Also, have you all called those Uncles and Aunties? Have you told them not to come?\"</p><br/><p>Zhao Bin nodded. \"Mom, we've already called them and told them about it. But this time, our family has really become a joke. Even those Uncles and Aunties are laughing at our Dad for being tricked.\"</p><br/><p>Zhao Shi shook her head. When they were young, her husband had been such a smart man. How had he become so gullible?</p><br/><p>Several days later.</p><br/><p>Every day, after finishing the work at the shop, Lin Fan would go to Nanshan Children's Welfare Institute. Zhao Ming Qing reached there on time every day. Before his teacher came, he would start making records of the children's conditions.</p><br/><p>Within these few days, Zhao Ming Qing felt that he had entered a realm that he had never been able to come close to before. To him, it was like a blessing from heaven and he was greatly appreciative of it.</p><br/><p>Moreover, he could feel that his teacher was gradually starting to really teach him some Chinese medicine-related things. In particular, there was this one time when his teacher had unintentionally combined both Chinese and Western medical practices. That was when he noticed that this teacher of his was not as simple as he had thought.</p><br/><p>Ever since then, he had become even more attentive. After recording some notes, he would go back to properly find out the meaning behind them.</p><br/><p>\"Teacher, recently, I've been going home to study what you've taught me. Using the three main acupuncture points in the leg as a base and then adding other acupuncture points as support, I can flush out the impurities that are blocking the blood vessels. And then, using a certain massage technique, a miraculous effect can be produced. However, the effect that I produce seems slower than the effect produced when you personally perform the treatment,\" said Zhao Ming Qing.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. What was there to be expected? The treatment procedure was indeed correct but Lin Fan had the Encyclopedia's mystical boost. He already had this boost, so obviously, the outcome couldn't be compared.</p><br/><p>\"Am I not your teacher?\" asked Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing nodded. \"Yes, of course, you are.\"</p><br/><p>\"Then it's fine. As a teacher, if I'm not a little better than you, how can I continue being your teacher? Isn't that right?\"</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing looked at Lin Fan and said, \"Nothing wrong with that statement.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said cheerily, \"Don't you think you should add a 'Buddy' to that sentence?\"</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing laughed and said, \"You're my teacher, not my buddy.\"</p><br/><p>\"Uncle\u2026\" At that moment, a child who was sitting in a wheelchair looked at all his friends around him with a longing look, then, he looked at Lin Fan. \"Uncle, can I walk like them too?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan had been chatting with Zhao Ming Qing when this happened. He was startled. He looked at the child in front of him and saw that he was missing a leg. This wasn't something that could be treated using medical treatment. It couldn't be regrown.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan patted the child on his head and said, \"You will.\"</p><br/><p>\"You're not lying?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded seriously. \"I pinky swear. I'm not lying.\"</p><br/><p>In such a case, if he wanted to walk, he had to use a prosthetic leg but for the child, it would be very inconvenient. Lin Fan had a very big idea in his mind. Even though this idea wasn't very realistic, a person had to have ideas.</p><br/><p>The subclass of the science and technology major class, 'simulated human prosthetic limb' knowledge, required a huge amount of Encyclopedic Points. With his current Encyclopedic Points, it wasn't even enough to unlock a fraction of it.</p><br/><p>But Lin Fan believed that one day, he would successfully unlock this class of knowledge.</p><br/><p>The current situation was the most ideal situation that Lin Fan could achieve as of now. The children of the Children's Welfare Institute were no longer like before.</p><br/><p>\"Director Huang, I'm pretty much done treating the children. I'm just left with thirty-five whose body conditions cannot be treated using medical techniques. Pay more attention to them and don't let them feel depressed,\" said Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Director Huang nodded and replied, \"Don't worry, Master Lin. I will remember that. These children are really pitiful. I never thought\u2026 Sigh.\"</p><br/><p>Han Lu said, \"Master Lin, please leave this matter to me as well. I promise to take good care of them.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded. \"Don't announce this matter to the outside. Don't tell anyone.\"</p><br/><p>Director Huang and Han Lu both nodded. Naturally, they knew the implications involved. Especially at that moment, when they looked at Lin Fan's gaze, it was like looking at a godly person. It was simply too astonishing.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

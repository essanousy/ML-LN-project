It looks legit.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, this is really good news. His bank account info and his personal info are all online. But something isn\u2019t right. This looks like something taken from the bank database.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWait a minute, could Master Lin be\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCould he have hacked the bank and the police database?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot possible. How is that possible? Master Lin doesn\u2019t know how to use computers.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen how do you explain that? How do you explain what he just posted?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou guys can stop fighting. This guy is from Shanghai and Master Lin probably has his ways of getting the information.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone on Weibo started speculating as to what had happened and all of them were puzzled beyond belief. They had never thought that Master Lin would be able to find the information regarding the scammer.</p><br/><p>However, they were suspicious and they wondered if the information was legitimate.</p><br/><p>But because it was posted by Master Lin, they believed that the information was real.</p><br/><p>In a certain rental flat.</p><br/><p>A few computer screens were lit up and there were a few mobile phones scattered around the table.</p><br/><p>A few scrawny teenagers were sitting around. They only ever ate cup noodles and did their own business in the dingy flat.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello, Madam Yang. We are from the Happy Everyday Program Group. Congratulations on being selected as our lucky viewer. You have won sixty thousand dollars in a lucky draw. All you have to do now is to remit five thousand dollars to xx bank account to be able to claim your prize\u2026\u201d The young man\u2019s voice was refined, sounding convincing and professional. It was a shame that the person on the other side of the phone hung up immediately before he could complete his statement.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn it, that\u2019s really disrespectful,\u201d the teenager said, cursing at his phone, thereafter picking another number to call.</p><br/><p>His computer had a lot of data, which they had gotten from the hospital as well as paying for it through certain platforms.</p><br/><p>Although most people didn\u2019t believe them, there would always be a few people who would believe them.</p><br/><p>Without thinking too much, he continued to pick his target.</p><br/><p>\u201cYang Li, a university student, from a small village, poor family. Not bad, this is a good pick.\u201d</p><br/><p>He called the number.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m looking for a student whose name is Yang Li?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSpeaking.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe are from the Education Department. The bursary which you have applied for has already been processed and all you need to do is to follow our instructions. Please go to the nearest ATM and use your China Construction Bank card to open the bursary page and we will be able to help you with the process.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally?\u201d an excited voice replied across the phone.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, that is correct.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go to the bank now. Just wait for me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, we\u2019ll call you in half an hour. Goodbye.\u201d</p><br/><p>After hanging up, the teenager laughed, saving her number before turning to the female colleague next to him.</p><br/><p>\u201cCall this one later.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGot it,\u201d the female colleague replied.</p><br/><p>This was one of their tactics. She would call the university student and ask the university student to hurry to the bank, otherwise, it would be too late. If the student didn\u2019t make it in time, the next processing timing would be in a month\u2019s time. Under these circumstances, the student wouldn\u2019t think too much. She would hurry to the bank and would follow their instructions.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere is Brother Mao?\u201d the teenager asked suspiciously.</p><br/><p>The female colleague shook her head. \u201cBrother Mao earned quite a huge sum of money a while back and is now enjoying himself. He won\u2019t be back for quite some time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen will I be like Brother Mao?\u201d the teenager said, his voice in awe.</p><br/><p>\u201cSlowly, you still have much to learn from Brother Mao,\u201d the female colleague replied.</p><br/><p>Inside the house.</p><br/><p>Mao Fang was playing computer games. His mood had been quite good these past few days after earning a huge sum of money. But he couldn\u2019t really call it earning since he technically scammed it from another person. After getting bored of playing computer games, he went through the internet to see if there were any new happenings.</p><br/><p>Weibo.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, his facial expression changed. Why on earth was his personal information on Weibo?</p><br/><p>After looking at it in greater detail, he jumped up in shock and fear.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow is this possible? How did I get found out?\u201d Mao Fang couldn\u2019t believe it. He had been caught red handed.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Mao Fang was in a daze as he sat down, not knowing what to do. At that moment, he was speechless.</p><br/><p>Could he make a run for it?</p><br/><p>But where to?</p><br/><p>In this society, it was almost impossible to disappear without a trace.</p><br/><p>The seventy-year-old lady was dead. He thought of that period where he went out to scam old people. He had seen the news, but he didn\u2019t really pay any attention to it.</p><br/><p>The news was talking about himself.</p><br/><p>Mao Fang\u2019s throat tightened and his vision became blurry as panic set in.</p><br/><p>*Knock knock!*</p><br/><p>Just at this moment, someone was waiting outside his door.</p><br/><p>After hearing the knocking sound, Mao Fang jumped up in shock.</p><br/><p>He wanted to shout and ask the other party not to open the door, but he didn\u2019t know who was on the other side of the door.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, a loud, commanding voice boomed from across the door.</p><br/><p>\u201cGet down, hands behind your back. Don\u2019t move!\u201d</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>The door was pushed open by force and Liu Xiao Tian rushed into the room. He gave a grin as he saw Mao Fang in the room. \u201cWe\u2019ve found the person we came for.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mao Fang looked at the police officers, his eyes wide open in panic. He couldn\u2019t figure out how on earth his identity got leaked on the internet.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou look like you\u2019re done. So what are you doing now?\u201d Zhao Zhong Yang analyzed what Brother Lin was doing.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince I\u2019ve already started and can\u2019t stop, I might as well continue. This world has too many criminals and I must do all I can to weed them out,\u201d Lin Fan replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh?\u201d Zhao Zhong Yang looked at Brother Lin, puzzled beyond belief.</p><br/><p>This was just plain provocation.</p><br/><p>Shanyuan Bank.</p><br/><p>The Internet specialists were working on the problem.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere isn\u2019t a single missing file on the system. Everything is normal.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis hacker is really something else. Every single defense in the system was completely useless against him. This third generation system didn\u2019t even manage to stop him. However, he\u2019s too careless and didn\u2019t clean up after himself. We should be able to find him in a matter of time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, this hacker didn\u2019t conceal himself intentionally and instead, exposed himself. This is the same tactic used by the generals of old. He did everything in the open to let everyone know that it was him who did it.</p><br/><p>All the Internet professionals were stunned.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow could that be? There isn\u2019t a hacker on this earth who is that stupid.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDespicable. He\u2019s just provoking us by leaving his trail. As if he\u2019s trying to tell us that this was his doing and asking us to look for him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone, let\u2019s look for this person. Once we are able to contact him, ask him not to act alone. This hacker is definitely not acting alone with this kind of skill. Now I\u2019m just afraid they are a terrorist hacking group.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. This is just too despicable. With this kind of ability, he used it for evil instead of good. If the bank suffers anything because of him, it would escalate to something big.</p><br/><p>\u201cRoll out!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Not long after.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve found his ID. He is from Shanghai.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe found the same thing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBy cross-referencing his ID, we can tell that the person is from one of the shops on Cloud Street.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? How can this be? This hacker is just too despicable, bringing in the innocent into this. The trail that he left points to innocent people! This is unforgivable. Let\u2019s look again.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLeader, something isn\u2019t right. All the trails that he left point to Cloud Street. There isn\u2019t any other trail.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI just know that any hacker with this kind of capability would never leave his trail. But this brat has underestimated us. Some of you work on protecting the bank system and some of you continue finding the hacker with me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes\u2026\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

When the patients gradually started to change, he could not help feeling extremely shocked. He felt like this was a little freakish.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher?\u201d He wanted to ask him how all of this was happening.</p><br/><p>\u201cHush!\u201d Lin Fan grabbed the hand of one of the patients and slowly felt the changes that were occurring within his body. Although he could not turn the pill into a prescription, he still wanted to know what kind of changes the pill would cause within the body.</p><br/><p>New hair started to grow from their bodies.</p><br/><p>Their pale complexion slowly started to become red again.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan, besides taking note of the changes, was also waiting for the notification that he had finished this task.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-2\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Every single one of the patients let out a sound showing how comfortable they felt. Until this point in time, their bodies had always been in pain. But right now, they felt an extreme level of comfort. It was a type of comfort they had never felt before.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Lin Fan suddenly felt something. He finally felt what the pill was doing in their bodies and the kind of changes it was making.</p><br/><p>He could not help but let out a smile.</p><br/><p><em>So that\u2019s what it\u2019s supposed to be like. Seems like our prescription is still missing a little something.</em></p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing saw his teacher\u2019s expression and saw the confident smile on his face. He felt that his teacher now had some sort of confidence in making the prescription.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay now! My body feels extremely comfortable now,\u201d a patient exclaimed.</p><br/><p>Although they were still pretty weak, they could distinctly feel the changes in their bodies.</p><br/><p>Also, the excitement made them feel like they were already completely healthy.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, are we cured already?\u201d the patients asked with excitement.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded. \u201cYeah, you guys are cured. Your bodies are slowly recovering right now. However, your bodies are still a little weak. When you guys go back, you\u2019ll need a period of time to recuperate.\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-3\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Upon hearing Master Lin\u2019s words, the whole group of them became more excited.</p><br/><p>At the start, when they had contracted this condition, they had been filled with despair. It was a type of despair that you would understand only if you have been through it before.</p><br/><p>However, right now, their despair had suddenly become hope. This left them completely speechless.</p><br/><p>To the patients, Master Lin was their savior.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you, Master Lin\u2026\u201d the patients were so emotional that they wanted to bow down to Lin Fan. Although they were all older than Lin Fan, they felt that that was the only way they could truly express their gratitude to him.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was just one person and he could not stop them. So, he just went along with them.</p><br/><p>Suddenly!</p><br/><p>The notification came.</p><br/><p>Inside, Lin Fan was eager. He was wondering what would come next.</p><br/><p>He had been playing with the thought of being able to unlock the immortal cultivation classification of knowledge. However, the chances were very slim.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe task to use medicinal pills to end the suffering of ten people has been completed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnlocking the twentieth page of knowledge. As it is the twentieth page of knowledge, a class of knowledge will be randomly chosen.\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-4\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>When he saw this notification, he became a little stunned.</p><br/><p><em>Randomly chosen?</em></p><br/><p><em>What does this mean?</em></p><br/><p><em>Something seems wrong.</em></p><br/><p>\u201cOpening the angling major classification of knowledge.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTask: Fish out a legendary item.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReward: Encyclopedic points +100 and the ability to unlock the twenty-first page of knowledge.\u201d</p><br/><p>Encyclopedic Points: 3158</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was a little dumbfounded. When he heard that it was a major classification, he had been very excited. However, when he heard that it was the angling major classification of knowledge, he was flabbergasted.</p><br/><p><em>What kind of a joke is this?</em></p><br/><p><em>A legendary item? You must take me for a fool if you want me to fish out a legendary item.</em></p><br/><p><em>Forget it. Now isn\u2019t the time to think about this. Right now, the most important thing is to develop the prescription.</em></p><br/><p>After personally seeing all the patients who had recovered, Lin Fan also started to smile. \u201cOkay, you guys are fine now. You guys can leave now, we still need to do our research.\u201d</p><br/><p>The recovered patients, who all felt extremely grateful to Lin Fan, said, \u201cYes, yes, we should not disturb Master Lin.\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-5\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>When everyone had left, Lin Fan looked at Zhao Ming Qing. \u201cMing Qing, I already have a concrete plan. We\u2019ll be able to finish this latest by tomorrow.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Zhao Ming Qing heard this, he instantly became excited.</p><br/><p><em>Finish it by tomorrow? Seems like Teacher has already figured it out.</em></p><br/><p>Outside.</p><br/><p>When the patients came out, the doctors, who were all waiting outside, were all dumbfounded upon seeing the sight unfolding in front of their eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026 you guys have been cured?\u201d the doctors asked in complete astonishment.</p><br/><p>They were all extremely shocked as the patients had been cured so quickly.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, we are already cured. Right now I feel like my body is full of power and it doesn\u2019t hurt at all. Master Lin\u2019s pill is really too magical,\u201d the patients excitedly said.</p><br/><p>After that, they took a deep breath of the air. They felt like the fresh air was really amazing.</p><br/><p>The doctors looked upon these patients, completely dumbfounded. At that moment, they had no idea what to say.</p><br/><p>When they reached the outside, all the reporters, as well as the people from the pharmaceutical companies who had been waiting outside all this while, went crazy upon seeing them.</p><br/><p>The reporters rushed up to interview the patients. The people from the pharmaceutical companies also rushed up, all wanting to go up and ask what in the world had happened.</p><br/><p>One of the managers of the pharmaceutical companies rushed to ask, \u201cHow was it like inside? How is the research that Master Lin and Director Zhao are doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>The patients, who had been given a new lease of life, excitedly said, \u201cI don\u2019t know how their research is going but there is an extremely strong smell of Chinese medicine inside, completely unbearable for the nose. The foot of the wall is also piled with Chinese medicine. However, Master Lin and Director Zhao look like they are in pretty good spirits. It seems like they will be able to develop the prescription pretty quickly.</p><br/><p>When everyone heard that, they had a rough idea of what was going on. It seemed like the development of prescription was in its final phase already. However, they were all still unsure of what to do next.</p><br/><p>Suddenly!</p><br/><p>In the huge group of people, someone exclaimed, \u201cThe people from the Health Department have arrived.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone turned their heads to look. The expressions of some of the people from the pharmaceutical companies totally changed.</p><br/><p><em>Why would people from the Health Department come? This has nothing to do with them.</em></p><br/><p><em>Could it be that they are here for Master Lin\u2019s prescription?</em></p><br/><p><em>If they are, then there could be some issues.</em></p><br/><p><em>The Health Department us getting involved in something that does not concern them at all.</em></p><br/><p>A few limousines came to a halt.</p><br/><p>The director of the Health Department stepped out of his vehicle and the reporters rushed to surrounded him. They were extremely curious as to why the Health Department would come over here.</p><br/><p>The director was a little stunned after he saw that there were so many people at the scene. If it was according to what they had discussed, the pharmaceutical companies definitely would not pass up this great opportunity.</p><br/><p>However, the reason they had come down today was to try and use their authority and power to take over the prescription. After getting the prescription, they were going to start mass producing it and then they would allow bids and let the pharmaceutical companies compete with each other to get the authority to act as a distributor. Finally, the pharmaceutical companies would distribute it to the hospitals.</p><br/><p>When some of the people in charge of the pharmaceutical companies saw this situation, they felt a little helpless.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no hope left. The people from the Health Department are here, we don\u2019t have a d*mn chance.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, let\u2019s go, let\u2019s go. Even if the prescription is developed, we won\u2019t have a chance to get it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be so rash, let\u2019s see how the situation turns out first.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p></div>\n</div>"}

At this moment, a call came. Looking at his phone, he saw that it was from the ground-level workers and he thought that they required advice from him, so he answered the call.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Soon after, this middle-aged man shot up from his chair in shock after hearing what the opposite party had said. His expression was exceptionally unpleasant as if he hadn\u2019t expected something like this to happen.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll come right now. Be more courteous to Master Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>After hanging up, the middle-aged man was so angry that his face turned red. It was as if some kind of shameful thing had been discovered. He grabbed his coat and rushed out of the office.</p><br/><p>Those who were working saw the leader leaving in such a hurry and wondered what was happening.</p><br/><p>In their eyes, for the leader to be looking so fiery, something big must have happened.</p><br/><p>The noodle shop.</p><br/><p>\u201cMom, I want to go home. I don\u2019t want to stay here.\u201d The child didn\u2019t know what was going on. He whined loudly before kicking a chair away and walking towards the exit.</p><br/><p>But just as he was leaving, the middle-aged man pulled him back.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cWhen your husband comes, I want to ask him if he permitted you to be so overbearing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cServing the people. Serving the people indeed.\u201d</p><br/><p>To the workers at the side, these words were very piercing. They shamefully lowered their heads. They didn\u2019t want this to happen either but the middle-aged woman was the wife of their leader. In order for them to be promoted, they had to develop the right connections.</p><br/><p>Especially since the leader\u2019s wife had asked them to do something, they couldn\u2019t reject her. After all, sometimes, sucking up to the higher-ups was a thousand times more useful than working hard in their unit.</p><br/><p>But now, a problem had arisen that they hadn\u2019t expected at all. Shanghai was so big. How was it that they had been so unlucky to meet the meddlesome Master Lin?</p><br/><p>Moreover, this Master Lin was so f*cking awesome. How would they even survive this encounter?</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care about that.\u201d The middle-aged woman seemed a little fearful now. She wanted to leave this place quickly.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at her calmly. \u201cDon\u2019t go. Your husband is already coming, why would you leave? Just wait.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMom, I want to go home. I don\u2019t want to stay here any longer.\u201d The child was pushing his mother, wanting to leave. Then, he looked at Lin Fan and said rudely, \u201cWhy won\u2019t you let my mother go? We want to leave. What the heck does this have to do with you?\u201d</p><br/><p>A child\u2019s words carry no harm. A child\u2019s words are pleasing to the ears. But why was it that these words were so annoying?</p><br/><p>The surrounding workers looked at this mannerless child and felt very regretful. At the same time, they understood that there had been a major issue with this child\u2019s education.</p><br/><p>Soon after.</p><br/><p>A figure rushed in hastily.</p><br/><p>When this person entered the shop, he looked around and couldn\u2019t help but grunt coldly. His wife, child, and even his mother were there. Even workers from his unit were there.</p><br/><p>But when he looked at the young man standing at the side, he immediately went forward, extending his hand. \u201cMaster Lin, hello, hello.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy surname is Zhang. I\u2019m the leader of the Food Hygiene Department.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. \u201cLeader Zhang. I hope I didn\u2019t disturb your work by telling your subordinate to call you over.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, no,\u201d Zhang Zhi Jun shook his head as he replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cDad.\u201d When the child saw this man, he immediately pounced onto him as if he had found someone to rely on. \u201cDad, he\u2019s bullying me. Beat him for me.\u201d</p><br/><p>*Bam!*</p><br/><p>Zhang Zhi Jun slapped his son, causing his son to start wailing loudly. Meanwhile, the middle-aged woman wanted to say something but was scared stiff by her husband\u2019s glare.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou brat\u2026\u201d Zhang Zhi Jun had not thought that his son would be like this. Because of his work, he hadn\u2019t had time to watch over him and he had left his son in the hands of his wife and mother. But after hearing the situation on the phone, he understood.</p><br/><p>But at this point, it wasn\u2019t time to deal with that matter. Instead, he shifted his gaze to those workers and said sternly, \u201cWhat are you all doing? Why did you come here?\u201d</p><br/><p>When the workers heard this, they started stammering, \u201cLeader, we\u2026we\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Right now, they were so frightened that they didn\u2019t know what to say.</p><br/><p>Zhang Zhi Jun waved his hand. \u201cAlright, that\u2019s enough. I\u2019ll teach you guys a lesson. You don\u2019t have to keep your positions anymore. I gave you authority but this is how you repay me.\u201d</p><br/><p>The workers were so frightened that their faces turned pale. If they were to be fired, they wouldn\u2019t know what to do. They had put in so much effort just to get into their current department.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan spoke, \u201cLeader Zhang, I actually don\u2019t blame them for this. The main problem is that your wife was bossing them around. Although they are at fault too, it is understandable. After all, if their leader\u2019s wife orders them to do something, they wouldn\u2019t dare to disobey. Otherwise, if your wife speaks badly of them to you, they would have to suffer.\u201d</p><br/><p>When the workers heard Master Lin speak up for them, they were startled. Then, they felt even more guilty. They felt as if they had brought shame to their occupation.</p><br/><p>Zhang Zhi Jun was very embarrassed but he nodded. \u201cRight. Master Lin is right. They can\u2019t be entirely blamed for this.\u201d Then, he turned to his wife and raised his voice. \u201cTell me. Who gave you the right to get them to resolve this issue for you? Don\u2019t you know that this is illegal?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHusband, I\u2026\u201d The middle-aged women had been shaken by those words and she didn\u2019t even know what to say.</p><br/><p>\u201cMom, why did you spoil our child so much?\u201d Zhang Zhi Jun felt that his life had suddenly darkened. It was as if he had lost something in his life.</p><br/><p>The granny replied, \u201cHe\u2019s my grandson. If I don\u2019t spoil him, who would I shower my love on?\u201d</p><br/><p>The elderly had simple mindsets. To them, grandchildren were very important and they had to be loved.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at Zhang Zhi Jun and said, \u201cLeader Zhang, I can tell that you are someone who treats your work seriously. You weren\u2019t prepared for things to turn out this way. But I want to say this. If you just work so hard your whole life, your son will grow up to be a tyrant, causing trouble wherever he goes. Do you want to end up using your authority to clean up his mess or do you want to let go of some of your work responsibilities now and educate your child properly? Which do you think is more important?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Zhi Jun did not even have to consider it. \u201cOf course it\u2019s more important to educate my child. I\u2019m only working so hard to provide a good environment for him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNow that he has become like this, I\u2019ve lost all my spirit to work.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan felt that he didn\u2019t need to say more. He patted Zhang Zhi Jun\u2019s shoulder. \u201cLeader Zhang, I shan\u2019t bother about this anymore. The rest is up to you. This shop\u2019s owner was acting out of goodwill. He wanted to teach your son the meaning of respect but he ended up drawing all this trouble. I think you owe him an apology.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlso, If I were you, I would want to focus less on working and more on educating the child. After all, if he isn\u2019t taught well while he\u2019s young, it would be too late when he grows old.\u201d</p><br/><p>After saying that, Lin Fan didn\u2019t bother about this matter any longer. He just turned and left.</p><br/><p>Regarding this matter, he had never thought about making things hard for anyone. If it could be resolved perfectly and peacefully, that would be best.</p><br/><p>Moreover, he could tell that this Zhang Zhi Jun was a workaholic. The only problem was that he had neglected his family education.</p><br/><p><em>Sigh! Even when eating a bowl of noodles, I have to come across such trouble and be forced to help. Still, being able to resolve a matter through reasoning is a rare thing.</em></p><br/><p>\u2026</p></div>\n</div>"}

The shop owners were discussing intensely. To them, this was undoubtedly not a joyous occasion. The Tian Hong Commercial Street in the Hong Tian District, another old district in Shanghai. It wasn't any worse than their current location.</p><br/><p>At that moment, the crowd directed their gaze at Little Boss, waiting to hear what he had to say. Moving their shops and whatnot, they didn't mind. They had been doing business in Cloud Street for many years and they had seen its highest and its lowest. They had finally managed to turn the tides but they had been hit on the head by Xin Yu Corporation and they had lost all momentum.</p><br/><p>In the past, the rent seldom increased. And they just had their last increase half a year ago too. Perhaps Xin Yu Corporation had thought that the visitor flow in Cloud Street would not increase, so they didn't increase their rent too much. But now that the visitor flow grew, they spiked up the rent immediately. It was hard for the shop owners to accept.</p><br/><p>Liu Guo Qiang looked at Master Lin, not knowing what to say. But he had to say something, \"Master Lin, let's discuss this properly. Qi Ming Company has a good reputation indeed, but if everyone moves away, it'll have a large impact. After all, they've been here for so long. If they move, surely they'd feel reluctant.\"</p><br/><p>After hearing Liu Guo Qiang's words, the shop owners did feel a little reluctant. They had rented the shops here for so long and all of a sudden, then had to leave. Indeed, it was hard to bear.</p><br/><p>However, it wasn't that they wanted to leave but the rent increase was too much for them to afford. There wasn't even any buffer time for them.</p><br/><p>Zhu Xiu Qin stood silently by the side. To receive such a blow all of a sudden, then receive such a great offer from another party, if she was in the shop owners' positions, she might consider moving away too.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at Liu Guo Qiang and said, \"Director Liu, you have your reasons for increasing the rent. We understand that. But your increase if too high, we can't afford it. Now, Tian Hong Commercial Street has sent us a peaceful offering, to put our needs and benefits first. I don't think we have a reason to reject them.</p><br/><p>\"That's for sure but Master Lin, you're still not firm on your decision, are you? There's still room for negotiation.\" Liu Guo Qiang tried to keep the discussion alive. That's how bargaining worked.</p><br/><p>Take it slowly. Talk slowly. There will definitely be a reasonable compromise.</p><br/><p>But what he didn't know was that Master Lin really didn't want to discuss anymore.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan might not know how to do business, but he wasn't stupid. The conditions given by Tian Hong Commercial Street were so good. The early stage of moving might be troublesome but once they get past that, everything would become better.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Lin Fan looked at Liu Guo Qiang and said, \"Alright then, tell me how much you're going to increase the rent by.\"</p><br/><p>Liu Guo Qiang was stunned. He was speechless as he didn't have an answer.</p><br/><p>A hundred percent? Eighty? Seventy?</p><br/><p>If he were to say these numbers, he was afraid he would lose all respect. Then, with a weak voice, as if he had no confidence, he spoke.</p><br/><p>\"Thirty percent.\"</p><br/><p>\"No, I mean twenty.\"</p><br/><p>\"Are you crazy?\" Zhu Xiu Qin cried out in shock.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shook his head. \"Director Liu, this isn't a food market. From a hundred percent, you went to eighty and now, from thirty to twenty. You make me doubt what you base your rent prices on.\"</p><br/><p>Then, without saying anything else, he stood up. He now had to solicit opinions from the crowd of shop owners. \"You know the situation now. Director Liu says twenty percent. What do you think?\"</p><br/><p>As the saying goes, leave no man behind, only leave places behind.</p><br/><p>He didn't mind the rent increase but their method of increasing rent was a little absurd. Even if they managed to come to a consensus this time, it might happen again in future.</p><br/><p>Cloud Street's visitor flow was increasing day by day and it was obvious to anyone.</p><br/><p>They only had one opportunity with Tian Hong Commercial Street. If they missed it, even if they want to move again in future, the conditions may not be as favorable. The shops may not even be available anymore by then.</p><br/><p>The shop owners looked at each other.</p><br/><p>They knew Little Boss was asking for their opinions.</p><br/><p>This matter didn't affect Little Boss much at all, yet, Little Boss had been fighting for the best deal for them all this while.</p><br/><p>They were touched.</p><br/><p>\"Little Boss, if we move, would you move with us?\" asked Elder Liang.</p><br/><p>The crowd looked at Little Boss as if he was their pillar. They would follow whatever the Little Boss wanted.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded. \"Having a change of location isn't a bad thing. At least something like this won't pop up again in future.\"</p><br/><p>After that confirmation from Little Boss, the crowd started discussing intently.</p><br/><p>\"Tian Hong Commercial Street is offering a year of free rent and after that, the rent increase will be very regular as well. It seems pretty good.\"</p><br/><p>\"I've run my shop here for three years. The total money I've spent on renovations add up to seventy or eighty thousand. But now, times are changing fast and my shop decorations are a little behind the times. If we change to a new place, I can do a proper renovation again.\"</p><br/><p>\"Xin Yu Corporation's rent increase has always been unreasonable. This time, they may have given in but if they increase the rent unreasonably again next time, we'll have no place to go.\"</p><br/><p>\"It's so hard to decide.\"</p><br/><p>Some of the shop owners were struggling to decide but most of them had come to a common conclusion and that was to move.</p><br/><p>The surrounding townsfolk felt that this wasn't right. How could they bear to see Little Boss leave? So they started to try to dissuade them.</p><br/><p>\"Don't leave. We've known each other for so long.\"</p><br/><p>\"Yeah, if you all leave, where will we shop?\"</p><br/><p>\"Hey Director Liu, can't you lower it a little more? Or don't even increase the rent. Just slowly increase the rent appropriately from now on. I don't even know what your company's management is thinking. All these rent increases, did they calculate them using their feet or something?\"</p><br/><p>Liu Qiang Guo was dumbfounded. Previously, Master Lin had compromised and agreed to thirty percent. But now, he won't even agree to twenty percent.</p><br/><p>If he had known it would turn out like this, he would've stopped earlier and agreed to thirty percent. Then, things would never have turned out this way.</p><br/><p>\"Master Lin, can we discuss a little more?\" said Liu Guo Qiang.</p><br/><p>In Lin Fan's mind, there was nothing to discuss. Everyone had their own views. Now that good choice had emerged, why not just choose properly?</p><br/><p>But when Lin Fan didn't reply, Zhu Xiu Qin spoke, \"Until now, Director Liu, I still have the same sentiment. Xin Yu Corporation won't compromise with anyone. Hasn't Tian Hong Commercial Street already made an offering? Let them go then. From what I know, the visitor flow there is not even half of Cloud Street's. I don't care if you all believe me, but that's all I have to say. Don't regret your decision.\"</p><br/><p>Liu Guo Qiang glanced at Zhu Xiu Qin as he cursed her in his heart. Is this woman retarded? She's simply a sh*t stirrer. Does she still not understand the current situation?</p><br/><p>He admitted that the Tian Hong Commercial Street didn't have much visitor flow since it was newly constructed but he now believed that the reason that Cloud Street had been able to come back from the dead had much to do with Master Lin. It could even be said to be Master Lin's work.</p><br/><p>If he goes to Tian Hong Commercial Street, wouldn't the people flow increase there as well?</p><br/><p>Lin Fan clapped his hands. \"Alright, that's that then. Let's sign the contract, everybody. In five days, we'll move over. Don't worry, Director Liu, we won't delay your time for another day.\"</p><br/><p>Zhu Xiu Qin chuckled, \"Even if you want to delay us, you won't be able to.\"</p><br/><p>Liu Guo Qiang was really furious. \"Director Zhu, can you not talk anymore? This situation has come to this because of you. Don't you have any idea what's going on at all?\"</p><br/><p>Zhu Xiu Qin raised her eyebrows. \"What do you mean, Liu Guo Qiang? I'm just working in accordance with our company's regulations. Are there any problems with that?\"</p><br/><p>\"I\u2026\" Liu Guo Qiang was speechless.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Lin Fan made a call.</p><br/><p>\"Chief Huang, we've just agreed on the matter. If possible, let's draw up a contract tomorrow.\"</p><br/><p>Chief Huang replied happily, \"Okay, okay. Don't worry, Master Lin. We'll handle this matter beautifully. Please pass on a message to the Cloud Street business owners for me: Tian Hong Commercial Street welcomes them.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed, \"For sure, for sure.\"</p><br/><p>Then, he hung up.</p><br/><p>\"Excuse us, Director Liu,\" said Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Liu Guo Qiang still wanted to urge them to stay. \"Master Lin, is there really no way we can discuss anymore?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fn smiled and said, \"I've made the call and informed the other party already. If I take back my offer, wouldn't I be playing around with him?\"</p><br/><p>...</p><br/>\n</div>"}

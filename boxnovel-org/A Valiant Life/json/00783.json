After paying the deposit for the items, he only had to wait for the goods to arrive.</p><br/><p>In the car.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian said enviously, \u201cYou\u2019re really quite famous. Someone would recognize you everywhere we went today. Their service was really impressive.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled, \u201cYou must be feeling proud after following me around.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian replied, \u201cYeah, I really did feel proud.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang was the one driving and Lin Fan was looking at Weibo on his phone.</p><br/><p>Then, he realized that someone with the ID \u2018happy migrant worker\u2019 send him a lot of private messages.</p><br/><p>He opened his inbox to read the messages.</p><br/><p>\u201cHi, Master Lin. I am your fan and I would like to seek your help.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI am really helpless. I am only twenty-seven years old and I\u2019ve been working in Shanghai for a year. It\u2019s almost the Lunar New Year but I haven\u2019t been able to get my salary. It\u2019s not just me without it. There are a lot of people without it too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, you might not have seen this message. But I can only discuss it with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>He sent several messages to him.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan furrowed his brows in helplessness. This man was his fan and he sent him so many messages to request for his help. He couldn\u2019t have just sat there and not do anything about it.</p><br/><p>No way, since he had encountered this, he had to do something about this.</p><br/><p>He looked at the phone number that was left behind and dialed it immediately.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello, who is this?\u201d The person on the phone sounded young and hoarse. He sounded as if he just had an argument.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am Master Lin. I just saw your messages. Where are you now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh? Master Lin? You\u2019re really Master Lin?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s me. Where are you now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, I am at Chao Hai Road.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, wait for me. I\u2019ll be there.\u201d</p><br/><p>He hung up the phone.</p><br/><p>The young man was extremely excited.</p><br/><p>After a moment, he saw a group of people standing on the sidewalks of the pavement.</p><br/><p>They were wearing dirty uniforms and they were not young. Most of them were in their thirties or forties and some of them were almost fifty.</p><br/><p>\u201cSigh, the construction site isn\u2019t giving us money and we can\u2019t go back for New Year now,\u201d one of the middle-aged men said helplessly. He looked really pitiful.</p><br/><p>The other migrant workers looked the same. Some of them were furious and some looked like they were about to cry.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been here for almost a year and I don\u2019t even have any money to go back at the end of the year. How can I have any face to meet my family?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, we\u2019ve looked for them for so many times and they just dismissed us every single time.\u201d</p><br/><p>One of the young men said, \u201cWait for a moment. I just received Master Lin\u2019s call. He said he\u2019ll be here in a moment. He will definitely be able to help us.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, Young Zhao, don\u2019t be so obsessed with these \u2018idols\u2019. They\u2019re all fake and none of them will help us.\u201d</p><br/><p>Young Zhao said, \u201cNo, Master Lin is not the same as them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, Young Zhao was excited by a voice that he heard.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhich one of you is \u2018happy migrant worker\u2019?\u201d Lin Fan asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, that\u2019s me.\u201d Young Zhao went forward and was so ecstatic that he wanted to jump about.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan and the others exited the car.</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang asked curiously, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you approach the Ministry of Manpower?\u201d</p><br/><p>Young Zhao said helplessly, \u201cWe went there a long time ago but they asked us to look for those that are responsible for this project. How could we find them? Furthermore, we don\u2019t have any proof to claim the salary. The government can\u2019t do anything about it too.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang shook his head, \u201cThis is going to be difficult.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cIt\u2019s not difficult. We can resolve this. I look down on those that don\u2019t give salaries. How can they do this during the Lunar New Year period?\u201d Then, he looked at Young Zhao, \u201cWhere is your construction site? I\u2019ll go there now to ask for it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Young Zhao looked at Master Lin, \u201cIt\u2019s just in front.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go and have a look,\u201d Master Lin said.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>At the construction site near Chao Hai Road.</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan brought the migrant workers to the destination, there were some people in there but they were all blocked from entry.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan heard some things that they said.</p><br/><p>\u201cGive us our salaries. If not, you can forget about leaving today.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, we worked so hard for the entire year for you. You have to pay us.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s almost the Lunar New Year. How are we going to go back like this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Those migrant workers were helpless, \u201cI really don\u2019t have money. The bosses didn\u2019t pay me anything. How can I pay you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease excuse me.\u201d Lin Fan walked towards them after exiting the car. Although he hadn\u2019t been in this industry before, he had never seen a thing like this happen before.</p><br/><p>The migrant workers looked at Lin Fan and didn\u2019t know who this young man was.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cWhat do you do here?\u201d</p><br/><p>The person looked at Lin Fan, \u201cI am a chief labor contractor. I really have no money. If I had money, I\u2019d definitely give it to them. The bosses didn\u2019t give me any money.\u201d</p><br/><p>Young Zhao went forward, \u201cMaster Lin, he is our chief labor contractor. I know he really doesn\u2019t have money because of the bosses.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded, \u201cChief labor contractor, right? Please tell me the workflow here.\u201d</p><br/><p>The chief labor contractor looked at Young Zhao and looked at the young man in front of him. \u201cI am the chief labor contractor of a few groups of workers. The labor services company is in charge of us. The construction company is in charge of the labor services company and the real estate developers take charge of the construction company. The money is passed down from the different layers. This time, the labor services company really didn\u2019t give me any money. I can\u2019t give them their salaries.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you have the phone number of the labor services company?\u201d Lin Fan asked.</p><br/><p>The chief labor contractor nodded, \u201cYes, yes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGive it to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan dialed the number.</p><br/><p>He used the chief labor contractor\u2019s phone and the person on the phone started to shout even before he said anything.</p><br/><p>\u201cI said it a lot of times. I really don\u2019t have money to give the workers. I\u2019ll pay up after the Lunar New Year.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cHi, I am Master Lin. One of my fans is your worker. You said you don\u2019t have money. Then, who else would have it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin? What Master Lin? I already said I don\u2019t have any money. Do you understand human language? Alright, stop calling me. If you want to keep your job after the New Year, you better keep your mouth shut.\u201d</p><br/><p>*slam*</p><br/><p>The person hung up.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. He didn\u2019t expect the person to have such a bad attitude. \u201cDo you have the number of the construction company?\u201d</p><br/><p>The chief labor contractor shook his head, \u201cNo, the company that pays us is the labor services company. We just do whatever they tell us to do.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhich company is in charge of the land here?\u201d Lin Fan asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Mother Earth Real Estate Corporation,\u201d the chief labor contractor said.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan immediately took out his phone and started searching for the company\u2019s phone number. Then, he dialed it.</p><br/><p>\u201cHi, this is Mother Earth Real Estate Pte Ltd. May I know what would you like to know?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cHi, I am at the plot of land that your company has developed on Chao Hai Road. I would like to find out why you haven\u2019t paid the workers even though the Lunar New Year is almost here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry, I\u2019m not very sure about this. Our company transfers funds on time. Therefore, you should ask the construction company. May I know if you need anything else?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan added, \u201cCan you get your director to speak to me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry, he is currently in a meeting. Also, you need to book an appointment with him to speak to him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cDon\u2019t try to push the blame onto others. I want to speak to your director now. If not, you can face the consequences.\u201d</p><br/><p>The person became silent for a moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease hold on.\u201d</p><br/><p>After a while, the phone call transfer got through.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho is this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI would like to ask why the workers at Chao Hai Road\u2019s construction site are all unpaid.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho are you? What does this have to do with you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cI am Master Lin of Cloud Street. A fan of mine is a worker here. I am asking on his behalf.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin? Oh, I know now. Master Lin of Cloud Street, right? We\u2019re not sure of this matter. We have paid the relevant construction companies. You should ask them about the situation.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan added, \u201cOh, then can I trouble you to contact the construction company to pay these workers?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, I don\u2019t think this matter concerns you, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan added, \u201cYes. It doesn\u2019t concern me but I am a busybody. Can\u2019t I be one?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCrazy.\u201d</p><br/><p>*slam*</p><br/><p>He immediately hung up.</p><br/><p>The surrounding migrant workers looked at Lin Fan and sighed helplessly. It looked like they could do nothing about it.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

He now had a little understanding. It turned out that the Encyclopedia\u2019s mystical boost was so valiant. But as a whole, he still didn\u2019t have a clear idea of its use.</p><br/><p>The young man, Jiang Tao, couldn\u2019t bear to leave. He had cried but after crying, he asked himself what was up with this day. After taking a bath and meeting a stranger, he had blurted out so many heartfelt issues. What was going on?</p><br/><p>But after saying all these, he suddenly realized that he had figured it out. It seemed like a beacon of light was guiding him.</p><br/><p>Jiang Tao said, \u201cBig Bro, do you want to scrub for another session?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled, \u201cScrub what? Don\u2019t you have to go and propose? If I scrub you again, you won\u2019t make it in time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Tao was taken aback. \u201cRight, right.\u201d Then, he sighed, \u201cThis bath has been too strange. But I can\u2019t quite tell what was so strange about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, Jiang Tao left.</p><br/><p>The surrounding back-scrubbers gathered around. \u201cLittle Boss, what did you say to make him cry like that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shrugged. \u201cI didn\u2019t do anything. I just scrubbed his back normally. How would I have known that he would cry? In my opinion, he probably had many things built up in his heart for a long time and wanted to let them out.\u201d</p><br/><p>The crowd nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat makes sense. That\u2019s probably the case.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is the first time I\u2019ve seen something like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI never thought that this young man would have such thoughts. But it looks like he\u2019s going to propose. This is a perfect ending.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at his own two hands and couldn\u2019t help but sigh. Could it be that his hands possessed such demonic powers? This Encyclopedia\u2019s mystical boost was way too perverse. Could it be that it could change the hearts of people, scrub away the darkness in their hearts and expand the light?</p><br/><p>Of course, these were just Lin Fan\u2019s guesses. He still didn\u2019t know the full situation.</p><br/><p>In a certain district.</p><br/><p>Jiang Tao held a bouquet of flowers in his hands. He had just gone to the jewelry shop and spent several months\u2019 worth of his wages on a pair of small diamond rings. Although he had spent so much, he felt that it was worth it. He didn\u2019t feel any loss at all.</p><br/><p>Below the rental apartment, he took out his phone and gave his girlfriend a call.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Hui, come down. I have something to tell you,\u201d said Jiang Tao.</p><br/><p>On the phone, there was no reply for a long while. Then, she opened her mouth and spoke. Her voice was a little panicky and a little frightened.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s talk another time, okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Tao didn\u2019t find it abnormal. He said, \u201cNo, I have to say it today. Otherwise, I won\u2019t be at peace.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll be down in a moment.\u201d</p><br/><p>In the house.</p><br/><p>Xiao Hui put down her phone. She felt a little nervous and a little afraid. When she had come over to Shanghai with Jiang Tao, she had been filled with hope for the future. Although the days were tough, what made her happiest was for the two of them to struggle through the challenges together in Shanghai.</p><br/><p>But two months earlier, she discovered that Jiang Tao had been chatting with another girl that she didn\u2019t know through his phone.</p><br/><p>Moreover, the content of their chats made her frightened and she didn\u2019t dare to believe it.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat should I do?\u201d Xiao Hui sat by the bed and her eyes started turning red but she held back the tears.</p><br/><p>When she had sneakily investigated, she found out that the girl was a Shanghai local and she had a good family background. If Jiang Tao were to be with her, he would have a better future and he wouldn\u2019t have anything to worry about.</p><br/><p>She felt unwilling for this to happen but she had no options. Now that Jiang Tao asked her to go downstairs, it seemed that he was going to dump her.</p><br/><p>Thinking of their past days, she felt her heart shift.</p><br/><p>Downstairs.</p><br/><p>Xiao Hui arrived downstairs.</p><br/><p>Jiang Tao stood in front of Xiao Hui while Xiao Hui had her head lowered as if she was awaiting the final sentence in a trial.</p><br/><p>Neither of them spoke for a while.</p><br/><p>Xiao Hui finally mustered up her courage and said, \u201cI know I\u2019m not beautiful and I\u2019m not much of a help to you. I know, that\u2019s why I\u2019m willing to respect your\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Before she finished her sentence\u2026</p><br/><p>Jiang Tao knelt down on one knee and held the flowers and rings in front of him.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Hui, marry me. I will treat you well for the rest of our lives,\u201d said Jiang Tao.</p><br/><p>\u201cEr!\u201d Xiao Hui was stunned. She stood there staring blankly at him. Under the light, she could see that hopeful expression of Jiang Tao\u2019s. \u201cYou weren\u2019t here to tell me that you don\u2019t want me anymore?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Tao shook his head, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say that. I\u2019m serious. We\u2019ve been together for eleven years. Although I haven\u2019t earned a lot of money, I\u2019ve earned enough for the wedding. From now on, we\u2019ll work hard together and struggle together. Will you be with me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Hui suddenly started crying. Then, she hugged Jiang Tao. \u201cI will. But I saw your chat records with that girl. Didn\u2019t you want to break up with me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was nothing. I went to the bathhouse today and a big bro scrubbed my back. He woke me up with that scrub. I, Jiang Tao, cannot do such an inhumane thing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Hui had thought that Jiang Hui was going to say something else but when he heard Jiang Tao say that he was woken up by a back scrub, she was stunned. She had no idea what to say.</p><br/><p>Back scrub?</p><br/><p>Woke him up by scrubbing?</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>In the bathhouse.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre there any back-scrubbers?\u201d another young man yelled after taking a shower.</p><br/><p>But this young man\u2019s expression was a little dull as if there was something on his mind.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan had nothing to do, so when he heard this customer, he instantly responded. He now had to properly test out what this godly back-scrubbing technique could do.</p><br/><p>Just before, Jiang Tao had made him realize that this godly back-scrubbing technique was quite powerful. But he didn\u2019t know how this person would react.</p><br/><p>\u201cLie down properly\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan went forward. \u201cHey, Brother, is there something bothering you?\u201d</p><br/><p>The young man looked at Lin Fan. \u201cJust scrub my back. What are you being so nosy for?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. Without replying, he started scrubbing.</p><br/><p>Time passed, minute by minute, second by second. That young man suddenly said, \u201cYour technique is pretty good. I can\u2019t take it, let\u2019s scrub my back.\u201d</p><br/><p>The young man was the same as Jiang Tao. He couldn\u2019t resist a change in a \u2018certain part\u2019 of his body. In public, he had to maintain some dignity. He wasn\u2019t shameless enough and he couldn\u2019t face everyone\u2019s surprised looks.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan felt helpless. What was wrong with scrubbing the front? Could it be that scrubbing the front would only cause \u2018that\u2019 to happen and only scrubbing the back would be effective?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cComfortable. It\u2019s really very comfortable.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone looked over once again as they felt that it was bizarre. Before, someone had acted like this. Now, this guy was the same.</p><br/><p>An experienced worker couldn\u2019t help but ask, \u201cKid, is it really that comfortable\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMmm. It\u2019s very comfortable.\u201d The young man nodded. Then, his body shivered as he felt an inexplicable sensation.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026\u201d the young man sighed. He had a very troubled look as if there was sadness in his heart.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cYou\u2019re so young, what\u2019s there to sigh about?\u201d</p><br/><p>This time, the young man wasn\u2019t hostile to Lin Fan. He said, \u201cI have a lot of stress, a lot of troubles. Do you want to listen? I can tell you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled, \u201cSure, tell me.\u201d</p><br/><p>The young man, Wang Yu, said, \u201cI work in sales. Recently, one of my colleagues made me very unhappy. I even have the urge to kill him. Think about it, I work hard every day but all of my achievements are snatched away by him. How could I feel good? He loafs around every day and doesn\u2019t do his work seriously but the manager of our unit is his cousin. Every time the performance assessment comes, the manager credits half of my work to his cousin and just gives him free credit. How could I stand such a thing?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled and said, \u201cSo this is why you\u2019ve been troubled?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Yu nodded, \u201cMmm. Nowadays, I\u2019m unhappy every day. After going back, I even quarrel with my wife. What does a woman like her know about my troubles? She even wants me to go watch movies with her. She doesn\u2019t know that I\u2019m tiring myself to death every day.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Lin Fan scrubbed his back, he felt the Encyclopedia\u2019s mystical powers slowly spreading.</p><br/><p>It was as if it had penetrated Wang Yu\u2019s heart and dispelled that dark cloud inside, illuminating the depths of his heart.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cActually, that\u2019s just how the world is. There are all kinds of people in society. Sometimes, when you think about it, having something to lose is a fortunate thing, not a bad thing. In sales, if you are able to achieve such results, it shows that you are capable. And during work, one can expand one\u2019s horizons and get to know more people. That itself is a kind of fortune that he cannot take from you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s there to quarrel about with your wife? Go watch a movie with her, relax your soul. If you have troubles, then share them with your family. Although they can\u2019t share the load for you, at least they will understand your troubles. It\u2019s not good to bottle up all these emotions in your heart, don\u2019t you think so?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Yu was startled, \u201cHey, you make a lot of sense. I\u2019ve done sales all along because I\u2019ve always wanted to meet more people and accumulate more social connections so that one day, I can go out into the world and seek success. My goal is not to just stay in this little company. Although my achievements have been stolen, my broad connections cannot be taken away.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNow that I think about it, that is true. I\u2019ve been married to my wife for several years already. Ever since I started working this job, it seems that I haven\u2019t gone out alone with her,\u201d Wang Yu sighed.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled, \u201cThat\u2019s why you should open up yourself and spend some time with your family at the movies. Even just having a meal together can lessen a day\u2019s fatigue. Don\u2019t you think so?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, you are very right,\u201d said Wang Yu with a nod, \u201cBig Bro, this is the first time I\u2019ve seen you. I never thought that you would say so much but you even guided me. I feel that I\u2019ve been too ridiculous to my wife lately.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter the bath, I\u2019ll go back and go shopping with my wife. The last time, she said she liked a piece of clothing. When I go back, I\u2019ll buy it for her.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded, \u201cMmm.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, Lin Fan understood.</p><br/><p>It turned out that this godly back-scrubbing skill scrubs away the darkness in people\u2019s hearts and causes them to be more joyful. At the same time, it causes them to remember what is truly important.</p><br/><p>AKA: Brainwashing.</p><br/><p>This skill was pretty awesome.</p></div>\n</div>"}

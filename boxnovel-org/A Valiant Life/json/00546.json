Why do you all look so unhappy? Did something happen?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Mingqing didn\u2019t reply Fraud Tian. He looked at Lin Fan and said, \u201cTeacher, they\u2019re really too abominable. It\u2019s basically a robbery!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did they rob?\u201d Fraud Tian asked curiously.</p><br/><p>Zhao Mingqing said furiously, \u201cWhat else could it be? Of course, it\u2019s the teaching materials written by Teacher. Those guys are simply scum. They didn\u2019t contribute a thing, and yet without any consent at all, they added their own names to Teacher\u2019s teaching materials. I don\u2019t even know how they can be so shameless. I think they probably do this kind of things very often.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian instantly erupted as well, \u201cF*ck, they\u2019re so shameless?</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan came over by the side, angry as well. Brother Lin had painstakingly written those teaching materials and now they had been snatched away by those people. Were they even human?</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian continued, \u201cYou can stand this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was very displeased. \u201cStand my a*s. If these old guys weren\u2019t so old, I would\u2019ve sent my fists flying towards them and beat them to death. I would\u2019ve taught them a lesson long ago. Other people might be able to stand this but not me. Moreover, what they did today seemed to be very familiar to them. It seems that they\u2019ve done it many times before.</p><br/><p>*Ring ring*</p><br/><p>At that moment, Zhao Mingqing\u2019s phone rang.</p><br/><p>Zhao Mingqing took a look and an unpleasant expression appeared on his face. \u201cTeacher, someone from the Education Department is calling.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnswer it,\u201d said Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Upon answering the call, the leader\u2019s voice came through the phone.</p><br/><p>\u201cDirector Zhao, you guys shouldn\u2019t be too rash about this. I am having a meeting with them right now. This is their mistake and I will handle it strictly. Please pass this message to Master Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Mingqing said angrily, \u201cDon\u2019t you think that they are being ridiculous with this matter? Without getting my teacher\u2019s consent, they just sign their own names and even did a pilot distribution. They are basically treating my teacher like nothing.\u201d</p><br/><p>The leader said, \u201cI know. Tell your teacher not to worry. I will definitely get them to give a statement.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Mingqing said, \u201cA statement is fine but now, they need to take back all the pilot distributed teaching materials and remove their names from them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis\u2026 Director Zhao, this has already happened. If we take back the teaching materials now and remove their names, it would be telling everyone that a problem has occurred. You know too, that these specialists and professors care most about their image. If you ask them to do that, it would be like asking for their lives. Why don\u2019t I get them to apologize to Master Lin and you guys just let it go this time? I can guarantee that something like this will not happen again.\u201d The leader was in a very tough spot.</p><br/><p>Why was this Master Lin so hard to handle? If it was someone else, they would\u2019ve been able to talk it through long ago. After all, having only his name on the teaching materials wasn\u2019t even as good as having those senior professors and specialists undertake it as well.</p><br/><p>Also, it would bring even more benefits. For example, his status would be raised and he would increase his standing. This was something that everyone was chasing.</p><br/><p>He never expected that this guy would be so stubborn.</p><br/><p>Zhao Mingqing\u2019s eyes squinted a little. He couldn\u2019t believe it. \u201cEven you approve of this?\u201d</p><br/><p>The leader was a little embarrassed. It wasn\u2019t that he approved of it but it had already become a rule.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan didn\u2019t want to hear these guys\u2019 bullshit anymore. \u201cHang up. Tell them to just wait for things to get blown up.\u201d</p><br/><p>When the leader heard Lin Fan\u2019s voice, he said, \u201cMaster Lin, don\u2019t be rash\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Mingqing didn\u2019t say much. He immediately hung up. If his teacher said to hang up, then he would hang up, there was no need to consider.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, what should we do now?\u201d asked Zhao Mingqing.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled, \u201cThey want to play, right? Then we\u2019ll slowly play with them. I want to see what they can do to me. They dare to snatch my things, do they really think I\u2019m so easy to bully?\u201d</p><br/><p>He opened his Weibo.</p><br/><p>He was going to announce this matter publicly. He didn\u2019t care what kind of backing they had. They had already pissed him off completely.</p><br/><p>\u201cToday, a disgusting thing happened. The three books of teaching materials that I wrote actually got signed by other people without my knowledge. They even did a pilot distribution of the teaching materials. This matter is extremely abominable. They used intimidation and bribery but they couldn\u2019t make me give in. Moreover, the Education Department\u2019s leader, without considering his responsibility, said that this is a very normal situation. He said that as long as I agreed, I would be compensated. I don\u2019t want any sh*tty compensations. Today, I have revealed the truth. Who knows how many talented young people have already been robbed of their achievements\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan fingers rained upon his phone as he typed a long post. At the same time, he told Zhao Mingqing to find out the ten names that were signed on his teaching materials and he added them to his post.</p><br/><p>Sent!</p><br/><p>After this Weibo post had been sent.</p><br/><p>It immediately captured the attention of the netizen.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, Master Lin has made a Weibo post. It looks like a shady incident has happened.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cChinese medicine teaching materials written by Master Lin were signed in by other people. That\u2019s too f*cking despicable.\u201d,</p><br/><p>Professor Yang, Yang Lian Hua. Isn\u2019t this a specialist from the older generation? I\u2019ve read a Chinese medicine book written by him before.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, that\u2019s shameless. They actually dare to do such a thing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin has exposed a shady incident once again. Moreover, this incident happened to himself.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Mingqing asked curiously, \u201cTeacher, is there any use of posting this on Weibo?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled, \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t there be any use? This is the era of the Internet. This is the fastest method of spreading the news.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhongyang said, \u201cBrother Lin, I\u2019ll announce it too. We have to blow this matter up.\u201d</p><br/><p>In the conference room, the group of people hadn\u2019t left yet. They were still discussing this matter.</p><br/><p>But suddenly\u2026</p><br/><p>One of the specialists cried out in shock, \u201cQuick, look at Weibo. That kid has gone crazy!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone else didn\u2019t know what had happened. But when they opened their Weibos, they were all dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this guy trying to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe actually put it on the Internet. Does he want us to lose all our standings and reputations?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are we going to do, Professor Yang? Even the leader has been named.\u201d</p><br/><p>When the Education Department\u2019s leader saw this news, he was taken aback as well. He roared, \u201cHow dare he?\u201d</p><br/><p>Professor Yang\u2019s face was pale and green as if he had never expected this to happen. Then, he looked at the leader, \u201cWhat do we do now?\u201d</p><br/><p>The leader hastily called Zhao Mingqing. But with a \u2018beep beep\u2019 sound, the call was hung up.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is that Zhao Mingqing thinking? He even dares to hang up on me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Professor Yang had a grave look on his face as he said, \u201cDon\u2019t panic. He was the only one to speak out about this, will other people believe him just like that? We made changes to his teaching materials, is there anything wrong with us signing our names on them?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is what we\u2019ll do, we\u2019ll immediately speak out and using our influence, we\u2019ll definitely suppress this matter.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis kid really doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s good for him. Doesn\u2019t he know how big of an impact this could cause?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph!\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, there was carnage on the Internet. This matter instantly exploded.</p><br/><p>The speed at which everything happened had left everyone at a loss.</p></div>\n</div>"}

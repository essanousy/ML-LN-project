However, to Lin Fan, it was just a small thing and not a problem at all.</p><br/><p>He kept the needles.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan started to write down the prescription and then he said, \u201cThis is the prescription. As long as you continue to take it for a month, the problem will be easily solved and will never come back.\u201d</p><br/><p>Brother Qiang was feeling good. When the godly doctor was using the needles on her, she felt pretty weird. It was hard to describe the feeling but it was a comfortable one.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you very much, godly doctor,\u201d Brother Qiang Qiang said very gratefully.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved her off and said, \u201cIt was no big deal. If there\u2019s nothing else, I\u2019ll be taking my leave. As long as you follow the prescription, I guarantee no problems will occur.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGodly doctor, if you may, can you leave me your phone number?\u201d Brother Qiang Qiang asked. She wanted to make sure that she had someone to turn to if she ran into some weird problems during her transformation.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust follow me on Weibo and if there is anything, just message me. I\u2019ll reply as soon as I see it,\u201d Lin Fan smiled and said. He had no relation with this Brother Qiang Qiang so he did not feel the need to give her his number. However, by asking her to follow him, he had gained himself another enthusiastic follower, something money cannot buy.</p><br/><p>After leaving Brother Qiang Qiang, Lin Fan returned to the private room to enjoy his time with his classmates.</p><br/><p>They had no idea when the next gathering would be so they had to treasure the time they had right now.</p><br/><p>The next day, Lin Fan and the rest of them left early in the morning for a different town. The news of Jiangning\u2019s godly doctor had spread around. Thus, the news of him leaving Jiangning was also widely known. The good thing about this was that whatever city he was going to next already knew about him.</p><br/><p>Those people who were sick and yet to receive medical treatment all rushed to find a car and search for the Godly Doctor. When the people in Jiangning got treated by the Godly Doctor, they all started to get better. This drew the attention of reporters who brought some of the Godly doctor\u2019s cured patients to the hospital for checkups. When the results came out, everyone was stunned.</p><br/><p>Their condition had turned for the better. This definitely made them all very surprised.</p><br/><p>A few days passed. The entire country\u2019s social media network was going crazy.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mm, this is too amazing. This world actually still has this kind of Godly Doctor?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe can\u2019t possibly fake this. The Godly Doctor has arrived in Hangzhou. We should go there and welcome him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAs of right now, the rate of people being discharged from all the major hospitals is at an all-time high. Also, there are many people hiring vehicles to send them to the town which the Godly Doctor is in. In fact, there are rumors that there aren\u2019t enough cars to meet the demand.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTraditional Chinese Medicine doctors are all the rage now. However, there are many imposters trying to scam people, who have been caught already.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre these Traditional Chinese Medicine doctors really that good? Right now the only one I trust is the Godly Doctor.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRecently, there was a patient who revealed that he had cancer. Apparently, his cancer was healed by the Godly Doctor.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, for real?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have no idea, but it seems legit. Everyone in the country is buzzing about it. Some think it\u2019s not possible, some think it is. In any case, they have been divided into the two extremes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMany hospitals have come out releasing statements, all saying the traditional Chinese medicine can\u2019t cure cancer.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnyway, we should not care so much about this. Recently the whole country\u2019s patients have gone crazy. If you check out the tickets for the high-speed rail as well as for airplanes heading to Hangzhou, getting a ticket is almost impossible. Even the ticket resellers don\u2019t even have any stock left.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is too much\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan had brought Zhao Ming Qing and the rest of them to many different cities and their influence was being bigger and bigger.</p><br/><p>It was so chaotic to the extent that the police had to come and control it.</p><br/><p>When Zhao Ming Qing, Qiu Jie, Zhang Tong Tong and the rest of them encountered this situation, they were all dumbfounded. They felt like this was a game show or something.</p><br/><p>However, when they looked at Master Lin, he looked calm and collected, like he was not really concerned about what was happening.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing had reminded his teacher before to take it easy and not be so high profile. However, Lin Fan had already made Chinese medicine soar to new heights. He simply could not undo it.</p><br/><p>However, to Lin Fan, he was very indifferent about this. Healing sick people was a good thing, so why was there a need to take it back?</p><br/><p>Anyway, as long as he worked hard it would be fine.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was sure that this time, he would complete his task and he would be able to unlock the next page of knowledge. He felt really good inside when he thought about entering a new profession.</p><br/><p>He had to keep changing to keep life interesting.</p><br/><p>At a hotel in Jiangning.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Qiang Qiang\u2026\u201d a beautiful lady said as she came along. She started to smile even brighter when she saw Brother Qiang Qiang.</p><br/><p>Brother Qiang Qiang sat in the room with a smile on her face. She had been taking the prescription that the Godly Doctor had given and felt the results were pretty good. The girl sweetly said to her, \u201cBrother Qiang Qiang, it\u2019s been a long time since you\u2019ve come to find me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Brother Qiang Qiang laughed. Her soft, tender hands touched the girl\u2019s face. The girl\u2019s natural reaction was to go in for a kiss. If it was like before, brother Qiang Qiang would have gone in for the kiss also. However, she inexplicably felt really disgusted inside and did not like it when she saw it.</p><br/><p>She had no idea what was going on. She had never experienced anything like that. However, when she remembered what the Godly Doctor told her about the medicine\u2019s side effects, she felt more relieved. Could this be one of the side effects?</p><br/><p>Brother Qiang Qiang did not kiss her but smiled and said, \u201cOk, go and play by yourself, I\u2019ll look for you tonight.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph,\u201d the little girl acted like she was unhappy but still obeyed.</p><br/><p>Ding ding~</p><br/><p>A phone call came. Brother Qiang Qiang looked at the phone and her brows furrowed. She looked very displeased but still picked up the phone. She said with a displeased tone, \u201cHello, what do you want?\u201d</p><br/><p>There was a moment of silence on the other side of the call before he responded, \u201cIs this how you speak to your father?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, if you have something to say, just say it, I\u2019m very busy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLiu Xu, you\u2019re my daughter. Look what you\u2019ve turned into. This is not up for discussion. I\u2019ve found you a doctor and we are going to get you cured.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Xu laughed and said, \u201cNo need. I\u2019ve already gone to the Godly Doctor. The Godly Doctor has given me medication and once I finish it, I won\u2019t be able to change anymore. Father, you\u2019re old already, don\u2019t need to worry about me. Also, didn\u2019t you regret not having a son last time? In a while, you\u2019ll have a son.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p><em>Clatter</em></p><br/><p>Liu Xu hung up. Then, she went online to start finding a new name. When the prescription was finished, she would have to find a new name as this Liu Xu would not really suit her anymore.</p><br/><p>She thought of calling her self Liu Ying Hao or Liu Cheng. Both of them were not bad.</p><br/><p>However, she did not feel very good inside. She had such feelings of disgust towards the girl just now. Her voice was beginning to feminize also which was hard for her to take as she did not know when these symptoms would fade away.</p><br/><p>Time gradually passed.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was already the final city. The final hospital in the final city.</p><br/><p>\u201cFinally going to be done,\u201d Lin Fan said. This period of time had let Lin Fan realize what true pain was.</p><br/><p>Every day, having to see countless sick people, some of which was pretty terrifying.</p><br/><p>He was seeing a few hundred patients everyday, leaving no time for him to rest at all.</p><br/><p>But now, this whole thing was coming to a close.</p><br/><p>Right in front of him was the last patient.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, here is the prescription. Your condition will slowly improve,\u201d Lin Fan smiled and said.</p><br/><p>The patient was very grateful and replied, \u201cThank you, Godly Doctor.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing, who was standing by his side, said, \u201cMaster, we\u2019re finally done.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded and said, \u201cIt is. We will return to Shanghai tomorrow, our 20-day voluntary medical work is over. Did you gain a lot from it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing happily nodded and said, \u201cMaster, I gained a lot. I never thought I would ever have a day like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha,\u201d Lin Fan laughed. But suddenly, his smile disappeared.</p><br/><p>The notification from the encyclopedia came.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome on, my eleventh page of knowledge. I\u2019ve been waiting for you for a long time.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

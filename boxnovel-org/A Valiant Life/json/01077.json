Even the headlines on Weibo had been bought.</p><br/><p>Feiyue Entertainment Company had prepared amply to pave a way for Wang Mei Tian.</p><br/><p>Some of the netizens saw the news on the Internet and were stunned. They didn\u2019t quite understand what was up with this news.</p><br/><p>\u2018Wu Huan Yue isn\u2019t releasing albums, Master Lin has run out of ideas. Let us wait in anticipation for Wang Mei Tian\u2019s new album.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Songs composed by the collaborative efforts of ten top masters will soon be materialized.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Wang Mei Tian\u2019s voice is on par with Wu Huan Yue\u2019s.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018The new generation\u2019s musical star, Wang Mei Tian, will soon be releasing her new album.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn. What\u2019s going on? Why did all these news articles suddenly appear overnight? Are they trying to step over Master Lin and Wu Huan Yue?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, our Mei Tian is really too strong.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin? Wu Huan Yue? Just crush them completely.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWu Huan Yue hasn\u2019t released an album in a long time. Could it be that Master Lin has really run out of ideas?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s rubbish. How is that possible? Wu Huan Yue hasn\u2019t been releasing albums because she has been shooting films. How would she have the time to make new albums?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBullsh*t. I think she doesn\u2019t have any good songs. Think about how many good songs Master Lin has come up with in the past. I\u2019m afraid that he has already used up all of his songs.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut who is this Wang Mei Tian? Do any of you know her?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGo and do a search on the Internet. She\u2019s the champion of the latest season of \u2018The New Voice\u2019. She has quite a lot of fans.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cloud Street!</p><br/><p>Just as Lin Fan had finished making his scallion pancakes and was sitting there to rest, he realized that Wu You Lan appeared angry as she looked at her phone. He asked curiously, \u201cYou Lan, what have you seen now? Why are you so angry?\u201d</p><br/><p>He was really curious as he wondered what kind of news had made Wu You Lan this angry. It was really peculiar.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Lin, look at this news. Aren\u2019t they trying to step over Huan Yue and you in order to rise to fame?\u201d Wu You Lan hurriedly brought her phone over and put it in front of Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the news and made an amused expression. He felt that it was really strange. He was even given a shock.</p><br/><p>It was as if he had been shot while lying on the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cThese guys are a little unbridled,\u201d said Lin Fan with a sigh. He hadn\u2019t expected that someone would use him as a stepping stone. It was truly strange.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan nodded. \u201cThey\u2019re not just a little unbridled. They\u2019re extremely unbridled.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Lin, look at this Wang Mei Tian\u2019s Weibo. She\u2019s even replying to her fans and saying that you\u2019re already done and you can\u2019t compose any more good songs for Wu Huan Yue. Look,\u201d said Wu You Lan as she pointed at her phone.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan took a look. These comments were really interesting.</p><br/><p>Fans: \u201cIdol, do you think Master Lin is done? And is Wu Huan Yue shooting films because she knows that she won\u2019t get any more good songs?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Mei Tian: \u201cThat\u2019s right. Your guess is spot on. Master Lin\u2019s songs are all decent but he can\u2019t compose any more songs like before. This time, I have ten masters collaborating to compose classics for me. They\u2019ll be released in a while. I hope that you all will support me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fans: \u201cYes, we will definitely support you.\u201d</p><br/><p>But Lin Fan saw that some of his fans were going over there to flame her too. At the same time, he saw that his Chief of Internet Trolls was bravely waging war in the comments section too.</p><br/><p>Although he had already been outnumbered and surrounded, he wasn\u2019t panicking at all. He was calmly breaking through their defense.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan didn\u2019t bother about all this. Instead, he took out the songs from his drawer. \u201cI\u2019m going out for a bit.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan asked, \u201cBrother Lin, where are you going?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved that piece of paper in his hand. \u201cThese are songs that I wrote yesterday. I\u2019m going to bring them over to Wang Ming Yang. I didn\u2019t think that, just when I started writing songs, news related to this would suddenly appear. It\u2019s really strange.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang laughed. \u201cWhen these songs are released, they\u2019ll probably be astounded.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian shook his head. \u201cWhy are there still people in this world who would go against you? Aren\u2019t they just asking for trouble?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled and didn\u2019t say more. He just drove his car and set off towards Wang Ming Yang\u2019s location.</p><br/><p>Eastern Han Group.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang was looking at the news on the Internet and feeling very displeased. He knew about this Feiyue Entertainment Company and he had interacted with them before.</p><br/><p>Then, he made a call to them.</p><br/><p>\u201cChief Chen, you\u2019re going overboard, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Wang Ming Yang said right off the bat.</p><br/><p>Chief Chen said in a surprised tone, \u201cChief Wang, I don\u2019t quite understand what you\u2019re saying. How am I going overboard?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang said, \u201cYou\u2019re still pretending. Don\u2019t you know about the news on the Internet? Don\u2019t you think that it\u2019s bad to step over others?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Chen then realized what was going on. \u201cOh, so that\u2019s what Chief Wang is talking about. I didn\u2019t know about that either. But I wasn\u2019t meaning to step over you. This is all a misunderstanding.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck. Can\u2019t you speak properly? You even stepped over my brother. You must not want to f*cking live anymore, you piece of sh*t.\u201d Wang Ming Yang had been able to control his temper at first but now, he was just cursing and swearing over the phone, not giving any respect to the opposition.</p><br/><p>Chief Chen\u2019s expression instantly changed. \u201cChief Wang, what are you saying? Why are you scolding me? Don\u2019t you have any morals?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck your mom. You better not let me see you. Otherwise, I\u2019ll knock all of your teeth out. You\u2019re even trying to create hype by saying that my brother is done for. I think you must have gone blind.\u201d Wang Ming Yang was just raging. He felt as if he wouldn\u2019t be satisfied if he didn\u2019t release his anger on this guy.</p><br/><p>Although this Feiyue Entertainment Company was quite powerful, he wasn\u2019t afraid. They could come at him if they wanted. He wasn\u2019t afraid.</p><br/><p>*Clatter!*</p><br/><p>The opposite party hung up. It seemed that he couldn\u2019t take Wang Ming Yang\u2019s scolding anymore.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph. You\u2019re lucky that you hung up fast enough. Otherwise, I would scold you to death.\u201d Wang Ming Yang took one last look at his phone before looking away. He was furious about this incident. He hadn\u2019t expected that he would get stepped on by others. This feeling really made him upset.</p><br/><p>If they had only talked about Wu Huan Yue leaving the musical industry, he would\u2019ve been able to stand it. But now, they were saying that his brother was done for. He couldn\u2019t f*cking stand such a thing.</p><br/><p>If he didn\u2019t give the opposition a good scolding, his name wouldn\u2019t be Wang Ming Yang.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Lin Fan walked over. \u201cMing Yang, what are you doing? I heard you scolding someone from far away.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang heard his voice and was delighted. \u201cBrother, you\u2019re here. Come, quick. These people are too unbridled. I just scolded them directly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. \u201cSigh, we have to take this slow. There\u2019s no hurry. When will Huan Yue be back?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang said, \u201cShe\u2019ll be back tomorrow. How are those songs?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cI rushed them out overnight. I\u2019m dying of fatigue. Hurry up and move aside. Let me sit down and rest.\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

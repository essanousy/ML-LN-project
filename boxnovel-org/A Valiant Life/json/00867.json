It looked like that was the only place he could spend the night at. Lin Fan was exhausted from driving for the entire day.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-1\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>*Knock knock*</p><br/><p>\u201cIs there anyone in there?\u201d Lin Fan knocked and shouted.</p><br/><p>After a rather long wait, it was as if the person inside had mustered his courage to speak. He looked at Lin Fan who was standing in a distance away and spoke softly, \u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Although it was pretty dark, he realized that he was actually speaking to a kid. Furthermore, he looked like he was only eleven or twelve years of age.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey little boy, I drove for the entire day today. Are your parents home?\u201d Lin Fan asked.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan realized that the child was a little defensive. However, it was logical for him to be acting that way since it was late at night and he was speaking to a stranger.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-2\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>However, Lin Fan felt that the kid probably thought that he was trying to con him.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just that I would like to spend the night here. I drove for the entire day and I\u2019m exhausted. I can pay you for it. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m not a baddie,\u201d Lin Fan tried to speak nicely.</p><br/><p>The boy hesitated for a moment after hearing what he said. Then, he asked softly, \u201cHow much can you pay?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow about $200?\u201d Lin Fan was really helpless. It looked like this kid loved money. However, he felt thankful to have found a place to stay at. He wasn\u2019t really bothered by the cost.</p><br/><p>The boy was ecstatic after hearing what he said. He immediately rushed to the door. However, just before he opened the door, he asked, \u201cYou\u2019re not a bad guy, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan didn\u2019t want to talk too much. \u201cLittle boy, if I was a bad guy, do you think this wooden door can withstand my kick?\u201d</p><br/><p>The boy thought about it for a moment and felt that what he said was true. Then, he opened the door, \u201cAlright. I\u2019m alone at home. You can come in.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan heaved a sigh of relief. He finally managed to convince this kid. Although he was young, he was pretty vigilant.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle boy, what is your name?\u201d Lin Fan smiled and asked.</p><br/><p>The little boy looked at Lin Fan, \u201cI am Yang Yuan, what about you?\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-3\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled, \u201cYou can just call me Uncle Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Yang Yuan nodded. \u201cUncle Lin, my parents aren\u2019t home. You can take this room.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright,\u201d Lin Fan nodded. He looked around the simple environment. It didn\u2019t look like he was from a rich family. He felt a little hungry and took out $300. \u201cI\u2019ll pay you $200 for the room and $100 to use your appliance to cook something.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yang Yuan looked at the red dollar bills and was a little stunned. It was as if he was thinking if he should accept it. Then, he immediately grabbed the $300. \u201cUncle Lin, wait. I\u2019ll cook something for you. I only have noodles at home. Are you okay with that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled, \u201cSure.\u201d</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t expect this kid to know how to cook.</p><br/><p>When Yang Yuan went to the kitchen, he just sat on the stool and waited patiently.</p><br/><p>He looked at the family portrait on the wall.</p><br/><p>There were five people in the picture. This kid was the middle child.</p><br/><p>However, he was puzzled as the kid was alone at home.</p><br/><p>After a short while, Yang Yuan held a bowl of egg noodles and walked over.</p><br/><p>\u201cUncle Lin, I am done. You can eat now,\u201d Yang Yuan said.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-4\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the noodles and smiled, \u201cIt looks good.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yang Yuan lowered his head and said humbly, \u201cThank you, Uncle Lin, for your compliment.\u201d</p><br/><p>After Lin Fan finished the bowl of noodles, Yang Yuan immediately washed the cutlery and bowl.</p><br/><p>After driving for the entire day, he was really exhausted.</p><br/><p>The next day!</p><br/><p>*knock, knock*</p><br/><p>\u201cUncle Lin, it\u2019s time for breakfast!\u201d Yang Yuan knocked on the door at 6 am in the morning.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan opened his eyes and looked at his phone. He didn\u2019t expect it to be 6 am already. He wore his clothes and went out of the room. Yang Yuan had prepared breakfast for him. There were porridge, pickled vegetables and two eggs on the table.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan felt that his $300 was really well spent. Then, he sat down and started eating.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you eating?\u201d Lin Fan looked at Yang Yuan and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait, I have to keep the eggs,\u201d Yang Yuan said.</p><br/><p>After a while, Lin Fan saw that Yang Yuan was carrying a few eggs in his hands. He walked over carefully and opened the cupboard to place the eggs in a basket.</p><br/><p>There were quite a lot of eggs in the basket. However, Lin Fan realized that some of them were rotten. He became even more curious.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere are your parents?\u201d Lin Fan asked.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-5\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>It was bizarre for a kid like him to be living alone.</p><br/><p>Yang Yuan closed the cupboard and said, \u201cMy parents took my brother to the city to treat his illness. I\u2019m the only one at home.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are there so many eggs?\u201d Lin Fan asked.</p><br/><p>Yang Yuan replied, \u201cI\u2019m planning to bring these eggs for my brother when I visit him. My mom said that we have no money. I think my brother must be starving and I\u2019d like him to have these eggs.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was stunned. He didn\u2019t expect it at all. Then, he asked, \u201cWhat illness does he have?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yang Yuan thought about it for a moment and replied, \u201cI don\u2019t really know. It has something to do with some white blood\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnemia,\u201d Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>After eating, Lin Fan packed up and was prepared to leave. Meanwhile, Yang Yuan packed his bag and was prepared to go to school.</p><br/><p>Outside the house.</p><br/><p>Yang Yuan was prepared to go to school while Lin Fan was going to continue his journey.</p><br/><p>\u201cLil\u2019 Yang, do you know who am I?\u201d Lin Fan smiled and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cNope,\u201d Yang Yuan shook his head.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cI\u2019ll tell you a secret but you can\u2019t tell anyone about it. I am actually a deity. Do you believe me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUncle Lin, you\u2019re a liar. My teacher said that there aren\u2019t any deities in this world,\u201d Yang Yuan said.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, looks like I have to show you some skills for you to believe me.\u201d Then, Lin Fan opened his palm.</p><br/><p>Yang Yuan looked at Lin Fan palms and didn\u2019t know what he was going to do.</p><br/><p>However, Yang Yuan\u2019s mouth widened in shock.</p><br/><p>The air on his palm suddenly turned into ice.</p><br/><p>With Lin Fan\u2019s Wuxia major classification knowledge, this was an easy task.</p><br/><p>He condensed the water vapor in the air and formed ice in his hand.</p><br/><p>Yang Yuan\u2019s mouth opened even wider in disbelief.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled and touched the icicles floating which broke the icicles. \u201cDo you believe me now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yang Yuan nodded immediately, \u201cUncle Lin, are you really a deity?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, why would I lie to you? Didn\u2019t you say that your brother is sick? I have an elixir for you. You can help your brother become healthy again. However, you have to promise me one thing,\u201d Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>Yang Yuan immediately nodded after hearing that his brother could be cured. \u201cUncle Lin, I will definitely promise you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright. Don\u2019t tell anyone that I am a deity. Okay?\u201d Lin Fan gently touched his head and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, I won\u2019t tell anyone about it,\u201d Yang Yuan nodded seriously.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay. I believe you. You can have this elixir. Please keep it and do not lose it. Okay?\u201d Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>Yang Yuan nodded, \u201cYeah, I won\u2019t lose it.\u201d</p><br/><p>After that, Lin Fan waved to Yang Yuan and drove off.</p><br/><p>It was just a simple incident to Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>To Lin Fan, this was a small matter. However, to others, this was something major as he just saved someone\u2019s life.</p></div>\n</div>"}

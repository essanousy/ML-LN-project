Although he acted politely when he left, he was definitely cursing Lin Fan's mother in his heart.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was guessing how this fella would curse him.</p><br/><p>Old f*cker?</p><br/><p>No, I'm still young. He's definitely calling me an ignorant little brat.</p><br/><p>That's more likely.</p><br/><p>Lil' Wu, who was standing outside the shop, started to speak, \"Master Lin, you're really leaving?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled when he saw his expression. \"Should be. I guess I'll be leaving Cloud Street.\"</p><br/><p>\"Huh?!\" Lil' Wu's jaw widened in disbelief. He couldn't bear for Lin Fan to leave. Why did he want to leave?</p><br/><p>\"Where are you planning to go?\" He had to ask clearly. He wanted to know if it was far away from his workplace. If it wasn't far, he could move there too. Anyway, transport would be convenient and the train service could ferry him to work punctually.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled, \"I don't know about that yet. I haven't selected a place.\"</p><br/><p>Lil' Wu didn't ask much after that. He just looked like he couldn't bear for Lin Fan to leave. Then, he told the people in the WeChat group about what he had just witnessed.</p><br/><p>The members in the group were shocked.</p><br/><p>\"D*mn! That's ruthless. A 100% increase? He's literally forcing every shop owner to leave.\"</p><br/><p>\"I won't even say anything else about this. I can only say that Little Boss is awesome. No matter where he moves to, I will definitely support him. If it is somewhere far away, I will make time to go and have a look whenever I can.\"</p><br/><p>\"What is Little Boss trying to do? Didn't the man mention that he wouldn't be charged a single cent? Why did he still kick up a big fuss about it?\"</p><br/><p>\"That's incorrect. You should know how Little Boss is like. He's not someone that's after such things. He's doing this simply because the other party went overboard.\"</p><br/><p>\"In the past, Cloud Street didn't seem so crowded. Things only improved after Little Boss came. Now that they've decided to increase rental fees, it's such an ugly sight to see.\"</p><br/><p>\"Yeah, if not for Little Boss, I wouldn't have gone to Cloud Street. I've been there every single day for the past two months. I've made friends with the other shop owners. Now that there is an ongoing conflict about the increase in rental fees, I definitely stand by them.\"</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian looked at Lin Fan. \"It's obvious that the person that came earlier wants to keep you here. They want to double the rental fees to make a big sum of money.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled, \"Can I let him get what he wants? Sure, only if I'm a fool.\"</p><br/><p>The other shop owners gathered around. Little Boss was their only hope. They were all very helpless. If they weren't forced to leave, they wouldn't have thought of leaving the place at all.</p><br/><p>The increment was too much. They were simply being taken advantage of.</p><br/><p>They had even been asked to just leave if they were unhappy with it. Nobody could be spared from it.</p><br/><p>As for Lin Fan, he didn't want to stay any further even if his fees were waived.</p><br/><p>This was an awkward situation after all.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at everyone. \"Everyone, don't worry. I will definitely fight for all of you regarding this. This bloody Xin Yu company wants to take advantage of us. How can we agree to it? The fella told me that only my rental fees will be discounted or waived but I rejected him. Am I someone that can't afford it? He didn't understand why I rejected the offer and came to discuss with me. I have to say that it wasn't well done at all.\"</p><br/><p>The other shop owners remained silent. They just looked at Little Boss.</p><br/><p>They were moved by him.</p><br/><p>At the same time, they were wondering why would a person like Little Boss exist in this world.</p><br/><p>This was something they had not seen before.</p><br/><p>All businessmen were clever. They were well-versed when it comes to relations. Although some shop owners acted like they were living in harmony with the other shop owners, they would grumble about things behind each other's back.</p><br/><p>But they all respected Little Boss.</p><br/><p>If the person told them that their fees would be discounted and waived, it would be extremely difficult for them to not agree to that.</p><br/><p>But now, they were assured that Master Lin was definitely on their side.</p><br/><p>Elder Liang said, \"Little Boss, I've never admired someone so much before. You're the only one that I admire. We will only listen to you regarding this matter.\"</p><br/><p>Elder Zhang said, \"If we really decide to leave this place, we can just take a break for one or two months. It doesn't really affect us. I'm sure we can find a better place.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled, \"Everyone, please do not think of this matter as a bad one. Everything can be changed in a split second.\"</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>At Xin Yu Commercial Real Estate Company.</p><br/><p>Liu Guo Qiang returned and he looked extremely stern. The other employees looked at each other and guessed that the discussion has definitely been unsuccessful. If it had been successful, his facial expression wouldn't have been so ugly.</p><br/><p>Zhu Xiu Qin said, \"How did it go? Did Master Lin agree to it?\"</p><br/><p>Liu Guo Qiang placed the documents on the table. \"Agree with it my a*s. He really thinks that Cloud Street won't be able to survive without him. I have already told him that we can discount and even waive his rental fees. He immediately rejected me and suggested for us to only increase it by 10%. I think he must be dreaming. How much is 10% as compared to 100%?\"</p><br/><p>Zhu Xiu Qin sneered, \"I told you. We can't let them have their way. We have to teach them a lesson. We are a real estate company, not a charity. The increase in visitor flow in Cloud Street would definitely result in an increase in rental fees. That's just how the market works.\"</p><br/><p>\"Yeah.\" Liu Guo Qiang nodded. \"I agree with what you said. We can't let them have what they want. They'll get used to it and this will become a norm. Then, it will be even more difficult for us in the future.\"</p><br/><p>Zhu Xiu Qin replied, \"It's not as if we have never experienced this before. The increment in price is according to the market. We are not doing anything illegal at all and it's not up to us to say how much the fees should be increased. They can't hit us or scold us for it. If it's not agreeable to them, they can just leave. We wouldn't force them to stay. How are you going to deal with Master Lin's shop?\"</p><br/><p>Liu Guo Qiang paused for nearly thirty seconds, then, he said, \"We have to treat everyone equally. His rental fees will be doubled as well. If he doesn't want to pay up, then he can leave. How're things with the promotions department?\"</p><br/><p>Zhu Xiu Qin smiled. \"It's good. There were nearly a hundred companies that came to ask for unit rentals. The details will be sent over to us soon.\"</p><br/><p>*Dong dong!*</p><br/><p>\"It's here. Let's see how it went.\"</p><br/><p>An employee from the promotions department had come over with the relevant documents. \"Director Liu, Director Zhu, the documents have been arranged for you. Please have a look.\"</p><br/><p>\"Not bad.\" Liu Guo Qiang nodded as he took the documents over from him. \"It's not bad after all. There are currently 103 interested parties. Even if the whole of Cloud Street moves away, the stoppage of work would only last a month at most.\"</p><br/><p>Zhu Xiu Qin laughed, \"I told you that there are more than enough interested parties.\"</p><br/><p>Then, Liu Guo Qiang looked at the promotions department employee. \"What is it? If you have something to say, say it. Do not be wishy-washy.\"</p><br/><p>The employee replied, \"Sir, every single one of them asked the same question when they called.\"</p><br/><p>\"What was it?\" Liu Guo Qiang was curious. \"Please tell me everything at once. Do not give me information in pieces.\"</p><br/><p>The employee replied, \"They asked if they could be nearer to Master Lin's shop.\"</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Liu Guo Qiang and Zhu Xiu Qin were stunned.</p><br/><p>Liu Guo Qiang asked curiously, \"Every single one of them?\"</p><br/><p>The employee replied, \"Yeah.\"</p><br/><p>Then, Liu Guo Qiang looked at Zhu Xiu Qin. This situation didn't seem too good.</p><br/><p>*Ding ding!*</p><br/><p>The employee's phone rang. He looked at the name on the phone. \"This is a customer that I spoke to earlier.\"</p><br/><p>Zhu Xiu Qin said, \"Answer it. Say that Master Lin will be moving away from Cloud Street and see his reaction.\"</p><br/><p>He answered the phone.</p><br/><p>The employee replied, \"Don't worry. When there's an available unit, we will definitely contact you. As for Master Lin's shop, the latest piece of information I got was that he might leave Cloud Street\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"HUH?!\"</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>After hanging up, the employee said, \"The customer said that if Master Lin closes his shop, she won't rent it anymore.</p><br/><p>Liu Guo Qiang and Zhu Xiu Qin were stunned. They were in disbelief.</p><br/><p>It seemed like there was going to be a problem...</p><br/>\n</div>"}

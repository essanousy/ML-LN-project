Moreover, looking at the situation, it seemed that something had happened concerning Liang Hong Tian.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, why didn\u2019t you inform me that you were coming to Beijing?\u201d Zhou Tian Fu asked while smiling. His relationship with Master Lin wasn\u2019t the closest, but Master Lin had definitely provided him with the most help.</p><br/><p>If it weren\u2019t for him, he would probably have missed out on many opportunities.</p><br/><p>The matter with Liang Hong Tian had already been resolved. Lin Fan\u2019s mood was still rather good. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing important so I felt that it would have been embarrassing to disturb Young Master Zhou. Moreover, having Chang Hai Ge and the rest was enough. However, aren\u2019t you going to get married soon? Why are you still out here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Tian Fu laughed, \u201cIt\u2019s because I\u2019m going to get married, so all the more I should come out to play. If not, I wouldn\u2019t have such a chance in future. Oh, that\u2019s right, why did you have a problem with this fellow?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the bawling Liang Hong Tian who was hiding in his car. He couldn\u2019t help but laugh, \u201cThere wasn\u2019t much of a problem. It was just a small misunderstanding.\u201d</p><br/><p>However, it actually wasn\u2019t a misunderstanding. It was actually a fact. He had wanted to get Wu Yun Gang\u2019s niece drunk. Was that morally correct? Getting slapped by him these few days was what he deserved.</p><br/><p>Zhou Tian Fu nodded his head. Liang Hong Tian only relied on his family power. He didn\u2019t have many abilities of his own. Moreover, there was a group of people in his family pressuring him, hence, he wouldn\u2019t be able to rise up to the stage.</p><br/><p>However, relying on one\u2019s family power was enough to play tyrant in the outside world and get anything he wanted. But with Liang Hong Tian\u2019s cowardly nature, he probably didn\u2019t have the guts to do that.</p><br/><p>Chang Hai Ge was standing by his side, \u201cYoung Master, the reason Master Lin is here is to take part in the Qingtian Bay Race. Shen Ming and I have already helped the Master to get ready.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh? Master Lin, you want to take part in car racing as well?\u201d Zhou Tian Fu was shocked.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed, \u201cI\u2019m still young. Who wouldn\u2019t want some excitement?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis kind of excitement can cost you your life.\u201d At this moment, Ye Tong Xian interrupted the conversation. She scanned Master Lin visibly and said, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem like you have what it takes to race. Don\u2019t risk your life for just one moment of excitement.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan turned his head and looked at the young lady beside him, \u201cWho is this beauty?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Tian Fu laughed, \u201cThis is the Little Princess Ye Tong Xian of the Ye family. She has a short temper and is very direct with her words. Master Lin, don\u2019t take her words to heart.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan continued to stare at the young lady. Zhou Tian Fu didn\u2019t need to say anything. One look at this young lady and he could tell that she had a short temper. However, rich people had the rich people look. This little girl had a nice appearance and a very good fate. He smiled and said, \u201cI would definitely not take her words to heart. What\u2019s there to fuss over with kids?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Tian Fu was stunned for a moment. After which, he burst out in laughter and gave him a thumbs up, \u201cMaster Lin, you\u2019re awesome!\u201d</p><br/><p>In Beijing, it could be considered that the Ye family was a family with great capabilities. As for the short-temper of Ye Tong Xian, it was said that not many were able to stand it. Who would have expected that Master Lin would bluntly say that the other party was a kid? How awesome was that?</p><br/><p>As expected, Ye Tong Xian momentarily got pissed off when she heard this. She was stunned for a moment, but it was quickly followed by fury. \u201cWho are you calling a kid? I\u2019m a kid?\u201d</p><br/><p>Outrageous! It was simply outrageous! It was utterly humiliating.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shrugged his shoulders and completely ignored her, \u201cYoung Master, what time is the competition starting?\u201d</p><br/><p>The only reason he was here was to complete the fifteenth page of knowledge. With the knowledge of the Encyclopedia, such a race would definitely not be a problem.</p><br/><p>Young Master Zhou asked, \u201cSmall K, is everyone almost here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Small K was a fashionable young lad. If his hairstyle was more explosive, he would definitely be a trendsetter. \u201cYoung Master, everyone is here. We can start anytime.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey! Do you have any manners? I\u2019m talking to you! Why are you ignoring me?\u201d Ye Tong Xian was pulling Lin Fan\u2019s sleeve and questioning him.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan rolled his eyes. He had no interest in such a brat. These few sentences had caused her to be so angry. Wasn\u2019t she a bit too easily provoked?</p><br/><p>\u201cMove aside, brat. The competition is going to start in a while.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026I\u2026\u201d Ye Tong Xian opened her eyes wide. She pointed to herself in disbelief, \u201cYou\u2019re calling me a brat? You\u2026you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Young Master Zhou shook his head while forcing a bitter smile. This Master Lin wasn\u2019t a simple man. He had better not let her go over the top and offend the other party.</p><br/><p>\u201cTong Xian, stop making a fuss. This is my friend, Master Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye Tong Xian shook her head, \u201cNo way! Even if he is your friend, he still can\u2019t call me a brat. I have raced over three times here. I almost got into the top ten once. On what basis can he call me a brat?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chang Hai Ge covered his face. He looked over to Master Lin, whose expression seems to have changed to one of impatience. He had been marked by this little princess. It was a sin.</p><br/><p>However, he knew that Master Lin wasn\u2019t a bad person. As long as you didn\u2019t go overboard, he would be very gentle and would be very willing to forgive others.</p><br/><p>So long as Ye Tong Xian didn\u2019t go too far, nothing would happen. Furthermore, Ye Tong Xian wasn\u2019t a fool. Even though she got pissed off regularly, she knew when to stop.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou say that you aren\u2019t a brat? Well, that\u2019s alright. In the competition later, do you have the guts to sit in my car? As long as you dare to sit in it, I\u2019ll admit that you aren\u2019t a brat. Do you dare? From what I see, you wouldn\u2019t dare.\u201d Lin Fan shook his head and smiled.</p><br/><p>Originally, he had wanted to quickly get this race over and done with. However, looking at it now, he wanted to play around a bit.</p><br/><p>\u201cTsk! I\u2019m not afraid. I\u2019ll sit. I want to see how good you are.\u201d Ye Tong Xian agreed without even thinking about it.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot bad, you have guts.\u201d Lin Fan laughed.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cCan we start the competition?\u201d At this moment, the blonde Irvine walked over from a distance. He was ready to go.</p><br/><p>As an international racer, he naturally had incomparable arrogance. However, this was Beijing, many of the people at this event were sons of wealthy men. The tone of their voices was gentle. Even if they were arrogant, they wouldn\u2019t show it.</p><br/><p>Small K replied, \u201cEverything is settled. If everyone is ready, we can proceed.\u201d</p><br/><p>There was great jubilation on the ground. The moment of excitement was finally coming.</p><br/><p>Chang Hai Ge was still worried about Master Lin taking part in the race. \u201cMaster Lin, start off slowly. These people are very reckless and very fierce when driving. Don\u2019t try to challenge them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, you can relax. Nothing will go wrong.\u201d Lin Fan patted Chang Hai Ge\u2019s shoulder.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan didn\u2019t bring a single thing for this race. The car belonged to Chang Hai Ge, and as expected, Chang Hai Ge didn\u2019t let him down. Everything was in order. Even his car was the best and the flashiest.</p><br/><p>At the starting point.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan saw Ye Tong Xian standing outside. \u201cBrat, get on!\u201d</p><br/><p>The people beside Ye Tong Xian were worried and urged her, \u201cTong Xian, I think it\u2019ll be better if you don\u2019t go. This person doesn\u2019t seem to be trustworthy. Something might just happen.\u201d</p><br/><p>*Spit*</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say such inauspicious things! Nothing will happen. It\u2019s just sitting in a car. That won\u2019t scare me!\u201d Skillful people are very bold. Ye Tong Xian didn\u2019t think twice about it and immediately boarded the car.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou better be careful. If you can\u2019t do it, then don\u2019t drive too fast!\u201d Even though she didn\u2019t express any emotions on her face, but she was inwardly very worried.</p><br/><p>After all, this was a racing car event and not some child\u2019s play. If something really was to happen, it could cost them their lives.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was all smiles. The time for entertainment was finally here!</p><br/><p>As for the brat, let\u2019s give her something to remember.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

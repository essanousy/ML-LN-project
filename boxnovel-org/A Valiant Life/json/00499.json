Ever since Little Boss had come, the business had indeed improved.</p><br/><p>Moreover, they had learned a good amount of the techniques that Little Boss had taught them. However, they had no idea how Little Boss had such amazing back-scrubbing skills. Even until now, they hadn\u2019t learned all of his skills.</p><br/><p>More importantly, after improving their techniques, some of the old customers complimented them, saying that their back-scrubbing felt different. It felt more comfortable than before.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan asked curiously, \u201cWhat has Elder Zeng been doing lately? Why don\u2019t I see him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo idea. But I heard that Elder Zeng is talking business with some other people,\u201d said one of the workers.</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard about that too. Seems that he\u2019s preparing to begin a new project. Back when business wasn\u2019t good, Elder Zeng was overwrought. I think it might \u2018that\u2019,\u201d he said it very obscurely. But they, as men, all understood.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was surprised. \u201cDidn\u2019t he say he wouldn\u2019t do this? Why is he suddenly thinking of it again?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI think someone actively came looking for him. It is considered outsourcing and they give Elder Zeng a sum of money every month. This not only improves his current business but also gives him an external source of income. That\u2019s why Elder Zeng may not have been able to resist it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded. He knew that if Elder Zeng didn\u2019t do this, he wouldn\u2019t be able to compete with other people.</p><br/><p>By outsourcing the bathhouse, other people take care of \u2018those things\u2019 and pay him a sum of money every month. The most important thing is that it increases the number of people who come to bathe. It is something that all bathhouses cannot escape from.</p><br/><p>However, there were bathhouses that were really just for bathing and not for \u2018those things\u2019. In order to do that successfully, service had to be good and the price had to be reasonable, giving customers a feeling of luxury and affordability.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan didn\u2019t think too much. He waved his hand and said, \u201cI\u2019m leaving now. See you all tomorrow.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The next day!</p><br/><p>Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>News that Lin Fan was doing back-scrubbing work at Elder Zeng\u2019s bathhouse had gotten out. The shop owners were all dumbfounded and they felt that this Little Boss\u2019s thinking was just very different from theirs. Why would he suddenly enter this profession?</p><br/><p>Lin Fan lay there, playing with his phone. Weibo had been peaceful and quiet lately, while numerous variety shows and movies appeared.</p><br/><p>At that moment, a private message came.</p><br/><p>Brother Qiang Qiang: \u201cGodly doctor, is the medicine you gave me really useful?\u201d</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan saw this, he became annoyed. Isn\u2019t that just a stupid question? If it wasn\u2019t useful, why would he give it?</p><br/><p>Lin Fan: \u201cIt is definitely useful. What\u2019s wrong now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Brother Qiang Qiang: \u201cLately, my voice has become very delicate. It\u2019s not rough at all. Moreover, my facial hair has been gradually falling and it doesn\u2019t grow much anymore. What kind of use does this medicine have exactly?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was puzzled. \u201cBrother Qiang Qiang, haven\u2019t you been thinking too much? These are normal. You even want to have a long beard, a coarser voice, and rougher skin?\u201d</p><br/><p>Brother Qiang Qiang: \u201cYeah! Godly doctor, that\u2019s exactly what I want. My voice should become rougher and my beard should grow longer. How could this happen? Moreover, I feel like \u2018those parts\u2019 have grown bigger. Shouldn\u2019t they be getting smaller?\u201d</p><br/><p>Immediately after, another message came.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe strangest part is that when I hug my girlfriend, I don\u2019t know why I get a feeling of conflict. It\u2019s even a little disgusting\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was stunned. He felt that it wasn\u2019t quite right. \u201cWait a moment, what did you just say? You want your voice to get rougher and your beard to get longer? Do you want to become male or female?\u201d</p><br/><p>Brother Qiang Qiang: \u201cGodly doctor, aren\u2019t you talking nonsense? Of course I want to become male. Although it\u2019s not possible physiologically, I want at least my appearance to change.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan: \u201c???\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, Lin Fan was dumbfounded. He was completely stunned and he suddenly realized that he seemed to have gotten something wrong. A strange tragic feeling rushed into his heart.</p><br/><p>Brother Qiang Qiang, who was far away in Jiangning, suddenly felt that this conversation wasn\u2019t quite right. His heart started getting suspicious. \u201cGodly doctor, did you misunderstand my meaning?</p><br/><p>This premonition was very strong. She really felt as if this godly doctor had misunderstood her.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Lin Fan lost his cool a little. \u201cThis\u2026this\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Brother Qiang Qiang: \u201cGodly doctor, tell me the truth. Did you misunderstand me or not?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was helpless. \u201cYou didn\u2019t tell me clearly that time either.\u201d</p><br/><p>Brother Qiang Qiang: \u201cF*ck, did you even give me a chance to say what I wanted back then? You say that you\u2019re a professional but now you\u2019re telling me that you misunderstood?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan: \u201cHow is that unprofessional of me? You have a hormonal imbalance with psychological factors involved, that\u2019s why you are in such a situation. Of course I thought that you wanted to recover your femininity. There wasn\u2019t anything wrong with my prescription. It was you who didn\u2019t tell me clearly enough.\u201d</p><br/><p>Brother Qiang Qiang was pissed. \u201cHow did I not say it clearly? I wanted to say it clearly but you refused to let me. And now you\u2019re blaming me? Professional? Professional my ass! I don\u2019t care, you better give me a new prescription right now. Otherwise, believe me, I will cut you down.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was helpless. Yin and Yang are difficult to reverse. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I really can\u2019t change it. Your situation is quite severe, hence, I prescribed you with stronger medicine. You\u2019ve taken the medicine for a month by now. The effects are already permanent. They can\u2019t be reversed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLady Liu, you have to understand that you are actually very beautiful. Being a real lady is not bad either. Why must you become a male? Moreover, even if you change your appearance to look like a male, you won\u2019t have \u2018that\u2019. Am I not right? Why don\u2019t you just stay happily as a quiet, beautiful lady and enjoy your life?\u201d Lin Fan could only advise her now. As a godly doctor, he had actually made a mistake in his treatment. If word of this got out, he would be laughed at.</p><br/><p>Brother Qiang Qiang replied angrily, \u201cLady Liu? Call me Brother Qiang Qiang! I only gave you one option. Hurry up and change me back!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan: \u201cAlright, alright, Brother Qiang Qiang. I give in to you. Let me say it more directly. I really cannot change you back. If you really want to cause trouble for me, we can meet in the court of law. Tell them that I made a treatment mistake and turned you into a female.\u201d</p><br/><p>Brother Qiang Qiang: \u201cYou don\u2019t want to take responsibility for your mistake? Okay. Don\u2019t think that just because you aren\u2019t in Jiangning that I can\u2019t do anything to you. Just you wait. I\u2019ll slowly talk to you personally.\u201d</p><br/><p>After sending so many messages, Lin Fan\u2019s fingers were aching.</p><br/><p><em>ring ring</em></p><br/><p>An unknown number called. It was from Jiangning.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan thought about whether he should answer it. Then, he helplessly answered the call.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello, may I know if you are Godly Doctor Lin?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan hesitated for a moment. He wasn\u2019t sure who the caller was yet. \u201cYou are?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHi, I\u2019m Liu Xu\u2019s father, Liu Yuan. About my daughter\u2019s situation, I really have to thank you. Don\u2019t worry, I will definitely stop my daughter from causing trouble for you,\u201d said Liu Yuan. He had assigned one of his people to be at his daughter\u2019s side the whole time. When he had received the report that his daughter was becoming more and more feminine, he had let out a sigh of relief. Then, he thought of all kinds of ways to finally get Lin Fan\u2019s number. He specially called him to express his gratitude.</p><br/><p>More importantly, the person appointed by Liu Yuan reported that the young lady was trying to cause trouble for the godly doctor. Of course, her father had to thank the godly doctor and couldn\u2019t allow his daughter to cause trouble for him.</p><br/><p>To him, the godly doctor was a savior.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan\u2019s mind was in a mess. What the heck was going on? One of them was trying to cause trouble for him while the other one wanted to thank him.</p><br/><p>This\u2026this\u2026</p><br/><p>Life is so hard!</p><br/><p>But was that Brother Qiang Qiang going to send someone to cut Lin Fan down? Lin Fan was a little nervous.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

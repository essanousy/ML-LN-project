She waved and then ran over.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. \u201cHuan Yue, judging by your appearance, you\u2019ve just finished filming. You haven\u2019t even changed out of your costume.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYup, the filming has just been completed.\u201d Wu Huan Yue nodded. \u201cBrother Lin, I\u2019ll go and change my outfit. Wait for me.\u201d</p><br/><p>For Brother Lin to be able to come and see her, she was really elated. Initially, she had thought that You Lan would come as well but she didn\u2019t see her. She felt that it was quite strange. This was different from previous times.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo problem. I\u2019ll go with you and I\u2019ll go take a look,\u201d said Lin Fan with a smile. This show had been introduced to her by Wang Ming Yang. Although Wu Huan Yue had released songs before, she was still new in the film industry. For her to be able to act as the second female lead, it was partly due to the fact that she had backing. This allowed her to get some practice.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-2\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>He went to take a look at the situation on site.</p><br/><p>But to Lin Fan, Wu Huan Yue had already succeeded. When they met for the first time, he had said that she wasn\u2019t suited to act right from the start. She had to go down the musical path first. Now that things were all going to plan, it could be considered a perfect development.</p><br/><p>After hesitating for a while, Wu Huan Yue said, \u201cBrother Lin, there are many people there. I\u2019m afraid that you may not be comfortable there.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan thought happily to himself. <em>What\u2019s there on this planet that could make me uncomfortable? </em>Then, he patted Wu Huan Yue\u2019s head gently. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, go on ahead. What\u2019s there to be uncomfortable about?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d She wasn\u2019t comfortable with the situation there but since Brother Lin wanted to go, they went. However, she wasn\u2019t afraid that Brother Lin would lose out at all. She wasn\u2019t an idiot. How could she not know what kind of person her Brother Lin was?</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>After Wu Huan Yue had left, Chen Bao Guo felt a little uncomfortable. He and Wu Huan Yue were the two people that just couldn\u2019t blend into the atmosphere.</p><br/><p>Now that Wu Huan Yue had left for the moment, he felt a little awkward and he didn\u2019t know what to say.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-3\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cHey, Huan Yue is back.\u201d Director Zhu had been nodding while listening to Chief Yang\u2019s boasting. Then, he looked into the distance and said with a smile.</p><br/><p>Chen Bao Guo heaved a sigh of relief when he heard that. He finally had a buddy now and he wouldn\u2019t have to carry on being awkward.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t like this place but if he just left, it would be too obvious. People would feel that he wasn\u2019t giving them face.</p><br/><p>Chief Wang furrowed his brows as he saw a man next to Wu Huan Yue. moreover, Wu Huan Yue was chatting and giggling happily. It seemed that their relationship wasn\u2019t a normal one.</p><br/><p>Chief Yang saw Wang Xun\u2019s expression out of the corner of his eyes and was displeased as well. However, he didn\u2019t express it. He said in a strange tone, \u201cIt looks like Wu Huan Yue already has a boyfriend.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Qing laughed coldly in her heart. <em>What an idiot. She even reveals that she has a boyfriend. With this, she\u2019s guaranteeing that she won\u2019t be able to climb any further in the film industry.</em></p><br/><p>When females enter the film industry, before they get famous, none of them would publicly show their romantic life.</p><br/><p>Because once they do, it would have a great impact on them.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat can\u2019t be right. I\u2019ve never heard that Wu Huan Yue has a boyfriend,\u201d said Director Zhu. He had really not heard about it before.</p><br/><p>Very soon, they reached.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-4\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Director Zhu\u2019s expression suddenly changed as he gasped in shock, \u201cMaster Lin\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Right now, in the entertainment industry, there were probably only a handful of people who didn\u2019t know who Master Lin was. He was a person who had overturned the entertainment industry.</p><br/><p>The things he did were all incredible.</p><br/><p>Although he was usually low-key, when he was met with a situation, he wouldn\u2019t even give any respect to an emperor. He was a terrifying individual.</p><br/><p>Everyone on site was stunned.</p><br/><p>The two words \u2018Master Lin\u2019 struck their hearts and some of the supporting actors were filled with astonishment.</p><br/><p>When Wu Huan Yue reached, she actively introduced him to them, \u201cBrother Lin, this is Director Zhu. During this period of filming, he took exceptional care of me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at Director Zhu, then went forward with a smile. \u201cNice to meet you, Director Zhu. I hope Huan Yue didn\u2019t bring you any trouble.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing Master Lin extend his hand, Director Zhu\u2019s heart started thumping furiously. He then replied courteously as both his hands grabbed Lin Fan\u2019s hand, \u201cOf course not. Huan Yue\u2019s acting skills are great and she\u2019s kind to everyone too. She\u2019s very focused at work. If I could work with more celebrities like Wu Huan Yue, my job would be a lot easier.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed gently. \u201cThat\u2019s good. For her to receive good feedback, that\u2019s the best.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue continued introducing, \u201cBrother Lin, this is Teacher Chen, Chen Bao Guo. She says that she wants to recommend me to Teacher Huang Xiu Fang so that I can study acting under her.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shifted his gaze over to Chen Bao Guo. And with a wide smile, he said, \u201cTeacher Chen, I know you, I know you. I watched your films growing up.\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-5\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Chen Bao Guo was a veteran and he had a high status but before Lin Fan, he didn\u2019t dare to act arrogantly. He immediately shook Lin Fan\u2019s hand. \u201cMaster Lin is too courteous. I\u2019ve seen your masterpiece that in the museum many times. Every time I see it, it gives me a different feeling.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Bao Guo had really been mesmerized by Lin Fan\u2019s artwork. It could even be said to be at the peak of Chinese art and he could be called a master among masters.</p><br/><p>And this Master Lin was not just a great artist. In other aspects, he was worthy of respect as well.</p><br/><p>A great contributor to Chinese medicine.</p><br/><p>He was a Chinese medical master who had developed the prescription for leukemia. Just this prescription had already saved countless lives.</p><br/><p>He had way too many titles, so much so that it was scary.</p><br/><p>Chen Bao Guo would sometimes think to himself. <em>This person is so young, yet he has already achieved such great things. If I compare myself to him, I\u2019d die of resentment.</em></p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, you\u2019re too kind. But with regards to Huan Yue, I\u2019ll have to trouble you to help her out. If you need anything, Teacher Chen, please feel free to tell me,\u201d said Lin Fan with a smile.</p><br/><p>Chen Bao Guo said, \u201cAs a new actor, Huan Yue is very talented. She grasps her persona very well and I feel that having professional guidance would be of great help to her in the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan patted the back of Wu Huan Yue\u2019s head. \u201cI never thought that she would receive such positive feedback. It seems that she really is quite hard working.\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-6\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Even with such an intimate action, Wu Huan Yue didn\u2019t feel uncomfortable. Instead, she gave a bashful expression.</p><br/><p>When the surrounding crowd saw this, they were all astonished. Their gossiping hearts started burning up. It seemed that Wu Huan Yue and Master Lin\u2019s relationship was really exceptional.</p><br/><p>It seemed that they weren\u2019t lovers but they weren\u2019t far from being lovers.</p><br/><p>Chief Yang hadn\u2019t thought that Wu Huan Yue would be so close to Master Lin. He had even thought of helping Chief Wang to take her under his wing but now, he felt lucky that he hadn\u2019t expressed it too obviously. Otherwise, he would have been done for.</p><br/><p>Although Master Lin was all smiles now and he seemed harmless, they couldn\u2019t be fooled by this facade.</p><br/><p>Thinking about the incidents that had happened in Qingzhou and the Northeast, Chief Yang\u2019s heart started racing.</p><br/><p>When Master Lin erupted in a rage, Master Lin was more brutal and fearsome than anyone else.</p></div>\n</div>"}

He never imagined that someone would act like this towards Godfather Ma.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, leave? Do you think that\u2019s possible? We don\u2019t have to rush this. Inform the subordinates to follow this man. Don\u2019t let him leave.\u201d Ma Qing Zhou wouldn\u2019t let Lin Fan get into trouble. At least before he recovered from his illness, he wouldn\u2019t let him be harmed.</p><br/><p>Of course, he had to let this man treat his illness no matter what.</p><br/><p>Liu Ren nodded, \u201cAlright, don\u2019t worry, Godfather Ma. I will definitely get people to look after him and not let him leave Qingzhou.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Ma Qing Zhou nodded. Then, he entered the car and the chauffeur saw his fearsome expression through the front mirror. He was frightened by that. Those that knew Godfather Ma would\u2019ve known the outcome if Godfather Ma was furious.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>At the taxi stand.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan stood there and waited for his cab. When he first saw Ma Qing Zhou, he had already looked at his fortune. He realized that this fella had a strong backbone and was destined for a life like this.</p><br/><p>However, Ma Qing Zhou had committed a lot of sinful acts.</p><br/><p>This type of people would\u2019ve been described as someone to avoid at all costs in the ancient times. Even the ghosts would avoid someone like him.</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung fella, do you need a cab?\u201d A cab stopped in front of him and the driver asked.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan quickly entered the car but he didn\u2019t know where he wanted to go.</p><br/><p>The driver asked, \u201cYoung chap, where would you like to go?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was a little lost, \u201cJust drive me around. Oh, I want to look for a hotel.\u201d</p><br/><p>The driver smiled and drove off quickly. When he left, there was a luxurious car that followed behind him.</p><br/><p>The driver asked, \u201cAre you here to tour Qingzhou?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded, \u201cYeah, I\u2019m from Shanghai. Sir, how\u2019s Qingzhou?\u201d</p><br/><p>The taxi drivers spent most of their time in the car and perhaps 8 out of 10 drivers were talkative ones.</p><br/><p>It was a topic that the driver was good at, \u201cQingzhou is a decent place. It has nice scenery and the people here are nice. There are a lot of scenic places which makes it a good place to travel to.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled, \u201cYeah, I was considering that before I came. When I left the airport, I saw a car that stopped outside. The car plate number was all 0. If it was like that in Shanghai, the person must have been an extremely powerful man.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAll zeroes?\u201d The driver was stunned. Then, he asked, \u201cYoung chap, are you referring to Qing Q00000?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, it was that one. You\u2019re a local, do you know who that car belongs to? That\u2019s impressive.\u201d Lin Fan pretended to not know anything. He tried to look shocked.</p><br/><p>The driver sighed, \u201cI know. It\u2019s just that you\u2019re not a local from Qingzhou and that\u2019s why you don\u2019t know who that belongs to. As long as one was here for some time, he would know who this car belongs to. Have you heard of Ma Mu Feng? People call him Ma Qing Zhou.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMa Mu Feng, I know who he is. I remember watching him on the news. He is an impressive entrepreneur from Qingzhou and is a philanthropist,\u201d Lin Fan pretended to be in awe.</p><br/><p>The driver sneered, \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t know if you\u2019re not a local. Ma Mu Feng is a vicious man. He resolved a lot of things through violence. You should ask about him in the countryside. At least 6 out of 10 families have been bullied by him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow could that be?\u201d Lin Fan was stunned. \u201cCan someone like him still exist in the current society? Why didn\u2019t the government do anything to him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha,\u201d the driver smiled disdainfully. \u201cDo anything to him? It\u2019d be considered to be a good thing for them not to be in partnership. Alright, forget it. If I talk too much, I\u2019ll be in trouble.\u201d</p><br/><p>He looked at the driver\u2019s expression and it was obvious that he was afraid of Ma Qing Zhou. He didn\u2019t even dare to talk about it.</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung chap, what do you think of this place? This is Seven Days Inn and it just got renovated. The interior is decent and the price is good,\u201d the driver brought Lin Fan to a hotel after driving him around the scenic infrastructures.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the building at it looked to be newly renovated. \u201cThank you, driver.\u201d</p><br/><p>He paid and left the car.</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan entered the hotel, the people that followed him behind wound the windows down and someone took out their phone.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Liu, he has entered Seven Days Inn.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, look after him. Inform me whenever he moves around.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>At a certain place.</p><br/><p>Liu Ren looked at Ma Qing Zhou respectfully, \u201cGodfather Ma, the target has entered Seven Days Inn.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ma Qing Zhou sneered, \u201cThis fella didn\u2019t want to give me any face. What do you think we should do?\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Ren thought for a moment, \u201cGodfather Ma, your health is of utmost importance now. Even if he is like that, we can\u2019t do anything to him. The most important thing is to let you be treated by him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true,\u201d Ma Qing Zhou nodded. \u201cD*mn it, if not for that, could he have left my sight without feeling my wrath?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGo, help me do something. Let people bring $10 million to him and ask him what he wants to do. If he wants money, give it to him. I want to see if he can still survive and return home with the money.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Ren nodded, \u201cOkay, I will do it right away.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>In the hotel.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan lied down on the bed. He was frustrated. He didn\u2019t know what to do to deal with this Ma Qing Zhou.</p><br/><p>He had a few hundred ways to deal with him but he didn\u2019t know which one would feel the best.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t want to think too much about it and he opened up Weibo.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cI\u2019m already in Qingzhou, I am staying at a new hotel called Seven Days Inn. It is decent and well-priced. Furthermore, I met with Ma Qing Zhou and he didn\u2019t seem decent at all.\u201d</p><br/><p>Weibo instantly went wild.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, congratulations to Master Lin for arriving in Qingzhou.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s impressive.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy do I feel like this Ma Qing Zhou is going to be doomed? How could he survive after Master Lin decides to go against him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI feel a little worried for Master Lin. You guys don\u2019t know how tyrannic Ma Qing Zhou is.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph, you sound as if Master Lin is a pushover. He should be the one that is afraid of Master Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The next day!</p><br/><p>It was his first day in Qingzhou and he didn\u2019t know what to do. However, he wanted to have a good rest.</p><br/><p>He went downstairs to have his meal.</p><br/><p>Just when Lin Fan was enjoying his meal, a man appeared in front of him.</p><br/><p>Liu Ren said politely, \u201cHi, Godly doctor Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>There were a few tall and muscular men behind Liu Ren. Each of them was carrying a black suitcase.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan stopped and looked up. He smiled, \u201cYou must be sent here by Ma Qing Zhou.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Ren smiled, \u201cGodly doctor Lin, I am Godfather Ma\u2019s secretary. I came here as Godfather Ma requested for me to come and give you a present. I hope you\u2019ll like it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, he moved his fingers and the men behind him opened up the suitcases instantly.</p><br/><p>Then, the red banknotes could be seen by everyone in the public.</p><br/><p>The other diners were stunned when they saw this scene.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, that is so much money.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do these people want?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled. He didn\u2019t expect Ma Qing Zhou to not give up on it. He knew that he was there to cause trouble for him but he still wanted to negotiate terms with him.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, this welcome gift was one of a kind.</p><br/><p>He seemed really generous with the gift.</p></div>\n</div>"}

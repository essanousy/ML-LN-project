At this moment, Liu Xiao Tian came. However, when he arrived, he was looking at Lin Fan with a strange expression, as if something wasn\u2019t quite right.</p><br/><p>\u201cInspector Liu, what is it? You\u2019re making me nervous by looking at me like this.\u201d Lin Fan stood up and asked.</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian looked around him, \u201cWhere\u2019s Elder Dog?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. He was just here previously but disappeared in a blink of an eye.\u201d Lin Fan had his suspicions. This dog doesn\u2019t spare anyone from worrying. He\u2019ll run away if you aren\u2019t careful.</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian said, \u201cDid you see the news?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat news?\u201d Lin Fan asked.</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian looked at Lin Fan with admiration, \u201cI really respect you now, Master Lin. Your dog isn\u2019t ordinary. Let\u2019s not talk about him running into the fire to save people, but the main point here is that he jumped into a river to save someone yesterday. Wouldn\u2019t you say that your dog is amazing? He even appeared on the news, and you didn\u2019t even know about it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan quickly took out his phone to read the news. As expected, the news had already gained some attention.</p><br/><p>\u201cOnce again, Master Lin\u2019s dog heroically saves a young girl from drowning.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis dog is becoming a spirit, so much so that it\u2019s scary people!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>He was flabbergasted after reading the headlines. How did things become like this?</p><br/><p>Although it is a good thing, the frequency of it happen is too often.</p><br/><p>It happened once the year before last and the year before. Even though it happened between a span of a year, each time it lasted over ten days.</p><br/><p>At this moment, he was afraid that Elder Dog would be captured. After all, this was just too much.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat should we do now?\u201d Lin Fan asked.</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian couldn\u2019t help but laugh, \u201cWhat can we do? The girl\u2019s parents want to thank Elder Dog, so here I am sending it to you, as well as to thank you. At the same time, the people in my bureau agreed that Elder Dog should get a Heroism Award.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t me that said it. Master Lin, you were reluctant to take the Good Citizen Award previously. But right now, your pet has broken into the limelight. This Heroism Award isn\u2019t easy to receive.\u201d</p><br/><p>He was really in admiration. With such an owner, comes such a pet.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan heaved a sigh of relief when he heard this. As long as Elder Dog wasn\u2019t captured, he was okay with it.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian, who was listening to their conversation from a side, was extremely jealous.</p><br/><p>Elder Dog was just too amazing. They wanted to get the award as well, but they just didn\u2019t have the capability. Right now, a dog receives two awards at once. Isn\u2019t that scary?</p><br/><p>Lin Fan took the things from Liu Xiao Tian\u2019s hand, \u201cAlright, I\u2019ll just take these from you. My dog just can\u2019t sit still. He goes running around outside every day, I don\u2019t know what for. When he comes back, I\u2019d definitely teach him a lesson.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t, Master Lin. Please don\u2019t ever do it. Your dog is amazing. If it weren\u2019t for your dog, we wouldn\u2019t know what would happen with that girl.\u201d Liu Xiao Tian just couldn\u2019t understand how this dog could be so smart. Moreover, it also had amazing strength. According to the recount of the surrounding people, the water was gushing. Even if a human were to go in, he definitely wouldn\u2019t be able to withstand it.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed, \u201cOkay, okay. No matter what, he still did a good deed. I\u2019d praise him a little when he gets back. I\u2019d let him continue to spread this spirit around!\u201d</p><br/><p>After conversing for a period of time, Liu Xiao Tian left. Even after he left, he still felt rather apprehensive. Just where did this dog come from?</p><br/><p>When Liu Xiao Tian left, Lin Fan laughed. He didn\u2019t think that Elder Dog was so capable. It was completely beyond his expectations.</p><br/><p>However, thinking about it, how could Elder Dog be considered a normal dog?</p><br/><p>He was completely a godly dog. Not only did he have human capabilities, he also had IQ and was very strong. It was simply frightening.</p><br/><p>Until the evening.</p><br/><p>Elder Dog came back happily as if he had just done another good deed. He was in a good mood.</p><br/><p>Elder Dog Fanclub.</p><br/><p>\u201cEverybody, quickly come and take a look! Our idol has once again done something great!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck! 6666, he jumped into a river to save a young lady? Elder Dog is indeed Elder Dog.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe have to re-post this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Dog is just great! I really wish to raise another Elder Dog.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you want to raise a dog, you should hurry! Right now, the pet shops are all selling the Chinese rural dog! It\u2019s the same breed as Elder Dog. It\u2019s very expensive.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn the past, it was rather embarrassing to walk a Chinese rural dog around. However, it\u2019s all different now. Wherever you go, you\u2019re respected.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Lin Fan didn\u2019t plan on doing this, but because of everything that Elder Dog has done, it has indirectly increased the positioning of the rural dogs in the market.</p><br/><p>Especially the white rural dogs. It looked exactly like Elder Dog. The price of it was excessively high, and everyone was shocked.</p><br/><p>A few days later.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan received a call from Director Liu for him to attend a show at 6 o\u2019clock that night.</p><br/><p>This sports show was Shanghai TV\u2019s new variety show. Whether or not it\u2019ll be popular, they didn\u2019t know yet. However, he still wanted to give it a try.</p><br/><p>6 o\u2019clock.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was driving his car. He arrived at the doorstep of Shanghai TV.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin.\u201d At this moment, an employee had already been waiting for him, and when he saw Lin Fan, he immediately rushed forward to warmly welcome him.</p><br/><p>Which employee in Shanghai TV wouldn\u2019t recognize Master Lin?</p><br/><p>It was all because of Master Lin that they could have a good past year.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow should I address you?\u201d Lin Fan asked.</p><br/><p>The employee answered happily, \u201cMaster Lin, you can address me as Xiao Huang.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright. Xiao Huang, what\u2019s the purpose of the show?\u201d Lin Fan really didn\u2019t know what the show was about. He also didn\u2019t follow the situation online.</p><br/><p>Xiao Huang replied, \u201cToday is the first episode of the show. The main purpose is to invite a few sports stars over to give their stories. It\u2019s the same as a normal conversation.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWow. Who\u2019s the guest for today?\u201d Lin Fan asked.</p><br/><p>When Xiao Huang thought of the guest, he became a little unhappy, \u201cWho else can it be? It\u2019s that Japanese Table Tennis player, Zhenping Yiming. Didn\u2019t he win the Asian Championships? I\u2019m not sure what the directors are thinking. They actually invited him over.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed, \u201cI can understand you. The producer definitely wants to improve the viewership, isn\u2019t that right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Huang answered him, \u201cViewership is definitely important, but this is making me panic. Isn\u2019t this show for others to come and put up a show?\u201d After which, he didn\u2019t say much. \u201cMaster Lin, let me bring you inside. The guest is about to arrive.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, let\u2019s go.\u201d Lin Fan also didn\u2019t too much about it. He came to the show just to help raise its popularity. All he needed to do was to play his part and not think too much about the rest.</p><br/><p>Very quickly, they arrived at the backstage.</p><br/><p>He met many guests.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t recognize many of the guests, but however, the guests all recognized him. Everyone approached him to warmly greet him.</p><br/><p>Naturally, Lin Fan was all smiles and he interacted with these guests.</p><br/><p>In the perspective of these guests, Master Lin in front of their eyes was a powerful figure.</p><br/><p>It would be tyrannical to anger the celebrities on the show. It would scare people to death.</p><br/><p>They wouldn\u2019t dare to come at him even if they had the guts.</p><br/><p>The show was about to begin, and the guests should be arriving any time soon.</p><br/><p>With the support of the audience, Lin Fan didn\u2019t speak anything else. He just walked to the front, towards the venue.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p></div>\n</div>"}

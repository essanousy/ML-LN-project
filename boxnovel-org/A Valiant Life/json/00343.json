But Lin Fan couldn't tell him the true reason. To complete a task? That would sound so stupid.</p><br/><p>\"It's nothing much, I have a lot of songs in my head and I've been feeling extremely creative, so I have to do it. If not, I'd feel uncomfortable.\" The explanation was sound and perfect.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang was stunned. The explanation sounded legitimate.</p><br/><p>Yang Chen was an extremely experienced composer. He had nothing to say about that explanation. At the same time, he was convinced. If other composers were to hear his explanation, they'd definitely be infuriated. Other composers had to think about a lot of things to make a song while Lin Fan actually said that he had too many songs. That was crazy.</p><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue was considered a public figure now. She was more cautious of her actions and words. Then, she smiled. \"I am fully confident in Brother Lin's composing capabilities. I believe it will be on par with 'Sky'.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled confidently. \"Of course. It'll be even better than that.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan's entire head was filled with songs. He couldn't even count them. It might be in thousands or even tens of thousands. According to the Encyclopedia's explanation, it covered the entire world's songs. They were in every single language. It was simply insane.</p><br/><p>If not for his lack of talent in singing, he would definitely have used those songs and become a legend in the music industry. He didn't know what to do with the excessive songs in his head. Regardless of how good the songs were, he didn't think that they were good anymore. It was too much for him.</p><br/><p>Yang Chen and Wang Ming Yang were stunned by Lin Fan. Especially when Yang Chen heard Lin Fan say that the songs would be even better than 'Sky'. It felt as if he was bragging.</p><br/><p>\"Do you have a pen and paper?\" Lin Fan asked.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang was stunned. \"Why?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at Wang Ming Yang. \"What else? I want to write down the songs. Then, we can record them quickly.\"</p><br/><p>Yang Chen and Wang Ming Yang were shocked. Even Wu Huan Yue was speechless. She hadn't expected Brother Lin to be so hasty. Did he really mean what he said? Was there really a sea of songs in his head?</p><br/><p>Lin Fan took the pen and paper and immediately started writing.</p><br/><p>Yang Chen and Wang Ming Yang looked at each other in confusion. Then, they turned to Lin Fan. Lin Fan suddenly stopped writing. It was as if he was deep in thought.</p><br/><p>They thought that Lin Fan was thinking about the lyrics but Lin Fan was actually thinking about which song to write. He had never heard the songs before and he didn't know if the songs were nice. But the good thing was that the Encyclopedia was reliable and there were a lot of different genres within the selection of songs. Then, he immediately copied the songs from the Encyclopedia.</p><br/><p>*sound of paper moving*</p><br/><p>The pen moved extremely quickly and soon, the papers were filled up.</p><br/><p>Yang Chen was stunned after witnessing everything. It seemed too unreal.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang didn't even understand what was going on but he felt that Lin Fan was really awesome. Then, he nudged Yang Chen, \"Teacher Yang, what do you think?\"</p><br/><p>\"I can't tell for now. I have to see how the songs sound like.\" Yang Chen was extremely curious. He didn't know what was going to happen even though he was considered an extremely experienced composer. He had seen a lot of great composers, even those that were able to compose songs immediately. However, those songs that were composed quickly didn't do well at all.</p><br/><p>However, he had to see what was going to happen.</p><br/><p>After some time.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan placed the pen on the table. \"Alright, it's done.\"</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang didn't understand how crazy his actions were but Teacher Yang was flabbergasted. \"Master Lin, that's all?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. \"Yeah, let's see if it works.\"</p><br/><p>Although Wu Huan Yue wasn't a composer, she read through some of the lyrics and felt that the lyrics were extremely easy to read and sing.</p><br/><p>Yang Chen slowly read through the sheets in doubt.</p><br/><p>'A Thousand Wrongs'</p><br/><p>As I looked back at the nights that used to belong to us.</p><br/><p>The red sky was you and you gave me the colorful sun.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>As he continued reading, Yang Chen was extremely shocked. Then, he looked at Lin Fan. \"Master Lin, these lyrics\u2026\"</p><br/><p>He stopped. He felt that these lyrics didn't sound like they were supposed to be sung in Mandarin. The grammar was weird.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. \"This song is in Cantonese.\"</p><br/><p>\"Indeed.\" Yang Chen nodded and looked at Lin Fan curiously. \"But nowadays, Cantonese songs aren't that popular. Do you think there will be a problem?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan obviously didn't know the current trend but according to the Encyclopedia, this was an unfailing song. There must have been a reason for that.</p><br/><p>\"It's okay. Let's see how it goes after Huan Yue sings it,\" Lin Fan said confidently.</p><br/><p>He trusted her and the Encyclopedia.</p><br/><p>Yang Chen gasped involuntarily. However, he was stunned. The tune seemed one of a kind.</p><br/><p>Although they didn't know what to expect, it would definitely be an awesome song.</p><br/><p>Then, he continued reading.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang asked curiously, \"How many did you write?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \"Ten songs.\"</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang was stunned. \"Ten songs? This album doesn't need so many songs.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. \"What's wrong with that? Let's fire away. This is going online. We have to make more songs.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan wanted all the song credits to be his, except the singing part. The task had to be completed, right?</p><br/><p>He felt that it was really difficult to choose the songs as he didn't know which sounded nice. However, he just followed the charts. The songs on top shouldn't be a problem at all.</p><br/><p>\"Alright.\" Then, Yang Chen was stunned. He looked at Lin Fan in shock. \"Besides the Cantonese song that I'm unsure of, the other songs are masterpieces. However, these songs are different from current popular songs. They are focusing on feelings and they don't have any falsetto parts.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. \"Of course! What do you need falsetto parts for?\"</p><br/><p>Yang Chen was a composer himself and he was extremely convinced by Lin Fan. \"I'm impressed. I'm really impressed. Any of these songs could have been a hit in the past and even now. They are amazing songs.\"</p><br/><p>It was easy to distinguish between a good song and a bad one. If an average person felt good after listening to it, it'd be considered to be a good song.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan had specially selected the songs and he was confident in them. He was looking forward to the completion of his task.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

He had already realized that Master Lin was acting different after looking at his son.</p><br/><p>Thinking back to what Master Lin had done in the past, like conquering leukemia, he would never believe that Master Lin could not even treat a crippled leg.</p><br/><p>He would never believe that.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, tell me how much it will cost. I can\u2019t let my son\u2019s leg rot.\u201d Because Zhou Shi Ming had money, whenever he came across a problem, money would be the first thing he brought up.</p><br/><p>To him, money had thousands of functions. It could resolve any issue.</p><br/><p>For example, his son always caused trouble but with the help but money, none of these were problems.</p><br/><p>Although this Master Lin had great accomplishments, to Zhou Shi Ming, he was still human and he couldn\u2019t escape the allure of money.</p><br/><p>Zhou Jun\u2019s heart was now as dark as coal. He was so young and he already had a problem with his leg. He would get ridiculed if he went out like this. Now that Master Lin had said that he couldn\u2019t treat him, Zhou Jun felt as if he was going to become useless.</p><br/><p>But when he saw that his dad was still negotiating, he suddenly awoke from his daze. This Master Lin\u2019s medical ability was so amazing, how was it possible that he couldn\u2019t treat him? The only possibility was that Master Lin wanted more money.</p><br/><p>Zhou Jun was young and reckless. He immediately blurted out, \u201cMaster Lin, it\u2019s just a matter of money, isn\u2019t it? My family had money. As long as you can treat my leg, any amount is fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was getting annoyed. In the past, perhaps people would try to buy him over using money but later on, people had stopped trying. However, unexpectedly, someone was now trying to use that same old trick.</p><br/><p>Then, he laughed mockingly. \u201cDo you think that money can do anything?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Shi Ming didn\u2019t speak. He didn\u2019t feel it was right for him to answer. However, Zhou Jun didn\u2019t even hesitate. \u201cRight. Money can do anything.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good. Since you say that money can do anything, can you make me personally treat your leg back to health?\u201d asked Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>When Zhou Jun heard that, he didn\u2019t know what to say momentarily.</p><br/><p>Zhou Shi Ming looked at Lin Fan and seemed to be a little angry. He said in a stern tone, \u201cMaster Lin, tell me. Are you unable to treat him or do you just not want to treat him?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan glanced at him, then took out a piece of wood and prepared to start carving. \u201cI can treat him, but I don\u2019t want to. Because if I treat him, I won\u2019t be able to accept it.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was that simple.</p><br/><p>When Zhou Shi Ming heard that, he sucked in a breath of cold air. He hadn\u2019t expected that, even when he had such a status, someone still dared to reject him so outrightly. He was not given any face at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease leave. Don\u2019t disrupt my business.\u201d Lin Fan waved his hand. He didn\u2019t want to say more to them.</p><br/><p>With his current ability, for him to speak to them for so long was because he had a good attitude and he was courteous.</p><br/><p>*Clatter!*</p><br/><p>Zhou Jun furiously swatted the piece of wood in Lin Fan\u2019s hand away.</p><br/><p>In an instant, the place was silent. Even Zhao Zhong Yang, who had been playing with his phone, had been stunned. <em>Where the hell did this guy come from? His guts are way too big.</em></p><br/><p><em>He actually dared to swat Brother Lin\u2019s tools away.</em></p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Zhou Jun seemed not to have realized the severity of the situation. He slammed both hands on the table and bellowed, \u201cWhat the heck do you mean?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan raised his head and stared at Zhou Jun without saying a single word.</p><br/><p>Seeing Master Lin\u2019s gaze, Zhou Jun\u2019s heart shifted. It was as if he had felt something that made him swallow his saliva in fear.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you looking at me for? If you can treat me, why don\u2019t you do it?\u201d Zhou Jun averted his gaze. It seemed that he didn\u2019t dare to lock eyes with Master Lin. But with his money supporting him, he firmed up once again.</p><br/><p>Zhou Shi Ming had not expected his son to swat Master Lin\u2019s things to the ground. He was stunned momentarily too. Although he dared to question Master Lin, he would definitely not act so recklessly.</p><br/><p>Although he knew that Master Lin was very accomplished, there was no way Master Lin could cause him trouble. Still, he didn\u2019t want to offend this accomplished man.</p><br/><p>Then, he glared at his son sternly. \u201cPick it up. Who taught you to act so unbridled?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Jun saw his father\u2019s gaze and became anxious. He now regretted what he had done. Then, after hesitating for a bit, he limped forward, kneeled down, and picked up the piece of wood.</p><br/><p>However, young people have large egos. He didn\u2019t want to show his fearful side, so he just placed the piece of wood on the table defiantly.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan gestured with his hand. \u201cCome here for a moment.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d Zhou Jun looked at Lin Fan alertly, wondering what he wanted.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome here for a moment,\u201d Lin Fan raised his hand and repeated.</p><br/><p>Zhou Shi Ming prompted, \u201cIf Master Lin tells you to go, just go. Don\u2019t ask so much.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing his father say that, Zhou Jun finally went forward. But he was still wondering what this guy wanted.</p><br/><p>Suddenly.</p><br/><p>A crisp sound rang out.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan had raised his hand and threw a slap across his face. Then, Lin Fan pointed at the entrance of Cloud Street. \u201cScram, right now. Who gave you the guts to act so atrociously here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Jun had been slapped so hard that he was seeing stars. His head was spinning. Lin Fan had already held back. Otherwise, Zhou Jun\u2019s head would have flown.</p><br/><p>Zhou Shi Ming saw this and was astonished. Then, he growled, \u201cMaster Lin, you\u2019ve gone overboard. Although he was wrong, you can\u2019t hit him.\u201d</p><br/><p>However, what he received in return was a series of scoldings from Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou, scram as well. Don\u2019t make me angry. I\u2019ve really seen something strange today. My perfect mood has been ruined by you two.\u201d Lin Fan felt that perhaps he had been too nice.</p><br/><p>Because he had done too many good deeds, everyone thought that he was very kindhearted.</p><br/><p>Usually, he would talk politely to others. That was because things were peaceful. However, that did not mean that anyone who had a high status could just come and take a sh*t on his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Zhou Shi Ming was taken aback. He hadn\u2019t expected Master Lin to ask him to scram. He couldn\u2019t take it anymore.</p><br/><p>\u201cLin, you\u2019ve gone overboard. What the heck did you say? You asked me to scram?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan stood up and placed the carving knife and wood on the table. \u201cI\u2019ll say it once more. Scram, now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you think that this is your house? What rights do you have to ask us to scram?\u201d Zhou Shi Ming retorted furiously. Up until now, he had never met anyone who had dared to act so brazenly.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan didn\u2019t want to speak nonsense. He immediately lifted the two of them by their collars and walked out of the shop.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you doing? Let go, let go!\u201d Zhou Shi Ming and Zhou Jun yelled. However, against Lin Fan\u2019s inhuman strength, they were powerless.</p><br/><p>The surrounding shop owners heard these sounds and came out from their shops, wondering what had happened.</p><br/><p>But when they saw Little Boss holding one person in each hand and tossing them out onto Cloud Street, they were dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>They had really never seen Little Boss so angry. What on Earth could have happened?</p><br/><p>After tossing the two of them out on the street, Lin Fan said, \u201cGet lost, now. Don\u2019t ever come back to Cloud Street. You\u2019re not welcome here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p></div>\n</div>"}

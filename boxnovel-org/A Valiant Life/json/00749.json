Thereafter, he continued speaking.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, having another friend is always better than having another enemy. Ying Jin is mine. I hope you can give me some face and forget about this matter. I\u2019ll send you a generous gift. What do you think about that?\u201d</p><br/><p>He wasn\u2019t scared of Master Lin, but rather, he didn\u2019t want this matter to develop any further.</p><br/><p>If that fellow were to be in the Northeast, he could guarantee that within an hour, he would be teaching him how to be a person.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s good.\u201d Lin Fan shook his head. It wasn\u2019t very eye-catching.</p><br/><p>Godfather Liu was indignant, \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed, \u201cI don\u2019t mean anything. It\u2019s not easy to be my friend. If it was so easy for you to be my friend, then wouldn\u2019t I be making friends too casually? It\u2019s a little too cheap, don\u2019t you think so?\u201d</p><br/><p>It was silent through the phone.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello, hello? Why aren\u2019t you speaking? Were my words too hurtful?\u201d Lin Fan asked. \u201cDon\u2019t take it too heart. I\u2019m someone that speaks my mind. I actually have a sharp tongue but a soft heart. Don\u2019t take it too seriously. However, it wouldn\u2019t matter even if you did take it seriously. It doesn\u2019t matter to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, Godfather Liu felt as if he was being played. His tone gradually became stricter.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, why don\u2019t you suggest it instead? What do you want me to do in order for you to forget about this? Give me a condition.\u201d Godfather Liu asked.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan asked suspiciously, \u201cAre you really Godfather Liu of the Northeast? The person with the powerful existence?\u201d</p><br/><p>Godfather Liu replied, \u201cYes. With your agreement, you can freely come over to the Northeast. I will settle any problems that you run into.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, no, I\u2019m not saying that I can do as I please, but I do have some suspicions. You said that you are powerful but I am merely just an ordinary person. However, you are so terrified of me, an ordinary person. How do you want me to trust you in this case?\u201d Lin Fan laughed while asking.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you trying to joke around with me?\u201d Godfather Liu couldn\u2019t take it anymore. \u201cWhy are you so indecent? Since I\u2019m talking to you about this matter, we should both take a step back and look at the bigger picture. Do you really think that I wouldn\u2019t dare to do anything to you?\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, Lin Fan laughed, \u201cYou\u2019ve guessed correctly! You said you are a Godfather. How can you not be aggressive?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, let me warn you, I\u2019m not scared of you. Come and f*ck me if you have the balls.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be too aggressive. Don\u2019t assume that the Northeast is yours. I, Lin Fan, has tens of millions of fans in the Northeast. Do you believe that with my order, they will go and overthrow you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Godfather Liu replied, \u201cF*ck your mum!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan retorted, \u201cF*ck you dad!\u201d</p><br/><p>Godfather Liu threatened in retaliation, \u201cDo you want to die?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan answered, \u201cThat\u2019s right. I want to die. Come and f*ck me then!\u201d</p><br/><p>Godfather Liu said, \u201cYou\u2026You\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan interrupted him, \u201cDon\u2019t \u201cyou\u2026you\u2026\u201d me. Come f*ck me if you have the guts and shut up if you don\u2019t. Master Lin of Cloud Street will be here waiting for you. I\u2019m hanging up. It was good talking to you. I\u2019ve recorded the entire conversation. See you on Weibo!\u201d</p><br/><p>Godfather Liu said furiously, \u201cYou f*cking dare to\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>*Beep Beep*</p><br/><p>The busy tone came through the phone.</p><br/><p>In the private room, Godfather Liu furiously smashed the wine bottle in front of him. He had a sinister look in his eyes and his blood was boiling. He has never met such an indecent person.</p><br/><p>He was inflexible and extremely aggressive.</p><br/><p>\u201cGodfather Liu, what\u2019s the situation with Sister Ying?\u201d</p><br/><p>They listened to the conversation from the side. They didn\u2019t expect the other party to be so thick-skinned and so treacherous. He even dared to record the conversation. Wasn\u2019t he scared of revenge?</p><br/><p>Or was he just plain stupid, thinking that he\u2019s better than he actually was?</p><br/><p>Godfather Liu looked gloomy. They weren\u2019t too sure if Godfather Liu had already thought of a plan to solve this problem.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Shanghai.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was elated. Since it was so fun to play, he would just blow up the matter even more.</p><br/><p>Who cares about \u201cGodfather Liu\u201d? They had no relation at all. He could just simply record the conversation and upload it on Weibo. However, he couldn\u2019t do it now. He had to wait for the news to come out the next day.</p><br/><p>The night passed.</p><br/><p>Godfather Liu kept looking at Weibo. He didn\u2019t see the recorded conversation being uploaded. He heaved a sigh of relief. Looks like this b*stard knows what he should do, and what she shouldn\u2019t do.</p><br/><p>However, when he told Ying Jin what happened, Ying Jin was shocked and frightened at the same time. She kept screaming that something has happened.</p><br/><p>After which, Ying Jin used everything in her ability to buy the news from the reporter. But how would this be possible?</p><br/><p>No matter how awesome she is, it would be useless. This was because Lin Fan practically informed every news company in Shanghai!</p><br/><p>Moreover, some of the bigger new companies didn\u2019t even care about Ying Jin. Why wouldn\u2019t they expose such a big news?</p><br/><p>The next day!</p><br/><p>There was a huge wave on the internet.</p><br/><p>\u201cYing Jin\u2019s heart is filled with bitterness! Sent men to surround and threaten Master Lin at night!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShock! Ten over burly men attacked Master Lin at night! Master Lin is refreshed!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe secret of Ying Jin and her dark side!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust how powerful is Master Lin? Ying Jin practically can\u2019t take it anymore!\u201d</p><br/><p>These news companies had very good headlines. They have readers their many endless desires.</p><br/><p>The netizens were thoroughly shocked the moment they opened the news.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck! This meddling woman is so vicious. She sent people to threaten Master Lin!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe can\u2019t be a fool, right? Doesn\u2019t she know who Master Lin is? His strength is incredible.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m dying of laughter. The ten over burly men were taken care of by Master Lin and are now locked up the police station.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYing Jin is too shameless. As a public figure, she actually dares to do such a thing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe can\u2019t wash her name off this matter, she definitely can\u2019t. If she manages to do so, I\u2019d have squandered my entire life on Ying Jin.\u201d</p><br/><p>When the matter was published, the netizens became extremely excited.</p><br/><p>Weibo.</p><br/><p>Tieba.</p><br/><p>Forums.</p><br/><p>Whether it was a small news channel or a large platform, everything about the matter was exposed.</p><br/><p>The dirty secrets have not even passed and yet another major matter has happened.</p><br/><p>After Zhao Li\u2019s conversation with Master Lin, she had always been thinking about how to get out of the situation. After reading the news today, she started feeling nervous.</p><br/><p>If she were to push the blame entirely onto Ying Jin, then wouldn\u2019t she be fine?</p><br/><p>Ying Jin had a mafia boss to back her up. However, she was just an ordinary public figure. She definitely wouldn\u2019t dare to retaliate. The netizens would surely forgive her.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Zhao Li started to hesitate.</p><br/><p>If she were to do this, she would definitely cut all ties with Ying Jin.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>In a hotel.</p><br/><p>Ying Jin was soon going insane.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow could it become like this? All these news media are all despicable! Why would they report it like this? They don\u2019t even have any evidence to prove that it was I who gave the orders!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere did you go? Get over here immediately!\u201d Ying Jin held her phone and called her manager. However, what made her even more furious was that her own manager had already left.</p><br/><p>\u201cScum! How dare she betray me?\u201d Ying Jin went mad. After a while, she calmed down and began to strike back.</p><br/><p>Weibo.</p><br/><p>Ying Jin: \u201cThis is all nonsense talk. I, Ying Jin, am a law-abiding citizen. I wouldn\u2019t dare to do such a thing. There is definitely someone out there trying to deliberately sabotage me. I have already got my lawyer to help me find my justice!\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment she sent out this Weibo, she was immediately beaten down by Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was just waiting for her to attempt to clear her name before releasing the recording. This would make things safer.</p><br/><p>Weibo.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan: \u201cLast night, someone called Godfather Liu gave me a call. She\u2019s the guy backing Ying Jin. The recording is attached. Everyone try to picture it.\u201d</p><br/><p>When this Weibo was sent out, the netizens were all enraged.</p><br/><p>Ying Jin stumbled onto the ground. She was made a fool.</p></div>\n</div>"}

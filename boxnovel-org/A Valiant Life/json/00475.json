Being in the business world for so long, causing a little trouble was as easy as eating food for them, with all their contacts.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved him away, signaling that it was nothing. He had met these kinds of people before and he wasn\u2019t afraid of them at all.</p><br/><p>No treatment means no treatment. There didn\u2019t need to be further explanation for that.</p><br/><p>Wu Tao\u2019s face changed in an instant, bursting with rage and hate. \u201cYou really aren\u2019t going to treat me?\u201d Wu Tao spurted.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded his head. His meaning was clear. He wasn\u2019t going to treat him.</p><br/><p>Wu Tao took a deep breath, calming himself down. \u201cGodly Doctor, I am sorry about just now. I\u2019ll queue up.\u201d</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t stand being in his state with his muscular dystrophy causing him to become weaker every day. He wanted more than ever to regain his health. If this guy was his one and only shot at doing that, he had to try.</p><br/><p>But after this guy treated him, Wu Tao would screw him up.</p><br/><p>Wu Tao admitted defeat. Perhaps it was his own flaws, but he had to try.</p><br/><p>Chairman Bi kept silent as he continued watching. Their paths were starkly different from Wu Tao\u2019s. Although they had less money compared to him, they were knowledgeable in the medical arts.</p><br/><p>However, a scholar is always wrong when he meets a gunman.</p><br/><p>In this society, learning and scholarship cannot triumph over the people who are in power. It would be unfortunate for those who met those kinds of people who resorted to dirty tactics to gain the advantage over others.</p><br/><p>\u201cI won\u2019t treat you, even if you queued up. You are spineless, immoral and a cheat. You will do anything to get your way, bad things included. Your wealth is only temporary and your illness is Heaven\u2019s way of punishing you for what you have done. If I were to save you, I would be going against Heaven\u2019s will and I can\u2019t possibly do that, can I?\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone standing around was shocked. They never thought that the Godly Doctor would be that direct, not giving him any face at all.</p><br/><p>Most people would\u2019ve been hopping mad and might even want to pick a fight.</p><br/><p>Wu Tao was one of them, his eyes, raging with fire. \u201cYou\u2019re really not going to treat me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you have a problem? I already said it before. Do you have a hearing problem too?\u201d Lin Fan smiled slyly.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a Doctor. If you don\u2019t treat me, I can sue you,\u201d Wu Tao said furiously.</p><br/><p>\u201cGo ahead, if that makes you happy,\u201d Lin Fan waved him away.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026you\u2026\u201d he stammered. He never thought that this little brat wouldn\u2019t give him any face at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you know who I am?\u201d Wu Tao repeated himself.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd do you know who I am? Why don\u2019t you go online to see for yourself? I have millions of trolls under me who can troll you good.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing looked on helplessly. Teacher, you are the Godly Doctor, you shouldn\u2019t be that careless with your words.</p><br/><p>Qiu Jie and Zhang Tong Tong couldn\u2019t help but laugh. Teacher Lin was really amusing.</p><br/><p>All the patients who stood around all looked on happily, eager to see what would develop. This Godly Doctor was simply too amazing. He didn\u2019t even flinch in the face of a strong adversary.</p><br/><p>A Godly Doctor with individuality.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d Wu Tao commanded angrily.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan couldn\u2019t help but laugh, seeing Wu Tao take his leave. He was a Godly Doctor with morals, how could he carelessly treat every single person he comes across, especially if they were evil?</p><br/><p>\u201cNext patient.\u201d Lin Fan continued as if nothing happened, concentrating on tending to his patients and diligently completing the task given to him by the Encyclopedia.</p><br/><p>He was eager to find out what the eleventh page of the encyclopedia contained.</p><br/><p>\u201cGodly Doctor, you better watch your back. These guys are vengeful and they definitely won\u2019t stop here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll adopt the appropriate measures on whatever he does. I\u2019m not scared of him at all.\u201d</p><br/><p>They had come yesterday, and they came again today.</p><br/><p>This time, however, they had come prepared. They found out that the Godly Doctor opened a clinic outside of Jiangning Fu Bao Hospital. When they arrived at the scene, they realized that the Chairman of the hospital was standing behind the Godly Doctor, which aroused their attention.</p><br/><p>\u201cChairman Bi, what are your views on the Godly Doctor?\u201d</p><br/><p>This was the first time that the reporters saw the head of a hospital come out to receive the Godly Doctor. It seemed that the relationship between the two was good.</p><br/><p>Chairman Bi chuckled. \u201cI don\u2019t have any opinions. However, I can say with confidence that the Godly Doctor has superior skills and knowledge on the art of Chinese Medicine and I respect him for that. With the Godly Doctor giving free treatment outside this hospital, I will definitely support him in whatever way I can as the Chairman of this hospital.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cChairman Bi, regarding the Godly Doctor giving free treatment to patients. Has it had any impact on your hospital?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe impact is definitely there, and it\u2019s actually quite huge. With the Godly Doctor here, our patients have a greater hope of recovering, especially for those with more serious conditions. I am grateful and joyful. The goal of our hospital is to let patients leave happy and cured, and we have worked hard towards that goal. With the Godly Doctor here with us today, we have definitely met that goal.\u201d</p><br/><p>All the reporters were shocked. They never expected Chairman Bi to have such a high opinion of the Godly Doctor. This was completely different from the last two hospitals they had gone to.</p><br/><p>Those two hospitals absolutely hated this Godly Doctor for stealing away their business.</p><br/><p>The reporters wanted to continue to interview, but Chairman Bi automatically butted in. \u201cAfter the Godly Doctor is done with his session, our hospital would like to invite the Godly Doctor to be an honorary Chinese medicine specialist at the hospital. Hopefully, this would bridge the ties between Chinese and Western medicine and ultimately improve the quality of care for our patients.\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporters nodded their heads, taking down notes. They really agreed with what Chairman Bi was saying. With regards to the Godly Doctor\u2019s skill and knowledge, they had been fully convinced by Chairman Bi.</p><br/><p>The Jiangning region had a few hospitals around and Fu Bao Hospital had one of the highest reputations amongst them. Their medical facilities were high tech and their doctors were skilled.</p><br/><p>Just at this moment.</p><br/><p>Trouble came.</p><br/><p>A group of thugs who seemingly came from nowhere blocked the booth, preventing the patients who were queuing up from receiving treatment.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you guys doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you want to see the doctor, you have to queue up.\u201d</p><br/><p>However, these thugs just stood there and remained silent, forming a barrier between the Godly Doctor and the patients.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Are were blocking you guys? This is public property. Can\u2019t we stand wherever we please?\u201d one of the thugs shouted.</p><br/><p>His attitude was arrogant and offensive, and he looked like he was going to beat anyone up if they dared to oppose him.</p><br/><p>This guy needed a beating.</p><br/><p>The reporters were all confused. What was going on?</p><br/><p>\u201cThese guys\u2026\u201d Chairman Bi sighed.</p><br/><p>Chairman Bi explained the situation to the reporters, who felt indignant after hearing what had happened. They took up their cameras and started capturing the scene.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy fellow reporters, you guys should take pictures of their faces. This guy is from An Cheng and that guy is from Yan Jing and this guy\u2026 So take their pictures and broadcast it so that their family members can see what they are doing.\u201d</p><br/><p>The thugs were alarmed after hearing what Lin Fan said and they felt a little frightened.</p><br/><p>They became even more frightened after seeing the reporters taking their pictures and videoing them. They started looking downwards, shielding their faces.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is just despicable. But let\u2019s get real here. Just because your boss Wu Tao asked you to do this, you guys will be on the Internet tomorrow and the comments won\u2019t be pretty, and you\u2019ll be the shames of your families. Do you really want that?\u201d Lin Fan asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, this is just too much. The Godly Doctor is providing voluntary healthcare, treating the patients and you guys are doing something so heartless as to oppose him. No one will ever empathize with you guys.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStop taking photos\u2026stop taking photos\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>All the thugs were still young, some in their twenties, some in their thirties, some with families and friends. Once their families found out about them, they would definitely be shamed and scolded.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, they would definitely be shunned if their friends knew about this.</p><br/><p>They were really getting embarrassed.</p></div>\n</div>"}

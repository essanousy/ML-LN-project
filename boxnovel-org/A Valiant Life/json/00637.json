He constantly looked around, his heart feeling uncomfortable.</p><br/><p>\u201cMe too. What do you think Godfather Ma is doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid something big is about to happen. Godfather Ma has been spending quite some time inside with the journalists already. What about the people we sent into the station? Are they back yet?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh, they are.\u201d</p><br/><p>A young man rushed out of the police station, his face looking around in panic.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot good. Godfather Ma really gave himself out and he has spilled the beans. President Li, remember the time when you bribed him? Godfather Ma mentioned that also. All of us are screwed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone was in a huge shock, as if a bomb had just been released on them. What on earth was this young man talking about? Godfather Ma really gave himself up?</p><br/><p>This\u2026 this\u2026</p><br/><p>At this moment, the people snapped out of it.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot good. Let us hurry. If Godfather Ma really spills everything out, we are really screwed and we cant ever hope to get out of this mess.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWait, we won\u2019t have any problem. We are just entrepreneurs and have never hurt anyone before. We won\u2019t meet with any trouble. Most of us here maybe just gave him bribes, so if we were called in for questioning, the most that would happen would be the economy of Qing Zhou crashing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCorrect, that makes sense. We shouldn\u2019t be the ones worrying now. The ones that should be scrambling are the men who are directly associated with Godfather Ma. Godfather Ma holds many secrets and they are all part of it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>At one of the places where Godfather Ma\u2019s closest men stayed.</p><br/><p>Ding ding!</p><br/><p>I\u2019m taking a rest, so who on earth is calling?</p><br/><p>The person\u2019s hair was already white and he was already nearing sixty years old. He had a gentlemanly vibe about him and he was someone with a good temperament.</p><br/><p>He put on his slippers and dragged his feet across the room, picking up his phone.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello, this is Cheng Nian Liang speaking.\u201d</p><br/><p>His face was originally calm and peaceful, but in that instant, all life drained from his face. As he hung up, he dropped the phone with a loud thud.</p><br/><p>\u201cMa Mu Feng\u2026\u201d Cheng Nian Liang muttered, cursing under his breath. He picked up the phone again, making another phone calls.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello, this is an order. Go to the police station and get Ma Mu Feng back to our department so that no policeman can get near him.\u201d</p><br/><p>No one was going to sleep that night.</p><br/><p>The police station!</p><br/><p>The journalists were all looking at Ma Mu Feng in shock. They had lost count of how many crimes Ma Mu Feng had spoken of so far.</p><br/><p>Too many, just too many.</p><br/><p>Ding ding!</p><br/><p>Chen Chang Ping\u2019s phone was ringing. After picking up, his brows furrowed.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, Ma Mu Feng came to our station of his own will to give himself up. You guys are from Sheng Ting and have no right to interfere.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCommander Chen, what\u2019s up?\u201d Lin Fan asked.</p><br/><p>Chen Chang Ping looked at him, \u201cThe news of Ma Mu Feng giving himself up has spread and the people at Sheng Ting also want to interfere.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, we can\u2019t give him to them. I have a feeling that these guys from Sheng Ting are here to cause trouble.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMm,\u201d Chen Chang Ping nodded his head. \u201cI know that, and that\u2019s why I\u2019ve rejected them. This won\u2019t be an easy case to handle.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ding ding!</p><br/><p>At this moment, Commander Chen\u2019s phone started ringing again.</p><br/><p>Chen Chang Ping\u2019s face changed drastically as he saw the caller ID.</p><br/><p>Cheng Nian Liang.</p><br/><p>He picked up the phone.</p><br/><p>\u201cCommander Chen, I\u2019m calling you at night, I hope I\u2019m not interrupting you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Chen Chang Ping didn\u2019t want anyone from Sheng Ting coming, and wanted to deal with this as tactfully as possible.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo that\u2019s settled. I know what\u2019s going on and I asked the people from Sheng Ting to go and get him already. In a moment\u2019s time, you will receive them and don\u2019t you worry. I\u2019ll give you credit for this, I won\u2019t let your efforts go to waste.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, Director, I\u2019ll almost be done with him soon. You don\u2019t have to send him to Sheng Ting.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh? Are you defying my orders?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026\u201d Chen Chang Ping was caught in a difficult situation.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Ma Mu Feng looked at Chen Chang Ping, \u201cCommander Chen, is that Cheng Nian Liang?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Chang Ping nodded his head.</p><br/><p>The journalists were stunned as they heard the name \u2018Cheng Nian Liang\u2019. As journalists, they definitely knew who he was, and he was a huge figure in the media.</p><br/><p>Ma Mu Feng motioned for the phone, and thereafter, started speaking. \u201cCheng Nian Liang, this is Ma Mu Feng. I have given myself up to the authorities. You have been my close supporter for the longest time and you have gotten many benefits out of it, but now, it\u2019s time. I urge you to give yourself up too. You\u2019re different from me. I didn\u2019t ask for any mercy, but you\u2019re a big leader and if you tell the truth, you can still be forgiven.\u201d</p><br/><p>The journalists were shocked as they heard what Ma Mu Feng said to Cheng Nian Liang over the phone. Even Chen Chang Ping was stunned.</p><br/><p>In the end, Ma Mu Feng\u2019s closest supporter was him.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about? Do I know you? Don\u2019t you slander me!\u201d Cheng Nian Liang was flabbergasted. He never thought that Ma Mu Feng would be that direct and truthful about their relationship.</p><br/><p>Of all people, he expected Ma Mu Feng to have the intelligence to know what and what not to say.</p><br/><p>Ma Mu Feng heaved a huge sigh. \u201cEh, it\u2019s time. Why haven\u2019t you come clean? I don\u2019t wish to accuse anyone wrongly and I certainly don\u2019t wish to hurt anyone anymore. I\u2019m advising you for your own good. You have been my closest supporter for years and I don\u2019t wish to see you stray further and further away until you really regret it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cChen Chang Ping what are you doing? Why did you pass the phone to him? This person is framing me, do you understand?\u201d Cheng Nian Liang croaked, his voice trembling. If his heart was any weaker, he might have suffered from a heart attack.</p><br/><p>Ma Mu Fend shook his head. \u201cThe journalists are all around, and you shouldn\u2019t run anymore. All the evidence is on my hands now. I have recorded down every single bribe that you have given me over the years, and this society is just. I cannot just change the society to fit my needs. As a person of high stature, you shouldn\u2019t be doing harm to anyone. So, I must tell the truth about every single evil and bad thing that I have done.\u201d</p><br/><p>The people at the scene were all stunned, and they all froze in silence.</p><br/><p>The faces of the journalists were all terrified- this issue was becoming bigger and bigger.</p><br/><p>They had just woken up the tiger.</p><br/><p>\u201cMa Mu Feng, are you out of your mind\u2026\u201d Cheng Nian Liang croaked, his face looking sinister.</p><br/><p>He never thought that Ma Mu Feng would say all these in front of the journalists.</p><br/><p>This\u2026</p><br/><p>This was the end.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not out of my mind. In fact, I have woken up and have seen the error of my ways. I hope that you can meet Master Lin. I guarantee that after you hear his teaching, you will want to turn over a new leaf.\u201d</p><br/><p>Slam!</p><br/><p>The phone hung up before Ma Mu Feng could finish talking.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled. This issue was getting more fun. However, this issue wasn\u2019t his concern anymore. Thereafter, Lin Fan rested his hands on Chen Chang Ping\u2019s shoulders.</p><br/><p>\u201cCommander Chen, this case is not under my jurisdiction anymore. I\u2019m handing everything to you,\u201d Lin Fan said, before turning to the journalists. \u201cMy fellow journalists, I hope that you have understood the truth of this situation. I leave it up to you if you want to report this case. But I must remind you that as journalists, you fight for justice. If you make this news public, you will be the heroes of Qing Zhou.\u201d</p><br/><p>The journalists looked upwards with an air of confidence after hearing what Lin Fan had said.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, we are journalists and must uphold justice in society.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI believe in the government and the law, and we must bring all things to the light.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan packed up and left after seeing that things have pretty much settled themselves.</p><br/><p>This issue was huge, and it was rather fun to meddle in it.</p><br/><p>Chen Chang Ping wanted to keep Lin Fan awhile longer, hoping to use his rational judgment, since the case was getting more complicated and the thought of bearing this on his shoulders terrified him.</p><br/><p>The instigator of this case was about to entrust everything to him. Could he do it?</p></div>\n</div>"}

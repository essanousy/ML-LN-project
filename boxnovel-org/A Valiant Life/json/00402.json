It's so dazzling that I'm going blind. Although I don't know what he's drawing, his movements and his appearance are making me orgasm.\"</p><br/><p>\"This time, I will definitely pay close attention all the way. I won't miss a single second. We're witnessing a marvel.\"</p><br/><p>At the site.</p><br/><p>Tao Shi Gang and the rest were holding their breaths. Yue Qiu Ju Shi's hands were trembling slightly as if he was very excited. His specialty was in painting birds and flowers, and at that moment, Master Lin was doing a painting of birds and flowers. This filled him with anticipation.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing didn't really understand all this but his expression was imposing. He felt as if his teacher's aura was clearly different from before. Just like in Chinese Medicine, putting your heart into the process produces a different outcome. Zhao Ming Qing felt as if every stroke of his teacher's brush encompassed his essence, energy, and spirit.</p><br/><p>Although a painting is displayed on a piece of canvas, you can differentiate between professionals and average people with one look.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan's speed was getting faster and faster, then, something happened that caused everyone to be shocked. Lin Fan used two brushes to paint at the same time. He was multitasking. The hundred birds looking up to the Phoenix each had its own unique form and this painting was different. Since he was presenting it to a friend, Lin Fan was not stingy.</p><br/><p>\"Brilliant\u2026\" Tao Shi Gang couldn't help but exclaim. Then, he immediately shut up as if he was afraid of affecting Master Lin's work.</p><br/><p>Afterward, he looked at Yue Qiu Ju Shi and saw that Yue Qiu Ju Shi's eyes were bright was full of emotion as he gazed unblinkingly at the scene before him. He wouldn't miss a single stroke.</p><br/><p>At that moment, the place was silent and only the sound of Lin Fan's painting could be heard.</p><br/><p>His brush strokes were like a dragon, floating about.</p><br/><p>In that instant, Yue Qiu Ju Shi was shaken. Although the painting hadn't been completed, just all of this was enough to make him feel inferior. Not just in terms of knowledge but also in terms of skill, there was a difference of heaven and earth. It was like there was a huge chasm that he just couldn't leap across.</p><br/><p>\"It's coming to life\u2026\" Yue Qiu Ju Shi suddenly exclaimed in shock. His feet shuffled backward furiously. In his eyes, the birds in the painting seemed to have taken flight and perched on the branches. They had peculiar forms but they were like living creatures. In his eyes, they were vivid and realistic.</p><br/><p>But this expression didn't last for long before Yue Qiu Ju Shi hurriedly shut his mouth in shock and even covered it with his hands. He didn't dare to make a sound but even so, his body kept trembling furiously.</p><br/><p>Brilliant. Simply brilliant.</p><br/><p>To him, this unfinished painting was already shocking enough. If it were to be completed, how terrified would he be?</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing was looking at his teacher in shock. He realized that his teacher's talents were getting more and more stunning. Although he didn't understand it, his eyes were gleaming. This piece of work wasn't completed yet but the concept had already developed and a distinct style was emanating from it.</p><br/><p>Tao Shi Gang muttered to himself, \"A spirit is flowing through this painting and shining through it. It's a masterpiece to be passed down for generations.\"</p><br/><p>*Clatter!*</p><br/><p>With a flick of his wrist, Lin Fan used the last ten Encyclopedic Points to temporarily unlock the calligraphy knowledge. Then, he brandished his brush as he drew a few words at the side of the canvas.</p><br/><p>\"A hundred birds facing the Phoenix, a golden age of peace and prosperity.\"</p><br/><p>\"Master Lin presents to an art friend: Yue Qiu Ju Shi\"</p><br/><p>Sadly, he didn't have a stamp. He put down the brush and displayed the artwork in front of everyone.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan took a deep breath and wiped the sweat from his forehead. Although he had the Encyclopedia's knowledge, placing all his energy and focus into a painting was still mentally taxing.</p><br/><p>\"The drawing is complete. I don't have a stamp at the moment. You may take a look.\"</p><br/><p>Yue Qiu Ju Shi couldn't wait to go forward. He didn't dare to place his hands on the drawing table. Instead, he placed them behind his back. He was afraid that he would dirty this appalling artwork in front of him.</p><br/><p>\"Good, good. This rich and luxurious form with the calming energy resembles nature itself. It seems to have perfected something that is already outstanding and it is such a lifelike and vivid portrayal!\" Yue Qiu Ju Shi was not stingy with his praises. When he saw the line of words at the end, his eyes turned red and tears started to flow.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was momentarily stunned. This guy is a little too much. Crying just from seeing a painting. This...this\u2026</p><br/><p>\"I never thought...I never thought that I, Wu Zhong Hai, would be able to witness such a masterpiece of a painting in this lifetime. I have no more regrets in this life!\" said Yue Qiu Ju Shi.</p><br/><p>'Wu Zhong Hai' was Yue Qiu Ju Shi's real name. Lin Fan had never thought that this old man would get so emotional.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. \"Teacher Yue, you're praising me too highly. It's just a show of my lowly skills.\"</p><br/><p>At that point, Yue Qiu Ju Shi looked at Lin Fan in a different light. He had now witnessed Master Lin's true abilities and was prostrating himself in admiration.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, in the broadcast room, the netizens were astonished.</p><br/><p>\"F*ck, that's way too impressive. Even through the screen, this painting is so dazzling that I'm going blind.\"</p><br/><p>\"Lin Fan is too awesome. Just a single painting has stunned this old man. He's simply nature-defying.\"</p><br/><p>\"Haha, Master Lin is too f*cking awesome.\"</p><br/><p>\"I never thought that even Master Lin's Chinese arts were this impressive. What else does he know? He should just show us everything at once.\"</p><br/><p>Chinese traditional arts had been passed down for a long time and it is timeless because a true masterpiece encompasses a distinct style that can never be recreated by anyone else.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Yue Qiu Ju Shi's gaze couldn't be shifted. He kept staring at the painting as if he couldn't get enough of it even if he looked at it for a whole lifetime. He specialized in birds and flowers and he looked closely at every single bird on the painting. They each had unique forms and they were extremely lifelike. Even he was not able to reach such a level.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed as he stood at the side. \"Teacher Yue, I'm giving this painting to you. You can slowly study it when you go back.\"</p><br/><p>Then, Yue Qiu Ju Shi's mind was shaken. He looked up at Lin Fan, then waved his hand. \"I can't accept it. I can't accept it. Master Lin, this painting of yours has reached a new peak in Chinese traditional arts. It's beyond those artworks that have been passed down through generations. They can't even amount to ten percent of this painting in terms of charm. This painting is too precious. Even all of my paintings can't amount to ten percent of this painting, maybe not even one percent. This is a priceless treasure. I can't accept it.\"</p><br/><p>Tao Shi Gang had already been stunned by this painting. He was in agreement with Brother Yue Qiu.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan sighed. \"Alright, alright. We were supposed to exchange paintings. If you don't accept it, that means you're looking down on me. I'll tear it right now\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"Don't\u2026 You mustn't do that. You really mustn't!\" said Yue Qiu Ju Shi hastily, \"If such a masterpiece is destroyed in front of my eyes, even if I die, I wouldn't be able to die in peace.\"</p><br/><p>\"Why are you speaking about death on such an auspicious day? I'm giving this painting to you. Will you accept it or not?\" said Lin Fan. He really didn't know what was going on in the heads of these Chinese art masters. It was just a painting. Was there a need for all this?</p><br/><p>But after some thinking, Lin Fan thought that it was reasonable. Everyone had their own beliefs and these people had been immersed in Chinese arts their whole lives. Their feelings towards Chinese arts were very deep. To them, nothing could replace Chinese arts, except, of course, family.</p><br/><p>And to some crazy fans of Chinese arts, even family couldn't compare to this artwork. It was a little perverse.</p><br/><p>\"Now, I'm going to do a painting for Teacher Tao,\" said Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Tao Shi Gang immediately stopped him. \"Master Lin, you should have a good rest. There's no rush. Since this painting has already been done, it's not right not to accept it. But the painting that you are giving to me hasn't been done yet. I can't accept it. It's better if you have a rest. Have a rest\u2026\"</p><br/><p>At that moment, Lin Fan really couldn't understand it. It was just a painting. Was there a need to act like this?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

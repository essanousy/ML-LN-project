Then, he turned to the nurse beside him and said, \u201cQuick, bring the godly doctor to change and then to surgical room 2.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRoger.\u201d</p><br/><p>The doctor and nurses started to prepare everything.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease excuse me, there\u2019s an emergency!\u201d The nurses shouted to make way for the stretcher.</p><br/><p>Elder Chen and Elder Liang had been following behind closely. They were in an extremely bad mood, especially Elder Chen, who was mumbling Buddhist scriptures to seek help from the Heavens.</p><br/><p>Everything was prepared in the surgical room.</p><br/><p>The doctor who was supposed to operate on Chen Liang started to prepare but he was stopped by the doctor beside him. \u201cDoctor Ma, you can\u2019t handle this surgery, someone else is doing it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Doctor Ma frowned, \u201cWhat are you doing? His injuries are so serious and you\u2019re bothered by who\u2019s going to do it? Quick, we have to operate on him now.\u201d</p><br/><p>The doctor shook his head, \u201cNo, the godly doctor said nobody else besides him can operate on him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Doctor Ma was furious, he was the head doctor of the hospital but he was being stopped. Then, Doctor Ma was stunned, \u201cGodly doctor? What godly doctor?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGodly doctor Lin from Cloud Street. The patient jumped from the sixth level and his life got sustained by the godly doctor. However, a lot of his organs and bones have broken and he has to be operated right away. However, the operation is extremely complicated. Doctor Ma, although your medical skills are superb, you will definitely not be able to handle this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Doctor Ma knew about the reputation of the godly doctor. Then, he asked, \u201cThe godly doctor is really going to operate on him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. The godly doctor will do it personally.\u201d</p><br/><p>Doctor Ma didn\u2019t think about anything else. \u201cAlright, I will inform the Director. This is a major accident, where are the family members of the patient?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey\u2019re signing the consent form for the surgery. Although it is done by the godly doctor, we have to follow the rules,\u201d the doctor said.</p><br/><p>Doctor Ma nodded. Then, he rushed out. When he walked out, he noticed a doctor who was about to enter the room. Then, he stopped and looked. \u201cAre you the godly doctor?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked extremely serious, \u201cLet\u2019s start.\u201d</p><br/><p>The nurses and doctors nodded. Although they weren\u2019t going to operate on him, they knew the problem.</p><br/><p>In the hospital.</p><br/><p>When he reached the Director\u2019s office, the Director rushed out.</p><br/><p>\u201cDirector, the godly doctor is in our hospital,\u201d Doctor Ma said anxiously.</p><br/><p>The Director nodded, \u201cI have already been notified. Gather all the doctors who are available now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Doctor Ma nodded, \u201cWe have to gather all of them. We only know that the Chinese medical skills of the godly doctor are superb. Furthermore, he said that his Western medical skills are incredible too. If we could witness an operation, it would be of great help to us.\u201d</p><br/><p>Outside the surgical room.</p><br/><p>Elder Chen was anxiously walking around. He wouldn\u2019t be able to relax unless his son is out of danger.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Chen, don\u2019t be afraid and don\u2019t worry. He\u2019ll be okay,\u201d Elder Liang tried to console him.</p><br/><p>Elder Chen didn\u2019t say anything but Elder Liang could tell that he was extremely frightened.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Chen, how did it go?\u201d Then, Sister Hong from Cloud Street came with some other people.</p><br/><p>When they heard about the news, they were completely stunned. They didn\u2019t expect Elder Chen\u2019s son to really encounter a tragedy. Then, they quickly rushed over after closing their shops.</p><br/><p>Initially, more people wanted to come over but were stopped by Sister Hong. If a lot of people came, the situation would be too messy. Hence, only a few of them came on behalf of the others.</p><br/><p>Elder Liang shook his head, \u201cWe don\u2019t know what\u2019s the situation like. He is currently in the midst of operation.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sister Hong replied, \u201cElder Chen, don\u2019t worry. There wouldn\u2019t be a problem with the hospital bills. The people at Cloud Street have agreed to split the bill equally among all of us.\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Chen cried when he heard that. \u201cThank you, everyone\u2026\u201d Other than that, he didn\u2019t know what to say.</p><br/><p>Elder Liang said, \u201cDon\u2019t be too worried. Little Boss is operating on Lil\u2019 Liang. You guys should know how incredible Little Boss\u2019 medical skills are. There would definitely be no problem.\u201d</p><br/><p>The crowd heaved a sigh of relief when they heard that. \u201cLuckily Little Boss is here. Then, there would definitely be no problem.\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Chen was still feeling extremely down. He was never this worried before.</p><br/><p>They were really confident of Little Boss and they felt that Little Boss would definitely resolve the problem.</p><br/><p>The Director brought the doctors to watch the video footage of the surgical procedures. They were able to see the situation in the surgical room.</p><br/><p>One of the doctors said regretfully.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t see clearly at all. If only we could be inside.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAccording to the patient\u2019s test report, his situation is extremely serious. Even if we were operating on him, we probably wouldn\u2019t stand a chance. Also, even if the operation was a success, the patient would still be in danger. I wonder if things would be different if the godly doctor handles it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know but based on the godly doctor\u2019s medical skills, I am pretty confident.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLook, what\u2019re the needles around the patient\u2019s heart for?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe nurses said that they were needed to ensure blood circulation. However, does it really work! It doesn\u2019t seem to have any scientific evidence.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt should be a Chinese medical procedure. This time, we will be witnessing a fusion of Chinese and Western medicine. I\u2019m so excited.\u201d</p><br/><p>The godly doctor was reputable in the medical world. The surgeons really wanted to meet and interact with him.</p><br/><p>In the surgical room.</p><br/><p>\u201cGodly doctor, the patient is losing a lot of blood,\u201d a doctor said anxiously.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded, \u201cOkay, I know that. Continue cleaning the wounds. I will resolve that. Pass me some acupuncture needles.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRoger.\u201d</p><br/><p>The atmosphere in the surgical room was tense but everything was running smoothly.</p><br/><p>During the surgery, the patient had been in a lot of dangerous situations. If it was left to them to resolve it, they\u2019d definitely be lost. However, under the lead of Lin Fan, everything was going according to plan even though it was a little rushed.</p><br/><p>The dangerous situations were gradually improving.</p><br/><p>The doctors and nurses in the surgical room were completely stunned. If they hadn\u2019t seen it with their own eyes, they wouldn\u2019t have believed that this was real.</p><br/><p>They felt that it was simply unbelievable. The small needles were actually capable of producing such great effects.</p><br/><p>If they weren\u2019t personally involved, they might never ever have known about how dangerous and complicated the situation was.</p><br/><p>Even the most experienced doctors were impressed by the way the godly doctor was handling the situation.</p><br/><p>This matter was simply unbelievable.</p><br/><p>Time past really quickly.</p><br/><p>Four hours later.</p><br/><p>The lights outside the surgical room became dim.</p><br/><p>*bang*</p><br/><p>The door was slammed open.</p><br/><p>Everyone at the walkway held their breaths.</p><br/><p>started trembling with fear. \u201cPlease be fine, please be fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>A silhouette emerged.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan wiped the sweat from his forehead and smiled, \u201cHe is fine now, he is out of the danger period.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, everyone gasped.</p><br/><p>There was a thunderous clap.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, it\u2019s nothing much.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Boss is incredible.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAwesome, Little Boss!\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Chen was so grateful that he didn\u2019t know what to say. He just cried and held Lin Fan\u2019s hand. \u201cLittle Boss, thank you so much, thank you so much\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cStop thanking me. You already gave me apples. You don\u2019t have to thank me anymore. You have to thank these doctors and nurses too. I wouldn\u2019t have been able to accomplish it without them.</p><br/><p>The doctors and nurses chuckled. They were also in a good mood. After all, they literally brought a patient back from the God of Death. Although they didn\u2019t do much, at least they were involved in something.</p></div>\n</div>"}

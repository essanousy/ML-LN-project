When he heard what was going on in the room, he felt a little curious about Master Lin. He wondered what Master Lin did for a living as he was extremely violent and ruthless.</p><br/><p>Everyone was extremely frightened when they heard Young Master Jiang\u2019s voice coming from the private room, especially the three wealthy youngsters who were with Young Master Jiang. They hadn\u2019t expected this to happen. Young Master Jiang was actually being reprimanded by a random stranger.</p><br/><p>If others were to find out about this, nobody would believe it.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang was almost done vomiting. It was as if he was a different person but he was still confused. \u201cWhy am I here? Yun Gang, I think I saw my brother here. Where is he?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Yun Gang held onto Wang Ming Yang helplessly. At the same time, he was shocked by what Master Lin was doing in the private room.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin is inside teaching him a lesson. This time, we\u2019re doomed.\u201d That was all Wu Yun Gang could say.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang walked unsteadily to the door but was blocked by Lil\u2019 Wang. Then, he supported himself on his knees, \u201cBro, please let me in. My friend is inside. You\u2019re blocking the way.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lil\u2019 Wang looked at the drunkard and moved aside slightly. Wang Ming Yang stood outside the door and took a peek. \u201cBrother, what are you doing? Young Master Jiang, why are you kneeling in front of my friend? Brother, why did you make Young Master Jiang kneel in front of you? Even the notable leaders in Shanghai have to greet him as Young Master Jiang. Are you better than the notable leaders?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at Wang Ming Yang. \u201cShut up. You are so drunk. Do you even know basic arithmetics?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Wang Ming Yang raised his head and smiled. \u201cThat\u2019s a simple question, how could I not know? 1+1 = 3. Even a small kid knows the answer. Do you think I\u2019m dumb?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re indeed dumb.\u201d Lin Fan was extremely angry when he saw Wang Ming Yang in this state. Wang Ming Yang had been in the society for so long but he hadn\u2019t even thought about protecting himself. He deserved to be fed so much alcohol.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not dumb\u2026\u201d Wang Ming Yang rebutted. Then, Wu Yun Gang went to Wang Ming Yang. \u201cMing Yang, come over here and have a rest. Stop moving.\u201d</p><br/><p>In the room.</p><br/><p>When Young Master Jiang heard what Wang Ming Yang said, he felt that he was being mocked. He was infuriated.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho are you? I\u2019ll admit defeat today but I will remember this. I can make sure you end up on the ground in Beijing,\u201d Young Master Jiang threatened. He spoke in a furious tone. He looked as if he was going to eat him up.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan could tell that he wasn\u2019t a typical citizen. If a normal person infuriated Young Master Jiang, they\u2019d be dead. But Lin Fan wasn\u2019t a normal person. He wasn\u2019t afraid at all and he didn\u2019t care about this person\u2019s background. This guy had to pay the price for bullying his friends.</p><br/><p>He was especially furious when he saw Wang Ming Yang still in a state of confusion.</p><br/><p>\u201cHere, finish it.\u201d Lin Fan immediately pulled Young Master Jiang\u2019s lips open and poured the wine into his mouth.</p><br/><p>It irritated his throat so much so that Young Master Jiang\u2019s face turned really red. He tried extremely hard to break free but he could only drink under Lin Fan\u2019s control.</p><br/><p>Young Master Zhao was stunned. \u201cSister Yan, please get people to enter the room and save Young Master Jiang.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sister Yan was dumbfounded. She just stood there and didn\u2019t know what to say. The situation inside was not something that she could control.</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung Master Zhao, I can\u2019t do anything about it. I can only wait for my brother-in-law to come here,\u201d Sister Yan said.</p><br/><p>Young Master Ma said anxiously, \u201cWhen he\u2019s here, this would already be over. Where are your security officers? Let them in. What are you thinking about?\u201d</p><br/><p>Young Master Huang was at a loss. \u201cSister Yan, if something happens to Young Master Jiang, you should know the consequences. Do you think Tian Yun Villa will be able to avoid it?</p><br/><p>\u201cAh!\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, Young Master Jiang made a loud cry inside the private room.</p><br/><p>The crowd didn\u2019t know what had happened but when they saw what was happening through the small gap, they started sweating.</p><br/><p>Young Master Jiang shook his head. \u201cI can\u2019t drink, I can\u2019t drink anymore. Stop this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t drink anymore?\u201d Lin Fan smiled. \u201cEven if you can\u2019t drink, you have to drink it. Do you know Wang Ming Yang\u2019s relationship with me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Young Master Jiang couldn\u2019t even retaliate against Lin Fan. An entire bottle of wine had entered his stomach and he felt like he was about to die.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour friend, your friend. He is your good friend\u2026\u201d Young Master Jiang said hurriedly. He wasn\u2019t regretting what he had done, he just hadn\u2019t expected this to happen to him in Tian Yun Villa.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan raised his hand and slapped Young Master Jiang\u2019s face. Wine immediately spewed out of his mouth. \u201cF*ck. You know he\u2019s my bro and you dared to make things difficult for him? I\u2019ll just put it this way. If you don\u2019t finish the alcohol here today, even if the King were to come here, you can forget about leaving.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not possible, I\u2019ll die.\u201d Young Master Jiang looked at all the bottles of wine on the table. His head was spinning and if he were to finish everything, he\u2019d be finished.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cNo problem, just finish it. I won\u2019t let you die. At least before you finish it, I won\u2019t let you die.\u201d</p><br/><p>He wouldn\u2019t just forget about this matter. Young Master Jiang indeed had a reputable status and he wanted to frighten Lin Fan. Hopefully, he might feel traumatized after that and become a better person.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan could return to Shanghai but Wu Yun Gang was situated in Beijing and Wang Ming Yang would go there occasionally. He couldn\u2019t possibly follow them all the time. Hence, he could only make Young Master Jiang feel defeated so that if he were to think of taking revenge, he\u2019d think of today and the consequences of his actions.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan felt that this was the angriest he had ever been.</p><br/><p>Then, outside.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d A curious middle-aged man walked from the distance. There were a few tall and muscular men following behind him.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother-in-law.\u201d Sister Yan was elated when she saw him.</p><br/><p>When Young Master Zhao and the others saw him, they felt a little fearful. He was the boss of Tian Ming Villa, Jin Sheng Wen.</p><br/><p>He worked extremely hard for his business and he was a capable man. He was powerful in the triad world as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung Master Zhao, Young Master Ma, and Young Master Huang, what happened?\u201d Jing Sheng Wen addressed them like that but he still looked arrogant. He didn\u2019t think much about the three of them at all. After all, he was on the same level as their dads.</p><br/><p>Young Master Zhao quickly went forward. \u201cBrother Wen, you\u2019re finally here. Young Master Jiang was dragged into the private room by a peasant and now he\u2019s getting reprimanded by him. You have to quickly save him. If not, things are going to get worse.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jin Sheng Wen frowned. He hadn\u2019t expected someone to cause trouble in his territory. He looked at the men standing at the entrance. \u201cWhat do you guys do for a living? What are you looking at? Hurry up and save him. I want to see the person who dared to cause trouble here on my territory. He must be asking for trouble.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Yun Gang was busy taking care of Wang Ming Yang and when he saw the person who had come, his face changed.</p><br/><p>Wu Yun Gang could ignore anyone else but this person.</p><br/><p>If even he\u2019s here, then\u2026we\u2019re done for.</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/a-valiant-life-chapter-439-the-violent-master-lin\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 439 - The violent Master Lin\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/a-valiant-life-chapter-441-a-powerful-individual\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 441 - A powerful individual\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"78264\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

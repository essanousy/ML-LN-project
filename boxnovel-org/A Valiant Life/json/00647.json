This lad was getting more aggressive. She actually started to be more touchy towards Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe,\u201d Wu You Lan smiled happily. \u201cIt\u2019ll be better later. Look at the surroundings. Everyone is doing that too. Furthermore, a pretty woman like me sticking to you would make you feel more proud.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled and shook his head, \u201cYou must be trying to take advantage of me. Just say that. Don\u2019t tell me about other people.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan didn\u2019t reply him. She just stuck closely to Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>This time, Wu You Lan dressed very fashionably and she looked beautiful. Her long hair was tucked neatly behind her. Her bright eyes would curve into a moon shape when she smiled and it was really attractive.</p><br/><p>Some youngsters would sneakily look at her and think of something in common.</p><br/><p>How beautiful.</p><br/><p>Perfect figure.</p><br/><p>Snowy white skin.</p><br/><p>Beautiful smile.</p><br/><p>If only she was my girlfriend.</p><br/><p>It was a pity that they could only think of it. They knew that she belonged to Lin Fan and her legs looked like they were going to be beautiful forever.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan patted Wu You Lan\u2019s head, \u201cLet\u2019s go in.\u201d</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t avoid the intimate contact and she was happy about it.</p><br/><p>It was her first time going out with Brother Lin alone and there weren\u2019t any extra guests.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan felt that it was great to relax once in a while. It felt exceptionally great to be accompanied by a beautiful lady.</p><br/><p>\u201cWow! Brother Lin, let\u2019s go see the monkeys,\u201d Wu You Lan dragged Lin Fan and looked around. She was like a lively fairy.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cLook at you. Why are you so lively? You\u2019re just like one of them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan smiled and hugged Lin Fan\u2019s arms. She said cutely, \u201cBrother Lin, how could you say that? I\u2019m not a monkey.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s cute,\u201d Lin Fan chuckled. \u201cI remember when I saw you for the first time. You weren\u2019t like that. You were even bickering with me on Weibo.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSince when did that happen?\u201d Wu You Lan was a little embarrassed when she thought of the past. \u201cI only did that because you fought with my dad. If someone were to fight with you now, I\u2019d argue with the person too.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan just smiled and didn\u2019t say anything else besides, \u201cLet\u2019s continue looking around.\u201d</p><br/><p>Since he agreed to follow Wu You Lan out to play, he wanted to play his hearts out.</p><br/><p>He continued to move forward and there were even more people. They were moving forward slower than before.</p><br/><p>Then, a man was being squeezed by the people in front and he flew towards Wu You Lan. Lin Fan immediately stretched out his hand and blocked the man. Then, he smiled, \u201cBro, the road isn\u2019t that squeezy. Don\u2019t try to do that on purpose.\u201d</p><br/><p>The youngster was a little embarrassed when he heard that. He had been noticing Wu You Lan for a long time. He didn\u2019t expect to meet a beautiful lady like her in the zoo. He wanted to touch her amidst the crowd. However, he didn\u2019t expect the man beside her to see through his tricks.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan furrowed his brows and stared at the youngster.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cYou Lan, come to my right side.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan nodded and walked the other side. It felt great to be protected by someone.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Outside the zoo.</p><br/><p>A family of three was walking towards the zoo.</p><br/><p>\u201cDad, will I be able to see the giant panda later?\u201d A young boy asked with excitement.</p><br/><p>The middle-aged man\u2019s face was red and he seemed a little drunk, \u201cSon, you\u2019ll be able to see it later when we\u2019re in there.\u201d</p><br/><p>The middle-aged lady said, \u201cI told you not to drink in the afternoon and you still drank so much.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I didn\u2019t drink a lot. You can bring our son inside first. I\u2019ll try to go in via the shortcut there. The tickets are too expensive,\u201d Zhu Shou Jun said.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you trying to avoid it? Just buy a ticket.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy should I buy it when I can just enter secretly? Our son is too young for us to do it together. If not, I\u2019d have asked you to follow me. Go in first, I\u2019ll look for you later.\u201d After saying that, Zhu Shou Jun left and went to the secret spot.</p><br/><p>His wife looked at him and turned away before bringing their son to buy tickets.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Zhu Shou Jun walked on the muddy road. Then, he saw a high cliff. It was at least 70 degrees steep. When he looked at it, he saw that there was a tree branch that was sticking out. It formed a natural ladder and climbing up was pretty easy.</p><br/><p>He felt that he should save money when he could. He didn\u2019t see a need to spend money on the zoo tickets.</p><br/><p>Zhu Shou Jun walked and thought about it. After a while, he saw a high metal gauze that blocked the road. However, there were two big holes in it. He immediately bent over and entered.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are fierce beasts inside. Do not enter.\u201d</p><br/><p>After walking for a while, he saw the signboard and smiled, \u201cThe people at the zoo are good at scaring people. They actually placed a signboard here. Why would there be any stupid beasts here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, he continued walking forward and saw another similar signboard.</p><br/><p>Zhu Shou Jun was getting a little doubtful. Then, he reached a 3-meter high wall which made things very difficult. How was he going to climb over it?</p><br/><p>Then, he saw that there was a wooden ladder beside it. If he were to lean it against the wall and climb it, he would be able to reach the top.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, what stupid fearsome beasts? The tools for climbing over are also here. I wonder how many people have climbed over,\u201d Zhu Shou Jun thought to himself. It was obvious that the ladder was for people to climb over. Then, he leaned it against the wall and climbed it before jumping over to the other side.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Lin Fan and Wu You Lan went to see the giant panda. It was indeed a national symbol. It was really cute.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Lin, Tuan Tuan is so cute,\u201d Wu You Lan said.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, the dark circles around his eyes are pretty bad.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan replied, \u201cTuan Tuan is a panda, the dark circles are obviously really black.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled, \u201cHaha, what are we going to look at next?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan thought about it, \u201cI don\u2019t know, let\u2019s just walk around. Anyway, the zoo has a lot of animals that I\u2019ve never seen before.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, they walked around leisurely and looked at the animals.</p><br/><p>However, Lin Fan would try to communicate with the animals. Others wouldn\u2019t have understood what the animals were saying but Lin Fan had no problems communicating with them.</p><br/><p>Then, a series of cries could be heard from a short distance away.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan raised her head in doubt, \u201cWhat happened there?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s have a look\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan reached there, he looked down and was dumbfounded. Why was there a man in there? The man was surrounded by five fearsome tigers. They looked as if they were going to charge at him.</p><br/><p>The people standing on the visitors\u2019 platform were screaming in fear. They\u2019ve never seen something like this before.</p><br/><p>The zoo workers rushed over with inadequate equipment. They could only use gunshots to scare the tigers.</p><br/><p>The visitors were frantic.</p><br/><p>\u201cSomeone\u2019s going to die. Where is the anesthetic gun?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey went to take it already but I think it\u2019s going to be too late.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, the tiger is going to move. Quick, try to draw him away.\u201d</p><br/><p>The zoo workers were also stunned. The air rifles were useless. They were only used to scare the tigers. When the tigers were used to it, they wouldn\u2019t have cared about it.</p><br/><p>\u201cWa\u2026 Daddy\u2026\u201d A young child was crying there and the woman beside her was crying too.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shook his head. He could tell what the situation was with one look.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou Lan, hold onto my phone,\u201d Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan was stunned, \u201cBrother Lin, what are you doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to save him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, Lin Fan immediately jumped down from the five-meter high platform.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, someone just jumped down.\u201d</p><br/><p>The crowd was stunned and they started to scream in fear. This man was literally going to get himself killed.</p></div>\n</div>"}

Zhao Li Xing and the rest, as his children, had been standing by their father\u2019s side the whole time. To them, this might be their last time seeing their father.</p><br/><p>Hence, at this moment, they had set aside all their work.</p><br/><p>Elder Mu and the rest visited the hospital every day too to accompany Zhao Ming Qing. After so many years of friendship, suddenly, they only had a limited number of days left together. They all felt that it was unbearable.</p><br/><p>But fortunately, Elder Zhao was calm and steady. He wasn\u2019t in any pain. This at least made them feel better.</p><br/><p>Outside.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d Zhao Li Xing had gone into a quarrel with a group of people at the entrance.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-2\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cHello, these are our credentials.\u201d The middle-aged man had brought his people with him to the hospital. When Zhao Li Xing stopped him, he didn\u2019t retaliate but just took out his credentials.</p><br/><p>Zhao Li Xing looked at the credentials and his emotions settled down. \u201cMay I know what you\u2019re here for?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe want to know where Master Lin is,\u201d said the middle-aged man. He had come from Beijing to bring Master Lin there.</p><br/><p>Zhao Li Xing shook his head. \u201cWe don\u2019t know where Master Lin is either. Ever since my father was admitted to the hospital, we haven\u2019t been able to contact him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Xiang Bei\u2019s brows furrowed, appearing not to believe him. \u201cThen allow us to disturb you for a moment. We would like to have a few words with Mister Elder Zhao.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing that, Zhao Li Xing immediately blocked the entrance. \u201cNo. My dad is in a terrible state. He cannot be disturbed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMister Zhao, I hope that you can understand. This matter is very important. I have to know where Master Lin is. Right now, I\u2019m afraid only Mister Elder Zhao would know. We would like to speak to him,\u201d said Chen Xiang Bei.</p><br/><p>Zhao Li Xing said, \u201cMy dad doesn\u2019t even know. He\u2019s waiting for Master Lin as we speak. My dad is Master Lin\u2019s disciple and, in his last moments, he wants to see his teacher once more. Please don\u2019t disturb him. Is that alright?\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-3\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cBrother, what\u2019s going on?\u201d Zhao Qun Fang came from afar and asked suspiciously.</p><br/><p>Seeing these big men standing outside the entrance, she felt that something wasn\u2019t right.</p><br/><p>Zhao Li Xing gave his sister a brief explanation. When Zhao Qun Fang heard about the opposite party\u2019s identities, she was startled. But their father\u2019s situation was really not good, how could he have the strength to answer their questions? Of course, she would not agree.</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone, you cannot go in. We are telling the truth. We really don\u2019t know where Master Lin is,\u201d said Zhao Qun Fang.</p><br/><p>Chen Xiang Bei seemed not to believe them. \u201cThen please excuse me.\u201d Then, he shifted his eyes to the side.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d Zhao Li Xing was startled. He struggled but he was being held down by the man next to him. He couldn\u2019t even move.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, we won\u2019t disturb Mister Elder Zhao. We just want to ask a few questions,\u201d said Chen Xiang Bei. Then, he pushed open the door and entered. When he saw Zhao Shi inside, he nodded at her. Then, he moved a stool to the bedside and sat down.</p><br/><p>He looked at Mister Elder Zhao on the bed, lying with his eyes closed. This was the Director Zhao who had contributed to the development of the anorexia and leukemia prescriptions.</p><br/><p>But even if his medical ability was even greater, when his time ran out, he would be unable to be revived.</p><br/><p>\u201cMister Elder Zhao, can you hear me? I\u2019m Chen Xiang Bei. I came from Beijing and I have an important matter that requires me to look for Master Lin. Do you know where he is?\u201d Chen Xiang Bei asked.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-4\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>But Zhao Ming Qing, who was lying on the bed, did not respond at all. His eyes did not even blink. If the machine by the side did not indicate his heartbeat, Chen Xiang Bei would\u2019ve thought he was already dead.</p><br/><p>\u201cMister Elder Zhao, did you hear me?\u201d asked Chen Xiang Bei once more.</p><br/><p>Zhao Shi walked over. \u201cMy husband is asleep. Please do not disturb him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Xiang Bei said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, please understand. I have to find Master Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease leave,\u201d Zhao Shi requested again.</p><br/><p>Outside, Zhao Li Xing and Zhao Qun Fang were being held down but they didn\u2019t scream or shout as they were afraid of disturbing their father.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Elder Mu came from afar. When he saw Zhao Li Xing and Zhao Qun Fang being held down, he rushed over.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho are you? What do you want?\u201d Elder Mu demanded sternly. This was a hospital, how could there be such people here? And when he looked inside the ward, he realized that there was a stranger inside.</p><br/><p>And he saw that Zhao Shi seemed to be controlling her rage and negotiating with the man.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d Elder Mu went in and asked with a hushed voice.</p><br/><p>Chen Xiang Bei took out his credentials and showed them to Elder Mu.</p><br/><p>When Elder Mu saw them, he furrowed his brows. He hadn\u2019t expected them to be important people. But even after he saw it, he still asked, \u201cPlease leave. Don\u2019t disturb my friend.\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-5\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Chen Xiang Bei furrowed his brows and was about to speak.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease leave.\u201d Elder Mu repeated sternly. He hadn\u2019t thought that these people would be so outrageous, to charge into this place just for their own selfish reasons despite knowing that his friend was on the verge of dying. It was simply outrageous.</p><br/><p>Then, at this moment, a voice rang out from outside.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Xiang Bei was just about to negotiate with Elder Mu when he heard this voice. He immediately went into the corridor. When he saw a young man walking from the distance, he was slightly puzzled. But when he recalled that image in his mind, he could confirm that this man was Master Lin. This was his target.</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan reached the hospital, he couldn\u2019t help but heave a sigh of relief.<em>I\u2019ve finally f*cking made it.</em></p><br/><p><em>This life shouldn\u2019t go yet. God, please do me this favor.</em></p><br/><p>As Lin Fan was about to enter the ward, Chen Xiang Bei quickly opened his mouth. \u201cMaster Lin, I\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>But this sentence wasn\u2019t completed. Lin Fan just passed by him, completely ignoring him as he rushed into the ward to Zhao Ming Qing\u2019s side.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing, who had been asleep the whole time, seemed to have sensed that his teacher was here. He slowly opened his eyes. When he saw that face by his bed, he let out a smile as he spoke weakly.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-6\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cTeacher\u2026you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. \u201cMmm, I\u2019m here. Can you hold on for a while more?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing smiled back and, as if using all his strength, he answered, \u201cI can\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>But this was just Zhao Ming Qing\u2019s will. With his body in this state, he might not be able to.</p><br/><p>Zhao Shi said eagerly, \u201cMaster Lin, he\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved his hand. With a face full of confidence, he gestured for Zhao Shi not to speak. \u201cMing Qing, this time, you cannot leave yet. Since you\u2019ve been able to endure until I came, what does that mean? That means that our destiny as teacher and disciple isn\u2019t over yet, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Zhao Ming Qing couldn\u2019t say too much. Every word took all of his strength to utter.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, please come with me.\u201d Chen Xiang Bei came to Lin Fan\u2019s side and placed a hand on his shoulder.</p><br/><p>But in the blink of an eye, Chen Xiang Bei suddenly felt like his body was in mid-air. Then, he flew into the corridor outside.</p><br/><p>*Crash!*</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-7\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>He slammed into the corridor wall with a look of disbelief on his face.</p><br/><p>He had no idea what had happened. <em>Why did I suddenly fly out here?</em></p></div>\n</div>"}

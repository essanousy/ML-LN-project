It\u2019s as if you guys love me so much for saving the world once again.\u201d</p><br/><p>The crowd laughed. Someone from the audience shouted, \u201cMaster Lin! You did it too beautifully! Awesome!\u201d</p><br/><p>Almost immediately after, another person from the audience shouted, \u201cYou have to expose the dirty dealings!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, so that\u2019s what you guys are clapping about.\u201d Lin Fan laughed. Thereafter, he waved his hand, \u201cThese so-called dirty dealings are exactly what I can\u2019t stand the most. Don\u2019t you guys think so? Someone who has practiced so hard and so seriously, with the potential to get a better placing, was dropped out of the competition all because of some dirty dealings. This would have cast a huge shadow of doubt in his heart. Therefore, when we are met with such a situation, we have to deal with it sternly, to let them know those dirty dealings should not exist!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell said!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI admire no one else but Master Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOn a normal basis, Ying Jin seemed to be very honorable. Who knew she would have the ability to pull such underhanded means.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe have to boycott her.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Listening to the noise, Lin Fan felt that he stood on the side of justice. After which, he looked directly at Liu Ying Dong who was sitting at the judge\u2019s panel.</p><br/><p>Ever since the Ying Jin issue happened, all he did was sit there, depressed. When his gaze met Lin Fan\u2019s, he seemed to avoid it and tried to hide away.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was very happy. This fellow must have thoroughly experienced his awesomeness.</p><br/><p>Looking at Liu Ying Dong\u2019s appearance, he definitely has some dirty dealings as well.</p><br/><p>Perhaps he was afraid that his own dirty dealings would be exposed as well.</p><br/><p>Liu Ying Dong was going frantic. He never expected that the situation would escalate to such a level. His fellow was actually able to cause Ying Jin to have her reputation swept away. Even though at this moment, he still hasn\u2019t done it, but from what he can see, it wasn\u2019t too far away.</p><br/><p>It was only a small matter. No one thought it would develop to such an extent.</p><br/><p>He had heard that the brand which Sister Ying was representing wanted her to pay a penalty. This was a big deal.</p><br/><p>After all, there were certain requirements stated in the endorsement contract.</p><br/><p>One of the requirements stated was not to do anything that would harm the image of the company, which would result in negative effects.</p><br/><p>He had already seen the news online. The netizens had a strong reaction to this matter. Some of the companies started to take down the logos of the spokesperson in order to cut losses.</p><br/><p>Liu Ying Dong felt that he couldn\u2019t mess around. He really couldn\u2019t mess around.</p><br/><p>Looking around at the judges\u2019 panel, Zhao Li wasn\u2019t here as well. He didn\u2019t know what happened to her.</p><br/><p>Zhao Li was also called out in this matter involving the dirty dealings. However, the reporters only wanted to catch Ying Jin because her reputation was higher. Moreover, Zhao Li also didn\u2019t reveal anything in front of the reporters. So there wasn\u2019t much news from her.</p><br/><p>However, everyone knew that it wasn\u2019t only Ying Jin that was involved in the dirty dealings, but Zhao Li as well.</p><br/><p>Huo Jian Xiang lightly tapped Lin Fan. It was unfathomable and unbelievable.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, you are indeed awesome. It\u2019s virtually impossible for her to get on good public relations this time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed, \u201cWhat public relations? The evidence has already been exposed. There\u2019s no way she\u2019ll be able to clear her name.\u201d</p><br/><p>Huo Jian Xiang said with good intentions, \u201cMaster Lin, from an objective point of view, I feel that what you\u2019ve done is enough. After all, if you want to stay in this circle, you can\u2019t offend too many people.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied calmly, \u201cI don\u2019t quite understand what you\u2019re saying. I didn\u2019t do anything. It\u2019s the netizens who don\u2019t wish to forgive her. I can\u2019t do anything. As for this circle, I don\u2019t have the intentions to stay for long.\u201d</p><br/><p>Huo Jian Xiang didn\u2019t say anything else. He only casually said those words, and it wasn\u2019t as if he sided with Ying Jin. He said those words through his many years of experience and wanted to express his thoughts on the effect of this event.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan understood him, but it didn\u2019t matter. He was originally just selling scallion pancakes.</p><br/><p>As for the mentor job, it was already his Nth number of job.</p><br/><p>In the broadcasting room.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, that\u2019s strange. Why isn\u2019t Zhao Li here yet?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSomething has already happened to her. Would she still have the face to come here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf she dares to come, I can guarantee you that Master Lin would hate her to death.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019d support Master Lin doing hat. She isn\u2019t a very good person, and is often very arrogant.\u201d</p><br/><p>At the backstage.</p><br/><p>The deputy stage director was getting nervous, \u201cZhao Li isn\u2019t here yet?\u201d</p><br/><p>One of the workers said, \u201cI\u2019ve just contacted her. She\u2019s on her way here. However, deputy stage manager, would there really be no problem with her here?\u201d</p><br/><p>The deputy stage manager had a face of helplessness, \u201cWhat else can we do? Unless we cancel this show.\u201d</p><br/><p>Not before long.</p><br/><p>Zhao Li appeared at the venue for the Strongest Heavenly Voice.</p><br/><p>When the audience saw Zhao Li, they immediately started jeering.</p><br/><p>Zhao Li maintained an ordinary expression, however, she was feeling uncomparably awkward. She didn\u2019t know what to say.</p><br/><p>She heard the comments from the audience.</p><br/><p>*scoffs*</p><br/><p>\u201cShe actually has the face to show up here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSomeone that meddles with dirty dealings actually dares to turn up. Her skin must be really thick.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet her leave! We don\u2019t wish to see a mentor that has meddles with dirty dealings!\u201d</p><br/><p>Listening to these words, she gradually became more gloomy. However, she thought of something.</p><br/><p>You guys don\u2019t wish to see me? However, I have to make an appearance on this show and put up a normal act. I\u2019ll let you all know that I just won\u2019t leave even though you guys want me to, just so I can piss all of you off.</p><br/><p>When she thought of this, she smiled and raised her hand. She acted as if nothing had happened, \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, there was a bit of delay on the roads which caused me to be late.\u201d</p><br/><p>The audience fumed momentarily when they heard this.</p><br/><p>Zhao Li didn\u2019t have a single bit of self-awareness.</p><br/><p>Despicable. Extremely despicable!</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at Zhao Li and smiled. He had played this matter regarding the dirty dealings very well. His main target was Ying Jin. As for Zhao Li, she was an extra.</p><br/><p>However, looking at the appearance of Zhao Li, he was afraid that it wouldn\u2019t be easy for her.</p><br/><p>Zhao Li\u2019s blood started to boil the moment she saw Lin Fan. However, no matter how angry she was, she couldn\u2019t show it.</p><br/><p>Everything that has happened till date has all happened because of that b*stard.</p><br/><p>If it weren\u2019t for him, none of this would have happened.</p><br/><p>When she thought about the group of reporters awaiting her, she felt scared.</p><br/><p>She was in denial about losing her reputation. Ever since Sister Ying held that reporters conference, the matter didn\u2019t end there, but instead, it became even more intense. So much so that she could just collapse.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher Zhao, why does your expression look so bad? Could it be because of the dirty dealings that caused you to look so sick?\u201d Lin Fan asked her bluntly through the microphone.</p><br/><p>Zhao Li didn\u2019t expect that this b*stard would ask such a blunt question. He even used the f*cking microphone.</p><br/><p>Is he afraid that no one can hear him?</p><br/><p>However at this moment, she laughed awkwardly, \u201cThank you for your concern Master Lin, but I\u2019m doing well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Lin Fan profoundly said. \u201cDirty and healthy.\u201d</p><br/><p>In the broadcasting room.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, I\u2019m laughing my *ss off. Master Lin isn\u2019t giving her any face at all.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is the way to do it! Zhao Li isn\u2019t that good a person.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet me ask you, are you sick?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy do I feel that there is something not quite right about this \u201cDirty and healthy\u201d?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI feel the same way.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p></div>\n</div>"}

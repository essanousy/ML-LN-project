He drank and feasted. He probably wouldn\u2019t be able to drive home later.</p><br/><p>Chen Chang Sheng was really happy. He raised his glass, \u201cMaster Lin, I\u2019ll give you a toast. Let me introduce you to a friend of mine.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, Chen Chang Sheng pointed to a middle-aged man beside him, \u201cThis is my secondary school classmate. He is currently working in the food and beverages industry in Zhongzhou. This time, he came to Shanghai to visit me and I arranged for us to meet up together.\u201d</p><br/><p>The man stood up and smiled, \u201cHi, Master Lin, I am Xu Fei Yuan. I have heard of Master Lin\u2019s name. This time, it\u2019s my honor to meet all of you here, including Master Lin. I am finishing this glass of wine as a form of respect.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, so you\u2019re from the same village,\u201d Lin Fan smiled and said.</p><br/><p>Xu Fei Yuan had been doing really well in Zhongzhou. This time, he came to Shanghai to catch up with his classmate and perhaps boost his business. When he heard that a lot of wealthy men were gathering for a meal, he was really excited about it.</p><br/><p>Especially when he heard that one of them was Master Lin. He couldn\u2019t contain his excitement at all.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t really dare to speak at the table as he was afraid of offending people. He only started to speak when Chen Chang Sheng introduced him to everyone else. That was when he introduced himself to the others.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang and the others were friendly and they gave Chen Chang Sheng face. \u201cSince you\u2019re Chief Chen\u2019s friend, you\u2019re our friend now. You don\u2019t have to be too formal. We can talk about anything.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although Xu Fei Yuan was pretty well to do, he couldn\u2019t match up to the wealth of the people at the table.</p><br/><p>After hearing that, he became livelier. He started toasting everyone and tried to make friends with them.</p><br/><p>After three rounds of drinking.</p><br/><p>Everyone started to talk about other random things.</p><br/><p>Chen Chang Sheng\u2019s face was red. He patted Xu Fei Yuan\u2019s shoulder, \u201cI heard your restaurant just had two new dishes and they\u2019re really popular now. Is it being sold to the other cities?\u201d</p><br/><p>When Xu Fei Yuan heard that, he smiled, \u201cBrother Chen, these two dishes are really decent. They helped me to expand my market outreach. These dishes can be said to be my signature dishes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, if we\u2019re talking about cooking, we should mention that Master Lin is a superb cook. Those that have tried his food before will never be able to forget its taste,\u201d He Cheng Han said and laughed.</p><br/><p>He had eaten Lin Fan\u2019s food before and he had been craving for it ever since then.</p><br/><p>Xu Fei Yuan was a little drunk and he started to talk more, \u201cActually, these two dishes weren\u2019t mine initially. They belong to a small restaurant. There was once I returned home from working overseas and I was hungry. I found a random restaurant to have my meal in. That was when I found the treasure. These two dishes were really delicious. Then, I told them to cease operations and let me be the chef there. If not, they could sell the recipe to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGuess what happened next.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jin Yun Ming smiled, \u201cDid you fight with them over it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Those that discussed business deals would discuss things first. If they couldn\u2019t reach a common agreement, they would think of other ways to get what they wanted.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot really. I saw that they were hiring people. Hence, I sent my head chef down to work for them. You should know what the outcome was like by now,\u201d Xu Fei Yuan laughed.</p><br/><p>Every time he thought about it, he felt that he was really smart for doing that.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat was superb. He learned a new skill and that is irreplaceable,\u201d He Cheng Han laughed. He felt that this fella was pretty smart.</p><br/><p>Xu Fei Yuan waved his hands modestly, \u201cIt wasn\u2019t superb. That was just a corporate move. My head chef worked in their kitchen for a month and he watched everything that they did. He slowly managed to master the skills and patented the dishes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe small restaurant didn\u2019t patent the dishes?\u201d someone asked.</p><br/><p>Xu Fei Yuan smiled, \u201cWhy would those people know the importance of a patent? My restaurants now depend on these two dishes and they are gradually expanding to other markets. It also has different packages. We use vacuum packaging for deliveries and the income is pretty good.\u201d</p><br/><p>The others were envious of him. They didn\u2019t expect this fella to be so lucky. He actually made a fortune after eating a meal. Where would they be able to find such a good deal?</p><br/><p>Lin Fan interrupted, \u201cDoes that mean the small restaurant is out of business?\u201d</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t get used to such a behavior.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, He Cheng Han and the others were stunned. They knew that Master Lin loved to stand up for the weak. He didn\u2019t like to befriend those that did evil things.</p><br/><p>The things that they said earlier were just for bragging rights.</p><br/><p>However, Xu Fei Yuan didn\u2019t know that. He just wanted to show his determination in front of all of them.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat can\u2019t be helped. That\u2019s how businesses work. After I got the patent rights, I stopped them from selling these two dishes. If they wanted to sell them, they had to pay. Because of this, we went to court but I had all the evidence. Obviously, I won the case.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan furrowed his brows. He wondered why this person was so cunning.</p><br/><p>Chen Chang Sheng realized that Master Lin was a little unhappy and it was probably because of what he was saying. He immediately nudged his friend and asked him to stop talking about it.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, alright. Let\u2019s not talk about that. Let\u2019s talk about something else,\u201d Chen Chang Sheng tried to change the topic.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan knocked the table, \u201cChief Xu, what are the two dishes called?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Chang Sheng knew that something was wrong when he heard Master Lin asking about it. Then, he looked at Wang Ming Yang.</p><br/><p>However, Wang Ming Yang just shook his head. It was clear that he should stay out of this matter.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, He Cheng Han and the others didn\u2019t say anything else. They just looked at each other. They knew that Master Lin was probably unhappy because of what he said. They looked at Chen Chang Sheng and wondered why he asked someone like him over for dinner.</p><br/><p>They thought about it further.</p><br/><p>It was really pretty despicable.</p><br/><p>He had a big organization and he still bullied a small restaurant. It was shameful to even speak of it.</p><br/><p>Xu Fei Yuan smiled, \u201cOh, these two dishes are called, \u2018Mirror Box Tofu\u2019 and \u2018Cherry Pork\u2019. They\u2019re really delicious. Next time, I\u2019ll let everyone try them.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan heard that, his face changed.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang was observing his best friend\u2019s expressions. When he saw his face changed, he knew that something was wrong.</p><br/><p>Sh*t was about to go down.</p><br/><p>This time, Lin Fan took out his phone and called someone.</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone, please keep quiet. I\u2019m making a call,\u201d Lin Fan said to everyone.</p><br/><p>Then, there was silence in the private room.</p><br/><p>Soon, the person picked up.</p><br/><p>\u201cKe, how\u2019s life?\u201d Lin Fan asked calmly.</p><br/><p>The person on the phone remained silent for a moment. Then, he smiled, \u201cI\u2019m doing pretty well. How\u2019s life in Shanghai recently? I read the news about you heading to the northeast. Are you okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. I\u2019m back in Shanghai now. How\u2019s business recently?\u201d Lin Fan asked.</p><br/><p>Bai Ke hesitated for a moment, \u201cIt\u2019s pretty good. Business is good. Don\u2019t worry. Tell me when you\u2019re in Zhongzhou next time. I will welcome you warmly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Ke was really depressed and lifeless. However, since his classmate called him, he had to sound energetic.</p><br/><p>However, he felt like he let him down.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll hang up now. I have something to handle here,\u201d said Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><br/><p>After hanging up.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled and stood up. \u201cJust as everyone\u2019s here today, I\u2019ll cook two dishes for everyone to try. How\u2019s that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang smiled and nodded, \u201cSure.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p></div>\n</div>"}

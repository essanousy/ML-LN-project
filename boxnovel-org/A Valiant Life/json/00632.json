This guy is law-defying. He is literally trying to sever all ties with Godfather Ma.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to ask about what just happened. Those bodyguards aren\u2019t imposters. The leader of the team was once the champion of a martial arts competition. He could break tiles with just one palm. He was defeated so easily.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHorrifying, it\u2019s simply too horrifying. I didn\u2019t even see how he did it. It was too fast.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExtraordinary. I\u2019ve never seen anything like that before.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis godly doctor has a strong backing indeed. It\u2019s not anyone but him. Godfather Ma might be doomed this time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, what can he do besides fight? Who is Godfather Ma? Can this fella do anything to him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true. If something happens to Godfather Ma, there would be nowhere this fella can hide.\u201d</p><br/><p>The crowd was discussing among themselves. Some of the passers-by were stunned when they found out that a person was trying to go against Godfather Ma.</p><br/><p>They had never seen anyone like him before. Wasn\u2019t he trying to get himself killed?</p><br/><p>In the room!</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled and looked at Ma Qing Zhou. \u201cGodfather Ma, how was that? Do you have any thoughts about that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ma Qing Zhou started to take Lin Fan more seriously. That strike was simply too fast. How could anyone like him exist in this world?</p><br/><p>It was impossible. Nobody like him could have existed.</p><br/><p>Ma Qing Zhou remained silent. He looked at Lin Fan in shock. It was as if he was trying to see through Lin Fan. However, he couldn\u2019t tell what was wrong with him.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cGodfather Ma, what happened? Are you speechless now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Ren stood aside. He didn\u2019t expect things to turn out this way. The situation was getting out of hand. The godly doctor was indeed powerful. There were only Godfather Ma and him left in the room. They were certainly not powerful enough to go against him.</p><br/><p>\u201cGodly doctor, please don\u2019t be agitated. We can discuss about it. If you have any requests, just tell us. We will satisfy you,\u201d Liu Ren persuaded. He could only try to appease the godly doctor. If not, nobody could predict what was going to happen.</p><br/><p>Ma Qing Zhou took a deep breath and looked at Lin Fan sternly, \u201cI don\u2019t believe you can do anything to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha!\u201d Lin Fan smiled. \u201cDidn\u2019t I just tell you that there will be something more awesome later? You shall feel it now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, Lin Fan stretched out his hand and went towards Ma Qing Zhou.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t move.\u201d Suddenly, Ma Qing Zhou took out a pistol from his back pocket. \u201cMove another step and I will kill you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ma Qing Zhou was the tyrant of Qingzhou. He definitely carried a weapon with him everywhere he went. It was common to carry firearms in the country. However, people usually carried air pistols and rifles for hunting purposes only.</p><br/><p>When the pistol was out, Liu Ren heaved a sigh of relief. He felt that the situation was finally under control.</p><br/><p>Even if this fella was swift, he couldn\u2019t possibly dodge a bullet.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you believe I can kill you with one shot?\u201d Ma Qing Zhou stared at Lin Fan. \u201cYou initially could be good friends with me but you didn\u2019t cherish the opportunity. Now, kneel down before me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKneel down!\u201d</p><br/><p>To Ma Qing Zhou, he felt like he could conquer the world with the gun in his hand.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cYou just committed another crime for possessing a firearm. You are hopeless.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha!\u201d Ma Qing Zhou started laughing. He looked at Lin Fan like an idiot, \u201cI\u2019ll give you one last chance. Kneel down now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shook his head, \u201cI think you still don\u2019t know what the situation is like now. Do you think you can do anything to me with this gun?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>Ma Qing Zhou immediately fired to the ground. Smoke emerged from the small opening of the pistol. \u201cI won\u2019t say it again. If you don\u2019t kneel down now, you\u2019ll be lying down later. I won\u2019t be in any trouble for killing in Qingzhou. You\u2019ll be dead by then.\u201d</p><br/><p>The crowd outside went wild.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere was a gunshot! It came from inside.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is happening? Who fired it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you talking rubbish? It was definitely Godfather Ma. Who else could\u2019ve possessed a gun inside?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSomeone take a look. See if the man is dead.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you were to sneak a peek, you\u2019ll be the next one to die.\u201d</p><br/><p>Many of them were big shots of Qingzhou. They behaved proudly and arrogantly in front of the average citizens. However, they behaved like kids in front of Godfather Ma.</p><br/><p>If they were to sneakily look at the situation inside, they\u2019d probably die without knowing why. Furthermore, nobody would\u2019ve dared to spread any rumors about what had happened tonight.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>In the room!</p><br/><p>Godfather Ma thought that he had Lin Fan under control and he smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201cKneel down and treat my illness. I will let you live. I will also give you $10 million as a reward. Remember, you have to know who you are dealing with. If not, you\u2019ll die a horrible death,\u201d Godfather Ma sneered.</p><br/><p>If not for the major wuxia classification knowledge, he would\u2019ve been frightened by the gun. However, he had a hundred methods to kill Godfather Ma.</p><br/><p>However, he didn\u2019t like to kill.</p><br/><p>He had to do it lawfully.</p><br/><p>Then, he opened his palm. \u201cDo you believe that I can slap the bullet away with one hand?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKneel down!\u201d Godfather Ma shouted.</p><br/><p>Liu Ren thought that the godly doctor was insane. How could anyone slap bullets away with his/her hands? Was he dreaming?</p><br/><p>Godfather Ma looked at him as he continued to walk towards him.</p><br/><p>\u201cStand right there! I said, stand there!\u201d Godfather Ma shouted.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan continued walking and shook his head helplessly, \u201cSigh, forget it. I\u2019ll show you what is fun.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou must be asking for it. Do you think I don\u2019t dare to fire a bullet at you? Kneel down now.\u201d Godfather Ma definitely wouldn\u2019t let Lin Fan die. After all, if he really died, who was going to treat his illness?</p><br/><p>Then, he aimed the gun at Lin Fan\u2019s knees and was prepared to shoot him till he kneeled down.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>There was a gunshot.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was a little unhappy. He raised his right leg and kicked the bullet that was incoming.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>There was a metallic sound and a blinding light emerged from Lin Fan\u2019s right leg. The bullet was useless upon contacting his leg. Lin Fan immediately kicked it away.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow could that be?\u201d Ma Qing Zhou and Liu Ren looked at him in shock.</p><br/><p>He just kicked a bullet with his leg\u2026</p><br/><p>Lin Fan pointed at his brain. \u201cGodfather Ma, I\u2019ll give you one more chance. Shoot here. If you can kill me, I\u2019ll call you a pro.\u201d</p><br/><p>Godfather Ma\u2019s voice started to tremble. \u201cAre you a human or a ghost?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you a human or a ghost?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>Godfather Ma started to become emotional and he pulled the trigger again.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan casually raised his hand and swiped in the air. The bullet didn\u2019t even penetrate his body, it immediately flew away.</p><br/><p>Everyone was dumbfounded!</p><br/><p>Liu Ren and Godfather Ma were shocked. Even the hand that was holding the gun started to tremble.</p><br/><p>Was this man a human?</p></div>\n</div>"}

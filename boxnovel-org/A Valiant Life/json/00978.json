Master Lin was going to take over as the association Chairman. What advantages would that bring him?</p><br/><p>He had to think this through.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat else could it be? Someone wants to join the association and he needs someone to recommend him. I just recommended someone else recently so it wouldn\u2019t be good for me to do it this time.</p><br/><p>Elder Li asked, \u201cWho is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Zhong Fei smiled. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, it\u2019s a generous person. He knows what to do. Just come with me tonight.\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-2\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Elder Li nodded. \u201cAlright, as long as he knows what to do. The association isn\u2019t the same as before now. After Master Lin takes up the appointment, the association\u2019s standing is going to rise up. Joining the association won\u2019t be so easy anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow could I not know that? When they announced it just now, I knew that things were going to be crazy with the association. It\u2019s time for it to soar.\u201d Wang Zhong Fei was feeling great.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan becoming the association Chairman would only bring them benefits. It was as if the association had stumbled upon a piece of gold that would raise its standing in the medical world.</p><br/><p>Just thinking about Master Lin\u2019s achievements was scary. Were these things that other people could achieve?</p><br/><p>Obviously not.</p><br/><p>The next day!</p><br/><p>The news on the Internet.</p><br/><p>After the conference at the Chinese Medical Association had ended that day, they had made a public statement on their official website. This matter had drawn the attention of reporters and they were reporting it without any restraint.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-3\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was thinking hard about some things. He felt that there had to be change. Although this method of change was rather harsh and blunt, didn\u2019t all reforms cause huge repercussions? In the end, he would have to withstand the pressure and resolve the situation with swift and decisive action.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing called. \u201cTeacher, I was pondering the whole of last night. Regarding what you said, I feel that implementing it might really cause problems.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cMing Qing, don\u2019t be afraid of problems. We can\u2019t let fear stop us from taking action. If we\u2019re going to do this, we have to go all the way. Slow change? That\u2019s all fake. The new grass grows even before the old roots have decomposed. Right now, we don\u2019t know how many people in the association are corrupted. Slowly figuring it out won\u2019t work. We have to handle this decisively.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what about the various associations from other cities and provinces?\u201d asked Zhao Ming Qing.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cI\u2019ve already thought this through. Everyone will go through the evaluation again. With Shanghai\u2019s headquarters as the foundation, we will recruit people based on evaluation once again.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing was a little nervous because his teacher\u2019s plan was too brutal and things could easily go out of hand. If they didn\u2019t handle it well, it would easily draw backlash. If that were to happen, they wouldn\u2019t be able to take back what they\u2019ve done.</p><br/><p>But as the student, he would do whatever his teacher wished. Even if his teacher jumped into a pit, he would jump in as well.</p><br/><p>After hanging up.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan opened Weibo and posted some personal thoughts.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-4\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m honored to take on the appointment of Chairman of the Chinese Medical Association. I will do everything in my ability to carry forward the association.\u201d</p><br/><p>Just a short post had expressed Lin Fan\u2019s conviction.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, you\u2019re the Chairman now. Why don\u2019t you celebrate it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah! I\u2019ve been following you every step of the way since you only had tens of followers. Now, you have tens of millions! I\u2019m a hardcore fan!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCongratulations, Master Lin. This is another step forward.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf Master Lin becomes the Chinese Medical Association Chairman, the Chinese Medical Association might start improving.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that obvious? With Master Lin\u2019s capabilities, how could he not be able to support the Chinese Medical Association?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. I support Master Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the comments for a while. He would let everyone relax for today. Tomorrow, he was going to talk about serious business.</p><br/><p>This time, he had decided that he would take on the role of the bad guy. He had the energy and he had nothing much to do every day anyway. Hence, he was going to play around with them a little.</p><br/><p>But before that, he had to prepare some information.</p><br/><p>The evaluation definitely had to involve a exam. Without an exam, how could they decided if someone could pass?</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-5\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>As for the exam script, of course he would be the one to write it.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>In a certain mansion.</p><br/><p>\u201cZhou Qing Quan\u2019s decision this time was really right. Master Lin becoming the Chairman will bring great benefits to the association and to us,\u201d said an old-timer with a smile. He was a master with a long history in the Chinese Medical Association.</p><br/><p>Zhang Guo Shou was probably a name known by everyone in the Chinese Medical Association.</p><br/><p>He had once been the Vice-Chairman and there were many of the association members that were his students.</p><br/><p>Although he had already retired now, he still had a great influence on the association. If he were to say something, even Zhou Qing Quan would have to consider it.</p><br/><p>\u201cDad, the Chinese Medical Association has been very well-received lately. The Chinese medicinal ingredient market is already becoming lively. Now that Master Lin had become the Chairman, it would definitely double the effect.\u201d A square-faced middle-aged man said excitedly.</p><br/><p>\u201cMmm. Take advantage of the current market price for Chinese medicinal ingredients. Right now, the Chinese Medical Association is like a sleeping lion that will soon be awakened.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDad, do you really have that much faith in this Master Lin?\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-6\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Zhang Guo Shou smiled. \u201cOf course I do. If not, how would we earn money?\u201d</p><br/><p>The next day!</p><br/><p>Everyone was in deep sleep.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan woke up early and looked at the time. It was only 7 AM. He was still a little drowsy but he had things to do. Then, he clumsily took out his phone and started typing.</p><br/><p>\u201cOn the second day of my appointment as Chairman of the Chinese Medical Association, I want to make a small public notice: There are crooks mixed in with the honest folk in the Chinese Medical Association. Some of them got in through backdoor means and some got in using bribes. I am very unhappy about these. Hence, I\u2019m going to freeze all membership and have all members undergo an evaluation once again. If they pass the evaluation, they will remain as association members. If not, they will be kicked from the association. I\u2019d like to reiterate that not matter what your appointment is, what your identity is, or what your credentials are, everyone will be evaluated once again. The time of evaluation has yet to be confirmed. After this notice is sent out, it will start taking effect. To all who are collaborating with people involved in the Chinese Medical Association, please take note\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>After sending this message, Lin Fan threw his phone to the side and continued to sleep.</p><br/><p><em>I\u2019m throwing a dynamite early in the morning for you guys to enjoy first.</em></p><br/><p>After sending the message, he stopped caring about it. He had no idea huge waves had been created in the world outside because of this message of his.</p><br/><p>When the Vice-Chairman, Wang Tian Feng saw this, he immediately updated the official website with this information.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Lin Fan\u2019s Weibo had many followers and there were many reporters as well.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-7\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>When this Weibo post was sent, they immediately reposted it.</p><br/><p>Wang Zhong Fei, who had taken a bribe from someone else the previous night, was cuddling with a lady as he slept. But suddenly, his phone started ringing furiously.</p><br/><p>His soul almost got shocked out of his body.</p></div>\n</div>"}

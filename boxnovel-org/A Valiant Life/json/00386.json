At around 8 in the morning, a large number of townsfolk would be waiting outside the shop. The scallion pancakes were becoming more and more well known but not many people were able to eat them. Ten servings a day. When compared to the townsfolk's wants, the demand far exceeded the supply. Thus, the market price rose extremely high. There were many resellers amongst the people who queued. They all knew that Master Lin's scallion pancakes could be sold for a heavenly price.</p><br/><p>It was the effect of a top-rate delicacy.</p><br/><p>However, this reputation was only spread within this small region in Shanghai. Some other townsfolk from other districts had heard of its name and come to try it too. However, when they came, they realized that this scallion pancake was too difficult to get. With only ten servings a day and so many people queuing up, buying just one serving was simply too hard.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan had nothing to do in the shop at the moment. He waved his hand and said, \"You guys stay in the shop. I'm going to the Welfare Institute first.\"</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan asked, \"Do you want us to go with you?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved her off. There was no need. He was going to the Children's Welfare Institute because he had something to do. The certificate for practicing medicine had already arrived, so he was going to the Children's Welfare Institute now to give the children check-ups. Lin Fan wanted these days to be a little more fulfilling. Those children were all unwanted. To them, although they were still young, they felt very different from other children and they mainly felt inferior.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan wanted to defy nature and change lives. Since no one wanted those children, he would raise them up to be talents. When that happens, even if those parents want their children back, it wouldn't be so easy.</p><br/><p>To Lin Fan, this was simply killing two birds with one stone. Not only could he gain Encyclopedic points, he could also bring joy to his soul. Just thinking about it made him excited.</p><br/><p>Recently, when he went home at night, Lin Fan would be making a handwritten copy of the writing. It was a monumental piece of work. Although the total number of words was not high, the case examples inside were classics. At the same time, according to his own knowledge, he would correct some of the parts that were inappropriate in order make it perfect.</p><br/><p>But writing a book was simply too tiring. He would fall asleep while writing halfway. After the previous night's hard work, he had written a thousand words. This speed was actually quite fast.</p><br/><p>Nanshan Children's Welfare Institute.</p><br/><p>Director Huang was waiting for Lin Fan at the entrance. She knew that Nanshan Children's Welfare Institute now belonged to Master Lin. Director Huang didn't worry one bit regarding this infinitely resourceful youngster. She could tell that this youngster was very kind-hearted. He took over the Children's Welfare Institute, not for his own gain but purely for the children.</p><br/><p>\"Director Huang\u2026\" Lin Fan came over to meet with Director Huang after parking his car.</p><br/><p>Director Huang smiled and said, \"Master Lin, let's go in. The children are all waiting. Even though you've come a few times, it seems you haven't met with the children yet.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded with a smile. That was true. Although he had come several times, most of the time, he had been in the kitchen and he barely saw the children.</p><br/><p>\"Director Huang, how many children are there here now?\" asked Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Director Huang replied, \"Previously, a number of children were found by their parents and taken home. As of now, we are left with 365. These children all either have physical issues or they've been found by their parents but their parents have refused to take ownership of them. We are still in the process of persuading the parents but for now, we haven't found a solution.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded, \"Since it's like that, then don't persuade them. If they bring these children back, they might not be good to the children. Let the children stay then. Over here, at least we are able to take good care of them. What does the institute still lack?\"</p><br/><p>Director Huang said, \"Right now, we aren't short of clothes, food or accommodations but what worries me the most is the children's education. Some of the children are already five or six and should be receiving primary education. Initially, I wanted to send the children to nearby primary schools but this is Shanghai and every single school is already full. I can't get them places at all. Also, some of the children, because of physical disabilities, are afraid of being laughed at if they go to school.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded, \"We can't let them fall behind in terms of education. Leave this matter to me. I'll make arrangements for all these in the near future. First, let's take a look at the children.\"</p><br/><p>But when they reached the rooms inside...</p><br/><p>A group of children was sitting there, some of them in wheelchairs. They were playing around in twos and threes, holding the toys that they had previously received. They were playing very happily.</p><br/><p>When Director Huang saw these children, she instantly beamed. She said, \"Children, look who's here!\"</p><br/><p>The children quietened down and looked to the front. They cried out with pleasant surprise, \"Uncle Lin\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan had an astonished look on his face as he thought to himself, \"Oh d*mn, these children actually recognize me.\" Then, he looked at Director Huang with a puzzled expression, \"They recognize me?\"</p><br/><p>His tone was one of disbelief. After all, he had interacted with the children very little. Every time he came, he had been in the kitchen. Could it be that Director Huang and the rest had told them about him?</p><br/><p>Director Huang smiled as she shook her head. She didn't give an explanation.</p><br/><p>In the front row sat a little fatty on a wheelchair. He had mucus flowing from his nostrils and his face was slightly red. It seemed that the children here had quite a lot of food. \"Uncle Lin, thank you for the fun toys you gave us. We all know about it.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan touched his own face. He never thought that a 'behind-the-scenes character' like him would be known by these little kids. It was a little mysterious.</p><br/><p>Director Huang said, \"These children are all very happy here. Their moods have all changed from when they just came. But those human traffickers are really inhumane. They had caused irreparable harm to the children's bodies.\"</p><br/><p>Director Huang's words reminded Lin Fan of what he was here to do.</p><br/><p>\"Director Huang, could you please get me a book and a pen? I need to use them,\" said Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Director Huang didn't know what Lin Fan needed those for but she went to get them.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan came to the little fatty's face and touched his head. \"Kid, you're very lively. What's your name?\"</p><br/><p>The little fatty's nose twitched as he sucked in his mucus. Then, he said very innocently, \"I'm Lil' Fatty.\"</p><br/><p>\"Not a bad name. In future, you all have to call me Teacher, not Uncle. Teacher hasn't even gotten married. I'm very young. If you call me that, I sound like an old man,\" said Lin Fan with a chuckle.</p><br/><p>Lil' Fatty's legs couldn't move but he raised his head and said, \"Teacher.\"</p><br/><p>The children behind called out cheerily as well.</p><br/><p>\"Teacher\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. For a f*cking awesome man like him, if he set his mind on something, he had to do it perfectly. Although Nanshan Children's Welfare Institute was unnoticed by anyone, he believed that there would be a day when everyone would know it. He would make let everyone know that this was a place that produced talents and he you make all parents want to send their children here. Of course, this was just a mere thought for now. There was still a long way to go.</p><br/><p>Very soon, Director Huang returned. \"Master Lin, what are you going to do with this?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled and replied, \"Take a look.\"</p><br/><p>Then, he squatted down and felt Lil' Fatty's paralyzed legs. Fortunately, Lil' Fatty's legs were still there. If they weren't, it would have been impossible to recover them.</p><br/><p>Director Huang stood at the side with no idea of what Master Lin was doing. She just stood there silently.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

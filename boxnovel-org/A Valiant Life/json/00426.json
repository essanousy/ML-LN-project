He hadn\u2019t received any calls from Wu Yun Gang and obviously, it meant that it wasn\u2019t completely settled. However, the police officers told them that they could leave and that puzzled him.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey\u2019re letting us go and you still want to stay here?\u201d Lin Fan smiled. He was also wondering who were the ones who bailed them out.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang shook his head. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant. It looks like it wasn\u2019t not done by Wu Yun Gang.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll know when we go out.\u201d</p><br/><p>Outside.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked and smiled, \u201cI know who they are.\u201d Then, he went forward. \u201cMaster Tao, Master Moon Autumn, thank you for your help.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yue Qiu Ju Shi replied immediately, \u201cMaster Lin, you\u2019re in Beijing, why didn\u2019t you tell us? Especially when you\u2019ve been arrested here. You should\u2019ve given us a call. If Elder Tao didn\u2019t read the news, we wouldn\u2019t have found out about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved his hand. \u201cIt\u2019s a small matter, I didn\u2019t want to trouble you.\u201d</p><br/><p>The secretary of the Martial Arts Association went forward. \u201cMaster Lin, I am the secretary of Beijing\u2019s Martial Arts Association. Chief Cao sent me here to bail you out. If all is well, I\u2019ll make a move first.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan didn\u2019t know who this person was and he didn\u2019t know who Chief Cao was. However, they had come to help him and naturally, he smiled. \u201cThank you for your help. I will go to the association to thank him personally.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was a personal favor and Lin Fan couldn\u2019t just thank the secretary. He had to thank Chief Cao personally, especially since he was the Vice-President of Shanghai\u2019s Martial Arts Association.</p><br/><p>However, he hadn\u2019t expected the association to have so much power.</p><br/><p>The secretary nodded and drove off.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, we\u2019re from the Chinese Medical Association. We\u2019ll leave too since you\u2019re fine now,\u201d a member of the Chinese Medical Association said.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded. \u201cAlright, sorry for the trouble.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even people from the Chinese Medicine Association were there, it had obviously been done by Zhao Ming Qing. Zhao Ming Qing didn\u2019t have a problem sending people there to save Master Lin since he had a close relationship with the Chinese Medical Association.</p><br/><p>In the end, only Tao Shi Gang and Yue Qiu Ju Shi stood by Lin Fan. Wang Ming Yang said curiously, \u201cI didn\u2019t expect your network to be so extensive.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan just smiled but as he thought about it, he realized that he had an extensive network of friends. This matter had been resolved because of that.</p><br/><p>A person\u2019s strengths are limited and he had to know a lot of people from different professions.</p><br/><p>So that it would be easier for matters to be resolved.</p><br/><p>Of course, the network was built on a strong personal foundation. If one didn\u2019t have a strong personal foundation, nobody could help him or her.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan initially wanted to treat them to a meal but Yue Qiu Ju Shi\u2019s art exhibition was tomorrow and he had to go back to make preparations. Lin Fan naturally didn\u2019t stop them. He made an arrangement to meet up tomorrow night instead. At the same time, Yue Qiu Ju Shi revealed that his friends in the industry wanted to meet him as well.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan felt that he was doing even better in the arts industry now.</p><br/><p>It seemed a little amusing as he thought of it.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved his hands at Tao Shi Gang and Yue Qiu Ju Shi when they left. Then, he said, \u201cLet\u2019s go. Give Wu Yun Gang a call and ask him to save the trouble. We can meet up for dinner tonight.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang nodded. It had been a thrilling day.</p><br/><p>Then, a group of reporters came over.</p><br/><p>\u201cLooks like we can\u2019t leave so soon,\u201d Lin Fan said when he saw the group of reporters.</p><br/><p>The reporters charged forward excitedly when they saw Lin Fan. At the same time, they didn\u2019t think much of it even though Lin Fan and Wang Ming Yang had been released.</p><br/><p>They felt that it was another piece of breaking news.</p><br/><p>\u201cHi, Master Lin. May I know how you got out of there?\u201d A reporter actually had checked on Lin Fan\u2019s background and knew that he was Master Lin from Cloud Street and that he was an influential figure on Weibo.</p><br/><p>He had infuriated Ying Jin and Li Mu Ze before, along with other celebrities.</p><br/><p>This time, only three celebrities supported Jin Xuan Ming and the other celebrities just ignored it. There was obviously a problem.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled and pointed at his feet. \u201cObviously, I walked out of there.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha\u2026\u201d the reporters laughed. They felt that the question was a little stupid.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, may I know your views regarding Jin Xuan Ming?\u201d another reporter asked.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was a little stunned, then, he asked, \u201cMay I know who is this Jin Xuan Ming?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d The reporter was stunned by his question. He just hit someone that he doesn\u2019t know? Then, the reporter said helplessly, \u201cHe\u2019s the Korean celebrity that you hit at the airport.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh\u2026\u201d Lin Fan dragged his words. Then, he added, \u201cI have nothing much to say. I don\u2019t really care about it. Anyway, he\u2019s just a temporal celebrity. I have a lot of things to do, why would I bother about these things?\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporter was speechless, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang stood there helplessly. His friend was crazy. He didn\u2019t even care if his words would offend people.</p><br/><p>The reporter asked, \u201cMaster Lin, this matter has blown up on the Internet and a lot of netizens have been discussing it. May I know if you have anything to say to them?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan thought for a moment before replying, \u201cA movie\u2019s about to come out and it talks about the stories during the war against Japan. I feel that it is pretty good. May the netizens watch it. As for the fight, you don\u2019t have to read about it anymore. It\u2019s not worth reading at all. Alright, we have to leave. That\u2019s all for today. Sorry, please excuse us.\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporters didn\u2019t want to let Master Lin leave at all. They still had a lot of questions.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, last question. Jin Xuan Ming is a Korean celebrity that got famous in China. This incident will have a great impact on his career. According to his manager, they are planning to sue you to compensate for his losses. Do you have anything to say about that? After all, Jin Xuan Ming\u2019s profit margins are great and the estimated figures for his lack of appearance in China for one to two months would cost at least a hundred million dollars,\u201d a reporter asked.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan stopped and asked, \u201cDo you think I look like a rich man?\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporter looked at him and shook his head. \u201cNope.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. \u201cThat\u2019s right. I don\u2019t have any money at all. How am I supposed to pay him? As the saying goes, one can only offer his life when he is broke. I won\u2019t even give him a single cent. If he\u2019s capable enough, he can come and slash me.\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporter was speechless, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>They felt that Master Lin was a little shameless.</p><br/><p>The reporter asked again, \u201cMaster Lin, aren\u2019t you afraid of going to jail?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was about to leave but he turned and said, \u201cOn this piece of land, everywhere is the same to me. Alright, you\u2019ve asked everything you wanted. I still have something to attend to. I\u2019ll be making a move.\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporters looked at Master Lin who drove off and then they looked at each other. If Jin Xuan Ming were to find out about Master Lin\u2019s answers, he might really die from anger.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

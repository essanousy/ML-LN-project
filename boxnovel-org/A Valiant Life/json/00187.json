What the hell is that?\"</p><br/><p>\"Woof woof!\"</p><br/><p>\"Woof woof!\"</p><br/><p>The barking noises became more prominent. </p><br/><p>Elder Dog Nicholas stood at the door, barking out commands. \"Go...go...go!\" </p><br/><p>Husky leaped at the male driver and licked his face, tasting him. His saliva dripped all over.</p><br/><p>Elder Dog Nicholas looked in his direction. \"Bite him.\" </p><br/><p>Husky looked up, expressionless. He lunged forward and bit the male driver on his nose. The other dogs bit his shoulders and thighs. </p><br/><p>The male driver struggled and tried to fight off the dogs, pushing them aside. \"F*ck off, will you?\" </p><br/><p>Elder Dog Nicholas stood at the door as he observed the male driver standing up and running off. He immediately leaped and bit him on his crotch. </p><br/><p>\"Ah!\" </p><br/><p>The male driver screamed in agony. Elder Dog Nicholas used his super strength to bite the male driver and he was firmly latched on to his crotch region, dangling in mid-air. </p><br/><p>The fat lady and the black woman were stunned. \"Where are all these dogs coming from? They're f*cking insane.\" </p><br/><p>*Barking noises.* </p><br/><p>A group of dogs bared their teeth as they became more aggressive, charging at the two females. </p><br/><p>\"Ahhh!\" </p><br/><p>The black woman flailed her arms and was scared to death. All of the dogs have gone crazy. </p><br/><p>The large black dog barked loudly as it dashed forward aggressively, sinking its teeth into the black woman's buttocks. She screamed out in pain. </p><br/><p>\"Woof woof!\" </p><br/><p>The thunderous chorus of barks emanated from inside the building. An army of dogs started charging towards the two women. </p><br/><p>Monger and Tai Di wrapped themselves around the black woman's thighs, before sinking their teeth deep into her flesh, aggressively going at her. </p><br/><p>The fat lady was pinned down by a dozen dogs, as her helpless cries pierced the air. </p><br/><p>They were at a loss on what to do. It was a complete mystery how this situation came to be. The dogs just came out of nowhere. </p><br/><p>If it was only a few dogs, it wouldn't be a problem since they could just brush them off. But there were ten over dogs, and it was simply a terrifying sight and a horrible experience for whoever would fall victim to the dogs. </p><br/><p>At Cloud Street! </p><br/><p>The people were all waiting. </p><br/><p>Sister Hong's husband was getting anxious. He was taking too long. \"Master Lin, is there any use?\" </p><br/><p>Lin Fan checked the time. It had already been forty minutes. He didn't know what was going on. But at that moment, barking sounds emanated from the behind them. </p><br/><p>\"Woof woof!\" </p><br/><p>One of the shop owners exclaimed in surprise, \"That's my dog, Li Li! What's she doing here?\" </p><br/><p>The chihuahua ran over to Lin Fan, barking at him. </p><br/><p>The townsfolk couldn't understand what the chihuahua was trying to say. It seemed like Master Lin was the only one capable of understanding it. </p><br/><p>Sister Hong asked anxiously, \"What's going on? What's going on, Master Lin?\" </p><br/><p>Lin Fan grinned cheekily. \"It has been found. Let's go.\" </p><br/><p>The crowd erupted in a flurry of speculation. </p><br/><p>The townsfolk were all stunned. Could it be that it has really been found? </p><br/><p>The policemen who were standing by had their doubts, but they were sincerely hoping and wishing that it was really true. They immediately mobilized. \"Get in the car. We're going there now!\" </p><br/><p>Lin Fan picked up the chihuahua and carried him in his arms. </p><br/><p>\"Guys, we've found it. The dog that was sent to find the little girl has returned. We're headed towards the location to find the kidnapped girl now,\" Zhao Zhongyang broadcasted into his phone. </p><br/><p>Upon receiving the live update, a flurry of reactions ensued. </p><br/><p>\"This is just too cool! We must definitely report this on the news, Brother Yang.\" </p><br/><p>\"Yea! This is just too magical to even think something like that could happen.\" </p><br/><p>\"Brother Yang, hurry up and follow the rest of the crew. We must survey the location ourselves.\" </p><br/><p>\"These human traffickers are so despicable. They'll finally get their comeuppance. Let Master Lin teach them a good lesson.\" </p><br/><p>In the police car. </p><br/><p>\"Where are we headed to now?\" the police officer asked. </p><br/><p>\"Which direction?\" Lin Fan turned and asked the Chihuahua. </p><br/><p>The Chihuahua replied with a bark. </p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded his head as he pointed the way, \"Turn left at the junction ahead.\" </p><br/><p>The policeman who was driving was stunned and mystified, but at this time, he could only trust Master Lin's instructions although he thought it was bogus. </p><br/><p>\"Master Lin, can we really find her?\" Sister Hong asked anxiously. </p><br/><p>\"Trust me on this one, Sister Hong. You don't have to worry, we'll find her soon.\" Lin Fan consoled her. </p><br/><p>The sight of Lin Fan talking to the Chihuahua was almost unbelievable. After asking the Chihuahua for directions, the Chihuahua would reply, followed by Lin Fan directing the driver. </p><br/><p>A car followed on at the back. </p><br/><p>Zhao Zhongyang sat in the other police car, talking on his phone. \"I'm sitting in the other police car, and Master Lin is sitting in the car ahead of me. We're headed towards the location. I don't know how this is gonna turn out, but I'm hoping for a miracle to happen.\"</p><br/><p>\"Haha, it's time to witness a miracle happen before your very eyes.\" </p><br/><p>\"Once the dogs have gotten a scent of their trail, there is simply no escaping or hiding.\" </p><br/><p>\"If we can really find her, Elder Dog Nicholas will be famous.\" </p><br/><p>When I first saw Elder Dog Nicholas, I just knew he wasn't any ordinary dog. I have faith that he will succeed.\" </p><br/><p>\u2026 </p><br/><p>After twenty minutes of driving. </p><br/><p>\"Stop the car here,\" Lin Fan commanded as he pointed toward the old neighborhood in front of him. \"She's in this small neighborhood.\" </p><br/><p>Everyone got off from their cars.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan let the Chihuahua down onto the ground, and the Chihuahua immediately ran into the neighborhood. </p><br/><p>The others followed behind, reaching the bottom of a building. The building had many people standing around, and from their conversations and expressions, one could sense the general air of disbelief. </p><br/><p>\"Why are there so many dogs upstairs?\" </p><br/><p>\"I'm not too sure. This is too scary. No one dares to go upstairs. It's as if the dogs have gone crazy.\" </p><br/><p>\"That's right. The police are here.\" </p><br/><p>At this moment, Lin Fan and the rest could hear multiple barking noises coming from above. </p><br/><p>\"Master Lin, is it upstairs?\" the police officer asked. </p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded. \"Yes, it's here. We should hurry.\" </p><br/><p>Sister Hong felt a sudden rush of adrenaline. She didn't need anyone to hold her anymore as she rushed upstairs with all the strength that her two legs could muster. </p><br/><p>\"Do you hear that? The barking noises from upstairs is really loud. I'm afraid that Elder Dog Nicholas has already occupied this place. As for how things are gonna turn out, we'll have to wait and see,\" Zhao Zhongyang proclaimed into his phone. </p><br/><p>On the fourth floor.</p><br/><p>As they got closer, the barking noises got louder.</p><br/><p>As the team peered into the room from the doorway, the scene that unfolded before them confuddled them.</p><br/><p>\"This...\" the police officers started stammering. </p><br/><p>Zhao Zhongyang took his phone and recorded the scene in the room. </p><br/><p>The netizens were also stunned. </p><br/><p>\"What the f*ck! This place is a living hell!\" </p><br/><p>\"Oh man... I'm shocked...\" </p><br/><p>\"This is too much...\" </p><br/><p>\"Damn, Elder Dog Nicholas and the rest really didn't need any help in settling this. All the kidnappers are all mauled beyond recognition.\" </p><br/><p>\u2026 </p><br/><p>As Lin Fan surveyed the carnage in the room, he tried to process what had taken place. He never thought it would turn out like that.</p><br/><p>The male driver was at his last breath. He struggled and reached out his hands as he sensed that there were some people entering the room. </p><br/><p>\"Hh..help me...\" </p><br/><p>The husky sat next to the male driver, biting onto a doll. When he saw the male driver squirming, he raised his paw and placed it on his mouth, silencing him. </p><br/><p>Next to the male driver were two other figures. They were disfigured beyond recognition, with bloodstains all over and clothes torn and tattered. </p><br/><p>\"Save us... dogs...\" </p><br/><p>Tai Di lay on the shoulder of the black woman, enjoying every moment of her pain. </p><br/><p>The black woman didn't have any more energy. She couldn't take it any longer. </p><br/><p>...</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Jia Hui, let me bring you out for a walk. Okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Liu Jia Hui nodded. She didn\u2019t like the feeling of being in the ward. She felt that she wasn\u2019t going to live for much longer. She wanted to see the world more and breathe in some fresh air.</p><br/><p>\u201cAuntie, we\u2019ll follow you along,\u201d her friends said.</p><br/><p>Aunt Wang nodded. Liu Jia Hui smiled. To Aunt Wang, she didn\u2019t know how the outcome would be. However, it was her only hope and she didn\u2019t want to give up on it.</p><br/><p>Outside the hospital.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was giving his everything in order to complete the Encyclopedia\u2019s task. He knew that completing the task would create a huge impact but he wasn\u2019t bothered by it. If the impact was going to be huge, then let it be huge.</p><br/><p>He was very capable and he wasn\u2019t afraid of the consequences.</p><br/><p>\u201cGodly doctor.\u201d The city enforcement officer came with his elderly mother.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan raised his head and smiled. \u201cPlease queue up. It\u2019ll be your turn very quickly.\u201d Then, he lowered his head and helped to treat the patients. Zhao Ming Qing was observing the situation and Qiu Jie was recording what was happening.</p><br/><p>The day might have been passing extremely quickly to them but they were going to reap great rewards. They were learning from practical treatment. It was the fastest way to help them improve their medical skills.</p><br/><p>The city enforcement officer lowered his head, \u201cMom, is it cold?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, he said, \u201cMom, later on, when the godly doctor treats you, your legs will recover.\u201d</p><br/><p>He looked at the young chap that was treating the patients sternly. He suddenly thought of what had happened that day. He felt a little guilty. He thought of the modern doctors who claimed to be able to cure diseases even though they had no idea how to do it. In the end, they\u2019d be unable to treat any illnesses. He had encountered a lot of situations like this before. He was a low-ranking city enforcement officer and his salary wasn\u2019t high. He had almost emptied his life-savings to treat his mum\u2019s illness.</p><br/><p>Initially, he had already given up on it. However, he didn\u2019t expect to meet a godly doctor which made him decide to try again.</p><br/><p>Even if the godly doctor didn\u2019t accept his request the previous day, he would\u2019ve begged for forgiveness no matter what. However, he didn\u2019t expect the godly doctor to agree with a smile after just one look at him. That smile still remained in his memory.</p><br/><p>When he thought of his smile, he felt more comfortable.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you, godly doctor.\u201d The patient clearly felt better after being treated and the joy emanated from within.</p><br/><p>\u201cTake care of your medicine. Remember to take it regularly. Your illness isn\u2019t very serious but it\u2019s the kind that would be easily triggered. If you do not wish to suffer from a relapse, eat your medicine regularly,\u201d Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>\u201cNext.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The city enforcement officer looked at Lin Fan, \u201cGodly doctor, she is my mum.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the person sitting in the wheelchair and looked at the city enforcement officer. \u201cActually, I wasn\u2019t going to treat her at first. However, I saw that you are a filial child. You should know what to do in the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>The city enforcement officer was a little nervous after hearing his words. When he continued listening to him, he heaved a sigh of relief. Then, he nodded, \u201cGodly doctor, I understand. I will definitely change and improve.\u201d</p><br/><p>The city enforcement officer didn\u2019t have a good attitude like Liu Xiao Tian. He was a little violent.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan read his fortune and saw that there were good and bad sides to him. He was also really filial to his mum, which was the reason why Lin Fan agreed to his request. If it wasn\u2019t for that, he wouldn\u2019t have agreed to it.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing looked at her legs and said, \u201cTeacher, is this situation like those of the children in the welfare institute?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shook his head, \u201cIt\u2019s not the same. This was caused by old age. It is not as serious as those in the welfare institute.\u201d</p><br/><p>The townsfolk were discussing amongst themselves.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe godly doctor can heal someone like that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard to tell. She can\u2019t even walk. Do you think he can really cure her?\u201d</p><br/><p>Some townsfolk were broadcasting it live.</p><br/><p>They immediately posted the video.</p><br/><p>\u201cLook, the godly doctor is about to treat a handicapped person.\u201d</p><br/><p>In an instant, the people in the broadcasting room went crazy.</p><br/><p>\u201cReally? Where is this godly doctor?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJiangning Hospital. If any of you have an illness, come here quickly. If you miss this opportunity, there won\u2019t be another time.\u201d</p><br/><p>The matter attracted a lot of attention online.</p><br/><p>However, it wasn\u2019t a big piece of news and it didn\u2019t cause a huge impact.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at her for a moment and thought of the treatment plan. \u201cI am going to insert some needles. It might be a little painful but this is normal. Don\u2019t be too anxious.\u201d</p><br/><p>He wanted to tell the patients what he was going to do before he did it to prevent them from being nervous.</p><br/><p>The city enforcement officer said nervously, \u201cGodly doctor, can my mum\u2019s illness be cured?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded, \u201cOf course. Just stand aside and watch.\u201d</p><br/><p>The city enforcement officer nodded. He was extremely anxious. If his mum\u2019s legs were really curable, it would be a joyous occasion for him.</p><br/><p>At the same time, he felt extremely lucky to have met a godly doctor.</p><br/><p>\u201cBaizhong acupoint, Xiyan acupoint, Qianchengshan acupoint, these few acupoints can stimulate movement in the legs,\u201d Lin Fan said as he continued treating her. Zhao Ming Qing just nodded.</p><br/><p>Although he was an elderly Chinese medical doctor, to his mentor, he was like a baby that was learning how to crawl. His mentor\u2019s medical skills and treatment methods were extraordinary. If he hadn\u2019t seen it with his own eyes, he wouldn\u2019t have believed it.</p><br/><p>Especially when he didn\u2019t know most of the treatment methods that he was using.</p><br/><p>If he was the one that was treating the current patient, he wouldn\u2019t have been confident of executing the plan perfectly. However, he realized that the new treatment plan that his mentor was using was totally foreign to him.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe five viscera and six bowels of the human body are linked. If the lungs have a problem, you might not need to look at the lungs. If the legs have a problem, you might not need to look at the legs too. The human body is extremely well connected. If one area has a problem, it might be affected by another area,\u201d Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>Perhaps the surrounding townsfolk didn\u2019t understand anything but Zhao Ming Qing understood it.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing said, \u201cTeacher, I understand.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qiu Jie and Zhang Tong Tong tried to understand it and remembered his words.</p><br/><p>Even if they didn\u2019t understand, they wanted to remember it. When they have the right amount of knowledge, they would understand the meaning behind his words.</p><br/><p>Time passed quickly.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan put the needles down, \u201cThe treatment has been completed. Your mum can feel her legs now. She should be able to raise them gently. However, she can\u2019t walk yet. I will prescribe you with medicine. Just help to wash her legs with it every morning and night. At the same time, I will tell you an acupoint that you should massage. Help to massage it every morning and night too for a week. Then, she should be able to walk.\u201d</p><br/><p>The city enforcement officer was ecstatic when he heard that, \u201cGodly doctor, thank you so much.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved his hand, \u201cNo problem. Alright, next.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNobody left?\u201d Lin Fan raised his head in disbelief. Then, he realized that it was another lady who was sitting in a wheelchair. Then, the lady was discussing with the others behind her. She looked a little doubtful.</p><br/><p>Liu Jia Hui was a little puzzled. She didn\u2019t know why her mum brought her here.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you want to be treated, or not?\u201d Lin Fan asked.</p><br/><p>Aunt Wang immediately went forward, \u201cYes, yes\u2026\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

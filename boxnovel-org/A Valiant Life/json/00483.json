The way he looked at Lin Fan had also changed.</p><br/><p>How could this be?</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled in confidence, indicating to Chen Xiang to taste it. Lin Fan knew that did not even need to think about just taking one bite because he definitely would not even be able to put it down if he took ten bites.</p><br/><p>Everyone saw the change in Chen Xiang\u2019s expression and they felt very curious. They were wondering what was up with the smell. They took a sniff as well and felt that something wasn\u2019t right.</p><br/><p>It seemed like it had too amazing of a fragrance.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to lose for sure,\u201d Chen Xiang said. When his mouth moved it was like every single one of his taste buds had been seduced by the smell, it was a very indescribable feeling.</p><br/><p>He took a bite of the scallion pancake.</p><br/><p>Chen Xiang was initially planning to put down the scallion pancake immediately, however, at that moment, it was like his tongue grew out a pair of hands, strongly determined to not put the scallion pancake down.</p><br/><p>Boom!</p><br/><p>It was at this moment, Chen Xiang felt like his head had been blown wide open. A shining light was flowing in his mind, a taste that he had never experienced before was throbbing on the tip of his tongue.</p><br/><p>This feeling\u2026</p><br/><p>This\u2026</p><br/><p>It\u2019s shocking!</p><br/><p>Chen Xiang\u2019s eyes just stayed there in a daze, he felt that he had been transported to a whole different world.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>A very exaggerated noise burst out from Chen Xiang\u2019s mouth. At the same time, his facial expression became very exaggerated as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cI feel that after working all those long hours at my job, I\u2019ve finally felt some respite,\u201d Chen Xiang said to himself.</p><br/><p>The surrounding classmates were all in shock. They could not believe what they were seeing from Chen Xiang and they were wondering what in the world was happening to him.</p><br/><p>The most shocking was when Chen Xiang let out that horrifying noise. It gave everyone an expression of complete shock like they had seen a ghost.</p><br/><p>They could not help screaming on inside.</p><br/><p>Did he really have to be so dramatic?</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked on with confidence and then took the scallion pancake out of Chen Xiang\u2019s hands.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Chen Xiang woke up. He realized that he had lost a very important thing.</p><br/><p>\u201cGive the scallion pancake back to me,\u201d he said with a lot of urgency in his voice. In his eyes, he had a look of longing that was never seen before.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled and said, \u201cWeren\u2019t you just going to take one bite?\u201d</p><br/><p>The surrounding classmates, who were already dumbfounded, felt that the whole situation was a little fishy.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother, I was wrong, give the scallion pancake back to me,\u201d Chen Xiang said.</p><br/><p>There was a massive uproar!</p><br/><p>Everyone was stunned, surely that was too dramatic. Could it be that the two of them had collaborated beforehand to do this? How could someone with Chen Xiang\u2019s character behave like this?</p><br/><p>\u201cCan\u2019t resist it already?\u201d Lin Fan laughed and said.</p><br/><p>Deep in his heart, Chen Xiang wanted to say that he was not going to take another bite. However, his body was betraying him and he could not control it anymore as he felt that this scallion pancake was the best thing he had eaten in his life.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Chen Xiang had to force himself to nod. He could not take it anymore, the scallion pancake was really too delicious. The flavor was beyond description.</p><br/><p>\u201cChen Xiang, what does it taste like?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou two didn\u2019t plan this, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Their classmates all asked with curiosity. They could not understand what was going on and even though it was happening in front of their own eyes, they could not believe it.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe this.\u201d</p><br/><p>One of them took one of the scallion pancakes and wanted to see what was so different about it. However, after he took a bite of it, his expression became the same as that of Chen Xiang\u2019s.</p><br/><p>In his heart, an amazing taste that he had never tasted before was flowing around, totally irresistible to him.</p><br/><p>\u201cSh*t, is this true or not? One by one, all being hypnotized by this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe it, I\u2019m going to try it too.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone took a scallion pancake each and took a bite of it. They all wanted to know what made these scallion pancakes different from all the others.</p><br/><p>However, after taking a bite out of it, they all quietened down. From time to time, a sound would ring out.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The hotel staff members heard all the noises and their faces totally changed. The people inside could not possibly be\u2026</p><br/><p>Just thinking of it, one of the staff members\u2019 face turned red. He decided to sneak a peek inside and after he saw Lin Fan, he felt a little curious. He opened up his phone to check if it was really him and after he confirmed it, he left the scene.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan stood in his original spot, the corners of his mouth twitched. Although his scallion pancakes were delicious, did they really have to be that dramatic?</p><br/><p>\u201cDelicious.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSimply amazing flavor.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy gosh, I feel like crying.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan just patiently waited there. After a while, the scallion pancakes on the table were all gone and everyone all started to stare keenly at Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you all staring at me?\u201d He shrugged his shoulders and started to laugh.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, the whole group asked in unison, \u201cBrother Lin, can we have another one?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed and said, \u201cTell me, is it delicious?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDelicious.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan asked, \u201cStill want to eat some more?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan helplessly replied, \u201cWell, I\u2019m very sorry. There\u2019s no more already, it\u2019s only one piece per person. I wanted all of you to remember today, to know how amazing the scallion pancakes are.</p><br/><p>Everyone cried out, \u201cBrother, we are your classmates, just give us one more.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha,\u201d Lin Fan laughed. He felt very satisfied with himself as he had been waiting for this day for a long time.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The private room next door.</p><br/><p>Teacher Xia and her husband were there entertaining the school\u2019s principal. Afterward, she stood up and offered a toast, saying, \u201cThank you, sir, for taking care of us all this time. The two of us, husband and wife, are very grateful to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>The school principal replied, \u201cThere\u2019s no need to say things like that. Teacher Xia and Teacher Shen have been very conscientious and have helped out a lot of people here in our school, we should be the ones thanking you. Come, everyone, the important thing today is to be happy. It\u2019s not a must to get drunk.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, right,\u201d the rest of them said.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, the doors burst open.</p><br/><p>\u201cShen Hong, you have money to organize a dinner but don\u2019t have any to repay your debts, huh?\u201d a few big men said as they walked in.</p><br/><p>Teacher Xia\u2019s husband was Shen Hong and when he saw the people come in, his face completely changed. Then, he said, \u201cWhat are you guys doing? I\u2019ll return the money that I owe but today is my wife\u2019s birthday, please don\u2019t disturb us.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shen Hong had recently been brought to a gambling den by someone and within a short amount of time, was deeply involved in it. He lacked self-control and lost a huge amount of money. He eventually saw the wrong in his acts but the deed was done and he had already lost the money. He promised himself that he would not gamble anymore and would slowly return the money.</p><br/><p>When Teacher Xia had found out about it, she had been furious at the start, however, she got over it and she managed to convince the school principal to advance them a year of salary to pay off some of his debt.</p><br/><p>The principal\u2019s brows furrowed as he said, \u201cWhat are you guys trying to do? The money that Teacher Shen owes you will be repaid so please leave now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat makes you so special? Come, give me a place to sit.\u201d The big man had drunk a bit of wine and was a little intoxicated. He had also been eating at this restaurant when he suddenly saw Shen Hong. When the wine was being served he brought his men there to try and collect some money.</p><br/><p>The principal\u2019s face turned red, however, he could not do anything against these ruffians.</p><br/><p>Shen Hong stepped up and said, \u201cI will return the money. What else do you want?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care, I want all the money to be returned today. If not, you\u2019ll see what will happen,\u201d the big man argued loudly.</p><br/><p>Teacher Xia stepped up and said, \u201cMy husband was drawn into a gambling den by you guys and he lost a lot of money. We acknowledge that the money must be returned but can you guys be more reasonable?\u201d</p><br/><p>The intoxicated man came up and at the corner of his mouth, let out a smile. Then, he gave Teacher Xia a huge pat on the shoulder and said, \u201cYou might be a bit old but you\u2019re still pretty attractive\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Shen Hong stepped up, slapped the man\u2019s hand away and said, \u201cPlease have some respect.\u201d</p><br/><p>The man fiercely replied, \u201cRespect? If you want respect then return me my money.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>At the hotel office area, there was a short haired, pretty and soft looking lady. She was carrying a girl in her arms and softly speaking to her. At that moment, the door was knocked on.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome in.\u201d</p><br/><p>The hotel attendant came in and after a quick glance at the person seated there, he lowered his head and said, \u201cBrother Qiang Qiang, we just saw the godly doctor enter the hotel.\u201d</p><br/><p>Brother Qiang Qiang was the person in charge of this place. Although she was very pretty, she always felt that she was more of a guy. Also, she was always surrounded by girls.</p><br/><p>The whole hotel was scared of this Brother Qiang Qiang.</p><br/><p>However, they found the name \u2018Brother Qiang Qiang\u2019 very weird. They had no idea how she got that name and they didn\u2019t even know the boss\u2019s real name.</p><br/><p>At times, they would also think that for a lady this pretty to become like that was a pity. It was like someone carefully taking care of their cabbage only for it to be given to a pig.</p><br/><p>At this moment, when Brother Qiang Qiang heard the two words, \u2018godly doctor\u2019, her expression changed and she said, \u201cReally?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYea, he\u2019s in room 605. When I was serving the dishes over there, I saw him in the room. I even went online to compare the faces and I\u2019m certain it is him,\u201d the attendant said.</p><br/><p>Brother Qiang Qiang let go of the girl in her hands, got up and headed out of the room. Her facial expression was slightly emotional and it was like she was in a hurry.</p><br/><p>She had only just found out about the godly doctor today and when she wanted to go look for him, he was gone and no one knew where he was.</p><br/><p>She did not think that she would find him at the hotel. How lucky.</p></div>\n</div>"}

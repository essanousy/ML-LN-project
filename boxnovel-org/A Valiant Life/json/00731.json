If he didn\u2019t do anything about it, would he still be Justice Fan?</p><br/><p>Although this wouldn\u2019t be a huge problem for Zhao Li, Lin Fan didn\u2019t feel comfortable with it.</p><br/><p>The scheme that Huang Fei used was just too despicable.</p><br/><p>He had never seen someone who cursed their father dead and their mother sick. He was an unfilial child and if people knew about this, this could impact the younger generation to think that they could trade morals for success.</p><br/><p>The bad habits of the younger generation now were not impacted by their parent, but the celebrities that they followed. In order to impart the proper values to the younger generation, Lin Fan felt the need to eradicate bad influences on society.</p><br/><p>In no time, the TV Host came back with Huang Fei\u2019s phone.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan took the phone and saw the password page. \u201cHuang Fei, what is the password?\u201d</p><br/><p>Huang Fei looked nervous. How could he tell the passcode to Lin Fan? Thereafter, he stood his ground, \u201cTeacher Lin, could you show a little respect for me? By humiliating me, you are humiliating my mother as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Li looked at Lin Fan in anger, \u201cYou really are disgusting. On what grounds do you have to take away the dreams of someone? If it\u2019s because you want to prove yourself as a teacher, this is not the way to do it!\u201d</p><br/><p>The crowd roared.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck! What on earth is going on? Is he trying to destroy this program?\u201d the vice-president said helplessly.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher Zhao, you are a veteran and you should know better not to deal with things in anger. You followed your emotions to pick this contestant based on his tragic backstory and this is unfair to the other contestants. If his backstory is indeed true, I will voluntarily quit \u2018Strongest Heavenly Voice\u2019 and apologize to this contestant for all that I have said.\u201d</p><br/><p>After Zhao Li heard that, she secretly rejoiced. If that really happened, it would be the greatest thing that happened to her. She looked at Huang Fei, \u201cHuang Fei, tell him your password. I believe what you said completely, but this person doesn\u2019t.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh?\u201d Huang Fei was stunned. He didn\u2019t know what to do. At that moment, the crowd also started chanting, \u201cGive him your password!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGive him your password!\u201d</p><br/><p>The crowd all started following blindly. This was indeed the first time they were seeing something like this.</p><br/><p>The internet was also exploding with discussions.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis thing just got huge.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf things were as the contestant described, won\u2019t Master Lin have to leave?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, so what if he leaves? He isn\u2019t fit to be a teacher if he constantly suspects everyone as bad.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin is always correct. It doesn\u2019t matter if you believe him or not, but I will always support him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy do I have this weird feeling? Huang Fei refusing to give his password is giving me a sense that he is insecure about something.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh? You make a really good point. However, he could also be feeling gloomy on the inside as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Huang Fei couldn\u2019t take it any longer, as he clenched his teeth, \u201c2915.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan opened the phone and typed in the password. All eyes were on him as he typed in the digits.</p><br/><p>There were people who believed him and there were people who did, but now it was time for the truth to be revealed.</p><br/><p>After a while.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan still hadn\u2019t found the number, and the people in the crowd were on tenterhooks.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking of doing? You\u2019re just wasting everyone\u2019s time here. As a teacher, you shouldn\u2019t be suspicious of the contestants. Apologize to him immediately, and maybe we still can forgive you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sister Ying, I am going to get revenge for you and humiliate this person in front of everyone.</p><br/><p>At this moment. Huang Fei heaved a sigh of relief. He suddenly remembered that he hadn\u2019t saved his parents numbers, and so it was almost impossible for this person to find the contact of his parents in his phone.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?\u201d Just at this moment, Lin Fan let out a sound of shock, \u201cThis contestant, you didn\u2019t save your parent\u2019s numbers at all. However, I realized something peculiar.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn the dial history list, this number called you eighteen times in a row. I think for someone to call you eighteen times, it means that this person cares for you. However, you didn\u2019t pick up at all, meaning you are trying to avoid this person, so\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan hadn\u2019t finished speaking yet.</p><br/><p>Huang Fei\u2019s phone rang.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the screen and chuckled to himself. \u201cThis is the number that called you eighteen times, and adding on to this, makes nineteen. Looks like I get to pick this one up\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, Huang Fei was panicking. His face was full or terror and his heart was pounding quickly.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t pick up the phone, don\u2019t pick up the phone\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan picked up the phone, thereafter placing the phone on speaker mode next to his microphone.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy haven\u2019t you picked my calls?\u201d The person on the other side of the phone was a male voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello, can I ask if this is Huang Fei\u2019s father?\u201d Lin Fan asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I am his father. Who are you?\u201d an answer came from the other side of the phone, shocking everyone.</p><br/><p>Huang Fei plopped himself on the floor in shock, his face full of fright.</p><br/><p>It is over. It\u2019s the end.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat can\u2019t be, right? Huang Fei said that his father passed away not long after he was born, leaving him a gravely ill mother to take care, then you\u2026\u201d Lin Fan said, his gaze directed towards Zhao Li. Zhao Li\u2019s face was dumbfounded and she didn\u2019t know what to say.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? That rascal wishing me dead? You tell him to return the twenty thousand dollars that he stole from us. That is our coffin money. Does he want to anger us to death?\u201d</p><br/><p>Click!</p><br/><p>The phone hung up from the other side.</p><br/><p>At this moment, the audience all exclaimed in shock.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck, so it was like that!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLier! That person is a huge liar!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI was just moved to tears by that guy just now! All that was a lie?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat a b*stard, acting all pitiful and trying to steal our sympathy!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut how did Master Lin know?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, Master Lin is Master Lin. Don\u2019t ask him how he knows. All you have to do is just to become a brain dead fan of his and follow him. He is always right.\u201d</p><br/><p>On the internet.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck, what a turn of events.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, look who\u2019s the one laughing now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis show is too cool! Could it be that it was scripted?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy a*s. This is all broadcasted live! I\u2019m even here at the live location.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLook, Zhao Li\u2019s face is all black now!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Lin Fan pressed both his hands together, \u201cAlright, the truth is out. You may leave now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Huang Fei lowered his head and walked off to the jeering of the crowd, but he knew that his name was now well-known</p><br/><p>However, he was infamous.</p><br/><p>Zhao Li stood over there, not knowing what to do. Her face was green with rage as she never thought that she would fall into the trap of a liar.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was laughing to himself, \u201cTeacher Zhao, I hope that you won\u2019t trust every single of your own judgments. When you meet conflict, you should hear every side of the argument before making judgments. However, I can\u2019t blame you. You are one of the music veterans and probably aren\u2019t used to being refuted in your judgments. But maybe it\u2019s time to change- just take a look at your selection. He almost convinced all of us into his lie. Alright, you should sit down now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Li looked on in disbelief. Did I just get taught a lesson?</p><br/><p>However, she couldn\u2019t refute Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Lin Fan turned his gaze to Liu Ying Dong, \u201cTeacher Liu, I\u2019m not scolding you, but your attitude isn\u2019t very good. If you aren\u2019t happy with me, you can just say it out loud instead of breaking your microphone or showing a black face. You must know that we have a lot of young people watching this show and they are easily influenced by our behavior, so I hope that you can control yourself. Otherwise, I think you shouldn\u2019t be in this role as a teacher, or else you might wrongly influence the children watching this program.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Ying Dong was seething with rage, and his face had turned green. He very much wanted to curse at Master Lin, asking him to go and f*ck his mother, but\u2026</p><br/><p>Admitted defeat.</p><br/><p>Online.</p><br/><p>Everyone was laughing.</p><br/><p>Master Lin finally started his revenge, but it wasn\u2019t a lowly kind of revenge. He stood on the high ground of justice, and no one could refute his statements.</p><br/><p>\u201c6666, my Master Lin is so f*cking awesome!\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

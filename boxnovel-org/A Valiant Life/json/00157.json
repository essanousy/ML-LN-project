Those hands required treatment. They were so swollen that they couldn't even hold on to a steering wheel.</p><br/><p>The old doctor pushed his glasses up, \"How did you hurt it? It's so swollen.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan answered firmly, \"By knocking on a door.\"</p><br/><p>The old doctor pressed his palm, \"Does it hurt?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded. What a stupid question. \"It should be fine if I just take some anti-inflammatory medicine, right?\"</p><br/><p>The old doctor got up and walked to the medicine counter, \"This swelling isn't normal. It's quite serious. You can't take the medicine yet. Apply a cold compress to it for the first 24 hours, then apply hot compress after the first 24 hours. These 'San Qi injury pills' can improve your blood circulation and dispel blood stasis. It will reduce the swelling and pain. Don't be too anxious, typically, the swelling will go down in 4 to 5 days. If something doesn't feel right, go to the hospital. Don't do any kind of work and maintain a relaxed state.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded. Although the swelling was rather inconvenient, he didn't regret it. At least he saved a child. It was worth it.</p><br/><p>He paid the old doctor, then left.</p><br/><p>At Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian cried out in shock, \"Why are your hands swollen like yams? What did you do?\"</p><br/><p>\"I saved someone. I knocked down a copper door,\" said Lin Fan coolly.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian stared at him, dumbfounded, \"Knocked down a copper door?\"</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian couldn't believe it. That would have been way too extreme. Although he was powerful, he was still human. To go against that kind of hard object would just be punishing one's own body.</p><br/><p>\"Oh yeah, did something happen to a kid over there?\" asked Fraud Tian.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded, \"Yep. A kid fell from the 28th floor, but he was lucky. His head was big, so it got stuck in the window grills on the 26th floor. If it wasn't for those window grills, he wouldn't have been saved. The owner of that 26th-floor apartment wasn't around and he even installed an electronic fingerprint burglar-proof door. The situation was dire, so I knocked down the door. It hurt like hell.\"</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian was convinced, \"You're awesome\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan asked tensely, \"So the kid was fine in the end, right?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan, \"I think so, maybe just hurt a little bit.\"</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan let out a breath of air in relief, then she looked at Lin Fan in admiration, \"Master Lin, you are really great. You're a hero!\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled, \"It's not easy being a hero. Look, my slim hands have become pig trotters!\"</p><br/><p>Wu Tian He laughed, \"Master Lin, it must be inconvenient to have your hands in that state. Why don't you let You Lan take care of you for the time being?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was initially going to agree without thinking, but then he realized that something wasn't right. That Wu Tian He was doing it purposely, wasn't he? He wanted to put the two of them alone together.</p><br/><p>On such a warm night, with a passionate man and woman together, something could very likely happen.</p><br/><p>Lin Gan laughed, \"It's fine, my hands aren't in that bad a state.\"</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan glared at her father. Those words had come too suddenly. She wasn't prepared at all.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>At the police station.</p><br/><p>A group of people sat around a computer, watching a video.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>One after another, thunderous sounds were emitted from the speaker.</p><br/><p>\"Amazing. That's way too amazing.\"</p><br/><p>The group of policemen was discussing, with astonishment written all over their faces.</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian just came back from handling official business. He had a very big lead on the telemarketing scammers and now, he was just waiting for them to fall into his trap.</p><br/><p>\"What are all of you doing?\" Liu Xiao Tian stood below the air conditioner. It was very cooling.</p><br/><p>\"Chief, come and take a look. This youngster is incredible. That 'Yue Ma Lock' was picked in 20 seconds, then he even knocked down this copper door,\" said one of the policemen.</p><br/><p>\"He's that incredible?\" said Liu Xiao Tian in a surprised tone. He then looked at the screen. There was indeed a man pounding on a copper door ferociously. When the man on the screen turned around, he cried out in shock, \"Isn't that Little Boss?\"</p><br/><p>The policemen were surprised, \"Chief, you recognize him?\"</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian took a closer look. It was confirmed, \"Yeah, I recognize him. He's Master Lin from Cloud Street. It can't be that you guys haven't heard of him.\"</p><br/><p>\"Huh? That's him?\" The policemen were stunned.</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian asked, \"What's this? Could it be that Little Boss did something bad?\"</p><br/><p>He had a good impression of the Little Boss and he was also very grateful towards him. If something happened to the Little Boss, he would have been very upset.</p><br/><p>\"No, he didn't do anything wrong. Rather, he did a very good deed\u2026\" The policemen then explained the entire situation. They even described that soul-stirring scene with accuracy and emotion.</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian never thought that something like this would happen. He saved a life! Looking at the Little Boss on the screen, his heart was filled with admiration.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Lin Fan sent Wu You Lan to the advertising firm to print a piece of paper. On it, were the words:</p><br/><p>\"Master Lin is ill and will temporarily stop selling scallion pancakes for a week.\"</p><br/><p>He had no other choice. With those hands, there was no way he could sell scallion pancakes.</p><br/><p>In the meantime, Lin Fan wanted to use the opportunity to explore a bit as well as get some proper rest. Ever since he opened the shop, he barely got any rest at all.</p><br/><p>In life, it's good to roam around more often.</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>Supreme Tiger Electronic Fingerprint Doors Manufacturer.</p><br/><p>They were a company which produced high-end locks.

However, it\u2019s still far from Xu Song. The odds of you winning me are practically zero.\u201d</p><br/><p>His words were too arrogant. The audience watching the show couldn\u2019t take it anymore.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck! This b*stard is really too arrogant. He merely got one point, why does he need to be so imprudent?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cB*tch! All the best Zhang Zi Wen!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFighting!\u201d</p><br/><p>In the Japanese Broadcasting Station.</p><br/><p>\u201cGentleman Yiming has to show his true ability! These Chinese are really sorrowful. Can\u2019t they see that Gentleman Yiming is going easy on him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIndeed! How could Gentleman Yiming not receive that initial ball? They really think that they are the best.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha! Zhenping Yiming is going to defeat another Chinese opponent today! It\u2019s too exciting!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cContinue to watch the broadcast. Let\u2019s see what the Chinese are going to do.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Zhang Zi Wen took a deep breath. His breathing was somewhat hurried, and the pressure on him suddenly became much greater.</p><br/><p>Normal people might not be able to tell, but he could already feel that the other party was just throwing the game before this. Right now, he was afraid that he was showing his true abilities.</p><br/><p>The only thing was that he didn\u2019t expect this b*stard to be so good.</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t lose. He definitely could not lose!</p><br/><p>He grunted to cheer himself on. After which, he served.</p><br/><p>Everyone was watching in anticipation.</p><br/><p>Each second and minute passed by.</p><br/><p>10 : 4</p><br/><p>Everyone was stunned.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t Zhang Zi Wen who was leading, but rather, it was the Japanese.</p><br/><p>It was the last point. If he were to lose this, he would truly be done for.</p><br/><p>Zhang Zi Wen had a head full of perspiration and this hands started to tremble. The pressure on him was so immense he felt like he was going to collapse.</p><br/><p>He took every ball very seriously, without relaxing for a single moment.</p><br/><p>But he just didn\u2019t know why he couldn\u2019t receive some balls.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, he had already calculated, his opponent was an expert. His counter-attacks were extremely fast. At times, he couldn\u2019t even react in time.</p><br/><p>Zhenping Yiming held the ball and sneered, \u201cIt\u2019s the last point. Are you ready?\u201d</p><br/><p>Even though he was speaking in Japanese and nobody could understand him, but there were translated subtitles for the audience watching on their TV screens. They closed their eyes in despair.</p><br/><p>There was no chance of winning left.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s over.</p><br/><p>*ping*</p><br/><p>The round started.</p><br/><p>It took merely six seconds.</p><br/><p>Zhang Zi Wen stared blankly at the table tennis ball bouncing on the ground while he stood rooted to the ground.</p><br/><p>How did it turn out like this?</p><br/><p>Zhenping Yiming placed the bat on the table and jerked his shoulders, \u201cI won. Easy peasy.\u201d</p><br/><p>The audience saw this expression. They couldn\u2019t wait to kill this b*stard.</p><br/><p>In the Broadcasting Station.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t watch longer. I\u2019m turning it off. Take care, everybody.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy mood was originally pretty good today, however, after watching Shanghai TV, I feel like dying.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck your mom, Shanghai TV! Just you wait!\u201d</p><br/><p>The host looked at the situation on-set. He didn\u2019t even know what he should say. He looked at Zhang Zi Wen, continued to stand frozen on the stop, and said nervously, \u201cIn a competition of skills, having winners and losers are very common. A huge thank you to both of them for bringing us an entertaining match!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Zi Wen lowered his head. Although he was currently recording a live show, his eyes still turned red.</p><br/><p>He failed to live up to everyone\u2019s expectations.</p><br/><p>The host looked at Zhang Zi Wen in front of him and comforted him softly, getting him to calm down.</p><br/><p>At this moment, he looked down at the audience, then at the guests\u2019 table.</p><br/><p>His gaze locked directly at Master Lin. He knew that the situation was going out of control and the show was over. However, he still hoped that someone would be able to flip this situation around.</p><br/><p>However, even a professional national team member had lost. Looking at his prospects, how could he ever match up to this Japanese.</p><br/><p>At this moment, the host and Master Lin looked face to face.</p><br/><p>From what he knew, Master Lin was an amazing person. Many miracles happened in his hands. However, the situation now didn\u2019t only require a miracle to win, but rather, it needed an absolute display of ability.</p><br/><p>All of a sudden, the host wondered if his vision was becoming blurred.</p><br/><p>He realized that Master Lin\u2019s lips were moving. Furthermore, he had nodded in his direction.</p><br/><p>Even though he didn\u2019t understand lip-reading, but the shape of Master Lin\u2019s mouth wasn\u2019t hard to interpret.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet me do it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although he wasn\u2019t too sure if that was what he meant, but it seemed to be the meaning his lips were trying to express.</p><br/><p>At this moment, the host didn\u2019t bother about too much. He already deeply trusted Master Lin.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe match just now was very entertaining. However, one of our guests would like to play against the champion of the Asian Championships. Let us welcome Master Lin up on stage!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed inwardly. It seemed like the host wasn\u2019t stupid and could understand him.</p><br/><p>The desolated audience in the live broadcasting room was stunned when they heard the host.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat the f*ck? What\u2019s this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin is going up on stage? This host must have hurt his brain. Wouldn\u2019t this just throw Master Lin\u2019s reputation away?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck! Master Lin is already getting ridiculed just for being a guest. What a dumb host. Do you f*cking think that Master Lin is an all-rounded athlete?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck! I\u2019ll f*ck your mum Shanghai TV. If you disgrace my idol, I\u2019ll f*ck your whole family!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin don\u2019t go up! Don\u2019t ever go up! Don\u2019t disgrace yourself!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>However, from their point of view, Master Lin stood up and walked to the stage with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how to play table tennis and I\u2019ve never played it, yet you want me to play against a professional? The pressure is really huge.\u201d Lin Fan laughed as he walked to the stage.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh?\u201d The host was stunned as he looked at Lin Fan as if he couldn\u2019t react.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t expect that Master Lin wouldn\u2019t know how to play.</p><br/><p>What was the meaning of his nod and his moving lips?</p><br/><p>Lin Fan went beside the host and whispered, \u201cWatch me.\u201d</p><br/><p>The host spun his head and looked up at Master Lin. His heart skipped a beat, but very quickly, he calmed back down.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, you said you don\u2019t know how to play table tennis?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cI can\u2019t say that I don\u2019t know how to. I\u2019ve played it once in a while. I\u2019ve played twice against Xu Song. He told me that my skills are adequate and if I were to practice it seriously, I would still make the amateur level.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh? Master Lin, you\u2019ve played against Xu Song?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed, \u201cI played against him on that stone table over there. I feel that my skills are okay.\u201d</p><br/><p>In the National Team.</p><br/><p>\u201cXu Song, you\u2019ve played against Master Lin before?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xu Song was stunned, \u201cNo I haven\u2019t. I have never even seen him before.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen this is\u2026\u201d Everyone was stunned. They didn\u2019t quite understand.</p><br/><p>On the Internet.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin has played against Xu Song before?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey played my a*s! Master Lin doesn\u2019t even know Xu Song.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat does Master Lin mean then?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou ask me but who am I going to ask?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Master Lin picked up the bat, \u201cI\u2019m quite rusty, but I think I can play against the champion of the Asian Championships. I\u2019m feeling rather up to it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhenping Yiming looked at the person in front of him. His heart was full of disdain. Wasn\u2019t he just looking to be abused?</p><br/><p>However, he didn\u2019t mind showing off today, giving the Japanese a good lesson.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan opened the Encyclopedia.</p><br/><p>He looked at the table tennis knowledge. It was rather expensive. It required 1000 Encyclopedic points.</p><br/><p>However, this situation was different. He had to destroy his opponent.</p><br/><p>He exchanged his points for it.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p></div>\n</div>"}

Many people saw business opportunities in this influenza.</p><br/><p>But these business opportunities still required some hype to be generated. Otherwise, they wouldn\u2019t be completely effective.</p><br/><p>Many small groups were discreetly discussing it.</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone, go and hype this matter up. We have to exaggerate the importance of these medications.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWait, how long will this influenza last? If it is only a short period of time, it would be pointless.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ve already inquired. This influenza is quite problematic. A group of professionals has been researching for days straight but they still haven\u2019t found a single lead.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen will Master Lin make a move?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you think he\u2019s a god? Do you think he knows everything? This influenza is the newest virus. He\u2019s a Chinese doctor. He doesn\u2019t even know the theory behind this. If he wants to conquer it, he has to think he\u2019s a god.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true. He was able to conquer leukemia only thanks to the countless findings from his predecessors. Enough talk. I\u2019ll go and hype it up right now. We\u2019ll bump up the price and earn some money.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m in a broadcast room right now. This small broadcaster is daring enough to give us a look at the situation at Huang Yun Town. Split the cost with me. I\u2019m going to send a big gift to the broadcaster and tell him to sneak into the town so we can get a clear look inside the town.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright. I\u2019ve sent a red packet to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, many business people seized the opportunity and were preparing to hype it up. No matter what, they had to earn a big sum of money.</p><br/><p>Huang Yun Town.</p><br/><p>\u201cHost, if you can infiltrate Huang Yun Town, I\u2019ll send you $10,000 without saying another word.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ma Jia Jun was broadcasting. When he saw these words, he was utterly stunned. But he still felt a little scared.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going, it\u2019s too dangerous. Everyone inside is infected. What will I do if I go in and I get infected?\u201d</p><br/><p>The netizens in the broadcast room wanted to see what was going on inside as well. They started typing in the comments section.</p><br/><p>\u201cHost, you have no guts. You don\u2019t even dare to go in there.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, this is too disappointing. I wanted to follow him at first but looking at this, it\u2019s better to unfollow him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnfollow. Unfollow.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ma Jia Jun panicked. It had been so hard to gain some popularity. If he were to lose it all at once, it would be a big loss. But thinking about the situation in Huang Yun Town, he was very afraid too.</p><br/><p>\u201cBroadcaster, $20,000. And don\u2019t worry, I understand this influenza. You won\u2019t get infected all of a sudden. Just don\u2019t talk to anyone.\u201d</p><br/><p>Those $20,000 made Ma Jia Jun\u2019s heart shift. In this small county, $20,000 was half a year\u2019s worth of salary.</p><br/><p>He was contemplating it. This person was right. As long as he didn\u2019t talk to anyone, he wouldn\u2019t be in danger of being infected. This was something that he knew too.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright. Give me the money first and I\u2019ll go in. I know a small path that leads to Huang Yun Town. This path is definitely unknown by those people who are sealing off the town.\u201d Ma Jia Jun was prepared to sneak in.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, give me your WeChat ID. I\u2019ll send you a red packet.\u201d</p><br/><p>After everything was done and Ma Jia Jun had gotten his money, he went towards the hidden path without hesitation. After passing the heavy obstructions, he immediately ran in while no one was watching. Then, he panned the camera around the surroundings.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m in. Take a look for yourselves,\u201d said Ma Jia Jun softly. When he saw someone pass by, he hid far away.</p><br/><p>The netizens in the broadcast room saw the situation and were momentarily stunned.</p><br/><p>They realized that the condition of the people wasn\u2019t good. A lot of them looked very sick and all of them were wearing masks. They were completely lifeless and they seemed very gloomy.</p><br/><p>Ma Jia Jun furrowed his brows. A piercing smell had entered his nose.</p><br/><p>At that moment, the townspeople spotted Ma Jia Jun and all of them were curious. Then, they regained their senses and cried out in shock, \u201cDoes anyone know this guy? Where did he come from?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Could it be that he sneaked in here? If he sneaks out, won\u2019t he carry the influenza out with him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHurry up and catch him. Don\u2019t let him run.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ma Jia Jun hadn\u2019t realized it at first but when he suddenly heard these voices, he was so frightened that he almost jumped. Seeing these townspeople running towards him, his soul left his body.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, what are you all doing? Don\u2019t come near me!\u201d</p><br/><p>A few of the townspeople immediately grabbed onto Ma Jia Jun. Ma Jia Jun struggled as he fell to the ground. \u201cWhat are you all doing? Let go of me. I\u2019ll stop broadcasting. Let go of me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Initially, these townspeople had thought of running. But after the Mayor\u2019s explanation, they understood that they couldn\u2019t run. Otherwise, the influenza would be spread to the outside.</p><br/><p>Moreover, they believed that the government wouldn\u2019t just ignore them. Hence, they had decided to live their daily lives as usual for now.</p><br/><p>In the midst of the struggle, the townspeople kept scolding Ma Jia Jun and their saliva flew from their mouths as they did so. The saliva landed on Ma Jia Jun\u2019s face and he felt it. He was completely dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been infected.\u201d Ma Jia Jun had a look of despair on his face. And the broadcast ended there.</p><br/><p>The netizens in the broadcast room started commenting.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s over. The host has fallen.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have nothing to say. The host has been captured. This infiltration game has ended.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFor $20,000, he completely gave himself up. This is truly tragic.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone hadn\u2019t expected things to turn out like this. Besides a bit of sympathy for the host, they felt nothing else. Then, they went on to watch other broadcasts. To them, this was just entertainment.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, some of the business people who wanted to hype things up were very satisfied. This had been very rewarding. If they spread this video, they would be able to make the public fearful.</p><br/><p>Ma Jia Jun had been caught. The townspeople hurriedly did even more checks to ensure that there were no loopholes where people could sneak in. Meanwhile, Ma Jia Jun could only stay inside. He had not only entered but also had close contact with the townspeople. Unless the professionals were to find the cure, he would not be able to leave anymore.</p><br/><p>On the Internet.</p><br/><p>Videos started appearing one after another.</p><br/><p>\u2018The situation in Huang Yun Town now is very dangerous. The masses should prepare themselves.\u2019</p><br/><p>This title drew the attention of many netizens. But when they saw the video, all of them were astounded. The only thought they had was to quickly buy medicine in precaution.</p><br/><p>In the research lab.</p><br/><p>The specialist team was working hard to solve the problem but they did not have a single lead. This made them all a little anxious.</p><br/><p>But at this point, there was no use in being anxious. They could only try their best.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, the relevant departments started taking notice of the sudden appearance of news on the Internet. After all, this sudden revealing of the situation could easily cause panic. Hence, they had to stop the panic as quickly as they could.</p><br/><p>But no matter how they tried to explain things, the seeds of panic had already been planted in the citizens\u2019 hearts and they were gradually starting to grow.</p></div>\n</div>"}

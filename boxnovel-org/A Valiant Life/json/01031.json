He felt that what these people said wasn\u2019t quite right. It was just a little flawed.</p><br/><p>What did they mean when they said the influenza was easy and wasn\u2019t much at all? Lin Fan wouldn\u2019t admit to that. They were completely denouncing him falsely. It had clearly been very difficult to cure the influenza.</p><br/><p>As for him being brave and taking on a huge undertaking, of course he would admit to that.</p><br/><p>After all, that was exactly the kind of person he was.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan went behind Lin Fan and massaged his shoulders with her slender fingers. Her tender lips opened slightly. \u201cBrother Lin, everyone on the Internet is praising you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan leaned back pleasurably. These days were really comfortable and they passed by very easily. \u201cThey\u2019re not praising me, they\u2019re falsely accusing me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, he pointed at one of the comments unhappily.</p><br/><p>\u201cLook at this comment. It\u2019s saying that I\u2019m slapping those specialists in the face. Do you think that\u2019s right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd this one is even worse. It\u2019s saying that I cured the influenza very easily but I purposely waited until the second day. If this isn\u2019t a false accusation, I don\u2019t know what it is.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd this one is actually saying that I ruined many pharmacy businesses. I just treated the illness, I don\u2019t even sell medicine. How could I have ruined their businesses?\u201d</p><br/><p>These comments came one after another. All kinds of random comments left him lost for words.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian glanced at Lin Fan. \u201cHow many people have you offended altogether by resolving this matter?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded. \u201cIt seems that I\u2019ve offended some people again. I heard that these pharmacies were starting to hoard the medications again but they didn\u2019t expect me to cure the influenza.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang said angrily, \u201cThese pharmacies are really ridiculous. They just raise the price as they like. Now that they can\u2019t sell the medications that they\u2019ve hoarded, it\u2019s not Brother Lin\u2019s fault.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan nodded as well. \u201cThat\u2019s right. These people were thinking of making money out of other people\u2019s suffering. Luckily, the influenza didn\u2019t spread outside. Otherwise, who knows how much of other people\u2019s hard-earned money they would have earned?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan locked his phone and decided to stop caring about this matter.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet them be then. There\u2019s nothing to be afraid of.\u201d</p><br/><p>*Ding ding*</p><br/><p>At that moment, his phone rang.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan indicated for everyone to stop talking for a moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy mom is calling. Wait a moment.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, he answered the call.</p><br/><p>\u201cMom, what is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Mama Lin, who was on the other end of the call, sounded a little strange. \u201cSon, can\u2019t your mom call you if I\u2019m free?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cMom, when did I ever say that? This is just what I usually say when I answer calls.\u201d</p><br/><p>After being told off by his mother, he really felt that he had been wrong to say that. How could he speak to his mother like that?</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan was very quiet but she was listening the whole time. She knew that Auntie was always trying to get Brother Lin to find a girlfriend. She was anxious as well as she didn\u2019t know who would end up with Brother Lin in the end.</p><br/><p>Mama Lin said, \u201cAlright, Mom won\u2019t talk to you about this. Think about it, is there something you\u2019re forgetting?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was taken aback and a little confused. <em>What did I forget?</em></p><br/><p>\u201cMom, is it that I haven\u2019t gone back in a long time?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThink again.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan racked his brain thinking. \u201cMom, I really can\u2019t think of anything. It\u2019s better if you just tell me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSigh, you brat. Your dad is turning fifty. Did you forget?\u201d said Mama Lin, \u201cWe always remember your birthday but not you\u2019ve even forgotten your dad\u2019s birthday.\u201d</p><br/><p>After his mother\u2019s reminder, Lin Fan suddenly realized it. In his heart, he felt guilty as well. \u201cMom, I was wrong. I was really wrong. I can\u2019t believe I forgot such a big event. It\u2019s my fault. I\u2019ll go back tomorrow.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMmm. Your dad didn\u2019t want to do anything but I thought that it wasn\u2019t right. Although your dad doesn\u2019t have many skills, he still raised this family up. This person who has such a large ego and keeps on bragging about his son every day can\u2019t suddenly be left alone on his fiftieth birthday.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cMmm, I got it. I\u2019ll organize it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, right. Have you found a girlfriend yet? Hurry up and bring her back for us to see. Even if you\u2019re doing well, if you can\u2019t find a girlfriend, it would be useless.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan had no words. \u201cMom, I\u2019m hanging up. I\u2019ll come back tomorrow.\u201d</p><br/><p>Without waiting for his mother to say more, he immediately hung up.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian glanced at Lin Fan. \u201cWhat is it? Are you leaving Shanghai again?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cMmm. My dad is turning fifty. I have to go back to make preparations for it. I nearly forgot and my mom had to remind me. I really didn\u2019t do my part as a son.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian nodded. \u201cYou really didn\u2019t do your part as a son. To forget such a big event. It\u2019s fine. Leave the shop to me. I guarantee that it\u2019ll be lively.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan thought for a moment. \u201cAlright, this shop will be left to you guys. I\u2019m going out to buy something for my dad. I have to go and choose a birthday present.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan started to get restless. \u201cBrother Lin, do you need me to accompany you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved his hand. \u201cNo need. I\u2019ll just go myself.\u201d</p><br/><p>Not being able to follow Brother Lin to buy the present, she felt a little depressed.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan started his car and drove off.</p><br/><p>In his heart, he was thinking about what he should buy.</p><br/><p>He reached the shopping mall and glanced around. He hadn\u2019t thought of what to buy yet.</p><br/><p>But when he passed by a gold shop, he stopped in his tracks. In his mind, he recalled something from when he had been over ten years old. His dad had said something at home.</p><br/><p>\u2018In the future, if my son can give me a gold bracelet when I turn fifty, that would be great.\u2019</p><br/><p>Later on, Lin Fan had gone to a mediocre university. After graduating, he hadn\u2019t been able to find a good job either. That gold bracelet had never been mentioned by his father again.</p><br/><p>Perhaps his father didn\u2019t want to give him too much pressure.</p><br/><p>Now, he was doing pretty well in Shanghai and so many things had happened. But his dad had kept the same old mindset and perhaps he still didn\u2019t want to bring it up.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan entered the shop.</p><br/><p>In front of the counter, the staff member was all smiles. \u201cSir, may I ask what you need?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cShow me the gold bracelets for men.\u201d</p><br/><p>The staff member asked, \u201cIs this for yourself or for someone a little older?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cFor someone older.\u201d</p><br/><p>The staff member said warmly, \u201cPlease come and take a look over here. These are all our latest models. They\u2019re very suitable for older men.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan took a close look. He had to pick a good-looking one. Then, he pointed at one of them. \u201cLet me take a look at this one.\u201d</p><br/><p>The staff member smiled as he took out that bracelet. \u201cSir, this is our shop\u2019s newest model. It\u2019s usually gifted to the older generation by the younger generation. It portrays a message of family harmony and prosperity.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan took a look at it and was quite pleased. \u201cI\u2019ll take this one then. Help me to wrap it up.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d</p><br/><p>This bracelet cost $25,000. It wasn\u2019t too expensive.</p><br/><p>After Lin Fan left the shop, the staff member looked at the colleague next to him. \u201cDo you feel as if that man that just came looked a bit like that Master Lin? Do you think they look alike?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow can that be? Think about Master Lin\u2019s status and identity. How could he buy a $25,000 bracelet? If he buys a bracelet, he would buy a more expensive one. But really, they do look a little alike. He just looks a little uglier than how Master Lin looks in his Weibo profile picture.\u201d</p><br/><p>If Lin Fan knew what these people said, he would surely yell out.</p><br/><p><em>Don\u2019t you know that there\u2019s something called Meitu Xiu Xiu*?</em></p><br/><p>(*Note: Meitu Xiu Xiu is a photo editing application that is popular in China.)</p></div>\n</div>"}

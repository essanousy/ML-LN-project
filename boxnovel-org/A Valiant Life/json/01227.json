I want $200 of oranges. Is this your personal number?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll add you on WeChat for payment.\u201d</p><br/><p>Before Chen Xiao Dong could reply, the caller hung up the phone.</p><br/><p>\u201cDad, someone bought oranges again.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Shan wanted to say that there were only two people who bought oranges. However, the phone rang again.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello, I want to buy some oranges.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The phone rang repeatedly, and Chen Xiao Dong became extremely busy.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait, may I know how did you find out about us?\u201d Chen Xiao Dong asked. He wanted to know what was going on.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin reposted it. We\u2019re just helping him.\u201d</p><br/><p>After he hung up the phone, Chen Xiao Dong was stunned.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin?\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, he said excitedly, \u201cDad, Master Lin helped to promote our business.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSon, who is this Master Lin?\u201d Chen Shan was stunned by the repeated calls. He did not know what was going on.</p><br/><p>\u201cDad, it\u2019s the Master Lin who has received numerous awards. You said that he\u2019s really impressive,\u201d Chen Xiao Dong exclaimed. He did not expect Master Lin to repost something like this.</p><br/><p>After that, he continued to pick up the calls. Meanwhile, he checked Master Lin\u2019s Weibo. He was stunned that Master Lin had really reposted it.</p><br/><p>The reach of Master Lin\u2019s Weibo was incredible. The repost must have reached many fans, and it was clearly working.</p><br/><p>He was really grateful for Master Lin, and he did not know how to thank him. He just posted a comment on Master Lin\u2019s repost.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you, Master Lin. Thank you so much.\u201d</p><br/><p>At Cloud Street!</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was surfing Weibo. When he saw the comment, he smiled and replied, \u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou Lan, I think the situation has improved after my repost. The person even thanked me for it,\u201d Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan was really happy. \u201cOf course. Brother Lin, you should know how many people follow you on Weibo, and they would definitely help.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe credit goes to you. If not for you, I wouldn\u2019t have known about this,\u201d Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>It was just a simple favour to him. However, to others, it was something worth noting.</p><br/><p>The next day!</p><br/><p>At Cloud Street, Lin Fan was using his phone and stumbled upon a video that had received a lot of attention.</p><br/><p>He did not know what it was about, but many people had felt that something was wrong after reading the headline.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe oranges that you eat have been soaked in poison.\u201d</p><br/><p>The video showed a bunch of farmers scrambling to soak oranges in a tub filled with white liquid.</p><br/><p>A woman was also narrating the video.</p><br/><p>\u201cLook, these oranges have been submerged in this liquid. You\u2019ve been eating poisonous oranges.\u201d</p><br/><p>The video continued to explain the situation.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan felt that something was wrong, and he quickly read the comments. Something bad was going to happen.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, that\u2019s crazy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, they\u2019re soaking the oranges in formaldehyde. It\u2019s so scary.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s poisonous! Aren\u2019t these orange sellers afraid that they will be struck by lightning?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin was still recommending us to buy oranges yesterday. It seems that Master Lin was scammed too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s horrifying. We can\u2019t buy them!\u201d</p><br/><p>Countless netizens commented on the video, and they believed what they saw after watching the video.</p><br/><p>After working for the entire day, Chen Xiao Dong had finally finished his preparations. He really wanted to thank Master Lin. However, his phone suddenly vibrated.</p><br/><p>It was a text.</p><br/><p>However, Chen Xiao Dong did not know what had happened.</p><br/><p>The texts were insulting and humiliating.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck you for selling us poisonous oranges.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou inhumane beast.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet them rot. Nobody is going to buy them.\u201d</p><br/><p>After reading the texts, Chen Xiao Dong felt like crying. He did not know what was happening.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Dong, come and have a look!\u201d Chen Shan shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cDad, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d Chen Xiao Dong hurried over. When his dad showed him the video, he was stunned.</p><br/><p>Then, he furiously exclaimed, \u201cHow could these people be so incorrigible? They\u2019re just spouting nonsense.\u201d</p><br/><p>The farmers had been worried about the sales of the oranges. After Lin Fan had helped them, they had regained some hope.</p><br/><p>However, when they saw the video, they wanted to cry. They did not know what to say.</p><br/><p>Those people that had bought their oranges yesterday called to scold them.</p><br/><p>At Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan said, \u201cBrother Lin, what is this about?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m not very sure.\u201d</p><br/><p>He did not know what the white liquid was. If they hadn\u2019t conducted any checks, he would not have known what it was.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian went over to take a look. \u201cAren\u2019t these preservatives?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou know what it is?\u201d Lin Fan was stunned at how knowledgeable Fraud Tian was.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian replied, \u201cOf course, I used to plant oranges in the past. It\u2019s normal and harmless. If not, the oranges would be rotten after shipping them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThese people are so stupid. They don\u2019t even know what they\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFraud Tian, are you sure?\u201d Lin Fan asked again.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian nodded. \u201cOf course, I used to do this in the past. What formaldehyde? They\u2019re idiots. Formaldehyde is toxic, and these people aren\u2019t even wearing masks.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan did a search on the Internet and realised what Fraud Tian said was true.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems like someone is trying to spread false rumours about this.\u201d</p><br/><p>He opened up Weibo and posted.</p><br/><p>\u201cRubbish. The people in the video are just applying preservatives to the oranges. The person who posted this false rumour deserves to be punished. What do you have against these orange farmers?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s normal to apply preservatives, and they are harmless. It\u2019s a procedure required for the transport of oranges. I will definitely call out all these people who are spreading false rumours.\u201d</p><br/><p>When the netizens saw the post, they were stunned.</p><br/><p>They had been fooled by these idiots.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

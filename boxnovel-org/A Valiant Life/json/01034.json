The two of them had checked out quite a few hotels which Lin Fan thought were all not bad but Bai Ke did not really approve of them.</p><br/><p>In the words of Bai Ke, it had to be of the highest level of luxury and modernism.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan thought about what he said and felt that it made sense. Thus, he gave Bai Ke full authority in choosing the hotel.</p><br/><p>At the Howard Johnson International Hotel.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was seated on the sofa and playing with his phone while Bai Ke was in discussion with the hotel\u2019s manager, trying to see how suitable the hotel\u2019s banquet room was.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan opened up his Weibo.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe day after tomorrow is going to be my father\u2019s 50th birthday. I hope for him to have a long, healthy and disease-free life.\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment he made that post, it drew a huge amount of comments on it.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell wishes to him as well!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWith Master Lin around, his father will surely be healthy. Living to one or two hundred years old will definitely not be a problem.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHappy 50th birthday to my father in law.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c^do you have no shame? He is clearly my father in law, why are you trying to say that he is yours?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe is my father in law. If you still want to continue bullsh*tting with me, I\u2019ll beat you to death.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI give in, I accept defeat.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was not only the netizens who were commenting. Even a few celebrities were sending their blessings as well. Given Lin Fan\u2019s current status, these celebrities were all taking notice of him. After all, none of them wanted to get into a dispute with him as it was definitely not something worth playing with.</p><br/><p>Against other people, maybe they would still have a chance to fight in an argument. However, Master Lin was someone not to be provoked.</p><br/><p>Shanghai.</p><br/><p>The Eastern Han Corporation.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang was just aimlessly scrolling through his Weibo when, suddenly, he saw his brother\u2019s post. When he saw it, he was fuming inside.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck, this b*stard didn\u2019t inform me about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>His fire didn\u2019t burn for long before his phone suddenly rang.</p><br/><p>\u201cMing Yang, Master Lin really isn\u2019t much of a brother. Such a big thing and yet he did not even bother to inform us about it. What do you think we should do?\u201d Wu Yun Gang, who was in Beijing, immediately started to rant the moment he answered the call.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang was panting with rage as he said, \u201cWhat else can we do? We have to go in for the kill. We have to let him know about the mistake that he has made and that, if he persists, our friendship will be broken.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Yun Gang replied, \u201cThat sounds good. I\u2019ve booked my plane ticket already.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang replied, \u201cWhat plane ticket? Just drive here. Get the grandest car that you can. This is my godfather\u2019s birthday we are talking about here. For him to not tell me about it just pi*ses me off so much.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlso, even though my brother may be very good at handling all sorts of things, can he handle this birthday party? I think not. It has to be as grand as it can possibly be.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Yun Gang was stunned. He replied, \u201cMing Yang, when did you become his godson?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA long time ago. You just didn\u2019t know about it,\u201d Wang Ming Yang said, \u201cI\u2019ll talk to you later, I have to get in touch with some other people. For them to be so close to my brother and yet not go for his father\u2019s birthday is completely unacceptable.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Yun Gang replied, \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll leave that to you. You better make it a blast. Do you want me to get a helicopter and parade a banner across the city sky?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYun Gang, I\u2019m not trying to flatter you but you are a genius. Such a beautiful idea and yet I didn\u2019t even think of that. How many helicopters do you have?\u201d Wang Ming Yang thought that it was a brilliant idea, so he rushed to ask him the question.</p><br/><p>\u201cOne.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good enough. I\u2019ll handle the rest of it. I\u2019ll just get in touch with a few of my friends. They are all into real estate and are super wealthy. I can just borrow a few helicopters from them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo many helicopters? Will it be too crowded?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRelax, it will definitely work. The pilots are all very experienced so there definitely won\u2019t be any problems at all.\u201d</p><br/><p>After putting down the phone, Wang Ming Yang immediately went to create a chat group.</p><br/><p>The name of the group was: \u2018Rush to Zhongzhou, we have things to settle\u2019.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang said: \u201cCome out for a moment, guys. It\u2019s my godfather\u2019s 50th birthday. If you guys can make it, send a \u20181\u2019.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c1\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c1\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The group of them all rushed to press the number 1 and at the same time, started furiously typing.</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t even know about that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin is really not a good friend. Such a huge thing and he did not even tell us about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLow-profile. Master Lin is really being too low-profile.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDirector Wang, what are we going to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang wrote down the idea and sent it to all of them. When the rest of them saw it, they could not help but nod their heads. This idea was really too good.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, that\u2019s what we are going to do. The day after tomorrow is his birthday so we need to move out tomorrow. No one is to tell him anything. We have to make this a surprise.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone replied: \u201cYour army is ready at your command.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGive me a moment, the boss of the Lu Corporation has called me. Let me see what he wants,\u201d Wang Ming Yang said.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Zhongzhou.</p><br/><p>Bai Ke felt very satisfied inside as he walked down and said, \u201cBrother Fan, this hotel is not bad. From what I\u2019ve seen, the ambiance is pretty good and the room is pretty big. I think that holding the party here will definitely not be a problem.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cOkay. I trust your opinion. Now, we just need to check out what kind of drinks to get as well as the gift box.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Ke nodded and said, \u201cLet\u2019s go. I have acquaintances who can help us out with this so getting a good price will not be a problem. The authenticity of the wine will also not be an issue. Oh yes, what will your budget for the wine be?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan thought about it for a moment before replying, \u201cJust the normal banquet ones will be fine. About three to four hundred dollars a bottle.\u201d</p><br/><p>Afterward, they handed over the deposit for booking the hotel. Then, they went to take a look at the menu. The food here was priced at 2888 dollars per table. To Lin Fan, many of the people who were coming were going to be from different cities that were very far away. Thus, he could not just give them any simple meal before letting them leave. It had to be as sumptuous as possible.</p><br/><p>Also, Bai Ke offered to personally cook a few dishes for them as well.</p><br/><p>Although the quality of the food that Bai Ke made was still pretty low in compared to his own, it was still some of the finest gourmet food.</p><br/><p>Perhaps the entire group of them might feel that the best dishes of the night were Bai Ke\u2019s.</p><br/><p>They were hard at work all the way until nighttime before they got their things done.</p><br/><p>At the same time, they had prepared the firecrackers as well as all the other small stuff. Now, they were just waiting for the day to arrive.</p><br/><p>The next day!</p><br/><p>Quite a few of his relatives, who lived pretty far away, had arrived. Lin Fan saw it as his own personal responsibility to welcome them.</p><br/><p>However, luckily for him, Bai Ke was there to help him as well. If not, booking all the lodgings for them would have been a massive headache.</p><br/><p>Also, with regards to some of his relatives, it was not that Lin Fan did not recognize them or had forgotten them, it was simply that he had never even known them at all. If not for his mother being there by his side, it would have been very awkward for them.</p><br/><p>There were many uncles, aunts and all sorts of other relatives there.</p><br/><p>At the same time, another thing that made Lin Fan extremely awkward was that all of these relatives knew that he did not have a girlfriend yet. Thus, one by one, they all stepped up to him and started introducing ladies to him, leaving him completely speechless.</p><br/><p>Haojiang!</p><br/><p>\u201cI must say, Xue Yao, what are you doing? Who are you buying a gift for?\u201d a beautiful lady who was standing next to Yun Xue Yao suspiciously asked.</p><br/><p>Yun Xue Yao laughed and said, \u201cI\u2019m not going to tell you. Anyway, quickly come here and help me to decide which one of these jades is nicer. I have to quickly make this purchase and then rush off to the airport.\u201d</p><br/><p>Her sister looked at the price and then looked at Yun Xue Yao and said, \u201cThis gift must be for someone pretty special.\u201d</p><br/><p>The price of the jade was about 5 million dollars. It was truly shocking. However, whether it was to her sister or Yun Xue Yao, it was a price that was pretty easy to handle.</p><br/><p>Still, this was the first time that she had seen Yun Xue Yao buy such an expensive item.</p><br/><p>On a certain expressway.</p><br/><p>A young man begrudgingly said, \u201cDad, what are we going to Zhongzhou for? He was your secondary school classmate and he is just some normal guy. Do we really have to travel all the way there?\u201d</p><br/><p>The middle-aged man seated next to him shot him a glare and replied, \u201cIt\u2019s called nostalgia, do you understand? We haven\u2019t seen each other for so many years so it\u2019s good to meet up and reminisce the old times.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, if your classmate were to find out about your current social status, he would definitely try and build relations with you again. Did you forget about what happened during your college reunion?\u201d the young man said as he recalled what had happened in the past and had a look of disdain on his face.</p><br/><p>His father had been featured on finance and economics programmes many times. If his classmates were to realize this, they would definitely start to contact him again and try to build relations with him.</p></div>\n</div>"}

It wasn't rare to see people spread over the bonnets of cars in car accidents, but spreading himself on the bonnet of the car to ask the driver to become his master- that was a rare sight, especially with Han Lu's stoic determination. The people around felt sorry for President Lin.</p><br/><p>\"Are you going to get off the front of my car or not?\" Lin Fan asked, with a tinge of disbelief in his voice.</p><br/><p>\"Master, I beg you to take me as your disciple. If you don't agree to this, I won't ever come down,\" Han Lu said stubbornly.</p><br/><p>Oh my gosh!</p><br/><p>How stubborn!</p><br/><p>The association members stood around, whispering amongst themselves.</p><br/><p>\"How shameless can this guy get? President Lin has already said that he isn't going to take any disciples but this guy still won't take a no for an answer.\"</p><br/><p>\"I feel that President Lin should just say yes just to get this annoying guy off his back.\"</p><br/><p>\"What the heck? If I was President Lin, I would just start my car and go off even if he's on the front of the car.\"</p><br/><p>\"Stop talking so much bullsh*t. If you really did that, you'd be sent to jail.\"</p><br/><p>\"Yeah...\"</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>Lin Fan sighed as he got out of his car. He had to settle this issue properly, but when he saw the view of Han Lu sprawled over the front of his car, he immediately laughed out loud.</p><br/><p>Han Lu laughed when he saw Master Lin laugh as if Master Lin had accepted his request to be his disciple.</p><br/><p>\"Don't move. Don't destroy my car plate,\" Lin Fan said urgently.</p><br/><p>Han Lu looked down to see that both his legs were on the car plate. He looked up at Lin Fan. \"Master Lin, I won't destroy it.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved him away. \"Come down first.\"</p><br/><p>\"If you don't agree with me, I won't come down,\" Han Lu said as he shook his head. He wasn't going to stop until he succeeded. Requesting to be someone's disciple was a rigorous task that was seldom completed in one try, especially with this kind of master. He could not pass up this opportunity. Even if he was beaten to death, he would not waver.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan thought, This guy is exceptionally shameless. If I had known what this was about, I wouldn't have come.</p><br/><p>\"You're someone with fame. Aren't you concerned that you'll lose face because of this? If your fans heard about this, it'll be a disaster. I think you better come down and continue on the path that you have been taking.\" If it was the past, such a sincere disciple would definitely be accepted by his master. Now, having a disciple was just another burden.</p><br/><p>And this brat wasn't reliable at all. If Han Lu caused trouble outside, it would also drag his name down into the mud as well.</p><br/><p>Han Lu shook his head. \"Master Lin, please take me as your disciple. I'm not scared of losing my face or my fans. I just want to learn real Chinese martial arts.\"</p><br/><p>He was a practitioner of MMA and he had thought that he was the best in terms of skill and strength until he met Master Lin who completely wrecked him. That incident had let him remember the initial love he had for Chinese martial arts when he was young. So he decided that he wanted Master Lin as his master no matter the cost.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan thought for a while before chuckling, \"Why don't you come down from my car and we can discuss this.\"</p><br/><p>Han Lu was stunned for a moment. \"If I come down, will you accept me as your disciple?\" he said meekly.</p><br/><p>One just had to be persistent in requesting to be someone's disciple.</p><br/><p>\"Come down first. If you don't come down, you won't have any hope of becoming my disciple. Just come down first and we can talk about this,\" Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>Han Lu slowly got down from the car after he realized that his position was completely uncivilized. He carefully avoided the car plate to prevent it from getting destroyed.</p><br/><p>Han Lu excitedly stood in front of Lin Fan, eyes looking expectantly and his face beaming radially. Lin Fan looked at him. His face looked excited and sincere, but it was better to talk it out.</p><br/><p>\"You need to know that my standards for my disciples are very high,\" Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>Han Lu nodded vigorously. \"I know. With a master like you, it is expected that your disciples are of the highest standards as well.\"</p><br/><p>\"I won't just accept anyone normally, but I guess I could give you a chance,\" Lin Fan continued.</p><br/><p>\"Ah!\" Han Lu responded with excitement. \"Master, no matter what, be it climbing the highest mountain or cleaning the deepest oil pot, I won't even bat an eyelid.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled, \"You don't have to be this extreme. You see this running track here? Run one round within three minutes and then we'll talk again.\"</p><br/><p>Han Lu gulped as he looked at the track in front of him, heart pounding in anticipation. Three minutes was dangerous, but...</p><br/><p>For the sake of having Master Lin as his master, even a no had to be a yes. \"Master, what will happen after I finish it within three minutes?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan furrowed his brows. \"You're still in the process of wanting to become my disciple and you're already doubting me? I guess you're not worthy after all.\"</p><br/><p>Han Lu started becoming anxious when he saw Master Lin become a little angry. \"Master, I'm not doubting you. I'll run the round now.\" Han Lu replied hurriedly.\"</p><br/><p>\"Mmm, hurry,\" Lin Fan said as he took out his phone, \"I'll be keeping track of the time. If you don't make it in three minutes, we have nothing more to talk about.\"</p><br/><p>Han Lu didn't hesitate, immediately rushing toward as if his legs were on fire, running as fast as the wind. Everyone standing around was surprised.</p><br/><p>\"Not bad, keep on going!\" Lin Fan cheered him on.</p><br/><p>Han Lu became even more motivated after hearing Master Lin cheer him on and he turned his head to make sure that Master Lin was still there. When he saw that Master Lin was clapping for him, he became surer of himself, lowering his head and going full steam ahead.</p><br/><p>Jiang Fei looked at Lin Fan in surprise. \"You're really going to accept him as your disciple?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at Jiang Fei before opening his car door. \"How is that even possible? I've got so many other things to do and absolutely no time for other things. Alright, I'll take my leave first. Tell him when he comes back, my standards are very high.\"</p><br/><p>Jiang Fei looked at Lin Fan helplessly. President Lin's tactic of getting him to run a lap was admittedly effective.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan stepped on his accelerator and drove off.</p><br/><p>\"President Lin has plenty of tricks up his sleeve, it looks like this brat didn't even stand a chance at all.\"</p><br/><p>\"There is no use in running fast. President Lin has real talent and skill and he won't just accept anyone as his disciple.\"</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>Han Lu kept track of his timing precisely. With this much pressure on him, he had broken his physical limits and completed the lap under three minutes, fulfilling Master Lin's requirements.</p><br/><p>\"Master Lin...\" Han Lu rushed over, both his hands resting on his thighs as he panted for air. He looked up and in that instant, he was stunned.</p><br/><p>\"Where is Master Lin!?\" Han Lu shook Jiang Fei's body, asking him.</p><br/><p>Jiang Fei cleared his throat. \"Master Lin had something urgent to tend to. He said that he believed that you could complete the lap in three minutes, but his standards for his disciples are really high and this is the first step. There's still a second stage and a third stage which haven't begun yet.\"</p><br/><p>Han Lu had initially been disappointed, but his expression changed at that moment, looking more positive. \"No matter how hard it is, I believe that I can succeed. Did Master Lin give any more instructions?\"</p><br/><p>Looking at his expectant expression, Jiang Fei was at loss for words. He really wanted to tell him the truth, that Master Lin was just playing with him and not to waste his time, but then, he had an idea.</p><br/><p>\"Master Lin is someone with a huge heart. I heard that the children's welfare institute doesn't have a lot of volunteers. You should go there to train your empathy.\"</p><br/><p>\"Were those Master Lin's instructions?\" Han Lu asked him urgently.</p><br/><p>Jiang Fei furrowed his brows. \"He didn't give those instructions, but do you have the patience to do this?\"</p><br/><p>\"Of course I do. I'll go now,\" Han Lu replied.</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>\"Elder Jiang, that doesn't sound like what Master Lin said.\"</p><br/><p>Jiang Fei shrugged his shoulders. \"It can't be helped. From what I can tell, this guy is hell-bent on making Master Lin his master, so I might as well get him to do something meaningful.\"</p><br/><p>The people who were standing around nodded in agreement. \"That makes sense...\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

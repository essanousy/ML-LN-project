He hadn\u2019t expected his brother to splash water on the opposite party\u2019s face without hesitation.</p><br/><p>The opposite party was the young master of Huaizhou\u2019s Chu Family, the future inheritor of a huge business empire.</p><br/><p>Even though Wang Ming Yang had become very reputable in Shanghai, it was difficult for him to go against this person.</p><br/><p>Initially, when this person had come, Wang Ming Yang hadn\u2019t known how to resolve this. As for submitting to the opposition, he definitely wouldn\u2019t do it. Even if he were to lose his whole fortune and become bankrupt, he would never submit to anyone.</p><br/><p>\u201cMing Yang,\u201d Lin Fan spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d Wang Ming Yang looked at Lin Fan, wondering what his brother had to say.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have to say this. He brought a few people into your territory and you let him bully you? In the future, when you come across such situations, there\u2019s no need to think twice. Just teach him a lesson first before you do anything else. If anything happens, you still have me, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shook his head helplessly. This brother of his had gotten nervous so easily. The opposition had come into his brother\u2019s territory but his brother was actually a little frightened. That wasn\u2019t his style at all.</p><br/><p>Chu Shen stood rooted to the ground as if he was dumbfounded. It seemed as if he couldn\u2019t believe that this guy would dare to do such a thing to him.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, you\u2019ve gone overboard.\u201d</p><br/><p>He growled in a deep tone. A flame had burned up in his heart. He had a kind of indescribable fury in him. As Huaizhou\u2019s Chu Family\u2019s young master, he was a business emperor in Huaizhou. Who knew how many people\u2019s lives revolved around him?</p><br/><p>Even some leaders would be extremely respectful towards him.</p><br/><p>Because one word from him could affect these leaders\u2019 careers.</p><br/><p>No matter where he was, he would be treated as a high and mighty being.</p><br/><p>\u201cOverboard? You must be joking with me,\u201d said Lin Fan with a laugh. He would never care about anyone\u2019s status. He wasn\u2019t bothered at all by how capable this person was.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang had wanted to tell his brother about this guy\u2019s background and identity. However, he felt that he would make his brother lose face if he were to say it, so he resisted the urge.</p><br/><p>Also, he was prepared. If some kind of big problem were to arise out of this, he would bear the responsibility together with his brother.</p><br/><p>The bodyguards behind Chu Shen looked at Lin Fan. If it had been an average person, they would\u2019ve made a move on him long ago. But now, they didn\u2019t dare to do anything at all because the person standing in front of them was a publicly recognized master in the martial arts world.</p><br/><p>This Master Lin had even been called the chief of the martial arts circles at the exchange meet at Kunlun Mountain.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at Chu Shen\u2019s enraged expression and couldn\u2019t help but laugh. \u201cTell me. Why were you looking for my brother?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Shen wiped the water from his face. He didn\u2019t divert his gaze at all as he stared straight at Lin Fan. His expression gave off a sense that he was not giving in.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, you really are amazing. Are you not going to give me any face at all?\u201d</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t answer Lin Fan\u2019s question as he spoke in a cold tone.</p><br/><p>He knew that this Master Lin was quite capable. Although he had no money and authority, he had a great influence on the Internet and on the society.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean by \u2018face\u2019?\u201d Lin Fan asked curiously. Then, he looked at Wang Ming Yang. \u201cMing Yang, he says that I should give him face. What do you think this \u2018face\u2019 means?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang looked at Lin Fan as his heart started thumping. His brother was going all the way this time. However, to him, this felt f*cking great.</p><br/><p>This Chu Shen was a big shot who had come here and acted impudently. Wang Ming Yang had actually been suppressed by the opposition and hadn\u2019t known what to do. However, his brother had come and put the opposition back in his place.</p><br/><p><em>Awesome. This feels way too awesome.</em></p><br/><p><em>But this feels a bit like I\u2019m bullying others using my relationship with my brother. Cheh! What am I thinking? That\u2019s not it. It\u2019s just that my brother is f*cking awesome and I\u2019m basking in some of his light.</em></p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. How much does this \u2018face\u2019 cost? Give me one of those,\u201d said Wang Ming Yang with a chuckle. He looked at Chu Shen proudly as if to say \u2018Come at me. If you dare, come at me. With my brother here, I\u2019m not afraid of you.\u2019</p><br/><p>To Chu Shen, this proud expression was really infuriating.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou guys\u2026\u201d Chu Shen clenched his teeth furiously. His eyes seemed like they were emitting flames. \u201cMaster Lin, you\u2019ve gone overboard. Do you really think you can act lawlessly as long as you\u2019re in Shanghai?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. You\u2019re right. I can act lawlessly in Shanghai and you can\u2019t do anything about it,\u201d Lin Fan spread his arms open and said in a helpless tone.</p><br/><p>When Chu Shen looked at Master Lin, he had an urge to viciously beat Master Lin up but he resisted it.</p><br/><p>He wanted to reason with Master Lin right now but Master Lin was playing around with him.</p><br/><p>The situation had suddenly changed.</p><br/><p>He could play around with Wang Ming Yang as he liked.</p><br/><p>But as for this Master Lin, he felt helpless. It was as if he had no idea where to even start.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, you run a shop along Cloud Street. You\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Before he could finish, Lin Fan interrupted.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it? Are you going to buy the whole of Cloud Street and chase me away? Go ahead. If you have the money, please buy it, boss. I don\u2019t mind. But I wouldn\u2019t be able to guarantee that you would be able to buy it,\u201d said Lin Fan with a slightly regretful tone.</p><br/><p>Chu Shen\u2019s face turned completely red. Just as he wanted to say something more, one of the bodyguards behind him leaned over and whispered.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis Master Lin is not simple. He\u2019s very strong. We can\u2019t win against him in a fight. Chief, let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing that, Chu Shen became even more furious.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot simple? Do you think he dares to hit me?\u201d</p><br/><p>*Slap*</p><br/><p>Just as those words were said, a crisp slapping sound rang out.</p><br/><p>At that instant, the scene turned completely silent.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang\u2019s eyes gaped wide open as he stared blankly at Lin Fan. He hadn\u2019t expected his brother to really make a move.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, those bodyguards were stunned as well. They stood rooted to the ground and didn\u2019t know what to do. Their boss had just been hit.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan flicked his hand. \u201cWhat a cheap person. Why did you have to challenge me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Chu Shen turned his head around and glared at Lin Fan with a maniacal look. \u201cYou actually dare to hit me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t I dare? Ming Yang, why is he here?\u201d Lin Fan looked at Wang Ming Yang and asked.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang was still in shock. \u201cHe came to see if I dare to beat him until he looks like a pig.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded. \u201cThat means he came to ask for a beating. And now he\u2019s asking me if I dare to hit him?\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, Lin Fan went forward, extended his hand and patted Chu Shen\u2019s cheek. \u201cKid, let me tell you this. Ming Yang is my brother. If you bully him, you\u2019re bullying me. Anyone he wants to beat up is someone I want to beat up. You asked him if he dares to beat you until you look like a pig. I\u2019m telling you now that he dares. And he\u2019s not the only one that dares. I dare too. So, is there still anything you\u2019re unhappy about?\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

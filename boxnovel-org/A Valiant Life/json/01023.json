When this piece of news came out, everyone was shocked.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn! Is this for real? I was just enjoying my day. When did such a big thing happen?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAccording to the news, a broadcaster revealed it. The influenza started from a small town.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI saw it. The scene has been sealed off and no one is allowed to enter or leave. It seems rather severe.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you guys see the trending news on WeChat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat news?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGo and see for yourself. It\u2019s already being spread on WeChat.\u201d</p><br/><p>Many netizens were curious upon seeing these comments. They had no idea what kind of news was spreading on WeChat. Wasn\u2019t it just an influenza spreading in some small town?</p><br/><p>Wasn\u2019t that something that everyone already knew? Could it be that there was something that they did not know?</p><br/><p>Many people opened WeChat and suddenly realized a terrifying thing. How long had this news been out?</p><br/><p>The earliest it could have been released was that morning. However, they hadn\u2019t expected someone to say on WeChat how horrifying this influenza was and the only way they could guard against it was by eating honeysuckle.</p><br/><p>It was a very simple video. It described the terrors of this influenza. The news revealed that, although the small town had been sealed off, someone from the town had already appeared in another city. Later on, it was the person in the other city who had been discovered, which led to this influenza\u2019s terror being exposed. The various images made the viewers\u2019 hearts feel all jittery. At the end, the video emphasized the effectiveness of several Chine medications, including the godly medicinal herb, blue mountain root, which everyone knew about.</p><br/><p>In a short time, the Internet had gone mad.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnother new influenza has appeared. Now, the only way we can guard against it is by drinking these medications. I have to buy some for my family to drink.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m still at work. Once I saw this piece of news, I immediately told my family to go and buy some from the pharmacy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cScary. I\u2019m on a train now. The person next to me keeps coughing. It can\u2019t be this influenza, can it? I have to move further away.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ma Jia Jun was just a small broadcaster. When he woke up, he went to see the news. Upon seeing this earth-shattering news, he was dumbfounded. He hadn\u2019t expected his own broadcast from yesterday to have been leaked out by others.</p><br/><p>Moreover, his broadcast room was being publicly announced.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve become famous?\u201d</p><br/><p>The first thing he thought about was not the impact of what he had filmed, instead, he saw that his broadcast room had been published in the news article and he thought about the amount of traffic it would bring to his broadcast room.</p><br/><p>He was exhilarated.</p><br/><p>He immediately opened his broadcast room. When he saw the number of people waiting inside, he was astounded.</p><br/><p>180,000. Before he even started the live broadcast, there were already 180,000 people waiting in his broadcast room. There were even many people chatting on the channel.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen will the host come? I want to see what\u2019s going on in the small town.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMe too. I\u2019m getting really impatient.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHost, when the f*ck are you going to appear? If you start the broadcast now, I\u2019ll immediately send you an airplane.\u201d</p><br/><p>The comments kept coming. Ma Jia Jun felt his breathing start to quicken.</p><br/><p><em>I\u2019m famous.</em></p><br/><p><em>I\u2019m really famous.</em></p><br/><p>In the past, he had always broadcasted because he had wanted to be famous. But because the contents of his broadcast had been too boring, not many people watched at all. For there to be so many people watching now, it was like a dream come true.</p><br/><p>Without hesitation, he started broadcasting.</p><br/><p>The netizens who had been chatting in the comments realized that the host had gone online and they were thrilled.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, the host is online.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m a man of my word. Here\u2019s an airplane.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSending gifts over.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ma Jia Jun resisted the emotions in his heart. \u201cI\u2019m here, my brothers. Thank you, boss, for the airplane. Thank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEnough rubbish, host. Hurry up and bring us to Huang Yun Town to take a look.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. As long as you bring us to see Huang Yun Town, we\u2019ll send you plenty of gifts.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ma Jia Jun wasn\u2019t an idiot. Naturally, he knew why he had gained his current popularity. These people weren\u2019t here to see him, they were here to see Huang Yun Town. If he didn\u2019t give them what they wanted, they might just disperse all at once.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll go right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Without any hesitation, he dressed up and rode his electric bike towards Huang Yun Town. It wasn\u2019t too far but it still required half an hour.</p><br/><p>He lived in the county. To get to Huang Yun Town, he had to take a small road.</p><br/><p>On the expressway.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was cursing in his heart. His car tire had burst. And it had burst all of a sudden.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, what do we do now?\u201d Zhao Ming Qing hadn\u2019t expected this either. But they had already been in the car for a day. He felt that his teacher had to be tired. He wanted to let his teacher have a good rest.</p><br/><p>But his teacher looked very relaxed. This left him a little speechless.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at him and said, \u201cMing Qing, you\u2019ll be in the car, controlling the steering wheel. I\u2019ll push from behind. There\u2019s a service center up in front. We\u2019ll go there to fix the car.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, you can push this?\u201d Zhao Ming Qing was startled, so he asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. Just hurry up and go. Don\u2019t speak so much rubbish,\u201d said Lin Fan impatiently. If he couldn\u2019t even push this car, he would have wasted all his efforts. If he hadn\u2019t been worried about his disciple or about the impact it would cause, he would have lifted the whole car up and ran. He wouldn\u2019t go through all the trouble of slowly pushing the car.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing didn\u2019t ask more. He went into the car obediently and grasped the steering wheel. \u201cTeacher, I\u2019m ready.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan pushed from the back. He didn\u2019t dare to go too fast. He just went at an appropriate speed.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing, who was sitting in the car, was astonished. <em>Teacher\u2019s strength is too great!</em></p><br/><p>But he felt that they had been rather unlucky this time, for the car tire to have burst. Luckily, his teacher was amazing enough to move the car using brute strength. Otherwise, they would\u2019ve stopped in the middle of the road. It would\u2019ve been embarrassing and, not to mention, dangerous.</p><br/><p>Huang Yun Town!</p><br/><p>Ma Jia Jun sneakily aimed his camera at the town. \u201cSee? This is Huang Yun Town. Now, even the front has been sealed off and I can\u2019t go near.\u201d</p><br/><p>When the netizens in the broadcast room saw this, they were stunned.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn. It has really been sealed tight.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHost, go a little closer. I\u2019ll give you a reward. Right now, we can\u2019t even see anything.\u201d</p><br/><p>In the broadcast room, some people started directing him.</p><br/><p>Under the temptation of the rewards, Ma Jia Jun didn\u2019t hesitate for long. He decided to risk it all for the gifts.</p><br/><p>At that moment, at the entrance of Huang Yun Town, a large group of sanitation workers was sterilizing the area. At the same time, there were people in protective uniforms walking towards the town. No matter what, they had to get the situation under control.</p><br/><p>And the situation was almost under control now. At least everything was good. With everyone\u2019s combined efforts, the order had been maintained.</p><br/><p>However, the Mayor of Huang Yun Town had also fallen sick unexpectedly.</p><br/><p>To those people who were sealing off the place, they felt that Huang Yun Town\u2019s Mayor was a pretty good person. It was a shame that he hadn\u2019t been able to resist the virus.</p><br/><p>Also, their moods were grave. This influenza was quite powerful and it was very infectious. It was not to be looked down upon.</p></div>\n</div>"}

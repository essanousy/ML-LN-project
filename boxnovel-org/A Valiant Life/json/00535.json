He liked to dress fancily and had no respect for anyone. At times, he would criticize the work of others, sometimes calling them worthless, causing them to be completely red with anger.</p><br/><p>However, not only was he extremely good an artist, he was also adored by many of the teachers. Some say that Headmaster Hong was prepared to take him in as a student. After which, he would be a high-flyer, with a smooth-sailing career ahead of him. He was going to be on a different level from the others.</p><br/><p>As for Headmaster Hong, they were filled with respect for him. He is a high ranking member of the Chinese Art Association and had once auctioned one of his paintings for more than 1.2 million dollars.</p><br/><p>To be taken under him as his disciple was something the students could only dream about.</p><br/><p>Zhang Minghao put down his brush and opened WeChat. He grinned. He didn\u2019t expect that his opinions would have gathered this much attention. It felt good. Yet he decided that he should show off for awhile.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you all take part in the One Dollar Art sale?\u201d Zhang Minghao asked.</p><br/><p>The girl beside him replied, \u201cI took part in it. I bought a piece.\u201d</p><br/><p>The others nodded their heads, \u201cWe\u2019ve all bought it. What\u2019s up?</p><br/><p>Zhang Minghao laughed, \u201cI wanted to tell you all that you all have been deceived. This One Dollar Art sale was out to scam you all. If you take a closer look at the paintings, some of the strokes used in the painting are strokes even I don\u2019t know. How would some little children know of them?\u201d</p><br/><p>Some retorted, \u201cJust because you don\u2019t know them, doesn\u2019t mean that others won\u2019t know them!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Minghao couldn\u2019t help but laugh, \u201cDo you guys know the strokes?\u201d</p><br/><p>The public only knows how to buy these paintings. Why would they bother themselves with the technicalities of the painting?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou say that this is to scam people but what proof do you have to show that? What if it\u2019s real?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Haoming laughed out loud, \u201cI trust my own eyes. Have you all seen my opinions on WeChat? It\u2019s been really popular. There have already been so many people trusting me. I didn\u2019t think that you professional students wouldn\u2019t be able to understand my viewpoint. What a pity.\u201d</p><br/><p>One of the students took a look, then exclaimed in astonishment, \u201cYou were to one who sent out that discussion?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Minghao stood proud, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with it? I wrote it well, didn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow can you still be proud of yourself. You don\u2019t even have the proof to show that this is all fake. Do you know how much misunderstanding your discussion can bring about?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck! So it was actually you who sent it! God knows what you were thinking. Where\u2019s your proof?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is a charity event. It\u2019s to do good! How can you be so heartless?\u201d</p><br/><p>The girl who was standing beside Zhang Minghao retorted, \u201cWhat are you guys doing? What has Brother Hao done wrong? Does he not have the right to post on his on WeChat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs this even open for debate? His claim was born out of nothing, and has caused much negative discussion!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Minghao shook his head, \u201cI\u2019m too lazy to continue this pointless argument with you all. I\u2019ll be learning the National Essence from Headmaster Hong from next month onwards. You guys can stay here and slowly catch up.\u201d</p><br/><p>Having said that, no one else had any else to retort with. That was what they were most jealous of. The only thing was that they couldn\u2019t figure out why Headmaster Hong looks up to that b*stard Zhang Minghao so much. He was too full of himself and had no respect for anyone.</p><br/><p>*Ding dong*</p><br/><p>Right at that moment, the school announcement bell rang.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood afternoon students, this is your Headmaster Hong speaking. I have an announcement to make.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone was stunned when they heard the bell. They didn\u2019t know what was going on. In their memory, Headmaster Hong had never made an announcement before.</p><br/><p>\u201cChinese Art student Zhang Minghao, I want you to immediately remove your false discussion on WeChat. The One Dollar Art sale is a charity event. Despite being a student at the Art Institute and having undergone higher education, you still have the nerve to put infuriating information online without evidence. This is utterly disappointing. At the same time, I\u2019m taking back my decision to take you as my student. You are on your own.\u201d</p><br/><p>The announcement ended.</p><br/><p>In an instant, everyone was silent.</p><br/><p>And then, there was an uproar.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck! What\u2019s the situation now? What did Headmaster Hong mean?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou still have to think about it? Headmaster Hong found out about the discussion Zhang Minghao posted and was enraged. Without showing mercy, he made a public announcement to the school. Now, the entire school knows what happened.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, what great news! He was happy too soon and now his retribution is here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe One Dollar Art sale is a charity event. Only someone so heartless would be able to think of such things.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Minghao stood rooted to the ground, and he completely had no reaction.</p><br/><p>What just happened?</p><br/><p>He just got criticized by Headmaster Hong.</p><br/><p>And at the same time, his decision to take him in as a student was reverted.</p><br/><p>How can this be?</p><br/><p>The girl originally beside him was suddenly far away from him. It was as if she was scared that she herself would get into trouble.</p><br/><p>Zhang Minghao hurriedly took out his phone and deleted the discussion. He then ran towards the door, shouting, \u201cHeadmaster Hong, listen to me\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>In the classroom.</p><br/><p>The group of students started laughing, \u201cHaha, he brought this upon himself.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>In the Detention House.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan gave Headmaster Hong a call. What was he thinking? Taking such a person as his disciple, it was disgusting.\u201d</p><br/><p>After which he opened WeiBo. It was impossible for him not set things straight.</p><br/><p>\u201cNanshan Children\u2019s Welfare Institute has been taken over by me. The children are in desperate need of education, and because of the shortage of funds, we have initiated a One Dollar Art sale. As for the claim that the paintings were painted on behalf of the children, I want to say that, the children here are not handicapped. As a member of the Chinese Art Association, I have taught these children Chinese Art and National Essence. If you yourself are not learned in this art, then you should not doubt these children. If you all dare to speak up to me, I would make sure you are unable to live your life. I shall say no more since I have spoken a bit too violently. I urge you all to appreciate the art of these children and donate. Your dollar would mean a lot to the children. Thank you, everybody.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan felt good about what he had just written.</p><br/><p>Originally, he planned to be a bit friendlier. But he couldn\u2019t control his anger while typing the content and let his thoughts run. However, since he had already written it, he didn\u2019t want to edit it, so he decided to just post it online.</p><br/><p>The netizens were stunned when they read about this situation.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn, the imprisoned Lin Fan is on WeiBo.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSh*t! This event was actually hosted by Master Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck, I didn\u2019t know that it was Master Lin who hosted it. If we knew beforehand, then only a fool would believe what they read online. Say no more, I\u2019m going to buy the paintings.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCurse his whole family for starting this rumor.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow come I didn\u2019t know of Master Lin taking over Nanshan\u2019s Children Welfare Institute.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt must be because you are dumb. This is no secret. Many people knew of it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSh*t! Why didn\u2019t you all say so earlier?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t ask.\u201d</p><br/><p>He had mentioned that he would be taking over Nanshan\u2019s Children Welfare Institute before. Yet not many people followed this piece of news. But today, everyone will know.</p><br/><p>At this moment, the popular forums started bringing in the latest news.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe One Dollar Art sale was hosted by Master Lin. Whoever has doubts about it is an idiot.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have no hesitation in supporting Master Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn, to think that I almost believed someone else\u2019s rumors.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to buy ten paintings today.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>In the meanwhile, Lin Fan didn\u2019t know the actual situation and what was going on. But he had already done all that he could.</p><br/><p>Who knows how much he would raise at the end?</p><br/><p>If he raised more than enough, he had already thought of a way to settle the problem.</p></div>\n</div>"}

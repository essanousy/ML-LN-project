Secretary Wang called to say that he had handled the matter and Lin Fan had to go and settle some procedures. Also, he had to bring Director Huang of the welfare institute along for some of the procedures as well.</p><br/><p>Although it was a little troublesome, it was already very awesome for Secretary Wang to have helped him so much.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan dropped by the welfare institute and talked to Director Huang for a bit before they both headed towards the location.</p><br/><p>Director Huang hadn\u2019t known what was going on at first. When she heard about what was happening, she was elated. After all, this was government support for their welfare institute.</p><br/><p>When they reached the venue, Secretary Wang was already waiting.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin.\u201d Secretary Wang immediately went forward with a face full of smiles upon seeing the car. To others, he might have put on the attitude of a leader, but to Master Lin, he was very warm and polite.</p><br/><p>Although Master Lin didn\u2019t have much authority over him, Master Lin had a kind of influence that he couldn\u2019t match up to.</p><br/><p>\u201cSecretary Wang, we\u2019ve troubled you,\u201d said Lin Fan with a smile.</p><br/><p>When Secretary Wang heard that, he waved his hand hurriedly. \u201cIt was no trouble. The one who has really been troubled is our Secretary Chen. Yesterday, the debate during the meeting was non-stop. In the end, Secretary Chen had to make the final call by himself to decide to handle things this way.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although he didn\u2019t elaborate much, Lin Fan could sense that the meeting had probably not been simple at all.</p><br/><p>After all, the implicated departments were many. With that decision, a large amount of taxes was thrown away. Hence, it would have been very normal for people to protest.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt looks like I\u2019ll have to give Secretary Chen a proper thanks later on,\u201d said Lin Fan, smiling.</p><br/><p>Secretary Wang chuckled as he brought the two of them into the building. Then, he knocked on the conference room door.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome in,\u201d said a voice from inside the conference room.</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan entered, he realized that there were quite a number of people inside. Besides Secretary Chen, there were other leaders as well. But Lin Fan had a feeling that these other leaders were not too happy. Still, because of Secretary Chen\u2019s presence, they didn\u2019t dare to act out rashly.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, this matter has already been handled. The meeting discussions were successful as well. What\u2019s left is to sign the agreement,\u201d said Secretary Chen.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said with a smile, \u201cThank you, Secretary Chen. If it wasn\u2019t for Secretary Chen\u2019s help, I\u2019m afraid this matter would have been really challenging.\u201d</p><br/><p>Secretary Chen chuckled. In reality, he was thinking that even if he hadn\u2019t helped in this matter, Master Lin still had a large network of relations and many other people would have been willing to help. For example, even that number one leader of Shanghai might have personally helped him.</p><br/><p>But Master Lin hadn\u2019t looked for that leader but looked for him instead.</p><br/><p>Director Huang took out all of the welfare institute\u2019s documents. There were also photocopies of these documents.</p><br/><p>There was a document that had been stamped as well as the agreement contract.</p><br/><p>Then, Lin Fan took the contract and took a look. There were basically no problems. Although he trusted Secretary Chen very much, he still looked at whatever he should look at. In the end, after verifying it, he signed it.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shook hands with each of the leaders present. Some leaders sighed. Now that the contract had been signed, there was nothing else they could say.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, this time, we\u2019ve made an unprecedented exception,\u201d a leader said with a sigh as he shook Lin Fan\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. \u201cThank you, everyone, for the help.\u201d</p><br/><p>After everything had been completed, Lin Fan exchanged some words of courtesy with everyone before leaving with a satisfied heart.</p><br/><p>However, the government\u2019s official website would report this matter as well. After all, it was a good deed.</p><br/><p>Cloud Street!</p><br/><p>Lin Fan walked into the shop with all smiles.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian looked at Lin Fan. \u201cWhat\u2019s up? What happened to make you so happy? The situation on the Internet hasn\u2019t even been resolved but you can still smile.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved the document in his hand. \u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t I be able to smile? With this document in my hand, why shouldn\u2019t I smile?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet me see.\u201d Fraud Tian stuck out his hand and wanted to take the document but all he caught was air.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shook his head. \u201cI can\u2019t allow that. Don\u2019t think that this is just a document. This document\u2019s value is sky-high. It\u2019s worth over 100 million.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian didn\u2019t believe it. \u201cYou\u2019re bullsh*ting. How can one document be worth that much?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan grinned. \u201cI asked a leader to help me with the Nanshan Children\u2019s Welfare Institute situation yesterday. With this document, we\u2019ve been exempted from all taxes. This saves us a great deal of money.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd I have to take a photo of this document first to post it on Weibo.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan took out his phone and opened the file to take a photo. Then, he posted it on Weibo.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t type a single word but just placed a smiley face. He decided to let the netizens guess the meaning of this themselves.</p><br/><p>On the Internet.</p><br/><p>A group of people was still flaming him maniacally.</p><br/><p>Ying Jin had already flamed him for over ten hours but she was tireless. It was as if she didn\u2019t know the meaning of fatigue.</p><br/><p>She had already found a team. Especially when she saw that all the netizens believed her own words, she felt amazing.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt has already been so long. Is Master Lin really not going to explain himself?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLooks like this matter is already set in stone. What a shame.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSigh. Even the glorious Master Lin cannot escape the temptation of money.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. I\u2019ll have one less idol from now on. Although Master Lin is really amazing, there\u2019s a difference between that and his moral standing.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, a netizen jumped out of nowhere.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you all retards? Can\u2019t you see Master Lin\u2019s Weibo? You\u2019re still here chattering like idiots. As for those haters, please continue to try and flame him. Those who trust Master Lin will always trust him. The only reason Master Lin ignored you all is that he was busy doing things.\u201d</p><br/><p>When people saw this comment, many of them rushed to Master Lin\u2019s Weibo to look at the situation.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, after Master Lin\u2019s Weibo post had been uploaded, it instantly drew a frenzy of comments as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn! This is too high-level. How can such a document be signed? Not having to pay taxes for an apartment flat, that\u2019s way too domineering.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn! What? Those apartments are not ordinary apartments but they\u2019re actually for the welfare institute\u2019s children to stay in. When they grow up, they\u2019ll stay in these apartments. D*mn, they\u2019re way too fortunate. Before even growing up, they already don\u2019t have to worry about buying houses.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, is Master Lin still accepting any older children? I want to go to the welfare institute.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn. The government was done beautifully this time. I approve of this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. This is very humane of them. They know that Master Lin is doing this for the children, so they\u2019ve exempted him from taxes. That\u2019s domineering.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe. We don\u2019t even know if this is true or not. Where did this document even come from? I\u2019ve never heard of the government endorsing such a document.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, I think it\u2019s fake too.\u201d</p><br/><p>And just as the masses just started to debate about this, the Shanghai government\u2019s official website publicly announced this news.</p><br/><p>Even some of the big shots started reposting it on Weibo.</p><br/><p>At that moment, everyone shut up.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Lin Fan didn\u2019t bother about all this. He felt that explaining it to idiots was really a waste of time.</p></div>\n</div>"}

He just turned away and started walking off.</p><br/><p>Then, He Xiao Ming started sobbing like a little boy. He squatted there and remained silent as if he was hurt by something.</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan was about to leave, He Xiao Ming started talking.</p><br/><p>\"You\u2026 stand there\u2026\" He Xiao Ming wiped the tears from his eyes. \"Were the things you said true?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan didn't reply. He just smiled and entered the car.</p><br/><p>He Xiao Ming wanted to go forward and ask more questions.</p><br/><p>But Lin Fan just drove off.</p><br/><p>\"Stand there! Make yourself clear before you leave. Were the things you mentioned real?\" He Xiao Ming shouted as the tears on his face glistened. But Lin Fan didn't reply him at all.</p><br/><p>He Xiao Ming just sat on the ground and mumbled, \"Was it real or fake\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"How did things end up like that?\"</p><br/><p>\"How did things end up like that\u2026\"</p><br/><p>In the car.</p><br/><p>*Ding ding!*</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at his phone display and smiled. Then, he picked up the call.</p><br/><p>He Cheng Han said, \"Master Lin, thank you so much.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. \"Don't thank me. That was the best I could do. But don't forget to go to the temple and endure the tough period.\"</p><br/><p>He Cheng Han shook his head. \"It's not tough. I didn't know what to do until I received Master Lin's guidance today. As long as he changes, I will do whatever I can.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \"It's not a big problem. It's just his psychological barrier. Once you resolve that, everything else can be settled. But that's all I could think of. Just pretend everything that happened was real. Don't treat it like a show.\"</p><br/><p>\"I understand,\" He Cheng Han said and nodded. \"Master Lin, I owe you a big favor. No matter what happens in the future, I'll do anything for you if you require my help.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. \"Alright, it's not that serious. I'll hang up now. This matter is a psychological one for you too. Just enlighten him. I read his fortune earlier and I'll stand by my words. He's good-natured but he's just going against you. I believe that will change after this incident.\"</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>This was indeed a show put together by Lin Fan and He Cheng Han. Of course, it wasn't that coincidental. He Cheng Han couldn't do anything else besides let He Xiao Ming understand his feelings.</p><br/><p>He had given him everything he wanted.</p><br/><p>Perhaps even being bankrupt wouldn't let He Xiao Ming learn anything.</p><br/><p>This incident was an illogical and improbable one.</p><br/><p>After they had discussed things, this was the only method they could agree on.</p><br/><p>Although it was an act, the motive was still a good one.</p><br/><p>They were hopeful of a good result.</p><br/><p>At the end of the bridge.</p><br/><p>He Xiao Ming was still in a daze. He was thinking about the conversation between the two of them.</p><br/><p>\"Who was he? Why did he say that I would be in trouble and how did he know that?\"</p><br/><p>\"Why did my father believe him?\"</p><br/><p>He was thinking about everything. Then, he took out his phone and looked at his dad's number. He thought about it for a while. Then, he searched up 'Master Lin' on the internet.</p><br/><p>Search!</p><br/><p>A series of results appeared in an instant.</p><br/><p>\"A word from Master Lin can determine your life and death.\"</p><br/><p>\"Cloud Street's Master Lin is the best fortune-teller in China.\"</p><br/><p>\"A man is still grateful for Master Lin after escaping death thanks to his advice. He shares his thoughts with everyone.\"</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>He hadn't expected to find these results. Suddenly, he was in disbelief.</p><br/><p>A fortune-teller?</p><br/><p>An accurate one?</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The next day!</p><br/><p>*Door creaking sound*</p><br/><p>He Xiao Ming opened his eyes and looked at the time. It was five in the morning.</p><br/><p>He had returned home the night before and he hadn't awoken anyone, including his dad.</p><br/><p>He hadn't slept for the whole night as he had been thinking about what had happened the night before. Now that his dad had left the house, he immediately followed him.</p><br/><p>His dad usually woke up at seven every morning but he left at five today. There was something wrong.</p><br/><p>He had listened to their conversation clearly yesterday night. There was a temple far away. His dad must have headed for the temple. Then, he drove behind his dad's car.</p><br/><p>An hour later.</p><br/><p>He found his dad's car at the foot of the mountain where the temple was located.</p><br/><p>He Xiao Ming stood there and started to walk upwards without any hesitation.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, he was stunned.</p><br/><p>There was a silhouette in front of him. The person knelt down after every step he took. He was heading in the direction of the temple.</p><br/><p>He looked at the silhouette and his throat throbbed involuntarily. He was in disbelief and was even feeling a little remorseful.</p><br/><p>Suddenly.</p><br/><p>He felt pain in his heart as he watched the silhouette.</p><br/><p>He was walking on the path that his dad had knelt on. He realized that it was an uneven ground and it would have been extremely painful to kneel on it.</p><br/><p>Then, He Xiao Ming was extremely heavy-hearted. It wasn't that he didn't love his dad. It was just a psychological barrier that had gotten even harder to break through as time passed. He got angry every time he thought of it and felt that everyone in the world treated him badly.</p><br/><p>Even the words that his dad told him resonated within him.</p><br/><p>Failure!</p><br/><p>Useless!</p><br/><p>Get lost!</p><br/><p>Etc...</p><br/><p>Those words had had a great impact on him. They had broken his heart and made him angry.</p><br/><p>What Lin Fan had said was correct. He was about eighteen years of age and had a strong ego. He was in the rebellious stage of his life. Although he had been in the society for a long time, he had seen a lot which had affected his views on things.</p><br/><p>At that moment.</p><br/><p>He Xiao Ming saw his dad kneel before a giant Buddha statue. Then, he continued kneeling down and only got up after a long time.</p><br/><p>What is my father thinking?</p><br/><p>When he thought of that question, He Xiao Ming started to think deeper. He didn't know what his dad was thinking about and he wanted to go forward to ask him. But he resisted the urge to do so because he was following him secretly. He wanted to see what was going on.</p><br/><p>Then, He Cheng Han was prepared to go around the entire statue of the Buddha and kneel down before it.</p><br/><p>When he knelt before the Buddha who had one of his palms facing up, the top of the statue gently wobbled for a moment. Then, it fell.</p><br/><p>He Xiao Ming opened his eyes wide.</p><br/><p>*slam*</p><br/><p>A small part of the statue hit He Cheng Han on his head.</p><br/><p>He Cheng Han cried out and touched his head. It was bleeding. Although the statue wasn't made of gold, it was pretty heavy. An impact on one's head would definitely cause it to bleed.</p><br/><p>The surrounding monks were stunned and they wanted to see what had happened.</p><br/><p>He Cheng Han touched his head and realized that it was just a scrape. Then, he waved his hand and wiped the blood from his head. He continued to kneel down before the Buddha.</p><br/><p>He Xiao Ming was standing a short distance away. When he saw what had happened, he trembled in fear.</p><br/><p>Bear the consequence for him\u2026</p><br/><p>Suddenly, that phrase resonated in He Xiao Ming's mind. When he saw his dad in that state, he started to cry.</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>In a certain apartment building.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan had already gotten out of his bed. He switched on his phone and read a news article.</p><br/><p>\"There have been slight tremors on XX Mountain\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Then, Lin Fan rubbed his fingers together and read the fortune of He Cheng Han. \"D*mn it, Chief He will suffer minor bloodshed today.\" Then, he laughed and didn't know what misunderstanding would result from that.</p><br/><p>But he wanted to let the misunderstanding develop.</p><br/><p>Even the heavens were helping them, what else could he do about it?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

The top ten posts on Weibo were all related to Master Lin. The situation had already become a huge topic of discussion amongst the people.</p><br/><p>In their eyes, this brother had definitely blown the whole situation up. Also, it was definitely not going to be easy for him to bring this to a close. If he were to succeed in his development, that would be good. However, if his development failed, it would have very big repercussions.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, the most crucial thing was, if he were to succeed in his development, what would happen after that? Would he keep it all for himself?</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-2\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Would that even be possible? This was something that was going to completely alter the course of the history of medicine. If he were to finish his development, all the celestial beings from everywhere would be doing everything that they can to be a part of it.</p><br/><p>Although he was already considered pretty rich here in Shanghai, he was just an ant when compared to all the other celestial beings from the other places.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026\u201d he sighed helplessly. He just hoped that he would be able to stay strong and not collapse.</p><br/><p>At Zhao Ming Qing\u2019s house.</p><br/><p>Lady Zhao felt a little helpless when she saw that her old man had not slept ever since he got home last night.</p><br/><p>\u201cOld man, you have been journaling since last night, how about you take a rest?\u201d Her heart ached. She knew that he was already of such old age so he had to take care of his body.</p><br/><p>It was very clear from his expression that Zhao Ming Qing was still filled with excitement. \u201cHow can I possibly rest? Do you not know the significance of Leukemia? Do you know?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you know how many Leukemia patients our country has? Also, do you know how many families are destroyed financially after having to pay for treatment for Leukemia? If my teacher really can develop a prescription, just think about how many lives we\u2019ll be able to save.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing was so stirred up by his own words that he was almost jumping about.</p><br/><p>\u201cOld man, don\u2019t get so stirred up.\u201d Lady Zhao was starting to wonder whether it was a good or bad thing that her husband had become Master Lin\u2019s disciple.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-3\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>When she looked at the current situation with him being so worked up, she wondered how his heart could take all of that.</p><br/><p>She could not even sway him with her words. Right now, even their children\u2019s words had no power over him anymore. Right now, he only listened to that teacher of his.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, I have to rush off to the university, my teacher should be arriving there soon. During this period, I won\u2019t be back home,\u201d Zhao Ming Qing said.</p><br/><p>Lady Zhao was stunned. \u201cNot coming back? Then where will you stay?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAt the university\u2019s research lab. The item that my teacher and I are developing is of huge importance, we can\u2019t have any distractions at all. Furthermore, we are fighting against the clock and have to make every second count.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019m not going to say anymore, I\u2019m leaving.\u201d</p><br/><p>After saying that, Zhao Ming Qing opened the door and left with no hesitation at all. RIght now, he could not contain his excitement and could not wait to rush to his teacher\u2019s side and conduct research with him.</p><br/><p>Shanghai\u2019s Chinese Medicine University.</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan reached the university, a few of the students started calling out to him immediately after they spotted him.</p><br/><p>To them, Master Lin was their idol. In the field of Chinese medicine, he was someone with power that would be difficult to surpass.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome on, Master Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, we believe that you are the best.\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-4\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>The students were all loudly cheering him on. They knew that their director was a student of Master Lin. Thus, since they were the students of the director, it made them feel very proud inside.</p><br/><p>Many of the students took their phones out and started snapping pictures.</p><br/><p>Afterward, they immediately posted the pictures and captioned: \u2018Master Lin is here at the university, already starting his research.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied to the students with a nod. Under this kind of circumstances, it was unacceptable for him to not give his best in his research.</p><br/><p>When he reached the research lab, Zhao Ming Qing was already there and had been waiting for a while.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher,\u201d Zhao Ming Qing greeted him with excitement.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was surprised. \u201cYou came so early?\u201d</p><br/><p>He could not help laughing. He had not thought that his own student had actually placed this whole situation at such a high level of importance. However, it made sense because his student was so attached to Chinese medicine. Also, it was probably because of this attachment that he had managed to get to where he was today. Ever since he had met Lin Fan, Lin Fan had not withheld anything and had given him everything he needed as well.</p><br/><p>With regards to Chinese medicine, besides Lin Fan, there probably was not anyone who could surpass him.</p><br/><p>Even the \u2018Silent Priest of the Wuxiang Taoist Temple wasn\u2019t as good as Zhao Ming Qing.</p><br/><p>After all, the \u2018Silent Priest\u2019 was pretty varied in his studies. Zhao Ming Qing had done specialized research for tens of years. His level of knowledge was not something normal people match up to.</p><br/><p>At this moment, a sound came from outside.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, looks like the ingredients are here.\u201d Zhao Ming Qing had told the person in charge of the pharmaceutical company the purpose behind the ingredients.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-5\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>When the person in charge had heard about it, his excitement had been beyond description.</p><br/><p>Originally, the ingredients could have been prepared last night.</p><br/><p>However, to the person in charge, he could not be so nonchalant in preparing ingredients for them. He had gotten a group of experts to come down and through the whole night, he had them pick out the ingredients that were of the highest quality before sending them over.</p><br/><p>If they could really develop a prescription for Leukemia, their company would also be famous.</p><br/><p>After all, the ingredients were all from their company. Even if they gave it to them for free, they would profit from it.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan and Ming Qing went outside to receive them and, with the help of the workers, they shifted all the ingredients inside.</p><br/><p>These ingredients were just what Lin Fan had written down. As for what combination would be used for the end product, it would be determined by his own capabilities.</p><br/><p>The students of Chinese Medical Academy all gathered around and used their phones to snap pictures.</p><br/><p>Cloud Street!</p><br/><p>The townsfolk had arrived on time to buy the scallion pancakes.</p><br/><p>Naturally, they knew about the news from last night. In their hearts, they were all wondering if he would still come down to sell scallion pancakes today. However, they knew that the chances were low.</p><br/><p>Master Lin was going to develop a prescription. How would he have time to make scallion pancakes?</p><br/><p>But regardless, they still came down. They wanted to see what the situation was like over here.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian was sitting at the entrance. A man, by his own initiative, went up to him and passed him a cigarette before lighting it up for him.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Tian, tell us. Do you think that Master Lin has a chance of developing that prescription?\u201d a middle-aged man asked.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian took a puff of his cigarette and released a puff of white smoke. Then, he glanced at him and said, \u201cAll of you guys want to know?\u201d</p><br/><p>The surrounding townsfolk all nodded and said, \u201cOf course we want to know.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian slapped his leg and said, \u201cAlright then. Today, I\u2019m going to tell you guys about the situation\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang looked on helplessly. He wondered how these people could be so blindly swayed by Fraud Tian.</p><br/><p>However, in his heart, he was still thinking whether or not this situation could be resolved.</p><br/><p>Although he had an incomparable amount of trust in Brother Lin, when it came to this, he had some reservations.</p></div>\n</div>"}

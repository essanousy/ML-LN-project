It was as if he had found a feeling that he had lost a long time ago. He even felt that he possessed very fashionable genes.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan and Wu You Lan pretended not to know him and didn\u2019t speak to him at all.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Zhao Zhong Yang was quite pitiful. He wanted to pretend that he didn\u2019t know Fraud Tian as well but he had no choice. Fraud Tian kept sticking by his side and talking to him.</p><br/><p>\u201cHelp me to see what\u2019s written on this name card. Why can\u2019t I understand it?\u201d Fraud Tian could understand Chinese characters very well but he was clueless about all those alphabets.</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang looked at it seriously. Then, he was taken aback. It was as if he had seen a ghost. That person was a fashion photographer. And it seemed like he was rather famous too.</p><br/><p>At that moment, his mind started running wild as he thought of all the different possibilities.</p><br/><p>For example, this Fraud could start showing off and boasting in front of him all day. Zhao Zhong Yang wouldn\u2019t be able to stand it.</p><br/><p>Then, he thought for a moment and finally came up with a plan.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, this? This guy is an AV director. Perhaps he wants to bring you to Japan,\u201d said Zhao Zhong Yang.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian was stunned and he didn\u2019t quite believe it. \u201cThat\u2019s not possible, is it? I don\u2019t see the letters \u2018A\u2019 or \u2018V\u2019.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang replied, \u201cYou\u2019re wrong. Those two letters are substitutable. If you don\u2019t believe me, I\u2019ll call this number.\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Fraud Tian was enraged. \u201cWhat? That guy actually wants me to act in that kind of films? Even a Fraud like me has dignity.\u201d</p><br/><p>*Tear*</p><br/><p>Upon saying that, Fraud Tian immediately tore the name card in half. Then, he patted Zhao Zhong Yang\u2019s shoulder and said proudly. \u201cSigh. What are those people thinking, doing those kinds of things? They even want an old man like me. If I go there, I\u2019m not sure if I would be able to leave the place alive.\u201d</p><br/><p>There was some hidden meaning behind those words.</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang really wanted to say \u2018Fraud, let\u2019s go to the toilet and change into another set of clothes.\u2019 However, looking at Fraud Tian, he knew that it probably wasn\u2019t possible.</p><br/><p>The surrounding people who were queuing to pass through customs were looking over with curious eyes.</p><br/><p>After all, for an aged man to dress so flashily, it was quite eye-catching.</p><br/><p>Most of them had taken out their phones and were taking pictures as they seemed very excited. It was as if they had discovered a new piece of land.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian said, \u201cWhat do you think they\u2019re taking pictures of? Could it be that they\u2019re taking pictures of me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang coughed. \u201cI think so.\u201d</p><br/><p><em>Is it not f*cking obvious enough? They\u2019re clearly taking pictures of you!</em></p><br/><p>Suddenly!</p><br/><p>A series of noises could be heard.</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone, get out of the way! He\u2019s gone mad!\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly, in the distance, a figure was running over maniacally. He was even holding a dagger in his hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck!\u201d When Zhao Zhong Yang saw this, he was dumbfounded. He hadn\u2019t expected that someone would dare to commit a violent act at the airport.</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan saw this, he was stunned as well. Then, just as he was about to make a move, he realized that Fraud Tian was running over there ferociously.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou actually dare to harm others with a weapon in broad daylight! You must be asking for a beating.\u201d</p><br/><p>*Bam bam*</p><br/><p>With a few strikes, the situation was resolved.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn. This flashy old man is way too awesome.\u201d</p><br/><p>The surrounding passersby were all astonished when they saw this. They hadn\u2019t expected this at all.</p><br/><p>Those moves coupled with those flashy clothes made for a very peculiar sight.</p><br/><p>*Snap!*</p><br/><p>*Snap!*</p><br/><p>The surrounding people couldn\u2019t take it any longer. They took out their phones and started taking photos non-stop. To them, this was way too domineering.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shook his head. He hadn\u2019t expected that, this time, Fraud Tian would manage to show off.</p><br/><p>Very soon, the airport\u2019s security guards captured that man.</p><br/><p>\u201cFraud, hurry up. It\u2019s your turn already.\u201d Lin Fan and Wu You Lan had already finished going through the checks. Lin Fan called out to Fraud Tian who was still standing there.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m coming.\u201d Fraud Tian clapped his hands together. This kind of lowly scum could be taken care of with just a few strikes. He didn\u2019t even have to expend much energy. Then, he picked up his old and tattered luggage and walked over to the customs.</p><br/><p>This whole scene was recorded by the surrounding people.</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang looked at the surrounding people, then at Fraud Tian. He lowered his head and pretended not to know Fraud Tian before walking past the crowd.</p><br/><p>He felt that something big was about to happen to Fraud Tian.</p><br/><p>On the airplane.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked closely at Fraud Tian. \u201cFraud, when I look at your clothing again, I suddenly realize that you are dressed very fashionably.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian laughed happily when he heard that, \u201cHaha. I told you. That girl\u2019s recommendations are definitely good. I feel much younger after wearing this. There are even so many people taking photos of me. It\u2019s really the first time I\u2019ve felt this popular.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan covered her mouth to stop herself from laughing. She realized that Fraud Tian\u2019s clothes were really amusing. It was like something out of a movie. But it was really like what Brother Lin had said. After looking at it longer, it actually looked pretty good. There was an indescribable feeling about it.</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang sighed. He felt that he had harmed Fraud Tian. If he hadn\u2019t introduced that unreliable girl to Fraud Tian, Fraud Tian wouldn\u2019t have turned out like this.</p><br/><p>It was all his fault.</p><br/><p>Back at the airport.</p><br/><p>When the reporters heard about what had happened at the airport, they rushed over immediately.</p><br/><p>But when they reached, they realized that nothing much was going on. Then, they immediately started asking people about it.</p><br/><p>One of the townsfolk, who hadn\u2019t passed through customs yet, said excitedly.</p><br/><p>\u201cI recorded it! That scene from just now was way too shocking.\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporter asked, \u201cCould you show us the video?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSure, no problem. Let me tell you. That old man is really incredible. Not only is he dressed flashily but he\u2019s also a martial arts expert. That perpetrator was taken down in just two or three strikes and he couldn\u2019t even move anymore. It was really amazing!\u201d</p><br/><p>When the reporters heard this, they became even more excited. They wondered what exactly had happened.</p><br/><p>Then, when they saw the video, they couldn\u2019t help but exclaim.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat a flashy old man!\u201d</p><br/><p>The townsfolk nodded. \u201cHe is, isn\u2019t he? His clothes are way too flashy. This is the first time I\u2019ve seen an old man dress like this. But I have to say that this old man is really brave and powerful. In an instant, he managed to beat down that man. If I didn\u2019t record this, I might not believe it myself.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, the reporters immediately asked that man to send them the video. No matter what, they had to put this on the news.</p><br/><p><em>What a flashy old man.</em></p><br/><p><em>What a powerful old man!</em></p><br/><p>Haojiang!</p><br/><p>Yun Xue Yao was dressed up elegantly. Her best friend, Jin Meng, asked curiously, \u201cXue Yao, why are you dressed like this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yun Xue Yao smiled. \u201cBrother Lin and the rest are coming to Haojiang from Shanghai. I\u2019m going to fetch them later.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Lin? You mean that man that you like?\u201d asked Jin Meng in surprise.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about? When did I say that I like him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStop pretending. You\u2019ve already betrayed yourself. I want to go and see just what kind of person he is.\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

Although he wasn\u2019t very willing to go, he had already agreed to it.</p><br/><p>At the Education Conference Centre.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing had been waiting since much earlier. When he saw his teacher, he immediately went forward with a wide smile on his face and said, \u201cTeacher, you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMing Qing, I really don\u2019t like to join such conferences.\u201d Why would a low-key person like him want to join any conferences? He didn\u2019t want to show his face in public and he didn\u2019t even think there was any point in holding a conference when things were already settled.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing pulled on his teacher\u2019s arm and said with a beaming smile, \u201cTeacher, you\u2019re already here so you should just join. This is a custom. Moreover, after the audit of the Chinese Medicine foundational teaching materials, many professors who write teaching materials want to see you, Teacher.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shook his head, \u201cFine, fine. Let\u2019s go in then.\u201d</p><br/><p>When they reached the entrance, Zhao Ming Qing saw someone he knew, so he greeted, \u201cProfessor Wang.\u201d</p><br/><p>Professor Wang looked at Zhao Ming Qing, then a Lin Fan, who was at the side. He instantly smiled and said, \u201cThis must be Master Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin fan smiled thinly, \u201cNice to meet you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Professor Wang sighed, \u201cMaster Lin is able to write this kind of teaching materials at such a young age. You really are a genius. Come, let\u2019s go in together.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d Lin Fan nodded and laughed. He didn\u2019t expect that these people would be so friendly. It seemed that he had been thinking too much.</p><br/><p>However, what he didn\u2019t know was that these people had already agreed beforehand that they must be very friendly and courteous to Master Lin if they see him. After all, they want to sign their names on his teaching materials. If they act all high and mighty, unless he was an idiot, he would never agree to have their names signed on the teaching materials.</p><br/><p>But whether or not he agreed, they had already decided on this matter.</p><br/><p>They were split into sectors here, the North sector and South sector. The teaching materials in the North would be signed by the people in the North sector while the teaching materials in the South would be signed by those in the South sector. All these years, everyone has minded their own business and not interfered with each other.</p><br/><p>But this time, they were going to work hand in hand. These teaching materials written by Master Lin were exceptional. They had to be issued in the entire country\u2019s various Chinese Medical Academies. It was a significant matter. Hence, the North and South sectors had agreed that each sector would nominate five people to have their names added to the teaching materials.</p><br/><p>Although some people were envious, it couldn\u2019t be helped since their statuses weren\u2019t high enough. They couldn\u2019t match up to the older generations.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin is here\u2026\u201d At this moment, Professor Wang entered.</p><br/><p>Everyone\u2019s gazes fell upon Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>For some people, this was the first time they had seen Lin Fan and they were a little astonished. He was indeed very young. They couldn\u2019t help but grin slyly. It\u2019s good that he\u2019s young, young people are easy to take advantage of.</p><br/><p>Then, a group of people came gathering around him.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, it\u2019s an honor to finally meet you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin is really young and promising. Your medical skills are admirable. Now that I\u2019ve seen you, you are indeed not average.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFor Master Lin to be able to write these Chinese Medicine foundational teaching materials, it is indeed admirable.\u201d</p><br/><p>The praises flowed unceasingly.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. He hadn\u2019t expected these old professors to be so friendly. That saved him some trouble.</p><br/><p>After exchanging some courteous words with these old professors, he found his seat and sat down. He had a pretty good seat allocated to him, in the first row.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said softly, \u201cMing Qing, what are these people\u2019s backgrounds? Why haven\u2019t I seen any of them before?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing leaned towards Lin Fan\u2019s ear and said, \u201cTeacher, these are all professors who specialize in writing teaching materials. The one who just greeted you and asked for a group photo is Professor Chen, who wrote \u2018The Study of the Human Vascular System\u2019. He\u2019s considered to be great at theories.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at Zhao Ming Qing curiously, \u201cWhat\u2019s strange about them?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing saw that there was no one around so he didn\u2019t try to hide anything. \u201cI haven\u2019t interacted with them very much but according to my knowledge, they are very anti-outsider. For example, the teaching materials written by you should have been a thorn in their sides but the situation today has made me slightly surprised. I keep feeling as if something is wrong. I\u2019m afraid that something bad might happen.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said in a surprised tone, \u201cThat can\u2019t be, can it? What could happen? Forget it, let\u2019s not think about it. The conference is starting soon. We\u2019ll just stay low-key and leave once it ends.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d Zhao Ming Qing nodded. He was still worrying in his heart. This really didn\u2019t make sense. Although his teacher\u2019s medical abilities were amazing, the people would not care about these. After all, no matter how great someone\u2019s abilities were, if he did not have enough connections, he could still be smothered and pushed aside by a crowd.</p><br/><p>This power of crowding out someone was terrifying. Even if you had shocking talents, you would still be unable to reach the top if you were to be crowded out.</p><br/><p>\u201cChief is here,\u201d at that moment, someone in the conference room shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cProfessor Yang is here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked over. The initially empty stage now had six people seated on it.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing pointed and said, \u201cThat is the leader of the Education Department and that is Professor Yang who\u2019s considered the bellwether of the teaching material-writing industry. He has written numerous teaching materials and he has many followers. However, I heard that he is a smiling tiger. He has a peaceful appearance but on the inside, he is very sinister\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that so?\u201d Lin Fan had never been to such a conference and he didn\u2019t really understand the situation. The people in here were all at least a generation older than him, so it didn\u2019t feel quite right. He didn\u2019t want to interact too much.</p><br/><p>\u201cThese are all just rumors but most students don\u2019t know them. Those senior professors who write teaching materials are basically all busy with attending various conferences so I haven\u2019t come into contact with them much,\u201d said Zhao Ming Qing.</p><br/><p>\u201cAhem!\u201d At that moment, the leader coughed gently and the whole place turned silent. Then, he swept the place with his eyes and finally stopped when his eyes met Lin Fan. He smiled thinly as a form of greeting.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan took out his phone and put on his earphones. He swept through his Weibo boringly. This kind of conference just involved every one boasting a little, talking about their hopes for the future and making some small talk. It was basically useless.</p><br/><p>The people on the stage started talking. As for what they talked about, Lin Fan didn\u2019t listen so he didn\u2019t know.</p><br/><p>Time passed very quickly.</p><br/><p>The leader\u2019s speech ended and he left the place for the moment, perhaps because he knew what was going to happen, so he left to avoid the awkwardness.</p><br/><p>He wasn\u2019t a person from this industry, so he left it to these industry people to handle it.</p><br/><p>Half an hour passed.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was about to doze off.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Lin Fan was woken up by Zhao Ming Qing. He just saw Zhao Ming Qing stand up and, with his face bright red, he said furiously, \u201cI object! How could you all do that? You\u2019re stealing the crystals of my teacher\u2019s wisdom, the fruits of his labor! You\u2019re all senior professors, how could you do that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMing Qing, what are you doing?\u201d Lin Fan took out his earphones and asked with a puzzled look on his face. He had no idea why Ming Qing was so agitated.</p><br/><p>Professor Yang said, \u201cDirector Zhao, please sit down. This is a conference. If there are any issues, you can wait till the conference has ended before we slowly talk it out. Moreover, your teacher didn\u2019t even say anything so why would you have any opinions?\u201d</p><br/><p>They had just talked about the signing of names on the new teaching materials. They had added the names of ten professors onto the credit page. Initially, they were afraid that Master Lin wouldn\u2019t agree but when they saw Master Lin just bury his head there motionlessly, they all laughed in their hearts. It seemed that he had agreed with it.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing ignored that Professor Yang and said to Lin Fan, \u201cTeacher, they\u2019re being absurd. They want to add ten names to the credit page of your teaching materials.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was startled, \u201cYou mean that they want to add their names to the teaching materials written by me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing nodded furiously, \u201cYes, that\u2019s exactly what they\u2019re trying to do.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone else kept silent as they just fixed their gazes on Lin Fan as if waiting for something to happen.</p><br/><p>Professor Yang coughed gently, then said, \u201cMaster Lin, this is what we\u2019ve decided after deep consideration. Teaching materials are very important. If they are only credited to one person and the outside world finds out, it\u2019ll become a joke. They\u2019ll say that our countrymen are incapable and our teaching materials can only be written by one person. Moreover, we are protecting you too. You are young but you can already write such teaching materials. If it is found out by people with bad intentions, it might turn out to be very troublesome.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlso, in your teaching materials, we\u2019ve discovered some problems and we\u2019ve already corrected them all. Hence, we wish that you would agree to this. Of course, your name will still be first and you will still be the top writer of these teaching materials. That is an undeniable truth.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p></div>\n</div>"}

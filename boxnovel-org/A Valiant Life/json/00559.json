At the same time, they asked, \u201cLittle Boss, today\u2019s scallion pancakes taste a little different.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was stunned. He asked doubtfully, \u201cDoes it taste bad?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow could it be? I feel like it tastes better than before. It feels good,\u201d the townsfolk replied. The scallion pancake actually had a \u2018clean\u2019 feeling when he bit into it.</p><br/><p>How could such a feeling be experienced from food? But the truth is that he felt it too.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan just smiled. Could it be because of the cleaning knowledge classification? When you remove all the accumulated toxins and stains, only the best and cleanest things would be left behind. The pancake was the ultimate \u2018green food\u2019.</p><br/><p>That was perhaps the case but he couldn\u2019t confirm it.</p><br/><p>Magical, simply magical.</p><br/><p>The mixture of knowledge classifications could actually produce such drastic effects. He wished he found out about it earlier.</p><br/><p>However, it wasn\u2019t too late. After he returned home, he would research on it.</p><br/><p>The townsfolk were enjoying every single bite and Lin Fan was grinning from ear to ear. It felt amazing and he couldn\u2019t describe it with words.</p><br/><p>Master Lin\u2019s scallion pancakes were really famous. Some tourists who visited Shanghai came to try Master Lin\u2019s scallion pancakes after looking at the recommendations by others.</p><br/><p>However, the daily limit of ten scallion pancakes was as good as suffocating people.</p><br/><p>After he finished making the pancakes, Lin Fan packed up and was prepared to leave Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>He was going to a Chinese medical hall to buy some medicinal ingredients. Those that couldn\u2019t be bought had to be replaced with similar ones instead.</p><br/><p>At the Chinese medical hall.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan handed the paper to the boss, \u201cTen servings of every ingredient.\u201d</p><br/><p>The boss looked at it and turned around to pick the ingredients. Then, he placed them one by one in front of Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan started to observe the ingredients. He was about to make the intelligence pills and the ingredients had to be flawless. When he reached the fourth ingredient, Lin Fan stopped and smiled. \u201cBoss, you\u2019re a little dishonest.\u201d</p><br/><p>The boss looked at Lin Fan and smiled awkwardly. \u201cSo you\u2019re an expert. Sorry, I took the wrong one. I\u2019ll get new ones for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shook his head helplessly. This situation was common and he didn\u2019t want to comment too much on it.</p><br/><p>If one didn\u2019t have any understanding of it, it would be normal for he/she to be cheated.</p><br/><p>As Lin Fan looked at him disdainfully, the boss of the Chinese medical hall awkwardly prepared the ingredients. \u201cBoss, do you need anything else?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at him and thought for a moment. \u201cLet me see these ingredients.\u201d</p><br/><p>The boss of the Chinese medical hall was stunned. He didn\u2019t expect this young chap to know so much about Chinese medicine. He couldn\u2019t even cheat him at all. He looked at the list of ingredients and said, \u201cBoss, your ingredients are quite expensive and they\u2019re all good for the brain. They\u2019re pretty rare but I have all the ingredients here. I\u2019ll take some for you now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled, \u201cDon\u2019t give me fake goods. I\u2019ll report you if you do.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBoss, don\u2019t worry. I took wrong ingredients just now. My signboard is golden, why would I use fake goods? It\u2019s all a misunderstanding,\u201d the boss of the Chinese medical hall said.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan didn\u2019t want to talk about it. He just wanted to take the ingredients and find a place to make the pills.</p><br/><p>After a moment, the boss of the Chinese medical hall wrapped up the ingredients. \u201cAlright, Boss, the total is $58,300. Since you bought so many ingredients, I\u2019ll give you a discount. I\u2019ll just take $58,000.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow despicable,\u201d Lin Fan thought to himself. Anyway, he wanted to rush to make the pills and didn\u2019t want to start a conflict.</p><br/><p>After Lin Fan left, the boss of the Chinese medical hall chuckled as he earned another hefty sum of money.</p><br/><p>He drove home and took the pressure cooker from his kitchen.</p><br/><p>The art of pill concoction is a dangerous one and he needed to ensure his safety. He then came to an isolated area.</p><br/><p>He exited his car.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the situation and nodded happily. There wasn\u2019t anyone around and he wouldn\u2019t be disturbed in the process of creating the pill. He just didn\u2019t know if it would succeed. If he succeeded, that would be a big fortune.</p><br/><p>He switched on his phone and went to Baidu.</p><br/><p>He needed to make a deep crater and used metal wires to enclose it. He then placed the pressure cooker on it and started a fire.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe tutorial online is so complete,\u201d Lin Fan said. He prepared everything and placed a serving of ingredients in it. Then, he placed the pressure cooker above the fire.</p><br/><p>*sizzle*</p><br/><p>The sound of ignition was loud and Lin Fan was full of anticipation. He wondered how it would turn out. Would it be successful?</p><br/><p>His heart was filled with anticipation.</p><br/><p>One by one, each second passed by\u2026</p><br/><p>A gust of hot air burst out of the pressure cooker.</p><br/><p>\u201cWill this work?\u201d Lin Fan looked at it intently. The pressure cooker was shaking and it seemed a little abnormal.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan didn\u2019t think too much about it. How could anything go wrong with pill creation? The internet said that a high-tech pressure cooker will solve all the problems.</p><br/><p>As long as the ingredients were good, he would definitely be able to make it.</p><br/><p>Then, there was a thunderous sound.</p><br/><p>*buzz*</p><br/><p>The pressure cooker didn\u2019t seem very stable. Suddenly, he felt that it was going to be dangerous.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan stepped backward as he felt that something was wrong.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck!\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Lin Fan realized that the pressure cooker was about to explode. He was scared out of his wits.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck, it\u2019s gonna explode!\u201d Lin Fan gasped. He quickly ran towards his car. If it was going to explode, it would definitely kill him.</p><br/><p>*bang!*</p><br/><p>A thunderous sound could be heard.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan hid behind his car and didn\u2019t move at all. He could only hear the heart-wrenching sound of the metal pieces dropping on his car.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, my car seems to be finished.\u201d Lin Fan hid there and his heart ached. What happened? Why did this happen?</p><br/><p>The thunderous sound stopped.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan peeked at the crater. There was white smoke coming out from it. Then, he looked at his car. There was a big piece of the pressure cooker that was stuck in his car door.</p><br/><p>The force must have been extremely great.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe internet almost killed me. Who said that the pressure cooker could be used to create pills? I wasted three hours and it exploded. I almost died. It was so d*mn frightening.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was extremely disappointed. It was his first time attempting pill creation and the pot exploded. What did he need to do to resolve that?</p><br/><p>The Encyclopedia was immoral. It only gave the ingredients needed to make the pill but it didn\u2019t offer any techniques. How was he going to do it?</p><br/><p>He walked to the crater and there were metal pieces of the pressure cooker all around it. The charcoal was scattered around too. If he didn\u2019t react in time, there might have been a corpse lying there too.</p><br/><p>Even if he didn\u2019t die, he would be crippled too.</p><br/><p>\u201cSigh\u2026\u201d Lin Fan sighed as he had failed his first attempt. It looked like he needed to be more prepared.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey!\u201d At that moment, Lin Fan furrowed his brows and looked at the crater carefully. Under the pressure cooker, there was a small white pill that was the size of his fingernail.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Lin Fan smiled. \u201cDid I succeed?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, that was impressive.\u201d He was initially unhappy with the outcome but things were different now. He took the pill and looked at it closely. He realized that there were a lot of hairline cracks on the pill. It looked as if it could break apart anytime.</p><br/><p>It was a defective product.</p><br/><p>The Encyclopedia said that a perfect Little Intelligence pill would be slightly golden. A white pill was a normal grade product and if it had hairline cracks, it would be a defective product. The results wouldn\u2019t be effective and one would be better off eating walnuts instead.</p><br/><p>It was a failure!</p><br/><p>But it was a good start.</p><br/><p>He was full of confidence and he wanted to try again.</p></div>\n</div>"}

I suggest that you go to Shanghai or Beijing Children\u2019s Hospital. We can\u2019t treat this disease here.\u201d</p><br/><p>The couple looked extremely helpless. Their child was five years old. He had been feeling weak every day since a month ago. He slept for almost twenty hours every day and he still felt weak when he woke up. He didn\u2019t have the liveliness of a child. As his parents, they didn\u2019t notice it for the first few days as they thought that their child might have been too exhausted from playing. However, they realized that there was something wrong.</p><br/><p>Then, they quickly brought him to the hospital but the doctor said that it was a rare occurrence. There weren\u2019t many cases of this around the world. He had undergone treatment for a few days in Jiangning Citizen\u2019s Hospital but there wasn\u2019t any improvement. Now, they could only proceed to another hospital.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat shall we do?\u201d The child\u2019s father was anxious. It couldn\u2019t continue like this.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go to a big hospital. We can go to Shanghai Children\u2019s Hospital right now,\u201d the mother said.</p><br/><p>The child\u2019s father nodded, \u201cThat\u2019s the best we can do.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Outside the hospital.</p><br/><p>Nobody approached Lin Fan and the others. There were quite a number of ambulances that drove to the hospital. However, they only looked at them. The people that entered the hospital didn\u2019t even notice their existence.</p><br/><p>The people definitely trusted the hospital more.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan and Zhao Ming Qing just sat there. Although there weren\u2019t any patients, they weren\u2019t anxious at all. However, Qiu Jie and Zhang Tong Tong were extremely puzzled. There wasn\u2019t a single soul even though half the day had already passed.</p><br/><p>Then, Lin Fan said, \u201cWait for a moment.\u201d</p><br/><p>A couple walked out of the hospital carrying a child. They looked extremely disappointed. Then, Lin Fan called out to them and asked, \u201cYour child is suffering from something. Why not come here and let us have a look?\u201d</p><br/><p>The child\u2019s mother had nowhere to go and she regarded Lin Fan as a last resort. However, the child\u2019s dad was a little more cautious.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be anxious. We\u2019re from the Chinese Medical Association and we came from Beijing to do some voluntary medical work.\u201d</p><br/><p>The couple looked at each other, then at Lin Fan. Then, they looked at Zhao Ming Qing. As Zhao Ming Qing looked rather old, they felt that he was reliable and they slowly let down their guard.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe doctors in the hospital weren\u2019t able to treat him. They said that this child\u2019s illness is extremely rare and asked us to go to Beijing or Shanghai for treatment,\u201d the child\u2019s mother said.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded and didn\u2019t say anything. Then, he looked at the child who was being carried by his dad. \u201cMing Qing, take a look at him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing nodded. He used his hand to measure the child\u2019s pulse and opened the child\u2019s mouth to check his tongue.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe pulse is stable. However, it beats intensely. His tongue is rather dark. There isn\u2019t anything wrong with his body. It isn\u2019t a good thing for the pulse to be stable but intense. As for treatment, I will first use acupuncture to test his reaction. If there isn\u2019t any reaction, we will use Chinese medicine to treat him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qiu Jie said, \u201cDirector, could he be suffering from hypersomnia?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing shook his head, \u201cIt\u2019s not hypersomnia. Hypersomnia doesn\u2019t have symptoms like this. It is easy to recognize it. Furthermore, the Citizen\u2019s Hospital isn\u2019t a normal hospital. They should\u2019ve been able to check that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Then, the child\u2019s parents looked at Zhao Ming Qing in disbelief. \u201cWhen we first brought our child to the hospital here, the doctor thought that it was hypersomnia. After he did all the checks, he realized that it wasn\u2019t hypersomnia. How did you know after just one look?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Tong Tong said proudly, \u201cThis is the director of our academy. His medical skills are top notch. He knows the symptoms just by measuring his pulse.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, people started to gather around. They saw that someone approached this voluntary medical work setup and were curious about what was happening.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing wasn\u2019t bothered by what was happening around them. Then, he asked Lin Fan, \u201cTeacher, if it was hypersomnia, I could treat it with medicine. However, I can\u2019t figure out what is happening. Can you have a look?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Lin Fan nodded and stretched out his arms, \u201cPass me the child.\u201d</p><br/><p>The couple was stunned. Then, they looked at Zhao Ming Qing. They didn\u2019t know what this young man was doing.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing said, \u201cThis is my mentor. His medical skills are a thousand times better than mine. Just let him have a look and he might really treat your child.\u201d</p><br/><p>The couple was in disbelief. It was as if they had heard it wrongly. This young man here was the mentor of this elderly man? This\u2026 This\u2026</p><br/><p>The surrounding crowd started to discuss among themselves in disbelief.</p><br/><p>They felt that this was something special.</p><br/><p>It was their first time seeing a young man be the mentor of an elderly man.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan carried the child and pressed some parts of the child\u2019s body. \u201cThese few acupuncture points are the most important ones to the body\u2019s circulation. It can improve blood circulation greatly. Pass an acupuncture needle to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing immediately handed him an acupuncture needle. Qiu Jie and Zhang Tong Tong looked at him attentively so that they wouldn\u2019t miss anything.</p><br/><p>Qiu Jie immediately recorded down those acupuncture points that Lin Fan had mentioned. As Chinese medical doctors, they had to memorize all the acupuncture points of the human body. There were a lot of them. If they didn\u2019t memorize all of them, they might not be able to treat an illness.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan raised his head, \u201cDon\u2019t be anxious. Inserting an acupuncture needle into an acupoint isn\u2019t dangerous. Your child will be healthy soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>A passer-by interrupted, \u201cBro, are you kidding? They didn\u2019t manage to receive treatment at a big hospital and you say you can treat him?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled and didn\u2019t reply. Then, he placed an acupuncture needle into the fenglong acupoint. Suddenly, the child\u2019s eyelids twitched.</p><br/><p>\u201cLook, his eyelids just twitched. This acupoint can stimulate him. Pass me another needle,\u201d Lin Fan said. Then, he looked at the couple. \u201cI will be placing another needle on his head. Don\u2019t be anxious or afraid. There won\u2019t be anything wrong. Don\u2019t make any sudden movements or else I might insert it wrongly and he would be in danger.\u201d</p><br/><p>The parents were stunned, \u201cHe won\u2019t be in danger, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled, \u201cDon\u2019t move and he\u2019ll be fine. Don\u2019t worry, nothing will go wrong. We aren\u2019t here to harm people at the entrance of the hospital. Anyway, you can have a look at our certifications.\u201d</p><br/><p>The child\u2019s parents lowered their heads and looked at the certifications.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan quickly placed a needle into the baihui acupoint, the needle was 1.5inch long.</p><br/><p>When the child\u2019s parents looked up, the needle had already been inserted.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan gently swirled the needle and pulled it out. He did it extremely quickly and people didn\u2019t even manage to see it clearly. Then, he held onto the child\u2019s feet and pressed onto them forcefully with his thumb.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, the child started to cry.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan placed the child on the ground. The child cried and went towards the couple.</p><br/><p>The crowd was stunned when they saw this.</p><br/><p>This\u2026this\u2026</p></div>\n</div>"}

Little Boss actually wanted to sell twenty pieces of scallion pancakes. They felt that it was impossible. They knew that Little Boss wouldn\u2019t do it for no reason.</p><br/><p>There was only one possibility. It meant that something bad was going to happen.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Boss, tell us. What\u2019s going to happen?\u201d A townsfolk saw through Little Boss\u2019 tricks. He stood before the cart and didn\u2019t dare to go near the scallion pancakes.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled, \u201cNothing! Everything is fine. Do you guys not want twenty pieces?\u201d However, his heart was beating rapidly. These townsfolk knew his tricks. They were cautious of his actions. Something was going to happen.</p><br/><p>However, Lin Fan wasn\u2019t going to reveal his trick.</p><br/><p>The townsfolk looked at Little Boss curiously, they didn\u2019t believe in his words.</p><br/><p>However, it didn\u2019t matter if they believed him or not. The fact was they were going to have twenty pieces of scallion pancakes. That was sufficient.</p><br/><p>In the shop.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian looked at Lin Fan who was busy making scallion pancakes. He asked curiously, \u201cYou Lan, what do you think is wrong with him today? Why did he start selling twenty scallion pancakes? In the past, an increment of twenty pancakes would\u2019ve killed him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I feel like something is wrong. Is Brother Lin up to something again? But it doesn\u2019t seem like it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang touched his chin, \u201cI think something is up. He must have something up his sleeve.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, Lin Fan was smiling before the cart, \u201cEveryone, it\u2019s a rare occasion, there will be twenty scallion pancakes today. Please queue up and do not miss this opportunity! You\u2019ll be satisfied.\u201d</p><br/><p>A townsfolk said, \u201cLittle Boss, if you really love us, make thirty pieces for us!\u201d</p><br/><p>The townsfolk were just making a casual remark. He knew that Little Boss wouldn\u2019t agree to it. However, they were stunned when Little Boss agreed to it.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, we\u2019ll have thirty pieces then,\u201d Lin Fan smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn! That\u2019s crazy!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Sun must have risen from the west today. Little Boss is going to sell thirty scallion pancakes!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c*cries* I\u2019m too touched. I knew that Little Boss is the best. He will always put us first.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, even Fraud Tian and the others were stunned. They were in complete disbelief. They knew what Little Boss was like. He was someone that always avoided trouble. Why did he agree to making thirty scallion pancakes?</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian went in front of Lin Fan and glared at him, \u201cYou must be the fake Little Boss.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled calmly, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? I\u2019m just returning the favor.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian was speechless. If he didn\u2019t know what Lin Fan was like, he might have believed his words.</p><br/><p>A few days later.</p><br/><p>Cloud Street became really lively. It was initially very crowded but there were even more people now. It was because Little Boss increased the limit of scallion pancakes to thirty pieces. It drove them wild.</p><br/><p>This was different from what they expected. It was crazy.</p><br/><p>The initial limit of ten pieces of scallion pancakes had already attracted a lot of people but the chances of them buying one were too low. However, it was different now. He sold thirty pieces of scallion pancakes for a few consecutive days. That greatly increased their chances of winning.</p><br/><p>That day.</p><br/><p>A lot of people queued outside the \u2018Master Lin\u2019 shop at Cloud Street. They were talking among themselves.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, it\u2019s pretty late. Why isn\u2019t Little Boss here yet?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, he should be here by now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone, hold up. Little Boss must be exhausted. Perhaps he just overslept. That\u2019s not a problem.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d</p><br/><p>However, Fraud Tian and the others had a bad feeling.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian said, \u201cWhy do I feel like this fella ran away again?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang gasped, \u201cI don\u2019t think he would run away.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian shook his head, \u201cIt\u2019s hard to tell. You guys should know this fella\u2019s tricks. Why would he sell thirty scallion pancakes for nothing? Something is wrong.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Lin Fan\u2019s loyal protector, Wu You Lan rebutted, \u201cIt can\u2019t be, Brother Lin must be doing something important.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn!\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Zhao Zhong Yang shouted after looking at Lin Fan\u2019s Weibo.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour boss really ran away. He went to Beijing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian was stunned, \u201cI knew it. This fella had something up his sleeve. If not, he wouldn\u2019t have been so nice. I told you! He really ran away.\u201d</p><br/><p>At the same time, Fraud Tian looked at the entrance which was filled with townsfolk. Now that Little Boss ran away, what were they going to do about it?</p><br/><p>If they didn\u2019t settle it properly, they\u2019d definitely be beaten up.</p><br/><p>At the airport!</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was smiling as he walked with his luggage. He sold thirty scallion pancakes for a few consecutive days. It had broken his own record. The townsfolk should forgive him for leaving for a few days.</p><br/><p>He felt that he was brilliant for coming up with that idea.</p><br/><p>Ding ding!</p><br/><p>Then, Zhao Ming Qing called him.</p><br/><p>When he picked up, there was a lot of background noise.</p><br/><p>\u201cMing Qing, what\u2019s wrong? Why is it so noisy?\u201d Lin Fan asked. Could something have happened? That couldn\u2019t be. When Ming Qing left, he read his fortune and he was safe. Nothing would go wrong during the trip.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing said anxiously, \u201cTeacher, the situation is like this. I met a group of foreign volunteers here in Yunnan. We are discussing the best treatment method to cure a patient\u2019s heart condition. The situation is a little unique. We can\u2019t reach a conclusion. I would like you to advise us\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>When he heard that, Lin Fan smiled. He didn\u2019t expect it to happen at all.</p><br/><p>He thought about it for a moment and knew that Zhao Ming Qing was definitely having a heated argument with the other party. If not, he would definitely not call him regarding this matter.</p><br/><p>The other party must have been an expert too to have challenged his disciple\u2019s thoughts.</p><br/><p>At Yunnan\u2019s mountainous region.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing and Di Jia Nuo were arguing with each other. Although they didn\u2019t know each other for long, they both had a common goal. Furthermore, their medical skills were superb. They were considered to have a deep friendship. When it was nighttime, the two of them would discuss about medical knowledge. Although one of them specialized in Chinese Medicine and the other specialized in Western Medicine, it didn\u2019t affect their conversations at all.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing waved his hand, \u201cElder Di, I won\u2019t argue with you any further. My mentor is an expert in both Chinese and Western medicine. He will give you the best solution.\u201d</p><br/><p>Di Jia Nuo gasped, \u201cGod, Elder Zhao, your Chinese medical skills are awesome. There\u2019s actually someone that\u2019s good enough to be your mentor?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing said proudly, \u201cMy mentor\u2019s medical skills are second to none. You\u2019ll find out in a second.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>There was still some time before the flight departure. Lin Fan had some time to answer Zhao Ming Qing\u2019s question.</p><br/><p>From the question that he asked, Lin Fan realized that his disciple\u2019s medical skills had improved greatly and rapidly. Perhaps even Zhao Ming Qing didn\u2019t realize it himself.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

I\u2019m finally back,\u201d Lin Fan said as he took a deep breath at the exit of the airport. He felt that the air was finally familiar to him. The trip to Kunlun Mountain was finally over.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m really exhausted. My bones feel like they\u2019re broken,\u201d Fraud Tian said as he stretched his muscles. He felt that Shanghai was still the best place to stay and he didn\u2019t want to move out for the time being.</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang moved towards Fraud Tian, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Do you not want to go to any other places?\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian rolled his eyes, \u201cWho said so? I\u2019m just going to take a break first. You\u2019re going to be in deep trouble after going back. You should think about what to do.\u201d</p><br/><p>After thinking about that, Zhao Zhong Yang was stunned. He felt that things were about to go out of hand.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t know why he had shouted those things. It was probably because he couldn\u2019t control his emotions.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan was smiling really happily. She felt that it had been a marvelous trip even though she hadn\u2019t climbed the Kunlun Mountain.</p><br/><p>Jiang Fei walked towards Lin Fan. \u201cPresident Lin, we will make a move now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded. \u201cAlright, you can head back first. I will go to the association to speak to President Niu tomorrow.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d Jiang Fei had been shocked by this trip to Kunlun Mountain. Initially, he had thought that the Shanghai association would go there just to make up the numbers. However, he was stunned that such a thing had happened.</p><br/><p>Everyone was probably going to be dumbfounded when they hear him report it to them.</p><br/><p>Jiang Fei and the others left the airport and headed back to the association by train.</p><br/><p>When they reached the entrance of the association, the members that returned from Kunlun Mountain felt as if they had returned as triumphant heroes.</p><br/><p>The members of the association were ecstatic when they saw Jiang Fei and the others.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey\u2019re back.\u201d</p><br/><p>They had seen how Master Lin had amazed everyone on Kunlun Mountain in the videos online. Their association was in the limelight and even reporters had come down to interview them yesterday. They were extremely proud.</p><br/><p>Some members rushed over and gathered there. As Jiang Fei and Wang Yun Jie were still around, they didn\u2019t dare to ask much.</p><br/><p>However, Jiang Fei and Wang Yun Jie wanted to rush to meet the President of the association and left hurriedly.</p><br/><p>Then, a youngster dragged a member of the Kunlun Mountain team aside and said, \u201cBro, tell me what happened. We were stunned by the news and video. You don\u2019t know how much it has blown up the past few days.\u201d</p><br/><p>The member laughed upon hearing that.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, it\u2019s difficult to explain. I believe all of you wouldn\u2019t even be able to imagine what happened.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s find a good spot for me to tell you more.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, they raised their heads in euphoria.</p><br/><p>If not for the association\u2019s selection, they wouldn\u2019t have been able to go to Kunlun Mountain.</p><br/><p>In the office.</p><br/><p>President Niu was looking at the news online. Although he was pretty old, he still had to keep himself updated with the latest news since he was the President of the association.</p><br/><p>Especially since the trip to Kunlun Mountain was so shocking and he needed to know what had happened.</p><br/><p>*Knock knock!*</p><br/><p>\u201cCome in,\u201d said President Niu. When he raised his head, he realized that it was Jiang Fei and Wang Yun Jie. Then, he smiled, \u201cYou\u2019re back?\u201d</p><br/><p>He sounded pretty excited.</p><br/><p>\u201cPresident, we\u2019re back. We\u2019re here to report the happenings,\u201d Jiang Fei said excitedly.</p><br/><p>The two of them dragged a chair each and sat down to explain the happenings at Kunlun Mountain.</p><br/><p>President Niu nodded as he heard them explain. Then, he looked at them in shock, \u201cYou mean the people there are recommending Master Lin to be the leader of the Martial Arts world?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Fei smiled, \u201cYeah. This time, our association is going to be in the headlines. These people will slowly join our association. President Lin feels that it would definitely benefit our association if these people join us.\u201d</p><br/><p>President Niu didn\u2019t know what to say. He had experienced a lot of things as the President throughout the years but he had still just been sent here by the headquarters after all.</p><br/><p>Perhaps that wasn\u2019t accurate enough. He had actually been kicked out of the headquarters to this association.</p><br/><p>After all, the Shanghai association used to be really run down. Although it was in the city, it had been in a poor condition and people felt that it wasn\u2019t worthy of being there.</p><br/><p>After developing it, the association had become better and Master Lin had become the Vice-President. The development of the association had become even better than before.</p><br/><p>Now that the real martial arts inheritors want to let Vice-President Lin be their leader, it was bound to be something big.</p><br/><p>\u201cTell me then, does it look like it will happen?\u201d President Niu asked.</p><br/><p>Jiang Fei smiled, \u201cYes. I am certain of it. President Lin said that he will help them to complete their different styles of martial arts. It wouldn\u2019t be a problem for them to take up the name of the association.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin said the most important thing is to let them join us. Then, we can invite them to major events and activities. This will definitely develop a good relationship between us and them. When that happens, they will start to come over voluntarily.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSometimes, I feel that Master Lin is really a genius. How could anyone think of this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Fei and Wang Yun Jie both looked like they were in awe whenever they spoke about Master Lin. Their admiration for Master Lin had increased even more after this incident.</p><br/><p>They felt really proud of their association in front of the other martial artists after what Master Lin had done.</p><br/><p>In the past, these people didn\u2019t hold associations like theirs in high regard. However, everything had changed because of Master Lin.</p><br/><p>The true master was the Vice-President of the association. How could they still disrespect the association?</p><br/><p>President Niu seemed excited. \u201cIf that\u2019s the case, we are going to rise in power.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, President Niu\u2019s phone rang.</p><br/><p>When he saw the caller ID, he furrowed his brows but he still picked up the phone.</p><br/><p>However, his facial expression changed after hanging up.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, President?\u201d Jiang Fei asked after seeing that.</p></div>\n</div>"}

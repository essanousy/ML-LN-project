He had only accumulated 118 points up until that day. Was it worth it to spend 100 Encyclopedic points on a matter that didn't even have a rat's a*s to do with him?</p><br/><p>Some people might have washed their hands off the matter because it wasn't any of their business. As the saying goes, as long as the knife does not stab you, it is never your business.</p><br/><p>But, Lin Fan also knew that when there was no justice, it was up to him to bring justice. Even though hacking might be breaking the law, he still had to look at the bigger issue of the situation.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan had no hesitation. He made up his mind. 100 Encyclopedic Points was worth it. It was worth upholding justice for a young lady. It was what officials should have been doing.</p><br/><p>Encyclopedic Points could still be slowly accumulated even after they run out, but right now, he needed to be righteous.</p><br/><p>When he rented this house, the landlord had been rather generous and had provided a computer. Although it was a little bit dated, it was still useable.</p><br/><p>Sitting in front of the computer, Lin Fan immediately spent the 100 Encyclopedic Points and got down to business, monitoring Jiang Li and Chen Juan.</p><br/><p>*click click*</p><br/><p>Lin Fan sat there without moving. He knew nothing about hacking, yet his hands were moving on their own, typing furiously on the keyboard. The display on the monitor kept changing, but he didn't understand a single thing on it. At last, the monitor displayed some English words. However, Lin Fan had not even sat for the Grade 3B English examination, so it was impossible for him to recognize any words. Despite all this, he still felt proud of himself.</p><br/><p>Window after window kept popping up on the screen, eventually filling the whole screen. At this moment, the computer started making random buzzing noises. It seemed that the computer was overloading. Lin Fan was afraid that this old computer was unable to handle all the processes that were on-going and might just explode.</p><br/><p>Not long after, a display popped up on the screen. The display showed the interior of a house. A conversation between a man and a woman could be heard. The conversation was about trivial matters and they didn't mention anything important.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan stared at the screen for nearly half an hour, but nothing major happened. He decided to take a shower before heading to sleep. He probably did not need to bother himself with the computer. After all, he had spent 100 Encyclopedic Points. The computer program should be able to take care of itself.</p><br/><p>This was like finding a needle in a haystack. The matter could only be resolved when the needle was found.</p><br/><p>The next day.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan woke up early. He took a look at the screen, which did not display any motion. However, there were breathing noises. It seemed that the computer program had hacked into a phone.</p><br/><p>He squatted there for awhile, but realized that he saw nothing that was of use. He then headed out to his shop.</p><br/><p>Even though the investigations were currently on-going, he didn't know how long more he had to wait. He figured that he should just slowly wait it out using his method.</p><br/><p>However, he had to rage post at least once every hour on Weibo everyday.</p><br/><p>Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan arrived at his shop. He finished his daily business then proceeded to take a rest there.</p><br/><p>Jiang Li and Chen Juan had posted a few statements. However, they were all superficial statements that just wanted to clear their names. What shocked Lin Fan was that in the comments section of Jiang Li and Chen Juan's Weibo, there were several rage posts from netizens, and the content in these posts was from Lin Fan's own post the day before.</p><br/><p>At the same time, there were many netizens re-posting Lin Fan's post from the day before on Weibo. Lin Fan was rather astonished. He felt that there was something fishy as they seemed to be from a group. However, he just let them do as they pleased as it didn't scare him one bit.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was lying there, with Elder Dog Nicholas in his embrace. Elder Dog was very quiet that day and just laid motionlessly on Lin Fan's leg as if he was tired from the day before and needed ample rest.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan enthusiastically looked through Weibo on her phone but was stunned for a moment. \"Master Lin! Go take a look at your Weibo! There are several celebrities teaming together to scold you!\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan opened his eyes. He took out his phone, not giving too much thought to what Wu You Lan had just said.</p><br/><p>There were many random netizens flaming him on his Weibo. However, he only went to read what the celebrities posted.</p><br/><p>He wouldn't have known if he hadn't seen it for himself. But once he knew, it was too much for him. There were several famous celebrities!</p><br/><p>Out of the many celebrities, there was one by the name of Yang Yue Chen, who was particularly famous for Chinese Soap Operas. Her reputation was very widespread and she had many fans. She made a post that had many re-posts by the netizens.</p><br/><p>Yang Yue Chen: \"Professor Chen Juan is my greatly respected teacher. I would never have imagined that ever since my graduation six years ago, she would be sabotaged like this by a few lowly beings, suffering such public nuisance. She's very academically skilled and has good teaching morals. Using my name, I can vouch for her that she would not commit such an act. At the same time, will the person by the name of Master Lin please stop demeaning Professor Chen Juan and raking up a fuss? If you mean business, you have to base it on your own abilities. But of course, looking at your Weibo, you are a self-proclaimed fortune-telling master. As everyone knows these days, we are a scientific fact-based society and fortune-telling is all but a phony. I hope you know your place and stop being a clown in the Internet community.\"</p><br/><p>\"Well said! I have always disliked that Master Lin. He's just a clown.\"</p><br/><p>\"Exactly! How can he say such things with no solid evidence? He doesn't have any brains. I think he just wants to hype himself up.\"</p><br/><p>\"What kind of fortune-telling master is he? I think he's just a fake. Everyone, please do not get scammed by this guy. I trust Yue Yue. I trust Professor Chen Juan.\"</p><br/><p>\"Bunch of dogs! Who are you all to slander Master Lin? He is someone of real capabilities, not someone you spineless clowns can judge.\"</p><br/><p>\"A brainless dog just posted above me. Everyone, be careful.\"</p><br/><p>Shortly after Yang Yue Chen's post on Weibo, many other hot-headed netizens posted on Weibo as well.</p><br/><p>Jiang Chen Yu was the angriest of the lot. He had acted in a number of movies and gained quite a large fanbase in the process.</p><br/><p>Jiang Chen Yu: \"My results were very poor before and I was also very introverted. With such circumstances, I wouldn't have survived long in the entertainment business. However, Teacher Jiang had faith in me. He coached and helped me along, frequently giving me many chances, which allowed me to slowly combat my introverted nature. Teacher Jiang is a great teacher. Please don't tarnish the reputation of these two great teachers over some mere discussion by random people. As for this 'Master Lin', I urge my fans, as well as friends on the Internet, to boycott him and the harmful impact the Internet has.\"</p><br/><p>\"Agreed! I agree\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"I will definitely support you!\"</p><br/><p>\"I will go and flame that bullsh*t Master Lin right now.\"</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>Lin Fan's power had been weakened by netizens ganging up on him, especially since it involved the influence of several currently popular celebrities. It was something that Lin Fan couldn't compare to. This lead to his Weibo being attacked by the fans.</p><br/><p>Even some of the netizens who followed Lin Fan turned their backs against him and started flaming him.</p><br/><p>\"Thinking about it last night, I feel that I might have been cheated by Master Lin. I have no connections with the victim, yet I cared more than anybody else. I think he just wants to ride on the outburst of this matter to hype himself up. I hope no one else gets cheated by him.\"</p><br/><p>\"Boycott this b*stard!\"</p><br/><p>\"Hehe, I don't even know what he has to do with this matter, so what rights do I have to scold him?\"</p><br/><p>\"Unfollow him! The truth of the matter is already out and he's still here scolding others. What's he trying to prove?\"</p><br/><p>\"I will unconditionally support Master Lin.\"</p><br/><p>\"The guy above me, are you a ret*rd? Are you here to dig your own grave?\"</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>Lin Fan didn't take any of these comments to heart. He continued to send out a Weibo post.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan: \"@YangYueChen @JiangChenYu @JiangLi @ChenJuan. What a bunch of idiots that sold their butts to get famous.\"</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan raised her head and shockingly said, \"Master Lin, are you trying to start an all-out war?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan blinked, then laughed.</p><br/><p>When Yang Yue Chen, Jiang Chen Yu, and several other celebrities saw this, they were enraged. One by one, they started commenting that they wanted to sue him.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan: \"Don't sue me. You are all my grandchildren\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Yang Yue Chen: \"...\"</p><br/><p>Jiang Chen Yu: \"...\"</p><br/><p>Netizens: \"...\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

However, he was really happy, and the strangers that saw him smile to himself all thought that he was crazy.</p><br/><p>Also, someone had even tried to call the police after thinking that he had abducted someone\u2019s kid.</p><br/><p>However, when the police had come, they had found out that he was the one that Master Lin had agreed on saving.</p><br/><p>The policemen had agreed to send him and his daughter to Shanghai.</p><br/><p>After arriving there, the policemen had left immediately.</p><br/><p>As he walked around Cloud Street, Zhang Yi Jun tried to avoid coming into contact with people, as he was afraid that people would despise him. However, everyone acted normally towards him. They were not afraid of his daughter at all.</p><br/><p>Then, a youngster asked, \u201cWho is this man?\u201d</p><br/><p>The person beside him answered, \u201cHe is the father of the girl who has AIDS.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh? AIDS\u2026\u201d The youngster shouted and his expression changed upon hearing that. However, someone covered his mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you doing? Shut up.\u201d</p><br/><p>The youngster looked at the little girl who was looking around cluelessly. He immediately became quiet. \u201cSorry, I was too agitated.\u201d</p><br/><p>The people around her did not move at all. They did not show any signs of fear. Someone went forward to pat Zhang Yi Jun\u2019s shoulder.</p><br/><p>\u201cBro, don\u2019t worry. Master Lin will help you and it will be okay.\u201d</p><br/><p>The man who patted his shoulder did it out of courage. He knew that simple contact like this would not transmit the illness. However, he was actually still afraid of the little girl.</p><br/><p>The reporters immediately turned their cameras to the little girl. Although she was suffering from AIDS, they remained calm and did not show any signs of fear.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan came forward and smiled. \u201cYou\u2019re here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly!</p><br/><p>Zhang Yi Jun kneeled before him. \u201cMaster Lin, thank you so much.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you doing? Stand up, you don\u2019t have to do this.\u201d Lin Fan immediately helped him up and patted the little girl\u2019s head. \u201cYou are four years old?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yuan Yuan nodded. \u201cYes, I am four.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled, \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYuan Yuan.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan immediately embraced her without any hesitation.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, I\u2019ll carry her.\u201d Zhang Yi Jun knew that his daughter had AIDS, and he was touched that Lin Fan dared to hug her.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, I can do it.\u201d</p><br/><p>The townsfolk sighed after watching what had happened. They felt sorry for her situation.</p><br/><p>However, they were really impressed by Master Lin\u2019s actions.</p><br/><p>\u201cYuan Yuan, you will be here with me for the next few days, okay? I will help to cure your illness!\u201d Lin Fan chuckled. Then, he did some preliminary checks on her.</p><br/><p>If he used the mystical boost of the Encyclopedia along with the Wuxia knowledge that he had, he would be able to cure her immediately.</p><br/><p>However, he needed time to come up with the medicine to cure her. Although it was difficult, it was not impossible.</p><br/><p>Yuan Yuan nodded,.\u201dOkay. My dad told me to listen to you for the next few days.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so sensible.\u201d Lin Fan patted her head again.</p><br/><p>The reporters surrounded Zhang Yi Jun and asked him a few questions. Zhang Yi Jun just hoped that Master Lin could cure his daughter. He did not even think about bearing any grudges if Lin Fan could not cure her.</p><br/><p>He was really grateful for Master Lin.</p><br/><p>The reporters asked, \u201cMaster Lin, when will you start?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan answered, \u201cProbably in the afternoon. I don\u2019t want to waste time. I have to prepare some things in the morning first to be fully equipped with what I need.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, we wish you all the best.\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporters sincerely wished that Master Lin would be successful. It was not only for the little girl. It was also because they knew Master Lin for a long time, and they were really supportive of him.</p><br/><p>At Shanghai\u2019s Chinese Medical Academy.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan sent Yuan Yuan there and arranged for Zhang Yi Jun to live in the school\u2019s dormitory.</p><br/><p>After settling that, he went to prepare the tools and materials that he needed before officially starting on his work.</p><br/><p>In the afternoon.</p><br/><p>A lot of people gathered in front of the academy. The shop owners of Cloud Street closed their shops earlier, as they wanted to watch Master Lin officially begin his work before leaving.</p><br/><p>Their main supplier of chinese medicine provided Lin Fan and Zhao Ming Qing with the things that they needed. At the same time, they sold the things that cured leukemia at the same price as before. Hence, they were very popular among the townsfolk too.</p><br/><p>He arranged for his workers to leave the things in the laboratories.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, I\u2019ve prepared everything for you. They are all of the best quality. I asked my workers to select the best ones for you, so there should be no problem at all. If you need anything more, just let me know.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shook his hand. \u201cThank you so much. All the things have been prepared, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. Nothing is lacking,\u201d the manufacturer replied. He was really impressed by Master Lin, and he felt that Master Lin was like a god.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing stood beside him and took a deep breath before preparing for work. He knew that it was going to take a long time before they could come up with a perfect solution.</p><br/><p>However, he was not going to give up. He wanted to do his best.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Zhao, all the best,\u201d the manufacturer said.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing chuckled, \u201cI\u2019m fine. My mentor should be the one that needs all the luck and support.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, an ambulance arrived outside the academy. Nobody knew who had called it, but it was stationed outside in case any emergency happened.</p><br/><p>\u201cBro\u2026\u201d Wang Ming Yang rushed over.</p><br/><p>He was carrying a huge box.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan asked, \u201cWhy are you here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang was really anxious. \u201cHow can I not be here? I prepared these for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d Lin Fan was stunned after looking at the box. He wondered what was in it.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang replied, \u201cIt\u2019s an antidote that I prepared. Remember, if any of your wounds touch her blood, you have to consume it within two hours. Please remember that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at Wang Ming Yang. \u201cBro, do you think I\u2019m unaware of the usage of this medicine?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s just in case. I bought enough supplies to last you a month.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan patted Wang Ming Yang\u2019s shoulder. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, nothing will go wrong. Alright, we will be heading in. You should leave.\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

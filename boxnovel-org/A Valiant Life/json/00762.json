He didn\u2019t expect He Xiao Li to be someone like that.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, what\u2019s the situation like now?\u201d Zhao Ming Qing couldn\u2019t hear what they were saying but he could tell that the situation wasn\u2019t good.</p><br/><p>He was infuriated when he saw those things brought by the mute uncle being thrown on the floor.</p><br/><p>He wanted to beat the fella up but was stopped by his teacher.</p><br/><p>\u201cGet off the car,\u201d Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>In the distance.</p><br/><p>The mute uncle looked at his daughter until her silhouette disappeared. He was still waving goodbye to her. It was as if he could tell that his daughter was living a happy life and he wasn\u2019t worried at all.</p><br/><p>In the building.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Li, who is that uncle?\u201d Her colleague asked curiously.</p><br/><p>He Xiao Li hesitated for a moment, \u201cA relative from my hometown.\u201d</p><br/><p>Her colleague asked, \u201cWhy would you have a relative like him? He\u2019s dressed like a beggar. He must be here to depend on you. Let me tell you, there are a lot of relatives like this and you can\u2019t be too nice to them. You\u2019re still nice. You gave him so much money. It\u2019s not worth it!\u201d</p><br/><p>He Xiao Li remained silent. She just lowered her head in sadness. However, when she thought of her current situation, she knew that she couldn\u2019t admit it.</p><br/><p>Because she didn\u2019t want people to make fun of her.</p><br/><p>She turned around and wanted to see the situation outside but she was blocked by a wall. Then, she took a deep breath and didn\u2019t think too much about it.</p><br/><p>Outside.</p><br/><p>The mute uncle saw that the silhouette had disappeared and looked at the melon seeds on the floor. Then, he bent down to pick them up before blowing the dust off the seeds.</p><br/><p>\u201cOld man, who the hell are you? Do you know that I\u2019ve been trying to chase He Xiao Li for a long time? It was all ruined by you,\u201d said a man that was holding a bouquet of flowers as he walked towards the mute uncle.</p><br/><p>The mute uncle looked at him and shook his head in anger when he heard that this man was trying to win the heart of his daughter. It was as if he disapproved it.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat kind of expression are you making? You better not appear here in the future. If not, I\u2019ll teach you a lesson. Do you hear me?\u201d The man said angrily.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026 Ah,\u201d The mute uncle said unhappily but he still lowered his head and picked up the seeds.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you picking them up? It\u2019s just rubbish.\u201d The man started stepping on the melon seeds and the seeds became powder.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh.\u201d The mute uncle grabbed the man\u2019s leg and wanted him to stop stepping on the melon seeds.</p><br/><p>\u201cHa, you\u2019re such a joke,\u201d the man laughed. He didn\u2019t expect someone like him to exist. He treated a bag of melon seeds like precious gold. Then, he continued stepping on them in rage.</p><br/><p>If not for the appearance of this old man, he wouldn\u2019t have failed.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll destroy all your melon seeds and then I\u2019m going to see how you\u2019re going to pick them up,\u201d the man laughed as he stomped on the seeds.</p><br/><p>Suddenly!</p><br/><p>*Slap*</p><br/><p>The man got slapped and he collapsed to the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhich blind man dared to slap me?!\u201d The man shouted as he looked at the person in front of him.</p><br/><p>However, when he saw who the person was, he was stunned.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin\u2026\u201d He didn\u2019t expect the person that slapped him to be Master Lin.</p><br/><p>In Shanghai, most people knew who Master Lin was.</p><br/><p>Especially the wealthy younger generation knew about the power of Master Lin.</p><br/><p>When they were bragging about things, they would definitely talk about Master Lin. An average citizen would only know that Master Lin was a just and happy person.</p><br/><p>However, they knew how incredible Master Lin was.</p><br/><p>The Qingzhou incident was just a talking point for most citizens.</p><br/><p>However, they understood how significant it was. Especially when Ma Qingzhou was a terrifying figure.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, Master Lin was popular in the groups of the wealthy youngsters in Shanghai. He had a lot of friends and even their fathers wanted to join the groups to befriend Master Lin.</p><br/><p>However, the groups weren\u2019t easy to enter as the foundation had already been fixed.</p><br/><p>For example, He Cheng Han who used to be an ordinary wealthy man had a totally different status now.</p><br/><p>Their group had become really famous.</p><br/><p>According to the people in the group, they treated each other like family and wanted to earn money together.</p><br/><p>The trustworthiness of the group made a lot of wealthy youngsters really envious of it.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, you know me, right?\u201d Lin Fan asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, yes.\u201d The man was in fear.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan didn\u2019t want to say anything much, \u201cPick them all up.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, I\u2019ll pick them up now.\u201d The arrogant man became really obedient.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan didn\u2019t need to do anything. His mere presence was sufficient to make the man move.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing tried to console the mute uncle but he didn\u2019t know what to say.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, the man was trembling with fear. He didn\u2019t know how he managed to infuriate Master Lin.</p><br/><p>If his dad were to find out about it, he would definitely skin him alive. Especially if he were to find out that his son bullied someone. It would be disastrous.</p><br/><p>After a moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, I\u2019ve picked them up,\u201d the man said.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at him, \u201cWhy did you bully him?\u201d</p><br/><p>The man was about to cry, \u201cMaster Lin, I really didn\u2019t know that you know him. If I had known, I wouldn\u2019t have dared to do so.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, you\u2019re saying that you\u2019d have dared to bully him if I didn\u2019t know him?\u201d Lin Fan asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2026 That.\u201d Wang Chen didn\u2019t know how to reply. He was at a loss and he looked remorseful.</p><br/><p>He was exceptionally unlucky that day.</p><br/><p>He encountered an annoying old man and Master Lin.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, he didn\u2019t dare to do anything else.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk to you anymore. You stepped on these seeds. Now, just lick the floor clean and get lost,\u201d Lin Fan said calmly.</p><br/><p>It was as if he was making a normal request.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Wang Chen looked at Lin Fan in shock. He didn\u2019t expect Master Lin to have asked him to lick the floor clean. How could that be?</p><br/><p>He was clearly trying to bully him.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it? Do you have something to say? I\u2019ll give you three seconds to consider. I don\u2019t mind speaking to your dad about this. If he agrees, you don\u2019t have to lick it. I don\u2019t mind you cycling every day. Furthermore, you might not even have a bicycle,\u201d Lin Fan said calmly. However, when Wang Chen heard that, he was deeply affected.</p><br/><p>If someone else had said that, he definitely wouldn\u2019t have believed it.</p><br/><p>However, since Master Lin was the one who said it, he believed it.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t doubt anything that he said.</p><br/><p>If Master Lin really wanted to make things difficult for him, he would really be unable to handle it.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll lick it.\u201d Wang Chen didn\u2019t hesitate at all. He immediately closed his eyes and ignored the surroundings. He started to lick the floor.</p><br/><p>He licked the floor really quickly and the speed was frightening.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, I\u2019ve licked the floor clean.\u201d Wang Chen felt as if his tongue was numb. His mouth was probably filled with dust.</p><br/><p>\u201cGet lost.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Chen heaved a sigh of relief and ran towards his car without any hesitation.</p><br/><p>He disappeared in an instant.</p></div>\n</div>"}

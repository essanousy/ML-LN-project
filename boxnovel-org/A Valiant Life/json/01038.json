The voice was not very recognizable but it had some excitement in it.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Lin,\u201d Huang Ting shouted from the doorway.</p><br/><p>At the same time, Huang Yun Ge looked at all these uncles and aunties and felt a little helpless inside. To him, they were all peasants so his dad was going to be in for some trouble.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan\u2019s father abruptly looked towards the door. When he saw the man, who had a little bit of a plump face, had his hair combed back, and was a little short in stature, he immediately said with astonishment, \u201cWow, Elder Ting! Even you have come. It seems like we are at full strength right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha,\u201d Huang Ting laughed. \u201cIt\u2019s great that everyone is here. The moment you mentioned in the group that you were celebrating your 50th birthday, I knew I had to come.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI got you a gift, come and take a look at it. Do you like it? I remember that when we were still schooling, this was the watch that you really wanted.\u201d</p><br/><p>Huang Ting opened up the gift box and took out the watch. Then, he placed the watch on Elder Lin\u2019s wrist and said, \u201cLook, I knew that you would definitely have put on some weight. The watch is just right for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>His classmates all gathered around and were all filled with envy the moment they saw that branded watch. Someone exclaimed, \u201cIt\u2019s a Longines watch! It\u2019s really expensive.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI think it must have cost a few thousand dollars.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems that Elder Ting is as generous as always.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan\u2019s father looked at the watch and said, \u201cElder Ting, this is really too precious. As long as you guys come, that\u2019s enough to make me happy. Why did you go out and buy such an expensive gift?\u201d</p><br/><p>Huang Yun Ge was standing behind and laughing. When he heard those words, he felt this person was a little fake. However, since it was his father\u2019s classmate, he did not dare to say anything.</p><br/><p>In his eyes, his dad was a spendthrift and a little foolish.</p><br/><p>Huang Ting laughed and said, \u201cIt\u2019s the thought that counts. Last time in school, when I was getting beaten up by other people, no one else came to help me but you rushed up and saved me. You probably lost that tooth because of me, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha,\u201d Lin Fan\u2019s father laughed. \u201cI didn\u2019t ask you for anything in return. Also, the fillings for my teeth have all been done already. However, the important thing is that everyone is here. That really makes me so happy.\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, Huang Ting scanned his surroundings and looked at all his former classmates. They all looked a little foreign to him. Besides Elder Lin, who had he played around with a bit more so he remembered, after all these years and after all the changes they had gone through, they did not look so familiar anymore.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Ting. Wait, no, I should say Chief Huang. Do you remember me? I\u2019m Zhang Hao. I did a report for you before,\u201d a fat middle-aged man said.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, Elder Zhang, I remember you. It\u2019s been a while. Don\u2019t call me Chief Huang. Elder Ting is enough,\u201d Wang Ting said with a smile as he extended his hand out.</p><br/><p>Zhang Hao felt very overwhelmed to be recognized by him. Even his waist became a little bent as he grabbed his hand.</p><br/><p>After that, the surrounding people all stepped forward to shake hands with Huang Ting. At the same time, they all took out their phones to exchange phone numbers with him.</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan saw everything that was unfolding in front of his eyes, he started to laugh. It seemed like his father had been completely forgotten by everyone.</p><br/><p>He had the same train of thought as his mother. He had not spoken to his classmates in such a long time. Now, for all of them to suddenly come down was extremely weird. From what he saw, it seemed like his mother had been right. It appeared that pretty much all of them were here just because this Huang Ting guy was here.</p><br/><p>However, this Huang Ting was a good person and he had a genuine friendship with his father. If this man were to come in front of his father and act arrogantly, Lin Fan really did not mind going up to him and telling him off.</p><br/><p>Huang Ting sighed inside, waved them off and said, \u201cOkay, my dear classmates, the star of the show today is Elder Lin, so if you guys have anything to discuss, we can have a good chat about it later. Elder Lin is turning 50 today so we have to make him happy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Elder Ting is right.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cToday is Elder Lin\u2019s birthday after all.\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Ting\u2019s statement brought about a response from everyone. In an instant, everyone rushed to agree with him.</p><br/><p>Then, everyone\u2019s gaze shifted to the young man standing behind Huang Ting. To them, this young man had a very peculiar way of dressing. He was clearly a guy but he was wearing earrings. Also, he stood there with his head looking up and looking all over the place.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Ting, this is your son?\u201d</p><br/><p>Huang Ting looked at his son. Then he glared at him and said, \u201cStand properly. Quickly come over here and greet these aunties and uncles.\u201d</p><br/><p>Huang Yun Ge sighed and very casually and lethargically said, \u201cGreetings, dear aunties and uncles, my name is Huang Yun Ge, your classmate\u2019s son.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHave you not eaten yet?\u201d Huang Ting said with a hint of anger in his voice. Naturally, he knew what his son was like. However, his classmates were here and yet his own son still dared to act like this. It really made him wonder what his son was trying to do by behaving like this.</p><br/><p>However, the surrounding people did not wait for Huang Yun Ge to say anything before they all erupted with praise.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Ting, your son is really very good looking.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. It looks like he is very well educated and his sense of fashion is great.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, we are all old already. We definitely can\u2019t compare our time to this current generation.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Ting, does your son have a girlfriend already?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe fact that Elder Ting\u2019s son is like that really makes me envious. If only my son was as handsome as him, then I wouldn\u2019t have to worry about him finding a wife.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, yes.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan saw his own father\u2019s face which was filled with helplessness, he started laughing inside. Then, he took out his phone and saw that Bai Ke was calling him. Thus, he excused himself and went to answer the call.</p><br/><p>Huang Ting let out a few coughs. He felt like all of this was not right. It was Elder Lin\u2019s birthday today, so what was all of this going on?</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Lin, which floor is the banquet at? Let\u2019s head up,\u201d Elder Ting said, \u201cLet\u2019s find a proper setting to gather together.\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Lin laughed and said, \u201cOkay, you were the last one that we were waiting for. Come, I\u2019ll bring you guys upstairs.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, he looked around and realized that his son had disappeared. He did not give it much thought and just went ahead to bring everyone upstairs.</p><br/><p>The lift door opened up and immediately, some of them rushed to hold the door.</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter you, Elder Ting.\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Ting declined to be the first to enter the lift and said, \u201cCome, after you Elder Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Lin smiled and replied, \u201cHow polite of you.\u201d</p><br/><p>In the lift.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Ting, what is your son doing now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Ting replied, \u201cHe doesn\u2019t really have any prospects now so I\u2019m making arrangements for him to come and work in my office to get some experience.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow can you say that he has no prospects? Your company is such a big company, it\u2019s nothing something that any ordinary person can get into.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, Elder Lin, what is your son doing?\u201d someone asked.</p><br/><p>Elder Lin smiled and said, \u201cHe\u2019s in Shanghai. Ever since he graduated, he\u2019s been staying there.\u201d</p><br/><p>Huang Yun Ge laughed and said, \u201cI have a lot of friends in Shanghai. The competition there is tough so if he ever gets into any trouble, he can come and find me and I\u2019ll give them a call. My friends over there are all very powerful. They are the sons of high officials, all very powerful and with a lot of influence.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKeep quiet,\u201d Huang Ting glared at his loud mouth son and said. Then, he turned around and looked at everyone. He laughed and said, \u201cThis youngster just loiters around all day. The friends that he has made were all picked up from wandering around.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDad, what do you mean just wandering around? My friends all don\u2019t need to work at all. They have an endless source of money at home,\u201d Huang Yun Ge refuted.</p><br/><p>To the rest of them, hearing such things was a huge psychological shock.</p><br/><p><em>An endless source of money.</em></p></div>\n</div>"}

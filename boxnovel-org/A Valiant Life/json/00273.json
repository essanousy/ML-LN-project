Taking that little lady as an example, she was really beautiful. At its most basic level, her facial features were simply pleasing to look at, which meant her fortune was good.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan agreed with that. After all, which beautiful lady would be living in the slums, gnawing on a radish?</p><br/><p>As for the males, he could forget about it. The handsome ones could be Yin or Yang, good or bad. It wasn't easy to say.</p><br/><p>But to put it bluntly, this was a world where appearances mattered.</p><br/><p>F*ck!</p><br/><p>Suddenly, he saw a man who looked very weird and ugly. Then, Lin Fan opened the Encyclopedia in his mind, because when he obtained the Encyclopedia, on the page about fortune-telling, there was a description of common types of faces. But there was also a part with examples of more unique facial features.</p><br/><p>Jack Ma?</p><br/><p>Who's that guy?</p><br/><p>Lin Fan didn't know, but he was in the fortune-telling knowledge page.</p><br/><p>\"A person with exposed eyes and thick and bushy eyebrows. His wicked appearance masks the light within. Although his eyebrows are thick, hidden within are colorful elegance and genuineness.\"</p><br/><p>He didn't understand these lines but there was an explanation behind. It stated in layman's terms that the above meant, \"Bulging eyes, thick brows, and a big skeletal frame. Appears ugly but although his eyes and protruding, they have a mysterious reservedness to them and although his eyebrows are thick, their glossiness hides an inner luster. This is an odd appearance but not an ugly one.\"</p><br/><p>Eye-opening.</p><br/><p>Simply eye-opening.</p><br/><p>The man Lin Fan saw looked very similar to the Encyclopedia's Jack Ma. It seemed like they had some mysterious affiliation.</p><br/><p>Then, Lin Fan continued to observe, carefully, each of the wealthy and noble faces in the room. He had to admit that it was eye-opening.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Lin Fan saw a shining white and seemingly bottomless valley before him. He couldn't help but exclaim.</p><br/><p>\"Good breasts!\"</p><br/><p>Then, he looked up in a daze. In front of him, that lady named Zhu Zhu was holding a wine glass. She stood in front of him with a face full of smiles. \"What are you looking at, Handsome?\"</p><br/><p>Zhu Zhu sat next to Lin Fan, smiling cheerily. Those eyes seemed electrifying as they stayed fixated on Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed awkwardly, \"Nothing much. Just looking at your physiognomy.\"</p><br/><p>Zhu Zhu was surprised. She smiled and said, \"Handsome, you know how to judge one's physiognomy?\"</p><br/><p>\"Just a little bit,\" said Lin Fan with a smile.</p><br/><p>Zhu Zhu's beautiful gaze moved. She had some intentions. She yelled to the several ladies at the side, \"Ladies, come over here. This handsome man says he knows how to judge one's physiognomy. Let's have this handsome man take a good look for us today.\"</p><br/><p>The men in the middle of their conversation shifted their gaze over as well. They were curious.</p><br/><p>\"Wang Ming Yang's friend knows physiognomy? Shall we go take a look?\"</p><br/><p>\"That's a good idea. We're chatting so happily while that Ming Yang just dumped his friend over there. We should go and support him so he won't be too embarrassed.\"</p><br/><p>Zhu Zhu looked at those men and smiled charmingly. \"What are you all coming here for? The ladies and I are having Handsome here judge our physiognomy for us.\"</p><br/><p>One of the men said, \"Why can't we come? We want to take a look too.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the situation around him and blinked innocently. What are you trying to do, brothers? I'm just casually judging your facial appearances. There's no need for you to all gather here.</p><br/><p>These were all wealthy people. Birds of a feather, flock together. Wang Ming Yang's friends were all wealthy businessmen, either that or the children of wealthy families. If they were to do a ranking, Lin Fan might just be the poorest.</p><br/><p>\"I'm Li Hao, a friend of Brother Wang's. Brother Wang says you're f*cking awesome, so I'm a little curious.\" Li Hao was the son of an official. He had known Wang Ming Yang for about two years. Although he was quite a proud and cold person, he was still friendly to Brother Wang's friends.</p><br/><p>However, because Lin Fan had been boasted about by Wang Ming Yang so much, Li Hao was rather curious.</p><br/><p>The other few men were all thirty or forty over years old. They were all pretty accomplished. They were all smiles and didn't think much of this situation. They felt that Wang Ming Yang's bragging from before had been overboard.</p><br/><p>Zhu Zhu was of a young age and she never needed to worry about food or clothes, because she was the daughter of a wealthy family. At that moment, she waved her hand indifferently and said, \"You all should move away quickly. This little handsome man doesn't want to talk to you and he's going to read my fortune. Brother Ming Yang wouldn't normally brag about someone so seriously. You said that you were just looking at my physiognomy. Well, what does it say about me?\"</p><br/><p>Li Hao laughed, \"Sister Zhu, don't make things difficult for him. Things like physiognomy can't be trusted.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled and replied, \"That's not always true.\"</p><br/><p>Li Hao was surprised. He smiled thinly and said, \"It isn't always true? I don't believe that.\"</p><br/><p>Zhu Zhu laughed as she said, \"If you don't believe it, then why are you all gathered here? I believe it. And I'm looking for Handsome to read my physiognomy.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at Zhu Zhu and smiled. \"My dear beautiful lady Zhu Zhu, you have to think this through. My readings are very accurate. And judging from what I see, the results of my readings aren't so pleasant. Don't be angry if I tell you.\"</p><br/><p>Zhu Zhu pursed her lips and smiled, \"Tell me, Handsome. I promise I won't get angry.\"</p><br/><p>The beautiful ladies at the side were all giggling as well. \"Our Zhu Zhu is the most easy-going person you'll ever meet. She takes everything lightly, so she surely won't get angry.\"</p><br/><p>Li Hao was very curious as well. \"Tell us, Handsome. I guarantee that Sister Zhu won't get angry. And it wouldn't matter even if she got angry. If she dares to treat you badly, Brother Ming Yang would lose his temper. That would be truly scary.</p><br/><p>\"Handsome, I'm getting really curious. Hurry up and do the reading,\" said Zhu Zhu.</p><br/><p>The men standing at the side started smiling. They didn't believe it, of course. But they didn't try to expose Lin Fan either. After all, he was a friend of Wang Ming Yang's. As the saying goes, it wasn't for the sake of the monk, but for the sake of the Buddha. It was a Salon Night Party after all. Everyone was just there to have fun.</p><br/><p>\"You really want me to say it?\" Lin Fan said with a grin.</p><br/><p>At times, one had to show his skills a little. As for being humble and what not, it depended on the situation as well.</p><br/><p>\"Say it! I really wanna know. If what you say is accurate, I'll agree to do you a favor,\" said Zhu Zhu with her seductive gaze fixated on Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>However, she didn't know that in Lin Fan's eyes, she had nowhere to hide. She had stopped in her tracks.</p><br/><p>\"Then I'm really going to say it,\" Lin Fan said once more.</p><br/><p>\"Say it.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan observed her carefully and said, \"Sister Zhu lives boldly and unrestrainedly but these days, you should restrict yourself. Although you have many boyfriends, you have to take care of your own body as well.\"</p><br/><p>Er\u2026</p><br/><p>Suddenly, everyone was stunned.</p><br/><p>Zhu Zhu was stunned as well. Then, she burst out laughing, \"Handsome, this is what you saw from my physiognomy? People who know me all know that I change boyfriends faster than I change clothes. If it's just this, it doesn't count as much.\"</p><br/><p>Li Hao laughed, \"Brother Ming probably told him to say this beforehand so you'll be a bit more careful, Sister Zhu. After all, Sister Zhu is a killer of every kind of man. As long as she sees a man before her, she won't let him go.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled, then said to Li Hao, \"Your physiognomy is not bad. To have a son at such a young age. But judging from your facial features, your marriage is rather bumpy. You have a son but not a spouse. It seems like you're still in a stage of suspicion. I suggest you go and check on her.\"</p><br/><p>Li Hao, who had been smiling all along, was now dumbfounded. His eyes opened wide as if he had seen a ghost.</p><br/><p>A middle-aged man at the side laughed, \"That can't be right, Li Hao has always been single. If that was true, then it'd be a cause for celebration. His dad won't have to keep urging him anymore.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan turned his gaze again, this time to the middle-aged man. \"Jin Yun Min, your luck in wealth is not bad, but it hasn't been good recently. I think you probably just lost a sum of money. Not a big sum but not a small sum either.\"</p><br/><p>\"This beautiful lady's physiognomy is not bad either. But you should take notice of your parents' situation. Judging from the looks of things, conflicting views will occur between your parents sometime soon.\"</p><br/><p>\"You\u2026\"</p><br/><p>A crowd surrounded Lin Fan and Lin Fan read out their fortunes one by one.</p><br/><p>At the end, Lin Fan laughed embarrassedly, then said humbly, \"Just a little show of skill. It may not be very accurate. Please don't think too much of what I've said.\"</p><br/><p>But at that moment, the people surrounding Lin Fan all had their mouths gaping. They were all frozen in shock as if they had all seen ghosts.</p><br/><p>How is that not f*cking accurate?</p><br/><p>He seems to know about everything that has happened to us.</p><br/><p>F*ck!</p><br/><p>F*cking awesome!</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang wasn't exaggerating at all. This guy is way too f*cking awesome!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

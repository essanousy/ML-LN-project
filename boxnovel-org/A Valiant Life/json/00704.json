What right does he have to stop us? Is his guess enough to stop us?\u201d</p><br/><p>Regarding his own life, Wang Cheng Shan wasn\u2019t about to stop. However, at the Children\u2019s Welfare Institute, Lin Fan was rather ardent but they originally planned to take Lil\u2019 Fatty away by force.</p><br/><p>At that moment, they suddenly had a change of heart.</p><br/><p>A person with a tall stature stood at the side, observing silently. At that moment, he took action, ripping open his top wear, revealing a ripped body which would have instilled fear into anyone. He turned his gaze to the couple, his intentions clear- if you didn\u2019t leave, I\u2019ll beat the daylights out of you.</p><br/><p>As an MMA fighter, his figure was formidable and his muscles were bulging out. Anyone who saw it would definitely have trembled in fear.</p><br/><p>What they didn\u2019t know was that Han Lu didn\u2019t want them to court death. Master Lin\u2019s martial arts abilities weren\u2019t well known but Han Lu knew them full well. Although he looked skinny and weak, his body packed more power than skill than he could ever dream of.</p><br/><p>One punch, one kill.</p><br/><p>Qiu Yan Lan was also seething with rage. \u201cYou are his Uncle, and you\u2019re sick and need his help. As your nephew, he should be helping you. That police officer is also such a prat. One look and I can tell that both of them are in cahoots. No, this cannot be! We must expose him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExpose him?\u201d Wang Cheng Shan didn\u2019t think that far. All he ever thought was how to get Lil\u2019 Fatty to come with them, but after hearing what his wife said, his curiosity was piqued.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, expose him. Let us report this to the journalists and tell everyone that Nanshan Children\u2019s Welfare Institute doesn\u2019t release their children even to blood relatives. On what grounds does he have to reject us? There definitely us a secret that they are hiding,\u201d Qiu Yan Lan said, her voice full of anger.</p><br/><p>Wang Cheng Shan gave a twisted smile after hearing her plan. \u201cNot bad. The press has quite a lot of power. We should expose him for not letting relatives adopt orphaned children. This is against the law!\u201d</p><br/><p>After making their plans, both of them rushed to the newspaper agency. In Shanghai, there was no lack of journalists.</p><br/><p>They wanted to make a ruckus and wanted them to apologize, and more than ever, they wanted to make the Children\u2019s Welfare Institute pay.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Children\u2019s Welfare Institute.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan wasn\u2019t happy at all. He never imagined that this kind of relatives existed. Although the other party didn\u2019t admit it, he believed that his guess based on his fortune telling and medical skills were accurate.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan could tell that Wang Cheng Shan leukemia, and from his fortune telling skills perspective, this person didn\u2019t have a good heart. When he looked at Lil\u2019 Fatty, it showed a lot of different outcomes which weren\u2019t good.</p><br/><p>One of the outcomes was especially terrible. If Lil\u2019 Fatty had followed them back, the outcome would have been gruesome beyond words.</p><br/><p>Although fortune-telling wasn\u2019t able to discern the full picture, Lin Fan could still speculate and extrapolate to gain understanding.</p><br/><p>He wanted to treat his leukemia and there was only the option of a bone marrow transplant. What Lin Fan saw was that Lil\u2019 Fatty would be taken away and his destiny would change. There was only one possible explanation, and that was Lil\u2019 Fatty being incompatible with his Uncle, but the Uncle couldn\u2019t send him back to the orphanage. And so, it would be inevitable for Lil\u2019 Fatty to be abused and scolded.</p><br/><p>A little guessing would go a long way.</p><br/><p>Normal people would just bring Lil\u2019 Fatty to the hospital and if he was incompatible, they could just tell the truth and get on with their lives.</p><br/><p>That was one way to solve the problem thoroughly.</p><br/><p>But, was Lin Fan a normal person?</p><br/><p>His mind was different from the rest.</p><br/><p>Why did they have to go? If they went, they would just be getting their hopes up and thereafter have their hopes completely crushed.</p><br/><p>Director Huang was a little unsettled. \u201cMaster Lin, was what you said true?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded his head, \u201cAbout there. If Lil\u2019 Fatty left with them, he would have a miserable life.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen don\u2019t let them take him away. Lil\u2019 Fatty can remain here,\u201d Director Huang said.</p><br/><p>Han Lu was still annoyed. \u201cIf what Master Lin said was true, I would love to beat them up.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved his hands. \u201cAlright, there isn\u2019t a problem here. Punching and kicking people won\u2019t do anyone any good. That couple will definitely be back but we don\u2019t have to entertain them. As long as you and I are around, there won\u2019t be a problem.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lil\u2019 Fatty\u2019s face was swollen from all the crying. Xiao Hong Hong and Xiao Hua Hua were both consoling Lil\u2019 Fatty.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Fatty, please don\u2019t cry.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYea, you must be strong.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Lin Fan patted Lil\u2019 Fatty on his head. \u201cLil\u2019 Fatty, did you see what just happened? Uncle Lin just defeated another enemy. Next time you have to be a little more sincere and help people when they are in trouble, okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMm,\u201d Lil\u2019 Fatty nodded his head gravely, wiping his tears away. \u201cUncle Lin, you won\u2019t let me go, will you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Lin Fan said, smiling, feeling proud of himself for taking care of the Children\u2019s Welfare Institute. Even the kids don\u2019t want to leave.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, there were other companions to play with at the Children\u2019s Welfare Institute and they would never be bullied. For the kids, no one was willing to leave.</p><br/><p>Ever since Lin Fan had taken over the Children\u2019s Welfare Institute, he decided that he was going to take full responsibility. Even if it was their own parents who came to pick their orphaned child up, he wouldn\u2019t release them if the parents didn\u2019t have good intentions or were unreliable.</p><br/><p>Even if people scolded him, spat on him or cursed him, it was nothing compared to weaponry, and so Lin Fan had nothing to fear.</p><br/><p>Being scolded won\u2019t cause actual physical hurt. All he had to do was smile and hold his ground.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan clapped his hands. \u201cAlright, alright. All you little kids, brighten up! The planting begins! Whoever plants the best arrangement will get to be the leader to take care of the garden.\u201d</p><br/><p>After hearing that whoever who did the best would be made the leader, the children all started becoming excited.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe flower that I plant will be the prettiest!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMine is the prettiest!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh, if you don\u2019t believe it, take a look at mine.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou guys can stop fighting already. The flower that I plant will be the prettiest.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, you were the one crying just now! How ugly!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDammit, I didn\u2019t cry!\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking at the kids play around again, Lin Fan couldn\u2019t help but smile. Just before he left, he gave Han Lu some special instructions, to make sure that he paid more attention at night in case those people came back to kidnap Lil\u2019 Fatty.</p><br/><p>Han Lu nodded, agreeing. However, it was almost impossible to trespass the Children\u2019s Welfare Institute, especially with him keeping watch.</p><br/><p>If there were really trespassers, they would be in for a huge beating.</p><br/><p>Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was all smiles when he came back, not caring much about what had happened in the morning.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Wu Huan Yue was in the shop. When she saw Brother Lin return, she ran over to him to welcome him.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuan Yue, with what happened just a few days ago, how are you so happy?\u201d Lin Fan asked, smiling.</p><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue giggled. \u201cI have a big heart. Next time when I meet this sort of situation, I won\u2019t ever be disappointed. Of course, I\u2019ll have to face whatever comes if I get exposed for real.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was stunned, shaking his head helplessly. Did she want a repeat of what happened?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking about? The road to stardom is long and arduous, and some people can only dream of it. Don\u2019t tell me are you going to give up?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue stuck out her tongue in a cute manner, \u201cBrother Lin, dinner tonight, my treat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust me?\u201d Lin Fan chuckled.</p><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue pouted. Did this even need second considerations?</p><br/><p>\u201cEh, we won\u2019t join in the fun today,\u201d Fraud Tian said.</p><br/><p>\u201cI won\u2019t be going either. I\u2019ve got to get some rest today,\u201d Wu You Lan said.</p><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue was stunned, not believing what she was hearing. She never thought that Wu You Lan wasn\u2019t going to follow along. She looked at Wu You Lan, touched.</p><br/><p>She knew that it was definitely because Sister You Lan had experienced what she was experiencing now and decided to let her have her moment.</p><br/><p>Seeing that the other people didn\u2019t want to go, Lin Fan answered, \u201cAlright then, it\u2019s just the two of us.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p></div>\n</div>"}

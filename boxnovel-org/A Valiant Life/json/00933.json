The welfare institute had already gotten on the right track and his life had gotten a little boring.</p><br/><p>Making scallion pancakes every day was very tiring. Ten servings a day. When he was unlucky, he would have to make up to twenty. Who would be able to endure such a job?</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian glanced at Lin Fan and felt that this kid looked like his life was meaningless. He had no idea what had happened. \u201cKid, what\u2019s wrong? Why do you look like your life is meaningless?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cI\u2019m tired. Look at my job right now. I\u2019m so busy that I\u2019m dying of exhaustion. And the welfare institute needs me to watch over it too. I\u2019m thinking, at such a young age, for me to be this tired, is it good?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, if people hear you say that, they would have nothing to say. Look at yourself. Your days are so free and easy. I have no words, I really don\u2019t.\u201d Fraud Tian shook his head. He wanted to just choke this kid to death.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-2\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>He had never seen someone as comfortable as this kid.</p><br/><p>And who knew how many people envied him?</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan went behind Lin Fan and softly massaged his shoulder. \u201cBrother Lin, if you\u2019re tired, we can go for a stroll.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said helplessly, \u201cNot for now. I have quite a lot of things to do. If it\u2019s just a short walk, that\u2019s fine but there\u2019s no place nearby to go.\u201d</p><br/><p>The matter regarding the welfare institute had pretty much been settled but some things still required him to take care of them. He was currently pondering about a certain thing. Besides completing his Encyclopedic task, what other class of knowledge should he use his Encyclopedic Points to buy?</p><br/><p>He felt that his whole life would probably have to be spent on Nanshan Children\u2019s Welfare Institute.</p><br/><p>Even his Encyclopedic Points had to be used on it.</p><br/><p>For example, he could get the piano class of knowledge.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-3\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>But it was a bit of a waste. He could just hire a piano teacher to teach the children. With the children\u2019s IQ, it definitely wouldn\u2019t be an issue.</p><br/><p><em>Forget it. I shan\u2019t think about this for now. I haven\u2019t even completed the angling task.</em></p><br/><p>Fishing up a legendary item. He had thought that the task would be simple but now, he felt that this task was really quite difficult.</p><br/><p>During this time, he had been going to fish but all that he had gotten were medicinal herbs.</p><br/><p>He felt that the main goal of angling was probably to support his Alchemy class of knowledge.</p><br/><p>The cupboards at home already contained numerous medicinal herbs.</p><br/><p>If he carried on working hard to accumulate more, he might just obtain all the herbs he needed for alchemy.</p><br/><p>At that moment, a call came.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the phone and answered. With a smile, he said, \u201cHuan Yue, why are you giving me a call all of a sudden?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan, who was massaging him, heard this and couldn\u2019t help but start listening closer. She knew that Wu Huan Yue was outside, filming a show. It seemed that it was quite tiring.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-4\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cBrother Lin, our cast and crew are now shooting the final scene in Hanzhong. It\u2019s very near Shanghai. Do you have time to come out and play?\u201d asked Wu Huan Yue.</p><br/><p>\u201cHanzhong, eh? Sure. It\u2019s just nice that I have nothing to do now,\u201d said Lin Fan with a chuckle. He was so bored anyway. Going out for a while and relaxing was not a bad idea.</p><br/><p>Moreover, Wu Huan Yue was so busy now and they hadn\u2019t met in a while. Since she had actively invited him, he had to go and see her.</p><br/><p>Otherwise, if he rejected, it would break her heart.</p><br/><p>When Wu Huan Yue heard Brother Lin agree, her heart started skipping delightfully.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Lin, I\u2019ll send the address to you on WeChat. Let me know once you\u2019re here,\u201d said Wu Huan Yue excitedly.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, no problem.\u201d Lin Fan chuckled, then hung up.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan asked curiously, \u201cBrother Lin, Huan Yue is filming in Shanghai Hanzhong?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYup. It\u2019s the final scene. She invited me over to play. It\u2019s not far anyway and I can get there very quickly by car. Do you want to go take a look?\u201d asked Lin Fan with a smile.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan shook her head. \u201cNah. Someone has to look after the shop.\u201d</p><br/><p>She had figured things out now. Although she had special feelings for Brother Lin, Brother Lin didn\u2019t seem to think about these things. Moreover, Huan Yue had indeed not come around in a while, so she decided to let Brother Lin meet her alone.</p><br/><p>Thinking about this, she started giggling in her heart.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-5\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Lin Fan was a little surprised. \u201cAlright then. You guys look after the shop. I\u2019ll drive over to see her. The journey will take two hours but it\u2019s not too far.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>That little girl, Wu Huan Yue, was really quite hardworking. In a year, she had basically not taken any breaks. She had been working hard the whole way.</p><br/><p>Although Lin Fan and Wang Ming Yang had given Huan Yue a good start, she had had to rely on herself from then onwards.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan set off towards Hanzhong.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Hanzhong film crew.</p><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue kept her phone and let out a wide, cheery smile. She hadn\u2019t expected Brother Lin to really come and her heart was delighted. Thinking about it, she hadn\u2019t seen him since the new year.</p><br/><p>She missed him a lot.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuan Yue, the next scene is your turn. Get ready quickly.\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-6\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m coming,\u201d responded Wu Huan Yue as she walked over to that side.</p><br/><p>The surrounding workers saw Wu Huan Yue\u2019s beaming smile and couldn\u2019t help but ask with a laugh, \u201cWhy are you so happy? Is there something that happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue was familiar with the crew and she just kept giggling to herself.</p><br/><p>In this tragedy film, Wu Huan Yue played a secondary character and she would die in the end.</p><br/><p>After all, in this kind of old-fashioned shows, there were very few perfect endings. Without a few deaths, it wouldn\u2019t match the style of the film. Moreover, the screenwriters felt that this pushed the whole show to its climax and allowed it to reach a new height.</p><br/><p>The director looked at the camera and nodded contently. The acting was great and he was satisfied. In particular, this new actor, Wu Huan Yue, he was very satisfied with her. Although she had been pushed by someone to join and she hadn\u2019t had the acting skills at first, after some guidance, she managed to express the emotions that she needed to. For a new actor, she was considered one of the best.</p><br/><p>Moreover, this film depended on attractiveness. As long as she was beautiful and her acting wasn\u2019t terrible, it would be good enough.</p><br/><p>\u201cDirector Zhu, this Wu Huan Yue\u2019s acting skills are pretty good. Although she\u2019s new, she brought out her persona exceptionally well.\u201d</p><br/><p>The director looked closely at the screen. When he heard that, he instantly smiled and replied, \u201cTeacher Chen, you\u2019re right. This Wu Huan Yue can become a powerful actress. Her appearance is fantastic too. It gives others a sense of closeness and it doesn\u2019t feel like she\u2019s acting. If she\u2019s properly nurtured, she\u2019ll definitely become a superstar.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Bao Guo was the second male lead in the film. Although he wasn\u2019t the first, his character played a major part in the film and most people wouldn\u2019t be able to play this character.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-7\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Initially, he wouldn\u2019t have acted in such a film but because he owed someone at the investors side a favor, he got pulled in.</p><br/><p>To him, this film was nothing special. It was just a film for young people to watch.</p><br/><p>But here, he realized that there were a number of new actors working very hard. They were working much harder than the first male and female lead actors. They just didn\u2019t have the right resources behind them. As a veteran, he felt that it was quite tragic.</p></div>\n</div>"}

Right now, the situation had gotten out of hand. Most people might not have known Chen He\u2019s background but all the celebrities with a certain amount of fame knew. Chen He was considered a well-known man in Northern China. Even megastars who went to Northern China would be meek while interacting with him. Otherwise, if they angered him, they might not be able to leave the Northside safely.</p><br/><p>A second-rate male celebrity took in a cold breath of air. Then, he asked his manager, \u201cWill there be any problems with us being here?\u201d</p><br/><p>His manager was scared stiff at that point but his brain was still working. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, we won\u2019t get implicated. Right now, we just have to see which side admits defeat but no matter what, Xu Zi Le won\u2019t be able to go to the North side for the rest of her life. I know about this Chen He. He is very influential and powerful in Northern China. We mustn\u2019t interrupt. Otherwise, we might get involved and that would be very troublesome.\u201d</p><br/><p>The second-rate male celebrity had only gotten to his current status because he had clung onto the influence of a wealthy woman. Eventually, the woman grew tired of him and dumped him. However, he had already gained some fame, so it didn\u2019t matter. He had relied on some underhand tactics to get to his current status, paying to play a certain character or to appear on a variety show. This was all done to boost his presence in the media.</p><br/><p>He had a very delicate look and quite a number of young girls were loyal fans of his. He was rather confident. As long as he didn\u2019t have conflicts with any big shots, he would be fine.</p><br/><p>Director Jin\u2019s hands and legs were trembling. \u201cFor god\u2019s sake, hurry up and tell your Big Bro to let it go. That\u2019s Chief Chen we\u2019re talking about!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph.\u201d Xu Zi Le snorted coldly. \u201cDirector Jin, when my Brother does something, I can\u2019t intervene. Even if he\u2019s Chief Chen, do you know who my Brother is? Have you ever heard of him?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xu Zi Le knew that Brother Lin had toppled Ma Mu Feng in Qingzhou. And who was Ma Mu Feng? He was a big shot of Qingzhou. A big shot who controlled the region. Even when compared to Chen He, he wouldn\u2019t lose out. In fact, Chen He may not even be at Ma Mu Feng\u2019s level.</p><br/><p>Director Jin had nothing to say. He couldn\u2019t help but sigh. He indeed knew who Zi Le\u2019s Big Bro was and he knew what kind of person he was as well.</p><br/><p>But wasn\u2019t he supposed to be the righteous and gentle Master Lin?</p><br/><p>This scene had changed Director Jin\u2019s impression of Master Lin greatly.</p><br/><p>Dominant. Right, dominant was the word. His dominance was unparalleled. He didn\u2019t care who it was or how impressive the opposition\u2019s background was. Anyone who angered him would pay for it.</p><br/><p>And he didn\u2019t even spout any nonsense. Not even any courteous words. He had completely ignored the opposition\u2019s reputation.</p><br/><p>How unbridled!</p><br/><p>Xue Er pulled on Xu Zi Le. \u201cSister Xu, will there be any problems?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xu Zi Le patted Xue Er\u2019s hand and gave her a reassuring look. Her heart was a little comforted. She got along quite well with the cast, especially this second female lead. Although they hadn\u2019t known each other for very long, she cared a lot for Xue Er during this period that they had been in the cast.</p><br/><p>Now that this had happened, only Xue Er bravely stood up to defend her. This made her very touched. Meanwhile, the others just watched from the side, not caring for her at all.</p><br/><p>In the entertainment industry, one can attain a deeper understanding of social relationships. In this industry, even brothers would stab each other for the sake of women or for other benefits. She had met someone who genuinely wanted to help her, so she naturally had to appreciate it.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Xu Zi Le looked at Xue Er\u2019s delicate face, then at Brother Lin. A certain thought had formed in her mind.</p><br/><p>She wanted to be a principled and incorruptible individual in this industry. That would not be possible unless one had pillars of support or one was very capable. Otherwise, it would only be a meaningless dream.</p><br/><p>However, this wasn\u2019t the time to think about all this.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Chen He\u2019s heart was trembling. He had been slapped so many times he lost count. But he knew that he absolutely had to kill this guy.</p><br/><p>He clenched his teeth as he glared fiercely at the man in front of him.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cWhich hand was it? Stick it out.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen He took a deep breath and said with a strong tone. \u201cThis is Shanghai, so I admit defeat but remember this. This matter isn\u2019t over. I will make you kneel before me and eat sh*t.\u201d</p><br/><p>Pa!</p><br/><p>Lin Fan immediately gave him another slap. \u201cWhich hand was it? Stick it out.\u201d</p><br/><p>This was extremely shameful and humiliating. Chen He could not bear it at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck your mom, what the heck do you want? I, Chen He, am not someone who can be scared. I will always remember how you have shamed me today. I won\u2019t let this end so easily. You have to\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Pa!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s all this nonsense? I asked you which hand it was,\u201d Lin Fan said simply and cruelly. He didn\u2019t give Chen He any chance to talk back.</p><br/><p>Every time the crowd heard the sound of slapping, they couldn\u2019t help but close their eyes. Their hearts were filled with fear. Although it didn\u2019t happen to them, just watching was painful. Moreover, being slapped in public was very humiliating. No human would be able to endure it.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Chen He glared at Lin Fan and finally stuck out his right hand.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled, \u201cThis hand of yours really deserves to be broken. I, Lin Fan, never go looking for trouble but if someone finds trouble with my people, then things will not end easily.\u201d</p><br/><p>*crack!*</p><br/><p>Lin Fan immediately grabbed Chen He\u2019s left hand and gripped it hard causing Chen He\u2019s five fingers to go out of alignment. Then, Lin Fan placed one hand under Chen He\u2019s arm and lifted it up. In an instant, that arm became crooked. Then, Lin Fan grabbed Chen He\u2019s scapula and twisted it. Chen He\u2019s bones were all displaced.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh!\u201d</p><br/><p>The sound of a pig being slaughtered rang out. Chen He\u2019s face turned pale as his teeth trembled. Cold sweat erupted from his pores. It was so painful that he was biting his lip.</p><br/><p>That cracking sound emanated throughout the banquet hall. Everyone couldn\u2019t help but shiver in fear.</p><br/><p>Terrifying. It was simply terrifying.</p><br/><p>And when they saw Chen He\u2019s five fingers, everyone sucked in a breath of cold air. It was cruel. His five fingers had been severely deformed.</p><br/><p>Merciless.</p><br/><p>When Xu Zi Le saw this scene, she was startled as well. She had never expected Brother Lin to attack so viciously. Even without hearing the sounds, just by looking at that left hand of his, she could tell how much Chen He had suffered.</p><br/><p>It was probably so painful that he wanted to die.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cZi Le, call Ming Yang. See if his phone is on.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xu Zi Le hurriedly took out her phone and made the call. The call got through. \u201cBrother Lin, the call got through.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPass me the phone.\u201d Lin Fan took over the phone. Wang Ming Yang\u2019s voice rang out from the phone. \u201cWife, what\u2019s up? I\u2019m having an impromptu meeting. I\u2019m going to off my phone.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cWhat meeting? Your wife has been beaten by someone at Dongyue Entertainment Hotel and you\u2019re having a f*cking meeting? Hurry over now!\u201d</p><br/><p>On the other end of the call, Wang Ming Yang was shocked. He knew that the person on the other end was his Brother. But when he heard that his wife had been beaten, he immediately put down his work. \u201cI\u2019m coming. I\u2019m coming right now. F*ck, which b*stard dares to bully my wife?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cJust hurry over. Stop \u2018F*ck\u2019-ing.\u201d</p><br/><p>He hung up.</p><br/><p>Chen He sat there with a frightened look on his face. He shrieked miserably as he looked at his left hand.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan pulled a stool over and sat down. \u201cYou guys, continue eating. No need to care about us.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026.</p><br/><p>At this point, how could the crowd still be in the mood to eat? Things had gotten so out of hand, how big must their hearts have been if they were still able to eat?</p><br/><p>\u201cCarry on eating now. Do you understand?\u201d Lin Fan frowned as he said this in a stern tone. When the crowd heard this, they groaned in their hearts.</p><br/><p>They didn\u2019t even dare to anger Chief He and this Master Lin\u2019s means of doing things were so violent that they were even more afraid of him.</p><br/><p>\u201cQuick, quickly sit down and eat.\u201d</p><br/><p>The cast and production crew sat down. Their hands that they held their chopsticks with started trembling. They really could not eat.</p><br/><p>Looking at this situation, Lin Fan nodded contently. He had come to teach someone a lesson but he couldn\u2019t affect the others\u2019 celebration.</p><br/><p>As for Chen He, he could be treated as an impromptu show to liven things up.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p></div>\n</div>"}

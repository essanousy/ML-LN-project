He chose Liu Xu\u2019s restaurant.</p><br/><p>Li Meng Hua and Zheng Long were both public figures. Hence, they covered themselves up so that no one would recognize them. Although Wang Ke Hao was a public figure too, he was a behind-the-scenes figure. Especially since his appearance wasn\u2019t outstanding, he naturally wouldn\u2019t draw attention from fans.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan swaggered as he followed behind.</p><br/><p>Donyue Entertainment Hotel.</p><br/><p>It was actually pretty awesome for Liu Xu to set up her business here. Although she had stolen a bit of light from Lin Fan by making his friends think that she was his lady, for her to be able to handle herself in Shanghai and develop to this stage was rather respectable.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, what kind of wind blew our Master Lin all the way over to our humble place today?\u201d From afar, Liu Xu saw Lin Fan and came over with a smile. She spoke with a mocking tone and there was a hidden intention behind her words. It made people feel uncomfortable.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-2\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cHehe, it must be the Northwest wind*. What else could it be?\u201d said Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>This Liu Xu wasn\u2019t very respectful towards him. If he didn\u2019t have a good temper, he would have struck her with a Dragon Claw Strike and burst open her chest.</p><br/><p>Wang Ke Hao, as a great director, had seen all kinds of beautiful ladies. But when he saw Liu Xu, his eyes really lit up.</p><br/><p>A unique temperament. A stunning appearance. And every move and action from her exuded an aura that made people gasp in awe.</p><br/><p>He even started to think, if this beautiful lady were to act in his film, she would definitely be suitable for the role of a seductive female big shot.</p><br/><p>Li Meng Hua and Zheng Long had acted in countless films and they had naturally seen countless beautiful ladies as well but there weren\u2019t many that could really make them feel stunned. But this lady in front of them had really stunned them.</p><br/><p>Liu Xu smiled. \u201cMaster Lin, what do you have planned for today? Don\u2019t think of leeching off me. I don\u2019t give anything for free.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan glanced at Liu Xu. \u201cLady, can\u2019t you talk nicely? What do you mean \u2018leeching\u2019? And what do you mean you don\u2019t give anything for free? Am I that sort of person? I\u2019ve had some small conflicts with you in the past but why are you so narrow-minded? With you, things that should be big aren\u2019t big but things that should be small are big instead.\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-3\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d When Liu Xu heard that, she was so angry that her face turned red. Then, she stopped quarreling with Lin Fan. \u201cAre you eating or singing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course we\u2019re eating. Who sings when they\u2019re hungry?\u201d Lin Fan\u2019s attitude was rather nasty too.</p><br/><p>Liu Xu had a \u2018You win this time\u2019 look on her face. \u201cFollow me. I\u2019ll bring you to a private room.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ke Hao and the rest laughed in their hearts. To them, this beautiful lady seemed to have a kind of indescribable relationship with Master Lin. The way she talked, it seemed like she was his mistress.</p><br/><p>But thinking about it, it made sense. Master Lin was such a powerful man, it was only natural. Moreover, he wasn\u2019t bad-looking either. He would definitely be well-liked by the ladies.</p><br/><p>In the best private room.</p><br/><p>\u201cBoss, please enter,\u201d said Liu Xu as she stood at the door.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded. \u201cMmm, that attitude is about right. If you are like this all the way, I can guarantee that your business would do better.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Xu chuckled, then looked at the people at the side. <em>I have no idea who you are. It\u2019s not even cold, why are you wrapped up like a mummy? Could it be that you can\u2019t let people see who you are?</em></p><br/><p>But then, she had a rough idea of what was going on. This Master Lin was not an average person. The friends he had were not simple either.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-4\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cThis restaurant\u2019s environment is very good.\u201d Li Meng Hua took off his mask and cap.</p><br/><p>When Liu Xu heard this, she realized that he wasn\u2019t from around here. But when she saw him, she was startled. She hadn\u2019t expected it to be a superstar.</p><br/><p>She muttered in her heart. <em>This guy has quite a broad network of friends. He even knows celebrities from outside.</em></p><br/><p>Then, she didn\u2019t bother about it anymore. She wasn\u2019t someone who pursued celebrities. They were all human and there was nothing different about them.</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone, please take your time and chat.\u201d Liu Xu didn\u2019t say much to Lin Fan before leaving. But she knew that she couldn\u2019t let just any waiter serve this room. She had to personally appoint some people.</p><br/><p>After all, not every waiter would be able to maintain their cool when they saw celebrities. In order to avoid unnecessary trouble, she had to be careful.</p><br/><p>After Liu Xu left, Wang Ke Hao said with a smile, \u201cMaster Lin, you really are lucky.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was taken aback and couldn\u2019t quite understand it. Then, he realized what he was talking about. \u201cDirector Wang, it\u2019s not what you think.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI understand, I understand.\u201d Wang Ke Hao chuckled. <em>I know, don\u2019t worry. We aren\u2019t having any absurd thoughts.</em></p><br/><p>Lin Fan really didn\u2019t want to say more about that. What else could he say? If it couldn\u2019t be clarified, it was better not to speak at all.</p><br/><p>During the meal, everyone chatted cheerily despite it being their first time meeting.</p><br/><p>Haojiang!</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-5\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Wynn Casino.</p><br/><p>A young man sat at the gambling table. His eyes were all red. His fingers were a little stiff as he stared unblinkingly at the cards in his hands. His expression was one of pure excitement.</p><br/><p>\u201cThree edges, three edges\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMotherf*cker\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The spectators sighed. There were four edges.</p><br/><p>The young man shouted at the moneylender at the side. \u201cGive me 5 million more.\u201d</p><br/><p>The moneylender laughed. \u201cBrother, you can\u2019t keep playing like this. Don\u2019t play until you have no more money to repay me. That will make it very difficult for us.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? You don\u2019t even have money to lend in this casino? My father is the famous director Wang Ke Hao. His movies make billions each. Do you think I would be short of money?\u201d Wang Wen growled aggressively. It seemed that he wouldn\u2019t rest until he broke even.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, son of the great director, that\u2019s fine. We\u2019ll verify that, okay?\u201d said the moneylender.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay. Check all you want. My phone is filled with contacts of celebrities. You can see all you want,\u201d said Wang Wen.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-6\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>The moneylender told someone to check it and it was indeed true. Then, he could lend money without any worries. His tone also became a little friendlier.</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung Master Wang, I hate to tell you this but since you\u2019re borrowing so much, the interest is charged hourly. If you accept, please sign here so we can lend you money without any worries. You can take as much as you want,\u201d said the moneylender.</p><br/><p>Wang Wen didn\u2019t mind it at all. He immediately nodded. \u201cAlright, alright. Enough rubbish. Give me 5 million first.\u201d</p><br/><p>Right now, he was already unable to think rationally. The moneylender sent someone to get it done. At the same time, he prepared the contract and took Wang Wen\u2019s ID and other documents.</p><br/><p>After receiving the contract, Wang Wen didn\u2019t even look before signing it.</p><br/><p>The chips came and he immediately started gambling.</p><br/><p>A subordinate said, \u201cBig Bro, will this kid have sufficient money to repay us?\u201d</p><br/><p>The moneylender said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. He\u2019s not a cheat. His identity is real. Important people don\u2019t like to appear in the news for bad reasons, so we can lend him money without any worries. But we have to have a limit. You guys can start calculating the interest first.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood.\u201d</p><br/><p>One hour later.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-7\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Wang Wen said, \u201cGive me another 10 million.\u201d</p><br/><p>Within this period, Wang Wen had asked for money a few more times.</p><br/><p>Playing blindly. Borrowing blindly. He wasn\u2019t thinking at all. He was just so infuriated by the opposition\u2019s cards.</p><br/><p>Also, because of his identity, he didn\u2019t care about everything else.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>(*Note: There is an idiom in Chinese that literally translates to drinking the Northwest wind which means to be cold and hungry.)</p></div>\n</div>"}

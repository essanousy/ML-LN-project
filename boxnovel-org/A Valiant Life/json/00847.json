However, he didn\u2019t know what was it. Although he was trying to guess what it was, he felt that it was impossible.</p><br/><p>Chen Chang Sheng had realized that the atmosphere was wrong. He felt that Master Lin wouldn\u2019t suddenly suggest cooking for everyone. Something bad must have happened.</p><br/><p>Then, he took out his phone and texted Wang Ming Yang.</p><br/><p>\u201cChief Wang, what happened to Master Lin?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang looked at his phone and replied, \u201cI\u2019m not very sure. However, something must have happened. It probably concerns your friend.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Chang Sheng replied, \u201cThat can\u2019t be. It\u2019s his first time meeting all of you. How could it\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang replied, \u201cYou should be mentally prepared. My bro is well-mannered but when he gets angry, it\u2019s really scary.\u201d</p><br/><p>After sending that text, Wang Ming Yang didn\u2019t say anything else. He kept his phone immediately.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, He Cheng Han just spoke softly to the people around him.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t know what was happening but he knew that something was wrong.</p><br/><p>After a short while.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan pushed the door open and brought two plates. The plates were being covered and he placed them on the table.</p><br/><p>\u201cI just made two dishes for you. Let\u2019s try them together, shall we?\u201d Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>Chen Chang Sheng looked at Lin Fan and said, \u201cMaster Lin\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Before he could finish his sentence, he got interrupted by Lin Fan. Lin Fan immediately took the covers off and presented the dishes in front of them.</p><br/><p>Xu Fei Yuan was initially really happy but when he saw the dishes, his face instantly changed.</p><br/><p>\u201cMirror Box Tofu and Cherry Pork.\u201d</p><br/><p>The crowd was stunned after hearing what Xu Fei Yuan said.</p><br/><p>Weren\u2019t those the dishes that he stole from the small restaurant?</p><br/><p>How did Master Lin know how to cook them?</p><br/><p>They weren\u2019t stupid and they knew the reason for that.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan wiped the dust off his hands and returned back to his seat. Then, he looked at Xu Fei Yuan, \u201cChief Xu, please help to introduce the dishes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xu Fei Yuan looked at Master Lin and didn\u2019t know what to say, \u201cMaster Lin, I\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved his hand, \u201cJust introduce them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xu Fei Yuan felt like something was going to happen. His throat trembled.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is Mirror Box Tofu.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd this is Cherry Pork.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled, \u201cChief Xu should know that these dishes don\u2019t exist in the Jiangsu cuisine, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xu Fei Yuan nodded as a form of acceptance.</p><br/><p>\u201cPeople that know me should know that I know how to cook. Right?\u201d Lin Fan looked at the others.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang nodded, \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>He Cheng Han and the others also nodded.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at Xu Fei Yuan and said, \u201cInitially, only I know how to make these dishes. However, when I went back to Zhongzhou for the New Year, I saw that my friend\u2019s restaurant was doing really badly. I taught him these two dishes. Therefore, the only people that know how to make these dishes are him and me. I wonder how Chief Xu knows how to make them. Could you tell me the process of everything? I want to know what happened.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan said that, everyone understood what was going on.</p><br/><p>He Cheng Han looked at Xu Fei Yuan. He didn\u2019t expect this fella to have messed Master Lin\u2019s friend up.</p><br/><p>Chen Chang Sheng was stunned. He didn\u2019t expect the matter to become like that. He looked at Xu Fei Yuan in shock.</p><br/><p>At the same time, he knew that something bad was going to happen.</p><br/><p>Things didn\u2019t seem good.</p><br/><p>Xu Fei Yuan wasn\u2019t stupid. He knew that although Master Lin\u2019s wealth and status couldn\u2019t match up to his, everyone else at the table didn\u2019t speak anymore.</p><br/><p>If he still didn\u2019t understand the situation, he could probably just commit suicide.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, I\u2026 I\u2026\u201d Xu Fei Yuan felt as if his throat was being blocked and he couldn\u2019t say anything.</p><br/><p>*slam!*</p><br/><p>Then, Lin Fan slammed the table angrily and stared at him.</p><br/><p>\u201cI hate the people that bully my friends the most. Do you know that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xu Fei Yuan was shocked. His forehead was filled with sweat. He started stuttering, \u201cI\u2026 I\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Chang Sheng stood up anxiously, \u201cMaster Lin, don\u2019t be mad. He didn\u2019t know that was your friend.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cChief Chen, this doesn\u2019t concern you. I am asking him questions.\u201d Lin Fan waved his hand and looked at Xu Fei Yuan. \u201cLet me ask you this. Did it feel great bullying my friend?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Chang Sheng didn\u2019t know what to do. He wanted to say something and got interrupted by Wang Ming Yang.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Chen, just sit down. Don\u2019t get yourself involved in this,\u201d Wang Ming Yang said.</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan called Bai Ke, he could tell that something was wrong. However, he didn\u2019t do anything about it earlier.</p><br/><p>He should have called him when the incident happened. He just kept quiet about it.</p><br/><p>If not for his random encounter with this man, he probably would have never found out about it.</p><br/><p>Then, Lin Fan wasn\u2019t furious. However, he wanted a conclusion for this matter.</p><br/><p>\u201cChief Xu, tell me. What do you think you should do?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xu Fei Yuan swallowed his saliva forcefully. He felt that things had gone out of control. \u201cMaster Lin, I know I was wrong. I really didn\u2019t know that. If I had known, I wouldn\u2019t have done that. How about I pay for the losses. I will definitely satisfy you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow are you going to pay?\u201d Lin Fan asked.</p><br/><p>Xu Fei Yuan thought about it for a moment. \u201cI will buy the rights to sell these two dishes and pay them for their losses. I really don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright. Are you still going to buy the rights? My dishes were never supposed to be sold to others. I only gave them to him because he was my friend. Now, you\u2019re telling me you want to use it? You\u2019ll have to see if you\u2019re capable enough. I\u2019ll give you one chance. When you return back, pay my friend and make an official announcement saying that you stole the dishes. Return the patent rights to my friend.\u201d</p><br/><p>After Xu Fei Yuan heard that, his face changed. If he were to do that, he would be doomed.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan added, \u201cOf course, you can disagree. You can try me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xu Fei Yuan looked at Lin Fan\u2019s eyes and he was fearful.</p><br/><p>Who was going to pay for the consequences?</p><br/><p>This was a life and death situation.</p><br/><p>How many people lost their placing in society because of Master Lin? If he were to go against Master Lin, he would probably die a painful death.</p><br/><p>When Chen Chang Sheng heard that he heaved a sigh of relief, \u201cWhat are you doing? Master Lin has already said the terms and conditions. Just quickly agree to it.\u201d</p><br/><p>He was afraid that this friend of his was so greedy that he thought that he could win Master Lin.</p><br/><p>If that was the case, he would probably be doomed.</p><br/><p>The others didn\u2019t really say anything. However, when Master Lin talked about something, they had to side him.</p><br/><p>Chen Chang Sheng was regretting his decision for bringing his friend along.</p><br/><p>However, he felt that it was a blessing in disguise. If Master Lin were to find out about this in the future, he would probably suffer a worse fate.</p><br/><p>He was thankful for that.</p><br/><p>Then, Xu Fei Yuan nodded, \u201cMaster Lin, I\u2019ll agree to that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan pointed at the door, \u201cGet out. Do not disturb us as we\u2019re having a meal. I hope you\u2019ll resolve this soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xu Fei Yuan felt so embarrassed but he didn\u2019t dare to do anything. He just nodded and left.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang said, \u201cAlright, bro, don\u2019t be too angry. Elder Chen didn\u2019t know about this too. Let\u2019s eat. Don\u2019t be angry about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>The others also tried to console him.</p><br/><p>Chen Chang Sheng was really embarrassed. He wanted to thank Master Lin for what he did but he didn\u2019t expect Master Lin to be so unhappy.</p><br/><p>It was all his fault.</p></div>\n</div>"}

As he left, he gave a confident nod at Wang Ming Yang.</p><br/><p>As if to say \u2018Trust me. I\u2019m definitely right.\u2019</p><br/><p>Initially, he had thought of looking for the government. After all, there were countless people who didn\u2019t have all four limbs in the country. If he could produce these realistic prosthetic limbs, it would be terrific.</p><br/><p>However, he went to look for Wang Ming Yang in the end to give him and his business an opportunity to take flight.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang looked at the long list. He didn\u2019t understand the items at all so he called his secretary over.</p><br/><p>The secretary walked in on high heels.</p><br/><p>\u201cChief Wang, what instructions do you have for me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang passed her the list. \u201cAccording to the list, procure all those items. Then, find a good place to install all of them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d The secretary took over the list. Just as she was about to leave, she took a look at the list and stopped in her tracks. She was a highly educated person, hence, she recognized some of the items on the list.</p><br/><p>\u201cChief Wang, these are all research equipment,\u201d said the secretary curiously. Although she wasn\u2019t involved in that line of work, she knew that the prices of these items were not low.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang nodded. \u201cI know. Just follow the list and procure the items. You have to buy good ones. Don\u2019t buy any counterfeit items. We\u2019re building a research lab.\u201d</p><br/><p>The secretary was dazed. <em>What\u2019s going on? Our company\u2019s main business is property, isn\u2019t it? Since when did we start researching?</em></p><br/><p>But since Chief Wang had spoken, she couldn\u2019t ask too much and she just went on her way. There was probably going to be a huge spending on all this equipment.</p><br/><p>Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was in a very good mood. He felt as if he had never been this happy. The class of knowledge he had gotten this time might not have been of great use to him individually, but it was a very good thing.</p><br/><p>He closed his eyes. The various classes of knowledge flowed through his mind which was like a large knowledge treasury.</p><br/><p>Right now, all he had to do was wait for Wang Ming Yang to prepare the research lab before he could dive into the manufacturing process.</p><br/><p>But with his own capabilities, he could only produce one at a time. To mass produce it, he would have to see if Wang Ming Yang was capable enough.</p><br/><p>But this kind of technology would still require the government\u2019s cooperation.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan wanted to let Wang Ming Yang earn money but he couldn\u2019t just do it for the money. He would have to join the country\u2019s Technological Research Team.</p><br/><p>In the future, the children of Nanshan Children\u2019s Welfare Institute would all have perfectly normal bodies. Although they wouldn\u2019t be real arms and legs, it wouldn\u2019t be much different from the real thing. It would be fantastic.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Lin, what\u2019s making you so happy?\u201d asked Wu You Lan with a giggle.</p><br/><p>She realized that, since Brother Lin had come back, he had been smiling the whole time and she wondered what exactly was making Brother Lin so happy.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled and said, \u201cIt\u2019s a secret. You all will find out in the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan felt that the secret that Brother Lin was talking about must be a good thing.</p><br/><p>Without thinking too much, Lin Fan just lay down and read the news with a big smile on his face.</p><br/><p>The next day!</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was in his shop. As he was about to take a short rest, Wu You Lan walked over quietly and placed her hand on the table. She said gently, \u201cBrother Lin, are you free today?\u201d</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan heard her voice, he knew something was up. \u201cI am. What is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t have much to do. Wang Ming Yang\u2019s side hadn\u2019t finished the job yet, so he wouldn\u2019t be busy for now. Now that Wu You Lan was softly whispering to him, something was definitely up.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan carefully took out two tickets. \u201cBrother Lin, let\u2019s go and watch a game. Today, the Golden Flowers are playing against Yokohama F. Marinos. Let\u2019s go and watch.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan didn\u2019t like to watch football mainly because he didn\u2019t quite understand it. But looking at Wu You Lan\u2019s expression, it seemed that she would be very disappointed if they didn\u2019t go.</p><br/><p>And it also seemed that these tickets had been specially bought.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, let\u2019s go and watch then.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMmm!\u201d Wu You Lan smiled sweetly as she was exhilarated. \u201cBrother Lin, it will start in the afternoon. Let\u2019s head out after lunch.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright. Whatever you say,\u201d Lin Fan replied with a smile.</p><br/><p>Afternoon!</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan punctually dragged Lin Fan with her and left the shop.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian was sitting at the entrance, smoking his cigarette. As he watched the two of them pulling and tugging, he couldn\u2019t help but ask, \u201cWow, where are you going?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGoing to watch football,\u201d said Wu You Lan with a smile.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian said, \u201cBring me along.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, we only bought two tickets.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. \u201cFraud, just look after the shop. You wouldn\u2019t be able to understand the game.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian started to get frustrated. \u201cWho says I can\u2019t understand? Sigh. Next time, when you watch something, remember to get a ticket for me too. I want to go and watch as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>But by the time he finished speaking, the two of them had already left Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>\u201cSigh. This man is old. I\u2019m already not welcome.\u201d Fraud Tian sighed as he lowered his head. He felt a little hurt.</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang added fuel to the fire. \u201cIt\u2019s good that you know. You still ask so shamelessly every time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cScrew off.\u201d Fraud Tian waved his hand.</p><br/><p>At the stadium.</p><br/><p>There were already many people there and they were all queuing to enter.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan said, \u201cBrother Lin, we\u2019re a little late. I\u2019m afraid we\u2019ll have to queue for a while.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s fine. We\u2019ll wait then.\u201d</p><br/><p>This was Lin Fan\u2019s first time here to watch football.</p><br/><p>\u201cBeautiful lady, handsome man, I\u2019ll buy back your tickets for a high price. Are you willing to sell?\u201d At that moment, a man sneakily went up to them and started talking about buying their tickets.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not selling.\u201d Wu You Lan immediately rejected him. This time, she was here to watch the game with Brother Lin. Even if this buyer offered even more, they wouldn\u2019t sell.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll buy it for a high price. This game won\u2019t be any good. Our team will definitely lose. Why don\u2019t you look for fun somewhere else?\u201d said the buyer.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan was a little upset now. \u201cWho says that they\u2019ll lose? I think they\u2019ll win.\u201d</p><br/><p>The buyer felt that it was time to show off his knowledge. \u201cBeautiful lady, you must not know this. Back in 2003, they lost 0-2. I think that they\u2019re likely to lose this time as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cSigh. How can you have such little faith in our country\u2019s team? 2003 was a long time ago,\u201d Wu You Lan retorted.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was laughing at the side. Then, he said to the buyer, \u201cI think that you should just buy scallion pancakes for resale at my shop. Why are you even trying to resell tickets when we\u2019re just watching a game?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing that, the buyer was confused. But when he looked closely, he was startled. \u201cD*mn! Little Boss, it\u2019s you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cYup, it\u2019s me. We\u2019re not selling these tickets. Go and try someone else.\u201d</p><br/><p>When the buyer saw that it was Little Boss, he suddenly awakened. He had earned quite a lot of money reselling scallion pancakes at Cloud Street. \u201cBeautiful lady, let me see your tickets. Where are you guys sitting?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan helplessly took out the tickets.</p><br/><p>When the buyer saw it, he shook his head. \u201cThis is too far behind. No. I have to give you guys better seats. I won\u2019t take a single cent.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, before Wu You Lan could say more, the buyer quickly took out two tickets and thrust them into her hand. \u201cThese are close to the front. The view will be great.\u201d</p><br/><p>Without saying more, he left immediately. This reseller\u2019s actions had left them lost for words.</p></div>\n</div>"}

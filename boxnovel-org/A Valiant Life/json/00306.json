His expression was very calm. Whatever they had to discuss could be discussed slowly.</p><br/><p>He Xiao Ming looked at Lin Fan. He had long had a sense of respect for Lin Fan. He hadn't believed in Lin Fan at first, but now he did. Then, He Xiao Ming described everything he had seen at the temple.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan slowly drank his tea. His heart was getting excited. He hadn't expected that things would turn out so coincidentally. He Cheng Han had only gone to pray at the temple as an act. He knew that He Xiao Ming would definitely follow him there.</p><br/><p>But now that the Buddha had hit his head, it was completely beyond his predictions. He had even seen blood.</p><br/><p>What was that called?</p><br/><p>It was called a disaster involving bloodshed. They had no choice but to be convinced.</p><br/><p>Even Lin Fan was convinced. This was help from the heavens.</p><br/><p>\"Uncle Lin, you said that I'll meet with a calamity and that my dad will take it for me. Will my dad die?\" asked He Xiao Ming anxiously. He had been struck fearful by that day's events and he didn't dare to imagine if that Buddha had been a little bigger, what would the outcome have been?</p><br/><p>When he thought of this, He Xiao Ming's face turned pale.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan put down the teacup and looked up, \"Are you worried about your dad?\"</p><br/><p>If this was before, He Xiao Ming would definitely have replied with one word, 'No'. However, right now, he was really worried. He said, \"Uncle Lin, please just tell me. If something really happens, I don't want my dad to take the calamity in my place.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan had initially planned to tease this kid a little but now he thought that he should just let him be. Seeing how worried the kid looked, Lin Fan would rather not lie to him. Otherwise, he might become so frightened that something might happen.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. \"Alright. It's nothing much. He's already taken the calamity in your place.\"</p><br/><p>\"Huh?\" He Xiao Ming was surprised. \"That Buddha hitting his head was him taking it for me?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded. \"Yup. That's the same reason why I told your dad to go to the temple. Otherwise, the outcome would have been terrible. However, inside the temple, there's the power of the burning incense as well as the Buddhas that might have helped to avert the disaster anyway.\"</p><br/><p>He Xiao Ming nodded slowly. He felt that what Uncle Lin said was a little surreal but with the current circumstances, he had to believe him because the situation itself was, to him, a little surreal.</p><br/><p>\"That's really it?\" He Xiao Ming wanted to confirm it once more. \"Nothing else will happen in future?\"</p><br/><p>\"That's in theory but you have to remember that a person's fate can change. If you keep angering your dad like that, it won't even take a calamity. He might just fall sick from being angry at you. If that happens, calamity or not, he might just end up lying on the hospital bed,\" said Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>He Xiao Ming nodded. \"I understand, Uncle Lin. I understand.\"</p><br/><p>He could comprehend it now. Through this incident, he suddenly thought about his father's feelings towards himself. And at the same time, he started to understand some of the things that he hadn't understood before.</p><br/><p>He was instantly heartbroken.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at He Xiao Ming and said, \"Don't think too much. What's done is done. Oh right, give me your phone.\"</p><br/><p>He Xiao Ming was still thinking about the incident as he passed Lin Fan his phone. He had no idea what Uncle Lin wanted to do.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan took over the phone and looked at it. Then, he intentionally said, \"Hey, you're playing this game too!\"</p><br/><p>\"Mmm.\" He Xiao Ming glanced at him and nodded.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed, \"Rich people really are different. You must have all the skins and all the level five runes. I don't even have a single set of level five runes. I can't even win anyone. Each time I start a game, I get humiliated.\"</p><br/><p>He Xiao Ming looked at Lin Fan and said, \"Uncle, I have some gold left. I'll send them all to you.\"</p><br/><p>\"How could I accept that?\" Lin Fan laughed. Then, he said, \"But, you're still young. Your studies are the most important. This gold can be put into my care for now.\"</p><br/><p>He Xiao Ming looked at Lin Fan with a strange expression. This uncle of his was really unreasonable.</p><br/><p>Still, he remembered everything Lin Fan had done. It was a great deed and he had to repay him.</p><br/><p>In the end, he sent all his level five runes and his skins over to Lin fan.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was smiling as brightly as a flower.</p><br/><p>After He Xiao Ming left.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan cheerily unlocked his phone. His efforts hadn't gone to waste. He sent a message over, \"Chief He, the matter is pretty much finished. If you really can't carry on, then hurry back.\"</p><br/><p>After a long while, he still hadn't received a reply from Chief He.</p><br/><p>It looked like he had become addicted to praying.</p><br/><p>This problem had been solved perfectly.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian came to Lin Fan's side and asked, \"So the matter has been resolved just like that?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded. \"Yep, pretty much. Don't tell anyone else about this.\"</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian nodded. \"Don't worry. That kid is lucky indeed, being born into a wealthy family. I really don't understand what went through his mind, to cause so much conflict with Chief He. If it were me, I would immediately have another son. If he still didn't obey me, I wouldn't give him any allowance.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan glanced at Fraud Tian and said, \"You need to get a girlfriend first.\"</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian: \"...\"</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>In the afternoon.</p><br/><p>A luxurious limousine stopped at the entrance of Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>In the car.</p><br/><p>\"Young Master Zou, this is the shop that sells those scallion pancakes,\" said Li Yang Jun respectfully.</p><br/><p>A smile spread across Young Master Zou's face. When some of the ladies passing by saw this luxurious car, they looked inside and were startled. Their eyes sparkled and their legs were as if they were paralyzed.</p><br/><p>They were completely mesmerized.</p><br/><p>He was like a Prince Charming from a fairytale.</p><br/><p>Young Master Zou gave a slight grin at those ladies and they instantly turned red. Then, they scurried off shyly.</p><br/><p>So dashing. So classy.</p><br/><p>\"I never thought that I would come across such a delicious delicacy, much less that it would come from such a tiny shop. We really can't judge things by appearances,\" Young Master Zou said with a sigh.</p><br/><p>Li Yang Jun said, \"Young Master, this shop has very strange rules. They only sell ten servings a day so they basically don't sell any more at this timing. And they have one other rule, which is that if you can understand that sheet on the wall, you can purchase one scallion pancake.\"</p><br/><p>Young Master Zou smiled playfully. \"You mean to say that if I go and buy now, I won't be able to?\"</p><br/><p>Li Yang Jun smiled embarrassedly. This was Young Master in front of him. If he were to say yes, it would be a slap to Young Master's face. But he knew that Young Master was a miracle worker. There was nothing he couldn't do. Therefore, as a sign of understanding of Young Master's prowess, he smiled and said, \"Young Master, a normal person wouldn't be able to buy it. The last time, Li Shi Kun came and got rejected.\"</p><br/><p>\"Li Shi Kun?\" Young Master Zou thought for a moment, then laughed, \"You mean that third-in-charge of this place?\"</p><br/><p>Li Yang Jun nodded. \"Right.\"</p><br/><p>\"Haha\u2026\" Young Master Zou opened the car door, then said confidently, \"If other people can't buy it, it's because they lack ability. Do you think I won't be able to buy it?\"</p><br/><p>Li Yang Jun looked at Young Master Zou and replied with a smile, \"If it's Young Master, then there's a high chance of buying it.\"</p><br/><p>With supreme confidence, Young Master Zou said, \"It's not just a high chance. I will definitely be able to buy it. I have money and power. What is there that can't be done with these two things?\"</p><br/><p>\"That's true.\" Li Yang Jun nodded. He felt that Young Master made sense.</p><br/><p>As Young Master started to walk confidently towards the 'Master Lin' shop, Li Yang Jun's phone rang. When he saw the caller, he answered the call very politely.</p><br/><p>\"Leader\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"Lil' Jun, is my kid in Shanghai bothering you again?\"</p><br/><p>Li Yang Jun immediately replied, \"Leader, he's not a bother at all. Young Master missed me and just came to pay me a visit.\"</p><br/><p>\"Mmm. You are his senior after all. Look after him and don't let him cause trouble.\"</p><br/><p>Li Yang Jun said, \"Leader, I wouldn't dare to call myself Young Master's senior. But while he's here, I'll definitely take good care of him. But Young Master's mood this time doesn't seem too good.\"</p><br/><p>\"Looks like he didn't tell you. But it really isn't a good thing. He got dumped in the middle of the street by that little girl and he was too ashamed to stay in Beijing, so he went out to let loose a little.\"</p><br/><p>When he heard this, Li Yang Jun laughed. He knew who that little girl was. He then continued to exchange a few words with the leader, then they hung up.</p><br/><p>At that moment.</p><br/><p>Young Master Zou stood outside 'Master Lin'.</p><br/><p>He planted himself there and didn't say a word. He just quietly waited.</p><br/><p>He would never take the initiative to speak first. He was there to buy something and naturally, the shopkeeper should warmly welcome him.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian, who was playing with his phone, glanced up for a moment, then continued playing.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan took a glance too. As of then, he already had all the skins and all the runes. He was looking flashy in the game and he was competing furiously with Fraud Tian, so he ignored the man at the entrance as well.</p><br/><p>Let him stand a little while more. Wait for him to speak.</p><br/><p>\"Huh?\" At that moment, Young Master Zou cried out in surprise.</p><br/><p>Those people in the shop seemed a little weird. Then, he purposely coughed a few times to indicate that he was standing at the entrance.</p><br/><p>But in the end\u2026</p><br/><p>No one cared.</p><br/><p>This was a little awkward.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Ever since Wu Tian He had come to the shop, the fortune-telling had all been done by him.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-1\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Moreover, Wu Tian He\u2019s powers were very strong. He was very well-received by all the aunts around. Whenever anything happened, they would come to have their fortunes read.</p><br/><p>Gradually, people had forgotten that Lin Fan\u2019s fortune-telling ability was powerful too.</p><br/><p>But Lin Fan didn\u2019t mind it. After all, he wanted to stay low-key.</p><br/><p>Hence, when Fang Qian asked that question, Lin Fan didn\u2019t read her fortune but instead, he found a way to go around it.</p><br/><p>Fang Qian looked at Lin Fan. \u201cMaster Lin, I feel like you\u2019re not the same as how the Internet portrays you. You\u2019re really mischievous with your words.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha\u2026\u201d When Lin Fan heard that, he instantly started laughing. \u201cAlright, enough joking. You have to rely on yourself to find your other half. If I read your fortune for you, it would become meaningless.\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-2\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>The fans in the broadcast room were stirred up upon hearing that.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, do you guys feel like there\u2019s something wrong behind what Master Lin said?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI felt that too. What he\u2019s saying is \u2018I can read your fortune for you but if I do, it would be meaningless.'\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck, is that for real? Why is it that I don\u2019t quite believe it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t quite believe it either.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cQian Qian, hurry up and ask him so we can broaden our horizons. As long as Master Lin says it, I\u2019ll send ten airplanes immediately.\u201d</p><br/><p>Naturally, Fang Qian could understand what Master Lin meant by that. She was very curious and she wanted to know very badly whether all this was true.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, can you please tell me? I really want to know,\u201d said Fang Qian.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-3\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Although Master Lin had said that it would be meaningless, she still really wanted to know.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled. \u201cAlright. You\u2019re doing a live broadcast right now too. If I don\u2019t tell you, you might lose face. Let me take a look for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing Master Lin\u2019s words, Fang Qian was exhilarated. Then, she waited eagerly. Right now, she wanted to know very badly where her other half was.</p><br/><p>\u201c666\u2026Master Lin is going to use his skills!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, I\u2019m not exaggerating, I\u2019m sure Master Lin will definitely be able to read her fortune.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRead my a*s. I don\u2019t believe it. And who would even be able to tell if what he says is true or not?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true. Even if Master Lin just makes something up, we wouldn\u2019t know. That makes this quite pointless.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt can\u2019t be helped.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, Lin Fan gazed at Fang Qian\u2019s face, studying it closely. His gaze made Fang Qian a little panicky.</p><br/><p>She felt as if Master Lin\u2019s eyes could see through her.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-4\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Minutes and seconds passed by.</p><br/><p>The netizens in the broadcast room were getting a little impatient.</p><br/><p>\u201cHas Master Lin managed to read her fortune or not?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShh, be patient. Master Lin is exerting his powers.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. What\u2019s the rush?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m filled with anticipation. I wonder what Master Lin will say.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Lin Fan\u2019s heart was in a bit of a mess. He had discovered that something bad was going to happen to this young lady and it wasn\u2019t just anything.</p><br/><p>Initially, he had really wanted to look at her marriage fate but as he kept looking, he realized that something wasn\u2019t right.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, how is it?\u201d asked Fang Qian cautiously.</p><br/><p>It was actually her first time having her fortune read. She didn\u2019t believe in these things at all because to her, these were all to scam people.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan took a deep breath. \u201cI\u2019ve seen two things. I want you to pick one. The first concerns your safety and the second is what you wanted me to read, your marriage fate. Right now, you have to choose one. Which will it be?\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-5\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Fang Qian was taken aback. She felt like Master Lin really had many tricks up his sleeves. In order not to have to give her a clear answer, he had actually come up with such a tactic.</p><br/><p>But if she really had to choose, of course, she would choose her own safety.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, the netizens in the broadcast room couldn\u2019t take it anymore.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck, there\u2019s too much meaning within what Master Lin said. I\u2019m getting a little scared.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe saw two things? What does that one about her safety mean?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t really understand but look at Master Lin\u2019s expression. He looks very grave. It must be something big.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy a*s. That\u2019s just his normal expression. The fortune-teller below my home always has a grave expression when he\u2019s reading fortunes as well. It\u2019s as if the sky is falling.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Fang Qian said, \u201cMaster Lin, even if you don\u2019t want to say it, you can\u2019t make me choose between the two. But I\u2019ll choose the first one. After all, it concerns my safety.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded. \u201cWhen you go back, stay far away from any large concrete mixer trucks. Don\u2019t go near them. Take a detour instead. Alright, I\u2019ve told you. You have to be alert.\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-6\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Fang Qian was startled and she couldn\u2019t quite recover from it. She felt as if Master Lin was lying to her. \u201cMaster Lin, is that all?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shook his head. \u201cWhat more do you want? You have to remember this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fang Qian looked at Master Lin\u2019s grave expression, then smiled as she nodded. \u201cAlright. I got it, Master Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>She felt that Master Lin was tricking her. She replied that way because she didn\u2019t want Master Lin to be put in a tough spot, so she decided to help by playing along.</p><br/><p>Now that there was nothing more to do, Lin Fan waved at her. \u201cAlright, it\u2019s been great bumping into you. I\u2019m going to head back first. Remember what I said. Stay far away. You must stay far away\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright. See you, Master Lin.\u201d Fang Qian waved back.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan got in his car and left. He hadn\u2019t expected to be able to do a good deed while coming out to fish. He felt pretty good.</p><br/><p>Fang Qian stood in the same spot as she faced the camera. \u201cIt\u2019s regretful that I didn\u2019t manage to find out. Alright, let\u2019s go home then.\u201d</p><br/><p>The netizens in the broadcast room were making a lot of noise.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have to listen to Master Lin. Take a detour. Don\u2019t neglect his words.\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-7\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cHaha, Qian Qian will listen for sure. Otherwise, something really bad would happen.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you ask me, Master Lin has made our Qian Qian terrified.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI believe in Master Lin very much. Taking a detour will be the safest. Don\u2019t ignore what he said, Qian Qian.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fang Qian looked at the comments and laughed. \u201cThat\u2019s enough. I\u2019ll broadcast the journey home now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>After some time.</p><br/><p>Fang Qian came out from the train and walked towards her apartment block. At that moment, a rumbling sound rang out. In front, a concrete mixer truck was operating.</p><br/><p>She wasn\u2019t bothered by it and she was going to squeeze past it to enter her apartment block.</p><br/><p>Then, the netizens who were in the broadcast room were startled. They remembered what Master Lin had said and they quickly started commenting.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck, it\u2019s a concrete mixer truck! Qian Qian, take a detour!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cQuick, Qian Qian, take a detour. You have to listen to Master Lin\u2019s words. You can\u2019t disobey him!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha. Now, another choice has appeared. Will our Qian Qian bravely go forward or will she listen to Master Lin and take a detour?\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-8\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Fang Qian looked at the comments and was stunned. She stopped in her tracks. Especially when she saw so many people causing a ruckus, she couldn\u2019t help but laugh.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, since I\u2019m such a scaredy-cat, I\u2019ll take a detour.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p></div>\n</div>"}

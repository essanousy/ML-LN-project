When the host was interviewing Zhenping Yiming, he was a lot more humble compared to before, and he didn\u2019t dare to boast anymore. Compared to his old self, it was worlds apart.</p><br/><p>This caused the host to be more comfortable. If it were like that before, it wouldn\u2019t be a problem.</p><br/><p>It required the intervention of Master Lin. From the host\u2019s perspective, Zhenping Yiming had abandoned all hope, and the trauma had already gripped him. It would take more than a few months for him to recover from his loss.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan sat calmly on the seat of the guest of honor, waiting for the program to end.</p><br/><p>For the audience, this could finally be considered to be a normal program. If it were like before, it would have been uncomfortable to watch on.</p><br/><p>One of the other guests of honor leaned over to Lin Fan, \u201cMaster Lin, you were really amazing just now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled calmly, \u201cYes, but friendship and sportsmanship are more important than the competition itself.\u201d</p><br/><p>The guest of honor chuckled. What sportsmanship and friendship? It was a bloodbath watching Zhenping Yiming\u2019s spirit getting crushed just now.</p><br/><p>However, it was quite entertaining to watch the match just now.</p><br/><p>Not long after.</p><br/><p>The program ended.</p><br/><p>Zhenping Yiming didn\u2019t have any face to stay there any longer. He had just clinched the Asia Pacific title a while back, but now?</p><br/><p>He came to China to join a TV program and was beaten flat by some unknown player. He didn\u2019t know how the media was going to portray him tomorrow.</p><br/><p>He left the stadium</p><br/><p>President Liu rushed over, \u201cMaster Lin, wait.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan stopped in his tracks, \u201cPresident Liu, what happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis\u2026 Master Lin. Could you consider being our teacher for this program? You don\u2019t have to worry about the pay. It\u2019ll definitely be better than the \u2018Strongest Heavenly Voice\u2019.\u201d President Liu couldn\u2019t just let Lin Fan go like that. From his perspective, Master Lin was the embodiment of wonder, and if anything went wrong in the program, Lin Fan always had the solution to it. The program today was a testament to it- if it weren\u2019t for Master Lin, the program would have been a disaster.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, Master Lin had a huge and scary fan base.</p><br/><p>Too many fans and their loyalty was unwavering.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan pondered for a while. He didn\u2019t want to take on even more responsibility since he already had a lot of other things to take care of. Furthermore, always appearing on television clashed with his personal philosophy.</p><br/><p>\u201cPresident Liu, I\u2019m sorry, but I\u2019ll have to turn you down on this one. I\u2019ll be quite busy so I don\u2019t think I can commit to this one. Thank you for the offer and love though.\u201d</p><br/><p>President Liu looked a little disappointed since he really wanted Master Lin to be Shanghai Satellite TV Network\u2019s main teacher or guest of honor.</p><br/><p>From the previous times that he had worked with him, he could see that Master Lin had been an effective addition to the shows that he had been involved in.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat a shame. However, if you ever feel like taking up the offer again, just tell us. Shanghai Satellite TV Network welcomes you always.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled, \u201cAlright, no problem.\u201d</p><br/><p>President Liu had been courteous and respectful to him consistently and Lin Fan had to reciprocate the sentiment.</p><br/><p>If you treated others with respect, they would definitely do the same. This was a two-way relationship.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The next day.</p><br/><p>The news went viral all over the internet.</p><br/><p>\u2018Master Lin says: I never thought he would be that weak.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Asia Pacific table tennis champion Zhenping Yiming gets trashed by Master Lin breaks down in the middle of the match.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Zhenping Yiming\u2019s painful trip to China.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Professional in our neighborhood! Master Lin shows you how real table tennis is played.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn, what happened today? I just opened the news and this happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat just happened? What did I miss?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSince when was Master Lin a table tennis player? This isn\u2019t right. I\u2019ve never seen him touch a table tennis racquet before.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn, the person up there. Didn\u2019t you watch the newest program that aired on Shanghai Satellite TV yesterday? Watch it, you won\u2019t regret it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck, alright. I\u2019ll watch it now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Most netizens didn\u2019t know what had happened the day before, and all of them rushed to watch the video that was posted online.</p><br/><p>Not long after, the netizens all started firing comments.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck your mom, who was the one who promoted that video for us? Do you want us to feel bad?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn, such an arrogant Japanese! He\u2019s just mocking us. What kind of watch is this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t rush it, watch it to the ending. The ending is the good part.\u201d</p><br/><p>A few netizens stopped after watching the first part of the video. It went without saying that the video caused a few people to burst out in anger.</p><br/><p>However, after seeing the ending, the anger of the people subsided as they returned to their peaceful state.</p><br/><p>The people who had seen the live broadcast still watched the video repeatedly. It was just too good, especially Master Lin\u2019s logic-defying skills. It was a feast for the eyes.</p><br/><p>Not long after.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck, 666\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin could use that skill to crush the whole world.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI just want to ask if he\u2019s playing the same sport as we are?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, this is just too hilarious! Zhenping Yiming got trashed to the point of crying!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo awesome! However, Master Lin was a little too shameless! He had thrashed that guy flat and he still continued to mock him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>In Japan.</p><br/><p>The news agencies there also published the news.</p><br/><p>Before Zhenping Yiming participated in the program, the local reporters had already written the draft of the newspaper report.</p><br/><p>For example:</p><br/><p>Japanese Table tennis rises, overtakes China.</p><br/><p>The pride of Japan, number one seed in Asia.</p><br/><p>All the headlines were all flashy and full of praise, but after watching the live broadcast, the</p><br/><p>people were all stunned.</p><br/><p>Zhenping Yiming was trashed by a Chinese man.</p><br/><p>They didn\u2019t what to report.</p><br/><p>The people of Japan who had watched the video had their hopes and their pride of having a table tennis champion in their country dashed. They couldn\u2019t believe what had just happened.</p><br/><p>As for Zhenping Yiming himself, he returned back home with his tail between his legs after the program ended.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t dare to stay in China any longer.</p><br/><p>He knew for certain how he won the competition.</p><br/><p>Xu Song\u2019s old injury had come back but he didn\u2019t care since a win was a win. However, his joy was short-lived as only moments later, he was destroyed by an unknown Chinese player.</p><br/><p>Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>A familiar sight greeted Master Lin as he stepped foot into Cloud Street- a group of journalists waiting for Lin Fan for an interview.</p><br/><p>The other shop owners all looked on with curiosity, \u201cLittle Boss, what happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t watch TV last night?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat TV? I\u2019ve been working so hard I don\u2019t have enough any energy to turn on the television.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s your loss then. Little Boss faced off with the Japanese champion and trashed him on live television.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh? Did Little Boss beat someone up again?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBeat your sister. Forget it, go and look at the news yourself. I\u2019m too lazy to explain this to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The journalists felt that Master Lin was simply too interesting. The New Year had just passed and another huge news involving him happened again.</p><br/><p>And this wasn\u2019t any ordinary news. He thrashed an arrogant Japanese table tennis champion, who was seeded first in Asia.</p><br/><p>What else could one say?</p><br/><p>The most important thing was that Master Lin was just an amateur athlete.</p><br/><p>A Japanese professional lost to an amateur athlete- if he wanted to find back his honor, he would have to dig for it.</p></div>\n</div>"}

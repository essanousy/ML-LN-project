To all the spectators, the \u2018Strongest Heavenly Voice\u2019 had ended too quickly and they just couldn\u2019t bear it.</p><br/><p>Master Lin especially couldn\u2019t bear it. This was the first time that he had participated in such a long variety show and the feeling it gave him was amazing.</p><br/><p>However, the variety show was coming to an end.</p><br/><p>The presenter said, \u201cThe contestants part of the \u2018Strongest Heavenly Voice\u2019 has concluded. However, I\u2019ve just received the news that the spectators don\u2019t want it to end and wish for it to continue. As a result, for our closing program, we will have the 4 teachers sing for the audience to end off the show.\u201d</p><br/><p>When this sentence was spoken, all of the audience got excited.</p><br/><p>On the web.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is so awkward. Master Lin looks like he isn\u2019t able to sing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat may not be true. Master Lin is so good at producing music, how can he not be able to sing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMakes sense. I can\u2019t wait for it to start.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI bet 10 packs of Spicy Stripes that Master Lin\u2019s singing will be the worst.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c^ The first half of your sentence moved me but the other half makes me want to hit you to death.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, don\u2019t lose faith in our Master Lin. Although I don\u2019t really believe in him, I\u2019m still very eagerly awaiting it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>On the scene, Lin Fan was a little awkward. He did not think that there was this closing program. Could it be that the Heavens deliberately arranged this?</p><br/><p>They knew that he had opened up a new class of knowledge and wanted him to show it off on stage.</p><br/><p>If it really was like that, then it could be quite fun.</p><br/><p>Huo Jian Xiang had a sinister smile and said, \u201cTeacher Lin, how\u2019s your singing? Although my students weren\u2019t able to beat you, but I definitely won\u2019t lose to you on stage.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan glanced over and said, \u201cYou\u2019ll definitely lose. My singing is amazing. Once you hear it you\u2019ll feel like crying.\u201d</p><br/><p>Huo Jian Xiang shook her head, and said, \u201cI don\u2019t believe that. Based on your voice when you talk, your throat is actually not bad. However, if you want to beat me, it\u2019ll be very tough.</p><br/><p>Zhao Li and Liu Ying Dong were looking forward to it and both hoped to beat Lin Fan on stage. Although they lost to him in other fields, this was now their field of expertise.</p><br/><p>To be able to stand out in the music industry, their voices were definitely very good. Even better than that of the contestants.</p><br/><p>The most important thing to a singer is their voice. Although their position in the music industry wasn\u2019t low, they did not smoke or drink alcohol. They were constantly taking good care of their throats so as to let it always be in peak condition.</p><br/><p>They were not like that Ying Jin who always smoked and drunk. Her throat was long gone already.</p><br/><p>She was just hanging on by her status only.</p><br/><p>If they were to really sing together, Ying Jin\u2019s current state could not even match up to any of the students.</p><br/><p>The host said, \u201cLet us have Teacher Liu on stage.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Ying Dong was very confident and calm, having no signs of fear at all. He stood on the stage with a large smile on her face and said, \u201cAlthough my student did not become the champion, however, as a teacher, I have to uphold my position. Thus, this song is for everyone out there.\u201d</p><br/><p>The audience were all eagerly waiting.</p><br/><p>They never thought that after listening to the students compete that they would be able to hear the voices of the big shots.</p><br/><p>Although Liu Ying Dong was not a very loud person, you cannot help feeling that his voice was unique, could stand out and had a good origin.</p><br/><p>His voice was a little hoarse but nonetheless, that was his distinguishing feature.</p><br/><p>The audience were all lost in his music. At this moment, the entire venue was in silence.</p><br/><p>When Liu Ying Dong was done, the audience applauded him.</p><br/><p>\u201cAmazing. It\u2019s really too amazing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis song is worth hearing a hundred times.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cToday is really a blessed day, to actually be able to hear him sing live.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Ying Dong smiled and was very satisfied as he left the stage.</p><br/><p>When the students all heard the teacher\u2019s voice, they were all in admiration. They thought that their singing was very good but when compared to the teacher\u2019s they were still very far off.</p><br/><p>They realized that there was still a long way to go on their journey and they needed to keep working hard.</p><br/><p>Zhao Li went onto the stage. Although there were many in the audience who did not like her, but as much as they hated to admit it, her voice struck them harder. It brought about a lot of emotions.</p><br/><p>When she was done, the audience was not stingy in giving Zhao Li any applause.</p><br/><p>When Zhao Li heard this applause, she felt like crying.</p><br/><p>She also felt that if the shady business had not been settled, she wouldn\u2019t know what she would do.</p><br/><p>She loved everything she had right now and she loved the sound of the applause from the audience. If she lost all of that, she did not know how she could keep going on.</p><br/><p>In the end, there was a thread of glistening teardrops at the corner of her eye as she walked back towards the judges\u2019 panel. At the same time, she vowed never to get involved in any more shady business.</p><br/><p>Huo Jian Xiang smiled and said, \u201cHow are you feeling Teacher Lin?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed and said, \u201cNot bad, all of them are not bad. However, I feel like they are still a little bit below me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBrag, keep bragging. I\u2019m next up on stage. Looks like the Shanghai TV wants you to be the finale,\u201d Huo Jian Xiang smiled and said.</p><br/><p>Right now he was very convinced about this Master Lin.</p><br/><p>That he was very awesome.</p><br/><p>To be able to take care of Ying Jin, he could not help being convinced.</p><br/><p>However, he was still not convinced about him in the music field yet. He had to give a good performance and show his true artistic abilities.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cTeacher Huo, I\u2019m eagerly waiting for your performance. Don\u2019t disappoint me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll hear my voice in a moment.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Huo Jian Xiang appeared, the audience was even more eager.</p><br/><p>A lot of the audience grew up listening to Huo Jian Xiang\u2019s songs.</p><br/><p>In this generation, everyone knew Huo Jian Xiang. Even right now, in KTV, everyone would be singing his songs.</p><br/><p>For the actual person to be on stage today, everyone was all eagerly awaiting his performance.</p><br/><p>When Huo Jian Xiang stepped onto the stage, he said, \u201cGreeting audience, come give a loud applause. I was just talking to Teacher Lin just now and I have to show my true artistic ability and let him know that I, Elder Huo, maybe old but not old at heart and my voice has even more flavor now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher Huo is really very funny.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen Teacher Huo was young, I was already listening to his music. His character was like that even back then.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t wait for this. He has to put pressure on Master Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>This song, even now, was still not old. That simple voice really showed the true flavor of the lyrics.</p><br/><p>To the audience, it was a pleasure.</p><br/><p>All the past memories were coming back to them.</p><br/><p>One song finished.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan clapped for him and said, \u201cTeacher Huo, you singing this has put a lot of pressure on me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Huo Jian Xiang relaxed his voice and then smiled and said, \u201cNow you know how good I am.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed and said, \u201cEven though I know it now, you still can\u2019t beat me. There is still a small gap between us.\u201d</p><br/><p>The audience sighed. They were not trying to taunt Lin Fan but it was just too funny.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher Lin is lost in his own confidence. No matter how bad it is later, we should still just applaud him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. I\u2019ve never heard Master Lin sing before. I should count myself as lucky this time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you guys think that Master Lin\u2019s voice will be good or not?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou guys are thinking too much. This Master Lin is not a singer, how can he compare with these professionals?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s not right. The music Master Lin has produced is amazing, how can he not be able to sing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cProducing music is producing music. It is different from actually singing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The host said, \u201cNext, let us have Master Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan got up and had a smile on his smile. Then he waved to the audience and walked up the stage.</p><br/><p>The presenter said, \u201cMaster Lin, what are you going to sing?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan confidently said, \u201cAn original piece.\u201d</p><br/><p>The entire audience was stunned and then burst out in cheers.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, Master Lin is actually going to sing an original song.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been awhile since Master Lin has made an original piece.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I never thought my luck would actually be so good.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m very excited.\u201d</p><br/><p>The host said, \u201cMaster Lin, what instruments do you need?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cWait a moment, I\u2019m thinking about what to sing. To accompany this? I don\u2019t need anything. I\u2019ll go acapella.\u201d</p><br/><p>There was an uproar.</p><br/><p>Huo Jian Xiang looked at Lin Fan and was dumbfounded. He never thought that Master Lin would go acapella. He really must be a little overconfident.</p><br/><p>Liu Ying Dong and Zhao Li looked at each other and helplessly laughed.</p><br/><p>To see someone with so much confidence was rare.</p><br/><p>However, they were all very eager to hear what this original piece was. Whether it would be a masterpiece like the ones before.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

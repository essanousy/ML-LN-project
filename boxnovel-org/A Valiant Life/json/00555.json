If their identities were leaked onto the internet, they would be screwed big time. Word would spread quickly and everyone would know who they were through the internet.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh, now you\u2019re scared?\u201d Lin Fan laughed maniacally. \u201cNow then you\u2019re scared. What were you doing before?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tear!</p><br/><p>The identities of the five youngsters were leaked onto the live broadcast.</p><br/><p>\u201cFinally, their real faces. What about you guys search for their profiles.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThese few sons of b*tches. Finally, they get the comeuppance. Who\u2019s the arrogant one now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cArrogant your ass. Now someone is going to whoop your ass.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cQuickly, call the police. You cannot let these b*stards run off.\u201d</p><br/><p>The people of the live broadcast started getting aggressive, releasing torrents of hate and death threats.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck your mothers,\u201d Wang Ming Yang went up and slapped them on their faces, berating them. \u201cYou guys are animals! How dare you come here to cause trouble? Do you have a death wish?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang had drank quite a bit beforehand and he slapped harder than usual. However, he wasn\u2019t standing steady.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan motioned to Wang Ming Yang. \u201cMing Yang, sit here. The night is still young. Let\u2019s play with them for a bit.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang hissed at the youngsters, before sitting next to Lin Fan. Suddenly, his hand shot out and slapped one of the youngsters. \u201cWhat was that look? Do you have a problem with me?\u201d</p><br/><p>The five youngsters lowered their heads, not daring to say anything.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan pointed the phone at the five of them, \u201cCome, let\u2019s introduce yourselves to us one by one, you first.\u201d</p><br/><p>The first youngster who was being filmed on live broadcast looked downwards, not wanting the camera to catch his face. \u201cWho the hell are you guys? What does our business have to do with you guys? I\u2019m still not of age, so hitting me is a crime. I\u2019ll sue you,\u201d he said resentfully.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha,\u201d Lin Fan laughed as he heard what the youngster said.</p><br/><p>The people in the live broadcast room immediately exploded with approval.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn, the law should change. All these brats are so big and they aren\u2019t of age yet?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, a lot of crimes committed now are by juveniles.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSecond Commander, where is my Italian Cannon? Bring it out!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, don\u2019t use that. Where is my machete which is used to slaughter pigs?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI really feel like strangling that pig to death.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Lin Fan grabbed the youngster\u2019s hair, raising his head upwards. \u201cCome, let everyone have a detailed look at who you are. Do you know who I am?\u201d</p><br/><p>The youngster looked at Lin Fan with a face of disgust. \u201cWho the f*ck cares who you are? You are trespassing our territory.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still that stubborn? I tell you, the person that is going to hit you is me, Lin Fan. If you can\u2019t remember my name, just remember it as Master Lin. You want to make a report against me? Sue me then!\u201d</p><br/><p>Slap!</p><br/><p>The youngster\u2019s cheek was marked with a streak of red.</p><br/><p>\u201cTell me, what is your name and where are you from?\u201d</p><br/><p>The other youngsters who were standing there were dumbfounded after hearing the name \u2018Master Lin\u2019, shuddering in fear.</p><br/><p>He was the last person they wanted to meet.</p><br/><p>The people in the live broadcast went quiet.</p><br/><p>Master Lin\u2019s name was famous on the internet. In the past few months, it had been trending non-stop as he continued to accomplish feat after feat.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn, is that real or fake? Is that really Master Lin?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWow, how did I not notice it earlier? That person is Master Lin?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn, these few youngsters really are unlucky to have met Master Lin tonight. You guys are screwed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone knows that Master Lin loves to seek justice and will stop at nothing to screw the person over if they do something evil. Just take for instance his hacking case when he tried to track down the scammer after he had caused the death of an old person without any questions asked. He got a one-month jail sentence for hacking into the bank and police servers but he regretted nothing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat a pleasant surprise. Master Lin better teach these people a good lesson, and let them know the real consequences of their despicable actions.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan turned to the driver who was standing at one side. \u201cCome, hold on to the phone and point it towards these brats.\u201d</p><br/><p>The driver knew that President Wang and Master Lin were both drunk, and they probably didn\u2019t know that they slapped harder when they were drunk. From their actions, anyone could tell that they were drunk.</p><br/><p>The five youngsters said their names clearly and honestly.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan pointed at all of them, as he started to lecture them vehemently and passionately. However, Wang Ming Yang couldn\u2019t take it anymore.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is the point of lecturing them? Dammit, just beat them senseless already,\u201d Wang Ming Yang said.</p><br/><p>The driver who was filming the youngsters couldn\u2019t help but gulp in worry. He had followed Wang Ming Yang for many years since he had started out. He knew that President Wang had always been a violent person and would always use physical force. After he had become a little richer and more well-known, he controlled himself and stayed low-profile, not daring to hit anyone. He never thought that the old Wang Ming Yang would resurface when he was drunk.\u201d</p><br/><p>In the live broadcast room.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn, this guy is really aggressive. Although it feels good to see those brats get whacked, why do I have the feeling that it is bordering cruelty?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, that\u2019s the whole point of it. If it isn\u2019t aggressive enough, they wouldn\u2019t learn their lesson.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s for sure.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThese guys give military enthusiasts a bad name. They deserve every single blow.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Lin Fan reached out and stopped Wang Ming Yang. \u201cMing Yang, don\u2019t hit them anymore. This isn\u2019t good.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang pointed at the youngsters, berating them. Thereafter, he obeyed Lin Fan and stopped slapping them. However, his current state wasn\u2019t stable, as if he could burst out in another bout of violence again.</p><br/><p>One of the youngsters couldn\u2019t take it anymore, his eyes bloodshot with rage. \u201cI want to make a police report, you guys are just abusing us.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSlap!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shot out and slapped his face. \u201cCall the police? You guys want to call the police? Stop bullshitting with me and be a little more well-behaved, otherwise, I might really beat you guys up.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang looked at Lin Fan, frowning. \u201cI thought you said no hitting people?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally? I forgot. Okay, I won\u2019t hit them now.\u201d Lin Fan glared at the youngsters, pointing behind him. \u201cDo you know what this place is?\u201d</p><br/><p>The youngsters remained silent, not wanting to say anything.</p><br/><p>They were at loss on what to do. They had just been slapped multiple times and they had been roughed up quite badly.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan pointed at one of the youngster\u2019s head, saying in a serious tone, \u201cI asked a damn question! Do you know where this place is? Are you deaf?\u201d</p><br/><p>The person was frightened. \u201cI know, I know. This place is Fourth Avenue Depot.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat seven day challenge? You guys are absolutely unpatriotic. Sing the national anthem for me,\u201d Lin Fan commanded, slapping them again.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d the five youngsters looked up at Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan raised his voice, \u201cDo you not understand what I\u2019m saying? I said, sing the national anthem. If you don\u2019t sing it, I\u2019ll make sure I\u2019ll beat you guys up so hard.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother, don\u2019t hit anymore. You really packed a punch back there, and their faces are already bleeding. I thought you said you won\u2019t hit them anymore?\u201d Wang Ming Yang asked Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, looks like I forgot again. I won\u2019t hit them next time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang was speechless.</p><br/><p>In the live broadcast room.</p><br/><p>The audience was dumbfounded. They were convinced by Master Lin.</p><br/><p>\u201cThese guys are really unlucky to have met Master Lin, but how come something doesn\u2019t seem right with Master Lin?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin obviously had been drinking before this. Didn\u2019t you see his red eyes just now? He was stumbling while walking just now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn, could it be that we are watching Drunken Fist Fan? The ruthless Master Lin?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLooks like it. Master Lin was really ruthless when he beat those youngsters up. He caused them to bleed after just one hit.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAll these guys are really unlucky. Out of all the people that passed by tonight, it wasn\u2019t just Master Lin, but a drunk one for that matter. Have you seen the news about Master Lin beating up Han Lu before?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen that before. Master Lin is the president of the Martial Arts Association. He definitely hits harder than all of us. It\u2019s a miracle that these brats are still alive.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat a tragedy! I\u2019m not going to sleep tonight. I want to see how Master Lin deals with these guys.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, it\u2019s already two o\u2019clock in the morning now, and I have something on at nine in the morning tomorrow. I really apologize if there are any Japanese left-wing representatives here who are watching. If they saw Fourth Avenue vandalized, do you think something big would happen?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn, I really think something big might happen.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDammit, this is such an embarrassment to us.\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

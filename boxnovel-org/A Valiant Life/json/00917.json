Especially now that Lin Fan\u2019s fame was getting bigger and bigger, practically everyone in Shanghai knew about the \u2018Master Lin\u2019 shop.</p><br/><p>To many people, this Master Lin was a little strange. He already had so much fame but he still only ran a small shop. It was really quite strange.</p><br/><p>Moreover, he only sold scallion pancakes and his secondary occupation was fortune-telling.</p><br/><p>It could even be said to be exceptionally strange.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-2\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Fraud Tian sat at the entrance, smoking his cigarette. Looking at the increasing number of people, he felt an aching in his heart. These were all walking dollar bills. They could easily earn money from these people but it couldn\u2019t be helped since the kid was so stubborn. He would only sell ten servings of scallion pancakes a day. How much could they possibly earn from that?</p><br/><p>But honestly, ever since Fraud Tian had started following that kid, he felt as if his life had become a lot more interesting. It was a huge difference from before.</p><br/><p>But even this kid couldn\u2019t help him leave his single life. This made him a little disappointed.</p><br/><p>It seemed that he would have to work hard on his own regarding that.</p><br/><p>Noontime.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan had completed all his work. He packed his fishing rod and started his car. He was about to go fishing again.</p><br/><p>\u201cLook after the shop for me. I\u2019m going out.\u201d He realized that fishing felt pretty good. It really could allow one to quieten one\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>But the slightly f*cked up part was that he hadn\u2019t fished up any legendary items yet. All he had been fishing up were strange and random things. That was pretty f*cked up.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-3\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang saw that Lin Fan was going to fish and instantly became excited. Then, he came forward shamelessly. \u201cBrother Lin, bring me along, won\u2019t you? My fishing skills are pretty awesome.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan glanced at Zhao Zhong Yang. He definitely couldn\u2019t bring this guy along. If he fished up some big monster, it would probably scare this guy to death.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo way. Just stay here and look after the shop. See ya!\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, he immediately left.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian, who was sitting at the entrance, chuckled. \u201cStop being lazy, kid. Our boss\u2019s lifestyle isn\u2019t something you can experience.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian still held a grudge against Zhao Zhong Yang. He still remembered what had happened a while back. Hence, whenever the opportunity came up, he had to insult Zhao Zhong Yang.</p><br/><p>\u201cFraud, are you trying to battle it out with me?\u201d Zhao Zhong Yang had long felt that Fraud Tian had developed ill-intentions towards him.</p><br/><p>But he wasn\u2019t bothered by it. He was a resourceful person.</p><br/><p>As long as he slowly leaked out some information, he could guarantee that Fraud would immediately start sucking up to him.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-4\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>By the river.</p><br/><p>This time, Lin Fan chose a better location. There was no one around and no one would come across this place. He could peacefully fish.</p><br/><p>He hooked on the bait, cast the rod, and sat there waiting quietly.</p><br/><p>The water surface was very calm. He wondered what he would catch this time. At the same time, he was very curious. How did all these strange things come up? It didn\u2019t feel right.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, he felt a tug on his rod. His face lit up.</p><br/><p><em>It\u2019s here! This time, it was really quicker than usual.</em></p><br/><p><em>I wonder what I\u2019ll get this time.</em></p><br/><p>He really wanted to get a medicinal herb. The two types of herbs that he had accumulated were all good ingredients for pill-crafting but he didn\u2019t have enough types of herbs to craft the pill he wanted yet.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s here. Let me see what you\u2019ll give me this time!\u201d Lin Fan was completely focused as he gazed forward, pulling his fishing rod.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, what\u2019s this?\u201d A dark and swarthy object reflected the sunlight in front of him.</p><br/><p>It looked like something good but then again, not really.</p><br/><p>When the object reached his hands, he frowned. <em>What is this thing?</em></p><div class=\"code-block code-block-5\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>However, he could feel a sense of power emanating from this pill.</p><br/><p>\u201cDahuan pill. Increases power by 60 years\u2019 worth.\u201d</p><br/><p>He understood now. He hadn\u2019t expected to obtain a godly pill from the Shaolin monasteries of Wuxia films.</p><br/><p>If he was completely weak and powerless, he would have been exhilarated but now, he just felt normal. After all, this wouldn\u2019t be of much use to him.</p><br/><p>He pondered for a moment before deciding to swallow the pill anyway.</p><br/><p>A burst of heat circulated around his body. Then, it disappeared like a drop of water entering the sea. It didn\u2019t even cause a ripple.</p><br/><p>\u201cMeaningless. Completely meaningless.\u201d Lin Fan shook his head before casting his fishing rod again and quietly sitting in wait.</p><br/><p>Time passed, minute by minute, second by second. Nothing got hooked.</p><br/><p>\u201cGreetings, Master Lin.\u201d At that moment, a voice came from behind.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan turned around curiously and saw an old-timer being supported by a lady as they stood before him.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-6\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cYou are\u2026?\u201d Lin Fan didn\u2019t recognize this old man but, seeing some silhouettes in the distance, he already had a rough idea. This old man wasn\u2019t simple. He even had bodyguards with him. He seemed to be an important person.</p><br/><p>But whether or not he was important meant nothing to Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>In Lin Fan\u2019s eyes, it was all the same.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, I\u2019m the Chairman of IOA Human Genome Corporation. I\u2019m here today because I\u2019d like to discuss a business deal with Master Lin.\u201d The old-timer\u2019s eyes had a fiery gleam to them.</p><br/><p>To him, this Master Li was really too mystical. He was so mystical that it made them a little excited.</p><br/><p>\u201cIOA?\u201d Lin Fan really didn\u2019t know what this corporation was supposed to be. But that gaze from the old man made him a little lost for words. It was as if this old man saw Lin Fan as some kind of treasure.</p><br/><p>\u201cIOA is a company which was established overseas. It supports human research. To us, humans are creatures with the most potential in this world. Every cell and every organ is perfectly made. I think, if we unveil the inner treasures of the human body, it would definitely bring about a huge change in human life.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFor example, immortality\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked lifeless. He had been shocked by this old man\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>To the old-timer, Lin Fan\u2019s expression was just what he had expected. Because no one could resist the allure of immortality.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-7\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>The reason he was here this time was simple. He had developed an interest in Lin Fan\u2019s Chinese medical abilities, especially in his mystical pill-crafting. He felt that if he wanted to take his research one step further, he would require Master Lin\u2019s help.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Lin Fan stood up.</p><br/><p>A grin appeared on the old-timer\u2019s face. But in an instant, it vanished.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan kept his fishing rod and looked at the old man alertly. \u201cSorry, but I\u2019m not interested in multi-level marketing. You\u2019ve found the wrong person\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, he dusted off his pants before preparing to leave.</p><br/><p><em>D*mn, that\u2019s dangerous. That\u2019s way too dangerous.</em></p><br/><p><em>There are even old men coming out to scam people now. And he even talked about immortality. He must be trying to scam me into joining a criminal group.</em></p></div>\n</div>"}

It wasn\u2019t only Zhao Li and the audience who were objecting Lin Fan\u2019s judgment. Even Liu Ying Dong stood up in defiance.</p><br/><p>\u201cI like this contestant. As long as I\u2019m around, I will not let him leave the stage.\u201d</p><br/><p>Huo Jian Xiang didn\u2019t know what Lin Fan was getting to, but he took things calmly, \u201cDon\u2019t panic everyone, Teacher Lin definitely has his reasons for his judgment.\u201d Thereafter, he looked at Lin Fan, \u201cTeacher Lin, please explain why you said what you said.\u201d</p><br/><p>The vice-president was dumbfounded. He wanted so badly to go up to the stage and speak with Lin Fan. However, it was a live broadcast and there couldn\u2019t be any problems.</p><br/><p>All he could do was wait backstage and hope for the best.</p><br/><p>All the other contestants who were waiting backstage also started becoming curious. What on earth was going on? The rules of the competition weren\u2019t like that.</p><br/><p>Following the rules of the competition, as long as one Teacher give the green light for the contestant to be under them, they could stay in the competition.</p><br/><p>Teacher Zhao had already given Huang Fei the green light. Why did Teacher Lin still ask the contestant to leave the stage?</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at Huang Fei, calmly talking, \u201cJust now while you were singing, I opened my phone to check what guitar you were using. The guitar you are using is a \u2018Wei Ba\u2019 am I right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Huang Fei wanted to say something, but Lin Fan didn\u2019t give him the chance to say it, \u201cI was lucky enough. The guitar appeared on the top of the list when I searched it, and it\u2019s the exact same model. You said that you came from a poor, single family and that your mother is still sick. However, the guitar that you are holding costs sixteen thousand eight hundred dollars. It certainly isn\u2019t a cheap guitar. Is there anything you would like to say?\u201d</p><br/><p>After Lin Fan finished saying that, the people were all stunned.</p><br/><p>Huo Jian Xiang squinted, looking at the brand logo of the guitar. \u201cThat indeed is a \u2018Wei Ba\u2019 guitar,\u201d he said, his face looking stunned.</p><br/><p>Zhao Li gulped. Was there a problem?</p><br/><p>Online.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn, is that for real? A guitar that costs 16800 dollars? He said that his family was poor, and yet he still has that guitar?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHis mother is sick and he\u2019s struggling to pay the hospital bills, and he has this guitar? This\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha! Didn\u2019t I say before? Lin Fan has eyes of a phoenix, and there was definitely something wrong. Otherwise, he wouldn\u2019t say such things to the contestant.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe story has just begun, Master Lin isn\u2019t done yet.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut there could always be the possibility that the guitar is a gift from someone else.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026.</p><br/><p>On stage.</p><br/><p>Huang Fei was starting to panic, but he managed to calm himself down. He had already had a plan before starting, \u201cWhat Teacher Lin said is indeed correct. This guitar is indeed a \u2018Wei Ba\u2019 guitar, and it does cost more than ten thousand dollars. However, I did not buy this guitar with my own money. While I was singing at a bar, a lady gave this to me as a gift. She knew that I was struggling financially and so she bought this guitar for me as a gift to let me use it for performances such as this.\u201d</p><br/><p>His explanation was clear and logical.</p><br/><p>Zhao Li gave a huge smile, \u201cMaster Lin, is there a problem? Other people bought that guitar for him as a gift, so I don\u2019t see any problem with that.\u201d Thereafter, she turned to look at Huang Fei, \u201cThat girl must really like you. Even if you don\u2019t succeed in this competition, I do hope that I\u2019ll hear the good news that you two are a couple next time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Huang Fei nodded his head earnestly, \u201cTeacher Zhao, I definitely won\u2019t let you down. I have thought about it before. Even if I don\u2019t make it in this competition, I\u2019ll still confess my love for her. Although I am not stable financially now, I will work hard for her.\u201d</p><br/><p>Applause!</p><br/><p>The people in the crowd gave a standing ovation.</p><br/><p>At the same time, they looked at Lin Fan and were still befuddled. Teacher Lin still didn\u2019t look convinced.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher Lin, you can have your doubts, but you can\u2019t think badly of every single person that you come across,\u201d Liu Ying Dong said.</p><br/><p>\u201cYea, that is right. Master Lin, you may have good observational skills, but you can\u2019t think badly of everyone that you meet.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI pity Huang Fei. He had to go through that whole interrogation. That was completely unfair.\u201d</p><br/><p>Huang Fei heaved a sigh of relief. If it weren\u2019t for his quick-wittedness, he would never have slipped through.</p><br/><p>However, Lin Fan still wasn\u2019t convinced.</p><br/><p>After this was over, Lin Fan would definitely have one more hater.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan wasn\u2019t going to give up that easily. \u201cAlright, I\u2019ll give the guitar thing to you. I just have one more question. You said you come from a single parent family, but you don\u2019t seem like someone who comes from a single parent family. Both your parents are still alive, and they still have a good life. Furthermore, this is a singing competition, so why did you tell us your tragic backstory for us to hear?\u201d</p><br/><p>Huang Fei looked at Lin Fan in shock, cursing silently. He didn\u2019t know how that person knew so much about him, but it looked like the other party was able to see through him.</p><br/><p>No matter what, he couldn\u2019t expose himself. He stood extremely straight, as he spoke word by word, his voice breaking.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher Lin, I respect you for who you are, but what I said is true.\u201d</p><br/><p>His face looked like he was about to cry.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher Lin, that is enough,\u201d Zhao Li said, staring at Lin Fan. \u201cHow could you do this to someone? His father has passed away and you are making a mockery of it. Although we are teachers, we must still respect the contestants and their families.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Ying Dong put down his microphone, looking at Lin Fan in a dissatisfactory manner.</p><br/><p>The vice-president of the TV Network covered his face. S*it. The show just started and there\u2019s already a problem.</p><br/><p>At the same time, he felt a sense of regret. If he knew that this was going to happen, he would never have hired Master Lin.</p><br/><p>Dammit, too many regrets.</p><br/><p>Online.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn, it looks like Master Lin has gone overboard this time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, this is completely unfair for the contestant. Did you see his face? He looked like he was about to cry.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou guys shouldn\u2019t doubt Master Lin. He definitely has his reasons and you guys will regret sneering at him later.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck, Master Lin definitely has his reasons. The Qing Zhou Fan Club will always be supporting you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou guys are just scatterbrains.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have brains, so what?\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, a huge argument broke out online.</p><br/><p>The fans who had been shocked by Master Lin time after time before had sworn long ago never to betray their trust in Master Lin.</p><br/><p>Even if they had to follow him all the way to hell, they would do it and still trust him.</p><br/><p>The atmosphere on stage was tense, but Lin Fan didn\u2019t care. He stood up, \u201cThis is supposed to be just a singing competition, so your backstory was not needed. But since you like to tell stories, I will fully support it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher Cui, could I trouble you to go backstage to get the contestant\u2019s handphone?\u201d Lin Fan asked.</p><br/><p>The TV Host looked at Master Lin, thereafter nodding his head, \u201cAlright. Guys, hold on, I shall follow Teacher Lin\u2019s request.\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, Huang Fei looked really insecure and unsteady.</p><br/><p>What on earth was Teacher Lin going to do?</p></div>\n</div>"}

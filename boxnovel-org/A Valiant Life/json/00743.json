Did you realized something?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSince the evidence is out right now, Master Lin, is there anything you would like to say?\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporters asked him in such a messy manner. They were extremely excited. After waiting for so long, there has finally been another huge news.</p><br/><p>The surrounding shop owners stood outside.</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, Little boss is just too famous. Once again, he\u2019s attracted another bunch of reporters.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOur Little boss has said it correctly once again. One look and he\u2019s able to tell that Ying Jin wasn\u2019t a good person.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI remember someone\u2019s stall used to have Ying Jin as their avatar?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s mine. I took it down during this period of time. How can I leave it there when she was having a feud with Little boss? That\u2019s impossible.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAwesome! What a brother!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, no kidding. Little boss is precious to us. We have to protect him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved his hand, \u201cDear reporters, please quieten down. Please ask me one question at a time. There are so many of you guys here with so many mouths. How can I answer them all?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll first answer the first question. Why do I think that Chen Rui An was sabotaged? It\u2019s because the eyes are windows to the soul. I can his dedication and passion for music from his eyes. How can he have stolen someone else\u2019s song? It\u2019s not what I said. You guys can go and take a look at the show two years ago. With Chen Rui An\u2019s music and singing capabilities, even if he were to sing old songs, he would have won season with ease. Why would he need to steal anyone\u2019s song? Don\u2019t you guys think so too?\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporters nodded their heads. What he said made a lot of sense. It was exactly as he had said. They had watched the show two years ago. No matter what anyone said, Chen Rui An\u2019s voice was really good. Moreover, his singing capabilities were awesome. He could obviously have won the competition based on his voice alone. He didn\u2019t need to steal anyone\u2019s song.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan would definitely not say that he could tell just from his appearance. After all, he was now a public figure. If he were to put it like this, he wouldn\u2019t know if people would call it propaganda and superstitions.</p><br/><p>However, even if he were to say it, it wouldn\u2019t matter. He\u2019d let whoever that dared to fight counterfeiting come at him. He would just put down the other party so much so that they\u2019d pee their pants.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan momentarily thought about it for awhile, \u201cI\u2019d answer another question. Regarding Ying Jin, I have a very bad impression of her. This meddling woman is just too arrogant.\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporters were stunned. They didn\u2019t expect Master Lin to rage like this. Under the broad daylight and in front of countless cameras, he actually dared to call Ying Jin a meddling woman.</p><br/><p>This was very good.</p><br/><p>\u201cThink about her appearance. From her appearance, you can tell she\u2019s very petty. She also likes to act like a big shot. She doesn\u2019t put anyone in her eyes. She wouldn\u2019t be called Ying Jin if she doesn\u2019t meddle with dirty dealings. Oh, that\u2019s right, most netizens wouldn\u2019t be able to tell that those photos had been edited before. There\u2019s a huge difference with the actual person. As long as you listen to me, it\u2019s true.\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporters all just stared at Master Lin. They were all temporarily lost for words. They only acted based on muscle-memory and continued to snap their cameras.</p><br/><p>They realized that Master Lin bluntly devalued Ying Jin. His hatred for her must be huge.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan took a cup of tea from Wu You Lan and took a sip. Following which, his expression became serious.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe music world is a very strange place. How could there be any dirty dealings? Having dirty dealings is a very dangerous thing. I bet you guys never thought that it was actually stifling talents. If you meet a talented person, what would you do? It would definitely be to cultivate that person\u2019s talent, rather than to use underhanded means to suppress and yet envy his or her talent. For example, Ying Jin suppressed Chen Rui An wasn\u2019t all because of money. From what I can see, Ying Jin was actually jealous of Chen Rui An\u2019s talent.\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporters, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan continued to babble, \u201cAlso, there\u2019s that Zhao Li, who was also involved in the dirty dealings. This filled me with much disdain. It\u2019s too shameful to think that she\u2019s a mentor with someone that meddles with dirty dealings. In the recent years, they have been donating a lot of money and didn\u2019t continue to harm the newer generations. If it were me, I\u2019d have immediately withdrawn from the music industry, never to incite trouble again.\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporters were dumbstruck. They were filming everything he said. However, they felt that something wasn\u2019t quite right.</p><br/><p>What he said was rather harsh. If this were to be broadcast, it would definitely get a lot of attention.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan secretly gave Lin Fan a tug. Even though she had been standing beside Brother Lin all these while, there were some things that he couldn\u2019t go overboard saying.</p><br/><p>It would incite a lot of hatred.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan saw what Wu You Lan was trying to do and momentarily laughed.</p><br/><p>How helpful.</p><br/><p>\u201cLook! My friend thinks that my words have been too blunt. However, what I\u2019m trying to say is that I\u2019m a very blunt person by nature. There\u2019s no helping it.\u201d Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>One of the reporters whispered, \u201cMaster Lin, we know that you are a person of justice. If you feel that the words you said previously aren\u2019t appropriate, we can delete it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved his hand, \u201cThere\u2019s no need. Just broadcast it like that. There\u2019s nothing I said that I regret. In this world, can\u2019t someone comment on someone doing wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporters were contented. They were feeling very happy that they had obtained another huge news.</p><br/><p>The reporters were satisfied and walked away.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan\u2019s smiled. He had to be this spiteful. If he were to be too modest, he might as well not have said anything.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian sighed. This fellow has once again spoken his mind. It seems that he\u2019s deliberately trying to come up with something.</p><br/><p>At the entrance of a hotel.</p><br/><p>Even though Zhao Li tried to conceal herself, she was still recognized by the reporters and was immediately surrounded by them. The flashes kept coming.</p><br/><p>\u201cZhao Li! Do you have anything to say about the dirty dealings from two years ago?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYing Jin received 5 million dollars. How much did you get?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDid the other two judges get any money?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAs a senior in the music industry, why did you have to get involved in such dirty dealings?\u201d</p><br/><p>Facing the reporter\u2019s non-stop questioning, Zhao Li only looked down. She didn\u2019t say a single thing. She finally managed to escape the place through the protection of her bodyguards.</p><br/><p>Right now, she even had thoughts of dying.</p><br/><p>That b*stard was all to blame. If it weren\u2019t for that b*stard, none of these would have resurfaced.</p><br/><p>She was done for. This time, she was completely done for.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Ying Jin knew that escaping wouldn\u2019t solve anything. Therefore, she immediately requested for a conference with the reporters.</p><br/><p>In the conference room of the hotel room.</p><br/><p>It was very quickly filled with reporters.</p><br/><p>Ying Jin, however, was seated in front, not saying a single word. She was protected by many bodyguards.</p><br/><p>The reporters started asking their questions. They were all questions about the dirty dealings.</p><br/><p>Everyone knew that this issue affected Ying Jin greatly.</p><br/><p>Even though she was a senior in the music industry, which variety show would dare to invite her to be a mentor now that she had such ugly news?</p><br/><p>Ying Jin looked at the reporters. She didn\u2019t know if she\u2019d be successful in clearing her name. But no matter what, she still had to try.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Ying Jin opened her mouth. But at that instant, she started to cry instead.</p><br/><p>\u201cAt this point in time, I just want to say that I\u2019m sorry to whoever that loved me. I\u2019ve disappointed you all.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe dirty dealings from two years ago are all true. Right now, I can\u2019t regret it enough.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can only blame myself for being too young and foolish. I just couldn\u2019t resist.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ying Jin was crying very badly. Her eyes became hazy from the tears. She looked very pitiful.</p><br/><p>Pfft.</p><br/><p>The reporters who had the guts immediately flamed her the moment they heard this.</p><br/><p>Too young at that time?</p><br/><p>Too foolish?</p><br/><p>Can you at least show some f*cking face?</p><br/><p>You\u2019re already approaching fifty-years-old, and you can still say that you were too young?</p><br/><p>\u2026</p></div>\n</div>"}

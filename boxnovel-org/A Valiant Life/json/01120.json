There was an indescribable displeasure that he was feeling. He felt as if he had been scorned.</p><br/><p>He was a big celebrity. But now, his spotlight had completely been snatched away.</p><br/><p>When he looked at the ten over excited fans, he had an urge to beat them up.</p><br/><p>At that moment, the person-in-charge of the airport order saw the situation and yelled, \u201cWhat are you all doing? Didn\u2019t I tell you to maintain the order? What are you standing there for?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDirector, that\u2019s Han Jun but there are only a few people receiving him. We don\u2019t even know what to do,\u201d a security guard said helplessly.</p><br/><p>Initially, they had already prepared themselves to get scratched and pushed by those maniacal fans. But now, they didn\u2019t even have to do anything.</p><br/><p>The director was startled. Without caring about who the celebrity was, he pointed into the distance and shouted, \u201cCan\u2019t you see that there are so many people there? Hurry up and get over there now!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, yes.\u201d When the security guards heard that, they quickly went over to help.</p><br/><p>As the director looked at the situation, he said, \u201cWho was the one who called me just now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Han Jun\u2019s manager stood out. \u201cI called you.\u201d</p><br/><p>The director looked at her and said in an unpleasant tone, \u201cI hope you\u2019ll be clearer of the situation in the future. Our airport security is very busy. Our manpower is limited. Please don\u2019t take us as a joke. Making such a big deal over a few fans. Sigh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He shook his head and didn\u2019t want to say more. Then, he just left.</p><br/><p>Hearing those words, Han Jun\u2019s breathing became difficult. He felt as if he had been slapped on both sides of his face.</p><br/><p>When Scholar Ma and the rest came out from the airport, they were stunned by the noise.</p><br/><p>He stood rooted to the ground motionlessly. It was as if he didn\u2019t understand what was going on. Then, he looked at the two security guards next to him as if to ask them what was going on.</p><br/><p>The man with the surname Cui went forward. \u201cScholar Ma, welcome back.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLil\u2019 Cui, what\u2019s this?\u201d Scholar Ma looked at the situation in confusion. He was at a loss.</p><br/><p>After researching for his whole life, he had never received such a welcome before.</p><br/><p>\u201cScholar Ma, this is Master Lin.\u201d Lil\u2019 Cui was a little dazed as well. He hadn\u2019t expected such a situation either.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Scholar Ma was even more popular than a superstar.</p><br/><p>But he felt that this was really pretty good.</p><br/><p>Scholar Ma was already old. He was past seventy and soon to be eighty. He had never had such a grand welcoming in his life. He had always been very low-key.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan approached Scholar Ma and extended his hand. Then, he smiled. \u201cHello, Scholar Ma.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, youngster, I remember you.\u201d Scholar Ma looked at Lin Fan closely, then recalled. \u201cI\u2019ve seen your drawing in the museum before. It was brilliantly drawn. I still remember it even now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha,\u201d Lin Fan laughed. \u201cThank you for the praise but it\u2019s nothing much.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t be too humble. There\u2019s no way our museum would display anything bad. If it can be displayed in the museum, it has been acknowledged,\u201d said Scholar Ma with a laugh. He felt that he didn\u2019t deserve so many people coming to receive him.</p><br/><p>But as for such a cultured young man like Lin Fan, he liked him very much.</p><br/><p>Then, Lin Fan looked at the time. <em>Oh no. It\u2019s getting late. I have to hurry off.</em></p><br/><p><em>But there are still so many people here. If I don\u2019t interact with them a little, wouldn\u2019t it upset them? </em>Then, he shouted, \u201cEveryone, I\u2019m rushing for a flight. Let\u2019s take a group photo together. When you have the time, you can go to my Weibo to download it and see where I am. Is that alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright. We can finally take a group photo with Master Lin!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is fantastic!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan passed his phone to a security guard, then stood in front of the group of them. \u201cThose who are in front, let\u2019s squat down so that those behind won\u2019t be blocked.\u201d</p><br/><p>When the townsfolk heard this, they didn\u2019t hesitate before doing as he said.</p><br/><p>\u201cSay cheese.\u201d</p><br/><p>*Kacha*</p><br/><p>After taking the photo, the security guard passed the phone back to Master Lin.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, the reporters behind clamored, \u201cExcuse us! Let us go in to interview Master Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>These reporters were Beijing reporters. Usually, they wouldn\u2019t be able to go to Shanghai to interview Master Lin. Whenever something happened, it would be the Shanghai reporters who would report it.</p><br/><p>Now that Master Lin had come to the Beijing airport, naturally, they wanted to interview him. However, there were way too many people here and they couldn\u2019t get close at all.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the time. It was almost time to board. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, my reporter comrades. It\u2019s almost time to board. Next time, I\u2019ll come to Beijing again when I have the chance and I\u2019ll inform you all again.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd thank you, everyone. I\u2019m going to go now. I\u2019ll upload the photo to my Weibo later. Follow my Weibo and download it.\u201d</p><br/><p>After saying that, Lin Fan hurried to get his ticket checked. If he were to be late, he wouldn\u2019t be able to leave.</p><br/><p>\u201cHave a safe trip, Master Lin!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCome to Beijing to play when you have the chance. We will always welcome you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, if it wasn\u2019t for Master Lin today, I really wouldn\u2019t know that Scholar Ma exists. These people are much more amazing than those celebrities.\u201d</p><br/><p>Very soon, Lin Fan\u2019s back view disappeared.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, these people didn\u2019t leave immediately. Instead, they started chatting amongst themselves. One of them shouted, \u201cEveryone, would you like to create a WeChat group to chat in the future?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter this incident, I feel like we should pay more attention to some things. This Scholar Ma is an old scientist but look. There was no one here to welcome him. How sad is that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. I feel that that\u2019s a good idea. Although we don\u2019t have to be here for every person\u2019s flight, we can buy some flowers or something when we have the time to come and welcome some people home.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMmm. That\u2019s a very good idea. But we don\u2019t even know when there will be people coming.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, a reporter shouted. \u201cAdd me into the group. I follow such events. When there are people coming, I will notify you all.\u201d</p><br/><p>When the crowd heard this, they instantly smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great. Alright. Everyone, let\u2019s create a group now. I\u2019ll add you all in. Come and scan my QR code.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, a group of them gathered together as they scanned each other\u2019s QR codes.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Han Jun and his manager, together with their twenty security guards, had left dejectedly long ago.</p><br/><p>To Han Jun, this time, he had really been embarrassed big time. As for tomorrow\u2019s news, he wouldn\u2019t dare to read it.</p><br/><p>Nighttime.</p><br/><p>Shanghai airport.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan let out a deep breath, then breathed in the air. Finally, he had returned. Then, his phone rang.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang: \u201cAre you back yet?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m back, I\u2019m back. I\u2019m at the airport now. I\u2019ll drive over. What\u2019s the hurry?\u201d said Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>\u201cHurry up. I\u2019m just waiting for you. Tonight, we won\u2019t go home until we\u2019re drunk,\u201d said Wang Ming Yang with a laugh.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m coming. Don\u2019t rush me.\u201d Lin Fan went to get his car. Regarding what had happened at the Beijing airport, he felt that it was quite meaningful. Casually doing something like that actually felt pretty good.</p><br/><p><em>But I didn\u2019t offend that celebrity, did I? He didn\u2019t come and engage in a conflict with me after all.</em></p></div>\n</div>"}

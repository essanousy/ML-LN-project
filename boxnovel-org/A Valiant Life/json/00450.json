It might have been Elder Zheng\u2019s happiest day of his life. He finally could see that his grandson was exactly the same as any other child and the only regret in his life had vanished.</p><br/><p>Director Jiang left discreetly. He could tell that Elder Zheng and the others had no idea what really happened to him.</p><br/><p>Perhaps only Lil\u2019 Bao knew what happened or who he met.</p><br/><p>Director Jiang was extremely shocked by what had happened.</p><br/><p>They knew about Lil\u2019 Bao and they knew that it was extremely difficult to treat it. It was almost a 0% success rate. However, they couldn\u2019t figure out how he managed to recover so quickly.</p><br/><p>Zheng Hai Feng asked, \u201cDad, what did Director Jiang mean just now? Could he have hired an old Chinese medical doctor to treat Lil\u2019 Bao?\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Zheng shook his head, \u201cThat\u2019s impossible. I have asked that old Chinese medical doctor to look at Lil\u2019 Bao before and the outcome was the same. He couldn\u2019t treat it. If there was really someone that could treat him, why did they wait till now before treating Lil\u2019 Bao?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDad, then what\u2019s going on? Look, we all know about Lil\u2019 Bao\u2019s condition and it\u2019s impossible for it to recover so suddenly,\u201d Nian Hui Ci finally said what she was thinking about.</p><br/><p>That was what she was thinking about but even her dad didn\u2019t know what happened. Who else would have known about it?</p><br/><p>They were usually busy and therefore their parents were there to take care of their child. However, their parents actually had no idea what happened to Lil\u2019 Bao even though he had recovered. How was that possible?</p><br/><p>The place where their dad lived couldn\u2019t have allowed anyone without a pass to enter.</p><br/><p>Therefore, a stranger would definitely not be able to touch Lil\u2019 Bao.</p><br/><p>Then, Lil\u2019 Wang said, \u201cElder Zheng, I have something to say.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, what is it, Lil\u2019 Wang?\u201d Elder Zheng was extremely happy.</p><br/><p>Lil\u2019 Wang thought about it for a moment. Then, he said, \u201cI think Master Lin helped to cure Lil\u2019 Bao.\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Elder Zheng was stunned. Then, he looked at Lil\u2019 Wang, \u201cWhat proof do you have?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Zheng, I followed Master Lin out before lunchtime, do you remember that? Then, Master Lin asked me where was the nearest Chinese medical hall and I brought him there. Then, Master Lin came out after a while. However, I realized that Master Lin didn\u2019t buy anything and therefore I didn\u2019t think too much about it,\u201d Lil\u2019 Wang told him whatever he knew.</p><br/><p>\u201cDad, who is Master Lin?\u201d Zheng Hai Feng asked.</p><br/><p>Elder Zheng said, \u201cMaster Lin is a member of our association. Although he is a young chap, he is extremely good at drawing. Today afternoon, he had lunch with all of us.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat does he have to do with Lil\u2019 Bao?\u201d Zheng Hai Feng asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2026\u201d Elder Zheng was stunned. What did Elder Lin have to do with Lil\u2019 Bao? Could it be that he really treated him completely?</p><br/><p>It was unusual, really unusual.</p><br/><p>\u201cLil\u2019 Wang, send us to the Chinese medical hall which you brought Master Lin to. Let\u2019s go ask some questions.\u201d Elder Zheng felt that there was a need to find out about it. If it was true, then their family would\u2019ve owed Master Lin a big favor.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>At a random Chinese medical hall.</p><br/><p>Lil\u2019 Wang came out from the shop and hurriedly went into the car. Lil\u2019 Wang nodded, \u201cElder Zheng, I just asked the person and he said that Master Lin bought a few boxes of acupuncture needles.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiu Fang said, \u201cHusband, do you really think it\u2019s true?\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Zheng hesitated for a moment and sighed, \u201cLooks like I really belittled Elder Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDad, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d Zheng Hai Feng asked.</p><br/><p>Elder Zheng said, \u201cI told you. That time, Elder Lin looked like he was concerned about Lil\u2019 Bao\u2019s legs and he even touched them. Then, he said he needed to buy something. I think he really treated him but he didn\u2019t tell us about it. If not for Lil\u2019 Wang being so attentive, perhaps we wouldn\u2019t even find out about this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lil\u2019 Wang said, \u201cElder Zheng, I think it\u2019s really done by Master Lin. The doctor said that Lil\u2019 Bao\u2019s legs have marks which were done by acupuncture needles and Master Lin bought acupuncture needles. It\u2019s obvious that Master Lin did it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe truth is finally out. I understand it now. I\u2019ll give him a call,\u201d Elder Zheng said. Then, he took out his phone and called Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>On the phone.</p><br/><p>Elder Zheng asked, \u201cElder Lin, where are you now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m at the airport. I\u2019m preparing to return home.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, I thought you\u2019re returning home tomorrow? Why are you rushing back today?\u201d Elder Zheng laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cSomething happened and I have to go back earlier,\u201d Lin Fan said. He felt that Elder Zheng had found out about something but he tried to pretend like he didn\u2019t know anything.</p><br/><p>Elder Zheng said, \u201cAlright, Elder Lin, we found out about what you did to Lil\u2019 Bao. Now, Lil\u2019 Bao said that his legs are hurting him. You dare to say you don\u2019t know anything about this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh? How could that be? That\u2019s impossible.\u201d Lin Fan was stunned when he heard it. Then, he reacted, \u201cElder Zheng, you must be kidding me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha\u2026\u201d Elder Zheng laughed. \u201cElder Lin, don\u2019t return yet. We know about this now. I am so thankful for you. We have to thank you personally. Why didn\u2019t you tell us about it? You didn\u2019t have to be so sneaky about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, Elder Zheng. This is nothing much. I\u2019ll just quote what you said. You told me that I was part of your association and your matters are mine. It\u2019s really not a big deal. Please watch after Lil\u2019 Bao and let him exercise frequently. His legs haven\u2019t moved for a long time and it would be difficult to get used to. However, it would get better with time. Remember, bring Lil\u2019 Bao to swim more often. Running would affect his joints\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>When Elder Zheng heard that Elder Lin was being so concerned, he said, \u201cElder Lin, you don\u2019t have to say anymore. I know your personality. Lil\u2019 Bao is my one and only grandson. You are his savior. If you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019ll let Lil\u2019 Bao be your godson. Please accept it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was stunned. Then, he smiled, \u201cElder Zheng, you must be kidding. Don\u2019t take this to heart. It\u2019s just a small matter. I\u2019m going to board the plane and I\u2019ll hang up now. You can come to Shanghai when you\u2019re free.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, the phone\u2019s signal got affected.</p><br/><p>Elder Zheng had a lot of things to tell Lin Fan but he didn\u2019t give him any opportunities to do so.</p><br/><p>\u201cDad, that\u2026\u201d Zheng Hai Feng heard their conversation but he didn\u2019t know what to say. He was extremely grateful for Master Lin and wanted to thank him personally.</p><br/><p>Elder Zheng sighed, \u201cElder Lin is extraordinary. Don\u2019t tell anyone about this. I have to prepare to go to Shanghai soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDad, what are you trying to do?\u201d Zheng Hai Feng asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat am I trying to do? I\u2019m obviously going to look for Elder Lin. This matter is really not simple. He gave Lil\u2019 Bao a new life. How could we forget about this? We have to thank him personally.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

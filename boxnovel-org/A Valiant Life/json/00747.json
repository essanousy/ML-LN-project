He looked very sinister and was probably the leader of the others.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you Lin Fan?\u201d The man asked.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cYes I am. Who are you guys?\u201d</p><br/><p>The man said, \u201cWho we are is not important. What\u2019s important is that you have to remember not to mess with what\u2019s irrelevant to you. Do you understand?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shook his head, \u201cI don\u2019t quite understand?\u201d</p><br/><p>The man gave Lin Fan a cold glare, \u201cYou really don\u2019t know what\u2019s good for you, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan also wanted to mess with the other party. He impatiently said, \u201cBrother, you have to make more sense of the things you\u2019re saying. I have provoked many people. How would I know who I shouldn\u2019t mess with? What you\u2019re saying really doesn\u2019t make any sense, and it\u2019s putting me in a spot.</p><br/><p>At this point, the man couldn\u2019t wait to give this guy a beating.</p><br/><p>However, his orders were not to touch him, but only to threaten him and let him know not to speak nonsense.</p><br/><p>This situation was very simple, and they have done it many times before.</p><br/><p>In the past, everyone would be scared out of their wits the moment they appeared, and their faces would turn pale immediately. They would immediately kneel down and beg for forgiveness.</p><br/><p>At this moment, the man gave a deathly stare and he gave a very fierce look \u201cLet me tell you once more. You better be serious, or else I\u2019d break your hand.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cI am being serious. The main point here is you giving me a f*cking name, if not, how would I know who you are talking about?\u201d</p><br/><p>The small boys standing behind this man were flabbergasted.</p><br/><p>They never expected that someone could be so aggressive and could still maintain his cool in front of so many people. Something isn\u2019t quite right here.</p><br/><p>The man grabbed Lin Fan by the collar, and fiercely said, \u201cDo you want to f*cking die? Let me tell you, use your brain when you say things in future. There are some people that you just can\u2019t mess with. If you still dare to spout nonsense, I can guarantee you, you\u2019d die so horribly you wouldn\u2019t even know how you died.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you being so crude? Let me guess, you guys were sent by Ying Jin?\u201d Lin Fan asked.</p><br/><p>The man\u2019s expression changed slightly. He didn\u2019t give an answer, nor did he deny it.</p><br/><p>They came all the way from the Northeast just to warn him.</p><br/><p>At the same time, their orders were not to touch him.</p><br/><p>No matter what is said, Lin Fan is still a public figure. If he were to be taught a lesson here, they would be able to connect the dots without even thinking too much about it.</p><br/><p>However, threatening is a different story. In this society, who isn\u2019t scared of trouble. Especially for public figures, they\u2019re extremely afraid of being held by these people.</p><br/><p>So, in normal situations, a slight treat would have a great result.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t ask too much. Let me remind you, be careful what you say in future.\u201d The man angrily rebuked. He had a ferocious expression which could really scare people.</p><br/><p>Just at this moment, Lin Fan took out his phone.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d The man asked.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied calmly, \u201cYou\u2019re threatening me. I have to make a police report.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you f*cking trying to die?\u201d The man couldn\u2019t take it anymore. He raised his fist, getting ready to punch him in the face.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed. It was as if he didn\u2019t even put this man into his eyes. \u201cI think it is you guys that are looking for death.\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, Lin Fan took a stride, and with a shoulder throw, he threw the man onto the ground.</p><br/><p>The surrounding people were astonished when they saw this. After which, they cursed in rage and rushed towards Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>With a sweeping glance, he realized that these people actually had weapons with them!</p><br/><p>However, that didn\u2019t matter. To Lin Fan, these people were just like dirt.</p><br/><p>Facing these people, he naturally didn\u2019t need the knowledge of wuxia. With one Ba Gua Zhang, he KO\u2019ed these people.</p><br/><p>There were momentarily many screams of agony.</p><br/><p>These ten over burly men were all beaten down by him.</p><br/><p>Their leader was the most shocked. He never expected that his fellow would be so strong. They had so many people on their side, but yet they couldn\u2019t do anything to him.</p><br/><p>How was this possible?</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you guys r*tarded? If you guys are attempting to find trouble with me, you have to at least do your research. As the Vice-president of the National Martial Arts Association, you guys are just stupidly coming here to die. Let me ask you all, how foolish is that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shook his head and sighed. He didn\u2019t waste his breathe anymore and immediately called the hotline.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello? Inspector Liu? I\u2019ve been attacked at the carpark below my house. The other party has over ten men and they even had weapons hidden on them. One look and I could tell they were bad people. Hurry up and come!\u201d</p><br/><p>They didn\u2019t expect that this guy would actually make a police report. Some of them wanted to get up and run. However, Lin Fan would obviously not let them escape. He immediately knocked them down again.</p><br/><p>Just making that call wasn\u2019t enough. He made another call.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs this Shanghai Entertainment News? I\u2019m Master Lin. I\u2019ve been attacked by several offenders at the carpark below my house. Please come over and take a look!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStar Daily News, I am\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPeople\u2019s Daily News!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEntertainment Weekly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan continuously made ten over calls to news agencies. He had to blow this matter up.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t his style to hand over situations to the police. He knew that these people were sent by Ying Jin, and so he had to return the favour, or else she\u2019d think that he was he fool.</p><br/><p>As expected, before long.</p><br/><p>The people who arrived first were the reporters.</p><br/><p>When they saw the situation at hand, they were stunned. Thereafter, they immediately started clicking their cameras away.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, what happened here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, where are these people from? Why would they want to attack you?\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporters were excited. They felt that there was a huge news unfolding here.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan had an innocent expression, \u201cI\u2019m not too sure why. I had just come back from the venue of \u2018Strongest Heavenly Voice\u2019 when I was surrounded by these people. They asked me to be more honest and not spout nonsense. At that moment, I was already trying to figure out what was happening here.\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporters said, \u201cMaster Lin, may I ask who may you have offended recently?\u201d</p><br/><p>This reporter\u2019s question was very obscure. He didn\u2019t mention Ying Jin, but rather, he wanted Lin Fan to answer it himself. At the same time, it gave Lin Fan an opportunity to brag.</p><br/><p>With regards to this particular reporter, Lin Fan gave him a silent appraisal.</p><br/><p>Well done.</p><br/><p>I didn\u2019t waste my effort being nice to you guys.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said gloomily, \u201cI, Lin Fan, has never sought to be enemies with anyone in my life. I have always been reasonable, just, kind-hearted and gratifying. Therefore, I have never offended anyone. However, recently, one of my students was involved in some dirty secrets. I took the initiative to pursue the truth, and in the process, I am afraid that I may have offended someone.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I really must, I would guess that I have offended Ying Jin.\u201d</p><br/><p>As expected, when he said this, the reporters got even more excited. They directed the camera towards the burly men and asked, \u201cWere you guys sent by Ying Jin to take revenge on Master Lin?\u201d</p><br/><p>The man said, \u201cNo, no!\u201d</p><br/><p>They had a very strong northwestern accent.</p><br/><p>The reporters were shocked, \u201cDid you guys hear that? These people seem to be from the northwest! Isn\u2019t Ying Jin from there?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. Looking at this, it seems about right.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat makes sense.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled while looking at this. Everything was going according to his plan.</p><br/><p>It feels great.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t know what would happen in the news the next day.</p><br/><p>At the same time, he was secretly thinking.</p><br/><p>Ying Jin, if this Master doesn\u2019t break you down, I would have lived for nothing.</p><br/><p>The men who came to threaten Lin Fan were all flabbergasted.</p><br/><p>They didn\u2019t think that this person would be so treacherous. Not only did he call the police over, he also took the initiative to call the reporters over.</p><br/><p>He had obviously thought of this plan beforehand.</p></div>\n</div>"}

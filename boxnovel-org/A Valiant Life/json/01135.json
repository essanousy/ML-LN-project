He had taken a close look at the child previously and thought that the child was beyond hope.</p><br/><p>However, he knew that this kid\u2019s ability was great and his medical ability was superb. Perhaps a miracle could really happen.</p><br/><p>But even for a miracle, this was way too quick. It had been half an hour at most and it was already done. That was really scary.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow long do you want me to take then?\u201d Lin Fan asked jokingly. Actually, half an hour was already a very long time to him.</p><br/><p>With the full force of the Wuxia class of knowledge, he had maintained the Encyclopedia\u2019s mystical boost for the whole half an hour. This was something that had never been done before.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, is my child really fine?\u201d Wang Da Fu grasped Lin Fan\u2019s hands. His expression was one of excitement and also a bit of disbelief. Then, he looked at his son who was lying inside and immediately went over. When he saw his son gazing at him with wide eyes, his tears started flowing.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan let out a deep breath. <em>This was really tiring. I haven\u2019t felt like this in a long while.</em></p><br/><p>\u201cIncredible.\u201d Fraud Tian couldn\u2019t help but admire Lin Fan. To be able to save a child that had been in that state, he had to admit that Lin Fan was beyond incredible.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled. \u201cJust keep it to yourself. No need to tell me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fortunately, this incident would not be spread. Moreover, other people wouldn\u2019t know the state that the child had been in. If they knew, things would probably get out of hand.</p><br/><p>That was not what Lin Fan wanted.</p><br/><p>Wang Da Fu was filled with gratitude and he was moved to tears.</p><br/><p>He really didn\u2019t know how to thank Lin Fan. He wanted to kneel down but Lin Fan pulled him up.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is for you. Buy some tickets for the trip home. Everything is fine now.\u201d Lin Fan took out ten red notes from the drawer. This was the money he had earned from two days of selling scallion pancakes.</p><br/><p>How could Wang Da Fu accept the money? His child was already fine and that was the most important thing to him. Moreover, he was unable to repay Lin Fan for his kindness.</p><br/><p>\u201cTake it. The child has just recovered and he mustn\u2019t be fatigued. It\u2019ll be better if you take a train ride home.\u201d Lin Fan thrust the money into Wang Da Fu\u2019s hands. Then, Lin Fan waved. \u201cGo home early. We won\u2019t be holding you back for lunch.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you, Master Lin. Thank you, Master Lin\u2026\u201d Wang Da Fu\u2019s eyes reddened as he held the money in his hands. He hadn\u2019t expected there to be such good people in Shanghai.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved his hand and smiled. \u201cHave a safe trip home.\u201d</p><br/><p>After sending Wang Da Fu off, Lin Fan sat on the chair. \u201cYou Lan, give me a massage. I\u2019m a little tired.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Wu You Lan hurried over and started massaging Lin Fan\u2019s shoulders.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian glanced over. \u201cKid, you\u2019re really too generous. You treated his son\u2019s illness and still gave him money. If more people come in the future, would you be able to handle them?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t I? Money that I earned should be spent however I like. I have hands and legs, why wouldn\u2019t I be able to earn more money? But you\u2019re pretty good, Fraud. You brought him to take a bath and even gave him a set of clothes to change into. How much did you spend? I\u2019ll reimburse you,\u201d said Lin Fan with a smile.</p><br/><p>Just as Fraud Tian wanted to say a number, Zhao Zhong Yang quickly interrupted, \u201cHe didn\u2019t spend a single cent. It was all free.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy do you have so much to say? Would it kill you not to speak?\u201d Fraud Tian glared at Zhao Zhong Yang. He hadn\u2019t expected this kid to expose him.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan instantly started laughing. Then, he took out his phone and looked for news on the Internet related to prosthetic limbs. He found a few articles and some statistics and posted them on Weibo.</p><br/><p>\u201cSoon, I\u2019ll be developing the most perfect prosthetic limbs. Please look forward to it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Initially, he hadn\u2019t wanted to post this so soon. However, he wanted to show off a little.</p><br/><p>When this post was sent, the netizens saw it and were dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn. Master Lin has lost his mind again. Why can\u2019t I understand what he posted?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t even understand this? This means that Master Lin is getting involved in research and he\u2019s developing the perfect prosthetic limbs. I want to ask a question. What are these perfect prosthetic limbs?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have no idea. Can someone explain?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is pure sensationalism. He\u2019s just showing off without any substantiation. He should just stick to running his shop.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt might not just be sensationalism. I feel that Master Lin is a very mystical person.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe. It\u2019s useless even if he is mystical. This is out of his field. Do you think that he could succeed alone? Do you think everyone else is stupid?\u201d</p><br/><p>Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang saw Brother Lin\u2019s Weibo and asked curiously, \u201cBrother Lin, what did you just post on Weibo?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was enjoying You Lan\u2019s massage. He squinted his eyes and said, \u201cIt\u2019s nothing much. Just perfect prosthetic limbs. I have to help the welfare institute\u2019s children recover their normal bodies.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have knowledge in that field?\u201d Zhao Zhong Yang asked in astonishment. He realized that Brother Lin would always do many kinds of things and he would always leave everyone dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d Lin Fan shook his head.</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang was taken aback. \u201cThen why did you say you were going to develop it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cDoes not having knowledge mean that I can\u2019t develop it? There\u2019s no such rule, is there?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck\u2026\u201d Zhao Zhong Yang had been completely defeated by Brother Lin\u2019s words. However, he had blind faith in Brother Lin. Regardless of whether or not Brother Lin knew about those things, Zhao Zhong Yang felt that as long as Brother Lin wanted to do it, he would succeed.</p><br/><p>If Lin Fan said he was going to develop it, he would definitely develop it.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Lin Fan continued looking at Weibo.</p><br/><p>He had only just sent the post but the Internet was already making a ruckus.</p><br/><p>There was a big Internet celebrity who also specialized in researching this field. He had tagged Lin Fan and blurted out a huge amount of information which left Lin Fan dazed. Lin Fan had no idea what that person was talking about.</p><br/><p>\u201c@MasterLin, do you know all this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Out of politeness, Lin Fan replied: \u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d</p><br/><p>When this reply was sent, the people on Weibo started laughing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, this isn\u2019t as simple as you think. Some things seem perfect when you think about it but they are extremely difficult when you bring them into reality. I\u2019m not trying to attack you but, in this field, even if you start studying from the beginning, you wouldn\u2019t understand the theory behind it without at least a few years of study. Moreover, the society is still progressing. Prosthetic limbs have developed to a certain extent as well. That\u2019s why there is no such thing as \u2018perfect prosthetic limbs\u2019 as you mentioned.\u201d</p><br/><p>Some people were clamoring.</p><br/><p>\u201cLin, stop pretending you know things that you don\u2019t know. Do you find it meaningful to treat this as a joke?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. Do you think you\u2019re a genius? How can you dare to say the word \u2018perfect\u2019?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin has nothing better to do and he can only find such topics to draw attention to himself.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSigh. This is really tragic.\u201d</p><br/><p>However, at that moment, the Flame War Emperor, Chief of the Internet trolls, who had been away for a period of time, emerged.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck your mothers. What do you retards even know? This is self-confidence.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCome. Today, the Chief of the Internet trolls will go to war with you. If I don\u2019t flame you all to death, I won\u2019t call myself the Chief anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan saw this situation and furrowed his brows. He felt that this Chief of Internet trolls that he had hired had fallen in terms of battle power. He had actually used such weak and powerless words to attack the opposition. It seemed to Lin Fan that he had to give him a reminder. Then, Lin Fan sent a message over.</p><br/><p>\u201cPut some heart into it. If you clean this up well, I\u2019ll reward you with 500 dollars.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGot it, Boss.\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

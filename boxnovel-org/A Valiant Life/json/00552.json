Although the apology ended things, the video was still circulating online.</p><br/><p>But if he didn\u2019t apologize and the other party really decided to bring the case to court, things would have become even more complicated.</p><br/><p>If it ever reached that point, something big would happen.</p><br/><p>\u201cProfessor Yang, does this case end here?\u201d someone asked him. Professor Yang felt indignant. So many Senior Professors came together and they couldn\u2019t beat one young person. What a joke!</p><br/><p>\u201cEnd?\u201d Professor Yang shook his head in pained laughter. \u201cNo, things aren\u2019t over yet. We still have to wait for the public opinion to die down and wait for the investigation to be over. If we don\u2019t handle this well, our reputations can still go down the drain.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAs for who, this\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Professor Yang hadn\u2019t finished speaking, but everyone was already panic-stricken. This case was really serious. If this case had not gone onto the Internet, it wouldn\u2019t have been that bad, but now, it was too late.</p><br/><p>The person who was speaking in the video was Professor Yang. If the group of senior professors got investigated, the person who would be reprimanded most would be him, and the rest would probably receive less attention.</p><br/><p>Ministry of Education.</p><br/><p>The Minister of Education was doing his own things in his office, but at that moment, someone walked into the office. He wanted to say something, but after seeing who it was, he remained speechless.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease take a walk with us.\u201d</p><br/><p>He never thought that as the Minster, he would be the one invited for tea.</p><br/><p>On the Internet.</p><br/><p>The netizens were all for Lin Fan, especially the loyal fans of Lin Fan- they were overjoyed.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, all these old farts finally know their place.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI just got the news that the Minister of Education just got invited for a \u2018tea session\u2019.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn, this is some shocking news. Lin Fan really did this well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow come the other Senior Professors aren\u2019t getting investigated yet?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t hurry, developments take time, and these Senior Professors probably have been plotting for a very long time.\u201d</p><br/><p>With this case being released, a few other people who had been defrauded by the senior professors also came up and spoke out.</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to make a report. I wrote a series of books before and they also did the same thing to me.</p><br/><p>The cases came one after another. Before Lin Fan, no one dared to speak up and no one dared to stand up for themselves.</p><br/><p>One wave after another.</p><br/><p>Without relenting.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan couldn\u2019t care more about this issue anymore, what consequences and whatever impact- he didn\u2019t bother with it anymore. All he knew was that they were in a lot of trouble.</p><br/><p>Nanshan Children\u2019s Welfare Institute.</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan had arrived, he realized that there were quite a few strangers, and all of them were carrying things.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan saw Director Huang giving commands to the people around. \u201cDirector Huang, what is going on?\u201d Lin Fan went up, asking.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, the donations have come in and I invited a few people over to carry away some of the items here to make some extra space. After this, I\u2019ll call a renovations company and ask them to partition a room to make it a classroom. It\u2019s going to be a lot of work but it\u2019s for the education of the kids.\u201d Director Huang said, smiling.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded his head, realizing that that was a pretty good idea. \u201cHow much was the donation?\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Huang took out his booklet. \u201cThere was quite an excess of donations, over ten million dollars. Master Lin, how do you think we should handle this money?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan knew that the donation drive would get quite a lot of money, but he absolutely would not store the cash secretly or use it for himself, since it was donations from all the netizens, he did not have any right to keep it. \u201cDirector Huang. You have quite a bit of excess. You should use what you need and donate away the rest to other Welfare Institutes. The only condition is that the money has to be used transparently. It just requires a bit more work, but you should announce on the website how you used the money so that the donators know where their money went to.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, that is wise. Our Children\u2019s Welfare Institute cannot thank you enough,\u201d Director Huang said, her face full of smiles.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled, waving him away. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to thank me. Since I\u2019ve already taken over the Children\u2019s Welfare Institute, my responsibility is towards the children. Furthermore, we cannot keep on relying on the donations of other people to keep us running. We have to make sure that the children get to work and create their own wealth.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe children are still quite small. How are they to earn money?\u201d Director Huang said, looking puzzled.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t they know how to draw? They have quite a talent, so all I have to do is to mentor them well and next time, they can draw anything. Although the paintings don\u2019t sell for much, it is still enough to feed themselves. Independence needs to be taught from young, and at the same time, you can teach them a new passion. This is like killing two birds with one stone.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan\u2019s goal was rather big, and the only way to it was to mentor teach the children properly. It would be even greater if the children really turned out amazing in the future.</p><br/><p>Director Huang didn\u2019t think as deep as Lin Fan. Looking at his plans, she thought that it was reasonable. Teaching the kids independence was an absolutely great idea.</p><br/><p>This was a Children\u2019s Welfare Institute and the children had to fend for themselves in the future. Inculcating in them independence was of utmost importance.</p><br/><p>But if she really knew what Lin Fan was thinking, her heart would not have been able to handle it.</p><br/><p>In actual fact, Lin Fan had something else in mind \u2013 to fight for justice. Those kids were abandoned by their parents Lin Fan planned on teaching the kids well so that everyone knew that they were something else.</p><br/><p>If he didn\u2019t have the encyclopedia, he definitely wouldn\u2019t have had the confidence to do it. With the encyclopedia\u2019s help, was this even a problem?</p><br/><p>All he needed was some time.</p><br/><p>The kids were doing nothing much every day, except drawing.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan planned on coming every day to teach the kids on how to do Chinese Art. Under the tutelage of Master Lin, the kids would become more passionate about Chinese Art.</p><br/><p>But of course, the kids had to have some kind of talent in the first place.</p><br/><p>Take for instance Lil\u2019 Fatty. Although he was naughtier than the rest, his talents were extraordinary. Compared to the other children, his art abilities were better.</p><br/><p>If he continued down this path and put in a lot of hard work, he would definitely become a renowned Chinese Art Master.</p><br/><p>But would becoming just a Master of Chinese Art be satisfactory to him?</p><br/><p>Surely not.</p><br/><p>In all the different activities that the children would go for, the Children would learn many other things, and that was Lin Fan\u2019s biggest dream.</p><br/><p>There were more guys in the group, which was also a representation of the population spread in the nation, where there were more guys than girls. He had to think of how to make sure that they would be able to find themselves a partner in the future.</p><br/><p>So, he also had to teach them how to cook, to make sure that they could cook up a really good meal.</p><br/><p>After all, cooking well was half the battle won.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Lin Fan realized that the responsibility was rather heavy, but this cause was something that was really meaningful.</p><br/><p>\u201cUncle Lin, what are you thinking about?\u201d Lil\u2019 Fan ran over, asking curiously.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan patted Lil\u2019 Fatty on the head, smiling at him. \u201cNothing much. How is your drawing coming a lot? Do you have any questions?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, whatever Uncle Lin has taught me, I know how to do all of them,\u201d Lil\u2019 Fatty said proudly.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan grinned. \u201cGo and teach the others, you guys have to help one another.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSure thing!\u201d Lil\u2019 Fatty nodded his head, before going up to one of the girls. \u201cCome, let me teach you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>All the other boys standing around were all glaring at Lil\u2019 Fatty.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p></div>\n</div>"}

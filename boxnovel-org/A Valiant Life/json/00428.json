However, he had done ample preparations such that a typical person wouldn\u2019t be able to tell. Only those that had a sharp eye for artworks and those influential figures would go to such art exhibitions. If they were to like a particular artwork, they could speak to the organizer to purchase it.</p><br/><p>Yue Qiu Ju Shi was an influential figure in the art industry. His flora and fauna artworks were extremely popular.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan didn\u2019t even ask Wang Ming Yang to come along when he left the hotel. He secretly left. He wondered why Wang Ming Yang wanted to follow him to Beijing even though he had nothing to do there.</p><br/><p>When he reached the lift, Lin Fan stopped. He thought that since he had come to Beijing with Wang Ming Yang and it would be bad to leave him alone.</p><br/><p>He hesitated for a moment and went back to Wang Ming Yang\u2019s room.</p><br/><p><em>Knock knock</em></p><br/><p>He knocked on the door and there was no response.</p><br/><p>The cleaner walked past and said, \u201cYoung chap, this guest left early in the morning.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan frowned and cursed in his heart. He had been prepared to bring Wang Ming Yang along but Wang Ming Yang had actually gone for it without him. That was outrageous. Then, he walked away without turning back.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t want to bring Wang Ming Yang along anymore.</p><br/><p>After a while, Wang Ming Yang returned happily with breakfast. Then, he came to knock on Lin Fan\u2019s door.</p><br/><p>There was no response.</p><br/><p>The cleaner happened to pass by and she said, \u201cYoung chap, this guest left a while ago.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang was stunned. He looked at the time and was unhappy. Outrageous. He didn\u2019t even wait for me. My efforts to buy him breakfast have been in vain. Wang Ming Yang wanted to look for Wu Yun Gang. He quickly went to his room to prepare himself.</p><br/><p>Beijing\u2019s Art Exhibition Centre.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan appeared at the entrance and gasped. Yue Qiu Ju Shi was extremely serious this time. The event was grand.</p><br/><p>There was still some time before the event started and he was taking his time.</p><br/><p>He opened Weibo.</p><br/><p>He was stunned when he saw Jin Xuan Ming\u2019s news. The Internet was filled with Jin Xuan Ming\u2019s news. They all talked about how he wanted to perform even though he was unwell. The way the author wrote the news was a little off-putting.</p><br/><p>\u2018It\u2019s for the fans. No matter what happened, it doesn\u2019t change a thing. It\u2019s just to meet the fans.\u2019</p><br/><p>To Lin Fan, this sentence seemed like him showing off. However, these hardcore fans would probably believe in him. The fans actually commented on the articles even before anything was finalized. It was ridiculous.</p><br/><p>\u201cXuan Ming oppa, we love you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo matter what happens, we\u2019re on your side.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe trials and challenges will not defeat our Xuan Ming oppa.\u201d</p><br/><p>When he saw these comments, Lin Fan didn\u2019t know what to say at all. His fingers tapped the screen for a moment and he hesitated. He was thinking if he should post his comment. After all, he didn\u2019t want to argue with the fans as he would never win against such stupid people. He\u2019d probably just be infuriated to death.</p><br/><p>However, he still posted it after thinking about what had happened.</p><br/><p>\u201cStupid fans, the world is a dangerous place.\u201d Lin Fan immediately kept his phone in his pocket after posting that.</p><br/><p>Jin Xuan Ming\u2019s fans didn\u2019t know what that meant but Lin Fan was their enemy and they didn\u2019t want to let go of any chance to roast him.</p><br/><p>It was about time.</p><br/><p>He entered the art exhibition.</p><br/><p>Anyone could enter this place but they had to be thoroughly checked for any contraband items before entry was permitted.</p><br/><p>Initially, there had been no need for these checks. However, one of the artworks was Yue Qiu Ju Shi\u2019s most precious one and he had to be cautious about it.</p><br/><p>Over there, there were a lot of art lovers. They looked at the artworks on the walls and nodded. Those that didn\u2019t appreciate art just looked at the artworks briefly but those that could appreciate it didn\u2019t just look at the different strokes. They also experienced the feelings that the artworks were trying to convey.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan didn\u2019t immediately look for Yue Qiu Ju Shi and the rest. He walked around and was listening to the whispers of those that were looking at the artworks.</p><br/><p>\u201cYue Qiu Ju Shi\u2019s \u2018Hundred flowers fighting to bloom\u2019 is a pretty good piece. It has exquisite strokes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis artwork is pretty good too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI saw a really exquisite piece just now, \u2018A hundred birds looking up to the phoenix\u2019, done by Master Lin. It\u2019s the best piece of artwork around here. You guys should have a look.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. I mean it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, Lin Fan interrupted, \u201cI saw that artwork too. It\u2019s unbelievable. Although this Master Lin isn\u2019t a famous artist, I believe this artwork could be the best of the century. It will definitely have a high value in the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally? I want to go and have a look.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled as he saw them walk towards it. He felt great bragging about his own work. No one knew that it was drawn by him.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin.\u201d Then, a familiar voice came.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan took a glance. \u201cMaster Yue Qiu and Master Tao.\u201d</p><br/><p>Master Yue Qiu smiled. \u201cMaster Lin, why didn\u2019t you tell us that you\u2019ve arrived?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved his hand. \u201cI\u2019m just looking around first.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCome, I\u2019ll let you meet some of my old friends. They really want to meet a grandmaster like you,\u201d Yue Qiu Ju Shi said as he smiled. He felt that he had met someone special this time.</p><br/><p>A lot of people saw the \u2018Hundred birds looking up to the phoenix\u2019 artwork and every single one of them thought of buying it. Furthermore, they felt extremely pressured. It was as if they felt that they couldn\u2019t leave without buying it.</p><br/><p>However, Yue Qiu Ju Shi wasn\u2019t going to sell it. He wanted this artwork to be a hereditary treasure and he had bought insurance for it already.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re too courteous.\u201d Lin Fan smiled. It was all about praising each other\u2019s works when art lovers met. However, it felt great. People of his age were hanging out with other youngsters but he was already conversing with the elderly about serious matters.</p><br/><p>Yue Qiu Ju Shi turned and looked extremely happy. Perhaps it was the most successful art exhibition he had ever organized.</p><br/><p>Those that had come to look at the artworks all stopped before Master Lin\u2019s artwork. They all gasped in awe.</p><br/><p>It was obvious that they thought extremely highly of that artwork.</p><br/><p>In the private room.</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan entered, the few elderly men looked at Lin Fan and then they turned to Yue Qiu Ju Shi and Tao Shi Gang. It was as if they were enquiring about him.</p><br/><p>Yue Qiu Ju Shi smiled. \u201cThis is Master Lin, the one you\u2019ve been wanting to meet.\u201d</p><br/><p>The few elderly men that were discussing amongst themselves stood up and were in disbelief.</p><br/><p>They hadn\u2019t expected Master Lin to be so young. It was simply unbelievable.</p><br/><p>One of the elderly men smiled. \u201cYoung and capable. How extraordinary. Nice to meet you, Master Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHi.\u201d Lin Fan smiled and shook his hand. He looked at him and said, \u201cYou\u2019ve been in the military all your life and you only started drawing in the later years of your life. It\u2019s indeed a good way to reinvigorate yourself.\u201d</p><br/><p>The elderly man was stunned. \u201cMaster Lin, you recognize me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled and shook his head, \u201cNope, but I kinda know how to read fortunes by looking at facial appearances.\u201d</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t just \u2018kinda\u2019 know how to read fortunes by looking at one\u2019s face. He could know a lot about someone just by looking at their face.</p><br/><p>Yue Qiu Ju Shi introduced, \u201cMaster Lin, let me introduce him. He\u2019s a former military chief but he\u2019s the president of our association, Zheng Zhong Shan.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, he continued to introduce the other elderly men and Lin Fan shook their hands.</p><br/><p>They were all in love with his artwork but it was a pity that Yue Qiu Ju Shi treated it as his most precious treasure. He didn\u2019t want to give it to anyone. It was a headache for them but now that they could see the artist of that artwork, they were satisfied. At the same time, they thought of something as well.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

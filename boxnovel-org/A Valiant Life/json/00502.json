In the past, there weren\u2019t so many people at night but at that moment, four or five people just went in.</p><br/><p>In the bathhouse.</p><br/><p>A middle-aged man with spectacles spent some time in the bath before a back-scrubber approached him. \u201cBoss, do you need a back scrub?\u201d</p><br/><p>A wave of customers had just come, causing them to be overwhelmingly busy. Now that they saw that there were still a few people in the bath, they went up to ask them. If no one else wanted a scrub, then the workers could go and rest.</p><br/><p>\u201cMmm, I do want a back scrub. Is the person with the best technique here that young man?\u201d asked the middle-aged man.</p><br/><p>The worker replied, \u201cOf course. His technique is incredible. The rest of us can\u2019t even compare to him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll wait for him to finish and have him scrub my body,\u201d said the middle-aged man.</p><br/><p>The worker nodded, \u201cAlright. You don\u2019t look familiar. This must be your first time here. But don\u2019t worry. After experiencing it once, you will remember it for life.\u201d</p><br/><p>The middle-aged man replied with a smile, \u201cI hope so.\u201d</p><br/><p>Soon after, Lin Fan finished his work and relaxed.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Boss, there\u2019s someone waiting for you to scrub his back,\u201d said the worker.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked over. He hadn\u2019t expected to have another customer right after he finished scrubbing one. But it didn\u2019t matter. Today, there were even more customers and most of them requested for Lin Fan personally. This left him helpless but it also meant that his back-scrubbing abilities had gradually become well-known.</p><br/><p>\u201cBoss, please come over here,\u201d said Lin Fan with a smile.</p><br/><p>Liu Biao had been noticing Lin Fan for a long time. He realized that this person\u2019s back-scrubbing technique was different from what he usually saw. He was a little curious as to how it would feel.</p><br/><p>Since people had praised him so much, Liu Biao wondered if he was really that great.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey\u2026\u201d Lin Fan\u2019s gaze fell on Liu Biao\u2019s face and he was a little stunned. Something serious seemed to have happened.</p><br/><p>Liu Biao was a little startled as well. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled, \u201cNothing much. It\u2019s just that you look like a literati.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Biao chuckled and didn\u2019t say much else. He clearly didn\u2019t want to speak about this topic. Then, he lay down there and closed his eyes.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan\u2019s heart was beating quickly. This guy was quite impressive. Then, Lin Fan took his tools out and started scrubbing.</p><br/><p>From when he had started until now, Lin Fan had never come across anyone who could stay calm and composed while he scrubbed that person\u2019s front.</p><br/><p>Liu Biao couldn\u2019t take it anymore, \u201cScrub my back, scrub my back.\u201d</p><br/><p>Embarrassing!</p><br/><p>Liu Biao felt a response at \u2018that part\u2019 and had to cover it. Otherwise, he would get laughed at.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan scrubbed his back. Meanwhile, Liu Biao suddenly felt a strange feeling deep inside his heart.</p><br/><p>It was as if an energy was brewing inside his body.</p><br/><p>Deep in his heart, a change gradually occurred. This change was very mysterious and he didn\u2019t know how to describe it.</p><br/><p>Then, Liu Biao\u2019s mouth moved, \u201cJust now, you saw my appearance and said that I looked like a literati, right? Your guess was really spot on. I do indeed work in this field.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed, \u201cHehe, looks like I guessed right. I can tell that you have many thoughts in your heart. It must be uncomfortable to keep them bottled up.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Biao sighed, \u201cI\u2019m tired. I\u2019m really too tired. You don\u2019t know this but I haven\u2019t had a good sleep in several decades. I have nightmares every night. A man really isn\u2019t allowed to commit any wrongdoings in his life. Otherwise, he wouldn\u2019t be able to erase them for life.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIndeed.\u201d Lin Fan nodded.</p><br/><p>*sob sob* Suddenly, Liu Biao started crying.</p><br/><p>The surrounding back-scrubbers were all stunned. Little Boss had scrubbed someone to tears once again. Just what kind of demonic powers did Little Boss possess, to be able to scrub someone to tears?</p><br/><p>\u201cIn the past, I didn\u2019t work in this field but I had no choice but to conceal my identity. Now that you\u2019ve scrubbed me, I\u2019m recalling all the past incidents. I feel so regretful, I really do!\u201d said Liu Biao with a sorrowful expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen a man commits wrongdoings, he should bravely face his mistakes. It is only when he admits his mistakes that he can walk away from them,\u201d said Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Liu Biao nodded, \u201cRight. What you said is very right.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Encyclopedia\u2019s mystical boost gradually seeped into Liu Biao\u2019s body. The more Lin Fan scrubbed, the more powerful it became. The darkness deep in Liu Biao\u2019s heart gradually dissipated and was replaced with light. Suddenly, it was as if Liu Biao understood many things.</p><br/><p>Liu Biao suddenly said, \u201cI must go and give myself up.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan stopped for a moment, then continued scrubbing. When he had first seen Liu Biao, he had felt that this person looked strange. When he looked closer, he really saw some problems.</p><br/><p>The other back-scrubbers were stunned. They couldn\u2019t help but ask curiously, \u201cBoss, what exactly did you commit? Why must you give yourself up?\u201d</p><br/><p>This recent period, to them, has been too strange. They really didn\u2019t know how to describe it.</p><br/><p>Everyone who got scrubbed my Little Boss would have their brains temporarily short-circuited and have problems arise.</p><br/><p>\u201cMurder,\u201d Liu Biao turned around and said in a deep voice, \u201cI murdered a number of people.\u201d</p><br/><p>The back scrubbers were dumbfounded. Then, they shook their heads, \u201cBoss, you really know how to joke. How could you have murdered people?\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Biao didn\u2019t speak but made a remorseful expression.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan\u2019s heart was thumping furiously. This Encyclopedia\u2019s powers were too perverse. Did this back-scrubbing skill really scrub out people\u2019s conscience?</p><br/><p>Incredible. Simply incredible.</p><br/><p>The other workers didn\u2019t know if this was real. But the customer\u2019s tone was really terrifying.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cDon\u2019t be anxious. Let me give you a good scrub. You won\u2019t know if you\u2019ll ever be able to come here again but perhaps there is still hope.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Biao nodded, \u201cMmm. I finally figured it out. I\u2019d rather face my problems than run away from them. This matter has entrapped me for several decades. I\u2019d rather give myself up than be caught. At least I might be able to maintain my remaining dignity.\u201d</p><br/><p>This topic was a grave one. It was slightly terrifying.</p><br/><p>The surrounding back-scrubbers didn\u2019t say a word. They felt that this customer was very strange.</p><br/><p>However, what was up with Little Boss? He didn\u2019t seem surprised at all. He even seemed to believe it.</p><br/><p>This wasn\u2019t right. If Little Boss believed it, why wasn\u2019t he scared at all?</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Outside the bathhouse.</p><br/><p>Liu Biao took out his phone and dialed a number that he rarely called.</p><br/><p>The call went through.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you want? Didn\u2019t I tell you not to call me too often?\u201d An uneasy voice came from the other side of the call.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuang Jun, it\u2019s already been twenty years. Just now, I was having a back scrub in a bathhouse and I suddenly realized that we shouldn\u2019t be like this,\u201d said Liu Biao.</p><br/><p>Huang Jun said, \u201cLiu Biao, have you been scrubbed stupid? You don\u2019t even know my name anymore? Huang Jun is already dead. What are you trying to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Biao said in a very calm voice, \u201cDon\u2019t call me Liu Biao anymore. Call me Liu Bing. That\u2019s my real name. We don\u2019t have to hide anymore. I\u2019m prepared to give myself up. Alright, I\u2019m hanging up. I just wanted to tell you that as a person, you can\u2019t run from your problems. You can only face them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, hey\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>*beeeeep*</p><br/><p>Then, Liu Biao made a call. It was a number given by the Little Bro who had scrubbed his back.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs this Inspector Liu?\u201d asked Liu Biao.</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian was just doing official business, checking on documents. Then, he stopped and replied, \u201cYes, I am. You are?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHello, Inspector Liu. I am Liu Biao but my real name is Liu Bing. Twenty years ago, I robbed and killed a family of four at a hotel. I want to surrender myself now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

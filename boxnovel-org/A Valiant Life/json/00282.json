Whether that fella would be fearful of cards in the future, only he would know. But from the looks of it, perhaps Lin Fan had succeeded.</p><br/><p>After this incident, he suddenly thought of what he should do to complete his task and he felt extremely confident about completing it. He believed that he would be able to complete it and benefit himself and others.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang had wanted to introduce Lin Fan to everyone and that was why he had brought him along. He wanted Lin Fan to know more people and have more connections which would help him in the future.</p><br/><p>But what shocked Wang Ming Yang was that this brother of his was too d*mn awesome. He became so well-liked in this short period of time.</p><br/><p>Initially, he had wanted to host a party to allow them to know him better. But now, everyone that was around them was practically his good friend. It was like they had known him for decades. This was tremendously shocking to him.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan stood there and just smiled. He answered the questions that he had answers to and just smiled at some of them.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, those that didn't manage to get their questions answered weren't unhappy about it either.</p><br/><p>The happiest person in the entire place was definitely Jin Yun Ming. He was the only one to have received Master Lin's guidance. As for the future projects, he was determined to be more cautious.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang walked over and smiled. \"How is it? This brother of mine is awesome, right?\"</p><br/><p>\"Awesome, he's indeed very awesome. Ming Yang, you did a good job this time.\" He Cheng Han smiled. He was convinced by Master Lin's abilities. Nobody else could understand how accurate his words were.</p><br/><p>Even his closest relatives didn't know about those things but Master Lin knew everything about it. What did that mean? It meant that he was an amazing fortune-teller.</p><br/><p>The people that were attending this event were powerful people in the Shanghai economy. Although they weren't the top people in the world, they were still the cream of the crop in the country.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled, \"You guys are too courteous. It's just a small thing. I'm not that good.\"</p><br/><p>Although he was modest, he still admitted that he was awesome. He wouldn't have acted so confidently if he wasn't capable of executing that.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang smiled. \"Alright, there will be more opportunities in the future. Have a good chat, everyone. Let's not talk about work this time. Let's gossip about things.\"</p><br/><p>The main reason for organizing the salon event was to improve the relations between his friends. People were always busy with work and they rarely met each other. Now that they had so much time, they didn't want to talk about work. They wanted to talk about other things to improve their relationship with one another.</p><br/><p>They partied until 10:30 at night.</p><br/><p>It was pretty late.</p><br/><p>These wealthy men and women all politely said goodbye to Lin Fan. From their point of view, their biggest reward for attending this event was to have met someone like Master Lin.</p><br/><p>Although they weren't close, if they were to continue talking to each other, they would definitely be close friends.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan also thought that it was rather late and he didn't want to stay any further. As for the mess left behind by everyone, the helpers were there to take care of it. Hence, he just left.</p><br/><p>He drove slowly on the streets outside as he wasn't in a rush to go home.</p><br/><p>He was looking around the streets when suddenly, a silhouette appeared right in front of the car.</p><br/><p>He immediately jammed the brakes.</p><br/><p>Thankfully, he hadn't been driving at a high speed.</p><br/><p>\"Was it a scammer that tried to fake an accident?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was a little shocked but judging by what had just happened, he hadn't bumped into anyone.</p><br/><p>Indeed, a few seconds later, the person stood up. He didn't even look at Lin Fan and just went forward.</p><br/><p>\"What's going on?\" Lin Fan was shocked. What was this man's problem? If he was a scammer, he would've pretended to be down on the ground.</p><br/><p>He drove the car slowly alongside this man and wound down his windows.</p><br/><p>\"Bro, what's wrong? If you're worried about something, don't take it out on me!\" Lin Fan said as he looked at him. He realized that the man looked as if he wanted to die. This person wanted to kill himself.</p><br/><p>But this man just ignored Lin Fan. He just continued walking as if he was looking for something.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the situation and didn't think much of it. Since he had time, he looked at him and read his fortune. He looked pale and he had run out of luck.</p><br/><p>\"Did you lose everything while gambling?\" Lin Fan asked.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, the man stopped walking and looked at Lin Fan. He remained silent for some time.</p><br/><p>Then, he said with a trembling voice, \"How did you know that?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan stopped the car at the side and left the car. \"I can tell from your appearance.\"</p><br/><p>Then, the man suddenly collapsed onto the ground and cried, \"What am I supposed to do in the future?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan wasn't a busybody but since this man was in need, he had to take a look at him.</p><br/><p>He leaned on the car door and folded his arms. \"Tell me, what's wrong?\"</p><br/><p>The man raised his head. \"I am Wang Tao. I just opened a car-washing company. Yesterday, my friend asked me to have dinner with him and I drank too much. Then, I went home to shower. After that, they said they wanted to play cards. I was a drunk and so I participated in it. When I became sober, I realized that I had lost all my savings and I am even in a debt of one million dollars. I still have a wife and kids. What do you think I can do with my current state? I'm thinking if I were to die now, it would resolve everything\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan took out a packet of cigarette from his car and gave the man a stick, \"Here, have a cigarette. You'll feel better. There's always light at the end of the tunnel. Why are you thinking of ending your life?\"</p><br/><p>*click*</p><br/><p>He lit the cigarette and smoke filled the air.</p><br/><p>Wang Tao looked at Lin Fan. \"Who are you? Why are you chatting with me?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. \"I am a fortune-teller. I see that your life's pretty bad and so I decided to find out more.\"</p><br/><p>\"Fortune-telling\u2026\" Wang Tao looked at Lin Fan and said, \"Can you knock me down and kill me?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was stunned. \"Huh?\"</p><br/><p>It was the first time that he had heard someone requesting for him to kill him.</p><br/><p>Wang Tao lowered his head and continued smoking. \"I can cross the road when the light's red and you can knock me down. My insurance fees can still be claimed for my family to use\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan threw his cigarette onto the floor. This man was crazy. What had happened to him to cause him to think that way?</p><br/><p>\"Bro, you should think of something else. Everything can be resolved. Why are you thinking of that?\" Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>*Ding ding!*</p><br/><p>Then, Wang Tao's phone rang. He just stared blankly at it.</p><br/><p>\"Who is it? Those that asked you to gamble?\" Lin Fan asked.</p><br/><p>Wang Tao nodded.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan thought about it and said, \"Answer it. Say that someone is going to repay your debt for you. Ask them to come and look for you.\"</p><br/><p>Wang Tao remained silent and continued to stare at it. Lin Fan added, \"What's wrong? Are you scared? You don't even fear death. Why should you be afraid of these people? If this can help you get back your money, isn't it better?\"</p><br/><p>Wang Tao was stunned and then it seemed as if he understood Lin Fan's words. \"Yeah, I'm not even afraid of dying. Why should I be afraid of anything else?\"</p><br/><p>He answered the call.</p><br/><p>Wang Tao spoke to the person calmly and then quickly hung up.</p><br/><p>\"I think you've been cheated by this group of people,\" Lin Fan said. Then, he took out his phone and called Liu Xiao Tian. \"Inspector Liu, sorry to disturb you at this hour. I just saw someone that tried to kill himself on the streets. It's because he got cheated by a group of gamblers. I think you should come here.\"</p><br/><p>Wang Tao looked at Lin Fan and said, \"It's useless. I was a willing party too. I gambled my money away. The terms and conditions were written and signed. What could the police do for me?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled, \"Don't think of it that way. Some things are made worse by your own pessimism. What if they really ganged up to cheat your money?\"</p><br/><p>\"How could it be\u2026\" Wang Tao shook his head and said. He still didn't believe that they had really cheated him.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan didn't say anything. He just waited. Sometimes, he was completely in awe of how perverse his fortune-telling could get. Especially when he was able to see that this Wang Tao had been cheated by a group of people.</p><br/><p>After a while, a car drove over.</p><br/><p>The three men walked over and said, \"Brother Tao\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Wang Tao stared at them blankly and lowered his head.</p><br/><p>One of the men, who was bald and plump, looked at Lin Fan from head to toe. \"Brother Tao, this is\u2026?\"</p><br/><p>He didn't know who this man was but they were feeling ecstatic. They hadn't expected Wang Tao to find someone to pay them in such a short time.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan lightly tapped the cigarette to get rid of the ashes. Then, he smiled. \"You don't have to care who I am. How much does he owe you?\"</p><br/><p>The plump man said, \"Brother Tao owes us a total of $1.45million. We already asked him to not gamble but Brother Tao insisted on coming over. But since the terms and conditions have been written on paper, Brother Tao can't deny it.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled, \"Oh, $1.45million, that's not much. My friend will be coming over to send money later. Don't be anxious.\"</p><br/><p>The plump man smiled. \"We're not anxious. We can take it slow.\"</p><br/><p>Then, the two other men stood by Wang Tao. \"Brother Tao, it's nothing much. You have such a rich friend to pay for you. Why are you still worried? Money can be easily earned back. In the future, if you want to earn back your money, just look for me. We are not the type to run away after winning.\"</p><br/><p>Then, two police cars came.</p><br/><p>The three men were a little nervous when they saw the police cars. But they remained calm. They hadn't done anything wrong, there was nothing to be afraid of.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled, \"Don't be nervous. The police cars came because of me. I just called the police.\"</p><br/><p>The three men were stunned. Then, the plump man said, \"Brother, you're a little insincere. We didn't do anything wrong. Why did you call the police? Furthermore, he owes us $1.45million. It's not just because of gambling. It's protected by the law too.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. \"It's okay, we can talk about that later.\"</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian exited the police car, \"What's wrong?\"</p><br/><p>The plump man went forward. \"Sir, it's nothing much. This man owes us money. We are here to collect the debt. He's the one that called the police but we don't know why.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan pointed at the three of them and said, \"The three of them ganged up and cheated him. They had an ulterior motive when they asked him to gamble with them.\"</p><br/><p>The plump man said nervously, \"We didn't gamble and we didn't cheat his money. Don't accuse us like that.\"</p><br/><p>If it had been someone else that called the police, Liu Xiao Tian would've been a little doubtful of the claims. But this was Master Lin. This matter was worth investigating.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. \"Touch his shirt. The part under his chest should contain a lot of cards.\"</p><br/><p>The plump man was stunned when he heard it. His expression changed and he looked as if he wanted to escape. But Liu Xiao Tian quickly touched the shirt. Indeed, this man had hidden many cards.</p><br/><p>\"Brother, you can bring the police to the place where you gambled. I think there will be more evidence there. You could possibly retrieve the money you've lost,\" Lin Fan said calmly as if he had everything under control.</p><br/><p>It was as if these three men had seen a ghost. Their eyes were filled with fear. Then, Lin Fan's words stunned all of them.</p><br/><p>\"These two skinny men have caused trouble before. This plump one has a problem too. Please conduct a detailed search, Inspector Liu. I'll leave the rest to you. I'll head back first,\" Lin Fan said and waved his hand. This matter had practically been solved. The remaining problems were up to Liu Xiao Tian to handle.</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian went forward when he saw that Lin Fan was leaving. \"You're just going to leave this to us?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled, \"Inspector Liu, you're a police officer. I'm a good citizen. I have to help you guys whenever I can but the final outcome depends on you guys. I won't say anything else, I'll be heading back home to rest. Oh, right, I shifted my shop to Tian Hong Commercial Street. When it opens officially, you can come over and have a look.\"</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian patted Lin Fan on his shoulder. \"Alright. Ever since I got to know you, I've gotten busier.\"</p><br/><p>\"Haha,\" Lin Fan laughed. \"Isn't that a good thing? The more work you have, the more peaceful the society will be.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved his hand and entered the car. Then, he said to Wang Tao, \"Brother, don't gamble in the future. The money that you win from gambling is often from unreliable sources.\"</p><br/><p>Wang Tao looked at Lin Fan in a daze. He only recovered from it after Lin Fan drove off.</p><br/><p>...</p><br/>\n</div>"}

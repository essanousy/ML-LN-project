He realized this Grandpa in front of him was really bad.</p><br/><p>\"Does it hurt?\"</p><br/><p>\"Does it hurt?\"</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing kept touching Lil' Fatty's leg. He wasn't a newbie, he was a veteran Chinese doctor. Although he didn't understand his teacher's technique, according to his medical knowledge, this wasn't possible.</p><br/><p>\"Waaa\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Lil' Fatty kept on crying. This Grandpa in front of his was like a pervert touching his legs. To Zhao Ming Qing, if he couldn't clarify this matter today, he wouldn't be able to eat or rest in peace.\"</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing looked at Lin Fan, \"Teacher, can he stand now?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \"Since you're a veteran Chinese doctor, do you think he can stand?\"</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing was taken aback. Then, he said, a little ashamed, \"What I was taught is that this injury has been here for many years and he just regained his senses today. He definitely cannot stand, he needs further treatment first.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan patted Lil' Fatty on the head and said, \"Good boy, stop crying. Listen to teacher. Come down and try to stand, see how it goes.\"</p><br/><p>Lil' Fatty choked with emotion several times, then stopped crying. Slowly, he stood up on the ground. He smiled in amazement. It was as if he just made a great breakthrough. \"I can move!\"</p><br/><p>Lin fan looked at Zhao Ming Qing, \"Since you're a veteran Chinese doctor, you need to have your own views. The nerves in his legs have already recovered, don't you think he should be able to stand?\"</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing became even more ashamed. He even wanted to cry a little as he said, \"Teacher, whatever you teach is right.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded appreciatively, \"You still have a long way to go. There is much to learn. Take it slowly and don't rush it.\"</p><br/><p>\"Director Huang, what do you think?\" asked Lin Fan with a smiled.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Director Huang's jaw had dropped as she stared blankly at the scene. Her eyes had widened and she didn't dare to believe everything before her. Then, she looked at Lin Fan in shock, \"Master Lin, how did you do that\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan calmly smiled and replied, \"I forgot to tell you all. My medical skills are even more awesome than any of my other specialties.\"</p><br/><p>Han Lu looked at Lin Fan in astonishment. He now understood why Master Lin wouldn't take him as a disciple. Fighting was simply a waste of time and nothing much could be accomplished from it. After seeing this, he understood that he was way too immature in the past.</p><br/><p>Seeing this kind of joyful thing happen in front of him, he realized that this kind of thing was what would make him the happiest.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Director Huang grabbed Lin Fan's hand, \"Master Lin, do you think all these children will be able to regain their health?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded, \"That shouldn't be a problem but those who are missing limbs can't be helped for now. We'll have to see if anything can be done in the future.\"</p><br/><p>Healing someone who was missing an arm or a leg was indeed impossible but if Lin Fan could attain some other major class knowledge, it might still be possible in future. Hence, there was no rush to make a conclusion. There was still hope.</p><br/><p>Director Huang felt as if she was immersed in a dream and she couldn't wake up from it. All these didn't make any sense.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing looked at Lin Fan. He couldn't figure it out. Lin Fan was so young but his medical skills were so great. How did he accomplish such a feat?</p><br/><p>However, he was incomparably excited. Before, when this teacher of his treated his lung disease, he knew that his teacher's medical skills were brilliant. However, he didn't know just how brilliant they were. Now he finally knew. When he compared his teacher to himself, it was like comparing heaven and earth. They were simply incomparable.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Outside Nanshan Children's Welfare Institute.</p><br/><p>\"Bro, Dad is just inside here. What do you think we should do?\" asked Zhao Bin.</p><br/><p>Zhao Li Xing frowned and shook his head, \"We don't know anything yet. But don't be anxious. We mustn't scare this snake away. If we're going to capture him, we'll need some concrete evidence.\"</p><br/><p>Zhao Bin said, \"Then do we just wait here?\"</p><br/><p>Zhao Li Xing nodded, \"Mmm. We'll just wait here. We have to see just what exactly is going on.\"</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Time passed, all the way until six in the evening.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan and Zhao Ming Qing appeared at the Nanshan Children's Welfare Institute's entrance.</p><br/><p>\"I'm a little tired.\" Lin Fan stretched his body. The outcome of the treatments that day was not bad but the amount of work to be done was too great. At the current rate, they would take a period of time to complete it.</p><br/><p>Moreover, those Chinese medicines had to be boiled. It wasn't possible to do that here but with Zhao Ming Qing around, getting the right medicines made wouldn't be a problem.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing maintained his astonished expression the whole time. It was as if he had seen something terrifying.</p><br/><p>\"Teacher, just what is the theory behind this?\" Zhao Ming Qing asked Lin Fan. he really couldn't figure it out.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan sneezed, then replied, \"Think about it slowly by yourself first. I'm a little tired.\"</p><br/><p>\"No, Teacher, I really don't understand. I've read many old books before and they did describe this but in a situation like this, I feel that it isn't quite right. Do you think\u2026\" Zhao Ming Qing was trying to seek knowledge but Lin Fan currently didn't have much energy. He didn't give Zhao Ming Qing a chance to speak. Lin Fan interrupted, \"I'm going back first. Go get a taxi for yourself. I'm way too tired. If you still want to come take a look tomorrow, then come by yourself.\"</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing nodded, \"Alright, Teacher. Don't worry, I'll be on time tomorrow.\"</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>Lin Fan went to his car and drove off by himself. He didn't go to Cloud Street, instead, he went straight home. Although today's task wasn't challenging, the sheer amount of work was very taxing.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing kept thinking about the day's incidents on the way back but he just couldn't figure it out. What he saw today was simply mind-blowing. If he hadn't seen it for himself, he would never have believed it.</p><br/><p>Nighttime.</p><br/><p>At a certain villa.</p><br/><p>It was dinner time.</p><br/><p>Zhao Shi discreetly pointed at Zhao Ming Qing, indicating to her children that their father seemed to be possessed.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing didn't say a single word. He just lowered his head and ate. But occasionally, his brows would furrow and noises would be made from his mouth.</p><br/><p>\"What's going on?\"</p><br/><p>\"A mental problem?\"</p><br/><p>*clatter*</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing put down his bowl and chopsticks. \"You guys continue eating. I'm going to the study room, don't disturb me.\"</p><br/><p>\"Why don't you finish the food first?\"</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing shook his head. He wasn't in the mood to eat. He was thinking about the reason behind what Lin Fan had done that day. He couldn't be at peace without figuring it out.</p><br/><p>After Zhao Ming Qing left, Zhao Bin said, \"Big Bro and I followed Dad today. We suspect that Dad has been tricked by someone.\"</p><br/><p>Zhao Shi said worryingly, \"Is something going to happen?\"</p><br/><p>Zhao Li Xing shook his head, \"Nothing will happen. I'll keep following Dad for now. If you all have work to do, then go do it. Leave this to me.\"</p><br/><p>Zhao Bin said, \"Mom, I saw it today. The person our Dad has taken as his master is just a young kid. Dad is a well-known figure in the Chinese medical world. If he becomes the disciple of a young kid, he'll be laughed at.\"</p><br/><p>\"What do you think we should do?\" asked Zhao Shi.</p><br/><p>Zhao Li Xing replied, \"I think we shouldn't say too much for now. I'll tell those Uncles and Aunties about the situation so that they won't come for nothing. When the time comes that I've gathered enough evidence, I'll take that man down.\"</p><br/><p>Zhao Shi nodded. \"Looks like that's the only way.\"</p><br/><p>In the study room.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing was looking for related books from the bookshelf. However, he couldn't get any leads. Many of the books were missing several pages. He had no clue where to start.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

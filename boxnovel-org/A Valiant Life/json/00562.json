Lin Fan was a little speechless. If he couldn\u2019t find an alchemy furnace, that would mean that he would have to try risking everything with a high-pressure cooker again.</p><br/><p>It was too dangerous. If he wasn\u2019t cautious, a tragedy could happen.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan came before a stall. \u201cUncle, may I know if Antique Street has any ancient alchemy furnaces? Those that aren\u2019t for display.\u201d</p><br/><p>The old man placed some antiques down at the side. \u201cYoung chap, there\u2019s everything here. The ancient alchemy furnaces are huge and it isn\u2019t easy to move them here. There wouldn\u2019t be any here. Furthermore, those alchemy furnaces that are more than a thousand years old would be extremely expensive. They\u2019d be kept by the collectors. Why would it be sold here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was disappointed. He didn\u2019t expect to have found nothing at all.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing looked at his mentor\u2019s disappointed expression. He didn\u2019t know what to say.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, let\u2019s try another place, shall we?\u201d Zhao Ming Qing asked.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved his hand, \u201cForget it, we can think of another solution next time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Since there weren\u2019t any there, what else could they do? He would have to take up more time to create the pill and not be too anxious about it.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d Lin Fan sounded a little disappointed. He was really curious about the Little Intelligence pill. He didn\u2019t know how the results would turn out to be. After all, this is the first knowledge classification that was classified as mythical. Since he couldn\u2019t find the proper tools for it, he was extremely regretful.</p><br/><p>At the junction.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was about to enter his car but he realized that Zhao Ming Qing was just standing there. \u201cMing Qing, what are you doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing pointed forward, \u201cTeacher, what is happening there?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked towards the direction he was pointing at. There was a lady carrying a child at the roadside. She was on her knees and she was moving forward slowly.</p><br/><p>He was a little curious. Then, he closed his door and walked to Zhao Ming Qing. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening? Is it some street art?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing shook his head, \u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go and have a look,\u201d Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>The middle-aged lady\u2019s actions had attracted the attention of a lot of people. They were all curious as to why she was kneeling and moving at the same time.</p><br/><p>They couldn\u2019t understand it.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was in the middle of the crowd and he asked curiously, \u201cDo you know what is happening?\u201d</p><br/><p>The passersby shook their heads.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, I just saw her.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI saw them at the traffic light just now. Suddenly, she knelt down and moved here slowly. I don\u2019t know what happened.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, the passersby took out their phones and started recording the situation.</p><br/><p>Because this was really abnormal. Everyone was extremely curious.</p><br/><p>It was somewhat unbelievable.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing went forward to the middle-aged lady, \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>The middle-aged lady looked at Zhao Ming Qing but carried on moving on her knees. \u201cI want to go to the large trade and commerce building.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing replied, \u201cYou can just walk there, why are you kneeling down?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing knew that there were a lot of weird cultural practices and he believed that the middle-aged lady was from a culture that respected commercial buildings greatly. They had to move there on their knees to show respect. However, it just didn\u2019t seem right at all.</p><br/><p>The middle-aged lady shook her head, \u201cSomeone told me that as long as I kneeled and moved to the large trade and commerce building on my knees, he would give me $100,000 and I would have money to heal my daughter of eye cancer.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing was stunned. \u201cThat\u2019s rubbish. Stand up now. There\u2019s no such thing.\u201d</p><br/><p>The middle-aged lady shook her head, \u201cDon\u2019t care about me. I have to try no matter what.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing rushed back and was infuriated. \u201cTeacher, someone told her that as long as she knelt and moved towards the large trade and commerce building, he would give her $100,000 to treat her daughter\u2019s eye cancer. I tried to pull her up but she didn\u2019t want to get up. What should we do?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan frowned, \u201cIsn\u2019t he humiliating her?\u201d</p><br/><p>The crowd around Lin Fan were furious when they heard it.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho was it? How could he be so cruel?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe is literally stomping on her dignity.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe should just forget about his \u2018kind offer\u2019.\u201d</p><br/><p>Someone went forward, \u201cSis, you\u2019re too gullible. Who told you that? Did you see him?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Mei shook her head, \u201cNo, but he called me and told me he was willing to help me. He just requested for me to kneel down and move to the building from San Lin Road. He would give me $100,000 immediately.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSigh, sis, just get up now. He is definitely a scammer. You\u2019re too gullible.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Mei shook her head, \u201cAs long as there is hope for my child, I will not give up. Don\u2019t bother about me. This is my own affair.\u201d</p><br/><p>The crowd went silent.</p><br/><p>They didn\u2019t know what to say.</p><br/><p>What else could they say?</p><br/><p>Her child was ill and she needed money. If they were to stop her, she would lose her only hope. Unless they were willing to pay for her, or else they would be taking her only hope away.</p><br/><p>Then, the crowd was stunned.</p><br/><p>Some townsfolk said, \u201cSis, don\u2019t do that. You can put it on the news and let everyone donate.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a good idea.\u201d</p><br/><p>However, Xie Mei didn\u2019t listen to them. She continued kneeling and moving forward.</p><br/><p>Then, the reporters came. They rushed over after hearing what was happening at the streets of Shanghai.</p><br/><p>As reporters, they\u2019ve seen all sorts of weird occurrences but this was the first time they heard about this.</p><br/><p>They felt that this case was going to be a special one.</p><br/><p>It seemed like a despicable scam.</p><br/><p>People were using the Internet to earn money.</p><br/><p>Therefore, a lot of people ventured into the Internet and scammed people by using click baits. At the same time, the increase in the number of viewers would give them money to do dirty and immoral tricks.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing said, \u201cTeacher, this is a terrible situation. How could the person do this to her?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan frowned, \u201cLet\u2019s have a look.\u201d</p><br/><p>At the scene.</p><br/><p>The reporters asked, \u201cSister, are you sure the other party would give you the money? Are you sure he would be waiting there for you? Who would give you the money?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Mei pointed forward, \u201cThe man is just there. He is waiting for me. As long as I reach the building, I would have money to treat my child.\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporters looked forward and there were a lot of people in front. They didn\u2019t know who she pointed to.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, at the large trade and commerce building, a youngster took a picture with his phone. Then, he posted the picture and video online.</p><br/><p>\u201cBoss, it\u2019s working. We can post on Weibo now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNoted.\u201d</p><br/><p>This time, they were the ones behind this. The \u2018boss\u2019 was the person in charge of managing the Internet. He created a Weibo account known as \u2018Great Philanthropist\u2019. At the same time, he would report the matter as a third party.</p><br/><p>He had already thought of what to do after the incident.</p><br/><p>He was going to act as the middleman and make himself famous.</p><br/><p>As for the $100,000, he was definitely not going to give it.</p><br/><p>Of course, he wasn\u2019t going to tell her that. He would speak to the press and report the matter of \u2018Great Philanthropist\u2019 to the reporters. This way, he would rise to fame.</p><br/><p>Zhu Quan understood three principles from Internet scams.</p><br/><p>Firstly, the spread of fake news that would destroy or improve lives greatly would be reposted the most.</p><br/><p>Secondly, the news that infuriated netizens would be next.</p><br/><p>Thirdly, news that was just for entertainment which would shock people would also be one of the key factors to ensure that the news would be publicised quickly.</p></div>\n</div>"}

We will visit you in Shanghai.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m f*cked.\u201d Lin Fan felt helpless. <em>What the f*ck is going on? </em>Then, he turned to Zhao Zhong Yang and immediately grabbed his neck. \u201cYou talk way too much!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh! Save me! Brother Lin, have mercy. I won\u2019t do it again!\u201d Zhao Zhong Yang squealed like a pig being slaughtered.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan pinched Zhao Zhong Yang\u2019s chest. \u201cDo you still dare to do something like that again?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh!\u201d Zhao Zhong Yang screamed. \u201cBrother Lin, don\u2019t pinch me. It hurts! I won\u2019t dare to do it again!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d When Lin Fan heard Zhao Zhong Yang\u2019s scream, he was dazed. He hadn\u2019t expected this guy to be so noisy.</p><br/><p>When Fraud Tian saw this, he roared with laughter. \u201cGood! You should let this kid know your power.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut honestly, people in the past would agree to have their heads smashed if it meant that they could become the chief but you actually don\u2019t want it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan tilted his head over. \u201cIf you want to be the chief, you do it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian sighed helplessly. \u201cEven if I want to, those people won\u2019t acknowledge me. Comparing oneself to others will really drive one mad. I\u2019m so strong, why don\u2019t I have such an opportunity?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan covered her mouth as she started laughing.</p><br/><p>The association members in the car did the same as well. They were really in admiration of Master Lin. If they hadn\u2019t seen everything for themselves, they wouldn\u2019t have believed it.</p><br/><p>He was proficient in every style of martial art. It was simply terrifying.</p><br/><p>In the past, they had known about Master Lin\u2019s position as the association\u2019s Vice-President but they had no knowledge of his abilities.</p><br/><p>After all, on the news, Master Lin\u2019s biggest strengths had always been medicine, Chinese art, etcetera.</p><br/><p>As for his martial arts, it had only been mentioned a few times on the news.</p><br/><p>But after this incident, they now understood that Master Lin was a super expert. Moreover, it wasn\u2019t as simple as others thought.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan returned to his original position, glaring at Zhao Zhong Yang. \u201cWhen we go back, I\u2019ll have a good chat with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang looked helpless as he was filled with regret. If he had known this would happen, he wouldn\u2019t have said those things. He wondered how Brother Lin was going to settle him when they go back.</p><br/><p>However, when he saw Brother Lin take out his phone, Zhao Zhong Yang started smiling again. \u201cBrother Lin, are you looking at the news? Right now, the news on the Internet is very viral. I\u2019m looking too. Do you want me to tell you about it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan glanced at him. \u201cNo. It\u2019s not like I can\u2019t read.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, Zhao Zhong Yang had a thought in his mind. He was thinking that he would have to find a place to hide when they return.</p><br/><p>On the Internet.</p><br/><p>This video had made a tremendous impact. Countless netizens had already kneeled in submission after watching this shocking video.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s really too strong. Is this Master Lin still human?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if he\u2019s human but I know that Master Lin\u2019s awesomeness is out of this world.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m a martial arts hobbyist. I\u2019ve seen all of these techniques before and I feel that Master Lin is better at all of them than the people I\u2019ve seen. He can probably kill someone.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c^Don\u2019t act like you know everything. You speak as if you understand all about this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI really understand it. You\u2019re all just looking at the surface of the video but I can see that every punch and every kick from Master Lin would at least break several bones if it hit someone. And they would even be sent flying through five or six meters.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck, stop bragging. I don\u2019t believe that he\u2019s that strong.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t believe me then. It\u2019s useless to try and explain it to you guys.</p><br/><p>On a certain martial arts web forum.</p><br/><p>A thread had been all the way at the top.</p><br/><p>\u2018At the Kunlun Mountain Martial Arts Meet, true experts will gather.\u2019</p><br/><p>This thread hadn\u2019t been about Lin Fan at first. It had been in anticipation of the event at Kunlun Mountain. Over ten thousand comments were talking about how excited they were.</p><br/><p>But now, this thread had been overtaken by another thread.</p><br/><p>\u2018Master Lin appears at the Kunlun Mountain Martial Arts Meet and erupts in a frenzy. How could anyone not submit?\u2019</p><br/><p>Many people saw this thread and were curious, wondering what was up with this Master Lin.</p><br/><p>But when they clicked the thread, they were completely dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>A three-hour long video which had not been edited at all. To these crazy martial arts fanatics, it wasn\u2019t dull at all to watch it from beginning to end in one go.</p><br/><p>And after this thread appeared, there were no replies within the first three hours.</p><br/><p>But after three hours, the thread completely blew up.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, is this real? This is way too domineering. Is this real or is it made using special effects?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt definitely wasn\u2019t made using special effects. It came from a certain broadcast. It\u2019s 100% genuine.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy God. This Master Lin is defying nature. He\u2019s so domineering.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCan any boss tell us how many styles of martial arts Master Lin displayed?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m known as someone who understands martial arts completely but I have to say that I only managed to understand sixty-seven styles of martial arts. As for the rest, I couldn\u2019t figure it out. But according to the report from that side, Master Lin displayed close to two hundred martial arts styles. It\u2019s several tens more than the number of styles authenticated by our country. How scary is that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI think this authentication was done in the eighties. Afterward, they stopped gathering information about this. I have to say that the country doesn\u2019t really value our martial arts.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAmazing. My blood is boiling after watching the video. I heard that Master Lin is the Shanghai association\u2019s Vice-President. I want to look for Master Lin and ask him to take me as his disciple.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c^Don\u2019t be absurd. Master Lin doesn\u2019t take disciples.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t take disciples? My net worth is a few hundred million. I\u2019ll give him half of my wealth and ask him to take me as his disciple. Do you think it would be a problem?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha. I\u2019m not looking down on you but even if you place all your wealth in front of Master Lin, I\u2019ll take it as my loss if you can get Master Lin to even glance at you. I think you should just go to sleep. Stop bragging.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. You don\u2019t even know Master Lin\u2019s identity and you\u2019re bragging to us over here. Go and do some research.\u201d</p><br/><p>To them, Master Lin was a f*cking awesome character. He had opened a shop in Shanghai and that street had become a must-visit place in Shanghai. His capability was unmatched.</p><br/><p>To them, if Master Lin was willing, there would probably be countless people who would invest in his business.</p><br/><p>And this guy was thinking of becoming Master Lin\u2019s disciple by offering half of his wealth. That was simply a dream.</p><br/><p>Shanghai Satellite TV Network\u2019s Chief.</p><br/><p>\u201cKunlun Mountain Martial Arts Meet. This has a great selling point.\u201d He had an idea. If it could succeed, perhaps he would be able to reach a new peak in viewership.</p><br/><p>However, he still couldn\u2019t figure it out yet. He had to think it through properly.</p><br/><p>When that happens, if he could invite Master Lin over, their viewership would be guaranteed.</p><br/><p><em>I have to plan it out properly.</em></p></div>\n</div>"}

He looked at Zhao Xuan as if he didn\u2019t believe him. \u201cYou have a plan?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ma Shao Hao really didn\u2019t believe that Zhao Xuan had a plan. After all, this was an outsider. What kind of plan could he have?</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course I do,\u201d said Zhao Xuan with a smile as his chest puffed up. \u201cSince Young Master Ma is facing a problem, I, Zhao Xuan, cannot sit idly by.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ma Shao Hao saw Zhao Xuan\u2019s confident attitude and became a little intrigued. \u201cTell me. What\u2019s your plan?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Xuan smiled. \u201cWe use our brains to make a living. This kind of manual work definitely has to be left to other people.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, so you want to look for the local mafias. Don\u2019t even think about it. They\u2019re all gutless.\u201d Ma Shao Hao had thought that it was some kind of brilliant plan but it turned out to be what he had already tried. No one from Haojiang would dare to mess with the Yun Family unless they ate a leopard\u2019s guts.</p><br/><p>Moreover, this Yun Xue Yao managed a casino herself. She definitely had thugs of her own.</p><br/><p>Zhao Xuan said, \u201cYoung Master Ma, I think you\u2019re mistaken. I\u2019m not talking about that. Those people you were thinking of calling aren\u2019t even worth mentioning. They can\u2019t be compared to what I have in mind.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean? Are you looking down on them?\u201d Ma Shao Hao felt that Zhao Xuan was bragging now. Those people were vicious criminals. When they made a move on someone, it was terrifying.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m looking down on them. How many people can one of them fight? The people I\u2019m calling can fight ten people each. They\u2019re all skillful experts. And that\u2019s just if they\u2019re bare-fisted. If they use weapons, just ten of them will be enough to overwhelm all those mafia people that Young Master Ma tried to call.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey are true experts and trained in Kung Fu. What do you say?\u201d asked Zhao Xuan with a grin.</p><br/><p>When Ma Shao Hao heard that, he was stunned. \u201cYoung Master Zhao, they seem really incredible. But are they not afraid of the Yun Family?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha. They wouldn\u2019t be afraid of such things. It\u2019s perfect that I know this bunch of people and I even have a collaboration with them. In the future, when Young Master Ma and I work together, they will ensure our safety. That\u2019s definitely not a problem,\u201d said Zhao Xuan.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright. If it\u2019s like that, it would be amazing. I didn\u2019t expect Young Master Zhao to have such a trick up your sleeve. I have to see it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ma Shao Hao was immensely grateful. He hadn\u2019t expected Zhao Xuan to know such people. If that was really true, he could already imagine what would become of those guys in the restaurant.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright. It\u2019s just a matter of a phone call. Young Master Ma won\u2019t even have to be around. You can just watch from afar and see how I avenge you,\u201d said Zhao Xuan.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright. If you can help me to take out my rage, I can assure you that I, Ma Shao Hao, will never let you down in the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>In the restaurant.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan and the rest were chatting happily. They had already forgotten the incident from before.</p><br/><p>However, Jin Meng was the only one still wondering where Ma Shao Hao had gone. <em>It doesn\u2019t make sense. Based on that guy\u2019s temper, even if he can\u2019t find reinforcements, he would still come up with some kind of trick.</em></p><br/><p>She wouldn\u2019t believe that this Ma Shao Hao would just let it be.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Lin, is the food alright?\u201d asked Yun Xue Yao with a bright smile. What happened previously had enraged her. But her best friend had told her that she had to be gentle. Men like gentle women and they don\u2019t like women to be too headstrong.</p><br/><p>She was very headstrong at work but she made herself gentle in front of Brother Lin. However, what happened just now had really made her furious.</p><br/><p>If her best friend hadn\u2019t kept her in check, she would have flared up.</p><br/><p>\u201cMmm, it\u2019s very good. The food tastes good. Actually, the food in Haojiang is really pretty good.\u201d Lin Fan smiled. Then, he pointed at Fraud Tian and Zhao Zhong Yang. \u201cJust by looking at those two, you can tell how delicious the food is.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian\u2019s mouth was covered with grease. He was eating non-stop and he wasn\u2019t slowing down. It was as if he hadn\u2019t eaten in a long time.</p><br/><p>\u201cMmm. It\u2019s really pretty good. It\u2019s delicious! Xue Yao, I\u2019m really satisfied with this restaurant that you brought us to.\u201d Fraud Tian was filled with delight.</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang nodded as well. The food did indeed taste very good.</p><br/><p>Seeing how everyone was satisfied, Yun Xue Yao smiled cheerfully. She had been under a lot of pressure because she was afraid that they wouldn\u2019t like this place. But seeing how satisfied they were, she couldn\u2019t help but smile happily.</p><br/><p>Suddenly!</p><br/><p>A bunch of people started walking over and they found a place to sit down.</p><br/><p>\u201cBeautiful ladies, let me get to know you.\u201d Zhao Xuan brought the people in and sat at the nearby table. Then, he called out to the ladies at Lin Fan\u2019s table.</p><br/><p>On his handsome face, he let out a very narcissistic grin.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho the heck would want to get to know you?\u201d Jin Meng lashed out. She felt that this person was retarded.</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang looked over at him.</p><br/><p>But with one look, Zhao Xuan instantly threw the plate from his table to the ground. \u201cWhat are you looking at? What the f*ck are you looking at?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ma Shao Hao, who was hiding away at a table far away, saw this and his blood boiled. It was a f*cking domineering show. He felt that this Zhao Xuan was really awesome. Throwing a plate out of nowhere really was f*cking awesome.</p><br/><p>Working with someone like that was a pretty wise choice.</p><br/><p>In the future, he would be able to mess with whoever he wanted.</p><br/><p>When the plate crashed into the ground, it shattered into pieces.</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang furrowed his brows and muttered, \u201cRetard.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did you say? I\u2019m asking you what you just said!\u201d Zhao Xuan was here to cause trouble. He tried to create a conflict out of every small matter.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was a little displeased. <em>What the heck is wrong with today? Troublesome people just come one after another. This sucks.</em></p><br/><p>Jin Meng stood up. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you? Who do you think you are? Do you think Haojiang is a place where a wretched-looking tramp like you can act however you like?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe. The beautiful lady is angry. Alright then. Today, let me see if those two guys and that old man can protect you. Get them,\u201d Zhao Xuan ordered his men to attack.</p><br/><p>Ma Shao Hao was stunned. <em>This is too f*cking incredible, isn\u2019t it? This is nature-defying! </em>It seemed as if Zhao Xuan was just picking a fight for no reason. But he was eagerly waiting for the opposite party to be beaten up.</p><br/><p>He already knew that the people that Zhao Xuan had brought were not just simple people. They were all skilled in Kung Fu and they were very powerful. It seemed that that group of guys was done for, especially that Master Lin.</p><br/><p>Once Master Lin goes on the ground, he would go and give him a beating. The thought of that made him very excited.</p><br/><p>*Bam!*</p><br/><p>*Bam!*</p><br/><p>The people that Zhao Xuan had brought each slammed the table, causing a loud rumbling noise. Then, they stood up and started walking over.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan took a deep breath and turned his head over. \u201cAre you all retarded?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Xuan pointed his finger. \u201cBeat them up!\u201d</p><br/><p>But suddenly, those experts were stunned upon taking a look at Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Then, Zhao Xuan was a little curious. <em>Why aren\u2019t they attacking? </em>He yelled, \u201cWhat are you all doing? Why aren\u2019t you attacking them?\u201d</p><br/><p>But what happened next made Zhao Xuan completely dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>Those experts that Zhao Xuan had called looked at Lin Fan and said respectfully.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, it\u2019s you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded. \u201cYes, it\u2019s me. What are you trying to do?\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

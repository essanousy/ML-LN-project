When he saw that there were just a few kilometers left, he started to get nervous.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it? Are you still a little nervous?\u201d Lin Fan said with a laugh. It was an influenza after all. If they don\u2019t manage to cure it, they would get infected as well. Hence, whenever a big influenza appeared in a place, the first line of medical personnel to charge in were all very brave.</p><br/><p>After all, just because one was a doctor didn\u2019t mean that he or she wouldn\u2019t get infected.</p><br/><p>\u201cA little bit. But it\u2019s fine,\u201d replied Zhao Ming Qing.</p><br/><p>Even after studying Chinese medicine for so many years, he had never come across such an experience. After all, it was Chinese medicine. Whenever a major problem popped up, he definitely wouldn\u2019t be the one to research it.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan patted Zhao Ming Qing\u2019s shoulder. \u201cRelax. With me around, it will be fine. This influenza is actually nothing much.\u201d</p><br/><p>This wasn\u2019t just bragging. He really believed that. After all, with his current abilities, if he had to panic over a small thing like an influenza, he would just find a hole to bury himself.</p><br/><p>Leukemia was difficult to cure. People had researched it for decades but still couldn\u2019t completely conquer it. On the other hand, influenzas would only catch people unprepared. In the end, after a period of time, people were sure to be able to resolve it.</p><br/><p>Hence, the only difficult part about the influenza was that it was foreign.</p><br/><p>If anyone else had said that, Zhao Ming Qing wouldn\u2019t believe it. But these words had come from his teacher\u2019s mouth. Hence, he had unwavering faith in those words.</p><br/><p>Very soon, they reached the scene.</p><br/><p>Li Chong was the Commander of this quarantine operation. When he saw a car slowly approaching from the distance, he quickly stuck out his arm and gestured for them to turn back.</p><br/><p>But when he realized that they wouldn\u2019t leave, he frowned. <em>What are they trying to do?</em></p><br/><p><em>Could they be reporters?</em></p><br/><p><em>But that shouldn\u2019t be the case. Which reporter would dare to come here now? Is getting the news more important than their lives?</em></p><br/><p>When Li Chong saw an old man come out of the car, he was confused. He had no idea what this old man wanted. \u201cMister, you can\u2019t go in here. Please go back.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing said, \u201cI\u2019m a Chinese doctor. My teacher and I are here to look at the situation of the influenza.</p><br/><p>When Li Chong heard that, he was immediately touched. At the same time, he really admired them.</p><br/><p>After all, everyone was quick to avoid this influenza. Now that such an old man had come with his medicine box to see the sick, he couldn\u2019t help but be touched and shocked.</p><br/><p>But the current situation wasn\u2019t one that could be resolved with Chinese medicine.</p><br/><p>\u201cMister, you have a goodwill but the government has already formed a specialist team that is tackling the influenza now. So there\u2019s no need for this. Go back,\u201d said Li Chong.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing waved his hand. \u201cNo. My teacher and I came from far away just to resolve this. How can we go back?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Chong was taken aback. He hadn\u2019t expected this old man to have come with his teacher. It seemed that it would be another old man. This situation put him in a tough spot.</p><br/><p>Then, Lin Fan came out from the car and walked towards Li Chong. \u201cHello, I\u2019m Lin Fan. We came from Shanghai to look at the situation here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Zhong was about to open his mouth but when he saw the opposite party\u2019s face, he was startled and speechless. After a long silence, he finally regained his senses.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you Master Lin?\u201d Li Chong had heard of Master Lin before but he had never been like those fans who chased their idols crazily. However, when something like this happened, his heart was filled with anxiety. After all, he hadn\u2019t received any updates in a long time and he had no idea when this influenza would be conquered.</p><br/><p>Then, he started to think. <em>Can </em>the Master <em>Lin who cured leukemia also cure this influenza?</em></p><br/><p>\u201cMmm, I am.\u201d Lin Fan smiled. In his heart, he was mumbling to himself. <em>Looks like I\u2019m quite famous. Even in this kind of small place, there\u2019s someone who knows me.</em></p><br/><p>Actually, if he had only received the Nobel Prize or cured leukemia, no one would know who he was.</p><br/><p>The main thing was that he was in the headlines every day. Anyone using their phones who paid even a bit of attention to the news would have seen him.</p><br/><p>For example, the important leaders of the country might not even be known by those who didn\u2019t pay attention to the news. If you asked those forty or fifty-year-old men and women if they knew some of the celebrities on the Internet, they would be dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>They would have no idea who they were.</p><br/><p>But for Lin Fan to be known by the masses, it was because he had done many major things. Li Chong had noticed this and that was why he had recognized Lin Fan with one look.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, why did you come here?\u201d Li Chong was forty-something and close to fifty but he was still young at heart. He liked to follow the news on the Internet. However, he knew that the government hadn\u2019t asked Master Lin for help.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuang Yun Town\u2019s Mayor says that he\u2019s my fan. He told me about the situation here. Since I saw that my fan was in trouble, how could I just sit still in Shanghai? That\u2019s why I immediately drove here,\u201d explained Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Li Chong was stunned. Then, he thought for a moment before saying, \u201cMaster Lin, Shanghai is close to 2 kilometers away from here. You just drove here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved his hand. \u201cLet\u2019s not talk about all this for now. What\u2019s the situation in Huang Yun Town.\u201d</p><br/><p>When he heard Master Lin ask about this, Li Chong\u2019s expression turned serious. \u201cThere are 10058 people in Huang Yun Town. There are now more than 3000 people infected. The remaining have mild influenza symptoms. This infection rate is very high but luckily, the Mayor has calmed the townspeople. Also, the townspeople are willing to cooperate with us. They\u2019ve stayed inside and haven\u2019t come out the whole time. If a conflict happens, we wouldn\u2019t be able to manage it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve all been infected?\u201d Zhao Ming Qing was taken aback and in disbelief. \u201cIt\u2019s only been a few days. This infection rate is too great, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, the infection rate is great indeed. It\u2019s very dangerous,\u201d said Li Chong. He felt that this infection rate was too great as well. Since when had there been such a powerful influenza? In just a few days, a whole town had been infected.</p><br/><p>Moreover, they had even had people go in to sterilize the place but the virus couldn\u2019t be exterminated. This showed that this virus was very strong and very resilient.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan thought for a moment before saying. \u201cAlright, enough talk. If we delay any further, who knows what will happen? Ming Qing, give me the equipment. I\u2019m going in to take a look.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, if you go in, what about me?\u201d Zhao Ming Qing was anxious. He had come all the way here as well. He couldn\u2019t just stay outside.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go in. If you get infected, who will handle the things at the end?\u201d said Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Li Chong said anxiously, \u201cMaster Lin, wait a moment. This isn\u2019t a joke. Once you go in, you won\u2019t be able to come out before there is a solution.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019m going in to resolve this. If I couldn\u2019t resolve this, why would I even be here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, enough talk. Ming Qing, wait outside. Keep in contact through the phone. If I need anything, you shall help me prepare them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing said, \u201cTeacher, I\u2019ll go in with you. With me around, at least you\u2019ll have an assistant.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved his hand. \u201cIt\u2019s really not needed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Chong said, \u201cMaster Lin, please wear a protective uniform.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need it. It\u2019ll affect my movements,\u201d said Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen wear a mask.\u201d Li Chong was a little stunned. He felt as if this Master Lin wasn\u2019t afraid at all.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. \u201cWhat\u2019s the use of a mask? The infection is so strong, it probably isn\u2019t reliant on saliva transmission.\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

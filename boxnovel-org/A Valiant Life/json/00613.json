I\u2019ve been waiting for a long time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAha,\u201d Liu Xiao Tian said as his blinked and scanned the surroundings. What was going on? Where was the vicious and evil kidnapper? Why was it just Master Lin seated here alone? Also, he looks very relaxed, contrary to what anyone expected.</p><br/><p>The special forces policemen came out of the place they were hiding in.</p><br/><p>They were prepared to have a huge firefight with the drug dealers but the scene was completely deserted. Not even a single drug dealer was in sight. Could the report have been wrong? Or was it because they knew the special forces were coming and they peed their pants and ran off, forgetting about \u2018Scorpion\u2019.</p><br/><p>Of course, this was just a thought they were playing around with. They did not think that highly of themselves.</p><br/><p>\u2018Scorpion\u2019, who was being escorted, had a meltdown.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere are my men?\u201d he said. \u2018Scorpion\u2019 could not believe his eyes. He had done so much preparation and yet right now there was no one in sight. Where were all his henchmen?</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian said in astonishment, \u201cMaster Lin, where are the drug dealers?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan put his cigarette out, swatted the dust away and then pointed towards the back and said, \u201cThey are there. You guys can go and detain them.\u201d</p><br/><p>The special forces team immediately went into action. When they entered the scene, they saw the situation inside and were all stunned. Their mouths were left open in shock.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow is this possible?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPinch me, I\u2019m dreaming.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOuch, why did you pinch me so hard?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe it either.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat in the world did this Master Lin do? There were so many drug dealers and he was alone. This\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Inside the warehouse.</p><br/><p>Tens of drug dealers were all tied up together. Their eyes were all wide open as they stared at the special forces officers.</p><br/><p>The special forces officers all looked at each other in dismay. \u201cThese drug dealers were captured just like that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLook at their legs, they look like they\u2019ve all been shot.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey really are shot. Who in the world did this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly.</p><br/><p>Everyone was in silence and then they looked behind in shock. They were all looking at the man, Master Lin, who was in conversation with Liu Xiao Tian. Then they said in disbelief, \u201cIt couldn\u2019t be that he was the one who did this right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust one person alone?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow did he even do it?\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, all these big and strong special forces officers were all in silence, thinking about the whole situation.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at \u2018Scorpion\u2019 and then laughed, \u201c\u2018Scorpion\u2019, don\u2019t even think about it. No matter what your friends do, your plan to escape has been foiled. You should just behave and return to your cell.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Scorpion\u2019 was still there in disbelief, \u201cHow can it be? How is this possible?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother!\u201d At this moment, Wang Ming Yang shouted at him as he rushed towards him. He hugged Lin Fan and then said, \u201cD*mn it. You really scared me to death. I beg you, don\u2019t do anything like this in the future, it will get people killed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cWhy so anxious? It\u2019s nothing. These guys are newbies and they still want to fight with me. These can\u2019t match up to my reputation, there is no way I\u2019ll die to them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian, who was standing by the side, said, \u201cMaster Lin, how did you do it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled and mysteriously said, \u201cGotta stay low-key. It\u2019s a long story and I will tell you when I have the chance.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian was also a little dumbfounded. He went in and looked around. He saw the drug dealers with gunshots to their legs and then all tied up together. To him, he could not see how this was possible. When dealing with these vicious and evil drug dealers, even if he could shoot them in the legs, it did not mean he could just capture them just like that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Just going by one man\u2019s strength and then capturing these drug dealers, that was something that was impossible. Even if it was a movie, it was still highly improbable.</p><br/><p>Qin Ju came over and when he got up to speed on the situation, was dumbfounded also. He did not know what happened but he knew that Master Lin was definitely involved. He gave him a thumbs up, telling him good job.</p><br/><p>Lu Li realized that he had avoided danger. Since he was the chairman of the Lu Corporation and they were in the presence of so many people, Lu Li was a different person and had steadied himself.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, I am really grateful to you this time for saving my life. I, Lu Li, am in debt to you and I will not forget this,\u201d Lu Li calmly said.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at him and said, \u201cHonestly speaking, I have no idea what you\u2019re saying.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Li was a little embarrassed. How could he not know what was going on? Then he whispered into Lin Fan\u2019s ear, saying, \u201cBrother Lin, give me some face. There are so many people here and I am the chairman of my family\u2019s company. This won\u2019t bode well like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed. This b*stard really knew how to act. But Lin Fan was indifferent to it.</p><br/><p>Then, the police started to get into action. The case had been solved and they had caught a group of international fugitives. This was something of national prestige but they could not post this in the newspaper. After this whole issue, Liu Xiao Tian also started to value Lin Fan\u2019s safety more.</p><br/><p>With things like this, it\u2019s better not to report in case people come for revenge.</p><br/><p>These drug dealers being shot in the legs. They were unable to walk and yet the police put them in handcuffs right away and then escorted them out.</p><br/><p>When Wu Wei passed by, Lin Fan stopped him and said, \u201cWait.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Wei did not know what was going on and was a little curious.</p><br/><p>Wu Wei was expressionless as he lifted his head and looked at Lin Fan. His eyes looked like they were crying out to Lin Fan, begging him.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan patted Wu Wei on the shoulders and said, \u201cI\u2019ll give you a chance. If you cooperate with the police and tell them everything you know, you can ask Qin Ju to handle the migration of your daughter over here to Shanghai and I will treat her illness.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Wei did not say a word but he gently nodded his head in agreement. Even though he was trying to hide his emotions, he was filled with hope now.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cQin Ju, this guy is going to cooperate with you and tell you everything he knows. However, he has a sick daughter in Myanmar. Think of a solution and bring her over so that I can treat her.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Ju nodded and said, \u201cOkay, no problem. If it is like this, it will really reduce our workload. These drug dealers are all tight-lipped so to get them to talk is not easy. But with this, it will definitely solve a lot of issues.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, how did you hit these drug dealers in the leg?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed and said, \u201cQin Ju, it\u2019s a secret. Don\u2019t bother asking further.\u201d</p><br/><p>Under normal circumstances, this went against their operating procedures. However, right now, even if it was against regulations, they had no choice. Lin Fan did not wish to talk so they did not have to make the situation completely clear.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cInspector Liu, I can\u2019t tell you anything else about what I did.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian gave Lin Fan a hard pat on the shoulder and said, \u201cWhat are you saying? You are safe and that\u2019s all that matters. Don\u2019t try to be so brave next time. These drug dealers are killers and they won\u2019t bat an eye when they kill you. If anything were to happen to you, it will be disastrous.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded and said, \u201cRelax. There won\u2019t be next time. If there is nothing else, I\u2019m going to go first. I\u2019m afraid the people of Cloud Street are worried sick about me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYea.\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

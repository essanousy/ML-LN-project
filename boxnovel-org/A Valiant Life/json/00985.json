This was something that not many people could afford to buy, especially since the land was very expensive here. Unless he was extremely wealthy, for a Chinese doctor to buy one of these, he had to have extremely great medical prowess.</p><br/><p>However, the owner of this villa, although it was a Chinese doctor, did not have great medical skills. Especially under the shroud of the Western doctors of today, him affording this villa was definitely not possible.</p><br/><p>Inside an old-fashioned study room.</p><br/><p>Zhang Guo Shou was seated in the room. His old fingers nimbly navigated the mouse of the computer as he studied the situation online. As he read on, he could not help but have a smile on his face.</p><br/><p>Zhang Han, who was next to him, was very excited as well. \u201cDad, I\u2019ve already done everything according to your idea. Also, the public relations branch has also gone into action. Let\u2019s see how long he\u2019ll be able to hold up this time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Guo Shou nodded in satisfaction, \u201cYes, this rascal really thinks too highly of himself. He just got appointed the Chairman of the Association and yet he thinks that he can do anything that he wants. He is really living a fantasy. Those words that he said on impulse have implicated so many people. Did he really think that he could get away without anything happening to him?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Han said, \u201cDad, the only problem is that the people who initially wanted to leave the Association have all been scared by this rascal. They are all just observing the situation and they don\u2019t dare to stand up.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThese people, sigh\u2026\u201d Zhang Guo Shou felt a little resentful. \u201cThey\u2019ve all been scared by a young man, just thinking about protecting themselves. They did not even question, if they allow this rascal to carry on with the reform that he has planned, what will they have left to protect in the future?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Han nodded. \u201cDad, why don\u2019t we go talk to them and ask them to come out. Right now, with this post, that rascal must be getting flamed online. The netizens don\u2019t care about the person anymore, they just care about the situation. As long as we put the situation in a way that makes us look good, they will definitely agree with us.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Zhang Guo Shou thought about it for a moment. \u201cGo. Let them know. I don\u2019t think we will be able to handle this situation by ourselves. If we can get them to all stand up, we can blow this situation up and just remove this rascal from power.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Han was an expert in this sort of matters so he got to work right away.</p><br/><p>These association members were all seated on the fence. They all wanted to see which side was winning before they picked a side. Although this was something disgraceful, with the given situation, if they did not have the support of the people, they would not be able to deal with it.</p><br/><p>Cloud Street!</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was not feeling too good inside. This old b*stard was really too good at jumping back into the fight. Initially, Lin Fan had thought that he had completely defeated the old man and that he did not have to care about him anymore.</p><br/><p>But, unexpectedly, this old b*stard was quick to get back on his horse and had even whipped out his bayonet, ready to duel with him.</p><br/><p>This made him feel a little helpless.</p><br/><p>It left him utterly speechless.</p><br/><p>At the shop.</p><br/><p>The townsfolk had still come to queue up. When Lin Fan saw this, he decided to not think about this situation for now. Right now, the most important thing for him was to get the scallion pancakes done properly.</p><br/><p>He was going to wait till he finished his work before going back to entertain Zhang Guo Shou and utterly destroy him.</p><br/><p>A middle-aged man who was standing in the queue asked, \u201cLittle Boss, do you not care about what happened online?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was expertly making the scallion pancakes and did not even lift his head. \u201cCare about what? He can do whatever he wants.\u201d</p><br/><p>It seemed like the middle-aged man suddenly remembered something as he said, \u201cLittle Boss, I will definitely believe in you. Those people online are crazy. They do not bother to find out what really happened before flaming others. They are truly keyboard warriors.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha,\u201d Lin Fan laughed. \u201cYou have a point. For your kind words, I\u2019ll make your scallion pancake slightly bigger than the others.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great!\u201d The middle-aged man had not thought that things would turn out this way. It made him very happy.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian was at the side shaking his head. He could not believe what was going on. \u201cHow do you think the kid is staying so calm and collected? The people on the internet are all flaming him and yet he hasn\u2019t stepped forth to explain things.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang had a lot of faith in Lin Fan. He shot Fraud Tian a look and did not understand why he did not get it.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Lin is just full of confidence. He doesn\u2019t care about these types of people who just jump from roof to roof. Thus, he can stay so calm and just focus on making the scallion pancakes, get it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian looked at Zhao Zhong Yang, slightly despising him. \u201cYou\u2019re just kissing his a*s. How about you go online and see how badly he is being scolded?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThose are just trolls. With what Brother Lin has done, many true fans can bear to scold him?</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan had been staring at her phone all this while, her fingers constantly tapping on her screen.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou Lan, what are you doing?\u201d Fraud Tian curiously asked.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan did not even bother to raise her head. \u201cI\u2019m trying to speak up for Brother Lin by arguing against these people.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHeh!\u201d Zhao Zhong Yang laughed. \u201cI think you shouldn\u2019t try and find trouble. When these trolls get riled up, they are extremely frightening. You should just ignore them.\u201d</p><br/><p>After a while, the scallion pancakes had all been sold.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan spoke to himself, \u201cToo much. This is really too much. This old man does not know the limit. I wanted to give him some face at first but after this, I\u2019m not going to give him any face at all.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Zhao Zhong Yang was stunned. \u201cBrother Lin, you\u2019re ready to fire back?\u201d</p><br/><p>This was totally contrary to what he had thought. Brother Lin was such a high and mighty person, yet, he was actually going to personally fight back again him. It was something very scary.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow can I not fight back? I don\u2019t know what in the world the Chief of my Intenet trolls is doing. I don\u2019t know what I pay him for. I haven\u2019t seen him all day,\u201d Lin Fan scolded. With regards to that Autumn Sword Fish Killer, Lin Fan was truly dissatisfied. His productivity was really too low.</p><br/><p>The situation online had already escalated to such an extent and yet he was nowhere to be found. It seemed like he did not want his job.</p><br/><p>In a certain small apartment.</p><br/><p>Autumn Sword Fish Killer looked at his brand new computer. He was very elated. He put on his headphones and lit his cigarette before giving his fat body a shake and wiping his mucus with his palm.</p><br/><p>Then, he vulgarly screamed, \u201cMy brothers, watch how I use my S-shaped movements and avoid this hail of bullets. It\u2019s a piece of cake.\u201d</p><br/><p>Right now, his life was going pretty well. He had already found a new job and a new exciting game had come out.</p><br/><p>PUBG.</p><br/><p>100 people would be thrown into an arena and only one of them would survive.</p><br/><p>When he played it for the first time, he had managed to kill 30 people, making him feel like he was unbeatable.</p><br/><p>After that, he even started live-streaming. For reasons unknown to even the audiences themselves, they were drawn in by his sheer skill and power in the game and he had obtained a pretty large following.</p><br/><p>There were even days where he would get a thousand dollars in donations. Far more than he was earning as an Internet troll.</p><br/><p>As for whether he would be able to keep doing this long-term, he did not really care. In the worst case scenario, he could just go back to being an Internet troll. Right now, he just wanted to see how much money he could earn from this.</p><br/><p>As for his boss getting flamed by other trolls online, he was helpless. He had changed professions already and did not want to work in that field anymore. He was prepared to just let his boss get flamed. At the same time, he could let his boss understand something.</p><br/><p><em>You can\u2019t live without me.</em></p></div>\n</div>"}

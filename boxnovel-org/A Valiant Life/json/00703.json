Director Huang had developed a deep bond with the children and every time a child left, she always reacted reluctantly. But now that the relatives are here, there wasn\u2019t much that she could do.</p><br/><p>Was it possible to reject them?</p><br/><p>For the child and their relatives, this wasn\u2019t fair. There were more children in the orphanage and although the children were cared for, they couldn\u2019t possibly dote on every single one of the children. If they let the children go home with their relatives and let them experience the love of a family, it would be much better than leaving the child in the Children\u2019s Welfare Institute. Furthermore, the child would receive a much better education outside.</p><br/><p>\u201cLil\u2019 Fatty, come over,\u201d Director Huang motioned him over.</p><br/><p>Lil\u2019 Fatty was helping a girl dig a hole and didn\u2019t know what was going on. When he heard his name being called, he took his spade and ran over. He looked at the two people standing outside at the gate, his head full of question marks.</p><br/><p>Who on earth were those people?</p><br/><p>\u201cWe really look alike. Although we haven\u2019t seen him for ages, he looks a lot like when he was younger,\u201d Qiu Yan Lan said, looking at Lil\u2019 Fatty. Thereafter, she extended her hands, wanting to pat him on his head.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Lil\u2019 Fatty withdrew, hiding behind Director Huang.</p><br/><p>Qiu Yan Lan withdrew her hands awkwardly, thereafter chuckling. \u201cYang Yang, I am your aunt, and this is your uncle. We are here to adopt you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Cheng Shan was full of anticipation. This child was his last hope of finding a cure. As long as he brought him to the hospital to check for bone marrow compatibility and if it was indeed compatible, he could finally have a shot a curing his leukemia.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t have a single space in his heart for his nephew. All he cared about was his health.</p><br/><p>Lil\u2019 Fatty didn\u2019t know who the two people were but after hearing that he was going to leave the Children\u2019s Welfare Institute, he immediately burst out in tears.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis place is my home! I don\u2019t want to leave! Grandma Huang, I don\u2019t want to leave,\u201d Lil\u2019 Fatty said, wrapping his arms around Director Huang, refusing to be moved.</p><br/><p>Director Huang patted Lil\u2019 Fatty on his heads, consoling him, \u201cLil\u2019 Fatty, your Aunt and Uncle are here to look for you. You will have a better home from now on. If you ever miss us, you can come visit us next time when you have grown up.\u201d</p><br/><p>She couldn\u2019t bear the thought of letting Lil\u2019 Fatty leave, but for his good, she had to do it.</p><br/><p>From her point of view, one of them was his Uncle and one his Aunt. Lil\u2019 Fatty was his brother\u2019s child, which was as good as his own.</p><br/><p>Wang Cheng Shan had only one motive, and that was to bring Lil\u2019 Fatty away. How could he let Lil\u2019 Fatty stay at an orphanage? Thereafter, he let out a huge smile. \u201cYang Yang, I am your Uncle. Come home with me and Aunt. I will buy you any toy you want and I\u2019ll buy you all the food you want. From now on, you will be to me like my son. We are, after all, blood relatives.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lil\u2019 Fatty continued crying, shaking his head. \u201cI\u2019m not leaving. I don\u2019t want to! I want to stay here with Grandma Huang and Uncle Lin, and Uncle Han Lu. I\u2019m not going to leave. Grandma Huang, you won\u2019t let me go, will you? I promise not to be naughty from today onwards. I\u2019ll listen to everything that you say!\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Huang was a little teary after hearing what Lil\u2019 Fatty said. \u201cLil\u2019 Fatty, listen to Grandma. These are your relatives. If you ever miss me or Uncle Lin and Uncle Han Lu, you can come back to pay us a visit.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qiu Yan Lan face looked sympathetic. \u201cYang Yang, Aunt can bring you over occasionally to pay a visit next time if you miss them so much.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lil\u2019 Fatty shook his head, before running to Lin Fan\u2019s side, hugging his thigh. \u201cUncle Lin, I don\u2019t want to leave this place. Help me, please? Lil\u2019 Fatty doesn\u2019t want to leave! I won\u2019t eat so much next time and I won\u2019t bully the other kids from now on. I\u2019ll be a good boy from now on, just don\u2019t make me leave this place!\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking at Lil\u2019 Fatty react this way, Lin Fan couldn\u2019t help but feel helpless.</p><br/><p>Looking at the situation, he had to say something. He definitely couldn\u2019t bear to let Lil\u2019 Fatty leave, but if the other party really sincerely were going to adopt and love Lil\u2019 Fatty, he had to do what was good for Lil\u2019 Fatty and let him go. He looked at the couple standing in front of him- although their identities were innocent, they didn\u2019t give him a good feeling.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan kept silent, thinking and calculating what to say.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou guys are Lil\u2019 Fatty\u2019s Aunt and Uncle, right?\u201d Lin Fan asked.</p><br/><p>Qiu Yan Lan nodded her head. \u201cThat\u2019s right. We are Yang Yang\u2019s Aunt and Uncle, and we are really excited to be able to have him be part of our family. I really am grateful for you guys, to have taken care of him so much till now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved them away, saying coldly, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to thank us. Lil\u2019 Fatty is really a likable child and is one of us here. However, I remember a few months back that the police had already sent a notice after he had been rescued from the human traffickers. Chief Liu had mentioned to me before that Lil\u2019 Fatty\u2019s father had passed away in a car accident and the mother had remarried and moved away. As his Aunt and Uncle, why didn\u2019t you come then to adopt him? Why now? If you don\u2019t give me a satisfactory answer, I won\u2019t let you guys take him away.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qiu Yan Lan was stunned, not knowing how to answer.</p><br/><p>Could it be possible for her to say that they had never wanted to adopt Lil\u2019 Fatty, and they only wanted to do it now because her husband had been diagnosed with leukemia and needed a bone marrow transplant? Her husband needed a donor and Lil\u2019 Fatty was the closest relative that he had.</p><br/><p>If she had said that, their chances of bringing Lil\u2019 Fatty away would be dashed.</p><br/><p>Wang Cheng Shan stepped forward. \u201cCan I ask who you are?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI am one of the in-charge over here. I was also the one who rescued him from the human traffickers. Although you guys may have gotten through the background checks by the police, you still have to pass mine. Don\u2019t think that you can just bring this child away like that without getting an interview.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe are his Uncle and Aunt, what do you have to be afraid of?\u201d Wang Cheng Shan asked.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved them away. \u201cEven fathers and mothers can be unreliable and abusive. We have to make sure he is going to a good family.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Wang Cheng Shan was getting a little angry, but he had to suppress it. Thereafter, he looked at the police officer, \u201cOfficer, what do you think?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy job is just to help with the investigation and to bring you over. Whatever happens after is your responsibility,\u201d the police officer said.</p><br/><p>In actual fact, he knew who Master Lin was and he knew that he was a righteous and just man. Looking at the current situation, he knew that Master Lin would be able to make the proper judgments.</p><br/><p>So, he decided not to interfere, and instead sit at a corner to watch Master Lin do his thing.</p><br/><p>\u201cSir, we are Yang Yang\u2019s relatives. His father passed away early and his mother moved away. As his relatives, we naturally want to give him the best environment and education, and so we hope that you can let Yang Yang leave with us,\u201d Qiu Yan Lan said.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan didn\u2019t pay attention to Qiu Yan Lan, and instead, continued to look at Wang Cheng Shan. \u201cFrom what I can see, you have an illness and it\u2019s leukemia. Although it\u2019s still in its early stages, if you don\u2019t find a donor soon, you\u2019ll just be waiting for death. If I did guess wrong, don\u2019t be mad, but you had received a notice a few months ago to adopt Lil\u2019 Fatty, but you guys ignored it because you guys didn\u2019t want to adopt him at all. You guys are probably only here now because you found out that you had leukemia and your late brother\u2019s son was probably going to be the best chance that you were going to have at a bone marrow match. You want a bone marrow transplant from him, am I right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Once Lin Fan said that, everyone was shocked.</p><br/><p>The police officer looked at the couple.</p><br/><p>Han Lu didn\u2019t dare to say anything.</p><br/><p>Director Huang was stunned, her heart full of terror and panic. She didn\u2019t doubt what Master Lin had said, but she just never thought that the couple would come here with such intentions.</p><br/><p>This situation was unheard of and unseen of. How could there be relatives like that?</p><br/><p>If what Master Lin said was true, the couple were truly brutes.</p><br/><p>Wang Cheng Shan was in a daze. He didn\u2019t know how Lin Fan could read him so well, as if he could read minds. However, he would never reveal the truth.</p><br/><p>Just at that moment, he raised his voice. \u201cWhat on earth are you talking about? I am his Uncle! His blood relative! How could I dare to do that? I\u2019ll tell you, we must bring Yang Yang back home, and if you are going to stop us, we will sue you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGo ahead do it however you like,\u201d Lin Fan said. Thereafter, he turned to the police officer. \u201cOfficer, I feel that we should conduct an investigation on this, so we can\u2019t just let them take away the child like that.\u201d</p><br/><p>The police officer nodded his head, as he started to become more suspicious of the couple. \u201cAlright, this is a huge thing and we have to handle this properly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo way. We are his relatives and you have no rights to stop us from bringing him away,\u201d Wang Cheng Shan said, his face green with rage. He never thought that things would develop like that.</p><br/><p>Just that the other person guessed so accurately. He could even tell what sickness he had.</p><br/><p>Could it be that Lin Fan had already done his own background checks on him before?</p><br/><p>That couldn\u2019t be right, he had never met this person in his entire life.</p><br/><p>What he didn\u2019t know was that the young person standing in front of him right now was not only a master fortune-teller, but also a Godly Doctor.</p><br/><p>He could just take a look at him and guess everything about him in excruciating detail.</p></div>\n</div>"}

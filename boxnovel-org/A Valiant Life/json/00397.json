He actually had a disciple and it was going to help him to grow as a person.</p><br/><p>However, the outfit that he had worn yesterday didn't suit him at all. It was too mature and he was only in his twenties. He was filled with vitality and he was a cocky man. However, he couldn't be too cocky or he might get beaten up.</p><br/><p>People would also curse him.</p><br/><p>He washed up and changed before heading to Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>His life was carefree but he kept thinking about the tenth task of the Encyclopedia. It was so difficult to complete. It looked like he had to be determined and think of ways to complete it.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian said, \"There are more people by the day. Do you think we should increase the daily limit of the scallion pancakes?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan sat there and replied calmly, \"Nope, we'll stay at ten pieces.\"</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian shook his head helplessly. \"You're missing out on the money.\"</p><br/><p>As of today, Lin Fan's main job wasn't a scallion pancake seller anymore. However, for Cloud Street, if Master Lin didn't sell scallion pancakes, the lively atmosphere would be gone. He couldn't just stop selling the scallion pancakes.</p><br/><p>In front of his shop.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan finished making the last scallion pancake. Then, he frowned at the man in front of him.</p><br/><p>\"Little Boss, is there something wrong with me?\" The middle-aged man was stunned. It was as if he was being attacked by the invasive look.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at him. \"Nothing much. I think your health might be at risk. You should see a doctor.\"</p><br/><p>The middle-aged man said, \"Little Boss, I'm healthy as heck. How can I have a problem?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shook his head. \"Look at this scallion pancake. The underside is in contact with the wok and the top won't get burnt. However, if I leave it long enough, the top part will get cooked too. When you're sick, you won't be able to feel it. But when you feel it, it will be too late. Trust me and go to the hospital. Anyway, you're already so old and you should go for yearly check-ups.\"</p><br/><p>The middle-aged man nodded. \"Alright. Since Little Boss suggested it, I'll go for a checkup when I'm free.\"</p><br/><p>\"Here, your scallion pancake is done.\" Lin Fan could tell about anyone just by looking at his or her face. He could tell any unusual situation. After all, these customers were old customers. Since he had seen it, giving him a heads up was the right thing to do.</p><br/><p>After he finished making the scallion pancakes, Lin Fan just lay down there and looked at different classifications in the Encyclopedia. He wanted to redeem some useful classifications using his Encyclopedic Points to teach the kids at Nanshan Children's Welfare Institute.</p><br/><p>But what did kids like?</p><br/><p>Drawing? Writing? Etc\u2026</p><br/><p>He had to consider everything, as the kids' interest had to be developed since young. It was an important task. However, there was something more important. He had to hire teachers for the institute and build classrooms.</p><br/><p>Those weren't problems at all. The main problem was to hire good and willing teachers. Usually, not many people would be willing to work as a teacher in a welfare institute. Firstly, would the teachers get a permanent post? Secondly, would they even earn enough to get sufficient funds for retirement if they were to work there for a lifetime?</p><br/><p>However, the kids were still small and hiring children's teachers wouldn't be a problem. He could worry about it again in the future when the kids have grown older.</p><br/><p>The moment he thought of it, he wanted to proceed with his idea.</p><br/><p>After thinking for a while, Lin Fan decided to teach the children drawing.</p><br/><p>Obviously, the kids had to learn traditional Chinese drawings.</p><br/><p>But when he looked at the classification, he was shocked by the points needed.</p><br/><p>Chinese art was a small classification. It had various types of drawing within it but it required 150 Encyclopedic Points.</p><br/><p>It was going to use up all his Encyclopedic Points.</p><br/><p>However, it was worth it to spend on education.</p><br/><p>He decided to go for it.</p><br/><p>\"Using 150 encyclopedic points to exchange for the Chinese Art classification.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan closed his eyes and his fingers twitched a little. Then, he acted normal again. He opened his eyes and smiled.</p><br/><p>\"Zhao Zhong Yang, drive me to buy some stuff,\" Lin Fan stood up and said. He didn't even hesitate about it at all.</p><br/><p>\"What are you going to buy?\" Zhao Zhong Yang asked curiously.</p><br/><p>\"Drawing tools to be sent to the Children's Welfare Institute.\" Lin Fan chuckled. He couldn't wait to teach them.</p><br/><p>They went shopping for the whole morning and the car was filled with drawing tools. Zhao Zhong Yang was stunned. It was too insane. What was he trying to do?</p><br/><p>When they reached Nanshan Children's Welfare Institute, Director Huang was also stunned when she saw them. She was in disbelief after finding out that Master Lin was going to teach art.</p><br/><p>But as she thought of it, she thought that he wanted the kids to just have a fun time. After all, this would help in their development. Drawing could help to calm them down and it would be of great help to these children.</p><br/><p>As for the 150 encyclopedic points, he wasn't bothered by it at all as he felt that he could earn it back.</p><br/><p>The next day!</p><br/><p>After finishing with work, Lin Fan brought Zhao Zhong Yang to Nanshan Children's Welfare Institute. Zhao Zhong Yang was young and lively and he could definitely be of great help.</p><br/><p>The previous day, Director Huang had given out the tools to each of the kids. Although they weren't good at protecting things, they took great care of their own belongings. Especially those that had been given to them, they protected those items with their lives. They were extremely happy when they heard that they were going to learn how to draw.</p><br/><p>In the Children's Welfare Institute building.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan stood on the podium and looked at the children below. The kids were gradually recovering but they still had to take their medicine regularly. Chinese medicine was said to be 30% poisonous but it could help the body recover. Everything was worth it and safe because they just had to consume it a few times.</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang took out his phone and stood on the podium too. Then, he streamed a broadcast, titled 'Master Lin teaches children how to draw'.</p><br/><p>The netizens in the broadcast room were stunned.</p><br/><p>\"D*mn, Master Lin is so talented. He's actually teaching the children how to draw. Judging by the tools, I think he's gonna teach Chinese art.\"</p><br/><p>\"That's amazing.\"</p><br/><p>\"Not bad, not bad. Chinese art should be introduced to kids at a young age. Although Master Lin's standards may not be that good, it should be sufficient to teach kids.\"</p><br/><p>\"^You sound like you're very good at art.\"</p><br/><p>\"Sorry about that, I'm an average old man. I'm just a member of the Chinese Art Association.\"</p><br/><p>\"D*mn, you sound even better now. What's your name?\"</p><br/><p>\"Tao Shi Gang.\"</p><br/><p>\"\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"I searched him up and he's really a master. D*mn, Brother Yang, quick, come and have a look. There's a master watching your broadcast.\"</p><br/><p>In a certain old-fashioned study room</p><br/><p>An elderly man was looking at the computer. He was preparing to draw but before that, he would watch live streams like the youngsters these days. He had always been watching Zhao Zhong Yang's broadcasts and he loved this lively fella. Then, Master Lin appeared which amazed him and therefore, he decided to continue watching his broadcasts</p><br/><p>He would only express his opinions when it had something to do with art. Usually, he wouldn't say anything. He would occasionally praise the youngsters.</p><br/><p>He felt that Master Lin didn't have much talent for drawing since it was a skill that required a lot of time. However, he was extremely supportive of him teaching it to the kids, especially since they were from the Nanshan Children's Welfare Institute.</p><br/><p>The old man that loves drawing: 'I've donated a rocket to show my support.'</p><br/><p>\"If I have the time, I will definitely go there to teach the kids the true meaning of art.\"</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang showed the phone to Lin Fan. Lin Fan smiled. \"Thank you, Master, for your rocket. If you have the time, I welcome you to Nanshan Children's Welfare Institute to teach these kids how to draw. It's going to be pretty embarrassing for me this time.\"</p><br/><p>The old man that loves drawing: 'It's okay. It's a good thing for a youngster to like drawing. I will show all my support. If you have any questions in the future, you can privately message me and I can explain it to you.'</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. \"Thank you.\"</p><br/><p>Then, the children cheered, \"Teacher, we want to draw!\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed. Although there were thirty children that were physically handicapped, they still had their hands and could participate in it. That way, they wouldn't feel so left out.</p><br/><p>\"Alright, I'll draw it once for you. Watch it closely, okay?\" Lin Fan chuckled.</p><br/><p>The children cheered, \"Okay!\"</p><br/><p>...</p><br/>\n</div>"}

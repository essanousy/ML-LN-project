After looking at the whole day\u2019s news, he saw that no one had discovered that the dog was Elder Dog, so he heaved a sigh of relief.</p><br/><p>But thinking about it, it made sense. There were so many mutts in the country and quite a number of them were white. How would anyone be able to find out?</p><br/><p>If they found out, Lin Fan would f*cking do a broadcast of himself eating sh*t.</p><br/><p>He brought Elder Dog home and bought some bones as he was preparing to improve Elder Dog\u2019s meals.</p><br/><p>As of now, Elder Dog was no longer a typical dog. The only thing he couldn\u2019t do was talk. Of course, Lin Fan had to prepare good meals for Elder Dog and strengthen his body even more.</p><br/><p>Elder Dog was close to tears. After enduring for so long, he had finally gained acknowledgment. Thinking about the past, those days were really too pitiful. He couldn\u2019t even eat scallion pancakes in the past.</p><br/><p>Now, his days were delightful.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan placed the bone that he had cooked into a bowl. \u201cEat up and grow stronger.\u201d</p><br/><p>The pork bone was releasing a brilliant fragrance that was difficult for Elder Dog to resist. He immediately hugged the bone and started eating it while puffing and blowing.</p><br/><p>The next day!</p><br/><p>Lin Fan brought Elder Dog and casually started the car, heading towards Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>In a certain rental apartment.</p><br/><p>A man had been awake through the night. He hadn\u2019t done anything else but look through his web history.</p><br/><p>He could have sworn that he had seen a similar photo before but nobody believed him.</p><br/><p>Looking at the comments under his post, there were thousands of them, all saying that he was just bragging and telling him to show the evidence.</p><br/><p>As someone who had never lied before, how could he let others falsely accuse him? Even if he didn\u2019t sleep, he had to find the evidence.</p><br/><p>Suddenly.</p><br/><p>The man\u2019s eyes lit up. His cursor swiftly clicked open the webpage. He had found the evidence.</p><br/><p>On the webpage.</p><br/><p>\u2018Mysterious mutt finds kidnapped children.\u2019</p><br/><p>At the same time, there was an image. On the image, a white colored mutt was standing there with its head raised, looking very proud.</p><br/><p>The man couldn\u2019t wait to post it on the Internet.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve found the evidence. See for yourselves. Don\u2019t they look very similar or even exactly the same? I told you I wasn\u2019t lying and I definitely wasn\u2019t lying.\u201d</p><br/><p>Indeed.</p><br/><p>Upon posting this image, netizens who had been paying attention to this matter were boiling with excitement.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn! They really look the same. It\u2019s as if they were carved out of the same mold.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWait a moment. I think this news is from a few months ago, am I right? It\u2019s that news about a large human-trafficking organization being destroyed. But before it was destroyed, a dog, leading many other dogs, had rescued the kidnapped children from an old residential building.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve found it. This is Master Lin\u2019s dog.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Master Lin\u2019s dog? Right, Master Lin seems to have such a dog. I\u2019ve seen Brother Yang\u2019s broadcasts and this dog is known as Elder Dog.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho\u2019s in Shanghai? Go and check if it\u2019s really Master Lin\u2019s dog.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck, this is nature-defying. But why didn\u2019t Master Lin say anything on Weibo?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI think Master Lin probably didn\u2019t dare to say it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>When the evidence was released, it immediately spread on the Internet.</p><br/><p>News agency.</p><br/><p>A reporter said, \u201cIt\u2019s been found. Netizens are saying that it\u2019s Master Lin\u2019s dog. This is an article from last time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, they\u2019re really right. Why didn\u2019t we think of this? Hurry up and go down to Cloud Street to interview him. I\u2019m afraid that quite a number of people already know about it by now.\u201d</p><br/><p>At Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was sitting there leisurely. Wu You Lan and the rest had gradually stopped caring about that incident. It had already passed, what was the point of thinking about it so much?</p><br/><p>In these one or two days, Elder Dog had been going out frequently. He only did not go out today. It was the first time.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan now understood that whenever Elder Dog went out, it was to do a good deed. That \u2018Righteous Pet Food\u2019 was really not simple.</p><br/><p>Suddenly!</p><br/><p>Elder Dog stood up and looked into the distance.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan realized that there was some noise up ahead. He took a casual glance but just this glance made his jaw dropped. He cried out in his heart, \u201cI\u2019m screwed.\u201d</p><br/><p>In the distance, a group of reporters had come. There were also many townsfolk.</p><br/><p>\u201cOver there. Master Lin\u2019s shop is just over there.\u201d</p><br/><p>I can see the Heroic Doggy! He\u2019s laying at the entrance.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, we\u2019ve finally found it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan and the rest exchanged looks. \u201cBrother Lin, what do we do?\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, Lin Fan thought of killing himself. How on earth did it get exposed?</p><br/><p>It was impossible!</p><br/><p>Woof woof~</p><br/><p>Elder Dog barked at those people.</p><br/><p>This series of barks made those people even more maniacal.</p><br/><p>Before Lin Fan could respond, those reporters had surrounded them.</p><br/><p>A reporter said, \u201cMaster Lin, is this pet dog of yours the Heroic Dog who charged bravely into the fire a while ago?\u201d</p><br/><p>Another reporter asked, \u201cDo you know that your pet dog saved an infant? Now, the whole country is searching for it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Dog just stood there, facing the lens. He casually let those reporters capture his face.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan rolled his eyes. They had actually managed to find him. Then, Lin Fan sighed. There was nothing he could do about it. Gold shines wherever you put it. You can never hide gold.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy dear reporters and citizens, please quieten down. I didn\u2019t expect you all to really find out,\u201d Lin Fan sighed.</p><br/><p>A reporter asked in a puzzled tone, \u201cMaster Lin, your pet dog has saved a life. Why don\u2019t you want us to find out?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed softly, \u201cMy dear reporter, I can tell that you\u2019ve only just gotten to know me. Whether it\u2019s me or my pet, we\u2019re very humble. Doing good deeds is very normal. If a good deed was for the sake of recognition, then we wouldn\u2019t be interested anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAt the time, I didn\u2019t know what he had done but he came back with injuries all over and his four legs were broken. I was very heartbroken. Luckily, my medical skills are top-notch and I\u2019ve managed to heal him in these few days. Afterward, I saw the news and I understood what had happened. However, since that young life has been saved, it\u2019s already a perfect ending. There\u2019s no need to let people know.\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporters kept taking photos. They had been moved by Lin Fan\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, when the citizens who had come specially to see Elder Dog heard about the severity of his injuries, their hearts ached. A beautiful little girl, in particular, was hugging Elder Dog in her embrace.</p><br/><p>\u201cDoggy is really amazing.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Elder Dog felt this warm embrace, his dog eyes squinted. He was very merry.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, how do you usually train your dog? How did he become so clever and amazing?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled, \u201cI don\u2019t train him much. I just tell him to do some things occasionally and since young, I\u2019ve raised him to be close to humans. I never thought that he would do such a beautiful deed. I\u2019m really gratified. Alright, since there\u2019s nothing much, you guys can go back, my reporter comrades.\u201d</p><br/><p>How could the reporters leave? They hadn\u2019t even finished asking their questions.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, netizens are searching for this dog right now. Moreover, there\u2019s a first-rate superstar hoping to keep and raise this dog. Would you agree?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was speechless. He had known that if this matter was found out, questions would come at him nonstop. He wouldn\u2019t be able to get any peace that day.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course I don\u2019t agree. He\u2019s a member of our place. Do you think we would sell him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA few months ago, during the search for the kidnapped children, this doggy had followed their trail and found them. At that time, was this doggy already very clever?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, can you tell us the doggy\u2019s name?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cElder Dog Nicholas.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat a dominant name.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment.</p><br/><p>A voice came from afar.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh! The doggy is here. Our idol is here!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan raised his head and looked. It was as if there were tens of thousands of horses galloping in his heart. Elder Dog\u2019s fans were here.</p><br/><p>They were doomed.</p></div>\n</div>"}

He felt as if what he had done had been exposed but his strong mental fortitude allowed him to steady himself.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-1\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p><em>I must not get anxious. I don\u2019t think this matter has developed to the stage where it can\u2019t be resolved.</em></p><br/><p>\u201cGrandpa, what is it?\u201d Ma Xiao Long pretended like he didn\u2019t know what was going on. If he let his Grandpa know that he had gone against him and taken the ten million dollars for himself, he would be in trouble.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2018What is it\u2019? Have you given him the ten million dollars that I told you to? Ma Jun Guo barked. If Master Lin hadn\u2019t talked about it, he probably would have been kept in the dark. He would also have left a bad impression on them.</p><br/><p>Hearing this, Ma Xiao Long trembled. <em>It can\u2019t have been exposed, can it? It\u2019s impossible. How could he know? Unless the opposite party came asking about it?</em></p><br/><p><em>But that shouldn\u2019t be the case. Who would be so shameless to ask about this?</em></p><br/><p>\u201cI gave it to him, Grandpa,\u201d replied Ma Xiao Long with his teeth gritted. He believed that the opposite party couldn\u2019t have been so shameless to ask for money.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-2\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>On the other end of the call, Ma Jun Guo\u2019s temper was at its limit. Then, he calmed himself down and said, \u201cGet your a*s over here now. They\u2019ve already come to complain to me and you\u2019re still here quibbling. Do you know that I\u2019ve lost my face because of you\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>When Ma Xiao Long heard that, he was completed dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, that\u2019s way too shameless.\u201d</p><br/><p>He hadn\u2019t thought that the opposite party would really come asking for it. But what he didn\u2019t know was that it had initially been fine until Lin Fan started asking Zhao Ming Qing about it.</p><br/><p>To Lin Fan, for his student to go and treat Ma Jun Guo\u2019s illness and just get sent back empty-handed, it was an insult. They were just looking down on him.</p><br/><p>Unbearable. Absolutely unbearable.</p><br/><p>Ma Xiao Long\u2019s face was as dull as mud as he stood there dumbfounded. He looked at the people in the private room and didn\u2019t know what to say.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Long, what is it?\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-3\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Ma Xiao Long sighed. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m done for. Once I go back, I\u2019ll be in trouble. I can\u2019t treat you guys anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, without saying more, he left immediately.</p><br/><p>As for what would happen when he got home, he didn\u2019t dare to imagine it.</p><br/><p>What awaited him was probably a thunderous eruption.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The next day!</p><br/><p>Recently, there had been quite many incidents and Lin Fan had been busy.</p><br/><p>The teaching block\u2019s construction had been completed. The teaching equipment had already been purchased a long time ago and the retailers were just waiting for Lin Fan to give them the call for delivery. These matters were all handled by professionals and they weren\u2019t issues at all.</p><br/><p>Every morning, the first thing he would do was unlock his phone and look at the news.</p><br/><p>Then, something that made Lin Fan smile happened. The Education Department had made a public statement.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-4\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>They were willing to lend a big hand to Nanshan Children\u2019s Welfare Institute. Also, they recognized it as a private teaching welfare institute.</p><br/><p>Although Lin Fan didn\u2019t understand exactly what had happened behind the scenes, just by thinking a little, he had a rough idea.</p><br/><p>That Chen Shi must have been unhappy with the outcome but anyone who wasn\u2019t an idiot would have understood the situation.</p><br/><p>As for such a public statement, Lin Fan had no problems with it at all.</p><br/><p>*Ding ding*</p><br/><p>The phone rang.</p><br/><p>\u201cMing Qing, what\u2019s up?\u201d Lin Fan asked with a grin as he picked up the phone. He already knew what it was.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, they want to give me money. I\u2026\u201d Before Zhao Ming Qing could finish, Lin Fan interrupted.</p><br/><p>\u201cTake it then. No need to be courteous,\u201d said Lin Fan. This was just a small matter. Those big shots definitely couldn\u2019t afford to lose face.</p><br/><p>The previous night, Elder Zheng had already called Lin Fan, saying that this incident had been a misunderstanding. It turned out that Ma Jun Guo\u2019s grandson had taken the money for himself out of greed.</p><br/><p>Now, that kid was kneeling in his house in repentance.</p><br/><p>Thinking about that, Lin Fan couldn\u2019t help but burst into laughter.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-5\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing hadn\u2019t wanted to keep the money but since his teacher said so, what else could he say? He could only agree.</p><br/><p>This was his first time receiving such a huge payment for his medical services. He felt that it was unreal.</p><br/><p>Nanshan Children\u2019s Welfare Institute.</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan reached, the children were not outside playing anymore. They were sitting in the classrooms.</p><br/><p>Director Huang said with a beaming smile, \u201cMaster Lin, these children are really way too fortunate now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded. \u201cMmm, this is very good indeed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Now, the welfare institute was gradually getting on the right track. And he believed that it would only get better and better.</p><br/><p>Han Lu was now considered the Chief of Security for the welfare institute now. Whenever he was free, he would be in the security room at the entrance to monitor the welfare institute\u2019s safety.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan took a look and said, \u201cRight, I realized that the welfare institute\u2019s surveillance cameras are rather few. Contact some people and tell them to install some more. Every corner outside and every classroom must have one. Ensure that not a single blind spot exists.\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Huang nodded. \u201cI hadn\u2019t thought of that. The surveillance cameras in the welfare institute now were all installed a long time ago and their quality isn\u2019t very high. The footage produced is quite blurred. We should indeed change them.\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-6\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about the money. I\u2019ll take care of the money. The important thing is to raise the security of the welfare institute.\u201d Lin Fan felt that if they were going to do it, they should do it to the best that they could.</p><br/><p>There were so many children in here and safety was the top priority. They couldn\u2019t afford to be careless.</p><br/><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d Director Huang nodded.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan walked past classroom after classroom. The children inside were all seated and focused, listening to the teacher in front. They appeared to be very happy.</p><br/><p>The atmosphere was pretty good. Lin Fan was very pleased.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, right. I saw that in the kitchen, the equipment is too old. We should get new ones. Also, the source of the food ingredients should be looked into,\u201d said Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Director Huang took out her notebook and recorded all these notes. After this, she would immediately carry out all these matters.</p><br/><p>She could see that Master Lin was very particular about these things. It seemed that he didn\u2019t want any problems to arise.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, regarding the children\u2019s teaching materials from now on, how will we handle it?\u201d asked Director Huang.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan grinned. \u201cThe Education Department is willing to lend their full support to Nanshan Children\u2019s Welfare Institute, aren\u2019t they? Go and ask them for it. If they trouble you, let me know.\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-7\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cBut don\u2019t neglect the children\u2019s hobbies. Every day, ensure that they spend at least an hour immersing in practicing their hobbies.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chinese art was the children\u2019s favorite hobby. Although the institute was slowly becoming regulated, they still had to keep on practicing.</p><br/><p>For no other reason but that this path was one that they could keep on going on.</p><br/><p>Without some talent, the children wouldn\u2019t be able to talk with much confidence in the future.</p><br/><p>If all he wanted to do was to let the children study, there was no need to spend so much. He was expanding the welfare institute and hoping to divide the children into various schools. This was something that was now within his ability.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p></div>\n</div>"}

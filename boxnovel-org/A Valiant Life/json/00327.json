He couldn't understand why. If the policemen came, it would just mean more procedures and more trouble.</p><br/><p>\"That guy isn't good news.\" Lin Fan gave a small grin.</p><br/><p>He Xiao Ming was stunned. \"Uncle, how can you tell?\"</p><br/><p>Zhang Yang and the rest all gathered, looking at Lin Fan curiously. They felt that Xiao Ming's uncle was just too awesome. He was more awesome than awesome.</p><br/><p>Zhao Xu the fatty blushed with embarrassment and excitement. \"Uncle, the way you dealt with those guys was just too cool! Have you ever practiced martial arts before?\"</p><br/><p>He Xiao Ming looked up with pride. \"Hmph, now you know how awesome my uncle is. When I said this before, you guys didn't believe me.\"</p><br/><p>\"Don't put words into my mouth. I definitely didn't disagree with you. We were all excited when we heard that you were going to bring your uncle over. He must really be something.\"</p><br/><p>\"The police will come in a moment. You guys all have a share in this effort,\" Lin Fan grinned as he said.</p><br/><p>\"Uncle, how could you tell that this guy is a bad guy? Have you seen him somewhere before?\" He Xiao Ming asked.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan didn't say anymore as a few police cars pulled up at the scene. Liu Xiao Tian rushed over. \"Little Boss, what's the situation here?\"</p><br/><p>He was stunned when he came to the scene full of big guys groaning in pain on the floor. Although he didn't know what was going on, he trusted Little Boss, because he was accurate when it came to reading people. Of course, Liu Xiao Tian knew that it was Little Boss's fortune telling ability, but only he believed it. Other people would definitely not believe it, and as a civil servant, he was the last person who was expected to believe in such things and so, Liu Xiao Tian just kept it to himself.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan pointed at the big guy. \"It's that big guy over there. He has committed a crime in the past few days. I suggest you guys interview him.\"</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian nudged Lin Fan. \"Can you tell what kind of crime he committed?\"</p><br/><p>\"How would I know? You guys interview him directly.\" Lin Fan continued saying, \"But it isn't any petty crime, you guys better conduct a thorough investigation.\"</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian nodded his head. He had great trust in what Lin Fan said. If he said it was something big, then it would be something big.</p><br/><p>\"Chief Liu, if you find something really big, could I trouble you to put my name down for another Good Citizen Award? But not just me, all these guys here also played a part,\" Lin Fan said, looking at He Xiao Ming and the rest.</p><br/><p>When Zhang Yang heard what Lin Fan said, he immediately puffed out his chest. \"I used a glass bottle to rile him up and to weed him out because I just had this feeling that there was something wrong with him.\"</p><br/><p>\"Officer, look. My face also got beaten by him and it's all swollen now,\" He Xiao Ming added on.</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian chuckled. \"Alright, alright. We'll go and investigate this case and if we find anything big, we'll recommend you guys for Good Citizen Awards. But Little Boss, I think you have quite a few of those already.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved that idea away. \"I don't have a lot. When I'm old, I can use them to look back on my youth.\"</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian felt helpless and couldn't refute him. Lin Fan indeed had a point. All the policemen who were standing around chuckled. They were used to having Master Lin around helping them with their cases. Ever since he had started helping, they had been catching a lot more criminals and had solved a few big cases. Master Lin even got praised by the chief of the police. When they thought back, they realized that they were very blessed and lucky to have Master Lin around.</p><br/><p>\"Bring them all in and handcuff them!\" Liu Xiao Tian ordered.</p><br/><p>Just as the policemen were about to take them in, Lin Fan interjected, \"Wait! They haven't paid for their meal yet and they should.\"</p><br/><p>The huge guy's face turned from sour to seething. Not only had he gotten beaten up, he had gotten arrested and now he even had to fork out money for his meal. How unlucky.</p><br/><p>The tanned teenager who was heavily tattooed kept on struggling against the police officer, not willing to get taken into the local police station. But under the police officers restraint, he couldn't fight back.</p><br/><p>After everyone left. </p><br/><p>Lin Fan clapped his hands. \"Alright, everyone! Good job. We can all go home now.\" </p><br/><p>\"Uncle, let me send you back,\" He Xiao Ming said as he looked at Lin Fan in awe and reverence.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan paused to ponder for awhile. \"It's alright, I'll go back to get my own car. You continue having fun with your friends. If there's anything next time, I'm just a call away. Sometimes, there are things which you can't deal with yourself, but that being said, you shouldn't go out and provoke people for no good reason.\"</p><br/><p>He Xiao Ming nodded. \"Uncle, don't you worry. I definitely will not provoke anyone outside.\"</p><br/><p>He Xiao Ming and his friends gathered together after Lin Fan had left. They hadn't gathered in quite a while and this feeling was rather good.</p><br/><p>\"Xiao Ming, what does your uncle do?\" Zhang Yang asked.</p><br/><p>\"He's just too cool!\" Zhao Xu exclaimed.</p><br/><p>\"Yeah, we've never met someone as amazing as him. If we hadn't seen it for ourselves, we would never have dared to believe it,\" the rest said.</p><br/><p>\"Hehe, this is my Uncle. He runs a shop on Cloud Street and he is really famous. He's also really good friends with my dad.\"</p><br/><p>... </p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian brought everyone into the local police station for questioning and especially focused his interrogation efforts on the huge guy which Little Boss had singled out. At first, any efforts at interrogation had been futile as he would just talk back but he started becoming more frightened as the police got more information from his friends who sold him out.</p><br/><p>\"He was bragging to us the other day about how he raped...\"</p><br/><p>After he heard that line, Liu Xiao Tian was stunned for a moment before regaining his composure. Could it be that he was this lucky, that this guy was the perpetrator of the crime that he was trying to solve just before Little Boss had called him?</p><br/><p>This case was a hard one to crack, the main issue being that all the suspects were honest folk mixed up with crooks. Furthermore, there was absolutely no CCTV footage of the crime being committed. The female victim was a foreign laborer who stayed in a run-down apartment in a bad district where crime rates were high. With absolutely no leads on the case, the police officers were looking for a needle in a haystack.</p><br/><p>But now, Liu Xiao Tian felt like he finally had a positive outcome. The final interrogation made the huge guy spill the beans. He had indeed committed the crime.</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian heaved a huge sigh of relief. This case which had caused him sleepless nights was now concluded. Case closed.</p><br/><p>He took out his phone and dialed a familiar number. </p><br/><p>\"Little Boss, I can't thank you enough. I really have no other words to say. Meeting you is the best thing that has ever happened to me. The guy who you singled out was the perpetrator of a huge case that I was working on and I was almost at my wit's end.\" Liu Xiao Tian sincerely felt like thanking Lin Fan. How many times had it been?!</p><br/><p>The first and second times were good, but all the way until now, Little Boss would still always call at the right time and that phone call would somehow lead to the arrest of the wanted criminal.</p><br/><p>If anyone heard about this, who would even dare to believe it?</p><br/><p>\"Wow, I guess it's your lucky day. Although I hope you don't forget about the Good Citizen Award,\" Lin Fan chirped over the phone.</p><br/><p>\"Don't worry about that. That is a small thing. I'll recommend your friends and yourself as well for the Good Citizen Award,\" Liu Xiao Tian said.</p><br/><p>All the policemen outside were elated. They had been working overtime for the past few days trying to crack this case. Finally, they could go home to get a good night's rest. The stress over the past few days had been too immense, but it was over.</p><br/><p>To them, Little Boss was just too amazing!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

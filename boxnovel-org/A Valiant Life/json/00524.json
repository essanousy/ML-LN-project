After seeing all the police cars gathered around, they knew something wasn\u2019t right. But as the strongest supporters of Little Boss, they didn\u2019t fear anything.</p><br/><p>All the other police officers who were standing around looked puzzled. What was going on? They were just arresting one person. Why were all these shop owners getting so riled up?</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Boss\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happened to you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn it, if they are going to bring our Little Boss away, they have to go through us first.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. It\u2019s going to take a lot of effort for them to even bring Little Boss one step out of this place.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone calm down!\u201d the policemen said, trying to control the situation.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, we can\u2019t!\u201d everyone shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, if you want to bring our Little Boss away, we won\u2019t calm down.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet go of our Little Boss, and we can act like nothing happened.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t let him go, don\u2019t blame us for having our brooms with us.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian shook his head in helplessness as he heard the commotion outside. \u201cPlease help us settle the situation outside,\u201d he said, looking at Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>The situation happened so suddenly, and Lin Fan was still a little anxious. Since he was already here, there was no going back. He looked at Liu Xiao Tian, his face calm and composed. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, they are actually very friendly.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Lin Fan walked out, all the shop owners all started shouting his name, their faces lighting up. \u201cLittle Boss, don\u2019t you worry! We are all here!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan stood there, his face blank. Since when had he ever been worried? \u201cGuys, please don\u2019t cause a commotion. I\u2019m fine over here and I just have to get investigated, so don\u2019t cause any more trouble. Please go back to your own business!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Boss, you aren\u2019t lying to us, are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Little Boss. You have our full support!\u201d</p><br/><p>Moving! This scene was just too moving!</p><br/><p>At this moment, Lin Fan almost felt like crying.</p><br/><p>Lin fan waved them away. \u201cGuys, please don\u2019t worry about me. Nothing bad will happen. I\u2019ll just go to jail for a month. When I come back, I\u2019ll still be me, so please don\u2019t worry!\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, a few limousines arrived at the scene.</p><br/><p>Quite a few people got out from the limousine.</p><br/><p>\u201cThese guys are professionals from the National Internet Safety Department. You beat them flat and screwed them upside down,\u201d Liu Xiao Tian said, looking at Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot worth a mention,\u201d Lin fan said, lowering his voice as he shook his head.</p><br/><p>The Head of the Internet Safety Department was a middle-aged male. His eye bags were heavy and his face gaunt. He looked like he had spent too many hours in front of the computer.</p><br/><p>The head of the department was once a computer expert, and he knew the people who were from the same line. Under his management, the department had improved tremendously, until the embarrassing thing happened today.</p><br/><p>Shen Jie Yun looked around upon arriving as if he was looking for something.</p><br/><p>He was the same as other hacking professionals. He was full of youthful vigour and would never admit that he had lost. After he got screwed badly by Lin Fan, he felt indignant and so he came here to prove himself.</p><br/><p>\u201cLeader, what are you guys doing here?\u201d Chief Liu went up to him and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere is that computer hacker? We came here to see which group it was that harnessed this kind of ability, causing us to be beaten flat by him.\u201d Shen Jie Yun said.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t think much when he saw Lin Fan, continuing to look around, but none of the people present at the scene looked like computer geniuses.</p><br/><p>\u201cLeader, the person that you are looking for is right in front of you. This person is Master Lin, the instigator of everything that happened today,\u201d Liu Xiao Tian said with a smile.</p><br/><p>Suddenly!</p><br/><p>The atmosphere went silent.</p><br/><p>Shen Jie Yun looked at Lin Fan, his face in a daze.</p><br/><p>The other computer geniuses also reacted in the same way, looking at Lin Fan with disbelief. How could that person be the hacker that single-handedly took all of them down?</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re saying it\u2019s him?\u201d Shen Jie Yun said, his face looking puzzled.</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian nodded. \u201cYep, it\u2019s him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn, how is that possible?\u201d Shen Jie Yun said, his face astonished. If it was a group, he would still have accepted it, but now after finding out that it was a one-man army that had defeated their whole group of Internet professionals, he could not believe it, and couldn\u2019t accept the defeat.</p><br/><p>In that instant, his youthful spirit was smashed into pieces.</p><br/><p>Despair!</p><br/><p>Incomparable despair!</p><br/><p>\u201cHow do you do, Leader? I was the person that crossed paths with you guys while accessing the bank server. I must say that your skills are terrible and you guys definitely need to work on that, otherwise, you guys will be in trouble when you meet a malicious hacker,\u201d Lin Fan said, his face full of smiles.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh?\u201d Shen Jie Yun looked at Lin Fan, his thoughts in a mess. Their little hacking group had attained second placing in the nation and internationally, they were a well renowned hacking group. And now hearing Lin Fan say that their skills were terrible\u2026</p><br/><p>If it was anyone else who said that their skills were terrible, he would have exploded with rage. But looking at this person, his confidence immediately waned, knowing that he got completely suppressed by him. He had nothing on him.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow is this possible? Chief Liu, did you get the wrong guy? It\u2019s just one person?\u201d the other computer geniuses said, unable to believe it. They wondered if Chief Liu was just toying with them.</p><br/><p>If they had lost to another group of hackers, they would have conceded. Knowing that they had beaten by a single person made their defeat bitter and really broke their spirits.</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian smiled, his heart bursting with pride. Master Lin was his good friend and after seeing how talented he was to have been able to defeat the group of computer hacking \u2018geniuses\u2019, he felt good on the inside.</p><br/><p>\u201cYep, it\u2019s just him,\u201d Liu Xiao Tian nodded his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour skills are so good, so why did you expose yourself? With your kind of ability, you could have masked yourself and we would never have found a trace of you,\u201d one of the hacking professionals said, his tone unbelieving.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan felt helpless. How could he admit that he really didn\u2019t know how to conceal himself? If he said it out loud, he would definitely be looked down upon by them.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy do I have to conceal myself? I broke the law and have to deal with the consequences of my actions, and hopefully, I\u2019ll get a lighter sentence,\u201d Lin Fan said calmly.</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian looked at Lin Fan with respect. He had never thought that his old friend would be this self-aware and have such high morals. He felt glad that he had the chance to meet this kind of a friend.</p><br/><p>The members of the Internet Safety Department fell silent. They realised that the Computer Guru in front of them had such a high sense of morality, more than most people.</p><br/><p>What a shame. He had broken the law and had to face up to the consequences.</p><br/><p>\u201cBring his computer in,\u201d Shen Jie Yun commanded.</p><br/><p>That was the tool of the crime and had to be examined by the people from the Internet Safety Department.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t spoil my computer. I just bought this one. Also, don\u2019t delete any of my files. I took a very long time to download all of them,\u201d Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>Shen Jie Yun lit up with joy as he heard that. With a computer guru like him, he must have had access to a whole range of classified files. What could it be?</p><br/><p>Could it be classified files having to do with the nation?</p><br/><p>Or maybe he was a malicious hacker who had the past time for hacking into international databases to find secret files?</p><br/><p>And now, what was the thing that this guru was so concerned about? Could it be something special?</p></div>\n</div>"}

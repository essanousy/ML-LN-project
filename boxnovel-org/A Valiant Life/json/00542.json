He can even hit such beautiful women. If I find him, I would beat that guy to death.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLook at all those surrounding men who only know how to watch. Do they not know how to go up and help?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck, if I were there, I would definitely step in and help. Two beautiful ladies were bullied. This is really despicable.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a dog. He even hits ladies. That\u2019s unmanly of him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho the heck is this guy? Someone, hurry up and track him down. We\u2019ll teach him a lesson.</p><br/><p>The masses of female netizens were infuriated as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough the video is only ten seconds, I really can\u2019t bear to watch it. So many men were around but not a single one stepped in to stop it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo matter what, he should not hit a lady.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe is not fit to be a man. I hope he stays single for life.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>This piece of news caused a huge impact on the Internet. Many netizens had seen it but the video was only ten seconds and it only showed the man hitting the two ladies, especially that slap. It was a very heavy slap that could be heard clearly in the video.</p><br/><p>Countless males felt their hearts ache. Such beautiful little sisters had been hit. Was that guy even human?</p><br/><p>If the girls looked average, they would forget about it. However, such beautiful ladies should be taken care of. How could he hit them?</p><br/><p>Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laid there, wondering why those two girls hadn\u2019t called anyone over to deal with him yet. His life was quite boring and he had been hoping to add some excitement.</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang cried out in shock, \u201cIt\u2019s not good, Brother Lin. Something has happened.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said dispiritedly, \u201cWhat has happened? What\u2019s the big deal?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLook, someone cut the video and posted the part where you hit them on the Internet. Now, it\u2019s even trending. Countless people are attacking you and they even want to track you down,\u201d Zhao Zhong Yang said as he handed over the phone.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian and Wu You Lan came over as well. When they saw the video, they were stunned.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan said furiously, \u201cHow can these people be like this? This video clearly has been cut. It wasn\u2019t like this at all.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian pondered for a moment, then said, \u201cIt looks to me that someone definitely did this on purpose.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan seemed to not be bothered. \u201cThey can scold me if they want. That\u2019s very lame.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang said anxiously, \u201cBrother Lin, do you not care at all? This matter has to do with your reputation. If you don\u2019t clarify things and the netizens find out that it\u2019s you, then it would be too late.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved his hand. \u201cIt\u2019s no big deal. I can\u2019t live according to the assessment of others. Their assessments are their own. They don\u2019t hurt me one bit. It\u2019s not an issue.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Lin is truly Brother Lin. He isn\u2019t even bothered by this,\u201d said Zhao Zhong Yang with a sigh. He had to respect Lin Fan\u2019s decision.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan still felt a little unhappy, \u201cHow can they be like this?\u201d</p><br/><p>In a certain place.</p><br/><p>The two girls who had been taught a lesson by Lin Fan the previous day were looking at the news on the Internet. Cold smiles appeared on their faces. Since he had dared to hit them, they had to make him pay.</p><br/><p>Their friend was an expert in Internet operations. At that moment, he asked curiously, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you bring people to settle things with him?\u201d</p><br/><p>The taller girl laughed coldly, \u201cSettling things with him would be too easy. I want to humiliate him and let the people on the Internet scold him.\u201d</p><br/><p>The shorter girl added, \u201cThat\u2019s right. We want the people on the Internet to scold him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s almost time to go public with this frontal photo of him. Once we show this photo to the public, he\u2019ll definitely be found by people. Then, it will be time for him to receive his punishment.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>On Weibo.</p><br/><p>A post appeared.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe photo of the person who hit the girls has emerged. Everyone must let him know how bad of a mistake it is to hit girls.\u201d</p><br/><p>Once the photo was posted, it was instantly reposted by countless people.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, the person has been found. I\u2019m from Shanghai so I have to go and see just what gave him the confidence to dare to hit girls.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMotherf*cker, I have to kill this guy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDog! He looks just like a dog!\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly, the situation changed a little.</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone, wait a moment. Why does the person in this photo look so much like someone else?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, that\u2019s true. D*mn, this is Master Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? The person who hit them is Master Lin?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStop scolding, everyone, stop scolding him. We can\u2019t scold this man. This is Master Lin. we absolutely mustn\u2019t scold him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn I scolded him so many times previously, what should I do? Master Lin is my idol! I f*cking scolded my own idol. This is f*cked up.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone, don\u2019t be carried away. Although Master Lin hit them, we don\u2019t know the full story. According to what we know, Master Lin is a man with a sense of justice. How could he hit girls for no reason?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know, it must have been because these two girls deserved to be hit. That\u2019s why Master Lin did it to teach them a lesson.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m just speculating but these two girls definitely did something outrageous.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat makes a lot of sense.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>When the two girls saw the situation on the Internet, they were instantly dumbfounded. It was as if they didn\u2019t dare to believe it. Those netizens who had just been scolding him so fiercely suddenly stopped. They actually started to come up with excuses for Master Lin. this made them anxious.</p><br/><p>The shorter girl asked with puzzlement, \u201cWho is this Master Lin?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know either.\u201d</p><br/><p>However, that Internet operations expert was shocked. \u201cD*mn, the person who hit you was Master Lin and you still wanted to get support from the Internet? You\u2019re asking for your own death! Do you know just how terrifying that Master Lin\u2019s fans are? Moreover, Master Lin\u2019s reputation isn\u2019t something you can taint so easily.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut he really hit us.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what exactly happened? Why did Master Lin hit you all?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2026we\u2026\u201d They didn\u2019t know how to reply. They pondered for a moment and felt that that situation wasn\u2019t right as well. They had been too inhumane with their words.</p><br/><p>The operations expert looked at the screen. Suddenly, he saw a video. \u201cLook, is that you?\u201d</p><br/><p>The two girls came over hastily but when they saw the video, they were dumbfounded. \u201cHow\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The Internet was a mystical place. Suddenly, the truth had appeared.</p><br/><p>A video had appeared on Weibo and was instantly spread everywhere.</p><br/><p>The title was: \u2018The truth of Cloud Street\u2019</p><br/><p>Masses of netizens opened the videos out of curiosity but when they watched the whole thing, they were completely infuriated.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck! We\u2019ve been manipulated.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThese two ladies are too disgusting. They actually said things like that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour mom! So what if she\u2019s a sanitation Auntie? How could you humiliate her like that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin was right to hit them. If it was me, I would hit them as well. They f*cking deserved to be hit.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI dislike it when men hit women but after seeing this video, I have to applaud. That was a good hit. This kind of people deserves to be hit at the very least.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSearch for these two girls\u2019 identities. They\u2019re too f*cking disgusting.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, a movie-like turn of events had occurred.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan had been typing on his phone but when he saw this video, he slowly stopped. Then, he understood. This kind of small matter didn\u2019t require him to personally do anything.</p><br/><p>Although it is said that the truth always comes out too late, this wasn\u2019t too late at all</p><br/><p>.</p></div>\n</div>"}

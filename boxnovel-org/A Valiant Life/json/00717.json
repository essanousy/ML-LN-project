There had been no big incidents or exciting happenings.</p><br/><p>Shanghai TV.</p><br/><p>Because he had agreed to become a singing mentor for Shanghai TV, he came here to meet them. At the same time, he was also there to discuss the money.</p><br/><p>Regarding money, Lin Fan wasn\u2019t very interested. However, he couldn\u2019t just work for free. He had to make some money from it.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, this was an unrealistic wish for us but you actually came. Let me give you an introduction. This is our Director Liu,\u201d introduced the Deputy Director.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled and shook the man\u2019s hand. \u201cNice to meet you, Director Liu. I enjoy watching your shows very much.\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Liu smiled, \u201cMaster Lin is too courteous. For Master Lin to enjoy watching our show, it is our honor.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although Lin Fan was younger, his achievements could not be underestimated.</p><br/><p>The man might have been a Director, but he was still very serious about meeting Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>They sat on the sofa and the staff carried tea and water over. Initially, only the Deputy Director was required to discuss the collaboration. However, Director Liu was very curious about Lin Fan and he naturally wanted to personally receive him.</p><br/><p>His first impression was that Lin Fan was so young that it was scary. At such a young age, Lin Fan was already so successful. Moreover, he was very warm and did not give off a feeling of arrogance at all.</p><br/><p>He was someone who was easy to converse with.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, this show of ours is called \u2018Strongest Heavenly Voice\u2019. We\u2019ve invited a total of four mentors and you\u2019re one of them. As for the other three, you\u2019ll know who they are when the time comes. We\u2019ll wait for the climax,\u201d said Director Liu with a smile.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cAlright. I\u2019m very excited about this unknown aspect. But, Director Liu, since you are willing to invite me, I should also tell you what I don\u2019t like. I don\u2019t like shady business. If there is any shady business involved in your show, tell me truthfully and I shan\u2019t stay around any longer.\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Liu was taken aback. Then, he laughed, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry about that, Master Lin. Our Shanghai TV isn\u2019t short of money or relations. Hence, there will definitely not be any shady business involved. That, I can vouch for. However, this is the first time I\u2019ve truly witnessed how relentless you are against corruption, Master Lin. No wonder you were able to force Ying Jin to suffer silently.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled as he waved his hand. \u201cYou\u2019re praising me too much. I draw a lot of hate. I don\u2019t even know how many enemies I have. But this is considered my second time cooperating with Shanghai TV. The first was on that anti-gambling show.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Deputy Director didn\u2019t say anything as he stood at the side and let the Director interact with Master Lin. If there were any questions, he would explain.</p><br/><p>In the end, they came to an agreement. The appearance fee that Lin Fan would receive was $20,000,000.</p><br/><p>This was already considered a very high price. With Lin Fan\u2019s current fame, he definitely wasn\u2019t qualified to earn that much. Ying Jin was able to earn a $100,000,000 because she had the reputation. Although Lin Fan didn\u2019t like Ying Jin, he had to admit that after being in the industry for so long, Ying Jin was very successful.</p><br/><p>The negotiations ended and Lin Fan didn\u2019t stay any longer. He left the place.</p><br/><p>The Deputy Director was confused as he asked, \u201cDirector, $20,000,000 is too much, isn\u2019t it? Although Master Lin has some fame, I don\u2019t think he deserves such a high price.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFame isn\u2019t important. If I think it\u2019s worth, then it\u2019s worth. Although Master Lin is young, he has my regard. There aren\u2019t many young people like him these days,\u201d said Director Liu with a sigh.</p><br/><p>The Deputy Director didn\u2019t say any more. If it was going to be $20,000,000, then so be it. However, it was a little higher than what the three other mentors were being paid.</p><br/><p>On the street.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was in a very good mood. He was actually going to become a mentor. Just thinking about it made him excited. As for the $20,000,000, he didn\u2019t have much use for it. It would be best to use it on the Welfare Institute and create an even better home for the children.</p><br/><p>At that moment, his phone rang.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the phone display and couldn\u2019t help but be puzzled.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t the call that was shocking, but the person who was calling. It was Ye Zhen Ming, who had exchanged numbers with him before.</p><br/><p>It was that Ye Zhen Ming who was one of the Gambling Kings.</p><br/><p>They had been on the show together. Although they hadn\u2019t interacted much, Lin Fan knew that his character was alright.</p><br/><p>After picking up the call, Lin Fan asked with a smile, \u201cTeacher Ye, we haven\u2019t contacted each other in so long.\u201d</p><br/><p>On the other end of the call, Ye Zhen Ming seemed quite excited. \u201cI never thought that Teacher Lin would still remember me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about? How could I not remember?\u201d Lin Fan laughed.</p><br/><p>Ye Zhen Ming had hesitated for a long time before making this call. Ever since that time, they had not interacted with each other. Especially in these few months, Teacher Lin had gotten a lot of attention and he was no longer someone who they, as gambling people, could compare to, socially, anymore.</p><br/><p>In fact, Ye Zhen Ming had thought that perhaps Teacher Lin had already forgotten about him or even deleted his phone number.</p><br/><p>But unexpectedly, Teacher Lin still remembered him. This made him feel very touched.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Ye Zhen Ming stammered. He wanted to say something but he was embarrassed to say it.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said suspiciously, \u201cHave you met with a problem, Teacher Ye?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSigh,\u201d a sigh came from the other end of the call. \u201cTeacher Lin, I\u2019m really ashamed to say this but I have no choice. Besides you, there\u2019s no one who can help Ou Xing Yun and I anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>This Ou Xing Yun was the Northern Gambling King. Like Ye Zhen Ming, he used to be an expert at cheating. Later on, they went through a drastic change and entered the anti-gambling industry.</p><br/><p>The three of them had gone head to head on the show and with his ability, Lin Fan had caused the two of them to submit.</p><br/><p>But as Lin Fan remembered, the two of them had been high-spirited at the time. Why did Ye Zhen Ming sound so gloomy now? He even sounded a little depressed.</p><br/><p>\u201cTell me. If I am able, I\u2019ll definitely help as long as it isn\u2019t anything illegal.\u201d Lin Fan thought about it for a moment. Although they weren\u2019t very familiar, they still knew each other. Since Ye Zhen Ming had actively called Lin Fan, Lin Fan couldn\u2019t just ignore him. But of course, Lin Fan wouldn\u2019t do anything illegal.</p><br/><p>If it was something illegal, Lin Fan would not help and on top of that, he would even put the two of them down.</p><br/><p>Ye Zhen Ming said, \u201cThis is the situation, Master Lin. Brother Ou and I have always been gamblers but we\u2019re also technical advisors at Haojiang Lottery Supervisory. We work at Mr. Yun\u2019s casino. But recently, something happened. A middle-aged man came to the casino and he\u2019s winning money everyday. He would win $10,000,000 and then stop before coming back the next day. This has gone on for eight days. In these few days, Brother Ou and I have been studying him but we have not discovered his cheating techniques. In the end, Brother Ou and I went up personally, hoping to find a loophole. However, we failed miserably. Hence, I\u2019m hoping that Teacher Lin could come and help us out. Of course, we\u2019ve already prepared a reward. We definitely won\u2019t let Teacher Lin work for nothing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan\u2019s brows furrowed. \u201cI don\u2019t gamble.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye Zhen Ming said anxiously, \u201cTeacher Lin, it\u2019s not gambling. I\u2019m just hoping that you could help us take a look and see if he\u2019s cheating. If he really is cheating, it would be easy for us to resolve this. If he really isn\u2019t cheating, then we wouldn\u2019t be able to do anything. We\u2019d only be able to restrict him from entering the casino and categorize him as an unwelcome personnel.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cThen you can just restrict him. Why do you have to clarify things?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye Zhen Ming explained, \u201cTeacher Lin, we could do that but if word of it spreads, it wouldn\u2019t be good. People would say that our casino cannot afford to lose. It is only a last resort and we can\u2019t let it happen. That\u2019s why we really want Master Lin to come and take a look.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan thought for a moment. He did not have anything coming up soon indeed. And judging by Ye Zhen Ming\u2019s tone, he was in such a panic that he was about to cry. He was probably having a tough time and under a lot of stress.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, then I\u2019ll come and take a look. I\u2019ll take a flight tomorrow. You guys can just come and pick me up,\u201d said Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Ye Zhen Ming said emotionally, \u201cThank you, Teacher Lin. Thank you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He hung up.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled as he shook his head. Although he had obtained the gambling knowledge, he wasn\u2019t planning to gamble. Because he was too dominant, it was meaningless.</p></div>\n</div>"}

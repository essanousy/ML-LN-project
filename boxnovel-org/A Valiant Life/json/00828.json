However, it was still the same as before and they still had no solution.</p><br/><p>However, Master Lin talking to Godfather Liu on the phone made them panic-stricken. The manner of their exchange was really too scary. It was filled with anger and hatred but at the same time, they still tried to display an image that they were good friends.</p><br/><p>Some people were afraid that if Master Lin were to go to the Northeast, Godfather Liu would take revenge on him. However, to Wang Ming Yang, he was definitely worried but he was not overly worried.</p><br/><p>He knew that his brother was like a tiger. The things that happened in Qingzhou were still fresh in his mind where his brother had single-handedly overturned Ma Qingzhou If he did not see things for himself, he would not have believed it.</p><br/><p>Regarding this kind of situations, if you ask someone whether he is afraid or not, regardless of what they say, they will definitely be afraid.</p><br/><p>As for Lin Fan going to the Northeast, he was definitely a little worried. However, he had confidence that nothing would happen to his brother.</p><br/><p>When the salon gathering ended.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan gave Chen Chang Sheng a pat on the back and said, \u201cRelax. Your problem will be gone very soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Chang Sheng helplessly said, \u201cMaster Lin, I recommend that you reconsider this. Godfather Liu is not someone who should be provoked. You going to the Northeast alone is really very dangerous.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed and said, \u201cRelax. The word \u2018danger\u2019 does not exist in my dictionary. As far as this Godfather Liu goes, I\u2019ve known him for a long time already. Having a small meet up with him is not much of a problem.\u201d</p><br/><p>However, inside, Lin Fan was wondering how Godfather Liu would receive him.</p><br/><p>He did not know if he would treat him to a meal or something. Thinking about it made Lin Fan feel a little eager.</p><br/><p>The next day!</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan reached the store, he realized that there was already a foreigner standing outside waiting for him.</p><br/><p>Henry Wang still could not understand it.</p><br/><p><em>Has our Michelin become useless? Why won\u2019t this Chinese man accept our certificate?</em></p><br/><p>In his eyes, this was something that simply could not happen.</p><br/><p>However, right now, it was happening in front of his eyes and he did not have a choice in whether he wanted to believe it or not.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian said, \u201cThis guy has been waiting for you for a long time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan glanced at him and said, \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBoss, did you forget me already? I am the judge who hands out Michelin stars. We sent you a mail inviting you to the ceremony where the certificates will be given out but you did not come. Thus, I have personally come down here to give you the certificate,\u201d Henry Wang said.</p><br/><p>To the people at Michelin, they did not really care much about regular chefs or the high-end Chinese chefs.</p><br/><p>However, there was actually a person who could make the people at Michelin very tense. If he was not satisfied with anything, it would make Michelin think of ways to improve. That person was the French godly chef, the most decorated chef in France.</p><br/><p>But right now, there was another person who refused to come for the certificate presentation ceremony which made Michelin very suspicious.</p><br/><p>It gave them an indescribable feeling.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Lin Fan took the certificate and then took a look at it. He did not seem to really care much about it.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan realized that collecting certificates was like a hobby to him.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you. You came all the way down here from thousands of miles away, I\u2019m very grateful for that,\u201d Lin Fan politely said.</p><br/><p><em>This Michelin is really not bad. Also, this certificate looks pretty good as well. If I hang it up on the wall, it\u2019ll boost our reputation as well.</em></p><br/><p>However, one source of his headaches was that because of this Michelin, the queues at his shop were going to become longer.</p><br/><p>It made him feel very awkward.</p><br/><p>Henry Wang looked at the stall. With his trip here this time around, he really wanted to have a scallion pancake. If he were to return back to his colleagues, he could dream about it day and night and still would not have the chance to buy it.</p><br/><p>But when he saw the Lin Fan did not really care about him, Henry Wang just helplessly sighed and left the area.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian said, \u201cWhat kind of attitude is this, to not even attend the certificate presentation? If it were me, I definitely would not give it to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed but did not say anything.</p><br/><p><em>If they don\u2019t want to give it then forget it. I can still live without it.</em></p><br/><p>However, he suddenly remembered something \u2013 How was he going to accomplish his task?</p><br/><p>When he was thinking about these things, the townsfolk who wanted to buy scallion pancakes had come.</p><br/><p>Also, the number of people who came today was far greater than before. Some of the older townsfolk sighed in despair, their expression was that of helplessness. Seeing so many people queuing up made them feel like crumbling.</p><br/><p>However, in the face of this situation, Lin Fan was very pleased. The knowledge of scallion pancakes was pinned onto the wall, reminding him about his purpose in doing this.</p><br/><p>There were a lot of new townsfolk and they all carefully looked at the list. It goes without saying that the success rate was decent and it brought him a lot of Encyclopedic Points.</p><br/><p>After the hard work was done, Lin Fan laid there to rest.</p><br/><p>Then, he took out his phone and gave his disciple a call.</p><br/><p>\u201cMing Qing, what are you up to?\u201d Lin Fan asked.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing said, \u201cTeacher, I\u2019m at the university. What about you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cNothing much. Recently I\u2019ve wanted to concoct more pills. Follow me to buy ingredients.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing cried out in alarm. He was a little excited as he said, \u201cTeacher, did you manage to create a new medicinal pill?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing had a large amount of admiration for his teacher\u2019s alchemy skills. It was simply brilliant and left him speechless.</p><br/><p>That \u2018Little Intelligence Pill\u2019 had an endless amount of uses. Right now, his mind was active and his thought were all very clear all thanks to that pill.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed and said, \u201cIsn\u2019t that rubbish? If I want to concoct some pills then it\u2019s definitely because I\u2019ve researched a new pill.\u201d</p><br/><p>However, the name of this task made him feel a little awkward.</p><br/><p>The end of suffering?</p><br/><p><em>How is he going to use this pill to end suffering? Is he going to kill them?</em></p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing became very impatient. With regards to his teacher\u2019s alchemy ability, he had a deep amount of confidence in them. The pills that he concocted would definitely surprise people and he wanted to be the first to see it.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, I\u2019ll come over now. Wait for me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing hung the phone up and without hesitation, put down everything he was doing and rushed towards Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was sitting there, rubbing his chin and was deep in thought.</p><br/><p>Right now, he was in control of a lot of pills. They were densely packed and blinding to the eyes.</p><br/><p>However, he did not even try to think about those higher end pills.</p><br/><p>Since he was relying on the ingredients from the marketplace, if he wanted to try and concoct those higher end pills, he was simply dreaming. Right now, he could only just try out the lower end pills.</p><br/><p>However, even though they were lower end pills, they were still not easy to concoct. There were some ingredients that were easy to find, however, there were also some ingredients that he had never heard of before.</p><br/><p>After a short period of time, Zhao Ming Qing arrived. His face was completely red and his expression was one of excitement.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, are we going there now?\u201d Zhao Ming Qing asked.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan asked, \u201cYep, let\u2019s go whip up some drug ingredients first.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing was extremely excited. He could finally see his teacher concoct pills once again. The feeling he had was super good.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian saw the both of them and could not help but ask, \u201cWhere are you guys going?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled and said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to do something huge. However, you don\u2019t know about it so you should just stay here and tend to the store.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian cursed in his mind.</p><br/><p><em>Motherf*cker, if you don\u2019t tell me clearly then obviously I </em>won\u2019t <em>know.</em></p><br/><p><em>But if you explained it clearly I would definitely understand.</em></p></div>\n</div>"}

I like the sound of that, kid.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFraud, who taught you to dress like this? Don\u2019t tell me you chose these clothes yourself,\u201d said Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian said, \u201cTrust me. I really chose them myself. What\u2019s wrong? Do you feel that I\u2019m really amazing? Let me tell you this. I didn\u2019t think that I had such a talent too. But it\u2019s pretty good, isn\u2019t it? Look at what I\u2019m wearing now? I only spent ten minutes picking it. If I were serious, it would be even better.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan felt helpless. \u201cHey, don\u2019t take it too far. I was just saying.\u201d</p><br/><p>In a certain fashion model company.</p><br/><p>A middle-aged man was looking through photos with his brows furrowed. He looked very displeased.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat the heck are they all wearing?\u201d</p><br/><p>After looking for a long time, the middle-aged man muttered those words.</p><br/><p>\u201cSigh. Are there really no eye-catching ones?\u201d The middle-aged man was cleanly groomed, with not a single hair out of place. Then, he took out his phone and looked at the latest news.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, the middle-aged man was stunned as he saw the photo on his phone.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis\u2026 this\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The person in the photo was none other than Fraud Tian. It was a photo of him with other people.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrilliant. This is really brilliant! This man has such individuality!\u201d</p><br/><p>The man was delighted. He immediately stood up and rushed out of the room. He had been mesmerized by the photo. However, those other people who were wearing boring old clothes in the photo affected its beauty. If it had been a solo photo, it would\u2019ve been perfect.</p><br/><p>The people in the office saw the Director walking past excitedly, and they started whispering amongst themselves.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up with the Director? Why does it feel as if something big just happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. When I was walking past, I kept hearing Director Wang cursing from his room, saying that the photos we took were terrible.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what\u2019s going on now? Where is he going?\u201d</p><br/><p>Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was talking to Wang Ming Yang on the phone.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother, things are going good. We can start manufacturing now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cMing Yang, this is too quick, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang said, \u201cOf course it\u2019s quick. The people in the government are all working overtime to rush things. You don\u2019t know this but the government has been flooded with calls. Tens of thousands of people have been calling to ask when those perfect artificial limbs will be released. They\u2019re all getting impatient.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cWow. There must be a lot of people waiting.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are even more. Even I\u2019ve been flooded with calls. My customer service staff can\u2019t take it anymore. In any case, these perfect artificial limbs have gone viral. However, we still haven\u2019t resolved the issue regarding those artificial limb companies. Those guys have really gone out of their minds. They want to have a share in this. Of course that\u2019s impossible! If they each get a share, things would get messed up.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan had not expected this. \u201cWhat does the government say?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey haven\u2019t said much. They\u2019re still discussing it. Maybe we\u2019ll let those companies manufacture the components. However, we have to fix the prices. We can\u2019t let them set whatever prices they want. If it wasn\u2019t for all those employees who would lose their jobs, the government would have ignored them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cAlright then. I\u2019ll leave this matter to you guys. I only come up with the technology. Anything else has nothing to do with me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha. You have to be there when we open for business. You\u2019re a huge attraction. If you don\u2019t come, we won\u2019t even be able to hold the opening ceremony.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cGot it. I didn\u2019t expect that you guys would do things so quickly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, the two of them chatted for a while more before hanging up.</p><br/><p>He really hadn\u2019t expected things to get done so quickly. But this was good. The faster they could start manufacturing, the faster those perfect artificial limbs could be released.</p><br/><p>After all, there were many people waiting for those artificial limbs.</p><br/><p>At that moment.</p><br/><p>A middle-aged man came into the shop hurriedly. His eyes swept the room before finally landing on Fraud Tian, who was sitting there, smoking and playing with his phone.</p><br/><p>With one look, he couldn\u2019t turn away anymore.</p><br/><p>As the smoke came out of Fraud Tian\u2019s mouth, the middle-aged man was shaken. He felt that this position looked exceptional.</p><br/><p>Head tilted. Eyelids drooping. Looking at his phone.</p><br/><p>Moreover, that beard made the middle-aged man feel that Fraud Tian\u2019s individuality was too intense.</p><br/><p>*Snap!*</p><br/><p>At that moment, the middle-aged man took out his phone and quickly snapped a photo. Then, as he looked closely, a smile gradually blossomed on his face as if he had discovered something amazing.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian raised his head curiously and looked at him. \u201cDon\u2019t you have any manners? How can you just take a photo of me without asking?\u201d</p><br/><p>The middle-aged man replied, \u201cI couldn\u2019t help myself. I really couldn\u2019t!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the scene before him and was a little confused. He couldn\u2019t understand what was going on. What was this middle-aged man doing?</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang inquired curiously as well. He was astonished. <em>It can\u2019t be. What\u2019s wrong with people these days? Is Fraud Tian really so attractive?</em></p><br/><p>The middle-aged man said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry for disturbing everyone. I\u2019m here to look for him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian immediately said happily, \u201cYou must be here ask for a photo with me. That\u2019s not a problem at all. After all, you\u2019re someone who understand me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, I completely understand you. I really do!\u201d said the middle-aged man excitedly as he grabbed Fraud Tian\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian instantly felt that something wasn\u2019t right. <em>Why the heck is this grown man holding my hand?</em></p><br/><p>The middle-aged man sensed Fraud Tian\u2019s alarm as well. Then, he immediately took out a name card.</p><br/><p>\u201cNice to meet you. My name is Wang Yun Fei. I\u2019m the Director of a fashion model company. I saw your photo on Weibo and was instantly blown away. You were born to be in the modelling world!\u201d Wang Yun Fei declared excitedly as if he had found a hidden treasure.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian said, \u201cWhat does modelling have to do with me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Yun Fei said, \u201cI want to invite you to be a model for our company. We will definitely put all our resources into promoting you in order to put you at the top of the world\u2019s trends. These clothes you\u2019re wearing as well as your poise are really too extraordinary. This is the feeling that I have been looking for!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cModel? Will I be paid?\u201d asked Fraud Tian excitedly.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou will. You will be paid a lot. Millions or even tens of millions a year is possible. As long as you keep this up and become the top model in the world, you can become the ambassador for many top brands. Then, you would really be rich,\u201d said Wang Yun Fei.</p><br/><p>When Fraud Tian heard this, he nearly jumped. It seemed like too much money. He felt as if he wouldn\u2019t be able to earn that much in his lifetime.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome. Come with me. There\u2019s no need to stay any longer. I guarantee that I\u2019ll make you famous,\u201d Wang Yun Fei said as he pulled Fraud Tian\u2019s arm.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait. What are you doing? I\u2019m staying here. I\u2019m not going anywhere,\u201d said Fraud Tian.</p><br/><p>Wang Yun Fei was stunned. \u201cHow much do you get every month here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFour to five thousand,\u201d replied Fraud Tian.</p><br/><p>\u201cFour to five thousand? Come with me and we\u2019ll sign a contract immediately. Your salary can be discussed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian immediately waved his hand. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not going. My life here is pretty good. If you want a photo with me, let\u2019s take one. If you want me to leave this place, that\u2019s not possible. I won\u2019t go no matter how much you pay me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Yun Fei was dumbfounded. He couldn\u2019t understand at all.</p></div>\n</div>"}

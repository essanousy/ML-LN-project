He pointed at the patients in front, \u201cWe\u2019re treating illnesses.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTreating illnesses? What illness? Which hospital are you from? Where is your medical certification?\u201d The Director spoke sternly. He felt that these people were scammers. He had seen this kind of situation before and it worked because the patients were desperate.</p><br/><p>The nurses persuaded, \u201cSir, please come back for treatment. This is where you belong. You have to believe that the hospital will be able to treat you.\u201d</p><br/><p>The patient replied, \u201cI am not going back. He is a godly doctor. A lot of patients have recovered after coming here. They\u2019ve been discharged. I\u2019m definitely not leaving.\u201d</p><br/><p>The nurse hurriedly said, \u201cNo, their identities are unknown. All of you shouldn\u2019t believe in them.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Director was extremely cautious. He looked at these three young people and the old man beside them. The main thing was that the old man wasn\u2019t the one treating the illnesses. How real could it have been?</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is my medical certificate,\u201d Lin Fan took it out.</p><br/><p>The Director looked at it closely and realized that it was real. However, he still didn\u2019t believe in him. It wasn\u2019t that difficult to make a fake certificate that looked real.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care. I\u2019m going to call the police for them to handle this. I don\u2019t care if you guys are real or fake. You can\u2019t be harming people. If you delay their treatment time, are you going to be responsible for that?\u201d the Director said sternly.</p><br/><p>The patients couldn\u2019t stay there and do nothing. The previous patients had been completely healed by this godly doctor and they had witnessed the changes. Now that the Director was there asking him to leave, they couldn\u2019t bear to see him go. If this godly doctor really left, where could they go to seek treatment?</p><br/><p>\u201cDirector, can you guys leave? We are here to seek treatment. You guys don\u2019t have a say in this. I spent $60k on the hospital bills but what is the end result? I\u2019m still hospitalized. You gotta give us some hope.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, we\u2019re not blind. We know if it\u2019s real or fake. I am a farmer and I spent all my life savings on your hospital bills. If you\u2019re asking us to return to the hospital and give this a miss, are you going to give us free treatment?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, godly doctor, ignore them. They are heartless people. Now that the godly doctor is here, they want you to leave. They just want us to stay in the hospital and take all our money. In the end, we won\u2019t be cured and we\u2019ll only be waiting for death.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was a little helpless. What could he say? If someone were to be hospitalized for a serious condition, the hospital bills would have been sky high.</p><br/><p>However, he couldn\u2019t say that the Director was unreasonable. If the patients didn\u2019t have money to pay, the hospital allowed for delayed payment.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing took out his certificates. \u201cI am Zhao Ming Qing, from the Chinese Medical Association. These are my certifications, you can have a look.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Director took his certificates and his face changed a little. One certificate was from the Chinese Medical Association and the other one was from Shanghai\u2019s First Chinese Medical Academy. It couldn\u2019t have been fake.</p><br/><p>He spoke with a more neutral tone, \u201cDirector Zhao, if you come to our hospital\u2019s Chinese medicine department to be a doctor, we\u2019ll welcome you. However, if you are to treat patients here at the entrance of the hospital, that would be wrong.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing replied, \u201cWhy is it wrong? The hospital treats patients and we\u2019re here to treat patients too. It\u2019s the same thing. What difference is there?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qiu Jie was a young chap and he was a little emotional. He said unhappily, \u201cOur Teacher Lin has treated a lot of patients and he didn\u2019t charge any money. You guys saw his certification and we have proven our identities. If you don\u2019t want us to stay here, it just shows that you\u2019re afraid of the hospital losing money since we\u2019ll treat all the patients here.\u201d</p><br/><p>When he said that, the hospital\u2019s Director became furious. He felt that it was too infuriating.</p><br/><p>Zhang Tong Tong dragged Qiu Jie aside. She also felt that his words were too harsh.</p><br/><p>However, Qiu Jie didn\u2019t feel that there was a problem. \u201cI didn\u2019t say anything wrong. The hospital is here to save people. We\u2019re saving people too. Furthermore, they\u2019d be spending a lot of money and they might not even be cured. We use Chinese medicine to cure them of their diseases. Why do you want us to leave? You\u2019re just afraid of losing all your sources of income when we treat all the patients.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d The male doctor behind the hospital\u2019s Director said.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved his hand, \u201cAlright, stop arguing. Director, tell us what you want us to do then.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Director said seriously, \u201cYou guys are kind-hearted. However, this is a hospital. You guys are affecting the operations of the hospital. At the same time, it will create a negative impact on them. I hope you guys can change locations. Is that okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s reasonable,\u201d Lin Fan nodded. \u201cHowever, I feel that it\u2019s not possible. Today, I am here to treat everyone. Now, could you guys return to the hospital? Is that okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing and the others remained silent. They left everything to their mentor.</p><br/><p>Regardless of anything that happened, they would definitely be on their mentor\u2019s side.</p><br/><p>The patients\u2019 family members were anxious, \u201cCan these doctors please return back? The godly doctor is giving us free treatment. We\u2019re not affecting you in any way. Why are you chasing them away? I will record this down and post it online. You\u2019ll see what happens.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. Our situations haven\u2019t improved since we\u2019ve been hospitalized here. Furthermore, our money has been drained like water. Can you please let us be treated here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re not leaving, we\u2019ll all be against you.\u201d</p><br/><p>The patients were extremely agitated. It was as if they were going to kill the Director\u2019s team if they didn\u2019t leave.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked and smiled. \u201cEveryone, I suggest you leave. It\u2019s okay. The hospital is just here and if anything happens, you can still come to the rescue.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Director furrowed his brows and turned away.</p><br/><p>However, he wasn\u2019t going to let them off like that.</p><br/><p>\u201cGo, call the city enforcement officers.\u201d The Director didn\u2019t want to care about it anymore. He wanted the city enforcement team to take over this matter.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, let\u2019s continue,\u201d Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing and the others weren\u2019t really affected by this. They just did what they needed to do.</p><br/><p>They recorded everything that was happening. This information would definitely be beneficial to their learning.</p><br/><p>The patients were extremely excited. They finally saw a glimpse of hope.</p><br/><p>They had seen at the positive changes of the patients that had already been treated by the godly doctor.</p><br/><p>However, not long after, something happened again.</p><br/><p>A city enforcement vehicle stopped nearby.</p><br/><p>Then, four city enforcement officers alighted. They came over immediately after receiving the call. They received information that people were treating illnesses at the entrance of the hospital. Was that a joke?</p><br/><p>However, when they came to the scene, they laughed. There were three young people with an elderly man.</p><br/><p>They were definitely going to confiscate their tools and close the booth.</p></div>\n</div>"}

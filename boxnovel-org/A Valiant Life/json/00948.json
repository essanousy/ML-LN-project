I\u2019ll treat him well,\u201d said Zheng Zhong Shan. he had some faith in this disciple of Elder Lin\u2019s. His medical ability was indeed exceptional.</p><br/><p><em>Famous teachers produce great disciples. Their medical abilities are both very powerful.</em></p><div class=\"code-block code-block-2\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Then, they exchanged a few more words before hanging up.</p><br/><p>Afterward, Lin Fan looked at what class of knowledge he had unlocked for the twenty-first page.</p><br/><p>With one look, he was completely speechless.</p><br/><p>Piano class of knowledge.</p><br/><p>\u201cMotherf*cker. This really caught me unprepared.\u201d Lin Fan sighed. The Encyclopedia had always been good but now, it had given him a not so good class of knowledge. But it didn\u2019t matter. He decided to just use it accordingly. After all, he already had enough knowledge.</p><br/><p><em>We\u2019ve gotten such a good relationship but you still give me such a useless thing. What a shame.</em></p><br/><p>The task was rather simple. It was based on Nanshan Children\u2019s Welfare Institute again and he had to make 30 children understand the knowledge.</p><br/><p>This was a very low difficulty task. Perhaps you could even say that there was no difficulty at all.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-3\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>The next day!</p><br/><p>The reporters had stayed at the hospital for a long time the previous day, pestering the doctors with questions. They had even gotten hold of the nurses to ask questions. Some of the nurses had been a little nervous facing so many reporters. And since they would be able to go on the news, they had naturally felt very excited.</p><br/><p>They had answered whatever questions the reporters asked without any reserve.</p><br/><p>And the reporters were very content as they had managed to obtain all the content that they wanted. However, they just felt that it didn\u2019t make sense. But since the doctors and nurses had guaranteed it confidently, they believed them.</p><br/><p>On the Internet, the news was released.</p><br/><p>\u2018Master Lin appears in the hospital and saves his beloved disciple, Zhao Ming Qing.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Zhao Ming Qing\u2019s organs were failing and he was on the verge of death but Master Lin pulls him back. What kind of secret is hidden within this?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Breaking! Master Lin actually did such a thing to Zhao Ming Qing\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Godly Doctor Master Lin performs yet another miracle! You have to be convinced of his prowess.\u2019</p><br/><p>When the news came out, many netizens were astounded. Below the articles, they commented maniacally.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-4\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cF*ck, this is way too unreal. He was about to die but Master Lin brought him back?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShow us a picture. All this is made up. Editor, if you don\u2019t become a fictional writer, it would be a waste of your talent.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m a nurse from that hospital. I can testify that all this is true. Director Zhao Ming Qing was really on the verge of death but when Master Lin came, he managed to save him through unknown means. Afterward, when we wanted to do a full-body check on the patient, Master Lin declined. Hence, we don\u2019t know exactly what happened.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c^Is that true?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true. If there\u2019s even half a false sentence, then let the thunder strike me.\u201d</p><br/><p>In the past year or so, the netizens had seen way too many news articles that defied common logic. There had been so many that they felt that they didn\u2019t live in the same world anymore.</p><br/><p>Master Lin had come from nowhere and performed all kinds of shocking feats. They had become so shocked that they had started to become suspicious of life.</p><br/><p>Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian and the rest hadn\u2019t seen Lin Fan in a long time. The news of the Internet let them know that the matter had been resolved.</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang said, \u201cBrother Lin is way too amazing. He actually managed to save Director Zhao.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan smiled proudly. \u201cOf course. Don\u2019t you know who Brother Lin is? This isn\u2019t hard for him at all.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian was a little dumbfounded. He couldn\u2019t understand it. Thinking about it, it seemed that there really was nothing that the kid couldn\u2019t do.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-5\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it? What are you all talking about?\u201d Lin Fan appeared at the entrance.</p><br/><p>When Wu You Lan saw Lin Fan, she pounced forward excitedly and grabbed his arm. \u201cBrother Lin, we were discussing what you did yesterday!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was startled, then he said with a smile, \u201cWhat\u2019s there to discuss? I just took a look at Weibo. Lots of netizens are commenting on it. This time, I\u2019ve gone viral unknowingly once again. I\u2019m a little embarrassed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan laughed gently. She felt that Brother Lin was showing off subtly.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Lin, could it be that you want to enter the entertainment circle in future? You\u2019re even more popular than some superstars now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shrugged. \u201cThat\u2019s nothing. I\u2019m more popular than lots of superstars already.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian said, \u201cLet\u2019s not talk about all this for now. The townsfolk have been waiting for a long time. You\u2019ve disappeared for so many days and they think that you\u2019ve run away.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRun away? Am I the kind of person that would run away? Don\u2019t talk rubbish. Hurry up and spread the word. We\u2019re officially open for business!\u201d declared Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>When the townsfolk found out that they were selling scallion pancakes once again, they were delighted. Although they hadn\u2019t been able to buy scallion pancakes for the past few days, they knew that it was because Master Lin had been busy, so they could understand.</p><br/><p>After work.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-6\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Lin Fan lay on the chair, playing with his phone.</p><br/><p>Weibo.</p><br/><p>The netizens were discussing the previous day\u2019s incident. Lin Fan took a look at the comments and didn\u2019t want to say much. There was really nothing much to say.</p><br/><p>After all, even if he said the truth, people definitely wouldn\u2019t believe him.</p><br/><p>*Ding ding*</p><br/><p>At that moment, a call from Zhao Ming Qing came.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan answered, \u201cWhat\u2019s the situation, Ming Qing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, I\u2019ve come across a difficulty. I can\u2019t figure it out,\u201d said Zhao Ming Qing. When he saw the big shot this time, he had been stunned. Thereafter, he had a rather large pressure on him.</p><br/><p>\u201cSay it. What\u2019s the difficulty?\u201d asked Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Then, Zhao Ming Qing explained the situation. He also described the patient\u2019s condition clearly. After thinking for a bit, Lin Fan answered his questions clearly.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-7\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>With Lin Fan\u2019s words of guidance, Zhao Ming Qing was enlightened and instantly understood the idea behind it.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was pleased. What was the point of him going there? Just handing the job over to Zhao Ming Qing was good enough. Otherwise, he would have to travel here and there. It would be too d*mn tiring.</p><br/><p>And this would also help to raise Zhao Ming Qing\u2019s medical ability greatly. Why shouldn\u2019t he do it?</p><br/><p><em>Although it\u2019s tiring, this is your teacher nurturing you!</em></p><br/><p>This was how Lin Fan thought. And it was the most reasonable explanation.</p><br/><p>As for whether Ming Qing thought the same way, it didn\u2019t concern him.</p><br/><p>After a period of time.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing returned from Beijing. The outcome of the treatment had been great. Although he had spent quite some time, he had also learned a lot.</p><br/><p>And Lin Fan was very pleased with the medical fees that Zhao Ming Qing had brought back from Beijing as well. It seemed that what he had said previously had been useful.</p><br/><p>But when he heard Zhao Ming Qing say who the patient was, Lin Fan wasn\u2019t too bothered. It didn\u2019t matter who it was. It didn\u2019t concern Lin Fan at all.</p><br/><p>However, after Zhao Ming Qing returned, something that would trouble Lin Fan happened.</p></div>\n</div>"}

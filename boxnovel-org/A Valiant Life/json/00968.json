In that instant, he was startled. Then, he asked his followers who were beside him.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat Chinese medicine master does his research here?\u201d He could not quite believe it. To him, this looked like a commercial street.</p><br/><p>In such a noisy place, how would one be able to conduct research?</p><br/><p>That follower was a Chinese man but he had always lived overseas, so he didn\u2019t know what was going on either. But according to his research, it seemed to be the case, so he nodded.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-2\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cThis is the place,\u201d he said firmly.</p><br/><p>Edward didn\u2019t say much else but he was still doubtful.</p><br/><p>The reporters who were following heard their discussion and almost couldn\u2019t help bursting into laughter.</p><br/><p><em>Research?</em></p><br/><p><em>Research my a*s! This is a commercial street and Master Lin sells his scallion pancakes here.</em></p><br/><p>Then, Edward realized that there were many people queueing up. The queue snaked all the way to the end of the street.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are they doing?\u201d asked Edward.</p><br/><p>That follower didn\u2019t understand it. He didn\u2019t stay here, how would he know?</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-3\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>But the reporters started to express their willingness to help as they softly explained, \u201cChairman Edward, these people are all waiting for Master Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Edward heard that, he came to a realization. \u201cSo that\u2019s it. Master Lin possesses such medical prowess but doesn\u2019t immerse himself in his research lab. Instead, he comes out to treat the people\u2019s illnesses. That is truly admirable.\u201d</p><br/><p>When the reporters heard that, they laughed embarrassedly and didn\u2019t say more. They decided to let the big shot think whatever he wanted. They would be able to see Master Lin soon anyway.</p><br/><p>They only hoped that when that happened, he would not be too agitated.</p><br/><p>The queuing townsfolk were stunned when they saw the reporters and they were filled with curiosity.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you think these people are here for? Why do I suddenly feel as if Master Lin\u2019s place is frequented by reporters a lot.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho knows? That\u2019s really scary. I think that in the future, if we come across any injustice and we want to look for reporters, we should just wait here at Master Lin\u2019s place. Reporters would definitely show up after a while.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt looks like these reporters are reporters from large news agencies. They\u2019re much more impressive than those small-fry reporters.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLook at that old man. His aura doesn\u2019t seem normal.\u201d</p><br/><p>The crowd whispered amongst themselves. They had come to queue even without much hope of getting the scallion pancakes. They just wanted to feel the atmosphere as they queued.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-4\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>And if they became lucky and suddenly managed to buy the scallion pancake, that would really be like hitting the jackpot.</p><br/><p>Now that the reporters had come, they were very curious.</p><br/><p>Edward was quite excited as he was about to meet the Chinese medicine master who had conquered leukemia. Facing a true scientist, he would always show his best side.</p><br/><p>After all, he had the highest respect for scientists.</p><br/><p>Suddenly!</p><br/><p>When he reached the place, he was astonished.</p><br/><p>\u201cBe patient. It is limited to ten servings a day. If you don\u2019t want to queue, take a look at the poster on the wall. Anyone interested can take a look.\u201d Lin Fan was making his scallion pancakes skillfully. An aroma filled the air that made it hard for the townsfolk to resist.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Lin Fan saw the reporters too and he was curious. He wondered why these reporters were here again. But now, he was still busy working, so he waved his hand and said, \u201cPlease wait a moment. Let me finish preparing the scallion pancakes.</p><br/><p>Edward was a little confused. He asked, \u201cIs this the Chinese medicine master, Lin Fan?\u201d</p><br/><p>His tone was one of disbelief because this was completely unlike what he had imagined.</p><br/><p>The reporters nodded. \u201cYes, this is Master Lin. But please wait a moment. Master Lin is selling scallion pancakes. He\u2019ll be done in a while.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut really, Master Lin\u2019s scallion pancakes are delicious. Once you eat it once, you\u2019ll definitely want it a second time.\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-5\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Edward was shocked. He even started stuttering a little as he didn\u2019t know what to say. His eyes gaped as he stared at the reporters.</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t Master Lin the Chinese medicine master? This\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporters nodded. \u201cYeah! He\u2019s the Chinese medicine master. But Master Lin\u2019s main profession is a scallion pancake seller. Chinese medicine is his secondary profession.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing that, Edward was completely dumbfounded.</p><br/><p><em>What did these reporters just say?</em></p><br/><p><em>Main profession and secondary profession?</em></p><br/><p><em>Scientist?</em></p><br/><p><em>This\u2026</em></p><br/><p>Soon, Lin Fan was done selling the scallion pancakes. He picked up the cloth and wiped his hands before nodding at the reporters, indicating that they could come now.</p><br/><p>The townsfolk who hadn\u2019t managed to buy the scallion pancakes were feeling helpless. They had failed yet again.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-6\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>But the current situation made them very curious. They wondered what these people were here for. Every time reporters came, something big would definitely happen.</p><br/><p>Edward, under the beckoning of the reporters, walked over slowly and stiffly.</p><br/><p>A reporter said, \u201cMaster Lin, this is the Nobel Foundation Chairman, Mister Edward. He came over from Sweden to give you the award.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan heard that, he was surprised. He hadn\u2019t expected the chairman to personally come to him. Then, he extended his hand and smiled. \u201cNice to meet you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Edward gained back his senses when he saw Lin Fan\u2019s extended hand. \u201cNice to meet you, Master Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>Greasy and scallion-smelling.</p><br/><p>This was Edward\u2019s first impression.</p><br/><p>He was trying to find all kinds of ways to make sense of this situation.</p><br/><p>For example, scientists all had strange working styles.</p><br/><p>Perhaps this Chinese medicine master enjoyed selling scallion pancakes after finishing his research.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-7\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>The surrounding townsfolk heard the exchange of words and were stunned.</p><br/><p>They hadn\u2019t thought that the Nobel Foundation Chairman would personally come to Shanghai to present the award to Master Lin. To them, this was a huge event.</p><br/><p>At that moment, many people took out their phones and started capturing photos and videos. They wanted to share this within their social circles.</p><br/><p>Then, Lin Fan didn\u2019t know what else to say.</p><br/><p>How are you?</p><br/><p>I\u2019m great.</p><br/><p>What was there to say after that?</p><br/><p>Edward was silent for a moment as well. He hadn\u2019t expected that Lin Fan would not spontaneously start a conversation. In the end, he had no choice but to speak first.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, we are truly sorry. It\u2019s because we didn\u2019t investigate properly that we made an unfair judgment. We hope that you could forgive the Nobel Foundation\u2019s mistake,\u201d said Edward sincerely.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing. Don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d Lin Fan smiled. He wasn\u2019t even bothered by this matter. Then, he gestured. \u201cCome in and talk.\u201d</p><br/><p>The shop wasn\u2019t big but the environment was pretty good.</p><br/><p>Edward could read Chinese characters. He looked at the prizes that were hung on the wall and was taken aback. There were many Good Citizen Awards as well as a banner.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-8\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Such things were commonly seen in the offices of scientists but mostly, they were science-related awards. It was rare to see these kinds of awards.</p><br/><p>To him, this Master Lin was very different from other scientists.</p></div>\n</div>"}

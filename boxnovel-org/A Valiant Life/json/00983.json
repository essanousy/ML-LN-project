There were many members who had a beneficial relationship as well as a relationship as a student with him.</p><br/><p>If he did not give Zhang Guo Shou any face, it would be like not giving the whole association any face at all which would have a huge impact on the association.</p><br/><p>This kind of problem exists in all kinds of places. People want to initiate reforms but it implicates the interests of the people. As a result, some of the older generations would stand up and appeal to the community to resist these changes. This sort of thinking causes people to be stuck in the same spot.</p><br/><p>In the eyes of the people, Lin Fan\u2019s medical prowess was truly amazing. However, in the association, he still was not even at the level of an ordinary member. Especially now that Zhang Guo Shou was going against him, it made it even tougher.</p><br/><p>He could not complete with Zhang Guo Shou as he had to respect the previous generation. If he were to just remove Zhang Guo Shou just like that, it would definitely break a lot of hearts.</p><br/><p>However, regrettably, Lin Fan\u2019s brain did not work that way. He did not care about interpersonal relationships. With regards to the previous generation, he would naturally respect whoever was worth respecting. But if they were to use their seniority to try and impede him, he would not hold back against them.</p><br/><p>On the news!</p><br/><p>The reporters were all extremely shocked after what had happened last night. At the same time, they felt like Master Lin was really too wild. He was simply too ruthless.</p><br/><p>\u2018Former Vice-Chairman of the Chinese Medical Academy, Zhang Guo Shou, has his withdrawal request from the association accepted by Master Lin.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Swift and decisive. Reforms are necessary and Master Lin won\u2019t let anyone stop him.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Zhang Guo Shou thought that he had a high place in Master Lin\u2019s heart but gets utterly embarrassed.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Master Lin is a man on a mission and won\u2019t get threatened by anyone.\u2019</p><br/><p>The news headlines were all reporting last night\u2019s incident.</p><br/><p>At the same time, whatever Zhang Guo Shou had said on the programme yesterday had been recorded into a small clip. It was posted online and was being transmitted around.</p><br/><p>This was a totally negative example of what to do. He had initially made himself seem so firm and heroic by giving that speech, only to be embarrassed by Master Lin on Weibo while later.</p><br/><p>The netizens that saw this all sneered, scoffed, and could not stop themselves from laughing.</p><br/><p>In his mansion.</p><br/><p>Zhang Guo Shou laid down on his head. His son, Zhang Han, was by his side, filled with anger.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis rascal really doesn\u2019t know good from bad,\u201d Zhang Guo Shou sternly said. His expression was so gloomy that it was terrifying The events that had happened during the program yesterday had dealt a huge blow on him. He felt like he was a clown.</p><br/><p>He was the former Vice-Chairman of the Chinese Medical Academy. Although he was already retired, he still had his dignity and he also had a pretty high standing in the association. However, right now, he had been treated like this by some young rascal and he did not know how to show his face anymore.</p><br/><p>\u201cDad, what are we going to do now? That rascal really did not give you any face at all,\u201d Zhang Han said.</p><br/><p>\u201cPublic opinion. We will use the public\u2019s opinion to discredit him. Help me to find someone in public relations, tell them I\u2026\u201d Zhang Guo Shou went into deep thought for a moment and then thought of an idea.</p><br/><p>Zhang Han listened to his idea and kept nodding his head. Inside, he could not help getting a little excited.</p><br/><p>It was a good idea.</p><br/><p>Nanshan Children\u2019s Welfare Institute.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was sitting on the stage and was playing the piano. The children who were sitting below and listening were all moved. In the entire classroom, besides the sound of the piano, not a single sound could be heard.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at his progress for the task and realized that he was still short of a few. However, he was not in a rush and was okay with just finishing it slowly.</p><br/><p>*Ring ring*</p><br/><p>His phone rang.</p><br/><p>When he saw the caller ID, he saw that it was Zhou Qing Quan calling. Then, he motioned to the children to practice by themselves as he walked out of the room.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello? Elder Zhou, what\u2019s up?\u201d Lin Fan asked.</p><br/><p>Zhou Qing Quan knew all about what had happened last night. He knew all about the things that Zhang Guo Shou had said on the programme and the things that Lin Fan had said on Weibo.</p><br/><p>After all of that, he only had one thought. Master Lin was really too ruthless. Even he was starting to get scared of Master Lin.</p><br/><p>When most people go about to do things, they would usually try and appease other people.</p><br/><p>However, when Master Lin was doing things, he did not care about other people at all. If he wanted to do something, he would do it. Regardless of what your background was, if you tried to stop him, he would crush you.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, the people that you called out to withdraw from the association have all come to find me and they are all trying to protest. Elder Wang is handling them now and it is causing a huge headache,\u201d Zhou Qian Quan said.</p><br/><p>The dozens of people from last night were really unlucky. They probably had not thought that Master Lin would immediately remove them from the association.</p><br/><p>After all, when it came to this kind of situation, a normal person would definitely try and defuse the situation and not do anything rash.</p><br/><p>However, none of them had expected that Master Lin would not bother trying to console them and would just agree with what they wanted straight away. This had given them no chance to react and no room to protest at all.</p><br/><p>When he heard this, Lin Fan momentarily laughed. \u201cThese people are really funny. They said that they wanted to withdraw from the association and after I agreed to their request, they protest? Tell them that what I said is final. Although the association may have fewer people, we definitely won\u2019t be lacking in people.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Qing Quan replied, \u201cGot it, I\u2019ll pass the message to them and I won\u2019t care about them anymore. Oh, also, the people over at Zhang Guo Shou\u2019s side aren\u2019t taking this too well. There are people in leadership positions who have let me know their opinion on this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cWho said it? Give me their numbers and I\u2019ll deal with them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGot it. I can\u2019t handle them anymore.\u201d That was exactly what Zhou Qing Quan had wanted to hear. Although he was the previous Chairman of the association, he was not as overbearing as Master Lin in handling this kind of situations.</p><br/><p>Master Lin was not afraid of offending people but he was. Other people did not dare to offend Master Lin but they dared to offend him.</p><br/><p>After saying those few sentences, they hung up the phone.</p><br/><p>Then, Lin Fan received a text message.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the message on his phone and immediately dialed the number on it.</p><br/><p>In a certain unit, there was a leader who was handling his business. With regards to the Chinese Medical Academy situation, he felt that Master Lin\u2019s method of dealing with the situation was not right and that it was too extreme.</p><br/><p>Zhang Guo Shou was part of the previous generation of Chinese medicine doctors, he was also a veteran of the association. To just remove him like that would definitely make people feel terrified.</p><br/><p>Although he did not care about this kind of situation, as a leader, he felt like he had to come out and give a piece of his mind to Zhou Qing Quan.</p><br/><p>*Ding ding*</p><br/><p>At this moment, his phone rang. He did not give it much thought and just picked up the phone. Before he could even say a word, a sound came from the other end of the line.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello, I am Lin Fan, the Chairman of the Chinese Medical Academy. I must say, your hands must be really long to meddle all the way into my affairs, don\u2019t they?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet me tell you this. Just care about your own things. Don\u2019t be such a busybody, got it?\u201d</p><br/><p>The leader was dumbfounded. Getting attacked immediately after picking up the phone. He had been attacked to the point that he did not even dare to fight back.</p><br/><p>\u201cChairman Lin, it\u2019s a misunderstanding.\u201d With regards to Master Lin, he was quite familiar with what kind of person he was. He definitely should not provoke him as it would definitely not turn out well.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cDon\u2019t say it\u2019s a misunderstanding. Just take care of your own business. The business here at the Chinese Medical Academy is none of your business so I don\u2019t need you to care about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>*Beep beep*</p><br/><p>He immediately hung up the phone.</p><br/><p>At this point in time, he had to be firm. He did not have time to talk about any emotions.</p></div>\n</div>"}

The workers all looked ashamed.</p><br/><p>Zhang Zhi Jun came in front of the boss and bowed in apology. He was very serious and very stern. At that moment, he wasn\u2019t a leader but a father whose son had committed a mistake.</p><br/><p>The boss seemed at a loss. He didn\u2019t know what to do. After all, he knew that this man was a leader. How could he let a leader bow to him?</p><br/><p>However, Zhang Zhi Jun was sincerely apologizing to the boss. He looked over to his son sternly. \u201cCome here. Apologize to this uncle.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo\u2026\u201d The child hid in his mother\u2019s embrace, clearly afraid.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Zhang Zhi Jun\u2019s expression turned cold. The more he interacted with his son, the more he realized how spoiled and out of control his son was.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, the child\u2019s mother had been frightened by her husband\u2019s expression. She reprimanded her son and told him to apologize to the boss. Then, she apologized to the boss as well.</p><br/><p>Although she still felt unyielding, she had no choice. If she didn\u2019t apologize, she knew that she would be in trouble when they went home.</p><br/><p>Zhang Zhi Jun recalled Master Lin\u2019s words and finally made a decision. He was going to apply for a suspension from his duties or a change in appointment in order to free up his time and personally look after his son\u2019s education.</p><br/><p>When he said these, even though his wife begged him not to, it was useless.</p><br/><p>To the middle-aged woman, if her husband were to change appointments or be suspended from his duties, that would have a great impact on them.</p><br/><p>But hearing her husband\u2019s tone, she knew that he had probably already decided. He wouldn\u2019t change his decision.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan, who had left the shop, felt great. Because of that brat, he was no longer keen to go outside to look around anymore.</p><br/><p>Looking at the time, it was already half past five. It wasn\u2019t early anymore. He went straight home. The next day, he would look around Shanghai.</p><br/><p>The next day!</p><br/><p>Cloud Street!</p><br/><p>No matter what, the first task of each day was to go to the shop and make the scallion pancakes. After all, the townsfolk would always be waiting for him.</p><br/><p>Moreover, he was a kindhearted person. He would never be lazy. As the saying goes, whatever you do, you have to love it. That\u2019s what life is about.</p><br/><p>He unlocked his phone and discovered a piece of news. It was the incident that he had encountered the previous day. However, this incident had not been exposed by others.</p><br/><p>It had been Zhang Zhi Jun who exposed it himself. He had undergone a deep reflection and publicly announced the situation.</p><br/><p>To Lin Fan, this Zhang Zhi Jun was pretty good. However, sometimes, one has to choose between work and family. And this Zhang Zhi Jun had chosen his family.</p><br/><p>Perhaps to him, his family was much more important than his work.</p><br/><p>*Ding ding*</p><br/><p>At that moment, his phone rang.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the display on the phone and was a little hesitant about whether to answer. It was a call from his student and he felt that it was probably not something good.</p><br/><p>But after some consideration, he decided to answer.</p><br/><p>\u201cMing Qing\u2026\u201d Lin Fan didn\u2019t dare to say much. He had a feeling that something bad was awaiting him.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing said, \u201cTeacher, I want to talk to you about something.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan grumbled in his heart. He felt that something wasn\u2019t right. What he was most afraid of hearing was \u2018Teacher, let\u2019s carry on developing prescriptions.\u2019</p><br/><p>This was what he least wanted to hear. He felt that it was terrifying.</p><br/><p><em>Stay calm. I have to stay calm.</em></p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, tell me. What is it?\u201d asked Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing replied, \u201cTeacher, we\u2019ve already rested for a period of time. Isn\u2019t it time to start researching other prescriptions?\u201d</p><br/><p>When these words were said, Lin Fan didn\u2019t know what to reply. It was indeed what he had been afraid of.</p><br/><p>\u201cMing Qing, what you\u2019re saying is true but I\u2019ve been busy lately. I may not have the time. Why don\u2019t you start researching first? If you come across difficulties, you can ask me,\u201d said Lin Fan helplessly. This student of his was too hard working. His student was basically engrossed in medical studies every day.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, I\u2019m already researching but I haven\u2019t found any good leads at all. I think that if I research with Teacher, we\u2019ll definitely be able to open up new doorways,\u201d said Zhao Ming Qing.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan rolled his eyes. He hadn\u2019t expected his student to have been so prepared.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait a while more. Let me finish my work during this period of time first.\u201d</p><br/><p>Right now, that was all he could say.</p><br/><p>Hearing his teacher give in, Zhao Ming Qing was delighted. \u201cOkay, okay. Please finish your work first then, Teacher.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, they hung up.</p><br/><p>There wasn\u2019t much to do in the shop at the moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou guys stay in the shop. I\u2019m going out for a walk.\u201d Lin Fan stood up to leave. Waiting all day in the shop for something to happen wasn\u2019t going to work. He had to rely on himself to get the task done.</p><br/><p>Heng Jiang Public Square.</p><br/><p>There were many people here. After parking the car, Lin Fan went to the place with the most people, searching for suitable people.</p><br/><p>He would look at every person that passed by but he didn\u2019t pay attention to those who lived comfortable lives.</p><br/><p>At that moment, a certain figure drew Lin Fan\u2019s attention.</p><br/><p>In front, a man who had lost both legs was sitting on a wooden cart. One of his hands was grabbing onto a shared-bike while the other was supporting himself on the ground. He rolled around, dragging the bicycle from afar to place it along the wall.</p><br/><p>As Lin Fan sat there and watched, he had no idea what this man was doing.</p><br/><p>At that moment, a cleaner passed by and Lin Fan asked, \u201cMay I know what he\u2019s doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>The cleaner said, \u201cOh, he\u2019s bringing damaged shared-bikes over here for the employees from bike-sharing company to bring them back for repair.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan asked, \u201cThen does the bike-sharing company pay him?\u201d</p><br/><p>The cleaner was taken aback. Then, he smiled and said, \u201cHow could they pay him? They didn\u2019t even hire him. But it\u2019s really strange. I\u2019ve been here for a couple of months and I see him every day, bringing bicycles from god-knows-where over here to pile them up. Even when it rains, he still does it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh right. He\u2019s deaf-mute. He\u2019s usually always around here. Sometimes, when passersby pity him, they\u2019d give him some money and some people even give him some food.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded. He thanked the worker before walking in front.</p><br/><p>He wanted to get closer to take a clearer look.</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan went closer, he managed to see the tramp\u2019s face clearly. Although the tramp\u2019s clothes were old and tattered, he had maintained his cleanliness.</p><br/><p>At that moment, the tramp had relied on his two hands to place the bicycle properly. Then, he picked up the bicycles that had fallen to the ground as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello.\u201d Lin Fan went in front of him and extended his hand. He put on a smile.</p><br/><p>The tramp was startled as he looked at Lin Fan in surprise. Although he couldn\u2019t hear what this person was saying, to him, this normal action of extending one\u2019s hand was the friendliest gesture.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p></div>\n</div>"}

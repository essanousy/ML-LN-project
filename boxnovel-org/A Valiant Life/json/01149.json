Those sales agents were all sending feedback to their companies, saying that Master Lin\u2019s perfect artificial limbs had been developed.</p><br/><p>They only cost three thousand dollars. It was too big of a hit for the companies. They couldn\u2019t sell their products at all because the citizens were all waiting for those perfect artificial limbs.</p><br/><p>On a certain artificial limb forum.</p><br/><p>Disabled people from all over the country were gathered on this forum to discuss the quality of different brands of artificial limbs. They would also talk about how to repair certain problems with their artificial limbs.</p><br/><p>There were also some recently crippled people who had been unable to accept the reality of their situation. But when they started getting involved in this forum, they found a place of belonging.</p><br/><p>On top of that, there were some kind people who appeared on the forum to provide counseling for the disabled people and alleviate their psychological troubles.</p><br/><p>However, there was a certain thread today which had been pushed to the top of the forum. Countless people were commenting on it.</p><br/><p>\u201cHave you guys taken a look at Weibo? Master Lin\u2019s perfect artificial limbs are going to be released.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI saw it. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fake. It was posted by Shanghai\u2019s official Weibo account. Moreover, they are manufacturing it in collaboration with Eastern Han Organization. I saw the video too but I\u2019m a little doubtful. Are they really as good as the video shows?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m very curious too. The scenes shown in the video were way too shocking. I don\u2019t even dare to believe it. Can artificial limbs really be so nimble?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDefinitely. I trust Master Lin. Moreover, this was posted by the government, it definitely can\u2019t be a false advertisement. I\u2019m just eagerly waiting right now. When will these perfect artificial limbs be released? Three thousand dollars is way too cheap. It\u2019s truly a generous price. Compared to those artificial limbs that sell for tens of thousands, this is much better.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah! I bought an artificial limb for over thirty thousand dollars and it still has all kinds of problems. Putting it on is so tiring. I can\u2019t tolerate it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSome families are very poor. Those who can\u2019t afford artificial limbs have no choice but to remain immobile. But now that these artificial limbs are going to be sold for three thousand dollars, it wouldn\u2019t be a problem at all. And if you ask me, the government and Eastern Han Organization will probably have policies to take care of those financially needy disabled people.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin is really too awesome. In the past, he conquered different kinds of diseases. Now, he has developed artificial limbs. I don\u2019t even know what to say anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m a fan of Master Lin. Actually, I knew that this would happen long ago and I\u2019ve just been waiting for it. My mother wanted to buy artificial limbs for me but I declined. I was waiting for Master Lin\u2019s perfect artificial limbs to be developed. It seems that it hasn\u2019t been in vain. I\u2019m thrilled!\u201d</p><br/><p>On the forum, the netizens were discussing intensely. Over here, all of them were in the same situation and they didn\u2019t feel inferior. No one would look down on them.</p><br/><p>Now that Master Lin had developed perfect artificial limbs, they felt very hopeful.</p><br/><p>Cloud Street!</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was lying there when his phone suddenly rang.</p><br/><p>When he saw that it was an unknown caller, Lin Fan\u2019s brows furrowed as he wondered who it was.</p><br/><p>He answered.</p><br/><p>Before Lin Fan said anything, a voice came through the phone.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re Master Lin, aren\u2019t you? Let me tell you that you will be in trouble. You b*stard, I\u2019ll slash you to death.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRetard.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan immediately hung up. Then, he thought for a moment before picking up his phone and redialing that number.</p><br/><p>The call was answered.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the guy who wants to slash me to death, right? I\u2019m right here at Cloud Street waiting for you. Come and slash me to death then,\u201d said Lin Fan. He hadn\u2019t expected someone to call him and threaten him at such a time.</p><br/><p>Thinking about it, he realized who it was.</p><br/><p>It was obvious whose benefits he had taken away.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou b*stard, I\u2019m warning you to humble yourself. Otherwise, no one will be able to save you.\u201d That voice came through the phone once more.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. \u201cI can\u2019t humble myself, nor do I need anyone to save me. I\u2019m right here at Cloud Street. Come and slash me to death. Are you going to come or not?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust you wait.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019m waiting.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think that I\u2019m kidding you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re kidding me. I think you\u2019re saying the truth.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck your mom. You\u2019re too arrogant.\u201d</p><br/><p>*Clatter!*</p><br/><p>The person on the other end of the call hung up. He seemed furious.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan asked curiously, \u201cBrother Lin, who was that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t know either. He just told me to watch out because he\u2019s coming to slash me to death. But I told him to come. I wonder if he\u2019ll come.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian said helplessly, \u201cSigh. People these days are too violent. Whenever they\u2019re not agreeable with something, they want to slash someone to death. But this guy is really brave. If he really dares to come and slash you, I would respect him for being a brave man.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang said, \u201cFraud, you\u2019re really bad with your words. If Brother Lin gets slashed to death, who\u2019s going to pay your wage?\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian laughed. \u201cYou must be joking. If anyone can slash him to death, I, Fraud, will eat sh*t.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan said worriedly, \u201cBrother Lin, it wouldn\u2019t be a problem, would it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt would.\u201d Lin Fan\u2019s expression was very stern. \u201cJust now, I\u2019ve already been threatened. My life is being threatened. This must be reported to the police. I need to look for the police\u2019s help.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan was stunned. It was as if she didn\u2019t understand what Brother Lin meant. But then, she suddenly understood.</p><br/><p>The next moment, Brother Lin made a call. \u201cHello, is this the police? I just received a threat. Someone said he wants to slash me to death and he told me to watch out. I\u2019m very afraid now. My life is in danger. I\u2019ve already recorded the call. Yes, I will send the recording to you. And I\u2019ll give you his number too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy name is Lin Fan. My identification number is\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The person on the other end of the call said in astonishment, \u201cYou\u2019re Master Lin?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I am. I just received a death threat,\u201d said Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, we\u2019ll look into the location of the caller and identify the owner of that number.\u201d</p><br/><p>At a certain artificial limb company.</p><br/><p>An executive of the company had just put down the phone and felt great.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn. That Lin just has to meddle around every day. He even tried to mess with me. He\u2019s just looking for death. If I don\u2019t scare you to death today, I would eat sh*t.</p><br/><p>\u201cPerfect artificial limbs? Is he trying to screw us over? F*ck. Just thinking about it makes me angry.\u201d</p><br/><p>A Mediterranean man had a fierce expression on his face as he felt an indescribable resentment towards this Master Lin who had gotten in the way of his wealth. If it hadn\u2019t been for this Master Lin, his artificial limb company wouldn\u2019t have turned out like this.</p><br/><p>*Ding ding*</p><br/><p>At that moment, his phone rang. When he looked at it, he saw that the number of the caller was 110.</p><br/><p><em>What the f*ck? Why is the police calling me?</em></p><br/><p>He answered.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello, is this Zhao Da Hai? Please come over to the police station immediately. We have to conduct investigations on you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat for? I didn\u2019t commit any crime.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSomeone reported you for threatening his life through the phone. We need you to cooperate with us.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t do anything wrong. Why should I go?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease come to the police station in the afternoon today and cooperate with us. If we wait until you really commit the crime, a life would have been lost.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck. I\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Da Hai was dumbfounded. <em>What the f*ck is going on? Can\u2019t I even make a call and say some harsh words?</em></p></div>\n</div>"}

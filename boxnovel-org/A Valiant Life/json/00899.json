Everything he fished up was strange and random.</p><br/><p>A ninety-year-old red sage was very different from the red sages they usually had. The difference was like heaven and earth.</p><br/><p>Its effectiveness was extremely high and when used to make medicine, it would become even more terrifying.</p><br/><p>If he continued fishing like this, would he fish up all the ingredients and be able to craft an immortality pill straight away?</p><br/><p>But these were just some of Lin Fan\u2019s thoughts. As of now, he wasn\u2019t sure what he could possibly fish up.</p><br/><p>But what he managed to fish up this time was much better than the previous catch.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-2\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cThis thing, I have to bring it back to study it properly. I didn\u2019t expect that there would be so many treasures here,\u201d said Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Zhao Ming Qing\u2019s phone rang. Upon answering the phone, his expression slowly changed.</p><br/><p>After keeping the ninety-year-old red sage safely, Lin Fan noticed that something wasn\u2019t right with Zhao Ming Qing\u2019s expression. He asked curiously, \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing sighed. \u201cA teacher from the academy just called, saying that the students found out that I\u2019m being replaced and they\u2019re all protesting. He wants me to go back to explain things to the students. And he even said that there are a number of reporters there.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled. \u201cLooks like you\u2019re quite popular. The students can\u2019t bear to see you leave.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, I\u2019ll go back and handle the matter now,\u201d said Zhao Ming Qing. If he didn\u2019t show up personally, the students wouldn\u2019t be able to focus on their studies.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cI\u2019ll go with you to take a look.\u201d</p><br/><p>After trying out the angling major classification of knowledge, Lin Fan knew what he was dealing with now. It was really not bad. Although he wasn\u2019t completely clear about it yet, he had a rough idea.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-3\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>It seemed that in the future, he wouldn\u2019t be able to avoid fishing.</p><br/><p>Shanghai Chinese Medical Academy.</p><br/><p>The teachers were trying to maintain order as they faced the protesting students. They were already a little helpless. Even they were extremely furious about Director Zhao being replaced but there was nothing they could do about it.</p><br/><p>A number of reporters were at the scene, recording everything.</p><br/><p>Their goal this time was simple. It was to expose this matter to the public. To them, there was definitely something going on that the higher-ups were hiding from the public.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe object! We only want Director Zhao!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah! We don\u2019t want any other director, we only want Zhao Ming Qing, Director Zhao!\u201d</p><br/><p>The students were very united as they stood there, shouting their chants. It was as if they wouldn\u2019t back down unless the matter was resolved.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan and Zhao Ming Qing had reached the outside of the school. From far away, they could already hear the protests.</p><br/><p>\u201cLook, Ming Qing. You\u2019re really loved by your students,\u201d said Lin Fan with a grin.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-4\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing felt helpless as he shook his head and sighed. \u201cThese kids\u2026sigh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>When the protesting students saw who had come, they suddenly cried out in surprise.</p><br/><p>\u201cDirector Zhao is here!\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporters quickly looked over and were delighted as well. They hadn\u2019t expected that not only Director Zhao had shown up, even Master Lin was here. Then, they hurriedly ran over.</p><br/><p>The teachers said anxiously, \u201cDirector Zhao, hurry up and explain it to the students. Even the reporters are here. If this gets on the news, it would be bad.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing nodded and raised his hands. \u201cStudents, be quiet. Listen to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>The protesting students quietened down. They really wanted Director Zhao to stay and they did not welcome the new director at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis matter is the organization\u2019s decision. Initially, I was appointed to Jingchuan Chinese Medical University to be the Academy Director but because of my health, it is hard for me to keep going. I\u2019m long past my retirement age, so now, I\u2019ve already applied for retirement. But don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll always be your Academy Director. When I\u2019m free, I\u2019ll come and visit you all. Alright, please disperse and focus on your studies. Work hard on becoming good Chinese doctors\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing could only try and appease the students. Young people weren\u2019t afraid of anything.</p><br/><p>But this matter had already been decided. There was no need to carry on arguing.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, the reporters kept on recording.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan didn\u2019t say a single word. It would be good for Zhao Ming Qing to retire as well so that he could finally relax.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-5\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Those leaders had really made Lin Fan displeased, but for now, he decided not to touch them.</p><br/><p>However, now that the reporters were here, Lin Fan chuckled in his heart. <em>Let me throw you all some dynamites.</em></p><br/><p>Indeed!</p><br/><p>The reporters surrounded Master Lin.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin. What are your thoughts on this matter?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDirector Zhao is your student. Do you think that there is anything wrong with this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Faced with the reporters\u2019 queries, Lin Fan cleared his throat and said, \u201cSince I\u2019m here, then let me say a few words.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFirstly, I am very unhappy. Zhao Ming Qing is my student. When he told me today that he had been sent to Jingchuan Chinese Medical Academy, I did a search on the Internet. It\u2019s more than a thousand kilometers away and I was wondering who was the idiot who gave that order.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy student isn\u2019t young anymore. He\u2019s not as healthy as a young man either. How could they toss him about like that? That\u2019s why I told him to just retire. Since he\u2019s being pushed aside by them, what\u2019s the point of the working so hard for them? It\u2019s better for him to just stay by my side and study Chinese medicine with me.\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporters\u2019 jaws dropped. \u201cMaster Lin, you said that he\u2019s being pushed aside?\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-6\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Lin Fan showed a stunned expression and said in an exaggerated tone, \u201cHuh? What did I say? Pushed aside? I didn\u2019t say anything like that!\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporters felt helpless. <em>You clearly just said that! Why won\u2019t you admit it? </em>But after thinking for a moment, they started laughing.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, then why do you think Director Zhao is being replaced?\u201d asked the reporters once more.</p><br/><p>When Zhao Ming Qing heard his teacher\u2019s words, he had no idea what to say. Although that was the truth, he couldn\u2019t say it so bluntly.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was put in a tough spot. \u201cAbout why he\u2019s being replaced, you shouldn\u2019t ask me. It\u2019s hard for me to say, isn\u2019t it? As for whether it\u2019s because I didn\u2019t hand over the prescription to the higher-ups, I think the possibility isn\u2019t high, so I don\u2019t know either\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporters were speechless.</p><br/><p><em>Don\u2019t be like that, master Lin. You\u2019re telling us the whole situation but you\u2019re still giving us a helpless expression. How respectable.</em></p><br/><p>But to Lin Fan, he could say whatever he wanted. Perhaps others would be afraid, but he wasn\u2019t afraid at all. He was just counterattacking. <em>Let\u2019s see who\u2019s afraid of who!</em></p><br/><p>About Zhao Ming Qing being replaced, he was already very upset.</p><br/><p>Now that the reporters were here, he had to say his share of words.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-7\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The next day!</p><br/><p>The news appeared on the Internet.</p><br/><p>\u2018Director Zhao Ming Qing has been demoted and he has no choice but to retire.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018As a contributor to the development of the leukemia prescription, why was he not promoted but instead demoted? Could it be because Master Lin publicized the prescription on the Internet?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Students can\u2019t bear to see their beloved Director Zhao leave and they start a protest!\u2019</p><br/><p>This news instantly exploded. The hype regarding the prescription hadn\u2019t died down and now that a contributor was being demoted, it instantly drew the attention of the netizens.</p><br/><p>To them, there was definitely some dirty secret involved.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p></div>\n</div>"}

It was a mess. Lin Fan didn\u2019t even know what to say as he felt that it was really strange.</p><br/><p>Many people saw this as a business opportunity. They wanted to collaborate with Master Lin and become distributors of those artificial limbs.</p><br/><p>Thinking about it, there were many disabled people in the country. If they could sell those artificial limbs to all of them, their wealth would blow up.</p><br/><p>Even three thousand dollars was fine. If everyone would buy those artificial limbs, it would add up to a huge amount.</p><br/><p>Moreover, these artificial limbs were so impressive. Their agility was scary. Every disabled person in the country would probably buy at least one set each. Adding all those numbers up, it would really be an insane amount.</p><br/><p>The path to wealth was just in front of them. All that was left was to see if they could grab this opportunity.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan answered so many calls that he was a little dazed. These investment firms were really opportunistic. At such a time, all of them were thinking of getting involved in this. They really had wishful thinking.</p><br/><p>The next day!</p><br/><p>The news on the Internet instantly blew up.</p><br/><p>Reporters were doing a large-scale dissemination of the news shared by the Shanghai government.</p><br/><p>\u2018Perfect artificial limbs have become a reality. Their effectiveness is shocking. These can even be called the King of Artificial Limbs.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018The crippled are in luck. These three-thousand-dollar artificial limbs are extremely functional.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Master Lin has produced a shocking miracle once again. Let us step into Master Lin\u2019s world to see what kind of person Master Lin is.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018The Shanghai government has stated that they will collaborate with Eastern Han Organization to manufacture the perfect artificial limbs so that the crippled citizens can purchase them as soon as possible.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Eight artificial limb companies from all over the country are expressing their protest: \u201cThis is a monopoly! We need to make a living too!\u201d\u2018</p><br/><p>\u2018Bor Artificial Limbs Company has requested for Master Lin to publicize the technology behind the perfect artificial limbs so that they can manufacture them together.\u2019</p><br/><p>In an instant, the news on the Internet had shaken the Earth. Countless people around the country were drawn in by the news.</p><br/><p>Usually, this kind of news wouldn\u2019t draw the attention of many netizens. But because this incident was related to Master Lin, it was sure to make the headlines. ( Boxno vel. co m )</p><br/><p>The most important part was that the product described in the news seemed really high-end. It wasn\u2019t something that could be matched by any of the other current artificial limbs. To the crippled, this was a great cause for celebration.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn. What has happened to this world? How could something so huge happen all of a sudden?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah! Master Lin is really generous. He\u2019s selling those perfect artificial limbs for three thousand dollars. That\u2019s way too cheap.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s expensive. Why can\u2019t it be even cheaper? It looks like he\u2019s trying to earn money again.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c^You\u2019re a f*cking idiot, really. Why don\u2019t you go and take a look at how much those other artificial limbs on the market cost? Moreover, Master Lin even said himself that these artificial limbs cost over two thousand dollars to produce. He\u2019s selling them at three thousand dollars each in order to maintain the flow of production. That\u2019s to pay for the workers\u2019 wages and to buy the raw materials. Why don\u2019t you pay for the workers\u2019 wages instead?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIgnore that guy. I\u2019ve looked through his history of comments. It\u2019s clear that this guy has a mental problem. Nothing he says makes sense.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThese artificial limb companies are really miserable. They used to sell their products at such a high price but now, Master Lin has developed perfect artificial limbs. He\u2019s crushing them in terms of price and in terms of the functionality of the product. I don\u2019t think those companies will be able to last any longer.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis Bor Artificial Limbs Company is really shameless. They even asked Master Lin to publicize the technology. They should just kill themselves.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cActually, this is really a big problem. Let\u2019s see how the government will resolve this. After all, Master Lin\u2019s artificial limbs are too incredible. He\u2019s completely crushing the other artificial limbs on the market. Once those perfect artificial limbs start being manufactured, the other companies will definitely be crushed.\u201d</p><br/><p>In a government unit.</p><br/><p>Secretary Chen was having a headache. It was a joyous thing but even so, it had caused quite a bit of trouble.</p><br/><p>The artificial limb companies from around the country were protesting. He couldn\u2019t just ignore them.</p><br/><p>Other provincial leaders had even called to complain about this situation. After all, those artificial limb companies were established in their provinces. If those companies were to be affected by the perfect artificial limbs, they would definitely become bankrupt. Hence, they were hoping to obtain a more favorable agreement.</p><br/><p>Secretary Chen was thinking about this matter too. He hoped to come up with a good idea to resolve this situation.</p><br/><p>He had thought about publicizing the technology as well. However, it wasn\u2019t realistic. It was okay not to earn money from the buyers in the country. However, whether they would try to earn money from outside the country was a question to be discussed.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang, on the other hand, didn\u2019t bother about this matter. He just wanted to get the factory set up.</p><br/><p>However, Wang Ming Yang had been receiving a lot of calls as well.</p><br/><p>Each of his past business partners had called to inquire. They asked him whether they could invest in this project. They were all directly rejected by him.</p><br/><p>Right now, the plan of collaborating with the government was already very good. They didn\u2019t need anyone else to invest in the project. Moreover, if too many people were to invest in it, things would start to change.</p><br/><p>He could guarantee that nothing would change initially but he couldn\u2019t be sure that nothing would change eventually.</p><br/><p>Wu Yun Gang was far away in Beijing. He called Wang Ming Yang as well. Through the phone, he sounded extremely envious.</p><br/><p>This made Wang Ming Yang quite pleased with himself. After all, his brother trusted him enough to entrust him with such an important task.</p><br/><p>This project had opened up a completely new path for him.</p><br/><p>After chatting to the end, Wu Yun Gang hung up. He knew about Master Lin\u2019s intentions as well, so he didn\u2019t say too much.</p><br/><p>However, he couldn\u2019t quite accept the fact that the artificial limbs would be sold for three thousand dollars each. If they sold it for such a low price, it would feel like a cheap product.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Wang Ming Yang saw his brother\u2019s latest Weibo post and was dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan: \u201cThose in the mountainous region who are earning less than ten thousand dollars a year may have the artificial limbs for free. This was said by me. If anyone asks you for money, give me a call and I guarantee that I\u2019ll resolve it for you. This wouldn\u2019t be a problem, would it? @ShanghaiOfficial @EasternHanOrganization\u201d</p><br/><p>When this post was uploaded, it instantly caused a huge stir.</p><br/><p>To the netizens, Master Lin was really too domineering.</p><br/><p>Anyone with eyes could clearly see that Master Lin simply didn\u2019t care about earning money. Otherwise, he wouldn\u2019t sell the artificial limbs for so cheap, nor would he make this Weibo post.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang immediately called him. \u201cBrother, once you say that, things will get out of hand.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. \u201cWhat? Can\u2019t I say that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang: \u201cYou\u2019ve already said it. Am I supposed to slap your face for saying that? Don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ve already discussed this with Secretary Chen. We were definitely going to offer this kind of benefits. But now that you\u2019ve said that it\u2019s going to be free, it will definitely have to be free.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan: \u201cThat\u2019s the way to do it. Some people in the mountainous regions don\u2019t even earn ten thousand dollars in a year. Three thousand dollars for an artificial limb would be too much.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, alright. You\u2019re the boss. Whatever you say.\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

Your success in Beijing depends on tonight. These are all wealthy youngsters and they\u2019re nowhere as capable as us but we can\u2019t do anything about it since they were born into rich families.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang smiled. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. You can trust me.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two of them had a lot of fixed assets. If they were to include liquid assets, they\u2019d have over ten billion dollars. They didn\u2019t want to be near these wealthy youngsters at all unless they invited them over. However, sometimes you\u2019d be bullied by those with power even if you didn\u2019t do anything to them. They had a lot of ways around this.</p><br/><p>They opened the door and entered.</p><br/><p>The interior was stunning and all that could be heard was the gentle laughter of women in the room.</p><br/><p>There were four young men and they looked to be in their twenties and thirties. Their outfits were expensive and each of them had a lady with him. The ladies were wearing cheongsam and they were stunning. They had amazing figures and the tight-fitting cheongsam clung to their bodies which made their chests look bigger.</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung Master Jiang, Young Master Huang, Young Master Ma, and Young Master Zhao, we\u2019re here,\u201d Wu Yun Gang smiled and said as he entered the room. Although he was a middle-aged man, he could converse well with these young men.</p><br/><p>He looked down on all of those young men but the main thing was that these people were indeed influential. Their fathers, grandfathers and even their whole families were powerful. Nobody could handle offending them.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang was good at analyzing people. He could briefly tell their personalities just by looking at them. There were three ugly men with a good looking one. The good-looking man was way classier than the other three ugly men. The chicks the others picked up also couldn\u2019t match up to that of the good looking one.</p><br/><p>It was obvious that the good-looking man had the highest status because he had the best looking girl. At the same time, he could tell from the placement of lighters on the table. The three uglier men all had lighters while the man with the highest status didn\u2019t have any. It was obvious that the three men had to help him light his cigarette whenever he smoked.</p><br/><p>Also, another key point to note was that the handsome man wasn\u2019t very interested in the beautiful lady beside him. He didn\u2019t even seem moved whenever the lady tried to seduce him. He could tell that this man was already sick of meeting beautiful ladies.</p><br/><p>\u201cChief Wu, is this the friend you want to introduce to us?\u201d One of the men asked.</p><br/><p>Wu Yun Gang smiled. \u201cYeah, he\u2019s Wang Ming Yang, an entrepreneur from Shanghai. He\u2019s extremely capable.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang took out a cigarette, the first person he gave the cigarette to was Young Master Jiang. \u201cYoung Master Jiang, please have a cigarette.\u201d</p><br/><p>Young Master Jiang didn\u2019t take the cigarette, he just looked at Wang Ming Yang. \u201cYou look young but you\u2019re so capable. Looks like you\u2019re indeed special.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang smiled modestly. \u201cNo, no. Just a little bit.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang was being modest but he was indeed young and extremely rich. He had started it all on his own and he had made all his profits by himself. Although he had done some wrong things in the past, he had to do them to make progress.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d Young Master Jiang took the cigarette. \u201cYou should know that yourself. Your small accomplishment isn\u2019t worth anything in our eyes. Money isn\u2019t everything but power is everything. I can just give a call to ten people now who have the same net worth as you and they\u2019ll call me big brother.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, yes.\u201d Wang Ming Yang was unhappy but he lit the cigarette for Young Master Jiang.</p><br/><p>The three other men also took out cigarettes. Since Young Master Jiang had already started smoking, they had to do it too. However, they were just observing Wang Ming Yang and it was still undetermined if they favored him.</p><br/><p>On the sofa.</p><br/><p>Wu Yun Gang looked at Wang Ming Yang and gave him a slight nod to compliment him. He was happy with what he had done.</p><br/><p><em>Knock knock!</em></p><br/><p>A pretty middle-aged woman walked in and said with a smile, \u201cYoung Master Jiang, your friends are here, do you need me to call another two ladies over?\u201d</p><br/><p>Young Master Jiang looked at her and smiled. \u201cWith Sister Yan here, do we still need anyone else?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSister Yan is old, how could I be attractive?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, Sister Yan is getting better with age. You can\u2019t be compared to those young girls.\u201d Young Master Jiang chuckled.</p><br/><p>Then, Sister Yan laughed. \u201cAlright, since Young Master Jiang has requested it, I have to give you face. If it was another person, they could forget about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang nudged Wu Yun Gang. He wanted to know about the background of this woman.</p><br/><p>Wu Yun Gang whispered, \u201cShe is the wife of the boss of this clubhouse. She controls this place and is very capable. Do not offend her.\u201d</p><br/><p>Young Master Jiang pushed the young lady beside him aside. \u201cGo there. Let Sister Yan sit here.\u201d</p><br/><p>The young lady moved aside. This place seemed extremely grand and legitimate but it was actually a dirty business. They were there just to earn money and they didn\u2019t dare to offend anyone.</p><br/><p>Sister Yan was indeed attractive and she looked mature and sophisticated. It wasn\u2019t something that could be easily accomplished by some of these younger ladies.</p><br/><p>\u201cChief Wu, who is this new person?\u201d Sister Yan smiled and asked.</p><br/><p>Wu Yun Gang chuckled. \u201cThis is my good friend, Wang Ming Yang. I brought him here to introduce him to Young Master Jiang and the others.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sister Yan looked at Wang Ming Yang and smiled. \u201cAlthough he\u2019s young, he has this prosperous look about him. Looks like he\u2019s not an average man.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Yun Gang nodded. \u201cMy friend\u2026\u201d He had wanted to talk about Wang Ming Yang\u2019s identity but was interrupted by Young Master Jiang. He had wanted to do so because if he could talk about Wang Ming Yang\u2019s identity, Wang Ming Yang would definitely be treated better.</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if he\u2019s special, he\u2019s not as special as us.\u201d Young Master Jiang looked a little unhappy that someone else was in the limelight.</p><br/><p>Sister Yan covered her mouth and chuckled. \u201cYeah, Young Master Jiang is the most special and of course, Young Master Zhao, Young Master Ma, and Young Master Huang too.\u201d</p><br/><p>The three of them waved their hands. \u201cNo, we\u2019re not as good as our Brother Jiang.\u201d</p><br/><p>Young Master Jiang looked at the table and said, \u201cSister Yan, could we prepare some more alcohol? I want to accompany Chief Wang from Shanghai.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Yun Gang was stunned. He hurriedly replied, \u201cYoung Master Jiang, I\u2019ll take care of him. After all, there\u2019s a lot of alcohol here already. We don\u2019t have to take more.\u201d</p><br/><p>Young Master Jiang\u2019s finger twitched and he turned his head towards him. \u201cDo I need your permission to get alcohol?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang immediately replied, \u201cYoung Master Jiang, Yun Gang didn\u2019t mean it that way. Since Young Master Jiang is so courteous, I, Wang Ming Yang, will accede to your request.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, Young Master Jiang smiled. \u201cAlright, Sister Yan, get some good alcohol here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sister Yan smiled and nodded. \u201cAlright, I\u2019ll do whatever you say, Young Master Jiang. I\u2019ll go and get the best bottle here. However, you can\u2019t get drunk. We don\u2019t accept any guests staying overnight here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Yun Gang nudged Wang Ming Yang and furrowed his brows. He looked extremely worried.</p><br/><p>Young Master Zhao and the others didn\u2019t say anything. They just sat there and watched as if they were waiting for something. At the same time, they were chatting with their ladies and the ladies started laughing coquettishly\u2026</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/a-valiant-life-chapter-435-elder-lin\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 435 - Elder Lin\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/a-valiant-life-chapter-437-chaos\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 437 - Chaos\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"78251\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

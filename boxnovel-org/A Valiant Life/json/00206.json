He was nearly scared to death. He wanted to cry but no tears came. This has nothing to do with me, it really has nothing to do with me!</p><br/><p>*ring ring*</p><br/><p>The notable leader asked, \"Xiao Li, you seem to have brought this up to me before. Do you have something to do with this Wang Shen or not?\"</p><br/><p>Xiao Li replied, \"Leader, I've been wrongly accused! I really didn't know that Wang Shen was a human trafficker! That day, when I heard the man on the phone say that Wang Shen is a human trafficker, I didn't dare to bear the responsibility, so I didn't say much. You know too, about how much this Wang Shen contributes to society. He donates a large sum each year. I only wanted to lend him a hand. If I had known that Wang Shen really was related to the human traffickers, I wouldn't have done that!\"</p><br/><p>The leader said, \"Let's see how it goes. If they really investigate it, you could be in a bit of trouble. But as long as you're not involved, it should be fine.\"</p><br/><p>He hung up.</p><br/><p>Xiao Li was really lost for words. What the heck was going on? He was way too unlucky. If he had known, even if he had ten guts, he wouldn't have dared to do it.</p><br/><p>At the honors ceremony.</p><br/><p>There were discussions going on in the audience. They were all wondering who that man that Master Lin was talking about was.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan, who was standing on stage, suddenly chuckled, \"Everyone, there's no need to guess. I think that leader probably didn't know that Wang Shen was a human trafficker. Even he wouldn't be so daring. But people these days really can't be judged by appearance. I heard that that Wang Shen donates a lot of money every year. To some leaders, he's a contributor to society. A philanthropist. Of course, they had to give him some leeway. So, I'm not going to say much about this. My final thoughts are that easy deeds can't amount to much. Alright, I'm done with my speech. Thank you.\"</p><br/><p>*clap clap*</p><br/><p>Applause filled the place.</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian smiled, \"Master Lin is really amazing.\"</p><br/><p>Liang Yong nodded. This Master Lin really knew how to talk. This ability of his was amazing. He didn't have any stage fright at all. In this honors ceremony, every word he had said was meaningful and eye-opening.</p><br/><p>The host stood at the side, clearly embarrassed. He felt like he was useless. From start to finish, he didn't have much to say. It was completely Master Lin's show.</p><br/><p>Xiao Li, who was watching the broadcast, heaved a sigh of relief. Fortunately, this Master Lin hadn't revealed his name. Otherwise, he would have been depressed. Although he was innocent, he would surely still have been punished.</p><br/><p>He shed a few tears of gratitude.</p><br/><p>He didn't dare to speak well about other people ever again. What the heck was that? To hide such a dark secret. How was he supposed to know that Wang Shen was actually the leader of the human traffickers?</p><br/><p>If he had cooperated with that human traffickers' leader at that time, he wouldn't be able to explain himself even if he was innocent. What a close shave.</p><br/><p>The leaders in attendance had a good impression of Lin Fan. They had to admit that he had handled the situation beautifully. At the same time, Liang Yong developed a newfound respect for Liu Xiao Tian. If he hadn't stuck it out, he wouldn't have been able to uncover this crime.</p><br/><p>Without any evidence, a Shanghainese philanthropist had been captured. If no evidence had been found in the end, they would've been f*cked. Who would've borne the responsibility then?</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was about to place the microphone back on the rostrum when suddenly, he was stunned.</p><br/><p>Something was not right.</p><br/><p>In fact, something was very wrong.</p><br/><p>\"Please don't\u2026\"</p><br/><p>These two words were amplified by the microphone. Everyone looked surprised. They had no idea what Master Lin meant by 'Please don't'.</p><br/><p>At that moment, only Lin Fan himself understood.</p><br/><p>\"The fifth task has been completed, Encyclopedic Points will be increased by 20 points.\"</p><br/><p>\"Unlocking the sixth page of knowledge. For it's the sixth page of knowledge, a specialty of someone near the host will be chosen.\"</p><br/><p>\"Tian Han Ming worships the host greatly, but is currently not near the host, hence the skill cannot be unlocked. The skill will be reselected.\"</p><br/><p>\"Chu Yuan has developed a great sense of adoration for the host. Hence, a sub-class of the culinary skill major class will be unlocked: One of the Eight Great Chinese Cuisines - Jiangsu Cuisine.</p><br/><p>\"Task: As usual, to become the famous Master Lin.\"</p><br/><p>\"Reward: Encyclopedic points +20 and the ability to unlock the seventh page of knowledge\"</p><br/><p>\"Note: Since it is a small class of knowledge, there is no need to be involved in the profession.\"</p><br/><p>\"Current Encyclopedic Points: 50\"</p><br/><p>The notification sound from the Encyclopedia ended. He stood on stage with pain in his heart. But he didn't know what to say. Who could he blame? How had he even completed his task? Why wasn't he aware at all?</p><br/><p>Could it be that he had been so f*cking awesome on stage that hell broke loose on the internet?</p><br/><p>It was just as Lin Fan thought. This had indeed happened because the videos on the internet had gone viral after he stepped on stage.</p><br/><p>Especially that video where he commanded a hundred dogs. It was simply earth-shattering. Anyone who saw that video wanted to prostrate himself/herself in admiration. This ability of his, to communicate with dogs, left everyone astounded.</p><br/><p>They had nothing but admiration for him.</p><br/><p>The famous Master Lin actually knew how to talk to animals as well. He was simply inhuman.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan sighed. This Jiangsu cuisine presented to him by the Encyclopedia, he accepted it. No matter how you put it, it wasn't too f*cked up a skill to have. However, what Lin Fan didn't know was who this Chu Yuan was. He didn't have a single idea who that was, why had he developed a great sense of adoration for Lin Fan?</p><br/><p>Moreover, this name sounded like a man's name. What the f*ck was a man adoring him for?</p><br/><p>The host saw that Lin Fan was stunned, so he asked curiously, \"Master Lin, are you okay?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan came back to his senses and laughed, \"I'm fine.\"</p><br/><p>He had already accepted this outcome but he had to get something clear, so he held the microphone up and asked, \"May I know who, in the audience, is Chu Yuan?\"</p><br/><p>The audience below the stage looked at each other. They had no idea what Master Lin meant. Who was Chu Yuan? Could he be another human trafficker?</p><br/><p>Everyone was looking around, wondering what was going on.</p><br/><p>\"Master Lin, I'm Chu Yuan.\" At that moment, a voice rang out.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked over. It was a reporter. He appeared to be quite young, fair-skinned and bright. However, he didn't look like that kind of person.</p><br/><p>How frustrating.</p><br/><p>Why did a man have to know how to cook? Even if he just knew how to cook, it was fine but why did he have a great sense of adoration for Lin Fan?</p><br/><p>Lin Fan felt that he had been put in a bad spot. He didn't run a restaurant, nor did he like cooking. Now that he had gotten this task, what was he supposed to do?</p><br/><p>Lin fan sighed. Forget it. Things have already turned out like that, what else can be done?</p><br/><p>Chu Yuan, who was standing at the back, was a little excited. He had never thought that Master Lin would actually know his name. He yelled out emotionally, \"Master Lin, I really worship you! I've actually been kidnapped by human traffickers before when I was young and I was away from home for ten whole years. Later on, I only escaped thanks to the help of other people and found back my home. Heroes like you who battle the human traffickers are the people that I, Chu Yuan, respect the most!\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was speechless. This Chu Yuan had already said so much, what else could he say?</p><br/><p>Forget it, let's not say anything.</p><br/><p>\"Thank you,\" Lin Fan thanked Chu Yuan. Sometimes, being adored can be a troublesome thing.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

The rest could be left to Zhou Qing Quan and the rest to handle.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan didn\u2019t have been involve himself in this for now. Those exam scripts had pretty much been finished. He sent them to Zhou Qing Quan for safekeeping.</p><br/><p>However, he went to the official website to take a look as well. There were applicants from all over the country but many of them were Chinese doctors from small towns and villages. They seemed not to have any authority and power.</p><br/><p>Now, getting into the Chinese Medical Association was similar to getting into a university, it depended on results and not relations. Hence, those people who only had the title of Chinese doctor without real abilities could forget about it.</p><br/><p>The next day!</p><br/><p>Nanshan Children\u2019s Welfare Institute.</p><br/><p>As the sound of Lin Fan\u2019s piano faded, a familiar sound rang out.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe task of teaching the piano to thirty children has been completed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnlocking the twenty-second page of knowledge. As it is the twenty-second page, a class of knowledge will be randomly chosen.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnlocking the subclass of the Blessing major class of knowledge: Blessed Carvings.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTask: Gift ten blessed carvings to ten kindhearted people to bring them good fortune.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReward: Encyclopedic Points +100.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan: \u201c???\u201d</p><br/><p>He was confused. What the heck was this small class of knowledge?</p><br/><p>But after he went through the knowledge in his mind, he understood. This class of knowledge was unreal. It allowed him to carve objects and these objects would have blessings within them that could change one\u2019s fortune for the better.</p><br/><p>This task was to gift the carvings to ten kindhearted people to bring them good fortune.</p><br/><p>But he had to say that it was too unreal.</p><br/><p>Still, the difficulty was not high.</p><br/><p>He just hadn\u2019t expected that the classes of knowledge that he unlocked would get more and more mystical.</p><br/><p>He wasn\u2019t bothered by it. He clapped his hands together as he looked at the children. \u201cAlright, you are all great. Today\u2019s piano lesson shall end here. Go out and play.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWatch out for your own safety.\u201d</p><br/><p>The children really liked being with Lin Fan. However, they liked going out to play even more.</p><br/><p>After the children left, the teachers came to Lin Fan\u2019s side.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, your piano playing sounds so great.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s just alright. It\u2019s not that great. It\u2019s passable.\u201d</p><br/><p>The teachers at the side started talking very pleasurably.</p><br/><p>\u201cI feel that it really sounds really good. It\u2019s even better than those famous pianists.\u201d</p><br/><p>Facing such compliments, Lin Fan just calmly waved his hand. At the same time, he grumbled in his heart. <em>Isn\u2019t that obvious? Of </em>course <em>my piano sounds great.</em></p><br/><p>However, one had to be humble.</p><br/><p>Han Lu had been standing behind the whole time as if he was the guardian spirit of the welfare institute. However, his gaze was placed rather far away. He had been staring at one of the teachers inside. Occasionally, he would shyly avert his gaze. He couldn\u2019t let his intentions be seen by her.</p><br/><p>Now, there was nothing much to do in the welfare institute, so Lin Fan left.</p><br/><p>But thinking about the task, he felt that he could go and give it a try.</p><br/><p>Then, he drove his car towards the market. He decided to buy some materials back to Cloud Street to slowly carve it.</p><br/><p>The carving material market. This was one of the biggest markets in Shanghai.</p><br/><p>After parking the car, he looked around the place before entering a shop. He picked out the materials he needed and paid for them. After buying all his equipment, he left.</p><br/><p>He drove back towards Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>At that moment, on the pavement, a young lady was carrying a small bag as she walked. She was still thinking about what had just happened.</p><br/><p>\u201cSigh, what a shame. I didn\u2019t get accepted. I was so close.\u201d Wang Ying was thinking about the interview. Because of one sentence from her, she had offended the interviewer. Just thinking about it made her feel stupid.</p><br/><p>That interviewer had spat his phlegm on the ground at the interview venue. She had advised him to watch his hygiene. Then, she got marked down by the interviewer and failed immediately.</p><br/><p>Although it was a shame, she didn\u2019t regret it. If that happened again, she would still advise him.</p><br/><p>At that moment, she saw a group of people gathered at a place and she was curious. Why were there so many people gathered?</p><br/><p>A group of passersby had gathered around, whispering into each other\u2019s ears.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t touch him. We don\u2019t know what happened. If he wakes up, he might blame you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s what I was thinking. That\u2019s why I didn\u2019t dare to touch him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShould we call an ambulance?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou call. I won\u2019t do it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I won\u2019t call either.\u201d</p><br/><p>The crowd all watched but none of them did anything.</p><br/><p>Wang Ying squeezed through the crowd. When she saw that a cleaner had collapsed on the ground, she was startled. Then, without thinking much, she rushed forward and kneeled down. She gently called out, \u201cUncle, uncle, are you okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung lady, don\u2019t touch him. This has nothing to do with you. If something happens, you might be implicated,\u201d the people around warned her.</p><br/><p>Wang Ying glanced at that person. Then, she started to recall the first aid treatments she had seen in a book before. She could at least remember some of it. She opened the cleaner\u2019s mouth with her hands.</p><br/><p>Without hesitation, she blew into his mouth.</p><br/><p>When the crowd saw this, their hearts trembled. <em>This young lady is really brave. She even dares to do such a thing.</em></p><br/><p>At that moment, Lin Fan had just passed by and he had joined the crowd as well. Initially, he had wanted to help. But when he saw that young lady doing that, he was startled. He hadn\u2019t expected that there would be someone like that.</p><br/><p>However, blowing air wouldn\u2019t save the man. Then, with a flick of his finger, he shot out a burst of energy which permeated into the cleaner\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>Before long, with Wang Ying\u2019s efforts, that cleaner gradually woke up.</p><br/><p>Everyone gasped.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s awake. He\u2019s really awake.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis young lady is amazing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah!\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, some people rushed forward. They appeared very caring as they asked, \u201cUncle, are you okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>The uncle woke up in a daze. When he saw that so many people were surrounding him, he was confused. However, thinking about how he had fainted, he started thanking them.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you, thank you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>To the cleaner, there seemed to be a lot of people.</p><br/><p>A group of people helped the old uncle up and cared for him. It was completely different from the coldness they had shown before.</p><br/><p>On the other hand, Wang Ying had been forgotten by the old uncle.</p><br/><p>Seeing that the old uncle had awoken, Wang Ying didn\u2019t think much. Although he didn\u2019t know that she had helped him, she hadn\u2019t helped him for his thanks.</p><br/><p>Then, she dusted off her knees before walking off in front.</p><br/><p>She still had another interview to go to.</p><br/><p>Moreover, it was an even better company. The competition was intense. She had to do her best.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan watched Wang Ying closely. This young lady was really kindhearted but her luck wasn\u2019t too good.</p><br/><p>She was one of those people who wouldn\u2019t receive any credit no matter how much work she did.</p><br/><p>For her to be so positive, her attitude had to be strong. It was hard not to respect her.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello\u2026\u201d at that moment, Lin Fan shouted from behind. He was all smiles as he looked at Wang Ying. And this smile appeared to harbour some bad intentions.</p><br/><p>Wang Ying heard someone shouting at her from behind and was suspicious. But she cheerfully turned around. When she was who it was, she was startled.</p><br/><p>Exhilarated, she blurted out.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin\u2026\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

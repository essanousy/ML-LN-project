However, there were too many migrant workers and he didn\u2019t have time to prepare so much tea.</p><br/><p>The reporters were standing at the back of the room as they filmed the scenes.</p><br/><p>It was as if a small ceremony was going to take place.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan asked, \u201cLeader Wang, what do you think we should do now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2026\u201d Leader Wang hesitated for a moment. \u201cMaster Lin, could you tell me what is going on? Once I understand the situation, I would be able to think of a solution.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung Zhao, explain to him,\u201d Lin Fan roughly knew the situation but he was still unclear about the general happenings.</p><br/><p>Young Zhao was a little nervous. It was the first time he had seen such a powerful and influential leader. However, since the matter involved people\u2019s salaries, he wanted to speak up about it.</p><br/><p>He told him everything and didn\u2019t hide anything from him.</p><br/><p>After that, Leader Wang remained silent. It was a difficult situation.</p><br/><p>The people that were directly in charge of the migrant workers were chief labor contractors, they belonged to the labor services companies. The people that were in charge of labor services companies were those from the construction companies. These construction companies were taken care of by the real estate developers.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t that he had never encountered a situation like this. The money was difficult to obtain since he wouldn\u2019t know who to get it from as there were many layers of relationships.</p><br/><p>If he were to look for the labour services company\u2019s managers, they could just claim that they didn\u2019t take any money. Those companies above them could also claim the same thing.</p><br/><p>It would be even more troublesome to deal with the construction companies. There were a lot of managers and they would all push the blame to one another. They wouldn\u2019t have a proper closure.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan asked, \u201cLeader, if we were to reach such a situation, what would the Ministry of Manpower do?\u201d</p><br/><p>Leader Wang replied, \u201cUsually, we serve as the supervisors. If people were to not give salaries, they would usually be dealt with by arbitration. If they can resolve it before that happens, they can resolve the problem by communication means. Usually, the arbitration process would take at least two years. When that happens, the New Year would probably be over. I suggest them to resolve it by communicating with one another.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan felt that the situation was a little complicated. He didn\u2019t know what to say about some of the things.</p><br/><p>However, it was true that people that owed money could behave like bosses.</p><br/><p>If you were to ask for money, you\u2019d have to be polite and courteous.</p><br/><p>Ding ding!</p><br/><p>Then, Lin Fan\u2019s phone rang.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan gestured for everyone to keep quiet before answering the call.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello, who is this?\u201d</p><br/><p>The person on the phone sounded furious. He said, \u201cMaster Lin, do you think that there\u2019s a need for that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d Lin Fan asked. Did the fella have some kind of illness? He spoke with such a bad tone even without introducing himself.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am the manager of a Mainland real estate project. Did you have to publicise that online? You knew that this would affect our company. You could have discussed it with us. Furthermore, the problem with their salaries has nothing to do with us. We have already sent the money to the relevant authorities. You should look for the construction companies and the labor services companies instead,\u201d Manager Wu was so furious that he was going to kill someone.</p><br/><p>The impact of the problem was great. It affected a lot of housing units. A lot of people feedbacked that they wanted to refund their housing units.</p><br/><p>After they looked into the situation, they realized that someone had been scolding them on Weibo and that person was an influential one.</p><br/><p>He was clearly trying to mess with them.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled, \u201cDidn\u2019t I look for you before? Did you want to discuss it with me? Don\u2019t even speak about the labor services companies. He didn\u2019t say anything about their salaries.\u201d</p><br/><p>Manager Wu replied, \u201cWhat does he have to do with our company if he is broke? If you want money, you should ask him and not us. Can you be reasonable?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cSorry, I am unreasonable at times. I only look for those that are responsible for this. This plot of land was developed by your real estate company. Hence, you are the person that is responsible for this. Now that the workers are not getting their salaries, who else am I supposed to look for? As for your communication with the labor services companies, that is your own problem. Am I right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Manager Wu replied, \u201cThat is not really logical. We have already signed a contract with the relevant sub-companies. It doesn\u2019t concern us. Do you understand?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry, I don\u2019t really understand. I am just here for the money. As for how you are going to discuss with the sub-companies, that is your problem,\u201d Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou should be looking for the labor services companies, do you understand?\u201d Manager Wu was a little furious. He felt that this fella was unreasonable.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was initially calm but he was getting pretty fed up too.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, don\u2019t try to push the blame away. I\u2019ll just ask this: are you going to give them their salaries?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe have no money, how are we going to do that?\u201d Manager Wu said angrily.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, that\u2019s what you said. I\u2019m not going to do anything now, I\u2019ll see how you guys are going to last,\u201d Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>*beep*</p><br/><p>He immediately hung up.</p><br/><p>Manager Wu was so furious that he didn\u2019t know what to say. He immediately called the construction company.</p><br/><p>\u201cChief Liu, what do you mean by that? Why are you looking for the labor services company? Didn\u2019t we give the money to them? Why didn\u2019t you give them their salaries?\u201d Manager Wu said angrily.</p><br/><p>Chief Liu was stunned, \u201cHey, Chief Wu, what do you mean by that? How could the labor services company not give them their salaries? The funds that your company gave are not according to the contract we signed. It was supposed to be $20 million but you only gave $15 million. How are we going to give the remaining amount?\u201d</p><br/><p>Manager Wu replied, \u201cI don\u2019t care about that. You should know what is happening on Weibo. It has a great impact on us. Quickly contact the labor services company. I don\u2019t want this matter to blow up. If our boss were to find out about this, you can forget about taking this project.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it, I\u2019ll hang up now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Liu of the construction company was furious. What was he talking about? However, he still called the labor services company.</p><br/><p>When the call got through, he shouted, \u201cWhat is wrong with you? Didn\u2019t I give you the money? Why didn\u2019t you give it to the workers? Do you know that the matter has been blown up? Even the Ministry of Manpower is involved in this now. If your company can\u2019t do it, let us know. We can switch companies.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cChief Liu, listen to me. We are having trouble handling this too. We were supposed to get $15 million but you only gave us $8 million. How are we going to pay the workers after paying for the materials and logistics?\u201d</p><br/><p>They were really helpless and every company deducted their pay by a little. In the end, there wasn\u2019t any money left for the workers.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care what is it, you have to pay them their salaries by today,\u201d Chief Liu said.</p><br/><p>The manager of the labor services company replied, \u201cChief Liu, we really have no money here. What are we going to pay them with? Unless you give us the remaining amount of the $15 million and we will give them their pay.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Liu was furious after hearing that. If he were to give them everything, what were they supposed to earn?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201d Chief Liu said unhappily.</p><br/><p>The manager replied, \u201cI don\u2019t really mean anything else. You have to understand our situation here. We don\u2019t even have enough money and we have nothing left. I can\u2019t just pay them out of my own pocket, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Liu replied, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with that? Which project doesn\u2019t require any additional inflow of money? You should pay them first and we can reimburse you the amount next time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf that is the case, it would be meaningless. I\u2019m quitting this project. I will handle the finances accordingly. You can hire someone else.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Liu replied, \u201cAlright, alright. It gets troublesome every New Year.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p></div>\n</div>"}

He felt that this fella was ruthless and violent. Slapping his face like that without any warning, how could this fella slap that handsome face of his?</p><br/><p>However, what pissed Wang Yao off even more was how cowardly Yang Jie was. He didn't even help at all and only knew how to hide at a side. Wang Yao felt that he had wasted his time raising Yang Jie. At such a critical moment, Yang Jie just cut ties with him.</p><br/><p>The traffic policeman started getting busy. He asked Lin Fan for his ID, then proceeded to inquire about the situation.</p><br/><p>The cars behind just went onward by the side. They didn't know what was going on in front, but judging by appearance, it seemed that some incident had happened.</p><br/><p>Not long after.</p><br/><p>A car stopped at a distance. Wang Shen got off the car and looked at the situation at the Golden Red Road traffic light. It didn't seem like any major incident.</p><br/><p>\"Brother Wang, do you want me to find someone to settle this?\" the man by his side asked.</p><br/><p>Wang Shen waved his hand, \"There's no need. We'll settle it ourselves. Come with me and just stand at the side. It's not a major incident.\"</p><br/><p>The man nodded.</p><br/><p>Wang Yao was getting anxious. Why wasn't his dad there yet? At that moment, he saw the silhouette in front and waved frantically, \"Dad, over here! Over here!\"</p><br/><p>Then, Wang Yao looked at Lin Fan, \"My Dad is here. Just you wait.\"</p><br/><p>In Wang Yao's eyes, there was nothing that his old man couldn't do. It was thanks to his old man that he could live such a lifestyle. And now that something like this had happened, he had to rely on his old man again.</p><br/><p>When Wang Shen reached the scene and saw the situation, he furrowed his brows. Wang Yao pulled on Wang Shen's arm and pointed at Lin Fan, \"Dad, that's him. He gave me two slaps to the face for no rhyme and reason.\"</p><br/><p>Wang Shen ignored Wang Yao and went to the traffic policeman, \"Traffic policeman, may I know what's going on?\"</p><br/><p>The traffic policeman replied, \"Your son was driving and he suddenly drifted ahead of the car in front, causing this Mister to jam the brakes. If he didn't react quickly enough, things would've ended up horribly.</p><br/><p>Wang Yao was panicked, he quickly tried to explain himself, \"Dad, I\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Wang Shen glared at him, \"Shut up.\"</p><br/><p>Wang Yao was a little frightened so he kept quiet. He didn't dare to disobey Wang Shen. Since young, he always got beaten by his dad. Whenever he talked back to his dad, he would get beaten. Hence, he could only stand there silently. He didn't dare to say a word. Still, he looked at Lin Fan with a ferocious look in his eyes.</p><br/><p>Then, Wang Shen stepped forward, \"I'm sorry, young brother, my son has misbehaved and caused a shock to you. If you have any requests, I will definitely compensate you. When we go back, I'll definitely teach this brat a lesson.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at Wang Shen but didn't say anything. He was getting suspicious. This man appeared cultured and refined. He dressed well and didn't seem like someone who would violate the law. However, it seemed that this man carried a great deal of bad karma on his head. He had to have committed a lot of sins.</p><br/><p>Wang Shen realized that this youngster was staring at him, so much so that he started to get goosebumps, \"What is it, young brother?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan's expression changed slightly, then he laughed and extended his hand outwards.</p><br/><p>Wang Shen didn't understand what was going on with Lin Fan but since he extended his hand, Wang Shen thought that they had settled the dispute. Lin Fan's car didn't appear cheap either, so since they could settle the dispute, Wang Shen saw no reason to keep pressing the matter.</p><br/><p>His little brat caused trouble everywhere he went but didn't have any real capabilities. He only relied on his father for money to fool around all day. Even after he was given the opportunity to go to a local university in Shanghai, he didn't attend school at all. If it wasn't for Wang Shen's connections, that brat would've been expelled a long time ago.</p><br/><p>Wang Shen smiled as he shook Lin Fan's hand, then he said, \"Young brother, I sincerely apologize for this. It's all because I wasn't strict with him. When we go back, I will definitely give him a proper lesson. As for the trouble we've caused you, I hope that you will forgive us.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed and said, \"No problem. It can't be helped that your teachings weren't strict. After all, the apple never falls far from the tree. This is understandable.\"</p><br/><p>Wang Shen's smile faltered for a moment as he saw Lin take out a phone with his other hand and dial a number.</p><br/><p>Wang Shen felt that this youngster's grip was getting tighter and tighter. He couldn't struggle out of it. He started to get nervous but after being in society for so long, he wasn't so easily frightened. He continued smiling as he stared at Lin Fan with vigor in his eyes.</p><br/><p>The call went through.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \"Chief Liu, I'm here at the traffic light at Golden Red Road. I ran into a big fish. This isn't my responsibility but why don't you come to take a look? Alright. I'll wait for you. Don't take too long. I'm not too strong and I may not be able to hold on.\"</p><br/><p>At the police station.</p><br/><p>As soon as Liu Xiao Tian received the call from Lin Fan, he started to move. He didn't know what this 'big fish' that Master Lin was talking about was but he trusted in Master Lin. So, he immediately gathered his men and rushed towards Golden-Red Road.</p><br/><p>'Big fish'</p><br/><p>These two words made Liu Xiao Tian exhilarated. But he really didn't know what kind of big fish this big fish was. Could it be\u2026</p><br/><p>He didn't dare to imagine it. He could only wait until he reached the scene to find out.</p><br/><p>At that moment!</p><br/><p>That hand of Wang Shen's that was holding onto Lin Fan's hand started to turn red but he still maintained his smile, \"Young Brother, what's the meaning of this? Could it be that there's an issue?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled, \"There's no issue, I just feel that you look very familiar. I haven't been sleeping well recently and there's always people appearing in my dreams.\"</p><br/><p>Wang Shen laughed, \"That's normal. Young people have a lot of stress. In the day, there are things to think about. In the night, there are dreams to dream about. Unlike this son of mine who knows how to play around all day and waste his time away. I want him to become a capable man, but it doesn't seem possible.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled, \"Becoming a capable person depends on the person himself too. However, this dream of mine isn't a good dream. There are many little kids missing arms and legs. It's horrible. It's only today that I finally understand why I've been having this dream.\"</p><br/><p>Wang Shen looked very curious, \"Why? Could it have something to do with me?\"</p><br/><p>\"You don't say. It really has something to do with you,\" said Lin Fan, \"I was wondering why you looked so familiar. It turns out that I've seen you in my dream. That picture that those children were holding was a picture of you. They wanted me to find you, so that's why I ran into you today.\"</p><br/><p>At that moment, Wang Shen's facial expression changed slightly. The look in his eyes also gradually changed. He felt as if this youngster knew something. Then, he smiled and said, \"I think it's probably because I've supported several charities for disabled people before. Those children in your dream are grateful, so they sent you to meet me.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shrugged, \"Who knows? I guess you're right.\" </p><br/><p>As Wang Yao looked at the scene, he was confused. What was his old man holding onto this fella's hand for so long for? And then even talked so much.</p><br/><p>The man who had been following Wang Shen stepped forward as he felt that something was amiss but Wang Shen waved his free hand, signaling for the man to step back.</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan saw this, he started laughing, \"It's best if he doesn't come here. He'll interfere with our conversation. We're really hitting it off, don't you think?\"</p><br/><p>Wang Shen cackled, \"Right, right. Why not I settle things here and we go to a teahouse to chat? After all, it's not every day that I get to meet an interesting youngster like you.\"</p><br/><p>\"I'd rather not. I'm worried that I might enter with all four limbs intact but leave with an arm or leg missing,\" said Lin Fan in a profound tone.</p><br/><p>Wang Shen used his strength to try and struggle his hand free but this youngster's grip strength was like that of a tiger's. Then, he gave up and smiled, \"Young brother, you must be joking. This is a society governed by law, how could something like that happen?\"</p><br/><p>At that moment, the police car arrived.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan turned to look at it, then he looked back at Wang Shen, \"Don't be anxious. Now that they're here, we can go for a cup of tea somewhere else. That place is much quieter, don't you think so, Wang Er Mazi?</p><br/><p>When Wang Shen heard this nickname, his pupils dilated. Then, he took a deep breath, \"I don't know what you're talking about.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

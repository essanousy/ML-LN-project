She had long passed her tolerance limit. If she weren\u2019t so worried about all the people around, she would\u2019ve started quarrelling with Lin Fan long ago.</p><br/><p>As Liu Xu\u2019s assistant, Wang Xin didn\u2019t sit at the table but she stood at the side, listening. She had found out about these people\u2019s backgrounds. She had never thought that the man next to Chief Liu knew so many people.</p><br/><p>She was now filled with hope for the future. She could finally realize her ambition and she would put her all into it.</p><br/><p>He Cheng Han said, \u201cGathering with everyone once again is really something to be happy about. And what\u2019s more important is Chief Liu\u2019s opening. Master Lin informed us too late. Otherwise, we would have prepared generous gifts. But it isn\u2019t too late yet. I shall become a member here and top up two hundred thousand to my account.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Hao said, \u201cThat\u2019s not bad. The environment here is very good and so is the service. There are food and entertainment in one place. In future, if I have any social events, this shall be my first choice as a venue. I\u2019ll top up two hundred thousand as well, to give Chief Liu a boost.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, if you two are becoming members, then I have to as well. If Brother He tops up two hundred thousand, I cannot top up more than that but nor can I top us less. I\u2019ll top up two hundred thousand too.\u201d</p><br/><p>At the dining table, everyone was chatting. This time, they had gotten notice of the opening ceremony a little late and they hadn\u2019t prepared for it, so they had to become members.</p><br/><p>Initially, Lin Fan had been feeling pleased with his own resourcefulness but suddenly, when he heard this, he was stunned.</p><br/><p>Oh f*ck!</p><br/><p>Could it be that this group of guys have too much money and don\u2019t know how else to spend it?</p><br/><p>On the other hand, Liu Xu was smiling. It was a very delightful smile. Especially when she looked at Lin Fan, there was a deep meaning behind that smile.</p><br/><p>When Wang Xin heard this, her mood surged. She had not expected these old bosses to want to become members. This astounded her.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t because of how much they paid.</p><br/><p>But it was because they actually signed up for the membership. This showed that they would come back to spend their money in future.</p><br/><p>For a high-end entertainment hotel to truly become popular, social connections and inflow of guests were important.</p><br/><p>If the people who would come were all big shots, other people would naturally think of running into people that they want to meet here. They would definitely rush to become members as well. This would help the hotel to expand more easily.</p><br/><p>Several million were paid.</p><br/><p>This left her speechless.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan didn\u2019t want to say anything. This incident was really f*cked up.</p><br/><p>Liu Xu said softly, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. It seems like I\u2019ve won this round.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled, \u201cThere\u2019s no hurry. There\u2019ll be more opportunities in future.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although the two of them were at war with each other, everything was very peaceful. Especially to the shop owners of Cloud Street, this day had been a really happy day.</p><br/><p>This had been a delightful meal. And after eating, they had even gone to sing. This day, during which they had been able to completely let loose, made their bodies and hearts feel comforted.</p><br/><p>The opening ceremony ended.</p><br/><p>Outside the hotel.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cI don\u2019t know what to say to all of you.\u201d</p><br/><p>He Cheng Han smiled, \u201cMaster Lin, you really think we don\u2019t know the situation? I, Elder He, don\u2019t dare to say too much but my judgments of people are very accurate. Whether you and Chief Liu have that kind of relationship, you think I don\u2019t know?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough we don\u2019t know what you two are doing, we are your friends. She\u2019s having an opening ceremony and since we came, we couldn\u2019t embarrass you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang patted Lin Fan on the shoulder and said, \u201cElder He is right. We did this to let her know that you are respected. This is our way of supporting your reputation. But really, this Chief Liu is pretty good looking. Not only is her mannerism good, she\u2019s really feminine. She has a kind of flair that other women don\u2019t have.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan sighed. He really couldn\u2019t understand what they were thinking. \u201cAlright, let\u2019s not talk about this. Oh yeah, have any of you gotten involved in a thorny situation lately? Now that I\u2019m here, you can tell me and I\u2019ll help you take a look.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEverything has been smooth sailing lately.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe last fortune-reading that you gave me is still proving its use even now.\u201d</p><br/><p>No one had encountered any problems. As long as they didn\u2019t take any major steps, they basically wouldn\u2019t be met with any trouble.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded, \u201cAlright then. That\u2019s good. If you just do things steadily, your fortunes won\u2019t be bad.\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, a man walked over from afar.</p><br/><p>\u201cHi, brothers. I\u2019d like to ask for directions. How do I go here?\u201d the man asked as he patted Lin Fan on the shoulder.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the map. \u201cOver here, just\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t move.\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly, the man whispered into Lin Fan\u2019s ear. Lin Fan felt something pressing against his back.</p><br/><p>A gun!</p><br/><p>That was Lin Fan\u2019s first thought.</p><br/><p>When met with such a situation, he would have to be lying if he said he wasn\u2019t nervous. Although he had the Encyclopedia, he was still human. If he took a bullet, he would still lose his life.</p><br/><p>However, with his abilities, he could definitely take down the man. But the man\u2019s next words dispelled that idea.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m warning you. You better not move. I\u2019ve already done my research. You are very powerful but I\u2019m not the only person here. If you move, these friends of yours would be in danger.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang and the rest were still talking cheerfully. They hadn\u2019t noticed this situation. However, they realized that Lin Fan looked a little strange.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up with you?\u201d Wang Ming Yang was about to go forward.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cDon\u2019t move. Just stand there.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang realized that something was wrong. Then, he looked at the man behind Lin Fan. \u201cBrother, who are you? Why are you looking for him?\u201d</p><br/><p>An MPV stopped at the side of the road.</p><br/><p>The man said softly, \u201cDon\u2019t even think of making any small movements. Just come with me obediently. If you do anything else, these friends of yours will lose their lives.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked around. There weren\u2019t many people around but he frowned. Although those people didn\u2019t seem like a problem, he could tell that these people were very vicious. It was as if they would kill without batting an eye.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you all move. Listen to me,\u201d said Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan and Wu Huan Yue wanted to say something but Lin Fan glared at them.</p><br/><p>The man threatened him all the way until they reached the MPV. A hand reached out from inside the vehicle and pulled Lin Fan in.</p><br/><p>Bam!</p><br/><p>Once the door closed, the vehicle immediately went off.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck!\u201d Wang Ming Yang cried out in shock, \u201cCall the police, quick!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan and Wu Huan Yue\u2019s expressions changed. \u201cBrother Lin\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, they knew that this was a kidnapping case.</p><br/><p>In the vehicle.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan\u2019s hands and legs were tied up.</p><br/><p>The man who had pointed the gun at Lin Fan\u2019s back said, \u201cMaster Lin, the righteous little citizen, you didn\u2019t expect this, did you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was calm and composed. \u201cI indeed didn\u2019t expect this. I didn\u2019t expect you all to come so soon. You were sent by Scorpion, weren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><br/><p>The man replied, \u201cIt\u2019s good that you know.\u201d</p><br/><p>Of course, he knew. He had found out just by thinking a little.</p><br/><p>Although the human trafficking organization was huge, they wouldn\u2019t do something so menacing. The only one capable of this was that \u2018Scorpion\u2019. As a drug lord, he definitely had vicious people under him.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan had screwed \u2018Scorpion\u2019 over and his buddies definitely wouldn\u2019t just let it be.</p><br/><p>Bam!</p><br/><p>Just as Lin Fan was thinking about all this, a heavy blow struck his head.</p><br/><p>It didn\u2019t hurt at all.</p><br/><p>But he knew that the opposition had wanted to knock him unconscious. He had to pretend to faint, otherwise, he would definitely be hit a few more times.</p><br/><p>Faint!</p><br/><p>It\u2019s better to just pretend to faint.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p></div>\n</div>"}

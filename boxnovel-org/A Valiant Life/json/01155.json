Moreover, they didn\u2019t have a good impression of Master Lin.</p><br/><p>However, some netizens cared very much about this matter.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen will these perfect artificial limbs be released? Will we be able to buy them in Japan?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDream on. This is a Chinese product. How could it possibly be imported here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf they\u2019re released, I\u2019ll definitely go to China just to buy a set.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou traitor. You\u2019re not using artificial limbs produced by our country but giving your money to China instead. Are you an idiot?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. Even if you beat me to death, I wouldn\u2019t go there. Those idiots can come and give us their money but we definitely won\u2019t give them our money.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cChina\u2019s perfect artificial limbs are so advanced, why can\u2019t I buy them? I shan\u2019t talk to you guys anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, the Japanese netizens went into a frenzied dispute. However, the crippled people were all paying close attention to the perfect artificial limbs.</p><br/><p>But they didn\u2019t know whether these perfect artificial limbs would be spread to their country. If the perfect artificial limbs did not reach Japan, they would have to make a trip to China.</p><br/><p>At that moment, the Japanese netizens weren\u2019t the only ones discussing this. Other countries were discussing this matter as well.</p><br/><p>Some people had posted the video of the perfect artificial limbs on the Internet. Everyone who saw the video was overwhelmed with shock.</p><br/><p>Some people tried to analyze the video, hoping that they would be able to find hints of it being edited. However, they watched it countless times and even used software to scan it but they couldn\u2019t find any issues with the video.</p><br/><p>America.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy God. Are these perfect artificial limbs really that incredible?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho knew China\u2019s research on artificial limbs was so advanced? The artificial limbs I\u2019m using now can\u2019t even be compared to those in the video.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin\u2026 It\u2019s this Master Lin again. I\u2019ve seen news about him in the past. I think he\u2019s the specialist who conquered leukemia.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe even received the Nobel Prize in Medicine. He\u2019s really amazing.\u201d</p><br/><p>The netizens of various countries were all talking about this matter. The crippled were distributed across the globe. Naturally, they wanted to become mobile and nimble. Now that these perfect artificial limbs had appeared, they were filled with curiosity.</p><br/><p>In China. On Weibo.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha. I just went to a few foreign websites to take a look. Do you know what I saw?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c^Please just say everything in one sentence. Don\u2019t just say half of it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright. I saw that the netizens of different countries are all talking about the perfect artificial limbs. Master Lin is too amazing. He\u2019s going to become well-known overseas once again.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn. Is that true? Hurry up and show us their comments. Let us see what they\u2019re saying.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, this netizen sent the screenshots of the comments on foreign websites. He even gave a description of them.</p><br/><p>At that moment, when the other netizens saw this, they were astonished. They hadn\u2019t thought that these perfect artificial limbs were so popular outside of the country as well. This really gave them a shock.</p><br/><p>But then, they started to feel very proud because Master Lin was their fellow countryman. Moreover, he lived in Shanghai.</p><br/><p>\u201cAmazing. Master Lin is really too amazing. He is so respected.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can already imagine how popular these perfect artificial limbs will be once they\u2019re manufactured. I can\u2019t wait to see that moment.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin is too f*cking awesome. I\u2019m a fan of Master Lin and no one can stop me from being a fan.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut there have been so many haters on the Internet recently.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need to care about them. Those are just Internet trolls sent by the artificial limb companies.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cloud Street!</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was just resting quietly. They were going to set off tomorrow. He was thinking about where he should visit in Haojiang.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Zhao Zhong Yang was scrolling through his phone. \u201cBrother Lin, the perfect artificial limbs have already become viral overseas. Look. Someone has posted it on foreign websites.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve gone viral overseas?\u201d Lin Fan was taken aback. Then, he laughed helplessly. This was all within his expectations.</p><br/><p>Once the perfect artificial limbs were released, they would definitely sweep across the world. But right now, Secretary Chen and Wang Ming Yang were still busy working on it. It would probably take a while more.</p><br/><p>At that moment, a car stopped outside the shop.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang and Xu Zi Le appeared. \u201cYou guys are leaving tomorrow. Let us treat you to dinner tonight.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Fraud Tian saw that the wealthy tycoon had come, he was thrilled. He quickly carried a chair over and welcomed them.</p><br/><p>To Fraud Tian, Wang Ming Yang was a tycoon. Fraud Tian had to suck up to him.</p><br/><p>\u201cTycoon, why did you suddenly think of treating us to dinner?\u201d asked Fraud Tian warmly.</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang saw this and felt helpless. Fraud Tian\u2019s habit of sucking up to tycoons had not changed at all.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang and Xu Zi Le took out two red booklets and waved them in front of the rest.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled and said, \u201cYou\u2019re really quick. You\u2019ve already gotten your certificates?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang smiled. \u201cOf course. Things should be done swiftly. Wouldn\u2019t delaying it just be a waste of time?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xu Zi Le carried a bright smile on her face as if she felt very fortunate. As she held onto Wang Ming Yang, she felt an indescribable joy in her heart.</p><br/><p>But these two little booklets made Wu You Lan very envious. She secretly glanced at Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere are we going to eat tonight?\u201d asked Lin Fan. \u201cSince you\u2019ve gotten your marriage certificates, I think we definitely have to go somewhere good.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang laughed. \u201cThat\u2019s for sure. We definitely have to go to a good place. I\u2019ve reserved a whole restaurant and called all of them over. It\u2019ll be a good opportunity for us to get together.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s pretty good. Alright. Tell us the location and I\u2019ll bring the rest there tonight.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe same old place. You know,\u201d said Wang Ming Yang. They used to eat there frequently in the past. Back then, many things had taken place there.</p><br/><p>For example, Wu You Lan\u2019s path of development had been decided at that restaurant.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was very happy that Wang Ming Yang and Xu Zi Le had gotten their marriage certificates as well. Now, Wang Ming Yang really had something to hold him down. In the future, he would have to be more careful with his actions.</p><br/><p>After the two of them left, Fraud Tian asked with a grin, \u201cKid, when do you think you will get a marriage certificate?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shot a glare at Fraud Tian. \u201cJust play with your phone and send your red packets. All you do is ask useless questions.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSigh. People these days won\u2019t even let you say anything.\u201d Fraud Tian sighed helplessly as if expressing that the world had changed.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed and didn\u2019t say more. Of course, he understood what Fraud Tian meant. But it couldn\u2019t be rushed. Things had to be taken slowly.</p><br/><p>Nighttime.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan brought everyone from the shop with him and set off towards the restaurant. When they reached, he saw many familiar people in the distance, teasing Wang Ming Yang.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin is here\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHurry up, Master Lin. We\u2019re just waiting for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. \u201cI\u2019m coming. I\u2019m coming.\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

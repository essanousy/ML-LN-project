This b*tch has been trying to harm our Master Lin. We have to kill her.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s kill her.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to destroy her.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGet out, our cheapest killing service is $50. Someone like her is not worthy of the $50 price tag. I can\u2019t do it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAwesome\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>After reading the comments, Ying Jin was infuriated. Her body started trembling with rage. \u201cThese scums, have they gone mad?\u201d Then, she looked at her agent.</p><br/><p>\u201cTell me, have I done anything wrong? Why are these rubbish scolding me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Her agent remained silent. She was stunned by this too as she hadn\u2019t expected it to be like this.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the situation online and he didn\u2019t expect the matter to be resolved so easily. Even if someone started to flame him, he just had to speak up about it and people would definitely cover the bad comments. They wouldn\u2019t have an opportunity to flame him again.</p><br/><p>This left a lot of people helpless.</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan admitted that he was the person in the picture, he was prepared to start an internet war. However, he hadn\u2019t expected that the netizens wouldn\u2019t make a big fuss out of it.</p><br/><p>Now that things had developed to this stage, he felt that he should say something to conclude the whole scandal. After thinking about it, he finally thought of what to say.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you, everyone, for your support. This scandal has been concluded. I\u2019m a pure man and I wouldn\u2019t do something so inhumane. Oh, right, I\u2019ll say something too. Ying Jin, you\u2019re f*cking ugly. You look \u2018good\u2019 when you\u2019re digging your nose. If anyone\u2019s interested, you can re-post this. I believe she looks really elegant in this posture.\u201d</p><br/><p>After that, he posted an HD picture. It was Ying Jin participating in a certain activity. She was using her index finger to dig her nose. Her eyes were opened wide and she looked like she was enjoying herself.</p><br/><p>When the picture was posted, everyone on Weibo laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, that\u2019s hilarious. Where did Master Lin get this picture from? Wasn\u2019t it removed from the internet?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe old picture from four years ago is going to be circulated again.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe looks impressive. I just vomited my dinner from last night.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI shan\u2019t say anything else. Master Lin, you\u2019re really a beast. There were two beautiful ladies accompanying you and you didn\u2019t do anything. It\u2019s depressing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cQuick, let\u2019s post this picture on Ying Jin\u2019s Weibo.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRe-posted!\u201d</p><br/><p>When Ying Jin saw the picture, she was enraged. She immediately smashed the furniture beside her.</p><br/><p>\u201cIncorrigible. He\u2019s a jerk for daring to do that.\u201d Ying Jin was furious. The thing that she was afraid of was being disclosed. The picture was the bane of her existence. When the picture had been first posted, she had spent quite a big sum of money to remove the picture from the Internet. She hadn\u2019t expected someone to post it again.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, it was posted by this fella. This fella\u2019s hardcore fans would definitely re-post it.</p><br/><p>Her agent was trembling beside her. She finally understood that if Ying Jin was to continue having a conflict with this fella, she would definitely be at a disadvantage.</p><br/><p>This time, she had tried to gain an advantage but ended up losing. She lost in an illogical manner.</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to sue you. I want to sue you for infringing my rights.\u201d Ying Jin screamed in rage. However, besides her agent, nobody else heard that.</p><br/><p>At Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed. He wasn\u2019t even bothered by Ying Jin. She was probably dancing around ecstatically and he had to suppress her.</p><br/><p>Then, someone called.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang said, \u201cHow did you do it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was confused, \u201cWhat do you mean? I don\u2019t know. Perhaps I\u2019m too popular.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you know that this was going to happen?\u201d It was no surprise that Wang Ming Yang thought of it that way. Nobody would have dared to admit it.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled, \u201cNot really. I was prepared for an Internet war. Oh, right, ask Wu Huan Yue not to be sad. This matter is over. She doesn\u2019t have to care about it anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, I told her that. She\u2019s better now.\u201d</p><br/><p>After chatting for a while longer, they hung up.</p><br/><p>The next day!</p><br/><p>Another piece of news appeared on the Internet.</p><br/><p>The media quickly followed this news and published more articles, especially since they involved Ying Jin. It was something that excited the media platforms.</p><br/><p>Reporters from Shanghai Media were fans of Lin Fan\u2019s and they didn\u2019t want to publish anything about the scandal again. They decided to focus on something else.</p><br/><p>Then, Lin Fan went to Nanshan Children\u2019s Welfare Institute after selling scallion pancakes.</p><br/><p>At the welfare institute.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cDirector Huang, when will the education block be built?\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Huang had been witnessing the changes in the welfare institute and she had never been this happy.</p><br/><p>\u201cSoon. They said it\u2019ll take about a month more.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded, \u201cAlright then, when the block is finished, the children can start to learn more knowledge. Today, I\u2019m here to teach the children a lively lesson.\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Huang knew that Master Lin was really capable and she was looking forward to it. \u201cMaster Lin, what is in the bag?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan opened the bag and there were stalks of flowering plants.</p><br/><p>\u201cI saw that the surroundings of the welfare institute are a little dull. Hence, I want to work with the children to decorate the walls around here. I\u2019ll get the kids to take care of a stalk each. It is to develop their hands-on skills too.\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Huang nodded, \u201cThat\u2019s a good idea. It can develop their skills and sense of responsibility. Master Lin, I think you\u2019re even more professional than us when it comes to educating the children.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved his hand humbly, \u201cI just do whatever that I think of. Oh, right, where are the children?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cToday\u2019s weather is a little cold. Han Lu brought the children for a run. Han Lu is a decent chap. In the few months here, I wouldn\u2019t have been able to cope without him,\u201d Director Huang complimented him, \u201cA caring and responsible chap like him is hard to find these days.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan arrived at the stadium behind the welfare institute, Han Lu was leading the children in the exercises.</p><br/><p>He stood there and smiled when he saw Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Han Lu said, \u201cMaster Lin, you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Lin Fan nodded. Then, he patted Han Lu\u2019s shoulder, \u201cNot bad!\u201d</p><br/><p>Han Lu smiled, \u201cI don\u2019t have any other talents. I only know how to train them physically. Hence, I brought the kids here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cThat\u2019s okay. I brought some stalks of flowering plants for the children to plant. It will add some color to their lives here. You can help us too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Han Lu nodded. Then, he clapped, \u201cTime to gather\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The children were ecstatic when they saw Lin Fan, \u201cUncle Lin\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled brilliantly, it was a great feeling to be so welcomed.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, everyone, stand straight. Today, I brought some flowering plants for all of you. Let\u2019s plant them together, shall we?\u201d Lin Fan smiled and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Those plants weren\u2019t expensive. They were exchanged for with points at the Encyclopedic departmental store. Furthermore, they were different from those outside. They were easy to take care of and they didn\u2019t have any flaws. The vital moment would be when the flowers start to bloom. That would be beautiful.</p><br/><p>He just wanted to develop the children\u2019s interest and earn some Encyclopedic Points at the same time.</p><br/><p>If some of the kids were talented in flower art, they might become amazing florists in the future.</p><br/><p>No, they definitely would become amazing florists in the future.</p><br/><p>With someone like him as their teacher, what other problems could they encounter?</p></div>\n</div>"}

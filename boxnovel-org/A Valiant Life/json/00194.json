If it was something else, he could just let it slide, but he couldn't let this go. The car that they saw at the open-air carpark was right in front of them.</p><br/><p>This little game of theirs was a game of life and death. If Lin Fan hadn't reacted quickly enough, his car would've crashed into theirs. If that happened, then things would've been really bad. Although it didn't happen, the sudden braking still caused Wu Huan Yue's forehead to be split open. Something had to be done about this.</p><br/><p>They were on the road, so even though Lin couldn't just stop his car, it wouldn't do him good to overtake the car in front. Hence, he followed behind the car. \"Let's see where you'll go,\" Lin Fan thought.</p><br/><p>In the sports car.</p><br/><p>Yang Jie looked back. That black Mercedes-Benz was following behind. He laughed, \"Brother Yao, that fella is following behind us.\"</p><br/><p>Wang Yao sniggered, \"Hey, looks like he's not happy. But don't worry, on the road, there are always accidents that happen. What can he do to us?\"</p><br/><p>Yang Jie nodded, \"You're right. Brother Yao, should we go to school today? We haven't gone in a long time. They won't fail us, will they?\"</p><br/><p>Wang Yao said, \"If they fail us, then let them fail us. There's nothing in this world that can't be settled with money. If something can't be settled, it just means that you don't have enough money.\"</p><br/><p>Yang Jie looked at him with envy and said, \"Brother Yao is amazing. Not only your driving skills are great, but you also have such a wealthy family, unlike my middle-class family. If it wasn't for Brother Yao, I might still be eating that sh*tty food from the canteen.\"</p><br/><p>Wang Yao was filled with pride, \"Just follow me obediently. In the future, whatever that I, Wang Yao, possess, you will have a share as well.</p><br/><p>Yang Jie nodded excitedly, \"I'll definitely follow Brother Yao obediently. As long as I follow Brother Yao, I won't have to suffer.\"</p><br/><p>\"Hahaha!\"</p><br/><p>There was a red traffic light in front.</p><br/><p>The car slowly came to a halt.</p><br/><p>Yang Jie pulled on Wang Yao, \"Brother Yao, that fella got off his car. He seems to be coming towards us.\"</p><br/><p>Wang Yao turned around and looked. He chuckled and said, \"What's there to be afraid of? We have two people. He's just one guy. How could we be scared?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan had gotten off the car. He said to Wu You Lan, \"Don't leave the car. Take good care of Huan Yue.\"</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan nodded. She took a piece of tissue, then poured some mineral water on it. She wiped the blood from Wu Huan Yue's forehead. Fortunately, the wound wasn't big. It was just a small cut. After they go to the clinic to get some medication, it shouldn't leave a scar.</p><br/><p>\"Huan Yue, are you alright?\" asked Wu You Lan.</p><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue nodded, \"I'm fine, thank you.\"</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan replied, \"There's no need to thank me. That car in front is outrageous. How could they do something like that?\"</p><br/><p>At that moment, Wu Huan Yue noticed that Master Lin had gotten off the car. She instantly got worried, \"Master Lin, he\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan comforted her. Full of confidence, she said, \"Don't worry. Master Lin is very powerful. Nothing will happen to him.\"</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Wang Yao said to Yang Jie, \"Let's go. Get off the car.\"</p><br/><p>They opened the car doors. As if they weren't afraid at all, they went to the back of the car and leaned on the car as they stared at Lin Fan with scornful eyes.</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>\"What do you want?\" Wang Yao said challengingly with a tilt of his head.</p><br/><p>Then, Yang Jie shouted, \"Brother Yang is asking you a question! Are you deaf?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan gazed at the two of them. They were young. Roughly nineteen or twenty years old.</p><br/><p>\"You're asking me what I want? Don't you guys remember what just happened?\"</p><br/><p>Wang Yao laughed, \"Oh, that. That was an accident. Did I even crash into you? I didn't even touch you. What do you want from me? And why don't you just try to keep looking at me with that stare?\"</p><br/><p>Wang Yao raised his hand and pointed at Lin Fan. He was talking threateningly, with no regard for Master Lin at all.</p><br/><p>*a series of footsteps*</p><br/><p>Lin Fan grabbed onto Wang Yao's finger with a swipe of his hand. Wang Yao was in so much pain that he gasped for air, \"Let go...let go of me\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Bam!</p><br/><p>A hard slap was flung across his face.</p><br/><p>Wang Yao was knocked groggy by the slap. His body unsteadily fell onto his backside. Then, he looked at Lin Fan in disbelief. He never thought that this fella would dare to hit him.</p><br/><p>When Yang Jie saw that this fella actually made a move on his buddy, he was stunned. In disbelief, he uttered, \"You...you\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan raised his hand. Yang Jie was so frightened that he hid next to Wang Yao, \"Brother Yao, this guy is crazy!\"</p><br/><p>\"You dare to hit me?\" with his palm holding his face, Wang Yao growled ferociously at Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed, \"You've already been hit, why are you still asking me if I dare?\"</p><br/><p>Wang Yao was dumbfounded. He had never come across such a person before. In the past, when he used his 'Godly Dragon Tail Strike' on other people, their victims all lost any will to retaliate when they saw his car. However, this situation was strange. A Mercedes-Benz driver actually dared to challenge him.</p><br/><p>At that moment, the red light turned green. The cars behind were all pressing their horns.</p><br/><p>Wang Yao sensed that the situation was not in his favor, so he pointed at Lin Fan and said, \"Don't get too arrogant. You're lucky today. The red light has changed and I don't want to hold up the traffic. Otherwise, you'd be dead.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan stepped forward and stood right in front of Wang Yao. He said in disdain, \"Even you know the traffic rules? Today, I don't want to be lucky. You better clear things up with me, otherwise, don't even think of leaving.\"</p><br/><p>\"You\u2026\" Wang Yao pointed at Lin Fan. He was usually daring, but up against this ruthless person, even he was slightly terrified.</p><br/><p>\"What's going on?\" At that moment, the traffic police arrived. When he saw the situation, he raised an eyebrow.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan answered, \"It's a traffic accident. We crashed, so now I'm settling things with him.\"</p><br/><p>When Wang Yao saw the police, he gained back some courage. He went forward and grabbed Lin Fan, \"This f*cking idiot hit me! I want to sue him for assault! My face is so swollen now that I can't even feel it.\"</p><br/><p>The traffic policeman looked at both cars. They were both luxurious cars. He didn't understand the situation but when he saw Wang Yao's car plate, he thought it was familiar. If he remembered correctly, this car plate had violated the traffic rules numerous times and caused multiple traffic accidents. His driving license was supposed to have been revoked, but he always ended up receiving a pardon.</p><br/><p>The traffic police asked, \"Did you hit him?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan didn't say anything. On the other hand, Wang Yao couldn't wait to say something, \"Don't even think of not admitting it. My friend here saw it.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan furrowed his brows, then flung another slap at him. Then, he looked at the traffic policeman and said, \"That was how I hit him just now.\"</p><br/><p>The strength behind this slap was not little. Wang Yao felt dizzy and his vision blurred. A flame in his belly started raging, \"Motherf*cker, just you wait!\"</p><br/><p>The traffic policeman immediately restrained Lin Fan, \"Don't fight\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Wang Yao whipped out his phone and dialed a number, \"Dad, someone hit me. I'm at the traffic light along Golden-Red road. Come quickly, otherwise, I'll be beaten to death.\"</p><br/><p>After he hung up, he pointed at Lin Fan, \"Stay right there. I'll have my father come to talk to you.\" </p><br/><p>At a certain service company.</p><br/><p>When Wang Shen received the call from his son, he was furious. That son was causing trouble all the time.</p><br/><p>At that moment, in front of Wang Shen stood a man with a great temper and a fierce aura, \"Brother Yang, this is the money collected from the past three visits. After deducting the expenses, our profit is two hundred and ten million dollars.\"</p><br/><p>Wang Shen frowned, \"Looks like it decreased significantly from last year's.\"</p><br/><p>The man nodded, \"Yes, the number of meddlesome people is getting higher and higher. There's even a new rule at train stations that prohibit begging inside. And the checks have been getting stricter recently. That's why our profit has decreased so much from last year.</p><br/><p>Wang Shen nodded, \"Alright, let's not bother with this for now. I need you to follow me to settle something. This kid of mine keeps causing trouble all day. Someday, he'll run out of luck. I'm afraid the company has to rely on you guys in future. That brat isn't reliable.\"</p><br/><p>The man didn't say anything. He just followed silently behind Wang Shen.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

It was as if a group of people had been waiting at the corners of the Internet for such an incident to happen.</p><br/><p>The next day, news articles flooded the Internet.</p><br/><p>\u201cWu Huan Yue is nothing without Master Lin\u2019s songs.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not true that Master Lin can do anything. He can only write Chinese songs.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDiscussion: The importance of one man\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBreaking news! You would not believe that Wu Huan\u2019s Yue\u2019s most important man is him\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf there\u2019s no Master Lin, there\u2019s no Wu Huan Yue.\u201d</p><br/><p>The netizens who woke up in the morning were stunned when they saw this news. To them, it seemed that some people were clearly looking for trouble.</p><br/><p>Moreover, it felt as if those people were looking for trouble at the slightest opportunity. They were leaving no stone unturned.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn. What happened to this world? I just woke up and I\u2019m seeing such news. Who exactly did Wu Huan Yue offend to get flamed like this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho knows? I\u2019m puzzled now too. So what if Master Lin can\u2019t write English songs? Why do people these days seem to think that knowing how to write English songs makes one superior?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow terrifying. Even in China, you get looked down on for not knowing English. That\u2019s f*cking idiotic.\u201d</p><br/><p>The netizens starting commenting in a frenzy. They felt that this whole incident was f*cking stupid.</p><br/><p>Right now, most people were already fans of Master Lin. After all, Master Lin was so amazing. He had accomplished so much and he had long been etched into the hearts of the people. Not knowing some stuff was perfectly normal.</p><br/><p>And if you adored someone, you had to love the people around him as well. Hence, they really liked the people by Master Lin\u2019s side.</p><br/><p>They would support Wu Huan Yue\u2019s every song, especially because they were all written by Master Lin.</p><br/><p>And because of this, Wu Huan Yue\u2019s Weibo had garnered a lot of attention. There were generally very few haters. Even if there were haters, they would get flamed by the rest of the netizens.</p><br/><p>This situation made a lot of people in the industry very envious. They felt as if Wu Huan Yue was surrounded by a sphere of luck.</p><br/><p>And that luck was Master Lin.</p><br/><p>If anyone had Master Lin helping him or her like that, he or she would become unstoppable.</p><br/><p>In the office.</p><br/><p>When Yang Qian saw the news, her face turned red from anger. She rushed over to Wu Huan Yue with her phone.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuan Yue, look. What is all this? What\u2019s wrong with people these days? They just keep flaming you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue had been thinking about something else. When she saw the news, she just smiled. She didn\u2019t seem angry at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuan Yue, aren\u2019t you angry?\u201d asked Yang Qian.</p><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue smiled. \u201cWhy would I be angry? I think they\u2019re right. Actually, Brother Lin has been helping me all along. All I was doing was using my voice. If someone else sang Brother Lin\u2019s songs, she would definitely be even more popular. So there\u2019s nothing wrong with what they\u2019re saying.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yang Qian tilted her head. \u201cHuan Yue, how can you think like that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, alright. There\u2019s no need to care about this. Actually, it\u2019s nothing at all,\u201d said Wu Huan Yue with a smile. She really didn\u2019t seem to mind.</p><br/><p>Cloud Street!</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan came to the shop, the townsfolk were already queuing and waiting for the scallion pancakes. To them, coming here to buy scallion pancakes every day was the happiest thing.</p><br/><p>Though the limit of ten servings a day was way too low, they had gradually developed a habit of coming here to queue every day even if they wouldn\u2019t be able to buy the scallion pancakes.</p><br/><p>After preparing all the scallion pancakes, Lin Fan leaned back on the chair.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Lin, did you see the news?\u201d asked Wu You Lan.</p><br/><p>\u201cNews? What news?\u201d asked Lin Fan curiously. He had not used his phone since the previous night. But looking at Wu You Lan\u2019s expression, it seemed that something had happened. Then, he took out his phone and opened his Weibo app to look at the news.</p><br/><p>But when he saw the news, he was taken aback.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn. I\u2019m getting shot at while lying down again. Who is this Zheng Ya anyway? I\u2019ve never heard of him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was curious. This guy was too unbridled. He was messing with Lin Fan\u2019s friend. Moreover, this guy\u2019s Weibo post seemed a little cocky. Lin Fan could not stand it.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was dumbfounded. This guy was just causing trouble out of nothing.</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang said, \u201cD*mn. Brother Lin, this guy deliberately said something like this. He can\u2019t be forgiven.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian was curious too. \u201cWhat is it? What happened now? Could it be that another guy doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s good for him? Is he trying to mislead the public on the Internet?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shook his head. \u201cNo. I just went home for a rest. How did so many things happen so fast? Sigh. It can\u2019t be helped. It seems that I\u2019ll have to get busy again.\u201d</p><br/><p>He opened up Weibo and thought for a moment. He had to settle this matter perfectly.</p><br/><p>In the end, he thought of the words and started typing. Then, he posted it.</p><br/><p>\u201cRegarding whether Wu Huan Yue would be popular without me, there\u2019s no need to even discuss that. Because I will always compose songs for her. As long as she sings, I will continue to compose songs. That\u2019s why that scenario is not even possible. Don\u2019t say that I\u2019ll run out of ideas or things like that. I have a lot of songs. It wouldn\u2019t even be a problem to compose one song every day.\u201d</p><br/><p>After this post was sent, he thought for a moment and sent another comment.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho says I can\u2019t write English songs just because my English isn\u2019t good? I forgot to mention yesterday that Wu Huan Yue is going to participate in the competition too. Her songs will be composed by me. I only said that my English isn\u2019t good, but I didn\u2019t say that I can\u2019t write English songs. You guys are overthinking this.\u201d</p><br/><p>When these two comments were posted, the netizens on Weibo were completely stunned.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn! Master Lin is way too domineering!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, I\u2019m dying of laughter. Master Lin is just that domineering. He\u2019s basically sending out a challenge.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c666\u2026 I have no words. How does that even make sense? He can write English songs without knowing English? Why do I feel like it isn\u2019t quite right? It seems contradictory.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c^It\u2019s not contradictory at all because this is Master Lin. Just don\u2019t overthink it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. If Master Lin says that it\u2019s not contradictory, then it means it\u2019s not contradictory.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t wait. I wonder what kind of songs Master Lin will compose. I really can\u2019t wait.\u201d</p><br/><p>In an instant, the Internet was lively with comments.</p><br/><p>When Zheng Ya saw Master Lin\u2019s post, he was stunned. It was as if he couldn\u2019t believe it. But somehow, he just felt uneasy.</p><br/><p>He had received many warnings from friends not to go against Master Lin, but he had felt unyielding. However, he had still heeded their warning and didn\u2019t explicitly offend Master Lin. He had indirectly belittled Wu Huan Yue instead.</p><br/><p>Although he was very confident in his own abilities, if he ended up losing the competition, he would be slapping himself in the face.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

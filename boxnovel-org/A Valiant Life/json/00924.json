Moreover, the news couldn\u2019t be distributed unrestrainedly. After all, it had to do with superstitious beliefs. The relevant news departments had to control its distribution.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan wasn\u2019t bothered about this incident. He didn\u2019t want the news to continue spreading, so he didn\u2019t come out to explain the incident.</p><br/><p>Also, in the past few days, Nanshan Children\u2019s Welfare Institute\u2019s teaching block\u2019s construction had finally been completed. Today was the day of its opening ceremony.</p><br/><p>At the entrance of Nanshan Children\u2019s Welfare Institute.</p><br/><p>\u201cWelcome, welcome.\u201d Lin Fan was standing there with Director Huang, Han Lu, and the rest at the side. They were receiving the guests who were coming for the opening ceremony.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-2\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, congratulations!\u201d an entrepreneur came forward to shake Lin Fan\u2019s hand. He was all smiles and he had even brought a flower basket and a banner.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease enter.\u201d</p><br/><p>People came one after another. To Lin Fan, this would probably be a very busy day.</p><br/><p>And this opening ceremony for Nanshan Children\u2019s Welfare Institute\u2019s teaching block had attracted many reporters as well. To these reporters, since this matter was related to Master Lin, they had to come.</p><br/><p>When they reached the venue, the reporters were surprised. They knew that Master Lin knew many people in Shanghai but when they reached the venue, they realized that they had underestimated Master Lin all along.</p><br/><p>There were way too many entrepreneurs there and the reporters knew many of them, because, at some of the government commercial meets, these entrepreneurs would be there too.</p><br/><p>Then, a sedan stopped in front of the welfare institute.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang and Wu Yun Gang alighted. Wu Yun Gang, in particular, immediately rushed to Lin Fan. He grumbled, \u201cMaster Lin, don\u2019t you treat me as your friend anymore? Such a big incident and you didn\u2019t even inform me in advance. If Wang Ming Yang hadn\u2019t told me, I probably wouldn\u2019t have known!\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-3\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled. \u201cChief Wu, you were in Beijing and this isn\u2019t a big incident at all. It\u2019s just a simple event.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Yun Gang patted Lin Fan\u2019s shoulder. \u201cMaster Lin, that isn\u2019t right of you to say. You\u2019ve helped me so many times. Even if we don\u2019t talk about those old incidents, you\u2019ve helped me recently as well. We\u2019re friends. How could I not come to your event?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was at a loss for words. In the end, he could only utter helplessly, \u201cAlright, alright. It was my mistake. Ming Yang, why don\u2019t you and Chief Wu go in first?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d Wang Ming Yang nodded and didn\u2019t say more to Lin Fan. He knew that this brother of his was probably very busy that day.</p><br/><p>The reporters kept taking photos from the side. As one of the outstanding entrepreneurs of Shanghai, Wang Ming Yang was naturally known by the reporters.</p><br/><p>From the Internet, they knew that Master Lin and Wang Ming Yang knew each other but they couldn\u2019t figure out the relationship between the two. Just how close were they?</p><br/><p>Now that they had seen their expressions towards each other and their style of speech, they realized that their relationship was actually this close.</p><br/><p>Director Huang had worked at Nanshan Children\u2019s Welfare Institute for a very long time. Her biggest wish had always been for the welfare institute to be valued by society.</p><br/><p>But she had worked for a long time with minimal results. At times, their operational funds had been very scarce.</p><br/><p>But ever since Master Lin had taken over, the situation had been changed greatly.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-4\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Seeing the welfare institute get better and better, she really felt joyful on the inside and she started to have great hope for the children\u2019s future.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin\u2026\u201d At that moment, He Cheng Han alighted from his car. He was all smiles as the two of them shook hands. \u201cCongratulations, Master Lin! Nanshan Children\u2019s Welfare Institute is becoming officially recognized.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI just want to give the children a good education. Come, please enter. Ming Yang and the rest are already inside,\u201d said Lin Fan with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright. I know you\u2019re busy today.\u201d He Cheng Han nodded. Then, he swept the area with his gaze and saw many familiar people. He went to greet them with a smile.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan hadn\u2019t expected so many people to come for the opening ceremony of the teaching block.</p><br/><p>But this proved that he hadn\u2019t wasted his time in Shanghai. With so many people here to show their support, the place was bustling with life.</p><br/><p>At that moment, the sound of a vehicle in the distance could be heard.</p><br/><p>When everyone saw that car plate, they were slightly startled. It looked quite familiar.</p><br/><p>And when the person alighted, all the entrepreneurs were shocked. They hadn\u2019t expected a super major figure to appear.</p><br/><p>Lu Corporation\u2019s Lu Li had actually come.</p><br/><p>When the reporters saw him, they were shaken as well. Their cameras flashed as they quickly captured photos and videos.</p><br/><p>When they had seen all these entrepreneurs, they had been surprised but they hadn\u2019t been shocked. Now, however, it was different. Shanghai\u2019s biggest entrepreneur, the head of the Lu Corporation, was here. Usually, when reporters wanted to interview Lu Li, they didn\u2019t really have any chance at all, because his schedule was always packed daily.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-5\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Now that the opening of Master Lin\u2019s teaching block had attracted Lu Li, it was simply inconceivable to them.</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan saw him, he became a little curious. <em>Why is this guy here? I\u2019ve only interacted with him once and I haven\u2019t really come into contact with him since.</em></p><br/><p>\u201cChief Lu, you\u2019re a very busy man. Why are you here?\u201d asked Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>When the reporters heard this, they let out expressions of disbelief. To them, anyone else would have run forward passionately to shake Lu Li\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>But what was Master Lin saying now? \u2018Why are you here?\u2019 It was as if he hadn\u2019t invited Lu Li. That was way too shocking for the reporters.</p><br/><p>But then, something that shocked them even more happened.</p><br/><p>Lu Li seemed not to be bothered at all. He smiled and said, \u201cMaster Lin, I heard that your welfare institute\u2019s teaching block has finished construction. You didn\u2019t even invite me. I definitely had to come and take a look. Am I, Lu Li, not welcome?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha,\u201d Lin Fan started laughing. \u201cAlright, Chief Lu. You\u2019re very welcome! I\u2019ve troubled a busy man like yourself to come all the way here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Li was very curious about Lin Fan. The first time that they interacted had been an incident involving Lin Fan\u2019s shop. At that time, they had only interacted very briefly.</p><br/><p>Later on, due to bad luck, Lu Li had gotten kidnapped and Lin Fan had saved his life. Hence, in his heart, Lu Li was very grateful to Master Lin.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-6\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>When he heard that the construction of the welfare institute\u2019s teaching block had been completed and that there would be an opening ceremony, he had pushed all his other work aside just to come and join in the ceremony.</p><br/><p>Director Huang and the rest were all standing there. Initially, they had been very excited because of the opening of the teaching block but now that there were more and more people of high-status coming in, they started to become nervous.</p><br/><p>Almost everyone had reached.</p><br/><p>Inside the welfare institute.</p><br/><p>The children were all sat on stools. They were all very excited because they knew that they would be able to start studying and they would even have teachers.</p><br/><p>Because the teaching block was going to be opened, Lin Fan had gotten the teachers that he had hired to come to the welfare institute to interact with the children and grow closer to them.</p><br/><p>That would increase their familiarity and comfort with each other.</p></div>\n</div>"}

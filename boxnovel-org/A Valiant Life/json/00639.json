The road leading to the airport is jammed with cars.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt can\u2019t be? There isn\u2019t any huge national event today. Why is the road jammed?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know. I just got the news just now that Master Lin is about to leave Qing Zhou, and many citizens have gone to send him off. There are at least five thousand private cars headed in the direction of the airport, and the number of taxis is just too many to count.\u201d</p><br/><p>The captain gave orders for his men to go down to the airport to control the flow of traffic. Such a huge influx of vehicles wasn\u2019t a good thing.</p><br/><p>On the road towards the airport.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>wo cars lightly collided with each other.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn, how do you drive? I just got this car.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother, sorry about it. Can I leave you my number? I\u2019m rushing to the airport to send Master Lin off. I\u2019ll be back to settle this, and don\u2019t you worry. I\u2019ll pay you back whatever is needed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to send Master Lin off too? Don\u2019t sweat it. Come, get back into your car. This isn\u2019t a big issue, I have insurance anyway.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut I caused the damage\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo problem, it\u2019s only a little scratch, nothing much really.\u201d</p><br/><p>This kind of incident happened a few times throughout the whole road. After finding out that both parties were rushing to the airport to send Master Lin off, everyone started becoming more cordial and their attitudes became more pleasant.</p><br/><p>All because of Lin Fan, strangers became friends, and some even became close pals in the future.</p><br/><p>The traffic police.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s weird. So many traffic incidents today, and none of them came to us to settle their dispute. Instead, they just went their own way.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho knows? The great evil has passed from Qing Zhou, I\u2019m sure everyone is too happy to care.\u201d</p><br/><p>At the airport.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t have to pay the fare, Master Lin. If you do, I can\u2019t live with myself. If they rest knew that I sent you to the airport and collected your money, I would be nagged to death,\u201d the driver said.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis\u2026\u201d Lin Fan was in a predicament, before examining the driver. \u201cHow about this. I see that your driving has caused your hip to be a little pronated, and that probably is causing a little pain for you. What about I fix you up and you can take that as cab fare?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve had this problem for quite a while and I\u2019ve tried all methods to fix or lessen the pain. Nothing has worked.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan placed his palms against the driver\u2019s hips as he started brushing it across.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh, it feels way better. It doesn\u2019t hurt anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>Alright, I\u2019ll see you when I see you,\u201d Lin Fan smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait Master Lin, can I take a selfie with you?\u201d the driver said, foraging for his phone.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan couldn\u2019t turn down such a small request, and so he nodded his head in agreement.</p><br/><p>After taking a picture, the driver smiled. He felt like he was on cloud nine.</p><br/><p>As Lin Fan walked into the airport, a shocking scene greeted him. It was packed with people and the people from outside started streaming in as well. His driver who was still outside shouted loudly, \u201cMaster Lin just walked in, come let us all send him off!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan still didn\u2019t know that the crowd was all at the airport because of him. If he knew, he would have been shocked beyond words.</p><br/><p>A fragrant smell hit him in the face, as Lin Fan realized beside him was a lady. One of them had a slender body. She was wearing a cap and a face mask.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan\u2019s eyes met with hers, and the lady looked at Lin Fan, tipping her cap to hide her face, as if she was scared to have people recognize her.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked away, not knowing what had just happened. He continued to make his way to the security clearance.</p><br/><p>The lady who was wearing the cap turned to her manager, \u201cThat was a close call. I almost got recognized by that guy over there. Otherwise, it will turn into another fanfare and it\u2019ll be difficult to leave this place.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, with you in that attire, no one will recognize you. It\u2019s a hundred percent safe, and no fans will bother you,\u201d the manager said.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat is great.\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly!</p><br/><p>\u201cWait.\u201d</p><br/><p>A wave of voices spread from the back of the airport.</p><br/><p>The lad who was wearing the cap looked on helplessly. \u201cHow is this possible? I concealed myself already! How did the fans figure out who I was? I guess I can\u2019t have a moment of peace.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh, being popular isn\u2019t too bad. Since we\u2019ve been found out, let\u2019s just greet the fans courteously.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two people looked as if they were talking to themselves, unaware of what was going on around them.</p><br/><p>The lady wearing the cap took off her face mask. If people examined her, they would have realized that she was the popular Queen of entertainment in the country. When she looked at the fans behind her, she was absolutely stunned.</p><br/><p>How many people were there?</p><br/><p>That was such a grand appearance by her fan club.</p><br/><p>A group of people rushed over, and the lady in the cap started looking terrified. She didn\u2019t have a bodyguard with her. How was she going to protect herself against the shoving of her fans.</p><br/><p>But something even more shocking happened. The group of people just ran past them, not paying any attention to both of them at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, wait\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan had already entered the security clearance, and after hearing someone call his name, he turned back, looking stunned.</p><br/><p>What on earth was happening?</p><br/><p>The citizens heaved a sigh of relief. They had finally caught up with Master Lin.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, we are here to send you off. Thank you for all you have done for us\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. Please come back often to Qing Zhou. We will always welcome you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, I love you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSafe journey, Master Lin!\u201d</p><br/><p>The security guards were shocked. They had never seen this kind of scenario before.</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry to trouble you guys, but could I say a few words to them?\u201d Lin Fan said, before crossing back to the departure hall. \u201cGuys, thank you so much! It was only a small thing. I\u2019m about to board my plane. If I have the chance, I\u2019ll definitely pop by Qing Zhou.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho is that person?\u201d the lady wearing the cap said, looking at her manager.</p><br/><p>The manager shook his head. \u201cNot sure. Wait, is that Master Lin? Could it be him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho?\u201d the lady celebrity who was wearing a cap said.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe famous Master Lin from Weibo,\u201d the manager replied.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Lin Fan never thought that so many citizens of Qing Zhou would send him off.</p><br/><p>He thought that what he did was normal, and with so many people sending him off, he finally felt what it was like to be a celebrity.</p><br/><p>Alright, I\u2019ll see you guys soon. Right, remember to pay attention to my Weibo. I haven\u2019t had much viewership in quite some time,\u201d Lin Fan said, waving them goodbye.</p><br/><p>Such an important reminder and he almost forgot about it.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry Master Lin, we will definitely do that!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. You are definitely our most favorite person in Qing Zhou. We will definitely pay attention to your Weibo!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan gave a thumbs up, \u201cThank you guys so much!\u201d Thereafter, he turned back and sauntered back into the security gate.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Walking towards the boarding gate.</p><br/><p>Ding ding!</p><br/><p>His phone started ringing.</p><br/><p>It was an unknown number.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello, who is this?\u201d Lin Fan said into the phone.</p><br/><p>A gloomy voice came from the other end of the phone. \u201cMaster Lin, good on you to be able to move even my people. I just hope you can laugh to the end.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan furrowed his brows. \u201cWho the hell are you? Are you pulling a prank, trying to threaten me like that? If you have the balls, say it in front of my face. You better believe that I\u2019ll beat you to a pulp. Bring your friends and father along as well\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Du du!</p><br/><p>The phone suddenly hung up.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at his phone, puzzled before dialing back the number. \u201cWhat the hell do you want with me? Threatening me and then running. Was that very fun? What the hell are you now? I\u2019m at the airport now. If you have the balls, tell me where you are now. I\u2019ll change my plane ticket for you and go over to where you are to teach you a lesson!\u201d</p><br/><p>Du du!</p><br/><p>The phone was hung up again.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was getting annoyed. He called back again, but the other party didn\u2019t say anything else.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you speaking? Can you have a little more balls? Instead of hanging up, come here and face me. I have all the time in the world.\u201d</p><br/><p>The other party said just said emotionlessly.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m turning off the phone.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p></div>\n</div>"}

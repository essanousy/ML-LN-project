Everyone was stunned. They hadn't expected it to turn out like this. They felt that Wang Ming Yang was lucky that he hadn't played along with him. If not, he'd have lost a huge amount of money.</p><br/><p>\"Brother Wang, I know what you mean. You've known me for a pretty long time now. This is how I gamble. I just let the cards do the talking. After all, we're just after the thrill. If I wasn't confident, do you think I could be so ruthless?\" Chen Li Hao was ecstatic. This set of cards was indeed extremely good. Who'd dare to challenge him?</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang shook his head and stood up. He felt that this guy couldn't be persuaded. The reason why he had stopped playing was that his cards were too good, not because they were too lousy. These three cards that cost less than ten cents could destroy Chen Li Hao and his life's hard work.</p><br/><p>Chen Li Hao arranged the money on the table. He was grinning after winning all the money. Especially since he had drawn such a good set of cards. He was simply too ecstatic.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan had to remain neutral regarding Wang Ming Yang's actions. They weren't fantastic nor extremely bad.</p><br/><p>\"Brother Ming Yang, what did you get?\" Zhu Zhu went forward and flipped the cards.</p><br/><p>Chen Li Hao chuckled, \"What kind of cards could you get? No matter how good they are, they\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Chen Li Hao froze. He was shocked. His eyes widened. Those three cards were dazzling.</p><br/><p>Wow!</p><br/><p>Everyone was shocked.</p><br/><p>\"It's three aces. Ming Yang is\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"I didn't expect it. Didn't expect it at all.\"</p><br/><p>\"Li Hao gambled his entire net worth. If Ming Yang had opened his cards, what would the outcome turn out to be?\"</p><br/><p>After the question was asked, everyone was deep in thought.</p><br/><p>There could only be one outcome. It would be that Li Hao would lose his everything, even the things that he had previously owned.</p><br/><p>Zhu Zhu didn't like Chen Li Hao at all and when she saw the three cards, she immediately threw them on the pile of money. She sneered, \"It's indeed extremely good.\"</p><br/><p>\"I\u2026\" Chen Li Hao was shocked. He was speechless after seeing the three cards. He felt like everything that he had gotten was a joke.</p><br/><p>\"Brother Wang, you\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang didn't make any expression but he was extremely shocked. His cards hadn't been like that. It was only after Lin Fan had touched them that they became three aces. It was simply unbelievable. Could it be Lin Fan that knew magic? But that was impossible. He had known Lin Fan for so long and he had never heard of Lin Fan gambling. Lin Fan's confident and mysterious smile, in particular, made him even more suspicious. Although he claimed to be his best friend, he always found Lin Fan a little mysterious.</p><br/><p>At that moment, he didn't want to think about it any further. Li Hao's situation was so unfavorable. If someone were to go all in on him, he would probably lose everything.</p><br/><p>\"Li Hao, don't gamble like this in the future anymore. It's simply not worth it to bet everything on three pieces of cards,\" Wang Ming Yang said.</p><br/><p>Chen Li Hao felt a little guilty but he was a little addicted to gambling, especially the thrill he got from it. It was something that he couldn't express.</p><br/><p>Especially when the game was at its climax, the deciding factor was on the cards. That feeling of excitement satisfied him a lot. If he won, the excitement would be even more intense.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan stood aside and watched. He felt that Wang Ming Yang's words were useless. Although it would make Li Hao feel grateful, it would only last for a moment. It would probably have no effect after that.</p><br/><p>If he wanted to make him stop, there was only this way.</p><br/><p>It was to turn excitement into fear.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \"You like to gamble, right?\"</p><br/><p>Chen Li Hao looked at Lin Fan and nodded. \"Gambling brings excitement and thrill to me.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed. Excitement? This would definitely excite people.</p><br/><p>\"Let me try playing with you,\" Lin Fan laughed.</p><br/><p>After unlocking the gambling classification, he had never put it to use before and he wanted to test it.</p><br/><p>Chen Li Hao was shocked. It was as if he had heard something wrong. \"You want to try?\"</p><br/><p>\"Why? Don't you want to give it a try?\" Lin Fan laughed.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang looked at Lin Fan and wanted to say something but he didn't say anything after thinking about it. He wasn't afraid that Lin Fan would lose. He was afraid that things would go out of hand. That would be extremely troublesome.</p><br/><p>Since there was someone that was willing to gamble with him, Chen Li Hao was extremely excited. He quickly forgot about how Wang Ming Yang had shown him mercy. \"Alright, let's go then.\"</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang was shocked. He hadn't expected Li Hao to continue. That\u2026</p><br/><p>Lin Fan patted Wang Ming Yang on his shoulder. \"Give me some money. Since he likes the thrill, let's have some fun.\"</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang sighed helplessly as he looked at Lin Fan's smirk. Then, he went into his room to get money.</p><br/><p>Zhu Zhu glared at Chen Li Hao. It was simply impossible for him to turn over a new leaf. It seemed like he had forgotten about what had happened.</p><br/><p>At the same time, they were wondering what Master Lin was doing. Why would he want to gamble with Chen Li Hao?</p><br/><p>\"What do you want to gamble with?\" Chen Li Hao asked. Then, he looked at the others. \"Are you guys in?\"</p><br/><p>\"Nope,\" the others replied. Obviously, they didn't want to play anymore. At the same time, they swore to never gamble with Chen Li Hao again.</p><br/><p>\"How boring,\" Chen Li Hao said as he shook his head. Then, he looked at Lin Fan. \"Since they're not playing, let's play 'Golden Flower'. It's my favorite card game.\"</p><br/><p>\"Alright.\" Lin Fan wasn't particular about it. He knew that Li Hao couldn't possibly win him.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang took a briefcase over and placed it beside Lin Fan. Then, he whispered, \"Don't get too serious about it. Li Hao isn't a bad person after all.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded. \"Wanna join us?\"</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang was shocked. But he nodded.</p><br/><p>Chen Li Hao laughed, \"The more the merrier. Let's see who gets to shuffle the cards.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was selected to be the shuffler.</p><br/><p>\"Shuffle the cards then,\" Chen Li Hao said. He was feeling joyous again.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan didn't use any tricks. He just shuffled the cards normally. Then, he gave them out.</p><br/><p>Chen Li Hao didn't look at his cards and just took them one by one.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan and Wang Ming Yang did the same.</p><br/><p>Chen Li Hao didn't even look at his cards and immediately threw money on the table.</p><br/><p>The people that were watching the game were shocked. He seemed like he was gambling with even higher stakes than before. They didn't know what was going on. They could've ended the game earlier but they decided to play another game.</p><br/><p>\"Alright, it's time to look at the cards,\" Chen Li Hao chuckled. He happily raised the cards and took a careful look at them. When he saw the first card, he was ecstatic. He laughed even louder as he saw the second card and when he saw the third one, his heart was literally beating out of his chest.</p><br/><p>D*mn, my luck is too good.</p><br/><p>Chen Li Hao tried to look normal and he wanted to continue with the tempo of the game with the first set of cards.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang frowned as he looked at his cards. Then, he looked at Lin Fan curiously. He didn't know what Lin Fan wanted to do but he still followed suit.</p><br/><p>Chen Li Hao laughed, \"We've all checked. Do you want to look at your cards?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. \"Why should I? Let's continue.\"</p><br/><p>\"Alright, that's formidable.\" Chen Li Hao was secretly dying of laughter.</p><br/><p>Then, Wang Ming Yang threw his cards on the table.</p><br/><p>Chen Li Hao licked his lips. \"Do you want to look at the cards? Do you want to gamble with something else?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. \"Alright, what do you want to gamble with?\"</p><br/><p>\"Just bet with all your money and I'll follow suit. Then, we'll open our cards,\" Chen Li Hao said excitedly.</p><br/><p>\"Alright,\" Lin Fan said without any hesitation.</p><br/><p>He Cheng Han asked, \"Master Lin, do you want to look at your cards first?\"</p><br/><p>His intention was to tell Lin Fan to look at his cards first. If they were too lousy, there was no point to continue gambling.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved his hand. \"It's okay. It's for the thrill, right?\"</p><br/><p>Chen Li Hao nodded. \"Yeah. It's for the thrill.\"</p><br/><p>Chen Li Hao had previously won a pretty large amount of money and he was full of confidence.</p><br/><p>\"Open your cards,\" Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>Chen Li Hao smiled and threw his three cards on the table. \"Sorry, my luck is too good today. It's a flush. Although it's a little low in value, it's still a flush.\"</p><br/><p>The crowd was stunned. How could that be?</p><br/><p>Zhu Zhu frowned. \"You're so scheming. Your cards are so good and you still dared to talk rubbish to Master Lin?\"</p><br/><p>\"What rubbish? I didn't force him to gamble. He was willing to gamble too,\" Chen Li Hao rebutted. Then, he laughed, \"Sorry, I won.\"</p><br/><p>When Chen Li Hao was taking Lin Fan's money, Lin Fan gently raised his hand. \"Don't be impatient. I haven't even looked at my cards.\"</p><br/><p>Chen Li Hao wasn't bothered by his words. \"Why should you even look at your cards? I have a straight flush. You can't possibly win it.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed. Then, he gently flipped the cards with a finger. The three cards turned over in an instant.</p><br/><p>\"Sorry, I think mine are better than yours.\"</p><br/><p>Chen Li Hao froze in shock. He was in disbelief.</p><br/><p>\"How could it be\u2026?\"</p><br/><p>Everyone was extremely shocked. How could it be?</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, that strengthened Wang Ming Yang's belief that Lin Fan could draw any card he wanted.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

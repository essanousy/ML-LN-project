I saw all the news about you on the Internet. Master Lin. What a befitting title.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tian Yu Hui smiled as well, \u201cA lot of my close female friends worship you. If they find out that we are neighbors, I\u2019m afraid they might come gathering at our doorstep.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled, \u201cBrother Li, Sister-in-law, don\u2019t laugh at me. I\u2019m just blindly mixing around in society. Oh right, are you guys doing alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re alright. We\u2019re doing great. How long are you prepared to stay this time?\u201d Li Feng acted like someone without any problems as he smiled and asked.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cI\u2019m just going to pay a visit to the elders and then I\u2019ll be going back to Shanghai in a few days.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Feng patted Lin Fan\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI hear Uncle Lin talk about you often. I never thought that you would be doing so well in Shanghai. Back then, you weren\u2019t doing well in your studies and we were all worried about you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha,\u201d Lin Fan laughed embarrassedly. In the past, his academic results were indeed bad. Others would often be worried about him. Thinking back now, it made him a little nostalgic.</p><br/><p>In that instant, the house was filled with laughter.</p><br/><p>It was nearing dinner time.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s eat.\u201d Aunty Li and Lin Fan\u2019s mother had been busy working in the kitchen. Then, they started bringing out the dishes.</p><br/><p>At the dining table.</p><br/><p>Uncle Li looked at his son in surprise. \u201cWhy are you drinking wine? You always wouldn\u2019t drink in the past.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Feng laughed, \u201cUncle Lin and his family are here. I\u2019m happy, so I\u2019ll drink a little.\u201d</p><br/><p>Uncle Li smiled, \u201cAlright but don\u2019t drink too much.\u201d</p><br/><p>Papa Lin and Uncle Li chatted. They were just talking about some daily gossips.</p><br/><p>Li Feng was very lively. He drank cup after cup of wine. As Tian Yu Hui saw her husband like this, her heart ached. However, the whole family was here now so she couldn\u2019t say anything.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan saw that Brother Li wasn\u2019t being his usual self and he felt that it was strange.</p><br/><p>Although he didn\u2019t have many chances to meet Brother Li, he had heard before that Brother Li couldn\u2019t drink much. But today, even if he was happy, he shouldn\u2019t be drinking so much.</p><br/><p>Could it be that there was something wrong?</p><br/><p>At this moment, Lin Fan took a look at Li Feng\u2019s face and started to read his fortune.</p><br/><p>Without looking, he wouldn\u2019t have known. But now that he had seen it, he didn\u2019t dare to believe it.</p><br/><p>It was the look of someone that was going to lose his job.</p><br/><p>*ring ring*</p><br/><p>Li Feng\u2019s phone rang. When he saw the notification, his expression turned a little ugly but then it quickly returned to normal. \u201cDad, Uncle, I\u2019m going to answer a call. You guys can eat first.\u201d</p><br/><p>After saying that, he went to the balcony with his phone. Then, he closed the balcony door.</p><br/><p>Uncle Li felt that there was something different about his son today. He asked Tian Yu Hui, \u201cDaughter-in-law, what\u2019s up with him today?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tian Yu Hui laughed and said, \u201cDad, it\u2019s nothing. Perhaps it\u2019s just something at work.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey.\u201d Uncle Li had drunk several cups and he was starting to talk more. \u201cThese Japanese companies really have a lot of problems. Even during the New Year, they\u2019re busy working.\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly.</p><br/><p>Shouts rang out from the balcony, \u201cScrew off!\u201d</p><br/><p>Uncle Li looked towards the balcony and said worriedly, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tian Yu Hui hastily tried to mediate the situation, \u201cIt\u2019s nothing. Dad, Uncle, please continue drinking. I\u2019ll go and take a look.\u201d Then, she got up and walked to the balcony.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the two silhouettes on the balcony and he started to ponder.</p><br/><p>Soon, the two of them returned.</p><br/><p>Li Feng maintained his cool. \u201cDad, Uncle, I received a strange phone call just now and I lost my temper a little. There\u2019s no issue now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Uncle Li said, \u201cThat\u2019s good. If there\u2019s something, you have to say it. Don\u2019t keep it in your heart.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Li Feng nodded. But how could he say it? It would only cause his parents to worry.</p><br/><p>However, he also knew that he couldn\u2019t hide it for long. He would just hide it for as long as he could.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan continued to say, \u201cBrother Li, I heard that there\u2019s a lot of pressure working in a Japanese company. Are you doing alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Feng laughed awkwardly, \u201cI\u2019m still alright.\u201d</p><br/><p>Uncle Li said, \u201cWhat do you mean \u2018still alright\u2019? You come home late at night every day. I think that company isn\u2019t reliable. It\u2019s shortening your life. Although the salary is high, I really wish you would change to a more relaxed job.</p><br/><p>Li Feng laughed and didn\u2019t say much. However, in his heart, he was thinking, \u201cI\u2019m already going to get discharged. There\u2019s no way I would be busy anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled, \u201cI think Uncle Li is right. What\u2019s so good about working for the Japanese? Brother Li, I know someone who runs a big company and our friendship is pretty tight. Shall I ask him? Then, you won\u2019t have to work for those people anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough the salary may not be that high, the potential for development is huge.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Feng smiled and said, \u201cNo need for the trouble, Lil\u2019 Fan.\u201d</p><br/><p>At the side, Uncle Li was disagreeing, \u201cWhat\u2019s this about \u2018trouble\u2019? My heart aches just looking at you work there. How can you work overtime so much? Lil\u2019 Fan, don\u2019t listen to him, listen to your Uncle. Ask your friend. If he\u2019s suitable, he\u2019ll go and work there.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll call him right now,\u201d said Lin Fan with a smile.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan couldn\u2019t bring up the matter of Brother Li losing his job. He wouldn\u2019t be giving Brother Li face if he did that. Of course, he had to make it \u2018accidental\u2019.</p><br/><p>Uncle Li said, \u201cLil\u2019 Fan, is it a good time to call during this time?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a problem. I can call anytime and it would be the same,\u201d Lin Fan said with a smile.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan didn\u2019t consider asking Wang Ming Yang. Although his business was large, it was mainly concentrated in Shanghai and Beijing. They didn\u2019t have a branch office in Zhongzhou yet. So, he could only give Lu Li a call and see what\u2019s the situation on his side.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Tian Yu Hui looked at Lin Fan in anticipation. If this really succeeded, her husband wouldn\u2019t have to worry so much.</p><br/><p>The call got through. Everyone in the house fell silent.</p><br/><p>\u201cChief Lu, happy New Year!\u201d said Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>\u201cHappy New Year, Master Lin!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan didn\u2019t speak any nonsense. He was going to get straight to the point. He asked, \u201cChief Lu, let me ask you something, do you have an office in Zhongzhou?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, the situation is as such. I have an exceptionally close neighbor, an older brother of mine. He has always been working in a Japanese company. The work stress there is too great and we\u2019re all worried about him. And don\u2019t you think it\u2019s not good to help those Japs earn money? That\u2019s why I want to recommend him to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry. This brother of mine has a Master\u2019s degree and he\u2019s very capable at work. He\u2019s very responsible too. He can be considered a necessary talent for any big company\u2026\u201d Before Lin Fan finished, Lu Li started laughing on the other end.</p><br/><p>Lu Li said, \u201cMaster Lin, you don\u2019t need to say all this. No problem. As long as you\u2019re the one saying it, how could I not believe you? This life of mine was saved by you. Why would you need to say all this? Alright, as long as he agrees, he can report to my company after the New Year break. According to what you\u2019ve said, we\u2019ll definitely give him a managerial appointment. For him to be an above average level worker in a Japanese company, he must have considerable ability. I shan\u2019t say too much.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cThen, how will his salary be calculated?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Li started laughing again. \u201cMaster Lin, aren\u2019t you just slapping my face with that question? If it\u2019s someone that you recommend, how could I pay him any less than the Japanese?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, then. I\u2019ll remember this favor. When I get back to Shanghai, I\u2019ll treat you to a meal.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t, don\u2019t. Let me treat you. I can\u2019t let you be the one to spend. If he\u2019s really a talent, then I\u2019d have to thank you later on.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, then I\u2019ll be hanging up now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan had just wanted to try his luck. He had not expected Lu Li to give him so much face.</p><br/><p>Good man. What a good man.</p><br/><p>Then, Lin Fan looked at everyone. \u201cAlright, you\u2019ll go to work after the New Year break. They\u2019ve promised to give you a managerial appointment immediately and they won\u2019t pay you any less than that Japanese company.\u201d</p><br/><p>Uncle Li looked at Lin Fan. \u201cLil\u2019 Fan, it\u2019s done just like that? Do we need to send him gifts or invite him to dinner?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved his hand. \u201cNo need for all that. It\u2019s enough that I\u2019ve spoken to him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mama Lin said, \u201cSon, is this reliable? We can\u2019t have problems coming up later on. What company is this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled, \u201cMom, don\u2019t worry. There definitely will not be problems. As for what company it is, I\u2019m not too sure but I do know the name of their headquarters. It\u2019s called Lu Corporation. You\u2019ve heard of it, haven\u2019t you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Li Feng, who hadn\u2019t been very hopeful at first, stood up immediately and looked at Lin Fan in disbelief. \u201cLil\u2019 Fan, did you just say that it\u2019s Lu Corporation?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Lin Fan nodded.</p><br/><p>Uncle Li was puzzled. \u201cSon, is this Lu Corporation very amazing?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Feng was so ecstatic that his heart was about to jump out of his throat. \u201cYeah, it\u2019s very amazing. It\u2019s a listed company. When I graduated, I tried to go for the interview but I didn\u2019t get selected.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tian Yu Hui asked, \u201cLil\u2019 Fan, can that person really make it happen?\u201d</p><br/><p>Fortune had come too quickly and they couldn\u2019t quite believe it. Their hearts were a little nervous.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cOf course he can. He\u2019s the current boss of Lu Corporation. How could he not be able to make it happen?\u201d</p><br/><p>When they heard this, Li Feng and Tian Yu Hui were stunned.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you, Lil\u2019 Fan.\u201d Li Feng looked at Lin Fan, filled with gratitude.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled and didn\u2019t say more.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Li Feng had a kind of feeling that Lil\u2019 Fan knew about his situation.</p></div>\n</div>"}

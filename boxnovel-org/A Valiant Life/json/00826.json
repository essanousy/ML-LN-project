When you reach back, you\u2019re going to get sorted out by your father,\u201d the younger people there were all gathered together and laughing. They felt that Jin Rui situation was really very tragic.</p><br/><p>At the same time, they were celebrating the fact that they were open and guileless. If Master Lin were to say anything bad about them, they were afraid of where they would end up.</p><br/><p>Jin Rui saw all these b*stards around him laughing at him. He felt so screwed.</p><br/><p>He could not go back to Beijing already.</p><br/><p>If he were to sneak back, the consequences would be far beyond anything he could imagine.</p><br/><p>From that moment on, Lin Fan had another enemy online.</p><br/><p>In the private room.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Chen Chang Sheng had heard about everybody\u2019s glorious accomplishments and just helplessly exclaimed. Then he looked at all of them and said, \u201cYou guys are really having it too good. I\u2019ve been going through very unfavorable times.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Chen, what\u2019s up with you? You are dealing with transportation logistics, how can you not be doing well? You better not come here and look for our tears. You have been earning a lot of money dealing with transportation logistics and we are all very envious. Now that you\u2019re actually here, sighing in despair, it\u2019s making us feel very embarrassed,\u201d He Cheng Han tainted him.</p><br/><p>In his eyes, this Elder Chen must definitely be putting on an act.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat was in the past. From last year till now, the work in my business has dramatically dropped. Right now, I also have a lot of things to tend to, giving me a huge headache,\u201d Chen Chang Sheng shook his head and said.</p><br/><p>Before coming to the salon, he had already managed to correct his mindset already. However, now that everyone here was talking about their accomplishments, ones that would make anyone envious, he could not help sighing.</p><br/><p>It was like he was thinking to himself.</p><br/><p><em>How could I be so unlucky?</em></p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang said while smoking, \u201cTell us what\u2019s wrong. We are all on the same side and will definitely be able to help. We started this salon so that we could help each other out in times of trouble.\u201d</p><br/><p>The surrounding people were all in agreement. They said, \u201cYes, Elder Wang is right. If you have any problems, you can just tell us. We can try and pitch some ideas.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you can\u2019t handle the monetary situation and need some investments, we can also consider.\u201d</p><br/><p>This was how their small group worked. If there was a point in time where anyone could not support themselves anymore, the people here would discuss it and see who was willing to invest some money. But of course, they would also evaluate the risks of it. If they felt it was too dangerous and they pulled out, no one would blame them for it.</p><br/><p>However, there was really a force present. A lot of people were still willing to give it a shot.</p><br/><p>Chen Chang Sheng opened his mouth and said, \u201cMy logistic routes have already reached South Korea, Japan, and a few others. Those are not the problem. The crucial part is that my logistics have hit an obstacle at Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang. The amount of business there has been dropping since last year.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happened? Has there been some trouble?\u201d Wang Ming Yang asked.</p><br/><p>When everyone heard about this, they felt like they had no idea what to do.</p><br/><p>They felt like they were powerless. Their power of influence could not reach such a far place.</p><br/><p>\u201cYea,\u201d Chen Chang Sheng nodded, \u201cIt was initially doing well. When I was in the Northeast, I met this man called Godfather Liu. When he met me, I didn\u2019t even recognize him. However, he just directly told me that he wanted to invest in my logistics company and he wanted 50% of the Northeast profits. I definitely had to disagree to that. My business has been going very smoothly so how could I choose to share it with a stranger? So, I rejected him on the spot. That was when my troubles started. My logistics business in that region started to come under attack. If it wasn\u2019t tires getting stolen, it would be goods getting stolen. There were times were my workers would get attacked out of the blue, with no idea who to find after that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was initially just listening on. He was not a businessman, so he could not understand the meaning of what they were saying.</p><br/><p>However, when he heard \u2018Godfather Liu\u2019, it peaked his interest.</p><br/><p><em>Wasn\u2019t this the b*stard that flamed me on the phone?</em></p><br/><p>When Lin Fan was thinking about these, He Cheng Han shouted in anger.</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t this b*stard committing blatant robbery? Everyone knows that your logistics company has a presence all over the nation. The Northeast and other places in the region are even more important. Some countries\u2019 irrigation channels run through Heilongjiang. With all these sorts of actions, he must be out for your life.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho is this Godfather Liu? Is he actually that fierce?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know him. He\u2019s a drug lord in the Northeast. He has a lot of power and is very bad.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe is the mafia boss of the region. He\u2019s not to be trifled with. Elder Chen, what are you planning to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>It was obvious that Chen Chang Sheng was not very accepting of this. He said, \u201cI have no idea. I definitely can\u2019t lose this route, if not I\u2019ll be taking a massive blow. The best thing to do now is to just let him invest. However, how can I agree to it now? He has established his own logistics to blatantly try and steal my customers. If I don\u2019t agree, then they will take revenge. I already have so few customers so I\u2019m very afraid.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t report this to the police?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Chang Sheng shook his head and said, \u201cHow can I report them? There\u2019s no use at all. That is their territory. I\u2019ve called the authorities there before but they didn\u2019t dare to touch them at all. Forget it, I\u2019ll just have to take a loss. I really wish I could whack his f*cking face.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, okay. Elder Chen, please control yourself. Regarding this situation, we\u2019ll rack our brains together to think of a solution. We definitely won\u2019t let Elder Chen be bullied by others,\u201d Wang Ming Yang said.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Lin Fan opened his mouth and said, \u201cI\u2019ve been in touch with the b*stard before.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang was stunned. He said, \u201cHow have you been in touch with him?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed and said, \u201cI\u2019ve called him before.\u201d</p><br/><p>He Cheng Han heard this and could not help patting Elder Chen on the back while laughing. He said, \u201cElder Chen, this time, your problem should be settled already. It looks like he\u2019s on pretty good terms with this Godfather Liu so as long as he puts in a word for you, there shouldn\u2019t be any problem that can\u2019t be solved.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jin Yun Min laughed and said, \u201cMaster Lin is really well connected. To know people in the Northeast is really amazing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone calm down. Let Master Lin make a call.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Chang Sheng eagerly looked at Lin Fan. He really wanted to quickly resolve this problem. Recently, it had been dragging on and it has been really hard for him to take.</p><br/><p>The phone call went through.</p><br/><p>The tone of the person on the other line was very serious as he said, \u201cWho is this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed and said, \u201cGodfather Liu, how are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang\u2019s face was full of smiles. His brother was really so amazing, knowing so many people. It seems like this situation was not too far from being resolved.</p><br/><p>Godfather Liu impatiently said, \u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan felt a little helpless. He never thought that Godfather Liu would not recognize him. It really hurt him inside. Then, he opened his mouth and spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cGodfather Liu, you really must have a short memory. I am the guy who f*cked your mother the last time.\u201d</p><br/><p>With this sentence, everyone on the scene was stunned. The confident smile on Wang Ming Yang\u2019s face had disappeared.</p><br/><p>Did they hear wrongly?</p><br/><p>What did his brother just said to him?</p><br/><p>Why did he say something so unexpected?</p><br/><p>He f*cked his mother?</p><br/><p>The manner of which Lin Fan spoke to him made everyone unable to make sense out of what they were hearing.</p><br/><p>Godfather Liu tone became even more gloomy as he said, \u201cWho in the world are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cI\u2019ve been very blunt with my words and you still can\u2019t make out who I am? I am Shanghai\u2019s Master Lin. Does that ring a bell? I was the guy who you wanted to give you face, but in the end, I did not give you any face which sent you into a huge rage.\u201d</p><br/><p>Godfather Liu, who was all the way in the Northeast, heard this and fiercely stood up.</p><br/><p>He never thought that this b*stard would actually dare to call him.</p><br/><p>Then, he pressed down on his throat and was completely filled with anger as he said, \u201cYou little b*stard. What exactly do you want?\u201d</p><br/><p>With regards to the Ying Jin situation, he had already admitted defeat and came to terms with it. However, it did not mean that he was afraid.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p></div>\n</div>"}

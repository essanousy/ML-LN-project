I just want to see how it\u2019s like.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou want to go?\u201d Lin Fan asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course! You\u2019re going to receive a prize. We can be your \u2018family\u2019 and cheer for you,\u201d Fraud Tian said.</p><br/><p>He really wanted to go. After all, he had never been there before.</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang stood there without saying anything, but his eyes betrayed him.</p><br/><p>He was definitely thinking of going too.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled and took a sip of tea. \u201cAlright, alright. I\u2019ll bring all of you along.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was indeed a joyous occasion that deserved to be celebrated together.</p><br/><p>They were not the only ones that were curious. Lin Fan was also curious about how it was going to turn out.</p><br/><p>The shop owners also came to congratulate Little Boss after reading the news.</p><br/><p>In the past, they were doing business on another Cloud Street. After they followed Little Boss here, the other Cloud Street was completely dead.</p><br/><p>They were shocked to see how lively this Cloud Street became after the arrival of Little Boss.</p><br/><p>\u201cCongrats, Little Boss!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Boss, it\u2019s going to be crazy. I heard you\u2019re going to a grand place to receive the prize.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, Cloud Street is famous because of Little Boss. Looks like it\u2019s going to become even better.\u201d</p><br/><p>The shop owners were really happy for him.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled, \u201cNo, it\u2019s nothing much. I have to stay calm.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone in Cloud Street was really united, and they would help one another whenever something went wrong. Now that something great like this happened, everyone was happy for him.</p><br/><p>Ding ding!</p><br/><p>After the shop owners left, a call came.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the caller notification and was not surprised at all.</p><br/><p>He picked up the phone.</p><br/><p>\u201cSon, your mom and I saw the news. When are you going to receive the prize? We want to go and watch you,\u201d his dad said excitedly.</p><br/><p>It was as if he never expected this at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cDad, I don\u2019t know yet. I have to wait for further instructions.\u201d</p><br/><p>Besides the notice, he did not know anything else.</p><br/><p>However, he knew that it was going to take place soon.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright! Once the details are out, you have to tell us! We want to go and watch you receive the award. We produced a genius like you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled, \u201cI know. Once I know the details, I will call you immediately.\u201d</p><br/><p>After chatting for some time, they ended the call.</p><br/><p>Then, another call came.</p><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue had been really busy with work, and she called him to ask if she could join them.</p><br/><p>It was a small request and obviously, Lin Fan agreed.</p><br/><p>A few days later.</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan arrived at Cloud Street, he received a call just before he opened his shop for business.</p><br/><p>Secretary Chen said, \u201cMaster Lin, it\u2019s confirmed. It will be held three days from now at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d Lin Fan was stunned. He felt that the place sounded really grand.</p><br/><p>Secretary Chen chuckled, \u201cYeah, I\u2019m just passing the message to you. I am invited because of you this time. There will be a flight prepared specially for you. Do you have friends and relatives coming along?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. \u201cYeah, yeah. I got quite a few of them coming with me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, just remember to register them when the time comes,\u201d Secretary Chen replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><br/><p>After hanging up, Fraud Tian ran towards Master Lin as he was secretly listening to their teleconversation.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, Boss, have a seat inside. I\u2019ll pour some tea for you.\u201d Suddenly, Fraud Tian\u2019s quality of service improved by a mile. It was something that he had never done before.</p><br/><p>However, it must be said that Lin Fan felt extremely good about himself.</p><br/><p>When Fraud Tian served the cup of tea, he even helped to cool the tea by blowing at the cup.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan gasped, \u201cHey, you, stop contaminating the tea with your saliva. How am I supposed to drink it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian looked at him innocently. \u201cI was just scared that you would burn your tongue, so I helped you by blowing on it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan took the cup of tea and sat there while Wu You Lan went to massage his shoulders. \u201cBrother Lin, does it feel good?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, it feels good.\u201d Lin Fan nodded.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan just smiled.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian went over to them and asked, \u201cHmm, so when is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s in three days\u2019 time. Please wear a formal attire. All of you are representing me. Please don\u2019t embarrass me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I have good taste. No problem!\u201d Fraud Tian replied confidently.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t wear those kinds of clothes. It\u2019s hideous.\u201d Lin Fan was scared that Fraud Tian would wear something inappropriate.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian replied, \u201cHey, I told you I won\u2019t do that. Why don\u2019t you believe me? Don\u2019t worry!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can only trust and pray\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\u201d Lin Fan did not know what else to say besides that.</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang had been waiting for a long time. When he heard what Lin Fan said, he immediately shouted to his viewers, \u201cBros, did you hear that? He will be receiving the award in three days\u2019 time. When the time comes, I will broadcast it for all of you.\u201d</p><br/><p>The netizens were ecstatic after hearing that.</p><br/><p>\u201c6666\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd I\u2019ll be waiting for Brother Yang\u2019s livestream.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, Master Lin is going to receive an award. I am so in awe of him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHahahaha, the day I\u2019ve been waiting for is finally going to arrive.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan wanted to call his parents about the award ceremony. However, he hesitated for a moment and decided to post it on Weibo first.</p><br/><p>When he posted it, the netizens went crazy and comments started to flood his post. They were looking forward to the event and they wondered how it was going to be like.</p><br/><p>When the post was published on Weibo, something happened unexpectedly.</p><br/><p>He Cheng Han, Wu Yun Gang, and some others started to call him.</p><br/><p>Besides requesting to be part of the friends and relatives group, they did not say anything else. They did not even discuss about any business related matters. They just wanted to tag along.</p><br/><p>That made him feel helpless, but he felt that there was nothing wrong with bringing them along. After all, the more the merrier.</p><br/><p>Then, he called Wang Ming Yang to see if he could organise it such that everyone could travel there through the proper channels.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang sounded really happy on the phone when he received the call. It was as if he had been waiting for Lin Fan to call him. It seemed like his brother did not forget about him at all.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

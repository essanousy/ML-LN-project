He wasn\u2019t even the one who had brought up the matter. Then, he looked at Vice-President Jiang. His meaning was clear: <em>You caused this, so you are going to answer for it.</em></p><br/><p>However, Vice-President Jiang\u2019s expression was very unpleasant right now. He was being forced to change his words.</p><br/><p>If he were to change his words, wouldn\u2019t that mean that anyone could come and cause a ruckus in the future? What would they do then?</p><br/><p>The Internet celebrity, Zhou Qing, had been secretly filming as he hid there and posting the videos on the Internet. He was astonished. He hadn\u2019t expected things to develop to such a stage. And judging by the situation, the leader was completely on Master Lin\u2019s side.</p><br/><p>He had to admit that there were benefits to being famous sometimes. It really made him feel helpless.</p><br/><p>When the netizens saw the video on Weibo, they were stunned as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn. This leader is completely on Master Lin\u2019s side. He\u2019s smart. He knows who the big shot is.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, I\u2019m dying of laughter. That President and Vice-President look as if they\u2019ve eaten a fly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin is too honest. I support him fully!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2018Although I\u2019m not being reasonable, I just won\u2019t give in. Are you going to change it or not?\u2019 That\u2019s basically what Master Lin is saying.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe association President is completely dumbfounded. He\u2019s probably wondering how there could be someone like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you see those people who were beaten down by Master Lin just now? Now, they only dare to talk and they don\u2019t even dare to go forward. They\u2019re scared stiff.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m dying of laughter. Not bad, boss. Keep taking videos to give us the latest updates.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Shanghai association.</p><br/><p>Jiang Fei and the rest had been looking at their phones all along. When they saw Master Lin talking to the Beijing association president, they were stunned. Their breathing started to quicken.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you think President can convince them?\u201d Jiang Fei asked Wang Yun Jie.</p><br/><p>Wang Yun Jie was dumbfounded as well. \u201cI think so.\u201d</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t be sure either but looking at the situation in the video, Master Lin seemed to have a slight upper hand. After all, the leader was on his side.</p><br/><p>However, it was hard to understand what Master Lin said.</p><br/><p>Even if what he said was true, he couldn\u2019t just say it so bluntly.</p><br/><p>At the scene.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was asking very bluntly. Although it was a little disrespectful, he was in a rush.</p><br/><p>He had promised Wang Ming Yang that he would rush back tonight. He definitely couldn\u2019t stand Wang Ming Yang up.</p><br/><p>The Beijing leader\u2019s brows furrowed. \u201cPresident Chen, what are you still thinking about. You definitely have to change your order. As the Shanghai association Vice-President and as a public figure, Master Lin has made tremendous contributions to the society. If even he thinks that there\u2019s a problem, then it\u2019s clear that you\u2019ve done badly on your part. Are you going to remain stubborn all the way? Even if Master Lin accepts it, I won\u2019t accept it.\u201d</p><br/><p>President Chen sighed as he felt helpless. He had no idea what this leader was trying to do. <em>This matter has nothing to do with you. Why do you have to stick your nose in it?</em></p><br/><p><em>It wouldn\u2019t be good to change the order. But if we don\u2019t change it, it seems that we definitely won\u2019t reach a pleasant conclusion.</em></p><br/><p>\u201cVice-President Jiang, what exactly is going on?\u201d asked President Chen.</p><br/><p>Vice-President Jiang\u2019s expression was quite unpleasant. \u201cPresident, actually, I\u2019ve discussed this with many others. President Niu is getting old. We want to transfer him over to let him enjoy some comfort. When the time comes, he\u2019ll be able to retire.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMoreover, the Shanghai association is gradually getting more popular. With President Niu\u2019s energy and stamina, he won\u2019t be able to hold up. That\u2019s why, after much consideration, we passed down this order.\u201d</p><br/><p>President Chen had wanted to say something but before he could, Lin Fan interrupted.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou must be joking. What makes you think he can\u2019t hold up? Are you very familiar with President Niu? I think that you guys have seen that the Shanghai association is doing well, so you want to send someone over to steal some of our benefits,\u201d Lin Fan spoke bluntly. He wasn\u2019t giving them any face at all. \u201cIn the past, before the Shanghai association rose up, why didn\u2019t you send anyone over?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cVice-President Lin, those are malicious words.\u201d When Vice-President Jiang heard those words, his face turned red. It was as if his thoughts had been exposed.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled. \u201cMalicious words? Don\u2019t you have an idea of what\u2019s going on? You\u2019re still acting dumb. I don\u2019t want to speak nonsense with you anymore. Just answer me. Are you going to change the order or not?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Vice-President Jiang looked at Lin Fan with panic in his heart. This guy was simply a hooligan. He was completely unreasonable and he loved spitting malicious words.</p><br/><p>But looking at Lin Fan\u2019s expression, it was as if he wouldn\u2019t let this matter end if Vice-President Jiang didn\u2019t change the order.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, could we discuss this? Right now, we can\u2019t give you an answer.\u201d President Chen didn\u2019t want to be tangled in this any further.</p><br/><p>Right now, there were so many people around and they definitely wouldn\u2019t be able to resolve it. He wanted to delay this and resolve it slowly.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved his hand immediately. \u201cDon\u2019t talk to me about that. I took a plane here today just for this. Quickly. Are you going to change it or not? You are really despicable. Once there are some results, you\u2019re all desperate to come over to the Shanghai association. Why don\u2019t you just manage your Beijing association properly instead of thinking about all this? Other people may be able to accept it but I won\u2019t. I\u2019m giving you one last minute.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to say it bluntly. This time, I came here prepared to spend some time in jail. If you don\u2019t give me an answer in one minute, I\u2019m going to crush you.\u201d</p><br/><p>When these words were said, everyone was stunned.</p><br/><p><em>Master Lin is too f*cking ferocious, isn\u2019t he? </em>He wants <em>to crush everyone?</em></p><br/><p>\u201cYou dare?\u201d Vice-President Jiang erupted upon hearing that. \u201cLin, don\u2019t you have any self-control? This is Beijing. This is the Beijing association. It\u2019s not a place where you can behave atrociously. I\u2019ll say this. I\u2019m standing in front of you right now. Just try and do something to me if you dare.\u201d</p><br/><p>*Bam!*</p><br/><p>Those last words had only just been said.</p><br/><p>Vice-President Jiang clutched his arm as he lay on the ground, wailing loudly.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt hurts\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, everyone was stunned. They hadn\u2019t expected Master Lin to really dare to make a move.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan glanced at Vice-President Jiang. \u201cI\u2019ve seen some lowly people but I\u2019ve never seen someone as lowly as you. You actually asked me to hit you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, he looked at his phone.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are forty more seconds. Hurry up. Stop wasting time. If any of you here want to stand on the association\u2019s side, I won\u2019t object. Just don\u2019t blame me for not warning you when I start making my move later.\u201d</p><br/><p>Those association members who had been sitting there all stood up when they heard this and they stood back.</p><br/><p>In an instant, they expressed their intentions.</p><br/><p>They were remaining neutral.</p><br/><p>Although they were association members, Master Lin was an association member as well. This was an internal conflict.</p><br/><p>As peaceful members, they definitely wouldn\u2019t get involved in this.</p><br/><p>They would just let the big shots settle this themselves.</p></div>\n</div>"}

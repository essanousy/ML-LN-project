They could discuss whatever they wanted on the Internet. Lin Fan hadn\u2019t taken any backdoors. For Elder Dog to receive the award, it was because of his own deeds that had touched others.</p><br/><p>Amidst all this controversy, the day of the award ceremony arrived.</p><br/><p>At home.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was dressed formally. This time, although he wasn\u2019t going to be receiving the award, he still had to dress formally. Then, he looked towards the sofa.</p><br/><p>\u201cDoggy, how many times have I told you to hurry up and wash yourself up? Do you even want to go?\u201d Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>\u201cWoof woof!\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Dog jumped off the sofa and scurried into the toilet. He cleverly turned on the tap and waited for the water to fill up the sink before lying inside. He added some shower gel to clean himself up. Then, he stood in the bathroom and shook his whole body, shaking himself dry.</p><br/><p>The current Elder Dog was already unlike a normal mutt. He was a spirit dog and he possessed certain powers.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the time. It was about time. He gestured with his hand and said, \u201cDoggy, let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shanghai, award ceremony!</p><br/><p>The decorations at the venue was similar to a musical award ceremony. There were red carpets and all. Among the Touching China\u2019s Top Ten People, there were some who had been chosen because they had given up their lives for a certain cause. In such a solemn event, perhaps it didn\u2019t feel appropriate for them to be such fancy decorations.</p><br/><p>However, these decorations were a sign of respect for the ten of them. They deserved such a grand treatment.</p><br/><p>The reporters were all waiting.</p><br/><p>Some of the people who had been chosen had come personally. Facing the reporters\u2019 interview, they all smiled. To be able to receive such an honor made them very happy.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, some of them were unable to come as they had already passed away. Instead, their family members came. They had experienced grief in seeing their loved ones pass. Now that they saw the society\u2019s respect for their loved ones, they felt proud of their loved ones\u2019 sacrifices.</p><br/><p>Soon, Lin Fan had driven Elder Dog to the venue. Then, he stopped his car by the sidewalk to let Elder Dog and himself enter the venue.</p><br/><p>When the reporters who had just finished their interview saw him, their eyes lit up and they scurried over.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The greatest controversy regarding this year\u2019s awards was that a dog had been chosen. This was unacceptable to many people, because to them, it was too unreal. Some people who were even more agitated felt that it was blaspheme.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan saw that the number of reporters was increasing. He carried Elder Dog in his embrace and waved at the reporters.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t interview me today. I\u2019m not receiving the award today. It\u2019s him,\u201d said Lin Fan as he pointed at Elder Dog. \u201cIf you want to interview someone, interview him.\u201d</p><br/><p>These words made the reporters feel very helpless. This dog couldn\u2019t even speak. How could they interview him?</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, do you have anything to say about your dog receiving the award?\u201d A reporter had broken through the large crowd and placed his microphone in front of Lin Fan. Then, he continued, \u201cRight now, the whole country\u2019s citizens are disputing over this matter. Do you think this is a good or bad thing?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s not good for me to talk about this. However, you guys will know when the award ceremony starts, won\u2019t you?\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporters wouldn\u2019t let him off just like that. \u201cMaster Lin, some people on the Internet have said that you manipulated the results so that your pet would get the award.\u201d</p><br/><p>Regarding this issue, Lin Fan felt that he had to say something about it. They were slandering him.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy dear reporter, do you think that\u2019s possible? I don\u2019t have authority, nor do I have money. If I can manipulate the award results, wouldn\u2019t that mean that anyone can do that? I\u2019m just a commoner,\u201d said Lin Fan humbly.</p><br/><p>But even though he said this, whether other people would believe it was a separate matter.</p><br/><p>However, when he said these words, even he didn\u2019t quite believe them.</p><br/><p>Although he didn\u2019t have much authority or money, he had power!</p><br/><p>Such a reply seemed not to have satisfied the reporters. Just as they wanted to press him for more answer, Lin Fan quickened his footsteps and waved at the reporters. \u201cMy reporter brothers, I shan\u2019t chat with you for now. It\u2019s about time to hurry inside. Otherwise, I\u2019ll be late.\u201d</p><br/><p>This was his first time being at such an award ceremony and he was a little nervous.</p><br/><p>This was an event specially organized by the country. It was a meaningful event. Hence, it was better to treat it with more importance.</p><br/><p>When he reached the inside, he followed the invitation letter to go to the backstage. The environment backstage was very good. Each person had their own private room. Also, there was a TV screen in each room.</p><br/><p>The leader of this award ceremony was here. He was under a lot of stress this time.</p><br/><p>After all, they had chosen a dog as an award recipient. This was unprecedented. However, he hadn\u2019t regretted it even for a moment.</p><br/><p>Before he had understood the situation, even he wouldn\u2019t have expected such a situation. But when he personally found out what this dog had done, he felt that he would be wronging this dog if he didn\u2019t give the award to it.</p><br/><p>Minutes and seconds passed.</p><br/><p>In the homes of thousands of families.</p><br/><p>Many people had turned on their televisions and were watching television programmes.</p><br/><p>\u201cDad, change the channel. I heard that Touching China\u2019s Top Ten People Award Ceremony is starting.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy do you want to watch that today? In the past, you didn\u2019t like watching this kind of shows.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard that a dog has been chosen as an award recipient. I\u2019m genuinely curious, so I want to see how this programme crew explains this decision.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? A dog has been chosen as one of Touching China\u2019s Top Ten People? Son, are you lying to me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m really not. Dad, change the channel.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><br/><p>He pressed the remote controller to change the channel. The show hadn\u2019t started yet but the prelude was already playing.</p><br/><p>In a certain villa.</p><br/><p>\u201cWife, let\u2019s not watch this Korean drama show for today. Let\u2019s watch Channel 1.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so good to watch about those national news?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, today is Touching China\u2019s Top Ten People Award Ceremony. I heard that a dog has been chosen, so I want to see what\u2019s going on.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSomething like that happened? Let\u2019s see then.\u201d</p><br/><p>This kind of situation was happening in many homes across the country. The controversy on the Internet had been great recently. Many people felt that this kind of thing was unrealistic. Some people even felt uncomfortable when they saw the news.</p><br/><p>The programme crew was playing around with such a sacred and solemn award ceremony. Who would be able to stand such a thing?</p><br/><p>To them, if even a dog could receive the award, this programme would be rubbish. Moreover, they felt that it was a humiliation to the other award recipients.</p><br/><p>How would those people who had to share the stage with a dog feel?</p><br/><p>Of course, not everyone thought this way about the matter. Those fans who were familiar with Elder Dog were sitting in front of their televisions, silently waiting.</p></div>\n</div>"}

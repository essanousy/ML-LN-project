Let\u2019s speed up.\u201d Xu Zi Le started getting busy. Then, she nudged Wu Huan Yue. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang opened the door with a face full of smiles. \u201cAh, you\u2019re finally here. I nearly died waiting for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan glanced at him and said, \u201cYou nearly died waiting? I was so busy that I nearly died.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow does it feel?\u201d Wang Ming Yang smiled. He was fully convinced. His brother had gone from Shanghai to Beijing to suppress the opposition, then come back in a hurry. Flying back and forth like that was pretty awesome.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan rolled his eyes. \u201cWhat do you think? If I make you fly back and forth, how would you feel? I spent most of today on a plane. Enough talk. Let me go in for a rest. I\u2019m dying of fatigue.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease, please go in, big shot. It\u2019s not easy to have a big shot come and visit. If I didn\u2019t arrange this in advance, I wouldn\u2019t have been able to meet you,\u201d said Wang Ming Yang with a laugh as he quickly took a pair of slippers for Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan put on the slippers, then looked left and right. \u201cYou really know how to enjoy life. What a big house.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang said helplessly, \u201cBrother, I don\u2019t have much of anything. All I have are houses. I\u2019ve told you that I wanted to prepare a luxurious one for you but you still insist on a rental apartment. Now you\u2019re saying that I know how to enjoy life. Sometimes, I really want to give you a beating.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan went into a fighting stance. \u201cCome. I\u2019ll give you the chance right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t. I was joking. I don\u2019t want to go to the hospital. Wang Ming Yang waved his hand quickly. His brother\u2019s power was terrifying. If he were to fight against his brother, he would definitely end up crippled.</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe,\u201d Lin Fan started laughing. Then, he sniffed the air. \u201cIt\u2019s fragrant. I\u2019ll go and see what there is to eat.\u201d</p><br/><p>But very soon, a voice came from the kitchen.</p><br/><p>Xu Zi Le pushed Lin Fan out of the kitchen. \u201cBrother Lin, don\u2019t come in. Only Huan Yue and I should be inside. Go and have a chat with Ming Yang. It will be ready soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan sighed, then shrugged. \u201cThey\u2019re not letting me in. But this is pretty good too. I\u2019ll have a good taste of the two celebrities\u2019 culinary skills today.\u201d</p><br/><p>On the sofa, Wang Ming Yang gestured with his hand. \u201cCome here. Have some tea. Let\u2019s have a chat.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two of them sat there, drinking tea.</p><br/><p>\u201cMing Yang, how is the laboratory going?\u201d Lin Fan was rather concerned about this matter. It wasn\u2019t just a task. It was, more importantly, a way to help the children who had become disabled.</p><br/><p>There were many of the welfare institute\u2019s children who were still in wheelchairs. And although some of them didn\u2019t need wheelchairs, they had missing arms. They weren\u2019t the same as other people.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang nodded. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry when I\u2019m taking care of it. As long as it\u2019s related to you, I\u2019ll put aside everything else. Since it\u2019s a laboratory, it has to have the highest quality. Everything must meet the standards. But let me ask you something. Do you really have confidence in this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d Lin Fan nodded with a smile. \u201cOf course I have confidence. In other words, I\u2019ve already finished researching. I\u2019m just waiting for the lab to be done.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut this time, let me tell you the truth. I\u2019m handing this project to you but I\u2019m also going to collaborate with the government at the same time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang was taken aback. \u201cBrother, why do you want to collaborate with the government? If that\u2019s true, it would change things greatly. You could become one of the wealthiest people alive if you don\u2019t collaborate with the government.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled as he waved his hand. \u201cMing Yang, we\u2019ve known each other for so long but you still think that I\u2019m someone who values money? If I value money that much, do you think I would still be running my shop at Cloud Street? Do you think my net worth would still be as it is now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true,\u201d Wang Ming Yang said and nodded. He knew that his brother didn\u2019t think much of wealth. Otherwise, with his abilities, he might have become the wealthiest person in the country by now.</p><br/><p>Leukemia, anorexia, etc. If other people had discovered those prescriptions, they would probably use any one of them to become the wealthiest in the country.</p><br/><p>These weren\u2019t just blind words. There were so many people in the world and there were so many sufferers. If one seized control over one of these prescriptions and distributed it in small doses, his or her wealth would inflate exponentially.</p><br/><p>If he or she were to establish a listed company, its stock value would definitely soar.</p><br/><p>Hence, if his brother were to really value money, he would be able to earn money at such a speed that Wang Ming Yang wouldn\u2019t even be able to catch up.</p><br/><p>Moreover, Wang Ming Yang didn\u2019t believe that his brother was only capable of conquering these few diseases.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already thought it through. Right now, your property business isn\u2019t going too well, is it? Start this on the side and collaborate with the government. Let the government promote it in full force to help those less-fortunate people be changed back to normal.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan wouldn\u2019t forget about Ming Yang. Since there was something like this, he had to let Ming Yang have some benefits.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang nodded. \u201cAlright, I\u2019ll listen to you. I\u2019ll do whatever you say. Anyway, since I\u2019ve gotten to know you, I haven\u2019t had to think too much.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood brother.\u201d Lin Fan patted Wang Ming Yang\u2019s shoulder. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. With me around, I guarantee that no one will bully you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCheh. With my current status, who would dare to bully me?\u201d Wang Ming Yang would not accept those words.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed. \u201cHave you forgotten what happened in Beijing? That person who got forced to drink like an idiot, wasn\u2019t that you?\u201d</p><br/><p>When Wang Ming Yang heard that, he was speechless for a moment. \u201cBrother, could you not bring up past incidents? I was young and unknowledgeable. I wouldn\u2019t do that now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWow, you were young and unknowledgeable? It was just last year. You\u2019ve matured so much already?\u201d Lin Fan wasn\u2019t giving him face at all. But thinking back, it was really quite funny. Wang Ming Yang had gotten so drunk and he had puked very disgustingly. Then, Lin Fan thought of something and immediately took out his phone.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome. I\u2019ll show you something good.\u201d Lin Fan sneakily took out his phone, then placed it in front of Wang Ming Yang\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck. Brother, hurry up and delete it.\u201d Wang Ming Yang saw the photo on the phone and his expression changed drastically. <em>How could that person in these photos be me?</em></p><br/><p>He was lying there motionlessly with puke all over his body.</p><br/><p>Another photo showed him on the hotel bed, naked. Those were dark times.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, I won\u2019t delete it. This is wealth. Next time, if I lack money, I\u2019ll sell these photos to the reporters. It would earn me some money,\u201d Lin Fan laughed as he hid his phone.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Wang Ming Yang had pounced on Lin Fan. His hands were going everywhere as he tried to find the phone on Lin Fan\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck. Ming Yang, don\u2019t touch me like that\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGive it to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m begging you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s useless to beg. You were the one who did it.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, Xu Zi Le and Wu Huan Yue came out from the kitchen. When they saw this scene, they were stunned.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you two doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>Two grown men were tangled up together. This scene was rather blinding.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan quickly shoved Wang Ming Yang away. \u201cStop trying to snatch it. You won\u2019t be able to get it. Hurry up and eat. If you are capable enough, get me drunk and this phone will be yours.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll definitely make you drunk tonight.\u201d Wang Ming Yang took a deep breath as he prepared to go all out.</p></div>\n</div>"}

Master Lin is really vicious. This is simply offending the Godfather!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha! I\u2019m dying of laughter. Ying Jin is suffering the consequences of her own actions, and she\u2019s still trying to fake it!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho\u2019s this Godfather Liu? He\u2019s so awesome that he can actually pick up Ying Jin. He\u2019s the model for all guys.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin is too amusing. If it were me, I\u2019d be infuriated to death! I\u2019m begging to see Godfather Liu\u2019s psychological shadow.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m an advanced mathematician. By my calculations, Godfather Liu\u2019s psychological shadow takes up about 99%. He\u2019s going to blow at any moment.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYing Jin does in fact have a dark side.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis Godfather Liu is really arrogant. He actually dared to say that he can run wild in the Northeast. Which government would ever allow that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen people entrap their fathers, mothers and even sons, but I\u2019ve never seen anyone entrap themselves.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe got tricked by Master Lin. Never ever threaten Master Lin, or else, you\u2019d never know what the outcome might be.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The recording came out and the netizens exclaimed crazily.</p><br/><p>For the netizens in the Northeast, they were incomparably excited. They immediately left a message on Lin Fan\u2019s Weibo.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, come and save us! We have already made arrangements for your arrival.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCome and save your righteous fans! We want to end up like Qingzhou.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know this Godfather Liu. He\u2019s a very powerful person here. He has a very deep history, and nobody dares to provoke him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs Master Lin looking to die? He even dares to provoke such a powerful boss like Godfather Liu.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Ying Jin was thoroughly stupefied. She didn\u2019t expect the situation to turn out like this. This b*stard actually dared to upload the recording. He wasn\u2019t giving her a way out at all!</p><br/><p>Ever since she made her debut, although the smaller news companies made reports on her background, they were mostly false and they didn\u2019t say much as well. But now, everything was exposed.</p><br/><p>As a public figure, she unexpectedly has such a reputation. It was completely disreputable. She was afraid that she wasn\u2019t too far from being shut out.</p><br/><p>Previously, no one discovered anything, and hence nobody could do anything.</p><br/><p>However, right now, everything was revealed. The evidence was conclusive. Even if she did want to save herself, she had the mind to do so but lacked the strength. They also couldn\u2019t do anything to the citizens.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Ying Jin still didn\u2019t want to give up. She gave a call to Godfather Liu.</p><br/><p>\u201cSave me, you really have to save me. Or else, I\u2019ll be finished.\u201d Ying Jin began crying bitterly as if she no longer cared about her image. She couldn\u2019t be finished like this, or else she would be useless.</p><br/><p>At the same time, she couldn\u2019t bear to part with everything she had in the circle now. She could get whatever she wanted. How could it all be gone just like this?</p><br/><p>Godfather Liu didn\u2019t say anything. This was because he had also just been warned. He didn\u2019t expect that that b*stard would actually put out the recording of their conversation so fearlessly.</p><br/><p>In the Northeast, he wasn\u2019t the only one in charge. With the problem that just occurred, it has also affected the interests of many others. Where would he find the mood to care about whether or not Ying Jin could stay in the music industry.</p><br/><p>Finally, Ying Jin cut off the call. She had already got the answer. Godfather Liu couldn\u2019t do anything.</p><br/><p>At this moment, her biggest supporter came crashing down. He couldn\u2019t help her, so who else could she find for help?</p><br/><p>At this moment, Ying Jin gave Lin Fan a call. This was her last straw of hope.</p><br/><p>The call got through.</p><br/><p>Ying Jin said, \u201cMaster Lin, I beg you. Isn\u2019t it enough that I\u2019ve admitted my faults? Can you please delete the recording, I can\u2019t lose everything that I have.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cTeacher Ying, I don\u2019t even know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI beg you. I\u2019ll do whatever you want. I beg you to please delete that recording. Regarding this matter, I\u2019m at fault. Is that enough?\u201d Ying Jin was resentful, but right now, all she could do was bow down, or else no one would be able to help her.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cI can\u2019t delete the recording. I\u2019ve been threatened by people from the secret societies. I have to expose them. It\u2019s a pity. I didn\u2019t expect that their head would be Teacher Ying.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ying Jin just couldn\u2019t take it anymore. She shouted in rage, \u201cMister Lin! Are you really in a hurry to shut me off? Even if I don\u2019t have anything left, I\u2019m still going to give you a difficult time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan answered calmly, \u201cOkay. I\u2019ll be waiting for you on Cloud Street.\u201d</p><br/><p>After which, he cut the call.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll f*ck your mum!\u201d Ying Jin scolded madly.</p><br/><p>Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was laughing. He was elated. When facing such wicked people, he\u2019d definitely not back down, for he is now the much loved Master Lin.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian was reading Weibo with great interest, thereafter, he turned his head, \u201cAren\u2019t you being a little too harsh. This matter has blown up. Aren\u2019t you scared of being beaten up.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed out loud, \u201cWith my capabilities, I\u2019ll respect anyone who can beat me to death.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAwesome!\u201d Fraud Tian gave him a thumbs up. He envied his attitude of having no self-doubt. If he had this mentality in the past, he wouldn\u2019t have set up a stall on the overhead bridge to tell the fortune of others.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan asked worriedly, \u201cBrother Lin, would everything be okay? I know this Godfather Liu. He came to find my father for this fortune to be told once. He\u2019s very powerful in the Northeast.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cYou can rest easy. Nothing will happen.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang had been live-streaming the entire conversation, \u201cBrothers! Did you hear that? Our Lin Fan is just too strong. No matter how powerful the other party is, he has no fear!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAwesome! My Master Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin is my idol. I just wish that Master Lin would speak two sentences to us.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang tilted the phone towards Lin Fan, \u201cBrother Lin, speak two sentences to everyone!\u201d</p><br/><p>Since he had always been live-streaming inside of Lin Fan\u2019s shop, Zhao Zhong Yang has become the live-streaming specialist. This was all because of Lin Fan\u2019s existence. Sometimes he would live-stream Elder Dog\u2019s movements, which attracted even more fans.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan took the phone, and facing the camera, he said, \u201cDear brothers! I am Master Lin! Do you guys miss me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe miss you! We miss you to death!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI think of Master Lin whenever I sleep. When I wake up, my underwear would be wet.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSeeing that Master Lin has been up to something, I cannot help but worry.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed, \u201cRight now, the situation on the internet isn\u2019t stable. However, it doesn\u2019t matter to me. I\u2019ve been threatened by others, so how can I possibly endure it? Don\u2019t you guys agree with me? We all live under the same flag. There are plenty of righteous officials facing off with these evil people. My aim is for you guys to have dry pants when you take it off.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAmazing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cListening to Master Lin\u2019s one sentence saves ten years of reading.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIndeed! We all live under the same flag. For the future of our successors, how can we be threatened by these clowns?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFor justice, I will stand on the same side as Master Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBrothers, let us band together to fight these evil people!\u201d</p><br/><p>After messing around with the netizens in the live-streaming chat room, he decided to check up on the situation by reading the Internet.</p><br/><p>However, at this moment, something unexpected happened.</p><br/><p>Zhao Li actually backstabbed Ying Jin. It seemed that she feared that there was a turn of events, and wanted to find a way out quickly.</p><br/><p>This made Ying Jin have thoughts of killing herself.</p><br/><p>Weibo.</p><br/><p>Zhao Li: \u201cI have let down everyone. Regarding the dirty secrets two years ago, I admit that I have taken part in them. However, at that time, I really didn\u2019t want to do it. However, Ying Jin received the money, and if I didn\u2019t get the money as well, the outcome wouldn\u2019t be something I could endure. Right now, I\u2019m extremely regretful. I have donated this sum of money to Project Hope. I have also donated the contract fee of Strongest Heavenly Voice. This is all to make up for my mistakes. I hope that everyone would be able to give me another chance. Thank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>When this Weibo was sent out, it attracted a lot of attention.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was flabbergasted when she saw this new.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe really f*cking cut the ties, all just to save herself.\u201d</p><br/><p>However, even if it was like this, the netizens also forgave her.</p></div>\n</div>"}

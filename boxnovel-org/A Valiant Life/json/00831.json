Then, he immediately called him back.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, you really went there?\u201d Wang Ming Yang shouted when the phone call got through.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled, \u201cAren\u2019t you talking rubbish? I\u2019m already here. I just left the plane.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang hesitated for a moment, \u201cBro, take it easy. Don\u2019t cause any trouble.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. Don\u2019t you trust me? I\u2019ll hang up now. I\u2019m going to get busy.\u201d</p><br/><p>After hanging up.</p><br/><p>He felt that Wang Ming Yang shouldn\u2019t have been worried about his safety. He should have been worried about the tragic fate of Godfather Liu.</p><br/><p>After knowing him for so long, why didn\u2019t he understand him at all?</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t understand it.</p><br/><p>Outside the airport.</p><br/><p>A black luxurious sedan was parked there and a man with short hair told his subordinates.</p><br/><p>\u201cAll of you, look at this picture. As long as someone that looks like him exits the airport, inform me immediately. Do not lose him. This is about Godfather Liu. If something were to go wrong, you should know the consequences.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, we know that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t expect Master Lin to have the guts to come to the Northeast. Sigh, I\u2019m also his hardcore fan. It\u2019s going to be a difficult task.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA difficult task? Who\u2019s the one that\u2019s paying you? Just do it for your employer. What are you talking about?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d</p><br/><p>Godfather Liu was furious. This fella really came to the Northeast. He probably didn\u2019t know how powerful he was. Although he couldn\u2019t do anything serious to him, he was still capable of teaching him a lesson.</p><br/><p>In the airport.</p><br/><p>After Lin Fan called the others, he went to fetch Elder Dog. He brought Elder Dog to stay in a small cage and it was pathetic. However, he didn\u2019t have a choice. If not, he wouldn\u2019t have been able to come here.</p><br/><p>This time, he was in the Northeast to speak to Godfather Liu. However, he actually wanted to tour the place and relax.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was looking at his phone with his head lowered as he scrolled through Weibo.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, I\u2019m at the airport already. Where are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m at the airport too. Please say something so we can fetch you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, where\u2019s Master Lin? I\u2019ve been trying to look for him with my friends.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn.\u201d Lin Fan quickly looked around him after reading those comments. He realized that there were several townsfolk that were secretly following him.</p><br/><p>Although he wasn\u2019t a celebrity, he was considered to be a public figure. If people were to know that he was there, it would definitely create a big uproar. He wanted to stay low-key about it.</p><br/><p>He picked Elder Dog up and left the place.</p><br/><p>When Elder Dog was released from the cage, he could tell that Elder Dog was looking at him in rage. It was as if he was blaming him for locking himself up in a cage instead of letting him board the plane normally.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan couldn\u2019t have said anything to that. He just covered himself up and started to leave the airport.</p><br/><p>Godfather Liu had been waiting for the news from his subordinates. However, it wasn\u2019t early anymore. He was feeling a little frustrated. He immediately called them.</p><br/><p>\u201cHas he arrived?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGodfather Liu, I haven\u2019t seen him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t seen him? Look at the time. What time is it? Why haven\u2019t you found him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGodfather Liu, we\u2019ve been looking around closely. We really haven\u2019t found him. Did he lie to us about coming here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGet the f*ck back. You are useless. You can\u2019t even find a person.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, okay.\u201d The subordinates trembled in fear and their foreheads were filled with sweat. They were really scared of Godfather Liu.</p><br/><p>After hanging up, Godfather Liu immediately picked up a call.</p><br/><p>\u201cGodfather Liu, did you find that fella?\u201d The person that called was Ying Jin. After being banished, all she could have done was to tour the world and relax. However, she couldn\u2019t let go of the grudge and rage.</p><br/><p>If not for this fella, she wouldn\u2019t have been in trouble.</p><br/><p>After hearing that the fella was coming to the Northeast, she was really happy about it. She wanted to take revenge and let this fella know that she wasn\u2019t a pushover.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy Little Jin, he isn\u2019t here yet,\u201d Godfather Liu said gently.</p><br/><p>If Lin Fan were to hear that, he would probably have vomited his breakfast. \u2018Little Jin\u2019 was absolutely disgusting. She was already so old.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. If he were to be here, I will definitely find him for you and teach him a good lesson,\u201d Godfather Liu said.</p><br/><p>\u201cI love you the most.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>After hanging up, Godfather Liu looked stern again.</p><br/><p>He sent a lot of people to look for him and they actually couldn\u2019t find him. He wondered what they were doing.</p><br/><p>Then, he dialed a number.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan had already left the airport. He took a cab to downtown.</p><br/><p>He was curious as it was the first time he visited the place.</p><br/><p>Ding ding!</p><br/><p>Then, his phone rang.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan saw the incoming call and smiled as he picked up, \u201cHi, Godfather Liu.\u201d</p><br/><p>Godfather Liu said, \u201cWhere are you? Didn\u2019t you say that you\u2019re coming to the Northeast? I asked my subordinates to look for you. Why didn\u2019t they see you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was stunned. Then, he said ecstatically, \u201cGodfather Liu, you\u2019re too polite. You actually sent people to fetch me. However, I didn\u2019t see your subordinates at the airport. I\u2019m already in downtown.\u201d</p><br/><p>Godfather Liu said, \u201cWhere are you now? I\u2019ll get someone to look for you. How\u2019s that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cThen I shall trouble you. I am at XX Road. Godfather Liu, I\u2019m waiting for you. Come here quickly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, wait for me. I\u2019ll be quick,\u201d Godfather Liu sneered.</p><br/><p>After hanging up, Godfather Liu got his subordinates to fetch him.</p><br/><p>After half an hour.</p><br/><p>Godfather Liu called him again, \u201cWhere are you? My subordinates have been waiting for a long time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said apologetically, \u201cGodfather Liu, I\u2019m sorry. I went to look for a toilet. However, I accidentally took the train. I don\u2019t know where I am now. Should I describe the surrounding buildings for you to pick me up?\u201d</p><br/><p>Godfather Liu had run out of patience, \u201cF*cking idiot. Since you\u2019re already in the Northeast, don\u2019t think about running away. Nobody can hide from me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck you mom. I asked you to come and fetch me. Why are you scolding me for?\u201d Lin Fan scolded.</p><br/><p>Godfather Liu replied, \u201cJust you wait.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cWait for your sister? Just wait for me. After I tour this place, I\u2019ll look for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>*clatter!*</p><br/><p>He hung up.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan didn\u2019t care about him at all. This fella actually disrespected him. He was literally asking for it.</p><br/><p>After the Ma Qingzhou incident, he had decided to not bully them with his own abilities.</p><br/><p>He had to destroy them and break them down before he exposed their crimes.</p><br/><p>As the righteous Master Lin, he didn\u2019t have to use those despicable means.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, it wouldn\u2019t have been fun if he were to resolve it so quickly.</p><br/><p>He spent a lot of money to come to the Northeast. He wouldn\u2019t have been able to justify the cost of the flight if he didn\u2019t have some fun there.</p></div>\n</div>"}

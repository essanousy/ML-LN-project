It was enough to unlock some subclass knowledge but he hadn't thought of what he wanted to unlock yet. As for exhibiting his medical skills in front of that old man, Lin Fan did it on purpose. In this society, trying to accomplish some things without using any connections was impossible. Moreover, this old man was pretty good. Although he was a silly Chinese doctor, he actually wanted to be Lin Fan's disciple. It wasn't a bad thing.</p><br/><p>This tenth-page major class medical knowledge was unlike the others. On top of that, he had the Encyclopedia's boost which made it nature-defying. Although Zhao Ming Qing was old, he had a firm foundation of knowledge. Learning a tenth of Lin Fan's Chinese medical knowledge was naturally not a problem. However, the only problem was that Zhao Ming Qing might not have much more time left in his life. In Lin Fan's eyes, within the limited amount of time he had, learning five percent of his knowledge would already be pretty good. Even if it was only five percent, it would be enough for him to become a godly doctor and a divine physician.</p><br/><p>Thinking about that old man, Lin Fan couldn't help but start laughing. If people knew that he took a sixty or seventy-something-year-old man as his disciple, they would probably be shocked to death.</p><br/><p>Then, Lin Fan didn't think much more of it. He decided to make use of tonight to write a copy of the medical writing, 'Various Types of Typhoid'. He was going to make a handwritten copy, which would also become the first godly book to be brought into this world.</p><br/><p>The next day!</p><br/><p>Lin Fan went to Cloud Street and sold his scallion pancakes. After that, his time was free.</p><br/><p>He had Wu Tian He in the shop to take care of the fortune-telling. Taking care of the customers wasn't a problem for him. If the customers wanted to request for Lin Fan to personally read their fortunes, it would be very very difficult. Firstly, because Lin Fan didn't want to cause too much trouble. Secondly, no one was worth having him do it personally.</p><br/><p>Whenever he read someone's fortune, it defied nature and changed fates. In the past, he did it because he had no money and fame but now, he decided not to play around anymore.</p><br/><p>After all, he didn't want to take the risk. If he divulged the will of the heavens, he would be struck by lightning. Although he wasn't afraid of being struck by lightning, it would surely not be a good thing either.</p><br/><p>At Nanshan Children's Welfare Institute.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing had gotten up early. When he reached Nanshan Children's Welfare Institute early, he started to check on the children's conditions. Yesterday's Lil' Fatty, in particular, was his object of investigation. Lil' Fatty was pressed down motionlessly while Zhao Ming Qing touched his legs. He started to consider the theory behind this situation. He remembered the acupuncture points that his teacher had placed needles at yesterday. After going home the previous day, he had searched for information regarding the various effects of these acupuncture points.</p><br/><p>However, he was very disappointed. After so much though, he still couldn't figure out the reason behind this.</p><br/><p>\"Hey, you came so early?\" when Lin Fan reached Nanshan Children's Welfare Institute, he saw Zhao Ming Qing investigating and he couldn't help but laugh as he asked.</p><br/><p>He knew that this old man was obsessed with Chinese medicine. The previous day's experience was definitely very impactful for him.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing immediately came to Lin Fan's side, \"Teacher, I thought a lot about it yesterday but I just can't understand it. What kind of effect would be produced by placing needles at all those acupuncture points simultaneously?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed, \"Don't be anxious. I'll teach you slowly. Right now, you just need to take a look. Soon, I'm going to give you a book that will be of great help to you.\"</p><br/><p>\"Ah?\" When Zhao Ming Qing heard this, he was stunned. Then, he became exhilarated, \"Teacher, is the book you're going to give me an ancient book?\"</p><br/><p>At that moment, Lin Fan looked up calmly and replied, \"Nope. It's a book of treasured medical wisdom that I've written through blood and sweat. It will contain examples of various illnesses and appropriate medicines. If you can read through it, your medical skills will be greatly improved. Greatly.\"</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing was filled with anticipation. He was extremely excited. Although he was old, he still couldn't hide his excitement.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan saw how excited he was and said, \"Alright, let's get to work now. As for these Chinese medicinal ingredients, you have your ways, so get them boiled and prepared for me.\"</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing nodded, \"Don't worry, teacher. Leave this to me. I'll get the academy's students to boil them.\"</p><br/><p>The previous night, Director Huang couldn't sleep. It was mainly because of the crippled Lil' Fatty who could suddenly stand. This had given her too much of a shock.</p><br/><p>\"Master Lin, I'll have to trouble you again today.\" Director Huang was standing at the side and she didn't dare to say too much because this was very important to her and she didn't want to waste Master Lin's time. To the children, good fortune had arrived.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded, \"It's no trouble. This is my duty. I'll definitely treat all these children and make them well. But some of them aren't within my power.\"</p><br/><p>Director Wang naturally knew what Master Lin meant by those that were not within his power.</p><br/><p>Han Lu was taking care of the children. Although he didn't seem bothered on the surface, his heart was not calm at all. Since the previous day, he had seen things that were shocking to him. They were things that were hard to believe.</p><br/><p>However, the reality was placed right before him. He didn't have any other choice but to believe it.</p><br/><p>The whole afternoon, Lin Fan treated the kids. The kids suddenly realized that their hands and legs could move. Naturally, they were ecstatic.</p><br/><p>To have such an obvious result was due in large part to the Encyclopedia's mystical boost. Without that mystical boost, treating these children would require a very long time. Hence, if Lin Fan passed his medical skills down to other people, they, too, could become legendary godly doctors but without the Encyclopedia's boost, they would never be able to achieve such results.</p><br/><p>After the previous day's events, Zhao Ming Qing now understood what he should do. Hence, while Lin Fan was treating the kids, he was on the side recording everything.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing had an understanding of the acupuncture points in the human body but what he didn't understand was why Lin Fan placed the needles at those acupuncture points and what kind of effect that would produce.</p><br/><p>\"The human body contains hundreds of interlinked networks. You don't have to be fixated on the leg region, you must also find acupuncture points at other places.\"</p><br/><p>\"Right now, this needle is on the Cheng Shan acupoint. And this one is on the Di Ji acupoint. These two are connected and can unblock the vessel blockage in the leg. Do you want to have a try?\" Lin Fan asked as he turned around.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing was excited but he instantly calmed down. Since his teacher allowed it, of course, he wanted to have a try. Doing it by himself and learning through words was very very different. But even though his medical skills were not bad, he wasn't going to use the children's bodies as an experiment. \"Teacher, you can carry on. I'll familiarize myself first using the dummy human body when I get home.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded, \"Mmm. Take a good look for now. With your current ability, you're still not able to perform this kind of treatment. Although you're a veteran Chinese doctor, some things require steady progress. Don't think of getting it in one go.\"</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing nodded, \"Teacher is right.\"</p><br/><p>Before he had met Lin Fan, Zhao Ming Qing was just a veteran Chinese doctor. He had followed the usual order of learning medical skills from young. He naturally knew that you can't expect to take big strides in Chinese medicine. You had to learn step by step. Using Chinese medicine to treat crippled body parts was something that he had never dared to imagine. The Chinese medical knowledge involved was way too profound.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \"With Chinese medicine, if you can understand all the big and small acupuncture points within the human body, their effects and their combined effects, you can treat any kind of sickness. Hence, you have to read more books on this subject. Of course, whatever is not written in the books, I will slowly teach you.\"</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing nodded excitedly. Although his teacher was young, he knew that real abilities were not dependant on age. Especially since his teacher was willing to teach him, he, of course, was very willing to learn. As for whatever criticism he would receive from the outside world, he didn't care at all. If he really did care about the opinions of others, he wouldn't be able to accomplish anything. Even with such vast Chinese medical skills placed right before him, he could lose everything.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Director Huang and Han Lu stood at the side. They didn't understand what Lin Fan and Zhao Ming Qing were saying but they felt that it seemed extraordinary.</p><br/><p>Especially this old man. Although he was old, he seemed to really have a disciple-master kind of relationship with Master Lin.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan wasn't stingy with his Chinese medical knowledge. Since someone was willing to learn from him, he was willing to teach. After all, raising a godly doctor might help to save countless lives. He didn't have to worry about Zhao Ming Qing because he was already a veteran Chinese doctor with good moral values.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

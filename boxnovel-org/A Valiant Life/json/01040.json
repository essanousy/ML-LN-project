Then, he looked at Wang Ming Yang\u2019s expression and felt helpless. He nudged his dad.</p><br/><p>\u201cDad, Ming Yang is asking you. Do you like it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan had not thought that Wang Ming Yang would give such a gift. Wang Ming Yang was not afraid of making a big deal out of this at all.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Lin Fan\u2019s dad came back to his senses. He looked at the big and completely gold God of Longevity sculpture in Wang Ming Yang\u2019s hands and didn\u2019t know what to say. He could tell that this thing was definitely pricey with just one look.</p><br/><p>\u201cMing Yang, it\u2019s good enough that you came. Uncle can\u2019t accept this gift. I can\u2019t.\u201d Lin Fan\u2019s dad frantically waved his hands. How could he accept such an expensive gift?</p><br/><p>Huang Ting just stood there. He was quite knowledgeable. When he saw this golden God of Longevity, he knew that it definitely wasn\u2019t cheap.</p><br/><p>Could it be that there was some kind of reason for this?</p><br/><p>\u201cDad, what\u2019s up with your classmate? He\u2019s really making things big. He\u2019s giving up his hard-earned savings. That helicopter just now must have been expensive even just for a short ride. And such a big golden God of Longevity sculpture must be worth at least several millions. It can\u2019t be fake, can it?\u201d whispered Huang Yun Ge.</p><br/><p>He wasn\u2019t just being suspicious. He really didn\u2019t believe it.</p><br/><p>Huang Ting didn\u2019t reply. It didn\u2019t seem that it was fake. Looking at the luster and craftsmanship of the item, it was very well-made. It didn\u2019t look like it was fake at all.</p><br/><p>When met with an uncertain situation, people would start to make things up in their minds.</p><br/><p>Huang Ting had started to form thoughts as well. Perhaps, Elder Lin had helped someone in the past, so that person was giving him a big gift for his fiftieth birthday.</p><br/><p>But to Huang Ting, it seemed that Elder Lin wasn\u2019t going to accept it. After all, it was a very expensive item.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang became a little anxious. \u201cUncle, this is my birthday present to you. You have to accept it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cDad, just accept it. This is just a form of goodwill from him.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Huang Ting heard that, he frowned. Then, he started to feel regretful.<em>Looks like Elder Lin\u2019s son can\u2019t resist the temptation of money.</em></p><br/><p>But thinking about it, it made sense. After all, if this God of Longevity was made of pure gold, it would be worth a huge fortune. Most people wouldn\u2019t be able to resist the temptation.</p><br/><p>Those other classmates who were sitting at the table were dumbfounded. They really couldn\u2019t understand what was going on.</p><br/><p>Then, they started to talk amongst themselves.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere did these people come from?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo idea. Elder Lin\u2019s fiftieth birthday celebration is pretty big, isn\u2019t it? Could it be that he hired actors to show off how well-off he is now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow is it possible that he would receive such a big God of Longevity sculpture? If it\u2019s pure gold, who knows how much it would be worth?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. This young man even said that he bought someone\u2019s gold shop. How is that possible? How could a youngster like him have enough money to do that? This is clearly just bragging.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSigh. I didn\u2019t think that Elder Lin would become such a person. Forget it. Let\u2019s not say anything about it. After today, it\u2019s better if we interact less with Elder Lin. This person is too fake.\u201d</p><br/><p>These people gossiped amongst themselves. They definitely wouldn\u2019t believe this scene. After all, it had completely exceeded their imaginations.</p><br/><p><em>This young man isn\u2019t even Elder Lin\u2019s own son. To give such a big birthday present, how is that possible?</em></p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not good,\u201d said Lin Fan\u2019s dad.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan leaned closer to his dad\u2019s ear. \u201cDad, take it. If you don\u2019t accept it, there will be a lot more things to deal with.\u201d</p><br/><p>After hearing his son\u2019s words, Lin Fan\u2019s dad had no choice but to accept the present with both hands. Just as he wanted to say something, he suddenly realized that the sculpture was so heavy that he almost couldn\u2019t hold on.</p><br/><p><em>It\u2019s too heavy. How heavy must this be?</em></p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang smiled, then looked at Lin Fan. The meaning in his eyes was clear, \u2018You\u2019ll have to have a good talk with him later. You can\u2019t just leave it at this.\u2019</p><br/><p>Lin Fan saw this expression and had nothing else to say. This had left him helpless.</p><br/><p>He Cheng Han\u2019s age was close to Lin Fan\u2019s father\u2019s, so he addressed his father as Big Bro. Although his present wasn\u2019t as expensive as Wang Ming Yang\u2019s, it was a jade bracelet. It had a brilliant luster to it and it was probably not cheap either.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan didn\u2019t even know what to say to these buddies of his from Shanghai. But now that they had already come, what else could Lin Fan do?</p><br/><p>He could only say \u2018You guys are really f*cking awesome.\u2019</p><br/><p>Huang Yun Ge whispered into his father\u2019s ear, \u201cDad, did you see that? You always say that people don\u2019t change. But look. This is very different from what you told me. I told you that there\u2019s no one in this world who won\u2019t change.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLook. There are gold and jade now. How much must they be worth? Just these presents are probably worth at least 10 million.\u201d</p><br/><p>Huang Ting shot a glare at his son. \u201cAlright, just eat your food.\u201d</p><br/><p>Huang Yun Ge sighed helplessly. His own father didn\u2019t believe him, so he was helpless.</p><br/><p>The people lined up to present gifts to Lin Fan\u2019s dad one by one and it continued for a period of time.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan quickly went to look for the waiter to open up a private room for these guys. If he were to let these guys stay in the banquet hall, who knew what kind of problems they would cause?</p><br/><p>The gifts were all given.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang and the rest had wanted to chat for longer in the banquet hall but Lin Fan dragged them away.</p><br/><p>His dad was already a little dazed. With all these presents in his hands, he didn\u2019t even know what to do.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Lin, what\u2019s going on? Do you know all these people?\u201d one of his old classmates, Zhang Hao, asked.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan\u2019s dad shook his head. \u201cI only know one of them but not the rest. I think they\u2019re all friends of my son.\u201d</p><br/><p>When he said that, everyone started sighing in their hearts. <em>Look. You\u2019ve been exposed. How respected must you be for people you don\u2019t even know to give you such big presents?</em></p><br/><p><em>And looking at the previous situation, it seemed that they didn\u2019t take no for an answer!</em></p><br/><p><em></em></p><br/><p><em>As for them being your son\u2019s friends, that\u2019s impossible. It\u2019s a complete lie!</em></p><br/><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t your son run a shop in Shanghai? How can his friends all be so generous? They even came here for your birthday. It\u2019s really amazing,\u201d said Zhang Hao with a smile. But the meaning behind this smile was \u2018Everyone here can see through you\u2019.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan\u2019s father saw the meaning behind that smile as well. He just smiled back and didn\u2019t refute.</p><br/><p>If it had been someone else, he would\u2019ve refuted long ago. But in front of these old classmates that he hadn\u2019t seen for so long, he really didn\u2019t want to say anything or argue with his classmates. If that were to happen, it would really be meaningless.</p><br/><p>Huang Ting coughed lightly. \u201cLet\u2019s eat and drink. Enough talk about that. Elder Lin and his son have wide connections. That\u2019s a good thing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Since the big shot had spoken, the other classmates had nothing to say. But the meaning in their eyes was clear. <em>Keep bragging, we\u2019re listening.</em></p><br/><p><em>You\u2019re the star today. Whatever you say goes.</em></p><br/><p><em>Anyway, we won\u2019t be in contact with you anymore after today. It\u2019s clear that you\u2019re bluffing us.</em></p><br/><p>And as everyone looked at how Huang Ting didn\u2019t say anything, they felt that it wasn\u2019t possible that it was true.</p><br/><p>He was probably not saying anything because he just didn\u2019t want to expose Elder Lin.</p></div>\n</div>"}

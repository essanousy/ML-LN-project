What will the final verdict be?\" Zhao Zhong Yang asked.</p><br/><p>\"Who knows? But I have a feeling that someone is going to get some easy money today,\" Lin Fan replied casually.</p><br/><p>\"I've already discussed with the renovation company and they asked me what style I want for the renovation. I told them to choose what suits it best. Are you guys okay with that?\" Fraud Tian grinned as he said.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded. \"That's good. Anyway, we don't really know anything about styles, so it's best to just let them pick what's best.\"</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan interrupted them from the side, \"I feel that the renovation style should convey some meaning to it so that the place will look more comfortable.\"</p><br/><p>At this moment, a police car pulled up at the court.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed as he saw Qiao Fei come out of the police car. \"Hey, isn't this Chief Qiao? You look really good today!\"</p><br/><p>Qiao Fei gave Lin Fan a death stare. \"B*tch, you better not let down your guard. I'm still not done with you.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan scrutinized Qiao Fei. \"That's weird. The other day you were so full of life, but today you really look under the weather. Did something bad happen?\"</p><br/><p>\"You...\" Qiao Fei was erupting on the inside. This b*stard dared to act so cockily in front of him. If this happened in Zhongzhou, he would definitely be killed. Qiao Fei had called a few leaders to help him, but no one dared to take any action.</p><br/><p>There hadn't been any problem at first, but after the leaders found out that it was Master Lin, all of them declined to help. They weren't scared of him, but the human trafficking case was too recent for them not to receive a bad rep if they did anything to him, so they decided not to take any action at all.</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian followed Master Lin by his side. He gave him a reassuring nod.</p><br/><p>\"Chief Qiao, your luck today isn't looking too good. You better stay low-key.\" Lin Fan smiled at him.</p><br/><p>Qiao Fei had never thought that he would get triggered by some young brat just like that. \"Alright, you better watch out. I can't do anything to you now, but when the tides turn, I'll make sure you'll cry.\"</p><br/><p>\"I'll wait for that day.\" Lin Fan shrugged his shoulders and waved Fraud Tian and the rest over. \"Come, let's go.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan didn't have a lawyer because he already had all the evidence needed. Hiring a lawyer would be useless unless Qiao Fei was able enough to counter their case.</p><br/><p>The waiting room.</p><br/><p>Qiao Fei was absolutely depressed and he wanted to take it out on something. He really wanted to kill this b*stard with all that was happening.</p><br/><p>Looking back, he should have just paid money to compensate, but this b*stard had brought him to court and he was completely helpless.</p><br/><p>The feeling of being locked up in a cell was terrible, and with the hot and humid weather, it was as good as punishment.</p><br/><p>*Ding ding!*</p><br/><p>Qiao Fei's handphone rang.</p><br/><p>The police warden hadn't confiscated Qiao Fei's phone because the case wasn't very serious. The person calling was his organization's CEO.</p><br/><p>A torrent of scoldings came from the phone speaker as Qiao Fei picked up his phone.</p><br/><p>Qiao Fei was confused. He didn't know what was happening but as he listened on, he was stunned.</p><br/><p>\"Do you know that Skyworth Organization and Cheng Yun Organization have signed a partnership agreement? Do you know how much money our organization has lost because of this? Couldn't you have dealt with this before you went to destroy someone else's shop?\" Qiao Fei was speechless as he heard his president scolding him over the phone, before hanging up and brooding for a good three minutes.</p><br/><p>Roaring sounds came from the defendants waiting area.</p><br/><p>\"F*ck your mum...\"</p><br/><p>The security officers immediately stopped Qiao Fei.</p><br/><p>Qiao Fei started going insane. He had never thought that Cheng Yun Organization would form a partnership agreement with President Lu's organization and steal their partnership chance.</p><br/><p>Everything had already been set in stone and the shareholders of the company would definitely not forgive him for this error.</p><br/><p>All of this was because of that little brat. If not for him, he wouldn't be in this rut right now.</p><br/><p>How could Cheng Yun Organization have managed to steal the partnership with Skyworth Organization?</p><br/><p>The start of the trial.</p><br/><p>All the evidence for the case had been collected and the only thing for the court of law to do was to determine the outcome of the case.</p><br/><p>Purposely smashing up a shop.</p><br/><p>This case didn't need to be overturned at all.</p><br/><p>The judges were stunned when they saw the compensation fee. Three hundred and thirty-two thousand? This was a rare sight.</p><br/><p>The other time they had seen a compensation fee so large was when a young man had thrashed up a whole Apple store after he had a quarrel with one of the employees while buying an iPhone.</p><br/><p>The final compensation fee had been four hundred thousand dollars.</p><br/><p>He had even gotten a jail term of three months, but it could have been worse. The young man had been sincere in acknowledging his error and the boss of the store had been forgiving enough. Otherwise, such a big case would have easily gotten him a three-year jail term.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan sat at the complainant's seat while Qiao Fei sat at the defendant's seat.</p><br/><p>This case didn't need any argument. The judges would give a direct judgment on the case and if either party disagreed with their judgment, they could appeal.</p><br/><p>\"Look at that guy. He looks like he wants to eat me up.\" Lin Fan pointed at the seething Qiao Fei, who was at the defendant's corner.</p><br/><p>\"Did you do anything to spite him? He really looks like he's gonna kill you.\" Fraud Tian gently asked Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>\"How would I know?\" Lin Fan replied.</p><br/><p>\"Quiet, everyone!\" the judge proclaimed.</p><br/><p>\"Master Lin's shop at Cloud Street was smashed up. After an extensive investigation, the defendant has been charged with intentional destruction of property and the final compensation amount is... a grand sum of three hundred and twenty thousand dollars. Owing to the fact that the defendant's behavior has been good, he will receive also a reduced sentence of a month's time in detention...\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed, \"I never thought I'd receive three hundred and twenty thousand dollars. I thought the original sum was three hundred thousand only.\"</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian exclaimed with delight, \"What a pleasant surprise. This is just too good an opportunity to earn money. Looks like I should open a few shops and invite a few more rich bosses to smash up my shops.\"</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang laughed out loud.</p><br/><p>Qiao Fei was indignant after hearing the final verdict, and thinking of how Cheng Yun Organization had stolen his partnership opportunity made him even more furious.</p><br/><p>*Bang!*</p><br/><p>Qiao Fei slammed the table in anger as he looked at Lin Fan, screaming, \"You little brat, just you wait... This thing cost me a huge deal and I'll never forgive you.</p><br/><p>The judge immediately shouted for security as the security officers dashed across to pin Qiao Fei down.</p><br/><p>The other judges who had been preparing to take their leaves looked on, stunned. The sentence was light enough already, but with this ruckus and all the vulgarities spilled, the punishment would have to be increased.</p><br/><p>\"What a fool...\" Lin Fan chuckled to himself.</p><br/><p>\"The accused has looked down upon the court of law and has compromised the accuser's safety. For this, he shall receive an additional six months of restricted freedom, effective immediately.</p><br/><p>\"Case closed.\"</p><br/><p>Qiao Fei screamed at Lin Fan while getting pinned down by the security officers, \"Just you wait, b*stard... You better watch your back.\"</p><br/><p>\"Fraud Tian, lift up your leg.\"</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian looked at Lin Fan in surprise, but he did it anyway. Lin Fan took off one of Fraud Tian shoes and threw it directly at Qiao Fei.</p><br/><p>*Bam!*</p><br/><p>The shoe landed on Qiao Fei's face and he instantly screamed out loud.</p><br/><p>\"Chief Qiao, I invite you to come back in 6 months to our shop. Our doors will always be open to you, but prepare some cash before you come.\"</p><br/><p>\"F*ck your mum...\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan clapped his hands as he looked at everyone. \"Alright, what a perfect ending. Let's go back and take a look at the shop. This time, we have to renovate it so that it looks more pleasant.\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

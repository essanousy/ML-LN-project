He was extremely stunned by Little Boss\u2019s words. If it was someone else who said that to him, he would definitely not believe it. However, it was Little Boss who said it.</p><br/><p>Why would he not believe his words?</p><br/><p>Although Little Boss was selling scallion pancakes and didn\u2019t really read anyone\u2019s fortunes anymore, everyone in Cloud Street knew how powerful Lin Fan was at reading fortunes. If he said that something bad was going to happen, it was definitely going to happen.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Boss, will my son be okay?\u201d Elder Chen asked anxiously. He was pinning his hopes on Little Boss.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe is temporarily okay,\u201d Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>He could only have said that. He didn\u2019t expect Elder Chen\u2019s fortune to turn out that way. However, something was wrong. In the past, he had helped everyone to look at their fortunes and nothing seemed bad. Why did this happen all of a sudden?</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t understand it but at least Elder Chen\u2019s son was still okay. However, it was difficult to say if something bad was going to happen later.</p><br/><p>Elder Liang asked, \u201cElder Chen, does your son have a handphone? Call him now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Chen replied, \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have a phone. I didn\u2019t give it to him as I was afraid of him playing with it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Liang said, \u201cQuickly call his teacher in charge and find out more.\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Liang was indeed a wise man. Lin Fan didn\u2019t even think of that at all. Suddenly, Elder Chen reacted and quickly called the teacher in charge. However, he couldn\u2019t get through.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat am I going to do? I can\u2019t get through. Did it happen already?\u201d Elder Chen started to think about all the bad things that could happen. His face was as white as paper. He had been working extremely hard since he left his hometown and he was finally able to have a stable life in Shanghai for his son to be here with him. He didn\u2019t expect this to happen.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan knew Elder Chen was extremely anxious. \u201cElder Chen, don\u2019t be anxious. It hasn\u2019t happened yet. If you\u2019re like that now, what are you going to do when you reach there?\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Chen held onto Lin Fan\u2019s hand tightly. \u201cLittle Boss, you have to save my son!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I am here, don\u2019t worry,\u201d Lin Fan nodded. Then, he moved his fingers to find out why did this happen. He didn\u2019t dare to confirm that he read the fortune of everyone at Cloud Street but he had read Elder Chen\u2019s fortune before and this wasn\u2019t supposed to happen.</p><br/><p>Although it could be said that his fortune-telling skills were at its best, this type of sudden change was unpredictable.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>At Jin Yang Secondary School.</p><br/><p>At a certain class\u2019 physical education lesson.</p><br/><p>Behind the toilet at the stadium.</p><br/><p>Chen Jun\u2019s son, Chen Liang, was lying on the floor.</p><br/><p>A teenager stomped on Chen Liang\u2019s head. \u201cYou didn\u2019t listen to what I said at all. Where is the money?!\u201d</p><br/><p>He was a youngster but he sounded fearsome. It was as if he didn\u2019t regard Chen Liang as a human at all.</p><br/><p>The other students gathered around and smiled as they recorded it on camera.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have any money.\u201d Chen Liang\u2019s voice was weak and he looked frightened.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck, you have no money? Why don\u2019t you steal some for me? You\u2019re a villager and your dad sells fruits. Do you dare to defy me? I asked you to pass the exam paper to me and you rejected me. Do you want to die?\u201d The teenager stepped on Chen Liang\u2019s face and scolded.</p><br/><p>Chen Liang didn\u2019t say anything. He just endured his insults.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Yang, will this fella tell the teacher?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Yang looked at Chen Liang disdainfully. \u201cDo you think he dares to tell the teacher? If he were to tell the teacher anything, I will make sure he learns his lesson.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, Li Yang pulled Chen Liang up and grabbed him by the neck against the wall. His hand moved and he asked, \u201cDo you know what this means?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Liang was afraid and he tried to hide, \u201cI\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>*slap*</p><br/><p>Li Yang immediately slapped him. Then, he grabbed Chen Liang\u2019s hair and pulled him. His entire body flew backward.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s more like it. If I don\u2019t see the money tomorrow, I\u2019ll make you eat sh*t. Do you believe me?\u201d Li Yang said fearsomely.</p><br/><p>One of the other students immediately handed a cigarette over, \u201cBrother Yang, this fella deserves to be beaten up.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Yang smoked the cigarette and waved his hand, \u201cContinue whacking him.\u201d</p><br/><p>The other students smiled and punched Chen Liang\u2019s face repeatedly.</p><br/><p>One of the students pulled down Chen Liang\u2019s pants and took pictures with his phone.</p><br/><p>\u201cStop it!\u201d Chen Liang tried to shrug them off but he was getting beaten up.</p><br/><p>Li Yang looked at Chen Liang, \u201cIf I don\u2019t see the money tomorrow, your picture will appear in the phones of every student. I want to see where you can hide your face at.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Liang\u2019s eyes were red. He wasn\u2019t going to retaliate. He had a low self-esteem and he didn\u2019t dare to retaliate. He didn\u2019t even dare to tell the teachers.</p><br/><p>Even if he told the teachers about it, it would have invited more trouble.</p><br/><p>Ding ding!</p><br/><p>School had ended.</p><br/><p>The physical education class had ended.</p><br/><p>Li Yang threw the cigarette away and looked at Chen Liang sternly, \u201cRemember, if you dare to tell the teachers, you\u2019re dead. I will kill you. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><br/><p>The others left together with him.</p><br/><p>Chen Liang wiped the tears from his eyes and wore his pants. He looked average and had a low self-esteem. However, he knew that it was difficult to get him to study in Shanghai. Hence, he didn\u2019t want to disappoint his dad.</p><br/><p>However, his nightmare began when he came here.</p><br/><p>Li Yang was the tyrant in school and there were a group of people that always followed him. If he didn\u2019t like someone, he would beat him/her up. Nobody dared to tell the teachers about it yet. Even if they did, it would have been useless. Although he would be scolded by the teachers, they would be in deeper trouble after that.</p><br/><p>Every time his dad visited him, he didn\u2019t dare to tell him about it. He could only hide it from his dad.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>It was time for class.</p><br/><p>Li Yang and the others sat at the back of the class. They were reading novels and they didn\u2019t care about what the teacher was talking about. Similarly, the teachers didn\u2019t care about them too.</p><br/><p>If they didn\u2019t offend the teacher, the teacher wouldn\u2019t make things difficult for them too.</p><br/><p>It was a language class and the teacher frowned, \u201cWhere did Chen Liang go?\u201d</p><br/><p>The students in the class looked at each other. They knew that Chen Liang got beaten up by Li Yang and the others but they didn\u2019t dare to tell the teacher about it.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI saw him before class.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know too.\u201d</p><br/><p>The teacher was a little suspicious. Chen Liang had decent results and was hardworking. However, he had a low self-esteem and was a quiet boy. However, he was always able to complete the teachers\u2019 tasks perfectly.</p><br/><p>\u201cLi Yang, do you know where Chen Liang went?\u201d The teacher looked at Li Yang and asked. Those people were the bad worms of the school. However, their families were quite influential and they entered the school via other means. They didn\u2019t even put in any effort in studying and were difficult to handle.</p><br/><p>Li Yang shook his head, \u201cI don\u2019t know, I haven\u2019t seen him. Maybe he skipped class.\u201d</p><br/><p>The teacher said sternly, \u201cEven if you were to skip class, people wouldn\u2019t skip class too.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Yang was shameless and he didn\u2019t bother about it at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cAHH!\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly, people started shouting outside.</p><br/><p>\u201cSomeone is going to commit suicide.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho is that? Why is he on the roof?\u201d</p><br/><p>When they heard the screams, the students looked out the window.</p><br/><p>The teacher quickly ran outside and when he saw the teenager sitting there, his face changed. \u201cChen Liang, what are you doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p></div>\n</div>"}

It was just a game of table tennis, was there really a need for the journalists to come?</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan, on the other hand, was elated. \u201cBrother Lin, you are really amazing!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved her away with a calm demeanor. \u201cIt\u2019s alright. My opponent wasn\u2019t any good anyway.\u201d</p><br/><p>For Wu You Lan, she simply adored Brother Lin too much. She definitely would have watched the program the previous night.</p><br/><p>As one of Lin Fan\u2019s most loyal fans, she definitely had to watch the program. At the start, she was seething with rage, seeing that the Japanese competitor was just so cocky. After seeing Brother Lin thrash him, her heart was filled with joy.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian looked at Lin Fan suspiciously. The more he looked at him, the less he understood him. This brat was just too strong, it was almost insanity.</p><br/><p>At the same time, he admired him for doing what he did on the program. The Japanese competitor was just too arrogant.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan opened his Weibo to find that a few netizens asked Lin Fan to play table tennis professionally. This caused him to feel a little helpless, and so he replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy fellow people, please stop teasing me. If I were to play table tennis professionally, I would bag all the gold medals, and the sport wouldn\u2019t be fun anymore. Forget it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Countless netizens almost vomited blood after seeing Lin Fan\u2019s reply.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn, I just realized that we can\u2019t ever praise him, otherwise he\u2019ll just become too cocky.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it were anyone else other than him who was cocky, they would have been brought down by us. However, this is Master Lin we are talking about, so I concede.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, well played. Consider my your forever loyal brain dead fan from now on.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled after seeing all those comments. Thereafter, he closed his Weibo. His table tennis thing was just to add flavor to his life and he wasn\u2019t going to take it seriously.</p><br/><p>At that moment.</p><br/><p>His phone rang.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho on earth is calling me?\u201d Lin Fan asked suspiciously. Recently, he had been getting a lot of calls from unknown numbers.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello, who is this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHello, Master Lin. I am Cui Guo Bin, you know who I am right?\u201d the person who was talking over the phone had a friendly tone, and his voice was lively.</p><br/><p>He turned to the member who was next to him, making it clear to him that Master Lin definitely knew who he was.</p><br/><p>He asked Master Lin if he knew who he was so he could let his members know that he was someone that was well known.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was stunned after he heard what the person over the phone asked. He absolutely didn\u2019t know who the other person over the phone was. It was awkward when other people knew who he was personally but he didn\u2019t know who they were.</p><br/><p>He wasn\u2019t someone that would let other people feel awkward.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, oh\u2026\u201d Lin Fan stammered. \u201cYou\u2019re that guy, that\u2026 who came\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Jeering!</p><br/><p>Laughter could be heard over the other end of the phone, and the people were going crazy.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan sounded a little awkward, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, who are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Cui Guo Bin felt a little hurt. He thought that he was someone that was rather famous, so how did Master Lin not know who he was?</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, I am the coach of the table tennis national team, and this is a little awkward.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, yeah I remember you. Sorry about that just now, I couldn\u2019t recall your name for a moment, Coach Cui,\u201d Lin Fan said, sounding a little awkward and apologetic over the line.</p><br/><p>On the other side of the phone.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, how embarrassing Brother Cui.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t I already say? Master Lin surely wouldn\u2019t know who you are.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAll to one side,\u201d Cui Guo Bin said, thereafter in a friendly tone, talked into the phone.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, I really want to thank you for what happened yesterday. You really redeemed our situation.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo problem. We are all Chinese nationals. We shouldn\u2019t let a Japanese person step all over our pride, no matter who,\u201d Lin Fan chuckled.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, that is absolutely correct. I also want to thank you on behalf of Xu Song. His performance in the Asia Table Tennis Competition hasn\u2019t been good due to his old injury. The stress on him was immense and it hasn\u2019t been easy on him after the defeat, but thanks to you, you solved the problem.\u201d</p><br/><p>For them, it was indeed a really stressful period.</p><br/><p>Table tennis was the national sport and they couldn\u2019t afford to lose.</p><br/><p>Although it wasn\u2019t explicitly stated, all the members knew that a loss was almost unforgivable.</p><br/><p>Every time when the competition came, the members of the national squad would be extremely stressed.</p><br/><p>It was especially so for the Asia Table Tennis competition. The competition was held in the nation and the stress was even higher.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled, \u201cCoach Cui, this is something that I should do as a Chinese citizen. How is Xu Song\u2019s injury?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cEh, it\u2019s manageable. It\u2019s an old injury, so it\u2019s probably untreatable,\u201d Cui Guo Bin said.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow about this; if you guys have the time, you should bring Xu Song over to Shanghai. I can assess his injury and maybe cure it,\u201d Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Cui Guo Bin\u2019s tone became even more excited, \u201cRight, Master Lin. You are the godly doctor as well. It wouldn\u2019t be much trouble for you if you personally see him, would it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat trouble? Don\u2019t even think about it. My location is on Cloud Street, when you guys arrive, just give me a call,\u201d Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>For the people in the national team, Lin Fan was someone that was friendly and humble. He was unlike most athletes who only cared about getting a high salary and looked for model girlfriends.</p><br/><p>\u201cGreat. Some of my members here are just itching to pit their skills against you too, but I hope that you\u2019ll go easy on them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSure thing, sure thing. Rest assured, I\u2019ll go easy on them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHA HA!\u201d</p><br/><p>After talking for a while more, both of them hung up.</p><br/><p>The national team.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin is really friendly!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s for sure. If you paid attention to the news, Master Lin has actually done a lot more good things, and he usually does them voluntarily without getting paid. He likes to poke his nose into things a lot. Remember the case about the foreign workers who didn\u2019t get paid? If it weren\u2019t for Mater Lin, those foreign workers would have had it bad.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen that case before, but I didn\u2019t really pay any attention to it. It looks like Master Lin is a good person.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, you guys better buck up in your training. When we go to Shanghai, you guys are going to pit your skills against Master Lin and learn from him,\u201d Cui Guo Bin said.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about you, Brother Cui?\u201d</p><br/><p>Cui Guo Bin blinked, \u201cI\u2026 I am not sure where I stand against him.\u201d</p><br/><p>The crowd all started laughing. They had analyzed Master Lin\u2019s playing style.</p><br/><p>There was only one verdict.</p><br/><p>He wasn\u2019t human.</p><br/><p>There was no way to play against him.</p><br/><p>In a random food street in Shanghai.</p><br/><p>A foreigner was carrying his luggage bag as he looked around. He was a Frenchman, and he was a food critic working for Michelin Company. His mission was to look for delicious food in Shanghai.</p><br/><p>Shanghai\u2019s Michelin Guidebook was in the process of being created, and he was looking around for good food.</p><br/><p>He had searched for a long time but nothing in Shanghai had satisfied his taste buds.</p><br/><p>For a food establishment to earn Michelin Stars, they had to meet a very strict set of criteria which was almost impossible to meet.</p><br/><p>However, despite his futile search thus far, he was still full of hope. With a city like Shanghai, he looked forward to eating everything, from snacks to gourmet food.</p><br/><p>The only thing was that everything that he had tried so far had left him disappointed.</p><br/><p>None of them could meet his expectations.</p><br/><p>In terms of food, none of the places that he had tried could meet his level of expectation.</p></div>\n</div>"}

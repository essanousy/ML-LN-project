However, whenever he used it, his eyes would turn purple. With so many people around, it was best not to take the risk. If he drew too much attention, he would be used as a research subject.</p><br/><p>After being through this incident, Director Huang had some anger that she could not vent out. She had thought that after working at the Welfare Institute, she had seen all there was to see. However, such an incident was really uncommon.</p><br/><p>Although Lil\u2019 Fatty was young, he understood what his only relatives meant when they had said all those things in public. It was a huge blow to his young little soul. His chubby hands grasped tightly onto Auntie Huang\u2019s clothing and his head was lowered as he felt a little upset.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan sighed as he thought to himself, \u201cD*mn, if something like this happens again, I\u2019ll just use violence to suppress it. The children are already pitiful. There\u2019s no need for them to be hurt again.\u201d</p><br/><p>He kneeled down and patted Lil\u2019 Fatty on the head. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Lil\u2019 Fatty? We\u2019ll be your family from now on. Be good. Uncle Lin prefers that cute and playful Lil\u2019 Fatty from before.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lil\u2019 Fatty looked up and looked as if he was about to cry. Then, he nodded his head. \u201cUncle Lin, Auntie Huang, Uncle Han and everyone, you\u2019re all my family.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled, then looked at Director Huang. \u201cThe matter has been resolved. If you come across something like this again, let me know immediately.\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Huang nodded. If it hadn\u2019t been for Master Lin, things would have turned out terribly. Fortunately, the Welfare Institute had Master Lin.</p><br/><p>Then, the two of them talked for a while more. Regarding the progress of the teaching block, Lin Fan didn\u2019t request for it to be fast but the quality had to be good. He didn\u2019t want it to be built on soybean dregs and he didn\u2019t want the children to be in any danger.</p><br/><p>The next day!</p><br/><p>The previous day\u2019s incident at Nanshan Children\u2019s Welfare Institute had been exposed and the truth had come out.</p><br/><p>Everyone who saw the news report was dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>Afterward, the netizens who had been stunned by the news all burst out in anger. Countless dirty words were flung at Wang Cheng Shan and Qiu Yan Lan.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, you fools! Don\u2019t you know what kind of person Master Lin is? You were scolding him so nonchalantly yesterday. Now, you\u2019ve been taught a lesson in life, haven\u2019t you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSince the start of the incident, I have been blindly standing on the side of Master Lin. No matter what, I\u2019ll always trust in Master Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan didn\u2019t bother about these things. The netizens were all forgiving themselves. After being fooled, they would all try to prove that they had always been righteous but they had just been lied to.</p><br/><p>However, this was fine too. Under this unseen influence, they would become cautious whenever something related to Lin Fan happened and they would no longer declare where they stand blindly.</p><br/><p>After all, they had been slapped in the face this time and it hurt very much.</p><br/><p>Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan wasn\u2019t affected by the previous day\u2019s incident. He was just doing what he should be doing. He continued to go to the Welfare Institute in the afternoon, as usual, to grow the plants with the children and share some of the knowledge regarding planting. Although this knowledge was a little dry, the children could also learn practically as they planted the plants, so they liked this class of knowledge very much.</p><br/><p>Just within these few days, there were already three children who had understood the knowledge.</p><br/><p>This rate of progression was good enough. It wouldn\u2019t be long until ten children would understand it.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Liu Xiao Tian called.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up, Inspector Liu?\u201d asked Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian said, \u201cMaster Lin, that couple is now kneeling in front of me and they want me to ask you if you would be willing to treat his illness.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said without hesitation, \u201cI won\u2019t. I\u2019m not in the mood to do it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, I got it.\u201d Liu Xiao Tian didn\u2019t say a single word of nonsense. Even if it was up to him, he wouldn\u2019t treat the man either. It was needless to say that Master Lin would not treat him. He didn\u2019t care what kind of background the man had.</p><br/><p>In the shop.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan said angrily, \u201cThat couple is really sinister. Just for their own sake, they actually do something like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved his hand. \u201cNo need to talk about this. It is already over.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian was leisurely smoking his cigarette and stroking his mustache. \u201cThis kind of situation is not uncommon. After experiencing this several times, you would get used to it. But what kind of method did you use to make him say the truth, kid? That was a little strange.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan glanced at Fraud Tian and said, \u201cYou\u2019re the only one who\u2019s so observant. Who knows? The customers are queuing, hurry up and give out the numbers.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe,\u201d Fraud Tian chuckled and didn\u2019t say much else. Then, he took out some number tags and shouted, \u201cQueue up in an orderly manner! I\u2019m giving out the number tags now!\u201d</p><br/><p>It was only at such moments that Fraud Tian could feel dominant as well. Regardless of whether the customers were wealthy or from successful families, they had to queue up if they wanted to have the scallion pancakes.</p><br/><p>Afternoon.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was accompanying the children at the Welfare Institute as they studied the flowers and plants together. Children have rather lively personalities. Whatever happened the previous day, they had already forgotten.</p><br/><p>Encyclopedic Points +1</p><br/><p>Yet another child had understood the true meaning of the knowledge. Indeed, after taking the perfect-grade little intelligence pills, the children\u2019s intelligence had all been raised. They learned everything quickly and they understood whatever they learned in an instant.</p><br/><p>*ring ring*</p><br/><p>Just as Lin Fan was explaining the contents, an unknown number called.</p><br/><p>He answered the phone.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho is it?\u201d asked Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>A deep, male voice came from the other side of the call. \u201cYou\u2019re Master Lin, right? I wish for you to personally apologize to Ying Jin on Weibo. Don\u2019t anger someone that you shouldn\u2019t be angering. Do you understand what I mean?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan, who had not been very interested at first, started laughing when he heard this.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh. Who are you? Judging by what you said, it seems that you are quite amazing,\u201d said Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou just need to remember that I am someone you cannot afford to piss off. Go and apologize on Weibo and this matter can be written off.\u201d</p><br/><p>After this period of silence, Lin Fan had almost forgotten about the incident regarding Ying Jin. Initially, Lin Fan had thought that Ying Jin had recognized her own defeat just like that. He had not expected someone to give him a warning. It was completely unexpected.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Lin Fan took a deep breath and walked a distance away. He didn\u2019t want to let those pure and innocent children hear his vulgar words.</p><br/><p>\u201cMotherf*cker, I\u2019ll spit in your face. If you have the ability, come to Cloud Street and look for me. Don\u2019t play around.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bam!</p><br/><p>He hung up.</p><br/><p>Regardless of what kind of background the opposition had, Lin Fan would not give him face. He had actually tried to threaten Lin Fan. He must not have known how f*cking awesome Lin Fan was.</p><br/><p>When the man on the other end of the call heard this, his face turned pale with anger. As he saw that the line was busy on the other end, his expression turned even uglier. It was as if he had swallowed dung.</p><br/><p>*ring ring*</p><br/><p>Just as the man was in a rage, he saw that this Master Lin had spontaneously called him. Then, he smiled coldly as he answered the call.</p><br/><p>Initially, he had thought that Master Lin had realized his mistake and called back to apologize. But when he answered the call, the vulgarities that came from the phone made him completely enraged.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan: \u201cI\u2019ll f*ck your mother.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even after cursing, Lin Fan was not satisfied. If he didn\u2019t find a way to vent his anger, he wouldn\u2019t be able to endure it. Then, he opened his Weibo.</p><br/><p>\u201cYing Jin, don\u2019t send your lover to come and threaten me. If you have the guts, I\u2019m here waiting at Cloud Street. The phone number of that person is 13584xxxx. Everyone, if you\u2019re free, go and give him a call. It would be best if you call him late at night.\u201d</p><br/><p>Upon sending this post, waves were made on the Internet.</p><br/><p>But at that moment, Lin Fan returned to explaining the plants and flowers.</p><br/><p>As for what kind of expressions Ying Jin and that man made at that moment, it didn\u2019t matter to Lin Fan at all.</p></div>\n</div>"}

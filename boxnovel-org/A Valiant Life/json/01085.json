I work in the court of law and I heard that we\u2019ve already accepted the case. If Master Lin still doesn\u2019t provide evidence, he will be in deep trouble.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt can\u2019t be.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t it be? Master Lin doesn\u2019t have any evidence so he\u2019ll definitely lose. Moreover, he\u2019ll have to go to jail after he loses. Anyway, he\u2019s screwed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSigh. What is going on with Master Lin? Why did he say such things on Weibo? Doesn\u2019t he know how severe this is? The Quality Inspection Office didn\u2019t even say that there was anything wrong with Tianshu Milk, which means that it has passed. I feel like he was asking for his own death.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaybe Master Lin felt that his life was too smooth-sailing, so he wanted to add some fun to it. But I think that this won\u2019t develop to such a serious stage that he\u2019ll have to go to jail. After all, Master Lin is not an average person. He has done so many things. The most he\u2019ll have to do is apologize and compensate.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight now, many corporations are supporting Tianshu Milk Company. Even some television channels are criticizing Master Lin\u2019s actions. His actions have been deemed as a serious case of spreading false rumors.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn. Hurry up and take a look at Master Lin\u2019s Weibo. That guy is up to something again.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, countless netizens looked at Lin Fan\u2019s Weibo and were completely dumbfounded. It could even be said that they were flabbergasted.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan: \u201cTianshu Milk Company\u2019s product doesn\u2019t meet the requirements. It has already affected my health. Hence, I\u2019ve already filed a lawsuit against them, requesting them to compensate for my health fees\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck. What is Master Lin doing? I really can\u2019t understand him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m confused. I really can\u2019t understand his actions at all.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs this still the Master Lin that I know? Why do I feel like Master Lin is suddenly becoming playful? Is he inventing a new type of scam? Milk scam?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn. That could be it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Some of the people who were siding with Tianshu Milk Company saw Lin Fan\u2019s Weibo and couldn\u2019t help but burst into laughter. To them, Master Lin was really stubborn. Even at this stage, he still didn\u2019t know the severity of the matter and he still acted pretentiously on the Internet.</p><br/><p>They already knew what was going to happen. If this Lin wouldn\u2019t have to bear the consequences, that would really be strange.</p><br/><p>Some reporters had very good relationships with Master Lin, so they hadn\u2019t been reporting much recently. However, reporters from outside of Shanghai didn\u2019t care about all this. As long as there was news, they would expose the news to the public.</p><br/><p>These words were also reposted by various big Internet celebrities.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, when some netizens saw the situation, they maintained their silence.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m a fan of Master Lin. Regarding this matter, I choose to stay neutral. Before evidence is released, I won\u2019t take sides.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSigh. Why do I feel like Master Lin is still struggling even though he is going to die? This is completely different from the Master Lin that I know.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, did you guys notice something? Wang Mei Tian is going to release a new album and Wu Huan Yue is going to release one as well. What\u2019s more, this new album was personally composed by Master Lin. Aren\u2019t you guys excited?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExcited my a*s. Before this matter is resolved, who would be excited about that? If Master Lin is charged with spreading false rumors, I\u2019ll have to stop being his fan. I won\u2019t even pay attention to those songs.\u201d</p><br/><p>Feiyue Entertainment Company.</p><br/><p>Chief Chen was sitting there and looking at the news as he couldn\u2019t help but laugh. \u201cIt turns out that this guy did this to promote the album. But I have to say that this guy\u2019s brain is not normal. Anyone with a brain wouldn\u2019t use this sort of method to hype himself up. He probably screwed himself up with this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Mei Tian laughed. \u201cIt really gave me a scare. When I saw this Weibo post initially, I didn\u2019t know if I could match up to them. But now, it seems like this Master Lin can\u2019t even defend himself anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Chen said, \u201d Don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s fine now. He\u2019s just digging his own grave. No one will be able to save him. Oh right, I donated ten thousand boxes of Tianshu Milk to the children in the mountainous areas under your name.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Mei Tian looked at her phone, then looked around to see that there was no one before giving Chief Chen a kiss on the cheek. \u201cI\u2019ve seen it. Right now, so many netizens are commenting on my Weibo that I\u2019m kind and they\u2019ll definitely support my album.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha,\u201d Chief Chen laughed. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. This is the best way to attract fans. I\u2019ve also hired many Internet trolls to start generating momentum for you. Also, we\u2019ve come to an agreement with Tianshu Milk Company and discussed the terms. This time, you have a big chance of becoming their brand ambassador.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing that, Wang Mei Tian was exhilarated. She hadn\u2019t expected herself to rise so quickly. If it turned out to be successful, she would be one step closer to success.</p><br/><p>Tianshu Milk.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis Master Lin doesn\u2019t know how to give up. It looks like he\u2019ll keep thinking that he can bully us unless we completely resolve this matter.\u201d The person-in-charge of public relations had a very scary look on his face.</p><br/><p>Ever since this matter had arisen, they had received notices from around the country that sales had stagnated. Citizens were unwilling to purchase their product because of the controversy. This had made them very anxious.</p><br/><p>They really couldn\u2019t stand this fella.</p><br/><p>At Tianshu Milk Company\u2019s Quality Inspection Department, an employee was looking at the test data in his hands. His expression had changed drastically as if he couldn\u2019t believe it.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Another employee saw this colleague\u2019s dumbfounded expression and he was curious. He wondered what had happened.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is bad.\u201d The employee who was holding the test result sheet had seen the data and his face was filled with terror. It was as if he had seen a ghost. He couldn\u2019t understand what was going on. Why was there such data?</p><br/><p>\u201cBad? Sigh, that\u2019s true. I don\u2019t know what that Master Lin is thinking. He actually said that there\u2019s a problem with our milk. We check our products every week and we haven\u2019t even found any problems. How could he have found a problem?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you looking at? What\u2019s so interesting about that sheet?\u201d</p><br/><p>That employee saw that his colleague was still looking stunned and he felt helpless. He took the test results over and took a look.</p><br/><p>Then, just as he was about to put the sheet of paper away, his hand suddenly stopped. He held the paper up and looked closely again.</p><br/><p>He even rubbed his eyes as if he felt like he was seeing things. But the data was plain and clear. The hand that was holding the sheet of paper started to tremble.</p><br/><p>\u201cWas there a mistake in the test? How could this be?\u201d</p><br/><p>His colleague shook his head. \u201cNo. I was curious so I tested last week\u2019s stock again. It\u2019s bad, there really is a problem. We have to let the higher-ups know at once. Otherwise, we\u2019ll be in deep trouble.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen why didn\u2019t we see this last week?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat was due to the odds. We only do selective testing. Maybe we were too lucky and we selected a bottle of milk with no problems. Quick, inform the leader. Otherwise, we\u2019ll be completely done for.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p></div>\n</div>"}

This is absolutely unbelievable. If one is to get his hands on one of Master Lin\u2019s paintings, wouldn\u2019t he be rich?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat kind of nonsense are you saying? Even the National Museum has taken in Master Lin\u2019s artwork. If you get your hands on one of his paintings, your net worth would immediately increase by tens of millions!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWould you be willing to sell it then? Such an item would only increase in value the longer you hold it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI would regard it as a family treasure and pass it down to my future generations. But it\u2019s now considered the top National Treasure.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was buzzing on Weibo. Countless people were stunned.</p><br/><p>Celebrities who had had problems with Lin Fan in the past were also stunned when they saw this news. It was a rare honor! Something that they knew that they would never be able to achieve in their lifetimes.</p><br/><p>As for the Master Artists, it was an honor that they had been chasing for their entire lives. But to them, it was extremely difficult. They wouldn\u2019t be able to achieve it no matter how hard they worked.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan\u2019s phone was on the verge of exploding.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang said, \u201cF*ck! Brother! This is unbelievable!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing much, nothing much. It isn\u2019t something worth mentioning.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTsk! Don\u2019t be like that! How can you still be low-key when you have reached this stage? I\u2019m not going to make things difficult for you by requesting for a painting. However, before I die, you ought to give me a painting!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, okay. No problem. What if I die before you do?\u201d</p><br/><p>*Spits* \u201cDon\u2019t say such inauspicious words! Let\u2019s not talk about all this. In any case, congratulations to you! It\u2019s an honor to have a brother like you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>After hanging up the call, Lin Fan saw that he had received a call from his dad. He laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cDad, is there something that you know?\u201d</p><br/><p>His father\u2019s excited voice could be heard booming through the phone, \u201cSon! Is everything on the Internet about you is true?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cIt\u2019s all true. Your son has helped you to win an honor. The ten paintings were taken in by the National Museum.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha\u2026\u201d At this moment, his dad\u2019s excited laughter came through the phone. He laughed and laughed. \u201cGood, good. My son is amazing. Don\u2019t get too cocky, and don\u2019t paint randomly for anyone. Even though your dad doesn\u2019t know much, he does know that rare things are higher in value. If you paint more paintings, your paintings might not be worth as much in future.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. This is a huge matter. I have to go and tell more people.\u201d</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t wait for Lin Fan to say anything before putting down the call.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan reluctantly shook his head. He knew who his dad was going to look for. He couldn\u2019t help but feel sorry for his Uncle Li, who had to encounter such a father who liked to brag. He would be left helpless.</p><br/><p>In Beijing.</p><br/><p>Wu Yun Gang was attending to clients. There was a widespread of dishes on the table. One look and you could tell that it wasn\u2019t cheap.</p><br/><p>Wu Ya Ting secretly peeped at her uncle. He had been laughing since the start. Could it be that something good had happened to him?</p><br/><p>However, at this moment, she thought of Uncle Lin.</p><br/><p>\u201cPresident Wu, what\u2019s the happy occasion? Why are you so happy?\u201d the boss of the client company asked while smiling.</p><br/><p>Wu Yun Gang couldn\u2019t help but chuckle, \u201cPresident Huang, do you know about Chinese Art Master, Master Lin?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I do know of him. He\u2019s a very young yet top-rated Chinese Art Master. His artworks have been taken in by the National Museum and his works are extremely high in value, yet they are not even in the market.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Yun Gang laughed, \u201cHe\u2019s my friend! Just before this, he agreed to give me a painting on my fiftieth birthday! I get extremely happy whenever I think about it!\u201d</p><br/><p>The other party was shocked and in disbelief. He passionately raised his glass, as if wanting to get a closer relationship with the other party.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Jiangning.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan\u2019s teacher, Teacher Xia\u2019s house.</p><br/><p>It was a big occasion for Teacher Xia\u2019s family. Her son was already twenty-five years old but was still single. As a result, Teacher Xia and her husband, Shen Hong, consulted a matchmaker to introduce him to a girlfriend.</p><br/><p>The matchmaker had found him a compatible girl and they had therefore agreed to meet up. However, the girl\u2019s family requested that they met up at his house instead, hence, he did not leave his home.</p><br/><p>Teacher Xia began packing the house early in the morning, making the house prim and proper. After which, she went out to the market to buy groceries in order to cook a widespread meal. After all, they could afford to lose anything but the girl.</p><br/><p>Both Teacher Xia and her husband were school teachers. Their job wasn\u2019t that bad. However, in Jiangning, they couldn\u2019t afford a house. Their current house was an old one. It wasn\u2019t big. It only had two rooms and one living room and was in a very old condition.</p><br/><p>What they were most afraid of was the girl\u2019s family avoiding their house.</p><br/><p>However, even if the girl\u2019s family was to avoid their house, they couldn\u2019t do anything. Shen Hong used to gamble in the past and had lost a considerable amount. Even though he could reclaim a portion of the loss due to him being a student, he still lost the money in other aspects.</p><br/><p>As of now, Shen Hong had quit his gambling habits and had been saving money together with Teacher Xia so they could buy a house for their son.</p><br/><p>Shen Liang was rather introverted. There was nothing extraordinary about his looks. You couldn\u2019t say he was handsome, yet you couldn\u2019t call him ugly either. However, his studies weren\u2019t bad. After graduation, he became a small department head with many career progression paths. He was going to meet the girl\u2019s family today and was feeling rather nervous.</p><br/><p>Looking at the girl\u2019s photograph, she wasn\u2019t exactly very pretty, but she was cute. She was younger than him by two years, and it seemed like she had just graduated from university.</p><br/><p>He was worried whether or not the girl would like him.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Downstairs.</p><br/><p>A two hundred and thirty thousand dollar car stopped below.</p><br/><p>The girl\u2019s family had arrived.</p><br/><p>The matchmaker got off the car and with a face full of smiles, she said, \u201cThis is Teacher Shen\u2019s house. Everyone in his family has a Master\u2019s degree. His parents are both teachers at the university. The young chap isn\u2019t too bad himself. He has a prospective career ahead of him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Such conditions were already considered pretty good. However, the only shortcoming was that the house was too old. It looked like it was from the 80\u2019s or 90\u2019s. It was going to be at least 30 years old soon.</p><br/><p>Moreover, the land area wasn\u2019t big. It was only about eighty square feet. In Jiangning, it was worth at most one million.</p><br/><p>The parents of the girl frowned. They weren\u2019t the snobbish type, however, they only had one daughter. Where would she stay after getting married? It would be unacceptable if it wasn\u2019t in a new house.</p><br/><p>However, as of now, they had not even met the guy side. They were going to have to look at the situation first.</p><br/><p>Shen Liang\u2019s date arrived. She didn\u2019t look too bad. Her father didn\u2019t want her to leave Jiangning and therefore hoped that she would find a nice place to call home.</p><br/><p>\u201cDoes your date stay here?\u201d A fashionable young girl asked from the side.</p><br/><p>Shan Wei Yan looked at her best friend and nodded her head.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Her best friend had more money than her, however, she wasn\u2019t a local. She had rushed over after hearing that her best friend was going dating, so as to look at the situation and keep a look out for her.</p><br/><p>However, she could tell that Yang Ning Ning had a disgusted expression. She was disgusted at the house, thinking that it was too shabby.</p><br/><p>The girl\u2019s father said, \u201cLet\u2019s go in and take a look first!\u201d</p><br/><p>Since they were already here, it was only natural that they went in to take a look.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p></div>\n</div>"}

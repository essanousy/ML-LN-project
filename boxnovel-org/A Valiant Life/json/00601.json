This was the first time she had seen such a good Welfare Institute. The children inside were very happy. No matter who the children saw, they would smile.</p><br/><p>As for how Lin Fan educated the children, she admired it very much. These children all liked drawing. Moreover, it was Chinese art.</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan saw Zhu Wei Wei, an idea arose in his heart as well. He didn\u2019t know if she would agree with his idea but no one would know the outcome unless he tried.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou say that you\u2019re a student of Jinling Teacher\u2019s College. I wonder if, after you graduate, you would be willing to come here to be a teacher for these children? Although we don\u2019t have an official post, you don\u2019t have to worry. Your wages and benefits will not be little. You\u2019ll also have all five kinds of social insurance and your housing funds covered,\u201d said Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Just through this short interaction, he had realized that this Zhu Wei Wei was a very good lady. She was patient, her heart was kind and the most important thing, that he saw using his fortune-telling, was that she had a very good fortune.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh!\u201d Zhu Wei Wei was startled. She hadn\u2019t expected Lin Fan to be so direct. However, her heart was moved a little. Although it was her first time here, she liked this place very much.</p><br/><p>As Yang Mu stood behind her, his brows furrowed. If Zhu Wei Wei were to become a teacher here in future, he wouldn\u2019t be able to see her, would he?</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, your question is a little too rushed, isn\u2019t it? Wei Wei\u2019s family\u2026\u201d But before he finished his sentence, Zhu Wei Wei interrupted him.</p><br/><p>Zhu Wei Wei said with a face full of smiles, \u201cMaster Lin, I like this place very much and I like being a volunteer as well. I am going to graduate soon. I am willing to come here to be these children\u2019s teacher. That is what I want.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yang Mu said hastily, \u201cWei Wei, you need to think it through properly. This is Shanghai. After you graduate, you\u2019ll have great future prospects, why would you come here to be a teacher?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Wei Wei replied, \u201cYang Mu, what\u2019s wrong with this place? After graduating from the college, I\u2019ll be able to find a better job but those better schools don\u2019t lack people like me. Over here, these children lack teachers. My greatest dream is to let these children receive an education.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Qian said, \u201cYang Mu, how can you not understand Wei Wei\u2019s thinking? And you even want to woo her. Aren\u2019t you just dreaming?\u201d</p><br/><p>She was Wei Wei\u2019s good friend. Naturally, she knew her best friend\u2019s thinking. Wei Wei had a good family background and she could\u2019ve gone to study at the world\u2019s best schools. However, she went to study at the Teacher\u2019s College because she wanted to be a teacher after she graduated. And all those good schools weren\u2019t short of teachers. The places that were most in need of teachers were these Welfare Institutes.</p><br/><p>Because some of these Welfare Institutes couldn\u2019t compare to those regular schools, there weren\u2019t many people willing to be teachers there.</p><br/><p>Yang Mu had nothing to say after being told off like that. He really didn\u2019t know what to say.</p><br/><p>Now that Wei Wei had said that, what else could he say?</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled, \u201cActually, I was just asking. If you aren\u2019t willing, it would be fine too. This Welfare Institute of ours is still building its classroom building. It hasn\u2019t taken shape yet. You can go back and consider it first. We will always welcome you here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Wei Wei shook her head, \u201cThere is no need to consider. I am willing to be a teacher here. Although I\u2019ve only been here for a day, I really like the children here very much. When I go back, I\u2019ll tell my fellow students about this and see if they are willing to teach here too.\u201d</p><br/><p>This Master Lin gave off a unique feeling. Throughout that day\u2019s interactions, that was her first observation.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t because he was handsome or because he had such influence.</p><br/><p>It was solely because of the kind of aura that he emitted.</p><br/><p>Previously, she had searched for \u2018Master Lin\u2019 on the Internet. When she had seen the contents shown on the web page, she had been completely stunned.</p><br/><p>The Hacker God!</p><br/><p>Godly Doctor!</p><br/><p>Chinese Martial Artist!</p><br/><p>Such titles had shocked her. If she hadn\u2019t seen them for herself, she wouldn\u2019t have believed them.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan gave a soft laugh. \u201cThank you very much then.\u201d</p><br/><p>He wasn\u2019t someone involved in the education industry. After the classroom building finishes construction, he really wouldn\u2019t know how to find teachers. Even if he were to go to the Shanghai Teacher\u2019s College, there might not be anyone willing to come. After all, there were some things that he couldn\u2019t give them.</p><br/><p>But if he had Zhu Wei Wei\u2019s help, it would be much simpler.</p><br/><p>Then, Lin Fan said, \u201cWait a moment.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Wei Wei and the rest were about to leave but when they heard that, they were puzzled. \u201cIs there anything else, Master Lin?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI see that you will be met with a small calamity in the near future but it isn\u2019t much. You are very kind, so I want to give you a heads up. Don\u2019t walk by the river anytime soon. Stay far away from water bodies,\u201d said Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>He had initially not planned to tell her. Although she would have a small calamity, it wasn\u2019t a big problem. However, since she was so kind, Lin Fan had to give her a heads up. Avoiding a small calamity wouldn\u2019t be bad either. There was no need for her to receive such punishment.</p><br/><p>Zhu Wei Wei didn\u2019t say much. She just nodded and said, \u201cGot it.\u201d</p><br/><p>But after they left\u2026</p><br/><p>Yang Mu muttered, \u201cThat guy acts strangely and mysteriously. You have to think this through, Wei Wei. I don\u2019t think that man is reliable.\u201d</p><br/><p>The surrounding guys nodded as well. While they had been at the Children\u2019s Welfare Institute, Lin Fan had completely neglected them. Moreover, what did he mean by what he said when they were leaving? They just couldn\u2019t understand.</p><br/><p>Li Qian looked at them and said, \u201cWhat do you guys know? This is fortune-telling. There are many people like this near my home. Wei Wei, since Master Lin has said that, you have to be careful.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMmm, I did a search on the Internet just now. This Master Lin has many different identities. It seems that his fortune-telling is very accurate. Although this is pseudoscience, I will be a little more careful in the near future and stay away from water bodies.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although Zhu Wei Wei didn\u2019t believe in all these, she realized that Master Lin didn\u2019t seem like he had been joking with her. It was as if it would really happen.</p><br/><p>Yang Mu shook his head and sighed helplessly, \u201cWei Wei, you\u2019re too easily cheated. If this guy was really that mystical, why would he still be idling here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Although Zhu Wei Wei didn\u2019t say anything, what Yang Mu said really did make some sense. If this Master Lin really had such great abilities, he wouldn\u2019t just be idling there.</p><br/><p>People nowadays would soar for the skies as long as they had some ability.</p><br/><p>But what they didn\u2019t know was that Lin Fan wasn\u2019t willing to soar for the skies. He just enjoyed living his current life.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Uncle Lin, why haven\u2019t you gone back yet?\u201d Lil\u2019 Fatty looked up and asked curiously as he pulled on Lin Fan\u2019s sleeve and sniffled.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at Lil\u2019 Fatty and couldn\u2019t help but smile, \u201cLil\u2019 Fatty, Uncle Lin shall give you something good. Have a try.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>When Lil\u2019 Fatty heard that there was something good, his eyes instantly lit up and he couldn\u2019t wait to see it.</p><br/><p>365 children. Each little intelligence pill required 20 Encyclopedic Points. Adding that up, he would need 7400 Encyclopedic Points.</p><br/><p>That was an astronomical amount.</p><br/><p>But to the current Lin Fan, it wasn\u2019t anything too difficult.</p><br/><p>He wanted to see if his Encyclopedic Points would be able to skyrocket once more in the near future.</p><br/><p>Completing two tasks would unlock two new categories of knowledge. He wondered what knowledge those would be. Naturally, he was filled with anticipation.</p></div>\n</div>"}

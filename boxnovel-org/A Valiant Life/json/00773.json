Suddenly, her objective appeared.</p><br/><p>That red BMW seemed to be driven by a female and she definitely wasn\u2019t poor. More importantly, the car wasn\u2019t traveling at a very fast speed. As long as the old lady fell in the right position, it wouldn\u2019t be a problem.</p><br/><p>The owner of the red BMW was a young lady. She was leisurely driving her car but suddenly, she realized that there was an old lady in front.</p><br/><p>In the blink of an eye, the old lady fell to the ground.</p><br/><p>She jammed the brakes.</p><br/><p>The car stopped a meter away from the old lady.</p><br/><p>As she lay on the ground, the old lady heaved a sigh of relief. She had nearly been crushed but now, she was safe. She immediately pretended to have lost consciousness.</p><br/><p>The young driver got off the car in a panic.</p><br/><p>Had she collided with the old lady? But she didn\u2019t feel as if the car had collided with anyone. Moreover, she had stopped the car in time. It wasn\u2019t possible.</p><br/><p>Could it be that the old lady was a fraud, pretending to have been knocked by the car?</p><br/><p>There were no surveillance cameras here and her car did not have a recording device installed at the moment, so the situation was a little difficult to explain.</p><br/><p>But regardless, she still got off the car in a hurry.</p><br/><p>\u201cGranny, are you okay?\u201d asked the young lady.</p><br/><p>However, the young lady just lay motionlessly on the ground as if she was dead. The young lady was so frightened that her whole face turned white. If something really happened, she wouldn\u2019t be able to explain herself.</p><br/><p>There weren\u2019t many people around but when this happened, people started gathering around.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, someone got hit by a car. It\u2019s a female driver again. Women clearly aren\u2019t able to drive but they still insist on driving. Now, an accident has happened.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLooking at this car, it seems like a new one. It must be a new driver.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is an evil sin! It\u2019s a murder on the road.\u201d</p><br/><p>When female driver heard these, she was momentarily at a loss. She panicked, \u201cI didn\u2019t hit her. I don\u2019t even know how she appeared here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course you don\u2019t know. Nowadays, people are always playing with their phones while driving. With your head down, how would you be able to see the situation?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah! Yeah! I always say that people nowadays always use their phones while driving. Even if you don\u2019t care about your own life, you can\u2019t cause harm to others!\u201d</p><br/><p>The female driver was speechless. There was no way for her to explain herself.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happened? What happened?\u201d At this moment, two middle-aged men appeared from within the crowd. When they saw the elderly lady on the ground, their faces turned anxious.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happened to this elderly lady?\u201d One of the middle-aged men immediately went forward and squatted down. Then, he looked at the young lady, \u201cYou hit her?\u201d</p><br/><p>The young lady said anxiously, \u201cBig Bro, I didn\u2019t hit her. I don\u2019t even know how this happened.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSigh, at this point, you\u2019re still thinking about whether you hit her? This old lady is still lying here, we should hurry up and send her to the hospital. Who\u2019s gonna help me out? Let\u2019s send this old lady to the hospital\u201d</p><br/><p>Nobody emerged from the crowd. They all just spectated from the side. At the same time, someone said, \u201cYeah, some of you should hurry up and help out.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe safety of the old lady comes first. Hurry up and help her.\u201d</p><br/><p>They all urged each other to help the old lady but none of them went to help her. None of them wanted to be dragged into this matter.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go.\u201d The middle-aged man\u2019s buddy appeared. \u201cI\u2019ll send the old lady to the hospital with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have enough money on me. How much do you have right now, young lady? Just pay for her first. Later on, when we reach the hospital, we\u2019ll need to pay them,\u201d said one of the middle-aged men.</p><br/><p>The young lady was a little taken aback. Her mind was blank as she answered nervously, \u201cI didn\u2019t bring much money when I came out. I only brought six or seven thousand.\u201d</p><br/><p>When the two middle-aged men heard this, they were stunned. This motherf*cker just said that she didn\u2019t bring much money. Were all young ladies so rich these days?</p><br/><p>\u201cIt should be enough. Hand over the money to us first. We\u2019ll go to the hospital immediately. After taking care of your car, you should hurry to the hospital. But don\u2019t even think of running away. We\u2019ve remembered your car plate number,\u201d said one of the men.</p><br/><p>The young lady ran back into her car anxiously and took out her Louis Vuitton bag. She took out all the money from that bag.</p><br/><p>When the two middle-aged men saw the money, their hearts were moved. Their gazes were fixed on those red notes.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>At that moment, when no one was noticing, Elder Dog Nicholas charged in ferociously. He had not expected himself to have arrived late.</p><br/><p>Looking at the motionless old lady, he came to her side and took a sniffle. There was still breath coming out of her. She seemed to still be alive.</p><br/><p>Ever since he had eaten the \u2018Righteous Dog Food\u2019, he felt as if he had already become a righteous Chinese countryside dog. He had to do some righteous deeds.</p><br/><p>In his experience, he had seen many humans, during emergency treatment, doing mouth-to-mouth actions. It was like artificial respiration.</p><br/><p>At this moment, he decided to learn as he went. With no one noticing, he aimed his dog mouth at the old lady\u2019s mouth.</p><br/><p>The old lady, who had her eyes closed as she lay there, felt something wet touch her mouth. Instantly, she became a little angry. Which b*stard was trying to take advantage of this old lady?</p><br/><p>Moreover, there was a unique smell which she couldn\u2019t quite describe. It didn\u2019t smell like a human.</p><br/><p>Then, she opened her eyes just a tiny bit as she wanted to see who on earth it was.</p><br/><p>But when her eyes opened, the old lady was astonished. A dog\u2019s head had appeared in her vision.</p><br/><p>In an instant, she was stunned with fear.</p><br/><p>She was most afraid of dogs. And now, there was a dog licking her.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh!\u201d</p><br/><p>A cry rang out, startling everyone.</p><br/><p>\u201cDog, scram! Scram!\u201d The old lady immediately got up, using her hands and legs to shoo the dog away.</p><br/><p>When Elder Dog Nicholas saw this, he jumped up in joy. He had really managed to save her!</p><br/><p>He had done a righteous deed.</p><br/><p>When the surrounding spectators saw this, their jaws dropped.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck. Could it be that this old lady was pretending to have been hit by the car?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems like it. Look, she\u2019s as lively as a tiger now. She looks perfectly fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn. If it wasn\u2019t for that dog, we would probably all have been cheated.\u201d</p><br/><p>That young lady who had been about to hand over her money saw this and immediately held tightly to her money. At this moment, she realized what had happened. Then, she said in a stern voice, \u201cYou guys were trying to scam my money!\u201d</p><br/><p>The two middle-aged men had not expected this to happen. Then, they said anxiously, \u201cWhat are you talking about, young lady? Why don\u2019t you hurry up and hand us the money so we can take the old lady to the hospital?\u201d After saying this, they looked as if they were about to snatch the money from her by force.</p><br/><p>Under broad daylight, something like this actually happened.</p><br/><p>When Elder Dog saw this, he couldn\u2019t stand it. Elder Dog was here, how could something like this happen?</p><br/><p>\u201cWoof woof!\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Dog barked in a frenzy, then charged forward. He leaped up and bit onto one of the middle-aged men\u2019s wrist.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh! This dog is biting me!\u201d The middle-aged man who had been bitten cried out in terror. He slapped Elder Dog\u2019s body with his other hand.</p><br/><p>Elder Dog Nicholas spun one round in the air before landing steadily. His dog eyes gleamed as he charged towards the other middle-aged man. Then, he leaped up and attacked the middle-aged man\u2019s face with his four paws.</p><br/><p>Most dogs, even if they attack someone, don\u2019t have much strength.</p><br/><p>That middle-aged man had not been too bothered as he was preparing to grab the dog that was leaping towards him. But when his hands touched Elder Dog, he suddenly realized that Elder Dog was flying towards him with immense power.</p><br/><p>He took a heavy blow to the face and he fell backward completely.</p><br/><p>Thud!</p><br/><p>He lay flat on the ground.</p><br/><p>The passersby were all astonished when they saw this.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn! It\u2019s a Kung Fu Mutt!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis mutt is too strong!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck, I must be living in a dream.\u201d</p><br/><p>Woof woof!</p><br/><p>Elder Dog spread his legs open and stooped down as he barked at the three of them. Needless to say, his imposing manner was terrifying.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis dog is too strange. Let\u2019s run away!\u201d When the three scammers saw this, they didn\u2019t dare to stay any longer. They ran away with their tails between their legs.</p><br/><p>The young lady stared blankly at the scene. She had not thought that she would be saved by a mutt.</p><br/><p>When Elder Dog saw that those three had run away, he felt very happy. He had done a good deed. But now, he felt an urge to piss, so he went to the red BMW\u2019s tire, lifted his back leg and splashed his urine over it. Then, with a quick turn of his dog head, he ran off into the distance.</p><br/><p>From what the young lady had seen, this mutt that saved her must have been a wild dog. Hence, she had wanted to keep him. However, in an instant, Elder Dog\u2019s silhouette had disappeared from everyone\u2019s view.</p><br/><p>The spectators exchanged looks.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you guys record that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI recorded it. That dog was incredible.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, if I didn\u2019t see that for myself, I wouldn\u2019t believe it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p></div>\n</div>"}

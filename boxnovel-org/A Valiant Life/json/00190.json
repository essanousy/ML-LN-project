No one knew where he went off to play. Maybe he was thinking of ways of how to get onto the poodle.</p><br/><p>Elder Dog Nicholas' body was short and stout. Even if he stood up straight, he wouldn't be able to penetrate, let alone get onto the poodle. Perhaps he was cowering in shame now. </p><br/><p>\"Express delivery for Elder Dog Nicholas!\"</p><br/><p>At this moment, a man working for an express delivery company came with a huge box. It's contents were unknown.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked up at Fraud Tian. \"Can you help me see what's inside?\"</p><br/><p>The express delivery worker looked at Fraud Tian. \"You're Elder Dog Nicholas? Can you sign this express delivery form.\"</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian signed the document with his own signature. He saw Elder Dog Nicholas chasing after another dog, then pointed at him. \"That's Elder Dog Nicholas, we're just signing as recipients.\"</p><br/><p>The express delivery worker turned his head and took a glance, looking overjoyed. There were a lot of interesting happenings around recently, but he didn't say anything more as he took his leave in his delivery van.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan curiously looked at the humongous box in wonder. \"I wonder what's in the box.\"</p><br/><p>\"Not sure, but it's rather heavy.\" Fraud Tian shook his head.</p><br/><p>\"Maybe it could be one of Elder Dog Nicholas' fans?\" Zhao Zhongyang chuckled.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed. \"How can it be? If any fans were to send him something, it would have to go through me first.\"</p><br/><p>\"What's there to guess? Just open it and take a look.\" Fraud Tian took a key and sliced open the tape on the box. \"This is for Elder Dog Nicholas, and if you b*stards want it too, you've got to fight him for it.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan immediately lost interest when he saw the contents of the box.</p><br/><p>Premium dog food!</p><br/><p>Expensive dog food!</p><br/><p>It was a whole box of dog food, together with a few dog food bowls.</p><br/><p>\"Wow, I never realized that Elder Dog Nicholas was this popular. Someone even went out of their way to prepare a whole feast for him.</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhongyang opened his live broadcast chat. \"Which generous person gave this to Elder Dog Nicholas? This is so kind of you!\"</p><br/><p>In the live broadcast channel.</p><br/><p>\"So cool! This brother is so fast! The case happened only yesterday, and this gift box was already sent today.\"</p><br/><p>\"I was the one who sent it. Elder Dog Nicholas is just too strong! He should be rewarded well.\"</p><br/><p>\"Damn. We should also do the same as well! Elder Dog Nicholas is so awesome! We would be doing him a disservice if we didn't give him something after all that he's done.\"</p><br/><p>While the people were all tuned into the live broadcast, the express delivery van roared down the street to the front of the shop once more.</p><br/><p>\"Another delivery for Elder Dog Nicholas! Please sign here,\" the express delivery worker shouted.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan and Fraud Tian looked at each other in disbelief. This was completely against any logic.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian signed the document and opened up the box. Another box of dog food, dog bowls, and dog toys.</p><br/><p>\"Looks like Elder Dog Nicholas is really popular. This is his second gift already, and it's huge! This amount of dog food would be enough to last him a lifetime,\" Wu You Lan said.</p><br/><p>\"Our shop isn't big enough to keep all the dog food.\" Lin Fan sighed and shook his head.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan thought for a while. \"Actually, we can distribute the food to the other dogs. There are quite a few abandoned dogs out here on Cloud Street. There should be no problem if we distributed it to all of them.\"</p><br/><p>\"That's a good idea.\" Lin Fan's eyes brightened up. \"Either way, Elder Dog Nicholas won't be able to finish all of these. It's better to just share it among all the other dogs.\"</p><br/><p>Not long after, the express delivery worker made another round to Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>\"Another delivery for Elder Dog Nicholas!\" By this time, the express delivery worker was smarter. He looked for every single package delivered to Elder Dog Nicholas at the goods delivery center and gathered them before making his delivery.</p><br/><p>He was in disbelief. Who exactly was this Elder Dog Nicholas? Every single delivery for him were just huge boxes after huge boxes. He couldn't believe it when Fraud Tian pointed out to him that the dog who was running around was Elder Dog Nicholas. How could a dog get this popular?</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian signed to receive one box, and the express delivery worker brought him another. \"Every single package in the van is his.\"</p><br/><p>At this moment, Fraud Tian was stunned. He took a glance at the back of the delivery van. There were at least ten huge boxes inside. If he were to keep all of them in the shop, there wouldn't even be space to move a leg.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan slapped his forehead after realizing the reason why there were so many deliveries for Elder Dog Nicholas. Zhao Zhong Yang's live broadcast channel was quite popular, especially that day when they were looking for the missing child. The viewership went beyond hundreds of thousands. Viewers sending gifts was a normal thing to expect.</p><br/><p>Leaving all the express delivery boxes at the shop front, Lin Fan asked Fraud Tian to gather all the other shop owners at Cloud Street to split the goods. All the dogs on Cloud Street won't be able to finish the food, let alone Elder Dog Nicholas. He would explode from eating all of it.</p><br/><p>\"Well, it's official. These dogs are more popular and more valuable than us.\" Fraud Tian let out a huge sigh.</p><br/><p>All the shop owners in Cloud Street gathered around Lin Fan's shop front. Their view of the wild dogs Cloud Street changed completely. Before, they were always afraid that those dogs would bite and were too dirty, but after Sister Hong's case, they suddenly became welcoming of the dogs. Each shop owner took one or two boxes back so that they could feed the wild dogs or their own pets.</p><br/><p>What was originally Elder Dog Nicholas' gift was given out to everyone. Lin Fan only kept a few packs of food for Elder Dog Nicholas.</p><br/><p>If Elder Dog Nicholas knew that he was so well liked by the netizens and had received so many gifts from them which were subsequently given away by his heartless owners, no one could tell if he would leap up suddenly to bite them on the balls. Word of this better not get out.</p><br/><p>What bothered Lin Fan the most now was his promise he made to them the day before. The promise that the dogs could ask for scallion pancakes anytime. Looking at the current situation, these dogs didn't have any sense of decency. On Elder Dog Nicholas' command, all the dogs would gather from all around and sit in front of Lin Fan's scallion pancake counter to wait patiently for their scallion pancakes. This was too much stress for him.</p><br/><p>It looked like Lin Fan had to have a talk with Elder Dog Nicholas. But no matter the outcome, he had to make sure that Elder Dog Nicholas was on his side.</p><br/><p>\"Woof woof!\"</p><br/><p>Elder Dog Nicholas was depressed. He plopped himself in front of Lin Fan's shop, unable to move, his olive-black eyes gloomy and overcast. He had lost all hope and confidence in himself. He looked up at the poodle across the street and then looked down and buried his face in the ground. His plan was a complete failure.</p><br/><p>\"Elder Dog, I have something to discuss with you. I don't have enough ingredients to make scallion pancakes, so you won't be able to eat that many in the future. If you keep on calling your other dog pals to come and eat, I'm afraid there may not even be enough scallion pancakes for yourself.\"</p><br/><p>Elder Dog Nicholas' mood was in a slump, and he didn't feel like talking at all. But upon hearing that he might not have scallion pancakes to eat, he immediately stood up and barked.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shook his head. \"I can't do anything about it. I don't have enough ingredients. But if it was just you eating every day, I'll have enough ingredients then.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan thought for a while more.</p><br/><p>\"But since you're the Elder Dog, I reckon you won't just keep it to yourself, will you?\"</p><br/><p>\"Woof woof!\"</p><br/><p>\"They don't have to eat it then. Just let me eat it. Just make one for me every day!\" Elder Dog Nicholas barked.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled. \"Good, good. Please don't be so generous next time. I'll make scallion pancakes for you only. But if you tell your other dog pals to come, there won't be any more scallion pancakes for you.\"</p><br/><p>\"Woof woof!\"</p><br/><p>Elder Dog Nicholas agreed without hesitation.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was laughing on the inside. Although Elder Dog Nicholas wasn't stupid, he wasn't very smart either. He was rather easy to dupe.</p><br/><p>\"Can I ask if there's a Master Lin around here?\" A voice came from outside the shop.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked up. There were two people standing outside. He recognized one of them as Director Zhang from Ren He Hospital but he didn't recognize the other.</p><br/><p>\"That would be me. What's up?\" Lin Fan replied.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

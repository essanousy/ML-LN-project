You chat so well with all the people who come to bathe. And they\u2019re even so willing to talk to you. After scrubbing backs for so many years, I haven\u2019t come across anything like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>The other back-scrubbers were all asking in astonishment. To them, this didn\u2019t make sense. It seemed that this Little Boss had some kind of demonic power that caused the bathers to open up their hearts and spill everything out.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. Of course they hadn\u2019t come across anything like this. It was because of the awesomeness of the godly back-scrubbing skill.</p><br/><p>Jiang Tao had told Xiao Hui about everything in his heart and the two of them were both very happy.</p><br/><p>At that moment, on the bed.</p><br/><p>Jiang Tao took out his phone and opened the reviewing app. He found that bathhouse.</p><br/><p>To him, what happened that night was unforgettable. That back-scrubbing Big Bro was really very mysterious. There was nothing that he wouldn\u2019t tell him. The most important thing was that his back-scrubbing technique was too great. It made his entire body feel so comfortable and made him feel so good that he didn\u2019t want to leave.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is a bathhouse along Cloud Street and in the bathhouse, one of the back-scrubbers is a young man. His technique is amazing, but that isn\u2019t the important part. The important part is that when you face him, all the matters in your heart will be resolved. I rate this five stars and I strongly recommend this place. Whoever goes there would know. Remember, that back-scrubber is a young man. Highly recommended.\u201d</p><br/><p>After leaving the review, he switched off his phone and looked at Xiao Hui, who was lying next to him. A smile spread across his face.</p><br/><p>After Wang Yu had returned, he saw his wife busy working at home. And he also realized that his wife looked at him as if she had something to say but probably thought of the previous situations and didn\u2019t say anything. She just buried herself in her work.</p><br/><p>He went forward and said, \u201cWife, let\u2019s go out for a meal later on. I haven\u2019t gone shopping with you in a long time. The last time you said you liked a piece of clothing, right? I feel that it suits you very much. Let\u2019s buy it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Yu\u2019s wife looked at him as if she didn\u2019t recognize him. Then, with an emotional smile, she asked, \u201cReally?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Yu nodded, \u201cRealer than the realest gold and silver.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI love you so much!\u201d Wang Yu\u2019s wife giggled happily and kissed him on the cheek. She realized that her husband was different from usual today.</p><br/><p>Wang Yu was laughing too. His heart was incomparably delighted. But he had something important to do right now and that was to leave a review about this mysterious Big Bro.</p><br/><p>It was just an average bathhouse but inside, there was a mystical Big Bro.</p><br/><p>On the way back, he had also wondered why he had said all this to a stranger but after thinking for some time, he still couldn\u2019t understand it. He had just felt as if it would feel better if he said it out.</p><br/><p>10 o\u2019clock.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan packed up his things and prepared to leave.</p><br/><p>Zeng Wei smiled and asked, \u201cLittle Boss, how do you feel?\u201d</p><br/><p>To him, Little Boss definitely would not be able to keep working here. It was a skill-based job. Someone without experience could not satisfy the customers.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot bad, not bad at all. This first experience was really exceptional,\u201d said Lin Fan with a smile. Thinking about the customers he had met today, they had all gone through tremendous changes under the power of the Encyclopedia\u2019s mystical boost.</p><br/><p>This gave Lin Fan a deeper understanding of the godly back-scrubbing skill.</p><br/><p>The technique wasn\u2019t the only thing. It was opening up people\u2019s hearts that was the truly important part.</p><br/><p>But was that the only use of this godly back-scrubbing skill?</p><br/><p>At the moment, Lin Fan still didn\u2019t know. After all, the number of test subjects were too few. More importantly, the number of guests were too few and he couldn\u2019t perform enough tests.</p><br/><p>The next day!</p><br/><p>Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>Elder Zhang cried out in surprise, \u201cLittle Boss, I heard that you went to Elder Zeng\u2019s bathhouse to do back-scrubbing work. Is that true?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled, \u201cOf course it\u2019s true. This is called experiencing life, experiencing all sorts of occupations. Even if I I go into the sewers someday, don\u2019t be surprised. Because I am experiencing life.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha,\u201d Elder Zhang laughed, \u201cLittle Boss really knows how to joke.\u201d</p><br/><p>Of course, Lin Fan wasn\u2019t joking. If his luck really fell even lower, he might really obtain godly sewer knowledge. That would really be too f*cked up. But that was just a thought, how could something like that possibly happen?</p><br/><p>In the shop.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian looked strangely at Lin Fan, \u201cYou really went?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded, \u201cYeah. What is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian shook his head, \u201cBrilliant. I really can\u2019t see through you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan was extremely shocked as well. She felt that it didn\u2019t make any sense. She couldn\u2019t understand why Brother Lin would do back-scrubbing work all of a sudden. Even if she wrecked her brain thinking, she still wouldn\u2019t understand it.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said cheerily, \u201cIf you could see through me, that would really be something. I shan\u2019t talk anymore, I\u2019m going to Nanshan Children\u2019s Welfare Institute. You guys look after the shop.</p><br/><p>The tenth page\u2019s task had been completed and his focus had shifted to the Welfare Institute.</p><br/><p>This was a long-term project, not a short-term one.</p><br/><p>He had been gone for twenty days and he wondered if those children missed him. He thought that they probably did.</p><br/><p>He started the car and headed towards the Welfare Institute.</p><br/><p>At the entrance.</p><br/><p>\u201cUncle Lin is here\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, his arrival was discovered by Lil\u2019 Fatty. Lil Fatty immediately cried out in joy. Nowadays, their life at the Welfare Institute was happy and they would play around together every day, completely free of worries.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled, \u201cCome here, Lil\u2019 Fatty.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lil\u2019 Fatty looked at Lin Fan, then raised his head as he approached Lin Fan. He said softly, \u201cUncle Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHave you been eating greedily again lately? I see that you\u2019ve grown even fatter than the last time I saw you. Your face is round and becoming like a soccer ball soon,\u201d Lin Fan said with a smile.</p><br/><p>Lil\u2019 Fatty shook his head, \u201cNo, I haven\u2019t been eating greedily. It was Uncle Han who told me to eat. He said that if I become fatter, I would be cuter.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan got off his car. This Han Lu really was playful. \u201cHow has your drawing been lately? Have you kept persevering?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lil\u2019 Fatty nodded, \u201cI have. Director and Uncle Han have kept on guiding us to draw.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded, \u201cAlright, go on. Don\u2019t keep eating greedily. When you grow up, you won\u2019t be able to find a girlfriend like that. You\u2019ll regret it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Lin Fan went to the office to look for Director Huang. Because it was under the care of Lin Fan, the Children\u2019s Welfare Institute occasionally received some gifts from some entrepreneurs.</p><br/><p>\u201cDirector Huang, have there been any difficulties lately?\u201d asked Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Director Huang nodded, \u201cThere have indeed been some troublesome matters lately. The last time I suggested that, because the children are gradually growing up, they should receive education but you know of our Welfare Institute\u2019s situation. We don\u2019t have enough capital to run a school. That\u2019s why I want to get the government\u2019s support to donate money to us so that the children can receive education.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan thought for a moment, then said, \u201cI know about this problem. I\u2019m also thinking about the full situation. As of now, outside schools cannot possibly take in so many children. Moreover, if they are too scattered, we cannot account for all the children\u2019s safety. That\u2019s why inviting teachers to the Welfare Institute and carrying out lessons within the Welfare Institute is the only option. As for the capital, we don\u2019t need to ask for support. For the Children\u2019s Welfare Institute to keep on surviving, we have to have our own ways.\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Huang nodded, \u201cBut we only have children here. Relying on ourselves is easier said than done.\u201d</p><br/><p>For them to obtain the money to invite teachers over was not a problem to Lin Fan. If he said the word to Wang Ming Yang and the rest, he would definitely receive a large sum of money.</p><br/><p>But one has to rely on oneself. Especially in this regard, they couldn\u2019t keep requesting help from others. Right now, the facilities that the children were playing in as well as their clothes were all given to them by others. Even if Lin Fan\u2019s skin was even thicker, he couldn\u2019t ask for more.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet me think about it. Leave this matter to me,\u201d said Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Director Huang nodded. She had always placed this Children\u2019s Welfare Institute as her number one priority. Every child here, to her, was like her own. She dedicated her life to this place.</p></div>\n</div>"}

I am now convinced. \u201cI never thought that this kid who always took Zhao Ming Qing\u2019s side was right all this while. The old man must be really powerful to even be able to tackle such an illness.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed. \u201cStop spouting nonsense. I am the teacher of the old man. What is there that I cannot figure out?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, alright, stop bragging. I think it is time we get this door changed, it\u2019s been pounded with eggs.\u201d Fraud Tian did not believe it. There was no way Lin Fan was Zhao Ming Qing\u2019s teacher. As long as his mind was a little normal, he would never believe what Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>However, Lin Fan was indifferent to what Fraud Tian felt. Whether he believed it or not, it didn\u2019t matter. It was just a matter of time that they would find out for themselves.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that so?\u201d Lin Fan looked up. \u201cForget about it for the time being. Let\u2019s wait for the chaos to die down first.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian was surprised. \u201cWhat? Is there more to this episode?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan grinned mysteriously. There was much more.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh right, Wang Ming Yang came earlier and then hurriedly left. Do you guys have something going on that I should know about? I feel that he really pays attention to the things going on around you,\u201d Fraud Tian asked curiously.</p><br/><p>Lin grinned to himself and then stared at Fraud Tian\u2019s a<em>s. Fraud Tian immediately covered his a</em>s before snapping, \u201cForget I said anything. You are a freaking pervert.\u201d</p><br/><p><em>woof woof</em></p><br/><p>Elder Dog Nicholas was growing fatter by the day, becoming lazier by the day. If he wasn\u2019t sleeping, he would be \u2018planting seeds\u2019. However, despite his multiple attempts, he never succeeded.</p><br/><p>The next day!</p><br/><p>The Internet was buzzing that day.</p><br/><p>This was because the relevant departments had found out that about the viral video and its malicious intent. The police then began to screen through all the videos with rumors. They also identified three of the culprits who were responsible for the rumors. One of them was the main culprit who had distorted the truth. When they forcefully entered his residence, he was scared silly.</p><br/><p>That was when he realized he had messed up.</p><br/><p>This incident was not entertainment news nor did it involve a fallen idol. It was instead regarding Chinese Medicine and it wouldn\u2019t have drawn much attention. But this time, it was different. All the other news made way for it. All those celebrities who were promoting themselves and buying headlines were all notified.</p><br/><p>Weibo headlines</p><br/><p>Today\u2019s headlines.</p><br/><p>Media news.</p><br/><p>Internet news.</p><br/><p>Etc.</p><br/><p>All in all, there were over ten platforms, releasing about a hundred headlines. They were all about the previous day\u2019s incident.</p><br/><p>\u2018An old Chinese doctor overcame stress to help the patient overcome anorexia.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018The highest occurrence of anorexia in modern times. Fear not! Shanghai\u2019s Chinese Medical Academy Director Zhao Ming Qing tackles it.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Internet violence almost killed a virtuous and skilled old Chinese doctor.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Countless netizens have been slapped in the face. Was it violence out of goodwill or was it out of evil will?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018The Internet needs to be purified to eliminate all cyber-violence.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Chinese Medical Association issued a statement indicating full support of Zhao Ming Qing\u2019s work.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Where was the Chinese Medical Association when Zhao Ming Qing was doubted and mocked?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The news appeared one after another and took over the homepage of major websites.</p><br/><p>Among them, UC Breaking News Department continuously posted numerous articles.</p><br/><p>\u2018Breaking! Chinese medicine which has been circulating for thousands of years is so powerful\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Super breaking! A well-known professor of Western medicine has spoken. Chinese medicine is so mystical. Chinese medicine is indeed amazing.\u2019</p><br/><p>Train station.</p><br/><p>Wang Hua, an ordinary office worker, took a look at his phone on the train. He was now part of a WeChat group in which there were hundreds of people. A video caught his eye. Upon opening the video, he realized that it was the video from the day before, the one creating rumors. It was coupled with heart-wrenching music which succeeded in angering Wang Hua.</p><br/><p>He had always had a deep trust in Chinese medicine practitioners. However, he usually consulted Western medicine practitioners. After all, Western medicine was more secure.</p><br/><p>\u201cSigh, Chinese medicine has really fallen. Even an old Chinese doctor would do something like this. How would the next generation of students be able to learn any real knowledge?</p><br/><p>Wang Hua couldn\u2019t hold his anger in any longer and commented \u2018F*ck\u2019 to express his displeasure before opening other pages to read the news.</p><br/><p>But when he saw the headlines, his expression changed gradually. This headline was a little strange. He opened the article.</p><br/><p>After reading the news, he was extremely pissed. He immediately returned to the group to scold the man who had sent the video</p><br/><p>\u201cThose who create rumors should go and kill themselves\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>On various forums and threads, countless netizens joined in the discussion.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck. The news was trending all day yesterday. It angered so many people that there were instances whereby those who had been offended went to the extent of finding out the cell phone numbers of the instigators to give them a dressing down. I never thought the situation would turn around so quickly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs Chinese medicine really that powerful? Did it really cure anorexia?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI doubt this is a piece of fake news. The Chinese Medical Association even sent out an official congratulatory statement to the doctor. If it really is fake, then they are in deep trouble this time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c666\u2026this is really shocking. I never cared about Chinese medicine at all. I never thought that I would see this kind of news.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have always been concerned about this matter., At that time, there was only one person who believed in Doctor Zhao \u2013 Master Lin. However, Lin Fan\u2019s support did not come without criticism. He was heavily berated and criticised online. Now that the truth has come to light, he has taken to social media websites to vent his anger. Up till now, none of those who doubted him and scolded him has dared to reply to his scoldings.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, if it was me, I wouldn\u2019t take his scolding even if he was right. So what if he proved me wrong? What is there to be proud of?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou do not understand, Master Lin\u2019s fans are all f*cked up. This isn\u2019t the first time such a thing has happened. Most of Master Lin\u2019s fans are brainless. If you go against Lin Fan they will flame you for it. However, if you go along and agree with Lin Fan, they\u2019ll let you curse at them for no rhyme or reason without retaliating and even take the initiative to admit their mistakes. One of the netizens called \u2018Meng Meng\u2019 was scolded more than a hundred times by Master Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c666, someone should really make it a crime to have fans like them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMay Chinese medicine rise and prosper.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOk, although it might gain some recognition, it probably would not be able to change the fact that people have more faith in Western medicine.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan arrived at the shop, a group of young people had gathered at the doorway and were holding a ladder. They held bottles of cleaning liquid and brushes and they climbed up to clean the entrance sign.</p><br/><p>The surrounding shop owners came and gathered to see what the commotion was about.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, you guys, look at these guys washing Master Lin\u2019s house. It appears that they were the ones who smashed it with eggs.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is going on? Little Boss always does things very reasonably.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSigh, these blind people. They believe news on the Internet way too easily.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle boss\u2026\u201d Shop owners came to say hello to Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded with a smile and looked towards those young people. \u201cWhat are you doing?</p><br/><p>One of the young people said in shame, \u201cMaster Lin, I\u2019m sorry, we did it on impulse.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou were the guys who smashed my door with eggs?\u201d Lin Fan asked.</p><br/><p>All embarrassed, they nodded and replied, \u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was not about to hold any grudges and calmly advised, \u201cMake sure you guys clean the door thoroughly. Next time, think before you act. Do not believe what others say easily. I hope you guys know the consequence of doing so. I\u2019m sure it must feel bad.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt hurts.\u201d The guy nodded in embarrassment. \u201cIt felt so satisfying smashing the door with eggs the other day. I felt like Superman, upholding justice for others. However, today I feel like a fool. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><br/><p>Despite their mistakes, they were commendable for their courage to own up to their mistakes.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded his head. \u201cWell, wipe it clean. As long as the doors are cleaned I shall forgive you guys since you are young and do not fully understand the danger of the Internet yet.\u201d</p><br/><p>When giving advice his tone was lamentable.</p><br/><p>But he himself was quite young. Saying this seemed a little weird.</p><br/><p>But what else could they have said at that time?</p><br/><p>If they had the courage to commit such an atrocious act, they better have the courage to own up to it.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

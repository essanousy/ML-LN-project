However, the pills that he concocted did have that type of result, so he felt like it should be possible. Then he nodded and said, \u201cYep, believe me, it should be possible. Do you know where my store is?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know, I know,\u201d Jin Shan Ping immediately nodded. She was clearly very excited and felt like good luck had fallen on her head.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good. Come over tomorrow afternoon and I\u2019ll help you take a look,\u201d Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>Jin Shan Ping did not know what to say. Maybe she had her doubts about this situation, but she had complete trust in Master Lin.</p><br/><p>In his many identities, one of them was the Godly Doctor.</p><br/><p>The amount of trust she had in Lin Fan had reached a very high level.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-2\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>The problems at Jin He University had been resolved. Originally, to others, they would not care about this issue too much as it did not happen to them. However, to Lin Fan, he had to uphold justice since he had gotten involved.</p><br/><p>He did not want to be asked why he was such a busybody.</p><br/><p><em>I like to be a busybody. If you can\u2019t take it, come and whack me.</em></p><br/><p>The residents who had previously come here to help felt very satisfied with the outcome. They also thought that this director was not bad.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at everyone and said, \u201cThank you, everyone, for coming to assist us. In the face of such unfair circumstances, we can\u2019t just sit back and watch but we also cannot add fuel to the fire. This time, everyone dropped what they were doing to come and help, I\u2019m really grateful.\u201d</p><br/><p>The residents who had come earlier to help could not help laughing.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, there\u2019s something wrong with you saying this. Also, there\u2019s no need for to thank us. This sort of situation was very unbearable for all of us.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. I feel like ever since I started paying attention to Master Lin, I feel like I\u2019ve become more righteous as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, me too. I realized that I\u2019ve started to like butting into other people\u2019s business. When I see something that isn\u2019t right, I\u2019ll go up and say something. The previous time, I almost got beaten by someone.\u201d</p><br/><p>To them, this was the perfect ending to this issue and they felt elated inside. Although they did not help much, but at least they got involved in it.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-3\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Lin Fan was also feeling very grateful. It seemed like he had started something very good with all these residents feeling the magical power of righteousness.</p><br/><p>After today, they will walk down the road of righteousness, bravely advancing forward and never falling back.</p><br/><p>\u201cDirector Chen, I shan\u2019t disturb you any further,\u201d Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>Director Chen nodded and replied, \u201cMaster Lin, regarding this issue, I\u2019ll conduct a very strict investigation and giving a stern talk to all those people involved in it.\u201d</p><br/><p>This issue had already blown up to something pretty big and you could even say that it had become a stain.</p><br/><p>Being the director of the school, he could not just sit back and not care about this.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll make a move first,\u201d Lin Fan smiled and said. Then he prepared to leave.</p><br/><p>However, when Lin Fan was preparing to leave the school grounds, the students, who were already completely confused, one by one cried and begged.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, I beg you, please help us talk to the director. We were in the wrong.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t drop out of this school. If my parents find out about this, they will give me a very gruesome death.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBoo Hoo. I really regret this. How did I end up joining a demonstration?\u201d</p><br/><p>The people who were originally hooting and calling themselves awesome were now all extremely afraid.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-4\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>When the situation had not occurred yet, they were arrogant bullies, driving people into the wall. However, now something that they did not think would happen happened to them.</p><br/><p>Expulsion!</p><br/><p>This would definitely lead to something major.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at these students and laughed.</p><br/><p><em>You guys still want me to plead </em>for <em>you all? You guys must be dreaming.</em></p><br/><p>Then, he ignored them and left the area.</p><br/><p>He did not care about what the students said. When they were forcing someone into the wall, they were so excited. However, now that the tables have turned, they finally know how it feels.</p><br/><p>As far as helping them plea, he would only do so if he was possessed by the Virgin Mary.</p><br/><p>Of course, was something like that possible?</p><br/><p>It definitely was not.</p><br/><p>When he reached the gate of the school.</p><br/><p>The security guard saw Master Lin leaving and he immediately raised his thumb, indicating that he did well.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at him and smiled. He raised his thumb as well, indicating to him that he did well.</p><br/><p>He did not merely just let him in, he let all the other residents in as well. His security guard really had a righteous heart.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-5\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>But right now, even if he wanted to leave the school, it would not be so easy.</p><br/><p>The outside had been filled with reporters a long time ago.</p><br/><p>The security guard had stopped all the reporters outside and did not let them in. He did not want the school to be affected too much.</p><br/><p>Although he was a security guard, he knew the way reporters were and how they would recklessly report the news. It would lead to situations where simple explanations would not solve.</p><br/><p>The reporters had been waiting outside for a long time. When they heard that Master Lin was coming to the school, they could not wait and rushed right over.</p><br/><p>They wanted to come to the front line and get the news in order to get the latest reports.</p><br/><p>However, this security guard did not let them into the school, making them extremely anxious.</p><br/><p>Then, the reporters all cried out in shock.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin is coming out.\u201d</p><br/><p>All of the reporters gaze shifted onto Lin Fan. The main man had arrived. Although they did not know how the situation had developed, if they could get a hold of Master Lin, it would definitely be good enough.</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan saw so many reporters, he helplessly sighed. Even if he wanted to leave, he was not going to be able to.</p><br/><p>He would be dreaming if he thought he would be able to leave without satisfying these reporters.</p><br/><p>Even if he were to run away from them here, he would not be safe back at Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>Just when Lin Fan was still deep in thought, the reporters had already gathered around with all their microphones and handphones out and ready.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, how is the situation inside now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat has happened to that female student who had her face destroyed by a fire?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, did you talk to the students? Also, how did the school handle the situation?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, what is your relationship with that female student? Why did you have to stand up for her?\u201d</p><br/><p>One by one, they asked the questions as if they were free. This made Lin Fan feel very helpless. There were too many questions being asked and he could not answer any.</p><br/><p>Then he waved his hand and said, \u201cEveryone please quieten down a little. You guys are asking so many questions, how do you expect me to answer them? Let me answer them one by one, okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan did not really have much of a choice. In the face of this questioning by the reporters, he had to say something. If he just let the reporters recklessly guess, who knows what would happen.</p><br/><p>\u201cFor the first question, the problem was perfectly dealt with. This was the work of a few figures in Jin He University. Director Chen had just come back from doing work overseas and when he found out about this issue, was very angry. He removed all the people involved in this from their positions on the spot and is conducting an investigation.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAs far as the student Jin Shan Ping goes, she can continue to stay in the school. Also, for the problem with her face, I\u2019ll deal with it tomorrow,\u201d At this moment, Lin Fan still had to make a statement. After all, he needed to show off.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs for the other questions, I\u2019ll just give a simple explanation. I don\u2019t have any relations with this girl. I came to Jin He University because I like to stick my nose in other people\u2019s business. Also, the residents behind me are like me as well, seeing something that they weren\u2019t happy with and coming over to put pressure on the school.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to say this here \u2013 Jin He University is not bad, especially that director of theirs. He is an educator who to deserves to be where he is. I\u2019m very happy that Jin He University has a director like him. I\u2019m here to make a bit of an advertisement. If there are any students out there having problems deciding on which university to go to, come to Jin He University, I guarantee that you won\u2019t regret it.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, Lin Fan had started doing some mutual business promotion.</p><br/><p>The director was a decent person so there was nothing wrong with promoting him.</p></div>\n</div>"}

The installations inside were very simple but at that moment, Lin Fan was standing on the rostrum, teaching the children Chinese art.</p><br/><p>Teaching adults is easy but teaching children is difficult. It requires a slow and gradual progression and everything must be done step-by-step.</p><br/><p>\u201cUncle Lin, I\u2019ve finished my drawing,\u201d said a girl with double ponytails. She jumped up and down while holding her painting in front of Lin Fan. Then, she looked hopefully at Uncle Lin as if she wanted to receive praise.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the painting and stroked his chin. For a moment, he couldn\u2019t quite understand the painting but of course, he couldn\u2019t say that to the child. Then, he asked, \u201cLil\u2019 Yuan Yuan, what are you drawing here?\u201d</p><br/><p>The little girl had smooth cheeks and big eyes. When she had been rescued from the human traffickers, her face had been yellowish and extremely skinny. But after being taken care of in the Children\u2019s Welfare Institute, she had recovered her health. She was a very cute little girl.</p><br/><p>The Lil\u2019 Yuan Yuan pointed to some black dots on the drawing and said, \u201cThose are stars. This is a tree. This the grass\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan still couldn\u2019t understand it. It wasn\u2019t that he was bad at understanding drawings but in her drawing, the grass was taller than the tree. That didn\u2019t make any sense. \u201cLil\u2019 Yuan Yuan, why is the grass taller than the tree? Grass is supposed to be short.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUncle Lin, the little tree hasn\u2019t grown up yet. Then grass has grown up, of course it\u2019s taller than the tree,\u201d Lil\u2019 Yuan Yuan said.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is this dark, big, round dot?\u201d Lin Fan didn\u2019t get it. He wasn\u2019t trying to be humble but he really couldn\u2019t understand it.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is a rock. A very very big rock.\u201d Lil\u2019 Yuan Yuan extended her arms to emphasize the size of the rock. It was really a very very big rock.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded, \u201cNot bad, not bad. You drew really well. You have the style of an abstract expert.\u201d</p><br/><p>When she received this compliment, Lil\u2019 Yuan Yuan smiled delightedly, then returned to her seat to continue on her abstract art piece.</p><br/><p>The other children saw that Lil\u2019 Yuan Yuan had been praised and were all eager to show their own paintings. They all brought their artworks forward for Uncle Lin to see.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan maintained his temper. He could say that out of ten drawings, he could barely understand five of them. He had no idea how children saw things in their minds. Why was it that when they represented those things on drawings, they all looked extremely weird?</p><br/><p>Something that was clearly a tree was said to be a man by the children.</p><br/><p>Abstract. It was really too abstract.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey.\u201d Suddenly, Lin Fan became silent as he thought of something.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have an idea.\u201d Lin Fan smiled, then said to Han Lu, \u201cTake care of the children for a moment. I\u2019m going out for a while.\u201d</p><br/><p>Outside.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan gave a call to Zheng Zhong Shan. The call was answered.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Lin, a few days ago, we went to Shanghai to look for you but you weren\u2019t around. It was only afterwards that we found out that you went to volunteer as a doctor. Why is it that everytime I call you, your number is not available?\u201d said Elder Zheng.</p><br/><p>They had just reached Shanghai when Lin Fan had left. And the reason they came to Shanghai was to thank Lin Fan but who would have known that he wouldn\u2019t be around.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan blushed. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Elder Zheng, I didn\u2019t notice. But let\u2019s not talk about this for now. I want to ask you for a favor.\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Zheng smiled, \u201cTell me, what is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou know about WeChat, right? You see, I don\u2019t know anyone from there. You have connections in Beijing. Could you give me an introduction? I want to get some help from the people at WeChat,\u201d said Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Elder Zheng didn\u2019t know what Elder Lin wanted but he said, \u201cWeChat, eh? I don\u2019t know about that. Wait a moment, my son is around right now. I\u2019ll let him speak to you. He\u2019s a young man and he knows things like these. Even if you tell me all this, I wouldn\u2019t know. But don\u2019t worry. Whether he knows them or not, as long as that person is in Beijing, he\u2019ll take care of it for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled, \u201cThank you, Elder Zheng.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s there to thank me for? We should be thanking you. You\u2019re our family\u2019s savior,\u201d said Elder Zheng. \u201cAlright, I\u2019ll pass my phone to my son. Ask him. You can just call him Lil\u2019 Zheng.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zheng Hai Feng was very grateful towards this Master Lin. His son, Lil\u2019 Bao, was only able to recover his health thanks to Master Lin. When he received the phone, he said gratefully.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, I\u2019m Zheng Hai Feng. About that matter involving my son, my wife and I thank you on behalf of him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said with a smile, \u201cNo need to be courteous. Lil\u2019 Zheng, I want to ask you if you know the person-in-charge of WeChat. I want to ask him for a favor.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zheng Hai Feng said, \u201cI don\u2019t know him. But is he in Beijing?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cI just checked on the Internet. He is indeed in Beijing. His name is Zhang Long.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen it\u2019ll be easy. Master Lin, wait half an hour for me. In half an hour, I\u2019ll call you back. I\u2019m going to get someone to invite him over,\u201d said Zheng Hai Feng. As long as someone was in Beijing, it didn\u2019t matter who it was, Zheng Hai Feng could invite him over. He didn\u2019t even ask Master Lin what he wanted.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan blushed a little. That was a little too much, wasn\u2019t it? Inviting someone over so simply.</p><br/><p>At a certain technological company in Beijing.</p><br/><p>This was the place that was responsible for WeChat\u2019s operations and it was a large company with WeChat under its banner. At that moment, WeChat\u2019s person-in-charge, Zhang Long was in the middle of a meeting, discussing the development plans for WeChat.</p><br/><p>Then, his secretary came. She had a slight look of astonishment on her face.</p><br/><p>Zhang Long raised an eyebrow, \u201cWe\u2019re having a meeting. Why did you come in?\u201d</p><br/><p>The secretary said, \u201cChief Zhang, someone is downstairs looking for you. They need you to go out for a while.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Long frowned, \u201cCan\u2019t you see that we\u2019re having a meeting? If there\u2019s anything, wait till the meeting is over before telling me. Get out.\u201d</p><br/><p>The secretary shook her head, \u201cNo, Chief Zhang, it\u2019s the military looking for you. They want you to go down now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Long was startled. Why was the military looking for him? He was just a communications software developer. He wasn\u2019t some weapons researcher. What did they want from him?</p><br/><p>But without thinking too much, he nodded and put the meeting on hold. Then, he left the place.</p><br/><p>Downstairs.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy fellow comrades, what do you need?\u201d asked Zhang Long curiously.</p><br/><p>\u201cNice to meet you, Mister Zhang. We\u2019ve been told by a senior official to invite you to come with us. These are our IDs. You can check them if you want,\u201d said the soldiers.</p><br/><p>Zhang Long looked closely, then asked someone to check the IDs for him. They were indeed real. But Zhang Long was becoming more and more puzzled. What the heck was going on?</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t seem to know any military people, nor had he interacted with any. However, he would find out if he went with them.</p><br/><p>He wasn\u2019t afraid of following the military but he was afraid that these people might be scammers. After all, kidnapping cases were common. Now that he had confirmed their identities, there was no need to worry.</p><br/><p>In the car.</p><br/><p>Zhang Long looked at his surroundings, then asked curiously, \u201cMy comrades, I wonder what your senior official is finding me for?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know about that. We were just ordered to come and bring you there,\u201d said one of the soldiers.</p><br/><p>Zhang Long was a little restless. He realized that he had reached a place with rather high security. It was a place that normal people wouldn\u2019t be able to enter.</p><br/><p>On the way there, he kept thinking if he knew anyone in the military. Otherwise, why would something like this happen?</p><br/><p>At the entrance.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease enter.\u201d The man guarding the entrance opened it.</p><br/><p>Zhang Long nodded, then went in.</p><br/><p>When Zheng Hai Feng saw him, he instantly smiled. \u201cYou must be the person-in-charge of WeChat, Zhang Long.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI am. You are\u2026?\u201d Zhao Long looked at Zheng Hai Feng with a puzzled expression. He didn\u2019t know this man. Then, he looked around his surroundings. When he saw Zheng Zhong Shan, his expression changed drastically.</p><br/><p>Zhang Long was in charge of WeChat. In the past, all the WeChat promotions or news published were all overseen by him. When he saw that old man by the side, his heart started thumping furiously.</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t this\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, Zhang Long was dumbfounded. This old man was frequently on their WeChat news. He was a major figure!</p><br/><p>What had Zhang Long committed to be called over here?</p><br/><p>At that moment, Zhang Long didn\u2019t dare to take a single breath. He asked weakly, \u201cDid I do something wrong?\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

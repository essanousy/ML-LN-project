However, when they saw the silhouette at the entrance of the shop, they suddenly felt like the world had become a better place.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, Little Boss is back.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? He\u2019s back! D*mn, I\u2019ve died waiting for the past few days.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cQuickly queue up. Looks like we definitely will be able to get the scallion pancakes today.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBuy my a*s. There are so many of us. If we want to get it, how long do we have to wait?\u201d</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan saw the anxious looks of the townsfolk, he wanted to confront them and find out who scolded him. However, he had given up on that. They were behaving themselves and how could he confront them?</p><br/><p>It looked like he could only forgive them for that.</p><br/><p>However, he had to make it up to the townsfolk.</p><br/><p>\u201cTo all righteous townsfolk, I went to settle something great during my absence in the past few days. You should know about it after seeing the news, right?\u201d Lin Fan shouted.</p><br/><p>The townsfolk said, \u201cWe know. Little Boss, we admire you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved his hand calmly, \u201cNo, you don\u2019t have to admire me. I just wanted you to understand that I didn\u2019t disappear for nothing. The next time I disappear, it would mean that something great had happened again. Alright, that\u2019s enough talking. Let\u2019s sell scallion pancakes. Everyone, please queue up for today\u2019s ten scallion pancakes.\u201d</p><br/><p>A townsfolk shouted, \u201cMaster Lin, you\u2019ve been gone for so many days. Can you make more scallion pancakes?\u201d</p><br/><p>The other townsfolk felt that it was a reasonable request to make more scallion pancakes to make up for his absence.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan coughed gently, \u201cI\u2019m afraid that\u2019s not possible. Let me tell you this. Actually, my journey to the northeastern region caused me to be seriously injured. However, I dragged myself here to sell scallion pancakes in order to not disappoint all of you. I just didn\u2019t want the townsfolk to be disappointed. However, if you really want to request for that, I would have to accept it even if I were to vomit blood.\u201d</p><br/><p>He acted really well. He didn\u2019t believe that the townsfolk didn\u2019t love him at all.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian and the others just stared at Lin Fan, they knew that he was acting. God d*mn it, did he really have to act?</p><br/><p>However, what happened next was something that Lin Fan didn\u2019t understand.</p><br/><p>The townsfolk shouted, \u201cLittle Boss, you can do it! We\u2019ve called the ambulance for you. If you were to vomit blood, we\u2019ll send you to the hospital right away. We won\u2019t let you be in any danger.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, I know first aid. I can save you in time.\u201d</p><br/><p>F*cking hell!</p><br/><p>Lin Fan felt like the world had run out of love. Then, he waved his hand, \u201cAlright, let\u2019s just sell scallion pancakes and not talk about that. Fraud Tian, give out the number tags.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian laughed internally. This fella really thought that the townsfolk were as stupid as before.</p><br/><p>They were really witty now and they weren\u2019t stupid at all.</p><br/><p>After preparing the scallion pancakes, Lin Fan just rested.</p><br/><p>The task wasn\u2019t even completed yet. He thought that he could go to the northeastern region to try his luck but it didn\u2019t have any effect. It was really a waste.</p><br/><p>However, he wasn\u2019t anxious. Anyway, the task didn\u2019t have a deadline. He just had to take small steps and perhaps he would be lucky enough one day to clear it. That would feel really great.</p><br/><p>*Ding Ding*</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang called.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Lin Fan asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat else? I just wanted you to know that Chen Chang Sheng has a feast tonight and he invited you,\u201d Wang Ming Yang said.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was a little helpless, \u201cThere\u2019s no need for that. It\u2019s just a small thing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang replied, \u201cIt may be a small thing to you. To Elder Chen, it\u2019s something really big. Don\u2019t be wishy-washy. Are you coming on your own tonight? Or shall I fetch you? It\u2019s at 7 pm.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan didn\u2019t know what to do. He was too popular with the people and he felt like it was a chore. \u201cI\u2019ll go myself. Tell me the location later.\u201d</p><br/><p>After hanging up.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian moved over sneakily, \u201cWhat is it? Is there another feast tonight?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled, \u201cOf course. Tonight\u2019s feast is different. It\u2019s going to be delicious and it\u2019s going to be really different from the past feasts.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Fraud Tian heard that, he got anxious, \u201cBring me, please.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d Lin Fan looked at Fraud Tian with a strange look. It was clear that he was telling him to stop dreaming.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian sighed, \u201cSigh, we started out as poor people in the past and we helped each other. However, you\u2019ve abandoned me today. It\u2019s okay, that\u2019s just life.\u201d</p><br/><p>After saying that, he looked really sad.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, alright. There\u2019ll be opportunities in the future. Don\u2019t speak of me like I\u2019m a douchebag.\u201d He couldn\u2019t tolerate Fraud Tian\u2019s \u2018sad look\u2019.</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang smiled, \u201cFraud, I think you should follow me to eat in the open-air restaurant. I will introduce some girls to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>After hearing that there were girls, Fraud Tian immediately clung to Zhao Zhong Yang, \u201cBrother Yang, how is it going to be like?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang looked at Fraud Tian, \u201cWho is going to be paying for the meal tonight?\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian immediately patted his chest, \u201cOf course it\u2019s me. How can I let my big brother pay?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang nodded happily. \u201cThat\u2019s right. I asked a few girls out for dinner tonight. As for whether you\u2019d still be single, it depends on you. However, don\u2019t forget to pay for the meal.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the two of them and shook his head helplessly.</p><br/><p>At night!</p><br/><p>The most luxurious hotel in Shanghai required advanced booking. Also, they had to apply for an $80,000 membership card. Although $80,000 wasn\u2019t a lot of money, the fact that one had to pay $80,000 to get a membership card before qualifying for a meal was stupid to many typical men.</p><br/><p>To the wealthy people, this was like a symbol of status.</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan reached the destination, he saw that Chen Chang Sheng was waiting at the entrance.</p><br/><p>\u201cChief Chen,\u201d Lin Fan waved and shouted.</p><br/><p>Chen Chang Sheng looked at Lin Fan and went forward passionately. He shook Lin Fan\u2019s hand, \u201cMaster Lin, you\u2019re here. Please, come in.\u201d</p><br/><p>On the way to the restaurant, Lin Fan smiled, \u201cChief Chen, there\u2019s really no need for this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Chang Sheng shook his head, \u201cThere\u2019s a need for this! Master Lin helped me to resolve my biggest worry. You are my savior.\u201d</p><br/><p>He felt that Master Lin was the reason why the northeastern incident could be resolved so quickly. If not, he wouldn\u2019t have found out about it.</p><br/><p>Perhaps he wouldn\u2019t be able to handle the outcome of the entire situation.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shook his head and didn\u2019t say anything else.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t go there because of Chen Chang Sheng. It was because Godfather Liu was too much. He didn\u2019t even respect Lin Fan at all.</p><br/><p>Now that they were all doomed, he didn\u2019t have any regrets at all.</p><br/><p>They went into the private room.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang, He Cheng Han, Jin Yun Ming and the others had been waiting. When they saw Lin Fan, all of them smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, we\u2019ve been waiting for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe came here earlier to wait for Master Lin as a form of respect for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>After hearing their banter, Lin Fan laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, stop praising me. Chief Chen didn\u2019t have to organize this at all. Didn\u2019t you guys tell him about it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Many people felt that Chen Chang Sheng was just lucky. However, they were still really happy about it.</p><br/><p>It showed that Master Lin still cared about them.</p><br/><p>Of course, that was their way of thinking.</p></div>\n</div>"}

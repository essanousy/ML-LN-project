However, he didn\u2019t know what other effects it would have as the Encyclopedia didn\u2019t mention anything. He would only find out about it after he created one.</p><br/><p>He looked through the Encyclopedia.</p><br/><p>He needed a lot of ingredients to make the Little intelligence pill and they were complicated. However, Lin Fan knew that he had to keep practicing it. However, the ingredients didn\u2019t seem to be accessible in the modern society.</p><br/><p>Then, Lin Fan started to become doubtful.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan wasn\u2019t tired anymore after such an event. He wanted to go to Cloud Street and study it.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, the reward for completing the task was so good. It would open up the departmental store of the Encyclopedia. What was that about? It sounded a little unbelievable.</p><br/><p>He was full of anticipation.</p><br/><p>This was the day he had been anticipating ever since he got the Encyclopedia.</p><br/><p>In the bathroom!</p><br/><p>The water was flowing endlessly.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was humming a song happily. He was feeling so happy but he couldn\u2019t find anyone to share his happiness with.</p><br/><p>*sizzle*</p><br/><p>Hmm?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat was that?\u201d Lin Fan was rubbing himself down and he suddenly realized that there was ink on his arms.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s weird. What\u2019s happening? I don\u2019t think I\u2019m so dirty, right? Why is the water black?\u201d He didn\u2019t understand what was happening. He looked at the tap and realized that there wasn\u2019t any dirty water. Where did this come from?</p><br/><p>He was a little too excited and he used his back scrubbing &amp; cleaning knowledge.</p><br/><p>Wait!</p><br/><p>Then, Lin Fan seemed to have figured something out. However, he didn\u2019t dare to confirm it. If it was true, it would be unbelievable.</p><br/><p>The two knowledge classifications belonged to the lowest class of knowledge of all. If it was true, then it\u2019d be incredible.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan prepared to experiment it again. He began to rub the other arm.</p><br/><p>Indeed!</p><br/><p>The water became black again.</p><br/><p>Then, he used clear water to wash it off. He realized that the part which he just rubbed seemed whiter than the other areas.</p><br/><p>Then, he stopped using the cleaning knowledge.</p><br/><p>The water didn\u2019t turn black anymore.</p><br/><p>It was as if Lin Fan had discovered the New World. He was in disbelief. How could the two knowledge classifications produce such a different effect when combined?</p><br/><p>The back scrubbing knowledge could help to improve his mood and the cleaning knowledge could get rid of stains.</p><br/><p>When the two knowledge classifications were combined, what effect would it produce?</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was thinking about that. When he scrubbed his chest area, the water turned blacker than before. He felt that his body had been transformed and he felt happier.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs this the true essence of cleaning?\u201d Lin Fan was doubtful.</p><br/><p>In the afternoon!</p><br/><p>It was 2 in the afternoon.</p><br/><p>At Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan walked happily into the shop. Anyone would have seen that he was extremely happy.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, you seem a little weird today.\u201d Fraud Tian realized that Lin Fan looked a little weird.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian said, \u201cWhy do I feel like you\u2019re a changed man? You look invigorated. Does this skin even belong to you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was elated. \u201cWhat do you mean by that? If my skin wasn\u2019t mine, who else would it belong to? Tell me, what changes do you see?\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian shook his head. \u201cI can\u2019t put my hand on it. You Lan, come over and have a look. Does this man look different today? He looks like a changed man.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan was busy. \u201cWhat is it? What changes does Brother Lin have?\u201d When she looked at Lin Fan, Wu You Lan\u2019s face changed. Then, she walked towards Lin Fan and gasped, \u201cHey, he really looks different.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan stood there, \u201cTell me about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan looked at him closely. \u201cYour skin wasn\u2019t this good. Your pores are so small now and your skin seems whiter. There aren\u2019t any black spots anymore. Your hair is blacker too. This\u2026 This\u2026 Brother Lin, did you eat something magical? The changes are drastic.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. He knew that there were changes.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, these changes were visible.</p><br/><p>His superior medical skills allowed him to feel his own body\u2019s situation. Everyone\u2019s body had toxins and the artificial ingredients would accumulate in one\u2019s body. It naturally had negative effects on the human body. However, when he combined both the back scrubbing and cleaning knowledge classifications in the bathroom earlier, he realized that the toxins were removed.</p><br/><p>Every organ in the body seemed to be radiating and it was as if they hadn\u2019t been poisoned before.</p><br/><p>However, Lin Fan did a test and realized that it wasn\u2019t going to last forever. The toxins would slowly accumulate in his body again but he could remove them when they reached a certain level.</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t eat anything. I just scrubbed as usual and that\u2019s how it improved. You guys won\u2019t be able to learn it,\u201d Lin Fan smiled.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian came over, \u201cWhy not you help me to scrub too?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan rolled his eyes, \u201cGet lost. I\u2019d rather kill myself than scrub for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian was saddened, \u201cYou\u2019re discriminating against me\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan was doubtful of what he said. \u201cBrother Lin, did you not tell us about something? Why do you look so happy today?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha,\u201d Lin Fan smiled. \u201cYeah, I have a piece of good news but it\u2019s a secret.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou should share the good news. It\u2019s not good to keep it to yourself,\u201d Wu You Lan said.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shook his head and sat in his chair. \u201cIf I were to tell you, you guys wouldn\u2019t believe me. Therefore, I\u2019m not going to say it. Alright, carry on with work. I have to think about something.\u201d</p><br/><p>They were all curious about what had happened but they couldn\u2019t do anything to make him speak. Fraud Tian wanted to uncover his secrets and he kept observing Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>He took a pen and paper.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan sat there and wrote on the papers.</p><br/><p>The long living seed, morning egg, and baiziren\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2018The long living seed\u2019 was definitely a walnut.</p><br/><p>And the morning egg was the chicken egg.</p><br/><p>Some of the ingredients could be bought in a Chinese medical hall. However, he didn\u2019t understand the other ingredients.</p><br/><p>Fiery Mountain Flower.</p><br/><p>A Snowy Decade.</p><br/><p>Xingmunao.</p><br/><p>And others\u2026</p><br/><p>It was getting out of hand. The names were weird and he couldn\u2019t find anything related to them. It looked like it was going to be difficult to find these ingredients.</p><br/><p>The medical ingredients were difficult to determine. However, Lin Fan wasn\u2019t going to give up so easily. Even if he couldn\u2019t find the exact ingredient, he would use another one to replace it.</p><br/><p>Although it might cause different effects, as long as the medical ingredients had similar effects, it wouldn\u2019t differ too much.</p><br/><p>He was planning to head to a Chinese medical hall later to look for ingredients that could replace some of them.</p><br/><p>If he could really create the Little Intelligence pill, how should he use it?</p><br/><p>He needed to think about it carefully.</p><br/><p>It was a crazy but happy thought.</p><br/><p>Then, a voice came from outside.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Boss, scallion pancakes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was stunned. Unknowingly, the townsfolk had gathered outside his shop. He had escaped the morning crowd but he couldn\u2019t avoid the afternoon one.</p><br/><p>He had no other choice.</p></div>\n</div>"}

It\u2019s just that I never thought that even a reseller would give us tickets.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cThey\u2019ve earned a lot from reselling scallion pancakes at Cloud Street. Giving us some front row seat tickets can be considered a form of gratitude.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan covered her mouth as she giggled. \u201cI think they want to get closer to you, Brother Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, enough talk. Let\u2019s go and join the queue,\u201d said Lin Fan. There weren\u2019t too many people queuing now. It was just the right time to join.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, Master Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, a voice came from behind.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan turned around and took a look but he was taken aback. \u201cYou are\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan thought for a moment, then realized. \u201cYou\u2019re the coach of Golden Flowers, Wu Ze.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Ze smiled. \u201cYes, I\u2019m the coach of Golden Flowers, Wu Ze. I didn\u2019t think that someone would recognize me. Master Lin, are you two here to watch the game too?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan hadn\u2019t thought that the coach of this team would recognize him. It seemed that his fame was pretty good.</p><br/><p>Wu Ze smiled and said, \u201cMaster Lin, why don\u2019t you two come with me and go inside to watch? My players have been frequently talking about you lately. If they know that Master Lin is watching them play, they would definitely be pumped up.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo I really have such an impact?\u201d Lin Fan laughed, not expecting to hear that.</p><br/><p>Wu Ze said, \u201cOf course. You\u2019re their idol. They always look at your Weibo page whenever they go on Weibo. They even say frequently that it would be great if Master Lin could watch them play. That\u2019s why I didn\u2019t quite dare to confirm that it was you when I saw you from afar. I rushed over here to see and it turns out that it really is you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan said excitedly, \u201cBrother Lin, let\u2019s go inside to watch, okay? We\u2019ll get a better view from inside.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan started to chuckle. \u201cAlright, then we\u2019ll go inside. Coach Wu, it wouldn\u2019t bring you any trouble, would it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Ze waved his hand. \u201cNo, not at all. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright then, please bring us,\u201d said Lin Fan. Then, they followed the coach inside. This would be an interesting experience.</p><br/><p>Without saying more, the two of them followed Coach Wu in. They went through a special passage and the staff did not stop them. However, they seemed to recognize Lin Fan as their eyes kept following him.</p><br/><p>When they reached the changing room.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan and Wu You Lan waited outside while Coach Wu went in to take a look first. After all, Wu You Lan was a lady. If there were people who hadn\u2019t dressed up yet, it would be embarrassing.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, Lady Wu, come in,\u201d said Wu Ze.</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan walked in, he could clearly feel that the players inside were very excited.</p><br/><p>\u201cWow, it really is Master Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCoach, Master Lin is really here to watch our match.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, I really worship you. I always look at your Weibo and every time I see something related to you, I always cheer you on.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, the players all surrounded Lin Fan. Although some of them were older than Lin Fan, they were full of admiration as they stood in front of their idol.</p><br/><p>Sometimes, they would become anxious when they saw the incidents that Master Lin faced. After all, those incidents were way too scary.</p><br/><p>But everytime Master Lin resolved those situations, they would be deeply shocked and filled with awe.</p><br/><p>Along the way, they completely turned into fans of Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled and said, \u201cIt\u2019s our first time meeting. Hello, everyone.\u201d</p><br/><p>The players all smiled back. \u201cHello, Master Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded. \u201cThis time, everyone must work hard. Do your best.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, all the players became pumped up. One of them yelled in a deep voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome on! Master Lin is here, we have to win! Otherwise, it would be a shame!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. We have to win this game.\u201d</p><br/><p>Because of Lin Fan\u2019s arrival, everyone\u2019s fighting spirit was high.</p><br/><p>At that moment, the match was about to begin. The players had to enter the stadium.</p><br/><p>Wu Ze said, \u201cMaster Lin, let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded. \u201cAlright.\u201d</p><br/><p>The stadium was already packed with people. The tickets had already been sold out. Who knew how many people hadn\u2019t managed to buy the tickets and were waiting outside?</p><br/><p>That was the reason the resellers were buying the tickets for a high price.</p><br/><p>This match wasn\u2019t an average match. It was a match between Golden Flowers and Japan\u2019s Yokohama F. Marinos.</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan and Wu You Lan came out, the place was filled with roaring cheers and it was a sea of red.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan said, \u201cThe atmosphere is amazing watching from here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded. \u201cIt is indeed.\u201d</p><br/><p>As the coach, Wu Ze saw this match with great importance. And he realized that, since Master Lin\u2019s appearance, the players were filled with energy and focus.</p><br/><p>Sitting on the coach\u2019s seat, he quietly awaited the start of the competition.</p><br/><p>Reporters were there to capture and record the scene.</p><br/><p>Huang Jun was a broadcaster who specialized in broadcasting various competitions for the netizens.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy Internet friends, this time, we\u2019re broadcasting Golden Flowers against Japan\u2019s Yokohama F. Marinos. Right now, the players have already stepped on the field and match is about to begin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn. Let\u2019s beat the Japanese team!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. Destroy them!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCome on! Come on!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf Golden Flowers wins this, I\u2019ll send you a rocket, host.\u201d</p><br/><p>Huang Jun looked at the screen and said, \u201cThis match can be considered a fierce battle between giants. Yokohama F. Marinos is very strong. Back in 2003, they won Golden Flowers 2-0. Now, after over a decade, I wonder how these two teams compare to each other. However, I believe that Golden Flowers will definitely be able to avenge themselves today and wash away their shame from the last defeat.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHost, 6666\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI almost wanted to kill the host just now. Luckily, the host said those things at the end.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBrothers, if they don\u2019t win this time, I\u2019ll broadcast myself eating sh*t.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, Huang Jun\u2019s gaze suddenly turned towards Golden Flowers\u2019 coaches\u2019 seats. Instantly, his brows furrowed as if he didn\u2019t dare to confirm it.</p><br/><p>\u201cHost, what the f*ck are you doing? Why isn\u2019t the camera lens moving at all?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah! Host, what\u2019s up with you? Don\u2019t doze off!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHurry up and let us see the surroundings. Are you there?\u201d</p><br/><p>Huang Jun seemed to have realized something. \u201cEveryone, help me to take a look. That person sitting at the coaches\u2019 seats, is that Master Lin? Why do I feel like it looks like him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Master Lin?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHost, don\u2019t talk nonsense. Aim your camera at him and let me use my eagle\u2019s eye to take a look.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, Huang Jun aimed his camera at the coaches\u2019 seats.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, how can we see from so far away?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck. Host, couldn\u2019t you buy a ticket for a seat closer to the front? Right now, we can\u2019t even see a single person clearly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Huang Jun was dumbfounded. \u201cYou\u2019re blaming me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I don\u2019t blame you, who would I blame?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut looking at the rough silhouette, it does look like Master Lin. Still, I can\u2019t confirm it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEnough looking. The match is starting.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, the match officially began.</p></div>\n</div>"}

And even if he did explain, they would find loopholes in his explanation and exploit them in order to create an even bigger ruckus.</p><br/><p>However, Wu You Lan and the rest couldn\u2019t take it anymore.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Lin, these people are really absurd. Why don\u2019t you say anything about it?\u201d Wu You Lan was really getting impatient. Seeing these people tarnish Brother Lin\u2019s reputation, she had an indescribable feeling in her heart.</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang was the same. \u201cF*ck. I\u2019ll go and scold them back. These guys don\u2019t even use their brains. How can what they\u2019re saying be possible?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled and didn\u2019t say anything.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Fraud Tian saw through Lin Fan with one glance. He felt sorry for Wu You Lan and Zhao Zhong Yang who were acting like babies. But seeing their expressions, it looked as if they were really outraged. He decided to be a good person and he spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be angry. Don\u2019t you know that he isn\u2019t anxious at all? He\u2019s just waiting for these people to have their fun. Then, he\u2019ll take care of them in one strike,\u201d said Fraud Tian with a shake of his head.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked over at Fraud Tian as he felt that this Fraud had suddenly become a lot more intelligent. It was like a miracle for him to be able to see that. After all, Lin Fan always hid his intentions.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian realized Lin Fan was looking over and couldn\u2019t help but say suspiciously, \u201cWhat are you looking at? Could it be that I\u2019m wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shook his head. \u201cNo. I felt that you were too right. Looks like you know me best after all.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian said, \u201cHaha. I, Tian, have navigated around so many people around the country. If I can\u2019t even read you accurately, I would\u2019ve wasted my time. Whatever you\u2019re cooking up, I can tell with one sniff.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang immediately came over when he heard that. \u201cIs that really true?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow could it not be? Be patient. Let the bullets fly for a bit.\u201d Fraud Tian was very pleased with Zhao Zhong Yang. The previous time when they had gone for dinner, although Fraud Tian still had to pay, he had done it willingly. At the dining table, there had been a young lady who had spontaneously asked for Fraud Tian\u2019s WeChat account number and she had even praised him for being gentle and mature. Fraud Tian\u2019s heart had nearly soared.</p><br/><p>He felt as if no female had ever said such things to him before.</p><br/><p>Although this lady sometimes asked him for red packets, he was happy to give some to her. She had a very sweet mouth and she kept calling him \u2018Big Brother Tian\u2019. That really made his heart bloom like a flower.</p><br/><p>Hearing that, Zhao Zhong Yang didn\u2019t want to think about this anymore. Then, he said curiously, \u201cFraud, be careful when you chat with that lady. She\u2019s quite playful. Don\u2019t be tricked by her.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian was upset upon hearing that. \u201cWhat are you talking about? Hong Hong is a great girl. If you talk bad about Hong Hong, you better be careful. I might just beat you up.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang would not have that. \u201cWhat? Are you going to beat me up for a girl? Fraud, you\u2019ve hurt my feelings.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan watched as the two quarreled and shook his head helplessly. These two people were hopeless.</p><br/><p>Then, Wu You Lan asked, \u201cBrother Lin, will you really explain yourself later on?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. The truth will eventually come out.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nanshan Children\u2019s Welfare Institute.</p><br/><p>A group of teachers had gathered together. When they had seen the news on the Internet, they had been outraged.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow can these people on the Internet talk this way about Master Lin? What they are saying is completely untrue.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah! I just tried to prove it on Weibo but I actually got flamed by people. They\u2019re saying that we\u2019re lying just because we\u2019re getting the apartments.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThese people don\u2019t even know the situation. How could they not know what kind of person Master Lin is?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExactly. No matter what I say on the Internet, it\u2019s useless. It\u2019s really pi*sing me off. And Master Lin won\u2019t even explain himself.\u201d</p><br/><p>On the Internet.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, this piece of news suddenly blew up. Could it be true?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow could it be true? Master Lin isn\u2019t that kind of person. Anyway, I\u2019ll believe in Master Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be deceived by that Lin. Let me tell you. This piece of news is true. Nanshan Children\u2019s Welfare Institute\u2019s land is special. It belongs to the institute itself. When that Lin spontaneously took over the welfare institute, it was for this piece of land. As long as he builds an apartment building, he\u2019ll definitely sell it for an insane price.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. Who would be willing to spare so much effort to take over a welfare institute nowadays? Without any benefits, even I wouldn\u2019t do it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOnce he builds it and sells the apartments, how much will they cost? I can\u2019t even imagine. If he sells one apartment for a few million, that would already be considered cheap.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn. Hearing you guys say all this, I feel that it\u2019s probably true.</p><br/><p>Eastern Han Group.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang was in his office. At that moment, his secretary entered in a hurry.</p><br/><p>The secretary said, \u201cChief Wang, look at this. People on the Internet are saying that Master Lin is misappropriating that piece of land. They\u2019re saying that he wants to build the apartment block so he can sell it at a high price.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Wang Ming Yang heard that, he was a little upset. \u201cAre these people retarded? How could they spread such rumors?\u201d</p><br/><p>The secretary saw that Chief looked displeased, then he said timidly, \u201cMaster Lin hasn\u2019t explained himself regarding this matter either, so the people on the Internet are all drawing conclusions about it. It even seems that there are some haters trying to make a big deal out of it. That\u2019s how the situation has reached such a stage.</p><br/><p>When Wang Ming Yang saw all this, he was furious. Sometimes, he really couldn\u2019t understand the things his brother did as they were arduous and unrewarding. He had already estimated the price required to develop this piece of land. It was a sky-high amount. Even to Wang Ming Yang, it was quite a significant amount.</p><br/><p>However, all of this was for the children to build a strong foundation. Wang Ming Yang had to admit that. After all, since his brother wanted to do it, what else could he say?</p><br/><p>Moreover, in his brother\u2019s words, this was a great thing, to be able to accumulate virtuous deeds. When he grows old, he would be able to feel as if he had done a good thing.</p><br/><p>Right now, this had gone onto the Internet and it had been misunderstood by the people. Wang Ming Yang had an urge to drag those haters in front of him and give them a ferocious beating.</p><br/><p>The secretary said, \u201cChief Wang, Master Lin has to explain things himself. But in my opinion, even if he personally explains it, things won\u2019t be clarified until the apartment has finished construction.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang really wanted to call his brother right now to ask how they should handle this situation.</p><br/><p>If they ignored it, who knew what kind of stupid things those people would continue to say?</p><br/><p>It might become even severer.</p><br/><p>The secretary left.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang immediately made the call. \u201cHello, Brother. Where are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan: \u201cI\u2019m handling the procedures.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

It was a big day and he had to dress appropriately for the occasion. After choosing for some time, he didn't manage to find an outfit that was appropriate for the event. In the end, he could only use the new outfit that he had recently bought. He still looked good in it.</p><br/><p>He left the house but decided to go to his shop first.</p><br/><p>He had drunk quite a lot with Fraud Tian and the rest. Especially since Fraud Tian had been so lucky to secure his funeral funds just because of one sentence. Lin Fan still wondered if he had done it on purpose.</p><br/><p>In the shop.</p><br/><p>The crowd laughed cheerily looking at Lin Fan. \"Looking dashing today in this outfit.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan just smiled. He had to be dressed up for the event in the afternoon. It served as a good form of advertisement for him. It was the largest human trafficking case in history. Although it was solved in just five days, the follow-up challenges weren't that simple.</p><br/><p>Such a large-scale human trafficking organization would definitely have some way to continue their operations but luckily Wang Shen had been directly captured and detained in the police station. Even if he had connections, he couldn't possibly do anything about it. The human traffickers hadn't been warned when the police officers found out about what they did. Hence, they hadn't had time to plan their escape.</p><br/><p>They had been caught off guard.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan switched on his phone and looked at the situation online.</p><br/><p>This matter was a large-scale and groundbreaking one. It had immediately made a few headlines. Regardless of which celebrity wanted to make it to the headlines, they had to let this incident be well documented and reported first.</p><br/><p>\"666\u2026 How awesome. It's a great deed.\"</p><br/><p>\"I didn't expect this human trafficking organization to be so big. They're the scum of society.\"</p><br/><p>\"Over a thousand children\u2026 They must have destroyed so many families. I hope these children can be reunited with their families.\"</p><br/><p>\"+1 for the police force and the mysterious citizen. Who knows the identity of this man?\"</p><br/><p>\"Nobody knows. I hope this person's identity never gets revealed. Although he helped to destroy a large-scale human trafficking company, there are still so many other human traffickers out there. If his identity is revealed, he might get into trouble.\"</p><br/><p>\"I agree with the person above. In view of his safety, I guess we'll never get to know who he is.\"</p><br/><p>\"F*cking dogs, what has our society become? One has to hide after doing such a good deed. Meanwhile, those that do evil deeds live like kings.\"</p><br/><p>\"That can't be helped. It's to protect him.\"</p><br/><p>Then, the official Weibo of the police force posted something.</p><br/><p>\"After verification, 385 out of the 1285 children have been reunited with their families. The remaining 900 children couldn't get in touch with their families. Everyone, please help to repost this. If you think that your child might be here, please bring your identification card and details\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"Immediately reposted!\"</p><br/><p>\"This should be reposted until all the children return home.\"</p><br/><p>\"From the pictures, the children all look really young. It's not easy for them to still remember their house numbers. I really hope they can find their families.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the news and heaved a sigh. Who knew how many could be reunited with their families?</p><br/><p>When these children had been abducted, they had been at most 3 or 4 years old. The youngest wasn't even 1 year old yet. It had been a few years and it was no surprise that they had forgotten their family details.</p><br/><p>These kids typically were brought by the human traffickers to the largely populated beggar districts. Some of them were at train stations and some were at marketplaces. Some of them that were rebellious got their limbs broken. They clamped wooden boards onto their limbs and hired old men and women to accompany the children and act pitiful.</p><br/><p>These children didn't dare to say anything after getting beaten up badly. Some good Samaritans even asked them about what had happened but they didn't dare to say anything. Some of them were even taken away by the human traffickers.</p><br/><p>It was extremely fortunate for these 300 children to have found their homes.</p><br/><p>Some of these children remembered their house numbers and some had been matched to their families by DNA. But most of the children didn't have any progress. Therefore, they needed the help of all the netizens to find their families back.</p><br/><p>Of course, it wasn't an easy task. It wouldn't be resolved so soon.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan: \"Please help to repost this. We are stronger when we're united. Hopefully, they'll be able to find their families.\"</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan looked at the content and said, \"I think these children should be able to find their parents.\"</p><br/><p>Wu Tian He said, \"I think it will be quite difficult. Some of them have their limbs broken. Their parents might not even want to take them back.\"</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan looked at him, \"Dad, how can that be? Their children are their precious treasures. It doesn't matter what they've become, their parents will definitely take them back.\"</p><br/><p>Wu Tian He didn't say much else. He didn't want his daughter to be too depressed so he smiled and said, \"That's just some of my thoughts.\"</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Lin Fan had been given a wake-up call by Wu Tian He's words. This kind of situation wasn't impossible. Some of these parents had still been young when they lost their children and they had managed to have another child. If they were to find out that their children had become handicapped, they might not want to take them back. This was just how inhumane some people could be. Anything could happen.</p><br/><p>In the afternoon.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan pushed the car towards the ceremonial hall. The ceremony was held there. Just when Lin Fan reached the hall, Liu Xiao Tian called him.</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian said, \"Master Lin, are you here yet?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \"I'm here. I'm at the entrance and I can see you. Here, here!\"</p><br/><p>When Liu Xiao Tian saw Master Lin waving his hand, he smiled and went forward. \"Master Lin, let's go backstage. All the guests want to see you.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled, \"What's there to see?\"</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian smiled and replied, \"What's there not to see? You're their hero. You might not know the impact of this matter. Maybe you won't even understand it if I explained it. Anyway, you just need to know that this incident was able to be resolved because of your help.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed. He had thought all along that it was just a simple feat on his part. It was just fate. If Wang Yao wasn't so crazy, he wouldn't have slapped Wang Yao twice. He wouldn't have called Wang Shen and if Wang Shen hadn't come over, he wouldn't have seen these problems.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \"Chief Liu, you really don't need to thank me because of this. If not for your trust in me, this wouldn't have reached a conclusion either.\"</p><br/><p>What he said was true. If it had been someone else that said Wang Shen was the leader of a human trafficking organization, nobody would've believed him. Furthermore, Wang Shen had even called a government leader. A typical person wouldn't have been able to handle the pressure.</p><br/><p>This couldn't have been achieved just by one person.</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian waved his hand. \"Let's not talk about that. Anyway, this wouldn't have been resolved if not for you. Come, let's go backstage. I even prepared a big present for you.\"</p><br/><p>Backstage.</p><br/><p>The Northeastern representatives and leaders sat there discussing among themselves. They were ecstatic. This matter had been resolved so beautifully. They would probably still remember this incident when they retire and be proud of it.</p><br/><p>Then, Liu Xiao Tian brought Lin Fan there and said, \"Everyone, our hero is here\u2026\"</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan heard these words, he was a little embarrassed.</p><br/><p>It was just a piece of cake. There's no need for all this trouble.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

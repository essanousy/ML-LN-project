Right now, she didn\u2019t really dare to touch Ying Jin.</p><br/><p>Ying Jin wiped away her tears. She had a cold expression on her face, which caused many to fear of looking at her.</p><br/><p>\u201cSister Ying, has everything been settled?\u201d Her manager asked in a hushed tone. From what she saw, it should be rather successful. Sister Ying cried very badly and looked very regretful. She even saw some reporters look away as if they couldn\u2019t take watching her cry anymore.</p><br/><p>However, if only she knew that these reporters looked away because they could not bear to watch her directly, she wouldn\u2019t have asked these questions.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you an id*ot?\u201d Ying Jin lifted her head and looked at her manager. \u201cWith your level of IQ, I\u2019m already doing you a favor by putting you as my manager. Get out of my way!\u201d</p><br/><p>Her manager stood awkwardly at one side. She felt like crying. Being Ying Jin\u2019s manager, she has endured a lot.</p><br/><p>She was treated like a dog.</p><br/><p>She knew that Ying Jin only chose her to be her manager because she listened to instructions and she also wasn\u2019t very bright.</p><br/><p>Just take a look at the other celebrities. They held their managers in such high regard. They have not treated them anything like the way she was.</p><br/><p>Every time they were in a group, she saw how lucky the other managers were, and she would feel a pang of jealousy.</p><br/><p>From other people\u2019s perspective, when they heard that she was Ying Jin\u2019s manager, they would feel that it was very high-end with good welfare. However, only she knew that she was just another dog.</p><br/><p>The surrounding bodyguards looked at her with sympathy, but they didn\u2019t dare to say anything.</p><br/><p>*Ring ring*</p><br/><p>At this moment, Ying Jin\u2019s phone began to ring.</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone, get out.\u201d Ying Jin said. She only picked up the call when everyone left.</p><br/><p>\u201cHas the matter been resolved?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe reporters just left. I don\u2019t know what the situation would be like. I can\u2019t take this anymore. I need him to pay the price as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already sent people to Shanghai. We\u2019d give that fellow something to remember deeply. I never knew that there\u2019d be such idiots. Just because they have a slight bit of skills, they forget what they\u2019re truly capable of.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ying Jin nodded her head in contentment. However, she was still raging internally. If it weren\u2019t for Lin Fan, she wouldn\u2019t be in such a predicament.</p><br/><p>As for that scum, Yang Jie. If only she knew where she went, or else she\u2019d definitely give him a hard time.</p><br/><p>The next day.</p><br/><p>Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>Pfft.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan read the news on his phone. He couldn\u2019t help but stand up.</p><br/><p>\u201cTake a look! This meddling woman just doesn\u2019t want any face.\u201d Lin Fan didn\u2019t think that someone could be so shameless. He was especially blinded when he watched the video.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can only blame myself for being too young and foolish. I just couldn\u2019t resist.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was almost as if he couldn\u2019t hold his phone steady after listening to the nauseating voice coming from his phone.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian surrounded him. \u201cAiyo, this voice sounds rather delicate. If she were to be my wife, I\u2019d hit her three times a day. Morning, afternoon, and at night!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou b*stard. Very hardcore.\u201d Lin Fan gave up a thumbs up. Much respect indeed.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2019s alright. Although her nose is rather large.\u201d Fraud Tian was clear and logical with his comments.</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yan ridiculed, \u201cThis Ying Jin can sure put up an act. Brother Lin. You don\u2019t think the netizens would forgive her just like this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed out loud, \u201cDo you think the netizens are idiots? When it comes to people\u2019s emotions, no matter how pitiful one can be, they wouldn\u2019t be forgiven so easily.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMoreover, look at this Ying Jin. In the entertainment circle, she gets exactly what she wants. She\u2019s too bossy. I\u2019m sure there are many people waiting for her downfall.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even though he didn\u2019t mix around in this circle, everyone knew that no matter how awesome of a person you are, if you\u2019re a hypocrite and a bully, there would definitely be people around who wanted to chop you down.</p><br/><p>On Weibo.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck! Her crying is f*cking disgusting.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2019s already so old, yet she still calls herself young. How childish. She really doesn\u2019t want her face.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGet her out of the music industry, as well as variety shows. If she appears on any of those shows, we wouldn\u2019t watch them!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell said! I\u2019m not going to buy any product that she represents for any more!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t act pitiful.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGet out of the music industry!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>It was buzzing online. At this moment, the netizens rallied together to boycott Ying Jin.</p><br/><p>Looking at this matter, the people within the industry thought that she should just give up. She wouldn\u2019t be able to wash her name off this dirty secrets of hers. If she were in her twenties, people might just forgive her.</p><br/><p>However, right now, it was virtually impossible.</p><br/><p>Within the circle of a few singers.</p><br/><p>\u201cRegarding this matter, Ying Jin is done for.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat can\u2019t be possible. With her position, no matter what they say, nothing can happen to her.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy not? The dirty secrets have already been exposed. No matter how high her position is, it wouldn\u2019t be of any use.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWith Master Lin hot on Ying Jin\u2019s tail, she won\u2019t be able to solve this matter by simple means.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI really admire this Master Lin. Even though I haven\u2019t met him in person, through this matter, I can tell that he is very valiant.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStop joking around. Why don\u2019t you go and look him up online? This guy is extremely popular and has many fans. Ordinary people wouldn\u2019t dare to go against him. I\u2019ve totally forgotten how Ying Jin got into this fight with Master Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis started even before Wu Huan Yue made her debut when she first joined the competition.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWu Huan Yue is really lucky to have met such someone so influential. He writes such amazing lyrics and yet he does not seem to want the money. He also looks like he is very devoted. I wonder what kind of position Master Lin enjoys?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t spout nonsense. I don\u2019t think anything along that line has happened.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho would believe that nothing happened? Wu Huan Yue has an impressive figure. She\u2019s beautiful and alluring. Especially that *ss. Even us women would want a bit of that action.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have a good eye.\u201d</p><br/><p>At the hotel.</p><br/><p>Ying Jin looked at the discussions on Weibo. Her face was pale. She stood up fiercely and walked towards her manager.</p><br/><p>Her manager, who was waiting for someone, saw that Ying Jin was walking towards her. She became slightly nervous, \u201cSister\u2026 Sister Ying.\u201d</p><br/><p>*Slap!*</p><br/><p>She slapped her manager directly on her face without any hesitation.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow despicable can you be? You stupid scoundrel! How dare you say this about me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ying Jin was extremely furious. This was the first time she had been met with such a situation since becoming famous. In the past, she was able to tolerate the netizens\u2019 scoldings and pretend as if nothing happened.</p><br/><p>However, this time, she couldn\u2019t take it anymore.</p><br/><p>This was because this time, the evidence was exposed, and she was feeling rather lacking in confidence.</p><br/><p>From being all high and mighty to having nothing at all. She could not stand it at all.</p><br/><p>Just at this moment, the phone rang.</p><br/><p>Her manager saw the notification on the phone, and weakly said, \u201cSister Ying, its a call from Ju Lai Mei.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ju Lai Mei was the company she was the ambassador for. The endorsement amount was eighty million for three years.</p><br/><p>\u201cPick it up,\u201d Ying Jin glared at her. She hasn\u2019t entirely calmed down.</p><br/><p>Her manager picked up the call, \u201cHello.\u201d</p><br/><p>Slowly, the expression of her manager turned to one of fear and shock.</p><br/><p>Ying Jin asked, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>Her manager didn\u2019t dare to say anything. She turned her back against Ying Jin. Fearing that she\u2019d be hit again, she carefully said, \u201cYing Jin, Ju Lai Mei said that you have violated their contract. Right now, there\u2019s a conflict online asking them to terminate their contract with you, as well as to pay them back. At the same time, based on the contract, you are to pay an additional of ten million as a penalty. If you aren\u2019t going to pay them, they said they\u2019d see you in court.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck them!\u201d Ying Jin couldn\u2019t take it anymore. She took the ashtray in front of her and smashed it on her manager\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>There was a scream of agony.</p><br/><p>Fresh blood dripped everywhere.</p></div>\n</div>"}

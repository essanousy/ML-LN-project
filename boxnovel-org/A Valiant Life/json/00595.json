There were many things that he didn\u2019t understand. Even this \u2018Nobita\u2019s Forgiveness Cap\u2019 had a mysterious history.</p><br/><p>He just felt that this \u2018Nobita Nobi\u2019 was a little rash for specially creating this Forgiveness Cap. It was a little scary.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Lin Fan was left with 395 Encyclopedic Points.a</p><br/><p>He could only wait for his Chinese Medicine foundational teaching materials to be distributed completely to earn more Encyclopedic Points.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan said with some lingering fear, \u201cThat was really too dangerous. If it hadn\u2019t been for Brother Lin, Lil\u2019 Wang might really have jumped and it would\u2019ve been really bad. That woman is really shameless. Even I, as a fellow woman, am looking down on her.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian sighed, \u201cSigh, people nowadays. Luckily, I, Tian, was had seen through this society decades ago. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve been single until now. It\u2019s because I\u2019m afraid of being harmed by this kind of woman.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed, \u201cFraud Tian, can\u2019t you have some shame? You probably couldn\u2019t find a woman, am I right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian chuckled, \u201cWhat are you talking about? Back then, I, Tian, was undefeated in the cities and the countryside. Who knows how many girls cast flirtatious glances at me? But I turned a blind eye to them because I\u2019m a man that they will never be able to get.\u201d</p><br/><p>*clap clap*</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang applauded. \u201cYou should be given a hundred points for that awesome reasoning. But I can only give you one point. The remaining ninety-nine points have been deducted because you are just bragging.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCheh, I shan\u2019t talk to you young people. You won\u2019t understand my experiences,\u201d Fraud Tian said with a sigh. He silently sat at the entrance and lit up his cigarette. Then, he looked afar with a deep expression on his face.</p><br/><p>Soon after.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was thinking about life when a series of disharmonious sounds came.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was him who hit me,\u201d Qian Hao Yun pointed at Lin Fan as he said this. He had come in hastily with a policeman. There was a look of rage in his eyes.</p><br/><p>The policeman said, \u201cMaster Lin, this man says that you hit him. Did such a thing really happen?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan glanced at Qian Hao Yun and said, \u201cWho is he? I don\u2019t even recognize him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBullsh*t. You were the one who just hit me. Look, my face is still swollen,\u201d said Qian Hao Yun angrily.</p><br/><p>The policeman frowned, \u201cPlease watch your attitude. Don\u2019t speak so vulgarly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qian Hao Yun was about to erupt in rage. \u201cHe was the one who hit me.\u201d</p><br/><p>The policeman said, \u201cHe said that he doesn\u2019t recognize you, nor did he hit you. Do you have any proof?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Xiao, come here and tell the policeman whether he hit me,\u201d Qian Hao Yun shouted.</p><br/><p>Li Xiao Xiao was stuck in a dumbfounded state. When she heard Qian Hao Yun\u2019s words, she looked at Lin Fan and said, \u201cIt was him. He was the one who hit my boyfriend.\u201d</p><br/><p>Actually, this policeman already believed that Master Lin must have hit him, but would he admit it?</p><br/><p>Of course not.</p><br/><p>Who was Master Lin? Master Lin was the idol of the normal policemen like him. Master Lin had a great relationship with the police department.</p><br/><p>The policeman asked, \u201cYou said that you saw it. How did he hit you then?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qian Hao Yun had no idea. He hadn\u2019t seen it. He shook his head and said, \u201cI didn\u2019t see it.\u201d</p><br/><p>The policeman said, \u201cYou are really strange. You said that he hit you but you didn\u2019t even see it. Then how do you know that he hit you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qian Hao Yun said, \u201cThis is my girlfriend. She saw it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, your girlfriend saw it. Alright then. How did he hit your boyfriend?\u201d asked the policeman.</p><br/><p>Li Xiao Xiao gestured as she said, \u201cHe jumped up, then kicked my boyfriend\u2019s face with a single kick, sending him flying for several meters.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSeveral meters. How heavy are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m 160 pounds.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe kicked your face and your 160-pound body flew several meters. Do you think that\u2019s possible?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the truth.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, Qian Hao Yun pointed at the policeman and said, \u201cI know now. You\u2019re on his side. You never even thought about arresting him, did you? What\u2019s your police code number? I\u2019m going to complain about you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan couldn\u2019t keep watching. \u201cAlright. You said that I hit you, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qian Hao Yun glared at Lin Fan furiously. \u201cRight, it was you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou said that I hit you. I won\u2019t admit to that. But if you have to insist that I hit you and if I really admit to it, you definitely wouldn\u2019t agree. Stand still and watch closely,\u201d Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>Qian Hao Yun just stood there, with no idea what Lin Fan was going to do.</p><br/><p>\u201cWatch the leg.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bam!</p><br/><p>At that moment, Lin Fan\u2019s kick sent Qian Hao Yun flying back several meters.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re good now. You\u2019ve seen it clearly. There\u2019s no more need for debate. My police comrade, that kick was kicked by me,\u201d said Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>The policeman was dumbfounded. What was going on? Master Lin had really kicked him.</p><br/><p>Li Xiao Xiao gasped in shock, then hurriedly ran to Qian Hao Yun\u2019s side.</p><br/><p>However, there seemed to be a packet of granules on the floor.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan\u2019s gaze shifted. \u201cHey, my police comrade, look at what that is. Why does it look like ecstasy to my expert eyes?\u201d</p><br/><p>The policeman was startled. Then, he rushed forward and picked up the white packet that Qian Hao Yun had dropped. He had received the police department\u2019s drug lesson before and he could tell what it was with one look.</p><br/><p>Then, he took out his handcuffs and cuffed Qian Hao Yun\u2019s hands together.</p><br/><p>\u201cEmergency Headquarters, I\u2019ve captured a man in possession of ecstasy. Please lend assistance,\u201d The policeman quickly contacted the headquarters. He hadn\u2019t expected things to turn out this way.</p><br/><p>When Li Xiao Xiao heard what the policeman said, her expression changed. She wanted to leave the place. She had no idea what was going on. Why was her boyfriend hiding ecstasy?</p><br/><p>However, the policeman couldn\u2019t let her leave. He blocked her off and said, \u201cYou\u2019re not allowed to go. Follow me back for investigation.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xiao Xiao was stupefied. This had nothing to do with her. She had only gotten to know Qian Hao Yun a few days back.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shrugged and said, \u201cMy police comrade, there\u2019s no issue with me hitting him anymore, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>The police comrade said, \u201cMaster Lin, you\u2019ve assisted us in arresting a drug user.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. How magical.</p><br/><p>Soon after, the police forces arrived.</p><br/><p>Qian Hao Yun and Li Xiao Xiao were both taken into the police car.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved goodbye. \u201cHave a safe trip, police comrades. I shan\u2019t take recognition for this contribution. No need to give me another Good Citizen Award\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The policemen in the car couldn\u2019t help but laugh, \u201cMaster Lin is really amusing. But now we understand why Inspector Liu can promote so quickly. When you\u2019re with Master Lin, you can close your eyes and still run into a criminal.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat is true.\u201d</p><br/><p>What Lin Fan didn\u2019t know was that after this incident, a rumor spread in the police department, saying that if you wanted to capture a criminal, you should get to know Master Lin. Then, you might really find that criminal.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Two days later.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was looking at his phone in the shop. Suddenly, two expected guests came.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, save me\u2026\u201d Before Chang Hai Ge\u2019s body appeared, his shouts could already be heard.</p><br/><p>Shen Ming was pushing the wheelchair with a look of anticipation on his face as well. They had finally reached.</p><br/><p>To Chang Hai Ge, coming to Cloud Street again made him very thrilled and excited.</p><br/><p>Because there was hope here.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan glanced at the two of them. He shook his head, \u201cThis is the result of not listening to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chang Hai Ge lowered his head. His heart was filled with regret.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, please save me. I know my mistake now\u2026\u201d Chang Hai Ge was closed to tears. He could only hope that Master Lin would give him a second chance.</p></div>\n</div>"}

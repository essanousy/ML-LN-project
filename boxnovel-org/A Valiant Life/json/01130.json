No one spoke.</p><br/><p>There was only that deep breathing sound which emanated through the conference room.</p><br/><p>Chu Shen\u2019s face was completely red as he stood there. There was a limitless rage in his eyes as he glared at Lin Fan. He hadn\u2019t expected things to turn out like this.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re leaving!\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, Chu Shen growled in a deep tone. He felt that he had suffered an immense humiliation. It was hard for him to take it but, over here, he felt powerless. Hence, he decided to leave this place before thinking of a plan.</p><br/><p>Seeing the opposite party walk away, Lin Fan said anxiously, \u201cWait a minute. What are you doing? Your face hasn\u2019t become like a pig\u2019s face yet. Why are you leaving already? Aren\u2019t you going to stay and wait for your face to become like a pig\u2019s face?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Shen shot Lin Fan a cold stare before pushing the door open. When Xu Zi Le and the secretary, who were waiting outside, saw his red face, they were given a scare.</p><br/><p><em>What exactly happened inside? Why is his face so red? Could it be that there was a problem?</em></p><br/><p>*Bam!*</p><br/><p>As Chu Shen passed the lounge area, he saw a coffee table and couldn\u2019t resist flipping it over. It was as if the fury in his heart needed to be vented out.</p><br/><p>Just as he reached the elevator entrance, a voice rang in his ears.</p><br/><p>\u201cStay right there. Pay for it.\u201d Lin Fan had walked out with Wang Ming Yang. When he saw that Chu Shen had broken the glass coffee table, he immediately spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph,\u201d Chu Shen grunted coldly and ignored him. Then, he walked towards the inside of the elevator.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m giving you one last chance. Pay up.\u201d Lin Fan\u2019s voice suddenly became cold. His expression was no longer a playful one. It had become very stern.</p><br/><p>When Chu Shen\u2019s rage-filled gaze interlocked with Lin Fan\u2019s gaze, his heart trembled as if he was being stared down by a lion.</p><br/><p>It was as if things would end up very badly if he didn\u2019t pay up.</p><br/><p>\u201cHere.\u201d Chu Shen had no other choice against Lin Fan\u2019s gaze. He took out some money from the black bag in his bodyguard\u2019s hands and tossed it on the ground.</p><br/><p>The way he tossed it was casual and arrogant. It was as if he was tossing it to a beggar.</p><br/><p>The elevator doors slowly closed.</p><br/><p>But suddenly, they opened up again.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan had pressed the elevator button. He stared coldly at Chu Shen. \u201cI\u2019m giving you one more chance. Pick up the money and pass it over obediently. Otherwise, I guarantee that you will definitely leave this place looking like a pig.\u201d</p><br/><p>When the bodyguard saw this, he hastily went forward and wanted to pick up the money. However, Lin Fan\u2019s words made him stop in his tracks. \u201cIt\u2019s useless for you to pick it up. I want him.\u201d</p><br/><p>The bodyguard was stunned. Then, he looked up. \u201cMaster Lin, our Chief Chu is\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved his hand. \u201cDon\u2019t talk to me about that. Today, even if he\u2019s the emperor, he has to pick up the money and pass it over obediently.\u201d</p><br/><p>The bodyguard looked at Chu Shen helplessly. He had no choice anymore. Perhaps other people wouldn\u2019t know what kind of personality this Master Lin had but how could he not know?</p><br/><p>Things that had happened in the past, despite how long ago they had happened, had been drilled into his heart. He couldn\u2019t offend this Master Lin. He really couldn\u2019t.</p><br/><p>He could easily recall all those past incidents in Qingzhou and in the Northeast.</p><br/><p>It could be said that Master Lin was a vicious person. Although he was all smiles when he appeared on the Internet, when he truly displayed his ferocity, he was really terrifying.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, don\u2019t go overboard. Let me tell you this. You can protect him for now but you can\u2019t protect him for life. Don\u2019t go overboard today and I won\u2019t take it to heart.\u201d Chu Shen felt a tremendous humiliation. He had never felt this way before.</p><br/><p>If his friends were to see this, they would die laughing.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang stood there motionlessly. His brother was resolving this matter, so he didn\u2019t need to say anything.</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if you don\u2019t take it to heart, I\u2019ve already taken it to heart. Pick up the money and pass it over obediently. Then, I\u2019ll let it be. But if you don\u2019t do it, I can play with you slowly,\u201d said Lin Fan coldly.</p><br/><p>Chu Shen just stood there and stared and Lin Fan. After a long while, he finally couldn\u2019t take it anymore. He walked out of the elevator and picked up the money. Then, he went in front of Wang Ming Yang and passed the money to him.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>With great difficulty, these four words came out from Chu Shen\u2019s mouth.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan let out a smile and his hands relaxed. \u201cAlright, have a safe trip back. If you have another argument with my brother again in the future and you want to know if he dares to hit you, you are welcome to come to Eastern Han Organization. I\u2019ll be waiting.\u201d</p><br/><p>The elevator doors closed.</p><br/><p>In the elevator, Chu Shen couldn\u2019t resist bursting out, \u201cB*stard. This Lin has gone overboard. I won\u2019t leave it just like that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t take this kind of humiliation.\u201d</p><br/><p>*Bam!*</p><br/><p>Chu Shen slammed his fist on the elevator wall. A loud rumbling sound rang out.</p><br/><p>The bodyguards stood behind him with their heads lowered, not daring to say anything.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, because of that punch, the elevator came to an abrupt halt. The light inside dimmed.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this? What\u2019s going on?\u201d When the furious Chu Shen saw this, he was stunned. Then, he started grumbling, \u201cWhat kind of f*cked up elevator is this? How can it just suddenly stop?\u201d</p><br/><p>The rage in his heart was hard to contain. Then, he kicked the elevator doors.</p><br/><p>When the bodyguards saw this, their expressions instantly turned fearful. They immediately tried to restrain him. \u201cChief Chu, you can\u2019t kick it. We\u2019re in the elevator. If it falls, it would be really bad.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re on the eighteenth floor, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>When Chu Shen heard those words, his heart trembled. If the elevator were to fall, their bodies would definitely be crushed and they would die instantly.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs anyone there? Open the door! Open the door!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy did the elevator stop?\u201d</p><br/><p>Outside.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan grinned as he said, \u201cMing Yang, the elevator has suddenly stopped.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang was still in shock. \u201cThis lift can\u2019t be punched and kicked. Otherwise, it will respond by stopping.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go. We\u2019ll go down and ask for another compensation,\u201d said Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Then, they took the other elevator down.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang had a dumbfounded look on his face. He had no idea what was going on today.</p><br/><p>He felt that all this was too unreal.</p><br/><p>Xu Zi Le and the secretary just stood there. Their hearts were slow to react. They had been standing outside and didn\u2019t know what had happened inside at all.</p><br/><p>But looking at the situation, it seemed that something huge had happened.</p><br/><p>That person who had appeared fearsome at first had come out of the conference room with a red face. It was as if he had been beaten by someone.</p><br/><p>Moreover, that person seemed to be very fearful as he faced Brother Lin. This made Xu Zi Le mutter in her heart. <em>What </em>the heck happened <em>in that conference room?</em></p><br/><p>Downstairs.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang called the technical staff over.</p><br/><p>The technical staff took a look and said, \u201cChief Wang, this is an emergency stop. It will be fixed in a moment.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved his hand. \u201cThere\u2019s no hurry. Fix it slowly. Use the speaker in the elevator to tell them that the lift is spoiled because of them and it needs to be repaired.\u201d</p><br/><p>The technical staff was stunned. Then, he nodded. Master Lin\u2019s relationship with Chief Wang was not average. Of course, he had to do whatever Master Lin said.</p></div>\n</div>"}

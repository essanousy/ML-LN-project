Of course, the hospital was going to give Yang Bin\u2019s family some compensation for their time.</p><br/><p>Initially, Yang Bin hadn\u2019t wanted any compensation because the hospital had helped him a lot when Yang Yuan was being hospitalized. However, the hospital insisted on compensating him.</p><br/><p>Then, Specialist Mao rushed over and the doctors there also nodded and greeted him.</p><br/><p>Specialist Mao really wanted to know if this mysterious man had anything to do with Master Lin. That was an unknown factor and he wanted to discuss with the child about it.</p><br/><p>In the ward.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-2\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Yang Yuan stood beside his brother and smiled. Although a lot of doctors, uncles and aunties had asked him which man gave him the medicinal pill, he had kept his mouth sealed. Yang Yuan saw that a doctor was here and smiled at him. This particular doctor had been taking care of his whole family. However, he still didn\u2019t want to tell them anything about it.</p><br/><p>Yang Bin knew that his son wouldn\u2019t say anything about it since he had already promised someone to keep it a secret. He couldn\u2019t do anything about it.</p><br/><p>Specialist Mao came and smiled. \u201cI am here to ask Yang Yuan a question.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yang Yuan, who was sitting beside his brother, looked at the doctor curiously. Then, he said firmly, \u201cI will say nothing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Specialist Mao smiled. Then, he thought of an idea.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis time, I\u2019m not here to ask you a question. I\u2019m here to tell you that I know the man who gave you the medicinal pill,\u201d Specialist Mao smiled and said.</p><br/><p>Yang Yuan looked at the doctor curiously.</p><br/><p>Specialist Mao smiled. \u201cHow could you hide it from me? Is that man\u2019s surname Lin? Uncle Lin, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yang Yuan\u2019s mouth gaped open when he heard the name. He hadn\u2019t expected the doctor to know the man. Although he didn\u2019t know the full name of the uncle, he knew his surname. He wanted to repay Uncle Lin in the future.</p><br/><p>Specialist Mao knew that a child could never keep a secret.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-3\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>From his expressions, Specialist Mao could tell what had happened.</p><br/><p>Then, Specialist Mao became really excited. He grabbed onto Yang Yuan\u2019s hand and took out his phone. \u201cLook, is this the man you saw?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yang Yuan looked at the man on the screen and gasped, \u201cUncle Lin\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>When he said that, he immediately covered his mouth.</p><br/><p>Specialist Mao smiled as his plan had succeeded.</p><br/><p>Specialist Mao hadn\u2019t expected the person to be Master Lin of Shanghai. However, as he thought of it, he realized that the only person that was capable of doing that was probably him.</p><br/><p>He had been really shocked when he had found out about the pill that could instantly cure leukemia.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Lin Fan left the Wuxiang Taoist Temple and was on the way home.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, why does it feel so weird?\u201d He mumbled to himself. He just felt like something was wrong.</p><br/><p>It seemed that it had just been a misjudgment.</p><br/><p>The next day!</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-4\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Shanghai was already right before him.</p><br/><p>He had driven till midnight and taken a nap in the car. After resting up, he had immediately continued driving. He has started to miss Shanghai after being away for some time.</p><br/><p>Now that he had completed three missions, he was left with seven. However, he wanted to take it slow.</p><br/><p>Ding ding!</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at his phone and smiled when he saw the caller ID. His buddy had probably called because he missed him.</p><br/><p>He answered the call.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang started to speak to him and his first sentence already shocked him.</p><br/><p>\u201cBro, you\u2019re in deep trouble now,\u201d Wang Ming Yang said.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan didn\u2019t understand what he meant by that. \u201cWhat is it? What do you mean?\u201d</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t understand it. What had he done wrong?</p><br/><p>Furthermore, he had been out of Shanghai this whole time. He hadn\u2019t met any vengeful people or enemies. What did Wang Ming Yang mean by that? Was he just trying to scare Lin Fan?</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, Bro, you\u2019re really crazy. Haven\u2019t you seen the news?\u201d Wang Ming Yang said.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe news? I haven\u2019t seen it yet. What does it have to do with me?\u201d Lin Fan didn\u2019t understand what was going on.</p><br/><p>Although he was the prince of the news headlines, he felt that since nothing extraordinary had happened lately, there was no reason for him to be on the news.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-5\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re driving around now, right? I suggest you look at the news now so that you can think of a way to deal with the situation,\u201d Wang Ming Yang was really in awe of this brother of his.</p><br/><p>He was such an extraordinary man.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, alright. I\u2019ll hang up now and take a look.\u201d Lin Fan felt anxious after hearing what Wang Ming Yang had said. He felt like something had gone wrong.</p><br/><p>After hanging up, he drove to a petrol station and stopped there. Then, he took out his phone and read the news. He felt like he was going to go blind after reading the news articles.</p><br/><p><em>What\u2019s going on?</em></p><br/><p>\u2018A medicinal pill saved a wealthy man\u2019s daughter.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018The mysterious man who cured leukemia has been revealed.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018The hospital medical team reveals that Master Lin was the source of the medicinal pill.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was stunned beyond words at the headlines. How had people even found out about that?</p><br/><p>The netizens started to comment on these articles.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen the news from Wuxiang Taoist Temple was reported, I already knew this was coming.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMe too. A medicinal pill for leukemia and a medicinal pill at the Wuxiang Taoist Temple. Think about it. It\u2019s all about medicinal pills. Besides Master Lin, who else could it be?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis time, I think Master Lin has to hide. There are so many leukemia patients. How is he going to cope with all of them?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow did he get exposed?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you think people are stupid? These facts can be deduced. According to what I know, a lot of people have rushed over to Shanghai.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI am Shanghainese and I am at Cloud Street now. It seems really peaceful for now. However, I think a great army is on the way. Furthermore, Master Lin is not back yet. If he returns, I think things are going to be crazy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was stunned speechless after reading those comments.</p><br/><p>He felt that he must have done something unbelievable.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p></div>\n</div>"}

Ask them to send the ingredients to the school. We have to continue our work in the research room,\u201d Lin Fan was very serious right now. Since he was going to start developing the prescription, he had to use all of his strength in developing it.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-1\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>The previous time they had gone to the school\u2019s research room had been for the anorexia prescription. At that time, there had still been some people who flamed him online. However, he felt that there should not be anyone who would flame him now.</p><br/><p>\u201cI got it. I\u2019ll get on it immediately,\u201d Zhao Ming Qing nodded and said.</p><br/><p>Just as Lin Fan was preparing to leave Cloud Street, a group of people gathered outside the shop.</p><br/><p>One of them was a man who was impeccably dressed. With both hands, he handed his business card to him. His expression was a little excited as he said, \u201cHello, Master Lin. I am the manager of Ha Er Pharmaceutical Company. Our company hopes to invest in your research.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan took the business card and glanced at it and replied, \u201cInvest in me? Not bad. Looks like your pharmaceutical company is looking to serve the people.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s only natural. We are a pharmaceutical company, we have always been thinking about the people. If you can develop the prescription and let us handle it, there will definitely be even greater benefits,\u201d the man said with a lot of excitement.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-2\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>In his eyes, if he was able to act as an agent for this drug, the money they would earn would be like a flood, flowing in non-stop.</p><br/><p>Out of every single industry, which had the highest influx of profit?</p><br/><p>It was definitely pharmaceuticals. The profits were really frightening.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, if Master Lin really was to hand over the prescription which would cure leukemia, their company could use this to expand into the worldwide market. Their stock would probably explode overnight, rising to a level which would make everyone suspicious.</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan heard this, he momentarily smiled and said, \u201cLet you guys handle it? How will you guys handle it?\u201d</p><br/><p>The man clearly did not understand Master Lin\u2019s tone and he felt like Master Lin was interested in it.</p><br/><p>However, if he knew what Master Lin was thinking right now, he would be very pi*sed off, perhaps so much so that he would be spewing with anger.</p><br/><p>The man started talking non-stop. He extravagantly explained all sorts of plans that his company had. If it had been any ordinary person, perhaps they would have been swayed a long time ago.</p><br/><p>\u201cStop, stop. Enough. You don\u2019t have to talk about this anymore. I definitely won\u2019t let anyone else handle my prescription. Okay, all of you guys can leave. I have things to do,\u201d Lin Fan waved them off. All of them had the same basic interest.</p><br/><p>However, Lin Fan had no interest in these things.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-3\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Being the richest man in the world, the most powerful man in the world\u2026 All of this had no value in his eyes.</p><br/><p>He was going to unlock the immortal cultivation major classification. When that happens, why would he still need all these toys?</p><br/><p>Furthermore, he did not really care much about money. If he really wanted to earn money, he could just randomly choose some complicated disease to eradicate and he would be rich.</p><br/><p>Becoming the richest man in the world would not be a problem for him.</p><br/><p>The people surrounding Lin Fan right now were the people from various pharmaceutical companies. Their goal was to become Lin Fan\u2019s agent.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, don\u2019t leave. Wait for a moment.\u201d When these people saw that Master Lin was going to leave, they were very anxious. These kinds of chances were very rare so they could not just let Master Lin leave like that.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was getting a little impatient. He felt like these people were really too determined. He said, \u201cEnough, I\u2019ve already made myself clear. I won\u2019t be working with any pharmaceutical company. At the same time, I don\u2019t need any representative. That\u2019s all, goodbye.\u201d</p><br/><p>However, when he had barely even moved, he was surrounded by people.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, listen to me. My company\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, listen to me. My company has a lot of sincerity. We can discuss the terms of the contract. Just know that my company is really coming with a sincere heart.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Lin Fan felt like his brain was going to explode. These people were really too troublesome.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-4\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cEveryone, come out now.\u201d</p><br/><p>With this call, all the shop owners of Cloud Street all came out of their shops and gathered together.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Boss, what\u2019s happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you guys trying to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHurry up and scram. If you guys come and disturb Little Boss again, I\u2019ll break your dog legs.\u201d</p><br/><p>The shop owners definitely understood what was going on. This group of b*stards actually dared to trouble Little Boss. They were definitely asking for death.</p><br/><p>In the face of the huge group of shop owners, they were scared and finally left.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at Zhao Ming Qing. \u201cMing Qing, quickly get to work. Come to the school a little earlier tomorrow morning, I\u2019ll be waiting for you there.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing was extremely excited at that moment. This was another chance for him to do some big things with his teacher. In his heart, he was filled with excitement.</p><br/><p>When Zhao Ming Qing left, Lin Fan glanced towards Fraud Tian and the rest of them. \u201cTomorrow, help me to tell the townsfolk that the scallion pancakes won\u2019t be on sale for this period of time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian and the rest of them understood what he meant. The situation had become a lot more complicated and was not going to be easy to deal with.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, you don\u2019t have to worry about it, just take care of your own things, I\u2019ll handle the store,\u201d Fraud Tian said.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The next day!</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-5\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>In the morning.</p><br/><p>Huge news had appeared on the web.</p><br/><p>The news was concerning what had gone on at Cloud Street yesterday. When the news appeared on the web, the internet erupted into commotion.</p><br/><p>\u2018Master Lin is currently developing a prescription to cure Leukaemia.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018There are still 10 of the miracle pills that can cure Leukaemia. 10 lucky patients can be cured.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018You don\u2019t want to miss out on seeing the legendary life of Master Lin.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Commotion at Cloud Street. Countless family members of the patients crowd Cloud Street.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018If I put my all into the research, I should be able to cure the majority of these incurable diseases.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The news was being bombed indiscriminately, filling up the whole of the internet.</p><br/><p>Normally, if the news was not related to the entertainment industry, it would not really pique the interest of most people. However, this time, it was different.</p><br/><p>Leukemia was something that everyone was very familiar with. Also, they had a fear in their hearts that they would be unlucky and get Leukemia themselves.</p><br/><p>Thus, when they saw today\u2019s news that Master Lin was going to eradicate Leukemia, it drew the attention of most of the netizens.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn! 6666\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf Master Lin is really successful in his development, will Leukemia actually be something that we don\u2019t have to be afraid of anymore?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis will be a huge milestone in the history of medicine. In the future, Leukemia will be just like a cold. All you\u2019d have to do is take some medicine and you\u2019d be fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c^Are you dumb? Do you even know how Leukemia develops?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you scolding people for? Isn\u2019t Leukemia a virus? A cold is a virus as well so what\u2019s the difference?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour mum. You really are retarded. I can\u2019t communicate with you at all. Come, let big brother here teach you some science. Leukemia develops because of the following reasons: Virus, hereditary factors, radioactive factors and chemical factors. Do you understand?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe that he can develop a prescription. If he can really develop a prescription, I\u2019ll do a live broadcast of me eating sh*t for you guys to see.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe it either. Does he really think that he is that awesome? After so many years, all the medical professionals in the world have not been able to find a solution and yet he thinks he will be able to?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The discussion on the internet was very intense. Regarding this situation, the majority of the people had their doubts. Also, many of them immediately decided that it was something impossible.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, some famous people had been moved by this and were showing their support on Weibo.</p><br/><p>A first-rate superstar: \u201cAll the best, Master Lin. Whether you succeed or not, you will always be awesome.\u201d</p><br/><p>A certain female celebrity: \u201cI hope that you will be successful in order to alleviate the pain of all those suffering from the illness.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p></div>\n</div>"}

Most people who came were the elderly.</p><br/><p>At that moment, in a certain apartment, the walls were plainly painted. On a long table, there were several computers, and a few men and women were working hard at the computers.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright. Another little brat has taken the bait!\u201d a man exclaimed excitedly. Then, he quickly opened another group chat and typed a price.</p><br/><p>\u201cSigh. This money is too easily earned. Kids nowadays are too easy to scam. Hahaha!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOur luck is pretty good. I wonder what happened to that brat I persuaded yesterday. It\u2019s probably too late for her to regret it now.\u201d</p><br/><p>When these incidents took place, they would usually not show themselves.</p><br/><p>They would get the customers to go themselves. Even if something bad happened, it would be the customers\u2019 problem. It would not concern them at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cRegret? There is nothing to regret. If there\u2019s anything to blame, it\u2019s their useless brains!\u201d</p><br/><p>Just as they were chattering.</p><br/><p>The room door was kicked open violently.</p><br/><p>A big group of policemen charged in.</p><br/><p>\u201cNobody move. Get down on your knees and put your hands behind your heads.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKneel down.\u201d</p><br/><p>When the policemen went in, they instantly suppressed those guys.</p><br/><p>At that moment, noises came from the another room.</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian immediately brought a few men with him and charged in. They dragged out a middle-aged man.</p><br/><p>\u201cCheck if there\u2019s anyone else hiding,\u201d ordered Liu Xiao Tian.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes sir.\u201d</p><br/><p>The policemen checked the whole apartment and confirmed that there was no one else.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, some other policemen started investigating the instruments of crime. On every computer, there were at least four chat groups open. Each of them contained a large chat history.</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian looked at the computers and said, \u201cMake a call to get more people here. We\u2019re going to bring all of these back and check them thoroughly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes sir.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan had been waiting outside the door the whole time. He had not gone in. This matter could be left to Liu Xiao Tian. Moreover, with him at the door, no one would be able to escape.</p><br/><p>If someone were to try to run, Lin Fan would just have to lift his leg and kick that person to the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, you\u2019re really incredible. Every single one of them is here,\u201d said Liu Xiao Tian with a smile. He had not expected this to be so simple.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cChief Liu, this matter is far from over. We still have to collect the evidence and you have to pay special attention to the kids in the chat groups. Although we\u2019ve caught a group of them, there may be other criminal groups out there.</p><br/><p>When Liu Xiao Tian heard that, he felt that Master Lin was right. \u201cYou\u2019re right, Master Lin. What happens next is most crucial. But we\u2019ve finally destroyed this nest and we can be a little relieved now. Let\u2019s see how the interrogation will go.\u201d</p><br/><p>Back at the police station</p><br/><p>A loud ruckus could be heard.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is going on?\u201d When Liu Xiao Tian heard it, his brows furrowed. When he went inside, he saw a middle-aged lady shouting.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you all doing? What has my husband done? What rights do you have to detain him? Let him go!\u201d</p><br/><p>The middle-aged lady yelled as she pointed at the policemen.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you doing? What are you doing, Lady?\u201d Liu Xiao Tian looked very displeased. This was the police station. How could someone cause such a ruckus here?</p><br/><p>\u201cChief Liu, this is Yang Dong\u2019s wife,\u201d said a policeman.</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian nodded. Then, he went in front of the woman and said, \u201cYour husband is suspected of having an affair with an underaged girl. We have to interrogate him. We didn\u2019t call you here to bring him back. It was to inform his family about this matter.\u201d</p><br/><p>The middle-aged woman yelled, \u201cUnderaged girl? Do you have evidence? Don\u2019t malign my husband! Let me tell you that I\u2019m not stupid!\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian had not expected this woman to be so unreasonable, and he didn\u2019t want to say more. Then, he got a policeman to take her away.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan walked in. \u201cChief Liu, the rest is up to you. There\u2019s nothing else for me to do here, is there?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say that, Master Lin. You can\u2019t go yet! We still need your help to interrogate him. And we need your help to check the computers too. We only know how to solve cases. We\u2019re not like you with computers,\u201d said Liu Xiao Tian.</p><br/><p>Although there were computer experts here, they were far from Master Lin\u2019s level. If Master Lin were to personally do it, everything would be solved.</p><br/><p>Especially since the little girl was still there, they had to resolve the matter quickly.</p><br/><p>\u201cChief Liu, once this matter is settled, how many years do you think he will be sentenced to?\u201d asked Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian was silent for a moment. \u201cThat\u2019s hard to say. We\u2019ll have to look at the bigger picture to determine it. It won\u2019t be less than three years.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded. \u201cOkay, you\u2019re the expert here. I\u2019m going to check the computers and see if there\u2019s anything on there.\u201d</p><br/><p>There wasn\u2019t much on the computers, and many files were password-protected. However, these things weren\u2019t urgent. He started viewing the messages in the chat record instead.</p><br/><p>\u201cChief Liu, come here for a moment. You have to take a look at this. There\u2019s another scam that\u2019s about to take place.\u201d After searching for a while, Lin Fan realized that there was a problem.</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian rushed over. He saw the message and took down the phone number inside. Then, he immediately told someone to check the address and name linked to it.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a lot going on here. There are so many people in the group. The complexity is quite high,\u201d said Liu Xiao Tian.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cIt is indeed. But we won\u2019t be able to find out if there are other accomplices.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, he continued searching and found quite a lot of information.</p><br/><p>There was a list with many phone numbers on it. There were even some digits at the end.</p><br/><p>\u201cChief Liu, go and ask about this. Find out what it is about exactly,\u201d said Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian looked at the computer screen and told someone to print it out. He went to the interrogation room with it. Not long after, he came back with a grave look on his face.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, this is all evidence. This is evidence that they have already succeeded. This is a record for them to keep track.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan had not expected this. He felt that it was really frustrating. However, he was doing his best. It couldn\u2019t be helped.</p><br/><p>He worked all the way until 6 PM. Finally, everything was prepared.</p><br/><p>\u201cChief Liu, I\u2019m going back first. Inform that girl\u2019s parents to bring her home. Remember not to let her parents hit her. Get them to speak to her about it. You guys will have to work overtime tonight. This is an important matter,\u201d said Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian nodded. \u201cMmm, don\u2019t worry. We will definitely resolve this matter.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan had done all he could. The rest was up to Liu Xiao Tian and the police.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

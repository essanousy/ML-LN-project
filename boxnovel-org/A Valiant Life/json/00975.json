This disaster had struck too quickly, so much so that they hadn\u2019t had the time to react at all.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-1\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Ma You Min, in particular, had no idea when Master Lin had appeared there.</p><br/><p>Also, he felt that it wasn\u2019t right. Master Lin was so famous, how could all these members be so stupid not to recognize him?</p><br/><p>He was so famous and he was a living, breathing person who had been standing right there. Could it be that those members only had mysterious elements on their minds and couldn\u2019t see this man standing right there?</p><br/><p>If he had known earlier, this wouldn\u2019t have happened.</p><br/><p>The police officers apprehended the main culprits and brought them onto the car.</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian went in front of Lin Fan. \u201cLittle Boss, you\u2019ve helped us crack down on a multi-level marketing organization.\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-2\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cEven my old friend from Cloud Street was tricked into joining, so I definitely had to save him. However, I didn\u2019t expect that there would be someone like him in the Chinese Medical Association. He knew that he was lying to people but he still involved himself in it. Isn\u2019t he just bringing shame to Chinese medicine?\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian nodded. Then, he looked at the dumbfounded members. Perhaps even now, they hadn\u2019t come to the realization of what had happened yet.</p><br/><p>At that moment, some members regained their senses.</p><br/><p>\u201cScam? This was a scam?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow could it be? We were involved in multi-level marketing? Isn\u2019t this scientifically proven?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already spent hundreds of thousands. This\u2026this\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, an old auntie grabbed Liu Xiao Tian\u2019s hand. \u201cOfficer, you have to help me. I\u2019ve already invested hundreds of thousands.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian sighed but nodded. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. We, the police, will look into this properly. We will trace back the money that everyone has lost. We guarantee that we will minimize everyone\u2019s losses as much as possible.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-3\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Those townsfolk who had awoken from their daze couldn\u2019t believe that they had really been cheated. To them, it was too big of a blow.</p><br/><p>But luckily, the police had come in time to catch the culprits. They also had some hope of getting back the money that they had lost.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan came to Elder Wang\u2019s front. He said in a surprised tone, \u201cElder Wang, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Wang had a look of astonishment on his face. His eyes gaped as he pointed at himself. \u201cLittle Boss, you mean that I\u2019ve been tricked?\u201d Then, he said with a little more emotion, \u201cI\u2019ve been tricked into multi-level marketing?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan comforted him, \u201cElder Wang, don\u2019t be too emotional. Being tricked is very normal.\u201d</p><br/><p>He was really afraid that Elder Wang wouldn\u2019t be able to take this blow. He might be emotionally scarred.</p><br/><p>Elder Wang said, \u201cHow can this happen? I was prepared to learn more and even bring you all to join. Now that this is multi-level marketing, won\u2019t I be laughed at by them? Little Boss, you didn\u2019t tell anyone about this, did you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was stunned. He hadn\u2019t expected that Elder Wang was worried about this. Then, he thought for a few seconds before replying seriously, \u201cNo, don\u2019t worry. In the whole of Cloud Street, besides me, not another person knows.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good, that\u2019s good.\u201d Elder Wang heaved a sigh of relief. If this matter wouldn\u2019t be spread, he could still accept it.</p><br/><p>But if it were to be spread, he felt that he really wouldn\u2019t be able to take it.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-4\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>It was too f*cking embarrassing. He was so old but he had still gotten tricked.</p><br/><p>Seeing Elder Wang\u2019s expression, Lin Fan sighed helplessly as well. There were already several people who knew about this back at Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>It seemed that he would have to talk to everyone when he went back and tell them to pretend not to know about this. They should let this matter end just like this.</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian patted Lin Fan\u2019s shoulder. \u201cLittle Boss, you\u2019re a Chinese medicine master too. Why don\u2019t you give them a lesson?\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Wang slapped his thigh. \u201cThat\u2019s right. Little Boss, give us a lesson so that we\u2019ll be more wary in the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>Many of these townsfolk who had been scammed knew Lin Fan. As for his other titles, they might not have known but they knew that Master Lin was a Chinese medicine master.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, Master Lin, help us by telling us more.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t expect that this was multi-level marketing. Luckily, the police arrived early. If you arrived any later, who knows how much money we would have lost?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah! Thank you so much, police officers. Thank you so much, Master Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking at the eager expressions of the crowd, Lin Fan couldn\u2019t refuse. Since it was like this, he decided to give them a lesson. However, if he followed how things had been going previously, with his Wuxia class of knowledge, he really would be able to do things with the mysterious elements in the surroundings.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, since it\u2019s like this, I shall give everyone a lesson on maintaining your health using Chinese medicine,\u201d said Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Elder Wang was the first to applaud. Liu Xiao tian was quite interested as well. If it had been any other lesson, he definitely wouldn\u2019t have had any interest but as for Little Boss\u2019s lesson, he was very interested.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-5\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>The other police officers were detaining the culprits while Liu Xiao Tian and the rest just sat there.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan went on stage and thought for a moment before speaking, \u201cI shan\u2019t waste too much time. I\u2019ll just speak a little about maintaining your health using Chinese medicine. There are many ways of maintaining one\u2019s health and this is related to wealth as well. Think about it. If you live longer, wouldn\u2019t you be able to earn more money?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen you wake up in the morning, don\u2019t be in a hurry to get up. Lie down and stretch your limbs out. Stretch your muscles and tendons so that they warm up\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>These things he was talking about were just minor things. They were some of the easier things to do to maintain one\u2019s health. This was one of the ways that one could maintain one\u2019s health in the morning when waking up.</p><br/><p>After about half an hour, Lin Fan felt that he was about done. At that point, he decided to stop speaking.</p><br/><p>But the townsfolk were all relishing the lesson. They felt that it made a lot of sense and they wanted to listen further.</p><br/><p>However, since Master Lin didn\u2019t want to speak anymore, they were saddened.</p><br/><p>If Master Lin were to start a class like this, they would be willing to come every day.</p><br/><p>Outside the conference room.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cInspector Liu, I\u2019ll have to trouble you with this matter.\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-6\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian nodded. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. This is our responsibility. Nowadays, there are too many of these multi-level marketing organizations. Most of them are hidden on the Internet and within the citizens. They are hard to catch and we can only rely on the public\u2019s reports.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis time, we don\u2019t know how much money was involved but we\u2019ll definitely do all we can to get the money back to their rightful owners.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded. \u201cAlright then. I shan\u2019t disturb your investigations anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xiao Tian waved at Lin Fan before leaving. He had to hurry back to the police station to start interrogating those culprits and track down the money.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Right now, the important thing for Lin Fan to do was to thank Chief Liu.</p><br/><p>This time, if Chief Liu hadn\u2019t told him about the situation through the phone, perhaps Elder Wang would have fallen deeper into the trap for an even longer time.</p><br/><p>Very soon, he found Liu Xu.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was all smiles as he said, \u201cChief Liu, I am really grateful to you this time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Xu glanced at Lin Fan. \u201cThere\u2019s no need for thanks. But if there are opportunities in the future, recommend more guests to come here.\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-7\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cHehe, Chief Liu, you really are unscrupulous. You aren\u2019t courteous at all,\u201d Lin Fan said with a grin.</p><br/><p>Liu Xu replied, \u201cWith you, Master Lin, I can\u2019t be courteous. Once I\u2019m courteous with you, I\u2019ll lose out greatly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved his hand. \u201cAlright, alright. You\u2019re right, Chief Liu. I\u2019ll have opportunities in the future to bring guests to you. I\u2019m leaving now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Xu looked at Lin Fan\u2019s back view as he left. Then, she stopped herself from thinking too much and got back to work.</p></div>\n</div>"}

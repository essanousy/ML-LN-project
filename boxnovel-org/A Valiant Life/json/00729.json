They didn\u2019t necessarily have to sing well, but they did have to have a certain level of musical competency. Otherwise, it would have been a huge waste of time for the judges if they were to audition every single contestant.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, some of them might even sing terribly, bringing down the quality of the program.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis handsome young man here looks a little nervous,\u201d the TV host said from the side.</p><br/><p>The audience members all started laughing.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood evening, Teachers. My name is Huang Fei. I\u2019m 26 this year. I come from Ji Lin and I am a freelancer,\u201d Huang Fei said, clasping onto his guitar tightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou look like a very energetic young man,\u201d Zhao Li said into her microphone.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you, Teacher,\u201d Huang Fei replied in a very respectful manner.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, you may begin anytime you\u2019re comfortable,\u201d Huo Jian Xiang said.</p><br/><p>Instead of starting to sing, Huang Fei looked as if he wanted to say something. Thereafter, he clenched his teeth, mustering up all the courage he had. \u201cTeachers, before I start singing, I just want to say something.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although Liu Ying Dong had been angered by Lin Fan before he got on stage, he appeared calm and collected after walking out onto the stage. \u201cAlright, say what you want to say,\u201d Liu Ying Dong said.</p><br/><p>Huang Fei straightened his posture, \u201cI come from a small district from Ji Lin and I grew up in a single parent family. My father passed away when I was a little kid, and my mother struggled to bring me up. When I was fifteen, my mum had contracted an illness and it was around the same time my passion for music reignited. I am here in this competition to give my very best and I hope to be able to win enough money to pay for my mother\u2019s medical bills.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, I know that using music to earn money isn\u2019t the ideal music in my heart. But this compared to my mother\u2019s health is way less important. I hope that she\u2019ll be able to see the day when I get married and have children. For someone who hasn\u2019t enjoyed anything good in her life, I hope that I\u2019ll be able to bring her that joy.\u201d</p><br/><p>After Huang Fei finished saying that, the audience members all propped themselves up.</p><br/><p>As a female, Zhao Li was moved to tears after hearing Huang Fei recount his story, \u201cI never imagined you would come with that story. What a strong mother-figure. Although music is pure in itself, you have a heart for your mother, and that is more important than anything else.\u201d</p><br/><p>Applause!</p><br/><p>The crowd went wild.</p><br/><p>Online.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn, Zhao Li is so sexy. I think I am in love.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t imagine the things that this guy has gone through. If he doesn\u2019t sing too badly, I\u2019m going to support him all the way.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat Zhao Li said was good.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan furrowed his brows as he looked at Huang Fei, analyzing his clothing and the guitar that he was holding between his hands.</p><br/><p>Although he wasn\u2019t a detective, he could tell that the guitar wasn\u2019t an ordinary one.</p><br/><p>The brand of the guitar was a world-renowned one, and the price of the guitar was probably in the range of the ten thousands.</p><br/><p>If his hunch was correct, there was something seriously wrong with what he was seeing and his story.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Huang Fei started his performance, \u201cThe song I want to sing is \u2018My future\u2019.\u201d</p><br/><p>He started playing his guitar.</p><br/><p>The three teachers were absorbed in his music.</p><br/><p>In their opinion, Huang Fei\u2019s voice wasn\u2019t too bad. His voice was good, but there were definitely things that he could work on. With sufficient training, it had the potential of becoming better.</p><br/><p>Damn, the first contestant is so talented already. This show is really good.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. If every single contestant is like this, our ears will be blessed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat a beautiful sound. His voice has the ability to cut through, and there is emotion in his voice.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh, Master Lin is staring at him. It looks like this contestant is about to be selected.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, Lin Fan was staring at the contestant who was on stage, and he was cursing in his heart.</p><br/><p>The first contestant pulled off such a good move in telling his tragic backstory.</p><br/><p>However, something wasn\u2019t right. Both the parents of the contestant were still alive and healthy. The only thing that was true was that he was from Ji Lin.</p><br/><p>The song ended.</p><br/><p>Huang Fei took a bow towards the teachers, thereafter looking at them with expectant eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cI like your voice, and I am moved by your backstory. Take me as your teacher, and I will teach you well, and maybe, you can even win this competition,\u201d Zhao Li said.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou sing well. Although there are some parts that need work, you are perfect from a professional perspective. Your voice cuts through the crowd and is unique. However, Zhao Li has selected you already, so I won\u2019t steal you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Huo Jian Xiang didn\u2019t press his buzzer. He had a more stringent requirement for a singing voice. Although this contestant\u2019s voice was penetrating, he also had other criteria which his voice didn\u2019t meet.</p><br/><p>At this moment, everyone\u2019s eyes were on Lin Fan. They didn\u2019t know if Master Lin was going to press his buzzer. Zhao Li thought that Master Lin was going to steal the contestant away from her hands.</p><br/><p>Everyone wanted to see that catfight badly.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, what do you think? Do you have anything to say to this contestant?\u201d Zhao Li asked Lin Fan eccentrically.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled, thereafter straightening himself up, \u201cBefore I get to that, I want to say that it is okay for females to be emotionally moved by a touching story. However, we must be logical over here. What do you think about the contestant\u2019s backstory?\u201d</p><br/><p>The crowd was stunned. They didn\u2019t know what Master Lin was getting at.</p><br/><p>From their perspective, the backstory of the contestant was simply too touching. Some of them even started tearing, sympathizing with his recount of himself.</p><br/><p>Zhao Li didn\u2019t know where Lin Fan was getting at, but she still replied. \u201cHis story was so heartbreaking. I want to help him, plus his voice is good. It\u2019s the voice that I like.\u201d</p><br/><p>After hearing what she had to say, Lin Fan waved his hands, \u201cThis contestant, you can pack your bags and go home. You aren\u2019t good for this competition.\u201d</p><br/><p>After the crowd heard what Lin Fan said, they were completely dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>What was going on?</p><br/><p>The workers were all perplexed. The program had just started, and there was already something happening.</p><br/><p>Huang Fei looked back at Lin Fan, his eyes showing signs of panic. He looked unsteady as if he had been seen through by him.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher Lin, what do you mean? I don\u2019t know what conflict you have with this contestant, but you can\u2019t just follow your personal judgment to ask a contestant with dreams to leave the stage. Although you may agree with it, I will never agree with it,\u201d Zhao Li said.</p><br/><p>After saying that, Zhao Li stood up immediately, staring at Lin Fan. Her expression clearly said that she wanted to fight with Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>The people who were watching the live broadcast all started discussing the matter.</p><br/><p>\u201cZhao Li is just too good.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYea, on what grounds does Teacher Lin have to kick this guy out?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDoes Teacher Lin have some kind of prior conflict with the contestant?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe contestant sang pretty well, and Teacher Lin just asked him to leave. This isn\u2019t right.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you guys panicking? Master Lin definitely has his reasons for saying that. You guys should hear him out before flaming him.\u201d</p><br/><p>The people who had asked for the people to wait for Master Lin\u2019s explanation were his fans. They had been repeatedly shocked by Master Lin in the past, and they had sworn never to sneer at Master Lin again to prevent getting shocked again.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p></div>\n</div>"}

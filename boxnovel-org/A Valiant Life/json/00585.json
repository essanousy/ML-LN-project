But don\u2019t tell me yet, let me guess. You\u2019re getting promoted, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian chuckled, \u201cI didn\u2019t really get promoted. My appointment didn\u2019t change but my ranking rose slightly. But enough talk about that, look at this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan instantly became delighted. \u201cI don\u2019t just get a Good Citizen Award this time but I even get a banner? That\u2019s amazing!\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian said, \u201cOf course. Now, every police station in Shanghai knows your great name. You\u2019re even more well-known that our police stations\u2019 own people now. The leader of the Third Drug Enforcement Team even wanted to recruit you but I immediately refused on your behalf.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha,\u201d Lin Fan laughed. Sometimes, it isn\u2019t good to be too capable. It is easy for people to keep thinking about you if you are too capable.</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian exchanged some small talk with Lin Fan. Then, he started to talk about proper business, \u201cI haven\u2019t forgotten what you asked of me. I\u2019ve taken care of everything. The day after tomorrow, there will be an Honors Ceremony. As the main contributor, you must participate. You\u2019ll have to go on stage to receive the award. Of course, the cash award will not be small. For this great service, the organization has decided to award you with $200,000.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was startled, \u201cThey\u2019re so generous?\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian said, \u201cThey\u2019ve always been so generous. That day, reporters will be present as well. We have to make some announcements. Sometimes, the information provided by the public comes quicker than what we police find through our investigations.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat is true.\u201d Lin Fan nodded. Although the police force was very specialized, they can\u2019t compare to the eyes of the public. The public has sharp eyes. Even a small action by criminals cannot escape their eyes.</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian waved his hand, \u201cI\u2019ve told you everything that I should. Remember to come on time in two days.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cDo I still need to wear that monkey mask?\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian laughed, \u201cWhy would you still need to wear it? The reporters have already exposed you. No need.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled, \u201cI don\u2019t think I need it either. I did a good thing and I should be open and proud about it. Moreover, this is Shanghai. I don\u2019t need to be afraid of anyone taking revenge on me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian raised his thumb, then left the place.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>At that moment, Fraud Tian looked enviously at Lin Fan and said, \u201cYet another Good Citizen Award and even a banner. I\u2019m really dying of jealousy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan held it in his hands and looked closely at it. \u201cNot bad. We\u2019ll hang it in the shop.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang said, \u201cBrother Lin, you have too many Good Citizen Awards. Could it be that you want to fill the whole shop with them?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI do have such thoughts,\u201d Lin Fan said with a smiled, \u201cBut there is still a long way to go. I need to work harder and keep taking down criminals in order to decorate our little shop.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAwesome!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang was at a loss for words and could only say that it was amazing. Only Brother Lin could dare to think of something like that. No average person would dare to have such thoughts.</p><br/><p>After all, how would they come across so many bad people?</p><br/><p>At that moment, Zhao Ming Qing\u2019s call came.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello, Ming Qing. What\u2019s up?\u201d Lin Fan asked.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing said, \u201cTeacher, are you busy right now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cI\u2019m not. Is there something going on?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing was acting mysteriously, \u201cNo. I will be reaching Cloud Street soon. Come with me to a certain place.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGo where? Why are you acting so mysteriously?\u201d Lin Fan couldn\u2019t figure it out even if he wrecked his brain thinking.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing, \u201cYour student will be reaching soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>Soon after.</p><br/><p>A car stopped outside the shop. Zhao Ming Qing got out from the car. \u201cTeacher, let\u2019s get in the car.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was curious. \u201cWhat are you doing? Why are you acting so mysteriously?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, you\u2019ll know if you follow me.\u201d Zhao Ming Qing didn\u2019t say it but he was filled with anticipation. When his teacher sees it, he would definitely be happy.</p><br/><p>Seeing how Zhao Ming Qing wouldn\u2019t say it, Lin Fan was helpless as well. He boarded the car. The driver seemed to know where they were going. In the car, Lin Fan asked once more but Zhao Ming Qing still refused to say it. All he said was that Lin Fan would know once they reached.</p><br/><p>At a storehouse.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing\u2019s mysterious behavior made Lin Fan very curious. Lin Fan said, \u201cI have to see what it is that you\u2019re being so mysterious about.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, don\u2019t be too shocked when you see it,\u201d said Zhao Ming Qing.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, your teacher isn\u2019t so easily shocked.\u201d</p><br/><p>They entered the storehouse.</p><br/><p>There was something being covered by a red cloth. It looked tall. It wasn\u2019t big but it wasn\u2019t small either. It was as tall as a person.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at it and his breathing suddenly became quicker. He couldn\u2019t help but want to take a look.</p><br/><p>He lifted the cloth.</p><br/><p>Upon lifting it off, an alchemy furnace appeared before him.</p><br/><p>This alchemy furnace wasn\u2019t an exhibition item. It was an authentic alchemy furnace that was used in ancient times to concoct pills.</p><br/><p>At that moment Lin Fan said in shock, \u201cMing Qing, this\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing said with a smile, \u201cTeacher, this is your student\u2019s gift to you. I know that you have been looking for an alchemy furnace, so I personally went to a Daoist shrine to get one for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan didn\u2019t say anything. He touched the alchemy furnace in front of him. This was an alchemy furnace with history. \u201cDaoist shrine? How did you get it? It must not have been cheap.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing smiled, \u201cDo you like it, Teacher? As long as you like it, then it\u2019s worth it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan patted Zhao Ming Qing on the shoulder and said emotionally, \u201cI like it, I really like it a lot. I never thought that you would remember this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although Zhao Ming Qing was old enough to be Lin Fan\u2019s grandfather, he had seen himself as a student ever since he started learning Chinese medicine from Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour student always remembers things about you, Teacher. I heard a good friend say that if I\u2019m looking for an alchemy furnace, I can go look at the Daoist shrine, so I left Shanghai to go and look for it. I finally found it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan had nothing to say at this moment. He kept patting Zhao Ming Qing\u2019s shoulder, saying, \u201cGood, not bad at all. You\u2019ve put in a lot of thought.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing smiled happily, \u201cIf my teacher likes it, then that\u2019s good.\u201d</p><br/><p>Attaining this alchemy furnace hadn\u2019t been simple. But in this society, anything could be done if you had money.</p><br/><p>Although he had paid a huge price, at least he managed to get it.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the alchemy furnace and was filled with incomparable joy. With this alchemy furnace, those perfect little intelligence pills would be in his grasps.</p><br/><p>Those pressure cookers paled in comparison to this. They were simply incomparable.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Lin Fan couldn\u2019t wait any longer.</p><br/><p>\u201cMing Qing, we can concoct pills now,\u201d Lin Fan said excitedly.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing nodded excitedly as well. This was the first time he had seen his teacher so excited.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was really thrilled. He had never expected to really get an alchemy furnace. He couldn\u2019t wait to start creating pills. It was as if those perfect little intelligence pills were waving towards him right now.</p><br/><p>Just thinking about it was extremely thrilling.</p><br/><p>And although the ingredients were a little expensive, it was all worth it.</p><br/><p>During the recent period, he had saved some money. This money was enough for him to create pills.</p><br/><p>With the Encyclopedia\u2019s mystical boost, he would definitely be able to do it without fail.</p><br/><p>Thinking about it was a little scary.</p></div>\n</div>"}

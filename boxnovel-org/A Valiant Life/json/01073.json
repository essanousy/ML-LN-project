No one can compare to him.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018This is something that has never happened before. It has left many people wondering if this is still the same sport that they used to know.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Master Lin, please stop hiding things from us. What else do you know? Tell us all of it at once.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Perhaps this man will haunt the Yokohama F. Marinos forever.\u2019</p><br/><p>When these articles were released, countless people who didn\u2019t watch football were drawn in because these titles were pretty good. They were very domineering and they made people want to read on.</p><br/><p>When the netizens saw these articles, one by one, they all went crazy.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn! Can someone tell me whether this is true?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin? Don\u2019t f*cking tease me. Is this for real?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat goalkeeper from yesterday\u2019s match was Master Lin?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow is that possible? Why would Master Lin appear there?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is true. Even Wu Ze has personally admitted it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut this is too domineering, isn\u2019t it? Number one in the world\u2026 That\u2019s too much.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c^you weren\u2019t at the scene. If you were, you would know that that isn\u2019t an exaggeration at all. He was just that dominant.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, on the forums, chat groups, and Weibo, this matter regarding Master Lin was circulating.</p><br/><p>In particular, many people had taken those GIFs and edited them, adding words.</p><br/><p>For example, to that GIF of Lin Fan tossing the ball back to Tanaka Hiroshi, someone added the words: \u2018Here\u2019s another chance for you to do better.\u2019</p><br/><p>The netizens took several images and played around by editing them. They even sent these edited images to various groups and spread them.</p><br/><p>Some netizens, who hadn\u2019t paid much attention to this, saw the images and were very curious. They wondered where these images came from and why they were so brilliant.</p><br/><p>On a Japanese website.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Yokohama F. Marinos actually lost. That\u2019s not possible.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI saw the match. That Chinese goalkeeper was really terrifying. He\u2019s simply a demon.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s him. It\u2019s him again.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis guy\u2019s table tennis skills are amazing as well. He defeated our champion and, even now, our champion hasn\u2019t recovered. This Chinese man is too terrifying.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe have to protest. This person is clearly hacking. He\u2019s breaking the rules of the game.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. I won\u2019t watch any competitions that he participates in in the future because he\u2019s simply a demon.\u201d</p><br/><p>To these Japanese football fans, this was really unbelievable. Their favorite football team had been completely thrashed by this person.</p><br/><p>Moreover, they had already received the broadcast of the match. Those who had watched it were all speechless. They felt that it was too embarrassing and shameful.</p><br/><p>Cloud Street!</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was in the shop and the shop owners started gathering.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Boss, you\u2019re defying nature.\u201d Elder Liang\u2019s expression was one of astonishment. He had seen the news and he hadn\u2019t expected that Little Boss could be so domineering. Little Boss had gone to play football and even created such a miracle. How had the news put it?</p><br/><p>The number one goalkeeper in the world. Much better than the other top goalkeepers in the world. This was a huge honor.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan sighed helplessly. He hadn\u2019t expected this incident to cause such a huge stir. But the good thing was that the reporters gave him face. They must have known that he was very busy so they didn\u2019t come to interview him.</p><br/><p>But soon after he thought of that, an astonishing thing happened.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin\u2026\u201d In the distance, a group of reporters charged over while carrying their cameras. When the townsfolk saw this, they were all dumbfounded. <em>This is too f*cking vicious!</em></p><br/><p>The reporters flew over like a hurricane.</p><br/><p><em>D*mn. I was just praising you guys but you\u2019ve come here yet again. I\u2019ll never praise you again in the future. Speak of the devil indeed. </em>Lin Fan was cursing in his heart. He hadn\u2019t expected this at all.</p><br/><p>In an instant, the reporters completely surrounded the shop. These reporters were all sports reporters, not the usual reporters who interviewed Lin Fan for random gossip.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, how did you learn your goalkeeping skills?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, are you going to enter the sports industry?\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporters were maniacally asking questions one by one. Some of them had even climbed onto the table, wanting badly to get something out of Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t push, don\u2019t push. Everyone, calm down,\u201d Lin Fan shouted as he backed off.</p><br/><p>In his life, he had never been afraid of anyone else, but he was afraid of these reporters. These reporters would disregard all else in order to obtain news.</p><br/><p><em>Look at this guy. He\u2019s so f*cking graceful that he has climbed onto the table. In order to obtain news, these people will think of all sorts of ways.</em></p><br/><p><em>And look at that guy. He\u2019s using his buff body to push through everyone else.</em></p><br/><p>The surrounding shop owners backed off frantically. Regarding this incident, they looked as if they didn\u2019t want any part of it.</p><br/><p>They had seen reporters many times before but the reporters this time looked unfamiliar. And looking at their names, the shop owners understood that these were sports reporters.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, voices echoed from the distance once again. A group of entertainment reporters could be seen approaching the shop. One of them cried out in surprise, \u201cD*mn! We\u2019re late. They reached here earlier than us. Brothers, charge forward with me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was completely dumbfounded. <em>What the heck are you all doing? Are you trying to defy nature?</em></p><br/><p><em>Aren\u2019t you afraid of ruining my shop?</em></p><br/><p>\u201cNobody move\u2026\u201d Lin Fan didn\u2019t think too much. For his own safety, he bellowed loudly and he even incorporated a bit of his power into that shout.</p><br/><p>This voice exploded in the reporters\u2019 ears and left them in a daze. It was simply terrifying.</p><br/><p>Then, each of them just stood there obediently, looking at Master Lin with wide eyes. They hadn\u2019t expected Master Lin\u2019s voice to be so loud, to be able to shake all of them.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan raised his hand. \u201cMy dear reporters, please proceed outside. If you have questions, ask them one by one. We\u2019ll just have a simple press conference today, okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLook. If you behave like this, you won\u2019t be able to interview me at all. Moreover, a stampede could easily happen. If someone gets injured, it wouldn\u2019t be worth it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan spoke slowly and firmly, trying to guide the situation.</p><br/><p>The reporters nodded as they felt that Master Lin made sense. One of the reporters who was amidst the crowd cried out, \u201cGive me some space, I can\u2019t breathe!\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, the reporters all exited the shop.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the shop owners and said, \u201cBring some chairs over for the reporters to sit down. We\u2019ll talk slowly. Let\u2019s not be impulsive. Impulse is a devil.\u201d</p><br/><p>He was really afraid.</p><br/><p>Regarding yesterday\u2019s incident, he really felt helpless.</p></div>\n</div>"}

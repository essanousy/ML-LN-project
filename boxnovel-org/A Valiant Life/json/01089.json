And they want me to taste their milk?</em></p><br/><p><em>That\u2019s rather complicated. Do they want me to just drink milk in my shop all day and critique them on the Internet? If that\u2019s the case, then something isn\u2019t right.</em></p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the crowd. \u201cThis is\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>*Tear*</p><br/><p>At that moment, the representative from Mengniu Milk tore open the box of milk and took out a bottle. He stuck a straw into the bottle opening and placed it in front of Lin Fan. \u201cMaster Lin, please try it. Our milk is produced from specially-cultivated cows. We are a morally upright Chinese milk company.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the representative\u2019s expression. It seemed as if he would be hurt if Lin Fan didn\u2019t drink it.</p><br/><p>In the end, Lin Fan had no choice but to pick it up and drink a mouthful of milk.</p><br/><p>The man looked eagerly at Master Lin. \u201cHow is it? It definitely doesn\u2019t have a problem, does it? The grass fed to our cows are all stringently selected. We definitely won\u2019t add any harmful substances.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMmm, it\u2019s not bad indeed. There are no problems.\u201d Lin Fan nodded and confirmed that he had indeed tried it.</p><br/><p>\u201cPhew!\u201d the representative from Mengniu let out a breath of air. \u201cI told you. We\u2019re not like Tianshu Milk. We are a morally upright enterprise.\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporters recorded this scene.</p><br/><p>Although they didn\u2019t know how exactly Master Lin\u2019s mouth could identify toxins, they really believed the Tianshu Milk incident.</p><br/><p>Yili\u2019s representative quickly tore opened their box of milk as well and she passed it to Master Lin.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan stood there dumbfoundedly. Then, he drank it and nodded. \u201cMmm. No problems.\u201d</p><br/><p>The lady smiled. \u201cI told you. Our product definitely won\u2019t have any problems either. Master Lin, could you become our exclusive tester? You won\u2019t have to go to work, we\u2019ll just send you some newly-produced milk samples regularly. If there are any problems, you can say so on Weibo. We are very willing to accept criticism.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at her and felt like things were getting a little out of hand. \u201cIs there such a need?\u201d</p><br/><p>The lady immediately nodded. \u201cThere is. The headquarters feel this way as well. Our headquarters have exceptional trust in Master Lin\u2019s testing abilities.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan blinked several times as he felt that this was f*cking mystical. It had all started with a single sip of milk. Now, things had gotten to a point that he had not expected at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s our turn now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d</p><br/><p>The sales representatives at the back shouted eagerly. It was as if their milk wouldn\u2019t be trusted by others if Master Lin didn\u2019t taste it first.</p><br/><p>The reporters were recording this from the side. This was the first time they had seen something like this. They felt that it was really f*cking mystical to the point that they couldn\u2019t believe it.</p><br/><p>But thinking about it, it made sense. Since Master Lin was such a f*cking awesome person, something like this was perfectly normal.</p><br/><p>They just stood silently at the side, recording this whole scene.</p><br/><p>The surrounding shop owners gathered around as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn. Little Boss will have lots of milk from now on.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. In the future, if we want to drink milk, we can just get some from Master Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOur Cloud Street is getting more and more popular. I wonder if you all have noticed this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI realized that a long time ago. There have been more and more guests that come here. And it seems like many of them aren\u2019t from around here. I heard that our Cloud Street has already been named as one of the must-see places when people visit Shanghai.</p><br/><p>\u201cA while ago, someone offered $600,000 a year to rent my shop. I rejected the offer. Even if the price is higher, I wouldn\u2019t agree.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOur Cloud Street has become so popular all thanks to Master Lin. If Master Lin wasn\u2019t here, our Cloud Street wouldn\u2019t be this popular for sure.\u201d</p><br/><p>The shop owners discussed amongst themselves. They were now very content with their lives.</p><br/><p>After all, they had a god next to them, protecting them.</p><br/><p>It even made them feel as if they must\u2019ve saved the world in their past lives, leading to them being able to become neighbors of Master Lin on Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>After some time, the reporters left. Those sales representatives left as well.</p><br/><p>What they left behind were several tens of boxes of milk.</p><br/><p>Looking at all this milk, Lin Fan was a little dazed. He had no idea what to do with all this milk.</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t possibly sell the milk.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian laughed. He appeared to be in a delightful mood. \u201cIt seems like we\u2019ll have as much milk as we want to drink next time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang was broadcasting. The netizens in the broadcast room were flabbergasted. They had never seen something like this before and they were spamming 6666\u2026</p><br/><p>After all, that was the only way to release the shock in their hearts.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan felt that he had to do something about all this milk. Then, he turned to the surrounding crowd and said, \u201cIf any of you want milk, hurry up and grab some. How long would I take to finish all this?\u201d</p><br/><p>The shop owners burst into laughter. \u201cLittle Boss, you\u2019re really too awesome.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. I\u2019ve lived to such an age but I\u2019ve never seen anything like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the crowd and grumbled in his heart. <em>Even I\u2019ve never seen anything like this.</em></p><br/><p>The next day!</p><br/><p>The news was released.</p><br/><p>The netizens started discussing it.</p><br/><p>\u201cMengniu is safe. Everyone can drink it without worrying.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYili is safe too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMmm. If Master Lin says it\u2019s safe, there definitely aren\u2019t any problems. F*ck. This has really given me a scare.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mengniu\u2019s official Weibo\u2019s description changed as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cEven Master Lin says it\u2019s safe. You can drink our milk with no worries.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yili: \u201cWe are a morally upright enterprise. Even Master Lin says our milk is good. There definitely aren\u2019t any problems.\u201d</p><br/><p>When the netizens saw this situation, they were dazed.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy do I suddenly feel as if Master Lin has been bought over by them?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. These companies are too cunning.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut I can tell that these companies are very resolute. I support our local companies and I\u2019ll only be drinking Mengniu from now on. I shan\u2019t drink Tianshu Milk for now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang saw the news on Weibo and started laughing loudly. \u201cBrother Lin, look at this. You\u2019ve become a brand ambassador for so many milk companies all of a sudden. This is something that many people would be envious of.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the situation on Weibo and scratched his head. He didn\u2019t know what to say.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen shouldn\u2019t I charge them a fee for this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang nodded. \u201cMmm. If you say the word, they would definitely have to pay you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian said, \u201cBut aren\u2019t they already sending you boxes of milk every month? Isn\u2019t that their payment already?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn. How can someone as great as Brother Lin be paid with just a few boxes of milk?\u201d Zhao Zhong Yang said.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shook his head and stopped thinking about this. Right now, his stomach was filled with milk and he even had a slight urge to puke.</p><br/><p><em>I\u2019ll never drink milk again.</em></p></div>\n</div>"}

They had dumbfounded looks on their faces as they stared at Lin Fan in awe.</p><br/><p>The association members, in particular, felt as if they were in a dream. It didn\u2019t seem realistic. It could even be said to be surreal.</p><br/><p>They now understood that President Lin had not been boasting.</p><br/><p>In the car, President Lin had said calmly that he knew a little of everything. But it was not just a little. He actually knew everything and he had complete knowledge of each martial art. The venue had been completely dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan turned his head and looked at everyone else\u2019s stunned expressions. He couldn\u2019t help but laugh. \u201cWhat\u2019s up with all of you? Why are you all looking at me like that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian couldn\u2019t take it anymore. \u201cHow on earth did you train? Why do you know everything? It\u2019s not possible. It\u2019s just not possible.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan patted Fraud Tian on the shoulder and said helplessly, \u201cFraud, I know that it\u2019s a big blow to you. But just get used to it. Don\u2019t let it bother you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian\u2019s mouth twitched. These words had too big of an impact on him. He even had an urge to just die.</p><br/><p>Even though it was alright for there to be differences between different people, it couldn\u2019t be such a huge difference. This was simply too hard to accept.</p><br/><p>Jiang Fei\u2019s body started trembling in excitement. \u201cPresident Lin, this time, our association is going to become really well-known.\u201d</p><br/><p>He was really excited.</p><br/><p>This time, they had come to the exchange meet to follow along and take in the atmosphere. But now, after President Lin had performed on stage, the whole place had been shocked. He couldn\u2019t imagine what this would bring in the future.</p><br/><p>Wang Yun Jie was the same. He was the chairman of the Yang Tai Chi group. In the association, he was considered a master. But during the exchange meet, facing all those people from around the world, he really didn\u2019t dare to call himself a master.</p><br/><p>After all, he couldn\u2019t compare to the others at all. Those people were professionals. Meanwhile, he was just a normal person.</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang looked at the broadcast room. The comments section had gone crazy for a long while. Initially, there had been about 300,000 spectators but after these few hours, it had risen up to over 2,000,000.</p><br/><p>These were real numbers. There was no point in faking them.</p><br/><p>Even now, those people hadn\u2019t left the broadcast room. They were still inside discussing.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn. This has really changed my long-standing views. I never thought that there was someone who really knew kung fu.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you see the competition? Those were all people who know real kung fu. They\u2019ve probably never appeared on television.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. They\u2019re all inheritors of kung fu. They inherited their kung fu through their clans and they don\u2019t teach it to outsiders. They only pass it down through generations in their families. They\u2019re much more powerful than those people who frequently appear on television.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut it would be useless even if they were even more powerful. Master Lin single-handedly shocked everyone. He\u2019s too f*cking insane. I watched for a few hours straight. Master Lin\u2019s exhibition was way too dashing and too domineering.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, he\u2019s way too imposing. With one look, you can tell it\u2019s amazing kung fu. Moreover, it was visually appealing. Perhaps only Master Lin can give such a performance.\u201d</p><br/><p>In the broadcast room, the netizens kept posting comments. Meanwhile, Zhao Zhong Yang had received close to a million dollars of gifts in this short period of time. It was really scary.</p><br/><p>To put things into perspective, it was as if one out of every two viewers had donated one dollar.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan was thinking about what would happen later on. \u201cBrother Lin, do you think they will come and look for you later?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled. \u201cI think so. Alright, let\u2019s go and eat. There\u2019s another session in the afternoon, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian said, \u201cMy a*s. After you went on stage, how could there still be a session in the afternoon? I think they\u2019re probably going to come after you soon. Let\u2019s go and eat first.\u201d</p><br/><p>After finding a restaurant, they sat inside. At that moment, it was completely empty. Everyone was still on the mountain and hadn\u2019t come down yet.</p><br/><p>They ordered a few dishes. Since there was no one, the dishes were served very quickly.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, let\u2019s eat,\u201d said Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>At that moment, a very loud noise came from outside.</p><br/><p>The restaurant owner was curious. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Why is there so much noise?\u201d</p><br/><p>Even the waiters had no idea what was happening. But when they went to the entrance and saw the situation outside, they were completely dazed.</p><br/><p>\u201cBoss, it\u2019s bad. A lot of people are charging towards our direction.</p><br/><p>When the restaurant owner heard that, he rushed to the entrance and looked into the distance.</p><br/><p>A group of people was charging over in a frenzy. Every one of them seemed as if they were competing for something. It was insane.</p><br/><p>He even heard voices from afar.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe master is in this restaurant.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, I never thought that I would be able to see the perfected Xue Family Fist in this lifetime.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is a true master. The Master said that he\u2019s willing to help us complete our techniques. He\u2019s our savior.\u201d</p><br/><p>The boss didn\u2019t know what they were talking about. However, he felt that, with so many people, his restaurant\u2019s business would be through the roof.</p><br/><p>He had opened his restaurant here mainly to cater to tourists. But there were too few tourists who came here. After all, this place was too old.</p><br/><p>This time, because such an event was being held here, he was exhilarated.</p><br/><p>\u201cGet out of the way.\u201d</p><br/><p>Just as the owner was thinking about all this, he was shoved to the side by the people.</p><br/><p>But the owner wasn\u2019t angry at all. Instead, he laughed. \u201cDon\u2019t rush. There is no hurry. We have many seats.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, he looked at the waiters and said hurriedly, \u201cWhat are you looking at? Hurry up and tell the chef to get to work.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, oh.\u201d The waiters were completely dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>At that moment, a large group of people was still outside. They stood at the entrance, trying to enter.</p><br/><p>\u201cMake some space in front so we can enter!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, stop pushing, stop pushing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy did you all come suddenly? Can you move aside and let me in?\u201d</p><br/><p>When the restaurant owner saw this, he was very excited. He went forward hastily.</p><br/><p>\u201cBe patient, be patient. There\u2019s a lot of space inside. There are private rooms on the second and third floor. I\u2019ll bring you all in from behind.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGet lost. Don\u2019t disturb us.\u201d A man pushed the owner to the side. Then, he used all his strength to try and push his way into the restaurant.</p><br/><p>When the owners of the surrounding restaurants saw this, they were stunned.</p><br/><p>It was as if they had seen a f*cking ghost. <em>What is going on with this restaurant? Why are there so many people queuing? Looking at the situation, it\u2019s as if they won\u2019t accept it if they aren\u2019t allowed in.</em></p><br/><p>\u201cWarriors, the private rooms here are very good too.\u201d</p><br/><p>But those men who were anxiously trying to enter didn\u2019t even pay any attention to the other restaurant owners.</p><br/><p>In the restaurant.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the situation and felt helpless.</p></div>\n</div>"}

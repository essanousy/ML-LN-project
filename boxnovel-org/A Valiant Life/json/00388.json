Various hospitals get their supplies from here. Everything here is legal and there are no fake ingredients.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded. This old Chinese doctor was indeed worthy of being called that. He knew much more than an average person would.</p><br/><p>\"Teacher, the quantity of Chinese medicine here is quite high,\" said Zhao Ming Qing. Then, after getting off the car, he made a call. Immediately, a person-in-charge from the company came and warmly welcomed them. The notebook was passed to this person-in-charge as Zhao Ming Qing said, \"Prepare all the ingredients in the notebook. It has to be real.\"</p><br/><p>The person-in-charge was a middle-aged man. He smiled and said, \"Elder Zhao, you must be joking. How could we possibly sell fake ingredients to you? Please wait a moment, I'll get someone to grab the medicine for you right now.</p><br/><p>After this person-in-charge left, Zhao Ming Qing smiled and said, \"Although this is a Chinese medicinal ingredient company, they have some inferior goods as well. But as long as I'm here, they won't dare to give us inferior goods.</p><br/><p>Not long after, the Chinese medicines were all prepared. They wrapped them up and dumped them to the back of the car. That expensive and luxurious car was instantly filled with the smell of Chinese medicine.</p><br/><p>Just as Lin Fan was about to pay, Zhao Ming Qing stopped him, \"Let me pay, teacher. I'm very familiar with this place. I get quite a lot of ingredients from here every year.\"</p><br/><p>Having someone to settle the bill was definitely not a bad thing. Lin Fan didn't bother about it. However, Zhao Ming Qing was wondering what on earth his teacher was buying all these medicines for. But he didn't ask. His teacher was going to bring him to go experience more of the world. When that time comes, he would be able to find out the full situation.</p><br/><p>As Lin Fan and Zhao Ming Qing drove off, the people in the tiny car behind them were astonished.</p><br/><p>Zhao Bin said, \"What's Dad doing here? He even bought quite a lot of Chinese medicine.\"</p><br/><p>Zhao Li Xing was silent for a while before he replied, \"I don't know, but it can't be anything good. Think about it, this guy doesn't want money but he wants Chinese medicine. He must know what kind of person Dad is. With his status, Dad can buy any amount of Chinese medicine he wants. I think this guy is getting Dad to pay for these ingredients and then sell them off for himself. That's a good scheme.\"</p><br/><p>\"Big Bro, why doesn't he just get money from our Dad directly?\" asked Zhao Bin uncertainly.</p><br/><p>Zhao Li Xing smiled and said, \"That's needless to say. Scamming someone's money is against the law. His identity would be exposed. But if he uses medicinal ingredients, it's different. They didn't even go to the bank. If we weren't so clever, who would have found out?\"</p><br/><p>\"So that's what's going on,\" Zhao Bin nodded as he felt that his Big Bro was really very smart. He could figure out the situation in such a short time.</p><br/><p>\"Keep following them. We'll see what exactly is going on.\" Zhao Li Xing was certain now that his dad had been tricked.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Nanshan Children's Welfare Institute.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing looked at the exterior of the building as asked, \"Teacher, what are we doing here?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan took a glance at Zhao Ming Qing and said, \"Seeing the sick. You'll know later on.\" Then, he made a call to Han Lu, telling him to come and carry the medicinal ingredients. There were too many ingredients and Lin Fan was lazy to carry them.</p><br/><p>Director Huang didn't expect Master Lin to be back so soon. When she saw Han Lu carrying those things, she had no idea what they were.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing kept following behind Lin Fan. He didn't understand what his teacher was going to do. But when he saw the children, his brows furrowed. It seemed that he had understood.</p><br/><p>\"Director Huang, please get the children to queue up. I'm going to give them a look,\" said Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Director Huang looked at Lin Fan, \"Master Lin, what are you doing? I don't quite understand.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled and replied, \"You'll understand in a moment.\"</p><br/><p>Director Huang nodded, then, she didn't ask more. Since it was like this, she decided to act according to Master Lin's request.</p><br/><p>In the building.</p><br/><p>Zhao Qing Ming stood next to Lin Fan. He saw so many children before him and he realized that these children's bodies all had problems. \"Teacher, this\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said calmly, \"This is a children's welfare institute. I've taken over this place. The children here were all rescued from a human trafficking organization but there are problems with all of their bodies. I want to see if I can treat them.\"</p><br/><p>\"What bunch of brutes!\" said Zhao Ming Qing angrily, referring to the human traffickers.</p><br/><p>At that moment, the preparations were all done. Han Lu brought a big bag of disposable silver needles over and placed it at the side. He was very curious as to what Master Lin was doing. He was already an eligible volunteer worker at this children's welfare institute. He had stopped pursuing boxing and martial arts, instead, he spent his days living with these little kids. He was really quite happy.</p><br/><p>\"Teacher\u2026\" Lil Fatty was sitting on his wheelchair. He was lively and cute. His mucus was flowing out from his nostrils.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing went forward and touched the child's leg. Judging by his experience, this leg was already useless. His legs had taken devastating hits and the nerves inside were all dead. Unless replaced them with prosthetic legs, he would never be able to stand up again.</p><br/><p>\"How is it?\" asked Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing shook his head, \"It's useless. With my abilities, I cannot treat him. If I saw him within a day of the injury, I might have a chance but now that so much time has passed, it's not possible anymore.\"</p><br/><p>But at that moment, Zhao Ming Qing came to his senses and looked at Lin Fan in shock. \"Teacher, are you thinking of\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed but didn't say anything. He looked at Lil' Fatty's legs. He wasn't using the silver needles yet, instead, he massaged his legs with a certain hand technique.</p><br/><p>\"Does it hurt?\" asked Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Lil' Fatty shook his head, \"No.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. It would have been strange if it did hurt.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing looked closely from the side. He didn't understand what Master Lin was trying to do yet but he believed that this would definitely be useful.</p><br/><p>This tenth page major class knowledge was really exceptional. It had every kind of medical skill attached. The most practical skill right now was Chinese Medicine. If he had the facilities for Western Medicine, he would have been able to treat these legs easily as well but getting the equipment and facilities was troublesome.</p><br/><p>The Encyclopedia's mystical powers flowed into him and rejuvenated him.</p><br/><p>With the Encyclopedia's Mystical boost, there was no sickness that required too long of a time to treat. Instead, the patient could heal from any sickness completely in a short amount of time.</p><br/><p>Then, Lin Fan opened the packet of silver needles and begun placing them. Lil Fatty was a little afraid. Although his hands kept moving about, his legs remained motionless as if he couldn't feel them at all.</p><br/><p>Very soon, both of his legs were covered with silver needles.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing stood at the side. He was puzzled but he didn't say anything. He didn't understand the reason behind placing needles at those acupuncture points. It wasn't that he was doubtful of his teacher, but these legs were really beyond saving. How could he still save those legs?</p><br/><p>But when Lin Fan's hands stopped, Zhao Ming Qing hurriedly asked, \"Teacher, would this be useful?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled, then he flicked Lil Fatty's knee. Lil Fatty's leg reacted and sprang upwards. It was a nerve reflex. Then, he turned to Zhao Ming Qing and said, \"What do you think?\"</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing was stunned. It was as if he had seen a ghost. \"This\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Director Huang and Han Lu, who were standing at the side were shocked. To them, all of this defied logic.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing was in disbelief. He pinched Lil' Fatty's leg, \"Does it hurt?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes,\" nodded Lil' Fatty.</p><br/><p>\"It doesn't make sense!\" Zhao Ming Qing looked as if he had been bewitched. Then, he pinched once more, this time harder. \"Does it hurt?\"</p><br/><p>\"Waaa\u2026\" At that moment, Lil' Fatty started crying from the pain.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at Zhao Ming Qing, \"What are you doing? Hurry up and cheer him up!\"</p><br/><p>To Zhao Ming Qing, it was really as if he had just seen a ghost.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

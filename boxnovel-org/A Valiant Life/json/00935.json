I\u2019m prepared to invest in another show, would you be interested?\u201d asked Chief Yang.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-1\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>When Director Zhu heard this, he was very excited. He was just a director and although he had many connections, the money required to film a show was not easy to get. Even if he had a great script, without the resources and investments, he would be hard pressed.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am interested. I\u2019m very interested,\u201d replied Director Zhu very quickly.</p><br/><p>Chief Yang was very pleased with Director Zhu\u2019s response. This was how a director should respond. \u201cI\u2019m looking at the next half of the year to start filming. As for the female lead, I think Qing Qing is really pretty good. She\u2019ll be the first female lead once again.\u201d</p><br/><p>Of course, Director Zhu understood. This Chief Yang probably just wanted to boost Xie Qing.</p><br/><p>But besides her beautiful appearance, this Xie Qing was just like a flower vase. She could even turn a first-rate script into a second-rate show. But Director Zhu couldn\u2019t say anything about it. He could only bear with it.</p><br/><p>Some of the actors around, as well as the second and third female lead actors, were filled with envy. <em>Having someone to back you is really great.</em></p><div class=\"code-block code-block-2\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>When actors aren\u2019t famous yet, enduring some hardship is fine. When they become famous and their status becomes high, they would have the power to negotiate. When that happens, they would be able to clear their names and what happened before would not be a problem anymore.</p><br/><p>Xie Qing raised her head proudly like an arrogant swan. She looked around with delightful eyes.</p><br/><p><em>See this? What I have, you all will never get.</em></p><br/><p><em>This is the difference between us.</em></p><br/><p>\u201cChen Bao Guo, for the next film, do you wanna play another character?\u201d Previously, he had called him Teacher Chen but now, he directly called him by his name. Although Chen Bao Guo was influential in the film industry, to Chief Yang, he was just a normal person.</p><br/><p>Chen Bao Guo smiled as he waved his hand in rejection. \u201cNah, I\u2019m getting old. My energy can\u2019t keep up. I\u2019m going to have a good rest.\u201d</p><br/><p>He had acted in this show just to return a favor. Now that the favor had been returned, he had no plans to continue.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright then.\u201d Chief Yang nodded. Then, he thought about Chief Wang\u2019s liking for the second female lead. He looked at Wu Huan Yue. \u201cDirector Zhu, I think this actor is pretty good. She could continue being the second female lead in the next show.\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-3\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Besides Wu Huan Yue, when the other secondary female leads heard this, they were all filled with envy once again. Their fiery gazes shifted to Chief Yang as they thought to themselves. <em>Pick me! Pick me!</em></p><br/><p>They knew that this kind of investment was worth at least 100 million dollars. It would be a huge production. If they managed to act in it, it would definitely have a huge impact on their futures.</p><br/><p>If they could suddenly skyrocket their fame, that would be amazing.</p><br/><p>Director Zhu was an experienced man, how could he not understand the intention behind that? But he didn\u2019t reply, because he knew that Wu Huan Yue had someone backing her too. Eastern Han Group was famous in Shanghai and he had heard before that Wu Huan Yue had a pretty deep relationship with Master Lin. He just didn\u2019t know how deep. It was just a rumor in the entertainment circle and no one knew for sure.</p><br/><p>Xie Qing furrowed her brows in displeasure. \u201cChief Yang, we just finished this show today, it\u2019s a little early to talk about the next one. Let\u2019s wait until everything is over.\u201d Then, she pointed at one of the secondary female actors. \u201cHey you, get us some water. I\u2019m a little thirsty.\u201d</p><br/><p>The secondary female actor was unhappy but she had no choice. She had a lower status and could only go and fetch the water obediently.</p><br/><p>Soon, the little celebrity came back with the water and handed it over respectfully. \u201cSister Xie, here\u2019s the water.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d Xie Qing didn\u2019t even move her lips and just uttered a sound as she took over the water.</p><br/><p>When the little celebrity was about to pass some water to Wu Huan Yue, Xie Qing interrupted.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a weird taste in this water. Give me that one.\u201d The little celebrity felt a little awkward. Then, she retracted her hand and passed that bottle of water that had been meant for Wu Huan Yue to Xie Qing.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-4\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get another bottle.</p><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue shook her head. \u201cNo need. I\u2019m not thirsty.\u201d</p><br/><p>The atmosphere was a little strange but everyone could sense what the tension was all about.</p><br/><p>Director Zhu understood the situation but didn\u2019t say anything. At the filming site, everyone was rather respectful to Wu Huan Yue. As for Xie Qing, not many people dared to strike up a conversation with her, mainly because she was too stuck up and she viewed everyone as below her.</p><br/><p>Moreover, Wu Huan Yue\u2019s acting skills were indeed brilliant and she had been complimented a lot.</p><br/><p>Xie Qing was a jealous person, so she naturally couldn\u2019t stand Wu Huan Yue.</p><br/><p>The surrounding film crew was packing up. Everyone gathered around the three people and started chatting. Some celebrities were gathered by Xie Qing\u2019s side while Director Zhu and some of the other people in charge of the film crew were accompanying Chief Yang and Wang Xun, smiling as they chatted.</p><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue and Chen Bao Guo had pretty much been ignored. They stood there silently listening as if they were nothing but air.</p><br/><p>\u201cDirector Zhu, you have to build your relationship with Chief Wang. In the next show, he\u2019s going to increase his investment exponentially. He\u2019s going to use big intellectual properties in the movie. It has to become very popular,\u201d said Chief Yang.</p><br/><p>Director Zhu replied, \u201cYes, yes, it will definitely be very popular. Nowadays, intellectual property is very popular.</p><br/><p>Wang Xun smiled. \u201cWhether it will be popular is unknown but this intellectual property is indeed huge. I spent 50 million just on the TV rights for this intellectual property. I predict an investment of at least a billion. Moreover, we still have to invite some big name celebrities to come and support us. We\u2019ll try to create next year\u2019s Best TV Show.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Yang said with a smile, \u201cOnce this show is out, there\u2019ll probably be so many celebrities that want to act in it that we\u2019ll go crazy.\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-5\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Everyone around was extremely eager. They felt that it was way too dominant. This was the era of internet intellectual property. Various hit movies and TV shows all involved big intellectual properties. If they could act inside, it would be amazing.</p><br/><p>Xie Qing was filled with delight. She asked with a delicate voice, \u201cChief Yang, will I really be the first female lead?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Yang replied, \u201cOf course. If I said it, it will definitely happen. I know how hard you work. I will never let go of a good actor.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone was very envious of Xie Qing. Although many people didn\u2019t like her, in this industry, there were times that they had to act shamelessly.</p><br/><p>Many people crowded around and called out \u2018Sister Xie\u2019 sweetly.</p><br/><p>Everyone placed their attention on her and they surrounded her.</p><br/><p>*Ding ding*</p><br/><p>At that moment, the ringing of a phone disrupted this peaceful boot-licking ceremony.</p><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue had been smiling thinly as she politely listened. But when she saw her phone display, a bright and beaming smile emerged on her face.</p><br/><p>\u201cExcuse me, everyone. I\u2019m going to pick up a friend. My friend is here to see me,\u201d said Wu Huan Yue.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-6\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Without waiting for a reply, Wu Huan Yue answered the call and rushed over.</p><br/><p>Chief Yang frowned. He was a little displeased. He had said so much and it had actually been for Wu Huan Yue to hear. He wanted to let her know that, in this industry, she had to have connections and she had to have people to carry her.</p><br/><p>And Chief Wang was that person for her. He wanted to tell her to seize this opportunity.</p><br/><p>But what a shame. This Wu Huan Yue seemed not to be bothered by that at all.</p></div>\n</div>"}

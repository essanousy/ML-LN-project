He really wasn't bothered by this matter at all. He hadn't expected himself to be able to strike a pot of gold. His shop still looked the same as when he had first started. Ever since he had gotten money, he hadn't thought of renovating it at all. Now, there was someone that had destroyed it and was going to renovate it for free.</p><br/><p>Then, a luxurious car appeared in front of Lin Fan. Lu Li wound the window down. \"I'll send you back.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved his hand. \"Thank you but it's okay.\"</p><br/><p>Lu Li looked at Lin Fan and nodded. Then, he drove off. He took out his phone and called someone.</p><br/><p>\"Officer Qin, I would like to ask you something.\" Lu Li was extremely interested in Lin Fan and he wanted to find out some things about him.</p><br/><p>Officer Qin replied, \"Chief Lu, what's up?\"</p><br/><p>Lu Li replied, \"My friend came to Shanghai and destroyed someone's shop\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Before he could finish his sentence, Officer Qin interrupted, \"Chief Lu, I know what you want to tell me. I can't do anything about this matter. It has to be done by following official procedures. Although I'm a leader, I can't be involved in bribery and fraud. Please understand that, Chief Lu.\"</p><br/><p>He was slightly shocked. He hadn't even said anything but had already been shut down by Officer Qin. He was still extremely interested in Lin Fan. \"Officer Qin, I guess you misunderstood me. I just wanted to know what's with this Master Lin? I am curious about him.\"</p><br/><p>Officer Qin was stunned. He hadn't expected Chief Lu to ask about him. Then, he paused for a moment and replied, \"I don't really know much about him but he's not a simple man. I have a subordinate who is closer to him. If you have any questions, I can ask him for you.\"</p><br/><p>Lu Li replied, \"I didn't want to ask anything in particular. Oh, right, do you know anything about Master Lin as a fortune-teller? You know, fortune-telling is something that we believe in more than any other average citizen. Although it's said that it'd only come true if you believe in it, I am still curious about this Master Lin.\"</p><br/><p>Then, Officer Qin chuckled, \"Chief Lu, I really don't know how to answer this question. If you think you can believe him, then go ahead. But this Master Lin is truly a capable man. You know about the human trafficking case that was resolved recently? There are a lot of things that were unsaid\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Then, Lu Li and Officer Qin talked for a while before they hung up.</p><br/><p>Officer Qin hadn't said things too directly but obviously, Lu Li understood what he meant.</p><br/><p>\"That's interesting,\" Lu Li chuckled. As for Qiao Fei, the matter was up to him to resolve. It wasn't as if his contract couldn't be completed without Qiao Fei. He didn't want to be involved in it, especially with the things that were going to happen in the future.</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>At Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>After returning, the shop owners gathered around. \"Little Boss, how did it go?\"</p><br/><p>\"What did the police say? How much did you make him pay you?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was surrounded by the townsfolk and everyone was very concerned about him. Then, he replied, \"$300,000.\"</p><br/><p>\"Huh? So little? We estimated the amount to be at least $500,000 to $600,000.\"</p><br/><p>\"That's right. Your business is so good. You could be making $50,000 to $60,000 easily everyday. $300,000 is really too little. I think Little Boss is too soft.\"</p><br/><p>After hearing what the other shop owners said, even Lin Fan felt that he was too soft. It was so much less than their estimation.</p><br/><p>But how could he have requested for $500,000 or even $600,000?</p><br/><p>The shop was torn and tattered and there was nowhere for them to stand. Fraud Tian and the rest could take a break for awhile.</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang was broadcasting the state of the shop to the netizens.</p><br/><p>Then, a video started to appear online in the evening.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan also posted on Weibo about it.</p><br/><p>\"We're resting. Our shop was destroyed by someone.\"</p><br/><p>After the Weibo post was published, the netizens were ecstatic.</p><br/><p>Among the sea of comments, Autumn Sword Fish Killer suddenly appeared. Although he only commented two words with an exclamation mark, people were wary of it. It had more than ten thousand likes.</p><br/><p>Autumn Sword Fish Killer: \"HA HA!\"</p><br/><p>The netizens also started to brainstorm. They started to analyze what the Flame War Emperor meant by these two words.</p><br/><p>Three Gold Prince: \"Although these two words are similar, there is a hint of unhappiness in this comment.\"</p><br/><p>Wutong Tree: \"Unbelievable. I feel that the hidden meaning behind this comment is murderous.\"</p><br/><p>Egg Tosser: \"The Flame War Emperor is indeed a legend. He is able to scold someone without a single vulgarity. How outstanding.\"</p><br/><p>Mary, the Small Lotus Sprout: \"To the people above, that's enough. Doesn't his comment mean that he is scolding his mother?\"</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>\"The person above said it.\"</p><br/><p>\"To the person above, the answer's out too early.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan hadn't seen Autumn Sword Fish Killer in a long time and wasn't used to it. Lin Fan felt that it was a nostalgic sight after seeing him return to his Weibo.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile.</p><br/><p>At the detainment center.</p><br/><p>Qiao Fei was calling someone. He had been locked in there and he found it unbearable. What were they trying to do? He could've called a few numbers and settled this small matter quickly.</p><br/><p>But now, it was useless. Officer Qin had actually said that he couldn't help him?</p><br/><p>What a joke.</p><br/><p>At night.</p><br/><p>At a certain luxurious villa in Shanghai.</p><br/><p>Lu Li returned home and was eating with his family. Although he had started to take over Skyworth Organization, his father was still the one in charge at home.</p><br/><p>\"Brother, I would like to work in the organization after I graduate,\" a lady said.</p><br/><p>Lu Li nodded. \"Alright, you shall start at the basic level.\"</p><br/><p>\"Huh\u2026\" the lady sighed helplessly.</p><br/><p>Lu Li's father, Lu Zhong Ming was a big shot in Shanghai. He had connections literally everywhere. When he was young, he started making a living in Shanghai since fourteen-years-old. He had sold newspapers, cleaned shoes and held many small jobs before. He had even been involved in the secret societies. He had basically held every single job there was until he reached twenty years of age. That's when he made something for himself. He started the Skyworth company with his first pot of gold. In the end, it developed into a mega organization.</p><br/><p>There was even a movie based on the life of Lu Zhong Ming. It was called 'The Big Shot of Shanghai'. The main actor in the movie was a pretty famous one and it received mostly positive reviews.</p><br/><p>Lu Zhong Ming was an old man now and his head was full of nothing but white hair. \"How did the contract agreement go?\"</p><br/><p>Lu Li shook his head. \"Dad, I haven't signed it yet.\"</p><br/><p>\"What's wrong?\" Lu Zhong Ming asked.</p><br/><p>\"Qiao Fei smashed someone's shop when he came to Shanghai. Initially, the matter could be resolved easily but the other party wasn't forgiving and opted to go to court for this,\" Lu Li said.</p><br/><p>Lu Zhong Ming asked, \"Who was wrong and who was right?\"</p><br/><p>\"I think Qiao Fei made a mistake,\" Lu Li replied.</p><br/><p>Lu Zhong Ming nodded. \"Since the other party doesn't want to settle the matter in private, let him go to court then.\"</p><br/><p>\"Yeah.\" Lu Li nodded and didn't say much else.</p><br/><p>\"Later, give a call to the Zhongzhou headquarters and request for another person to discuss this contract agreement,\" Lu Zhong Ming said.</p><br/><p>Lu Li nodded. \"I know.\"</p><br/><p>Initially, he had wanted to mention Lin Fan to his father but then he thought it wouldn't be necessary after all.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

They all knew that the Chinese Art Association\u2019s master would be of a high level but they never thought he would draw something like this.</p><br/><p>Even if he could think it, did not mean he had the means to do it.</p><br/><p>This whole place was in silence. Not a single eye could turn away from the painting. From the beginning until the end, the whole scene was just silence as everyone had been dazzled by the contents of the painting.</p><br/><p>This was a painting like none before. So much so that everyone was pondering over the generations of art that had been passed down and if any of them were as beautiful as this one.</p><br/><p>Perhaps there was not.</p><br/><p>Those paintings that had been passed down from hundreds of years ago had value from time, historical value and cultural value. Thus, lifting the value of all those paintings.</p><br/><p>However, after seeing this painting, everyone all had the same thoughts. Which was that this painting had exceeded all of that already. It had exceeded those paintings passed down from hundreds of years ago.</p><br/><p>After awhile.</p><br/><p>Everyone was all deeply embracing the picture. Then, Zheng Zhong Shan could not help lamenting, \u201cIf only this was the painting that Elder Lin gave to me. How good would that be?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yue Qiu Ju Shi ruthlessly retorted, \u201cElder Zheng, don\u2019t even think about it. This painting is already of immense value. I am not exaggerating when I say that it will go beyond becoming a national treasure. Based on my thinking, after a tens or maybe hundreds of years, this painting will be a part of history. Its value has already exceeded many other paintings and could be passed down for generations to come.</p><br/><p>Tao Shi Gang nodded. Although they were rating it very highly, what they were saying was the truth. This painting was of a very high standard.</p><br/><p>Zheng Zhong Shan nodded and said, \u201cI know. This isn\u2019t a painting that just anyone can come up with. I was just playing around with some thoughts. The more I talk to Elder Lin, the more I experience his enigmatism. I initially thought that the paintings he gave us were already the pinnacle of art. But I never thought that they would be nothing compared to this one.\u201d</p><br/><p>One of the association\u2019s masters opened his mouth and said, \u201cTo be able to see this painting while I\u2019m still alive has made my life feel complete. I wonder how the 9 other paintings by Master Lin will be.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zheng Zhong Shan shook his head and said, \u201cYou guys should not think so much. This painting is really enough to be a classic. Even if you send this one painting alone for an art exhibition, it would still be the best. So much so that those paintings from other countries would just be arranged with it so that they could climb up the social ladder.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlso, the painting is emotional. A painting like this is a once in a lifetime kind of thing. The other 9 paintings behind will not be able to compare to this one,\u201d Tao Shi Gang said. Based on his judgment, a painting as good as this was not just a product of one\u2019s artistic talents but also had a huge influence from the artist\u2019s environment and mood.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Zheng Zhong Shan was having some difficulties. He said, \u201cWhat do you guys think we should do? How are we going to take care of this piece of art? If we just leave it here, it will be very hard to take care of. If it gets damaged or stolen, it would be a calamity.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tao Shi Gang nodded and said, \u201cTrue. I was also thinking about that. Why don\u2019t we find an insurance company? We can\u2019t leave this painting in the association, nor can we leave it with anyone. Also, it is a very big art piece and the paint has yet to dry. I am willing to stay here and guard it while the paint dries.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yue Que Ju Shi also swiftly responded, saying, \u201cElder Tao, I cannot let you do this alone. I will stay here with you to guard it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m also willing to guard it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll stay here as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, everyone was in unison. They had all witnessed the birth of this painting and naturally wanted to look at it longer. If not, the next chance that they would be able to see it would be the International Art Exhibition.</p><br/><p>Zheng Zhong Shan was also not willing to leave, saying, \u201cThen it looks like everyone will be staying here. I\u2019m going to get in contact with the insurance agency and ask them to come over and quickly execute measures to protect this artwork. There definitely cannot be any mishaps.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, where did Elder Lin go? I better go check on him. I hope he wasn\u2019t so tired that he hurt his own body,\u201d Elder Zheng said.</p><br/><p>Tao Shi Gang shook his head and said, \u201cHe was outside just now but in the blink of an eye, he is gone. He must have gone for a stroll.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The next day.</p><br/><p>The Chinese Art Association extra lively.</p><br/><p>It was early in the morning and the whole association\u2019s members were standing outside the art studio.</p><br/><p>A few people saw this and were extremely curious, having no idea what was going on.</p><br/><p>This was a sight that was rarely seen. They were all wondering if something had happened. Afterward, they, one by one, started coming over and checking out what was going on.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, outside the studio, all the masters who had experienced the \u2018Picture of The Ode of the River Goddess\u2019 yesterday were all unwilling to leave. They had all arrived here early, wanting to see what kind of painting Master Lin will create this time.</p><br/><p>To them, Master Lin was really too amazing. If they had not seen it for themselves, they would not have believed it.</p><br/><p>Especially when the insurance company came over the previous day, the entire scene had been buzzing.</p><br/><p>President Zheng let the insurance company use their highest level of protection measures to protect the painting. The value of it was very high. It was like protecting a national treasure. When the bodyguards came to escort it, there were tens of them. Zheng Zhong Shan even followed them personally.</p><br/><p>If it had not been for the negative impact that it would bring, he would have been prepared to ask the army to come and escort them. However, after much thought, he decided against it as he did not think that any major incident would happen in Shanghai.</p><br/><p>Outside.</p><br/><p>\u201cGuys, look. Master Lin is in deep thought once again.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is not deep thought. This is him mulling over his state of mind, quieting his thoughts and bringing tranquility to his heart before letting it all out in one go.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWatching Master Lin paint is like appreciating an art. I never thought that watching someone paint could be so comforting.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLooks like Master Lin was very tired after painting that huge painting. Today\u2019s painting will definitely be smaller than yesterday\u2019s. Much smaller.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t say. Energy is limited. Master Lin is not superhuman so he will definitely be tired.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is to be admired. This times\u2019 art exhibition is going to exhaust Master Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Inside the room.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was thinking about what he was going to paint today. After much thought, he figured anything would do.</p><br/><p>\u2018Emperor Taizong Receiving the Tibetan Envoy\u2019 had a lot of history. It was about the Tibetan king, Songzain Gambo, admiring the Tang dynasty\u2019s culture. He sent an envoy Lu Dong Zan to Chang\u2019an and open communications with them. This painting was the scene of the envoy having an audience to Emperor Tang Taizong.</p><br/><p>He had already done his research. The information he found was very similar to what was in the encyclopedia. It might even have had no differences at all. However, there were some things that did not appear in his research.</p><br/><p>Also, there were some records of this scene in the \u2018Tang Dynasty Records\u2019 but there had not been a painting.</p><br/><p>As a result, if he were to copy it from the encyclopedia directly, there would not be any problems.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, with Lin Fan\u2019s current painting ability, it would be even better than the one in the encyclopedia. It would be more lifelike and it would express more ambiance.</p><br/><p>This surpassed all Chinese art knowledge.</p><br/><p>He freshened up and started painting. It was very natural, unforced and flowing smoothly. He did not have any pauses at all.</p><br/><p>The masters of the association all held their breaths as they all did not dare to make a single noise.</p><br/><p>If they were to disturb Master Lin, they would definitely be punished.</p><br/><p>To them, Master Lin was a Chinese Art master in a world of his own. All the other association members added together could not compare to him.</p><br/><p>They also had no idea how Master Lin practiced. To compare themselves to him would only result in disappointment.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

It wasn\u2019t because he wasn\u2019t capable. It was because this incident involved a Korean celebrity who was famous in China which caused a major commotion.</p><br/><p>Therefore, the people that Wu Yun Gang approached found it to be risky for him to be released. Hence, they didn\u2019t want to take the risk.</p><br/><p>\u201cChief Wu, it\u2019s okay. You tried your best. Anyway, we\u2019re already out.\u201d Lin Fan looked at Wu Yun Gang\u2019s embarrassed look and smiled.</p><br/><p>Wu Yun Gang replied awkwardly, \u201cIt\u2019s not that. It\u2019s just that I\u2019m actually helpless even though this is considered to be my territory. That\u2019s shameful.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved his hand. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. Let\u2019s not talk about this. Let\u2019s have a meal together, we haven\u2019t met in a long time. I want to hear about your investment project with Ming Yang.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Yun Gang smiled. \u201cThis project would be a success with Master Lin\u2019s guidance.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang smiled. \u201cOf course. When we were at the airport, I told him about it and this project will earn us millions of dollars!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Wu Yun Gang gasped in shock.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Wang Ming Yang trusted Lin Fan a lot.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved his hand. \u201cDon\u2019t be happy too early. You have to be calm. If you\u2019re not focused, things can change.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood, understood.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Yun Gang was familiar with the places in Beijing and naturally, he brought Wang Ming Yang and Lin Fan to the best and most high-end places. It was incredible to be traveling with a young and wealthy man.</p><br/><p>They ate till 11 pm and were extremely full. Wu Yun Gang booked a suite for Wang Ming Yang and Lin Fan and they went to have a rest.</p><br/><p>The next day!</p><br/><p>News articles came out.</p><br/><p>Jin Xuan Ming\u2019s incident was far from over. It had initially been a minor incident but he was a Korean celebrity. The reporters from China were waiting anxiously for any new information to report.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan\u2019s answers from yesterday\u2019s interview were also released to the public. The outsiders saw him as a cocky man. However, Lin Fan felt that it was still better to stay low-key.</p><br/><p>At the hospital.</p><br/><p>Jin Xuan Ming was extremely devastated. It was an indescribable feeling. He dreamt that he had attracted a lot of fans and the concert ticket prices skyrocketed. In the end, he took bags of money back to Korea and became famous there too.</p><br/><p>However, he opened his eyes and realized it was just a dream.</p><br/><p>Jin Xuan Ming had come to China after signing a temporary contract with a managerial company. This company was in charge of the corporate arrangements. However, he was bedridden and he couldn\u2019t attend any event at all. It was a huge blow to Jin Xuan Ming.</p><br/><p>He lay on his bed and used his phone.</p><br/><p>He used a software that could translate the content into different languages.</p><br/><p>Weibo was an extremely important social media platform for networking. He felt better after reading the translated comments of his fans in China. He felt that he could still make a return if he still had these hardcore fans and that his fame wouldn\u2019t just vanish.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy dear babies, I am well. Thank you for your good wishes.\u201d Jin Xuan Ming posted and smiled when he saw the comments of the Chinese fans.</p><br/><p>It was such a great feeling. He had never felt this way in Korea because he was just a small fry back there.</p><br/><p>However, things were different in China. He felt extremely great here.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, he knew that some of the senior celebrities had come to China and earned a lot of money. However, they had been banned because they spoke too much. Therefore, he decided to not tell anyone about his true feelings about things.</p><br/><p>He wanted to wait till he earned enough money before going back to Korea. Then, he could speak about it on the Korean variety shows.</p><br/><p>He even thought of what to say.</p><br/><p>\u2018The Chinese are dumb and rich. Any small celebrities from Korea can go there and beat the celebrities there.\u2019</p><br/><p>Then, his manager came in. \u201cXuan Ming, how are you feeling?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jin Xuan Ming nodded. \u201cI feel better, how\u2019re things on the Internet?\u201d</p><br/><p>The manager replied, \u201cLet me have a look.\u201d</p><br/><p>When he opened the latest news article, the manager was stunned.</p><br/><p>Jin Xuan Ming saw his expression and was a little curious. He frowned as he took his phone to read the news. When the news was translated into Korean, his expression changed.</p><br/><p>\u201cScumbag\u2026\u201d Jin Xuan Ming scolded. He was enraged. \u201cThese Chinese people are too shameless.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd these paparazzi, how could they say such things? Incorrigible.\u201d</p><br/><p>The manager tried to console him after seeing that he was breathing heavily, \u201cXuan Ming, don\u2019t be too anxious. The doctor said that you have to rest well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jin Xuan Ming replied, \u201cI want to attend the corporate events.\u201d</p><br/><p>The manager was stunned. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jin Xuan Ming replied, \u201cI can\u2019t be defeated by a Chinese. I want to attend the corporate events. If I lie down here for a month, the world would forget about me. The losses would be too great to imagine. Please make arrangements for me. I will attend any corporate event.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut your health\u2026\u201d The manager hesitated.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay. I\u2019ll just sit in a wheelchair. The Chinese fans can be easily deceived. What do you think they\u2019d do if I were to perform while I\u2019m sick?\u201d</p><br/><p>The manager smiled. \u201cThey\u2019d definitely be even more amazed. At the same time, you\u2019d definitely become an idol. You should stir up some of their emotions and perhaps you\u2019d reap even greater benefits.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jin Xuan Ming smiled. \u201cThat\u2019s right. That\u2019s what I meant.\u201d</p><br/><p>The manager got even more excited as she thought about it. That was the best way they could deal with the situation. Letting Xuan Ming appear in front of the fans in such a state would definitely move them. Ultimately, they\u2019d definitely cheer for him.</p><br/><p>On the Internet.</p><br/><p>The netizens were discussing intensely after reading the news. More people started to comment on Lin Fan\u2019s Weibo.</p><br/><p>\u201c666\u2026 Master Lin is my idol.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, that\u2019s hilarious. Master Lin\u2019s words are so infuriating. However, I feel so excited after listening to him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe said they could take his life since he didn\u2019t have money. Who would be capable enough to take Master Lin\u2019s life? Anyone who tries would probably be badly beaten up.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m impressed. Master Lin has such a wide network. It\u2019s even helped him out of the police station.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to find out what Jin Xuan Ming thinks of this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s probably too traumatized.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere did Master Lin go? He should appear in a situation like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that instant.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan woke up but he wasn\u2019t bothered by what was happening. He felt that the most important thing now was to attend the National Arts Exhibition.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

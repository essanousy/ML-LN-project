A look of disbelief</h1>\n<div class=\"chr-c\" id=\"chr-content\" style=\"font-family: Minion, serif, serif; font-size: 18px; line-height: 160%;\">\n<div class=\"cha-words\"><br/><p>Dongyue Hotel!</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-1\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Liu Xu was patrolling the inside of the hotel. Although it was a big business now, she still had to check it personally.</p><br/><p>She had only just managed to set herself up in Shanghai and she really appreciated all that she had now. She wanted to prove that she was able to run her own business even after leaving her home.</p><br/><p>She understood deeply that the more she had, the greater her burden would be. If she started to loosen her grip on her business and started to relax, everything might suddenly collapse one day.</p><br/><p>\u201cChief Liu.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood day, Chief Liu.\u201d</p><br/><p>The staff members who passed her were all very respectful towards her.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-2\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Liu Xu nodded at them. Then, she called a female staff member to halt. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on in here? Why is it so noisy?\u201d</p><br/><p>The female staff member looked at the tightly shut door. All kinds of noise were emanating from inside. She shook her head and said, \u201cChief Liu, I don\u2019t know either. Since they booked this conference room, they\u2019ve been having lessons inside. Occasionally, they would make such strange noises.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Xu nodded but she was still suspicious. \u201cAlright, carry on with your work.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Chief Liu.\u201d The female staff member nodded and left.</p><br/><p>Liu Xu stood at the door and listened discreetly. She was very curious about this group that had booked the conference room and were making these strange noises.</p><br/><p>However, since they had paid to rent the conference room, it wouldn\u2019t be good for her to disturb them. As long as they weren\u2019t doing any illegal things inside, she wouldn\u2019t ask.</p><br/><p>She listened for a while outside the door but still couldn\u2019t understand what the heck was going on.</p><br/><p>They were saying things like power, focus, wealth and other kinds of strange and random things. It made her very curious.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-3\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Then, she saw the description placed on the door and went to take a closer look.</p><br/><p>\u201cSpiritual Transmission. Experience the beauty of the universe.\u201d</p><br/><p>She took a look but still didn\u2019t understand what it meant. But Liu Xu kept feeling that it was really weird.</p><br/><p>*Rumble! Rumble!*</p><br/><p>Thunderous noise rang out from inside the room. Liu Xu frowned. If it wasn\u2019t for the fact that the conference room was not usually booked, she wouldn\u2019t have rented it to these people.</p><br/><p>Soon after.</p><br/><p>Liu Xu was prepared to leave. She told the staff to pay attention to the room. If anything happened inside, they had to control the situation immediately.</p><br/><p>At that moment, the room suddenly went quiet.</p><br/><p>The door was opened.</p><br/><p>A group of people walked out.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-4\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Liu Xu stood there, watching with a curious gaze. Everyone was dripping with sweat as if they had just done some kind of intense exercise.</p><br/><p>The men who came out of the room saw this beautiful lady standing there and couldn\u2019t help but take a few looks at her. However, thinking about what they had learned that day, they felt that they had to go back and practice it properly.</p><br/><p>\u201cChief Liu.\u201d At that moment, a man walked over.</p><br/><p>Elder Wang was all smiles. He was very satisfied. He felt that he had gained a lot of knowledge today. When he saw Liu Xu, he went forward to greet her.</p><br/><p>Master Lin had organized several activities before and they had all been here. Elder Wang knew about Little Boss\u2019s relationship with Liu Xu. It was not a normal one. Now that he had seen her, he naturally had to greet her.</p><br/><p>But unfortunately, Liu Xu didn\u2019t recognize Elder Wang.</p><br/><p>Elder Wang didn\u2019t appear to be embarrassed. \u201cChief Liu, I\u2019m a shop owner from Cloud Street, Elder Wang. I\u2019ve come here with Little Boss a few times.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Liu Xu came back to her senses. She was very curious about what had happened in the conference room. \u201cWhat were you all doing inside?\u201d</p><br/><p>When she brought this up, Elder Wang was filled with pride. \u201cChief Liu, we were learning inside. Spiritual transmission. It is the feeling of being filled with the energy of our surroundings and integrating it into our bodies to make our spirits more ethereal.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Xu was completely confused. \u201c???\u201d</p><br/><p>She had a dumbfounded look on her face as she couldn\u2019t understand what he had said at all.</p><br/><p>Elder Wang continued, \u201cChief Liu, if you are interested, you can come and listen in on the class tomorrow afternoon. I think the teachers will definitely welcome you. And let me tell you this. Tomorrow afternoon, a true teacher will be coming to teach us the latest lesson.\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-5\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cAre the lesson fees expensive?\u201d Liu Xu pretended to be interested as she asked.</p><br/><p>Elder Wang shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s not expensive. It only costs 1880. I signed up a few days ago and I feel like I\u2019ve really learned something. My spirit has become fantastic.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m planning to buy something when the teacher comes tomorrow. For example, I might buy a jade stone to put in my house. It would change the electromagnetic fields at home to be more suitable for the human body.</p><br/><p>When Liu Xu heard that, she immediately knew that something was wrong. Wasn\u2019t that multi-level marketing?</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, I see. Alright then. I still have stuff to do. Go on with what you were doing then,\u201d said Liu Xu.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d Elder Wang carried his red bag as he caught up with a fellow student in front. The two of them chatted cheerily as they went downstairs.</p><br/><p>Liu Xu watched Elder Wang leave as she was immersed in deep thought. She felt that something was wrong and she had to give a warning.</p><br/><p>Although she wasn\u2019t really on great terms with Lin Fan, she had to give him a heads up about something like this. Otherwise, what else would she do?</p><br/><p>She took out her phone and gave Lin Fan a call.</p><br/><p>Cloud Street.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-6\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>The phone rang. Lin Fan saw the phone display and was a little surprised.</p><br/><p>It was as if he had seen a ghost. Why would Liu Xu give me a call? Could it be that she\u2019s unhappy and she wants to scold me?=</p><br/><p>Alright then. I\u2019m happy to scold her back.=</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, Chief Liu, why did you suddenly think about calling me?\u201d Lin Fan said in a mocking tone as he answered the call.</p><br/><p>Liu Xu said, \u201cI have to tell you something. If you don\u2019t care, then I won\u2019t be bothered either. I\u2019m just going to tell you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cAlright, tell me. I\u2019ll see what it is.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have someone called Elder Wang from Cloud Street right? He came to attend some kind of conference at my place. I feel like it\u2019s multi-level marketing. If you see him, ask him about it. I\u2019m hanging up,\u201d said Liu Xu.</p><br/><p>Then, without waiting for Lin Fan to reply, she hung up.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was dumbfounded as he listened to the beeping of the phone. He had wanted to ask a few more questions but she hadn\u2019t given him the chance at all.</p><br/><p>But something wasn\u2019t right. What did that woman just say?=</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-7\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Elder Wang has joined some multi-level marketing?=</p><br/><p>If that\u2019s true, it\u2019s a big problem.=</p><br/><p>That would mean that Cloud Street\u2019s intelligence level has fallen all the way.=</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Lin, what is it?\u201d asked Zhao Zhong Yang.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cIs Elder Wang involved in multi-level marketing?\u201d</p><br/><p>When Zhao Zhong Yang heard that, his jaw dropped. \u201cThat can\u2019t be. Under Brother Lin\u2019s leadership, how could anyone from our Cloud Street be scammed?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to take a look at his shop and check out the situation.\u201d Lin Fan didn\u2019t say more as he immediately left for Elder Wang\u2019s shop.</p><br/><p>Indeed, the shop was closed. Then, he headed to Elder Chen\u2019s side.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Chen, has Elder Wang been acting abnormally lately?\u201d asked Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Elder Chen was watching a war film. Then, he nodded. \u201cYeah, he has been acting a little strange. He doesn\u2019t even open his shop anymore. I just see him carrying a red bag and locking the shop every day. When we asked him, he said he was going to study.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it? Is there a problem?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded. \u201cThere might be a problem. My friend just told me that Elder Wang might have become involved in multi-level marketing.\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-8\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>*Clatter!*</p><br/><p>Elder Chen almost collapsed to the ground. His face was filled with disbelief. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded helplessly. \u201cThat\u2019s the case\u2026\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

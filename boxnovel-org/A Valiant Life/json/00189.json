Both humans and dogs alike enjoyed the taste of it.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan had already lost track of how many scallion pancakes he had made. The dogs were all bloated to the brim, and his hands were sore from making so many scallion pancakes.</p><br/><p>\"Master Lin, now that the dogs are full, why don't you give us some as well?\" one of the townsfolk asked.</p><br/><p>This aroused a rally of approval from the rest after seeing the delicious pancakes Master Lin made for the dogs.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan hands waved them away. \"I'm tired. These dogs deserve this treat today for their hard work.\"</p><br/><p>The townsfolk all laughed. They had indeed witnessed a miracle today, and the dogs were just simply amazing.</p><br/><p>The surrounding shop owners.</p><br/><p>\"With all these dogs around, our children will be safe here. We won't have to worry about a thing.\"</p><br/><p>\"Before these dogs came here, everyone thought owning dogs was a hassle. But looking at it now, I guess it's a good thing.\"</p><br/><p>\"Let's adopt all these wild dogs as our own. They've done something great today.\"</p><br/><p>\"We've really got to thank Elder Dog Nicholas. I never thought that he would be capable of such a feat! He's so amazing!\"</p><br/><p>\"Hey, we can't forget about Master Lin either. Without him, we won't even be able to communicate with the dogs.\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes, that's right! Master Lin is Cloud Street's great blessing. Ever since he showed up here, all our businesses have boomed. Sister Hong's child was kidnapped and was found almost immediately. These were all thanks to Master Lin!\"</p><br/><p>Master Lin chuckled as he waved them away. \"You guys are too kind. We're all neighbors here. We should all help one another.\"</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>At the police station.</p><br/><p>The kidnapping case at Cloud Street was still being investigated, and the police officers were all busy compiling the case.</p><br/><p>The policemen who witnessed the dogs in actions arrived at the police station. They couldn't stop discussing how the dogs solved the case. It was such a great mystery, and they still couldn't figure out how this came to be.</p><br/><p>\"We've liaised with the transport department for CCTV footage around the area and we'll conduct an investigation on that,\" one of the female police officers said.</p><br/><p>\"Notify the transport department that we no longer require the footage from the CCTV,\" said the police officer who returned from the scene.</p><br/><p>\"Oh? Why don't we need it anymore?\" The policewoman raised her brow, looking seemingly confused.</p><br/><p>\"We've already found the kid and the kidnappers have all been admitted to the hospital.\"</p><br/><p>The female officer heaved a sigh of relief, smiling. \"Brother Wang, you guys are really brilliant to have solved this case.\"</p><br/><p>The male police officer chuckled. \"It wasn't us at all. You won't believe me when I tell you that the ones who found the child was a group of dogs. We were only just there to clean up.\"</p><br/><p>\"Ah? How's this even possible?\"</p><br/><p>The male officer's expression brightened up. \"This will take quite a while to explain. How about I explain it to you over dinner tonight? My treat!\"</p><br/><p>\"Sure.\"</p><br/><p>The male officer was elated. He had been wanting to ask her out on a date but hadn't had any progress. Her agreeing to have dinner together was a huge step forward.</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>At the hospital.</p><br/><p>\"What happened to me, doctor?\" the male driver lay on the bed, groaning.</p><br/><p>The doctor would usually treat his patients the same, but after learning that that patient was a kidnapper, he didn't really want anything to do with him. \"Forget about it, there isn't any hope.\"</p><br/><p>The male drivers face turned pale as if he received a huge slap to his face.</p><br/><p>The doctor could see that it was a dog bite.</p><br/><p>He really had to give it to those dogs. They really gave him a good bite. Serves him right.</p><br/><p>The next day!</p><br/><p>Someone uploaded the video of the live broadcast online.</p><br/><p>\"Wow! I don't believe this. This is all too much!\"</p><br/><p>\"A man talking to dogs? Are you screwing around with me?\"</p><br/><p>\"A child was kidnapped and was rescued with the help of a bunch of dogs? Who wrote this story? We need a good talk.\"</p><br/><p>\"Didn't Master Lin write a post on this kidnapping case yesterday? What if it was really the dogs who rescued the child?\"</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>The netizens were having a discussion on this topic. The video footage wasn't clear. After reviewing the footage, they felt it was rather impressive, but they didn't really think much about it. Hence, the resulting reaction wasn't very big.</p><br/><p>Moreover, it was a live-streamed video, and so there were some parts which were intermittent and some other parts that were cut off. Those who watched the video didn't have many emotions about the situation. But for those who were there, this case was really a miraculous one.</p><br/><p>The next morning, Lin Fan was worried that he had finished the task in the Encyclopedia, and so he stayed at home for a while. After idling for a while, he still did not receive any notification from the Encyclopedia that he had completed the task, and so he thought that it was clear to go back to his shop.</p><br/><p>At Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>The townsfolk were all queuing up while discussing the happenings of yesterday.</p><br/><p>\"Come over here, Elder Dog Nicholas!\" The townsfolk waved Elder Dog Nicholas over, who was laying on the floor. However, Elder Dog Nicholas didn't even lift up his head. He laid there as if contemplating the meaning of being a dog.</p><br/><p>\"Elder Dog Nicholas isn't responding to us...\"</p><br/><p>\"If only we could talk to dogs like Master Lin, then we could make a deal with the dogs and ask them to hand us their free supply of scallion pancakes.\"</p><br/><p>\"Hey, Master Lin is here...\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was sauntering over from afar. He was in a good mood after solving the nerve-wracking case from the day before.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan stood in front of the scallion pancake counter, getting ready to make scallion pancakes.</p><br/><p>Elder Dog Nicholas immediately stood up and walked over to Cloud Street, barking. Almost immediately, a group of dogs came from all over, wagging their tails as they made their way to Master Lin's shop.</p><br/><p>Elder Dog Nicholas went up to Lin Fan and barked. \"We want some scallion pancakes!\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan heaved a huge sigh. This was definitely a scam, except it wasn't by humans, but by a bunch of dogs.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan worked his a*s off all the way till 1030 before finally feeding all the dogs.</p><br/><p>The townsfolk who weren't able to buy the scallion pancakes looked at the dogs enviously. Why were the dogs treated better than humans?</p><br/><p>After an entire day of rest, Sister Hong had finally calmed down. The first order of business for her was to properly thank Lin Fan with a huge gift.</p><br/><p>For Lin Fan, it didn't even require much effort on his part. However, Sister Hong felt extremely indebted to him.</p><br/><p>Sister Hong brought an exquisite kennel. \"Elder Dog Nicholas, I got this for you. Do you like it? I can't thank you enough for yesterday.\"</p><br/><p>Elder Dog Nicholas stuck out his tongue as he let out a sneeze. He looked at Sister Hong and turned his gaze at the poodle who was blocked by a glass panel in her shop.</p><br/><p>\"Woof woof!\"</p><br/><p>Elder Dog Nicholas barked at Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Sister Hong asked curiously, \"Master Lin, what is Elder Dog Nicholas saying?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan felt a little awkward. \"Sister Hong, Elder Dog Nicholas said that the poodle in your house is pretty good-looking, and he wants to get to know her.\"</p><br/><p>But whatever Elder Dog Nicholas said was embellished by Lin Fan. If Lin Fan hadn't filtered what Elder Dog Nicholas said, it would have just been a few crude words. \"I want to bang her.\"</p><br/><p>Sister Hong patted Elder Dog Nicholas on his head. \"That's a good thing. Go ahead!\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at Elder Dog Nicholas, squinting his eyes. \"Go ahead...\"</p><br/><p>Elder Dog Nicholas immediately dashed over to the poodle with his four stubby legs, tongue sticking out after hearing that Sister Hong gave him the go ahead.</p><br/><p>Elder Dog Nicholas wavered.</p><br/><p>The people in Lin Fan's shop all laughed.</p><br/><p>\"Looks like Elder Dog is going to smash!\" Fraud Tian said crudely.</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhongyang laughed. \"Elder Dog Nicholas is so short. Can he mount?\"</p><br/><p>Everyone was speechless.</p><br/><p>They had never considered that question before...</p><br/>\n</div>"}

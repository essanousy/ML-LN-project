However, he would never be able to repay him for saving his life.</p><br/><p>The fact that he saved his life meant that he had to repay him with his life.</p><br/><p>He knew that Master Lin wasn\u2019t the type to rely on favors. He would usually depend on himself to resolve problems.</p><br/><p>After knowing about this incident, he didn\u2019t say anything much. He just called him immediately. He used the reputation of Lu Corporation and his own ability to reprimand Director Zhou. He wanted him to admit his mistakes.</p><br/><p>Several million dollars were indeed just peanuts to him. However, it wasn\u2019t easy to obtain. Every brilliant entrepreneur wouldn\u2019t miss out on money. However, if they didn\u2019t stand to gain anything, they wouldn\u2019t care about it.</p><br/><p>Zhou Guo Sheng could just spend a few million dollars to pay the workers. However, the problems with the internal departments caused this and he wasn\u2019t going to fork out his own money so easily.</p><br/><p>Even if they were to pay, he would make the labor services company pay for it.</p><br/><p>The secretary said, \u201cChief Lu, we could\u2019ve just called on your behalf for this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Li smiled and waved his hand, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, you can leave now.\u201d</p><br/><p>To the secretaries, they all had the dream of becoming wealthy women. Furthermore, Lu Li was single. He was a wealthy bachelor and everyone wanted to become his wife. However, he wasn\u2019t really involved with the women and the secretaries were helpless about it.</p><br/><p>At Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>Elder Liang said, \u201cLittle Boss, what are you going to do during the Lunar New Year?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cI\u2019m not going home. My family is coming over to Shanghai. We\u2019re going to the Children\u2019s Welfare Institute to spend it with the children. What about you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Liang said, \u201cI have to go back home. I am prepared to close my shop a few days later to go back earlier. I have worked so hard for the past year and I want to stay at home for a while longer.\u201d Then, he smiled, \u201cLittle Boss, you can\u2019t always stay single. Should I go back home and find some ladies for you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Liang, something must be wrong with you. I am still so young. Why do I need to go through a matchmaking?\u201d Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan sneakily glared at Elder Liang after hearing that. Elder Liang realized that she was glaring at him and smiled. He was really envious of Little Boss.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan was really pretty and capable and he didn\u2019t even think about marrying her.</p><br/><p>He really couldn\u2019t understand the young people these days.</p><br/><p>Ding ding!</p><br/><p>Then, his phone rang.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at it and it was a call from a stranger.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello, who is this?\u201d Lin Fan asked.</p><br/><p>The person on the phone sounded calm. It was as if he was trying to get into his good books.</p><br/><p>\u201cHi, Master Lin. I am the director of Mother Earth Real Estate Corporation, Zhou Guo Sheng.\u201d Zhou Guo Sheng was helpless. He had to resolve the problem quickly.</p><br/><p>Director Lu called him personally and he couldn\u2019t have done anything else. Even if he had to fork out his own money, he had to pay the workers.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, Director Zhou, what is it? Are you prepared to pay the workers?\u201d Lin Fan asked.</p><br/><p>He wasn\u2019t really troubled about anything besides the problem with this Mother Earth company.</p><br/><p>They could just resolve it by paying the workers.</p><br/><p>They just wanted to drag the situation longer. Lin Fan wasn\u2019t a fan of offending people. However, if he had to offend people to resolve something, he would do it.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, yes. This was our management\u2019s mistake. I am really helpless with regards to owing the workers their salaries. Master Lin, you should know that my family business is really big and I can\u2019t take care of all of the things well,\u201d Zhou Guo Sheng said politely to Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>He had to talk to Master Lin politely. If not, what else could he have done?</p><br/><p>He was going to make a big loss.</p><br/><p>He lost the big project with Lu Corporation over a few million dollars. If only he was smart enough to realize the seriousness of this issue.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, this matter was a small one and he had to resolve it personally as the boss of his company.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan didn\u2019t expect him to really agree to pay the workers. It was an unexpected occurrence. If he did it to avoid people talking about it, that would be illogical. If he did it to avoid that, he would have paid the workers yesterday.</p><br/><p>However, Lin Fan wasn\u2019t going to be polite to him.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a Director indeed. You understand the problem. You said that the workers are your foundation and if you were to lose your foundation, who would be there to build your houses, right?\u201d Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>Zhou Guo Sheng replied, \u201cYes, yes. Master Lin put it really accurately. If I had known about this earlier, I would\u2019ve paid the workers immediately. The managers these days are really terrible. When this is over, I will teach them a lesson.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cAlright, Director Zhou, you must be an understanding person. I won\u2019t be too overboard with this. After you pay the workers, I will delete the Weibo posts. However, I feel that you should give the workers some reimbursement. You should pay them 1.5x of their salaries. After all, if you were to go to arbitration, that would be the outcome too. Don\u2019t you think so?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Zhou Guo Sheng was stunned. 1.5x their salaries? Didn\u2019t that mean that he was going to lose extra money?</p><br/><p>However, could he still think about this? He felt that Master Lin was really ruthless. It was clearly not his fault but he was trying to make things difficult for him.</p><br/><p>\u201cSure, I\u2019ll do as per Master Lin\u2019s instructions. It\u2019s indeed our fault for this problem. We\u2019ll pay them 1.5x their salaries then. However, can I please request Master Lin to speak to Chief Lu?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you were to say that you had that kind of relationship with Chief Lu, I wouldn\u2019t have allowed this matter to progress to this stage. Don\u2019t you think so?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was stunned. What Chief Lu? Who was he talking about?</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t know who he was.</p><br/><p>However, Director Zhou was saying that Chief Lu had a special relationship with him. Lin Fan didn\u2019t want to expose himself.</p><br/><p>\u201cSure, that will do. Just resolve the problem first. I\u2019ll be waiting for good news,\u201d Lin Fan immediately promises. Once the problem was resolved, they could discuss with Chief Lu again.</p><br/><p>Zhou Guo Sheng wasn\u2019t doubtful of him, \u201cAlright, I will get the finance department to transfer the funds. I won\u2019t disturb Master Lin anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>He hung up.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan touched his chin and wondered</p><br/><p>\u201cChief Lu? Which Chief Lu was he talking about? Could it be Lu Li? The boss that got kidnapped with him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did he mean by saying that they had a special kind of relationship?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>After Zhou Guo Sheng hung up, he gasped helplessly. Master Lin was really ruthless. He immediately asked for an extra 50% of their salaries. Master Lin must have been a really thick-skinned individual to have said that.</p><br/><p>However, he admitted defeat.</p><br/><p>Then, he made a call. It sounded like he was shouting, \u201cI\u2019ll call the finance department later. You have to pay the workers 1.5x their salaries. If something were to happen again, or if you were to deduct money again, you\u2019ll be banished. Do you understand?\u201d</p><br/><p>Manager Wu was furious after he heard that. He didn\u2019t expect his big boss to have called him and spoke to him so furiously. He just nodded and agreed.</p><br/><p>\u201cI understand that.\u201d</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t expect the workers to be paid 1.5x of their salaries. It was totally unexpected.</p></div>\n</div>"}

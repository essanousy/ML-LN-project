Also, when it came to dealing with the people that provoked him, he would go in like a bulldozer, not showing any mercy.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan approached the man in a calm state. However, his expression was of a playful smile, then he said, \u201cYou\u2019re the one who is trying to get money from our teacher right?\u201d</p><br/><p>The man looked at Lin Fan with some disdain and said, \u201cSo what? Your teacher owes us money, are we not allowed to come and claim it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled and said, \u201cIf you owe money, you have to pay money. That is a universally understood law and I won\u2019t dispute that. However, what was it that you said to Teacher Xia just now? I didn\u2019t hear it clearly so can you say it again?\u201d</p><br/><p>The man looked at Lin Fan, he could not help becoming more aggressive in his appearance as he said, \u201cLittle boy, do you not feel that you are a nuisance?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I do not. I just did not hear what you said just now, so can I trouble you to repeat it? What did you say would happen to our teacher if they do not repay the money?\u201d Lin Fan said with a smile on his face.</p><br/><p>To Lin Fan, this b*stard really had no respect for others. For him to have the nerve to say such things to his teacher made him feel like punching them all in their faces.</p><br/><p>Wang Zhen and the rest of them saw how Lin Fan and the other guy were in a standoff and he could not help feeling concerned. He said, \u201cDo you guys think that Lin Fan will end up losing out?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have no idea, how about we just call the police?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s not do anything rash, we should see how the situation goes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf we were to call the police, wouldn\u2019t that lead to everyone knowing about Teacher Shen gambling and having a huge debt? It will definitely have a big impact on him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, Shen Hong\u2019s face was filled with regret. If he had known that this was how things would turn out, he definitely would not have joined the gambling den and this definitely would not have happened.</p><br/><p>The man ignored what Lin Fan had said and then said, \u201cDo you know how much your teacher owes us? If you really want to help him foot the bill then I\u2019ll have you know that he owes us a total of\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShut up. Right now, I don\u2019t care how much he owes, I\u2019m asking you what you said just now,\u201d Lin Fan\u2019s tone became solemn. If the other party did not explain clearly what happened just now, he would not let it slide.</p><br/><p>When his classmates looked at Lin Fan, they felt that he had changed a lot. Unknowingly, he had become tougher. When it came to dealing with this big sized man, he showed no fear at all and was even willing to standoff with him, something they had never thought he would do.</p><br/><p>\u201cI said you\u2019re retarded,\u201d the man angrily rebuked.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are retarded,\u201d Lin Fan lifted his hand and immediately slapped him. \u201cI dare you to scold me again\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly, the scene erupted in commotion.</p><br/><p>Teacher Xia was dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>Wang Zhen and the rest of them were stunned also.</p><br/><p>The man was dumbfounded too.</p><br/><p>He never thought that this small man in front of him would even dare to touch him.</p><br/><p>How ferocious!</p><br/><p>Wang Zhen and the rest of them had the same thoughts in their mind. They felt that Lin Fan was very wild, willing to take action without a second thought.</p><br/><p>Teacher Xia stepped up and said with concern, \u201cLil\u2019 Fan, don\u2019t be rash.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher Xia, leave this situation to me. Relax, I\u2019ll definitely settle this by today,\u201d Lin Fan confidently said.</p><br/><p>If it was anyone else, Lin Fan would not really care, but since it was Teacher Xia, he did.</p><br/><p>If this man was not so disrespectful and had just kept to the original agreement, then everything would be fine. After all, it was something that was caused by Teacher Xia\u2019s family member. However, these men were being bullies and saw the rest of them as pushovers.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo? Are you going to give in? I\u2019m telling you, I\u2019m going to slow play with you today and whether you want to give in or not, I\u2019ll make you give in. Today is my teacher\u2019s birthday, supposedly a happy occasion but you\u2019ve ruined it, so how do you plan on making it up to us?\u201d Lin Fan sternly said.</p><br/><p>The school leaders saw this situation and gently pulled Teacher Xia to them. They asked, \u201cTeacher Xia, this is one of your students?\u201d</p><br/><p>Teacher Xia nodded. He was definitely one of her students, however, she felt like she did not recognize him. With his state of anger right now, he had definitely changed a lot.</p><br/><p>Compared to when he was still in school back then, he was like two different people.</p><br/><p>The school leaders were shocked when they heard that. They never thought that there would be someone like this in the midst of all of her students.</p><br/><p>The man looked at Lin Fan and shouted, \u201cOkay, today I\u2019m going to make you see. Come, call for more men.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><br/><p>They did not dare to make a huge fuss inside the hotel but once they stepped outside of it, they would teach these b*stards a lesson.</p><br/><p>When some of the surrounding students, who were a little cowardly, heard that they were calling for backup, they were very scared. They had never been in such a situation before and their hearts started to race.</p><br/><p>However, in this situation, they could not run away. If they did, they would be scolded to death by the rest of their classmates. As a result, all they could do was pretend to be brave and just stand there.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis\u2026this,\u201d Teacher Xia was dumbfounded. She had never thought that things would go down this path. It exceeded anyone\u2019s imagination.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho wanted to call for backup?\u201d At this moment, a sound came from outside. The room doors were pushed open and a person, whose gender was really hard to tell, came in.</p><br/><p>When the man saw this person come in, his expression totally changed. His face suddenly turned into a smile and then he said in a welcoming way, \u201cBrother Qiang Qiang, it\u2019s nothing, just a small misunderstanding.\u201d</p><br/><p>The rest of the men behind him did not recognize Brother Qiang Qiang so they all looked on curiously, wondering who it was. However, before they could give this much thought, the man instructed, \u201cHurry up and greet Brother Qiang Qiang.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Qiang Qiang,\u201d the rest of them greeted. They definitely could not defy orders.</p><br/><p>\u201cMmm,\u201d Brother Qiang Qiang nodded, then her gaze shifted to Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was also looking at Brother Qiang Qiang. But upon closer inspection, his expression changed. There was something off about this person.</p><br/><p>\u201cSh*t, I\u2019ve never seen anyone with this level of hormonal dysfunction. Her estrogen levels must have entirely crumbled. She\u2026 she, could she be a tranny?\u201d Lin Fan thought to himself.</p><br/><p>This person was definitely very sick.</p><br/><p>When Teacher Xia saw this person, she was also stunned. This person\u2019s features were all exquisite but there was still a weird feeling coming from this person. She could not understand this feeling but what she did know was that something was off about this person.</p><br/><p>\u201cGodly Doctor, I\u2019ve been looking forward to seeing you for a long time,\u201d Brother Qiang Qiang looked at Lin Fan and smiled.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded and with some suspicion, said, \u201cYou know me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Brother Qiang Qiang laughed and said, \u201cThe famous Godly Doctor who has been here in Jiangning, who would not know him?\u201d Then she looked at the man and said, \u201cI don\u2019t care what kind of disagreements you have with the Godly Doctor. Will you write it all off for me?\u201d</p><br/><p>The man looked at Brother Qiang Qiang and with no hesitation, said, \u201cSure, sure, for Brother Qiang Qiang, I definitely will.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, Teacher Xia was a little dumbfounded, wondering what was going on.</p><br/><p>What in the world was this about the Godly Doctor? She knew all about the situation in Jiangning but what did it have to do with Lin Fan?</p><br/><p>At that moment, Wang Zhen asked with huge surprise, \u201cLin Fan, are you the Godly Doctor?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone was shocked. They were all in disbelief.</p><br/><p>This situation was beyond everyone\u2019s imagination, especially Teacher Xia\u2019s. She could not help but let out a sigh of relief because, with the way things seemed right now, nothing should go wrong anymore.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, the man rushed in front and looked at Lin Fan, his expression was a little emotional as he said, \u201cYou are the Godly Doctor in Jiangning everyone has been talking about?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded and said, \u201cMmm, what\u2019s up? Do you still have any issues?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh no,\u201d after hearing this, the man slapped his own leg, his face filled with regret and said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry Godly Doctor, I did not recognize you. If I had known this before Brother Qiang Qiang appeared, I definitely would not have bothered you. Do you remember Little Brother Hu?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I do,\u201d Lin Fan nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am Little Brother Hu\u2019s biological brother, his daughter is my niece and my name is Little Brother Bao. You\u2019ve done so much for my family and this was just a result of people not recognizing each other. A family not recognizing each other. Godly Doctor, this is all my fault, I know what to do.\u201d At this moment, Little Brother Bao had become sober, the tipsy feeling earlier was gone and he walked up to Teacher Xia.</p><br/><p>When Teacher Xia saw him coming, she was stunned and was feeling a little scared.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Teacher Xia. I should slap my own mouth, I\u2019ve been too disrespectful to you all. Please don\u2019t take it to heart.\u201d Little brother Bao slapped himself on the mouth in front of everyone, then looked towards Shen Hong and said, \u201cTeacher Shen, I\u2019ve let you down. All the money that you lost while gambling, I\u2019ll return it all to you. This is all just a misunderstanding, a big misunderstanding.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Shen Hong was dumbfounded</p><br/><p>What in the world was going on?</p></div>\n</div>"}

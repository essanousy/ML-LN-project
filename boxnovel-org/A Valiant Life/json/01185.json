It was simply an impossible task.</p><br/><p>In other countries.</p><br/><p>On online forums.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Chinese Master Lin has confirmed that he will eradicate AIDS. Are you ready?\u201d</p><br/><p>When the headline was published, everyone was stunned.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh my goodness, he is crazy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally? If he succeeds, I will be saved!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo way, I have to buy a ticket to China to show my support. Master Lin is my favourite Chinese.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c666\u2026 ^ You must be crazy. You think you can board the plane?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have the illness. My girlfriend has it and I have to go.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWait, I think you might have exposed yourself ^.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a deep sentence to say.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know what you want to say, but things are not what you think they are. She is my hero. Although she unfortunately contracted this illness, she saved a lot of people.\u201d</p><br/><p>This incident did not just create an uproar in China. It caused a huge commotion all around the world.</p><br/><p>Master Lin was going to eradicate AIDS. It was literally like saving the entire world.</p><br/><p>The next day!</p><br/><p>At Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan reached there, he realised that the townsfolk were already there early in the morning.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will be making the scallion pancakes soon,\u201d Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>However, what shocked Lin Fan was that the townsfolk actually were not there to eat scallion pancakes.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, we are not here for the pancakes. We are here to support you. We don\u2019t want you to over-exert yourself.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. Although we aren\u2019t of much help, we believe that you can do it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, you must be cautious, extremely cautious!\u201d</p><br/><p>A commotion started among the townsfolk. They were really worried about Master Lin.</p><br/><p>It was AIDS. It was something that was easily transmitted, unlike any other illness.</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha,\u201d Lin Fan chuckled. Then, he said, \u201cThank you, everyone. I can assure you that nothing will happen. I will still continue to make scallion pancakes for everyone.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone laughed after hearing that.</p><br/><p>They felt that Master Lin was a precious gem hidden in Cloud Street. He would be there for everyone whenever something went wrong.</p><br/><p>Then, a bunch of reporters arrived.</p><br/><p>It was expected. If no reporters were to appear, everyone would probably start eating sh*t.</p><br/><p>Of course, he did not want to expose himself as the reporters would do anything to prove him wrong.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, we are here again\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The voices of the reporters could be heard from a distance away. They were pretty close to Master Lin, and they were pretty excited about coming to Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>When they arrived at the entrance of the shop, Lin Fan waved his hand and tried to look presentable for the reporters to take pictures of him.</p><br/><p>\u201cI knew all of you were going to come. If you weren\u2019t here, I\u2019d be shocked to death,\u201d Lin Fan chuckled helplessly.</p><br/><p>The reporters laughed, \u201cMaster Lin, we know you too well. We\u2019re just here for some questions. We will not interrupt your business. We know that you will be doing something extraordinary, and you must rest well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, don\u2019t be so polite. Just ask me the questions ASAP. I will answer them all.\u201d</p><br/><p>The surrounding townsfolk laughed. It was the first time that they saw someone who was so friendly towards reporters.</p><br/><p>However, they felt that Master Lin was not exactly a public figure. After all, his primary focus was still on work.</p><br/><p>A pretty female reporter asked in awe, \u201cMaster Lin, I\u2019d like to ask how you decided on eradicating AIDS.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cDo you want me to tell the truth or lie?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust tell us the lie first.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cIt\u2019s for everyone in the entire world. It\u2019s normal to take up these challenges for someone as powerful as me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha,\u201d the reporters laughed. \u201cMaster Lin, just tell us the truth.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan added, \u201cI had been thinking about it, but I hadn\u2019t wanted to execute it. However, that top post changed my mind.\u201d</p><br/><p>*clap*</p><br/><p>The surrounding townsfolk clapped in awe of Master Lin\u2019s courage.</p><br/><p>The female reporter nodded and quickly took down notes. He was her idol, and she would never write anything negative about Master Lin.</p><br/><p>Sometimes, even if she had nothing to publish, she would not use Master Lin to attract attention.</p><br/><p>Another male reporter asked, \u201cMaster Lin, how confident are you in eradicating AIDS?\u201d</p><br/><p>It was an important question. One that everyone wanted to know. Of course, before anything was finalised, they would not know the truth.</p><br/><p>Obviously, the answer to the question would probably spark a discussion.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan answered confidently, \u201cI will definitely succeed. Everything will be solved if I\u2019m involved. Don\u2019t worry. 100%.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?!\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporters were stunned after hearing that.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, don\u2019t say that. Just tell us the truth. If we were to publish this, it would be nothing but banter.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, you should say that you\u2019re not confident so that when you succeed, people would be more excited about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, that answer sounds better. I agree.\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporters started to talk among themselves again.</p><br/><p>However, the townsfolk were stunned. It was the first time they witnessed the reporters suggesting answers to the subject being interviewed.</p><br/><p>It was unbelievable.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled, \u201cAlright, then I\u2019ll say 50%. It\u2019s pretty difficult to eradicate. How about that?\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporters nodded after hearing that.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s perfect. 50% is just the right amount.\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporters asked various questions, but that was the key question that everyone wanted to ask.</p><br/><p>They had been interviewing Master Lin for a long time, and if he were to die because of this, they would be devastated.</p><br/><p>Hence, they really hoped that Master Lin would not fail.</p><br/><p>However, the illness was really difficult to eradicate. Although they truly believed in Master Lin, they did not know what to say.</p><br/><p>Then, someone walked over.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, I brought my daughter here\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, everyone turned around. Some of them tried to avoid them, but they forced themselves to stand still.</p></div>\n</div>"}

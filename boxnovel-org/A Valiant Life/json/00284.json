Then, he stabilized the phone and immediately pointed it at Lin Fan. He took a closer look at each of the eight cards.</p><br/><p>\"These are real poker cards. It's not magic!\" Zhao Zhong Yang was stunned. He was in disbelief. He looked at them closely and wanted to see if there was anything wrong with the cards. In the end, he couldn't find anything.</p><br/><p>\"It's definitely real. How could it be fake?\" Lin Fan said. Then, he said to the broadcast, \"How's everyone feeling today?\"</p><br/><p>Everyone was just writing '666\u2026' in the broadcast. There were a few that said 'amazing' and 'extraordinary'. They were all in disbelief as they didn't think it was real.</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang suddenly appeared in the broadcast. \"Everyone, this is real. We are not kidding at all.\"</p><br/><p>\"Wow, Brother Yang has appeared.\"</p><br/><p>\"Huh?\"</p><br/><p>\"It's real? Brother Yang, are you trying to cheat us with Master Lin?\"</p><br/><p>Master Lin held the cards in his hands and let Zhao Zhong Yang sit beside him. \"Maybe you guys think this is fake. Let me show you then. I'll distribute the cards based on their values.\"</p><br/><p>The netizens in the broadcast room were interested. They had initially wanted to have a quick look before going back to sleep. But now, they were attracted to Master Lin.</p><br/><p>Maybe it wasn't Master Lin. Maybe they were attracted to it because of the cards.</p><br/><p>Everything was being broadcasted. The tabletop was on the screen the whole time.</p><br/><p>Now, Lin Fan was going to distribute the cards based on their values.</p><br/><p>There would be eight cards for each value.</p><br/><p>Gradually, the netizens became more curious. They realized that the cards were real.</p><br/><p>Then, the table was filled with cards. Lin Fan said, \"Everyone, did you see that? Please ask me if you have any questions.\"</p><br/><p>\"Master Lin, I don't believe it. Pick up a random card and let us take a look at it.\"</p><br/><p>\"Yeah, we want to look at it closely.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan wanted to make them see that there was nothing wrong with the cards.</p><br/><p>Then, he took a random card and showed it to the camera. \"You guys can have a closer look at it. This is a typical poker card. There isn't anything hidden and nothing's been changed. I can tear it for you guys to see.\"</p><br/><p>*tear*</p><br/><p>\"Looks like it's real.\"</p><br/><p>\"Master Lin, we believe you now. What are you going to perform?\"</p><br/><p>Master Lin immediately placed the torn card back to its original position. Then, he looked at the camera. \"There are two decks of cards here. Do you think I can mix them together and then distribute them back into two separate decks again?\"</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan said that, everyone was shocked.</p><br/><p>\"How could that be? If you can return it back to the original sequence or two separate decks, I'll eat sh*t immediately.\"</p><br/><p>\"Master Lin is bragging again. If he could really do it, it'd be crazy.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan knew that they wouldn't believe him. Then, he started to shuffle them. \"Don't blink and watch closely. I will slow down the video to the slowest speed and perform it right in front of everyone. Sometimes, you'd fall deeper into something the more you don't believe in it.\"</p><br/><p>Then, he mixed both decks together and separated them.</p><br/><p>There were two decks of cards on the table now but nobody saw what the cards were.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \"To prove that I'm innocent, I won't move now. I'll spread the cards out in front of the camera.\"</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang was in disbelief. He watched everything that Lin Fan was doing as he sat beside him. He didn't even blink his eyes. If Lin Fan could really separate the cards, he'd probably jump off the building.</p><br/><p>When Zhao Zhong Yang saw the first deck being spread open on the table, the whole broadcast room went crazy.</p><br/><p>\"D*mn! That's f*cking insane.\"</p><br/><p>\"666\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"I'm convinced. I'm completely in awe. Can someone tell me if that's real or fake? I'm in a daze.\"</p><br/><p>\"I'm also in a daze. I don't believe it.\"</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang flipped the cards over and saw it with his own eyes. He was shocked. Then, he looked at Lin Fan. \"How did you do that?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. \"It's a simple method. Does anyone still believe in cards?\"</p><br/><p>\"Let's not talk about anything else. We'll just talk about tricks. There are many ways that people use to cheat when gambling. There are various high-tech methods. Sometimes, when you look close enough, you'd be able to tell. Furthermore, these methods can't be shown on camera. What I want to show everyone is a real skill which only involves your bare hands.\"</p><br/><p>\"If your hands are flexible enough, they can mesmerize anyone. You can practically win everyone from dusk till dawn. People would have no idea.\"</p><br/><p>There were netizens that weren't fans of gambling in the broadcast room. However, they still looked closely as Lin Fan possessed such crazy skills.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, there were some netizens that loved to gamble. They had seen many tricks and techniques before but nothing as impressive.</p><br/><p>\"Master Lin, we understand what you just said but that's just too unbelievable. Could you show us a more practical one?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yeah, we are always very cautious when we're gambling. We know that shuffling can be a problem, so we always don't let the suspect shuffle the cards. That would resolve the problems.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. \"Alright, let's try something interesting. Nowadays, 'Golden Flower' is more popular. Sometimes, one round can cause you to lose your entire life. I'll let Zhao Zhong Yang shuffle the cards and I'll only cut the deck. What do you think will happen?\"</p><br/><p>The netizens didn't know what was going to happen but they were extremely curious.</p><br/><p>At a random internet cafe.</p><br/><p>The internet cafe staff said, \"Brother Qiu, you've been here for so long. Don't you want to go back and sleep?\"</p><br/><p>Brother Qiu replied, \"Why should I go back to sleep? I have to watch the broadcast. Master Lin is crazy. His gambling skills are simply law-defying.\"</p><br/><p>The staff member was doubtful, so he stood behind him. When he saw that the person in the broadcast only cut the deck and managed to distribute a full suit, he was stunned. \"That's a scam, right?\"</p><br/><p>Brother Qiu replied, \"It's not a scam. They're real cards. D*mn, that's too law-defying. It's so scary. In the future, whoever dares to gamble with Master Lin will lose all his money. Just this set of cards can ensure that the person will lose everything he has.\"</p><br/><p>The staff nodded in shock. \"Yeah, he could simply bet his whole life on a card game. That's too scary. What's the number of this broadcasting room? I want to have a look too.\"</p><br/><p>This type of situation was common in all parts of the world. Initially, everyone wanted to just have a look at it but now, none of them could take their eyes off the screen. To them, it was too crazy and unbelievable.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled, \"What do you guys think of that? I previously cut the deck. Now, let's see what happens if I don't. Shall we?\"</p><br/><p>The comments section exploded.</p><br/><p>\"God of Gambling, please take me as your disciple.\"</p><br/><p>\"I just want to learn the skills and I'm willing to give up everything.\"</p><br/><p>\"It's too d*mn scary. It's simply horrifying.\"</p><br/><p>\"Do you dare to believe it? It was a full suit. If this happened in an actual game, people would lose their life savings.\"</p><br/><p>\"Just their life savings? I think they'd probably lose everything that their family owns too.\"</p><br/><p>...</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Without looking, Lin Fan already knew who it was. Who else could it be besides Wang Ming Yang?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it? Have you seen my Weibo post?\u201d Lin Fan asked with a chuckle.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang was clearly thrilled. \u201cI saw it. Of course I saw it. If I didn\u2019t see it, I wouldn\u2019t be a good brother!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know what you want. Alright, I\u2019ll give you my word now. I\u2019ll have the songs ready by tomorrow,\u201d said Lin Fan. This was just an easy task to him.</p><br/><p>His English wasn\u2019t good indeed. However, he didn\u2019t have to write the songs himself. There were a lot of songs in the Encyclopedia. It would be a waste not to use them.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang said in shock, \u201cIs this for real? Isn\u2019t that too fast?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed. \u201cIt\u2019s not fast at all. It\u2019s just a simple task. Just come over to my shop tomorrow to get the songs from me. Tell Huan Yue to work hard. Her placing in the competition isn\u2019t important. What\u2019s important is that she participates.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother, what you\u2019re saying doesn\u2019t sound truthful. If you write the songs yourself, how could she not get a good placing?\u201d Wang Ming Yang chuckled. He felt that his brother was being too modest. He clearly wanted to see Wu Huan Yue get the prize.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said helplessly, \u201cYou can\u2019t say that she\u2019ll get a prize just because I\u2019m writing the songs. It still depends on circumstances. Alright, let\u2019s end the call here. I have to think about what songs to right.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI shan\u2019t disturb you then.\u201d</p><br/><p>With Lin Fan facing such an important task, Wang Ming Yang definitely didn\u2019t want to disturb his brother. Hence, he hung up the call.</p><br/><p>After he hung up, Wang Ming Yang immediately called Wu Huan Yue to let her know about the situation.</p><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue had already seen Brother Lin\u2019s Weibo post. At that moment, when she got the call from Chief Wang, she was lost for words for a moment. She felt that the pressure was immense, but she had no lack of confidence. No matter what, she had to put in all she had.</p><br/><p>In the office.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang was smiling to himself. He was just that delighted. Then, he thought about Zheng Ya and couldn\u2019t wait to have his vengeance.</p><br/><p>Cloud Street!</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan stood behind Lin Fan. \u201cBrother Lin, are you going to write the songs?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan found a paper and a pen. Then, he placed them on the table and sank into deep thought.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Lin, actually, there\u2019s no need to rush. Writing songs has to be taken slowly,\u201d said Wu You Lan.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shook his head. \u201cNo, I\u2019m thinking about which song to use. Let me think on my own for a while.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan looked at Lin Fan with a blank look before walking to the side.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian shook his head and sighed. \u201cSigh. He even has to show off in front of his own people. These days are hard for us. We really have to give in to him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan sat there and browsed through the large number of songs in the Encyclopedia. For a moment, he was dazed.</p><br/><p>He really didn\u2019t understand English. He didn\u2019t even understand the song titles. Then, without thinking too much, he went ahead.</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause of You.\u201d</p><br/><p>These were three English words that he could understand. They were very simple. At least he could still recognize those three words.</p><br/><p>Because of you.</p><br/><p>He started scribbling on the blank piece of paper.</p><br/><p>Then, he had started composing again. To other people, this was a very difficult job. But to him, it was way too simple.</p><br/><p>In fact, he saw on the Encyclopedia that it had topped the music charts for three different countries.</p><br/><p>Although he didn\u2019t know what the lyrics meant, if it could top the charts, it definitely wouldn\u2019t be bad.</p><br/><p>However, one song was definitely not enough. He had to get a few more.</p><br/><p>\u201cYesterday Once More\u201d</p><br/><p>He really couldn\u2019t understand the song title this time. He didn\u2019t even know a single one of the three words. He only had a vague idea of the last word. But the good thing was that there was a Chinese translation of the title below.</p><br/><p>He continued looking. All he had to do was raise his pen and blindly choose.</p><br/><p>\u201cInnocence\u201d</p><br/><p>This song title only consisted of one word, but he truly couldn\u2019t understand it. However, the translation was written below as well.</p><br/><p>Although he had no idea what the heck the lyrics were about, it seemed pretty good based on the Encyclopedia\u2019s description, so he selected it.</p><br/><p>He wrote down the lyrics. He wrote down the tune.</p><br/><p>It was beautifully done.</p><br/><p>Looking at the time, it had taken a total of twenty minutes.</p><br/><p>Actually, he could have been even faster. However, he didn\u2019t want to make any errors while copying, so he had been extra careful.</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang saw Lin Fan focused on writing the songs. He subtly said to his Internet buddies in the broadcast room, \u201cBrother Lin is definitely in a tough spot. He just took a look at the time. He\u2019s definitely worried that time is passing too fast.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Internet buddies in the broadcast room were commenting passionately.</p><br/><p>\u201cSigh. Master Lin doesn\u2019t have to do this. Even if he doesn\u2019t write the song, I would still support him forever.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. Those online trolls are really annoying these days. It\u2019s as if they expect Master Lin to know everything. Is it an offence not to know how to write English songs?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. Those songs that Master Lin wrote for Wu Huan Yue are my favourite. Hasn\u2019t he already proven enough?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. Brother Yang, hurry up and cheer Master Lin up. Don\u2019t let him suffer under too much pressure.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSigh. It\u2019s really tough for Master Lin. He clearly doesn\u2019t understand English, but he\u2019s still forcing himself to do it. I\u2019ve felt this feeling before as well. When you force yourself to do something you can\u2019t, it\u2019s a thousand times more painful than constipation.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Lin Fan tossed his pen onto the table, leaned back and heaved a sigh.</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang said, \u201cBrother Lin, don\u2019t be in such a rush. Take it slow. Actually, if you really can\u2019t write the songs, it\u2019s fine too.\u201d</p><br/><p>He was comforting Brother Lin. This was the first time he had seen Brother Lin so helpless. Usually, Brother Lin was always strong because he could do anything. However, they had always been by his side and could empathize with him very well.</p><br/><p>\u201cRush? What are you talking about? You must be joking! Why wouldn\u2019t I be able to write the songs? I\u2019ve already finished them. But that was way too tiring!\u201d Lin Fan stretched his back and his neck. There were even cracking sounds when he did that.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d When Zhao Zhong Yang heard that, he looked at Brother Lin in a daze as if he had seen a ghost. \u201cBrother Lin, did you say that you\u2019ve finished writing the songs?\u201d</p><br/><p>F*ck. That\u2019s way too unrealistic. It has only been such a short time. How could he have finished?</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. I\u2019ve written three songs. This should be enough.\u201d Lin Fan smiled. It was all done and it had been done beautifully. There were no problems at all.</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang was dumbfounded. His jaw dropped.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan was the same as well. She was dazed as well. It\u2019s only been such a short time and he said he has finished three songs. Is he trying to scare us to death?</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian said in shock, \u201cKid, were you just scribbling blindly?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan picked up the piece of paper. \u201cAre you joking? How could you say that? Even though I don\u2019t understand English, writing songs is not a problem.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, the netizens in the broadcast room completely erupted.</p><br/><p>They had been watching the whole time and had only seen Master Lin writing for twenty minutes. Now that he said he had finished writing three songs, they could never believe him!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

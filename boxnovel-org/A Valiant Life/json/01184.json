Nobody would say anything if you were to reject it. After all, it\u2019s an extremely complicated illness. You\u2019re not God.\u201d</p><br/><p>He did not want Lin Fan to take the risk because nobody could foresee what would happen during his study of the illness. What if he were to contract it too?</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang added, \u201cBrother Lin, what Fraud Tian said makes sense.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved his hand. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll be fine. It\u2019s not as complicated and scary as you think.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, he unlocked his phone and thought for a moment before sending a message on Weibo.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, I will take up the challenge of eradicating AIDS. Could the person from the most liked comment bring your daughter to Shanghai? We need a real person to examine. However, I can assure you that nothing will go wrong. Please don\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><br/><p>When the message was published, everyone was stunned.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn! Master Lin saw it! He saw it!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m speechless. Master Lin is going to study about AIDS. It\u2019s not a laughing matter. If he were to contract it, things are going to go out of hand.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, I\u2019ve got nothing to say. I swear if I were to flame Master Lin again, I would be struck by lightning.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTo those innocent people who have been affected by AIDS, it would be a miracle. However, those that got the disease from their selfish acts are really lucky.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, people who lack knowledge think that wearing a condom can solve everything. They don\u2019t know that other viruses besides HIV are way smaller than the gaps in the condom. They can enter via those gaps too. Therefore, people who wear condoms can still be affected too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c^ Bro, that\u2019s really true. Nowadays, condoms are of poor quality and there\u2019s not much difference.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t talk about anything else. Master Lin is too powerful. I\u2019m in awe.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI hope Master Lin can succeed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Yi Jun had been waiting patiently in his room. When he saw Master Lin\u2019s post, he was speechless.</p><br/><p>His face turned red from the excitement and shock.</p><br/><p>\u201cAH! My daughter, there\u2019s hope!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Yi Jun immediately embraced his daughter. Then, he packed his things and left for Shanghai.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, a lot of netizens and even hospital staff were discussing about it.</p><br/><p>They felt that Master Lin was too rash and that it was extremely risky for him to do that.</p><br/><p>If something were to go wrong, it would be too late for him to change anything.</p><br/><p>At Cloud Street!</p><br/><p>Soon after Lin Fan posted that, various shop owners came over.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Boss, you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>They were stunned after seeing his post.</p><br/><p>They did not expect Little Boss to take up a huge risk like this. Things could really get out of hand if he were to mishandle anything.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. \u201cYeah, it\u2019s 100% real. Don\u2019t worry, nothing will happen.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone looked at him without saying anything.</p><br/><p>Elder Liang was really worried. \u201cLittle Boss, don\u2019t you want more time to think about it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Sister Hong nodded. \u201cYeah, think about it again.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved his hand. \u201cThere\u2019s no need for that. I can assure you that nothing will go wrong.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ding ding!</p><br/><p>Then, Wang Ming Yang called.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan knew what he was going to say the moment he saw the call.</p><br/><p>When he picked up, Wang Ming Yang started shouting, \u201cD*mn, are you crazy?! You must be asking for trouble for agreeing to study this disease.\u201d Wang Ming Yang was stunned after reading about it.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cDo you not believe in me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang replied, \u201cYeah, I don\u2019t believe in you. Please, don\u2019t play with such high stakes. Are you trying to shock me to death?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cAlright, I don\u2019t believe you still doubt me after all this while.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang was in disbelief. \u201cBro, please. Don\u2019t play with fire. Just eradicate something else.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMing Yang, believe me. Nothing will go wrong.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWait, I\u2019m coming over. You\u2019re crazy. Please help me and help yourself.\u201d Wang Ming Yang was really anxious.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cNo, I will beat you up if you come over.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang replied, \u201cIf you were to beat me to death, I would still come over. You\u2019re literally playing with your life. Even though the little girl is really pitiful, you should be thinking about yourself or even us. If something were to happen to you, what about us?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m helpless\u2026\u201d Lin Fan did not know what to say. Then, he started arguing with Wang Ming Yang.</p><br/><p>After some time, he finally managed to appease Wang Ming Yang.</p><br/><p>To him, it was really something minor. He had mystical powers and nothing could stop him.</p><br/><p>He was able to cure AIDS with his medical skills and knowledge, but he just needed time to come up with the medication.</p><br/><p>He felt that he could not announce that yet or else people would think that he was going crazy.</p><br/><p>After hanging up, Ming Qing called.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, we\u2019re eradicating AIDS?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cYes. You can choose not to participate. I will do it on my own.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing immediately rejected, \u201cNo, I will join too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you afraid?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, anyone can be afraid, but as a doctor, I must not fear any illness. If I feared any illness, I shouldn\u2019t have chosen to be a doctor. We can\u2019t cure an illness if we are afraid of it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded. \u201cOkay, don\u2019t worry, I am here and nothing will go wrong.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI believe in you. I am not worried at all. I\u2019m just a little excited to do this with you. I will hang up now. I\u2019m going to gather some information to prepare for our work.\u201d</p><br/><p>Soon, he hung up.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled as he did not expect Zhao Ming Qing to be so excited.</p><br/><p>That was great. He wanted to see how scary HIV was and how long he needed to eradicate it.</p><br/><p>After thinking of that, he was filled with energy.</p></div>\n</div>"}

More importantly, he said he wanted to hack into the bank system and access the police account but this is illegal.\u201d Liu Xiao Tian said anxiously.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha,\u201d Chief Qin laughed. \u201cLittle Tian, you\u2019re just too innocent and you trust this Master Lin too much. Do you think all those guys who designed the system are rookies? Master Lin is just one person. Without any preparation, do you think he can hack the system? You\u2019re really looking down on all those computer geniuses. Don\u2019t get your hopes up too high. Master Lin is just saying that out of good intention.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian was still a little worried, but he realized what Chief Qin said did have some logic to it. The people who designed the bank system weren\u2019t rookies. It wasn\u2019t going to be easy at all to hack into their system. \u201cBut Chief, what if he could actually do it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf he could do it by himself, I\u2019ll give it to him. I\u2019ll leave this problem to him. Don\u2019t think too much, I still have meetings to attend. Alright, I\u2019ll hang up now. You better do what you need to do.\u201d</p><br/><p>He hung up.</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian was still worried, but with the Chief\u2019s green light, he felt a little more at ease.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Lin Fan dialed Elder Zheng\u2019s number\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Lin, how\u2019s everything going? Are you calling me because you want to come to Beijing?\u201d Elder Zheng chuckled on the phone.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Zheng, I just need to ask you one thing. Did you see the news today about that seventy-something-year-old lady who got cheated?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat news is that? I didn\u2019t really pay any attention to it,\u201d Elder Zheng replied in an unsure tone.</p><br/><p>\u201cSay, don\u2019t you think this is rather despicable? When I saw that news, my heart went out to her. It is just too despicable,\u201d Lin Fan said, too impatient to explain the whole situation to him.</p><br/><p>Elder Zheng\u2019s tone was heavy. \u201cThere are still things like this happening? If this happened to me, I\u2019d kill those guys with a bullet each, but wait a minute. What are you going to do? If you need my help, I\u2019m all yours. Although I\u2019m old, I\u2019m still useful.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t really need your help. I just need to ask you this. If I found those cheaters, do you think I\u2019d be doing the right thing?\u201d Lin Fan asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cDefinitely. Elder Lin, what is your plan?\u201d Elder Zheng replied</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a secret, an absolute secret. However, what I\u2019m about to do may just break a few national laws. So you see, me calling you now is to see if you would agree and support what I am about to do.\u201d</p><br/><p>After living for so long, Elder Zheng knew exactly what moral conundrum Lin Fan was getting at. \u201cI understand. Let me tell you, the bottom line is this. As long as you don\u2019t hurt anyone innocent, compromise the people\u2019s interest or cause any trouble for the country, I think that there shouldn\u2019t be any moral issue with breaking a few laws.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Lin Fan said excitedly. A big shot was a big shot, and the way he handled things was far less rigid and more logical compared to most people.</p><br/><p>\u201cTruer than white gold. What do you think?\u201d Elder Zheng laughed.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was now full of confidence. \u201cElder Zheng, I must thank you. However, after I do this, I will definitely face the consequences. Why don\u2019t you let them lock me up for a month?\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Zheng was puzzled. What exactly did Elder Lin want to do? Didn\u2019t he already say that as long as he followed the three golden rules, there wouldn\u2019t be any problem? What did Elder Lin mean when he said that he had to be locked up for one month after he accomplished what he was going to do? He didn\u2019t think too much after that.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, as long as you don\u2019t break those three golden rules, I, Elder Zheng will be your guarantor.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGreat, thank you so much!\u201d Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>The phone hung up.</p><br/><p>Lin Fans heart was full of energy and fighting spirit as he readied himself for what was about to come.</p><br/><p>Cloud Street!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere did you go? Did you settle the problem?\u201d Fraud Tian hurried over, asking Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see in awhile,\u201d Lin Fan chuckled, not saying anymore after that.</p><br/><p>Thereafter, he took out his phone and wrote a post on Weibo.</p><br/><p>\u201cI, Master Lin, am about to do something in the name of justice. In the face of evil, I cannot back down. I am about to make a move and seek justice for the old lady.\u201d</p><br/><p>The netizens were all stunned.</p><br/><p>\u201c666\u2026 this is really about to go down\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin is about to defy the odds again.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKeep calm and absolutely do not use violence.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLin Fan is about to burst out, and the world is about to shake.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn, Master Lin. If you can solve this, my pet dog is yours.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Sitting in front of the computer.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan combed his hair backward and cracked his knuckles, readying himself.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan looked at him curiously. \u201cBrother Lin, what are you doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>I\u2019m about to fight a virtual battle,\u201d Lin Fan replied calmly.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh?\u201d Wu You Lan stood there stunned, not quite understanding what Brother Lin was saying.</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang stood there shocked, and under Lin Fan\u2019s instructions, he turned off his live broadcast. He stood next to Brother Lin, looking at him as his fingers flew across the keyboard mercilessly.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is unimaginable\u2026\u201d everyone said, shocked. All they saw was Lin Fan\u2019s ten fingers dancing across the keyboard without any hesitation.</p><br/><p>This was Autumn Sword Fish Killers consummate skill, the phantom butterfly hands. But compared to Autumn Sword Fish Killer, it was much more graceful and high-end.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed coldly. In his twenty plus years of existence, he had never done a more intense battle than this.</p><br/><p>*pattering sounds*</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to destroy the computer,\u201d Fraud Tian exclaimed, as he saw the numerous lines of gibberish on the computer screen.</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang was experienced with computers and knew what the screen was showing. But he realized that Brother Lin\u2019s skills were too superior for him to even understand. He looked on, confused and unable to understand what Lin Fan was typing.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan only knew how to attack but not conceal himself. With that in mind, he didn\u2019t have any misgivings as he went on an all out direct attack on the system.</p><br/><p>Violence, speed, and complete suppression.</p><br/><p>In some city, a middle-aged woman rode her electric scooter to a bank deposit machine.</p><br/><p>She had just received a call, with the other party telling her that she had won a lucky draw and all she had to do now was transfer twenty thousand dollars to claim her prize money of one hundred and eighty thousand dollars.</p><br/><p>She had her suspicions at first, but the other party managed to convince her by telling her about which lucky draw she had entered, her name and which city she stayed in.</p><br/><p>She really had entered that lucky draw back then.</p><br/><p>When she heard that the prize money was one hundred and eighty thousand dollars, she was moved and decided to try her luck.</p><br/><p>Just as she pressed the send button to transfer the money to the other party, she realized that the deposit machine had something wrong with it.</p><br/><p>The screen was frozen and after loading a while, it still didn\u2019t move.</p><br/><p>Suddenly!</p><br/><p>A sentence appeared on the ATM screen, causing her to be utterly shocked.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis bank account belongs to a cheater, do not remit money to this account.\u201d</p><br/><p>Just at this moment, the ATM page went back to the first screen, showing that the transaction had failed.</p><br/><p>Am I seeing things?</p><br/><p>Thereafter, without hesitation, she inputted the bank account of the other party, preparing to send money over again.</p><br/><p>This time, her face turned pale.</p><br/><p>Notification:</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you mentally handicapped? This bank account belongs to a scammer.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh!\u201d the middle-aged woman exclaimed, immediately pressing the emergency help button next to the ATM.</p><br/><p>\u201cQuickly come, your ATM machine has some problems. It just called me mentally handicapped\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The bank staff was speechless.</p></div>\n</div>"}

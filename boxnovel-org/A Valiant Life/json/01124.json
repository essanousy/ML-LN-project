Why is it ending so quickly?\u201d Wang Ming Yang suddenly responded with a face of confusion. His head was starting to throb.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at Wang Ming Yang and started laughing. \u201cIf we don\u2019t end it, what do you want to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, Lin Fan stood up and supported Wang Ming Yang. Then, he looked at Wu Huan Yue. \u201cHelp them to the room and let them sleep. They\u2019re already so drunk.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not drunk.\u201d Wang Ming Yang allowed himself to be supported by Lin Fan but he still continued talking.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded. \u201cYeah, you\u2019re not drunk. You\u2019re not drunk at all.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m really not drunk. \u201cWang Ming Yang\u2019s feet felt as if they were floating. But with Lin Fan\u2019s support, he was very stable.</p><br/><p>\u201cYep. No one said that you were drunk. Go and have a good sleep.\u201d Lin Fan didn\u2019t want to talk to a drunk person. No matter what he said, it would be useless.</p><br/><p>By the next day, he wouldn\u2019t be able to remember it.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy would I sleep? I\u2019m not even drunk. Let\u2019s continue drinking.\u201d Wang Ming Yang laughed maniacally.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright. We\u2019ll continue drinking in your room,\u201d said Lin Fan with a smile. He didn\u2019t care about what Wang Ming Yang said and just supported him into the room.</p><br/><p>When Wang Ming Yang laid down on the bed, all his energy seemed to dissipate instantly. He closed his eyes as he laid there as if he had found a very comfortable place.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Wu Huan Yue supported Xu Zi Le into the room as well.</p><br/><p>Xu Zi Le gestured with her hand. \u201cHuan Yue, isn\u2019t Sister Xu a good friend?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are. Sister Xu is a great person.\u201d This was Wu Huan Yue\u2019s first time taking care of a drunk person. She felt that Sister Xu was completely different from usual.</p><br/><p>\u201cMmm. That\u2019s good. Listen to your sister tonight. Go and sleep with Brother Lin, alright?\u201d said Xu Zi Le with a sill laugh. She had no idea of her surroundings.</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan heard that, he was f*cking stunned. <em>They\u2019ve been drinking all this time just for that?</em></p><br/><p>When Wu Huan Yue heard that, her cheeks turned as red as a baboon\u2019s butt. She hadn\u2019t expected Sister Xu to say such a thing so bluntly.</p><br/><p>\u201cSister Xu, you\u2019ve drunk too much,\u201d said Wu Huan Yue hastily. She couldn\u2019t let Brother Lin have any misunderstandings.</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t drink too much.\u201d Xu Zi Le waved her hand. \u201cHow could I have drunk too much? Answer me. Sleep with him, okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSister Xu, go to sleep,\u201d Wu Huan Yue quickly said.</p><br/><p>Xu Zi Le seemed as if she wouldn\u2019t go to sleep until she received an answer. \u201cOnce you say it, I\u2019ll go to sleep. If you don\u2019t say it, I won\u2019t sleep.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, the situation left Wu Huan Yue at a loss for words.</p><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue looked at Brother Lin and realized that Brother Lin was smiling as he looked at them. Her face instantly turned red as if she had been humiliated.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust get her to sleep first. They\u2019ve both drank too much,\u201d said Lin Fan with a smile.</p><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue nodded. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><br/><p>Once she said that, her cheeks immediately turned rosy with embarrassment.</p><br/><p>Xu Zi Li laughed. Then, she dragged Wu Huan Yue to the bedside and opened the drawer. She rustled her hand through the drawer as if she was looking for something. Finally, she managed to find it.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is for you. You have to protect yourself. Before you are ready, you mustn\u2019t let anything happen.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Wu Huan Yue saw the item in Sister Xu\u2019s hand, her cheeks became even redder.</p><br/><p>It was a condom.</p><br/><p>Then, she didn\u2019t say more. She quickly took it. If she didn\u2019t take it, who knew what else Sister Xu would say?</p><br/><p>At that moment, Xu Zi Le laid down on the bed and fell asleep.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go out. We\u2019ll let them have a good rest,\u201d said Lin Fan. He had seen what that item was. He really felt helpless about these two people.</p><br/><p>They were already so drunk but they were still thinking about that.</p><br/><p>He switched off the lights and closed the door.</p><br/><p>Outside.</p><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue didn\u2019t know what to say. \u201cBrother Lin, I\u2026 Sister Xu\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing. Alright, Let\u2019s clean up the table.\u201d Lin Fan looked at the table full of dishes and shook his head helplessly. He hadn\u2019t thought that, after coming here as a guest, they would be the ones clearing the table.</p><br/><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d Wu Huan Yue immediately nodded. Her heart was thumping furiously.</p><br/><p>Soon after, everything was done.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the time. It was already 1 AM. It was a little late. \u201cHuan Yue, I\u2019ll send you home.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d Wu Huan Yue nodded as if she didn\u2019t know how to say anything else.</p><br/><p><em>If Brother Lin said that we should stay here and sleep, what would I say? Or what would I do?</em></p><br/><p>They went outside.</p><br/><p>A cold breeze blew past.</p><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue stood there and said, \u201cBrother Lin, you\u2019ve drunk alcohol. I think it\u2019s better if you don\u2019t drive.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. I\u2019m perfectly fine,\u201d said Lin Fan. With the Wuxia class of knowledge, how could there be a problem? Right now, there wasn\u2019t any alcohol in his body at all.</p><br/><p>But Wu Huan Yue didn\u2019t know that. She still shook her head. \u201cNo. You\u2019ve consumed alcohol so you can\u2019t drive. Let\u2019s get a taxi.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright then, we\u2019ll get a taxi.\u201d Lin Fan nodded. He didn\u2019t want to speak more about this. He knew about the situation but Wu Huan Yue didn\u2019t.</p><br/><p>The two of them walked side by side. Wu Huan Yue had her head lowered all the way and didn\u2019t say a single word.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan spoke, \u201cHas your work been tiring lately?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not tiring. Everything has been pretty good,\u201d said Wu Huan Yue.</p><br/><p>\u201cMmm. If you\u2019re tired, you should rest for a few days. Work will never be finished but your health is very important,\u201d said Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d</p><br/><p>By the road, the two of them stood there. Very soon, a taxi stopped in front of them.</p><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue went to sit behind. Then, Lin Fan went to the back seats as well. He told the driver the location and the car started to move.</p><br/><p>The driver looked at the two of them. Because it was dark, he couldn\u2019t see very clearly. However, he felt that it was strange. In the middle of the night, they were actually changing locations. <em>What an interesting couple.</em></p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the scenery outside. He was a little tired.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Wu Huan Yue seemed to muster up a large amount of courage as she extended her hand and placed it on Lin Fan\u2019s arm.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan took a look and chuckled but didn\u2019t say anything.</p><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue\u2019s heart was thumping heavily. THen, she leaned her head against Lin Fan\u2019s shoulder and closed her eyes. She felt everything around her become silent.</p><br/><p>This was the first time she was so close to him.</p><br/><p>She felt excited and perhaps a little happy.</p><br/><p>It was a very long journey.</p><br/><p>But to Wu Huan Yue, time seemed to pass very quickly and they reached in just a while.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan got off the car. \u201cSir, please wait a moment. I\u2019ll send her upstairs and I\u2019ll come back down.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou really want me to wait?\u201d asked the driver. He was really curious. <em>You aren\u2019t going to stay the night? </em>You still want <em>to go somewhere else?</em></p><br/><p>\u201cYep. Please wait a moment. It\u2019ll be fast,\u201d said Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue said, \u201cBrother Lin, I can just go up myself.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved his hand. \u201cIt\u2019s fine. I\u2019ll send you up.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, the two of them walked towards the corridor.</p><br/><p>The driver looked at their back views and shook his head. \u201cHow strange. There are all kinds of people nowadays. I can\u2019t figure out what young people are thinking these days.\u201d</p><br/><p>Upstairs.</p><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue smiled as she said, \u201cBrother Lin, I\u2019ll go in now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded. \u201cMmm. Rest early. You must be really tired today.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m not tired. I\u2019m very happy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha. That\u2019s good. Alright, rest early. The driver is waiting downstairs.\u201d Lin Fan waved his hand and left.</p><br/><p>After Lin Fan left, Wu Huan Yue lowered her head and looked the condom that had been tightly gripped in her hand and was already covered in sweat. At that moment, who knew what she was thinking about?</p></div>\n</div>"}

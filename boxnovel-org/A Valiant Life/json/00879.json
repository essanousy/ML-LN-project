Everyone had been shocked beyond words after witnessing Lin Fan curing Mu Hui Min\u2019s illness.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-1\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Gradually, their shock turned into respect.</p><br/><p>Those that knew Master Lin heaved a sigh at how awesome Master Lin was. He was so extraordinary that he didn\u2019t seem like a normal human.</p><br/><p>However, their luck was really good, for them to have met Master Lin here. They knew that Master Lin wouldn\u2019t treat people whenever they requested it. The young lady had been able to receive his healing today because they were fated for it.</p><br/><p>A few days later.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan had stayed at the Wuxiang Taoist Temple for a few days. He felt as if he had become pretty close to the priests there. He felt that the time that he had spent there had been pretty worth it.</p><br/><p>Since Lin Fan had healed the lady of her illness, the \u2018Silent Priest\u2019 never played Weiqi, wielded his sword or even treated illnesses anymore. He just stuck to reading the fortunes of tourists occasionally.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-2\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>However, when Lin Fan pointed out some information that the \u2018Silent Priest\u2019 missed out, he stopped reading fortunes too.</p><br/><p>He decided to just meditate from then on.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Lin Fan just accompanied him as he wanted to get closer to the \u2018Silent Priest\u2019.</p><br/><p>Now that he had the major class of wuxia knowledge, he had to master the art of Buddhism meditation and he would be able to improve on it by sitting with the \u2018Silent Priest\u2019.</p><br/><p>Initially, the \u2018Silent Priest\u2019 had been unhappy with Lin Fan for daring to meditate with him. He decided to compete with Lin Fan to see who could meditate longer. But in the end, he gave up as well and decided to open up his mind.</p><br/><p>He felt that this youngster wasn\u2019t even a human. Who would be able to meditate for that long?</p><br/><p>Lin Fan had sat there for an entire day and hadn\u2019t even moved. The \u2018Silent Priest\u2019 couldn\u2019t even manage such a feat.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan wanted to stay at the Wuxiang Taoist temple for a longer period of time. After all, he couldn\u2019t rush to make friends with the people there.</p><br/><p>However, he suddenly received a call from Fraud Tian who told him that if he were to continue staying there, the shop would be destroyed.</p><br/><p>Then, Lin Fan thought about it and realized that he had been out for some time. If he were to continue staying, things might really go wrong back in Shanghai.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-3\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>On this day!</p><br/><p>At the exit of Wuxiang Taoist Temple.</p><br/><p>\u201cFriends, I am leaving now,\u201d Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>The \u2018Silent Priest\u2019 was so happy that he felt like crying. This man was finally leaving.</p><br/><p>This period had been a torturous one for him. It had been totally different from what he was used to. In the past, things had been better for him as he could live freely without any worries. He could play Weiqi, treat illnesses and wield his swords. In the eyes of others, he had been a virtuous and respectable priest.</p><br/><p>Also, he had been really proud of himself. However, he wasn\u2019t proud anymore after meeting Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Then, he thought of a saying.</p><br/><p>\u2018There will always be someone better. One must not be too boastful and arrogant.\u2019</p><br/><p>When he looked at Lin Fan who was leaving, the \u2018Silent Priest\u2019 nodded. He had finally been enlightened.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan sighed. \u201cMy friend, I wonder when I will be able to see you again after I leave today. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll be in Shanghai. If I have time, I will surely visit you again.\u201d</p><br/><p><em>Visit your sister instead\u2026 </em>The \u2018Silent Priest\u2019 had started to learn the way of a priest when he had been less than twenty years old. He had only managed to learn the ropes after years of experience. He really didn\u2019t want Lin Fan to be back again.</p><br/><p>He felt that he wouldn\u2019t be able to take the blow.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-4\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>During this period, he had been the only one who felt the suffering due to Lin Fan. He felt that Lin Fan had trumped him in all the aspects that he was good at. Furthermore, he hadn\u2019t even had any chance to retaliate.</p><br/><p>It was disappointing.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved his hand. \u201cMy friend, do not miss me. We will meet again if we are fated to. Remember, we\u2019re friends.\u201d</p><br/><p>He was really afraid that the \u2018Silent Priest\u2019 would forget him. Therefore, he reminded him that they were friends.</p><br/><p>The \u2018Silent Priest\u2019 was the one that he had to depend on if he wanted to become an immortal.</p><br/><p>The \u2018Silent Priest\u2019 just stood there quietly and looked at the silhouette that moved further and further away. Then, he teared and said, \u201cHe finally left.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, he was dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>The \u2018Silent Priest\u2019 opened his eyes and realized that he had broken his rule.</p><br/><p>Then, he turned around and realized that there weren\u2019t any disciples around him. Therefore, it wasn\u2019t counted as a failure. Anyway, he had already broken the rule few times throughout these years but he had been lucky that nobody had seen it.</p><br/><p>He had to continue training.</p><br/><p>The \u2018Silent Priest\u2019 felt that he was really smart. He looked in the sky and thought that his mentor must have been proud of him for what he had done.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Sichuan.</p><br/><p>Mu Dao Xiong was interviewed by a lot of reporters when they found out about his daughter\u2019s tragedy.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-5\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>In order to protect their interests, none of the reporters found out about the secret.</p><br/><p>However, the secret had been exposed by Mu Hui Min\u2019s friends. She told them about it and got the video from the bodyguards. She even sent it to her friends.</p><br/><p>The video slowly became viral online.</p><br/><p>To the reporters, it felt as if they had found a new land.</p><br/><p>\u2018The entrepreneur, Mu Dao Xiong\u2019s daughter contracted a terminal illness but she suddenly recovers. What is the hidden secret behind that?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Master Lin appeared at Wuxiang Taoist Temple. What\u2019s the meaning behind that?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Shanghai and Wuxiang Taoist Temple are almost 1000km apart. Master Lin went to such a far place. What is the hidden secret behind this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Magical. A medicinal pill healed her back to health.\u2019</p><br/><p>Every news platform started to post about it. Even Mu Hui Min hadn\u2019t expected it.</p><br/><p>However, she didn\u2019t really bother about it and immediately posted online to thank Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>\u2018Previously, I contracted many complicated illnesses and I had a mental condition. My body couldn\u2019t be moved. National and international hospitals saw me but they didn\u2019t find a solution to my problem. I thought that I\u2019d be like this forever in the future. However, I met Master Lin at Wuxiang Taoist temple. He is the one who saved me. I really want to say that I love you a lot, Master Lin. I will be a fan for life.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201c666\u2026 Speedy recovery!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin saved our goddess, how amazing!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, Master Lin will probably be over the moon to have such a hardcore fan like you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m so envious that Master Lin healed you personally.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s really powerful. What have you been hiding? How did you recover in an instant?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat can\u2019t be acting. How could it be so good?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The discussion online started to become more intense. After all, it was really extraordinary.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, a lot of netizens were curious as they didn\u2019t know why Master Lin would be at the Wuxiang Taoist temple. After all, the place was really far from Shanghai.</p><br/><p>At a certain hospital.</p><br/><p>Specialist Mao had been investigating the medicinal pill that Yang Huan had consumed. Furthermore, he wanted to know who had given it to him.</p><br/><p>These were his greatest doubts.</p><br/><p>He looked at his phone and read the news.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, when he saw this piece of news, Specialist Mao was dumbfounded. Then, he clicked on the video and he finally understood it.</p><br/><p><em>Medicinal pill!</em></p><br/><p><em>It\u2019s a medicinal pill again!</em></p><br/><p>Then, he quickly left the office. He needed to verify something.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p></div>\n</div>"}

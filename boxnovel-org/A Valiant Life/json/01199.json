He did not expect them to be in control even in Beijing. That was impressive.</p><br/><p>The reporters from Shanghai looked at Master Lin\u2019s eyes and knew that he had given them the green light to carry on.</p><br/><p>\u201cThose from Beijing can ask first. We have been interviewing Master Lin for years and we\u2019re already used to it. Please carry on,\u201d a reporter from Shanghai shouted.</p><br/><p>Those reporters from Beijing were ecstatic upon hearing that. They were impressed by their fellow workers from Shanghai.</p><br/><p>Master Lin was standing before them and they actually allowed them to go first. They felt that they were worthy of befriending.</p><br/><p>At the same time, they swore to treat these brothers from Shanghai passionately if they were to come again in the future.</p><br/><p>Then, the reporters from Beijing started to discuss among themselves. They wanted to decide on what to ask Lin Fan first.</p><br/><p>In the end, they decided on one.</p><br/><p>A female reporter asked nervously, \u201cMaster Lin, may I know how you\u2019re feeling now?\u201d</p><br/><p>When they asked that, the reporters from Shanghai whispered among themselves.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a little impromptu; they didn\u2019t think through it carefully.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s not a difficult question. We can\u2019t get the important information that we need.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, just forgive her. After all, she\u2019s a little nervous.\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporter\u2019s face became even redder. She felt that she had let down her fellow reporters by asking that childish question.</p><br/><p>Lin Fna smiled. \u201cI feel great. After all, it\u2019s my first time coming here to receive an award. That was pretty simple.\u201d</p><br/><p>The female reporter felt a little embarrassed as she felt that she had wasted an opportunity. However, her fellow reporters were kind towards her. After all, there were not many young female reporters like her these days, and they had to cherish her.</p><br/><p>Then, the reporters from Shanghai could finally ask their question.</p><br/><p>A tall reporter asked, \u201cMaster Lin, did you eat breakfast today?\u201d</p><br/><p>When he asked that, the reporters from Beijing laughed. They did not expect that at all.</p><br/><p>They felt that it was too simple.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was a little stunned.</p><br/><p>\u201cI was pretty busy and I didn\u2019t eat breakfast.\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporters from Shanghai started to discuss among themselves after hearing his answer.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin didn\u2019t eat breakfast. He was probably nervous about this. We have something to report!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin actually forgot to eat breakfast. It shows how important this event is to him.\u201d</p><br/><p>When the Beijing reporters heard what the reporters from Shanghai were discussing, they felt that perhaps their question was pretty meaningful.</p><br/><p>There was nothing wrong with that at all.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said helplessly, \u201cLet\u2019s continue quickly. I have to go in ten minutes.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Shanghai reporters waved their hands. \u201cHey, you can continue asking. We\u2019re done here.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Beijing reporters were allowed to stand right in front of Master Lin as the Shanghai reporters went behind them. They were stunned and they felt the love from them.</p><br/><p>This was the most loving bunch of reporters that they had ever seen. In the past, reporters would be barging their way in for interviews. Furthermore, their clothes would be damaged from the pushing and shoving, and they would not even get any opportunities to speak to the person.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled as he did not expect that at all. However, he realised that perhaps it was because the Shanghai reporters were getting sick of interviewing him. He thought that maybe the reporters would not even be there if they did not want the latest news from him.</p><br/><p>However, he thought about it further and realised that it was normal for them to be sick of it anyway.</p><br/><p>Then, the Beijing reporters surrounded Lin Fan and asked him various questions. Lin Fan just answered them seriously. He also tried his best to answer those questions that were more complicated.</p><br/><p>Ten minutes passed quickly.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the time. \u201cEveryone, let\u2019s end the interview here. The event is about to start. We can talk again after the event.\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporters nodded. \u201cAlright, congratulations, Master Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, fame really follows merit.\u201d</p><br/><p>After asking the questions that they wanted to ask, the reporters felt great. They felt that Master Lin was indeed a great person and they congratulated him.</p><br/><p>They had interviewed a lot of people before, and not many of them were as nice as Master Lin.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, the Shanghai reporters were also really nice. They even asked to exchange WeChat so that they could become friends.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan boarded the car.</p><br/><p>Secretary Chen chuckled. \u201cMaster Lin, you seem to be very popular.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSecretary Chen, don\u2019t make fun of me. I\u2019m not popular. They just like me a lot,\u201d Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha,\u201d Secretary Chen laughed as he drove off.</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang and the others followed him behind. They all had their required entry passes for the events since they were part of Lin Fan\u2019s group of friends and relatives.</p><br/><p>\u201cBros, I feel a little nervous. I\u2019ve never been here before.\u201d</p><br/><p>The netizens started flooding the comments section.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Yang, you\u2019re so awesome. Here\u2019s a big like.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s give him some presents. Thanks to Brother Yang, we get to see how it\u2019s like.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m really envious that Brother Yang can be there physically while we can only get to watch from our screens.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang smiled after reading the comments. It was clearly different from watching it from their screens.</p><br/><p>\u201cNotification: This broadcast has been featured on the list of popular live streams.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYo, Brother Yang is up again!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe broadcasting platform should know what Brother Yang is streaming. It\u2019s going to attract a lot of viewers.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, Brother Yang is going to become a famous streamer.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, let\u2019s continue donating! Will the next comment please continue the chain? Don\u2019t embarrass our Brother Yang.\u201d</p><br/><p><em>refresh</em></p><br/><p>There were a lot of gifts being donated. However, these gifts were not donated to Zhao Zhong Yang.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Yang, these are for Master Lin, not you. Don\u2019t be greedy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang looked at the notifications helplessly. He felt as if he was abandoned by them.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

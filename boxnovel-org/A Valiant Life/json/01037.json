I don\u2019t think you should do that. Just think about it. If you buy such an expensive gift and your other classmates see that, they will look for you whenever they have any problems and you\u2019ll have to buy them something expensive as well,\u201d Huang Yun Ge said with a look of dissatisfaction in his voice. They had only just reached Zhongzhou, so the natural thing was for them to wait for the other party to come and receive them. However, his father had not even bothered to contact the other party and just came here straight to the department store.</p><br/><p>Also, the things that he was buying were not cheap at all. Huang Yun Ge felt a heartache even by looking at the price tag. To him, there was no point buying something so expensive. It would just go to waste as they did not even have a good relationship with the other party. Also, the other party was not able to offer them any help in return.</p><br/><p>Huang Ting looked at his son and said, \u201cHow can you think like that? I had a pretty good relationship with this Uncle Lin back then. This is his 50th birthday so I should do something a little more special for him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNext time, when one of my classmates calls for help, if I have the time, I have to go and help them. You can\u2019t just refuse to help people based on their status. You have to understand that life can change in an instant. Our fortune won\u2019t last forever. If you ignore people while you are rich, when you have nothing at all, do you think people will come and help you?\u201d Huang Ting was trying to teach his son some life principles.</p><br/><p>Huang Yun Ting completely ignored that. He just shrugged his shoulders and said, \u201cAh, dad, I think your thinking is wrong. When the time comes, they will definitely come to help you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet me tell you this. You better be well behaved tomorrow. You better not be so sloppy the whole day.\u201d Huang Ting did not want to say much more.</p><br/><p>\u201cGot it,\u201d Huang Yun Ge said as he let out a sigh. There was not much that he could say. \u201cDad, can you hurry up? Just randomly choose a gift. I have to go and meet my friends.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLook. This one looks pretty good. A 3 or 4 thousand dollar watch is enough.\u201d</p><br/><p>Huang Ting ignored his son\u2019s words. He pointed at the 20 thousand dollar Longines watch and said, \u201cThis one. By credit card.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d the staff member said as he nodded his head and proficiently did his job.</p><br/><p>The next day!</p><br/><p>Usually, Lin Fan would wake up at around 8 or 9 AM. However, today, he was loudly awoken at 7 AM.</p><br/><p>The guests could just make their way to the place at 11 AM. However, since they were the hosts, they definitely had to wake up earlier.</p><br/><p>\u201cSon, quickly get up. Don\u2019t sleep anymore,\u201d his mother said as she entered the room and started to pull his blanket.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cMum, stop pulling my blanket, I\u2019m already so old.\u201d</p><br/><p>His mother replied with annoyance, \u201cWhy? Just because you\u2019re old, I can\u2019t pull your blanket? Hurry up. Go out and help your father to prepare.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, okay,\u201d Lin Fan helplessly said. He could not say anything else in response and could only just drag himself out of bed. When he reached the living room, he realized that some of his relatives had come.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello, aunts and uncles,\u201d Lin Fan said. His father\u2019s few siblings were already enough but they had invited even more than that.</p><br/><p>However, his family\u2019s relationship was still pretty good. Although there were times of friction, these were small matters that were not the concern of the younger generation and were for the older generation to settle amongst themselves.</p><br/><p>His second uncle said, \u201cLittle Fan, you\u2019ve done a great job planning your father\u2019s birthday all by yourself.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed and said, \u201cI definitely had to do a good job.\u201d</p><br/><p>His second aunt said, \u201cI knew that you were the filial one, Lil\u2019 Fan. However, from what your mother tells me, you still haven\u2019t found a girlfriend yet. You better quickly find one so to fulfill your mother\u2019s wishes. After that, once you give her grandchildren, all her wishes will be complete.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed and replied, \u201cI\u2019ll find one soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>His third aunt, who was standing at the side, laughed and said, \u201cYou really are amazing Lil\u2019 Fan. I heard from your father that you\u2019ve been making a name for yourself in Shanghai, even appearing on television a few times.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan just laughed and did not say anything to that.</p><br/><p>It seemed like his father was not very in depth when it came to explaining these sorts of things to his relatives. Perhaps it was a good thing as he did not want to have to deal with all sorts of other problems.</p><br/><p>After listening to some instructions, Lin Fan left and got to work.</p><br/><p>He waited in the neighborhood for a while for Bai Ke to drive his car over. After which, the two of them went over to the fireworks store, collected the fireworks they had ordered and brought them over to the hotel.</p><br/><p>With regards to the alcohol and all the other stuff, they had also already made arrangements for those.</p><br/><p>After finishing all of that, they took a quick check of the time and realized that it was reaching 10 AM already.</p><br/><p>The two of them were sitting in the car and smoking as Bai Ke said, \u201cBrother Fan, you didn\u2019t invite your friends this time around?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled and replied, \u201cWhy would I invite my friends? It\u2019s my father\u2019s birthday so what right do I have to invite my own friends?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not right. You\u2019ve been doing so well in Shanghai and have made so many connections. Furthermore, this whole meal was organized by you, it\u2019s only right that you invite some of your friends over,\u201d Bai Ke said. Naturally, he knew all about the name Lin Fan had made for himself in Shanghai. If not for him having known Lin Fan for so long, he would not dare believe that it was true.</p><br/><p>At the same time, it also made him feel very proud inside. After all, he was good friends with the Master Lin who was widely discussed on the Internet.</p><br/><p>His relationship with Lin Fan had been steady all this while. There were times when he would boast to others about being friends with him and they would not believe him at all. However, he still felt extremely good inside.</p><br/><p>However, if he was just talking to an ordinary person, he did not dare bring it up in case the other party would feel that he was just trying to show off.</p><br/><p>From the early morning all the way until 11 AM, Lin Fan\u2019s mother and father had been busy bringing their groups of relatives over.</p><br/><p>Some of that had come from the rural side of Zhongzhou. Thus, they were super happy when they saw the hotel. After all, this hotel was a lot more high class than the banquets that they were used to going.</p><br/><p>In their eyes, Elder Lin was very rich, to be able to hold a banquet at such a huge hotel.</p><br/><p>Bai Ke also got to work. His main role was to bring one group of relatives upstairs and then come down and bring more of them up.</p><br/><p>At the entrance of the hotel.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan felt a little helpless as he said, \u201cDad, why did you have to bring me down here? Can\u2019t you welcome your classmates yourself?\u201d</p><br/><p>His father replied, \u201cWhat do you mean welcome them myself? Your aunts and uncles are all here so what does it say if my own son isn\u2019t here with me as well?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan helplessly replied, \u201cOkay, okay. Whatever you say, dad.\u201d</p><br/><p>Very quickly, another group of people came.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey\u2019re here, they\u2019re here,\u201d his father was very excited upon seeing them. It was as if he was seeing a group of friends that he had not met in years. The excitement was clearly plastered all over his face. Then, he rushed up to meet them. The moment he was face to face with them, he gave each one of them a huge hug.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s you Elder Chen. It\u2019s been almost twenty years since we last met.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Zhang! The last time we met was about nine years ago. That time, when you came over to Zhongzhou, we didn\u2019t have the chance to properly sit down for some drinks. This time, you can\u2019t run away. We have to go for some drinks.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWow, I\u2019m really touched. I sent that message in the group but I didn\u2019t expect you guys to all come.\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment his father saw all his classmates that he had not seen in a long time, he was filled with excitement and was smiling like a kid.</p><br/><p>\u201cSon, come over here and greet them. This is Uncle Chen.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is Uncle Zhang.\u201d</p><br/><p>His father pointed at them one by one. Then, Lin Fan put a smile on his face and extended his hand, saying, \u201cHello Uncle Chen.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHello, Uncle Zhang.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHello, Auntie Wang.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even though he had never met his father\u2019s classmates before, he still treated them with a huge amount of respect. After all, they were his father\u2019s classmates so he had to give his father face. At the same time, he did not want to give them the idea that his father had not raised his own son properly.</p><br/><p>However, from Lin Fan\u2019s point of view, these people did not really have too much interest in him.</p><br/><p>\u201cWow, Elder Lin\u2019s son has grown up so much already.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Lin, he really looks like you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Inside, he was laughing as well. It seemed like, in the minds of these uncles and aunties, he was just a little brat. After that, he just returned to his father\u2019s side and stopped behind him, not saying anything else.</p></div>\n</div>"}

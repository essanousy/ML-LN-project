It was the best teacher-training college in the whole nation. She felt that she was the most eligible one and it would be illogical for her to not get the job.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am from Huadong Normal University.\u201d</p><br/><p>The others continued to say where they were from. Some of them were more educated than the others and the worst ones were the third-tier colleges.</p><br/><p>They were really miles apart from the others.</p><br/><p>They felt that it would be almost impossible for the less educated teachers to be employed because they had already lost to the others based on their certification.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-2\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>*cough*</p><br/><p>Then, a gentle cough could be heard.</p><br/><p>The crowd turned and were stunned.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin\u2026\u201d Lin Fan nodded to the applicants and walked into the interview room. \u201cEveryone, please come in.\u201d</p><br/><p>The crowd was stunned. They felt that something was wrong. Why did he ask everyone to go in together?</p><br/><p>At the interview table, Lin Fan was holding onto the list of names in his hands and Zhao Zhong Yang was sitting beside him. They were whispering to each other and pointing at names.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded and knew what he was going to do next.</p><br/><p>The applicants sat there nervously. They wondered what was going to happen next.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-3\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Then, Lin Fan started to speak.</p><br/><p>\u201cThose that I call, please stand up.\u201d</p><br/><p>He immediately started to call their names one by one. The applicants were really dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>\u201cJiang Hui.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Hui was shocked when she heard Master Lin call her name. Although she didn\u2019t know what was going to happen next, she felt that something was wrong.</p><br/><p>She was from the worst in terms of academic qualifications. She was from a third-tier school.</p><br/><p>\u201cYe Lan.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cZhang Ke Yi.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cZhou Meng.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-4\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>The names were being called out one by one.</p><br/><p>There were a hundred applicants and only thirty names were called.</p><br/><p>Those people became really anxious after hearing their names. They wondered what was going to happen next.</p><br/><p>Those that didn\u2019t get called felt relieved.</p><br/><p>Because they realized that many of those that didn\u2019t get called up were from top teacher-training colleges. They felt that the application was based on their education levels.</p><br/><p>They thought that those that had been called were ineligible and they were the only ones left that would proceed to the next round.</p><br/><p>That must have been the case.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan and Zhao Zhong Yang discussed with each other to confirm that nobody had been left out.</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang looked at the applicants carefully and nodded.</p><br/><p>Jiang Hui and the others were really nervous. They felt that they were going to be axed because they had failed in quite a number of applications on their first attempts.</p><br/><p>They didn\u2019t have any connections and they felt that it was difficult to find a job with their level of education.</p><br/><p>At that moment, something shocking happened.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-5\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Lin Fan stood up and smiled. \u201cCongratulations, all of you have been employed. As for the contract details, I will send them to you later. If you have any queries about welfare benefits, please speak up.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAs for those that didn\u2019t get selected, I sincerely apologize. I will reimburse your travel fare\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was really satisfied with the number of successful applicants. It was just the right number of people.</p><br/><p>Those applicants that had been employed were stunned. They didn\u2019t know why they had been employed and they were confused.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s unfair.\u201d Then, a lady stood up and said angrily, \u201cAre you trying to prank us? I graduated from the Capital Normal University. Who is more eligible than me? Why am I not selected?\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, people started to stand up to speak.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. Why are they selected? Some of them aren\u2019t even as qualified as us. Why can\u2019t we be employed?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI actually am a fan of you. I didn\u2019t know that you\u2019d be so unfair.\u201d</p><br/><p>The room was in chaos. The applicants that hadn\u2019t been selected were furious. They felt that they had gotten pranked.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan felt really helpless. \u201cEveryone, I\u2019m sorry. Our institution doesn\u2019t look at certifications. We look at people\u2019s character and hearts. Of course, I\u2019m not saying all of you are heartless. It just doesn\u2019t fulfill our requirements. Please understand us and we will reimburse your travel fare\u2026\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-6\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Those that hadn\u2019t been selected left angrily after hearing that.</p><br/><p>\u201cForget it. I can afford the travel fare.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go. What bullsh*t is this\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe kids will never be well-educated since you hired those with such poor qualifications.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shook his head after hearing those words. He just remained silent as nothing could be said to appease them.</p><br/><p>Those that hadn\u2019t been selected left.</p><br/><p>Only those that had been selected stayed.</p><br/><p>\u201cPass the contracts to them for them to see,\u201d Lin Fan said to Zhao Zhong Yang.</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang nodded and passed the contracts down. The contract details had been written by Lin Fan and it had been written really clearly.</p><br/><p>They were ecstatic as they looked carefully at the contract details.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-7\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u2018Probation period: 1 month, salary: $3000.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018After the probation period, the salary will be $5500 after taxes. The travel fare will be reimbursed as $500. Call charges will be reimbursed as $200. Reimbursement for living expenses will be $800. All three meals will be provided and there will be eight days of break every month. Furthermore, there will be year-end bonuses.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Working hours are 8 AM to 11 AM and 2 PM to 5 PM. \u2018</p><br/><p>The crowd was stunned after reading the contract details.</p><br/><p>They hadn\u2019t expected it to be so high. Their monthly salary was about ten grand after including everything.</p><br/><p>They felt that everything felt so surreal. Someone pinched herself and realized that it wasn\u2019t a dream. It was reality.</p><br/><p>After a moment, Lin Fan started to speak, \u201cDoes anyone have anything to say about the details? If so, you can tell me about it along with a logical explanation. We will give everyone their satisfactory salaries.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m satisfied, very satisfied.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d</p><br/><p>They were extremely happy, so much so that they felt like they were going to fly.</p><br/><p>If they were able to get past the probationary period their pay would be even higher. Everything was so great.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded. \u201cAlright, that\u2019s great to hear. When the teaching block is completed, you can start working. My request is very simple. You have to be caring and patient when you teach the kids. You should know that these kids are orphans. They\u2019re different from other kids. Please take note of that.\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-8\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Everyone nodded after hearing that. They felt that they had a huge responsibility.</p><br/><p>Those that hadn\u2019t been selected were furious. They started to post their thoughts online.</p><br/><p>The next day!</p><br/><p>A news article was posted online\u2026</p></div>\n</div>"}

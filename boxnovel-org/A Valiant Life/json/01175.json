The corner\u2019s in such a bad shape. Are you sure we can use it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Li replied, \u201cMaster Lin, you don\u2019t understand. This is a normal occurrence. There is no problem with it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang was stunned. He felt that he had let his brother down.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan did not say anything else. He just continued to inspect the other parts of the artificial limbs one by one.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, he stopped and stared at a particular artificial limb in shock. Then, he took some tools and inspected it further.</p><br/><p>*click*</p><br/><p>Some components dropped out. It seemed like they were not properly screwed together. After further inspection, he realised that the parts were too small.</p><br/><p>\u201cDirector Li, are you telling me this is okay?\u201d Lin Fan asked as he picked the parts up and stuffed them back into the artificial limb. Then, he waved it around in the air and the parts fell out again.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang was furious after seeing that. \u201cDirector Li, how did you manage to approve these artificial limbs after inspection?\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Li was stunned. \u201cDirector Wang, something must have gone wrong. These components have nothing wrong. Furthermore, they\u2019re not essential parts. It must have been a mistake.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you sure there\u2019s nothing wrong? Who built these? Shouldn\u2019t they have realised this?\u201d Wang Ming Yang shouted.</p><br/><p>Director Li continued, \u201cDirector Wang, why do you think Secretary Chen asked me over? They value our professional skills. I can assure you that there will not be any problem. I have done this for so many years and I\u2019ve seen this happen countless times. It\u2019s perfectly normal.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang replied, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to mention Secretary Chen. If he were to find out about this, he\u2019d reprimand you for sure.\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Li said, \u201cDirector Wang, Secretary Chen doesn\u2019t understand this and he won\u2019t say anything about it. Regardless of who you ask, they would also say that this is perfectly fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan picked up his phone and dialed a number.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, what are you doing?\u201d Director Li was stunned and asked anxiously. ( .c om )</p><br/><p>In the meeting room, Secretary Chen was discussing about the Shanghai Industrial Zone\u2019s situation when his phone suddenly rang. Usually, he would not entertain any phone calls during work, but when he saw the caller ID, he quickly picked up.</p><br/><p>The other people in the meeting room were stunned. They wondered who was the caller that made Secretary Chen pick up his phone.</p><br/><p>After all, they knew that Secretary Chen would not usually do such a thing during work. Hence, they knew that it must have been about something important.</p><br/><p>Upon picking up, Lin Fan started to talk.</p><br/><p>\u201cSecretary Chen, the representative that you sent is so irresponsible.\u201d</p><br/><p>Secretary Chen was stunned. \u201cWhat is it? Did something go wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>They held the matter regarding the perfect artificial limbs in high regard. They wanted everything to proceed smoothly. Now that Master Lin called him, something must have gone wrong.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan continued, \u201cSecretary Chen, the production of the perfect artificial limbs was entirely entrusted to your people. This representative was sent by you. However, the components are not compatible. I just checked ten of them and three had problems with the components. Of course, I\u2019m not expecting everything to be perfect, but this incidence rate is too high.</p><br/><p>\u201cSecretary Chen, if you are not sincere about partnering us, you don\u2019t have to force yourself to do so. We can do it on our own.\u201d</p><br/><p>Secretary Chen was stunned. \u201cMaster Lin, wait for me. I\u2019ll be there in a minute.\u201d</p><br/><p>He felt that things must have gone really wrong. He had to resolve this promptly, as they knew the importance of this matter. After hearing what Master Lin said, he felt the need to go down to take a look so that it would be prevented in the future.</p><br/><p>\u201cSecretary, we\u2019re not done here,\u201d the surrounding members of the board whispered.</p><br/><p>Secretary Chen waved his hand, \u201cLet\u2019s end the meeting for now and head straight to the factory.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><br/><p>In the factory.</p><br/><p>Director Li furrowed his brows, \u201cMaster Lin, there\u2019s really nothing wrong. Isn\u2019t it a little overboard for you to call Secretary Chen?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved his hand, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t know that. Since Secretary Chen doesn\u2019t know anything about this industry, let\u2019s get him to judge this then.\u201d</p><br/><p>He did not expect this to happen on the first day even before anything proper took flight.</p><br/><p>After some time, Secretary Chen and a few others arrived.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, what is it?\u201d Secretary Chen asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cSecretary Chen,\u201d Director Li greeted upon seeing him.</p><br/><p>( .c om ) Lin Fan replied, \u201cSecretary Chen, come and have a look at this. He said this is perfectly fine. What do you think?\u201d</p><br/><p>Secretary Chen walked forward and inspected the components. He was a little far-sighted, but he could still somewhat see them.</p><br/><p>\u201cThese components\u2026\u201d Secretary Chen sighed and placed them down. Then, he looked at Director Li, \u201cI need an explanation.\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Li was stunned. \u201cSecretary Chen, this is perfectly normal. There\u2019s no problem.\u201d</p><br/><p>Secretary Chen waved his hand. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me that. I can tell if something is good or bad. I\u2019m not that stupid.\u201d</p><br/><p>*slam*</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Secretary Chen slammed the table loudly.</p><br/><p>\u201cDirector Li, how did you pass these components through inspection?\u201d Secretary Chen asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat, I\u2026\u201d Director Li did not know how to answer. Cold sweat droplets started forming on his forehead.</p><br/><p>He really did not know what to say because something must have gone wrong somewhere.</p><br/><p>Secretary Chen added, \u201cMaster Lin, don\u2019t worry. I will do a thorough investigation about this. This is my problem. I will take full responsibility for it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang replied, \u201cSecretary Chen, we can\u2019t blame you for this. We can only say that you trusted the wrong person. If these components were to be used on these artificial limbs, it is difficult to foresee what would happen in the future. Furthermore, you should question the manufacturers thoroughly. Initially, we were worried that the workers might not have anywhere to settle down at. Therefore, we agreed to proceed with this business. Now that this has happened, who will be responsible for it if something were to go wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Li became anxious. \u201cSecretary Chen, I really don\u2019t know anything about this. It really is nothing significant. It would be too early to make any announcements during the conference now. If\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Secretary Chen interrupted, \u201cThe conference? Just admit your mistakes. I will investigate this and hold the right person responsible for this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan added, \u201cYeah, the news conference should be changed to an apology ceremony. Please be stringent in the selection of the components. The manufacturer should be changed too. If you do not cherish this opportunity, you can\u2019t blame anyone else. You wanted to save costs on the quality of the components. Completely unacceptable.\u201d</p><br/><p>After hearing that, Director Li was stunned.</p><br/><p>He did not expect to be exposed.</p><br/><p>How did they even find out about this just by looking at the small components?</p></div>\n</div>"}

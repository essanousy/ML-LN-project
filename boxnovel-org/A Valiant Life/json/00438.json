Your mum!</p><br/><p>Translator: Sparrow Translations Editor: Sparrow Translations</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang was in a daze. He pushed Wu Yun Gang\u2019s hand away. \u201cBrother Wu, I\u2019m okay. I can still drink.\u201d</p><br/><p>If Wu Yun Gang were to let go of his hand, he\u2019d be an idiot. He could tell what was happening. At the start, Young Master Jiang had placed three bottles of wine there and he knew that something was wrong. After all, he had experienced it before but he had only been forced to drink three glasses. Although he had gotten drunk that time, he had been able to tolerate it since he was an experienced businessman.</p><br/><p>But now, things were going awfully wrong.</p><br/><p>After three glasses, Wang Ming Yang was already drunk. If he were to take a break, he probably would be fine afterward.</p><br/><p>However, Young Master Jiang started to make things difficult for him. He initiated a toast with Wang Ming Yang to drink the whole glass.</p><br/><p>The main thing was about giving face. If he didn\u2019t give any face to Young Master Jiang, Young Master Jiang would probably not bother about him.</p><br/><p>Initially, Wu Yun Gang had told Wang Ming Yang not to drink anymore. However, it was useless, Wang Ming Yang just ignored him. Furthermore, Wang Ming Yang was young and vigorous, he really finished it with one gulp.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin said you should stop drinking,\u201d Wu Yun Gang said with a serious tone.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang waved his hand. \u201cI\u2019m okay. I know my own body.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy a*s. Look at yourself now. Do you think you still can drink?\u201d Wu Yun Gang scolded. Then, he looked at Young Master Jiang. \u201cYoung Master Jiang, please let him off. He can\u2019t drink anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>Young Master Jiang laughed. \u201cReplace him then.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright,\u201d Wu Yun Gang agreed and drank a glass. However, he was way soberer than Wang Ming Yang.</p><br/><p>When Wang Ming Yang was pouring the wine, Young Master Jiang stuck out two fingers. \u201cYou have to drink two glasses. I don\u2019t offer toasts to just anyone. I won\u2019t be petty about him not drinking but you have to drink two glasses to replace him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Yun Gang stopped. If he really drank it, he would definitely be drunk. Who knew what would follow next?</p><br/><p>The three other youngsters started to laugh too.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you not going to give Young Master Jiang face?\u201d Young Master Zhao said while laughing. He was a little fat. It was as if he was watching a show.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo\u2026\u201d Wu Yun Gang shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just drinking alcohol. Why are you so hesitant?\u201d Young Master Huang interrupted. \u201cYou should know what kind of person Young Master Jiang is. Once you get his favor, your projects will definitely run smoothly until the end. If you do not drink it, do you believe that your projects will face a lot of difficulties?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI believe that.\u201d Wu Yun Gang nodded. He really believed it. Although he was rich, he couldn\u2019t match up to the authority that Young Master Jiang had.</p><br/><p>Then, Sister Yan started to smile. She knew that Young Master Jiang was trying to make things difficult for them.</p><br/><p>In the past, a lot of wealthy men had been played by Young Master Jiang and they drank so much that they started to question their lives.</p><br/><p>However, some of the people were firm and they just left. But how could they have left so easily?</p><br/><p>They would be badly beaten up at the door and she didn\u2019t know what happened after that. However, most of them would probably have gone back to Beijing.</p><br/><p>This was a goldmine and there were wealthy men everywhere. Those foreign wealthy men that entered Beijing couldn\u2019t match up to those in Beijing. They didn\u2019t even know how to survive in a place like this.</p><br/><p>Sister Yan said, \u201cChief Wu, why not just drink it? Two glasses aren\u2019t a lot. You can drink pretty well anyway.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Yun Gang shook his head helplessly. He had no choice but to call Master Lin. However, he felt that even if Master Lin came over, it\u2019d be useless.</p><br/><p>After all, he had been involved in such things for a longer time than Master Lin and even he was helpless. How could Master Lin know what to do?</p><br/><p>He knew the Chief of the police force but he knew that the chief would definitely back down from these few wealthy youngsters.</p><br/><p>Young Master Jiang looked at Wu Yun Gang and patted Wang Ming Yang on his shoulder. \u201cChief Wang, you\u2019ve been doing business in Shanghai. Given your status, shouldn\u2019t you be close to the notable leaders in Shanghai?</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t really know them but we\u2019ve met a couple of times before.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, met a couple of times? What if I told you that the notable leaders all have to call me Young Master Jiang? Do you believe that?\u201d Young Master Jiang asked.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang paused for a moment. He wasn\u2019t thinking about it, he just couldn\u2019t tolerate the alcohol in his body. \u201cI don\u2019t believe it. Who are you to compare to them? It\u2019s not comparable\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly, everyone became quiet.</p><br/><p>Young Master Jiang violently slammed the cup on the table in front of Wang Ming Yang, \u201cIf you respect me, finish this now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Young Master Zhao and the others smiled and looked at Wang Ming Yang. They were simply playing with Wang Ming Yang.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang was too drunk to think. It was as if everything he was looking at was twisted.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll finish it.\u201d Wang Ming Yang stretched out his hand and took the cup. When Wu Yun Gang saw that, he became extremely anxious. He pushed the bottles of wine on the table away. \u201cYoung Master Jiang, what do you guys want? He is my friend. Are you guys trying to make things difficult for me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Young Master Jiang looked at Wu Yun Gang, \u201cChief Wu, what do you mean? You wanted to introduce him to us. Didn\u2019t you want him to join the businesses here? If he can\u2019t even handle these things, how long do you think he can last in this business? Did you think that you could do all these hand gestures in front of me just because I\u2019m in a good mood today? I\u2019ll just put it this way. Either one of you has to drink today.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung Master Jiang, please be merciful. I will make it up to you in the future, is that okay?\u201d Wu Yun Gang said. At the same time, he was wondering when Master Lin would come over. If there was one more person, he could bring Wang Ming Yang away too.</p><br/><p>He knew that these wealthy youngsters were tough to handle. They had a bad attitude and were extremely arrogant.</p><br/><p>Today, it was clear that they were just trying to bully him. It wasn\u2019t for any introductory purposes at all.</p><br/><p>If Wang Ming Yang continued drinking, he might really die from it.</p><br/><p><em>Bam!</em></p><br/><p>Then, the door was flung open.</p><br/><p>Wu Yun Gang was elated when he saw the person that was standing outside.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan pushed the door open and furrowed his brows when he saw what was happening in the private room. Then, he rushed over to Wang Ming Yang. \u201cWang Ming Yang, wake up.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang was in a daze. Then, he opened his eyes and smiled. \u201cHey, bro, why are you here\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan heaved a sigh of relief when he saw Wang Ming Yang open his eyes. \u201cIf I\u2019m not here, you\u2019d be dead.\u201d</p><br/><p>Young Master Zhao stood up unhappily when he saw a stranger walk in. \u201cWho are you? Who gave you permission to come in? He has to finish the wine before he leaves today.\u201d Then, he walked over to Lin Fan and placed one hand on his shoulder.</p><br/><p>\u201cDrink your f*cking mum\u2026\u201d Lin Fan shrugged his shoulder and slapped him. Young Master Zhao flew aside. Then, Lin Fan just helped Wang Ming Yang to the side of the dustbin in the room. He pressed his finger on Wang Ming Yang\u2019s abdomen.</p><br/><p><em>Gag</em></p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang\u2019s abdomen suddenly contracted and a pungent smell came from his mouth. Then, he started vomiting.</p><br/><p>In the end, a yellow liquid came out of his mouth. It was bile.</p><br/><p>\u201cI told you to stay safe and you still ended up like that,\u201d Lin Fan shook his head and said.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

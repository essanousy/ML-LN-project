Through Lin Fan\u2019s hard work, the Welfare Institute had completely changed. On certain open grounds, construction workers were doing construction work. They were building places for the children to study.</p><br/><p>The chief of the construction team knew that they were building a place of study for children who had no homes of their own. Hence, he was naturally very serious and responsible. In every regard, he did close inspections to prevent his workers from doing shoddy work. If he found anything that was not up to standard, he would get them to start all over again.</p><br/><p>To him, building a school building for these children was a great, charitable deed. If he didn\u2019t put his heart into it, it would be a sin.</p><br/><p>Zhu Wei Wei asked curiously, \u201cDirector Huang, what are they building here?</p><br/><p>Director Huang replied, \u201cThey\u2019re building a classroom building for the children. The children here have some special needs. If they were to go to school elsewhere, the schools would be too full and they wouldn\u2019t be able to enter. Furthermore, these children are not very young anymore and they should be receiving an education.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yang Mu muttered, \u201cThis Children\u2019s Welfare Institute has a lot of money. Just building this would require at least several millions.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Zhu Wei Wei heard this, she shot a glare at Yang Mu.</p><br/><p>Director Huang smiled, \u201cActually, we don\u2019t have much money but these children have met a good person and that person has helped to raise funds for them.</p><br/><p>When Zhu Wei Wei heard this, she nodded as she felt grateful to that person. To donate a sum of money to the Welfare Institute, that person must have really been a good person.</p><br/><p>Far away, Lil\u2019 Fatty was pushing a wheelchair. The child in the wheelchair was missing a leg but even so, the two children were chatting cheerfully. They seemed very happy.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood morning, Director.\u201d The two of them displayed child-like smiles when they saw Director Huang. Although they were young, they were much more mature than average children.</p><br/><p>They were very content with their current lives. Compared to last time, when they would get beaten and scolded for being disobedient, this was hundreds and thousands of times better.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere are you two going?\u201d asked Director Huang with a smile.</p><br/><p>Lil\u2019 Fatty replied, \u201cSister Xiang Xiang says that she wants to see the big car, so I\u2019m pushing her to that side to take a look.\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Huang patted Lil\u2019 Fatty on the head. \u201cMmm, very good, Lil\u2019 Fatty. You know that you should help your friends. Come, greet these older brothers and sisters. These brothers and sisters are volunteers and they\u2019re here to visit you all.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood morning, Big Brothers and Sisters.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Wei Wei squatted down. \u201cNice to meet you, Lil\u2019 Fatty. Are you happy here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lil\u2019 Fatty scratched his nose and said, \u201cI\u2019m happy. I\u2019m exceptionally happy.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, Zhu Wei Wei\u2019s gaze shifted to the side, to Xiang Xiang, who was sitting in the wheelchair. A hint of sorrow appeared in between her brows. \u201cNice to meet you, Little Sister.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiang Xiang was a little shy. \u201cNice to meet you, Big Sister.\u201d</p><br/><p>After Lil\u2019 Fatty and Xiang Xiang left, Zhu Wei Wei was a little emotional. \u201cDirector Huang, this Xiang Xiang is very cute but\u2026</p><br/><p>The short-haired little sister nodded, \u201cAt such a young age, her leg is\u2026sigh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Wei Wei had done her research on the situation at Nanshan Children\u2019s Welfare Institute before coming. The children had basically all been rescued from the clutches of the human traffickers. How good could the children\u2019s days have been when they were with the human traffickers?</p><br/><p>Director Huang said, \u201cThis is already considered good. We have a total of 365 children here but only 160 of them have complete and perfectly healthy bodies. The rest all have disabilities in their bodies.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo many?\u201d Zhu Wei Wei couldn\u2019t believe it. The government was actually very caring towards these disabled children. When they grew up, the government would arrange welfare jobs for them. However, their lives were still much different from those of average people.</p><br/><p>Director Huang shook her head, \u201cBut after Master Lin\u2019s medical treatment, only 35 children remain uncured in the end. The others have all been cured.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Wei Wei was extremely surprised. \u201cDirector Huang. This Master Lin treated those disabled children back to health? But why are there 35 children left who can\u2019t be treated?\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Huang replied, \u201cYou saw it yourself. These children are all missing limbs and they really can\u2019t be treated. For our Welfare Institute to reach its current state is all thanks to Master Lin\u2019s contributions.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s amazing,\u201d said Yang Mu in shock. What Director Huang was talking about sounded like a fantasy. It was hard to believe that.</p><br/><p>Zhu Wei Wei wasn\u2019t Shanghainese. She wasn\u2019t familiar with this Master Lin. She asked curiously, \u201cDirector Huang, just who is this Master Lin? He seems so amazing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Initially, she had thought that this Master Lin was perhaps a volunteer like her but now, that didn\u2019t seem like the case.</p><br/><p>Raising funds, for someone with ability, was not a difficult thing. But treating these disabled children back to health was a little unthinkable.</p><br/><p>Director Huang smiled, \u201cI\u2019ve already informed Master Lin that there are volunteers coming. He\u2019ll be coming over later. Then, you\u2019ll be able to talk to him.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, series of joyful voices came from outside.</p><br/><p>\u201cUncle Lin\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUncle Lin, hurry and come watch me draw.\u201d</p><br/><p>The cheery laughter of the children rang from outside.</p><br/><p>Director Huang smiled, \u201cHe\u2019s here. Over here, he\u2019s very well-liked by the children.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Outside.</p><br/><p>A group of children had surrounded Lin Fan. Meanwhile, Lin Fan was all smiles. He then asked Han Lu, \u201cWhere are the volunteers?\u201d</p><br/><p>Han Lu had already stayed here for very long and he really liked this place. Especially when he woke up and the first thing he saw were these children, his heart would burst with excitement.</p><br/><p>He had found his life\u2019s goal.</p><br/><p>\u201cDirector Huang is bringing them around inside,\u201d said Han Lu.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Lin Fan nodded, then looked at the children and asked, \u201cHow have your Chinese arts been? Have you all been lazy?\u201d</p><br/><p>The children replied in unison, \u201cWe haven\u2019t been lazy, Uncle Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. These children had indeed not been lazy. His Encyclopedic Points increased every day and a good number of them came from these children.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, you\u2019re here.\u201d At that moment, Director Huang came over with everyone else.</p><br/><p>Among the crowd, Zhu Wei Wei was curiously looking at Lin Fan. He was very young but he looked very reliable. When he faced the children, in particular, he had a very warm and gentle smile.</p><br/><p>But what made Zhu Wei Wei most curious was what kind of person this Master Lin was exactly? Why did he have such capability?</p><br/><p>The short-haired lady held onto Zhu Wei Wei\u2019s arm. Her mouth opened slightly as she asked in a surprised tone, \u201cWei Wei, is that Master Lin? But he looks so young, is he really that amazing?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Wei Wei had no idea. This was the first time she had seen Master Lin. She believed everything Director Huang had said but she had never seen it personally, so naturally, she was a little doubtful.</p><br/><p>Yang Mu looked at Lin Fan. Such a young man but so well-received. When a man meets another man, it is only natural for them to compare each other. In his heart, he muttered to himself, \u201cThis guy doesn\u2019t seem like much.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled, \u201cDirector Huang, are these the volunteers?\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Huang said, \u201cLet me do an introduction. This is volunteer Zhu Wei Wei.\u201d</p><br/><p>The short-haired lady went forward immediately, extended her hand and said with a smile, \u201cNice to meet you. I\u2019m Li Qian, this is my first time volunteering.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled and shook her hand. Then, he said, \u201cWelcome, everyone. I\u2019m the person-in-charge here, Lin Fan. Nanshan Children\u2019s Welfare Institute welcomes all of you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was very welcoming towards volunteers. Of course, that was on the condition that they were real volunteers and not people who just came here to pretend like they really cared.</p><br/><p>However, when he first saw Zhu Wei Wei, he could already tell that this lady was a very kind person.</p><br/><p>As for the others, they were perhaps there just to experience it once. However, that didn\u2019t matter. As long as there was one sincere person, it was enough.</p></div>\n</div>"}

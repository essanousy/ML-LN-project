And it felt as if it couldn\u2019t be resolved.</p><br/><p>Most news would fade away in one or two days at most. However, this news didn\u2019t seem like it was going to fade away. This made him wonder how his brother would be able to press on.</p><br/><p>Some celebrities chose not to get involved. They didn\u2019t know which side to stand on, so they maintained their silence.</p><br/><p>They were all public figures and they definitely had to watch their image.</p><br/><p>If they were to stand on Master Lin\u2019s side, they would be clinging on to someone reliable but no one could be sure of whether or not Master Lin would be able to develop it. If he didn\u2019t manage to develop it, they would be miserable. They might just get slapped repeatedly in the face.</p><br/><p>Hence, they decided to maintain neutrality.</p><br/><p>Cloud Street!</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang asked curiously, \u201cBrother Lin, is that thing going to be done?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled and replied, \u201cAlmost. I\u2019m just waiting for Wang Ming Yang to finish preparing the research lab. Once that\u2019s done, everything will be resolved.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Lin, tell us the truth. How confident are you regarding this matter?\u201d Zhao Zhong Yang was already confused. He didn\u2019t know whether to believe Brother Lin or not. Although Brother Lin was truly f*cking awesome, he was stepping into another field this time.</p><br/><p>Who would be able to cross industries like that?</p><br/><p>Fortune-telling, scallion pancakes, medicine, Chinese arts, martial arts, goalkeeping, and now, he was going to develop artificial limbs. This was simply hard to accept!</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, confidence? Forget about it, we shan\u2019t talk about that. Just wait and see. I guarantee that you\u2019ll see something special.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan had a lot of confidence in himself. He believed that there definitely wouldn\u2019t be a problem. All he had to do was wait for Wang Ming Yang to prepare the research lab.</p><br/><p>Another few days later.</p><br/><p>The situation on the Internet had gradually stabilized.</p><br/><p>Those specialists had stopped scolding him as well, because this Master Lin hadn\u2019t appeared at all. It was as if he had vanished without a trace.</p><br/><p>On some web forums, there was an intense discussion.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis time, Master Lin has been slapped in the face. He\u2019s not even appearing on Weibo anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSigh. Although the Internet allows for free speech, he\u2019s a famous person. Every word and every action from him will be seen by the masses. Now, he has been caught saying something ridiculous. He can be considered unlucky this time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. Although Master Lin is f*cking awesome, he\u2019s still too young. Young people are proud and arrogant and they love to boast. That\u2019s completely normal. I just hope that he\u2019ll be more careful next time and not be so arrogant.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, he must have thought that he was a genius of all fields. Developing artificial limbs? Even if I give him a whole year, he won\u2019t be able to develop sh*t!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck! Take a look at Master Lin\u2019s Weibo. He actually posted something!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe posted something? What did he post now? Is he posting some arrogant words to draw attention again? This Master Lin is always using all kinds of tricks these days.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not it. Go and see for yourself.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan: \u201cThe research lab has finally been prepared. Right now, I\u2019m on the way to the research lab. I think that the artificial limbs will be developed before long. Everyone, please look forward to it. Oh right, here\u2019s a reminder to the various artificial limb companies. Sell your stocks quickly. Your artificial limbs are sold for tens of thousands, they\u2019re too expensive. Mine will only be sold for a few thousand dollars at most.\u201d</p><br/><p>When this post was uploaded, the netizens\u2019 jaws dropped. It was as if they had seen a ghost.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn! Master Lin is playing with his life!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHehehehe!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have a bad feeling that Master Lin is going to get flamed again.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cResearch lab? That\u2019s f*cking high-end.\u201d</p><br/><p>The artificial limb specialists who had quietened down were completely stunned upon seeing this post. To them, this youngster had lost his mind. This youngster was insistent on bringing up infuriating topics every once in a while.</p><br/><p>\u201cForget it, forget it. I won\u2019t say anything. This is pure sensationalism. It\u2019s simply a waste of time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Some artificial limb specialists didn\u2019t want to discuss further about this.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, the bosses of some artificial limb companies saw this. They replied with a few question marks and some emojis.</p><br/><p>It was as if they were saying, \u2018Sell our stocks? You must be joking!\u2019</p><br/><p>Lin Fan drove his car toward Wang Ming Yang\u2019s location.</p><br/><p>The research lab was on the top floor of the Eastern Han Organization. Wang Ming Yang had cleared the entire floor just for his brother\u2019s research purposes.</p><br/><p>Downstairs.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang was waiting there. His secretary was standing beside him.</p><br/><p>The secretary was bewildered as well. She had no idea what Master Lin was trying to do. Regarding this matter, she didn\u2019t have much faith.</p><br/><p>But it was Master Lin after all. And her Chief Wang had immense trust in Master Lin. As an employee, all she could do was heed instructions.</p><br/><p>\u201cMing Yang, is it really done?\u201d Lin Fan parked his car at the side and came out with a face full of smiles.</p><br/><p>He hadn\u2019t expected himself to get involved in high-tech stuff. He was quite excited.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s done. This time, because of you, I\u2019ve spent quite a lot of money.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan patted Wang Ming Yang\u2019s shoulder. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. You\u2019ll earn back all that you\u2019ve spent.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEarning it back is not important. As long as you\u2019re happy, it\u2019s fine.\u201d Wang Ming Yang smiled. He had already earned so much money that he wouldn\u2019t be able to spend it all in his lifetime. Since his brother wanted to play, Wang Ming Yang decided to play along.</p><br/><p>As for earning money, it was just a bonus.</p><br/><p>He had thought about it. His brother wanted to do this thing but definitely wasn\u2019t going to take money for himself. His brother was thinking about him and wanted to help him earn some money.</p><br/><p>But now, it didn\u2019t matter to Wang Ming Yang. No matter how much or how little he earned, he could accept it. Even if he didn\u2019t earn at all, he would accept it. He was just accompanying his brother in doing good deeds.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go upstairs to take a look. We\u2019ll see if you\u2019re satisfied. The materials have all been bought according to what you wanted,\u201d said Wang Ming Yang.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan followed Wang Ming Yang up the main building.</p><br/><p>When they reached the top floor, the big doors were exactly like those research lab doors from sci-fi movies. It felt very high-tech.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow is it? I saw this in a movie before and I thought it was pretty good, so I made one,\u201d said Wang Ming Yang with a grin.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled back. \u201cAwesome. If people didn\u2019t know better, they would be wondering what on Earth we\u2019re researching in there.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go in and take a look.\u201d Wang Ming Yang entered the passcode and the door opened up.</p><br/><p>The interior was very nice. It was very high-tech and modern. It was all white and it felt good to look at it.</p><br/><p>\u201cThese machines and equipment are really hard to buy. I had to use numerous connections to get them. The regulations on them are rather strict,\u201d said Wang Ming Yang.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the surroundings and nodded contently.</p><br/><p>And when he saw these things, the knowledge in his mind started to spring to life. It was as if it had been waiting for this moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, time to start working. You may leave,\u201d said Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh? You\u2019re starting right now?\u201d Wang Ming Yang was taken aback. He couldn\u2019t believe it.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. \u201cOf course. Otherwise, when would I start? Go on then. Just wait for the good news from me.\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

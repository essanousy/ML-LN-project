It was as if she had managed to unload a huge rock weighing on her heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe succeeded! That\u2019s great. I knew Brother Lin could do it!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang started a livestream in the morning, and his fans quickly tuned in.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Yang, Master Lin succeeded! I just read Weibo.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI usually wake up at around 12pm; however, I felt something great was going to happen today, so I woke up earlier to check my phone. Indeed, it has happened!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGoing to send some gifts to Master Lin since I\u2019m so happy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Yang, don\u2019t be envious. I\u2019m sending it to Brother Lin, and it has nothing to do with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>At the same time, a stream of presents were sent via the livestream.</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang laughed, \u201cDo you really think I\u2019m that type of person? Anyways, it\u2019s a joyous occasion and I gotta make a trip to the Chinese Medical Academy.\u201d</p><br/><p>As he was broadcasting, he was screaming, \u201cLet\u2019s go to the academy to see Brother Lin!\u201d</p><br/><p>When he said that, the netizens became impatient.</p><br/><p>\u201cSure, let\u2019s go now!\u201d Fraud Tian said.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan added, \u201cDad, can you please look after the shop? We\u2019re going to get Master Lin here.\u201d</p><br/><p>The other shop owners were waiting outside.</p><br/><p>\u201cFraud and Young Zhao, quick, let\u2019s go now!\u201d</p><br/><p>The shop owners were ecstatic. This was what they had been waiting for. They wanted to quickly get to the Chinese Medical Academy to fetch Little Boss.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, the large group of people left for the medical academy.</p><br/><p>In a certain villa.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang woke up and felt that something had happened.</p><br/><p>Xu Zi Le woke up groggily and asked, \u201cMing Yang, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang did not say anything. He just took out his phone and checked Weibo as he felt that something had happened.</p><br/><p>When he looked at Weibo, he gasped and hugged Xu Zi Le.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, he succeeded!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Xu Zi Le was still feeling groggy. She did not know what Ming Yang was talking about. However, she suddenly thought of it.</p><br/><p>\u201cMing Yang, you mean Brother Lin\u2026 succeeded?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang nodded. \u201cYeah, I knew it! He made me so worried. Alright, let\u2019s go back to sleep.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, he went back to bed and prepared to go back to sleep.</p><br/><p>Xu Zi Le replied, \u201cMing Yang, don\u2019t you want to go and have a look?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang waved his hand. \u201cWhat\u2019s there to look at? He succeeded and nothing went wrong. There\u2019s no need to go there.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, but this brother of mine is indeed impressive.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang finally felt relieved after hearing that Lin Fan had succeeded. He had been having sleepless nights, and he could finally sleep without feeling worried.</p><br/><p>At the Chinese Medical Academy.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was being surrounded by reporters, and a lot of townsfolk had gathered outside. Gradually, they blocked the entrance and it was a mess.</p><br/><p>The students in the academy started to discuss about it.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, Master Lin and Director Zhao really succeeded!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe it. If not for the trust I have in Master Lin, I would have thought that Master Lin was trolling.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow could that be? Master Lin just resolved an impossible task. I am really impressed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen will I be as good as Master Lin?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s impossible for us to reach his level in this lifetime.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI am not as greedy as you. I just want to be half as good as Director Zhao.\u201d</p><br/><p>The students were proud of them. After all, Zhao Ming Qing was their director and Master Lin was the Ming Qing\u2019s mentor. They felt that they were blessed to be able to be part of a miraculous academy like this.</p><br/><p>The townsfolk outside were wondering what happened. However, they were dumbfounded when they found out what had happened from the people there.</p><br/><p>Some of them were ecstatic while others were stunned.</p><br/><p>Some of the townsfolk were not confident that they were going to succeed. They felt that it was simply impossible because of their \u2018limited capabilities\u2019.</p><br/><p>Although Master Lin was powerful, AIDS was a terminal illness, and the virus was not easy to eradicate at all.</p><br/><p>However, they were shocked that Master Lin actually did it.</p><br/><p>A reporter asked, \u201cMaster Lin, what do you feel like doing now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Master Lin chuckled, \u201cWhat else? I just want to go back home to sleep.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha,\u201d the reporters chuckled, and they finally could relax their stressed minds.</p><br/><p>They were elated to see the success of Master Lin. It was something that they could not describe with words.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing stood beside his mentor and looked at him in awe. He did not help much during their research. His mentor did most, if not all of the work.</p><br/><p>It was a testament to his belief that his mentor was the most powerful being ever for actually eradicating an impossible disease like this.</p><br/><p>He was extremely proud of him.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing was really happy to be able to participate in research like this too.</p><br/><p>It was a feeling that he could not describe with words.</p><br/><p>The reporters finished up their interviews as they wanted Master Lin to rest.</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone, please excuse us. Let Master Lin go back home to sleep. He must be exhausted.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, no one else would have been able to withstand such a difficult task. Furthermore, he couldn\u2019t afford to make any mistakes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat Master Lin said earlier was unbelievable. He said he was able to cure AIDS without coming up with the medication for it. I feel that if we were to report it, everyone in the world would be shocked.\u201d</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Fraud Tian and the others arrived.</p><br/><p>The shop owners were stunned when they saw the huge crowd of people.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled when he saw them. He did not expect them to make a trip there at all.</p><br/><p>They were probably just there to join in the fun.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Why are there so many customers?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are so many of them queuing. This is a little scary.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, a group of people was inside the bath. They were all discussing and were very curious about Lin Fan\u2019s back-scrubbing techniques. They wanted to see if it was really as mystical as the forums had said.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy god, this is a little ridiculous.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, there\u2019s a certain part of that guy that doesn\u2019t seem quite right.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTo be able to get turned on just from scrubbing, how long must that guy have held it back?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLook at his expression. It\u2019s so exaggerated that it\u2019s scary.\u201d</p><br/><p>The surrounding customers who had come out of curiosity all squatted inside the bathing pool, whispering amongst themselves. When they saw that the person had gotten turned on by the scrubbing, they burst into laughter as they felt that it was unimaginable.</p><br/><p>But when their turns came, they found out just how perverse this back-scrubber\u2019s techniques were.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Lin Fan was busy working. A little bro went forward curiously, \u201cBig Bro, about that culprit, did you advise him to turn himself in?</p><br/><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t me. He came to see the truth himself,\u201d said Lin Fan with a smile. He now understood why these people were here. It was probably because of that incident that they wanted to come and take a look.</p><br/><p>The little bro was taken aback. \u201cWow, something like that could happen?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded with a smile, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with that happening.\u201d</p><br/><p>The other back-scrubbers said cheerfully, \u201cLittle Boss is very mystical. If you guys stay near Cloud Street, there\u2019s no way you wouldn\u2019t know Little Boss.\u201d</p><br/><p>The little bro shook his head, \u201cI don\u2019t stay here. I stay very far away. It\u2019s just that I saw the forums actively recommending this place, so I came to take a look.\u201d</p><br/><p>The other people in the bathing pool shouted, \u201cLittle Boss doesn\u2019t want to sell scallion pancakes, but comes here to do back-scrubbing instead. No matter what, we have to experience it.\u201d</p><br/><p>The other back-scrubbers all had to make a living as well. After going through Lin Fan\u2019s technical guidance, they had significantly improved and their techniques became much more comfortable. Compared to before, it was simply incomparable.</p><br/><p>The customers were enjoying it very much. In particular, the service was on point and the duration was not short either. Even if they couldn\u2019t experience Lin Fan\u2019s techniques personally, they were already satisfied.</p><br/><p>The price was cheap and it was very comfortable. This kind of back-scrubbing technique was nothing they had ever felt before.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Outside.</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian was done with the hearing, so he came to the bathhouse to look for Lin Fan. He hadn\u2019t met Master Lin in a while, mainly because he had quite a number of things to do recently. Shanghai was a big city and it had a high safety rating but there were still a number of crimes. There were no longer many murder cases nowadays but fights, conflicts and internet scams were still very common. At times, when he got busy, it wasn\u2019t easy for him.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs Master Lin inside?\u201d Liu Xiao Tian asked at the front desk.</p><br/><p>Xiao He was busy working here and there as she kept checking on the situation in the private rooms. At that moment, she replied without looking up, \u201cHe\u2019s here, he\u2019s here. All these people are looking for Master Lin. Queue up. Once, there\u2019s a room, I\u2019ll let you know immediately.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian took out his ID. \u201cI\u2019m a police officer. I\u2019m looking for Master Lin to ask about yesterday\u2019s incident.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao He was puzzled. \u201cYesterday? What happened yesterday?\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian was startled. Had this lady not seen the news? Everybody knew about yesterday\u2019s incident. As the bathhouse\u2019s staff, how could she not know? Then, Liu Xiao Tian shook his head helplessly, \u201cGo look for him. Tell him Liu Xiao Tian is here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao He saw that he really was a police officer and didn\u2019t say much else. However, she couldn\u2019t go into the men\u2019s bathhouse, so she told someone to go in and call him.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Lin Fan finished scrubbing, then informed the customers who were waiting, before going to the changing room and putting on his clothes. Then, he went to see Liu Xiao Tian.</p><br/><p>\u201cInspector Liu, why are you here?\u201d asked Lin Fan with a smile.</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian hadn\u2019t seen Lin Fan in a long time and had missed him a little. \u201cWhat? Can\u2019t I come and see you? I\u2019ve brought what you wanted.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan received the thing, then opened it and took a look. \u2018Good Citizen Award\u2019. Lin Fan was delighted. \u201cI really have to thank you, for you to personally come over here to deliver it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian shook his head, \u201cI can\u2019t figure out why you would want these. You already have so many Good Citizen Awards.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said with a smile, \u201cThese are good things. Each one of them represents a good deed that I\u2019ve done. But really, this case has just been cracked. Inspector Liu, you can\u2019t be here just to chat with me, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian glanced at Lin Fan, \u201cWhat? Just because I\u2019ve been busy for a period of time and I haven\u2019t been able to come look for you, you don\u2019t want to see me anymore, Master Lin? When we have the time, let\u2019s go for one or two cups of beer.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shook his head, \u201cI can\u2019t do that right now. I\u2019m still scrubbing people\u2019s backs. Next time, I\u2019ll call you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian gave in to Lin Fan. Why would he come and give people back scrubs all of a sudden? But after some thinking, Liu Xiao Tian decided not to say anything. He just couldn\u2019t figure out this Master Lin\u2019s personality. Moreover, the reason that he was able to be in his position, he believed, had very much to do with Master Lin.</p><br/><p>At a distant location.</p><br/><p>A car stopped.</p><br/><p>Elder Zeng had been hesitant and restless the whole way. He still hadn\u2019t made a firm decision. He was a pessimist. He kept thinking about what would happen if the police found out or if somebody reported him.</p><br/><p>Would he be sent to jail?</p><br/><p>Would his shop be closed?</p><br/><p>At that point, he was a little afraid. However, he thought that if his business didn\u2019t change for the better, it would eventually have to close as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is the place, right Boss Zeng?\u201d said the skinny man with a smile.</p><br/><p>Zeng Wei nodded, \u201cMmm, we\u2019ve reached.\u201d</p><br/><p>The skinny man looked up at the shop and shook his head, \u201cThe name is already not very good. The entrance doesn\u2019t seem luxurious enough and it gives a first impression that this isn\u2019t a place with good service. That\u2019s why it\u2019s hard to attract people.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zeng Wei was a little taken aback, \u201cThere\u2019s even an issue with the name?\u201d</p><br/><p>The skinny man said with a smile, \u201cOf course. You have to add the word \u2018Sauna\u2019 or \u2018Club\u2019. As for this \u2018Elder Zeng\u2019s Bath Centre\u2019, I feel that it\u2019s no good. But it doesn\u2019t matter now. It would be expensive to change it now. With my great source of customers, I just have to give them a notice and it\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>The skinny man realized that Zeng Wei was still a little hesitant, so he said with a smile, \u201cBoss Zeng, you don\u2019t have to feel any burden. Although the government doesn\u2019t approve of such a thing, this isn\u2019t an unvirtuous thing. Think about it, it\u2019s mutual consent, isn\u2019t it? I see so many bathhouses in Shanghai now that can\u2019t even survive. There are so few bathhouses like yours that follow the regulations. Moreover, just a few months and you\u2019ll be able to earn a large sum. If you ever don\u2019t feel like doing it anymore, you can stop anytime. Actually, doing this line of work is a good thing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zeng Wei looked at this man. This was the first time he had heard someone say that this line of work was a good thing.</p><br/><p>The skinny man said, \u201cHave you seen that news before? A migrant worker who knew nothing tried to rape a passer-by because he had restrained himself for too long and he didn\u2019t know about prostitutes. In the end, he accidentally killed the person. It was only when he was arrested that he found out about prostitutes and was filled with regret. If he had known earlier, he would have been able to resolve it with just a hundred dollars. There was no need to take someone\u2019s life. Do you think that we really don\u2019t contribute to society at all?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zeng Wei shook his head after hearing this and didn\u2019t say much else. These were evil and crooked doctrines but he had nothing to say in rebuttal.</p><br/><p>Since his business was doing so badly, he could only rely on this.</p><br/><p>He could only let the man keep talking while he bet his all on this.</p></div>\n</div>"}

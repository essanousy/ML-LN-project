It was something that had happened at three-something in the morning. The scent would have dispersed a long time ago. How could any dog on this Earth have such abilities?</p><br/><p>Lin Fan trusted this doggy\u2019s abilities. After all, he wasn\u2019t a normal dog. He was a demon dog. How could this even be a problem for him?</p><br/><p>\u201cDoggy, find the scent of the people who were at our shop at 3:40 last night,\u201d Lin Fan said to the doggy.</p><br/><p>To outsiders, this was simply like playing the piano to a cow. But the people of Cloud Streets knew that Master Lin could communicate with animals.</p><br/><p>Elder Dog looked at Lin Fan, then at the manure-covered shop. At that moment, a look of helplessness appeared on his dog face.</p><br/><p><em>I really don\u2019t want to sniff it. It\u2019s too smelly!</em></p><br/><p><em>I\u2019m just a dog who likes to do righteous things, not a dog who likes to smell sh*t.</em></p><br/><p>But he had no choice. With people depending on him, he had to do it. Moreover, his puppies and his dog wife were with these people as well. He had to work.</p><br/><p>Then, Elder Dog came to the shop\u2019s entrance. He didn\u2019t dare to go too close and he started sniffing.</p><br/><p>But with one sniff, that pungent smell rushed in. It almost made him tear.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded confidently. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I trust that my doggy will definitely be able to smell them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sister Hong was curious. \u201cIf he can smell them, Elder Dog would really be amazing.\u201d</p><br/><p>The poodle, Flowers, was at her owner, Sister Hong\u2019s side. When she saw her dog husband sniffing a pile of sh*t, she let out a look of distaste.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, those puppies could already run now. They were standing there and sniffing as well. However, they couldn\u2019t sniff anything out. Then, they rolled around on the ground and played.</p><br/><p>\u201cWoof woof,\u201d Elder Dog barked at Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan naturally knew what Elder Dog was saying. He let out a smile. \u201cYou\u2019ve found it. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, he said to Fraud Tian, \u201cFraud, you\u2019ll stay here and clean up the shop.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian was still in an angry state. \u201cI can\u2019t stay. I have to teach those guys a lesson. Let me use my Ba Gua Zhang to teach them a proper lesson.\u201d Then, he turned to Zhao Zhong Yang. \u201cYou\u2019ll stay and clean up.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang had a stupefied look on his face. Just as he wanted to say something, he realized that Fraud had already entered the car. He didn\u2019t even have a chance to refute.</p><br/><p>Then, he looked at the state of the shop\u2019s door. At that moment, he was lost for words.</p><br/><p>In the car.</p><br/><p>Elder Dog was sitting in front as he kept sniffing the air. Then, he would turn to Lin Fan and bark. Lin Fan would then drive in the direction of Elder Dog\u2019s instruction.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>In a certain shabby house in a shantytown.</p><br/><p>A group of people was looking at their phones and roaring with laughter without the slightest scruple.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, I\u2019m dying of laughter. This Lin is really too meddlesome. Today, we splashed sh*t on his shop. In a few days, we\u2019ll splash paint,\u201d a bald man said as he laughed madly.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Guang, what\u2019s so good about paint? We\u2019ll still splash sh*t on his shop in a few days,\u201d said another little brother.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck, Lil\u2019 Three and the rest have been captured. I heard they\u2019ve been sentenced to a number of years. How can we rescue them?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow could we possibly rescue them? It\u2019s not so easy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m really pis*ed off. We have always minded our own business. He runs a shop but he came to meddle with us. If it wasn\u2019t for the fact that I can\u2019t take him on, I would beat him to death.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t say. There are even people on the Internet speaking in support of us. They\u2019re saying that this Lin is way too meddlesome. They\u2019re saying that this revenge was good.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThose are the people who know their stuff. Look at all those meddlesome people. How many of them end up well?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, the room door was opened. Two young men dragged a small boy in. Then, they hit the back of the boy\u2019s head and the boy fell to the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Gaung, this little b*stard was talking to a stranger, saying that he couldn\u2019t find his parents,\u201d said the two young men furiously as they glared at the boy as if they wanted to swallow him whole.</p><br/><p>That boy trembled in fear as he squatted by the wall, hugging his head with both hands. He didn\u2019t dare to speak, nor did he dare to cry, because he knew that if he were to cry, he would be beaten cruelly.</p><br/><p>When Brother Guang heard that, he immediately walked over and grabbed the boy\u2019s hair. He lifted the boy\u2019s head and threw a slap across his face.</p><br/><p>\u201cTalk. Why don\u2019t you talk to strangers more?\u201d</p><br/><p>That slap had been very heavy. Soon, the boy\u2019s face was completely red and there was even internal bleeding.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you still dare to talk next time, I\u2019ll make you mute. Then we\u2019ll see if you\u2019ll still talk,\u201d Brother Guang growled.</p><br/><p>Those few people at the side kept on laughing. \u201cBrother Guang, I think that we should just make him mute now. If he really causes a problem next time, we might get ruined by this kid.\u201d</p><br/><p>Brother Guang pondered for a moment before nodding. \u201cThat makes sense. We can\u2019t let him go. Let\u2019s make him mute.\u201d</p><br/><p>When the boy heard that, he instantly started crying in fear. \u201cDon\u2019t make me mute. I won\u2019t dare to do that next time.\u201d</p><br/><p>*Smack!*</p><br/><p>Brother Guang immediately slapped him. \u201cNext time? There is no next time. Little b*stard, you were asking for death. Did you think people nowadays would help you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, he looked at the two young men. \u201cHow was the situation resolved in the end?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat person was given a scare by me and he scurried away. We were worried so we walked around a few rounds before coming back. People these days think that they are so righteous but they\u2019re actually gutless. Once they are given a scare, they wouldn\u2019t dare to meddle with other people\u2019s business anymore,\u201d said one of the men.</p><br/><p>Brother Guang said, \u201cHow much money do we have?\u201d</p><br/><p>That man took out the money. \u201cThirty-something.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Brother Guang heard that, he slapped the boy once more. \u201cYou piece of trash. Thirty-something?! How did you beg? You didn\u2019t put in any effort, did you? I\u2019ve wasted my time raising you. You won\u2019t get any food today. If you don\u2019t get any money in the afternoon, you won\u2019t get any food ever again.\u201d</p><br/><p>*Bam!*</p><br/><p>Suddenly.</p><br/><p>The room door was kicked open.</p><br/><p>The first person to enter was not Lin Fan, but Fraud Tian. when he entered, he bellowed in anger. \u201cYou guys dared to dirty the door. I\u2019ll beat you to death.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian was not to be underestimated. This old man really knew real kungfu. With one blow, he sent the young man flying.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, that Brother Guang saw this scene and was shocked. He wanted to escape but Elder Dog charged forward and ferociously bit onto Brother Guang\u2019s trousers.</p><br/><p>A blood-curdling scream rang out.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan entered the room and saw the situation. His heart was fiery but a voice started speaking in his head. <em>Stay calm, stay calm. Don\u2019t be violent. Let the doggy be violent. The doggy is more ferocious than you.</em></p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian rushed in with his men and hurriedly took over those people who had already been taken down.</p><br/><p>That Brother Guang had been bitten on his leg by Elder Dog. That area was already stained with blood. It even felt as if his flesh had been bitten off. He kept on screaming miserably.</p><br/><p>The other people in the house had also suffered from Elder Dog\u2019s bites.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan stood there and blinked. He looked at the situation in front of him with no reaction at all.</p><br/><p><em>They were really beautifully bitten.</em></p></div>\n</div>"}

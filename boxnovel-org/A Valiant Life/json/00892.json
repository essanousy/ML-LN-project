This time, it had finally been resolved perfectly. He swore to God that he would be careful from now on and would never show off again.</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t even stand himself for showing off.</p><br/><p>Although he had suffered a little, the satisfaction he received when he managed to develop the prescription was bursting out.</p><br/><p>His ten fingers moved at an amazing speed as he typed word after word.</p><br/><p>\u2018The ultimate prescription for leukemia.</p><br/><p>Category: Chinese medicine.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-2\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Medication for the first course of treatment. Medication for the second course of treatment. Medication for the third course of treatment\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>Every step was typed very seriously. He was afraid that he would make an error due to how nervous he was. If that were really to happen, it would be tragic.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Outside.</p><br/><p>When Zhao Ming Qing came out, the reporters, pharmaceutical managers, and Director of the Health Department who were waiting outside started a commotion.</p><br/><p>When the students in the school saw the Academy Director, they stopped in their tracks as well. They had no idea how things were going exactly and seeing the Academy Director in such a messy state, it was hard to imagine. Just what had the Director and Master Lin gone through during this period of time? Or rather, how much pressure had they endured?</p><br/><p>Although the students hadn\u2019t seen it personally, they knew that this matter must\u2019ve caused great stress for Master Lin and the Director. After all, there were countless people depending on it.</p><br/><p>When Zhao Ming Qing saw that so many people had gathered at the school entrance, he couldn\u2019t help but sigh. He knew that these people were all here for the leukemia prescription.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-3\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cDirector Zhao, Director Zhao\u2026\u201d The people at the entrance were yelling loudly. They all wanted to know how the situation was exactly.</p><br/><p>\u201cZhao Ming Qing, come here\u2026\u201d The Director of the Health Department addressed him directly by his name. In terms of ranking, he was much higher than Zhao Ming Qing.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing was a little fatigued and he just wanted to go back for a rest. In the process of developing the prescription, he hadn\u2019t felt tired at all and he had been full of energy throughout. But once the prescription had been developed, it was as if that burden in his heart had finally fallen out, and what replaced it was an unimaginable fatigue.</p><br/><p>He came to the school entrance.</p><br/><p>The reporters asked anxiously, \u201cDirector Zhao, has the medicine been developed successfully?\u201d</p><br/><p>This was what everyone wanted to know. At that moment, the entire place went quiet. Not a single person spoke. The camera flashes kept on flashing as everyone wanted to record this moment.</p><br/><p>At this moment, everyone was nervous beyond words. If the medicine hadn\u2019t been successfully developed, the amount of disappointment would be great.</p><br/><p>But if it had been successfully developed, it would be fantastic.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing nodded. As he answered the reporter\u2019s question, he tried his best to appear a little more energetic, \u201cIt has been developed successfully\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>When these words came out from his mouth, a deafening silence filled the place.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-4\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>The silence was even a little scary.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, a rumbling noise came.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn. Did I hear that wrong? It has really been successfully developed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, leukemia has been overcome. It has really been overcome.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis hasn\u2019t even been through clinical testing, how can we be sure that leukemia has been overcome?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you stupid? Do you think Master Lin and Director Zhao would make such a joke?\u201d</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, when the students who were spectating from the side heard this, they couldn\u2019t wait to take out their phones. They immediately started sending updates to their circles of friends.</p><br/><p>Although leukemia wasn\u2019t something that everyone suffered from, it was still a major disease. The number of people who contracted the disease every year was not small.</p><br/><p>To people who studied medicine, for a major disease to have been overcome, it was a huge deal. This meant that, in the future, even if people contracted the disease, they didn\u2019t have to fear.</p><br/><p>The managers of the pharmaceutical companies had initially wanted to ask about the cost of collaboration but because the Director of the Health Department was there, these thoughts had been stopped.</p><br/><p><em>Could it be that there really is no way?</em></p><br/><p>Director Chen immediately opened his mouth and asked, \u201cZhao Ming Qing, where\u2019s the medicine?\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-5\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>When he heard that the medicine had already been successfully developed, he felt as if he was about to float into the sky. He couldn\u2019t wait to get hold of the medicine.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing furrowed his brows. <em>Who\u2019s this person who\u2019s calling me by my full name? I don\u2019t think I know him.</em></p><br/><p>\u201cYou are?\u201d Zhao Ming Qing asked suspiciously.</p><br/><p>The surrounding reporters and the managers of the pharmaceutical companies instantly covered their mouths as they couldn\u2019t help but laugh. They already disliked Director Chen. <em>Director Zhao was involved in the development of the prescription </em>for <em>leukemia. What rights do you have to just call him by his name?</em></p><br/><p>Director Chen was not bothered by all this. He just wanted to know where the medicine was. \u201cI\u2019m Director Chen from the Health Department. I\u2019m here on behalf of my department to discuss this medicine with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, Director Chen.\u201d Zhao Ming Qing seemed to understand now. \u201cThe medicine isn\u2019t with me. It\u2019s with my teacher.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen where is Master Lin?\u201d Director Chen\u2019s heart shifted a little. <em>This Master Lin can\u2019t have run away with the medicine, right?</em></p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s inside. He\u2019s busy with something and he\u2019ll be out soon.\u201d Zhao Ming Qing\u2019s heart was beating quickly too. He wondered how these people would react if he told them that his teacher was publicizing the medicine on the Internet.</p><br/><p>To others, this medicine had unlimited value but to his teacher, the value of this medicine was just in treating leukemia sufferers back to health.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing approved of his teacher\u2019s behavior greatly. Brewing Chinese medicine was not a difficult task. Practically everyone could do it. If someone were to contract the disease, all he or she would have to do was buy the medicine and brew it at home.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-6\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>If they gave the medicine directly to the Health Department for factory manufacturing, it would go through many layers of processing before reaching the final product. In the end, who knew how inflated the price of the final product would be?</p><br/><p>But his teacher\u2019s actions would definitely offend people. However, his teacher was not afraid. Why would he be afraid?</p><br/><p>If someone really attacked him out of anger, that would be exactly what he wanted. Studying Chinese medicine peacefully was not a bad choice.</p><br/><p>Director Chen hurriedly shouted at the security, \u201cHurry up and open the door. Let me in.\u201d</p><br/><p>The security guards looked at Zhao Ming Qing as if they were asking for his opinion.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing waved his hand. \u201cEveryone, please wait here for a while. Teacher has important things to do inside.\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Chen said hurriedly, \u201cZhao Ming Qing, only I need to go in. I\u2019ll be the only one.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing shook his head. \u201cThat won\u2019t do. No one is allowed to enter. Teacher will be out soon. Please wait outside.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Director Chen was a little angry now. <em>This Zhao </em>Ming Qing <em>is outrageous. I\u2019m the Director of the Health Department, how dare he not let me enter?</em></p><br/><p><em>But forget it. The medicine is important. I\u2019ll just wait here </em>.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-7\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>At that moment.</p><br/><p>Gasps of shock came from the crowd.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin has come out\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone hurriedly looked over. Master Lin Lin was in the distance, walking towards them.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was delighted. He had used his linguistic ability to its fullest and presented the prescription to the public beautifully.</p><br/><p>He wondered what everyone\u2019s response would be when they saw it.</p><br/><p>However, all these people gathered at the entrance seemed to be here to ask about the prescription.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved at the crowd. \u201cBe patient. I\u2019m coming\u2026\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

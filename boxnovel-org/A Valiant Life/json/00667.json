These two fellas are so arrogant. They don\u2019t even have any respect for Chinese Arts.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis Jin Cheng Guo is too shameless. He literally learned Chinese Arts. I didn\u2019t expect him to disrespect his own ancestors.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is a common sight. The Koreans keep claiming that Chinese Arts belongs to them. Previously, a Chinese Artist from Korea kept insisting that it belonged to the Chinese and he was shut out by the others. What\u2019s the point of speaking the truth these days? People suffer horrific fates.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThree years ago, Chinese Arts didn\u2019t do well at all in the International Arts Exhibition. The Japanese and Korean netizens laughed. If they don\u2019t get a good placing this time, it\u2019d be shameful.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are they doing in the International Arts Exhibitions? Do we really not have someone that can match up to their standards?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you talking rubbish? Previously, the Chinese Arts Association organized a competition for kids and they cheated in the results. What do you think of our Chinese Arts Association? This time, it\u2019s going to be the same outcome. We\u2019ll be in the last place again.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe \u2018Chinese Artists\u2019 these days don\u2019t even have real talent. They\u2019re just cheaters. They sell artworks for more than a few million dollars. Who would be so stupid to buy them? But then again, people really bought them. Then, the Chinese Artists that managed to sell their artworks suddenly became renown artists. Their lives were changed forever.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>At the Chinese Arts Association.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Zheng, people are looking down on us. We have to get a good placing this time. If not, we\u2019d be a joke.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, although we\u2019ve never done well, we can\u2019t do anything about it. We can\u2019t really say anything to rebut them. Now, everyone looks down on us.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPresident, whose works are we going to send? According to the trend, the standard of the International Arts Exhibition improves every year. If we do not submit work of higher quality, we\u2019d be in danger.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone gathered in the conference room and discussed about this matter.</p><br/><p>They were the core of the association\u2019s management. They possessed true talent and they weren\u2019t just artists that produced insignificant results.</p><br/><p>Although they were good, they could only do that much about it.</p><br/><p>Zheng Zhong Shan said calmly, \u201cAlright, we only have to send thirty artworks for this International Arts Exhibition. Let me split up the work.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Yun, you will submit your best artwork. Just one will do.\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Yun was a bespectacled elderly man. He stood up, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I would give my best one even if I have to lose my life.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zheng Zhong Shan smiled, \u201cIt\u2019s not that serious. Just do your best.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, he continued to appoint seventeen members. When the others thought that he was going to announce more people, Zheng Zhong Shan sat down. That indicated that it was over.</p><br/><p>\u201cPresident, it\u2019s only been seventeen artworks. According to the rules, there should be thirteen more.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zheng Zhong Shan pointed, \u201cMe, Elder Yue and Elder Tao, will be submitting one each.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s only twenty artworks.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zheng Zhong Shan looked at them and shook his head, \u201cI don\u2019t know what to say. Did you guys forget about Elder Lin?\u201d</p><br/><p>When he said Elder Lin, everyone was stunned.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, right. How could I possibly forget Elder Lin? If Elder Lin were to go for this, it\u2019s going to be a good fight.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, no wonder our President seems so calm today. It\u2019s because he is prepared for it.\u201d</p><br/><p>The crowd laughed. If they left the remaining artworks to Elder Lin, they could be rest assured. They\u2019ve all seen Elder Lin\u2019s artworks before. They were all stunning. Even if they were to study Chinese Arts for the rest of their lives, they might not even draw as well as Elder Lin.</p><br/><p>It was law-defying.</p><br/><p>They were far inferior.</p><br/><p>At Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was a little unhappy with the news online. Chinese Arts was their national treasure. How could people look down on it? What was worse was that the Korean imposters also looked down on them. How could he tolerate this?</p><br/><p>He definitely couldn\u2019t tolerate it.</p><br/><p>Initially, he wanted to just submit ten artworks. With his ability, he would be able to stun everyone even if he were to do it casually.</p><br/><p>However, he decided to do more than just that.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t just want to stun everyone. He wanted them to change their perspective on Chinese Arts.</p><br/><p>He wanted them to feel that they\u2019d never be able to surpass his standard.</p><br/><p>He immediately did a search on the Encyclopedia.</p><br/><p>\u2018Best Chinese Arts\u2019</p><br/><p>Ten legendary artworks.</p><br/><p>The Encyclopedia introduced ten artworks. These artworks were considered to be the best Chinese artworks. He didn\u2019t recognize the names of those artists. However, when he saw the ten artworks, he was confident that he could replicate them.</p><br/><p>It was because he had the mythical boost of the Encyclopedia.</p><br/><p>This was the power that nobody could explain. Even the best knowledge could be drastically improved.</p><br/><p>If he were to present all these artworks, everyone would be stunned speechless.</p><br/><p>He chuckled as he thought of becoming famous in the international arts scene.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you? Why did you laugh so cunningly?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan turned around too. Although she didn\u2019t say anything, her expression had the same meaning as Fraud Tian\u2019s question.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled, \u201cWhat do you mean by cunningly? I was just being confident. Did you read the news online? I am prepared to participate in the International Arts Exhibition. I laughed as I thought to myself that my artworks will shock the whole world.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian touched Lin Fan\u2019s forehead and said curiously, \u201cYou don\u2019t have a fever. Why are you hallucinating? I think you\u2019re awesome but don\u2019t be too cocky. You should know that there would always be someone better\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan moved Fraud Tian\u2019s hand away, \u201cDon\u2019t belittle me. You\u2019ll see how powerful I am.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian looked at Lin Fan and nodded, \u201cYeah, yeah, whatever you said is right.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan came to Lin Fan, \u201cI believe Brother Lin can do it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian said helplessly, \u201cBeauty is in the eye of the beholder. Love is blind. It\u2019s pretty deep.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan gently patted Wu You Lan\u2019s head. Then, he touched it like a kitten, \u201cYou Lan, I love your blind faith. When I win, I\u2019ll draw an artwork for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan smiled and grabbed Lin Fan\u2019s arm, \u201cBrother Lin, don\u2019t lie to me. I trust you a lot.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cAre you sure you trust me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan just said \u2018yeah\u2019. She couldn\u2019t express the happiness she was feeling.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

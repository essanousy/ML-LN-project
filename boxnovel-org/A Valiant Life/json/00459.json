As the director, Zhao Ming Qing was waiting at the entrance.</p><br/><p>At the same time, there was a pair of students standing beside Zhao Ming Qing, one male and one female. The male was Qiu Jie, 24 years of age. He was in year 4 and he was about to graduate. However, he was prepared to continue studying and following an experienced Chinese doctor.</p><br/><p>The other student was about the same age as Qiu Jie. She looked delicate and pretty although she wasn\u2019t considered a beautiful lady.</p><br/><p>The two of them stood beside Director Zhao and their eyes were filled with anticipation for their journey.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing felt a little helpless. He didn\u2019t expect to not even have five students gathered together. If it were to continue like this, perhaps the academy might really have to close down.</p><br/><p>The students there weren\u2019t focused on their studies anymore.</p><br/><p>\u201cDirector, are we waiting for anyone else?\u201d Qiu Jie asked.</p><br/><p>He was respectful to the director and his greatest hope was to be Zhao Ming Qing\u2019s disciple. However, he didn\u2019t have the courage to ask because Director Zhao seemed so powerful and he was just a poor student. What rights did he have?</p><br/><p>\u201cMmm, relax. We\u2019ll go soon,\u201d Zhao Ming Qing replied. He was happy to see these two students. They were the only two students that were willing to join. It showed that they loved Chinese medicine.</p><br/><p>Actually, he could have forced the students to join but he felt that there wasn\u2019t a need to do so. Furthermore, this career required perseverance and passion. They had to love their job and constantly want to learn more knowledge</p><br/><p>The students that walked past were discussing what was happening at the entrance.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow pathetic, there are only two participants. Isn\u2019t it humiliating for the director?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho can be blamed? This kind of voluntary medical work is extremely tough. They\u2019d be out in the sun most of the time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy class teacher asked if anyone wanted to join. Although he sounded a little forceful, nobody bothered about him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOurs too. We\u2019re not even afraid of losing the graduation certificate. Why would we be afraid of our teacher forcing us? I know those two people are the top two students in school. The second student had double the score of the third student. I heard the third student is preparing to go overseas for Western medicine. He didn\u2019t get a score that was good enough to enter the school previously. However, he used Chinese medicine as a stepping stone to enter.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s not stand at the entrance. If the director sees us and catches us, we\u2019d be miserable.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, yeah. Let\u2019s disperse.\u201d</p><br/><p>To the students, this type of activity was a total waste of time. Although it was organized by the director, they weren\u2019t interested. They\u2019d rather use the time to do other things like surfing the Internet and go shopping with their girlfriends.</p><br/><p>Then, a car stopped outside the entrance.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan alighted the car and waved to Zhao Ming Qing. Zhao Ming Qing went forward, \u201cTeacher\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow many people are there?\u201d Lin Fan asked.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing answered embarrassedly, \u201cThere are only two.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan didn\u2019t expect it to be like that. Then, he waved his hand casually, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, I\u2019m fine with two. If there are too many people, it would be difficult to handle. Let\u2019s go to Jiangning.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d Zhao Ming Qing didn\u2019t want to ask much. He just followed where his mentor told him to go.</p><br/><p>There were tools and accessories on the big bus and it was what they needed during treatments and consultations.</p><br/><p>Qiu Jie and Zhang Tong Tong looked at the young man and realized he was about the same age as them. However, it seemed like he was close to the director. They wondered what was the relationship between the two of them. Could he be from the school too?</p><br/><p>However, it didn\u2019t seem like anyone in school drove a Mercedes.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian looked at the time and it was already 8.30 am but Lin Fan wasn\u2019t there yet. Then, he thought of what had happened a few days ago and felt that something was wrong.</p><br/><p>Then, townsfolk started to gather at the entrance of the shop.</p><br/><p>As it was only 8.30am, the townsfolk weren\u2019t anxious. They just stood outside and chatted.</p><br/><p>\u201cI wonder how many pieces Little Boss is going to sell today. Will it still be twenty?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. Little Boss is so kind. He\u2019ll definitely sell twenty pieces.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t talk about it. You managed to buy it two days in a row. We\u2019re so envious of you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, can\u2019t help it. I\u2019m too lucky.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn the past, ten scallion pancakes were not enough and Little Boss suddenly became so kind to increase it by ten. We\u2019re so blessed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFraud, are you sick? Why do you look so pale?\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian lowered his head and looked at the time. Then, he waved his hand, \u201cNo, no. I\u2019m just wondering why he isn\u2019t here yet.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you so anxious? It\u2019s only 8.30 am. Little Boss only comes around 9. Let\u2019s just wait for a while.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian\u2019s heart was beating extremely quickly. He felt that something was wrong.</p><br/><p>Their so-called \u2018kind Little Boss\u2019 might not be that kind after all.</p><br/><p>Something was definitely fishy.</p><br/><p>He was lazy to even make ten pieces of scallion pancakes. There wouldn\u2019t be any reason for him to make twenty. It couldn\u2019t have been because he was kind.</p><br/><p>Ding ding!</p><br/><p>Then, Fraud Tian saw Lin Fan\u2019s phone call.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, he felt that this call seemed fishy.</p><br/><p>However, he had to pick it up.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello, Fraud, I won\u2019t be coming to the shop for a period of time. Let the townsfolk know about it\u2026\u201d Before Lin Fan could finish, he was suddenly interrupted by Fraud Tian.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere are you now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cI\u2019m in the car, leaving Shanghai soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat the f*ck!\u201d Fraud Tian felt like collapsing. It happened again. He knew that this fella wouldn\u2019t be so kind all of a sudden. Everything was planned. He was simply acting first and reporting it afterward. He wanted to tell everyone after he left so that Fraud would be the one picking up after his mess.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, let\u2019s not talk about it. I didn\u2019t have a good sleep last night. Please help me settle the things at the shop. I\u2019ll be back in about twenty days,\u201d Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>*beep*</p><br/><p>The phone call ended.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian held onto the phone and didn\u2019t know what to say. Then, he looked at the townsfolk and swallowed his saliva forcefully. He felt so miserable.</p><br/><p>\u201cI hate you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>In the car.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. He couldn\u2019t have mentioned where he was going. Otherwise, he wouldn\u2019t be allowed to leave.</p><br/><p>He left the things to Fraud Tian as he believed that he would be able to handle it well.</p><br/><p>He opened up Weibo.</p><br/><p>\u201cJiang Ning, I am coming\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>There were comments in an instant.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Boss, quickly come back. You\u2019re so heartless.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Boss, quickly come back. You\u2019re so heartless.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Suddenly, everyone in the comments posted that.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, I got discovered so quickly.\u201d Lin Fan felt helpless. He had already left and there was no way he could return.</p><br/><p>He wanted to quickly finish the task.</p><br/><p>Wait for me, the eleventh page of Encyclopedic Knowledge.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher\u2026\u201d Zhao Ming Qing called.</p><br/><p>When Qiu Jie and Zhang Tong Tong heard that, they were stunned. It was as if they had heard it wrong.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan didn\u2019t reply Zhao Ming Qing. He just smiled, \u201cYour director is my student. I organized this trip. The two of you have to learn and give your best.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two of them were stunned speechless.</p><br/><p>It was too shocking.</p></div>\n</div>"}

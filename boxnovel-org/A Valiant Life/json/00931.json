They just sent me to the airport and went back.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to hang up. What the heck is that? What are they treating you as? Does he think that it\u2019s an honor for you to treat his illness? I\u2019m going to avenge you.\u201d Lin Fan was very displeased with this Health Department. Now that he had the opportunity, he had to flame them.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, why don\u2019t we just forget about it?\u201d Zhao Ming Qing didn\u2019t have any opinions about this but he had no idea what his teacher was thinking at that moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust wait for my update.\u201d Lin Fan then hung up immediately. He felt the opposition was being impudent. How could someone be so arrogant?</p><br/><p>He made a call.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-2\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Zheng Zhong Shan answered the call and smiled widely. \u201cMaster Lin, your student is the real deal. His medical abilities are amazing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan didn\u2019t respond with kind words. \u201cThat\u2019s enough. You guys are bullying him here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy would you say that?\u201d Zheng Zhong Shan was startled and he couldn\u2019t understand it. He didn\u2019t know what had happened.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cWhy else would I say that? My student is already so old and he traveled all the way to Beijing to treat that guy. After that, he just came back empty-handed. Do you think that it\u2019s an honor for my student to treat your friend? Or does he think that by helping me resolve that issue, he has already helped me greatly?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Zheng, what kind of friends do you have?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zheng Zhong Shan was stunned. He didn\u2019t want to take responsibility for this. \u201cElder Lin, I really didn\u2019t know about this. Why is that Elder Ma\u2019s brain becoming more and more blur? I already told him, why didn\u2019t he listen? I\u2019m hanging up now. I\u2019ll go and ask him about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>To Elder Zheng, Elder Lin would definitely say to just forget it and since things were already like that, there was nothing to ask about. However, what Lin Fan actually said was unexpected.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, hurry up and ask him. My student can\u2019t lose out on this,\u201d said Lin Fan.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-3\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cSigh\u2026\u201d Zheng Zhong Shan sighed helplessly. He really didn\u2019t approve of what Elder Ma had done. When interacting with others, one had to reciprocate kindness. Moreover, Elder Ma wasn\u2019t familiar with Master Lin. For Master Lin to send his student to treat his illness and now that his illness had been treated, how could he let Master Lin\u2019s student return empty-handed?</p><br/><p>Hence, reasonably, Zheng Zhong Shan stood on Elder Lin\u2019s side on this matter.</p><br/><p>They hung up.</p><br/><p>Elder Zheng immediately made a call to Elder Ma. Once the call was answered, he immediately spoke, \u201cMa Jun Guo, what the heck are you doing? Let me ask you, what the heck are you trying to do? Master Lin\u2019s student painstakingly came from Shanghai to treat your illness, how could you let him go back empty-handed? Do you think you\u2019re very close to him\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ma Jun Guo had been in a pretty good mood. His leg could move and it had regained feeling. But when he received the call, he became anxious. \u201cElder Zheng, what are you talking about? You can\u2019t falsely accuse me. I took out ten million dollars for him to support his Chinese medicine education. How can you say that I didn\u2019t give him anything?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what\u2019s going on now? Elder Lin just called me asking me what kind of friends I have. I don\u2019t know the situation on your side but on his side, his student returned empty-handed. Can you think in my shoes and don\u2019t make me lose face?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I had known that you would handle things like this, I wouldn\u2019t have given a d*mn about you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zheng Zhong Shan scolded him at every chance mercilessly. Back then, in the military, he would scold Ma Jun Guo just like this until Ma Jun Guo wouldn\u2019t dare to say a word.</p><br/><p>Now that they were old, he would still scold him like this in private.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Zheng, I\u2019ll definitely give you an explanation. I have an idea of what happened now.\u201d Ma Jun Guo understood now. He remembered a certain thing.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-4\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cAlright, settle this on your own. It\u2019s fine if you embarrass yourself but don\u2019t embarrass me. I\u2019m the one who spoke on your behalf. Wouldn\u2019t Elder Lin think that I\u2019m the one bullying his student?\u201d said Zheng Zhong Shan. Then, he hung up.</p><br/><p>Beijing. In a certain study room.</p><br/><p>Ma Jun Guo\u2019s expression was quite unpleasant, thinking about that troublesome grandson of his. This matter had been handed to grandson to handle.</p><br/><p>At the club.</p><br/><p>Ma Jun Guo\u2019s grandson, Ma Xiao Long, was hanging around with his gang of scoundrels. Although it was in the day, on these fun-filled days of theirs, day or night didn\u2019t matter.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Long, why did you call us to come out and play this time? Isn\u2019t your family supervising you strictly?\u201d asked a big fatty.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, even though they\u2019re strict, I still have the time to come out and play around. Let\u2019s not talk about this. Brothers, let\u2019s have a drink. This time, I\u2019m treating.\u201d Ma Xiao Long felt very comfortable.</p><br/><p>But regarding his grandfather\u2019s matter, he was a little upset. <em>Giving a f*cking doctor ten million dollars? F*ck! What kind of doctor is he? Is he embedded with diamonds?</em></p><br/><p>His grandfather had given him a card containing ten million dollars and told him to send the doctor to the airport, then give the card to the doctor.</p><br/><p>Back then, on the way to the airport, he had already decided that he would definitely not give the money to the doctor. He would keep it for himself.</p><br/><p>All these had been done for a reason. Although his grandfather had retired, he still had his status and his family members were still carrying out commercial business. Meanwhile, the opposite party was just a normal doctor. For him to have had the chance to come into contact with their family, it was already an honor.</p><br/><p>In the end, he kept the money for himself and came out with these buddies of his to play around.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-5\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Just as he was thinking about all this, the doors were pushed open and a group of young ladies entered.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, Young Master Ma is in high spirits today. It\u2019s still in broad daylight but you\u2019re already visiting.\u201d The well-dressed brothel keeper was all smiles as he gestured for the ladies by the door to come over. \u201cWhat are you still standing there for? Hurry up and come in.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, he said with a smile, \u201cTake a good look. These are all fresh graduates from top universities. If Young Master Shao has any particular interests, I can contact some of Beijing\u2019s celebrities\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Of course, the celebrities that the brothel keeper was talking about were only second or third-tier celebrities. After all, superstars wouldn\u2019t have any interest in these kids. Perhaps if their fathers came, the superstars might consider it.</p><br/><p>When they played at a higher level, the money they would have to spend would definitely increase very much.</p><br/><p>However, he had enough money on him right now. He wasn\u2019t hesitant at all. Just as he was about to open his mouth, his phone rang.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait a moment. My grandfather is calling. Everyone, quieten down,\u201d said Ma Xiao Long.</p><br/><p>When everyone heard this, they fell silent. Although his grandfather had already retired, his status still remained. Hence, everyone was obedient and no one spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cGrandpa,\u201d Ma Xiao Long greeted politely upon answering the call.</p><br/><p>Although he was the only grandson in the family and Ma Jun Guo loved him, Ma Jun Guo had always been strict with him. However, he had a good mother. Whatever his grandfather taught him would fly away once he was with his mother.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-6\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cDid you do what I told you to do?\u201d Ma Jun Guo\u2019s tone was stern as he asked this.</p><br/><p>Ma Xiao Long was startled. His heart felt a little weak. But he gritted his teeth and said, \u201cGrandpa, what you instructed me to do, I\u2019ve done it\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>But what received him was a series of scoldings.</p><br/><p>\u201cGet yourself back here right now! See if I\u2019ll break your legs\u2026\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

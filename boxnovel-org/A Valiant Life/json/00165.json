It was as if he was waiting for Master Lin to point out issues with the door. And if he really did point out any, then Chief Zhong would feel even more excited.</p><br/><p>He felt that Master Lin was very professional and if he really did point out any issues, it would not be embarrassing at all.</p><br/><p>Since the different features of the doors had been pointed out by Master Lin, Chief Zhong also stepped in to explain further. The technology used was of high value and the Supreme Tiger Electronic Fingerprint Door comprised of different top technologies. It was not like any other door that misled their consumers.</p><br/><p>The live broadcast room was a mess.</p><br/><p>\"We've been tricked.\"</p><br/><p>\"Up till now, I only understand two things. Firstly, Master Lin is very incredible. Secondly, the Supreme Tiger Electronic Fingerprint Door is also very incredible.\"</p><br/><p>\"I feel like buying a Supreme Tiger Electronic Fingerprint Door now. But can we please start unlocking the door?\"</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The reporter went forward and asked, \"Master Lin, can we try unlocking the door first? Everyone is waiting.\"</p><br/><p>\"Sure, let's unlock it.\" Lin Fan nodded and turned to look at Chief Zhong, \"Chief Zhong, I am going to unlock it now. Do not be nervous.\"</p><br/><p>Chief Zhong smiled, \"Master Lin, please do. I would be happy to admit defeat if you unlock it. However, I still do not believe that you can unlock it within ten minutes.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled and started finding his tool. This door did not have a keyhole. To a locksmith, it was impossible to unlock. However, to Lin Fan, there was no problem. The lockpicking skill from the Encyclopedia was really powerful. Although it was not as good as compared to his fortune-telling skill and scallion pancake skill, but still powerful.</p><br/><p>The reporters zoomed in their cameras, trying to capture every moment clearly.</p><br/><p>Chief Zhong also went forward and looked at every action of Master Lin's. He still felt nervous, but not as much as compared to when they first arrived.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan started picking the lock while saying, \"Chief Zhong, your product is really not bad.\"</p><br/><p>Chief Zhong smiled proudly, \"Master Lin, of course. Our Supreme Tiger Electronic Fingerprint Door is the true conscientious door.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded, \"True, it is difficult to unlock without any opening. Furthermore, it is a fingerprint lock, which is more complicated than a pin lock.\"</p><br/><p>The reporter asked, \"Chief Zhong, are there differences between fingerprint locks and pin locks?\"</p><br/><p>Chief Zhong looked at the reporter and proudly replied, \"Fingerprint locks are unique and have high security. Even though pin locks have high security as well, it is still just a password. It is difficult to ensure that the password will not be leaked. The main difference is the complex system of the fingerprint lock. If the door is used long enough, there will be more issues surfacing with pin locks\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Chief Zhong was very confident in his product as it was his hard work. He still felt that Master Lin would not be able to unlock the door within ten minutes.</p><br/><p>The surrounding townsfolks looked at the time.</p><br/><p>\"Four minutes have passed. I'm not sure whether Master Lin can succeed.\"</p><br/><p>\"Heh, I trust him. He will definitely succeed, let's wait and see.\"</p><br/><p>\"He is not anxious at all and is still taking his time. He must be confident.\"</p><br/><p>Inside the live broadcast room.</p><br/><p>\"D*mn, I don't understand what he's doing at all.\"</p><br/><p>\"I also don't understand what he's doing. However, it feels like he's very professional.\"</p><br/><p>\"What's the use of being professional? What matters is if it's effective. I feel that Master Lin is stuck.\"</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang was holding his phone. The comments were flooding his screen.</p><br/><p>\"I will bet ten rockets that Master Lin can unlock the door.\"</p><br/><p>\"I will also bet ten. Look at his movements, they are so smooth. Also, look at his expression, it is so calm.\"</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian stood aside and looked at Lin Fan. He felt regret for not knowing Lin Fan ten years earlier. He could have learned this skill and unlocked some old widows' door.</p><br/><p>However, thinking ten years back, Lin Fan was still a child.</p><br/><p>A reporter said, \"Everyone, Master Lin is trying his best to unlock the door now. Seven minutes have passed, and we are not sure how long more he will take. Let's see what is Chief Zhong thinks.\"</p><br/><p>The reporter asked, \"Chief Zhong, seven minutes have passed. Do you think it is still possible?\"</p><br/><p>Chief Zhong smiled, \"No way. I do not understand Master Lin's way of unlocking. Based on my experience, it is impossible the door in ten minutes. However, even if the door cannot be unlocked, I still respect Master Lin's skills.\"</p><br/><p>The reporter replied, \"Chief Zhong, I think you can rest assured this time. Your product has given Master Lin a lot of stress.\"</p><br/><p>Chief Zhong smiled, \"Yes, I am relieved now. Master Lin previously used his hand to knock down the door. As everyone knows, Master Lin is a martial arts expert and based on his skills, if he wants to open a door, he can just use his hands to smash it open\u2026\"</p><br/><p>The reporters laughed and agreed on the ability of Master Lin.</p><br/><p>Click!</p><br/><p>At that moment, everyone heard a curious sound.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan stood up and shook his feet. \"My legs are numb from squatting. The door is unlocked\u2026\"</p><br/><p>The confident Chief Zhong was shocked and in disbelief.</p><br/><p>In the live broadcast room.</p><br/><p>\"What is going on? I still don't understand.\"</p><br/><p>\"Me too, I just blanked out for a moment and the door is unlocked?\"</p><br/><p>\"F*ck, can anyone explain how it was unlocked?\"</p><br/><p>\"F*ck, this is so f*cking awesome. I am thoroughly convinced.\"</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The reporters quickly rushed forward, \"Master Lin, you unlocked the door?\"</p><br/><p>\"See for yourself,\" Lin Fan gave a pull and the Supreme Tiger Electronic Fingerprint Door really opened.</p><br/><p>The surrounding townsfolk cried out in disbelief. They did not know how Master Lin opened the door even though they were observing him the whole time.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled, \"It should be around eight minutes now. I didn't expect that I could do it below ten minutes.\"</p><br/><p>Those major electronic door companies who were watching the live broadcast started laughing. They did not expect that it would require just eight minutes to open the door. This time, the Supreme Tiger Electronic Fingerprint Door could no longer explain it. But before they became too excited, what came next from the broadcast left them all shocked.</p><br/><p>Chief Zhong was shocked and did not know what to say.</p><br/><p>The reporter asked, \"Master Lin, is it easy to open this Supreme Tiger Electronic Fingerprint Door?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was surprised and smiled, \"This is not easy at all.\"</p><br/><p>The reporter replied, \"You took less than ten minutes. Only eight minutes and you managed to unlock it.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shook his head, \"Chief Zhong's door is different from the rest of the electronic doors. I only need one to two minutes to unlock the rest, but I require eight minutes for this door. Among all the electronic doors I have seen, this door has the best quality. I respect Chief Zhong's technological team.\"</p><br/><p>The reporter asked, \"Master Lin, do you mean that the Supreme Tiger Electronic Fingerprint Door is the most powerful currently?\"</p><br/><p>Lin fan nodded, \"Yes, this is the best among all the electronic doors I have come across.\"</p><br/><p>The reporter awkwardly replied, \"But it only took eight minutes to unlock\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan calmly replied, \"To withstand my hands for eight minutes is considered quite a feat already. Till now, there has been no such door like the Supreme Tiger Electronic Fingerprint Door that can last so long.\"</p><br/><p>As Chief Zhong listened to Lin Fan, he opened his mouth in disbelief. He did not know what to say.</p><br/><p>A door that can only withstand eight minutes was already considered the best in Master Lin's opinion. What kind of sick person could say that?</p><br/><p>Chief Zhong bitterly laughed, not sure to be happy or sad. He gave Lin Fan a thumbs up, \"Master Lin, I admit defeat. Looks like my product is not good enough.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved his hand, \"Chief Zhong, you are too humble. Your door has no problems and to withstand eight minutes is enough to be considered the country's best.\"</p><br/><p>Even at this moment, both were still complimenting each other.</p><br/><p>However, in the end, Lin Fan still had to be the one wrap things up.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

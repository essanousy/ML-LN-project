However, Wang Ming Yang knew him well. He had already said so much, how could Wang Ming Yang not understand?</p><br/><p>But when Wang Ming Yang had looked into Lin Fan\u2019s eyes, it was clear that he understood.</p><br/><p>It was good that he did because that would save Lin Fan from having to say it too directly.</p><br/><p>Nighttime!</p><br/><p>Many people couldn\u2019t fall asleep.</p><br/><p>Of course, there\u2019s no need to talk about Wang Ming Yang and Xu Zi Le. (Use your own imagination)</p><br/><p>Qiao Xue was laying on the bed, thinking about what had happened in the day. Chen He was a big shot. Since the production, she had noticed Chen He looking at her in a peculiar way. However, she didn\u2019t experience his treachery. It could be said that she had dodged a bullet.</p><br/><p>Qiao Xue couldn\u2019t help but think of that Master Lin. She didn\u2019t know him too well. She had only seen him on Weibo before meeting him in person for the first time that night. She couldn\u2019t help but feel slightly curious.</p><br/><p>Especially during the banquet, that dominant image of him had seeped into her heart. It was unlike anything she had seen before.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat kind of person is he exactly?\u201d thought Qiao Xue curiously. Her long hair hung on her shoulders as she leaned on the back of the bed. Then, she took out the phone to see comments about Master Lin on the Internet.</p><br/><p>Gradually, she got immersed in the Internet. Because to her, many of those things done by Master Lin were inconceivable.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cHead, I\u2019ll take my revenge. Tails, I won\u2019t take my revenge.\u201d Chen He couldn\u2019t fall asleep. Every night when he slept, he would call a young lady over to accompany him but tonight, he was well-behaved for the first time. He held a coin in his hand as he kept flipping it around on his palm.</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t stand tonight\u2019s humiliation but he had no choice but to stand it. Every time he closed his eyes, his mind was filled with that guy\u2019s horrifying smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck, let\u2019s do it.\u201d He placed the coin on his thumb and flicked it up into the air. The coin kept turning in the air as Chen He watched it unblinkingly. His expression was grave. He wondered if it would be Heads or Tails.</p><br/><p>There was complete silence as the coin fell onto the bed mattress.</p><br/><p>Chen He\u2019s pupils contracted. A look of disbelief was in his eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow can that be?\u201d</p><br/><p>Quietly lying on the mattress, the side facing upwards was\u2026</p><br/><p>Heads!</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck! Even if it\u2019s heads, I won\u2019t take revenge. Time to sleep.\u201d Chen He decided not to think too much. He would go to the airport early the next morning and quickly leave this troublesome place. However, he still hadn\u2019t done an important thing.</p><br/><p>He took out his phone and made a call to Director Jin. He told Director Jin that that day\u2019s matter was not to be spread.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t dare to show any discontentment towards Master Lin but to people like Director Jin, he would always be the fearsome Chen He.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Several days later!</p><br/><p>Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>Elder Liang came over. \u201cLittle Boss, what are you doing? When I passed by just now, I saw you using your phone. Now that I\u2019m back, you\u2019re still using your phone.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShush!\u201d Lin Fan placed his index finger on his mouth, indicating silence. \u201cToday, the results of the Youth Chinese Arts Cup are being released. I\u2019m refreshing the webpage. They said it would be out at 2 pm but it\u2019s already 2.05 pm now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe results are being released today?\u201d Elder Liang was surprised. Then, he saw that Little Boss was still using his phone and hurriedly said, \u201cWhat are you still using your phone for? Come to my place and use my computer.\u201d</p><br/><p>Since that incident a while ago, the Internet Safety Department had one request for Lin Fan, which was for him not to use his computer skills anymore. He was still allowed to surf the Internet normally. However, he had not gotten his computer back, nor had he bought a new one.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was someone who was true to his word. He would never go back on his promises. Since he said that he wouldn\u2019t use his computer skills anymore, he definitely wouldn\u2019t use them.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d Lin Fan did not hesitate at all. He immediately followed Elder Liang.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan and the rest followed along as well. Nanshan Children\u2019s Welfare Institute wasn\u2019t just Lin Fan\u2019s blood and sweat. It was theirs too. The cared very much about those children.</p><br/><p>Now that the results were going to be released, naturally, they had to see it.</p><br/><p>Elder Liang\u2019s shop.</p><br/><p>The Internet page was being refreshed.</p><br/><p>Gradually, Elder Zhang and Sister Hong came as well. They were all gathered there, staring at the computer.</p><br/><p>Sister Hong said, \u201cWhy aren\u2019t the results out yet? It\u2019s already 2.10 pm now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Zhang said, \u201cDon\u2019t be impatient. This isn\u2019t the college entrance exams. Maybe their website is delayed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang said, \u201cIt can\u2019t be that the results announcer is asleep right? It\u2019s already past the time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSigh, be patient. It\u2019s out! It\u2019s out!\u201d Elder Liang cried out in surprise. Then, he immediately looked at the first prize.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the screen.</p><br/><p>First Prize: Wang Hao Yang (Beijing)</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, the first prize winner isn\u2019t from our Children\u2019s Welfare Institute. What\u2019s going on?\u201d said Fraud Tian in surprise.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan felt a bit of sorrow but it quickly dispersed. If they didn\u2019t get the first prize, then so be it. Perhaps that child from Beijing was really amazing. Although Lil\u2019 Fatty was very talented. He wasn\u2019t the only talented child in the country.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s look at the second prize.\u201d Lin Fan was in anticipation.</p><br/><p>Second Prize: Lil\u2019 Fatty (Shanghai), Wang Hong Hong (Shanghai), Zhang Meng (Shanghai)\u2026</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled, \u201cThis Lil\u2019 Fatty is pretty good. Although he didn\u2019t get the first prize, second prize is amazing too. The others are amazing too. Our Nanshan Children\u2019s Welfare Institute has really taken the spotlight.\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Liang said, \u201cDon\u2019t be anxious. Let\u2019s look at the third prize too. And there\u2019s even the Merit Award.\u201d</p><br/><p>They scrolled down.</p><br/><p>\u201cWow,\u201d Elder Liang gasped in shock, \u201cLook, all the Third Prize winners are from our Nanshan Children\u2019s Welfare Institute too. And look at the Merit Award. The number of people awarded is too high, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked closely and started laughing. \u201cI knew it. All of our Nanshan Children\u2019s Welfare Institute children have won prizes. They\u2019re awesome.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWeren\u2019t there only supposed to be fifty names for the Merit Award?\u201d asked Sister Hong in a puzzled tone.</p><br/><p>Elder Zhang barged into the conversation, \u201cIt must be because our children are amazing. Their art prices look too good and the judges must have felt that it would be a shame for them not to get any prizes, so they increased the quota. Don\u2019t you guys think so?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded, \u201cMmm, that\u2019s right. These judges from the Chinese Arts Association really know how to do things. But for all the names to be from our children, when the parents of other children sees this, they\u2019ll be furious. They\u2019ll definitely think that there is some sort of shady deal involved.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan looked at Lin Fan. \u201cBrother Lin, actually, I can see that you\u2019re a little sad that Lil\u2019 Fatty didn\u2019t get the first prize. You\u2019ve always thought that Lil\u2019 Fatty would get the first prize, haven\u2019t you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan didn\u2019t try to hide the truth.</p><br/><p>\u201cMmm, I have a lot of confidence in Lil\u2019 Fatty. This kid hasn\u2019t had enough experience in the arts but be has attained the freehand brushwork skill that other people have much trouble grasping. At his age, there aren\u2019t many people who can do it. It shouldn\u2019t have been a problem for him to win the first prize and I never expected him not to win it. It\u2019s a bit of a shame,\u201d said Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian didn\u2019t understand all this. \u201cWhat\u2019s that freehand brushwork that you\u2019re talking about? I don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled, \u201cTo let the heart feel and the brush go freely, without paying much attention to the lines. That is freehand brushwork. Chinese art is divided into fine brushwork and freehand brushwork. Fine brushwork focuses on the beauty of the lines and it is very meticulous. But when compared, freehand brushwork will always win.\u201d</p><br/><p>They had never known all this before but after listening to Little Boss\u2019s explanation, they all understood. It meant that Lil\u2019 Fatty was really amazing and most people wouldn\u2019t be able to beat him.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cOh right, let me take a look at Lil\u2019 Fatty\u2019s artwork.\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Liang clicked on an image and an artwork appeared on the screen.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan frowned. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t make sense. The freehand brushing technique in this artwork is very strong. It\u2019s definitely not something a six-year-old can grasp. If this only got him second prize, how great must the first prize winner be? Elder Liang, let\u2019s take a look at the first prize artwork.\u201d</p><br/><p>But when the first prize artwork was displayed, Lin Fan was startled. He instantly blurted out vulgarities, \u201cF*ck! This was a f*cking shady deal. This artwork, compared to Lil\u2019 Fatty\u2019s, is a few levels lower. And they dare to give it first place? This is absurd!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Little Boss, what shady deal are you talking about?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, something seems wrong. I don\u2019t understand Chinese Art but Lil\u2019 Fatty\u2019s artwork looks much more pleasing than this one. It has more emotion.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan realized that Lin Fan was making an ugly expression and was a little angry as well. She pulled on Lin Fan\u2019s sleeve. \u201cBrother Lin, there\u2019s a shady deal behind this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded, \u201cMmm.\u201d</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t want to say more. If the person who had beat Lil\u2019 Fatty had been better than him, Lin Fan wouldn\u2019t have anything to say. If Lil\u2019 Fatty really was inferior in skill, then it would be okay to lose.</p><br/><p>But what the heck was this?</p><br/><p>They couldn\u2019t tell Lin Fan that he didn\u2019t understand art. In Chinese Arts, if Lin Fan claimed to be second, no one would dare to claim to be first.</p><br/><p>He was that dominant.</p></div>\n</div>"}

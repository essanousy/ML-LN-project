Why do you look so depressed?\u201d Inside a high-grade tea shop, a group of sons of wealthy families was bragging and boasting, making lots of noise. One particular person realized that the once talkative Young Liang was not talking at all, and this, of course, sparked the curiosity of others.</p><br/><p>Liang Hong Tian waved his hand, \u201cNothing much. You guys can keep talking, I\u2019m not in a very good mood.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm? Not in a good mood? Let me help you.\u201d</p><br/><p>All of a sudden, a voice which caused Liang Hong Tian to be terrified could be heard. He turned his head around and when he saw the figure, he began to tremble.</p><br/><p>The crowd suspiciously looked over, not knowing who this person was. This was a high-grade tea shop. Ordinary people weren\u2019t allowed in. How did this b*stard get in?</p><br/><p>Liang Hong Tian stood up, \u201cYou\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly, a familiar scene occurred in front of him once again.</p><br/><p>This cruel b*stard once again grabbed hold of his wrist. It was exactly the same as the previous two times when he grabbed his wrist.</p><br/><p>What comes next would definitely be the crazy slapping, right?</p><br/><p>At this moment, Liang Hong Tian began panicking. He started to struggle. However, the person in front of him was just too strong. No matter how he struggled, there was just no use.</p><br/><p>\u201cSave me\u2026\u201d Liang Hong Tian faced his brothers beside him and screamed, hoping that they would be able to help him.</p><br/><p>*Slap!*</p><br/><p>Lin Fan just kept slapping him. \u201cThey aren\u2019t going to help you. Remember, you have to hate me.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was that familiar feeling again. Liang Hong Tian was getting beaten again.</p><br/><p>He turned his head to face his brothers. However, what made him lose all hope was that the people who he called brothers didn\u2019t even make a single move.</p><br/><p>They even began talking to each other, causing him to really lose all hope.</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone, don\u2019t make a move. This guy actually dares to beat Liang Hong Tian. That means he doesn\u2019t have an ordinary background. We shouldn\u2019t invite any trouble for ourselves.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be rash. Let\u2019s look at the situation.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe actually dares to beat Liang Hong Tian. Just where is this person from?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not too sure. But looking at Young Liang\u2019s expression, it doesn\u2019t seem to be the first time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you remember my name?\u201d Lin Fan asked.</p><br/><p>Liang Hong Tian was completely stunned. What was happening? He had almost done something bad yesterday, but he hadn\u2019t done it in the end. Why was it that he had to get slapped every time he saw him?</p><br/><p>No matter how aggressive this guy was, how could he be this aggressive?</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t even give him a way out,</p><br/><p>*Slap!*</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems like you still don\u2019t remember. Listen carefully. My name is Lin Fan. Do you understand?\u201d</p><br/><p>*Pitter-patter!*</p><br/><p>The attacks came from the left and right. Liang Hong Tian was once again lying on the sofa, his eyes flickering. He had already lost all sense of direction.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan saw that the situation was enough, and so it was about time he left.</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan left, the crowd immediately surrounded Liang Hong Tian. \u201cYoung Liang, where\u2019s that person from? He actually dared to beat you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah! Where\u2019s he from?\u201d</p><br/><p>The crowd was only concerned about where Lin Fan was from, but none of them were concerned about his condition.</p><br/><p>After Liang Hong Tian recovered, he didn\u2019t say a thing, but just took his leave.</p><br/><p>Leaving behind the group of sons of wealthy families to look at each other in dismay.</p><br/><p>At night, he once again met that terrifying b*stard. He was taught a lesson in front of pretty ladies.</p><br/><p>The next day.</p><br/><p>At noon.</p><br/><p>In the evening.</p><br/><p>To Liang Hong Tian, this b*stard was terrifying. He was a nightmare. Someone that he would never forget in his lifetime.</p><br/><p>At night.</p><br/><p>Qingtian Bay Racing event.</p><br/><p>The event was already full of people. There were ordinary people, sons of wealthy families and even children of officials here. They all loved the exhilarating event equally. Over here, they were all talking about the same topic \u2013 tonight\u2019s race.</p><br/><p>There were people here taking part in the race and there were others that were just looking for something exciting.</p><br/><p>It was an event that took place once every three years. It would definitely be exciting.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck! That car is beautiful. It definitely costs more than four million.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cListen to the sound of the engine. It has definitely been modified before. This is insane. It\u2019s so fast it can probably fly!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAwesome! This Qingtian Bay Race will definitely be entertaining!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard that the professional racer Irvine is coming as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes! He\u2019s here! I just saw him. He clinched first place in the World Championships before! He\u2019s also the top five in America\u2019s racing world. I wonder how many people have been scared by his drifting abilities.\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, a red race car made a beautiful turn. It attracted the gaze of the crowd.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh! The little fairy from the Ye family is here.\u201d</p><br/><p>The car door opened. A pretty lady looked up and proudly came out. Even though she was dressed in sporting gear, it still couldn\u2019t conceal her intoxicating beauty.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Fairy Ye, are you taking part in tonight\u2019s race?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye Tong Xian looked at the crowd of people, \u201cAre you all looking for death? Don\u2019t call me little fairy. Little fairy is what people call prostitutes in olden days. What are you all trying to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn that case, we\u2019ll call you Little Princess.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha.\u201d</p><br/><p>In Beijing, Ye Tong Xian was a beauty. Her personality was touching and had unparalleled charm. However, her temperament wasn\u2019t very good.</p><br/><p>\u201cEnough bullsh*t. What time is the competition starting?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot so soon. There are still people who haven\u2019t arrived.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye Tong Xian unhappily said, \u201cWho\u2019s such a big shot that he hasn\u2019t arrived?\u201d</p><br/><p>Just at this moment, a booming sound could be heard.</p><br/><p>Following closely after were two race cars coming in.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, not only did Young Liang come here, but so did Young Master Zhou!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow\u2019s that possible? I can understand why Young Liang would be here, but why would Young Master Zhou be here? Isn\u2019t he being controlled by that old man?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat was all in the past. Young Master Zhou is going to get married soon. Don\u2019t tell me you guys didn\u2019t know that. That\u2019s why that old man is willing to let the Young Master out to play.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo wonder\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>In an instant, many people had arrived.</p><br/><p>Liang Hong Tian had undergone much torture in this period of time. His willpower had been broken down. However, today, he was here to show off his new car.</p><br/><p>However, he didn\u2019t think that Young Master Zhou would be here as well. His mood didn\u2019t improve at all. After getting off his car, he leaned on his car door and looked at the bunch of people.</p><br/><p>Ye Tong Xian took one glance at Young Master Zhou, then proceeded to shout towards Liang Hong Tian, \u201cLiang Hong Tian, I\u2019ve heard that you\u2019ve been beaten up quite seriously in recent times. Why haven\u2019t you gone to cause trouble for the person?\u201d</p><br/><p>When Liang Hong Tian heard this, his heart immediately shuddered. He then looked away, ignoring her.</p><br/><p>When some people heard this, they were momentarily curious. They couldn\u2019t understand it. Liang Hong Tian got beaten up by someone? That\u2019s impossible, right?</p><br/><p>\u201cAlmost everyone is here. We have to block off the area soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWait! There\u2019s another car coming.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho\u2019s car is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt looks like Chang Hai Ge\u2019s car.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s he doing here? Didn\u2019t he get into an accident previously? He still has the guts to come and play?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho knows? People with skill are usually bolder.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The car stopped.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan, Chang Hai Ge, and Shen Ming stepped out of the car.</p><br/><p>Zhou Tian Fu was momentarily stunned when he saw the person but proceeded to smile afterward.</p><br/><p>Liang Hong Tian\u2019s face became completely white when he saw who came. He furiously turned his head away, hoping to avoid that b*stard.</p><br/><p>However, a frightening sound came.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh! Young Liang, you\u2019re here as well? Have you finally remembered who I am?\u201d Lin Fan laughed.</p><br/><p>When Liang Hong Tian heard this, his entire body shuddered.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t wait for Lin Fan to say anymore. His emotions became unstable.</p><br/><p>\u201cHold it right there. What the hell are you trying to do?\u201d Liang Hong Tian\u2019s emotions were unstable. He shouted with all his might. He thought of the experiences he had had the past two days and immediately, he felt like crying. Who exactly did he offend? Why did he have to endure this?</p><br/><p>Lin Fan slowly went forward. It seemed that he had drawn out his hatred well. \u201cYoung Liang, what happened? You\u2019re asking me what I\u2019m trying to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStand right there!\u201d Liang Hong Tian took a few steps back.</p><br/><p>The surrounding people were all skeptical.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you guys think happened to Liang Hong Tian?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. His emotions don\u2019t seem right.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho is this guy? Liang Hong Tian seems to recognize him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liang Hong Tian stretched out his hand. His breathing seemed to have stabilized. \u201cWhat are you trying to do? In what way have I offended you? Are you going to treat me this way? You have already gotten away with it the past few days. What are you forcing me to do? You have already beaten me, not just once but for the past few f*cking days. Have you ever thought of my feelings?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan gasped. He realized that the situation wasn\u2019t supposed to be this way.</p><br/><p>Liang Hong Tian had an extreme mood swing. He continued to shout, \u201cYes! I\u2019m the one at fault. I want to get girls drunk and bring them to my room. But have I done it? I have not! I didn\u2019t think of the consequences. There are so many girls on this planet. I wouldn\u2019t just set my sights on one of them. Even at home, I\u2019m put under a lot of pressure. When I go out, I get beaten up by you. Have you ever thought about my feelings? Tell me, what do you want me to do? There are so many people present here today. If you want to embarrass me, just tell me! I\u2019ll just beat myself up.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liang Hong Tian got so worked up. His eyes were red and tears were flowing uncontrollably out of them.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t think that he would be like this either. Yet this guy here was like a ghost, always grabbing onto him and embarrassing him in front of his friends.</p><br/><p>\u201cTell me! Can I just beat myself up? I beg you to let me go!\u201d Liang Hong Tian was shouting his heart out.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was stunned. This wasn\u2019t what he had expected at all. Thereafter, he skeptically asked, \u201cAfter that day, you didn\u2019t think of getting revenge? Or raping anyone?\u201d</p><br/><p>Liang Hong Tian\u2019s breathing became more and more rapid. \u201cWhat did you say? This is Beijing! Not some forest! Rape? Have you been reading too many novels? That is a crime, don\u2019t you know? There are so many girls around, so why would there be a need to take revenge just because of one girl? What are you even thinking about? Tell me! I, Liang Hong Tian, will definitely satisfy you at the expense of my face!\u201d</p><br/><p>The more he said, the more upset he got.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck!\u201d Lin Fan suddenly realized that he might have overthought things a bit too much.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Lin Fan went in front of Liang Hong Tian and stretched out his hand. It momentarily scared Liang Hong Tian but and the slap that he was expecting didn\u2019t come. He realized that Lin Fan\u2019s hand was placed on his shoulder.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, Young Liang. I\u2019m sorry, it was I who overthought it too much. I have embarrassed you the past few days for nothing. I won\u2019t hit you anymore in future. You won\u2019t blame me right?\u201d Lin Fan looked at the other party and spoke. Right now, when he thought about it, he felt what he did had been a bit too overboard.</p><br/><p>Liang Hong Tian was stunned. After which, he looked at Lin Fan and said, \u201cAll this time you were thinking that I would take revenge? Or rape someone?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan really wanted to say no, but he decided to speak the truth. He nodded his head, \u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, Liang Hong Tian cried tears of pain, \u201cI really didn\u2019t think of those.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan patted him, \u201cNow I know as well. Don\u2019t be too upset. Your face doesn\u2019t hurt anymore, I hope.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t care about me. Really. Let\u2019s end today\u2019s events here. In future, whenever you see me, take it as you don\u2019t recognize me and I\u2019ll do the same too. I\u2019m really scared. From when I was young until now, I\u2019ve never experienced such a thing. Also, in future, don\u2019t read so many novels. This is Beijing, not a village. It also isn\u2019t ten years in the past. I\u2019m only 22 years old. How can I\u2026how can I take revenge on someone? Can\u2019t I just say a few hateful words? I didn\u2019t do anything.\u201d Liang Hong Tian had a huge mood swing. He got so agitated that he was choked with tears.</p><br/><p>\u201cI promise that in future I\u2019d never get a girl drunk again. Can you stay away from me? I\u2019m afraid of you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking at how Liang Hong Tian was, Lin Fan sighed. This was really just because he had over thought too f*cking much.</p><br/><p>F*ck. That\u2019s right.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Lin Fan suddenly thought of a key point.</p><br/><p>When he had first seen Liang Hong Tian, he had seen that he would die. But now, he was clear.</p><br/><p>Wu Ya Ting was going to die, and that would cause Wu Yun Gang to be enraged as well and in turn, come and kill Liang Hong Tian. The people behind Liang Hong Tian would definitely not forgive Wu Yun Gang, therefore\u2026</p><br/><p>Understood.</p><br/><p>Everything had been understood.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan patted Liang Hong Tian on his shoulder, \u201cDon\u2019t be agitated. I\u2019ve hit the wrong person. Go and cry in the car. I won\u2019t hit your face in future.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liang Hong Tian couldn\u2019t stand this feeling of being wronged. He hid in his car and began venting his emotions.</p><br/><p>Even though he liked pretty girls, in future, he would never get any of them drunk again.</p><br/><p>Within these few days, he had deeply experienced the meaning of \u201closing all hope\u201d.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

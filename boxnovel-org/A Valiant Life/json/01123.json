It really tastes pretty good,\u201d said Lin Fan praisingly. The six dishes and soup were very plentiful. Also, he had to admit that these two ladies\u2019 skills were really pretty good.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you for the praise, Brother Lin. This is the result of us working for the whole day,\u201d said Xu Zi Le with a smile. Then, she picked the bottle of red wine. As she was about to open it, she hesitated for a moment, then she put it down. Instead, she took out the white wine.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s drink white wine instead today. These dishes would clash with red wine.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xu Zi Le was all smiles as she opened the bottle of white wine and she filled everyone\u2019s cups.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at his wine glass, then measured it with his finger. \u201cThis is going all out. With so much in one glass, it\u2019s easy to get drunk. I have to be careful.\u201d</p><br/><p>Right now, with his Wuxia class of knowledge, he would be fine no matter how much he drank.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Are you scared?\u201d said Wang Ming Yang as he looked at Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, alright. Since it\u2019s like this, let\u2019s do it. I\u2019m not afraid. But if you guys get drunk, don\u2019t blame me for now taking care of you,\u201d said Lin Fan. Then, he looked at Wu Huan Yue and said, \u201cHuan Yue, you shouldn\u2019t drink. You\u2019ll still have to sing. This wine isn\u2019t good for your throat.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xu Zi Le nodded. \u201cYeah, Huan Yue shouldn\u2019t drink. Let us drink with Brother Lin. But it\u2019ll be fine if Huan Yue drinks a bit of red wine.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt would help to add to the fun.\u201d</p><br/><p>She placed particular emphasis on that final sentence.</p><br/><p>Thinking back to what they had said in the kitchen, Wu Huan Yue\u2019s face turned red. Then, she sneaked a glance at Brother Lin. When she realized that he didn\u2019t look peculiar, she let out a breath of relief.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome, let\u2019s have a toast.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, Wang Ming Yang raised his cup. He looked at Lin Fan with challengingly as if to say \u2018I\u2019ll take it as my loss if you can walk out of here peacefully tonight.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cMing Yang, you really want to play for real,\u201d said Lin Fan with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean by that? It\u2019s just a casual drink,\u201d said Wang Ming Yang. He looked at his cup and his heart felt a little weak. If he were to drink this much in one go, he\u2019d definitely be in trouble. He could only drink a small sip.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, then let\u2019s have a drink.\u201d Lin Fan smiled. He didn\u2019t argue with Wang Ming Yang. Drinking was about adding to the atmosphere. If the were to get drunk, it would really be meaningless.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang looked at Lin Fan. \u201cThose songs you wrote for Huan Yue are getting waves of good comments. Their sales are much higher than the previous albums.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because Huan Yue\u2019s voice is good too.\u201d Lin Fan nodded. You must be joking. Those songs were from the Encyclopedia. How could they be average?</p><br/><p>Moreover, he only picked from the golden songs.</p><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue giggled happily. She had incomparable faith in Lin Fan. Also, she knew that all those songs were good songs. They couldn\u2019t be compared to those typical pop songs.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Lin, I\u2019ll drink to you as well.\u201d Xu Zi Le smiled as she raised her wine glass. As she looked at Wu Huan Yue from the corner of her eyes, she let out a small grin.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cAre you two taking turns to try and get me drunk today?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Lin, what do you mean by that? How could there be something like that?\u201d Xu Zi Le laughed. Then, she kicked Wang Ming Yang under the table.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang instantly came to his senses. \u201cCome on. We\u2019re just beginning. You can\u2019t be done already, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled and didn\u2019t say much. He immediately took another gulp of wine. He already knew how tonight\u2019s dinner would end up.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang and Xu Zi Le would have to kneel tonight.</p><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue sat by the side as she occasionally placed some food on Lin Fan\u2019s plate. As she saw the two of them getting Brother Lin to drink nonstop, she couldn\u2019t quite bear it.</p><br/><p>However, just as she spoke, Xu Zi Le interrupted.</p><br/><p>After three rounds of drinks.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan\u2019s face was still calm. He hadn\u2019t changed at all.</p><br/><p>On the other hand, Wang Ming Yang and Xu Zi Le\u2019s faces were both red and they looked a little drunk.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Lin, how do you feel?\u201d Xu Zi Le asked. She hadn\u2019t expected Brother Lin\u2019s alcohol tolerance to be so high. It wasn\u2019t the same as before.</p><br/><p>In the past, she had drunk with Brother Lin before. She knew that Brother Lin\u2019s alcohol tolerance was just average.</p><br/><p>But now, it was already the second cup and even she had started to get muddle-headed. However, Brother Lin still looked perfectly fine.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shook his head, then rubbed his head. \u201cI\u2019m a little muddle-headed. If I drink a bit more, I\u2019ll really be drunk.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang waved his hand. \u201cSince you\u2019ve come tonight, you\u2019re not going anywhere. Just stay here tonight. I have lots of rooms here and you can choose any of them. Let\u2019s go for another round of drinks.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright then. Let\u2019s drink another round,\u201d said Lin Fan with a smile.</p><br/><p>These two were obviously trying to get him drunk. But that was good. He was going to let the two of them experience true terror.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Lin, you don\u2019t have to drink too much,\u201d said Wu Huan Yue worriedly. However, she saw that Brother Lin\u2019s face hadn\u2019t changed at all. Instead, Sister Xu and Brother Wang were all red and they looked slightly drunk. The way they spoke was not like how they had been at first.</p><br/><p>Moreover, their conditions were still constantly changing.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother, I have to tell you that I\u2019ve never really admired anyone in my life as much as I admire you. Let\u2019s drink,\u201d said Wang Ming Yang with a smile. He then flicked his head as he cursed in his heart.</p><br/><p>He wondered how could his brother drink this much? When he just got to know him, he couldn\u2019t even drink a few bottles of beer. Why does it seem like he wasn\u2019t affected at all?</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. \u201cThis is just beginning. In the future, you\u2019ll have a lot more chances to admire me. But Ming Yang, if you can\u2019t drink anymore, you should stop. It wouldn\u2019t feel good if you drink too much.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang waved his hand. \u201cNo. I\u2019m happy today. Even if I\u2019m drunk, I\u2019d still be happy. But you mustn\u2019t take photos of me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. Even if we get drunk, we\u2019d be happy,\u201d said Xu Zi Le.</p><br/><p>However, she was just as shocked as Ming Yang.</p><br/><p>She had also realized that something wasn\u2019t right. They were taking turns to drink but they still couldn\u2019t get Brother Lin drunk. <em>Could the wine be fake?</em></p><br/><p><em>But it\u2019s not possible. If it is fake, why are the two of us drunk?</em></p><br/><p><em>It must be that some people just don\u2019t turn red when they\u2019re drunk. Brother Lin must actually be drunk too.</em></p><br/><p><em>Right. That must be the case.</em></p><br/><p>After thinking it through, Xu Zi Le started drinking freely as well. For Huan Yue, she was going all out.</p><br/><p>As a celebrity, she attended many banquets. If she couldn\u2019t tolerate alcohol, she wouldn\u2019t be able to make it.</p><br/><p>Another three rounds of drinking passed.</p><br/><p>\u201cLalalala\u2026\u201d Wang Ming Yang started singing. Moreover, he was singing strange things and he was laughing idiotically every once in a while.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan blinked a few times. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh. I\u2019m okay. Why wouldn\u2019t I be? Let me rest for a moment. We\u2019ll continue in a while.\u201d Wang Ming Yang was weak and powerless as he waved his hand.</p><br/><p>Xu Zi Le had her head lowered. She was so drunk that she didn\u2019t want to talk anymore. She seemed to be thinking about something. In reality, her head was spinning and turning. She was so dizzy that it was hard to take.</p><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue quickly poured three glasses of water.</p><br/><p>\u201cSister Xu, Brother Wang, drink some water,\u201d said Wu Huan Yue.</p><br/><p>Xu Zi Le placed her hand over Wu Huan Yue\u2019s shoulder. Her eyes squinted as she said, \u201cHuan Yue, let me tell you. Tonight, Sister Xu said she will help you, so she will help you. Trust Sister Xu, okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue was embarrassed. \u201cSister Xu, you drank too much.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m fine. This bit of alcohol isn\u2019t even enough to warm me up. I\u2019ll drink again in a bit.\u201d Xu Zi Le waved her hand. She probably didn\u2019t even know what she was talking about anymore.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the time. \u201cIt\u2019s getting late. Let\u2019s end this here for tonight.\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

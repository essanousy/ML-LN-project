Whenever he had nothing to do in the morning, he would bring a few puppies and walk around Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>However, Elder Dog would disappear before the afternoons.</p><br/><p>People didn\u2019t know where Elder Dog had gone but Lin Fan knew that he must have gone to boast to other dogs.</p><br/><p>The \u2018Righteous Pet Food\u2019 was really sick. It increased the capabilities of Elder Dog by so much. He was probably too good to even be called the Godly Dog.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow pathetic, how pitiful.\u201d Then, Fraud Tian was sitting at the entrance and he sighed while looking at his phone.</p><br/><p>\u201cFraud, what are you looking at?\u201d Lin Fan asked. It was probably not something simple since it made him so sad.</p><br/><p>\u201cNothing much, I read a news article. That\u2026 Forget it. I\u2019ll send it to you.\u201d Fraud Tian wanted to save the trouble and he immediately sent it to Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan unlocked his phone.</p><br/><p>\u2018The Fire Girl got expelled from school.\u2019</p><br/><p>After reading it, he felt that the news was really saddening.</p><br/><p>Three years ago, a beautiful lady ran into a fire to save her neighbor\u2019s kid and got burnt. As a result, her face was ruined. She depended on herself and managed to enter University. However, after studying for half a semester, she was about to be expelled from school.</p><br/><p>It was because her face was too scary. Everyone in the class was frightened by it. Especially when she came out at night. That scared the living hell out of everyone. Most of the students told the school that she should be expelled.</p><br/><p>After the school\u2019s discussion, they decided to expel her.</p><br/><p>On Weibo.</p><br/><p>Many netizens started to comment about it.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, this school is too ruthless. Why are they expelling her?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThese stupid kids don\u2019t have any leniency at all.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI think she should leave the school. She\u2019s so ugly. She should just scare herself. Why is she scaring the others?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c^ F*ck you, I\u2019ll f*ck your mom.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShanghai Jin He University, isn\u2019t it a good school? Why did they do such a thing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, f*ckers, she became like that because she did a good deed a few years ago. I can\u2019t believe people are despising her because of it. That\u2019s disgusting.\u201d</p><br/><p>The netizens were really emotional on Weibo.</p><br/><p>Of course, there were several netizens that sided the school as they felt that the school did the right thing.</p><br/><p>She looked so scary and it was right for her to leave.</p><br/><p>What if she were to scare a student to death one day? That would be disastrous.</p><br/><p>However, most netizens were upright and they felt that this was an unacceptable discrimination.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shook his head after reading the comments. He felt that Jin He University didn\u2019t do the right thing. As the righteous Master Lin, he had to do something about it.</p><br/><p>He immediately logged in to Weibo.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan: @Jin He University, the way you handled this matter is too disappointing. Furthermore, you\u2019re an educational institution. I didn\u2019t expect you to look at people differently with your dog eyes. Whoever that enrolls in this University in the future, is an idiot.</p><br/><p>Anyway, it was all online and he wasn\u2019t afraid of voicing out his opinions. He just wanted to flame the school.</p><br/><p>Instantly, netizens started to comment on his post.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell said.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI am supportive of Master Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*cking hell. This lousy University. Whoever goes there is an idiot.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, what does he mean by \u2018look at people differently with your dog eyes\u2019?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho am I supposed to ask?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go to the Weibo of this stupid University to flame them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>At Jin He University.</p><br/><p>\u201cH, it doesn\u2019t look good. Master Lin is flaming us on Weibo,\u201d a teacher said anxiously.</p><br/><p>The school\u2019s headmaster was stunned, \u201cMaster Lin? What Master Lin?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin of Cloud Street.\u201d</p><br/><p>When the headmaster heard that, he was worried. This man was a powerful one. Only a handful of people in Shanghai didn\u2019t know who he was. Then, he asked anxiously, \u201cWhat did he say?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHeadmaster, look at it yourself,\u201d the teacher immediately opened up Weibo and passed it to the headmaster.</p><br/><p>The headmaster looked at the Weibo post and stood up. His face had turned red, \u201cD*mn, how can he say that? What does he mean by that? He said those that enroll in this University are idiots? What did we do to him?\u201d</p><br/><p>The teacher was helpless.</p><br/><p>\u201cHeadmaster, we didn\u2019t offend him but he offended us. This piece of news is on the trending list now. I think it\u2019s because he posted on Weibo and the news is under the spotlight now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too much. It\u2019s really too much. I will contact him now. Does he know that the Weibo post will affect our school?\u201d The headmaster was fuming and he immediately called him.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello, is this Master Lin? I am the headmaster of Jin He University. May I know what you meant by your Weibo post? I hope you can delete it,\u201d the headmaster said angrily.</p><br/><p>They started to talk.</p><br/><p>Initially, the headmaster was trying to control his anger. However, he couldn\u2019t take it anymore.</p><br/><p>He immediately slammed the phone.</p><br/><p>\u201cHeadmaster, what did he say?\u201d The teacher asked.</p><br/><p>The headmaster replied, \u201cWhat did he say? He is so shameless. This is not how you use freedom of speech. How can he just scold us like that? He said that if we\u2019re unhappy, we can sue him. Does he really think that we don\u2019t dare to do that?\u201d</p><br/><p>The teacher replied, \u201cHeadmaster, please calm down. Master Lin is really reputable. If we were to go to court, we\u2019d be infamous.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cInfamous? Aren\u2019t we infamous now?\u201d The headmaster said angrily.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t expect this matter to have attracted the attention of this fella.</p><br/><p>At Cloud Street!</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian asked, \u201cWho just called?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cWho else? It was from the University. I just flamed them on Weibo and he immediately asked me to delete it. I didn\u2019t care about what he said.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian was a little angry, \u201cWhat is wrong with the school? It is totally different from the past.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cWho knows? However, they\u2019re clearly in the wrong for this. They can\u2019t just expel someone because she looked scary. She worked so hard to get into University.\u201d</p><br/><p>In the school\u2019s web forums.</p><br/><p>There were a lot of intense discussions.</p><br/><p>The students had been divided into two different groups. One group felt that the school was wrong while the other group supported their way of handling the situation.</p><br/><p>\u201cAll of you are idiots. Do you know that we\u2019d be frightened if she were to be in school? There was once when I saw her after eating breakfast and I immediately threw up.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c^, I agree. When I was having sex with someone, I was about to whip out my p*nis but someone sent me a photo of her. When I saw it, my p*nis got soft immediately. F*cking hell.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre all of you really receiving higher education? Can\u2019t you have some leniency? All of you are discriminating her.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, discrimination? If you\u2019re not like us, go get her to be your girlfriend.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, if she were to be his girlfriend, I think he wouldn\u2019t be able to fall asleep for the whole night. He would be having nightmares every day.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin\u2019s Weibo has already said that everyone that enrolled in this school is an idiot.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, who is he? So what if he is Master Lin? Does he really think that he is that awesome?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf he has the guts, ask him to come to the school and say that. We\u2019ll teach him a lesson.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNow that this matter has been blown up, the school will be affected since Master Lin is involved.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p></div>\n</div>"}

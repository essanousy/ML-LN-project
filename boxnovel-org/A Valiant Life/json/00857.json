They too were very satisfied with the outcome of this issue.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-1\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>They were very concerned about this issue as well as sympathetic towards Jin Shan Ping. They felt like it was a pity for her to do a good deed and get her face disfigured. Furthermore, she was being pushed aside by her schoolmates and being asked to drop out. In their eyes, this was really too disgusting.</p><br/><p>They did not have a very favorable opinion of this Jin He University.</p><br/><p>However, they were very happy that this issue had been resolved perfectly.</p><br/><p>The only thing is, some of the reporters were still wondering about one thing.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, may I ask, how are you preparing to help student Jin to restore her face? As far as we know, the disfiguration to her face is pretty serious. Even the hospitals with the best restoration plastic surgery cannot guarantee to restore her face.\u201d</p><br/><p>This question was one which was present in the minds of all of the reporters.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-2\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Lin Fan gave a very mysterious laugh and said, \u201cFor this question, I\u2019ll need a few days before I can answer you guys. Of course, I still can\u2019t guarantee 100% that I can do it, but the chances are pretty high. I don\u2019t want to say too much right now. When I\u2019m successful, then we can talk again.\u201d</p><br/><p>Another reporter rushed to ask, \u201cMaster Lin, one last question. How were those students that were protesting dealt with?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan hesitated for a moment. This question was a little complicated. He answered, \u201cRegarding this\u2026 It\u2019s not for me to say. We still have to see how Jin He University deals with it. However, as of right now, those rowdy students have been expelled.\u201d</p><br/><p>When the reporters heard this, there was immediate commotion. The all felt that having so many students expelled would definitely have a large impact.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, what do you think of this method of handling the issue?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cI think it\u2019s fair and reasonable and I think the school has done the right thing. In any case, I will just lift my hands and support them in what they do.\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporter said, \u201cMaster Lin, this method of handling the protesting students will definitely have a very large impact. It might even affect their future.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shook his head and said, \u201cMy dear reporter, actually, I don\u2019t really agree with what you said. These students have a huge deficiency in their moral character. They need to go back and thoroughly learn about how to improve their thinking and morals. If we let them walk out into society and go into the teaching industry or just a normal job, given their moral standings, it will definitely p*ss a lot of people off. Okay, that\u2019s enough questions, I need to rush home already.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan did not wait for the reporters to say anything and just immediately left.</p><br/><p>The reporters still had a lot of questions to ask but given the current situation, it seemed like they were not going to be able to ask anymore.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-3\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>They were filled with regret.</p><br/><p>However, the people were still inside the school. Thus, they were going to try and interview the people in the school and try to see if they knew anything else.</p><br/><p>In the car.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan felt like the reporters were really too crazy already. However, having reporters around was not a bad thing.</p><br/><p>Many issues only gain importance because these reporters exposed them to the world.</p><br/><p>Although there were times where he really loathed these reporters, overall, they were still pretty awesome.</p><br/><p>At Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan got back to his store, all the surrounding shop owners all rushed to gather around him.</p><br/><p>Elder Liang was very concerned about the issue and said, \u201cLittle Boss, how is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>They all knew about the issue already. They were all very invested in this situation and all did not know how it would turn out.</p><br/><p>Elder Zhang said, \u201cThese students are really too much. How could they do something like that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian furiously said, \u201cIf they were in front of me right now, I\u2019ll slap all of them. I\u2019ll have to slap all of them to death.\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-4\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>In the face of everyone all asking him questions at the same time, Lin Fan could not help laughing. He replied, \u201cOkay, it\u2019s fine already. The issue has been resolved.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan curiously asked, \u201cBrother Lin, how was it resolved?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled and said, \u201cFor this, I\u2019ll have to explain it from the start.\u201d</p><br/><p>Upon seeing how excited everyone was, he decided not to hide it anymore and just immediately told them everything.</p><br/><p>When everyone heard about what happened, one by one, their expressions showed them becoming more and more at ease.</p><br/><p>\u201cI told you already. As long as you are there to handle it, there is no issue that can\u2019t be resolved.\u201d It was a very rare piece of praise from Fraud Tian. Although he was already old in age, he was not old in his mind.</p><br/><p>He was still filled with righteousness.</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang smiled and said, \u201cFraud Tian is really not bad.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian glanced at him and said, \u201cHurry up and get out of here. I haven\u2019t really been keen on seeing you these past few days.\u201d</p><br/><p>Given the situation between the two of them, it appeared like something had happened. It was probably because the things that happened that night were not up to Fraud Tian\u2019s expectations.</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang laughed and said, \u201cFraud Tian, what kind of attitude is this? You don\u2019t know how to hit on girls and yet you are blaming me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian did not want to say much already. That night, he had poured out all his hard earned money and in the end, did not gain anything. It was like he was just there to pay for the meal and there was nothing else there which concerned him.</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha\u2026\u201d Lin Fan laughed.</p><br/><p>The next day.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-5\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>The news reports all came out.</p><br/><p>\u201cJin Shan Ping will continue to stay at the school. The protesting students have been expelled from the school.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUpon seeing something unjust, he went in to help out. Master Lin stepping up for justice and has caused a chain effect, with more people going to help. With people like this, may I ask, does society still need heroes around?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWith regards to the way Jin He University handled the protesting students, do you think they did the right thing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDirector Chen speaks up. Feels that this situation must be dealt with firmly and is absolutely unacceptable.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJin He University needs students with good moral characters and doesn\u2019t need the ones with bad moral character.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Various news headlines all came out.</p><br/><p>This caused a huge stir online.</p><br/><p>To the netizens, there were a lot of talking points for this issue.</p><br/><p>\u201c666\u2026 Jin He University has done beautifully.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI feel like it is Master Lin who has done beautifully. With his character, I will be a fan of his for my entire life.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not even kidding, when I saw this news last night, I was furious. I did not think that the outcome of it would come out today. I originally thought that it would drag on for a period of time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe way that these rowdy students have been dealt with is a little excessive. Expulsion is definitely not a joke and will affect the rest of their lives.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, you\u2019re still thinking about them? Then why didn\u2019t they think of others? They felt really good when they were chasing people out of the school. Let\u2019s see how they feel now that it\u2019s happened to them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good to hear, I really love these types of situations. Those ugly b*stards definitely deserve to be punished.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSociety doesn\u2019t need these kinds of students. They should go back and learn some morals before coming back to studying\u201d</p><br/><p>On Weibo.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan\u2019s Weibo had need bombarded by many netizens. They were all extremely satisfied with this outcome.</p><br/><p>They initially thought that Master Lin going over to the school to speak up for the girl was going to be useless. However, they never thought that things would turn out this way.</p><br/><p>This made everyone adore Master Lin even more.</p><br/><p>Especially the younger people, they loved Master Lin even more.</p><br/><p>He was really a hero in their hearts.</p><br/><p>In the face of such crazy fans, Lin Fan felt helpless. Being so popular was a bit of a punishment as well.</p><br/><p>At Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan came to his store, the people queuing up for the scallion pancakes all started clapping. They were all praising Lin Fan\u2019s actions.</p><br/><p>In the face of such thunderous applause, Lin Fan calmly laughed.</p><br/><p>Since it was like that, he just calmly accepted it.</p></div>\n</div>"}

Where did that retard come from? He actually questioned our decision and spoke so viciously to me. Alright then, since he doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s good for him, don\u2019t even think of getting a prize.\u201d Xiao Chen had been complete pissed off. He had never thought that there would be someone so impudent.</p><br/><p>However, as Xiao Chen was about to remove Lil\u2019 Fatty\u2019s name from the list, he stopped. Doing this would probably give the opposition something to use against them. He had been overwhelmed with rage before but he couldn\u2019t do something so stupid. After all, if he suddenly removed Lil\u2019 Fatty\u2019s name from the second prize, there would definitely be problems and he would end up losing out.</p><br/><p>\u201cForget it, I\u2019ll let you go this time. Take the second prize then. There\u2019s no way you can take the first.\u201d Xiao Chen decided to forget about this matter.</p><br/><p>Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian was furious. \u201cThis guy is too arrogant. What did he mean by what he said? If he dares to remove Lil\u2019 Fatty\u2019s name, I\u2019ll go over to Beijing and show him the meaning of power.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan saw that Brother Lin had an unpleasant look on his face. She pulled on his sleeve and comforted him, \u201cDon\u2019t be angry, Brother Lin.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled, \u201cDo I look like the type of person to get angry? I\u2019m a very big-hearted person.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Lin, I know that you\u2019re very angry. Don\u2019t force yourself. I can see that your body is trembling. Even I am very angry. These people from the Chinese Arts Association are too shameless.\u201d Wu You Lan felt injustice for Brother Lin as well as the children.</p><br/><p>A fair and proper competition had turned into this.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, go back, everyone. Do whatever you should be doing,\u201d said Lin Fan calmly.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian said in disbelief, \u201cYou\u2019re just going to leave it like this, kid?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cDo I look like the kind of person who would just let it be?\u201d</p><br/><p>In the shop.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan sat there using his phone, not saying a single word. Wu You Lan knew that Brother Lin was in a very bad mood. And she knew that he was definitely doing something.</p><br/><p>Indeed\u2026</p><br/><p>Her phone rang.</p><br/><p>It was a notification from Weibo. She only followed Lin Fan\u2019s Weibo. Whenever Brother Lin posted something, she would be notified.</p><br/><p>When she opened her Weibo and saw the content, Wu You Lan was taken aback. She couldn\u2019t quite understand what was going on.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan: I\u2019m very happy today. 365 children from Nanshan Children\u2019s Welfare Institute participated in the Youth Chinese Arts Cup and all of them have won awards. On such a day, I am very excited.</p><br/><p>The netizens were in an uproar.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? What Youth Chinese Arts Cup?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t quite understand but why do I feel like this is amazing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c^you\u2019re right. 365 children all won awards, don\u2019t you think that\u2019s scary?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAs long as it\u2019s something related to Master Lin, we will show our full support. How are the standards of the children\u2019s Chinese arts? Have there been improvements in the past couple of months?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, there\u2019s a link attached. Let\u2019s hurry and take a look.\u201d</p><br/><p>The netizens all rushed to click on the link. With Lin Fan\u2019s current number of fans, when he sent this post out, the number of reposts reached several hundred thousands. There were many Internet celebrities who wanted to improve their relationships with Lin Fan, so they reposted his post as well.</p><br/><p>At the Chinese Arts Association, the workers in charge of managing their website started crying out in the shop.</p><br/><p>\u201cQuick! Come take a look. Hundreds of thousands of people suddenly visited our website.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh f*ck! It\u2019s starting to crash. What on earth is going on? Why are so many people visiting our website?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn the past, the highest amount of traffic we\u2019ve gotten was around ten thousand. Now, it\u2019s like seeing a ghost. Why are there so many people?\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, a number of comments appeared in the website\u2019s comments section.</p><br/><p>\u201cAwesome. Look at the second prize, third prize, and the merit awards. They\u2019re all from Shanghai. And aren\u2019t they all from Nanshan Children\u2019s Welfare Institute?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah! That\u2019s amazing! And look at those artworks. These children have all improved. There\u2019s a huge improvement from last time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s scary. It\u2019s amazing!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The Internet workers cried out in shock, \u201cF*ck, where did all these people come from? For our Youth Chinese Arts Cup to attract so much traffic, that\u2019s too scary, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><br/><p>To them, this was simply beyond their imaginations. Since the establishment of their website, they had never received so much traffic before.</p><br/><p>Simply astounding.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan looked at Lin Fan, wondering what his intention was by making such a move. Could it be that he had admitted defeat and didn\u2019t want to say anymore?</p><br/><p>However, judging by Brother Lin\u2019s personality, that was simply not possible. Brother Lin was the type of person that would never let his own people lose out. Especially in the face of such injustice, he would fight until the end.</p><br/><p>Suddenly!</p><br/><p>Another Weibo notification came.</p><br/><p>When she saw Brother Lin\u2019s Weibo post, Wu You Lan instantly smiled. Brother Lin had begun to make his move.</p><br/><p>Two pieces of drawings.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan: Everyone, please tell me, out of these two drawings, which one looks better? Those who think the drawing of water is better, vote 1. Those who think that the drawing of flowers and birds is better, vote two.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c1\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c1\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cEven though I don\u2019t understand Chinese arts, anyone who\u2019s not blind can tell that the water drawing looks better.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve learned Chinese arts for a period of time before in the past. Although the lines drawn in the water drawing aren\u2019t that beautiful, the drawing feels unique. It is very ingenious. As for this drawing of flowers and birds, it\u2019s not that great. The lines aren\u2019t the best and it doesn\u2019t give that dazzling feeling.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn! Well said.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Lin Fan saw that it was about time and sent yet another Weibo post.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs you all have seen, the drawing of water is superior but it\u2019s a shame because this superior drawing only won the second prize. Meanwhile, this drawing of birds and flowers won first prize. I feel that such corrupted judging must be exposed. Could it be that all those teachers from the Chinese Arts Association who assessed this are all blind? They can\u2019t even tell good from bad. If the Chinese Arts Association is made up of this kind of people, I suggest that it be disbanded to save it from misleading the younger generation and shaming our Chinese culture.\u201d</p><br/><p>When this post appeared, the people who were eating their melon seeds and spectating understood.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck. I see now. Master Lin is disputing against the unfairness of the Chinese Arts Association.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is corruption?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you even need to use a question mark? If it\u2019s like this, it is definitely corruption. I just went to see the website. The drawing of water had indeed gotten the second prize and that drawing of birds and flowers has indeed gotten first prize. This artwork that was awarded the first prize is about the same as some of those that were awarded the second prize. What helped it receive the first prize?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCorruption. This is clearly corruption.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian said excitedly, \u201cBeautifully done, kid. This kind of unfairness should be exposed. But aren\u2019t you a member of the Chinese Arts Association? Will there be a problem if you scold them like that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled, \u201cSo what if I\u2019m from the Chinese Arts Association? This corruption has affected me directly, how could I stand it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAwesome.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Chen had been in front of the computer the whole time, receiving calls. He was in charge of this matter and many investors had called asking if he could organize another Adult Chinese Arts Cup. However, he rejected them all.</p><br/><p>This matter had to be taken slowly.</p><br/><p>Suddenly!</p><br/><p>An employee rushed hastily into the room. He said with an anxious look on his face, \u201cIt\u2019s bad, Director Chen. Something has happened. There are people saying that we were corrupted in the organization of the Youth Cup. We\u2019ve been exposed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Xiao Chen was startled. Then, he thought for a moment. \u201cF*ck, it must be that guy\u2019s doing.\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

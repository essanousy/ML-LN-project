There were a number of townsfolk who stopped in their tracks. To their surprise, there seemed to be celebrities in his shop.</p><br/><p>Some of the townsfolk went forward to take a look. They knew that this Master Lin was not an average person. In fact, he was a godly being. In the beginning, when the shops had just moved in, they hadn't known what Master Lin did. Eventually, after interacting with each other over this period of time, they realized that this Master Lin was not a simple man. Especially after doing an online search for him, the townsfolk gasped in shock. He was simply a f*cking awesome individual of this generation.</p><br/><p>Gradually, the townsfolk gathered and stood at the shop entrance. Why does that person wearing a mask look like a celebrity? Huh? That can't be right. Isn't that the famous female singer, Song Xiao Wan?</p><br/><p>Just as they were about to scream out emotionally and ask for autographs, they suddenly calmed down.</p><br/><p>In the shop.</p><br/><p>That superstar, Song Xiao Wan, was courteously sitting there. Although she was wearing a mask and her full face couldn't be seen, one could sense that this superstar was looking at Master Lin with a big smile.</p><br/><p>Then, the townsfolk looked at each other and nodded. They were fanboys of Master Lin. Especially in such a setting, they couldn't present themselves as uncivilized people. That would be embarrassing for Master Lin.</p><br/><p>\"Master Lin, why is it so lively today? What's going on?\"</p><br/><p>\"What do you mean 'lively today'? When is the Master Lin shop ever not lively?\"</p><br/><p>\"Right, right, that's my mistake.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the crowd and smiled. \"It's nothing much. I've been rather awesome at writing songs lately, so a celebrity wants me to write a song for her.\"</p><br/><p>One of the townsfolk said, \"Ah, celebrity? What celebrity? We haven't seen her yet.\"</p><br/><p>At that moment, everyone in the shop who had come to get songs was smiling brightly. They were all leaders of their respective recording companies. If it was a normal composer, they wouldn't have cared. If it was a composer who could write one or two classics, they might have given a nod. But this person in front of them was a super master, by whom every song written was a classic.</p><br/><p>Before coming to Cloud Street, they had assessed that whichever company managed to invite Master Lin, regardless of whether they had a superstar or a new singer, as long as their voice was not too bad, they would be able to succeed. In fact, that company's song would go viral.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled and said, \"Since you're all here, remove your masks and let my guests take a look. It's no big deal. Don't worry, my customers are all peaceful. They don't chase celebrities.\"</p><br/><p>All the company leaders that had brought celebrities with them told the celebrities to take off their masks. Master Lin had spoken, how could they not abide?</p><br/><p>When the celebrities took off their masks, a commotion started among the townsfolk.</p><br/><p>\"Hey, she looks even better in real life than on television.\"</p><br/><p>\"Song Xiao Wan is really beautiful. I never thought I would be able to see her in person.\"</p><br/><p>The townsfolk took out their phones and started taking pictures. They were delighted. They had never thought that they would come across such a great thing at Master Lin's shop. It was wonderful.</p><br/><p>At that moment, at the Cloud Street entrance.</p><br/><p>A car stopped.</p><br/><p>\"Sister Cai, this is where Master Lin runs his shop,\" said the manager.</p><br/><p>Cai Ya Ting took a look and said, \"I don't know if I will succeed this time. If I successfully get a song from him, that would really be great.\"</p><br/><p>The manager said, \"That's hard to say. Talented people have strange tempers.\"</p><br/><p>Cai Ya Ting had come with his manager and a leader from the recording company. But when she reached the shop entrance, she was shocked. She had never thought that there would be so many people in the shop. Moreover, she recognized quite a number of them. They were all from other recording companies.</p><br/><p>When Cai Ya Ting reached the place, she raised a few eyebrows as well. After all, although Cai Ya Ting's status in the musical world wasn't as high as Ying Jin's, she was still considered to be at the peak of the industry. Although her fame hadn't been as great in the recent years and she hadn't had a very successful song in a while, she was still a respected big sister.</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang was broadcasting and of course, he was f*cking excited.</p><br/><p>The viewers in the broadcast room were burning up as well.</p><br/><p>\"D*mn, after so many years, I've never seen this many celebrities gathered together in my life.\"</p><br/><p>\"Master Lin is really incredible. I wonder what kind of brain he has. Regardless, he actually knows how to write songs. His talent is nature-defying.\"</p><br/><p>\"Haha, just thinking about it feels great. These celebrities are all here to invite him to write songs for them.\"</p><br/><p>\"Sending gifts!\"</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan saw this scene, he started laughing as well. \"You're all here to request for songs, right?\"</p><br/><p>Everyone nodded. They were definitely there to request for songs. Why else would they be there?</p><br/><p>When Cai Ya Ting saw Master Lin, she was a little startled. She felt that this Master Lin was way too young. However, a person couldn't be judged by appearance. She didn't underestimate him. She said courteously, \"Nice to meet you, Master Lin. I'm Cai Ya Ting. Your talent is really shocking. I'm here today to\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Before Cai Ya Ting could finish, Lin Fan waved his hand and interrupted, \"Alright, enough of these formalities. Although you all know me, I don't know you. Writing songs for you is, of course, possible but I have conditions.\"</p><br/><p>\"Those second-rate and above, raise your hands.\"</p><br/><p>The crowd didn't understand Master Lin's intentions, but they raised their hands accordingly.</p><br/><p>\"Those who can do a concert this year, raise your hands.\"</p><br/><p>The number of hands dropped by half.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded. Then, he took out his phone and gave Wang Ming Yang a call. \"Hello. Bring Wu Huan Yue to my shop quickly.\"</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang's mood was terrific. Although he didn't know what his brother wanted, he hurriedly went to bring Wu Huan Yue over.</p><br/><p>Everyone was waiting and Lin Fan didn't say a word. The people who had come to request songs didn't speak either. They all waited because Master Lin's talent was too shocking.</p><br/><p>One album, ten songs, and every one of them was of premium quality. Moreover, out of these, four of the songs were above premium. They belonged to the category of songs which only appeared once in a few years.</p><br/><p>Even people who didn't understand music would get immersed in the songs. And to people who did understand music, these songs were simply too perfect.</p><br/><p>No matter what, as long as they could get Master Lin to personally write a song for them, they would have a real profit.</p><br/><p>What does a classic represent? It represents timelessness. Whether it's five years, ten years or even a hundred years later, people would never get sick of it.</p><br/><p>Not long after, Wang Ming Yang arrived with Wu Huan Yue.</p><br/><p>When he saw the scene, Wang Ming Yang was startled. What the heck was going on? A gathering of singers? But after some thinking, he figured it out. These people were all here to request songs.</p><br/><p>When the people saw Wang Ming Yang, they were surprised as well. Then, they courteously nodded at him. Wang Ming Yang's status was much greater than theirs.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, when some of the celebrities saw Wu Huan Yue, they were filled with envy and jealousy. They were all thinking why hadn't they gotten those classics instead. Just thinking about it made them want to cry.</p><br/><p>\"Sit down first, then we'll talk, said Lin Fan. Then, he looked at the crowd, \"You all want to request songs. That isn't a difficult thing. My request is simple, as long as you fulfill it. This year, you will organize concerts and I will give you songs. I don't need your money as long as you give her ten minutes of singing time during your concerts. Those who agree, stay. Those who don't can leave. If you don't have concerts this year but you will have a concert next year, come back next year to request a song. How's that?\"</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan said these words, Wang Ming Yang was stunned. Needless to say, Wu Huan Yue was stunned too. She covered her mouth in disbelief.</p><br/><p>To Lin Fan, he had too many songs that made his brain feel like exploding. His aim was for the stars and the seas. These songs didn't matter to him.</p><br/><p>...</p><br/>\n</div>"}

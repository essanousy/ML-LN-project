He was very curious, wondering what his teacher was concocting.</p><br/><p>He also did not know how much progress he had made.</p><br/><p>He had a feeling that his teacher has researched something that no one else has even dared to think about.</p><br/><p>The curiosity weighed heavily on his heart but he refused to seek a peek. His teacher had already told him that he did not want any distractions. Thus, he naturally did not want to do something that would upset his teacher.</p><br/><p>Before he met his teacher, he was just an old doctor who was trying to push the concept of Chinese medicine. Although he had risen to a high position as the director of the university, his strength and energy were limited and he could not make much headway.</p><br/><p>But right now, because of his teacher, his mental capacity had been increased and he had a better understanding of Chinese medicine. He could finally go out and do what he wanted to.</p><br/><p>He was especially grateful for his teacher\u2019s help in Chinese medicine.</p><br/><p>The prescription for anorexia that they came up with in the past was all from his teacher\u2019s research. However, his teacher actually allowed him to handle all the money that could be gained from the patent and let him invest it into the Chinese medicine industry.</p><br/><p>His assistance in the field of Chinese medicine allowed some young people who like or have an interest in Chinese medicine to have apprehensions in studying it. It had a massive impact on the profession of Chinese medicine.</p><br/><p>After waiting outside for a long time.</p><br/><p>Noises would come from the inside from time to time. In his heart, Zhao Ming Qing kept praying that his teacher\u2019s work would be a success.</p><br/><p>\u201cMing Qing, quickly come in.\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, Zhao Ming Qing heard his teacher\u2019s voice and without missing a beat, rushed inside.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, what is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, he saw the smile on his teacher\u2019s face. He immediately knew that his teacher had succeeded.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was a little excited.</p><br/><p>He never thought that his luck would be so good, to actually be able to successfully concoct it and with a pretty high success rate. It was a huge difference from when he was concocting the \u2018Little Intelligence Pill\u2019.</p><br/><p>When he was concocting the Little Intelligence Pill, the probability of concocting a perfect one was very low. If he could make it perfectly once in every ten tries, it would already be a success.</p><br/><p>However, with this round of concocting, the success rate had risen to about 50%. Basically, he just had to concoct it twice then he would be able to obtain a perfect product.</p><br/><p>The success rate was a little scary.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing looked at the pills in his teacher\u2019s hand and curiously asked, \u201cTeacher, what pills are those?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the pills. Then, he let out a smile on his face, a smile that was shining really brightly. Although it was just a low-end pill in today\u2019s age, it was still a godly pill that was hard for people to imagine could exist.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is the Mental Performance Enhancing Pill. When you\u2019re tired, just pop a pill and your mental state will be back to 100%.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Insect Repellant Pill. Just take one pill and you can avoid getting bitten by mosquitoes for a whole day.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Lin Fan slowly introduced all the pills and their uses to Zhao Ming Qing.</p><br/><p>Although in Lin Fan\u2019s eyes, these pills were of little value, in Zhao Ming Qing\u2019s eyes, these pills were amazing.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, you were actually able to research all these pills. It\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s,\u201d Zhao Ming Qing was stunned.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cMing Qing, these are very ordinary. Actually, I\u2019m still lacking some ingredients, if not I would be able to some even better pills.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, teacher, this is already amazing,\u201d Zhao Ming Qing said. \u201cThe Mental Performance Enhancing Pill will be indispensable to staff members working very intense jobs. Also, the Insect Repelling Pill has so many clever uses. If we were to market these, they will definitely be very welcomed\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing became more and more worked up as he spoke. Especially when he was talking about the other pills as they made him even more shocked. He had never thought that such pills could even exist.</p><br/><p>If it was not concocted by his teacher, he would not even dare to believe that they were real.</p><br/><p>In the face of Ming Qing\u2019s shock, Lin Fan was trying to think about how to handle the task. He was wondering how he could accomplish this task.</p><br/><p>For the time being, he still could not think of a way.</p><br/><p>The medicinal ingredients had been finished and the rewards from them were very abundant.</p><br/><p>For the time being, Lin Fan did not want to concoct any more pills. He wanted to wait till he found the most crucial part of completing his task before concocting more.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing said, \u201cTeacher, are you still going to concoct more tomorrow?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shook his head and said, \u201cNot tomorrow. I\u2019m preparing to go for a trip to the Northeast. It\u2019ll be awhile before I\u2019m back.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Northeast?\u201d Zhao Ming Qing was stunned. \u201cTeacher, what are you going to the Northeast for?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled and said, \u201cI\u2019m going there to meet someone and settle some issues. However, it\u2019s not a very big problem.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing did not say much after that but he knew that when his teacher said that it was not a big problem, it was definitely a big problem.</p><br/><p>The next day!</p><br/><p>At the airport.</p><br/><p>He was walking in a hurry and did not take note of anyone else.</p><br/><p>At Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian saw that Lin Fan had not returned yet and sense that something was off.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou Lan, since the brat hasn\u2019t come back yet, do you think that he has gone missing again?\u201d Fraud Tian glanced at the time and realized it was already 8.30am. There were already people rushing here to queue up at the shop.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan replied, \u201cHe shouldn\u2019t be. Brother Lin hasn\u2019t mentioned about being busy with anything recently.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut he still has not returned at this hour? Also, where has the Elder Dog gone to? I haven\u2019t seen him all morning,\u201d Fraud Tian asked with a lot of suspicions.</p><br/><p>As the townsfolk were all queuing up.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat time is Little Boss coming?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, it\u2019s already so late. He usually opens much earlier.\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly.</p><br/><p>One of the townsfolk shouted from within the crowd</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck, Little Boss has gone to the airport.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCheck your Weibo.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian was dumbfounded. He rushed to open his phone and check Weibo.</p><br/><p>When he saw his Weibo, he felt like killing himself.</p><br/><p>There was a picture posted. Inside it was Lin Fan and the Elder Dog together. Furthermore, he had a huge smile on his face.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m heading to the Northeast. My fans in the Northeast do you guys welcome me?\u201d</p><br/><p>This post on Weibo was posted at 8 am. The brat was probably on the plane by now.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck, this brat has just left his shop behind,\u201d Fraud Tian was already speechless. He was wondering if this situation was the same as before.</p><br/><p>Right now, there were more and more townsfolk waiting. If they were to rebel, no one would be able to stop them.</p><br/><p>At the airport.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Dog, listen up. Hurry up and get in. If you don\u2019t get in, I won\u2019t bring you for this holiday anymore,\u201d Lin Fan hugged the Elder Dog and said.</p><br/><p>In the face of that cage, the Elder Dog was insistent on not going in, wanting to board the plane with Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>However, this plane was not something it could just get onto if it wanted to.</p><br/><p>In the end, after using a huge amount of effort, he managed to push the dog into the cage.</p><br/><p>Then, he opened his Weibo and took a look.</p><br/><p>There was a decent amount of discussion going on.</p><br/><p>\u201cWelcome Master Lin to the Northeast.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWow, Master Lin, what are you coming to the Northeast for?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have the same question.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the discussions and could not help smiling.</p><br/><p>The real master was coming and he did not know if Godfather Liu knew about it or not. It made him feel a little eager inside.</p><br/><p>At the Northeast.</p><br/><p>\u201cGodfather Liu, that b*stard is coming to the Northeast,\u201d one of his underlings was closely watching Lin Fan\u2019s Weibo and when he saw the news, rushed to report it to Godfather Liu.</p><br/><p>In his eyes, if this b*stard could make Godfather Liu so furious, he must be very talented.</p><br/><p>They were obviously in awe of him.</p><br/><p>When Godfather Liu heard that Lin Fan was coming, he let out a sneer.</p><br/><p>Good little brat. He is actually personally sending himself to me. I can\u2019t be upset with that.</p><br/><p>\u201cGo to the airport and wait for that brat.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGot it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p></div>\n</div>"}

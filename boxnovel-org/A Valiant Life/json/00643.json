After consuming the Little Intelligence pill, the abilities of these kids had improved significantly.</p><br/><p>When he first arrived, those kids have left. It was a pity that he didn\u2019t manage to see them.</p><br/><p>The educational level was currently being renovated. The kids were mainly learning how to draw and listening to Grandpa Zhao\u2019s stories about Chinese medicine. They always listened to his stories attentively.</p><br/><p>Director Huang said, \u201cMaster Lin, what are you doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan passed a form to Director Huang, \u201cI saw that there was a Youth Chinese Arts Cup. I wanted to bring these kids to participate in it so that they can improve themselves.\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Huang smiled, \u201cThat\u2019s a good thing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled and nodded, \u201cOf course. If not, I wouldn\u2019t have registered them for it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, Lil\u2019 Fatty rushed over and held Lin Fan\u2019s hand. \u201cUncle Lin, come and look at my artwork. I was really serious about drawing it today.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan patted Lil\u2019 Fatty\u2019s head and went to the table. When he saw the artwork on the table, he gasped, \u201cWow, Lil\u2019 Fatty, your artistic skills have improved so much!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan didn\u2019t just say that to motivate Lil\u2019 Fatty. He really drew well. It was as if he had been learning for a few years.</p><br/><p>Lil\u2019 Fatty had only been drawing for a short period of time and he produced such a good artwork. It was pretty scary.</p><br/><p>The Little Intelligence pill played a part and perhaps Lil\u2019 Fatty was really talented in drawing.</p><br/><p>Director Huang smiled, \u201cMaster Lin, Lil\u2019 Fatty is really good at drawing. When we saw it, we were shocked too.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled and nodded, \u201cYeah, Lil\u2019 Fatty is good. He needs to develop it further.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lil\u2019 Fatty chuckled. It felt great to be praised. Then, he followed another female student and went to play.</p><br/><p>Those workers that came to register the kids were also stunned at their artworks.</p><br/><p>They believed that the kids were only five or six years old, with the oldest being about eight years old. However, their artworks were absolutely stunning. It was unbelievable.</p><br/><p>Some of the parents that registered their children also brought their artworks along. However, they had never seen any of such quality before.</p><br/><p>It had to be said that only a handful of kids could match up to the standard of these children\u2019s artworks.</p><br/><p>How did he manage to teach all of them? It was unimaginable.</p><br/><p>Of course, with Lin Fan\u2019s gift in drawing, their artworks couldn\u2019t have been that bad.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cSorry for the trouble. There are a quite a number of kids here. You would need some time for this. I\u2019ll go get the money now and pay for their registration.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, they continued working till nighttime. The registration was finally over.</p><br/><p>In the end, Lin Fan gave them a total of $18,000 for the registration fees.</p><br/><p>An employee said, \u201cMaster Lin, the competition will be in three days\u2019 time. 9 am in the morning at the Citizens\u2019 Park. We will be sending the competition documents here tomorrow.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded, \u201cSorry to trouble all of you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. It\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><br/><p>Outside.</p><br/><p>The workers drove back to their workplace, \u201cD*mn, that was unbelievable. The children at the welfare organization draw really well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, they\u2019re so young and they\u2019re so good at drawing. If I didn\u2019t see it with my own eyes, I wouldn\u2019t have believed it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go back now. We have to work overtime today to prepare their documents.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>At the welfare organization.</p><br/><p>Lil\u2019 Fatty said, \u201cUncle Lin, why did they record our names?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled, \u201cI registered all of you for the Youth Chinese Arts Cup. You will be going for the competition in three days\u2019 time. All of you have to take it seriously and get a good placing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lil\u2019 Fatty nodded, \u201cYes, I will work hard and clinch the top spot.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled, \u201cHaha, all the best. I am confident in your ability. Don\u2019t be too nervous, it doesn\u2019t really matter if you don\u2019t win a price. What matters is that all of you are happy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lil\u2019 Fatty replied, \u201cI am very happy but I want to get the first place. My drawing will not lose to others.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA confident Lil\u2019 Fatty is the most charismatic.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan left the welfare organization, it was pretty late already.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Three days later.</p><br/><p>At the Citizens\u2019 Park.</p><br/><p>A few buses were parked outside.</p><br/><p>This time, the entire welfare organization was in action. There were a lot of people and it was impossible to take care of all the children. Hence, Lin Fan asked the shop owners of Cloud Street to take a half day off work to help to manage the crowd. After all, there were a lot of strangers and the kids might be abducted.</p><br/><p>There were police officers present to ensure that everything ran smoothly because there were going to be a lot of kids and they had to be cautious of the situation there.</p><br/><p>When the buses stopped, some adults looked over.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, where are these kids from? Why are there so many of them? Are they here to draw too?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThese kids are from the welfare organization.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, even the orphans are here for the competition. They can\u2019t even afford food for themselves. How can they be here? Look at that one there, he\u2019s in a wheelchair. Isn\u2019t it a joke?\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly, the middle-aged man turned to stare at the female teenager.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did you say? These kids are from Nanshan Children\u2019s Welfare Organisation. They\u2019re saved from the hands of the human traffickers. Why are you so evil? Can\u2019t you speak nicely of them?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? I was just saying.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you dare, say it again. I\u2019ll beat you up.\u201d</p><br/><p>The female teenager immediately shut up after seeing the fearsome look of the middle-aged man.</p><br/><p>The kids were wearing red costumes and they were being ushered around by the shop owners. Lin Fan got people to make the costumes specially for them. The shade of red was stunning and could be easily spotted.</p><br/><p>Lil\u2019 Fatty was being brought around by Lin Fan. \u201cUncle Lin, I will definitely do my best.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled, \u201cYeah, all the best. Give it your best shot. Don\u2019t be too nervous.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lil\u2019 Fatty smiled and nodded, \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan said, \u201cBrother Lin, there are really a lot of children here today.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cYeah, the parents are really focused on developing their kids\u2019 interests. Furthermore, Chinese Arts is a national treasure. A lot of kids learn it. However, only a handful pursue it passionately. I wonder how many of our kids in the welfare organization can win prizes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan sneakily went beside Lin Fan and whispered, \u201cBrother Lin, you said that it doesn\u2019t matter if they win anything. But you really want them to win something to prove themselves, right? After all, some people think that the children from the welfare organization are pathetic. You want to change their opinions, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan gently patted Wu You Lan\u2019s head, \u201cYou\u2019re pretty smart. This can be done through Chinese Arts. However, there\u2019s a long way to go. They have to continue working hard.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, Lin Fan shouted with a megaphone, \u201cTo all the little warriors of Nanshan Children\u2019s Welfare Organisation, all the best! Give it your best shot. Good luck!\u201d</p><br/><p>The kids in red costumes held each other\u2019s hands tightly, \u201cUncle Lin, we will do our best!\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, Lin Fan smiled. At the same time, he wanted to let these kids be more confident in themselves. The main purpose of the welfare organization was to develop their confidence.</p><br/><p>The reporters saw what had happened.</p><br/><p>Then, they ran over to begin their interviews.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, Master Lin\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, did you bring the children here to participate in the Youth Chinese Arts Cup?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded, \u201cYeah, I brought all 365 children from the organization to attend this competition.\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporter added, \u201cDo you think they\u2019ll win prizes?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled, \u201cI believe in them. They\u2019ll definitely do their best. Even if they don\u2019t win anything, they\u2019re still the best children in my eyes.\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporters looked at Lin Fan\u2019s smile and were speechless.</p><br/><p>They felt that although Master Lin was pretty stupid at times, he was also pretty charismatic.</p></div>\n</div>"}

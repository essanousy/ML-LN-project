He is probably tacitly accepting this matter.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Where has the Master Lin of our hearts gone?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018I maintain neutrality on this matter. I believe that the truth has yet to come out.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Corruption takes place, causing disappointment and anguish. Master Lin has fallen from grace.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, what did I tell you? You all have seen it now, haven\u2019t you? That\u2019s the truth. That Lin doesn\u2019t even know what to say anymore.\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-2\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, this is corruption. It\u2019s plain corruption. He\u2019s speechless before the reporters. He probably doesn\u2019t even know what to reply.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf anyone still wants to try and clear his name, go ahead and try. I want to see what you still have to say.\u201d</p><br/><p>The fans of Master Lin were all on Weibo. They really wanted to find out what on earth had happened. They didn\u2019t believe that it was as the reporters had said.</p><br/><p>How could the Master Lin that they knew do something like that? It was impossible. Completely impossible.</p><br/><p>Then, even more controversial news came out.</p><br/><p>Most of the people who had failed to get chosen had stepped out and started complaining on their own Weibo. Every one of them was angry about the unfairness that they faced.</p><br/><p>It was as if they were whining to everyone about the suffering that they had to endure.</p><br/><p>They were hoping to get sympathy so that others would help them demand justice.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-3\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>And what they were doing really was effective. When those netizens saw the situation, they were enraged. They felt that it was ridiculous.</p><br/><p>This was clearly a case of bullying.</p><br/><p>Especially because it had happened during an ordinary interview, it resonated with them. Hence, they started condemning Lin Fan, hoping for an explanation.</p><br/><p>This matter instantly caused carnage on the Internet.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, those people that had gotten hired had happily shared the news with their friends and on Weibo, hoping that they would get congratulated.</p><br/><p>But now that this had happened, a number of people got called out.</p><br/><p>Jiang Hui was one of those people. Her Weibo had had several hundred followers initially, but overnight, it rose to tens of thousands. Of course, these people were all here to flame her.</p><br/><p>Her status posts used to only have over ten replies but today, there were over ten thousand comments.</p><br/><p>But these comments weren\u2019t congratulatory ones. They were all cursing her.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour application was successful because you paid for it, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-4\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cHow was the service? Did it feel good?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGetting hired wasn\u2019t easy, was it? Your body must be tired.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSlut, don\u2019t you know what fairness is?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, you even took a selfie. You don\u2019t even look that good, why did you even get hired?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNeedless to say, she must have the skills. After all, when the lights go out, her face doesn\u2019t matter anymore. Skills are the most important.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Hui had been doing her preparations the past two days. She felt like she wouldn\u2019t be worthy of the job if she did not work hard.</p><br/><p>She already knew that she would be teaching six and seven-year-old children. They were still considered infants, so she would need a suitable teaching method.</p><br/><p>Hence, she had gathered a lot of information and enriched herself to prepare for the upcoming challenge.</p><br/><p>Her work was quite tiring. However, when she wanted to go on Weibo to update her status, she realized that her number of followers had increased tremendously.</p><br/><p>And the number of comments on her previous post was over twenty thousand.</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t know what was going on at all. When she clicked on the comments, she was completely dumbfounded. She couldn\u2019t believe it.</p><br/><p>All kinds of insults and curses in the comments made her stupefied. Slowly, tears began to well up in her eyes. She didn\u2019t even know where these people were from and why they were doing this.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-5\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at Weibo and frowned. He hadn\u2019t expected that the matter wouldn\u2019t subside as a result of his silence, but instead, it strangely kept gaining more attention.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Lin, it\u2019s bad!\u201d Zhao Zhong Yang cried out in surprise. He had a sullen look on his face. It seemed that he was angry.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d asked Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang immediately handed over his phone. \u201cBrother Lin, look at all this. Those people who failed to get chosen have all stepped out and started complaining about the incident. They\u2019re drawing sympathy from the netizens and even implicating those teachers that we have hired. Now, people are hurling insults at them on their Weibo. This is getting out of control.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was startled. Then, he started to get angry. \u201cWhat the heck are they trying to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t explain the situation because I didn\u2019t want them to get harmed but now, they\u2019re all coming out one by one and portraying themselves as victims. They\u2019re even causing trouble for others. That\u2019s f*cking disgusting.\u201d</p><br/><p>He really couldn\u2019t understand what these people were thinking anymore. Did they really think they were being wronged?</p><br/><p>Moreover, they were coming out and trying to tell reporters how pitiful they were.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-6\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>It was really ridiculous. Without hesitation, Lin Fan stood up.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere are you going, Brother Lin?\u201d asked Zhao Zhong Yang.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan couldn\u2019t sit still anymore. It was all because he had been too kind to them that they kept on taking it for granted.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere else would I go? I\u2019m going to the Welfare Institute to get the video. I didn\u2019t want to hurt them initially but now that things have turned out like this, I won\u2019t waste time arguing with them anymore. They brought this upon themselves,\u201d Lin Fan said resentfully.</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang said, \u201cBrother Lin, I\u2019ll go with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Those people who had failed to get chosen had been upset from the start, especially those who had high qualifications. They didn\u2019t know why they hadn\u2019t been chosen and since it had turned out that way, they wanted to get back at the rest.</p><br/><p>And some of them actually quite liked the attention that they were getting, so they all decided to step out.</p><br/><p>They just said whatever there was to say. Everyone else was doing the same anyway.</p><br/><p>Nanshan Children\u2019s Welfare Institute.</p><br/><p>Han Lu had been observing the news on the Internet all this while. When the new had been released, he felt that something wasn\u2019t right.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-7\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>But since Master Lin hadn\u2019t said anything, it wasn\u2019t right for him to say anything.</p><br/><p>But now, the way things were developing was getting worse and worse. He felt that if they didn\u2019t let the truth out, many innocent people would get harmed.</p><br/><p>\u201cHan Lu\u2026\u201d At that moment, Lin Fan and Zhao Zhong Yang arrived in a hurry.</p><br/><p>When Han Lu saw them, he started saying, \u201cMaster Lin, this incident\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved his hand to interrupt. \u201cNo need to say anything. Give me a copy of the video. I was wrong about this matter from the start. I shouldn\u2019t have tried to hide it. Now that things have come to this, I am largely responsible for it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, don\u2019t say that. You just didn\u2019t want those people to get criticized. No one would\u2019ve expected them to act so thoughtlessly and even cause harm to others. That\u2019s unforgivable,\u201d said Han Lu.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan didn\u2019t say anything else. He immediately started copying the video.</p><br/><p>Then, he opened Weibo and uploaded the video. After a moment of pondering, he typed a caption before finally posting it.</p></div>\n</div>"}

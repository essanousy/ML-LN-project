Once there was any movement from his fishing line, he would immediately lift up the rod and retrieve the item before placing it in his bag.</p><br/><p>Several days and nights had passed and he had stayed in the same position. After unlocking the Wuxia major class of knowledge, he had already surpassed the limits of an average person. Not drinking or eating didn\u2019t pose much of an obstacle to him.</p><br/><p>To him, there was already not much time left.</p><br/><p>When he had just started, he had had sufficient confidence in himself. He had felt that he would easily obtain what he wanted. But after so long, he just couldn\u2019t fish up the remaining few herbs.</p><br/><p>*Ding ding*</p><br/><p>Lin Fan took out his phone and was about to reject the call but when he saw the caller, he answered it.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-2\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cElder Zheng, what is it?\u201d asked Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>\u201cSomeone asked me to ask for your help in seeing a patient. His illness is quite severe and he might not last much longer, so I wanted to ask for your help,\u201d said Elder Zheng.</p><br/><p>To make Elder Zheng speak on his behalf, that person must not have been average. He might even be a person that was out of Lin Fan\u2019s reach.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have the time. I\u2019m very busy now,\u201d said Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Elder Zheng became anxious. \u201cNo, Elder Lin, this is serious.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Zheng, it\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want to help you. I am very serious now too. This matter that I\u2019m handling right now is very important to me and I don\u2019t want to be disturbed by anyone,\u201d said Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder, Lin, you really have to help. This person is really very important,\u201d Elder Zheng requested for the third time, hoping Lin Fan would come over to help.</p><br/><p>\u201cTo me, the time I have now is very important. In fact, there\u2019s nothing more important right now than what I\u2019m currently doing. You have to understand, Elder Zheng. If he can endure until I\u2019m done settling my problem, then get him to wait,\u201d said Lin Fan.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-3\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Zheng Zhong Shan was about to say something but then the call had been hung up.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Zheng, how is it?\u201d beside Elder Zheng, a middle-aged man asked anxiously.</p><br/><p>Elder Zheng shook his head. \u201cHe has things to do, so he can\u2019t come for now.\u201d</p><br/><p>The middle-aged man was frantic. \u201cWhat? He can\u2019t come? No, he has to come. I\u2019ll get someone to go to Shanghai and drag him over.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zheng Zhong Shan frowned. \u201cWhat are you thinking of doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>When the middle-aged man heard that, he instantly became more docile. \u201cElder Zheng, I can\u2019t wait. This matter cannot be dragged on.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if it can\u2019t, it has to.\u201d</p><br/><p>He had no idea what had happened with Elder Lin. Just what could it be that would be so important to him?</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>At that moment, Lin Fan\u2019s brows twitched. The fishing line had moved. He quickly lifted the fishing rod.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-4\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cThe task of fishing up a legendary item has been completed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnlocking the twenty-first page of knowledge. For it is the twenty-first page of knowledge, an automatic draw will be carried out.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan didn\u2019t listen to the task completion notification but looked at the object in his hands instead. He was a little disappointed.</p><br/><p>A storage ring with unlimited space. If it was before, he would have been extremely excited but now, he wasn\u2019t in the mood at all.</p><br/><p>He calmly wore the ring on his finger. He kept the other things that he had fished up and continued fishing.</p><br/><p>The next day!</p><br/><p>The hospital.</p><br/><p>Zhao Li Xing said, \u201cDoctor, what\u2019s my Dad\u2019s current condition?\u201d</p><br/><p>The doctor pushed up his glasses and said, \u201cMister Zhao, your father\u2019s situation isn\u2019t looking good. According to our check, his body\u2019s organs are showing signs of failing. And it\u2019s very serious. In layman\u2019s terms, he\u2019s dying of old age.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat can\u2019t be. My dad is only over seventy. He\u2019s not even eighty yet. How could he be dying of old age?\u201d the daughter, Zhao Qun Fang said anxiously.</p><br/><p>The doctor said, \u201cWe can\u2019t do anything either. Your father has had toxins accumulating in his body for a long period of time because of his profession. His body can\u2019t be compared to an average person\u2019s.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Li Xing grabbed the doctor. \u201cDoctor, tell me honestly, how long more does he have?\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-5\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cThat can\u2019t be confirmed. It depends on your father\u2019s situation but it won\u2019t be more than three days. His body has already exceeded its working capacity. Once his bodily processes stop, that means\u2026\u201d The doctor didn\u2019t say anymore. Everyone already understood.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow could it be? He was fine just a while ago. Why did he suddenly become like this?\u201d Zhao Li Xing couldn\u2019t understand it.</p><br/><p>The doctor said, \u201cThis can be likened to a motor vehicle. When a car gas fuel, regardless of the amount, it will be able to run. But once the fuel is depleted, the car will stop.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, the doctor left.</p><br/><p>Zhao Li Xing looked at his siblings. \u201cDon\u2019t tell Mom about this yet.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMmm, we know. Oh right, where\u2019s Master Lin? If it\u2019s him, he\u2019d definitely have a solution,\u201d said Zhao Qun Fang.</p><br/><p>Zhao Li Xing shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s useless. Master Lin came over a while ago to treat Dad\u2019s flu but he didn\u2019t say anything else after that. He probably knows what\u2019s happening. This isn\u2019t an illness. This is something that everyone will have to experience eventually. Even if his medical ability was even greater, it would be useless.\u201d</p><br/><p>When the rest heard this, they couldn\u2019t help but let out miserable expressions.</p><br/><p>At that moment, a group of reporters appeared.</p><br/><p>If this was before, Zhao Ming Wing would definitely not have drawn any attention but his status was not the same anymore. He was a big shot in the Chinese medicine world now. He was Master Lin\u2019s student who had contributed to the development of the leukemia prescription. Now that he had suddenly been admitted to the hospital, they were afraid that something bad had happened.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-6\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>And when they thought about his age, the reporters had a rough idea of what was going on.</p><br/><p>It must have been a big issue.</p><br/><p>Zhao Li Xing hadn\u2019t expected reporters to come. He didn\u2019t want to answer any of their questions and the reporters didn\u2019t ask any questions either. But they were unyielding.</p><br/><p>With their capabilities, they could definitely find out many things.</p><br/><p>In the morning.</p><br/><p>The news came out.</p><br/><p>\u2018Zhao Ming Qing, Director Zhao, has been admitted to the hospital. His health is in a dangerous situation. Perhaps\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Contributor to the development of the leukemia prescription, Zhao Ming Qing, has been admitted to the hospital in an emergency. Things aren\u2019t looking good.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Master Lin\u2019s student has been admitted to the hospital. Something that even Master Lin can\u2019t resolve, what could that be?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018According to the latest updates. Master Lin has disappeared from Cloud Street and hasn\u2019t appeared in days.\u2019</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-7\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, Zhao Ming Qing is in the hospital? What\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI feel that something major must have happened. Zhao Ming Qing is Master Lin\u2019s student. If he\u2019s sick, why would he need to go to the hospital? It seems to me that there\u2019s only one possibility\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin has disappeared for days. What do you guys think he\u2019s doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t know. I\u2019ll keep watching the news.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>When Fraud Tian saw the news, he cried out in shock.</p><br/><p>\u201cZhao Ming Qing has been admitted to the hospital? How can that be?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang was taken aback as well. \u201cDo you think that Brother Lin has suddenly disappeared because he\u2019s finding a solution to this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan said worriedly, \u201cFor something to leave Brother Lin at a loss, it must be very serious.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho knows?\u201d</p><br/><p>Beijing.</p><br/><p>Zheng Zhong Shan had seen the news as well. When he saw it, he had been stunned. Elder Lin\u2019s student was in the hospital.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-8\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Then, he recalled his interaction with Elder Lin on the phone and he instantly understood. Elder Lin must have been trying to save his student first. That was why he had rejected him.</p><br/><p>If that was the case, he could understand.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p></div>\n</div>"}

To them, this news was too explosive, even a little scary.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-1\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>They hadn\u2019t thought that Master Lin\u2019s group of good friends was so huge. It was simply terrifying.</p><br/><p>Many netizens worked in Shanghai and when they saw the people in the videos and images, they found them familiar. Especially when they found out that their own bosses were Master Lin\u2019s friends, they became speechless.</p><br/><p>Some professional trolls\u2019 greatest ambition in their lives was to bring Master Lin down with hate. But now, they realized that their own bosses were actually good friends of Master Lin. This put them at a loss.</p><br/><p>Hence, they had decided that they would definitely never say at work that they lived to troll Master Lin.</p><br/><p>After all, if someone were to report it to their bosses, things would get out of hand. Their careers would practically be over.</p><br/><p>*Ding ding*</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-2\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>At that moment, Lin Fan was still lying on his bed. He wasn\u2019t one bit bothered by the news in the world. To him, all of this was completely unimportant.</p><br/><p>As for that Chen Shi, Lin Fan was even less bothered by him. He didn\u2019t care who he was. To Lin Fan, he was unimportant.</p><br/><p>The phone rang and Lin Fan was a little annoyed as he wondered who would call him so early in their morning. That person wasn\u2019t even giving him a chance to rest.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello, who is it?\u201d Lin Fan answered in a daze.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Lin, you really don\u2019t think about things. Your teaching block has been completed and you didn\u2019t even notify me?\u201d on the other end of the call, Yue Qiu Ju Shi greeted Lin Fan with a rather unhappy tone.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d When Lin Fan heard that, he was momentarily stunned. Then, he looked at the phone display before realizing that it was Yue Qiu Ju Shi. He didn\u2019t know what to say.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Yue, where did you hear this? It has already ended yesterday. Moreover, this isn\u2019t a big matter at all, why would you all have to come all the way from Beijing?\u201d explained Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>He felt that his attempt to be low-key this time might have been a mistake. If he had known, perhaps he would have invited everybody.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-3\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>But thinking about it, that wouldn\u2019t be right either. If he had invited everybody, things would have gotten out of hand.</p><br/><p>The people from the Chinese Martial Arts Association hadn\u2019t been invited.</p><br/><p>The people from the Chinese Art Association hadn\u2019t been invited.</p><br/><p>As for the Chinese Medical Association, it was needless to say that he hadn\u2019t even informed any of them.</p><br/><p>If he had really invited everyone, things would have been crazy.</p><br/><p>He spoke for a long while more before he finally appeased Yue Qiu Ju Shi. However, it did make sense. To them, the fact that he hadn\u2019t invited them meant that he didn\u2019t think highly of them. Hence, he decided that, in the future, no matter what, he had to invite them too. If they declined, then he would rebut as well: \u2018Are you not going to give me any face?\u2019</p><br/><p>Education Department.</p><br/><p>Chen Shi\u2019s face was calm but his heart was not. Yesterday\u2019s incident was still causing his heart to burn with rage. The main task for today was to resolve this matter.</p><br/><p>They had never bothered much about Nanshan Children\u2019s Welfare Institute because they had been too busy.</p><br/><p>But later on, they felt that Nanshan Children\u2019s Welfare Institute had to go back on the regular path. They felt that, with Master Lin\u2019s support, Nanshan Children\u2019s Welfare Institute might produce an exceptional result.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-4\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>If things really turned out that way, it would add on as one of their accomplishments.</p><br/><p>In the conference room.</p><br/><p>Chen Shi was sitting there and the surrounding employees were all a little curious. They wondered why the leader had pulled all of them here early in the morning.</p><br/><p>Moreover, even when they asked his secretary, the secretary pretended like he didn\u2019t know and told them to wait for the leader to announce it.</p><br/><p>When they heard that, their hearts naturally became even more curious.</p><br/><p>After all, this situation was too strange.</p><br/><p>\u201cAhem!\u201d Chen Shi cleared his throat, then swept the room with his gaze. \u201cIs anyone still not here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so. Everyone should be here already.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLeader, do you have an important matter to announce today?\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone looked at each other as they didn\u2019t know what had happened. They already knew about the previous day\u2019s situation and that the leader was very angry but they didn\u2019t know what had happened that had made the leader so angry.</p><br/><p>But no matter what, they understood in their hearts that they definitely couldn\u2019t ask what they wanted to. If the leader didn\u2019t say anything, they had to control their curiosity.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, today we\u2019re having a conference mainly related to Nanshan Children\u2019s Welfare Institute\u2019s future development and prospects. But before this, I have to state one thing clearly.\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-5\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Then, the secretary walked in from outside. He had a strange expression on his face as if he had discovered something out of the ordinary.</p><br/><p>\u201cLeader, I\u2019ve found out the information,\u201d the secretary whispered into the leader\u2019s ear.</p><br/><p>However, the important part was that his voice seemed a little unsure. When he had received the name list from the reporters, he had been shocked. And it hadn\u2019t just been a normal kind of shock. He felt that this wasn\u2019t right. Hence, he had immediately come to report it to the leader after getting the information.</p><br/><p>Chen Shi nodded. \u201cWho are they?\u201d</p><br/><p>He wanted to see just who had been there the previous day. Although he couldn\u2019t do anything to them right now, he had to remember all these in his heart. He believed that, someday, these people would come looking for him for help.</p><br/><p>The secretary hesitated for a moment before handing over the name list. Then, he went to stand at the back.</p><br/><p>The employees who were sitting there were all surprised as they wondered what was happening.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Chen Shi looked at the name list. But when he saw the first name, he felt that something wasn\u2019t right.</p><br/><p>Wang An, Chairman of Nanjiang Trading Company Limited.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-6\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>He wasn\u2019t very familiar with this name but, looking at his title, it seemed like this person was an entrepreneur. Then, he carried on looking.</p><br/><p>Upon looking, he felt that things weren\u2019t right once again. Behind every name, it seemed to state that they were the chairmen of different companies.</p><br/><p>What the heck was going on?</p><br/><p>His heart was filled with doubt. Just who on earth were those people who had attended Nanshan Children\u2019s Institute\u2019s teaching block opening ceremony?</p><br/><p>As his gaze continued downwards, his expression turned worse and worse.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang, Chairman of Eastern Han Group.</p><br/><p>He was familiar with this name. An outstanding entrepreneur in Shanghai. In the past, this person had gone on many television shows about wealth and finance and he was very close to some of the leaders of Shanghai.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The employees noticed that the leader\u2019s expression was gradually changing and their curiosity started to increase as well.</p><br/><p>Suddenly!</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-7\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>A name appeared within Chen Shi\u2019s sight. His little heart instantly started thumping profusely.</p></div>\n</div>"}

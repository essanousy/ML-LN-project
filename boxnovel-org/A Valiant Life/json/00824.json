Lin Fan rushed to hug Elder Dog and got him off the car. He felt like the Elder Dog was going to explode soon.</p><br/><p>\u201cDoggy, wake up. How are you?\u201d Lin Fan patted Elder Dog Nicholas on the face but he did not respond at all.</p><br/><p>The situation right now made Lin Fan at a loss of what to do. What was going on with his dog? Could he have been attacked by someone outside?</p><br/><p>It was on the verge of undergoing an evolution which transcended everything else.</p><br/><p>Suddenly.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan realized the Elder Dog had moved. Also, his movements were a little fishy. The Elder Dog was twitching. Also, the twitching was very frequent. The dog\u2019s claws were trembling like he could die at any moment.</p><br/><p>When he saw the situation, he was a little anxious. No matter what, the dog was still his own pet. If it were to suddenly and dubiously die, it would be very fishy.</p><br/><p>Although he was not a vet, he was still a godly doctor and there were not any boundaries. After a careful examination, he realized that dog was very normal and there was not any danger to his life.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Lin Fan was hopeless and could not do anything. He could only just kneel there and wait.</p><br/><p>He just had to see how long the dog was going to twitch for.</p><br/><p>Surprisingly, after a while, the Elder Dog calmed down. It opened his eyes and like nothing had happened, cried out.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was a little confused. He did not know what had just happened. What kind of condition did the Elder Dog have?</p><br/><p>Although both sides had a connection between them, he was not some celestial being so he definitely would not know what happened to it.</p><br/><p>*bark*</p><br/><p>In a flash, the Elder Dog had undergone a huge change. His fur started to stand up, like a hedgehog.</p><br/><p>To others, they probably would not be able to feel anything. However, to Lin Fan, he could feel that the vigor of the dog had drastically changed.</p><br/><p>Snap!</p><br/><p>It leveled up.</p><br/><p>The body of the dog had actually become bigger. Although the changes were not very big and basically it was not anything eye-catching, it was still a big change.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan\u2019s heart was racing. Could this be the evolution that he was supposed to go through?</p><br/><p>The activity in this evolution was a little small. It did not have any sort of earth-shattering changes.</p><br/><p>However, that long-awaited notification sound came.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe mission to take care of the Elder Dog and make it bigger has been accomplished. Encyclopedic points +20.\u201d</p><br/><p><em>D*mn!</em></p><br/><p><em>It was accomplished just like that. I did not even do anything special at all. All I did was just feed him a grain of \u2018Righteous Pet Food\u2019 and then it was finished? This mission was really too easy.</em></p><br/><p>\u201cOpening the 19th page of knowledge. The odds of drawing a major classification of knowledge has been raised 60%. Since it is the 19th page of knowledge, the knowledge will be randomly drawn.\u201d</p><br/><p>He was feeling a little nervous now. Although he was already satisfied with his abilities a long time ago, the opportunity to gain a new ability made him feel very curious. Also, there was an additional 60% probability of drawing a major classification. Thinking about it made him very excited.</p><br/><p>\u201cUnlocking the Xianxia major classification knowledge: Alchemy (With the mystical boost of the Encyclopedia)\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTask: Use this classification of knowledge to relieve the suffering of 10 people.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTask Reward: Encyclopedic Points +20 and unlocking of the 20th page of knowledge.\u201d</p><br/><p>Encyclopedic Points: 3220</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck, I\u2019ve hit the jackpot.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan heard the mission for this knowledge he felt like he was on cloud nine.</p><br/><p><em>The Xianxia major classification of alchemy. Is this some sort of joke?</em></p><br/><p>However.</p><br/><p>He suddenly felt like he was not in a very good situation. He felt like right now he was in a world of trouble.</p><br/><p>The most important thing when it came to concocting a pill was that he needed to have ingredients. Right now, he had no ingredients at all so what kind of sh*t could he concoct?</p><br/><p>Even the making of that Little Intelligence Pill almost tormented him to death.</p><br/><p>Now that he has opened the major classification of alchemy, why did he have the feeling that something was wrong?</p><br/><p>Also, there was a slight problem with the task. He had to use his knowledge of concocting pills to relieve 10 people of their suffering. This made him feel a little jittery.</p><br/><p>The Elder Dog looked at Lin Fan and was wondering why his owner looked so awkward. He was wondering why there was such a weird vibe coming from him.</p><br/><p>He was excited for a moment and then sad the next. It could only helplessly wondering if he was okay or not.</p><br/><p>Ring ring ~</p><br/><p>At this moment. Wang Ming Yang called him.</p><br/><p>Lin fan answered the call and said, \u201cWhat\u2019s up, Ming Yang?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang said, \u201cTomorrow night. At the old gathering spot. This is the second time that you\u2019ll be participating in the gathering.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck, why was it pushed forward this year?\u201d Lin Fan said. He and Wang Ming Yang had become friends through this gathering and now, they were part of this circle. Thus, they were required to participate once a year. It was the equivalent of keeping up to date with each other\u2019s lives.</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe. The timing isn\u2019t set yet so when they feel like gathering then we will gather. You better remember this,\u201d Wang Ming Yang urged. He was still scared that his old buddy would not come. If he did not, then this gathering would be pointless.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cOkay, okay. I got it.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two of them chatted for a while before hanging up.</p><br/><p>Opening the 19th page of knowledge was a good start. It looked like he was going to become a legendary elder that spent his entire life studying alchemy.</p><br/><p>With regards to the knowledge of Xianxia, he was very careful when dealing with it since it was the power that was part of the legends. Lin Fan was also thinking about how blissful it would be if he could actually become a god in the future.</p><br/><p>After bringing the Elder Dog back to Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian looked at the Elder Dog and said, \u201cAh, that\u2019s weird. Why does it feel like the Elder Dog has become taller?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed and said, \u201cYou aren\u2019t going crazy. The Elder Dog has grown.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang came by to take a look. He also felt that it had grown bigger. However, that should not be happening. He had just seen him in a near death state just now so he was in disbelief that he had suddenly changed like that.</p><br/><p>It was really very weird.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan patter the Elder Dog\u2019s fur and said, \u201cThe Elder Dog looks even more handsome. It has really become very good looking.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Elder Dog let out a few barks in happiness. It was like it was very satisfied with the power of righteousness and was anxious to go out and do more righteous deeds.</p><br/><p>The next day!</p><br/><p>At night.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan dressed himself up as best as he could. No matter how he felt about it, tonight\u2019s gathering was still one of the more grand ones. If he did not look his best, he would lose face.</p><br/><p>He started the car and went on his way.</p><br/><p>When he reached Wang Ming Yang\u2019s place, the outside was already filled with cars parked outside. It seemed like he had arrived pretty late.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang had been waiting outside for a while already. When he saw Lin Fan, he immediately rushed in front and said, \u201cMy Brother, can you have a better grasp of time? I know that the guest of honor usually comes last but you are really too slow.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the time and said, \u201cI\u2019m not that slow. Didn\u2019t you say that it was 8 pm? It\u2019s only 7.58 pm now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang already did not what to say anymore. But he said, \u201cSuit yourself. Didn\u2019t I say 7.30 pm?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved him off and said, \u201cOkay, okay. Let\u2019s not dilly dally any further, let\u2019s go in.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan arrived, everyone in the room was in deep discussion. They would talk about something while looking at Lin Fan and laughing.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, you\u2019re finally here. We\u2019ve been waiting for quite a while already.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, look at the way Master Lin is dressed. He must have been very meticulous when he was getting dressed.\u201d</p><br/><p>The people present right now were all the same as last year. Some of them were more comfortable with Lin Fan and their tone was a little more light-hearted with him.</p><br/><p>However, some of them were not very comfortable with him and were obviously very reserved around him.</p><br/><p>Regardless of how large amount of assets they had, they all knew that Master Lin had a very high place in this group of people\u2019s hearts.</p><br/><p>Thus, they were very careful with what they said.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed and said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry for making everyone wait.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p></div>\n</div>"}

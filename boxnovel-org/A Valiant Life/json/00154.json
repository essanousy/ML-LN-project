Right after they had praised Grand Ocean Hotel, it got struck by such a disaster and got completely wiped out. It all happened way too quickly.</p><br/><p>Those who took joy in others' misfortune kept quiet.</p><br/><p>They felt as if they had been painfully slapped in the face.</p><br/><p>\"Haha! This is killing me! Where are those people who were boasting about Grand Ocean? Please, carry on boasting.\"</p><br/><p>\"This is way too terrifying!\"</p><br/><p>\"For something like this to happen in such a big hotel\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"Scary. Terrifying.\"</p><br/><p>\"We finally know why Master Lin didn't care at all. He never even saw Grand Ocean Hotel as a worthy competitor!\"</p><br/><p>\"Who's near Master Lin's place? Quick, go and take a picture of the current situation. I want to see just how many shameless people are back.\"</p><br/><p>\"I stay at the block just opposite. I'll go take a look.\"</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>At Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>Master Lin.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was just sitting in the shop, playing with his phone. His Weibo was peaceful once again. There was no sign of the Flame War Emperor. It appeared as if some tragic event had happened in his life, causing him to lose his spirit.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian stood next to Lin Fan and said, \"Hehe, it seems that there are many more residents queuing today than previously. However, all of them are wearing masks. Could it be that there's haze in Shanghai?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed, \"What the heck are you saying? Why don't you hurry and give out the number tags?\"</p><br/><p>\"Roger!\" Fraud Tian was in a good mood. It was quite pleasing to see all those residents back. They even said just a few days ago that they wouldn't be coming anymore, but now, all of them were queuing up properly.</p><br/><p>Among the residents.</p><br/><p>The residents who had stuck by Master Lin all the way started talking eccentrically.</p><br/><p>\"Hey, did the sunrise from the West today? Why are there so many people today? There were only about ten people yesterday, how could this be? And they're wearing masks too! They must think that we can't recognize them.\"</p><br/><p>\"Didn't they say that Grand Ocean Hotel's scallion pancakes are better than Master Lin's? And that they would never buy from here again?\"</p><br/><p>Those residents wearing masks laughed awkwardly, then took off their masks.</p><br/><p>\"It was all a misunderstanding. We were just affected by the drugs and got addicted.\"</p><br/><p>The residents all laughed. They weren't trying to blame anyone. They just wanted to tease them a little bit.</p><br/><p>After the Grand Ocean scallion pancake incident, the number of people queuing increased instead of decreasing.</p><br/><p>The owners of the surrounding shops stood outside their shops. As they looked at the scene, they were delighted. Their source of customers was back once again. Master Lin was really amazing. This, they had to admit.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian gave out the number tags.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan announced the chosen numbers.</p><br/><p>Those residents who were chosen got very emotional. Those who didn't get chosen still stayed.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan stood in front of his stall and skillfully made his delicious scallion pancakes, one after another.</p><br/><p>\"Master Lin, don't be angry. We were just tricked by them.\"</p><br/><p>Some of the residents started to explain themselves to Lin Fan. They felt like they had let down Master Lin. After being seduced by those scallion pancakes, they actually spoke badly of Master Lin. When they thought about it, they were filled with regret.</p><br/><p>The residents were afraid that Master Lin might have a grudge against them, however, Lin Fan could honestly tell them that they were just overthinking. Even if there were no customers at all, he wouldn't have minded it, he might even have been relieved.</p><br/><p>But he never would have thought that these residents were so shameless to just return as if nothing had happened right after they had been cheated.</p><br/><p>Even so, he was just selling ten servings of scallion pancakes a day, so it wouldn't have mattered even if more people came.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan flashed a smile at the crowd to show that he wasn't bothered by it.</p><br/><p>As for the Grand Ocean Hotel incident, he didn't take it to heart at all. When he looked at Chief Zhang, he could tell that he would be imprisoned, but not for too long of a time. The man had many ways of thinking and many schemes, but if he had known about the prohibited ingredients in the scallion pancakes, he would never have carried on selling them even if he was beaten to death.</p><br/><p>The final outcome was just a little lesson for him.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian stood at the entrance and gazed into the distance as if he was thinking of something, but was uncertain.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan asked, \"What are you looking at? You're looking so intently.\"</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian shook his head, \"No, look at that building over there. Is that a piece of cured meat hanging there or a child? It's too far, I can't tell for sure.\"</p><br/><p>\"Really?\" Lin Fan raised his head and looked. He wasn't sure either, but it looked like that figure was swinging.</p><br/><p>The townsfolk who were buying scallion pancakes looked as well.</p><br/><p>\"Hey, it looks like a child.\"</p><br/><p>\"That's not right, it's probably a piece of cured meat. It looks pretty big.\"</p><br/><p>\"Do you make your cured meat in the Summer? It's so hot, won't it rot?\"</p><br/><p>\"If it isn't cured meat, then\u2026...\"</p><br/><p>\u2026...</p><br/><p>Just as the residents were discussing, the sirens of an ambulance could be heard, then, the sirens of a police car.</p><br/><p>One of the residents exclaimed, \"That's a child! A child fell down there!\"</p><br/><p>Then, the residents all cried out in shock.</p><br/><p>\"Go take a look and see what's going on!\"</p><br/><p>\"Oh no, if it's a child, it would be terrible.\"</p><br/><p>\"Yeah, the ambulance and the police car are here. Something big must have happened.\"</p><br/><p>\u2026...</p><br/><p>People generally have curious hearts. When they see something that intrigues them, they will all go and take a look.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan took a glance, then put his teacup down. He said, \"I'm going to go take a look. You guys watch the shop.\"</p><br/><p>\"Okay\u2026... okay\u2026...\" Fraud Tian was still staring blankly at the building.</p><br/><p>There were several thirty-something-storied apartment buildings around Cloud Street. If the child was hanging from there, it would be really terrifying.</p><br/><p>Upon reaching the building.</p><br/><p>The ground floor of the building was already surrounded by a large crowd.</p><br/><p>The residents looked upwards, pointing and speaking the local Shanghai dialect. Lin Fan didn't understand their words, but he could roughly understand their meaning. It was truly a scary situation.</p><br/><p>\"Why isn't 119 here yet?\"</p><br/><p>\"The ambulance and police car have reached, but they're still not here.\"</p><br/><p>At that moment, a young lady with a frantic expression on her face shrieked miserably, \"Hurry up and save my child\u2026...\"</p><br/><p>\"Where are they....\"</p><br/><p>The young lady was so anxious that her entire body was trembling.</p><br/><p>\"He fell from the twenty-eighth floor and his head got stuck on the window grills on the twenty-sixth floor. Right now, the owner of the twenty-sixth-floor apartment isn't around.\"</p><br/><p>\"It's not just the twenty-sixth floor, even the twenty-fifth and twenty-seventh floors have no one around.\"</p><br/><p>\"If he's not rescued soon, the child might be choked to death!\"</p><br/><p>\"It seems that the mother came downstairs to take out the garbage, but she never expected something like this to happen.\"</p><br/><p>The residents downstairs were all anxious as well, but it seemed like there was no solution to the current situation.</p><br/><p>\"The fire engine is stuck in a traffic jam! It's still not here!\"</p><br/><p>\"The owner of the twenty-sixth-floor apartment is at work. They've already given him a call and he's rushing back right now, but I don't know if he can make it in time.\"</p><br/><p>\"Quick, go and take a look! Check if the door on the twenty-seventh floor has been opened yet.\"</p><br/><p>When the child's mother heard this, she ran into the building immediately. She was scared out of her wits and she had lost her ability to think clearly.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan felt that since he had come across this situation, he had to go take a look.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

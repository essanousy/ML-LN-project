Have you been shocked by your teacher\u2019s technique?\u201d Lin Fan asked as he inserted the silver needles. Zhao Ming Qing had a look of astonishment in his eyes.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-1\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing nodded. \u201cMmm, Teacher, how did you do that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. \u201cBe patient. You can\u2019t learn it in your current situation. When the time comes, I\u2019ll slowly teach you. You\u2019ll have to put effort into it. It isn\u2019t something that can be learned overnight.\u201d</p><br/><p>Of course, this technique was really difficult to learn. Without the Encyclopedia\u2019s mystical boost, no one would be able to reach this stage in a short time.</p><br/><p>However, it gave Zhao Ming Qing hope. It made him think that a long as he persevered, he would be able to learn even more f*cking awesome medical skills.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll definitely persevere until I learn this technique,\u201d said Zhao Ming Qing.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, alright. You\u2019ll have to work hard then. There is much that you do not know yet. You\u2019re interested in researching medicine, aren\u2019t you? Let\u2019s set a small goal. For example, curing an incurable disease. What say you?\u201d Lin Fan said with a smile.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-2\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>When Zhao Ming Qing heard that, his eyes lit up in disbelief. \u201cTeacher, are you for real?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cYou still don\u2019t believe me? When have I ever lied to you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, Teacher has never lied to me. I can\u2019t wait already,\u201d said Zhao Ming Qing excitedly. He was filled with hope for the future.</p><br/><p>Seeing Zhao Ming Qing like this, Lin Fan sighed in his heart. <em>My good disciple, Teacher will definitely save you. But in the future, I\u2019m going to be helpless.</em></p><br/><p><em>How can a prescription be developed so easily? I\u2019m definitely going to endure hardships again.</em></p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, go out for a walk and take in some fresh air. Don\u2019t read books for now and don\u2019t think about Chinese medicine either. Is that okay?\u201d said Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. Whatever Teacher says, I\u2019ll definitely listen.\u201d Zhao Ming Qing smiled, then he got off the bed and dressed up before walking out.</p><br/><p>Zhao Shi, who had been waiting outside the whole time, saw the old man and was suddenly invigorated. A wide smile appeared on her face. \u201cYou\u2019ve recovered?\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-3\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing replied, \u201cOf course I have. With teacher personally treating me, how could there be a problem?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good. That\u2019s good.\u201d Zhao Shi heaved a sigh of relief. She had really been afraid that something might happen.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, will you stay for a meal?\u201d asked Zhao Ming Qing.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved his hand. \u201cI won\u2019t. I still have things to do. Take good care of your body.\u201d Then, he shifted his gaze over to Zhao Shi. \u201cWatch over him and don\u2019t let him stay up at night. Don\u2019t let him read books either.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOld man, did you hear that? Don\u2019t stay up late anymore.\u201d How could Zhao Shi possibly control Zhao Ming Qing? She shot him a glare.</p><br/><p>\u201cSigh, I know.\u201d Zhao Ming Qing nodded in agreement. Without reading any books, how would he survive?</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Lin Fan left Zhao Ming Qing\u2019s home. He felt that it was about time. <em>Angling knowledge, give me strength. My student\u2019s life is dependant on you.</em></p><br/><p>He went back to his shop and said hello to Fraud Tian. For now, he wouldn\u2019t be coming to the shop, nor would he be selling scallion pancakes.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian and the rest had no idea what had happened but they saw that Lin Fan\u2019s expression was quite serious. They were afraid that a problem might have occurred, so they didn\u2019t ask too much.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-4\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Lin Fan took his fishing rod and went to buy a tent. He was preparing for a crazy day of fishing.</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t go to the river bank. Although there weren\u2019t too many people there, he would eventually be disturbed. Hence, he decided to choose a more remote area.</p><br/><p>He started his car and set off.</p><br/><p>He arrived downstream. There was not a trace of a person here. It was a desolate place. If he fished here, he probably wouldn\u2019t be disturbed.</p><br/><p>In Zhao Ming Qing\u2019s current situation, his body\u2019s organs were degenerating. With Lin Fan\u2019s medical ability, changing that was impossible. He had to craft a medicinal pill.</p><br/><p>But he was still short of many ingredients. He had to quickly fish up the ingredients he needed. This was a kind of gamble.</p><br/><p>He carried a stool over and cast his fishing line out. He sat down and waited silently.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, he had the Wuxia major class of knowledge and his strength was great. He wouldn\u2019t have to give up due to fatigue.</p><br/><p>Soon after.</p><br/><p>There was a tug on his fishing line. His heart was a little eager. He started to retrieve his reward.</p><br/><p>But he was disappointed. What he fished up was just a decent medicinal herb and it wasn\u2019t what he needed to craft the medicinal pill. He felt slightly miserable.</p><br/><p>But it was still early. He could slowly fish. He didn\u2019t believe that, if he pressed on, he wouldn\u2019t get what he wanted.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-5\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Several days passed.</p><br/><p>Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian was getting suspicious. \u201cSigh, don\u2019t you think it\u2019s strange? Where has the kid gone? He hasn\u2019t come back in a few days.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang shook his head. \u201cI have no idea. He won\u2019t even pick up his phone. He must be busy with something.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian\u2019s brain started running wild. \u201cCould it be that something has happened to him?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan, who was cleaning the shop, glared at Fraud Tian. \u201cDon\u2019t say such inauspicious things. How could something happen to Brother Lin? He must be busy with something that he can\u2019t afford to leave.\u201d</p><br/><p>The surrounding shop owners would come around and ask occasionally as well. After all, they hadn\u2019t seen Little Boss in a few days. They were wondering if something had happened. Little Boss had disappeared mysteriously and suddenly.</p><br/><p>The townsfolk who always bought scallion pancakes came occasionally to take a look as well. They realized that Master Lin hadn\u2019t appeared in the shop for a few days and they were desperate.</p><br/><p>They wanted to eat the scallion pancakes very badly. But if Master Lin didn\u2019t appear, they were helpless.</p><br/><p>In a villa.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-6\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing was coughing. His vision was blurry and he felt that his whole body was weak.</p><br/><p>Zhao Shi said, \u201cOld man, are you not feeling well? Do you want to go and rest?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing nodded. \u201cMmm, I\u2019ll rest for a bit. My body hasn\u2019t been good recently. I can\u2019t get my energy up at all.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Shi asked, \u201cShould I call the kids over and bring you to the hospital?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy would you want to call them over? This is my own problem. How can we just call them over as we like? I don\u2019t need to go to the hospital. I\u2019m a doctor myself. How could I not know what\u2019s the problem?\u201d said Zhao Ming Qing.</p><br/><p>Zhao Shi had no choice but to nod in agreement. After sending Zhao Ming Qing back to his room, she took out her phone and sneakily gave her son a call.</p><br/><p>\u201cLi Xing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMom, what is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour dad\u2019s health hasn\u2019t been good recently and he\u2019s always feeling weak. He even had flu a while ago which was cured by Master Lin. But now, he\u2019s having problems again. Why don\u2019t you come back and tell your dad to go to the hospital?\u201d said Zhao Shi.</p><br/><p>When Zhao Li Xing heard that, he became anxious. \u201cMom, I\u2019ll tell the rest right now. We\u2019ll come back together.\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-7\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cAlright, alright.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Li Xing\u2019s heart started thumping rapidly after he heard that. He kept feeling as if something must have gone wrong. He felt restless.</p><br/><p>To him, his greatest fear was old people falling ill. If it was just falling ill, it would be fine because at least they would know about the problem. But this sudden loss of energy and weakness was hard to say.</p><br/><p>Hence, without hesitation, he gave his brothers calls and told them to go home together to see how their father was doing.</p></div>\n</div>"}

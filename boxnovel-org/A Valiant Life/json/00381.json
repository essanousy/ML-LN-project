Whatever Lin Fan said, he wasn't joking around. When he said he was going to cure him, he wasn't going to delay at all.</p><br/><p>Let me down now and I promise I won't investigate this issue further.\" Zhao Ming Qing was tired and old, and he certainly couldn't win a young man. \"Young man, you are breaking the law by doing this. If you go through with this, it'll be too late to regret it.\"</p><br/><p>Since it was in the morning, the people who were walking around were few. However, no one had noticed what was going on.</p><br/><p>\"Don't talk about this first. I'll repeat what I said just now. I'm giving you two options. Once I cure you of your illness, you can either take me as your master or certify me as a Chinese Medicine Practitioner,\" Lin Fan said as he picked up Zhao Ming Qing's box of acupuncture needles, opening it. Inside was lined with all sorts of long and short needles. \"Not bad, all these needles are superior quality ones, and it looks like it got handed down.\"</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing was at loss on what to do. \"Kid, don't play around.\"</p><br/><p>He was tied up against the tree by a rope. If he wasn't as healthy, he might not have been able to have withstood all that tossing and turning around. Why are all the young people now so aggressive? If you didn't meet eye to eye they would just take action? Looking at the young man in front of him, he didn't look like a mentally ill patient or anyone who was crazy. What was going on?</p><br/><p>At that moment, the people who were walking by didn't notice what was going on.</p><br/><p>There was a young lady who was wearing white sports attire. Her figure was tall and slender, her face was pretty. Walking next to her was an old man who looked around sixty to seventy years old and he was wearing white sports attire as well.</p><br/><p>\"Grandpa, the air around here is really refreshing!\" the pretty lady said as she looked around the place in awe.</p><br/><p>The old man nodded his head, smiling. \"It really is quite something. The air is fresh, good for our bodies.\"</p><br/><p>\"Help.\"</p><br/><p>At this moment, a cry for help was heard. Both the young lady and the old man stood there stunned for a moment, before snapping out of it as they looked at the direction where the sound came from.</p><br/><p>\"Let's go take a look\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was holding the acupuncture needles between his hands, as his hands ran through Zhou Ming Qing's chest. \"Don't call for help, just relax. My medical skill is superior. If not for the fact that I still need my license to practice, I won't just heal anyone. I hope you remember my request after I heal you.\"</p><br/><p>\"Don't play around. If you really want your license, you should enroll yourself in an institution and study for it, not go down this path,\" Zhao Ming Qing shook his head as he said.</p><br/><p>\"I can't enroll. I don't qualify to enroll, and the examinations for this year is already over. I see that your position is senior and you definitely can pull some strings. I have no patience to wait, and so in a while, you'll know what I mean,\" Lin Fan said. Sometimes, even those with respectable skill didn't make it because of the regulations and timing, and so this was his next best option.</p><br/><p>\"Stop right there.\"</p><br/><p>Suddenly, a tender shout came from the side. Lin Fan turned around, his brows furrowed. He was almost going to finish what he set out to accomplish, and now something is stopping him.</p><br/><p>\"Grandpa Zhao!\" the pretty lady cried out as she noticed Zhao Ming Qing tied up against the tree.</p><br/><p>\"Quick, call the police,\" Zhao Ming Qing saw the pretty young lady, his eyes lighting up with delight.</p><br/><p>\"Brother Zhao, what happened to you?\" the other old man who was wearing white sports attire asked.</p><br/><p>\"I have no idea where this young man came from, and it's a long story. Quick, call the police.\" Zhao Ming Qing said. He wanted to use the police call to scare the young man away, but to his horror and surprise, the young man wasn't worried at all. Lin Fan turned to look at the pretty young lady and the old man.</p><br/><p>\"Old man, sister, don't you worry. I'm not a bad guy. I'm healing him in exchange for something,\" Lin Fan said, as he took up his acupuncture needles, getting ready to work on Zhao Ming Qing.</p><br/><p>\"Let go of Grandpa!\" the pretty lady stared at him, as she ran forward getting ready to kick Lin Fan in the temple.</p><br/><p>\"Careful,\" the old man wearing the sports attire said to the pretty lady.</p><br/><p>The kick was rather aggressive and had a tough quality to it. For most people, it would be unbearable.</p><br/><p>But for Lin Fan, an expert like him, it was far from challenging. Lin Fan stuck his hands out, preventing the kick from connecting. \"Pretty lady, please don't be rash.\"</p><br/><p>Just as Lin Fan said that he heard a ripping sound between the pretty lady's thighs. A crack line formed, which just so happened to fall within the line of sight of Lin Fan. Damn, it looks black\u2026</p><br/><p>\"Ahh!\"</p><br/><p>The pretty lady screamed out, and Lin Fan immediately put her leg down. \"Don't panic, I just saw, but Grandpa Zhao at the back didn't see since I was blocking, so all is good. Furthermore, this doesn't concern me. Your pants are just bad quality.\"</p><br/><p>\"Vile monster\u2026\" the pretty lady stared at Lin Fan with a death stare.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan didn't have time for this. If more people came, this would just escalate to become a huge misunderstanding.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan immediately acted, putting a needle into the pretty lady's acupuncture point, rendering her immobile.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing was horrified at first, but in that instant, he was stunned. With awestruck eyes, he looked at the scene before him. \"You stabilized her body, how is this possible?\"</p><br/><p>\"What isn't possible? The human body has twelve channels, inner organs and eight major arteries and veins. Furthermore, on each channel of the human body, you have 365 acupuncture points. Each point has a lot of depth to it. Also, did you know, that there are 24 fatal acupuncture points?\" Lin Fan started lightening up. He looked like he was bragging, but he was actually telling the truth.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing looked at Lin Fan in amazement. \"No, I did not know that.\"</p><br/><p>\"Do you want to know? But now is not the time. I'll heal you now, but you have to remember our little deal.\"Lin Fan chuckled as he said.</p><br/><p>The old man wearing white sports attire who was just about to call the police was stopped by Zhao Ming Qing. Zhao Ming Qing realized that this young chap probably knew something.</p><br/><p>The pretty lady couldn't move her whole body, and she was seeing colors as if she had seen a ghost.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Lin Fan was sure that he could finally proceed with treatment.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing looked down, seeing the acupuncture needles which were sticking out of his body. \"Kid, all these acupuncture points aren't for the lungs. How come its there?\"</p><br/><p>\"Young lad\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"Young lad\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked down as he busily proceeded with his thing, not paying any attention to the old man. At the same time, the Encyclopedia was revealing all sorts of information for Lin Fan. Without the secrets that came out of the Encyclopedia, it would take a much longer time to actually cure the old gentleman's illness. But with the help of the encyclopedia, the time for treatment was significantly reduced.</p><br/><p>This condition, however, could not be cured in one session and required further treatments in the future. For Lin Fan, it was no big deal at all.</p><br/><p>\"Does that feel more comfortable?\" Lin Fan asked.</p><br/><p>\"Yea,\" Zhao Ming Qing nodded his head.</p><br/><p>\"What did I tell you? And you didn't believe me\u2026\" Lin Fan chuckled.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing was a little apprehensive as he looked at Lin Fan's technique. Where did that skill come from? Even after so long, he hadn't seen anything like that. He felt like he knew nothing about Traditional Chinese Medicine.</p><br/><p>At that moment, he saw Lin Fan in a completely different light.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan furrowed his brows. He felt that there was a pair of eyes which was staring at his buttocks, and those eyes had evil intentions.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

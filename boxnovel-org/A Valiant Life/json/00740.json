She actually dumped our cute, little Master Lin. Isn\u2019t she just insulting us?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, this move by Master Lin was simply too good. He let you change your mind but now you regret it, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis little girl is really nothing much. She looks to cute but she changes her mind so quickly. She has hurt our Master Lin\u2019s heart.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was just as the audience was saying. Zhang Chi was filled with regret. However, there is no medicine for regret. She could only return backstage helplessly.</p><br/><p>Some of the other contestants looked at Zhang Chi and let out sadistic smiles.</p><br/><p>As Zhang Chi saw these smiles, she couldn\u2019t help but frown and she muttered in her heart, \u201cWhat kind of game is this?\u201d</p><br/><p>After Zhang Chi left.</p><br/><p>A group of contestants who were about to go on stage gathered together and whispered among themselves.</p><br/><p>\u201cI never thought that we\u2019ve all been cheated. This young lady looks so cute but she\u2019s actually so scheming.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen she just arrived, she treated us so politely and courteously and she even told us that she wanted to join Teacher Lin\u2019s team. I never thought that once Zhao Li offered some benefits, she would immediately go back on her words. She\u2019s really too snobbish.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe must be dying of regret now. Who would\u2019ve thought that Master Lin represents the Eastern Han Group? Moreover, she would even have gotten to sing Master Lin\u2019s personally composed songs. Master Lin\u2019s songs are what countless singers dream of getting their hands on. Someone even said before that no matter who sings his songs, they would still become famous across the musical world.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI hope I get chosen by Master Lin. Then, I would be able to sign to that company.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d</p><br/><p>In the toilet.</p><br/><p>Zhang Chi couldn\u2019t hold back her tears anymore. She felt as if she had been wronged. If she had known earlier, she would have pressed on with her decision.</p><br/><p>However, she had never thought that Teacher Lin had been hiding such a deep secret. If she had known that she would have gotten a contract, she would not have changed her mind no matter what kind of benefits Zhao Li offered.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>On the stage, another contestant was about to go up.</p><br/><p>Zhao Li looked at Lin Fan. \u201cSorry, Teacher Lin. I really like that contestant very much, so I had to take her by force.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved his hand indifferently. \u201cIt\u2019s not a problem, as long as you like her. Although that contestant is good, she\u2019s not someone I have to have no matter what.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Li was all smiles. Although she had not managed to humiliate this guy, she had managed to snatch away the person that he wanted. She felt great on the inside.</p><br/><p>Right now, the trending news on the Internet wasn\u2019t only about Ying Jin, but also about her.</p><br/><p>The song theft incident had not ended. The Internet was abuzz over this incident. Moreover, the direction of opinions had started to change. Most netizens had started to have doubts about the truth.</p><br/><p>Even on her Weibo, countless people were flaming her, urging her to confess the truth.</p><br/><p>She was so angry that she wanted to curse at them. But according to Sister Ying\u2019s instruction, she was supposed to ignore them. The more she cared about them, the cockier those people would become.</p><br/><p>Sometimes, Zhao Li really wanted to kill Lin Fan. However, she could only think about it. Even if she really wanted to do it, she didn\u2019t have the capabilities.</p><br/><p>Even Sister Ying couldn\u2019t do anything to him. What could she possibly do?</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Huo Jian Yang said softly, \u201cTeacher Lin, you should take some contestants. You only have one contestant as of now. Later on, you won\u2019t be able to make it with only one contestant in your team. There aren\u2019t many left to choose from now. You have to seize these opportunities.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded, \u201cMmm, I know. I just haven\u2019t seen any suitable ones yet.\u201d</p><br/><p>Huo Jian Yang felt a little helpless. To him, some of the contestants had been very good but Teacher Lin didn\u2019t want them. This really left him helpless.</p><br/><p>But what he didn\u2019t know was that Lin Fan would only choose the best contestants as well as those who were most capable of becoming popular. It was very important for him to give Wang Ming Yang some good, young blood.</p><br/><p>After all, he was Wang Ming Yang\u2019s brother. If he didn\u2019t look out for Wang Ming Yang, who would?</p><br/><p>The host, Cui Wei, said, \u201cLet\u2019s invite the next contestant on stage.\u201d</p><br/><p>During this period of time, there had already been quite a few contestants who had gone up on stage. However, they were not to Lin Fan\u2019s taste. They were far from meeting Lin Fan\u2019s standards.</p><br/><p>At this moment, a cute-looking girl stepped on stage. Her round face was very adorable.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello, dear mentors. I\u2019m Chen Yuan and I come from Yanhai. I\u2019m twenty this year. I\u2019ve gotten a flu today, so my throat might be\u2026\u201d the contestant was speaking.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, this is a singing competition. No need for all these excuses,\u201d said Zhao Li as she waved her hand unhappily.</p><br/><p>Chen Yuan was startled. She was very nervous. Her hands gripped tightly on the microphone as she looked a little embarrassed.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan saw this and said, \u201cTeacher Zhao, what you did isn\u2019t right. She just said that she has gotten a flu. Why must you be so angry? My dear beautiful little lady, you don\u2019t need to care about this crazy old woman. Give us a good performance. I have high hopes for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d Zhao Li stood up furiously and glared at Lin Fan. She had not thought that this guy would call her a crazy old woman on live broadcast.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh no, I\u2019m sorry. It slipped out of my mouth. I forgot that this is a live broadcast,\u201d said Lin Fan apologetically. However, that smile on his face was just asking for someone to beat him up.</p><br/><p>The audience laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn! Teacher Lin really doesn\u2019t feel comfortable without causing trouble for a single day.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat girl just said that she\u2019s having a flu. It\u2019s not like she was insulting Zhao Li. Why would Zhao Li be so angry?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHer anger was drawn out by Master Lin, of course. From the start of the competition until now, not a single day has passed peacefully. She has gotten flamed every single day. It\u2019s already good that she hasn\u2019t fallen apart.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat makes sense. This blame must be shouldered by Master Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Li sat down furiously. Her expression was extremely ugly. Liu Ying Dong just sat there silently. He had become clever as he stopped going against Master Lin.</p><br/><p>Even Ying Jin and Zhao Li were unable to overwhelm Master Lin. how would he be able to do anything?</p><br/><p>He decided to just finish recording the show obediently so that he would be able to leave this d*mned place.</p><br/><p>Although Chen Yuan was nervous, she had already done her preparations. She would just forget everything else and pour her emotions into her song.</p><br/><p>Although she was having the flu and her voice sounded a little coarse, you could tell that her foundation was very good.</p><br/><p>What made Lin Fan to fancy her even more was that she would be able to become popular in future.</p><br/><p>As long as she could become popular, that was enough.</p><br/><p>Chen Yuan\u2019s voice slowly faded. She looked at the four mentors. She was a little disappointed. A little unresigned. A little regretful.</p><br/><p>She had not expected that not a single mentor\u2019s light would light up.</p><br/><p>Zhao Li had her arms folded as she stared at Chen Yuan. It seemed that she had no intention of flashing her light.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Huo Jian Yang wanted to look at the remaining contestants before choosing a few with voices that he liked. Of course, he could tell that this young lady\u2019s fundamentals were very good.</p><br/><p>The song had ended and Chen Yuan was about to take a bow and leave the stage.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Lin Fan pressed the button and turned on his light. \u201cSorry, I forgot to turn on the light. I think very highly of you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Pa!</p><br/><p>At that moment, Zhao Li turned on her light too.</p><br/><p>\u201cI like your voice very much. If you join me, I can nurture you into a star in the musical world.\u201d</p><br/><p>Of course, Zhao Li was just boasting. She just wanted to let Lin Fan know that she would snatch whoever he wanted from him.</p><br/><p>Chen Yuan covered her mouth as she stood on stage. She had not expected that when she had lost all hope, there would actually be mentors who would shine their lights for her.</p><br/><p>Before the host even got on stage, Chen Yuan said excitedly, \u201cI want to join Teacher Lin\u2019s side.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan heard this, he couldn\u2019t help but laugh. Then, he looked at Zhao Li. \u201cTeacher Li, sometimes, you shouldn\u2019t be too self-confident.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Zhao Li looked away and didn\u2019t say more.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou win this time. But this kind of contestant will never enter the finals,\u201d Zhao Li thought.</p></div>\n</div>"}

This phone number was a little familiar. It seemed like it was from that woman.</p><br/><p>Could it be that he had been overly wild today and that woman could not take it?</p><br/><p>If that was the case, then it would be great news.</p><br/><p>He answered the call.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said with a frivolous tone, \u201cHello, Big Shot. To what do I owe the honor?\u201d</p><br/><p>When Ying Jin, who was on the other end of the call, heard this, she took a deep breath to settle down her emotions. She was already on the verge of exploding because of this guy.</p><br/><p>If she did not have some reason left in her, she would have wanted to take a knife and cut this b*stard up.</p><br/><p>Ying Jin said, \u201cAren\u2019t you going a bit overboard?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled, \u201cOverboard? I don\u2019t think so. I didn\u2019t do anything much, I was just telling the truth. If you think that I\u2019ve impacted you in any way, you can tell me.\u201d</p><br/><p>She had already forgotten about that incident from two years ago and when Chen Rui An had stepped on stage earlier that day, she realized that this young man was a little familiar. After recalling, she realized that this young man seemed like the contestant that she had framed two years ago.</p><br/><p>What pissed her off even more was that Lin Fan started to denounce her on the show.</p><br/><p>She was observing the situation on the Internet now. Her Weibo comment section had been completely invaded.</p><br/><p>All kinds of unpleasant words were coming at her unceasingly. If she didn\u2019t have such a good attitude, she would have flipped out long ago.</p><br/><p>Ying Jin said coldly, \u201cWhat evidence do you have to prove that I was involved in a shady business back then? If you don\u2019t have any, then I request for you to apologize.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan stayed silent for a moment.</p><br/><p>Ying Jin laughed coldly, \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you speaking? I\u2019ll give you one more chance. Otherwise, you\u2019ll bear responsibility for this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Lin Fan said, \u201cI don\u2019t have evidence indeed but I can see that you, b*tch, are not a good person. If you want to sue me, you are more than welcome. Enough talk. Chatting with you for so long makes me feel like I\u2019m wasting my time.\u201d</p><br/><p>*Beep Beep*</p><br/><p>The busy tone was heard from the other end of the call.</p><br/><p>Ying Jin was holding her brand-new phone in her hand and in that instant, her expression turned exceptionally ugly.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to take your dog life.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>Elder Dog Nicholas said, \u201cWhat does this have to do with me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>This incident, to Lin Fan, was an unexpected joyous surprise. Afterward, he didn\u2019t think much and just went back to sleep.</p><br/><p>This recent period, he had been quite busy with work.</p><br/><p>Who cares what Ying Jin thinks? It didn\u2019t have anything to do with him.</p><br/><p>But that woman was quite sinister, she would definitely try to take her revenge. Lin Fan\u2019s heart was in anticipation, wondering how she would take her revenge.</p><br/><p>The next day!</p><br/><p>On the Internet.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, I\u2019m laughing my a*s off. During last night\u2019s \u2018Strongest Heavenly Voice\u2019, something major happened again.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, is that true? I was having sex with my girlfriend yesterday, so I didn\u2019t watch it. What happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cScram. If you were having sex then you don\u2019t deserve to know what happened.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to watch the replay.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI feel like Master Lin is going to fight with Ying Jin to the death. This show is going to end.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAs Master Lin\u2019s fanboy, I firmly believe that that woman, Ying Jin, was involved in shady business.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYing Jin\u2019s Weibo has already been invaded. Everyone, hurry up and curse her a few times. Use this opportunity to vent some restless feelings.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c+1\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Shanghai TV.</p><br/><p>Everyone was waiting.</p><br/><p>Some people took out their phones and looked at the news on the Internet.</p><br/><p>\u201cYesterday\u2019s second episode had an even bigger highlight than the first episode.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Internet is being overturned and Ying Jin\u2019s Weibo has been completely seized.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh right, are the ratings out yet?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot yet. They\u2019re still adding the numbers up.\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, a staff member hurried over hastily.</p><br/><p>Everyone held their breaths in. They knew that the ratings for yesterday would not be too low. However, they had no idea what it would be exactly.</p><br/><p>If the ratings exceeded the previous day\u2019s, then it would prove that they had succeeded.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow much are the ratings? Stop delaying, hurry up and say it,\u201d the Deputy Director said excitedly. He believed that the ratings for that day would definitely be hot.</p><br/><p>The staff member looked at the statistics sheet in his hands. Although the previous day\u2019s results were shocking, today\u2019s statistics made him feel as if he was in a dream. It didn\u2019t seem realistic and he didn\u2019t even dare to imagine it.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe viewership rating is 3.985 and the market share has reached 16.54.\u201d</p><br/><p>When the crowd heard these statistics, they were instantly dumbfounded. They heard it but they could not believe it.</p><br/><p>To them, the previous day\u2019s rating was already off the charts. They had not expected today\u2019s rating to be even higher than the previous day.</p><br/><p>Moreover, what was even scarier was that the rating had almost broken past 4.</p><br/><p>The Deputy Director started laughing heartily. \u201cI knew the second episode\u2019s rating would be higher than the first but I never thought that it would reach such a level.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, his gaze shifted. It was hard to hide his excitement. \u201cHas any show ever broken past 4?\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone gasped in shock. They wrecked their brains but could not think of any.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow could any show have broken past 4?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn this age, how could there be a rating of more than 4?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn the past, there have been television shows that have broken past 4 before. Some even broke past 10. But now, the arts are blooming and there are really too many shows to choose from. Let\u2019s not talk about ratings of more than 4. Even getting ratings of more than 3 is rare and only the hottest variety shows can do it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIndeed, b*tch fights have their merits. Let\u2019s rename our show.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. \u2018Strongest Heavenly Voice\u2019 is no longer suitable. I think we should change it to \u2018Strongest B*tch Fight\u2019. The contestants are no longer important. What\u2019s important is Master Lin\u2019s existence.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Director Liu had been silent the whole time but that rosy face of his already showed that he was now completely thrilled.</p><br/><p>Ever since becoming Shanghai TV\u2019s Director, he had been dreaming of producing a popular show which would bring down Hunan TV.</p><br/><p>Even so, dreams are always perfect but reality is cruel.</p><br/><p>But as of that day, his dream had been realized.</p><br/><p>And it felt inconceivable to everyone.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>*ring ring*</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was in the middle of a dream when he suddenly heard his phone ring.</p><br/><p>He looked at the time. 8 am.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck, is this person crazy? Calling me at such an early time.\u201d Without a second thought, Lin Fan rejected the call. Then, the went back to his dreams.</p><br/><p>Shanghai TV.</p><br/><p>The Deputy Director felt helpless. \u201cMaster Lin didn\u2019t pick up.\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Liu waved his hand. \u201cAlright, Master Lin must be sleeping. Later on, pass down these instructions. \u2018Strongest Heavenly Voice\u2019 has exceeded our expectations and the promotion must be even more aggressive. If we can break past a rating of 5 or 6, then even if I have to retire, I would be content.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone stared at the Director and cursed in their hearts.</p><br/><p>Break past 5?</p><br/><p>6?</p><br/><p>How could they dare to even think of that?</p><br/><p>However, dreaming once in a while wasn\u2019t a bad thing. It might just accidentally come true.</p><br/><p>Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan just reached his shop when Wu You Lan tugged on him as she asked excitedly.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Lin, did you see the news on the Internet? You\u2019ve trending. You\u2019ve completely blown up.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo what? Isn\u2019t that completely normal?\u201d said Lin Fan indifferently. Who was he? He was Righteous Fan.</p><br/><p>When he became a little serious, how could he not blow up?</p><br/><p>However, just to see how popular he had become, he unlocked his phone to take a look.</p><br/><p>\u2018The dark horse breaks through. The rating of \u2018Strongest Heavenly Voice\u201d will pass 4.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Breaking! Why is \u2018Strongest Heavenly Voice\u2019 so hot? That\u2019s because of the existence of this guru\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>With one look at the title, he could tell it was from UC Breaking News Department.</p><br/><p>But looking through the news articles, he was drawn in by another news article.</p><br/><p>That woman, Ying Jin, had come out arrogantly.</p><br/><p>It seemed that she was in a rush to clear her own name.</p></div>\n</div>"}

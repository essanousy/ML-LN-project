She didn\u2019t have many news articles about her but now, there was a bad scandalous news.</p><br/><p>If it wasn\u2019t handled properly, her career as a celebrity would definitely be over.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang\u2019s public relations team had been trying to think of a solution but they hadn\u2019t been able to find one. They couldn\u2019t have just said that she was innocent and that the public can pass their own judgment on her. That was stupid. If they really said that, they would definitely be flamed by the public.</p><br/><p>One should never underestimate the intelligence of the netizens. Even if everything you said was true, it might be useless to them.</p><br/><p>Then, Lin Fan immediately posted a Weibo message and everyone went crazy.</p><br/><p>At Shanghai Eastern Han Group.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, Bro, what are you doing? Aren\u2019t you making the matter more complicated?\u201d Wang Ming Yang was frustrated after seeing Lin Fan\u2019s Weibo post. The matter was almost impossible to explain. Who would believe him?</p><br/><p>He had brought two ladies home and they had stayed for a night. Furthermore, their underwear had been hung on the balcony. Who would believe that nothing had happened?</p><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue said, \u201cIf this matter can\u2019t be resolved, I will take responsibility for it. Now that Brother Lin has admitted it, wouldn\u2019t he be scolded too?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang waved his hand, \u201cWe should prepare for the worst. Regardless of whether they believe us, the truth is as such.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut\u2026\u201d Wu Huan Yue wanted to add on something but Wang Ming Yang interrupted her. \u201cLet\u2019s see how it progresses. We shan\u2019t post anything about it for now. It\u2019ll only become more difficult to explain.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Ying Jin saw Lin Fan\u2019s Weibo, she smiled. She hadn\u2019t expected this fella to be so stupid that he even tried to clear their name at this time. Unless he really thought that he was someone capable.</p><br/><p>As a respected senior in the music industry, she had power and authority. However, the netizens had been flaming her. To put it bluntly, these singers were just milking money from these netizens. If the netizens didn\u2019t like someone, their net worth would definitely be affected.</p><br/><p>Therefore, despite being scolded badly, she didn\u2019t dare to do anything reckless to prevent offending any netizen.</p><br/><p>\u201cSister Ying, that fella has been going against you right from the start. Now that something like this has happened to him, he deserves it,\u201d her agent said.</p><br/><p>Ying Jin sneered, \u201cHe jumped out with it himself. I can\u2019t be blamed for this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, she took her phone and posted another Weibo message. She wanted to ruin this fella\u2019s reputation and force him to withdraw from the internet.</p><br/><p>One should never underestimate the power of a public figure. Sometimes, speech can bring about a tremendous impact, especially since Lin Fan was also a public figure. A detrimental news like this could be fatal to their careers.</p><br/><p>Forcing someone to be banished was already considered a lenient punishment.</p><br/><p>Dai Jun Ming was dumbfounded. He hadn\u2019t expected Lin Fan to expose himself. This left him helpless.</p><br/><p>Af that moment, he knew who this youngster was. He was Master Lin and he was pretty famous.</p><br/><p>As a paparazzi, he knew how to make news more explosive. Hence, he had censored Lin Fan\u2019s face. It wasn\u2019t because he felt that Lin Fan wasn\u2019t popular. It was because he felt that he was a famous person too and if he had exposed all of them at once, it would have been a waste. Hence, he decided to expose them separately to make the news more impactful.</p><br/><p>However, he hadn\u2019t expected the man to expose himself.</p><br/><p>That wasn\u2019t logical at all.</p><br/><p>Dai Jun Ming was a little unhappy but he couldn\u2019t do anything about it. Since that Master Lin wanted to die, Dai Jun Ming would fulfill his request.</p><br/><p>At Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian was stunned, \u201cHey, why did you admit it so quickly? Did something happen?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked innocently, \u201cWhat is it? Nothing happened at all. Why wouldn\u2019t I dare to admit it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang said, \u201cBrother Lin, the netizens are crazy. You\u2019re going to be scolded this time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shrugged his shoulders, \u201cLet them scold me then. Anyway, I wouldn\u2019t lose anything. I wouldn\u2019t be a man if I was to let Wu Huan Yue carry the burden of this whole scandal.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, Lin Fan looked at his Weibo and gasped, \u201cThis Ying Jin has a problem. I haven\u2019t been messing with her recently. Ever since this news was published, she hasn\u2019t stopped at all. Is she trying to mess with me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ying Jin\u2019s Weibo: \u2018Scum, inhumane beast. In my opinion, he is the world\u2019s top scum. He is talented and capable but does he only know how to ruin other ladies? Doesn\u2019t he know how to do anything decent? I believe all the netizens are just and will suppress him.\u201d</p><br/><p>She felt great about her comment. It immediately raised awareness about the scandal.</p><br/><p>However, when she saw the comments, she was stunned. The people that commented were definitely using fake Weibo accounts.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, it\u2019s Master Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c6666\u2026 Master Lin is incredible.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, I actually scolded her. So Wu Huan Yue didn\u2019t let Master Lin be cuckolded. I support them. I will support them forever.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck, just because Wu Huan Yue and Master Lin had this secret relationship, I will go and buy ten albums later.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe have to support them! However, what does Master Lin mean? Pure? Didn\u2019t do anything? How could that be? A man like him must have made something happen. We will definitely support Master Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA citizen of Qing Zhou congratulates Master Lin on his double swoop.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m a girl. Although I don\u2019t really like it, I believe in Master Lin\u2019s character. He must have allowed them to stay over as friends. Is there a need to be so stunned?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, some people have evil thoughts. Why does it mean that something must have happened when a man and woman share an apartment? I believe Master Lin is not an inhumane beast.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not even fit to be called an inhumane beast. If something has happened, I would respect him for being a man. However, I didn\u2019t expect it to be so disappointing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t really like Wu Huan Yue but I am a hardcore fan of Master Lin. Just based on their relationship, I will definitely start to follow Wu Huan Yue and become her fan.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBrothers, stop. They\u2019re all on our side. Don\u2019t be rash. These ladies belong to Master Lin. We scolded them wrongly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck, does this paparazzi have something wrong with him? F*ck you for censoring the pictures. I actually scolded Master Lin because of that. F*ck your mum.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Suddenly, after Lin Fan had admitted it, the comments on Weibo changed.</p><br/><p>The comments changed so drastically and everyone was stunned.</p><br/><p>At Shanghai Eastern Han Group.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang stared at everyone from the public relations department, \u201cCan someone tell me what is going on?\u201d</p><br/><p>Initially, he had been frustrated over this matter but what about now? The netizens had suddenly changed their way of thinking towards this matter. They all said that it was a good thing and were regretful for scolding them.</p><br/><p>This\u2026this\u2026</p><br/><p>He had seen a lot of similar cases before but had never encountered something like this. In the past, if the celebrities were to have an affair, they would definitely be scolded like crazy.</p><br/><p>However, his brother wasn\u2019t being scolded. After being photographed in a picture like that, he actually got praised by people. How could the difference between him and other people be so great?</p><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue was stunned after seeing the comments online. Was she still on the same Earth?</p><br/><p>The public relations team was stunned. They realized that the highest form of public relations skill was to admit something and then get the netizens to clear the person\u2019s name.</p><br/><p>That was frightening!</p><br/><p>Ying Jin had actually been ecstatic but when she saw the comments on her Weibo account, she was stunned.</p><br/><p>That was so illogical!</p></div>\n</div>"}

Right now, I have to ask a big shot to help me handle things. You said that there were too many follow-up procedures, right? I have to get someone to help out. Otherwise, this poor man wouldn\u2019t be able to fork out the money.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan spoke to Wang Ming Yang over the phone for a while before hanging up. Then, he looked at the middle-aged man in front of him and smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201cSecretary Chen, you have to help me out with this. If you don\u2019t, even if I\u2019m sucked dry, I wouldn\u2019t be able to produce enough money,\u201d said Lin Fan with a smile.</p><br/><p>Right now, when Lin Fan came to look for a big shot, it was quite effective. At least this very-busy Secretary Chen would find the time to come and hear him out.</p><br/><p>After all, in Shanghai, this kind of big shot was not someone that anyone could see. His status was really very high.</p><br/><p>Secretary Chen looked at Master Lin and shook his head as he smiled. \u201cMaster Lin, you\u2019re building an apartment building. What\u2019s the use of looking for me? You have to look for those other departments.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shook his head. \u201cI have no choice. I don\u2019t even know who to look for that has the capability to do this. After thinking hard, I felt that it was best to look for Secretary Chen who always serves the people.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright. Since Master Lin has looked for me, I can\u2019t reject you. Tell me. What\u2019s the situation? But if you are thinking of any underhanded practices, it really can\u2019t be done,\u201d said Secretary Chen. However, he knew that Master Lin was definitely not that kind of person.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan instantly lit up. Then, he hurriedly said, \u201cThis is the situation. There\u2019s still a big empty space behind Nanshan Children\u2019s Welfare Institute. I want to build a fifty to sixty story high apartment building.\u201d</p><br/><p>Secretary Chen listened without interrupting. He knew about Nanshan Children\u2019s Welfare Institute. Ever since it had been taken over by Lin Fan, it was as if it had been given a new life. He had heard that Lin Fan had even personally hired teachers. This kind of matter was worthy of approval.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut after this fifty to sixty story apartment building is constructed, the money that has to be paid is a sky-high amount. I asked a friend to help me build this and I already owe a large enough amount. I\u2019m wondering if you could exempt us from these procedures,\u201d said Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, aren\u2019t you going to sell the apartments after building them? The money you\u2019ll get from that will be enough.\u201d Secretary Chen was suspicious. He wouldn\u2019t say much about selling the apartments built on Nanshan Children Welfare Institute\u2019s land. After all, that land belonged to the welfare institute itself.</p><br/><p>If all this money earned from selling the apartments were invested into the welfare institute, it would be best. He was just afraid that there would be too much money and that it would be used for embezzlement. If that were to happen, it wouldn\u2019t be good.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved his hand. \u201cThat\u2019s not the case. I\u2019m not selling the apartments. I\u2019m going to give the teachers one apartment each. And I\u2019m also going to have an agreement on the contract that they cannot sell those apartments. Those are only for the teachers to stay and they may stay there for their entire lives.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe remaining apartments will be kept for those children. When they grow old, they will have a place of dwelling. These children are already in less favorable conditions than those with families. As the person in charge of this welfare institute, I have the responsibility to prepare homes for them, so that they may stay with their significant others in the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThese will all not be for sale. They will always belong to the welfare institute. If the welfare institute has new children in the future, they will be allocated places when they grow up as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan spoke unceasingly. This kind of situation required the help of a big shot. If he couldn\u2019t find a big shot to help him, even though he was Master Lin, he wouldn\u2019t have the authority to change the rules.</p><br/><p>Secretary Chen listened very attentively. Then, he understood. \u201cMaster Lin, I understand your intention. If that\u2019s the case, I think I will help you. After all, this is a good deed and the intention is good. The children of the welfare institute would be able to have their own apartments while it remains the property of the welfare institute.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd when those children grow up in the future and have the ability, they can buy their own homes and pass down those apartments to the new generation of children. Not bad. That\u2019s a very good idea.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, I approve of this. I think it\u2019s great.\u201d</p><br/><p>Secretary Chen had never seen someone like Master Lin. He was so young, yet he had such a high level of awareness. It was a very good thing for Nanshan Children\u2019s Welfare Institute.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. \u201cYes, I think it\u2019s great too. Although there are many things that can still be improved, we can improve on those things as we follow up. But with regards to the taxes, I have to ask Secretary Chen to help us out.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, I can promise you and I can even sign an agreement with the government that these apartments will not be sold.\u201d</p><br/><p>Secretary Chen was silent for a moment as if he was considering it. \u201cOkay. Let me take care of this. This is considered a kind of reform as well. It is a step forward. Ever since Master Lin took over the children\u2019s welfare institute, you haven\u2019t received subsidies from the government. But regarding this matter, I fully approve of it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Wang, come in.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Wang, who had been waiting outside the whole time, came in hurriedly. Then, he nodded respectfully. \u201cSecretary.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPass down this message. Get all the leaders of the big units to come here for a meeting,\u201d said Secretary Chen.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Xiao Wang then left in a hurry. He was suspicious as he wondered what kind of meeting the Secretary wanted. At the same time, he was surprised. Why was Master Lin there?</p><br/><p>Could it be that something big had happened?</p><br/><p>Secretary Chen said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Master Lin. I\u2019ll hold a meeting right now and pass down the instructions to look after this matter. Also, we\u2019ll endorse this decision. By tomorrow latest, I\u2019ll give you a satisfactory outcome. However, it\u2019s not that I don\u2019t trust Master Lin but the contract still has to be signed for a future guarantee.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded with a smile and immediately stood up. \u201cThank you for your help, Secretary Chen. On behalf of 365 children, I thank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Secretary Chen smiled. \u201cNo need to thank me. I just hope that Master Lin can stay in Shanghai for longer. Oh right, Master Lin, have you bought an apartment for yourself yet? Recently, we\u2019ve started a project. We\u2019re giving apartments to talented people in Shanghai. If Master Lin ever wants to keep staying in Shanghai, I can sign you up for it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled. Of course, he could see through his intention. Secretary Chen wanted Lin Fan to keep staying in Shanghai.</p><br/><p>However, Lin Fan had already promised his parents that he would return after staying in Shanghai for a few years. Still, no one could say for sure how things would turn out in the future.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you for the goodwill, Secretary. Let\u2019s talk about this again in the future,\u201d replied Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Secretary Chen didn\u2019t say more and just nodded. Then, he sent Lin Fan off to the entrance before turning back and chuckling to himself. It was as if he had never expected something like this.</p><br/><p>But he felt that it was pretty good.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was in a brilliant mood after leaving the compound. He quickly gave Wang Ming Yang call to report this piece of good news.</p></div>\n</div>"}

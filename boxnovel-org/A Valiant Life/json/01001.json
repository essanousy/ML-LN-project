Lin Fan followed behind him. Looking at Elder Dog, Lin Fan couldn\u2019t help but shake his head helplessly.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s out!\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone\u2019s hearts shifted as they looked at Elder Dog unblinkingly.</p><br/><p>On the Internet.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, Elder Dog has come out. His posture is way too domineering.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s as if he knows that he has gotten an award. His expression is so dignified.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Dog is so formidable. I\u2019m a fan of yours!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI was wrong. I shouldn\u2019t have doubted this dog. It is way too brave. Even humans wouldn\u2019t have dared to do what he did.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph, don\u2019t ever doubt Elder Dog. Elder Dog is an unimaginable being.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, Master Lin is following behind Elder Dog. He\u2019s depending on his dog to gain glory.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBullsh*t. Actually, Master Lin\u2019s deeds should have gotten him the award as well but I don\u2019t know why he didn\u2019t get it.\u201d</p><br/><p>The host was slightly stunned. Then, he walked over. This was the first time he had seen such a situation and it was also his first time welcoming a non-human as one of Touching China\u2019s Top Ten People.</p><br/><p>In the middle of the stage, there were three chairs. There was a coffee table with a flower pot on top.</p><br/><p>Elder Dog sat on a chair himself, while Lin Fan and the host sat on a chair each too.</p><br/><p>The host started to speak, \u201cMaster Lin, what do you think about your pet dog?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing the host\u2019s question, Lin Fan wanted to say that this dog was f*cking lowly. But in this situation, if he said that, Elder Dog might start fighting with him.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s very good. We have a very close relationship. It is fate that I met him. When I drove to a rural area back then, I stopped the car there. This dog, that wasn\u2019t so big back then, ran over out of nowhere. He raised his leg and urinated on my car tyre.\u201d Lin Fan was describing Elder Dog\u2019s size back then using his hands. When he thought about the past, he started laughing.</p><br/><p>The audience below the stage was laughing cheerily as well. At first, they had disapproved of this dog getting the award but after they had seen the video, they were filled with curiosity as they wondered what else this dog had done.</p><br/><p>The host said, \u201cActually, when we found out about this dog, we were exceptionally curious. We wondered why a dog would do such a thing. Later on, we did more research and discovered that it has done many things that us humans may not even be able to do.\u201d</p><br/><p>This was the script that the host had prepared beforehand. The host had already memorized it.</p><br/><p>At that moment, a video appeared on the screen. These videos were not very clear and some of them were very short.</p><br/><p>It seemed that they had been taken using surveillance cameras as well as phone cameras of passers by.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan watched for a while. He hadn\u2019t expected that Elder Dog had actually done so many things.</p><br/><p>To the people in front of their televisions, this seemed way too unreal. Some of them were completely stunned.</p><br/><p>To them, this was not even a dog anymore. How could a dog be so awesome?</p><br/><p>The host was shocked beyond compare as well but he maintained his cool. \u201cJumping into the water to save a life, taking down gangsters, chasing a thief, such incidents are too many. We are very curious. How did you nurture him?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was taken aback. This question was quite difficult. If Lin Fan told them how he had raised him, it would scare everyone.</p><br/><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t done much to nurture him. I can see that that he is clever and righteous. He occasionally does good deeds, so I just encourage him at times.\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Dog just sat there as he kept his head raised without a single expression or a single change in his posture. He looked very dignified. This posture of his made the people watching laugh out loud.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan really didn\u2019t know how to answer that question. He had nurtured Elder Dog using his pills as well as his animal training knowledge. But if he were to say that, people would be scared to death. Right now, he could only say these things to attribute it to Elder Dog\u2019s innate gifts, saying that he was different from other dogs.</p><br/><p>On the Internet.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn. Master Lin is so lucky. He even met such a dog. If I met a dog like that, how great would that be?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBrothers, if anyone still dares to say that mutts aren\u2019t good in the future, I\u2019ll slap you. Look at how great Elder Dog is.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have a feeling that mutts will overtake some of the popular dogs after today.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat might really be possible.\u201d</p><br/><p>In the hospital.</p><br/><p>When Zhou Jun heard the voices coming from the video, he was completely dumbfounded. He had a blank look on his face. <em>Is that still a f*cking dog?</em></p><br/><p><em>That\u2019s a dog that will go crazy and bite people. You\u2019ve all been fooled! It\u2019s a mad dog!</em></p><br/><p>Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, Elder dog is receiving the award.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t I believe Little Boss\u2019s words?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t believe it then. These are just words to trick those people.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLook at that proud look on Elder Dog\u2019s face. He really understands humans too well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSigh. why didn\u2019t I raise a poodle? Sister Hong is really too lucky.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sister Hong, who was sitting at the side, was smiling so much that her eyes had formed a single line. Needless to say, she was elated.</p><br/><p>The programme continued. Then, the host returned to the stage and announced.</p><br/><p>\u201cOne of Touching China\u2019s Top Ten People, Elder Dog!\u201d</p><br/><p>The place was filled with thunderous applause. Some of the people who still had doubts before had now been convinced. To them, this simply defied all logic. These were things that humans wouldn\u2019t even be able to do.</p><br/><p>But now that a dog had done these things, it deserved the award. There was no dispute.</p><br/><p>Two children went on stage, a boy and a girl. They held the trophy as well as flowers as they walked over with their big, round eyes which were fixated on the doggy. They appeared to be very curious.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan received the trophy and flowers. Then, a stone plaque appeared with Elder Dog\u2019s name carved onto it. It looked very domineering.</p><br/><p>\u201cUncle, can we touch the doggy?\u201d asked the children.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course you can.\u201d Lin Fan nodded.</p><br/><p>The two children squatted down cheerily and patted Elder Dog\u2019s head. Meanwhile, Elder Dog still kept his dignified face. Even with these little hands that kept shaking his face around, he maintained his expression.</p><br/><p>When the audience saw this scene, they all gasped in their hearts. <em>This dog is so human-like!</em></p><br/><p>After touching him for a while, the two children felt that this doggy was very cute but they prepared to leave the stage reluctantly.</p><br/><p>When the children were about to to go off the stage, a sound suddenly rang out from the ceiling.</p><br/><p>*Kacha!*</p><br/><p>A lamp suddenly detached from the ceiling and, as if someone had planned it, started falling towards the two children.</p><br/><p>Some of the people who were sitting nearby were shocked awake.</p><br/><p>\u201cRun!\u201d</p><br/><p>But they weren\u2019t going to make it in time. The audience was too far away and this lamp was quite big.</p><br/><p>They couldn\u2019t imagine what would happen if the lamp landed on the children.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan furrowed his brows. Just as he was about to make a move, a figure soared past him.</p><br/><p><em>F*ck, Elder Dog. You really want to steal all the spotlight today.</em></p><br/><p>\u2026</p></div>\n</div>"}

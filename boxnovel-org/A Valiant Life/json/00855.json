To be able to talk to the people overseas from Stanford University makes any hardship worthwhile,\u201d Director Chen was about 50 years old and was highly capable. His trip overseas went very smoothly this time around. Although it was a little time-consuming, he did not care because he had succeeded.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, Director Chen. Looks like something has happened at the school.\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Chen was stunned. He said, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou should take a look. It looks like the students have organized a movement request for one of the students from the school to be expelled. Even Master Lin from Cloud Street has gotten involved.\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Chen was very familiar with the name Master Lin. He said, \u201cMaster Lin? Is it Master Lin from the Chinese Arts Association?\u201d</p><br/><p>He loved classical literature, poems, and paintings. He had specially made a trip down to the Beijing museum to see the artworks. When he first saw them, he was stunned by the unique masterpieces.</p><br/><p>As a result, he was very curious about Master Lin and wanted to get to know him. Although Master Lin was young, he was able to create such masterpieces, he must have had some profound kind of training.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, it\u2019s that Master Lin. He is already at the school now, confronting the students as well as the teachers.\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Chen waved his hand and then looked at the video. He was watching and walking at the same, trying to rush back to the school.</p><br/><p>He was only gone for half a month, how could such a thing happen?</p><br/><p>In the car.</p><br/><p>Director Chen had already understood the situation and his complexion was very unsightly. He said, \u201cPreposterous, absolutely preposterous. Jin He University was established 60 years ago and in all its time, it has never had anything like this before. Who approved this? Who agreed to have this student expelled?\u201d</p><br/><p>His tone was very serious and he was furious.</p><br/><p>The staff members with him admired him in their hearts and they said, \u201cDirector, it was Headmaster Yang who made the decision.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYang Min? What power does he have to make this decision? Since Jin He University was established, its goal has been to educate students. Even if the students commit some big mistakes, we will, according to the situation, still give them a chance to turn over a new leaf. Right now, this student is going to be expelled merely because her appearance is a little frightening? I want to ask, who is the one who caused this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDirector Chen, the student is called Jin Shan Ping. She had this change of appearance because three years ago, her neighbor\u2019s house caught fire and she went in to save her neighbor\u2019s child.</p><br/><p>When Director Chen heard this, he was even more furious. He said, \u201cThis sort of student with such virtues is exactly what Jin He University is looking for. She did not receive any commendation and is even going to be expelled? Drive faster. I want to quickly see who is the one who had the nerve to do something like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGot it,\u201d the driver said as he drove even faster.</p><br/><p>Even as a driver, when he heard about this situation, he was very angry inside as well. He never thought that there would actually be students like that in a school. But the thing that confused him, even more, was the actions of the school\u2019s headmaster. He could not understand why he would agree such a request by the students, causing trouble with no reason.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>At Jin He University.</p><br/><p>Jin Shan Ping was very grateful to see Master Lin and the rest of them. However, at that moment, she stood up and said, \u201cMaster Lin, don\u2019t argue with them anymore. I\u2019m willing to drop out.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I won\u2019t allow that,\u201d Lin Fan waved her off and said.</p><br/><p><em>Even if I don\u2019t settle this thing today, I, Master Lin, will keep dragging this on.</em></p><br/><p>Also, the surrounding students also called out.</p><br/><p>\u201cStudent Jin, don\u2019t drop out. We still love you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. We don\u2019t feel like you are distracting us. We are willing to be friends with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>The rowdy students saw the scene unfolding in front of their eyes and could not help hooting.</p><br/><p>\u201cJin Shan Ping, if I were you, I definitely would not stay here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you guys trying to do? She is already willing to drop out by herself.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Jin Shan Ping stood up and said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry my fellow students. Because of me, you guys have to live in horror. I understand the situation and I am willing to drop out so that I won\u2019t scare you guys anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, she turned around and bowed towards Lin Fan and the rest of them and said, \u201cThank you Master Lin and the rest of the students. I\u2019ve already thought it through, I\u2019m going to drop out. Thanks for your help.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI said that I won\u2019t allow that,\u201d Lin Fan said. He was furious. Then he looked at the group of rowdy students and said, \u201cF*ck your mothers, you pieces of trash. I\u2019m really itching to make all of you guys crippled. I never thought that there would actually be students like you guys in schools, it\u2019s really disgusting.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, Mr. Lin? Don\u2019t think that just because you have some fame that we will all be scared of you. What wrong do we even have in this issue? We were the ones who were frightened by her.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. Why don\u2019t you take a look online and see how many people are also frightened by her?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The arguing on the scene was never-ending.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was feeling f*cked on the inside. He really wanted to hammer these students to death. However, he controlled himself.</p><br/><p><em>Don\u2019t do anything rash. Calm down. I won\u2019t give up until this situation is resolved.</em></p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you guys doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, a shout of rage came from the distance.</p><br/><p>Everyone saw the person that was coming and was stunned.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Director Chen.\u201d</p><br/><p>The headmaster saw Director Chen and was stunned as well. He did not think that the director had come back already.</p><br/><p>Initially, this was also just a small issue and they could have taken care of it. It would never have reached the level of which the director would have been alerted.</p><br/><p>Director Chen\u2019s expression was very solemn as he walked towards them. The moment he reached the school, he had heard all the words of the rowdy students. If he did not personally hear them himself, he would not have dared to believe that it was from his own students.</p><br/><p>Then he looked at Lin Fan and immediately walked towards him and extended his hand. He said, \u201cHello Master Lin. I am the director of Jin He University. I went overseas to do some work and I just got back. Regarding this situation, I\u2019m really sorry to have ridiculed you through this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan originally wanted to express his dissatisfaction towards the director but upon seeing his expression, he could sense his intentions. Thus, he calmed down and nodded. He said, \u201cDirector Chen, Jin He University has been a disappointment. Although it is not some hundreds-over-years-old famous school, but it is still quite prestigious in the circle of universities.</p><br/><p>Director Chen kept apologizing. This was all his fault. He did not even need to think about this issue. He definitely would not agree to expel a student for such a small reason.</p><br/><p>Yang Min rushed over and said, \u201cDirector, this issue\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Chen glared at him and did not say a word. Then, he looked at the students who were holding the banner and then looked at the teachers and said, \u201cRecord down the names of all these students.\u201d</p><br/><p>The teachers definitely could not defy the words of the director.</p><br/><p>Han Yan opened her mouth and spoke, \u201cDirector, we object to this. Her being in this school is severely affecting our ability to study. We request that she be expelled.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right director. We object.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you want her then we will leave. If you want us, then she has to leave.\u201d</p><br/><p>The group of ret*rds still did not understand the situation. They thought that just because they had strength in numbers, they could do anything.</p><br/><p>The teachers passed him the names that they had recorded down.</p><br/><p>Director Chen glanced at it and then was very bitter as he said, \u201cEver since Jin He University was established, we have strived to educate students as well as govern them with rules equally. Regardless of whether the students are rich or poor, as long as they have the heart for learning, Jin He University will always welcome them. However, in the face of people with huge deficiencies in moral quality, regardless of whether they are the top scorer or have obtained how many awards, Jin He University won\u2019t accept them. Thus, with regards to your request, I\u2019m telling you guys that the student Jin Shan Ping will be staying here. As for you guys, I\u2019m here, giving you guys formal notice that you guys have been expelled. Your actions have been disgraceful and hateful.\u201d</p><br/><p>When that sentence was said, the headmaster was thoroughly dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>The faces of the rowdy students were as white as ghosts. The arrogant looks on their faces were long gone.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to leave the school. I was wrong. I was just joining in the fun, I didn\u2019t really want her to leave the school.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDirector, please give us another chance.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t be expelled. I\u2019ll get beaten to death.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBoo Hoo! Director, please don\u2019t do this, don\u2019t expel us.\u201d</p><br/><p>Some of the teachers urgently said, \u201cDirector, one of the students here is an International Mathematics Competition champion, you see\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Chen did not even give it a second thought and just waved them off and said, \u201cWe don\u2019t need this type of champion.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, he went in front of Jin Shan Ping and said, \u201cStudent Jin, I\u2019m very sorry. The school has never discriminated against anyone before. I hope that you don\u2019t have any prejudice against the school.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jin Shan Ping stood rooted to the spot, dumbfounded. She still could not grasp what was going on.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan raised up his thumb and said, \u201cDirector Chen, you really have the greatest conscience out of all the directors in the academic world.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, if I am the first director you have seen with a conscience, then it is really the grievance of the academic world. Without you Master Lin, I\u2019m afraid that the situation would have spiraled into a stage where it would not be controllable,\u201d Director Chen forced a smile and said.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed and said, \u201cDirector Chen, this situation really doesn\u2019t concern me at all. If I did not come here, you would have peacefully settled this issue.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, I really pity that Student Jin,\u201d Director Chen said.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cActually, I have another reason for coming here. I feel that I can restore this Student Jin\u2019s face back to normal.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan said this, the people next to him were all stunned.</p><br/><p>Jin Shan Ping looked at Lin Fan with even more disbelief. It was as if she did not believe what he said.</p><br/><p>As for the students who were protesting just now, their faces were all completely white and they were crying for their parents. They really did not think that they would be expelled.</p><br/><p>The female goddess Han Yan was so scared, she couldn\u2019t even speak.</p><br/><p>At the same time, the students who were watching on were all clapping in excitement. They had a huge amount of resentment towards those rowdy students and right now, their retribution had come. It made them feel a great amount of pleasure inside.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p></div>\n</div>"}

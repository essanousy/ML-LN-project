Those that were unsupportive of Elder Dog receiving the award and those that recognized Elder Dog\u2019s marvelous feats all stood up.</p><br/><p>What had just happened was simply too brilliant. Watching it in person was even more impactful than watching in on video.</p><br/><p>After this incident, they truly understood that Elder Dog was really brave and just. He had actually reacted to the dangerous situation before everyone else.</p><br/><p>The staff in charge at the backstage was also shocked. However, he shouted, \u201cWho the hell set up this venue? Do you know what would have happened if Elder Dog wasn\u2019t here?\u201d</p><br/><p>The other employees didn\u2019t dare to reply to that.</p><br/><p>The people that had set up the lights almost fainted.

Those that hadn\u2019t watched the award ceremony last night felt that it was too unrealistic. In order to see what had happened, they went to watch a replay of the ceremony.</p><br/><p>Cloud Street!</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan brought Elder Dog to the shop, the other shop owners rushed over in respect for what had happened the previous night.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Boss, Elder Dog is too awesome.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, all the news articles online are about Elder Dog now.

I think he used a lot of force to do that.\u201d</p><br/><p>In response to that, Lin Fan looked at Elder Dog who was at the entrance of the shop. Then, he pointed, \u201cLook at him, does he look like he is injured?\u201d</p><br/><p>Perhaps even a bullet wouldn\u2019t even graze the skin of Elder Dog; not to mention a collision of that sort.</p><br/><p>After consuming Righteous Dog Food for such a long time, Elder Dog\u2019s abilities were nature-defying. However, he didn\u2019t have any crazy magical skills yet. Lin Fan was afraid that Elder Dog would cause some trouble if he were to possess those skills.</p><br/><p>The shop owners surrounded Elder Dog and embraced him.</p><br/><p>Elder Dog looked at them and rolled his eyes. Then, he continued to lie down at the entrance. He was already used to the attention he was getting. How could these stupid humans understand the true power of Elder Dog?</p><br/><p>The townsfolk that were there to buy scallion pancakes were really interested in Elder Dog. Many of them had watched the live telecast the previous night. They felt that it was extraordinary for a dog to be so intelligent.</p><br/><p>When he finished making the scallion pancakes, Lin Fan lay down on the bench and wanted to take a rest. He felt a little hurt after Elder Dog stole the limelight.</p><br/><p>His deeds had been forgotten for the first time just because of a dog.</p><br/><p>*Ding ding!*</p><br/><p>His phone rang.</p><br/><p>He answered.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello, Master Lin, I am a director and we have a script. We would like to invite Elder Dog to be the main actor, the price\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>*beep*</p><br/><p>Lin Fan immediately hung up the phone.

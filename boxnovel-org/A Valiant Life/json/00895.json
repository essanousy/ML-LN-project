According to estimates, the value of this prescription is over a billion. It is considered a priceless treasure.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018What kind of person is Master Lin? He disregards a billion dollars of value and chooses to publicize the prescription.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018The admirable Master Lin. You have to respect him.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Conquered by Master Lin, Leukemia becomes a thing of the past.\u2019</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-2\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u2018Many hospitals speak out in protest, saying that this leaves them with no way to go.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Sufferers who have applied the first stage of treatment say that their bodies instantly feel better.\u2019</p><br/><p>In just one night, the news on the Internet was completely filled with such reports.</p><br/><p>And the netizens were in intense discussion, mainly because this incident was too shocking. If they hadn\u2019t seen it for themselves, none of them would believe it.</p><br/><p>Also, many people were in sincere admiration of Master Lin. Who else would be able to do such a thing?</p><br/><p>To release such a highly-valued prescription to the public, it wasn\u2019t something that just anyone could do.</p><br/><p>Even if it wasn\u2019t just anyone, people would probably still be unable to do it.</p><br/><p>Cloud Street.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-3\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Fraud Tian\u2019s mouth was gaping. His whole body was trembling. He waved Zhao Zhong Yang over. \u201cCome over here for a moment. What is this article saying? A billion dollars? That kid just publicized something worth a billion dollars?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang took a look. \u201cThese are just blind words from the reporters.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian breathed out in relief. \u201cThat\u2019s what I was thinking, that couldn\u2019t have been possible\u2026\u201d But before he finished, Zhao Zhong Yang continued speaking.</p><br/><p>\u201cI feel that it\u2019s not just a billion. I just did some research. Right now, there are three to four million leukemia sufferers in the nation. That\u2019s a huge number, isn\u2019t it? If the prescription fetches sixty or seventy thousand from each sufferer, it wouldn\u2019t be too expensive, would it? That makes the value above a billion already. Moreover, the number of people contracting leukemia every year is in tens of thousands. And that\u2019s just within our country. Just think about how much money that is.\u201d Zhao Zhong Yang was also in such admiration of Brother Lin that he would kneel down to him.</p><br/><p>Just with a small action, an unlimited wealth had been tossed away.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026\u201d Fraud Tian\u2019s jaw dropped. He was completely stupefied. He hadn\u2019t expected that that would be the case.</p><br/><p><em>So much money. That\u2019s probably more than I\u2019ve ever seen in my life.</em></p><br/><p>Wu Tian He, who had been sitting there the whole time, was sighing as well. He hadn\u2019t expected Master Lin to have such a big heart. This was something that common people could never imagine.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan was happier than anyone else as she smiled because her Brother Lin was becoming more and more amazing.</p><br/><p>A certain production team.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-4\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>As Wu Huan Yue was resting, she took out her phone and looked at the news.</p><br/><p>She was now developing into a celebrity of the stage, screen, and video. The TV show that she was filming now was a popular one, although she wasn\u2019t the playing the lead female but rather, she was playing a supporting role. Now, the filming had temporarily stopped and she was sitting in the resting area, looking at her phone.</p><br/><p>She would never let go of any news involving Brother Lin. Especially a while ago, her heart had been filled with anxiety, wondering how her Brother Lin was doing.</p><br/><p>But today, when she saw the news, she beamed brilliantly.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuan Yue, what are you looking at?\u201d another supporting actress, a young lady, came over and asked curiously.</p><br/><p>\u201cNothing much. I\u2019m just looking at the news,\u201d said Wu Huan Yue.</p><br/><p>When the young lady took a look at the phone, she realized that Huan Yue was reading news related to Master Lin. She knew that Wu Huan Yue had a unique relationship with Master Lin because the songs that Wu Huan Yue sang were all composed by Master Lin. The songs had all been personally composed for her. This was something that many people were envious of.</p><br/><p>Moreover, the company supporting Wu Huan Yue was very powerful as well. It was completely impossible for there to be any dirty tricks against her.</p><br/><p>The young lady said emotionally, \u201cHuan Yue, could you introduce me to Master Lin next time?\u201d</p><br/><p>She had seen the recent news too and she was also in awe of this Master Lin. He was simply too awesome.</p><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue didn\u2019t know this young lady too well. She just said with a smile, \u201cIf there\u2019s a chance in the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>This was a tactful way of declining. Of course, she didn\u2019t want to introduce Brother Lin to this young lady.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-5\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Especially because this young lady was obviously trying to get into a relationship with Brother Lin.</p><br/><p>Then, she didn\u2019t say much else. She just lowered her head as she read the news, her eyes beaming with adoration.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Health Department.</p><br/><p>Everyone had gathered to have a meeting again.</p><br/><p>But this time, the atmosphere was a little stifling, as if a lion was about to awaken and explode in rage.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is the current situation. The leukemia prescription has been publicized. Many hospitals are voicing out their disapproval.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust how does this Master Lin think? He actually publicized the prescription. Could it be that he doesn\u2019t know the importance of this prescription?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no use in grumbling about all this now. The prescription has already been publicized. Every leukemia sufferer can already buy medicine for their own treatment themselves now. To them, there\u2019s no use in visiting hospitals anymore.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-6\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Everyone was discussing and grumbling about what had been on Master Lin\u2019s mind. This prescription that had taken so much effort to develop had been publicized just like that. Just what was he trying to prove?</p><br/><p>At that moment, the boss spoke, \u201cI heard that this Master Lin received his medical qualifications without being accessed before.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. Because Zhao Ming Qing is his student, the department didn\u2019t access him and just gave him his certifications.\u201d</p><br/><p>The boss had a calm expression on his face. He raised his cup. \u201cThis Zhao Ming Qing\u2019s thinking isn\u2019t appropriate\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>When these profound words entered everyone else\u2019s ears, they were all analyzing it. Their boss was furious.</p><br/><p>But how could he not be furious? He wasn\u2019t the only one either. All of them were feeling angry too.</p><br/><p>This was outrageous. Simply outrageous.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, the meeting shall end here.\u201d The boss didn\u2019t want to say anything else. What had been done had been done. What else could they do?</p><br/><p>Once the prescription had been publicized, its value had vanished completely. If he kept on thinking about it, he would make himself sick.</p><br/><p>After the meeting ended.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-7\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Everyone gathered to discuss. It seemed that they were trying to analyze what their boss\u2019s last words meant.</p><br/><p>\u2018Zhao Ming Qing\u2019s thinking isn\u2019t appropriate.\u2019</p><br/><p>This was an interesting line. Zhao Ming Qing was a person in an organization. Moreover, he was the Academy Director of the Chinese Medical Academy, which was a pretty good appointment.</p><br/><p>He had even participated in the development of the leukemia prescription.</p><br/><p>But what their boss had said seemed to express discontent towards Zhao Ming Qing.</p><br/><p>Their daily job wasn\u2019t to do their work well or what not, but rather, they had to carefully analyze their boss\u2019s every word, because to them, even if they did their work particularly well, it wouldn\u2019t make any difference. The only way they would be able to promote was to analyze their boss\u2019s words clearly.</p><br/><p>Analyzing those words layer by layer, their meaning slowly changed.</p><br/><p>\u201cBoss said it, Zhao Ming Qing\u2019s thinking isn\u2019t acceptable.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cZhao Ming Qing is causing our leader to be very unhappy. We have to suppress him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLeader thinks that Zhao Ming Qing isn\u2019t suitable for his current appointment. Something needs to change.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone was analyzing those words. The final meaning that they arrived at would be the final result.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-8\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div></div>\n</div>"}

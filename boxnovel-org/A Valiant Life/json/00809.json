He never thought that Zhenping Yiming would give up and leave the court like that. In his years as a professional, he had never seen this happen before.</p><br/><p>\u201cHost, do we continue with this program?\u201d Lin Fan said as he looked on helplessly.</p><br/><p>The competition wasn\u2019t over yet, and Lin Fan had just made the decision to throw the game. However, looking at his current circumstances, he couldn\u2019t do it.</p><br/><p>The host took up his microphone, awkwardly saying a few words into it, \u201cMy fellow spectators, we have a little holdup over here, please give us a moment.\u201d</p><br/><p>Both the spectators in the arena and the netizens watching the live broadcast online all started laughing.</p><br/><p>From their point of view, this was hilarious news and was something refreshing for the eyes.</p><br/><p><em>Continue showing off and be arrogant.</em></p><br/><p><em>This is what you get.</em></p><br/><p>Lin Fan shrugged his shoulders as he heaved a sigh of helplessness, \u201cHost, I had nothing to do with this. I didn\u2019t think that this friend over here wouldn\u2019t have been able to take this. If I knew it would be like this, I would have agreed to do this in the first place.\u201d</p><br/><p>The host looked at Master Lin and felt that it was Zhenping Yiming\u2019s misfortune to have faced off against Master Lin. This was especially so after seeing Master Lin\u2019s innocent expression- no one could pin any blame on him. However, the main thing now was to bring the program to a whole completion.</p><br/><p>Backstage.</p><br/><p>President Liu was wanted to laugh so badly, but as the President, he had to present a professional image.</p><br/><p>\u201cMr. Zhenping, are you alright? What happened? The program isn\u2019t over yet,\u201d President Liu consoled him, his face looking on helplessly.</p><br/><p>From the start, this player had been acting arrogantly as if he was a huge deal, and as the President of the TV network, he almost fainted from his anger, since he behavior was just more trouble for the Shanghai Satellite TV Network. However, everything was good now.</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t act arrogant anymore in the face of Master Lin and couldn\u2019t react to any of his shots.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, no, I\u2019m not going out there again. I want to go back to Japan,\u201d Zhenping Yiming shook his head, wanting to leave this terrifying place.</p><br/><p>His spirit had been totally crushed since he got thrashed in the area that he was the best in.</p><br/><p>President Liu felt helpless after hearing what Zhenping Yiming said. He couldn\u2019t just cut the program like this halfway while airing it.</p><br/><p>\u201cMr. Zhenping, please don\u2019t worry. We won\u2019t play table tennis anymore. We are just going to communicate.\u201d</p><br/><p>President Liu\u2019s priority right now was to get Zhenping Yiming back into the arena. If he didn\u2019t, it would be a very awkward situation.</p><br/><p>It was even more so since the Shanghai Satellite TV Network placed a lot of emphasis on harmony and friendship in this program. How could they just bully their international friend like this?</p><br/><p>If word of this got out, apart from getting laughed at, people would say that the Shanghai Satellite TV Network was just out to bully people.</p><br/><p>In the arena.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan stood there, as the people in the audience started cheering. The scene that happened just now was just too exciting and entertaining.</p><br/><p>So much so that they all started cheering.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan tried to hush them as he looked on in helplessness, \u201cEveryone, please keep quiet. This is all a misunderstanding. If I knew that he was no match for me, I would never have played like this. To tell the truth, I have played with Xu Song before and the match was rather close. Since our international friend here beat Xu Song, I thought that he might be a good fight for me, but\u2026 sigh.\u201d</p><br/><p>The people in the audience all sighed, thinking that Master Lin was just boasting at this point.</p><br/><p>The national team.</p><br/><p>Xu Song looked on awkwardly, \u201cDon\u2019t look at me, I\u2019ve never met Master Lin in my life, so how could I have played with him before?\u201d</p><br/><p>The coach smiled at him, \u201cAlright, alright. Master Lin is helping you build your public image. A lot of people online were disappointed with your loss to Zhenping Yiming, and Master Lin is helping you get out of public opinion.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut I really never imagined that Master Lin would be this strong. I think that no one can match against him at all.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. Although I wasn\u2019t there to see him play, I could see from the TV that his service was extraordinary and unparalleled. More importantly, Master Lin\u2019s reaction time was monstrous. He didn\u2019t even move his legs and just stood there returning Zhenping Yiming\u2019s shots. Zhenping Yiming didn\u2019t even stand a chance against him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf Master Lin joined our national team, we would win every single competition. The male single\u2019s championship title would be outs.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI think he shouldn\u2019t join our team. If he really joined us, our national table tennis team would definitely be banned from participating in the Olympics.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>At the arena.</p><br/><p>Zhenping Yiming still hadn\u2019t gone on stage yet.</p><br/><p>The host couldn\u2019t just keep the program on hold like this, and so he started interviewing Lin Fan. \u201cTeacher Lin, when did you start playing table tennis? Your skills are just so amazing!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally? Are my skills that good?\u201d Lin Fan looked at him in shock.</p><br/><p>The host looked back, dumbfounded. Was he kidding?</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, if I may say, I\u2019ve never seen anyone of your caliber before. If you went professional. I think that the gold medal would easily be yours.\u201d</p><br/><p>The crowd went wild and cheered on in agreement after hearing the host say that.</p><br/><p>With Master Lin\u2019s skills, he could easily defeat anyone.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh? I guess I better not go pro then. If it is as you say, that the gold medal would easily be mine, who would want to watch the competition? There won\u2019t be any suspense.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn any competition, there are winners and losers. That is what makes the competition fun to watch. If there isn\u2019t any suspense, there won\u2019t be any meaning to that anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>The host laughed at him, \u201cWhat you said does make sense. Right, just now you said that you played with Xu Song a few times before. Are you two close?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say that we are that close. I play table tennis with him sometime in my dreams.\u201d</p><br/><p>In the broadcast room.</p><br/><p>\u201c666\u2026, this is really lonely. He can only find a match in his dreams.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn, if I didn\u2019t watch this program today, I would never have known that Master Lin\u2019s table tennis skills were that good. It\u2019s just so scary.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, Master Lin\u2019s is really funny, playing table tennis with Xu Song in his dreams. If he really played with Xu Song in real life, I don\u2019t even think that Xu Song could match him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Not long after, Zhenping Yiming came back into the arena.</p><br/><p>No one knew how President Liu managed to convince him, but he did it anyway.</p><br/><p>President Liu heaved a sigh of relief. He couldn\u2019t cut the program halfway no matter what.</p><br/><p>Although there was a little hiccup in the middle, it wasn\u2019t much of a problem. The live broadcast room was packed with people and Shanghai Satellite TV\u2019s Weibo was swamped with comments.</p><br/><p>Zhenping Yiming stepped back into the arena, his face looking fearfully at Lin Fan. He didn\u2019t even dare to look at the ping-pong ball anymore.</p><br/><p>He was traumatized.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled as he extended out his hands, \u201cInternational friend, this is a friendly competition, so don\u2019t worry too much about it. I look forward to seeing you in the international arena.\u201d</p><br/><p>The host translated what Lin Fan said for Zhenping Yiming.</p><br/><p>After hearing what the host had translated, his whole body trembled as the color drained from his face, \u201cNo\u2026no\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhenping Yiming had probably misunderstood Lin Fan\u2019s statement. What Lin Fan actually meant was that he looked forward to watching him play in the international arena. However, Zhenping Yiming had interpreted it differently, thinking that Lin Fan wanted to play with him in the international arena.</p><br/><p>He thought back to how he couldn\u2019t even return a single shot from Lin Fan before.</p><br/><p><em>If I played with him in the international arena, it would just mean more humiliation.</em></p><br/><p>At this moment, fear gripped him in his heart.</p><br/><p>He even thought of giving up playing table tennis and changing his profession.</p></div>\n</div>"}

Heroes start from young indeed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Huang looked at Lin Fan and couldn\u2019t help but sigh. He had lived to such an old age but he had never come across a young man like this. It was way too astonishing.</p><br/><p>This young man knew every style of martial art and, with one look, he could tell that this President Lin was adept at all of them. Moreover, it seemed as if he had inherited them completely without any lacking aspects.</p><br/><p>To anyone from any school of martial art, this was impossible. Through the course of time and the inevitable chaos of war, they would be lucky to inherit just eighty percent of the original techniques.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re too courteous, Elder Huang.\u201d Lin Fan waved his hand calmly. He was already used to such praises and he wasn\u2019t moved at all.</p><br/><p>After all, he was someone who had experienced many things. In the past, perhaps he would have been slightly excited after receiving praise. But now, he couldn\u2019t even get excited at all.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Zhao Zhong Yang was holding his phone and broadcasting this scene.</p><br/><p>His Internet buddies felt that this scene was above them. It wasn\u2019t something that they would be able to experience.</p><br/><p>However, this broadcast had let them see it plainly and clearly.</p><br/><p>\u201cPresident Lin, you said that you know everything. Is that true? You know too that the current Chinese martial arts are not complete. To be able to have them passed down through the generations is already a very difficult thing,\u201d said Elder Huang. He was very troubled by this matter.</p><br/><p>After all, martial arts were the embodiment of the essence of their predecessors.</p><br/><p>They had gone through countless practice to slowly mold the martial arts into what they were.</p><br/><p>Right now, if they wanted to make the martial arts whole again, it would simply be an idiot\u2019s dream. If they were to go out and look for fights, they would probably spend half their lives in hospitals or in prison.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled and said, \u201cElder Huang, I know that. But there are too many people here. I\u2019m afraid it will be able to make all their martial arts whole now. If it\u2019s possible, they could go to the Shanghai association to look for me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not doing it now?\u201d Elder Huang was taken aback. It was as if he hadn\u2019t expected this.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Huang, how could I do it now? You know too how many people there are here. How could I do so much in such a short period of time? Why don\u2019t you get them to look for me at the Shanghai Martial Arts Association when they\u2019re free?\u201d said Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>At the same time, he had some other intentions. He wanted these guys to go to the association and become members. Then, he would give them random positions to affiliate them to the Shanghai association. That would be pretty good.</p><br/><p>But thinking about it, if that were to happen, the Beijing headquarters would not be able to catch up to the Shanghai association. That would be quite interesting.</p><br/><p>Elder Huang nodded as he felt that it made sense. There were several hundred people here. If he were to resolve them one by one, it would take at least half a month.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Lin Fan\u2019s gaze shifted to those who were sitting at the dining tables and looking this way.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you guys think this is fine?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. No problem at all,\u201d someone immediately replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. We\u2019re not far from Shanghai. It would be good to pay a visit to the Shanghai association too. Then, we\u2019d be able to interact with President Lin properly. No, I should say that we\u2019d be able to seek President Lin\u2019s guidance.\u201d</p><br/><p>To them, being able to complete their martial art techniques was very exciting. And Lin Fan\u2019s favor to them was not a simple one. It was a great kindness to them and they couldn\u2019t overlook that.</p><br/><p>When Jiang Fei heard those words, he was thrilled. If that were to happen, it would be great.</p><br/><p>For so many experts to visit the Shanghai association, it would make them even more well-known. Regarding this, he felt that President Lin was really too clever to be able to think of such an idea.</p><br/><p>At the same time, they would be able to invite a few experts to start new schools of martial arts in the association. It would be fantastic.</p><br/><p>Although the possibility of that was low, Jiang Fei was hopeful. As long as one works hard, there\u2019s nothing that can\u2019t be achieved.</p><br/><p>Thinking about all this, a smile appeared on his face.</p><br/><p>When Wang Yun Jie noticed Jiang Fei\u2019s expression, his heart groaned as he felt that that smile was a little weird.</p><br/><p>Huang Ru Zhong didn\u2019t have much to say about this. He couldn\u2019t figure out how this young man in front of him knew so many different martial art styles. He had no idea what was going on.</p><br/><p>But during the few hours that the young man had been in the arena, Huang Ru Zhong had to admit that he was incredible.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Huang, why don\u2019t you have a meal with us here. This is our first time here as we. To be able to meet so many martial arts experts makes me feel very fortunate,\u201d said Lin Fan with a smile.</p><br/><p>Elder Huang chuckled. Although he was much older than the opposite party, he couldn\u2019t treat Lin Fan with the attitude of an elder.</p><br/><p>To him, this young man\u2019s ability was not something that they could match up to.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright. Since President Lin has spoken, we shall stay for a meal together. In the future, when we are free, we will definitely pay President Lin a visit,\u201d said Huang Ru Zhong.</p><br/><p>Then, the crowd gave up their seats to the old-timers.</p><br/><p>At the dining table.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan introduced Fraud Tian, \u201cThis is Tian Han Ming. His Ba Gua Zhang is remarkable. He could be the number one Ba Gua Zhang practitioner.\u201d</p><br/><p>Huang Ru Zhong and the rest looked up in astonishment when they heard this. It seemed that they hadn\u2019t expected this fifty-something-year-old man to have such an identity.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian glanced at Lin Fan. \u201cNumber one? With you around, I can only be number two at best.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang burst into laughter when he heard that.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Huang Ru Zhong and the rest hadn\u2019t expected that he wouldn\u2019t be humble at all. Instead, Fraud Tian had admitted to it.</p><br/><p>This left them a little speechless.</p><br/><p>But to them, since President Lin had said so, it was probably true.</p><br/><p>The people waiting outside didn\u2019t know what had been going on at all.</p><br/><p>Then, some people came out.</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone, don\u2019t wait anymore. If you want President Lin\u2019s guidance, you\u2019ll have to go to the Shanghai association,\u201d a man said.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh? Isn\u2019t he going to do it now?\u201d someone asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. This is such a good chance. If he teaches us now, I\u2019ll go home and write about it in my family records. I\u2019d be able to write a whole story.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCan\u2019t you see for yourselves? There are so many people here who all want his guidance. How long would it take? Right now, we are already fortunate to know that President Lin knows all of our martial arts styles.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. I go to Shanghai occasionally. Once I go back this time, I have to make preparations to go to Shanghai and pay Master Lin a visit.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. Such an important matter has to be grand. If he just casually helps us to complete our techniques, it would be anticlimactic.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although everyone was very excited about this, they could still control themselves.</p><br/><p>After all, they had waited for so long. A little longer wouldn\u2019t hurt.</p></div>\n</div>"}

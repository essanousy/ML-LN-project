But now, he knew how bad it was.</p><br/><p>A girl born after 2005 posted some words in the forum which made Lin Fan\u2019s heart ache.</p><br/><p>Have I become old? He thought.</p><br/><p>Moreover, that girl who posted the photo was quite terrible.</p><br/><p>In the photo, a brat was standing there holding a cigarette.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet me introduce her. This is my little sister, and she is a 2005s kid as well. You 2000s kids are nothing before us, understand?\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, he continued looking and found something even more repulsive.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to get a new boyfriend the day after tomorrow. Aren\u2019t you 2000s kids jealous? We 2005s kids are just so free. We will keep on outdoing you. We are even richer than you 2000s kids. When you all get old, we\u2019ll rule the world!\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking at these before he slept, Lin Fan couldn\u2019t describe how he felt.</p><br/><p>It seemed that the times were changing, and 90s kids were falling behind the times. He couldn\u2019t help but feel slightly mournful.</p><br/><p>Below, there was another comment with pictures that made Lin Fan feel helpless. He felt that if he didn\u2019t do something, he would really become old.</p><br/><p>\u201c2005s kids are your ancestors. If you aren\u2019t happy, come and fight us. My husband, Brother Hu, will beat you till you cry for mercy.\u201d</p><br/><p>There were two pictures below of a chubby kid taking a selfie with a confident expression.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan had nothing to say. He quietly took screenshots of the photos and those words.</p><br/><p>If he didn\u2019t do anything, he would really be getting old.</p><br/><p>He opened his Weibo.</p><br/><p>He took a look at his followers. Most people who used Weibo were already following him.</p><br/><p>\u201cTo the parents of these kids: you can raise your fists. I support you in educating them. Beat them if you need to. Otherwise, there may be no other chance in the future. As a 90s kid, this is all I can do.\u201d</p><br/><p>After making that post, he immediately went to sleep. Other things had nothing to do with him anymore.</p><br/><p>At night, thousands of households were having dinner.</p><br/><p>Zhang Xiao Hu was eating. Then, he looked cautiously at his father in front of him.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis time\u2019s exam was still alright. At least you passed.\u201d A thirty-something-year-old man nodded. He had gotten married and had his kid early. Now, he was just thirty-four and his kid was already thirteen.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course I would pass, Dad.\u201d Zhang Xiao Hu let out a deep breath. He was very afraid of his father\u2019s fists. Whenever he saw his father upset, his legs would start shivering.</p><br/><p>At that moment, the man took a look at Weibo. His favorite pastime was looking at Master Lin\u2019s Weibo.</p><br/><p>He had unwavering faith in Master Lin. It could even be said that Master Lin had had a huge influence on his view of life.</p><br/><p>At that moment, the man looked at Master Lin\u2019s latest Weibo post and was curious. Then, he nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, this is strange. Why would Master Lin post something like this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Although he was puzzled, he couldn\u2019t find anything wrong even when he took a closer look. He didn\u2019t recognize the little girl who posted the comment above, but he felt that it was quite inappropriate. Someone so young having such thoughts wasn\u2019t a good thing.</p><br/><p>However, when he saw the contents of the post below, his expression instantly changed.</p><br/><p>\u201cZhang Xiao Hu\u2026\u201d The man muttered in a deep tone. His anger was bursting out.</p><br/><p>\u201cDad, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d Zhang Xiao Hu saw that his father\u2019s expression was unpleasant. He became so fearful that his body trembled. He had a bad feeling.</p><br/><p>\u201cTake a good look at this. Is that you?\u201d The man placed the phone in front of his son.</p><br/><p>When Zhang Xiao Hu saw it, he was dumbfounded. What the f*ck is going on? Why would this appear in front of my father?</p><br/><p>\u201cDad, I\u2026 I can explain!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOuch!\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, the man grabbed a slipper and slapped it on Zhang Xiao Hu\u2019s butt. It was a terrifying hit.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so young and you\u2019re already in a relationship. I\u2019m going to beat you until you cry. \u2018Brother Hu\u2019? Good\u2026 That\u2019s very good\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, a sharp cry filled the room.</p><br/><p>\u201cDad, stop hitting me! I was wrong, I was wrong!\u201d</p><br/><p>Whack.</p><br/><p>\u201cI was just playing around, I\u2019m not like that!\u201d</p><br/><p>Thump.</p><br/><p>\u201cDad, listen to me! I won\u2019t play around ever again. Ouch, it hurts!\u201d</p><br/><p>It turned out to be a very painful night for Zhang Xiao Hu. His buttocks ended up completely red.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, in another household, a similar situation was taking place.</p><br/><p>Sister Xuan, who was a very influential personality on QQ, was beaten by her parents until she knelt on the ground and wept.</p><br/><p>\u201cMom, I was wrong! Please stop hitting me! I didn\u2019t smoke! I was just posing!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not in a relationship. That\u2019s Zhang Xiao Hu, my classmate. We were just playing around.\u201d</p><br/><p>When some parents saw Lin Fan\u2019s post, they were stunned. Then, they thought about it and realized that those kids were only thirteen-years-old. Having a relationship at that age was ridiculous.</p><br/><p>Thereafter, some parents immediately took their children\u2019s phones and opened up their messaging applications. With one look, they were all stunned.</p><br/><p>What the heck is going on in these group chats?</p><br/><p>There were porn sites, photos, and some flirty messages. These made the parents completely dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>They felt as if they had discovered something they couldn\u2019t even imagine. This was hard for them to take.</p><br/><p>At that instant, even more parents started punishing their children.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf Master Lin hadn\u2019t given us a heads up, we wouldn\u2019t have believed this.\u201d</p><br/><p>The words \u201cMaster Lin\u201d were drilled into the hearts of tens of thousands of primary school students.</p><br/><p>They would remember this name forever. All of this was because of Master Lin.</p><br/><p>The next day!</p><br/><p>Cloud Street!</p><br/><p>Lin Fan came to Cloud Street without knowing what had happened last night. He made the scallion pancakes for the townsfolk and then just sat there, playing with his phone.</p><br/><p>However, when he opened Weibo, he realized that many people were commenting on his post from the previous day.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, I am so grateful to you. If it wasn\u2019t for you, I wouldn\u2019t have realized this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLin, as a representative of the 2005s kids, I will never forgive you. We have our own terrorist group. Just wait for our retaliation.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan saw that, he was stunned. It was as if he had seen a ghost.</p><br/><p>He had not done anything at all. He had just posted some comments and photos because he felt like it. How had he drawn hatred from all these kids?</p><br/><p>This was a bad sign. He was supposed to be known as Master Lin throughout the world.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

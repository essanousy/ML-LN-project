Then, he took out crumbs of the scallion pancake from the plastic bag and put them into his mouth.</p><br/><p>\"Delicious, simply delicious!\" The man smiled in happiness and satisfaction.</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian recovered from his daze and the surrounding police officers went forward to capture the man.</p><br/><p>The man looked calm. \"Don't be nervous. I wasn't prepared to jump down\u2026\"</p><br/><p>The man's attitude suddenly changed, which shocked Liu Xiao Tian. Then, he stopped as if he had thought of something. He thought that this man hadn't even wanted to jump down in the first place. He had just pretended to commit suicide so that he could taste the scallion pancake.</p><br/><p>The crowd below gasped in shock.</p><br/><p>\"I think the person's been saved.\"</p><br/><p>\"I can't see clearly but the man is gone.\"</p><br/><p>\"It's so dangerous. If he were to jump down from there, he would definitely end up as a pile of minced meat.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan stood there and heaved a sigh of relief as the man had been saved. But as he thought of how the man had pretended to commit suicide just for his scallion pancakes, he didn't know whether to be happy or sad.</p><br/><p>After a while, Liu Xiao Tian came down with the rest of them.</p><br/><p>The reporters charged forward.</p><br/><p>\"May I know why you wanted to jump down?\"</p><br/><p>\"May I know why you requested for the scallion pancakes when you wanted to jump down? Do you have any family?\"</p><br/><p>\"Inspector Liu, could you say a few words?\"</p><br/><p>The reporters wanted to get the latest information on this suicide case. It wasn't exactly common in Shanghai. But the fact that he had requested for scallion pancakes before he jumped made it an extremely special case.</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian looked extremely stern. He didn't want to say anything but the man started to laugh.</p><br/><p>\"I'd be crazy if I wanted to jump down. I just wanted to eat the scallion pancake.\"</p><br/><p>The crowd was stunned after hearing his words.</p><br/><p>The reporters froze in shock. Then, they asked, \"May I know why you wanted to eat the scallion pancake?\"</p><br/><p>The man replied, \"It's difficult to buy.\"</p><br/><p>\"Do you know that your actions have disrupted people in the society and you have to face the consequences of the law?\"</p><br/><p>The man casually replied, \"I know that. I just have to be detained. I'm used to it. It's okay, as long as I get to eat the scallion pancake, I'm happy.\"</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian remained silent. He didn't want to say anything about it. If he wasn't a police, he would have beaten the sh*t out of this man. Was it a funny thing to threaten to commit suicide?</p><br/><p>It had created an impactful consequence.</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang was in shock and he took out his phone to broadcast.</p><br/><p>\"Everyone, this is crazy. This guy feigned suicide just because of a scallion pancake.\"</p><br/><p>\"D*mn, that's too crazy. I didn't expect someone like him to exist.\"</p><br/><p>\"That's too much for a scallion pancake.\"</p><br/><p>\"I'm afraid he'll be detained for only about ten days.\"</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>The man was apprehended by the police. Then, he looked at Master Lin happily. \"Let me go there, I want to speak to Master Lin.\"</p><br/><p>The reporters surrounded them and they were stunned at what was happening.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the man and didn't know what to say. He hadn't expected this to be the final outcome.</p><br/><p>\"What you did wasn't right,\" Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>The man said bitterly, \"Master Lin, you don't understand my pain. I queued for two whole months. Do you know the pain I felt when I didn't get chosen? When I got to eat the scallion pancake, I felt like everything I did was worth it.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan couldn't even say anything as he couldn't argue with what the man had said.</p><br/><p>So it was his fault?</p><br/><p>So he had to bear the consequences?</p><br/><p>He hadn't expected someone to resort to something like this just to eat his scallion pancakes.</p><br/><p>It was fortunate that he had managed to do it.</p><br/><p>The middle-aged man looked at Lin Fan and said, \"Master Lin, your scallion pancakes are simply too delicious.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled awkwardly. This matter was going to be a big one.</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian nodded at Lin Fan. He had nothing to say regarding this. The man was simply asking for trouble. If he wasn't punished properly, he might do it again in the future.</p><br/><p>The reporters surrounded Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>\"Master Lin, what do you think of what happened?\"</p><br/><p>\"Was it a lowly method?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the reporter. \"Anyone with a brain wouldn't do something like this. Alright, that's all.\"</p><br/><p>He didn't want to stay there any longer. It was crazy. This matter was going to make him appear in the headlines again.</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang said to the netizens in the broadcast, \"I guess this was an eye-opener for everyone. It isn't something that could be done by an average human.\"</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>It was big news.</p><br/><p>The next day!</p><br/><p>The incident was already being reported online.</p><br/><p>The news appeared on Weibo and other news platforms.</p><br/><p>\"The world is indeed really big. There's literally nothing that's impossible. Something like this actually happened.\"</p><br/><p>\"What's the matter with the scallion pancakes? Did he need to resort to that?\"</p><br/><p>A netizen named 'First Demonic Sword' posted: \"I was there yesterday. This middle-aged man pretended that he wanted to commit suicide just for Master Lin's scallion pancakes. The ambulance, police cars and fire engines were there. The air cushion was already prepared for him. He asked for scallion pancakes and when someone brought a piece over, he immediately came down from the ledge and didn't want to commit suicide anymore. Everyone was stunned. How could there be someone like this in the world?\"</p><br/><p>\"At the same time, I want to talk more about Master Lin's scallion pancakes. According to my research, Master Lin's scallion pancakes are extremely difficult to purchase. It's limited to ten pieces daily and there is a large number of people who queue up for it everyday. Whoever manages to buy it would mean that he/she would've gotten the most delicious food in the world. At the same time, he or she would've struck a small fortune because there were resellers there. If he or she doesn't want to eat it, it can be sold to them for a much higher price. The highest price they offer is $1000 and they sell it to others for $10,000. You can think about how crazy the prices are.\"</p><br/><p>\"But don't even think about making a fortune from this. The scallion pancakes are almost impossible to buy. The person that pretended to commit suicide had queued for two whole months but didn't manage to buy it. Can you imagine how difficult it is?\"</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>When the post was published, it stunned a lot of people. Those that had never heard of Master Lin's scallion pancakes before were absolutely dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>\"D*mn, I don't believe it. I didn't expect Shanghai to have such an awesome shop. It can even be entered in the Guinness' World Record book.\"</p><br/><p>\"Is it even true? Why would a shop like this exist?\"</p><br/><p>\"Could this news be fake?\"</p><br/><p>A lot of doubtful comments started to appear.</p><br/><p>But to those that knew about Master Lin's shop, this matter wasn't fake. It was completely true.</p><br/><p>One would never know how delicious the scallion pancakes were until they tried it themselves.</p><br/><p>An internet celebrity posted: \"This method of generating hype is too low and despicable. Feigning suicide would get him detained for ten days at most. We should oppress such despicable methods. This 'Master Lin' shop should be punished. I think it should be closed down immediately.\"</p><br/><p>This incident was going viral on Weibo. Many netizens were in disbelief when they read it.</p><br/><p>Most people who didn't know who Master Lin was started to like the celebrity's post.</p><br/><p>Also, there were many netizens who knew about Master Lin and started to roast this internet celebrity.</p><br/><p>\"Get lost. If you don't know anything, just shut up.\"</p><br/><p>\"Do you know how awesome Master Lin is? If you don't know, please keep your mouth shut.\"</p><br/><p>\"You only know how to make use of Master Lin to boost your fame. How shameless.\"</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, what Master Lin didn't know was that the re-sellers were probably going to make use of this incident to raise the prices of the scallion pancakes even further.</p><br/><p>Someone had actually pretended to commit suicide just to eat Master Lin's scallion pancakes. The prices had to be increased.</p><br/><p>...</p><br/>\n</div>"}

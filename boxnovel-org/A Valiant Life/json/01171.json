Or is he just taking it too far?\u201d</p><br/><p>*Pat!*</p><br/><p>Elder Chen placed a hand on Elder Liang\u2019s shoulder. \u201cWhat are you looking at?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m looking at Fraud Tian.\u201d Elder Liang sucked his soy milk with a stunned look on his face.</p><br/><p>Elder Chen said, \u201cWhat\u2019s there to look at? Don\u2019t you see him every day?\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Liang shook his head. \u201cNo, you don\u2019t understand. I have never seen Fraud Tian like that before. Go and see for yourself. I feel like I\u2019m going blind. I can\u2019t understand that Fraud\u2019s world.\u201d</p><br/><p>After saying that, he immediately walked away.</p><br/><p>Elder Chen was very curious as he wondered what on earth was going on. What was Elder Liang so surprised about? But when he went in front of Master Lin\u2019s shop, he was astonished.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t even know what to say.</p><br/><p>He could only stand there stupidly, staring at Fraud Tian, who was inside the shop.</p><br/><p>In the shop.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian had his head down looking at his phone. He felt a gaze on him, so he looked over and saw Elder Chen. <em>What is this guy doing? Is there something different about me? Why is he staring at me like that?</em></p><br/><p>\u201cElder Chen, what are you doing? Have you all gone crazy today?\u201d Fraud Tian couldn\u2019t stand such an invasive stare, so he spoke out.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck. Fraud has changed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly!</p><br/><p>Elder Chen let out a gasp. Then, he ran along Cloud Street as he yelled out as if he had seen a ghost.</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang said, \u201cFraud, your style has already caused a disturbance. I think you\u2019re going to defy nature.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian shook his head. \u201cSigh. People these days have no sense of fashion at all. No one understands me. This is too lonely. But fortunately, there are still many people on the Internet who do understand me. Look. My number of followers on Weibo has increased. I actually have 200,000 followers now. I have to post a picture. Come here and help me to take a photo. Once those scallion pancakes buyers come, there won\u2019t be any more time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang was very reluctant but he had no choice. Under the pressure of Fraud Tian\u2019s martial arts, he had to give in and obediently take the photo.</p><br/><p>\u201cFraud, you have to take it easy. There\u2019ll be people coming to buy scallion pancakes soon. Don\u2019t scare them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan was cleaning up the shop. She was quite supportive of Fraud Tian\u2019s change. After all, everyone had to discover their true selves. However, Fraud Tian\u2019s true self was just a little too weird. Most people wouldn\u2019t be able to accept it.</p><br/><p>Still, she believed that after some time, people would definitely accept it.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh my god.\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly, a series of cries rang out.</p><br/><p>The townsfolk had heard that Master Lin\u2019s shop had opened and they had rushed here immediately. But when they reached and looked inside the shop, they were completely dumbfounded.</p><br/><p><em>Who the hell is this flashily-dressed person?</em></p><br/><p>Upon taking a closer look, they realized that it was Fraud Tian.</p><br/><p>How could they not be shocked?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you all surprised for? Line up properly.\u201d Fraud Tian walked over with the number tags. He was completely indifferent towards the stares.</p><br/><p>After all, he had already gotten used to it.</p><br/><p>\u201cFraud, let\u2019s take a photo together. You look way too dashing with this style,\u201d said a young man excitedly. \u201cCool. This is way too cool.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Fraud Tian heard that, he was delighted. \u201cAm I really cool?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah! You\u2019re way too cool!\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian was very pleased. Finally, there was someone who understood him. \u201cAlright, then I shall fulfill your request. Let\u2019s take a photo together.\u201d</p><br/><p>*Snap*</p><br/><p>The photo was taken and the young man immediately posted it on Weibo to flaunt it.</p><br/><p>\u201cA photo with the fashionable Fraud. Too cool!\u201d</p><br/><p>The other people who were queuing felt that this was quite interesting, and they wanted to take photos with Fraud Tian too.</p><br/><p>\u201cFraud, let\u2019s take a photo!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTake a photo with me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMe too!\u201d</p><br/><p>In an instant, the atmosphere had become lively. Fraud Tian was elated. He had not expected that he would suddenly become so popular. This was really quite an amazing feeling.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright. Be patient, everyone. If you want to take a photo, we can do it slowly,\u201d Fraud Tian said. Then, he looked back at Zhao Zhong Yang as if to say, \u201cDo you see this? I, Fraud Tian, am very popular!\u201d</p><br/><p>In the shop.</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang didn\u2019t know what to say anymore. He really couldn\u2019t understand this world anymore. Fraud Tian was so flashy, but he was actually popular. Was there something wrong with the world?</p><br/><p>Photos were taken, one after another. The townsfolk who took photos with Fraud Tian immediately posted the photos onto the Internet.</p><br/><p>In an instant, Fraud Tian\u2019s photos had flooded Weibo and WeChat. Things were brewing online. Fraud Tian was gradually becoming viral.</p><br/><p>The surrounding shop owners gathered together and started chattering.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn. What happened to Fraud Tian? Why did he change so much?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah! Didn\u2019t he use to dress normally? Why did he suddenly change so much?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho knows? When I first saw him, I was shocked.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWow, this is incredible. I wouldn\u2019t wear those clothes even if I were beaten to death.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Fraud Tian reached the shop and saw the situation, he was stupefied as well. The townsfolk were crowded around Fraud Tian as they competed to take a photo with him.</p><br/><p>\u201cFraud, what are you doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, I, Fraud Tian, am way too popular. Everyone wants a photo with me,\u201d said Fraud Tian excitedly.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shook his head. <em>What a strange situation. This Fraud suddenly became popular for no reason. This is really mystical.</em></p><br/><p>Lin Fan couldn\u2019t quite understand Fraud Tian\u2019s fashion. But this was good too. He wanted to see what Fraud Tian would make of this.</p><br/><p>In the end, Fraud Tian finished taking photos with the townsfolk and waved his hand. \u201cEveryone, line up properly. I\u2019m going to give out the number tags. If anyone else still wants to take photos, please wait until I\u2019ve finished giving out the number tags.\u201d</p><br/><p>The townsfolk still really yearned for the scallion pancakes, so they all lined up properly.</p><br/><p>After the number tags were given out.</p><br/><p>As Lin Fan made the scallion pancakes, he looked over at Fraud Tian. \u201cYour clothes today are even more incredible than yesterday\u2019s. How many sets of clothes did you buy?\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian chuckled. \u201cNot too many. Just several tens of sets. And I\u2019m going to keep buying more. Right now, I can\u2019t stop anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIncredible.\u201d Lin Fan was speechless. Fraud Tian had gone onto the path of clothes-shopping and there was no turning back.</p><br/><p>But since Fraud Tian could be so popular, there was definitely something good about this. Lin Fan felt that perhaps he was really getting old and could no longer understand the young generation.</p><br/><p>In the end, that was the only reason he could think of to make sense of why Fraud Tian had suddenly become so popular.</p><br/><p>Those clothes were definitely something Lin Fan would never wear.</p><br/><p>The scallion pancakes were all sold.</p><br/><p>The townsfolk rushed to get their photos taken again. In the end, all the photos were finally taken, and Fraud Tian went back into the shop cheerily.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you see that? I\u2019m super popular now. People call me \u2018Fashion Emperor Fraud Tian\u2019.\u201d</p><br/><p>*Clap clap clap*</p><br/><p>Lin Fan immediately applauded.</p><br/><p>\u201cClap for him!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang immediately responded and clapped as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re awesome, Emperor. You\u2019re incredible, Emperor.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p></div>\n</div>"}

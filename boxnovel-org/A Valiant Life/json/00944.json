He didn\u2019t even drive his car. He just turned into a flash and dashed towards the warehouse where he had previously stored the alchemy furnace.</p><br/><p>The car was simply too slow. It would be a waste of time.</p><br/><p>He sprinted at the speed of sound as his speed reached its limit.</p><br/><p>The Wuxia major class of knowledge was the most valiant class of knowledge that Lin Fan possessed. He was basically a god on land.</p><br/><p>On Earth, he was an unmatched being but the peace-loving Lin Fan would never use his powers to take over the world.</p><br/><p>He would only use his full powers in times of need.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-2\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>*Boom! Boom!*</p><br/><p>The drivers on the road heard a series of thunderous noises and were all puzzled. They had no idea what was going on.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you know where that sound is coming from?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. It\u2019s hurting my ears a little.\u201d</p><br/><p>The people in the vehicles were chatting, wondering where on Earth this sound came from.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Lin Fan was in mid-air. He had turned into a flash and disappeared without a trace.</p><br/><p>In front of the warehouse.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan expanded his awareness and confirmed that there was no one around. Thereafter, he quickly entered the warehouse and began crafting the pill. Time was of the essence and he couldn\u2019t waste a single second.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-3\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s lucky that I\u2019ve unlocked the alchemy knowledge. Otherwise, I would have been helpless in this situation.\u201d</p><br/><p>This was the first time that he felt that having different classes of knowledge was of such great importance. For example, for the pill-crafting, he hadn\u2019t had the ingredient he needed at first and had thus been unable to craft the pill he wanted.</p><br/><p>But now, this wasn\u2019t a problem anymore.</p><br/><p>\u2018Vitality Pill\u2019</p><br/><p>This pill was one of the better medicinal pills in the alchemy class of knowledge. It didn\u2019t have any extra effects besides increasing one\u2019s lifespan by 40 years.</p><br/><p>And on this planet, it was considered beyond nature-defying. Even in the context of Wuxia knowledge, it was considered quite a precious pill.</p><br/><p>From the class of knowledge, Lin Fan found out that this kind of medicinal pill would cause a calamity.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan had never experienced all this before and he was a little nervous. He wondered how it would turn out.</p><br/><p>And what would the calamity be like?</p><br/><p>But time was short. Without thinking too much, he started to craft the pill.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-4\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>He tossed all the ingredients into the alchemy furnace and pressed both hands on the surface of the furnace. The heat rose drastically and the Encyclopedia\u2019s mystical boost started to take effect.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt must be successful on the first try.\u201d He couldn\u2019t afford to fail, he could only succeed. If not, it would all be over.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian and the rest were in a rather heavy mood. They already knew the situation and Wu You Lan was worried. She had no idea where Brother Lin was.</p><br/><p>Sometimes, her mind would even wander off and wonder if Brother Lin hadn\u2019t been able to take the emotional impact and had gone into hiding as a result.</p><br/><p>Now, they couldn\u2019t do anything but wait silently.</p><br/><p>At that moment, a group of strangers arrived. The middle-aged man leading the pack had an exceptionally imposing manner. His back was as straight as a pole as he spoke upon entering.</p><br/><p>\u201cMay I know if Master Lin is around?\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian looked at him, then replied, \u201cNope, we don\u2019t know where he is either.\u201d</p><br/><p>The middle-aged man grabbed Fraud Tian\u2019s arm and said in a stern tone, \u201cI wish for you to speak honestly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian was in a troubled state and the opposite party\u2019s tone made him a little uncomfortable as well, so he pushed with his shoulder and shoved the man away. \u201cWho the hell are you? I told you that we don\u2019t know. What are you trying to do?\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-5\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>The middle-aged man was slightly shocked. He hadn\u2019t expected this guy to be a martial artist. Moreover, his kungfu was pretty strong.</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang saw that the mood was rather fiery, so he quickly stepped in. \u201cSorry, we don\u2019t know where Brother Lin has gone right now. If there\u2019s anything, let me know so that I can tell him when he comes back.\u201d</p><br/><p>The middle-aged man looked at the people in the shop and saw that they seemed to really not know. However, time was short. If he didn\u2019t seize it, there might not be enough time.</p><br/><p>At that moment, another man stepped forward and whispered into his ear.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go to the hospital.\u201d The middle-aged man waved his hand and led the group of people as they hurried to the hospital where Zhao Ming Qing was.</p><br/><p>Just as they left the shop, the originally bright sky suddenly changed.</p><br/><p>Dark clouds gathered from all directions and covered the bright sky.</p><br/><p>The surrounding townsfolk gasped in shock.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, what\u2019s going on? Didn\u2019t the weather forecast say that today would be a sunny day? How did it turn dark all of a sudden?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Judging by the looks of things, it\u2019s probably going to rain.\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-6\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cSigh, this strange weather. You can\u2019t even trust the television channels anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The middle-aged man looked up at the sky but wasn\u2019t concerned about it. Right now, the most important thing was to hurry back to the hospital and see if Master Lin was there.</p><br/><p>After they left, Fraud Tian came out of the shop and pointed at the leaving car as he clamored, \u201cBunch of b*stards. If you stayed a while more, I would\u2019ve punched your eyeballs in.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang sighed. \u201cFraud, that\u2019s enough. They\u2019ve already left so there\u2019s no need to show off anymore. But I wonder who they are. Why are they looking for Brother Lin?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Tian He, who had been sitting there the whole time, spoke, \u201cI think these people look like they\u2019re from the military.\u201d</p><br/><p>This sentence made everyone surprised. <em>Military? What does that mean? Could it be that Brother Lin has done something wrong?</em></p><br/><p>In the warehouse.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan could feel the pill taking shape. And he could guess what was going on outside as well.</p><br/><p>*Rumbling sound*</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-7\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>There was a heavy downpour outside. Then, a bolt of lightning descended from the sky and struck a hole in the warehouse roof.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked up at the sky as his heart groaned. This was the first time he had come across something like this. If he said he wasn\u2019t nervous, he would be lying.</p><br/><p>The sky was already dark and amongst the clouds, streaks of lightning could be faintly seen. It was a little frightening.</p><br/><p>But he wasn\u2019t bothered about all this right now. The \u2018Vitality Pill\u2019 was already in its final stage and was about to be completed.</p><br/><p>\u201cOpen!\u201d</p><br/><p>Upon opening the furnace, a pill emitted an aura of vitality which arose from the furnace.</p><br/><p>*Rumble!*</p><br/><p>As the pill emerged from the furnace, a bolt of lightning descended from the sky.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan instantly reacted and grabbed the pill with his hand. He opened his other palm and caught the lightning with it. Then, he felt a great formidable power strike his hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m crafting this pill to save my disciple. Don\u2019t be too impudent.\u201d Lin Fan\u2019s eyes glowed like a god\u2019s eyes. It was the first time he was unleashing his powers. With an invisible power, his gaze penetrated heaven and earth and stared straight into the void.</p><br/><p>This calamity wasn\u2019t too great. Earth was just Earth after all and there wasn\u2019t any spiritual energy around. Hence, the calamity caused from crafting the pill was just normal lightning. To Lin Fan, it was harmless.</p><br/><p>\u201cEight Thunders Banishing.\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-8\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>A technique from \u2018Legend of Emperors\u2019 in the Wuxia major class of knowledge. His left hand turned into a formless blade, with which he split open the sky. The dark clouds in the sky scattered rapidly and rose upwards as if going against their natural movement.</p><br/><p>The dark clouds that had appeared temporarily were instantly dispersed.</p><br/><p>All the citizens of Shanghai looked up. They had dumbfounded expressions on their faces as they wondered what had happened. The dark clouds that had just gathered suddenly disappeared without a trace.</p><br/><p><em>Is this f*cking rain still coming?</em></p><br/><p><em>If not, I want to go out.</em></p><br/><p>\u2026</p></div>\n</div>"}

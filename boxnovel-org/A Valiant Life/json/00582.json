He knew that his boss must have wanted some wine, so he had already prepared everything and was going over.</p><br/><p>He pushed the door open.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was grabbing onto Li Hu and singing a song. He was very engrossed in it.</p><br/><p>\u201cFriends walk together for their entire lives\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The waiter was a little puzzled. Hadn\u2019t there only been three people? Why were there four now?</p><br/><p>And his boss was sitting there motionlessly. Why were his eyes shifting left and right?</p><br/><p>However, he didn\u2019t dare to ask anything. He put the wine down and left the room.</p><br/><p>After the waiter left, Lin Fan laughed, \u201cYou really aren\u2019t obedient. If I wasn\u2019t so smart, I would have been discovered.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Hu had lost all hope. He had never expected this guy to be so perverse. Also, that waiter was really too stupid.</p><br/><p>At the local police station.</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian was busy at work. He was in a conference with a group of other police officers.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis matter must be resolved as soon as possible. It isn\u2019t good news that Scorpion has appeared in Shanghai. I hope that you guys can find some clues, even if it\u2019s just a small lead,\u201d the Station Chief said as he stood on the stage. To them, this was a crucial period.</p><br/><p>\u201cInspector Liu, I wish for you to work a little harder. Scorpion is very dangerous. You should know the outcome if he is to do something in Shanghai.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian nodded, \u201cI understand, Station Chief.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The conference ended.</p><br/><p>Every police officer felt the weight of a heavy rock on their shoulders. They had been hard pressed with work lately but they hadn\u2019t even found a single lead.</p><br/><p>It was mainly because Scorpion left too little leads. They only knew that he had a scorpion tattoo on his neck. Even though he was in the great city of Shanghai, trying to find him was like trying to find a needle in a haystack.</p><br/><p>\u201cInspector, what do we do now?\u201d asked the policemen.</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian said, \u201cGo back and keep working overtime. Organize the information. Send people to each location to investigate. We have to locate this Scorpion.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Inspector.\u201d</p><br/><p>*ring, ring*</p><br/><p>Just as Liu Xiao Tian was having a headache, his phone rang.</p><br/><p>\u201cInspector Liu, what are you doing now? Are you busy?\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian said, \u201cSigh, Master Lin, what do you think? Since this guy came to Shanghai, the whole Shanghai police force hasn\u2019t been able to rest. We\u2019re all looking for him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cDo you think that if I find him, I would get a Good Citizen Award? Or perhaps they\u2019ll organize an Honors Ceremony for me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian smiled, \u201cMaster Lin, if you find him, don\u2019t even talk about Good Citizen Awards, you\u2019d get any kind of glory you want. You may not know but this Scorpion is a drug lord who is wanted across the country. Who knows how many of our comrades from the drug enforcement teams sacrifice their lives every year in order to capture him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it that serious?\u201d asked Lin Fan calmly.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course it\u2019s serious. He\u2019s one of the most wanted criminals,\u201d said Liu Xiao Tian.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Lin Fan felt great. He hadn\u2019t thought that Scorpion was a super big fish. \u201cInspector Liu, don\u2019t say that I don\u2019t look after you. Bring your men and come to XX Bar right now. I\u2019ll give you a heavenly surprise.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Liu Xiao Tian was startled. He was also filled with anticipation.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cYou\u2019ll know when you reach. Don\u2019t forget to bring more men.\u201d</p><br/><p>*clatter*</p><br/><p>The phone was hung up.</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian sat there immersed in his thoughts. Then, he quickly sprang up. He suddenly remembered that it seemed that every time Master Lin called him, he wouldn\u2019t let him down.</p><br/><p>Could it be\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cQuick, assemble the men and follow me,\u201d Liu Xiao Tian issued the ordered. The policemen who were working all looked up, wondering what had happened.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you waiting for? There\u2019s been a lead. Hurry up!\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, the policemen recovered from their dazes.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, what lead?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow is that possible? Could it be a mistake?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho knows? Hurry up and assemble. We\u2019ll know once we get there.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>In the private room.</p><br/><p>When he had the opportunity, Lin Fan had dragged Scorpion from the toilet to the private room.</p><br/><p>When Long Hair saw Scorpion, he was shocked. He had never expected that even his boss would be caught.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan clapped his hands. \u201cAlright, now you\u2019re all gathered. The police will be here soon. You can chat while you\u2019re in prison.\u201d</p><br/><p>Scorpion had never expected himself to fall to this guy in Shanghai. No matter how much he thought, he just couldn\u2019t understand what the heck was going on.</p><br/><p>Elder Dog Nicholas sat at the side, eating a bowl of fruits.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was singing a song as he sat there waiting for the police to arrive.</p><br/><p>Soon after.</p><br/><p>The sound of police cars came from the outside.</p><br/><p>Countless men and women were startled when they saw this. They had no idea what was going on.</p><br/><p>Upon reaching the location, Liu Xiao Tian issued orders, \u201cSurround the area. Check the IDs of all personnel leaving or entering the place. Capture any suspicious person you see.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><br/><p>Not far away.</p><br/><p>Some reporters were secretly taking photos of a celebrity. But when they realized that the situation didn\u2019t seem right, there became curious.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are there so many policemen?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo idea.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLooks like something big has happened. Let\u2019s hurry up and go take a look.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian was on the phone, \u201cMaster Lin, where are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cSecond floor, private room. I can hear the commotion outside from here. Come on in.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian had an eager look on his face. What exactly was it going to be? Then, he brought a team of men and rushed inside. \u201cFollow me. The remaining men, watch the entrance. Don\u2019t let anyone in.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at Li Hu and the rest. \u201cThe police is here. You\u2019re all done for.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although they couldn\u2019t say anything, their eyes gleamed with boundless rage.</p><br/><p>Bam!</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian came bursting through the door. The inside was slightly dim, so he immediately turned on the lights. He asked impatiently, \u201cMaster Lin, what\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled, \u201cSee for yourself. Look who it is.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian looked at the people in front and was a little puzzled. They couldn\u2019t recognize these men. However, when he saw the two boxes on the table, he was completely dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>There were a lot of white packets and there was even cash.</p><br/><p>\u201cThese are drugs.\u201d Liu Xiao Tian was astounded. \u201cMaster Lin, you really are amazing. You\u2019ve discovered the scene of a drug transaction.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at Liu Xiao Tian and said, \u201cF*ck, I\u2019m not telling you to look at that. I\u2019m telling you to look at this.\u201d He pulled Scorpion\u2019s shirt collar down. \u201cLook, what\u2019s this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian was startled. \u201cWhat? Scorpion\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded proudly, \u201cThat\u2019s right. This is Scorpion. The criminals and their illegal goods are all here. These four guys were in the middle of a drug transaction and they\u2019ve been taken down by me. Don\u2019t you think this is a great service?\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian was speechless. It even felt difficult to breathe.</p><br/><p>How was this possible?</p><br/><p>The whole of Shanghai\u2019s police force had been deployed but they hadn\u2019t even found a single lead on Scorpion but Master Lin actually discovered him. On top of that, the drugs were also discovered.</p><br/><p>If the rest of the police force was to find out, they might find a hole to hide.</p><br/><p>It was simply humiliating.</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian raised his thumb. \u201cAwesome, Master Lin, you\u2019re really too awesome. I\u2019m already in such admiration that I would kneel down to you. This service is so great that it is boundless.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled proudly, \u201cThat\u2019s good. In order to capture these guys, I\u2019ve been taken advantage of by this dog. You have to let me know about the Good Citizen Award and the Honors Ceremony. I need to prepare myself mentally.\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Dog Nicholas protested. \u201cWhen did I take advantage of you? Without me, you would never have found them,\u201d he thought.</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian was at a loss for words.</p><br/><p>However, now wasn\u2019t the time to think about all this. He had to quickly bring detain these people and bring them back for questioning.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p></div>\n</div>"}

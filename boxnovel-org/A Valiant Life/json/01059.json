You have to ask the related personnel.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen who is the related personnel? Can you call him out?\u201d asked Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Wang Xiu felt that this Master Lin was hard to deal with. She shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m just in charge of the lobby. As for who the related personnel is, I don\u2019t know either. You\u2019ll have to wait for the related personnel to come.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen who is the related personnel? When will they come?\u201d Lin Fan continued to question.</p><br/><p>Being questioned repeatedly like that, Wang Xiu felt that she was unable to face the reporters and Master Lin.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis\u2026this\u2026\u201d Wang Xiu\u2019s heart was trembling a little but her strong professional qualities allowed her to steady herself. \u201cThe related personnel have applied for a leave of absence. They\u2019re temporarily not around.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cThen who will be responsible for this now? Please inform whoever can be responsible to come here. You guys push the responsibility around when met with a problem, saying that this person is not here or that person is not here. How can anyone trust you?\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporters aimed their camera lenses at the scene. They had had colleagues come here to interview the bank before but the bank had always avoided answering their questions.</p><br/><p>But today, it was different. Master Lin had personally come to the scene and was aggressively tackling the issue. His meaning was clear. Without a proper explanation, this matter would not be over.</p><br/><p>The old man was just watching as the scene unfolded before him. This was something he would have never dared to imagine. He had gone through so much trouble in the past because of this problem, speaking countless words and causing a ruckus every time but it had all been useless.</p><br/><p>The bank simply didn\u2019t care and they hadn\u2019t even been bothered by him.</p><br/><p>They had even sent their security guards to chase him away.</p><br/><p>But now, with so many reporters here, even the security guards didn\u2019t dare to come.</p><br/><p>Facing Master Lin\u2019s unending questions, Wang Xiu swallowed her saliva and said, \u201cThe Director will be here in a moment. He\u2019s already on the way.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. \u201cLook. When encountered with a problem, you even have to call a director who\u2019s not around to come and take responsibility. You have such a big building here, is the director the only one who can take responsibility?\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporters started laughing as they recorded this sentence from Master Lin. They had even thought of a headline for this piece of news.</p><br/><p>\u2018Master Lin\u2019s merciless taunting.\u2019</p><br/><p>Wang Xiu\u2019s face turned greenish-pale. She felt as if she had no words to reply.</p><br/><p>If it wasn\u2019t Master Lin, she might have had lots of things to say.</p><br/><p>But facing Master Lin, she suddenly didn\u2019t know how to open her mouth. It was as if anything she said would be used against her.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, when the Director found out that a large wave of reporters had come, he had started to rush down.</p><br/><p>With the Director\u2019s plentiful experience, he would definitely be able to settle this issue.</p><br/><p>Soon after.</p><br/><p>A balding middle-aged man hastily came in as if he was in a big rush. There was even perspiration on his forehead.</p><br/><p>Seeing all these reporters, he steadied his heart. Then, he looked at Master Lin, who was standing there, and immediately went forward. Courteously, he extended his hand. \u201cMaster Lin, hello, hello.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shook his hand very casually. \u201cYou\u2019re the director here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m the Director. My surname is Jin,\u201d said Director Jin with a smile. Then, he looked at Wang Xiu and immediately instructed, \u201cHurry up and get some chairs. And pour some water for us.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Wang Xiu nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need. We don\u2019t need to sit, nor am I thirsty. I just came here to clarify the situation. What exactly is going on? You\u2019re the director here, you should know, right?\u201d asked Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>The reporters snapped some pictures yet again to record this moment. They had thought of another headline.</p><br/><p>\u2018Master Lin wages war against Director Jin.\u2019</p><br/><p>Director Jin smiled embarrassedly. \u201cOf course, of course. She\u2019s just the lobby manager, so she doesn\u2019t understand the inner department\u2019s matters. That\u2019s why she doesn\u2019t know what exactly is going on.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan took over the photocopied document from the old man\u2019s hands. \u201cThen, Director Jin, please take a look. What exactly is going on?\u201d</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t need to say anymore. With one look at Director Jin, he could already see that he was corrupt. He was really corrupt.</p><br/><p>For this kind of person to be here instead of in jail, it could already be considered a miracle.</p><br/><p>Director Jin looked at the document in his hands as if he was studying it closely. Then, he said with a calm expression, \u201cMaster Lin, this document is very normal. It\u2019s one of the projects we are doing. And this signature has been signed personally by this old man. There\u2019s no issue at all.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. \u201cThere\u2019s no issue? Then why doesn\u2019t he know about it? And what the hell is up with the thirty years?\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Jin said, \u201cThis is a loan to a start-up company. The return is quite high but the duration is a little longer. But this has definitely been signed by the old man. He\u2019s already old so he must have forgotten.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the old man and said helplessly, \u201cOld man, do you have children?\u201d</p><br/><p>The old man shook his head. \u201cNo. My wife had an illness when she was young, so she couldn\u2019t give birth. We\u2019ve never had children. I want to withdraw my money now because I want to go to the nursing home with my wife.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDirector Jin, did you hear that? He doesn\u2019t have any children and he\u2019s already so old. Thirty years later, who will he give the money to? Or is the money supposed to just stay with you guys?\u201d asked Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>When Director Jin heard that, he was embarrassed. He hadn\u2019t expected this question. But when he was about to speak, Lin Fan interrupted.</p><br/><p>\u201cDirector Jin, actually, there\u2019s no need to fuss over this. When signing this kind of contract, there\u2019s always a video recording of the scene, isn\u2019t there? Just show us the video and it\u2019ll be settled. If there\u2019s a video, I am willing to take responsibility for all the trouble I\u2019ve caused you,\u201d said Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>\u201cSigh, Master Lin, you haven\u2019t caused us any trouble at all.\u201d Director Jin tried to go along with Lin Fan\u2019s words and avoid the main topic.</p><br/><p>But he couldn\u2019t avoid it. Lin Fan immediately said, \u201cLet\u2019s just talk about the video. Do you have it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Jin grumbled in his heart. This was a difficult situation to deal with. Then, he smiled. \u201cThe employee in charge of the videos isn\u2019t around today. And there was a fire that happened in the video storage room a while ago, so some videos seemed to have been lost. I don\u2019t know if the video is still there.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan hadn\u2019t expected this Director Jin to keep such a calm expression while saying these things. He had to give him some credit for that.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen is the video still here or not?\u201d questioned Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Director Jin chuckled but didn\u2019t reply immediately. He appeared to think for a moment before saying, \u201cI have to go and check about that. Why don\u2019t I give you an answer tomorrow?\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporters were all recording the scene as they felt that there was a big problem.</p><br/><p>This Director Jin spoke so ambiguously as if he was avoiding something.</p><br/><p>\u201cDirector Jin, could it be that you took a bribe from the start-up company, so you\u2019re giving them this loan? Or did you do it by yourself to earn some extra interest?\u201d Lin Fan wasn\u2019t afraid of offending anyone. He just said it directly.</p><br/><p>When Director Jin heard that, his expression changed dramatically. \u201cThat\u2019s not possible. That\u2019s completely not possible. We wouldn\u2019t do such a thing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan opened his palm. \u201cThen show us the video.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026\u201d Director Jin was stunned.</p><br/><p>What could he possibly do now? He couldn\u2019t even run away since the reporters were all around.</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t take out the proof because it didn\u2019t even exist.</p><br/><p>This matter wasn\u2019t just involving him. There were others involved as well.</p><br/><p><em>No, I have to stay calm. At least drag this out until tomorrow and let the other leaders think of a solution. I\u2019m out of ideas.</em></p><br/><p>If it had been an ordinary citizen or just a normal reporter, he wouldn\u2019t have cared at all.</p><br/><p>He could have just said a few words over the phone to put them off.</p><br/><p>But it was different now. This Master Lin was a powerful individual.</p></div>\n</div>"}

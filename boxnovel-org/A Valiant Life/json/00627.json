He believed that only a handful of people would reject the temptation of money.</p><br/><p>The person before him was a godly doctor but he was still human after all. If $10 million wasn\u2019t enough, they were going to offer him $1 billion.</p><br/><p>The money was nothing compared to Godfather Ma\u2019s health.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, he knew Godfather Ma\u2019s purpose for doing that. If the godly doctor wanted money, he would give it to him no matter what. However, when he had fully recovered, he would see if the godly doctor was able to keep the money with him before he finished him off.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled and touched the notes in the suitcases. \u201cMoney is a good thing.\u201d</p><br/><p>After hearing that, Liu Ren smiled. \u201cGodly doctor Lin, this is just a welcome gift. If you can heal Godfather Ma\u2019s illness, there will be another big gift. At the same time, you will be able to receive his gratitude.\u201d</p><br/><p>To many people, it was an honor to receive Godfather Ma\u2019s gratitude.</p><br/><p>This favor would definitely let the person become a powerful individual in Qingzhou. If he/she were to report Godfather Ma\u2019s name, everyone would have to show them some face.</p><br/><p>\u201cToo little.\u201d Lin Fan touched the notes for a little while longer. Then, he just couldn\u2019t be bothered by it. He looked at Liu Ren and said, \u201cIt\u2019s too little.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Ren was stunned but he continued smiling. At least he knew that Godly doctor Lin still loved money after all.</p><br/><p>Then, Liu Ren chuckled, \u201cGodly doctor, don\u2019t worry. This $10 million is just a welcome gift. It\u2019s naturally quite little. As compared to Godfather Ma\u2019s health, this is just peanuts to him. You can rest assured that as long as Godfather Ma\u2019s illness is treated, he will definitely satisfy your monetary needs.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, right, Godfather Ma said that he would like to host a welcoming reception for you. I will be here to fetch you personally,\u201d Liu Ren said.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at him, \u201cIt\u2019s okay. Just tell me where it is.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Ren didn\u2019t say anything else. Since he had a favor to ask of Lin Fan, he had to agree to his requests.</p><br/><p>\u201cGodly doctor, it\u2019s at Yun Villa. We will be welcoming you,\u201d Liu Ren said. \u201cI won\u2019t disturb you further. We will leave now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cOkay. Bring the money away.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Ren was stunned. It was as if he hadn\u2019t reacted. \u201cGodly doctor, what do you mean by that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too little. Just bring it away. I will tell Ma Qing Zhou how much he should be paying me tomorrow,\u201d Lin Fan answered.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2026\u201d Liu Ren didn\u2019t expect the godly doctor to be so greedy for thinking that the $10 million welcome gift was too little. But he still smiled, \u201cAlright, I will tell Godfather Ma that.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Liu Ren left, Lin Fan chuckled. Why would he only request for $10 million?</p><br/><p>However, it was okay. He was going to tell Ma Qing Zhou what he wanted the next day.</p><br/><p>Then, Lin Fan continued to have his meal but the other diners looked at him in shock. They were a little scared of him.</p><br/><p>Some people were in disbelief.</p><br/><p>Those banknotes in the suitcases were mindblowing.</p><br/><p>Outside!</p><br/><p>Liu Ren wanted to quickly tell Godfather Ma about it. The godly doctor loved money indeed and he was a greedy man.</p><br/><p>He called Godfather Ma.</p><br/><p>\u201cGodfather Ma, I just met that fella. What you said was true. Nobody would say no to money.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ma Qing Zhou chuckled, \u201cDid he accept it? What did he say?\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Ren said, \u201cGodfather Ma, he didn\u2019t accept it. He felt that it was too little. However, he agreed to attend the reception tomorrow night. Also, he said he would negotiate a price with you tomorrow.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha!\u201d Ma Qing Zhou laughed. \u201cThat\u2019s good. He\u2019s indeed a cunning chap. Let\u2019s see if he can even be alive at the end of it.\u201d</p><br/><p>To Ma Qing Zhou, the best scenario was to be fully treated by him. That was the best outcome. As for money, it had to depend if Lin Fan was able to remain alive to collect it.</p><br/><p>If he was polite and courteous to him at the start, he would probably have given him some money after healing his illness. Furthermore, he might even remember this favor from him. However, he felt that he didn\u2019t deserve it.</p><br/><p>He would disappear from existence after this incident.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>After leaving the hotel, Lin Fan was prepared to walk around the place.</p><br/><p>Ding ding!</p><br/><p>Then, the phone rang.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck, Ming Yang, what are you trying to do? I keep receiving calls from you.\u201d Lin Fan was helpless; he had received at least ten calls from Wang Ming Yang after arriving at Qingzhou.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang said, \u201cI\u2019m not afraid of you being in trouble. What are you thinking about? You actually dared to go to such a dangerous place. Ma Qing Zhou dares to kill people.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know, I know. Don\u2019t worry. I will be back soon. I\u2019ll be in Shanghai by the day after tomorrow,\u201d Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang was a little relieved. \u201cAlright, come back soon. Remember, don\u2019t go directly against Ma Qing Zhou. You don\u2019t even have anyone to take care of you in Qingzhou. It\u2019s extremely dangerous.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cAlright, don\u2019t worry. What could happen to me? Wait for me to come back.\u201d</p><br/><p>After hanging up, Lin Fan felt a little helpless.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang was a good friend but he talked too much.</p><br/><p>The next day!</p><br/><p>At night.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan left the hotel and hailed a cab.</p><br/><p>\u201cDriver, please send me to Yun Villa,\u201d Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>Then, the driver was stunned. He looked at Lin Fan and asked, \u201cYou\u2019re heading to Yun Villa?\u201d</p><br/><p>He seemed to be in disbelief. It was as if he didn\u2019t believe that Lin Fan was heading there.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m going to Yun Villa. What\u2019s wrong?\u201d Lin Fan asked.</p><br/><p>The driver replied, \u201cNothing much, I just wanted to confirm it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was still thinking to himself. He didn\u2019t know what the driver meant. However, when he was reaching Yun Villa, he understood why.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t because there was a problem with him. It was just that Yun Villa seemed like a terrific place.</p><br/><p>One glance at the place and every car that was parked outside were luxurious cars. His rented cab looked a little unique.</p><br/><p>\u201cDriver, what\u2019s the history of Yun Villa?\u201d Lin Fan asked curiously.</p><br/><p>The driver sighed, \u201cYun Villa is the grandest place in Qingzhou. There is everything here. People who come here are filthy rich. A cab driver like me can\u2019t even afford a night here with my annual salary.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh\u2026\u201d Lin Fan nodded. It looked like this place was filled with people leading a befuddled existence and that Ma Qing Zhou wanted him to see how things were like among the richest people there.</p><br/><p>However, he just didn\u2019t know if he could last the night.</p><br/><p>At the entrance.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan paid and left the car.</p><br/><p>The driver looked at Lin Fan and thought to himself. He wondered why Lin Fan was there for.</p><br/><p>This wasn\u2019t a place which normal citizens like him could go.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan stood at the entrance and looked around. He didn\u2019t know where to go.</p><br/><p>\u201cGodly doctor.\u201d Then, Liu Ren walked over from a distance away. He had been waiting for some time. When he saw the godly doctor, he immediately walked over.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked calm, \u201cIs Ma Qing Zhou inside?\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Ren chuckled, \u201cYes. Godfather Ma has been inside for some time. Some of the big shots of Qingzhou are inside too. They would like to meet you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled at the thought of people wanting to meet him. He wondered if it would traumatize him.</p><br/><p>He had to arrest Ma Qing Zhou tonight. He wasn\u2019t bothered by the support that Ma Qing Zhou had. He just had to do what he needed to do.</p></div>\n</div>"}

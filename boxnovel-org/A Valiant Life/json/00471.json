Just like that and the pain is gone?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is better than painkillers! The previous doctor said that she needed a painkiller injection, but this is so much cheaper and way more effective! What a Godly Doctor.\u201d</p><br/><p>In the face of all these compliments and praise, Lin Fan kept his cool and didn\u2019t take what they said to heart. The procedure that he was doing was ordinary and there was nothing much to brag about.</p><br/><p>Auntie Wang stood there frozen in a daze, surprised at what was happening in front of her. She had never thought that the pain that her daughter had been going through would be completely absolved by the man standing in front of her.</p><br/><p>This was a miracle.</p><br/><p>\u201cGodly Doctor,\u201d Auntie Wang said emotionally. She felt like there was hope, finally.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t talk yet, I\u2019m thinking,\u201d Lin Fan said as he raised his hand.</p><br/><p>Liu Jia Hui looked at Lin Fan in awe. She realized that this young lad was keeping his cool, and all he was doing was using one hand to press on her abdomen. With that, all her pain was gone.</p><br/><p>Unthinkable. Simply unthinkable.</p><br/><p>\u201cDoctor, will I live?\u201d Liu Jia Hui opened her mouth to ask. She had too many friends, family that she couldn\u2019t bear to leave and she had never even experienced romance before.</p><br/><p>If she left today, she would still have a lot of regrets.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled at her warmly, looking into her eyes. \u201cYou are strong. Your life will be blissful.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Jia Hui nodded her head, smiling after hearing what Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, do you need any help?\u201d Zhao Ming Qing asked from the side.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan took up a pen and wrote a list. \u201cUnwrap ninety-nine new acupuncture needles.\u201d</p><br/><p>This procedure was a little complicated and would require some time. Furthermore, it couldn\u2019t be cured in a day and would need acupuncture and Chinese medication. The healing process was going to be long.</p><br/><p>The good thing was that the rehabilitation process would only require medication and some rest. Lin Fan didn\u2019t have to be present.</p><br/><p>Liu Jia Hui panicked a little after looking at the long and thin needles which the Doctor was holding. \u201cDoctor, these needles are so long. Where are you going to insert that later?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you a movie-filmer?\u201d Lin Fan asked, distracting her. At that moment, he immediately inserted the silver needle into her acupuncture point.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow did you know?\u201d Liu Jia Hui asked, looking surprised, not realizing that the acupuncture needle had already been inserted.</p><br/><p>For Liu Jia Hui\u2019s close friends who were standing around, they couldn\u2019t help but cringe after seeing the long needle being thrust into her body. More than half the length was in her.</p><br/><p>\u201cI just know,\u201d Lin Fan raised his hands, grabbing another needle.</p><br/><p>\u201cDoctor, what happened to that needle that you were holding just now?\u201d Liu Jia Hui asked, looking shocked.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s already in your body,\u201d Lin Fan pointed at the needle.</p><br/><p>Liu Jia Hui looked down, realizing that there was silver needle protruding from her thigh. Her facial expression changed a little, but she didn\u2019t feel any pain at all as if the needle was never inserted.</p><br/><p>Auntie Wang and the rest gasped in awe after seeing what the Godly Doctor was doing. They felt that this doctor was completely different from all the other doctors that they had seen.</p><br/><p>All the other doctors would give looks of helplessness when treating her, signifying that the condition was untreatable and they could only try.</p><br/><p>They were filled with hope looking at the scene before them. \u201cYou don\u2019t happen to have a boyfriend, do you?\u201d Lin Fan laughed, asking as he continued to insert more acupuncture needles. His actions were as smooth as a flowing river and never for a moment, did he stop. His actions were especially quick when he was plunging the needles into her body, and it was impossible to keep track of them.</p><br/><p>Liu Jia Hui shook her head. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou should think about getting one after you recover, but don\u2019t look for one who is born in the year of the dragon. It isn\u2019t compatible with your attributes.\u201d Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>\u201cDoctor, you can read fortunes too?\u201d Liu Jia Hui gasped in surprise.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan continued to insert needles as he nodded his head seriously. \u201cThat\u2019s right! You\u2019re really sharp for picking that out.\u201d</p><br/><p>The people who were standing around were all shocked. This was a medical treatment and yet they were talking like nothing was happening.</p><br/><p>Liu Jia Hui\u2019s close friends all started laughing. \u201cGodly Doctor, there are a lot of people who are chasing after our Jia Hui, but we stop most of them because they don\u2019t fit her requirements.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed, as his hands continued to insert acupuncture needles, this time at a faster rate. Although the cancer was localized in one area, the reality was that it affected the whole body and localized treatment was not effective.</p><br/><p>If they had found and treated this earlier with a real Chinese Medicine Master, they could have used Chinese Medicine to condition her body and increase her immune response, even curbing the cancer, but the number of real Chinese Medicine Masters was low and they were rare.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, the most common response after finding out that she had cancer was to panic and go to a big hospital to get treated. The ending, however, was always the same-. The body would suffer a lot, and even if the cancer was treated, the doctors would always say that the chances of cancer recurring was high.</p><br/><p>The hospital.</p><br/><p>Doctor Shen came back to his office, his face red with anger. The more he thought about it, the more he couldn\u2019t stand it. Furthermore, the people involved were opposite the hospital and not inside the hospital. What could he do?</p><br/><p>\u201cForget it, I\u2019ll just let them be. By the time they finally regret it, it\u2019ll be too late.\u201d</p><br/><p>Thereafter, Doctor Shen went to check on the wards to see how his other patients were recovering.</p><br/><p>As he went into the ward, he stopped in his tracks as the color drained from his face. The room was empty.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere are the all the patients?\u201d Doctor Shen asked.</p><br/><p>The nurse shook her head. \u201cAll the patients just got up and left just now. I tried to ask them, but they didn\u2019t even bother replying.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s happening over here?\u201d Doctor Shen grappled with his head, unable to think of any logical explanation.</p><br/><p>Just at this moment, three patients, who had their family members with them, hurriedly made their way towards the elevator.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you guys doing here?\u201d Doctor Shen went up and asked them.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe heard that there is a Godly Doctor outside who is doing treatment. A lot of people have gone over to see him and some of them have recovered and immediately got discharged,\u201d one of the family members replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait a moment\u2026\u201d Doctor Shen said. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me you guys believe in this. There is absolutely no scientific evidence whatsoever regarding these kinds of treatments. Our treatments are backed by science and research!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, sure. All I get from believing in you guys is just an empty bank account. All those who have gone to get treated have been cured and we\u2019re already late to join the party. Come, let us hurry. Otherwise, we\u2019ll be late.\u201d</p><br/><p>Doctor Shen seethe with anger looking at this scene. \u201cWhat is up with all these people? No, this issue has to be reported immediately to the higher authorities.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Outside.</p><br/><p>The other patients were outside observing the Godly Doctor treating the woman and the treatment was taking rather long.</p><br/><p>\u201cGodly Doctor, what illness does this woman have?\u201d one of the patients sheepishly asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cNothing too serious,\u201d Lin Fan smiled, replying.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan intentionally didn\u2019t say that the woman had cervical cancer. If he did, he would probably end up scaring the other patients to death. How nature-defying it was to be able to treat that kind of disease!</p><br/><p>\u201cThen why are you taking so long for a minor problem?\u201d the other patients asked, realizing that something didn\u2019t add up.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m taking my time to treat her while admiring how pretty she is, is that okay?\u201d Lin Fan chuckled.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha\u2026\u201d ( )</p><br/><p>At this moment, all those who were standing around started laughing. They didn\u2019t expect such a doctor to be so serious about seeing his patients and yet so casual when making conversation with others all at the same time.</p><br/><p>Liu Jia Hui laughed as her cheeks blushed.</p><br/><p>All her close friends were standing around and laughing along as well.</p><br/><p>After taking out all the acupuncture needles from Liu Jia Hui\u2019s body, Lin Fan started writing a prescription and handed it to Auntie Wang. \u201cTake this prescription and go to the medicine hall later. Feed her the medicine four times a day, in the morning, afternoon, night and midnight. Also, she has to come back to me tomorrow for another acupuncture session. You can arrange it with this young man over here since we\u2019ll be going to another location to treat patients tomorrow.\u201d</p><br/><p>Auntie Wang took the prescription and kept it in a safe place. Thereafter, she looked at her daughter, almost unable to believe what she was seeing.</p><br/><p>\u201cHer complexion\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it much better?\u201d Lin Fan chuckled as he said.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes\u2026 yes\u2026\u201d Auntie Wang immediately nodded her head, gasping in unbelief.</p><br/><p>All the other people who were standing around also reacted in surprise.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, she looks way better now and her cheeks look so rosy! She doesn\u2019t look sick at all!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Godly Doctor is just too amazing!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHis skills are just too amazing! And the effect was just from this short duration!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed. If not for his superior skill and knowledge of acupuncture and the mysterious boost from the Encyclopedia, all of these wouldn\u2019t be possible.</p><br/><p>Just at this moment, a group of people could be seen walking towards them from afar.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s them\u2026\u201d the group of people, who were armed with cameras and recording equipment, said as they pointed at Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked up and scanned the area as he reacted in helplessness. \u201cDamn it, the reporters are here.\u201d</p><br/><p>He was most afraid of reporters.</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t escape from them.</p></div>\n</div>"}

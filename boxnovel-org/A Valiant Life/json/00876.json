However, they felt that this youngster in front of them was really powerful. They even felt like the swordsmanship skills of this youngster were even better than their mentor.</p><br/><p>The \u2018Silent Priest\u2019 had abundant knowledge and was powerful in terms of the Taoist Realm. He could tell that the swordsmanship skills were extraordinary and he even felt like it had reached the peak of Taoist swordsmanship.</p><br/><p>He was already very impressed with this youngster for having an extraordinary talent at such a young age. It was really unbelievable.</p><br/><p>Even if he were to train for over ten years, he still could not be compared to him.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-2\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>However, he felt as if there was something amiss. It felt that there was something evil.</p><br/><p>After a short while, Lin Fan stopped wielding the sword. Although he had already kept the sword, the influence of the sword was still really powerful. If it were to be described, it could be said that the power of the sword was too strong and it created a powerful atmosphere.</p><br/><p>\u201cPriest, how was that?\u201d Lin Fan smiled. The way most experts communicated was to show each other their skills.</p><br/><p>He felt that his relationship with the priest was going to move up to another level.</p><br/><p>The priest took a deep breath and tried to calm himself down. It wasn\u2019t because he was mute. He was trying to channel the Taoist Mind Concentration Power. However, he felt that he was going to fail soon.</p><br/><p>In the end, he managed to control it. He smiled and nodded.</p><br/><p>However, what Lin Fan said next shocked the \u2018Silent Priest\u2019.</p><br/><p>\u201cPriest, the absolute gives life to yin and yang. I know the yin and yang swordsmanship skills and the four division swordsmanship skills. As for the eight trigram swordsmanship skills, it has a lot to do with my Ba Gua Zhang. If you\u2019re interested, we can exchange our knowledge and skills\u2026\u201d Lin Fan smiled and didn\u2019t show any signs of holding back his capabilities.</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t stay there for too long and he wanted to quickly convince the priest.</p><br/><p>The fastest way he could do that was to convince him with his skills and create a good platform to communicate with him.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-3\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Others may not have understood what was going on. However, Lin Fan knew that the capabilities of the \u2018Silent Priest\u2019 were shockingly powerful. He was probably the most powerful person Lin Fan had ever seen in his life.</p><br/><p>In the eyes of average people, he would be considered a spiritual expert.</p><br/><p>\u201cHeh heh!\u201d</p><br/><p>The \u2018Silent Priest\u2019 chuckled. He was laughing on the outside but not on the inside. If he could speak, he would definitely be roaring in rage.</p><br/><p><em>What is he trying to do? Is he trying to say that he\u2019s better than me?</em></p><br/><p>Perhaps it was true that competition could really drive people crazy.</p><br/><p>The \u2018Silent Priest\u2019 didn\u2019t know what to say anymore.</p><br/><p>The young Taoist priest beside them sighed helplessly. This godlike mentor in his eyes had been under pressure since yesterday. It was a terribly depressing moment.</p><br/><p>He wanted to help his mentor get out of this situation but he didn\u2019t know how.</p><br/><p>There was still time before the arrival of the tourists.</p><br/><p>In the meantime, there was no other way for his mentor to escape this. He had to endure this for the time being.</p><br/><p>Outside the Taoist temple.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-4\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>A bunch of tourists had arrived at the foot of the mountain of the Wuxiang Taoist Temple. It was pitch-black and the tourists stared at each other in confusion. <em>What\u2019s going on? Are they filming a movie?</em></p><br/><p>Then, a solemn-looking middle-aged man was pushing a wheelchair. He looked at the person on the wheelchair and the person also stared at him helplessly.</p><br/><p>The person on the wheelchair was his daughter, Mu Hui Min. Initially, she hadn\u2019t been like this. However, she had contracted a bizarre disease and become mentally retarded. Furthermore, her body couldn\u2019t really move anymore.</p><br/><p>They had been to a lot of major hospitals, even those overseas. However, they couldn\u2019t diagnose her illness. It was an illness that hadn\u2019t been seen before.</p><br/><p>There was another middle-aged lady next to them. She was Mu Hui Min\u2019s mother. Seeing her daughter become like this pained her very much.</p><br/><p>\u201cDirector Mu, this is the Wuxiang Taoist Temple. The \u2018Silent Priest\u2019 is at the top of the mountain. I believe that, with his medical skills, he will be able to treat her illness,\u201d a man said.</p><br/><p>He was a high-ranking official of the Mu Family Corporation. Furthermore, his old flat was near the Wuxiang Taoist temple. As he hadn\u2019t returned to his old flat in a long time, he hadn\u2019t known that the \u2018Silent Priest\u2019 existed here.</p><br/><p>He had returned back from Sichuan to his old flat once to pray to the ancestors. He found out about the Wuxiang Taoist temple and asked people about it. He hadn\u2019t expected there to be such a powerful elderly priest in the Wuxiang Taoist Temple and he had been curious about it since then.</p><br/><p>Of course, he was just curious about it and he wasn\u2019t really interested in looking for him.</p><br/><p>However, the daughter of the Director of the Mu Family Corporation had suddenly contracted a bizarre disease. She had seen a lot of famous doctors but nobody was able to treat her illness.</p><br/><p>After a period of time, he suggested her to visit the Wuxiang Taoist temple near his old flat as there was an elderly priest with incredible medical skills that might be able to help her.</p><br/><p>At the same time, Director Mu had already run out of ideas and he decided to give it a go.</p><br/><p>Mu Dao Xiong nodded. \u201cI can only leave it to fate. I hope it\u2019ll be useful.\u201d</p><br/><p>He was an atheist and he only believed in science. He didn\u2019t really believe in these self-proclaimed powerful priests. However, he didn\u2019t have any other choice now and he decided to give it a try.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-5\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Before the flight of steps.</p><br/><p>Mu Dao Xiong carried his daughter and started to walk up tirelessly.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>When they reached the Taoist temple.</p><br/><p>Mu Dao Xiong helped his daughter back into the wheelchair and wiped the sweat off his forehead.</p><br/><p>Then, a young priest walked past them and saw them. He went forward.</p><br/><p>\u201cHi, may I know if there\u2019s anything we can help you with?\u201d</p><br/><p>Mu Dao Xiong asked, \u201cPriest, may I know if the \u2018Silent Priest\u2019 is around?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOur mentor is here. However, he is in the mountains practicing his swordsmanship. May I know what is it?\u201d the young priest asked. Although there were a lot of people that looked for his mentor daily, it was the first time someone had looked for him at such an early hour. After all, the people that usually visited him knew the opening hours of the Taoist temple.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is my daughter. She contracted a bizarre disease. I would like the \u2018Silent Priest\u2019 to take a look at her.\u201d Mu Dao Xiong sounded a little anxious because if he couldn\u2019t help her, that would mean that there was nobody that could cure her.</p><br/><p>Mu Hui Min\u2019s mother immediately went forward and asked anxiously, \u201cPlease help my daughter. Please get the \u2018Silent Priest\u2019 to save her.\u201d</p><br/><p>The young priest nodded. \u201cPlease hold on. I will ask my mentor about it. You can wait in the temple.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Mu Dao Xiong said.</p><br/><p>When the young priest left, the high-ranking official said, \u201cDirector Mu, don\u2019t worry. The \u2018Silent Priest\u2019 is really powerful. He will definitely be able to treat her.\u201d</p><br/><p>He had been working for Director Mu for more than ten years and had seen his daughter throughout her life until she contracted the disease. He was really anxious about it too after hearing about what had happened.</p><br/><p>He really hoped that the \u2018Silent Priest\u2019 could create some sort of miracle.</p><br/><p>\u201cSigh, I hope so.\u201d Mu Dao Xiong nodded. He wasn\u2019t very hopeful as he typically wouldn\u2019t believe in such things.</p><br/><p>However, what else could he do besides believing in it now?</p></div>\n</div>"}

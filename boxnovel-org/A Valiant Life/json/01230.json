They should not have eaten the Little Intelligence Pills. This had caused the teachers to become the students instead. The teachers had started to be taught by the kids there.</p><br/><p>They were shocked by the state of the kids, and they were worried about their impact on the world in the future.</p><br/><p>It was not a big deal to be well-read. However, they had become extremely intelligent because of the Little Intelligence Pill. They could pick up anything in no time. They did not need to worry about them at all.</p><br/><p>The international competition was nearing.</p><br/><p>It was slowly being reported again on the internet.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s three more days to the competition. I wonder if the two participants will succeed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho knows? I heard Jin Can has been working very hard. Zheng Ya wrote a few songs for her, and there were really good. It\u2019s not that far off from the international singers.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you kidding? How do you know?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c^ Zheng Ya said it himself. He said these were written from his heart.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnother self-praising fella. Master Lin has been really low-key about it. He didn\u2019t even brag about the songs that he wrote. The more you show off, the more unlucky you become.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Master Lin used to be a show off too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin was a show off because he was really capable.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s a little unsafe for Wu Huan Yue this time. If Master Lin were to write Chinese songs, I think that she would do a great job. However, since it\u2019s in English this time, it\u2019s going to be a difficult task.\u201d</p><br/><p>Because of this, many people were arguing about it online.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s coming soon!\u201d Lin Fan realised that it was nearing after watching the news.</p><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue called.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Lin, there\u2019s three days left until the competition. Will you be there?\u201d Wu Huan Yue was hoping that Brother Lin would go too.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, I have nothing to do anyway.\u201d Lin Fan knew what Wu Huan Yue was thinking, and he knew that she wanted him to be there.</p><br/><p>However, the competition was a form of training for Wu Huan Yue. If he went, perhaps Wu Huan Yue would perform even better.</p><br/><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Wu Huan Yue was ecstatic. She had not expected Brother Lin to agree.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. I\u2019ve never lied to anyone,\u201d Lin Fan said and smiled. Wu Huan Yue felt as if she was dreaming upon hearing that Lin Fan was going.</p><br/><p>That made him feel a little helpless.</p><br/><p>They ended the call.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Lin, can we go too?\u201d Zhao Zhong Yang asked. He really wanted to go have a look. Furthermore, it was a competition, and he wanted to livestream it.</p><br/><p>After all, this type of competition was not commonly broadcasted in the nation. If he could do it, it would be really great.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian raised his hand. \u201cI haven\u2019t left this country before. I want to go too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSure, let\u2019s go together then. Anyway, there\u2019s nothing much happening here too.\u201d</p><br/><p>Since everyone wanted to go, he felt that it would be great for them to support Wu Huan Yue too. There were only two of their fellow Chinese nationals participating in the competition, and neither of them were not familiar with the place. If nobody supported them, they would be really lonely there.</p><br/><p>They felt that it was necessary for them to be there and they had to gather more people there. However, it was pretty expensive. The amount of people from the shop was quite appropriate.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy should we rush? There\u2019s three more days,\u201d Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Lin, how could we not be anxious about it? We have to leave by tomorrow so that we can familiarise ourselves with the place. We will definitely run into problems if we leave in three days,\u201d Zhao Zhong Yang said.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true,\u201d Lin Fan replied. He felt that what Zhao Zhong Yang said was logical.</p><br/><p>The next day!</p><br/><p>Just as Zhao Zhong Yang had said, Wu Huan Yue was preparing to leave.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan only brought a few sets of clothes and Fraud Tian just wore his usual outfit. They arrived at the airport.</p><br/><p>This time, Zhao Zhong Yang brought a lot of different things.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy did you bring so many things?\u201d Lin Fan asked. He was stunned at the amount of things Zhao Zhong Yang brought.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Lin, these are my treasures that I need for broadcasting. I can\u2019t miss out on any of them.\u201d Zhao Zhong Yang looked really professional carrying those things.</p><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue was ecstatic when she saw everyone who came. She really wanted to succeed.</p><br/><p>\u201cBro, I can\u2019t be there this time. Everything depends on you this time,\u201d Wang Ming Yang said. Since the perfect artificial limbs had been doing really well, he was really busy.</p><br/><p>As for the competition, he wanted to let Lin Fan handle it.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, I know. I\u2019m following them. There will be no problem,\u201d Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t expect to meet Director Wang here,\u201d a few people said as they walked over.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang looked at them and asked, \u201cWow, Director Zhang, what brings you here? Are you going too?\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Zhang smiled. \u201cOf course. Jin Can is competing, and I have to be there as the boss. Furthermore, it\u2019s not just me. Zheng Ya is going too. We want her to get the award.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the group of people. There was a lady wearing sunglasses. He guessed that that person was Jin Can. There was also a man standing there wearing a cap which covered his face. That was probably Zheng Ya.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, I have heard many great things about you.\u201d Director Zhang looked at Lin Fan and greeted him politely. There was a hidden meaning behind all that politeness.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d Lin Fan replied indifferently. He was expected to reply politely too. However, he was someone that held grudges. Hence, he just greeted him coldly.</p><br/><p>Director Zhang did not behave awkwardly at all. He just replied, \u201cI heard Master Lin\u2019s English is not very good, but you can still write English songs. It\u2019s impressive.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d Lin Fan replied coldly again. It seemed like he did not want to speak to him too much.</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang covered his mouth and sniggered.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt looks like Master Lin is a little indifferent,\u201d Director Zhang said and smiled. However, there seemed to be a hidden meaning behind his smile. It was as if he was waiting for them to lose on competition day.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

One by one, more and more cars started to park outside.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-1\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>There were quite a few well-dressed businessmen waiting outside as well.</p><br/><p>The university\u2019s security guards felt extremely helpless after seeing so many people in front of them.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy security guard brothers, do you know what is going on right now?\u201d the manager of a pharmaceutical company had personally come over. With regards to this situation, the managers of every single pharmaceutical company kept a close eye on it.</p><br/><p>If the development of the prescription was really successful, it would definitely be a very major thing.</p><br/><p>These security guards had never been addressed by anyone before, especially not this kind of people, the kind of people who were extremely well-dressed and had nice cars. With one glance, you could tell that they were rich.</p><br/><p>Thinking back, all the rich people would never even bother to look them in the eye. So right now, being noticed by these people made them feel extremely happy.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-2\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cI have no idea. This is the Chinese Medical Academy, I\u2019ll have to ask you to leave so as to not disturb the students who are having lessons,\u201d the security guard very righteously said.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be like that, brother. Come, have a cigarette.\u201d A man took out a box of cigarettes and placed it in the security guard\u2019s pocket. Then, he took out a cigarette from the box and personally lit it up for the guard.</p><br/><p>The security guard secretly took a glance. He had a weird feeling inside him when he realized that there were more than a hundred sticks of cigarettes there.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother, can I trouble you to tell me what the situation inside is like?\u201d the man continued to ask. After the man said that, a few people rushed over.</p><br/><p>The people that came over were definitely the man\u2019s rivals. It seemed like all of them were after Master Lin\u2019s prescription.</p><br/><p>After taking the man\u2019s cigarettes, the security guard definitely had to do something for him. The security guard took a puff of his cigarette and then said, \u201cI don\u2019t really know anything about what\u2019s going on inside. However, Master Lin has been at work in the research lab the whole day already. He hasn\u2019t even stepped out of the room. All his meals have been sent into the room by other people.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLooks like there isn\u2019t any news from there yet. Where is the research lab?\u201d the man anxiously asked. He knew that the information that had just been given to him was not of much use.</p><br/><p>In addition, he also did not know which pharmaceutical company would be able to get a partnership with Lin Fan. If they were able to become partners with him, they would definitely have hit the jackpot.</p><br/><p>Thus, the competition amongst them was incomparable.</p><br/><p>The security guard laughed and replied, \u201cI\u2019m just a security guard, how would I know?\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-3\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cNo, no, brother, that won\u2019t do. If you let me in, I\u2019ll give you a huge red packet,\u201d the man said.</p><br/><p>The security guard heard him and waved him off. He replied, \u201cThat won\u2019t do. If I let you in, I\u2019ll lose my job. Don\u2019t try and get me in trouble.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis\u2026\u201d The man was getting impatient. He did not know what to do right now and he also did not know what was going on inside.</p><br/><p>The fact that Master Lin was developing a prescription for Leukemia was something that everyone already knew about. Also, if he really could develop a prescription, it would have a huge impact.</p><br/><p>No matter what happened, they had to be there to get firsthand news.</p><br/><p>However, this security guard was being a pain in the a*s and blocking the entrance.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cDirector Wang, how is it? Have you been able to get any information?\u201d the director of another pharmaceutical company came over and asked him.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf only I could. I haven\u2019t been able to get anything at all.\u201d Director Wang helplessly shook his head. At this point in time, more and more competitors had come over. He was getting more and more unsure if he would be able to get that partnership with Lin Fan. Whichever pharmaceutical company was able to get that partnership would definitely take off.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you think that Master Lin will really be able to develop a prescription?\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Wang replied, \u201cThat I don\u2019t know. However, we all know what level Master Lin\u2019s medical skills are at. He is truly godlike in this aspect. Regardless, we definitely still need to wait. What if he really is able to do it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDirector Wang, how about we work together on this? You probably can see it already. There are so many other pharmaceutical companies here, it\u2019s definitely not going to be easy to fight with them. If we work together though, we might stand a chance.\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-4\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Right now, everyone wanted to get the partnership all for themselves. However, the crucial part was still the getting of the partnership. If they really wanted to get it, they had to bite the bullet and work together.</p><br/><p>The situation at that moment was as if there was an army of thousands of men trying to cross a single-log bridge. They were all just trying to see who would get chosen. If they were to work together, the chances of getting chosen would definitely increase.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see. Right now, we don\u2019t even know if this prescription will even be developed or not.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat is true.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>All the reporters had come over to the academy in Shanghai. They felt obligated to know about what was going on inside. If the people of pharmaceutical companies did not come down to the Chinese Medical Academy to wait, they would definitely be cursing themselves in the future.</p><br/><p>The next day!</p><br/><p>The news reports came out.</p><br/><p>\u2018A large group of pharmaceutical company owners is gathered outside the entrance to the Chinese Medical Academy, waiting for the development of the prescription.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Do you think it will be good if the distribution of the prescription is to be handled by one of these pharmaceutical companies?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The large variety of headlines popping up drew the attention of many viewers.</p><br/><p>Some of the citizens rushed to get their comments in regarding this situation.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe definitely can\u2019t let these pharmaceutical companies handle the distribution of it. If they handle it, it will definitely be very expensive.\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-5\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. Right now, even for flu medicine, it costs about 40 dollars to buy some. If the distribution of the prescription for Leukemia is handled by these pharmaceutical companies, you might not even be able to buy it with a few thousand dollars.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI feel like Master Lin won\u2019t let these pharmaceutical companies handle it. Master Lin has said before that he doesn\u2019t care about earning money.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c^ are you dumb? How can you even believe such things? Many rich and powerful people have said this and yet in the end still amass such a huge fortune. If you were in this situation, wouldn\u2019t you also try and stick your butt out and amass an even larger fortune?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. It\u2019s dumb to believe such words. Have you ever seen anyone who doesn\u2019t care about money?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, right now, the prescription hasn\u2019t even been developed so all these discussions are useless.\u201d</p><br/><p>On the Internet.</p><br/><p>The buzz surrounding Lin Fan developing a prescription for Leukemia had not dropped but had actually risen. This was especially true for those suffering from Leukemia who were monitoring the news every day, hoping to see the news they were hoping for.</p><br/><p>Even though they knew that it would require a period of time, they desperately wanted the prescription to be developed right now.</p><br/><p>In the research lab.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was brewing the Chinese medicine. Whenever a recipe was concocted, he would carefully take a taste of it before spitting it out.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, no. It has no effect at all,\u201d Lin Fan shook his head and said.</p><br/><p>This was already their 68th attempt.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing saw how his teacher was sampling all the medicine and he could not help getting worried. \u201cTeacher, sampling the medicine like this won\u2019t have any effect on you, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved him off and said, \u201cIf you drink it then there will be a problem. If I drink it, there won\u2019t be. Now stop talking rubbish and continue your research.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh\u2026\u201d Zhao Ming Qing could not understand why his teacher was fine even after drinking all that medicine but he did not think about it too much and continued his research.</p><br/><p>Although the entire process was very dull and it was just repeating their original process over and over again, Zhao Ming Qing found an endless amount of joy from it.</p><br/><p>Although they had not been able to develop a prescription yet, through this entire process, he had gained a much greater understanding of Chinese medicine.</p><br/><p>Over the course of all their attempts, he had learned a lot of things that he had not known before.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan also realized that Ming Qing had improved and nodded in appreciation.</p><br/><p>Skill and hard work. Those were indispensable things even at an old age.</p><br/><p>Also, at this point in time, some medical treatment units were conducting a discussion.</p><br/><p>The main topic of this discussion was the prescription for Leukemia. Although the prescription had not been developed yet, many of the people inside felt like the probability of a prescription being developed was about 80%.</p></div>\n</div>"}

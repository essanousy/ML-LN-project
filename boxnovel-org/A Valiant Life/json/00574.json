The situation was tight and if not for the mystical boost of the Encyclopedia, he wouldn\u2019t have dared to answer him.</p><br/><p>However, things were getting out of hand and he couldn\u2019t afford to delay any more time.</p><br/><p>He looked around and went to a few females to take their hairpins. Then, he straightened them and use them as acupuncture needles. In such an urgent situation, where was he going to get them from? He had to make the best out of what he had.</p><br/><p>The principal was dumbfounded. \u201cIt\u2019s over\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Teacher Zhang kneeled on the rooftop and he covered his face when he saw what happened below. He didn\u2019t expect to see his own student commit suicide in front of him.</p><br/><p>It was extremely difficult to accept that.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Teacher Zhang stood up and hurried down.</p><br/><p>At the ground floor.</p><br/><p>Li Yang was dumbfounded. He didn\u2019t expect Chen Liang to have dared to jump down. What did the last sentence mean? Was he going to drag him to hell with him?</p><br/><p>The others didn\u2019t notice him, they were staring at Chen Liang who had fallen from the rooftop. He was prepared to leave sneakily.</p><br/><p>Just when he turned around, Teacher Zhang grabbed Li Yang, he said furiously, \u201cLi Yang, what have you done?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Yang was anxious but he pretended to be calm. \u201cTeacher Zhang, what do you mean by that? I didn\u2019t do anything.\u201d</p><br/><p>*slap*</p><br/><p>Teacher Zhang immediately slapped him, \u201cYou\u2019re literally inhumane.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Yang was stunned. He realized that the other students were looking at him. Then, he shouted, \u201cAre you looking for trouble?\u201d</p><br/><p>Teacher Zhang knew that Li Yang\u2019s family was pretty influential. He usually ignored the stupid things that he did. However, he had caused the death of someone today.</p><br/><p>Even if his family was extremely influential, he couldn\u2019t tolerate it anymore. He immediately slapped him.</p><br/><p>The surrounding students didn\u2019t expect Li Yang to have dared to scold a teacher. When they realized that, most of them didn\u2019t focus on it as they were looking at Chen Liang.</p><br/><p>Teacher Zhang told a few Physical Education teachers, \u201cLook after him. Don\u2019t let him run away.\u201d</p><br/><p>The teachers nodded. This was a grave matter. They had to watch Li Yang closely.</p><br/><p>Teacher Zhang came to Elder Chen, \u201cMr. Chen, I\u2019m sorry. I am the form teacher and I failed to look after him. It is my fault.\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Chen sat on the floor and he was stunned. He didn\u2019t even care about Elder Zhang. He just stared at Chen Liang.</p><br/><p>Then, Lin Fan opened up Chen Liang\u2019s clothes and his body was filled with patches of green and purple. It was traumatizing.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was stunned. This wasn\u2019t supposed to be the case for a person who had just jumped down from a high story. Then, he looked at Teacher Zhang, \u201cLook closely.\u201d Then, he didn\u2019t say much as he started to stabilize Chen Liang\u2019s condition.</p><br/><p>Elder Zhang was stunned when he saw Chen Liang\u2019s injuries.</p><br/><p>These injuries were done by man. It wasn\u2019t caused by him jumping down the building. Then, he looked at Li Yang and his eyes were filled with rage.</p><br/><p>How did this happen? The only person he could\u2019ve thought of was Li Yang.</p><br/><p>Chen Liang once told him that Li Yang asked him to beat someone up. He thought that it was just a small conflict between students. Then, he talked to Li Yang about it. Li Yang promised to stop bullying him. Who knew that this would happen?</p><br/><p>He was blaming himself and he felt that he was responsible for it.</p><br/><p>As the teacher in charge of the class, he actually allowed this to happen. This was all because of him.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Boss.\u201d Elder Chen recovered from his sadness and he looked at Little Boss who was trying to save his son.</p><br/><p>Elder Liang covered Elder Chen\u2019s mouth. \u201cShh, Elder Chen, I know you are devastated. Little Boss is trying to save your son. Don\u2019t disturb him. If Little Boss can\u2019t save him, it\u2019d be hopeless.\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Liang shook his head and sighed. He didn\u2019t expect this to happen.</p><br/><p>Then, Lin Fan looked very serious. The temporary tools to replace those that he needed weren\u2019t sanitized and perhaps an infection would happen. However, he had no choice. He had to secure his life.</p><br/><p>He opened up a few acupoints.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t enough. He had to use the mystical boost of the Encyclopedia.</p><br/><p>His palm pressed on Chen Liang\u2019s body and it looked as if he was massaging him but he was actually sustaining his life using the mystical boost. At the same time, he started to treat his body.</p><br/><p>The police vehicle and ambulance came.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan started to let go and he heaved a sigh of relief.</p><br/><p>His life was temporarily sustained but the situation was still dangerous.</p><br/><p>Elder Chen looked at Lin Fan, \u201cLittle Boss, how is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded. He patted Elder Chen\u2019s shoulder, \u201cThere\u2019s still hope. But it\u2019s a little troublesome. Don\u2019t be anxious, I am here. There wouldn\u2019t be a problem.\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Chen anxiously nodded, \u201cLittle Boss, I believe in you. I know you can do it.\u201d</p><br/><p>The paramedics came and they knew that someone had committed suicide. They had made ample preparation. One of the nurses was prepared to shift Chen Liang into the ambulance but Lin Fan stopped her. \u201cDon\u2019t move him like that. Support his back with your hands. Don\u2019t remove the needles.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan see four metal needles and placed them around Chen Liang\u2019s heart. He had to ensure that the area around his heart had proper blood circulation. At the same time, it would help to keep his heart pumping.</p><br/><p>Chen Liang\u2019s throat opening was blocked by blood. He opened up a small opening at his throat to ensure that air is able to flow properly. At the same time, there was an acupuncture needle at his neck to prevent blood from flowing out. If not, the injury would be fatal.</p><br/><p>What was left to do was for him to operate on him in the hospital.</p><br/><p>The surgery was going to be complicated but he had complete confidence.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d The doctor frowned. It was a fatal situation and he was still trying to dictate things?</p><br/><p>Lin Fan didn\u2019t bother to answer him. \u201cMaster Lin from Cloud Street. Do you know me?\u201d</p><br/><p>The doctor was stunned. He became emotional, \u201cThe godly doctor.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded, \u201cYeah. Send him to the hospital and tell your director that I will be operating on him personally. Nobody else is supposed to touch him.\u201d</p><br/><p>The doctor smiled, \u201cGodly doctor, don\u2019t worry. I will be following closely. I won\u2019t let anyone touch him.\u201d</p><br/><p>He knew about Shanghai\u2019s godly doctor. He was the idol of all the medical doctors. Everyone knew about his voluntary consultation booth.</p><br/><p>His godly pair of hands saved so many people and his medical skills were incredible.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Chen, Elder Liang, go on the ambulance. I\u2019ll be driving to the hospital and will be waiting there for you,\u201d Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The police arrived and started to investigate the matter. Those students that bullied Chen Liang were all frightened when they saw the police. However, nobody knew that it was caused by them. They lowered their heads and acted like nothing had happened.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at Li Yang and stood in front of him.</p><br/><p>Li Yang looked at Lin Fan in fear, \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>*slap*</p><br/><p>Teacher Zhang stood aside and didn\u2019t do anything to stop him. He just watched Li Yang collapse to the ground after Lin Fan slapped him.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m giving all of you a chance,\u201d Lin Fan looked at the other students in the crowd.</p><br/><p>The other students were extremely afraid when they saw what was happening. They were the kids of ordinary families. They haven\u2019t encountered such a situation before.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not me, it\u2019s Li Yang. He pulled Chen Liang to the area behind the toilet during our physical education lesson. Then, he started to beat him up.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t participate. Li Yang was the one who wanted to teach Chen Liang a lesson.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, the other students started to blame Li Yang.</p><br/><p>The police officers also began to understand the situation.</p><br/><p>\u201cBring him away and investigate this matter.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan didn\u2019t have time to waste on them. He just looked at Li Yang again and left the school immediately.</p><br/><p>\u201cTime for a meeting. Everyone, come for the meeting now.\u201d The principal was in a terrible mood. They had to get rid of violence in the school.</p></div>\n</div>"}

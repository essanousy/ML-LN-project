He was so fast that if people saw him, they would have their tongues tied in disbelief.</p><br/><p>To humans, climbing up to the 21st floor would be very, very tiring. But to Elder Dog, it was too simple.</p><br/><p>However, the further up he got, the hotter it became. But right now, Elder Dog didn\u2019t think about all this. He continued to climb up fearlessly.</p><br/><p>\u201cWaa waa\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Dog suddenly stopped. His dog ears shook. He heard wailing sounds. Then, he raised his dog head and confirmed his target before increasing his speed even more.</p><br/><p>When he reached the 21st floor, the flames had engulfed everything and the thick black smoke covered his vision. He could not see what was ahead.</p><br/><p>A burst of flames came rushing out, enveloping Elder Dog.</p><br/><p>But in an instant, a figure charged through the flames viciously. Besides his fur curling up, the fire did not affect him much.</p><br/><p>*crash*</p><br/><p>*creak*</p><br/><p>The ceiling had been engulfed in flames and the keel of the wood broke. A large piece of the ceiling came falling down towards Elder Dog.</p><br/><p>Bam!</p><br/><p>Elder Dog was completely covered.</p><br/><p>If it had been any other dog, it would\u2019ve been squashed to death or burnt to death.</p><br/><p>Woof woof!</p><br/><p>But at this moment, Elder Dog cried out and lifted the thick and heavy piece of the ceiling. Then, he swiftly continued running upstairs. The scorching heat made him very uncomfortable but he heard the wailing sounds again.</p><br/><p>From the wailing sounds, he could feel that the life was gradually fading away.</p><br/><p>In front of Righteous Elder Dog Nicholas, how could there be any danger?</p><br/><p>Without caring how hot it was, he sprinted upstairs with his dog legs carrying him.</p><br/><p>In those steady eyes, there was not a shred of fear.</p><br/><p>A door that had turned red from the heat blocked Elder Dog\u2019s way.</p><br/><p>Elder Dog stood in his original spot. Then, he barked several times at the door before raising his paws and hitting the door.</p><br/><p>Woof woof!</p><br/><p>Elder Dog instantly retracted his paws. Two bright red paw prints remained on the metal door.</p><br/><p>\u201cHot! Hot!\u201d Elder Dog realized that his paws\u2019 soft pads were very weak. Then, he stuck out his tongue to lick them. This made him feel slightly better.</p><br/><p>Waa!</p><br/><p>The wailing sounds were emitted from the other side of the door. No one else could hear them but Elder Dog heard them crystal-clearly.</p><br/><p>Woof woof~</p><br/><p>Elder Dog took a few steps back and stared aggressively at the metal door. Then, he raised his speed and sent his whole body colliding with the metal door. The fur that came into contact with the door made sizzling sounds as if they had started burning up. But what followed closely was\u2026</p><br/><p>A crashing sound.</p><br/><p>The metal door had been knocked open.</p><br/><p>Elder Dog landed inside the house and rolled a few times before standing back on his feet. Without hesitation, he charged towards the bedroom.</p><br/><p>The fire inside was huge but the bedroom was directly opposite the toilet. Because of the fire, water was spraying out from the toilet and it was temporarily controlling the speed of the fire\u2019s spreading.</p><br/><p>Elder Dog leaped up grabbed the door handle with his paws. He pushed down and the door was opened.</p><br/><p>Indeed, a child\u2019s bed appeared in Elder Dog\u2019s sight. Inside, an infant that had been wrapped up was wailing.</p><br/><p>Also, a window at the side was open, allowing ventilation and keeping the temperature down. This, in turn, had prevented the infant from being killed by the heat.</p><br/><p>Elder Dog jumped into the cradle and stopped. He was thinking about how he could bring the infant out safely. Leaving via the corridor was impossible. The heat and smoke would instantly take this young life.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Elder Dog saw the open window. Then, he jumped onto the window ledge and looked down.</p><br/><p>He returned to the cradle and licked the infant\u2019s face before picking up that wrapped-up baby with his mouth. Then, he jumped onto the window ledge once more and jumped out through the window.</p><br/><p>Bam!</p><br/><p>He landed on the air conditioning condenser unit.</p><br/><p>Waa!</p><br/><p>The infant started wailing from the shock.</p><br/><p>Elder Dog saw that the 20th floor wasn\u2019t safe so he jumped towards the next floor, landing firmly on the 19th floor.</p><br/><p>However, jumping down from such a height caused a great shock. This caused the infant to cry unceasingly. At the same time, the infant\u2019s initially red face had turned purple.</p><br/><p>Although Elder Dog didn\u2019t know the reason, he could feel the infant\u2019s life force gradually getting weaker. He knew that he could not continue jumping down.</p><br/><p>Suddenly.</p><br/><p>The air conditioning condenser unit started to become unstable as it started shaking.</p><br/><p>Elder Dog lost his balance and fell. His paws grabbed onto the condenser unit. Those sharp dog paws penetrated the condenser, allowing him to safely regain his balance.</p><br/><p>That had been way too close. If he hadn\u2019t grabbed on, he would have fallen from that height. The outcome would have been too ugly to imagine.</p><br/><p>Elder Dog looked at the 19th floor.</p><br/><p>The 19th floor was safe at the moment. Then, he jumped into the building while biting onto the wrapped-up infant before dashing down the stairs.</p><br/><p>If anyone had witnessed this scene, he or she would definitely be staring stupidly in shock. It seemed impossible. How could a dog be so smart and so strong?</p><br/><p>But it was a shame. This series of perfect maneuvers by Elder Dog had not been seen by anyone, nor had it been recorded.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Outside.</p><br/><p>Another fire engine arrived.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe fire on the 24th floor is under control.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAim the water cannon at that 23rd floor and focus on extinguishing the flame.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was a busy scene outside All the firefighters were putting their all into extinguishing the flames.</p><br/><p>However, the atmosphere didn\u2019t feel right.</p><br/><p>The townsfolk couldn\u2019t be happy because when they saw the young couple sitting on the ground, hugging their heads and crying, they could only sigh helplessly.</p><br/><p>Fires are merciless. A young life that had just been born was going to be lost in this fire.</p><br/><p>The firefighters felt very guilty. \u201cSorry. We\u2019ve already tried our best.\u201d</p><br/><p>At the same time, they were crying out in their hearts, \u201cWhy aren\u2019t there longer ladders? If there are, then things would be different.\u201d</p><br/><p>The surrounding townsfolk didn\u2019t know how to comfort the couple.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou guys are still young. There will be more opportunities.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. This is something that no one wants.\u201d</p><br/><p>This was very painful for the young couple. Their cries were heartbreaking and everyone else felt sorrowful as they saw this.</p><br/><p>That young mother, in particular, was blaming herself.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all because of me. If I hadn\u2019t gone to buy vegetables, leaving our child alone at home, even if there was a fire, I would have been able to carry him to safety. Why did things turn out like this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a responsible mother. This is all because of me.\u201d</p><br/><p>The spectating townsfolk saw this and sighed. Judging by the situation, without a miracle, it seemed that the young mother was going to crumble. This would leave an emotional scar on her for the rest of her life.</p><br/><p>Waa!</p><br/><p>Suddenly, a clear and crisp wailing sound came from afar.</p><br/><p>Everyone heard it and looked into the distance, at the pitch-black staircase entrance.</p><br/><p>Everyone was in incomparable astonishment. They didn\u2019t dare to believe it.</p><br/><p>At that instant, a figure appeared in everyone\u2019s vision.</p><br/><p>A dirty, soot-covered, little dog was slowly walking out from the staircase entrance.</p><br/><p>And in that little dog\u2019s mouth was a wrapped-up infant.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is that dog that ran in just now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt can\u2019t be. How could it be? What\u2019s that in the dog\u2019s mouth?\u201d</p><br/><p>The wailing sounds became more and more resounding.</p><br/><p>When the young couple heard the infant\u2019s voice, they suddenly looked up and to the front.</p><br/><p>Elder Dog took large strides and quickly left the danger zone. He brought the infant to the middle of the crowd and placed it on the ground.</p><br/><p>Woof woof!</p><br/><p>Elder Dog barked towards the young couple.</p><br/><p>The young couple ran over frantically and embraced the infant.</p><br/><p>The young man said ecstatically, \u201cThis is my son! He\u2019s fine! He\u2019s fine!\u201d</p><br/><p>The crowd instantly started bustling.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn! What happened? The infant has come out.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA mutt bit onto the infant and carried it down safely from the 21st floor.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow is that possible? How did this dog go up? And how did it come down?\u201d</p><br/><p>Over at the firefighters\u2019 side.</p><br/><p>Everyone had received this news. That infant on the 21st floor had safely come out. And it was a mutt that had brought it out.</p><br/><p>At this moment, everyone was in a commotion. It seemed impossible. However, the reality was right before them. They had to believe it.</p><br/><p>The doctors on-site immediately checked on the infant. In the end, they confirmed that the infant was fine. It only had some small symptoms but there were no major issues.</p><br/><p>The young man immediately knelt down and patted Elder Dog Nicholas\u2019 dog head. Then, he said emotionally, \u201cThank you, little dog, thank you. Thank you so much!\u201d</p><br/><p>The young man had started crying. He had never expected a mutt to save his son\u2019s life.</p><br/><p>If he hadn\u2019t seen it for himself, he wouldn\u2019t have believed it.</p><br/><p>Elder Dog\u2019s white fur had turned pitch-black. He lay on the ground and licked his paws. Then, he stood up and barked at the crowd a few times as he prepared to leave.</p><br/><p>But at this moment, the young man took out his phone. \u201cLittle dog, can you take a photo with my son? His life was saved by you. When he grows up, I have to let him remember your grace.\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Dog understood this. He started barking.</p><br/><p>Then, the young woman put the infant down. Elder Dog bit on the wrapped-up infant and stood there.</p><br/><p>*kacha*</p><br/><p>The photo was captured and Elder Dog put the infant down. Looking at the sky, it was getting late. Then, without waiting for the townsfolk\u2019s cheers, he left the place, striding on his little legs.</p><br/><p>The young man wanted to shout for Elder Dog to stop. He wanted to keep and raise Elder Dog. But in an instant, that little dog had disappeared from everyone\u2019s views.</p><br/><p>Everyone there would never forget that silhouette.</p><br/><p>Then, they looked at each other.</p><br/><p>If they hadn\u2019t seen that in person, they would never have believed that it was true.</p><br/><p>Also, those reporters at the scene had recorded the whole thing.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p></div>\n</div>"}

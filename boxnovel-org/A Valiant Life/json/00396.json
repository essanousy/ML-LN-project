He was doing well in both the corporate and government sectors. Although he didn't take the initiative to look for patients, people that fell ill would always look for him because he had superb medical skills. He was popular with a lot of people.</p><br/><p>\"Uncle Sun.\" Zhao Li Xing and the other two brothers lowered their heads. It was as if their eyes were asking their uncle for help.</p><br/><p>Sun Zong Yun looked at the situation. \"Elder Zhao, what are you doing? Quickly put it down. You're already so old. Why are you doing this? Listen to me and put it down. If not, I'll get angry.\"</p><br/><p>Elder Mu quickly dragged Sun Zong Yun aside. \"Elder Sun, don't say that. Elder Zhao is furious. Don't blame it on him. If not, things will get worse.\"</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing was furious when he heard Sun Zong Yun's words. He shouted, \"Sun Zong Yun!\"</p><br/><p>Sun Zong Yun was stunned. It was the first time Elder Zhao had shouted his full name. In the past, he used to address him as Elder Sun.</p><br/><p>\"I met you when I was sixteen years old. A few decades have passed and you're still my good friend. I invited all of you as guests to witness me receiving a mentor but all of you didn't turn up. It was difficult for me and my mentor,\" Zhao Ming Qing said sternly.</p><br/><p>\"Elder Zhao, what are you saying? When did I make things difficult for you?\" Sun Zong Yun rebutted.</p><br/><p>\"I'm not talking nonsense,\" Zhao Ming Qing said firmly.</p><br/><p>Then, Sun Zong Yun was stunned. He realized that Elder Zhao wasn't joking at all. He was completely serious. Then, Elder Mu nudged Sun Zong Yun. \"Elder Sun, Elder Zhao is really furious this time.\"</p><br/><p>Sun Zong Yun looked at Elder Mu and wondered what had happened. Then, he said, \"Elder Zhao, don't be angry. We didn't mean to make things difficult for you. You\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing's eyes were red. \"I, Zhao Ming Qing, will sever all ties with Sun Zong Yun from today onwards.\"</p><br/><p>Uproar!</p><br/><p>Zhao Shi was stunned. \"Elder Zhao, do you know what you're saying?\"</p><br/><p>Sun Zong Yun stood there in disbelief. \"Elder Zhao, I've known you for so many years and you want to sever ties with me?\"</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing and Sun Zong Yun had shared a friendship for over a few decades and their relationship was extremely close. Sun Zong Yun couldn't tolerate what Zhao Ming Qing had said. He was trembling and his eyes had turned red. He shouted, \"Elder Zhao, repeat what you just said!\"</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing's nose twitched. \"I, Zhao Ming Qing, have just received my first and only mentor in my entire life. You, Sun Zong Yun, have always been my closest friend and you didn't even come. That shows that you look down on me and my mentor. I\u2026\"</p><br/><p>He didn't get to finish his sentence as Elder Mu immediately went forward and covered Zhao Ming Qing's mouth. \"Elder Zhao, that's enough. You can't blame it on them.\"</p><br/><p>\"Elder Mu, let go. Let him continue,\" Sun Zong Yun said as he looked at Zhao Ming Qing.</p><br/><p>Zhao Li Xing and his two brothers were stunned when they saw this scene. They knew that they had done an utterly stupid thing.</p><br/><p>\"Dad, you can't blame Uncle Sun about this. It's all because of me\u2026\" Zhao Li Xing said.</p><br/><p>Then, more people came.</p><br/><p>\"Why are you here?\" They were Zhao Ming Qing's old friends and they were all situated in Shanghai. When they had heard Zhao Li Xing's call, they hurried over. They felt extremely helpless.</p><br/><p>Then, they realized that the situation was wrong. Zhao Ming Qing and Sun Zong Yun looked extremely emotional. It was as if they had just fought.</p><br/><p>Elder Mu went forward. \"Elder Li, it's good that you are here. This is bad. Elder Zhao wants to sever all ties with Elder Sun. Please come and persuade him.\"</p><br/><p>Elder Li was almost seventy years old. He asked, \"What happened?\"</p><br/><p>Elder Mu told him everything and Elder Li's expression changed when he heard it. He hadn't expected Elder Zhao to really receive a mentor. Furthermore, he had done it with the entire hall empty. They hadn't even been there yet. What did that represent? It was pretty obvious to them.</p><br/><p>To others, it might not have seemed like something malicious. The worst thing that could have happened was upsetting the host. However, it was different for them. They were extremely close friends and if someone were to receive a mentor, it had a deep meaning. It was something that was traditional for them.</p><br/><p>\"That's too much.\" Elder Li only had one thing in mind. Then, he looked at the three of them kneeling on the ground. He felt extremely helpless. Those three rascals just loved to cause trouble.</p><br/><p>Gradually, more people came. They were all extremely good friends of Zhao Ming Qing. Those academics who loved to discuss ideas with him also came and they were stunned.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing didn't even give them a chance to explain themselves. He immediately faced all of them.</p><br/><p>Elder Mu tried to appease Sun Zong Yun, \"Elder Sun, don't be rash. Elder Zhao was just angry. Just wait for a moment.\"</p><br/><p>Sun Zong Yun shook his head. \"No. I know him best. He won't just say something like this. In the past, he's never said something so ruthless whenever we fought. I know that he means what he said today.\"</p><br/><p>Zhao Li Xing and his siblings were extremely remorseful. They didn't know what to say. If they had known that things would end up like that, they wouldn't have made those arrangements. However, it was too late.</p><br/><p>They knew their father well and he must have been extremely serious about what he had said.</p><br/><p>Just when the situation was looking unfavorable, a phone call came.</p><br/><p>*Ding ding!*</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing took out his phone and when he saw the incoming call, his expression changed. He picked it up and addressed the person respectfully, \"Teacher.\"</p><br/><p>Then, Lin Fan had opened his car door and called Zhao Ming Qing. Before he left, he had read Zhao Ming Qing's fortune and realized that he was going to break all friendship ties. Then, he had known what was going to happen.</p><br/><p>\"Put me on the loudspeaker.\"</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing immediately switched to loudspeaker mode.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan thought about what he was going to say to appease the situation. It wouldn't have been convenient for him to be there. He understood that he was still young and if he had been present, it would definitely have made things more awkward.</p><br/><p>\"Did you hear what I said?\"</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing nodded. \"Teacher, I did.\"</p><br/><p>\"Okay.\"</p><br/><p>Then, he hung up the phone. Zhao Ming Qing looked at everyone. \"I'm sorry. I was too angry. Elder Sun, I'm sorry.\"</p><br/><p>Everyone looked at each other and was stunned. They heard the young voice from the phone and they were all puzzled. Who's Elder Zhao's mentor?</p><br/><p>Could it really be like what Zhao Li Xing and his siblings said? Could Elder Zhao's mentor really be a young man?</p><br/><p>Furthermore, Elder Zhao was so obedient. He had made things look so ugly earlier but now, things seemed totally fine.</p><br/><p>They all wanted to ask questions but they decided not to after looking at how emotional Elder Zhao was. If they were to ask anything wrong, something bad might happen again.</p><br/><p>Elder Mu tried to appease the situation, \"Alright, alright. It was just a misunderstanding. It was all because of these three rascals. Elder Zhao, it's not that I want to reprimand you. You're too hot-tempered. If not for Master Lin's call, you'd have blown things up. Master Lin didn't mind an empty hall. He was happy to have a disciple like you and wasn't bothered by things like this. He even gave you a present. Open it and let us have a look.\"</p><br/><p>Elder Zhao was finally calm but he shook his head. \"I don't want to let all of you see.\"</p><br/><p>Elder Mu smiled. \"Elder Zhao, you're so stingy. We just want to have a look. I bet you want to too.\"</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing didn't say much. He really wanted to see what it was but he was too furious.</p><br/><p>At the round table.</p><br/><p>Elder Sun was sitting there. Their friendship of a few decades wasn't just going to end because of those sentences. Zhao Ming Qing coughed gently and turned around to prevent him from looking. Elder Sun pulled Elder Zhao's arm. \"You're already so old. You practically have a leg in the grave already but you still act like a kid. Let's see what your mentor gave you.\"</p><br/><p>Initially, all of them had still been on Zhao Li Xing's side. However, they had to be on Elder Zhao's side after seeing what had happened. They didn't really care about what his mentor had given him as they felt that it wouldn't be something good anyway.</p><br/><p>Elder Zhao looked at Elder Sun and sat up straight. He carefully tore the packaging.</p><br/><p>When they saw that it was a book, they were upset. They were doubting how useful could that book be.</p><br/><p>\"It's a book?\" Elder Li asked.</p><br/><p>'Various Types of Typhoid '.</p><br/><p>Elder Sun asked, \"This is a Chinese medicine book. I wonder what the content is like.\"</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing said, \"My teacher's medical skills are law-defying. Obviously, he wouldn't give me an average book.\"</p><br/><p>\"Yeah, it definitely wouldn't be an average book,\" the crowd said.</p><br/><p>He flipped to the first page and there were two titles.</p><br/><p>'Typhoid Discussion'</p><br/><p>'Rough Outline'</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing quickly flipped to the second page. At the same time, the content of the first page was already in his mind.</p><br/><p>He was completely focused. He read the page word for word. His emotional state had changed. He looked extremely joyous.</p><br/><p>'Methods to measure one's pulse.'</p><br/><p>'Question: One's pulse has yin and yang sides. Why is that so?'</p><br/><p>'Answer: When one's pulse is fast, the increment, quantity, and movement are considered to be the yang. When one's pulse drops....'</p><br/><p>Initially, Sun Zong Yun and the rest of them hadn't cared about the content. However, they were gradually attracted to the content of the book. It was as if they had read something unbelievably amazing.</p><br/><p>The book had explained the human pulse clearly and logically. Although they didn't read much of it, they understood that this book was a masterpiece.</p><br/><p>*Bam*</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing closed the book. He knew that it had been written by his mentor. Although he had only read one page, he knew that his mentor's medical skills were extraordinary. He felt extremely lucky to have found a mentor like him.</p><br/><p>Sun Zong Yun was engrossed in it. They wanted to continue reading. When they saw him close the book, they said anxiously, \"Elder Zhao, you can't do that. Let's continue reading.\"</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing waved his hand. \"No, no. This is a gift from my mentor. If you want to have a look, you have to ask my mentor about it. Go back. I'm not angry about this matter anymore. It's okay that you guys were late. I have to go back and study this book carefully.\"</p><br/><p>Sun Zong Yun was also into Chinese medicine. Obviously, he didn't want to miss out. \"Elder Zhao, I believe you haven't invited me to your house in a long time. How about I come over tonight for a nice chat?\"</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing waved his hand. \"No thanks. Next time.\"</p><br/><p>Sun Zong Yun was extremely tempted. At the same time, he was a little upset. If he hadn't listened to those rascals, things wouldn't have ended up this way. Elder Zhao would definitely have shared the book with him.</p><br/><p>Some of those invited guests were into Western medicine and they weren't really interested in Chinese medicine. Despite that, they were interested in this book but they were helpless when Elder Zhao refused to share it with them.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

He was almost like superman now. Those mere mortals didn\u2019t stand a chance at all.</p><br/><p>Luckily, he was a just person.</p><br/><p>If he wasn\u2019t Justice Fan, the world would have been doomed.</p><br/><p>Absolutely doomed.</p><br/><p>He could resist even the force of a missile.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d Godfather Ma shuddered uncontrollably, looking at Lin Fan in shock. If he hadn\u2019t seen it for himself, he would have never believed what had just happened in front of him.</p><br/><p>\u201cListen up. I am Justice Fan, and I am your nemesis. You people have done evil things and even defrauded my brother. I won\u2019t beat you guys up, but did you really think that I was that easy to bully?\u201d Lin Fan said, chuckling.</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, have you guys seen a Deity before?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ma Qing Zhou and Liu Ren were both stunned.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Ma Qing Zhou stammered.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shook his head. \u201cNothing much, I\u2019m just saying that I am the Deity that you have been searching for.\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, Lin Fan clenched his fists in a gesture, and Ma Qing Zhou\u2019s pistol flew off from his hands into Lin Fan\u2019s.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou guys shouldn\u2019t be playing with guns like this. I\u2019ll let you guys see what a real Godly Gun loos like, and it really is magic,\u201d Lin Fan said, shooting off one bullet.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>The bullet burst out violently from the barrel of the pistol. Ma Qing Zhou and Liu Ren couldn\u2019t see the path of the bullet at all, but in the blink of an eye, Lin Fan\u2019s fingers were clasping onto the bullet with his left hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you see that? That is called playing with a gun,\u201d Lin Fan said, coldly laughing as if this was something that was ordinary.</p><br/><p>Plop!</p><br/><p>Liu Ren was the first to get on his knees.</p><br/><p>He realized that the person in front of him was no mere mortal.</p><br/><p>What exactly did Godfather Ma do?</p><br/><p>If it was a huge and prominent figure, it was still nothing considering his position and authority. But for the other party to cause Godfather Ma to react the way he did, it spoke levels of the person that was standing before them.</p><br/><p>At first, it was just Godfather Ma\u2019s hands trembling. Soon, it was his whole body.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026 what exactly do you plan to do?\u201d Godfather Ma had never seen this kind of situation before, and he was genuinely shaking with fear.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, his face smug with justice. \u201cI\u2019m going to send you guys to jail, to let you guys bear the consequences of your actions.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, send us in. We will go,\u201d Godfather Ma said, panicking. The prospect of prison right now was like a safe haven. All he wanted right now was to stay as far away as possible from this terrifying person.</p><br/><p>Ma Qing Zhou realized that it was too late to regret anything at this stage. He never thought that this brat would be that terrifying. If he had known earlier, he would never want to have anything to do with this person.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s easier to invite the devil than to send him away; he now knew the full meaning of what that statement meant.</p><br/><p>\u201cLook into my eyes,\u201d Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>Liu Ren and Ma Qing Zhou didn\u2019t dare to look. They were terrified of what they may see.</p><br/><p>\u201cLook into my eyes,\u201d Lin Fan repeated himself, his voice louder and more demanding than before.</p><br/><p>Both Liu Ren and Ma Qing Zhou lifted their heads slowly, looking at Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Lin Fan\u2019s eyes glowed with a brilliant light, as his lips opened, \u201cEnchantment.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ma Qing Zhou and Liu Ren\u2019s terrified faces suddenly changed. They became more dull and sluggish, almost like a wooden doll.</p><br/><p>\u201cRemember that you guys are good people. Whatever bad things that you guys did in the past have been tormenting you for a very long time. In a while, we will go to the police station and you will confess everything that you have done in the past,\u201d Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>Gradually, Ma Qing Zhou and Liu Ren\u2019s faces changed back to normal.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Outside.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat just happened inside? How come there were so many gunshots inside? Could it be that Godfather Ma is exhuming a body?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHard to say. Godfather Ma\u2019s tactics are extreme and effective, and he would definitely be pissed with this law-abiding brat.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh, could it be that the Godly Doctor is dead? How could we ever doubt Godfather Ma? Don\u2019t ever show any signs that you doubted him, otherwise it could be us next.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, yes. That\u2019s right.\u201d</p><br/><p>Creak!</p><br/><p>The door opened.</p><br/><p>The people who were listening from the outside were all shocked, and the people who were hiding far away didn\u2019t know what was going on.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan beamed with delight as he walked out of the door.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn, how did this brat walk out unscathed? Where is Godfather Ma?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you think that this brat killed Godfather Ma?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs this for real? Shit, this is huge.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGodfather Ma is walking out.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ma Qing Zhou and Liu Ren walked out of the door, lifeless and emotionless.</p><br/><p>The people who were standing around didn\u2019t know what was going on. All they knew was that a huge ruckus broke out inside, and now, it was as if nothing had happened.</p><br/><p>The crowd looked like they had just seen ghosts.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan swaggered out. \u201cCould you guys make way? I just had a little talk with Godfather Ma, and he has seen the light of what he has done. He is ready to turn himself in and is ready to turn over a new leaf.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><br/><p>The crowd was stunned. What on earth was this brat saying?</p><br/><p>He was going to bring Godfather Ma to turn himself in. What was going on?</p><br/><p>Everyone could only think of one possible explanation, and that was that this person was played by Godfather Ma.</p><br/><p>Godfather Ma was someone with influence. Everyone in Qing Zhou knew who he was, and for him to willingly surrender to the authorities? It was as if the world was about to end.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Godfather Ma said something that completely shocked everyone.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, what Master Lin said is right. I absolutely regret the things that I have done in the past and I am going to turn myself in to atone for my sins,\u201d Ma Qing Zhou said in a serious tone.\u201d</p><br/><p>A huge commotion broke out.</p><br/><p>The people in the crowd were all stunned, as they looked on wide-eyed, their faces in shock. They couldn\u2019t believe what Godfather Ma just said, unable to process what had just happened.</p><br/><p>Everyone had only one thought- what on earth happened inside?! What did Godfather Ma experience to cause him to want to turn himself in?</p><br/><p>They were really seeing ghosts.</p><br/><p>\u201cGodfather Ma, you must be out of your mind to give yourself in. It\u2019s as if the sky is going to fall in Qing Zhou.\u201d</p><br/><p>What this person said wasn\u2019t wrong. If Godfather Ma surrendered himself to the authorities, there would be a lot of people who would be implicated.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ma Qing Zhou looked at the crowd. \u201cEh, you guys are all entrepreneurs and I\u2019m sure that some of you have committed despicable acts as well. I just want to say that the law will catch up with you sooner or later, and there will definitely be consequences. Before I met Master Lin, I had been doing all sorts of despicable things. After I met Master Lin, I have received insight and have decided to turn myself in, to pay back Qing Zhou what I owe.\u201d</p><br/><p>F*ck!</p><br/><p>Did those words just come out from Godfather Ma\u2019s mouth?</p><br/><p>What on earth was happening?</p><br/><p>If Ma Qing Zhou\u2019s actions were brought to the light, even executing him ten times wouldn\u2019t be enough to atone for all the things that he had done in the past.</p><br/><p>Everyone who was associated with Godfather Ma would also go down into the flames with him.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at Ma Qing Zhou. \u201cGodfather Ma, let us make a move.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh, let\u2019s go,\u201d Ma Qing Zhou said, his voice full of confidence. \u201cMaster Lin, please don\u2019t call me Godfather Ma or Ma Qing Zhou. I have committed much evil under those names.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded. \u201cSince you committed so many crimes, you may have to face the death penalty for that. But the important thing is that you have repented and even if you die, your sins would definitely be atoned for.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, that is right. Even if I die by a firing squad, I will have no regrets even unto death,\u201d Ma Qing Zhou said.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan brought Godfather Ma with him.</p><br/><p>The people in the crowd were speechless.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, they erupted.</p><br/><p>\u201cI just saw a ghost\u2026\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

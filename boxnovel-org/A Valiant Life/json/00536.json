I wonder how much they managed to raise.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI bought seven paintings at once. Each day I use a new one as my wallpaper. It\u2019s just nice for a week.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe official website hasn\u2019t made any announcements. As of now, we still don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow exciting! Just how much is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>In the Detention House.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waited. He didn\u2019t have a clue either. He didn\u2019t know how much exactly, but it shouldn\u2019t be too little. The education at Nanshan\u2019s Children Welfare Institute should have been good enough.</p><br/><p>A phone call from Chief Zhang came.</p><br/><p>\u201cChief Zhang, what\u2019s the situation?\u201d Lin Fan asked calmly, however you could hear the eagerness in his voice.</p><br/><p>Chief Zhang excitedly said, \u201cMaster Lin, the One Dollar Art sale was a complete success. Within twenty-four hours, over five million people participated. In the end, you have raised a total of 18,535,005 dollars!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was astonished, \u201cThat\u2019s a lot!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, it is indeed beyond our imagination! It really is a huge success! This One Dollar Art sale is considered to be a very successful charity event.\u201d Even if he did not expect to raise so much, it would have at most been a few million since it was only one dollar for one painting. However, who knew that there would be near twenty million! It is indeed shocking!</p><br/><p>Lin Fan thanked him, \u201cThank you so much Chief Zhang. Please convey my appreciation to the workers.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Zhang replied, \u201cBeing able to help the children is what we should be doing. In the whole company, everyone is extremely proud.\u201d</p><br/><p>After talking for awhile more, they put down the phone. Raising this sum of money requires a period of buffer time. Moreover, what they do from now must also be done properly.</p><br/><p>The donations have to be used fairly, transparently and to make full use of every dollar.</p><br/><p>If any of the funds were misappropriated and if it were to be found out, they would then suffer the wrath of the people. It wouldn\u2019t even matter if it was Master Lin who misappropriated the funds.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>On the internet, the funds raised from the One Dollar Art sale was announced. The netizens were all stunned.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat the f*ck! They\u2019re just too good. They actually almost raised twenty million!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha! Impressive! My brother, The children down at Nanshan Children Welfare Institute would be able to undergo exceptional education.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTwenty million. Oh my god.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSimply a phenomenal charity event.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEarthshaking news!\u201d</p><br/><p>The netizens were shocked beyond their imagination. Some of the media were also stunned by this large sum of money. Within a day, and simply relying on a few hundred art pieces, they were able to raise near to twenty million dollars. It is simply just too shocking.</p><br/><p>After this news came out, many started to do their own analysis and reports.</p><br/><p>As for the problems that surfaced before, no one discussed it anymore. The host of the charity event was one of transparency. It was none other than the godly doctor Master Lin, who is also an outstanding and famous figure on WeiBo.</p><br/><p>Even though the didn\u2019t have as many followers on WeiBo as celebrities, however, their fighting strength is not one to be reckoned with. Especially during this period of time, where he established himself as a hacker. Any media team in the right mind would not want to mess with him.</p><br/><p>If they were to make Master Lin unhappy, all he had to do was hack into their system, which would lead to a tragic ending.</p><br/><p>Those official accounts who have been blocked remained blocked. This matter was no secret and was known throughout the industry. So no one can blame it on their luck.</p><br/><p>One month has gone by.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan would be released from prison.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan had a very happy one month in the Detention House. Even though he didn\u2019t have much freedom, but in the Detention House, he could go in and out as and when he wanted. He could chat with the criminals locked up inside. This made the criminals extremely jealous, and at the same time, when they left prison, they would have something to boast about.</p><br/><p>When I was in prison, I got to know this big shot. His life in prison was good and he had a lot of freedom.</p><br/><p>During this whole month, people from the Internet Safety Team spent every day with Lin Fan, learning computer skills from him. This made Lin Fan a bunch of Encyclopedic points. Even though it wasn\u2019t a lot, it was still great.</p><br/><p>Shen Jie Yun was extremely thankful. \u201cGuru, thank you so much. During this month, the skills of the workers have improved greatly. However, it is a pity that they weren\u2019t able to learn the skills of defense.\u201d</p><br/><p>The workers only had admiration for the perfect hacking methods that the Guru taught them. In their eyes, the Guru was a god in the Internet community. Whatever the security system was set up before him, hacking into it was easy like squeezing a soft persimmon.</p><br/><p>Sun Neng said, \u201cGuru, why wouldn\u2019t you teach us the skills of defense?\u201d</p><br/><p>This was a very serious question.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you want to learn about defense, you have the seize the chance to learn. If it isn\u2019t you who dies, then it\u2019ll be me who dies,\u201d he himself didn\u2019t know about defense, so how could he teach anyone?</p><br/><p>Sun Neng was momentarily silent, then he lowered his head. \u201cOnce a Guru, always a Guru. What you said made a lot of sense.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was getting late.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, through this one month, I\u2019m really grateful to you all for spending time with me. In the future, let\u2019s meet up if we have the chance,\u201d time flew by so fast. He was reluctant to leave this warm and comfortable Detention House. He left his furniture behind, unsure who would take over them.</p><br/><p>Shen Jie Yun waited for him. He looked Lin Fan in the eye, then stood in a straight line, and with a dignified expression, he thanked Lin Fan. \u201cMaster Lin, thank you so much for everything during this period of time. You have selflessly taught us your skills, and for that, we will forever remember you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed. He didn\u2019t feel much. Regarding these skills, one does not attain it during birth, and death does not take it away. Moreover, these are the people that would be protecting the Internet of our nation. If their skills were not good enough, what would they do if they get bullied in future?</p><br/><p>Although he himself would not join this department, he was willing to contribute to the cause.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be so modest. It if weren\u2019t for you all, I would have gone crazy within this month here.\u201d Lin Fan laughed. What he said was the truth. Chatting with them every day made the Detention House slightly more lively.</p><br/><p>And at this moment, Lin Fan smiled even more brightly than ever.</p><br/><p>He was previously asking why hasn\u2019t the Encyclopedia task been completed even though he had caused such a big matter. He finally realized that it was now that the task would be completed.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe twelfth page of the Encyclopedia has been completed. Adding twenty Encyclopedic points.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe thirteenth page of the Encyclopedia has begun. Since it\u2019s the thirteenth page of the Encyclopedia, therefore you can choose to host the relevant strengths of the people around you.\u201d</p><br/><p>It looks like he once again had to choose to host the relevant strengths of the people around him. He didn\u2019t know exactly what this Encyclopedia was thinking. What\u2019s the point of changing around here and there?</p><br/><p>\u201cWu You Lan has a lot of admiration for the host. Therefore, he decided to open a Sanitation and Cleanliness sub-class within the Environmental Protection Classification. (Encyclopedia\u2019s mystical boost)\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnnouncing mission: As before, become the Master Lin that everyone admires.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMission reward: +20 Encyclopedic points. Beginning the fourteenth page of Encyclopedia.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNote: Because you are opening a sub-class knowledge, there is no need to invest in the current industry.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEncyclopedia: 320 points.\u201d</p><br/><p>Not many people knew of such categorization.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was stunned. Everything was going well, why would there be a need for classification of sanitation. This knowledge doesn\u2019t seem to be very useful.</p><br/><p>How can he be the Master Lin that everyone admires? The difficulty level was rather high on this one.</p><br/><p>For the previous 12 skills, even if they were dishonest skills, at least there were some valiant abilities to show.</p><br/><p>Forget it, if there isn\u2019t much of a use, then there isn\u2019t much of a use. From what he can see, there was no hurry. He could take his time. Taking a rest for the time being did not seem to be too bad a choice.</p><br/><p>\u201cGuru, is something wrong?\u201d Sun Neng saw that the Guru was just standing there, and was momentarily worried about him.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan reacted. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing. Let\u2019s go. It\u2019s time to say goodbye to this place.\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

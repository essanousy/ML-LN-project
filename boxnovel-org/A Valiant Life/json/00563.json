Then, they cried out in a pleasant surprise, \u201cMaster Lin\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>In Shanghai, the reporters might not know all the local celebrities but in Master Lin\u2019s case, they were all very familiar with him.</p><br/><p>Especially in these few months, Master Lin had pretty much been trending nonstop on the news. Now, every news agency\u2019s reporters knew about Master Lin. If they really didn\u2019t know him, they wouldn\u2019t dare to call themselves reporters.</p><br/><p>At that moment, the reporters said from the side, \u201cBig Sister, hurry up and let Master Lin see the child. You are in great luck!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah! Master Lin is a godly doctor. If he personally treats him, then there won\u2019t be any problem.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen I saw this incident, I knew something was wrong. It definitely won\u2019t be so simple.\u201d</p><br/><p>The surrounding townsfolk had no idea what was going on but those townsfolk with sharp eyes started crying out in shock.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh my god, that\u2019s Master Lin!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Master Lin? Isn\u2019t that a famous person in Shanghai?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s needless to say. He\u2019s well-known in Cloud Street.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Mei was bewildered as he looked at him. The reporters then started laughing, \u201cBig Sister, why don\u2019t you hurry up and let Master Lin see your child? For you to have met Master Lin is a great fortune.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan held the child in his arms and took a close look. Then, he nodded, \u201cMmm, this is indeed eye cancer.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing was looking closely as well. \u201cTeacher, how is the situation?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNow, it\u2019s in the second stage. It\u2019s not the most severe stage yet so the issue isn\u2019t huge,\u201d said Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing nodded in relief, \u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d As long as Teacher said it wasn\u2019t a big issue, it wouldn\u2019t be much of a problem.</p><br/><p>In this condition, the child wasn\u2019t in urgent need of treatment. Lin Fan then looked at Xie Mei and said, \u201cGet up first.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Mei hadn\u2019t understood the situation yet and at that moment, she didn\u2019t know what to say.</p><br/><p>\u201cGet up. I will solve the child\u2019s problem. Tell the reporters what happened exactly,\u201d said Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>The reporters all started talking at the same time. \u201cBig Sister, if Master Lin says it\u2019s fine, then it\u2019s really fine. Hurry up and get up so you can tell us what really happened.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou might not know yet but Master Lin is a godly doctor. Countless patients have recovered under the treatment of Master Lin. Since Master Lin says that your child\u2019s condition is not a problem, then he will definitely be able to treat him back to health.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, Lin Fan started discussing with Zhao Ming Qing. \u201cTake a look first. By your judgment, how should we treat him?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing nodded. He knew that his teacher was guiding him. Then, he started to think and diagnose this illness.</p><br/><p>On the Internet.</p><br/><p>A report suddenly appeared on Weibo.</p><br/><p>This report\u2019s contents were well-rounded. It had videos and photographs and it was even very amusing. It quickly drew the attention of many netizens.</p><br/><p>\u2018Kneeling walk\u2019</p><br/><p>These two words made many people shocked.</p><br/><p>And now, reporters had received the news as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cLook, the news is out. Is this behind-the-scenes promoting?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI think so. This incident just happened but they have already compiled all this writing. It seems like the writing was done beforehand.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey left a phone number, right? We\u2019ll give a call to ask about the situation.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, the reporters on site started taking action. A call was made.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello, I am a reporter from Shanghai News Agency\u2026\u201d The reporter started his questioning. He wanted to see just what was up with this guy.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, the young man who was on site saw that things had changed. He wanted to quickly call back to inform them but his call couldn\u2019t get through.</p><br/><p>At that moment, he was a little dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>Over the phone, Zhu Quan said, \u201cHello, I\u2019ve just told the person known as \u2018Great Philanthropist\u2019 on Weibo about this matter. He said that this matter is just a joke. When I found out, I was furious. If possible, I can accept your interview.\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporters were laughing coldly in their hearts. \u201cThe interview will definitely happen but why would he say that it\u2019s a joke? Didn\u2019t they plan this beforehand? Could it be that he doesn\u2019t want to undertake the responsibility?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t answer that question. I\u2019m communicating with him right now,\u201d said Zhu Quan calmly. However, in her heart, she was overjoyed.</p><br/><p>The reporters continued talking to Zhu Quan.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, on Lin Fan\u2019s side, things had pretty much been taken care of. With Lin Fan\u2019s treatment methods, he could use Western Medicine\u2019s chemotherapy treatment or Chinese Medicine\u2019s medication treatment.</p><br/><p>These two methods would both work but he chose to use the Chinese medical treatment. After all, there was equipment required for chemotherapy.</p><br/><p>Moreover, the success rate of treating this kind of illness within the country wasn\u2019t high. Their research of such of illness was lacking very much compared to foreign countries.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan passed the child to Xie Mei. \u201cTomorrow, bring your child to Cloud Street. I will carry out the diagnosis. Don\u2019t worry, nothing bad will happen.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Mei had already come back to her senses. The reporters had praised this young man very much and they kept calling him \u2018Godly Doctor\u2019.</p><br/><p>It seemed that he was extraordinary.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs he really going to be fine?\u201d asked Xie Mei anxiously.</p><br/><p>\u201cYep.\u201d Lin Fan nodded. For such an illness, there was indeed hope of getting it treated successfully in a hospital but this Xie Mei didn\u2019t have money. Hence, she was helpless. Now that she had met Lin Fan, how could Lin Fan just leave it be?</p><br/><p>Just as Lin Fan was about to leave, he said to the reporters, \u201cMy dear reporters, you\u2019re all conscientious reporters in this industry. I think there will be people who will hype this up. I hope that you all will ferret them out. After all, this matter is difficult to forgive.\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporters were startled. This was the first time they had heard someone say that they were conscientious reporters.</p><br/><p>Moreover, the person who said that was Master Lin. The much-revered Master Lin.</p><br/><p>This, to them, was undoubtedly a glorious thing.</p><br/><p>At that moment, the reporters said simultaneously, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Master Lin. We will definitely take care of this matter. We, as reporters, cannot allow these people to exist. We have to expose them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled, then waved at everyone before leaving the place with Zhao Ming Qing.</p><br/><p>To Lin Fan, this was just a brief episode.</p><br/><p>In the car.</p><br/><p>\u201cMing Qing, what do you think about today\u2019s incident?\u201d asked Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing said seriously, \u201cIt\u2019s a little heartbreaking and I also feel very helpless. She had no money to treat the illness and could only wait for death to come.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded, \u201cNext time, pay more attention to such incidents. If you come across this kind of family, actively talk to them. If you have no way to help, then let me know. I don\u2019t have enough energy to help everyone.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing nodded, \u201cI understand, Teacher.\u201d</p><br/><p>However, it was exactly as Teacher had said. They didn\u2019t have enough energy and they couldn\u2019t possibly treat even more people.</p><br/><p>After sending Zhao Ming Qing home, Lin Fan prepared to give his all.</p><br/><p>He bought nine pressure cookers and placed them in the trunk of the car.</p><br/><p>Since he didn\u2019t manage to buy an alchemy furnace, he would play with them for real. Let\u2019s see who kills who.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s just an explosion. He had already changed his car to a Jeep. Why would he be scared?</p><br/><p>At a certain uninhabited place.</p><br/><p>A rumbling sound rang out.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck, this explosion\u2019s power is even greater than the last time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Following closely was another rumbling sound.</p><br/><p>After nine times.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan came out from the Jeep that had changed beyond recognition.</p><br/><p>He took a deep breath.</p><br/><p>He stomped his foot on the ground fiercely.</p><br/><p>\u201cGod bless me. Please give me the pill.\u201d</p><br/><p>When he came to the pit, using the light from the car, he found a pill lying quietly inside the pit.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan\u2019s eyes suddenly lit up.</p><br/><p>As for what was inside the remaining eight pits, it made him filled with eager anticipation.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p></div>\n</div>"}

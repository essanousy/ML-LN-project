Then, he went to investigate the matter right away. He could not let this matter go just like that. He had to investigate it thoroughly. He wanted to find out how many people wanted to use these perfect prosthetic limbs to make a fortune.</p><br/><p>He knew that such a matter was not going to be resolved so easily since there was a lot of money to be earned and people were greedy.</p><br/><p>However, he knew that if he could not resolve it, he had to minimize the negative impact. ( .c om )</p><br/><p>At Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan noticed that Brother Lin was a little off. She asked curiously, \u201cBrother Lin, what happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cNothing much. Something happened at the conference and the factory. However, it\u2019s no big deal. Luckily, we found out about it. If not, there might have been grave consequences.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan was stunned, \u201cReally? Isn\u2019t Director Wang collaborating with the government? Even so, something went wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said helplessly, \u201cThat\u2019s exactly why it happened. However, it\u2019s been resolved. You can look at the news tomorrow. I\u2019m going to the Welfare Institute. I haven\u2019t seen the kids in a long time and I kind of miss them.\u201d</p><br/><p>At Nanshan Children\u2019s Welfare Institute.</p><br/><p>A middle-aged lady was holding onto a little girl who was about two years old.</p><br/><p>They were standing on the pavement opposite the building and they kept looking at it.</p><br/><p>\u201cMum, why are we here?\u201d The little girl asked curiously.</p><br/><p>The middle-aged lady looked a little uncomfortable. She did not know what to say. She just patted the girl\u2019s head and said, \u201cNothing much.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although the little girl did not know what was happening, her gut feeling told her that she was going to be abandoned. Then, she hugged her mum\u2019s leg.</p><br/><p>\u201cMum, don\u2019t leave me. I will be obedient.\u201d</p><br/><p>The middle-aged woman kneeled down and hugged the girl. \u201cNo, it\u2019s just that I\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>She lowered her head and did not say anything after that.</p><br/><p>The little girl was embraced by her mum, and she felt a little calmer after hearing her mum\u2019s heartbeat. However, she was still afraid.</p><br/><p>The middle-aged lady was devastated. She had no choice. She had to support her husband, and if the girl were to stay with them, she would only suffer.</p><br/><p>She researched about a lot of places and finally decided on Nanshan Children\u2019s Welfare Institute.</p><br/><p>The people there treated the kids really well and they would not be bullied there. It was much better than staying with her and her husband.</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan arrived at the Welfare Institute, he wanted to go into the building, but he saw the couple opposite the building.</p><br/><p>Initially, he thought that the girl was being abducted, but he realised that he was probably overthinking after observing the situation.</p><br/><p>However, he had a bad feeling.</p><br/><p>He stood there for some time and decided to go over and find out what was going on.</p><br/><p>After all, he was quite a busybody. Since he noticed that something was wrong, he would definitely do something about it.</p><br/><p>\u201cHi, may I know what are you doing here?\u201d Lin Fan asked.</p><br/><p>The middle-aged lady looked at Lin Fan and anxiously replied, \u201cNothing much, nothing much.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. \u201cIf there\u2019s something you can\u2019t resolve, you can tell me about it. I am more than willing to help.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, the little girl hugged the lady\u2019s leg tightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cMum, don\u2019t send me away.\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly, the middle-aged lady burst into tears.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was confused by what he had just witnessed, and he still did not know what was going on. Then, he decided to read their fortunes and find out for himself.</p><br/><p>Then, he realised what was wrong.</p><br/><p>He only believed that people were destined to suffer in life if he actually witnessed it himself.</p><br/><p>She wanted to send her daughter to the Welfare Institute.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin\u2026\u201d Han Lu walked out of the security post and ran across the road.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cBring this little girl inside to play. I want to speak to this lady.\u201d ( .c om )</p><br/><p>Han Lu did not know why Master Lin said that but he nodded anyways. He wanted to bring little girl in, but she was frightened and just hugged her mum\u2019s leg tightly.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan helplessly asked, \u201cAre you thinking of sending her here?\u201d</p><br/><p>The little girl was only about two years old and she probably did not know what was happening. Hence, he just asked her about it directly.</p><br/><p>The middle-aged lady looked at Master Lin and nodded. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cActually, that is really cruel. The children inside are in there because they can\u2019t find their parents or they lost their parents. You and your husband are still present. If you were to send her here, she would lack her parents\u2019 love.</p><br/><p>\u201cPoverty and illness are not that scary. I can help you with that.\u201d</p><br/><p>The middle-aged lady shook her head. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said firmly, \u201cI do.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou really don\u2019t.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan added, \u201cI really understand. I am Master Lin. I can help you. Really. Come, follow me to the car.\u201d</p><br/><p>Since he encountered it, he wanted to do something about it.</p><br/><p>His biggest dream was not for the Welfare Institute to be filled with more children. He wanted it to become emptier. When that happened, all of the children in there would have their own homes.</p><br/><p>Han Lu added, \u201cMaster Lin asked you to enter the car. Just go for it. He will definitely help you.\u201d</p><br/><p>The middle-aged lady looked at him in confusion. \u201cWho is he?\u201d</p><br/><p>Han Lu was stunned. \u201cHe is Master Lin. Don\u2019t you read the news?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNope.\u201d The middle-aged lady shook her head. She did not have a lot of free time in her life, and watching the news was like a luxury to her.</p><br/><p>Han Lu did not know what to say. If she did not even know Master Lin, something must be really wrong. If she had a phone, she would definitely know who he was.</p><br/><p>However, since she did not watch the news, there was nothing he could do.</p><br/><p>However, he believed that Master Lin could resolve the problem.</p><br/><p>Soon, Lin Fan started the car and drove off with them.</p><br/><p>He followed the lady\u2019s instructions and drove to the destination. Although it was some distance away, he did not really care about it since he just wanted to help them.</p><br/><p>They drove off.</p><br/><p>Soon, it was nighttime.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan and the others were in the shop, but they did not wait for Master Lin to return. They just called him and found out that he was in some place far away.</p><br/><p>Where was he heading to?</p><br/><p>At midnight.</p><br/><p>The speed of the car was low and the roads were narrow and winding.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that your village?\u201d Lin Fan asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled, \u201cAlright, we will be there soon. Please wait a little longer. Sometimes, you don\u2019t have to complicate things too much. It can be easy to resolve.\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

Did you\u2026?\u201d Fraud Tian asked curiously but his expression seemed a little cunning.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was speechless, \u201cF*ck, Fraud, I don\u2019t even know what you\u2019re thinking about. Why do you always think about these things? It\u2019s too dangerous. It\u2019s really too dangerous.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, Fraud Tian looked at Elder Dog, \u201cHey, something is wrong. Why do I feel like Elder Dog looks different today?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was stunned. Was it because he saw Elder Dog every day and he couldn\u2019t notice the difference? He quickly asked, \u201cWhat difference?\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian shook his head, \u201cHe looks fatter. He would probably still eat a sumptuous steamboat in the winter.\u201d</p><br/><p>*bark*</p><br/><p>Elder Dog reacted and barked at Fraud Tian. Then, he raised his paws as if he was threatening him.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, dogs are getting smarter. They can even understand what we\u2019re saying,\u201d Fraud Tian gasped after seeing Elder Dog\u2019s response.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan didn\u2019t expect Elder Dog to have really become smarter.</p><br/><p>It seemed like a good beginning.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang said, \u201cBrother Lin, I think Huang Hao is set on messing with you. He hasn\u2019t stopped on Weibo since last night.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although Lin Fan didn\u2019t want to bother about Huang Hao, he didn\u2019t expect this fella to be so overboard.</p><br/><p>His dad didn\u2019t even do anything and his son came out to infuriate him. He must be crazy.</p><br/><p>When he read the Weibo posts, Lin Fan furrowed his brows.</p><br/><p>He said all sorts of nonsense. Since when did he do so many bad things in his past?</p><br/><p>Although what he said was mostly true, everyone knew about it already.</p><br/><p>However, the netizens were not dumb. They had been flaming this fella but Huang Hao took the initiative.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan just wanted to ignore an id*ot like him.</p><br/><p>However, he didn\u2019t want to let this fella do whatever he wanted happily. That wasn\u2019t his style after all.</p><br/><p>He did some hand gestures to read some fortune and he thought of something that he could do.</p><br/><p>He opened Weibo.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cYoung Master Huang, I have managed to foresee that your role in your dad\u2019s company might be at stake. Since you have the time to flame me, why not take the time and think about your own situation? Your dad has so many mistresses and he has more than one son. Some of them are already taking up important roles in your dad\u2019s company. Meanwhile, you\u2019re still wasting your time on the Internet. @Huang Hao\u201d</p><br/><p>After reading it again, he realized that there weren\u2019t any problems with it and he posted it.</p><br/><p>When the netizens saw the post, they laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cI think I found out something incredible.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, that\u2019s hilarious. Master Lin is incredible. He actually managed to foresee that. I trust Master Lin with all my life.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHis dad has so many mistresses and he has more than one son. What does that imply?\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, the netizens immediately mentioned Huang Hao and commented on his Weibo.</p><br/><p>When Huang Hao saw the Weibo message, he was anxious. However, he didn\u2019t believe it. He immediately flamed him.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat rubbish? Don\u2019t malign my dad. My dad only has one son. What are you talking about?\u201d Huang Hao immediately replied.</p><br/><p>As Huang Hao thought about it, he felt more unsettled. It was as if what Lin Fan said was spot on. Then, he made a call.</p><br/><p>\u201cMum, does dad have someone else?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean? Who did you hear this from?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, it was said by Master Lin. He said Dad has several mistresses and has more than one son. Some of them had been given important roles in the company already.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow could it be? You\u2026 Wait a moment.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, Huang Hao was in doubt. He felt like something was wrong.</p><br/><p>Then, someone screamed on the phone.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis fella, I said that I saw a few people that looked like your dad when I went to the company. So, that\u2019s why. What does he want?\u201d</p><br/><p>Huang Hao\u2019s mum was agitated. In the past, she had doubted Huang Guo Hui\u2019s faith before. However, she couldn\u2019t get any evidence. Now that she has some evidence, she had to accept it. After all, he was rich and influential. Why wouldn\u2019t he turn bad? What mattered was that he didn\u2019t bring them home.</p><br/><p>It was just that she saw a few department managers that looked like Huang Guo Hui but she didn\u2019t think too much about it. After all, there were so many people in this world and it was normal to have people that looked like him.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, she thought that Huang Guo Hui didn\u2019t dare to bring the mistresses and children to the company.</p><br/><p>However, she felt that the situation seemed a little wrong after hearing what her son said. She kept thinking about the department managers and felt that they really looked like him. One of them was really young and managed to become a department manager. It seemed a little impossible.</p><br/><p>There was only one possibility. It was that these people were Huang Guo Hui\u2019s sons.</p><br/><p>Now that he had brought them to the company, weren\u2019t her assets going to be split up?</p><br/><p>\u201cMum, what is it? Could it be true?\u201d Huang Hao was anxious. He didn\u2019t really believe it but his mum\u2019s tone made him feel that it was true.</p><br/><p>It was as if something really happened.</p><br/><p>\u201cSon, don\u2019t ask your dad about this first. I\u2019ll go to the company to have a look.\u201d</p><br/><p>After hanging up, Huang Hao was furious but he gradually calmed himself down.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow could it be? It must be false. The fella really stalked me. I can\u2019t forgive him.\u201d Huang Hao thought to himself and went on Weibo to flame Lin Fan again.</p><br/><p>However, he couldn\u2019t flame him properly again. After all, he was really stunned.</p><br/><p>Especially since the comments made him really anxious.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, that\u2019s hilarious.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease believe him. Master Lin\u2019s fortune-telling ability is really accurate. If he says that you have brothers, you definitely have brothers. However, they\u2019re of different mothers. Your family\u2019s assets are going to be divided.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow could you still insult Master Lin? You must be asking for it. Now that Master Lin is pitying you and telling you the truth, you should be thankful for his kindness.\u201d</p><br/><p>After seeing those comments, Huang Hao was furious but he couldn\u2019t say anything to rebut those comments.</p><br/><p>He was just really anxious and agitated.</p><br/><p>His own dad looked for him to read his fortune but he didn\u2019t even do it. After all, those fortune tellers that his dad looked for were surely not scammers. That meant that everything might really be true.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>At Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan exposed this secret and it was something like a time bomb to Huang Hao.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs Master Lin here?\u201d Then, a young uniformed worker from the Trade and Commerce Company came.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan placed his phone down. \u201cI am Master Lin, what is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>At the same time, he was curious as to why a worker from the Trade and Commerce Company came to look for him. Could it be that something bad had happened?</p><br/><p>However, that might really have been true. Huang Guo Hui definitely wanted to avenge him. He just didn\u2019t know what he was going to do to him.</p><br/><p>However, he could roughly tell what he was going to do to him now since this young worker came.</p></div>\n</div>"}

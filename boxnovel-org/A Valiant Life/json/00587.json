It was gold in color. It was the well-concocted perfect-grade Little intelligence pill. He smiled broadly.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing stood by his side, looking, \u201cTeacher, is this the said perfect-grade little intelligence pill?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded his head, \u201cYou\u2019re right! This is it! Take a look at it, see if it\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing was shocked, \u201cA golden, glossy outward appearance. This is the first time I\u2019m looking at such a pill!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s for you.\u201d Lin Fan handed the pill over to Zhao Ming Qing straightaway.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing was so stunned that he didn\u2019t even know where to place his hands. \u201cTeacher, I\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He was feeling extremely touched at this moment. He was completely lost for words. The perfect-grade little intelligence pill, whom Teacher Lin had painstakingly concocted, was unexpectedly given to him!</p><br/><p>How could this not make him feel touched?</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cTake it. From what I know, when people grow older, their brains degenerate. It\u2019s no longer as active as before. What\u2019s more is that you are learning Chinese medicine, which requires you to be flexible and to make many deductions. As your teacher, how can I allow your brain to lose its activeness?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing was left speechless. What Teacher said was true. When a person ages, his brain becomes less adequate. At times, what they could remember before might momentarily be forgotten.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can rest easy, There\u2019s absolutely nothing wrong with his pill.\u201d Lin Fan assured.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing shook his head, \u201cTeacher, it\u2019s not that I\u2019m doubting your pill. It\u2019s just that I don\u2019t know what to say! Thank you so much for your favor!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled broadly. He didn\u2019t even think much about this perfect-grade little intelligence pill. As long as he could concoct it, then it wasn\u2019t that big of a deal.</p><br/><p>But now, the most crucial moment had come.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe fourteenth page of knowledge has been completed. 30 Encyclopedic points will be awarded.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe departmental store of the Encyclopedia has opened.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe departmental store has a total of four levels. The first level has been opened.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe fifteenth page of knowledge will temporarily remain locked.</p><br/><p>\u201cMission announcement: Buy perfect-grade little intelligence pills from the Encyclopedia departmental store for the children at Nanshan Children\u2019s Welfare Institute to consume.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMission reward: Encyclopedic points +100, unlocking of the fifteenth page of knowledge, as well as drawing of a classification of knowledge.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEncyclopedic points: 405.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was a bit skeptical. His mind was communicating with the Encyclopedia.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat isn\u2019t correct\u2026 The previous reward was to unlock the fifteenth page of knowledge. Why is it that it still hasn\u2019t been unlocked even after completing it?\u201d Lin Fan asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is a last minute mission, so as to not give rise to disagreements. At the same time, it is to otherwise reward you with a new classification of knowledge.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan had no other choice but to let it go. He currently had fourteen pages of knowledge and that was unbelievable. However, he felt that the Encyclopedia had a rather humane side to it. It knew that he recently did not pay enough attention to the Nanshan Children\u2019s Welfare Institute and therefore had given him this last minute mission.</p><br/><p>Not bad.</p><br/><p>He had no other opinions.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, what happened to you?\u201d Zhao Ming Qing realized that his mind was slowly clearing up after taking the pill. However, what made him most surprised was when he realized that Teacher\u2019s expression was rather serious and wondered what had happened.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan came back to his senses, \u201cNothing. I was just thinking about some stuff. Since we have already concocted the perfect-grade little intelligence pill, let us go home for some rest!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d Zhao Ming Qing nodded his head. Today was a tiring but fruitful day.</p><br/><p>They left the Alchemy Furnace in the warehouse. Even if someone tried to move it away, they wouldn\u2019t be able to. Moreover, like what Lin Fan said, there isn\u2019t much of a use for it anymore.</p><br/><p>Back at home.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laid on his sofa, looking through the Encyclopedia\u2019s departmental store. This was a new discovery, so he didn\u2019t know what to expect.</p><br/><p>Perfect-grade little intelligence pill: 20 Encyclopedic points.</p><br/><p>Ba Gua Zhang skill pill: 10 Encyclopedic points.</p><br/><p>Small-sized lucky halo: 100 Encyclopedic points.</p><br/><p>Eagle vision: 200 Encyclopedic points.</p><br/><p>Breathing underwater skill: 200 Encyclopedic points.</p><br/><p>Primary strength amplification pill: 1000 Encyclopedic points.</p><br/><p>Primary agility amplification pill: 1000 Encylopaedic points.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Lin Fan\u2019s eyes were dazzling. The first page of the departmental store had simply too many items. Some of the items made Lin Fan dumbstruck. His heart was bursting with excitement.</p><br/><p>These were items that the Encyclopedia\u2019s classification could not bring about.</p><br/><p>As for the items in the first page of the departmental store, everything was beyond the understanding of our current capabilities.</p><br/><p>Behind every item, there was the pricing. This attracted Lin Fan the most. He only had one thought in his mind and it was that he wanted everything so d*mn badly.</p><br/><p>However, some of the items were very expensive.</p><br/><p>He had to suppress his excitement. He thought about the task that was just announced.</p><br/><p>It could be said that he would require a period of time to finish the task. It may not be very difficult, but in order to complete the task, he would require at least 6700 Encyclopedic points.</p><br/><p>This was a very diverse task. Making a profit of Encyclopedic points was still a necessity.</p><br/><p>However, what would the future be like if he allows the children to consume the little intelligence pill?</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t dare to think about it, neither did he want to.</p><br/><p>All the talent was at the Nanshan Children\u2019s Welfare Institute. The thought of it was terrifying and shocking.</p><br/><p>However, whatever they say, the talent would have to go through Lin Fan\u2019s education.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>In the villa.</p><br/><p>\u201cOld man, why are you back so late?\u201d Zhao Shi was busy in the kitchen.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing laughed, \u201cNothing much. I was concocting a pill with Teacher. It was very rewarding.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Shi shook her head while laughing. Ever since this old man took Teacher Lin as his teacher, he has had a change in personality. It was as if he was becoming younger and younger. The house also became livelier.</p><br/><p>Zhao Shi was packing up in the kitchen, but suddenly, she asked, \u201cOld man, I don\u2019t know where the knives in the house went to. I\u2019m going out to buy one. Can you just wait for awhile, dinner would be ready soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing didn\u2019t think much about it and answered, \u201cAren\u2019t the knives above the refrigerator? You put it up there a year ago, saying that you were afraid that our grandson would touch it. Don\u2019t you remember?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Shi went to look above the refrigerator and was stunned for a moment, \u201cHey, old man! How did you know? I remember that you hardly concern yourself with such matters.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWife, it was what you told me previously. You\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Zhao Ming Qing also stunned. He wasn\u2019t happy because he remembered where the knives were put, but rather, he realized that something wasn\u2019t quite correct.</p><br/><p>How did he know where the knives were kept?</p><br/><p>But he clearly remembered that his wife had told him about this before. All he had to do was to look through his memories and he would remember it.</p><br/><p>However, he was already so old. How could he still remember such things? Even if he was a youngster, he probably wouldn\u2019t be able to remember it.</p><br/><p>Frightening!</p><br/><p>Could it be because of the perfect-grade little intelligence pill that Teacher handed to him?</p><br/><p>Thinking about it, Zhao Ming Qing suddenly realized that that was probably the case.</p><br/><p>\u201cOld man, what happened to you?\u201d his wife asked urgently. The old man was a little weird today. Did something happen to him?</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing waved his hands, \u201cNothing, nothing. I just simply remembered it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Shi also didn\u2019t think much about it and continued her work in the kitchen.</p><br/><p>However, to Zhao Ming Qing, something life-changing had just occurred.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, what kind of pill did you concoct? How could you possibly give such an important pill to me for consumption? This\u2026\u201d Zhao Ming Qing was so touched that he was on the verge of crying.</p></div>\n</div>"}

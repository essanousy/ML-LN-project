Her wavy long hair hung at both sides of her cheeks as she appeared quite mature.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-1\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cWhere do you guys stay?\u201d asked Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue replied, \u201cWe stay at the hotel booked by the production team.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded. \u201cAlright then. I\u2019ll stay there too and I\u2019ll go back early tomorrow.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue\u2019s manager had seen Master Lin and had an idea of what was going on so she hadn\u2019t stayed with them. She had gone back earlier. She had an idea of what was going to happen that night.</p><br/><p>Although Wu Huan Yue had always said that she had never reached that stage with Master Lin, as an outsider, the manager wouldn\u2019t believe her.</p><br/><p>Chen Bao Guo had long gotten used to how this profession worked. He had an idea of what was going on between Wu Huan Yue and Master Lin but he would definitely not say it explicitly. Also, he could see that Master Lin\u2019s talent and character was much more reliable than those investors.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-2\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>With such a supporter, Wu Huan Yue would be able to have a smooth sail through the industry in future. She wouldn\u2019t have to do things that she didn\u2019t want to do.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher Chen, where are you returning to?\u201d at the entrance of the hotel, Lin Fan saw Chen Bao Guo starting his car, so he asked.</p><br/><p>Chen Bao Guo replied kindly, \u201cBack to the hotel.\u201d</p><br/><p>This veteran artiste didn\u2019t have a manager, nor did he have anyone following him. He went from place to place all by himself.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go back together then,\u201d said Lin Fan with a smile.</p><br/><p>Chen Bao Guo was taken aback as he hadn\u2019t expected Master Lin to say that. But then he smiled. It seemed that Master Lin was worried that Wu Huan Yue, with her current status, might get photos taken of her by paparazzi. But if Chen Bao Guo was together with the two of them, it wouldn\u2019t be an issue.</p><br/><p><em>Alright then. I have a good feeling about these two. I don\u2019t mind being a support for once.</em></p><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue lowered her head and asked softly, \u201cBrother Lin, can we slowly walk back?\u201d Her voice was very soft and if he didn\u2019t listen carefully, he wouldn\u2019t have heard what she was saying. But her grip on Lin Fan\u2019s arm tightened slightly as if she was asking him to agree.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-3\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Lin Fan looked down at her, then agreed in the end. Then, he said to Chen Bao Guo apologetically, \u201cSorry, Teacher Chen. I think we will walk back after all. If we have the chance, let\u2019s meet again in future.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Bao Guo smiled. \u201cNo worries. Young people should be more romantic.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved his hand, then started walking off with Wu Huan Yue by his side.</p><br/><p>They weren\u2019t far from their hotel and it was only a half an hour walk.</p><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue wore a hat as she attached herself to Lin Fan\u2019s arm like a little bird. She held tightly onto Lin Fan as they walked slowly along the pavement.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t too late yet and there were some pedestrians on the way.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it? You seem to have something on your mind,\u201d asked Lin Fan curiously.</p><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue smiled brightly. \u201cNo, I just feel very safe and very fortunate.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled back. \u201cAren\u2019t you just saying the obvious? With me around, of course you\u2019re safe. If a bad person comes, I\u2019ll send him flying with a kick.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue covered her mouth as she laughed. \u201cI know that Brother Lin is the most powerful. I feel very fortunate to have been able to meet someone like Brother Lin right after graduating. If I didn\u2019t meet you, I really don\u2019t know how my life would be like.\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-4\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Hearing that, Lin Fan sighed in his heart as well. The world had its ways. He didn\u2019t know either. If he hadn\u2019t gotten the Encyclopedia, what would his life be like?</p><br/><p>This wasn\u2019t a dream. It was all real.</p><br/><p>Could it be that he had saved the whole world in his past life, so the heavens gave him this priceless gift?</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Lin, what\u2019s up with you?\u201d Wu Huan Yue asked suspiciously as she noticed that Brother Lin seemed to be thinking of something.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cIt\u2019s nothing. I\u2019m just thinking about something. You shouldn\u2019t think too much either. This is all fate. With one look, I can see through everything clearly.\u201d</p><br/><p>*Pfft!* Wu Huan Yue burst into laughter. \u201cBrother Lin, can\u2019t you do a reading and see who my other half will be and where he is?\u201d</p><br/><p>When she asked this, Wu Huan Yue\u2019s heart rate started increasing. It was as if she was waiting eagerly but at the same time, she was a little afraid. She was afraid that she would hear something apart from what she imagined.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was silent for a while before replying with a smile, \u201cI just did a reading and I saw that the answer to your question is up to the heavens. The path ahead is unclear and I can\u2019t see through it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re giving me a vague answer again.\u201d Wu Huan Yue pouted. Although she hadn\u2019t gotten her answer, she felt great.</p><br/><p>Women are sensitive and they\u2019re able to sense mystical things.</p><br/><p>The two of them walked silently along the pavement. Even if the whole place was bustling with noise, to Wu Huan Yue, the two of them would just be in their own world.</p><br/><p>Nothing could draw her attention.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-5\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Minutes and seconds passed by and soon, they had reached the hotel lounge.</p><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue felt that time had passed too quickly. They hadn\u2019t even spent long enough alone.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll go and book a room,\u201d said Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>This was the lounge and it was likely that there would be reporters. However, Wu Huan Yue was tugging on Lin Fan\u2019s wrist with a shy expression on her face as she said softly, \u201cActually, you don\u2019t have to. If you want to stay at my place\u2026that\u2019s fine too.\u201d</p><br/><p>As she reached the end of her sentence, Wu Huan Yue\u2019s face was as red as a lobster. For a girl to say such things, it would really make one blush.</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t care about whether other people would see this because she felt fearless. She just wanted to do her best to be together with the person she liked.</p><br/><p>But she knew about Wu You Lan\u2019s existence and she also understood that Brother Lin was an outstanding individual. She wasn\u2019t the only one who liked him.</p><br/><p>However, if she didn\u2019t try her best and she just waited for luck to arrive, that would be the silliest choice.</p><br/><p>Luck has to be seized by oneself. If she was shy just because she was a girl and didn\u2019t do anything, she might regret it for the rest of her life.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was slightly surprised. She understood Wu Huan Yue\u2019s feelings, but\u2026</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-6\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Patting Wu Huan Yue\u2019s head, he smiled gently. \u201cAlright, don\u2019t think too much. Before I\u2019m sure about anything, I won\u2019t cause harm to anyone. You\u2019re the one I want to harm the least. Do you understand what I mean?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue looked up at Brother Lin. Finally, she nodded. \u201cI understand.\u201d Then, she released her grip as she watched Lin Fan walk to the counter.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cI would like a room.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>In the elevator, Lin Fan looked at his room card. He was staying on the seventh floor while Wu Huan Yue was on the second. Then, they reached the second floor and he walked Wu Huan Yue to her door. \u201cRest well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue nodded. \u201cMmm, I got it, Brother Lin. You should rest early too. When you leave in the morning, you have to send me a message.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. \u201cAlright, I\u2019ll send you a message.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue reluctantly closed the door. Lin Fan turned around and left as he smiled to himself. Then, Wu Huan Yue opened the door again. \u201cBrother Lin\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan turned around, smiling. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue seemed like she didn\u2019t know what to say. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing. Just rest well.\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-7\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cMmm, you too. Remember to lock the door. If there\u2019s anything, give me a call,\u201d said Lin Fan with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d Wu Huan Yue nodded.</p><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue had a slight disappointment in her heart but she had etched what Brother Lin had said into her memory.</p><br/><p>Before he was sure about anything, he wouldn\u2019t cause harm to anyone.</p></div>\n</div>"}

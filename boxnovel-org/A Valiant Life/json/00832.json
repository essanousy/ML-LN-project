He had just reached this place and he definitely had to take a good look around. There wasn\u2019t a need to immediately start looking for Godfather Liu for trouble. He had to take it slow. Only so, would he be in the mood for it?</p><br/><p>At that moment, his phone rang.</p><br/><p>He saw that it was an unknown number. Lin Fan thought that Godfather Liu had changed his number to call him but when he answered the call, he realized that that was not the case.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello, Master Lin, I\u2019m Kuang Zhong Fei. I\u2019m a business partner of Chief Chen\u2019s. He informed me that you have come to the Northeast and told me to welcome you. May I know where you are now? I\u2019ll go and fetch you,\u201d asked Kuang Zhong Fei. He had cooperated with Chen Chang Sheng for almost ten years and they had a solid relationship. Now that something had happened in the Northeast, Godfather Liu had approached him before as well but Kuang Zhong Fei momentarily put him off.</p><br/><p>However, he knew that he couldn\u2019t delay it much longer. He had lived here for so long and he understood how dangerous Godfather Liu was.</p><br/><p>Although his life wouldn\u2019t be in much danger, he would be faced with many calamities.</p><br/><p>For example, his house door might have dung splashed on it, his window might get smashed in the middle of the night or he might suddenly get beaten by someone on the streets for no reason.</p><br/><p>Or, he might receive threats.</p><br/><p>Who would be able to endure something like that?</p><br/><p>Moreover, he had a family. He wasn\u2019t worried about himself. He was afraid that his family members might run into trouble.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan had not expected that Chen Chang Sheng would get someone to take care of him. Could it be that Chen Chang Sheng was really afraid that something would happen to him?</p><br/><p>But it was good to have someone he knew. At least he would be able to find out more.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello, Chief Kuang. I\u2019m at XX Street. You can come over,\u201d replied Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Soon, a car stopped in front of Lin Fan. a middle-aged man came out of the driver\u2019s seat. Judging by his face, he wasn\u2019t in a very good state. When he saw Lin Fan, he smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201cNice to meet you, Master Lin, nice to meet you.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was the first time they were meeting. Lin Fan was very polite as well.</p><br/><p>Kuang Zhong Fei had heard many rumors about Master Lin as well and he was a little curious.</p><br/><p>But Chen Chang Sheng had said that Master Lin was here to resolve the situation. He didn\u2019t believe this.</p><br/><p>It was mainly because Godfather Liu was too powerful. He wouldn\u2019t be taken down so easily.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan got straight to the point, \u201cChief Kuang, tell me, what\u2019s the situation now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kuang Zhong Fei sighed helplessly, \u201cThe situation now isn\u2019t good. That Godfather Liu has established his logistics company and he\u2019s starting to swallow up the large departments of the market. Moreover, his methods are exceptionally corrupted.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOur logistics vehicles often get their petrol stolen or their tires stolen. This kind of thing can\u2019t be stopped and it frequently happens. It has affected us greatly and it has affected the transport time, causing many clients to have bad opinions of us. Although the perpetrators have not been caught, I know that it was Godfather Liu who ordered people to do it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI think that if this carries on, Chief Chen\u2019s business will have to leave the Northeast as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan heard this, he felt a little surprised. He hadn\u2019t expected that it was so cruel. \u201cWhere is that Godfather Liu\u2019s logistics company? Bring me there to take a look.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kuang Zhong Fei didn\u2019t know what Master Lin wanted to do but he didn\u2019t say anything. He just drove the car towards their destination.</p><br/><p>When they reached their destination, Lin Fan looked through the windows.</p><br/><p>\u201cWoof woof~\u201d Elder Dog barked a few times after sniffing.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Lin Fan looked at Elder Dog.</p><br/><p>Kuang Zhong Fei was taken aback. He hadn\u2019t expected Master Lin to talk to a dog. This was a little unimaginable. However, he didn\u2019t care about it too much. Everyone has their own habits.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan communication through their thoughts.</p><br/><p>\u201cI smelled something smelly over there.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSomething smelly?\u201d Lin Fan didn\u2019t quite understand what Elder Dog meant by that.</p><br/><p>Could it be that there was a manure pit inside?</p><br/><p>However, those words had already drawn Lin Fan\u2019s attention. It seemed that he had to investigate.</p><br/><p>He took note of it and didn\u2019t stay any longer.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d said Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Kuang Zhong Fei didn\u2019t understand what exactly this Master Lin wanted to do but he started his car and drove off.</p><br/><p>Nighttime.</p><br/><p>Godfather Liu still had people looking for Lin Fan. But after searching for a long time, there was no sign of him.</p><br/><p>Although Godfather Liu had many people under him, searching for a single man in a city was very difficult. But even so, he would not give up.</p><br/><p>But what he didn\u2019t know was that this Master Lin that he was thinking about had already slowly invaded his company.</p><br/><p>Following Elder Dog\u2019s lead, Lin Fan stood in front of a big door.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is inside here?\u201d Lin Fan muttered in his heart. Then, without hesitation, he opened the door.</p><br/><p>A rush of cold air blew at him. Of course, a bit of cold air was nothing much.</p><br/><p>What drew his attention was those already packaged and casually dumped meat products.</p><br/><p>Although it was icy cold, Lin Fan could smell a piercing stench.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Dog, go and see what it is,\u201d instructed Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Elder Dog was now like a general who would charge in and break the enemies\u2019 front lines.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, voices came from outside.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan immediately picked Elder Dog up and hid in the shadows.</p><br/><p>Creak!</p><br/><p>The door was pushed open.</p><br/><p>Two security guards were talking to each other.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you think people will still eat these things?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPeople will definitely eat them. When these things are delivered, they\u2019ll be processed a little and become delicious foods, understand?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard that these meat products have been kept for tens of years. Where do you think this meat is from?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you but don\u2019t tell anyone. These meat are all from overseas. They were secretly transported over using special channels. Alright, I shan\u2019t say more. There\u2019s nothing much here. Let\u2019s hurry and go somewhere else. It\u2019s too cold here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>After the two men left, Lin Fan and Elder Dog came out of the shadow.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck, that\u2019s vicious. If I hadn\u2019t heard you two say that, I would have had no idea,\u201d Lin Fan had heard it clearly. These were all old antiques.</p><br/><p>However, most old antiques had to be handed over to the authorities in the country.</p><br/><p>But these things probably wouldn\u2019t reach the authorities. They were going to be distributed to countless citizens.</p><br/><p>When he thought about these things being distributed to the various second and third-rate cities in the nation, his heart ached.</p><br/><p>His many righteous fans who lived in those places would all be harmed.</p><br/><p>He had to expose this.</p><br/><p>He had initially wanted to play around with Godfather Liu but now, he had other plans.</p><br/><p>He collected evidence and sneakily left the place.</p><br/><p>The next day!</p><br/><p>Lin Fan picked up his phone and made a call.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello, is this Northern Morning News? I\u2019m Shanghai\u2019s Master Lin. I\u2019m currently in the Northeast and I want to report an incident\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, he dialed another number.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs this Northeast Daily News? I\u2019m\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Subsequently, Lin Fan contacted basically every news agency in the Northeast.</p><br/><p>Of course, these news agencies knew about Master Lin.</p><br/><p>When they saw on Weibo that Master Lin had come to the Northeast, they all wanted to find him but sadly, when they camped at the airport, they didn\u2019t see a single sign of him. But now, Master Lin had actively contacted them.</p><br/><p>This made them very excited. They wondered what big thing was going to happen now.</p><br/><p>However, contacting these news agencies wasn\u2019t enough. He had to contact the relevant departments.</p><br/><p>For example.</p><br/><p>The police.</p><br/><p>The Food Safety Department.</p><br/><p>Etc.</p><br/><p>Facing such a situation, how could he not make things blow up? It wasn\u2019t his style to just cause a small ruckus.</p></div>\n</div>"}

I have never met anyone in my life better than me until I met you.\"</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing kept on praising Lin Fan. Although he was old, he still had a teachable mind which never forgot its roots. He was eager to learn the true art of Traditional Chinese Medicine, and especially now since he was researching the things from the ancient times to gleam new knowledge. However, his research proved to be too hard to find anything. After meeting this Master whose skill and knowledge surpassed anything he had ever seen, even being able to cure his ailment, he had found a new found passion for the art of Traditional Chinese Medicine.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan stood there carefree and happy, calmly nodding his head. \"Old gentleman, what you said is almost correct. I, Master Lin am the second best in Traditional Chinese Medicine in the world, and no one dares to take the first place. Do you agree with me?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes, I agree.\" Zhao Ming Qing immediately nodded his head. He couldn't disagree afte seeing what had happened in front of his very eyes.</p><br/><p>The other old man stood at one corner looking curious. \"Master, what can you tell when you see my body?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the other old man. \"I won't see you because I am not familiar with you.\"</p><br/><p>The other old man looked deflated as he shrunk into a corner, smiling awkwardly. However, he continued to have hope, thinking that if he praised the Master a little, he might be able to get closer to him.</p><br/><p>\"Master, after meeting for the first time, we should be a little more familiar with each other. Furthermore, I and Old Man Zhao are brothers, and we went through thick and thin together. When Old Man Jiang becomes your disciple, I'll be around quite a lot as well,\" the other old man said, laughing.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the other old man, before looking at Zhao Ming Qing, \"Do you mind if you could go and settle my license now? It isn't too much to ask right?\"</p><br/><p>\"No.\" Zhao Ming Qing was full of vigor and energy now. He no longer wheezed and his body was free from ailments. \"Master, wait no, Teacher\u2026 don't you worry! I will definitely settle your paperwork. Let us now go back to the Ministry of Health.\"</p><br/><p>\"You lead the way,\" Lin Fan said impatiently. All he wanted right now was that license to practice. In this day and age, if you didn't have a certificate, it was almost impossible to do anything.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing was also excited and impatient to what was to come. \"Alright\u2026 alright\u2026\"</p><br/><p>At this moment, Mu Ling Ling, who was the pretty girl, almost wanted to cry. Grandpa Zhao had forgotten about her, and now even her own grandpa had forgotten about her. To add insult to injury, her pants were torn, causing her to be exposed to the world. Every time a wind blew, it would hit her on her exposed region, causing her to feel the shame once more.</p><br/><p>Just at this moment, Mu Lao suddenly remembered about her granddaughter. \"Master, master, my granddaughter is still immobilized by you.\"</p><br/><p>\"Oh right, I almost forgot,\" Lin Fan laughed, thereafter going up to the pretty girl, working his magic on her. Indeed, she had a beautiful figure and she was absolutely gorgeous.</p><br/><p>Facing Lin Fan's lecherous eyes, her heart was bellowing with rage, but she couldn't do anything in her current situation.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan moved one finger and took out the acupuncture needle from her body.</p><br/><p>Just as Lin Fan took out the acupuncture needle, Mu Ling Ling could start moving again. She immediately sent a kick at Lin Fan's head, but Lin Fan was quick enough to dodge it as he grabbed her by her legs. He paused for a moment, realizing that he was staring at something he wasn't supposed to see. It was black and had a laced design.</p><br/><p>\"Ah!\"</p><br/><p>Another scream pierced the air.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan relaxed his hands, letting her legs go. \"Don't you worry, no one else saw your black lace panties. Only I saw it.\"</p><br/><p>Mu Lao and Zhao Ming Qing were talking privately amongst themselves, but after hearing that screech, they immediately turned around to see the scene that was before them.</p><br/><p>Mu Ling Ling's shame turned into rage. She immediately buckled her legs and used both her hands to shield the part of her pants which was torn. \"Grandpa, can you hand me your jacket?!\"</p><br/><p>\"Granddaughter, Grandpa only has one jacket. What do you want to do with it?\" Mu Lao asked.</p><br/><p>Mu Ling Ling didn't know what to reply, but Lin Fan just interjected with a crude reply. \"Your granddaughter's pants have torn.\"</p><br/><p>\"Shut up,\" Mu Ling Ling said angrily. What kind of person would say such a thing so blatantly?</p><br/><p>Mu Lao immediately came over and took off his jacket. Mu Ling Ling used his jacket to cover the tear on her pants, before staring at Lin Fan. \"Just you wait. Come, grandpa, let us go home.\"</p><br/><p>Without saying another word, Mu Ling Ling turned around and made her way. But as she started walking, she realized that something wasn't right. Her grandpa wasn't following her.</p><br/><p>She turned around, astonished to find that her grandpa was following the young brat instead.</p><br/><p>\"Granddaughter, you go back yourself first. Grandpa wants to follow Brother Zhao to see what's up,\" Mu Lao instructed.</p><br/><p>\"Hmmph!\" Mu Ling Ling turned back in rage and immediately left the scene. She never thought that her own grandpa wouldn't follow her.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing was extremely excited. After he got all the paperwork for the license settled, Lin Fan would be his master. The very thought of that sent shivers down his spine. \"Come, teacher, let us go now.\"</p><br/><p>\"Alright,\" Lin Fan grinned. He had to settle this issue fast. Lin Fan was amazed at how smart he was to be able to have thought of this plan.</p><br/><p>If you don't believe me, I'll tie you to the tree and treat you. IF you still didn't believe me, then something wasn't right.</p><br/><p>Mu Lao followed on from the back, asking all sorts of questions. For Lin Fan, he felt too lazy to care about him. Although your granddaughter was gorgeous, this Master didn't look at outward appearance.</p><br/><p>The Ministry of Health.</p><br/><p>The counter staff felt helpless as she saw Lin Fan again. This handsome lad was really stubborn. But just as she was about to ask him to leave, she saw Zhao Ming Qing accompanying him.</p><br/><p>\"Do we have to go anywhere?\" Lin Fan asked.</p><br/><p>\"No, you don't have to. Just follow me. I'll go look for the head now. With my guarantee, you can pass all the tests without taking them.\" Zhao Ming Qing said.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing was a determined individual and his position was rather senior.</p><br/><p>The President of the Ministry of Health.</p><br/><p>\"Elder Zhao\u2026\" the President of the Ministry of Health stood up and bowed as Zhao Ming Qing walked in.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing's face was full of joy. \"Xiao Wang, this is my teacher, but he doesn't have any qualifications for Traditional Chinese Medicine yet, but I use my name as a guarantee that he has the skills and knowledge to be a practitioner, so could you certify him today?\"</p><br/><p>\"Alright, alright \u2026\" Xiao Wang chuckled as he said, before realizing what was going on. \"Elder Zhao, what did you say again?\"</p><br/><p>President Wang was stunned. Did he just hear correctly?</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing looked at Xiao Wang in the eye, before repeating himself. \"This is my teacher. I am here to be his guarantor that he his qualified to be a Traditional Chinese Medicine practitioner. I am asking for you to certify him today.\"</p><br/><p>Xiao Wang was in a daze, looking at Elder Zhao dumbfounded. He was kidding, was he? What kind of person was Elder Zhao? He was one of the most skilled people in Traditional Chinese Medicine. If he brought in students and asked for them to be certified, he could still believe it. But now, Elder Zhao brought in some young lad and said that he was his teacher. This was too impossible to grasp!</p><br/><p>Lin Fan frowned. \"Old gentleman, he doesn't seem to trust you.\"</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing was starting to feel a little awkward. He turned and looked at Xiao Wang. \"Xiao Wang, could you do it? If you can't, is there any other method of getting it done?\"</p><br/><p>Xiao Wang realized that Elder Zhao was getting a little agitated, and so he immediately conceded. \"Yes, yes it can be done. I'm just\u2026 shocked\u2026 let me sit for awhile\u2026\"</p><br/><p>He really needed to rest awhile. If he didn't, his heart wouldn't be able to take it. This news was like a magnitude 9 earthquake, and it shook everything he thought was possible.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Since she was such a good young talent, he naturally had to pay more attention to her. As for the other actors, he wasn\u2019t too pleased with them. It was as if they were in a fashion show, just there to show their faces to the camera.</p><br/><p>In their words, their fans were not there to watch them act but to see their faces and their charm.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you, Teacher Chen.\u201d Wu Huan Yue was delighted. After all, she had received a compliment from a senior. How could she not be delighted?</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-2\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Director Zhu smiled and said, \u201cAmong young actors, there aren\u2019t many that get praised by Teacher Chen.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you, Director.\u201d Although Wu Huan Yue had done pretty well in the singing world, she wasn\u2019t arrogant. She still studied humbly, was respectful to people, and treated her work seriously. Amongst the film crew, she was very well-liked.</p><br/><p>Practically everyone loved this humble actor who was unlike those big names that treated them with a sense of contempt.</p><br/><p>Chen Bao Guo said, \u201cTeacher Huang Xiu Fang has been looking for a student recently. I\u2019ll find the time to contact her. You can actually study under her. Settle down for a bit. It\u2019ll be of great help to you in the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Wu Huan Yue heard that name, she was instantly stunned.</p><br/><p>Huang Xiu Fang was a top-grade actor in the country and was considered a true veteran actor. She had basically devoted her life to film. But now, she had already retired and she would occasionally make guest appearances in some drama shows. Although she wasn\u2019t very popular with the current generation, her standing in the entertainment circle was very high.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan I really?\u201d asked Wu Huan Yue.</p><br/><p>Chen Bao Guo smiled. \u201cIt should be fine. She loves young people who are serious.\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-3\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cThank you, Teacher Chen,\u201d Wu Huan Yue thanked him once again.</p><br/><p>Director Zhu was astonished. He hadn\u2019t thought that Teacher Chen would recommend her like that. If he didn\u2019t know that Teacher Chen had a perfect family, with kids and grandchildren, and that he had never broken any rules before, he would\u2019ve thought that Chen Bao Guo had taken a liking for Wu Huan Yue.</p><br/><p>Now that he saw it, this was the older generation leading a young talent. This kind of opportunity was hard to come by.</p><br/><p>Then, he took a look at the camera.</p><br/><p>He frowned. <em>That female first lead is making an appearance again. Can\u2019t she put a little more effort into it?</em></p><br/><p><em>But forget it. As long as it\u2019s not too bad, it\u2019s fine. It\u2019s better not to demand too much.</em></p><br/><p>\u201cOk, we\u2019re done.\u201d The director clapped. They were finally done with the filming. It had really been tiring.</p><br/><p>The female first lead stopped what she was doing and saw Wu Huan Yue chatting with the director and Chen Bao Guo happily. Then, she wasn\u2019t very pleased.</p><br/><p>During the filming, this Wu Huan Yue had stolen her limelight. Everyone knew that she had released songs before and whenever she was free, she would sing a song for everyone and win everyone\u2019s praises.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, besides her face, the female first lead had nothing much to show for. She only knew how to do a seductive dance.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-4\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>But of course, if she showed her dance to these people, it would be humiliating.</p><br/><p>The manager rushed to Xie Qing\u2019s side and brought her to change her clothes.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis Wu Huan Yue is an evil woman pretending to be pure.\u201d The manager had a sharp eye. How could she not know what was going on? So, she whispered this to Xie Qing.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph,\u201d Xie Qing grunted in disdain.</p><br/><p>They were both young people but the most she had heard at the filming center was that her acting was great and that she was really gifted, etc. These compliments put her in a really bad mood.</p><br/><p>Outside.</p><br/><p>A luxurious sedan stopped in its tracks.</p><br/><p>When Director Zhu saw the car, he couldn\u2019t help but sigh. Their biggest investor was here.</p><br/><p>A middle-aged man got off the car and there was also another middle-aged man with him.</p><br/><p>\u201cChief Yang\u2026\u201d Director Zhu greeted him courteously.</p><br/><p>\u201cDirector Zhu, I heard that this TV show has been finalized, so I came to take a look. Where\u2019s Qing Qing?\u201d asked Chief Yang.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2019s changing right now and she should be out soon,\u201d said Director Zhu.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-5\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Everyone here knew that that Xie Qing had been put into the show by this Chief Yang. Moreover, when he had invested in the show, he had immediately reserved the spot for the first female lead.</p><br/><p>Although the two of them didn\u2019t display signs of closeness in public, everyone had an idea of their relationship. He was taking care of her. She served him and he took care of him in return.</p><br/><p>This kind of situation was quite common.</p><br/><p>\u201cDirector Zhu, let me introduce you. This is Hua Tian Film Corporation\u2019s Deputy Chief, Wang Xun. You recognize him, don\u2019t you?\u201d Chief Yang introduced.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, of course. I just haven\u2019t met him in person before. Welcome, Chief Wang.\u201d Director Zhu hurriedly went forward and shook his hand.</p><br/><p>Wang Xun nodded. Then, his gaze swept his surroundings and stopped at Wu Huan Yue.</p><br/><p>With his professional eyes, he could tell that this female performer was all natural. She hadn\u2019t gone through any cosmetic surgery. This was quite rare.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher Chen, we\u2019ve troubled you.\u201d Chief Yang looked at Chen Bao Guo with a beaming smile. He was courteous to this veteran actor as he should have been. But Chen Bao Guo was already old and times had changed. He was past his time.</p><br/><p>Chen Bao Guo chuckled and greeted him as well. He didn\u2019t quite like this kind of people but he still had to say the proper formalities.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to go take a look at Xie Qing. She was recommended by me. I can\u2019t let her cause you trouble. I\u2019ll come back later to chat with everyone,\u201d said Chief Yang. Then, he headed off in front.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-6\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Wang Xun followed him as well as he commented softly, \u201cThat actor at the side just now was pretty good.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re talking about Wu Huan Yue. She\u2019s pretty good indeed. She started off as a singer and I heard she has someone backing her. What is it? Have you taken a liking for her?\u201d Chief Yang laughed.</p><br/><p>Wang Xun chuckled. \u201cI feel that she\u2019s pretty good.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGet to know her better then. People who do acting have to get used to this, isn\u2019t that right? Even if she has someone backing her, she still needs the right connections. You\u2019re the Deputy Chief of Hua Tian Film Corporation, why wouldn\u2019t you be able to take on a newbie in the film industry?\u201d Chief Yang teased.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou really do make some sense.\u201d Wang Xun smiled but didn\u2019t say much else.</p><br/><p>When Xie Qing heard that Chief Yang was here, she was all smiles. Then, she packed up and came out. When she came out, she bumped into him at the entrance.</p><br/><p>\u201cChief Yang, you\u2019re here,\u201d said Xie Qing with a tender voice. Her voice was so delicate that Chief Yang couldn\u2019t quite resist it.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow was it? The filming is over. You\u2019re in a pretty good mood, aren\u2019t you?\u201d said Chief Yang with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m alright,\u201d replied Xie Qing.</p><br/><p>Wang Xun stood at the side. Then, Chief Yang introduced him, \u201cLet me introduce you to a big shot. Chief Wang, Wang Xun. He\u2019s a major figure in your film industry. Remember him in the future.\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-7\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Xie Qing saw him and greeted, \u201cNice to meet you, Chief Wang.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d Wang Xun nodded. He had seen many celebrities before but he knew about this Xie Qing. She had been quite popular a while ago.</p><br/><p>Chief Yang said, \u201cSince you\u2019re done with the filming, let\u2019s go outside to chat.\u201d</p><br/><p>Outside.</p><br/><p>As Chief Yang and Wang Xun arrived, the atmosphere changed slightly.</p><br/><p>Everyone\u2019s gazes were basically fixated on the three of them. Meanwhile, Xie Qing was all smiles. She quite enjoyed this kind of attention.</p><br/><p>She even shot a glance at Wu Huan Yue. Her meaning was clear. It was as if she was saying, \u2018See this? In here, I\u2019m the main character.\u2019</p><br/><p>Chen Bao Guo didn\u2019t say a single word as he just stood there watching them show off.</p><br/><p>With the big shots around, Xie Qing naturally received various compliments.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p></div>\n</div>"}

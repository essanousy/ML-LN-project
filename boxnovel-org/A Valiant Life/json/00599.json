The teaching materials have made a huge impact on all the Chinese Medical Academies across the country!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was startled. \u201cReally? It\u2019s doing so well?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing smiled, \u201cTeacher, these are teaching materials written by you, how could they be bad? I\u2019ve asked other people in my profession and they all have good comments about the new teaching materials. Compared to the old ones, they feel that these new teaching materials teach beginners true rudimentary medical abilities. And the students really like them too. Unlike how the old ones are, these new ones are easy to understand.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d Lin Fan smiled. As long as the new teaching materials were well received, he would earn a lot of Encyclopedic Points.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing said, \u201cTeacher, you can go on the Internet to take a look. The new teaching materials have appeared on the news. They are very well liked by students and teachers alike.\u201d</p><br/><p>After hanging up, Lin Fan immediately checked the news on the Internet.</p><br/><p>\u2018New Chinese Medicine teaching materials have drawn overwhelmingly positive feedback. Teachers and students of Chinese Medical Academies have praised them highly.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Teaching materials written by the Godly Doctor are much, much better than the old ones.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Students have expressed that these are the teaching materials that they have always needed.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. But at that moment, that smile on his face got even brighter.</p><br/><p>Encyclopedic Points +1</p><br/><p>Encyclopedic Points +1</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>At that moment, his Encyclopedic Points increased vigorously at a rate that Lin Fan had never dared to imagine. In the past, he had taken great pains just to earn a few Encyclopedic Points but now, the rate that he was earning at was simply scary.</p><br/><p>It kept going on and when it ended, Lin Fan had a look of shock in his eyes. The smile on his face was about to explode.</p><br/><p>Encyclopedic Points: 3450</p><br/><p>He had really never dared to imagine this before. It was really too perverse.</p><br/><p>And what made Lin Fan even more surprised was that his Encyclopedic Points were still slowly increasing.</p><br/><p>Bit!</p><br/><p>By bit!</p><br/><p>It seemed that there were constantly people studying his new teaching materials. However, as compared to the number of people in the whole country who study Chinese Medicine, it was still too little.</p><br/><p>But this was because some of the people that study Chinese Medicine just wasted their days away. He couldn\u2019t have expected all of them to immerse themselves in the teaching materials.</p><br/><p>But at this rate of progress, it wouldn\u2019t be impossible for his Encyclopedic Points to soar.</p><br/><p>At that moment, his phone rang.</p><br/><p>Zhou Qing Quan.</p><br/><p>\u201cCongratulations, Master Lin, your teaching materials have really exploded with popularity. The students of every academy really love them!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re flattering me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe, the Association members, are going to distribute your \u2018Various Types of Typhoid\u2019 as well. A great writing like that must be shared with everyone who has an interest in Chinese Medicine.\u201d</p><br/><p>For that to be distributed was all that Lin Fan could wish for.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright. If Chairman Zhou is taking care of it, I don\u2019t have to worry. Go ahead and distribute it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, thank you very much, Master Lin. When you come to Beijing next time, I\u2019ll definitely treat you to some wine.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright then.\u201d</p><br/><p>One after another, a few more calls came. The last one was from his father.</p><br/><p>\u201cDad, what\u2019s up?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSon, are those teaching materials on the news yours?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, they are.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha\u2026son, you\u2019re too brilliant. Dad is proud of you. I shan\u2019t talk anymore. I have to find a way to get a few copies of them and send them to your Uncle Li. I\u2019ll talk to you next time. I\u2019m hanging up.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shook his head helplessly. Of course, he knew of his father\u2019s intentions. Uncle Li was going to get attacked by his Dad again. Lin Fan couldn\u2019t help but feel tragic for Uncle Li. Uncle Li had met this kind of a neighbor and friend, what could he possibly do about it?</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian said, \u201cKid, what kind of happy incident have you come across now? That smile of yours has been there since morning.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled, \u201cHappy? Happy is an understatement for me right now. I feel like I\u2019m going to soar into the sky!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan carried a cup of tea over. \u201cBrother Lin, even though these teaching materials are well received, based on your personality, you wouldn\u2019t usually be so excited over this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled calmly. \u201cYou guys wouldn\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian said, \u201cHow could we understand if you don\u2019t tell us?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled but didn\u2019t reply. This situation wasn\u2019t something that could be explained. What could he possibly tell them? That his Encyclopedic Points had increased sharply?</p><br/><p>If he told them that, it would be like seeing a ghost.</p><br/><p>He was now a rich man. Over three thousand Encyclopedic Points! That was something that he had never dared to imagine before.</p><br/><p>But after this incident, he was filled with hope for the future. He had to keep working hard to keep earning more Encyclopedic Points.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The next day!</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan woke up, the first thing he did was check his Encyclopedic Points. When he saw it, he instantly smiled.</p><br/><p>Encyclopedic Points: 4035</p><br/><p>It had increased by a considerable amount from the previous day.</p><br/><p>It seemed like these Chinese Medicine teaching materials could indeed earn him enough Encyclopedic Points. As long as they didn\u2019t replace the teaching materials, he would have a never-ending source of Encyclopedic Points. Just thinking about it made him excited.</p><br/><p>There were many things in the Encyclopedia\u2019s Department Store that he wanted to get but in the end, he decided not to. He still had to complete a task.</p><br/><p>To get each child a perfect-grade little intelligence pill required an enormous amount of Encyclopedic Points. Six or seven thousand at least. Hence, he decided not to use the Encyclopedic Points unnecessarily for now.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Director Huang of the Children\u2019s Welfare Institute called.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, a group of volunteers has come to the Welfare Institute. Do you have time to see them?\u201d asked Director Huang.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan, \u201cAlright, I\u2019ll come by later. I didn\u2019t think that our Welfare Institute would get volunteers.\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Huang laughed, \u201cMaster Lin, actually, there are volunteers every week. It\u2019s just that you\u2019ve never noticed. Although these volunteers don\u2019t come frequently, they bring a different kind of feeling to the children.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled. Then, they hung up.</p><br/><p>Nanshan Children\u2019s Welfare Institute.</p><br/><p>Several cars stopped outside.</p><br/><p>Groups of men and women were carrying various types of things as they came out.</p><br/><p>One of them, a short-haired woman smiled and said, \u201cI never thought that I would become a volunteer. This is the first time for me. Wei Wei, you volunteer frequently. Are there any requirements we should take note of?\u201d</p><br/><p>This group of people hadn\u2019t volunteered before but their friend, Zhu Wei Wei, was a veteran volunteer. She would frequently go to various places to volunteer. This time, when she came to Nanshan Children\u2019s Welfare Institute, the rest followed along to take a look.</p><br/><p>Zhu Wei Wei was quite good-looking. She had a warm and gentle smile. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing much to take note of. Just interact with the children passionately. Let them feel your warmth.\u201d</p><br/><p>A man by the side smiled and said, \u201cAren\u2019t we just dealing with kids? I can do that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Wei Wei was a little displeased. \u201cYang Mu, they aren\u2019t little brats. Please mind your attitude.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yang Mu chuckled and said apologetically, \u201cDon\u2019t be angry, Wei Wei. I was just saying that casually.\u201d</p><br/><p>He wasn\u2019t really willing to come and volunteer. He just wanted to get closer to Wei Wei. He wasn\u2019t willing at all to come and play with some little brats. Since he had the time, he would rather do something more meaningful.</p><br/><p>\u201cYang Mu, you\u2019ll make Wei Wei unhappy like this. You really should mind yourself,\u201d the short-haired lady said with a smile as she held onto Wei Wei\u2019s arm.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Director Huang came. \u201cNice to meet you all. I\u2019m the Director of this place.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Wei Wei went forward and said, \u201cNice to meet you, Director. I\u2019m a volunteer, Zhu Wei Wei. Here\u2019s my volunteer certification.\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Huang smiled, \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Wei Wei was carrying some things. \u201cDirector Huang, this is my first time at Nanshan Children\u2019s Welfare Institute and I\u2019m not too familiar with this place. Could you give me an introduction? That way, I\u2019ll be more familiar the next time I come.\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Huang nodded, \u201cSure.\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Huang really liked these volunteers.</p><br/><p>Especially those who were truly willing to volunteer themselves.</p></div>\n</div>"}

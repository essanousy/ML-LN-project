Even if they combined all their net worth, they might not even reach $1 billion.</p><br/><p>They wanted to see how this fella was going to resolve the issue. Since the godly doctor had taken $1 billion from Godfather Ma, he probably couldn\u2019t leave the place safely.</p><br/><p>A good-looking man was holding a glass of wine and he shook his head in pity.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow pitiful, he had such a good opportunity and he didn\u2019t know how to cherish it. Now that he forced Godfather Ma to do such a thing, he is going to be in trouble in Qingzhou.\u201d</p><br/><p>Another wealthy lady nodded, \u201cThat\u2019s right. There isn\u2019t a lack of talent in this world. The world lacks people that could seize opportunities. He really asked for $1 billion.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe probably can\u2019t run away from this imminent war tonight. We should stay here and perhaps enjoy the show.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The crowd sighed after realizing that Lin Fan couldn\u2019t tell how wrong he was. To them, if they had this opportunity to save Godfather Ma, they would\u2019ve done it without any hesitation.</p><br/><p>When others had such a good opportunity to be in Godfather Ma\u2019s good books, they actually didn\u2019t take it. Their hearts ached for them.</p><br/><p>A middle-aged man shook his head. People knew him as one of the wealthiest men in Qingzhou. He had control over one-quarter of Qingzhou\u2019s real estate business. He was filthy rich. He was in the top 100 list of the Forbes\u2019 list in China.</p><br/><p>However, his profits had been decreasing but it was still a lot.</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung people are just like that. They feel that they can belittle people with a little bit of talent. So what if he is a godly doctor? He is just a paper tiger in front of power and money.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cChief Zhang said it correctly. It\u2019s such a pity.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Ma Qing Zhou looked at Lin Fan, \u201cI have paid $1 billion. Now, please treat my illness.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the crowd and stood up. Ma Qing Zhou smiled as he thought that the godly doctor was going to treat his illness.</p><br/><p>However, things seemed a little abnormal.</p><br/><p>He realized that this fella was heading towards the exit. He didn\u2019t seem like he was going to treat his illness.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Ma Qing Zhou said sternly. Then, he gestured at Liu Ren.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan continued walking, \u201cI\u2019m not doing anything else. I have asked for the money back and now I\u2019m leaving. If you want me to treat your disease, it\u2019s impossible. If I were to save you, you\u2019d only cause more pain to others. Even if I agreed, they might not agree with me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Clatter!</p><br/><p>Everyone was dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>Everyone was holding glasses of wine and they looked at him in shock.</p><br/><p>What?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did that fella say?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI think he is not going to treat Godfather Ma after taking his money.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn! Did I hear it wrongly?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck, that\u2019s crazy. Nobody can save him tonight.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s stand further away from him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, I saw this fella on Weibo before. He is pretty famous on Weibo. Did he think that his fame on Weibo can save him from this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPeople like him are like ants to Godfather Ma. Godfather Ma spent $4 million to hire a global celebrity to sing some songs during a ceremony. He didn\u2019t treat it seriously and do you know what happened in the end? Godfather Ma immediately gave him $10,000 and asked him to get lost. The man still caused trouble for Godfather Ma and asked for money. In the end, Godfather Ma only said one sentence.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKneel down and apologize. Get lost now. If not, you can forget about leaving Qingzhou. In the end, someone managed to appease Godfather Ma after talking to him about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cStand there!\u201d Godfather Ma shouted. \u201cDo you think you can leave like that after coming here? How dare you prank me? I want to see how many lives you have.\u201d</p><br/><p>Clatter!</p><br/><p>Suddenly, a group of bodyguards rushed out. They were tall, muscular and fearsome. When they arrived, everyone was frightened.</p><br/><p>They knew that every single one of them was vicious.</p><br/><p>It was impossible for that fella to leave the place.</p><br/><p>Ma Qing Zhou stood up furiously, \u201cDo you think you can leave here safely tonight?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan stopped and looked around. Then, he smiled, \u201cSince I dared to come here, I am confident of leaving. Do you think you can stop me from leaving?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph!\u201d Ma Qing Zhou sneered. \u201cI don\u2019t know if they can stop you but I can assure you that you\u2019ll not leave this place safely.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you one chance. Treat me illness and return me my money. Then, kneel down and apologize to me. I can assure you that you can leave Qingzhou safely. Otherwise, there will be one more corpse in Qingzhou tonight.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan sneered, \u201cHaha, you\u2019re insane.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, Lin Fan immediately wanted to leave the place. He couldn\u2019t be bothered by it.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was prepared to use a proper method to get rid of Ma Qing Zhou. If he wanted to use a scheming method, he had at least a few hundred methods to work with.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s asking for it. Take him down!\u201d This fella was too cocky. Ma Qing Zhou couldn\u2019t take it any further. He had never met someone like him before.</p><br/><p>Who was he?</p><br/><p>He was Ma Qing Zhou of Qingzhou. How could this small fry be cocky in front of him? If he didn\u2019t know his power, he would probably think that Ma Qing Zhou was a pushover.</p><br/><p>The crowd quickly stood far away from him.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis guy is finished.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s really asking for it. Godfather Ma probably ran out of patience.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf he ends up in Godfather Ma\u2019s hands, he would probably get his skin stripped.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Then, Lin Fan looked at the bodyguards and sighed. It looked like it was time for him to show them his power.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow dare you offend Godfather Ma? Tonight, you\u2019ll be staying here.\u201d The bodyguards rushed towards him ferociously.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shook his head helplessly. Even if he didn\u2019t get the major wuxia classification knowledge, he could probably finish them off with a few moves. He could probably finish them off with a snap now.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>Lin Fan started to move.</p><br/><p>Everyone looked at him in shock.</p><br/><p>He was about to show his power.</p><br/><p>Ah!</p><br/><p>A series of screams could be heard.</p><br/><p>The fearsome bodyguards suddenly became like bullets. They flew backwards and fell heavily to the ground. Some of them even ended up on the walls.</p><br/><p>Blood started spurting out.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow could that be\u2026\u201d Everyone was stunned.</p><br/><p>What was happening?</p><br/><p>Could an ordinary human do that?</p><br/><p>Ma Qing Zhou looked at Lin Fan in shock. He didn\u2019t know what had happened.</p><br/><p>How could it be\u2026</p><br/><p>Lin Fan turned and looked at Ma Qing Zhou.</p><br/><p>Ma Qing Zhou was stunned. His throat trembled, \u201cYou\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled calmly, \u201cGodfather Ma, I wanted to take it slow with you. However, your move made me realize that sometimes things have to be resolved by violence.\u201d Then, he looked around, \u201cTo all parasites of the society, please leave this place and wait outside. I have something to discuss with Godfather Ma.\u201d</p><br/><p>Parasites?</p><br/><p>This fella actually called them parasites.</p><br/><p>Everyone was furious.</p><br/><p>However, when they thought of his power, they remained silent. They thought that Godfather Ma would have no problem trying to finish this guy off. However, things looked different now.</p><br/><p>They left.</p><br/><p>Everyone left.</p><br/><p>Only Godfather Ma, Liu Ren, Lin Fan and the immobilized bodyguards were left in the room.</p><br/><p>Godfather Ma said in shock, \u201cWhy are you so powerful?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled and blinked. \u201cThere\u2019s something more powerful.\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

A lot of anonymous people complained about it and wanted Weibo to delete Lin Fan\u2019s account.</p><br/><p>However, Weibo would be doomed if they did that. The godly doctor was so powerful and if they really deleted his account, who knew what would happen?</p><br/><p>Anyway, the matter had nothing to do with them. Furthermore, all those that complained were using anonymous accounts. Hence, they ignored those complaints. If they were brave enough, they should use their real accounts. If not, Weibo wouldn\u2019t bother about the complaints.</p><br/><p>The discussion online was intense.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, that\u2019s shocking. I\u2019ve never seen a person who dares to publicise the truth to everyone.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, that doesn\u2019t mean a thing. Look at who it is, he is Master Lin. He has always been fearless on Weibo.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPerhaps the people at the Education Department really want to kill themselves now. Although Master Lin didn\u2019t blame anyone, this matter would definitely implicate them directly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI am truly impressed by Master Lin and nobody else.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is a number of people that have started to go against the Education Department. They feel that they\u2019ve been teaching people incorrect information about Chinese medicine.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, where is Master Lin today? Did he run away after what had happened yesterday?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou must be talking rubbish. He\u2019s already pushed the blame to them. Why would he still care?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>At the Education Department.</p><br/><p>They held an urgent meeting.</p><br/><p>The Director was at a loss. They had been spammed with phone calls. All of them requested for new Chinese Medicine materials. He felt like killing himself. This matter was so bizarre. They weren\u2019t Chinese medical doctors and those grandmasters who taught the materials didn\u2019t say anything about it. How would they have known that there had been a problem with the materials? Lin Fan had cornered them and they didn\u2019t know what to do.</p><br/><p>\u201cDirector, what should we do now? The public opinion matters a lot.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe have to try to control the situation as soon as possible.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think we can control it. A lot of Chinese medical students from all universities are on a strike now. They want us to bring in teaching materials that teach the right content.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTeaching materials without any mistakes\u2026 Where do we go to find them?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t the godly doctor writing it now? Actually, we can just bring in his teaching materials.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cQuickly contact Zhao Ming Qing. Wait until his teacher finishes writing the materials and get him to send it to us. If it is possible, we will immediately publish it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the best we can do.\u201d</p><br/><p>They quickly went to publicise the matter. Furthermore, this had a huge implication and they had to organize a press conference to report it. At the same time, they needed to gain the trust of people.</p><br/><p>They didn\u2019t want to talk much about the godly doctor. He was indeed superb at pushing the blame.</p><br/><p>Wu Xi Jun, in particular, had been doing well by selling his medical equipment. He had a conflict with the godly doctor and thus the Education Department was in this hot mess. Therefore, they hated Wu Xi Jun a lot.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, other family members\u2026</p><br/><p>Some of the parents that sent their children to the Chinese Medical Academies had been reading the news. When the news came out, they were extremely nervous. They didn\u2019t like the fact that their children chose to study Chinese medicine. Now, something like this had happened and they were worried.</p><br/><p>If not for the godly doctor revealing the truth, they wouldn\u2019t have known that the foundation teaching materials for Chinese medicine actually had a lot of mistakes. Weren\u2019t they harming their children by sending them there?</p><br/><p>At Shanghai\u2019s First Chinese Medical Academy.</p><br/><p>Some of the students that felt conflicted were silenced. They didn\u2019t feel conflicted anymore. The teaching materials had mistakes and they couldn\u2019t do anything about it. They would be learning the wrong things if they continued studying.</p><br/><p>Then, they took a different stand.</p><br/><p>They had to support the change in teaching materials.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing read the news online and chuckled. His mentor was indeed incredible. He had immediately pushed the blame to the people at the Education Departments.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was extremely bored. He didn\u2019t bother about the online situation anymore. Anyway, he wasn\u2019t the one in trouble. They had to resolve it themselves. He just had to write the materials in peace.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian walked over, \u201cHow could you be sitting here? Don\u2019t you care about what\u2019s happening online?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked calm, \u201cWhat happened online? It has nothing to do with me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian raised his thumb, \u201cYou\u2019re awesome. You created such a big mess and you\u2019re still so calm. I\u2019m impressed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled, \u201cHaha, don\u2019t be.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan smiled, \u201cBrother Lin, you were awesome yesterday. A lot of netizens are discussing your posts right now. However, if they knew that you\u2019re so calm, what do you think they would do?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang said, \u201cWhat else? They would definitely kill Brother Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was a little upset. \u201cThat\u2019s not correct. I have done my part. Now, it depends on them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, I have to write the materials now. This is an important task. It\u2019s extremely stressful,\u201d Lin Fan shook his head and said. Then, he continued writing.</p><br/><p>Ding ding!</p><br/><p>Then, his phone rang.</p><br/><p>It was Wang Ming Yang. He finally bothered to call him.</p><br/><p>He picked up the phone.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello, Ming Yang, you finally called me,\u201d Lin Fan chuckled.</p><br/><p>However, something was wrong. The person on the phone was crying and it was a lady.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d Lin Fan asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Lin, I am Zi Le. Something bad happened to Ming Yang,\u201d Xu Zi Le was anxious.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was nervous after hearing that. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>Something was wrong. He had read Wang Ming Yang\u2019s fortune before. Wang Ming Yang was supposed to be enjoying the later years of his life. What could have happened?</p><br/><p>Xu Zi Le said anxiously, \u201cI don\u2019t know. Come to the office quickly. We don\u2019t know what happened.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll be there soon.\u201d Lin Fan stood up after hanging up and left immediately.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian looked at Lin Fan, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>However, Lin Fan had already left. Fraud Tian shook his head helplessly. He wondered what had happened.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was mumbling to himself as he drove off.</p><br/><p>Could something bad really have happened?</p><br/><p>No, it didn\u2019t seem logical.</p><br/><p>His fortune-telling abilities were the best in the world. It definitely wouldn\u2019t go wrong.</p><br/><p>At Eastern Han Organisation.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan parked his car at the entrance and rushed inside.</p><br/><p>The staff at the counter greeted Lin Fan as she knew that he was their Boss\u2019s best friend.</p><br/><p>He went up the lift to the top floor.</p><br/><p>As he walked towards the conference room, he could hear frantic noises coming from it.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan pushed the door open and entered. He saw a group of people which gathered around. Xu Zi Le was in shock. She was leaning on Wang Ming Yang. \u201cMing Yang, what\u2019s wrong? Don\u2019t scare me like that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Lin Fan asked.</p><br/><p>Xu Zi Le immediately went forward when she saw Lin Fan. \u201cBrother Lin, come and have a look. It seems like something is wrong with Ming Yang.\u201d</p><br/><p>The others made way for him. They were also nervous and afraid of what was to come.</p><br/><p>One of the secretaries said, \u201cMaster Lin, I feel like Chief Wang got possessed by a ghost.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan frowned in silence. Who would dare to possess his best friend?</p></div>\n</div>"}

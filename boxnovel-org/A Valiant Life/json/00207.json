At the end, Lin Fan finished his speech and received an award. There was even a certificate. This certificate was much better than the last.</p><br/><p>It was a gold-framed Good Citizen award, his second one. To receive this award a second time was rather refreshing to him.</p><br/><p>Below the stage.</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian patted Lin Fan on the shoulder. \"You were incredible. How do you feel?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. He had been feeling good at first, but now, he didn't know what to say. Everything had come at him too quickly. He hadn't been prepared at all.</p><br/><p>\"Very good. Not bad at all,\" said Lin Fan with a smile. At the same time, he was prepared to go back and look through the sixth page of knowledge. Now that he thought about it, it wasn't bad at all.</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian chuckled, \"I felt that you expressed yourself pretty well. When I went on stage, there were so many leaders below that I was a little nervous. You may not know it, but that host was left with nothing to say after you spoke. Moreover, those China Central Television reporters are here today too. It'll surely appear on the news broadcast. We have to take a good look at the news tonight. I'm not too sure how I'll appear.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan started laughing as well, \"You'll look dashing for sure. Oh right, have you gotten in touch with those children's families?\"</p><br/><p>At this point, Liu Xiao Tian's expression became slightly gloomy. Lin Fan was surprised. \"Could it be that there's an issue?\"</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian nodded, \"There's a big issue. Things didn't go as perfectly as we had thought it would. I contacted some parents. They were all very emotional at first but when they found out that their children have had their legs broken or developed some other problems with their bodies, some of them put me off or were unwilling to take their children back.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was silent. He had not thought that what Wu Tian He had said would be so accurate. \"Then what happens if those parents are unwilling?\"</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian sighed, \"If they're unwilling, we can only send the children to children welfare institutes nearby. We're slowly communicating with those parents and hoping that they will take the children back. After all, it'd be best if the children go back to their own parents.\"</p><br/><p>\"Currently, we've gotten in contact with 385 children's families. Among them, 60 children's parents are unwilling to take them back. Another 900 children's parents have not been found yet but we are working hard on it. The amount of follow-up work for this is tremendous. After this conference, we have to start getting busy on this matter. These human traffickers are way too cruel. Some of these are two or three-year-olds and they've already gotten their hands and legs broken. The more brutal cases involve them getting their tongues cut off. It's simply brutal.\"</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian was filled with resentment. He wanted these human traffickers to die but he knew it wasn't possible.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan continued to ask, \"What sentence will those human traffickers get?\"</p><br/><p>\"Too many of them have been caught. I'm afraid the lightest sentence will only be a couple of years of imprisonment. For a mastermind like Wang Shen, it should be either a life imprisonment or a death sentence. As for the rest, it's hard to say. We have to see how the court judges it,\" Liu Xiao Tian said with a little uncertainty. This was the first time he had come across such a case.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded. Human traffickers did sometimes get away with light sentences but what happened from then on was out of his control. The final outcome depended on the court's decision. For a matter like this, the court would definitely make a decision that pleased the society.</p><br/><p>\"Sigh, those children are really pitiful. If their parents don't take responsibility, then there's really no other choice,\" Lin Fan said with a sigh.</p><br/><p>This wasn't something that he could help with alone. A few hundred children. He couldn't possibly take responsibility for all of them alone. No matter how big of a heart he had, it just wasn't possible.</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian patted Lin Fan on the shoulder. \"Don't think too much. Leave this matter to us. The government will settle it properly.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded. No matter what, this was still a huge victory for them. They had given those human traffickers still at large a big warning.</p><br/><p>At that moment, a group of reporters rushed forward. And that Chu Yuan was among them.</p><br/><p>One of the reporters said, \"Good day Master Lin, I'm a reporter from Guangming Daily. May I ask you a few questions?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded, \"You may.\"</p><br/><p>The reporter asked, \"You came out revealing your face. What if the buddies of those human traffickers came to find you for trouble?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed, \"If they came to me, it would be best. I won't hold back against those human traffickers. I'll capture those who deserve to be captured.\"</p><br/><p>The reporters were all recording this. They felt that Master Lin was really amazing and they were all in admiration of him. If it was anyone else, they would have been extremely frightened but Master Lin was completely fearless. They really had to respect him.</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian said, \"My fellow people, we absolutely will not allow for that to happen. We will guarantee Master Lin's safety.\"</p><br/><p>Chu Yuan came forward and said, \"Chief Liu, may we know how many of those children's families have been contacted? And how many of those children have been cruelly treated by the human traffickers? If some of the children's families can't be contacted, what will be the arrangement for them?\"</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian waved his hand. \"This matter will be announced later on. As for now, all we have are unconfirmed numbers and it's best not to comment on this.\"</p><br/><p>After that, Lin Fan parted with Liu Xiao Tian and the rest. Those leaders would have to get busy when they returned to their offices as well.</p><br/><p>This raid on the human traffickers could be said to have come to a satisfactory conclusion. However, the real troublesome part was just beginning. The outcome of the human traffickers would take a very long time to decide. They had to refer to each of their criminal records to determine their crimes. As for those children who had been kidnapped, it was another issue. They had to find a children welfare institute for them to settle in. In particular, those with broken hands or legs would suffer in terms of their education. They had to at least develop some sort of skill. Otherwise, they wouldn't be able to live a comfortable life when they grow old.</p><br/><p>Cloud Street!</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan reached, the owners of the surrounding shops all gathered around.</p><br/><p>\"Welcome back, Little Boss!\"</p><br/><p>\"We all saw Little Boss's speech on stage today. It was incredible.\"</p><br/><p>\"Indeed. What would you need a mask for? Those human traffickers won't dare to come to our Cloud Street. If they really do come, we'll all attack them together and make sure they never leave.\"</p><br/><p>The shop owners all surrounded Lin Fan, talking non-stop. Lin Fan started laughing as well. This Cloud Street had a pretty good atmosphere. Everyone was friendly with each other.</p><br/><p>Sister Hong said, \"All the best, Little Boss.\"</p><br/><p>Ever since Lin Fan had helped her find her daughter, Sister Hong treated him as her savior. Although Master Lin didn't ask for anything, she directed all her gratitude to Elder Dog. Elder Dog was now a royal being on Cloud Street. No matter which shop he visited, he was embraced with a warm welcome.</p><br/><p>Whenever Elder Dog entered Sister Hong's shop, she would lock her poodle up in there for Elder Dog to do whatever he liked.</p><br/><p>But even with outside help, Elder Dog was never successful. He had a small body and a small p*nis. He couldn't get in no matter what. And he always left the place disappointed. However, he only got more and more determined and he would go there a few times a day.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan smiled and said, \"You were way too dashing on the broadcast.\"</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian shook his head, \"I have never bowed down to anyone in my life, but I'd bow down to you.\"</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang held his phone in front of Lin Fan. \"Everyone, take a good look. Our Master Lin is back!\"</p><br/><p>In the midst of everyone's welcome, Lin Fan just waved his hand coolly.</p><br/><p>Low-key...</p><br/>\n</div>"}

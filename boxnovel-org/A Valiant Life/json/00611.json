He said, \u201cI can\u2019t let this guy die, I need to bring him home.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Hu said, \u201cBrother Qiang won\u2019t agree to this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Wei shook his head and said, \u201cNo, it doesn\u2019t matter whether he agrees or not, I need to bring him back to Myanmar.\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, Wu Wei tugged on Lin Fan\u2019s clothes saying, \u201cAs long as you help me, I will guarantee your safety. I\u2019ll even let you go.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shook his head and laughed and then slowly got up. Even though both his legs were tied together, getting up was not a problem.</p><br/><p>Wu Wei and the rest of them had let their guard down already. It was due to what Lin Fan said just now that completely stunned them so now they did not really think much about anything else.</p><br/><p>Suddenly!</p><br/><p>Lin Fan gave a very dramatic expression as he looked at the door and said, \u201cBrother Qiang, what are you doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>The three of them immediately looked at the door but there was no one there. The three of them started to have a bad feeling about this.</p><br/><p>When the three of them turned around and looked, they only had bad feelings about what was going to happen.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe master of Ba Gua Zhang, Master Lin, is here.\u201d</p><br/><p>*bang*</p><br/><p>*bang*</p><br/><p>After a few strikes, the three of them fell to the ground, motionless.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, that\u2019s awesome,\u201d Lu Li said. Upon seeing all of this he very happily said, \u201cBrother Lin, you are too amazing. They have all been dealt with by you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan had gotten himself free of the handcuffs a long time ago. Using this kind of handcuffs to try and lock up the escape artist. What a joke.</p><br/><p>Lu Li asked, \u201cBrother Lin, how did you break free of the locks?\u201d</p><br/><p>Right now, in Lu Li\u2019s heart, Lin Fan was like a God to him. Also, Lin Fan had a vastly different impression of Lu Li now.</p><br/><p>When he first met him, he thought he was a high and mighty b*stard. He never thought that all of this was just for show. After going through this kidnapping, Lu Li was scared till his face turned white. Turns out he was just a coward.</p><br/><p>\u201cBy using this,\u201d Lin Fan said as he was holding on to a thin iron wire in his hands.</p><br/><p>This stunned Lu Li. His face was in complete disbelief as he said, \u201cD*mn it, this is really too awesome. To just rely on this and being able to break free of handcuffs, it\u2019s really too awesome.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan went to remove Lu Li\u2019s handcuffs and then said, \u201cOkay, done. You should figure out a way to get home by yourself.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lu Li replied, \u201cWhat about you Brother Lin?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMe? I\u2019m definitely going to stay here and then catch them all in one go. You should know that for me, Lin Fan, to not completely defeat the enemy is not my style,\u201d Lin Fan replied with a smile.</p><br/><p>Lu Li gave a slow and unsophisticated nod and was finally convinced. If it was a normal person, they would retreat at the first opportunity. However, this Master Lin was really too good. He was still thinking of completely defeating his enemy. He was really too awesome.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, okay. Then I shall leave first. When I get back I\u2019ll inform the police. Those b*satds took my phone away though, so I have no idea where this place is,\u201d Lu Li said.</p><br/><p>Then, Lu Li left. Lin Fan then scanned the area.</p><br/><p>He found a rope and he was going to tie these three b*stards up first before waiting for the others to arrive.</p><br/><p>The preparations were done. Lin Fan was feeling a bit apprehensive inside. He did not know how many people were going to be with this b*stard. Although Lin Fan was very quick on his feet, he definitely would not be able to dodge bullets.</p><br/><p>He saw the two guns on the floor and then hatched an idea.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>A commercial vehicle drove in from afar.</p><br/><p>Brother Qiang said, \u201cBring them over here in a moment\u2019s time. When the boss arrives then we will leave.\u201d</p><br/><p>This time, all the preparations had been done. They had already bribed the waterway officials. So when \u2018scorpion\u2019 was released, they could escape through the waterway. Although they could just leave China just like that, they could hide in this safe spot for a while and then when everything settled down they could leave.</p><br/><p>*bang*</p><br/><p>The sound of a gunshot rang out.</p><br/><p>The henchman in the vehicle was cried out in shock, \u201cThere\u2019s a gunshot.\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly, the vehicle\u2019s steering wheel changed direction. The henchman who was driving was stunned.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Qiang, the tires have been blown out.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>They did not have a moment to react when suddenly, the car violently flipped over.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was standing at the warehouse door. He let out a smile and then gave the gun barrel a blow. Not bad, not bad, this impromptu gun idea was actually pretty awesome.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, What is going on?\u201d Brother Qiang said as his face was filled with shock. Then he calmed down and said, \u201cGuy on top, go check what\u2019s going on.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone crawled out of the vehicle and then immediately took cover behind the car.</p><br/><p>*bang*</p><br/><p>Another gunshot rang out,</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, my leg. The shooter is behind us.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Brother Qiang heard this, he hurried to look behind, but there was no one there. Who in the world was firing from behind them?</p><br/><p>*bang*</p><br/><p>Another gunshot rang out.</p><br/><p>The person next to Brother Qiang also grabbed on to his leg and said, \u201cHe is behind us.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, where in the world is the guy?\u201d Brother Qiang was furious. The other party had opened up with two shots and he still did not know where the shooter was. They were all hiding behind the vehicle so it was not possible for them to hit from the front.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, Brother Qiang. The gunshots are coming from the front,\u201d one of the drug dealers frantically said.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan immediately wielded both guns. The feeling inside was indescribable. It was really too awesome.</p><br/><p>He was standing at the door of the warehouse and shooting. Although they had cover behind the vehicle, he did not think he was able to bend bullets and then was actually able to hit them in the leg.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck, What is going on? Who is shooting us from behind?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhoever is the one shooting, show yourself.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Qiang, the gunshots are coming from in front.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFront, your a*s. Are you blind? We are hiding behind a vehicle, how in the world can they hit us from in front? Attack the back!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut we can\u2019t see anyone!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust shoot, I don\u2019t care if you guys can\u2019t see anyone.\u201d</p><br/><p>*bang*</p><br/><p>*bang*</p><br/><p>Incessant gunshots rang out. It was just an empty space in front of them and they could not see anyone. But they did not care and they just laid down a hell load of gunfire.</p><br/><p>*bang*</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Qiang, I\u2019ve been shot.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is no one behind us, the guy is shooting us from the front. He can bend his bullets.\u201d</p><br/><p>Brother Qiang snarled, \u201cBend your a*s!.\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, Brother Qiang was dumbfounded. He had no idea what was going on and where the gunshots were coming from.</p><br/><p>As far as bending bullets, this was only something you saw on the television.</p><br/><p>*bang*</p><br/><p>A horrific thing had happened.</p><br/><p>The people next to him were all getting shot. The thing that horrified him the most was that he still had not figured out where the other guy was.</p><br/><p>How was this possible?</p><br/><p>Lin Fan never thought that his impromptu knowledge of guns would turn into something like this. It was a little scary. Also, the encyclopedic knowledge required was not expensive and it was very convenient.</p><br/><p>A final gunshot rang out.</p><br/><p>Brother Qiang\u2019s horrified scream rang out. He knew it, his mission was complete.</p><br/><p>He still could not wrap his head around it. Where was the guy shooting from? He looked around but could not see anyone. Then he looked at the wound of his leg. It was clear that he was shot from behind.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Qiang, what\u2019s up?\u201d At this moment, a voice came from the front.</p><br/><p>Brother Qiang was stunned. He hurried to turn his head around and was shocked. He said, \u201cYou\u2026 what are you doing here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan dropped the gun in his hands and then said, \u201cAre you dumb? I had been shooting you guys from the front and haven\u2019t moved an inch and you still ask me what I\u2019m doing here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow could this be\u2026\u201d Brother Qiang said as he looked at Lin Fan in disbelief.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>At the police station!</p><br/><p>Li Lu was lucky. He bumped into a driver along the way. If not, he wouldn\u2019t have known how long it would take for him to reach the police station.</p><br/><p>When he reached the entrance to the police station, he saw Qin Ju and the rest of them.</p><br/><p>\u201cHelp me\u2026\u201d Lu Li shouted.</p><br/><p>Qin Ju looked at where the sound was coming from and then his expression changed. He shouted in joy, \u201cHow did you get back?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCome with me, I\u2019ll direct you guys there and I\u2019ll slowly explain,\u201d Lu Li said. He did not have the time to talk rubbish with them, he had to hurry and bring men to Master Lin\u2019s aid. There were so many bad guys and they were armed, it was suicide for Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>\u2026.</p></div>\n</div>"}

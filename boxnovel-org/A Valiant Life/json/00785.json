It wasn\u2019t their first time there and their trips there were practically useless.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan led them there and the security guard immediately rushed out after seeing the situation.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d The security guard asked before shouting for back up.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cI brought them here to seek help from the leaders so that they can get their salaries.\u201d</p><br/><p>The security guard furrowed his brows, \u201cWhy are there so many of you? If you want your salaries, you should head to the relevant authorities. Why are you here? Get lost and do not cause trouble.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, a lot of reporters started rushing in. When they saw the crowd at the entrance of the Ministry of Manpower, they were ecstatic.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin\u2026\u201d Even when nobody could be seen, the voices of the reporters could be heard.</p><br/><p>When the security guard saw that there were so many reporters, he was stunned.</p><br/><p>What were they doing?</p><br/><p>A reporter said, \u201cMaster Lin, may I know what is happening? Why are you requesting for their salaries?\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporters took turns to ask questions.</p><br/><p>When the migrant workers saw the situation, they were in disbelief. They were even a little anxious. They felt like the matter had been blown up.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan faced the reporters and said calmly, \u201cActually, the situation is simple. One of my fans is a worker at the construction site. He sent me several private messages on Weibo to seek my help. However, I didn\u2019t really take note of my private messages recently. Hence, I didn\u2019t see the messages until today. I contacted him and found out that he hadn\u2019t received his salary and I wanted to help him out.\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporter asked, \u201cMay I know if you decided to help him just because he is your fan?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved his hand, \u201cThis is just one of the reasons but it is not the only reason. A beautiful city has to rely on these workers to build on the foundation. They build everything with their bare hands so that we can live comfortably in our houses. We have to thank them for everything. Now that the New Year is almost here, they\u2019re not getting what they should be paid. As long as you have a kind heart, you definitely would do something about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gradually, people started to gather around them.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell said.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. If not for them, we wouldn\u2019t be able to live in such beautiful houses.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAs for Mother Earth Real Estate Corporation, I don\u2019t care how many people they hired. These workers worked for them and I am here at the Ministry of Manpower today to seek the help of the leaders,\u201d Lin Fan added.</p><br/><p>The security guard at the entrance felt that something was wrong and he immediately contacted the leader.</p><br/><p>There were reporters and the New Year was coming. If they didn\u2019t handle this situation carefully and if it were to blow up to a national level, the consequences would be unimaginable.</p><br/><p>A reporter said, \u201cWhat Master Lin said was right. This should never happen at all.\u201d</p><br/><p>As reporters, they had encountered a lot of incidents before. Sometimes, when things get blown up, the companies would start paying the workers. However, those that were unlucky would have their managers running away. In the end, they would have wasted a year of hard work.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The leader of the reporter was drinking tea and when he heard about this incident, his face changed. \u201cWhat? You mean Master Lin brought the people here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. I think it\u2019s because the construction company isn\u2019t paying them. One of them is a big fan of Master Lin. Hence, Master Lin led them here to seek help from us.\u201d</p><br/><p>The leader was stunned, \u201cDoes this have anything to do with him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, but the reporters are here. Furthermore, Master Lin is considered to be a public figure. His actions and words are always being watched.\u201d</p><br/><p>The leader didn\u2019t reply. However, he had understood it. If he didn\u2019t manage this properly, things were going to get worse.</p><br/><p>Especially since the reporters were there. According to the information he had gotten, there were a lot of reporters. If he didn\u2019t take the initiative to resolve this, who knew what rubbish the reporters were going to write about him?</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t think about anything else. He immediately stood up and went out to handle the situation.</p><br/><p>He had to do something about it. He had to resolve it by today.</p><br/><p>At the entrance of the Ministry of Manpower.</p><br/><p>Leader Wang rushed forward. When he saw Lin Fan, his face changed. He went forward and greeted him warmly, \u201cHi, Master Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled, \u201cHi, Leader Wang. I hope you\u2019re not too angry. I am helpless about this issue.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI understand.\u201d Then, he added sternly, \u201cMaster Lin, don\u2019t worry. I will definitely handle this well. They are one of the main reasons why Shanghai is so beautiful today. Now that something like that has happened, I will definitely resolve this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cThen, I\u2019ll have to trouble you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say that. The aim of the Ministry of Manpower is to serve the citizens. If we had known about this earlier, we wouldn\u2019t have let Master Lin come here personally,\u201d Leader Wang said.</p><br/><p>The reporters surrounded them. One of them asked, \u201cHi, Leader Wang. May I know if these workers can get their salaries back?\u201d</p><br/><p>Leader Wang looked at the reporter and patted his chest. \u201cThey will definitely get their salaries. If not, the government will pay. We will ensure that they return home happily for the New Year.\u201d Of course, he couldn\u2019t have said that the workers wouldn\u2019t be able to get their salaries back.</p><br/><p>*clap*</p><br/><p>Lin Fan started applauding. Then, he looked at the migrant workers. \u201cDid you hear that? The leader has spoken. If he can\u2019t get your money, the government will pay for you. Quick, thank the leader.\u201d</p><br/><p>When the migrant workers heard that, they were ecstatic. It was as if the government had too much money to spare.</p><br/><p>Leader Wang smiled but it was a little awkward. Since he had said such a thing, he had to keep to it. What else could he do?</p><br/><p>This time, he couldn\u2019t push the blame onto someone else anymore. If he were to do so, he\u2019d be dead.</p><br/><p>Leader wang said, \u201cCome in first. Let\u2019s understand the situation before we resolve it. In recent years, we have received quite a number of such complaints about delayed salaries. We\u2019ve resolved them promptly. I believe it wouldn\u2019t be an exception this time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cWe\u2019re helpless about it. We can only rely on you for it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say that,\u201d Leader Wang said humbly. He had been praised by Lin Fan and he couldn\u2019t back down on his promise.</p><br/><p>The reporters didn\u2019t want to leave at all. They wanted to know the development of the situation.</p><br/><p>A large group of people entered the conference room of the Ministry of Manpower.</p><br/><p>On the way there, Leader Wang had been thinking about how to resolve this problem.</p><br/><p>The real estate developers these days were really crafty and the situation was difficult to resolve.</p><br/><p>They weren\u2019t the only ones that were trying to push the blame away. The real estate developers were the best at pushing the blame.</p><br/><p>They contracted workers from different sub-companies and the terms and conditions were written clearly. They used them to push the blame. Sometimes, they wouldn\u2019t even know who to look for if they encountered a problem.</p><br/><p>It was a headache.</p><br/><p>At the labor services company.</p><br/><p>The previous chief labor contractor who spoke to the manager on the phone was stunned when he saw the situation online.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t expect such a thing to happen.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t expect Master Lin to post on Weibo to attract reporters.</p><br/><p>However, they really didn\u2019t have any money. When they received money from the companies that managed them, they spent all the money on the facilities of the construction site. They had to take the remaining money home for the New Year and they didn\u2019t have any money left for these migrant workers.</p><br/><p>However, when he saw the Weibo post, he felt that something was wrong.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

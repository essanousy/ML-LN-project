It was at least two times more than the past years. Initially, they weren\u2019t going to hold the competition here but this time, the number of people hit 500 and the previous small area couldn\u2019t contain so many people. Hence, they could only settle for this place.</p><br/><p>The shop owners were waiting outside and they were talking among themselves. Each of them was in charge of two children.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow did Little Boss train them? They\u2019re so good at drawing at such a young age. It\u2019s impressive.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat else? Little Boss is not a simple man. It\u2019s probably easy for him to educate these kids.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI hope they can get a good placing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll definitely be able to. Didn\u2019t we go there and see the children draw before? They\u2019re good at it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s true.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan smiled, \u201cBrother Lin, are you nervous?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled and replied, \u201cWhy would I be nervous? I\u2019m not nervous at all.\u201d</p><br/><p>He was definitely not nervous. Especially when Lil\u2019 Fatty was so gifted in Chinese arts. He was much better than the others and what he did wasn\u2019t just based on practice.</p><br/><p>According to the modern perspective, a genius is equivalent to 99% hard work and 1% talent.</p><br/><p>However, the truth is, the 1% talent is much more important than the 99% hard work.</p><br/><p>The 365 children definitely had no problem clinching the second and third prize. The commendation prizes were not out of reach either. Lil\u2019 Fatty looked to be the most confident to clinch the top spot.</p><br/><p>The competition had a three-hour time limit.</p><br/><p>The competition ended at 11 am and the kids walked out.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go and fetch them,\u201d Lin Fan smiled and said.</p><br/><p>There were a lot of children from the welfare organization and Lin Fan was standing at the exit, watching the shop owners bring them out. When Lil\u2019 Fatty walked out, he heaved a sigh of relief. Finally, the last child was out and there weren\u2019t any missing ones.</p><br/><p>The other parents asked how did the competition go.</p><br/><p>\u201cDad, it was difficult. I didn\u2019t draw very well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t even finish drawing when it ended.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMum, I drew pretty well. I drew a lot of flowers.\u201d</p><br/><p>The kids were explaining to their parents but they were already very happy to be able to participate in it.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cLet\u2019s go back to the welfare organization.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although everyone was out, the main cook was still at the welfare organization. They would be able to eat an awesome meal after returning back.</p><br/><p>To the children, they were still ecstatic.</p><br/><p>Lil\u2019 Fatty held onto Lin Fan\u2019s hand, \u201cUncle Lin, I was really serious today. I drew exactly what I wanted to draw.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled, \u201cReally? What did you draw?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lil\u2019 Fatty replied, \u201cI saw it in the books. It had mountains and waters. There were people carrying boats and there were a lot of mountains. I remember it very clearly.\u201d</p><br/><p>After consuming the Little Intelligence pill, the memory of the kids had drastically improved. Although they couldn\u2019t remember everything, it was much better than a lot of people.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan complimented, \u201cNot bad. Lil\u2019 Fatty is awesome.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lil\u2019 Fatty was elated after being praised. To a kid, the best feeling in the world was to be praised. Kids wouldn\u2019t know the meaning of modesty.</p><br/><p>After returning to the welfare organization, the kids gathered around and talked about what they had drawn.</p><br/><p>The shop owners smiled, \u201cLittle Boss, we\u2019re here at the welfare organization again. Could you cook some dishes to let us satisfy our stomachs?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cI saw that all of you were extremely hard working today. I\u2019m afraid it was all because you wanted me to cook, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>The shop owners smiled, \u201cLittle Boss, since you already know the answer, you don\u2019t have to ask us. Your culinary skills are really amazing. If you were to open a restaurant, it would definitely be the most famous one in Shanghai.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot just Shanghai. It\u2019ll be the best in the nation. You\u2019ll forget all your troubles after eating his dishes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Liang interrupted, \u201cCan you guys be more courageous? It\u2019ll be the best in the world. Do you remember the 1998 Sichuan spicy sauce? Even that mesmerized the foreigners here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, it was just sticky chili bean sauce with some added sugar. With Little Boss\u2019 abilities, he\u2019ll be internationally renown.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan quickly stopped them from praising him, \u201cAlright, alright. It\u2019s just cooking some dishes for you. No problem. Is there really a need to praise me so much? However, there are a lot of people here. I\u2019m a little tired so I\u2019ll only cook a table of food.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although he had law-defying culinary skills, he hadn\u2019t cooked in a long time and he wanted to satisfy their needs.</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan went to the kitchen, the shop owners gasped.</p><br/><p>\u201cI wonder which girl would be lucky enough to be with Little Boss.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, who would leave Little Boss? He has such impressive culinary skills.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI think Wu You Lan has the luck.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan blushed, \u201cDon\u2019t say that. That\u2019s not true.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLook, she\u2019s blushing. But You Lan, Little Boss is really decent. If you don\u2019t hold onto him, you\u2019ll regret in the future,\u201d everyone chuckled.</p><br/><p>Although Wu You Lan didn\u2019t reply, she listened to their advice. She had to work hard for it. If not, the opportunity would slip away.</p><br/><p>Wu Tian He sighed. He had finally secured his daughter\u2019s life. However, he knew that his daughter was going to be in a love triangle. It wasn\u2019t going to be a smooth journey.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t want to interfere with it as his daughter deserved to live her own life.</p><br/><p>After a while, Lin Fan brought out a few dishes.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s here, it\u2019s here to fulfill your requests. You guys are too much. I can\u2019t cook so many dishes,\u201d Lin Fan chuckled. He just wanted everyone to be happy.</p><br/><p>The crowd smiled, \u201cLittle Boss is awesome.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI finally get to try Little Boss\u2019 food again. I didn\u2019t live in vain.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Until 2 pm in the afternoon.</p><br/><p>Everyone packed their things and were prepared to return to Cloud Street. Lin Fan was going to stay at the welfare organization and teach the children.</p><br/><p>Drawing wasn\u2019t just a small part of their lives. The competition was just for the kids to see the world. He didn\u2019t really care if they won any awards.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>At the Youth Chinese Arts Cup.</p><br/><p>The competition had ended and the judges were preparing themselves.</p><br/><p>There were five judges and they were going to shortlist artworks to be judged by another panel of judges.</p><br/><p>The judges were experienced Chinese Artists. If they weren\u2019t experienced, they wouldn\u2019t have dared to be judges.</p><br/><p>In a large basketball court, the tables were filled with artworks.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, looking at these children\u2019s arts are really torturous.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t say that. Chinese Arts is a national treasure. It\u2019s a good thing for the older generations to like it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLook, this drawing looks like a scribble. What is he trying to draw? It\u2019s too messy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is not good too. It\u2019s literally children\u2019s drawing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, this is pretty good. It\u2019s a pass.\u201d</p><br/><p>The other workers were following the judges and they would seal up the artworks when the judges said that they were good.</p><br/><p>\u201cFail.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAverage, fail.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is decent. I didn\u2019t expect to see a good one after only a few pieces.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is decent too. Looks like he was serious about learning it. Although his strokes aren\u2019t as crisp and firm as adults, it is really decent.\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

He wanted to see just who this guy could call over.</p><br/><p>Cloud Street!</p><br/><p>Elder Zhang said, \u201cEveryone, I have an important notice. Little Boss is calling us to go attend an opening ceremony. Food and drinks are all included and it\u2019s a high-end hotel.\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Liang said, \u201cLittle Boss is finally thinking about us. He actually thinks about us when there\u2019s something so good.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCheh. You say it as if Little Boss is very stingy. When has Little Boss ever not thought about us?\u201d</p><br/><p>When Fraud Tian heard about this, he immediately made a move.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s everyone still waiting for? Hurry up and go!\u201d</p><br/><p>He was in a beautiful mood. He had never expected that kid to have some conscience, to remember them when there\u2019s something so good. All his previous discontentment instantly vanished.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo we need red packets if we\u2019re attending an opening ceremony?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Boss said that there\u2019s no need. As long as we go, it\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s really great.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Dongyue Entertainment Hotel.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was all smiles. He waved his phone as he said, \u201cI\u2019ve called people over already. For your hotel opening to be so lifeless is really pitiful. But when they come, they will have their expectations. Your food and drinks have to be up to standard.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Xu chuckled, \u201cHow could I possibly not have enough to eat here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Xu stayed silent as he stood at the side. He wanted to see just what kind of people would come. According to what he saw, this kid had a pretty good car and he seemed to have some money. The mysterious feeling that he was getting didn\u2019t feel right. It was hard to say if he would be embarrassed by this kid. Naturally, he had to see just who that kid had called.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Lin.\u201d Just as everyone was waiting, a female voice came from afar.</p><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue had been very busy lately. She hadn\u2019t visited Shanghai the whole time. This time, she came to Shanghai mainly because she had taken up this activity. Initially, she had planned to go to Cloud Street but this trip was really too hurried. She had no choice but to wait until the activity ended before going to Cloud Street to look for Brother Lin.</p><br/><p>When Wu You Lan heard that voice, her expression changed. Her strong competitor was here.</p><br/><p>Very soon, a very lively silhouette appeared in front of Lin Fan. Because she was now a public figure, she had to be a little more careful, so she was wearing a mask. Anyone not too familiar with her wouldn\u2019t have been able to recognize her.</p><br/><p>Chief Xu saw that someone had come. Although he couldn\u2019t see her whole face, her pupils gave off a quick-witted feel. She seemed like a beautiful lady. Of course, he didn\u2019t think that she was a celebrity.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled, \u201cHuan Yue, you haven\u2019t come to see me lately. It can\u2019t be that because you\u2019re famous now, you don\u2019t know me anymore, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>This was just a joke but it made Wu Huan Yue panic.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t\u2026\u201d Wu Huan Yue anxiously tried to explain herself. \u201cI didn\u2019t forget you, I have always been wanting to come and visit Brother Lin but I haven\u2019t been in Shanghai at all. I\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>As she spoke, Wu Huan Yue was almost to the point of tears. What she was most afraid of was for Brother Lin to become unfamiliar with her after being apart for so long. When she had heard what he said, how could she have kept her cool?</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan had always treated Wu Huan Yue as her strongest fellow competitor but at that moment, Wu Huan Yue had been made to cry by a single sentence from Lin Fan. Wu You Lan said in a displeased tone, \u201cBrother Lin, you\u2019re being too mean\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan hadn\u2019t expected things to turn out like this. He hurriedly comforted her, \u201cHuan Yue, I was joking. Why did you take it so seriously? You have to control yourself, you aren\u2019t an average person anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue said, \u201cBrother Lin, I really didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan patted Wu Huan Yue on the head and said, \u201cI know. I was just joking just now. Why do you get nervous so easily, you little girl?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Xu was starting to get displeased. Just what was this kid\u2019s background. Something didn\u2019t seem quite right about this situation. She could understand that little lady beside him but what was up with that little lady with the mask? Although he couldn\u2019t see her whole face, just by seeing her slim and tall physique and her eyes, he could tell that he was definitely a beautiful lady.</p><br/><p>F*ck!</p><br/><p>How could young guys these days be so well-liked by beautiful ladies?</p><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue said, \u201cBrother Lin, you\u2019re so mean!\u201d</p><br/><p>When she said \u2018you\u2019re so mean\u2019, Lin Fan\u2019s heart softened and he couldn\u2019t quite take it. It seemed that this little girl had become more mature after mixing around in the entertainment circle.</p><br/><p>However, doing anything immoral with her was definitely not possible. Would Wang Ming Yang dare to let someone do that with Wu Huan Yue? Lin Fan didn\u2019t even have to think. He knew that it was completely impossible.</p><br/><p>At that moment, car after car stopped at the entrance of the hotel.</p><br/><p>These cars were all worth around two or three hundred thousand. To normal people, they were pretty good but to a wealthy man like Chief Xu, they were simply unpresentable.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Boss\u2026we\u2019re here.\u201d Elder Zhang was the first to get off the car. He waved at them.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled and said, \u201cThe people I called are here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Xu turned around and took a close look. He couldn\u2019t help but burst into laughter with a \u2018pfft\u2019 sound. \u201cKid, these are the people you called?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded, \u201cWhat is it? Is there an issue?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Xu laughed, \u201cNo, there\u2019s no issue at all.\u201d</p><br/><p>He was about to laugh to death. He had never thought that these would be the people that the kid called. Looking at the cars and looking at the way they dressed, these people were definitely not influential people.</p><br/><p>He could randomly pick a guest at his opening ceremony and that guest would completely overwhelm these guys.</p><br/><p>\u201cChief Liu, how about this? If you\u2019re interested, you can come over to my side to take a look,\u201d said Chief Xu. He didn\u2019t want to stay here any longer. This was a complete joke.</p><br/><p>Liu Xu glared at Lin Fan. She had expected this guy to call some reliable people over. She had never expected him to call his Cloud Street neighbors over.</p><br/><p>He wasn\u2019t helping her at all. They were clearly here just to eat and drink.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan greeted the guests, \u201cYou guys came really quickly. Today is Chief Liu\u2019s opening ceremony. Everyone, congratulate her. I\u2019ve talked to Chief Liu, today\u2019s food, drinks, and entertainment will all be covered by her. Play to your hearts\u2019 content!\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Zhang said, \u201cCongratulations, Chief Liu!\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian said, \u201cThis hotel is really beautiful. For Chief Liu to be so capable at such a young age, it is really shocking.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCongratulations.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI wish for your business to prosper!\u201d</p><br/><p>There weren\u2019t a lot of people from Cloud Street but there were still several hundred. When they came all at once, Liu Xu\u2019s jaw dropped.</p><br/><p>Although she had kept her cool the whole time, she couldn\u2019t take it anymore. Then, she glared menacingly at Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>This sh*tty Godly Doctor. She had initially thought that he was here to help her out of her embarrassment. She had never thought that he was here to f*ck her up.</p><br/><p>Wang Xin, who was standing at the side, was dumbfounded. She asked weakly, \u201cChief Liu, what do we do?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said peculiarly, \u201cChief Liu, you won\u2019t go back on your word, right? If this isn\u2019t alright, I can pay for this myself.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Xu took a deep breath, then waved her hand. \u201cLater on, bring everyone in and take good care of them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Xin nodded, \u201cYes, Chief Liu.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Liu said quietly, \u201cYou\u2019re heartless.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled calmly, \u201cThe feeling is mutual.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, a man walked over from afar.</p><br/><p>\u201cChief Xu, why did you leave during the opening ceremony? Everyone is waiting for you,\u201d said Jin Yun Min with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cChief Liu, this is Chief Jin, my good friend.\u201d Then, Xu Ming greeted Jin Yun Min, \u201cChief Jin, I\u2019ll be there in a bit.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jin Yun Min said with a smile, \u201cChief Xu, today is your opening ceremony. If you aren\u2019t there, it would be meaningless. Hey\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey!\u201d Lin Fan\u2019s and Jin Yun Min\u2019s eyes met.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cChief Jin.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two of them were surprised. They had never expected to see each other here.</p><br/><p>And as they were in astonishment, Chief Xu was stunned as well. What was going on? Did these two know each other?</p></div>\n</div>"}

There was a joss stick urn erected in the middle of the plaza of the Taoist temple, with white smoke emitting from the inside. It showed significance.</p><br/><p>Many tourists who came here seemed to be very calm. There were no quarrels between the male and female. They seemed very sincere.</p><br/><p>There were Taoist priests bringing them around the place.</p><br/><p>However, Lin Fan\u2019s reason for coming here was simple. He wanted to get to know the \u2018Silent Priest\u2019. If he could befriend him, that would be best.</p><br/><p>Very quickly, Lin Fan saw a Taoist priest. He asked, \u201cMay I ask, is the Silent Priest around?\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-2\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>The Taoist priest looked at this young man and whispered, \u201cThe Master is currently receiving a visitor.\u201d</p><br/><p>From what he could see, everyone who came here wanted to pay the Master a visit. After which, he didn\u2019t say anything else. He bowed towards Lin Fan and took his leave.</p><br/><p>\u201cSeems like I\u2019ll have to find him myself.\u201d Since he had already come here, he naturally still had to respect their culture. He still had to walk their path. However, he still had to fulfill his motive for coming here or else it\u2019d be a waste to have come all the way here. He would not have reaped any rewards from it.</p><br/><p>At this moment, in the back of the main hall of the temple, the \u2018Silent Priest\u2019 was currently taking the pulse of a man. Thereafter, he gently nodded his head, picked up a pen and started writing down the prescription. He passed it over to the man.</p><br/><p>The man knew that the \u2018Silent Priest\u2019 never spoke a word, but he was still extremely grateful. He took out a red packet from his bag and handed it over to him.</p><br/><p>The \u2018Silent Priest\u2019 opened the red packet and took out a single hundred dollar note. He handed the rest of it back to the man.</p><br/><p>One\u2019s medical prowess shouldn\u2019t be \u2018bought\u2019, but rather, be shared.</p><br/><p>In this case, the \u2018Silent Priest\u2019 randomly drew a note from the red packet to use it to maintain the existence of the Taoist temple.</p><br/><p>The man carried his prescription and bowed towards the \u2018Silent Priest\u2019. After which, he followed a Taoist priest and left the place.</p><br/><p>The \u2018Silent Priest\u2019 was said to be very godly. Even though he was already over seventy years old, his spirits were still very high. Compared to a young person, his health was definitely much better.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-3\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Previously, the townsfolk at the bottom of the mountain was very poor, but when the \u2018Silent Priest\u2019 came, he gradually spurred them on. The number of visitors that came here each year was exceptional.</p><br/><p>Most of them came here to visit the \u2018Silent Priest\u2019, but a minority of them just chose to take a look around to see what so holy about this place.</p><br/><p>When this visitor left, the \u2018Silent Priest\u2019 was preparing to go out and take a look.</p><br/><p>Suddenly!</p><br/><p>A young man appeared in front of the \u2018Silent Priest\u2019.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan casually strolled a complete circle and arrived here.</p><br/><p>In that instant, the two of them locked gazes with each other. The \u2018Silent Priest\u2019 originally had a calm expression, but gradually, traces of doubt could be seen on his face.</p><br/><p>On the other hand, Lin Fan broke into a smile, \u201cHello, \u2018Silent Priest\u2019. Sorry for disturbing you.\u201d</p><br/><p>The \u2018Silent Priest\u2019 stretched out his hand to indicate for him to take a seat. From what he could see, this young man in front of him wasn\u2019t ordinary, but yet he couldn\u2019t put a finger on it.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan merely took one look at the \u2018Silent Priest\u2019 and felt that this priest wasn\u2019t an ordinary one. He had some true abilities.</p><br/><p>It seemed like he found the correct person.</p><br/><p>The entire scene was very quiet.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-4\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>The \u2018Silent Priest\u2019 did not speak at all. However, Lin Fan didn\u2019t know how to open his first sentence. He thought about it carefully before having an idea.</p><br/><p>He said with a deadpan expression, \u201c\u2018Silent Priest\u2019 friend, by my calculations, I realized that you and I have a predestined fate, hence, I came all the way here from Shanghai to chat with you. I\u2019m going to stay here for a period of time. What do you say?\u201d</p><br/><p>Although the \u2018Silent Priest\u2019 didn\u2019t speak, when he heard Lin Fan\u2019s words, his fingers froze in place. It was as if he was caught unprepared and couldn\u2019t react in time.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan didn\u2019t think about how thick his skin was. In order to expand his social circle, he had to be thick-skinned.</p><br/><p>Ever since he took Zhao Ming Qing in as a discipline, Lin Fan\u2019s interaction with the elderly became rather natural. There wasn\u2019t anything awkward between them.</p><br/><p>However, to the \u2018Silent Priest\u2019, he saw that his young man was out of the ordinary, but he didn\u2019t expect that the other party would say such words.</p><br/><p>Predestined fate?</p><br/><p>Why didn\u2019t I see this myself?</p><br/><p>However, his skills acquired through religious practices were profound. He smiled and nodded his head, agreeing to his request.</p><br/><p>But Lin Fan\u2019s goal was to become good friends with the other party during this duration.</p><br/><p>At this moment, a Taoist priest came over and was stunned when he saw Lin Fan. He didn\u2019t even know how this stranger got here.</p><br/><p>But when he was about to open his mouth to say something, the \u2018Silent Priest\u2019 stretched out his hand, as if trying to signify something. However, the priest understood him and went in front of Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Master requests for me to bring you to your room. Please follow me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh!\u201d Lin Fan was stunned.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-5\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>What room? I haven\u2019t even finished my conversation with you, so why are you chasing me away?</p><br/><p>However, when he thought about it, he still had quite a long period of time. He decided not to rush into things and to take things easy. He believed that he would be able to befriend him in this duration.</p><br/><p>When this priest brought Lin Fan away, the \u2018Silent Priest\u2019 displayed signs of suspicion, as if he couldn\u2019t quite understand the situation.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The next day.</p><br/><p>No one was paying attention to what Lin Fan was doing.</p><br/><p>But yet on the Internet, there was an uproar on the news from the day before.</p><br/><p>Originally, the reporters wanted to express their pity for the child who was diagnosed with leukemia, as well as to appeal for the help of benevolent people.</p><br/><p>But was shocked by the events at the hospital.</p><br/><p>The child who diagnosed with leukemia had unexpectedly recovered! Furthermore, it was all because of just one pill.</p><br/><p>From their views, this was unbelievable.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe child who was diagnosed with leukemia was instantly cured by a miracle pill.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWorld miracle! Unbelievable!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA mystery person gave his brother a pill. Then, his brother came from thousands of miles away to deliver the pill.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Whenever such a news appeared, the netizens would always be stunned.</p><br/><p>They didn\u2019t know what happened to the news media and felt that they must be ret*arded.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck! Are the editor\u2019s brain filled with sh*t? How could they report such a fake news?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c^ Take a look personally before you speak.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, my mother. It this for real?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHis brother couldn\u2019t have met a fairy, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA pill that can cure leukemia. This is just too fake. It\u2019s simply unbelievable!\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone was discussing this matter, and in an instant, it jumped to the Weibo headlines.</p><br/><p>And at the same time, many news companies from all over the country flocked to the hospital. They wanted to get evidence to see if this was real or fake.</p><br/><p>However, in Shanghai.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing was flabbergasted when he read the news. However, after thinking about it, he felt that this had something to do with his teacher.</p><br/><p>In his view, the only person that could do such a thing was his teacher.</p><br/><p>Especially when it only required a pill.</p><br/><p>And in his heart, he had already believed it to 90 percent.</p></div>\n</div>"}

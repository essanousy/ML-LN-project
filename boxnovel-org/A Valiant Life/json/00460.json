They thought that this fella was joking. However, they saw that Director Zhao was talking to him so nicely as if he was talking to a senior. He looked like he was eager for more knowledge.</p><br/><p>Their journey was smooth and safe. Nothing much happened.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing had a lot of queries and he had been asking a lot of questions. Lin Fan just answered them completely.</p><br/><p>Qiu Jie and Zhang Tong Tong were listening attentively and they realized that the conversation between this young man and Director Zhao was a little too profound for them.</p><br/><p>Qiu Jie tried to remember what they were talking about. Although he didn\u2019t understand it, at least it could help him expand his horizons.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the two of them and smiled, \u201cYou guys can just ignore this. It\u2019s not something you can understand now, it\u2019s not beneficial for you to think about so many things.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qiu Jie and Zhang Tong Tong looked at Lin Fan and lowered their heads, \u201cAre you really Director Zhang\u2019s mentor?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan didn\u2019t reply them. Zhao Ming Qing replied, \u201cHe is my mentor. This time, you guys have to give your 100%. It will definitely help to improve your medical skills.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d Qiu Jie and Zhang Tong Tong nodded. It was as if they had discovered a big secret. At the same time, they felt a little confused. They wondered how good Lin Fan\u2019s medical skills were, to be able to mentor Director Zhao.</p><br/><p>They knew Director Zhao was from the Chinese Medicinal Association. Their research on Chinese medicine was the best. There were a lot of people that went there to seek treatment. They initially wanted to gain Director Zhao\u2019s favor and become his disciple to learn more about Chinese medicine. To them, it was like the best thing that could ever happen to them. Now that they\u2019ve met Director Zhao\u2019s teacher, they were shocked that he was a young man. However, they knew that this man definitely had insane medical skills. If not, Director Zhao wouldn\u2019t have asked him to be his mentor.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, where shall we go after we reach Jiangning?</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled, \u201cIt\u2019s a city, where do you think will be the place with the most patients?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing smiled, \u201cIt would definitely be the hospital.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded, \u201cLet\u2019s go to the hospital entrance then. The two of you can search the Internet to see where are the biggest hospitals in every district and place in Jiangning. We can go to a different one every day.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qiu Jie and Zhang Tong Tong nodded, \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing said worriedly, \u201cTeacher, if we were to go to the hospital entrance, would it be okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t it be okay? We aren\u2019t affiliated with the hospital but there isn\u2019t a rule that states that we can\u2019t practice Chinese medicine voluntarily at the entrance,\u201d Lin Fan replied.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing thought about it for a moment and felt that it was somewhat true. They were doing voluntary treatment and it would be the same wherever they went. Furthermore, it wasn\u2019t like the hospital had said anything about it.</p><br/><p>He looked at his mentor and it was as if he had understood something.</p><br/><p>Qiu Jie and Zhang Tong Tong were excited from thinking about treating people at the entrance of a hospital.</p><br/><p>However, when they reached Jiangning, it was already nighttime.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s find a place to stay first. Lil\u2019 Jie, did you find a place yet? Where are the relatively bigger hospitals nearby?\u201d Lin Fan asked.</p><br/><p>Qiu Jie had already chosen a place on his phone, \u201cTeacher Lin, Jiangning Citizen\u2019s Hospital is nearby. It is one of the biggest hospitals in Jiangning.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, let\u2019s go there then. Have a good rest tonight. We will head there tomorrow,\u201d Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright!\u201d Qiu Jie and Zhang Tong Tong answered ecstatically.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing was a little helpless. Since his mentor wanted to act so crazily, he had to follow through with it. It was the first time treating patients for free at the entrance of a hospital.</p><br/><p>The next day!</p><br/><p>At Jiangning Citizen\u2019s Hospital.</p><br/><p>There was a big bus parked outside.</p><br/><p>The patients who were at the hospital for treatment looked at them out of curiosity. They wondered why there was a need for a bus.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan alighted and looked at the situation there. The hospital might really be the place with the most people. Some of them were carried into the hospital on stretchers and exited the hospital by walking out and vice versa.</p><br/><p>Qiu Jie and Zhang Tong Tong started to shift tables and some equipment.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan pointed at the side, \u201cLet\u2019s move it there. We shouldn\u2019t block the entrance of the hospital.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, Teacher Lin.\u201d Qiu Jie nodded and started to move there.</p><br/><p>He had been ecstatic the whole night and he couldn\u2019t sleep.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe weather is decent, it\u2019s not too hot.\u201d Lin Fan looked at the weather and nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, what are you guys doing?\u201d Then, the hospital\u2019s security came.</p><br/><p>\u201cVoluntary medical treatment,\u201d Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>The security guard was stunned. \u201cWhat did you say? You\u2019re giving voluntary treatment at the entrance of a hospital?\u201d</p><br/><p>The security guard was amused by what he said. Who would have thought of an idea like this?</p><br/><p>\u201cIs there a problem?\u201d Lin Fan smiled and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not allowed to stay here, please go somewhere else,\u201d the security guard said.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled, \u201cWhy can\u2019t we stay here? I don\u2019t think the road belongs to the hospital. Furthermore, we\u2019re just doing voluntary medical work here. Is it illegal?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe hospital can treat its patients. We\u2019re here to give free treatment to people. We won\u2019t be charging any fees. Is the hospital afraid of losing business?\u201d Lin Fan added.</p><br/><p>The security guard furrowed his brows. \u201cWhat do you mean by that? The hospital is for people to seek treatment. When did it become a business? Alright then, just continue with what you\u2019re doing. I want to see how long you guys can last for. People are smarter nowadays, they wouldn\u2019t fall for your tricks.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d Lin Fan smiled. Since he was allowed to stay there, he didn\u2019t have any more questions and didn\u2019t want to bother about this security guard anymore.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, Lin Fan didn\u2019t want to argue with him since it was his job to maintain security at the hospital.</p><br/><p>The passers-by stopped at stared at them. They wondered what they were doing.</p><br/><p>Everything was prepared. Lin Fan sat there and waited patiently.</p><br/><p>The security guard looked at them and shook his head. It was such a joke to be doing voluntary medical work outside a hospital. Who would even approach them?</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t want to think about it anymore.</p><br/><p>Initially, Qiu Jie and Zhang Tong Tong didn\u2019t bother about it but as time passed, they realized that nobody approached them. They started to get anxious.</p><br/><p>\u201cDirector, it seems like nobody is coming here,\u201d Qiu Jie said.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing nodded, \u201cBe patient.\u201d</p><br/><p>Since the director said that, what else could they have said? They could only sit there and wait.</p><br/><p>There were a lot of people that looked at them but there weren\u2019t any who came and asked for help.</p><br/><p>Then, an old lady came forward. After looking at them for a moment, she asked, \u201cAre you doing voluntary medical work?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Qiu Jie replied immediately. She was their first patient and he had to welcome her warmly.</p><br/><p>\u201cI would like to have my blood pressure measured,\u201d the old lady said.</p><br/><p>Qiu Jie was stunned. Then, he replied awkwardly, \u201cSorry, we don\u2019t measure blood pressure here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t even measure blood pressure, what do you do here?\u201d The old lady didn\u2019t seem very happy.</p><br/><p>Qiu Jie replied, \u201cAuntie, we\u2019re here to treat patients and we\u2019re Chinese medical doctors.\u201d</p><br/><p>The old lady shook her head, \u201cThe hospital is just here. Patients would definitely go to the hospital. Why would they come here? It\u2019s a joke.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, the old lady left.</p><br/><p>Qiu Jiu looked at Director Zhao and Master Lin helplessly. The situation seemed a little off.</p><br/><p>However, Lin Fan wasn\u2019t really waiting for these people. He was waiting for those that really needed help.</p></div>\n</div>"}

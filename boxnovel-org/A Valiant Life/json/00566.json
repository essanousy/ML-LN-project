It\u2019s really great.\u201d Lin Fan smiled. The massage was really pretty good. In future, getting Wu You Lan to give him a massage every day would not be a bad idea.</p><br/><p>After hearing Brother Lin\u2019s compliment, Wu You Lan smiled even more happily. Especially when she thought about how her enemy, Wu Huan Yue, hadn\u2019t appeared for a while now, she felt that she was on the verge of victory.</p><br/><p>What was good about being a celebrity? Wu Huan Yue was busy every day and even when she called, Wu You Lan didn\u2019t feel any pressure because Brother Lin didn\u2019t express anything to her.</p><br/><p>*Ring ring*</p><br/><p>At that moment, Lin Fan\u2019s phone rang.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, whose number is this?\u201d Lin Fan saw that it was an unknown caller and was a little curious. The number was from Beijing. But he didn\u2019t record this number and it seemed that it wasn\u2019t anyone he knew.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello, who is this?\u201d Lin Fan answered the call and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin\u2026\u201d a female voice emanated through the phone. But following that was the sound of weeping.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan\u2019s brows furrowed slightly. \u201cMay I know who you are?\u201d</p><br/><p>This was a little strange. He didn\u2019t even know that person. Why was she crying when he answered the call? Lin Fan couldn\u2019t figure it out.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, I\u2019m Chen Yun Yi.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cChen Yun Yi?\u201d Lin Fan was a little confused. He felt that this name was a little familiar but he couldn\u2019t recall who it was. However, he still felt as if he definitely knew this person.</p><br/><p>Chen Yun Yi said, \u201cMaster Lin, I was the person on Weibo who asked you about luck last time. We\u2019ve chatted on Weibo before.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh!\u201d At that moment, Lin Fan recalled. \u201cWhy are you crying? Did you come across some incident?\u201d</p><br/><p>They weren\u2019t very close and they had only interacted briefly several months ago but if this person really wanted some help from him, he had to see what was going on. After all, he couldn\u2019t just fully commit to helping someone he wasn\u2019t even close to.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, I want to request for your help. We acted in Teacher Tao\u2019s TV show. After it finished, Luo Dan and I joined a company. Afterward, we took some small jobs but today, I found out that our company\u2019s leader wants Luo Dan and I to escort several important people. Luo Dan and I have been locked up in the hotel. This phone was sneaked in for us by our manager. Luo Dan and I are both from humble places. We don\u2019t have friends and relatives here and we don\u2019t know any important people either. I can only ask you to help us\u2026\u201d Through her weeping, she described the whole situation to Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan asked, \u201cWhere are you now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Yun Yi said softly, \u201cLuo Dan and I are at Shanghai Chang Tian Road, Hilton Hotel, unit 1504. Someone is coming. Master Lin, I\u2019m begging you, please save us.\u201d</p><br/><p>The next moment, the phone was hung up.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the phone and felt helpless. He never expected something like this to happen.</p><br/><p>He wasn\u2019t very familiar with Chen Yun Yi but she had actively called him to ask for help. If he didn\u2019t help her, he wouldn\u2019t be able to face himself.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan asked, \u201cBrother Lin, what happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan described the situation to Wu You Lan. Wu You Lan was silent for a moment before she said, \u201cBrother Lin, I think you should go. Although you aren\u2019t familiar with her, she has trusted you and placed her last hopes on you. Moreover, you know that this is definitely not anything good. If you know about it but don\u2019t help, and something really does happen, you wouldn\u2019t feel at peace with yourself.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMmm, you\u2019re right. That was what I was thinking too,\u201d said Lin Fan with a smile. Then, he stood up. \u201cAlright, you guys stay in the shop. I\u2019ll go take a look. Regardless of what kind of important people they are, if I, Master Lin, personally makes an appearance, they won\u2019t be able to do anything!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPfft,\u201d Wu You Lan burst into laughter, \u201cBrother Lin, you really wouldn\u2019t be my good Brother Lin if you didn\u2019t act so cocky. Hurry up and go then. If you\u2019re late, something bad might happen.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked up at the sky. \u201cLook, the weather is great, nothing bad will happen. Who would do such a thing under the great white sky? However, nothing is for certain. Who knows what might happen? I\u2019m going to go take a look.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAll the best!\u201d Wu You Lan cheered him on.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled. This was really just a small matter. Since they were in the entertainment business, something like this was bound to happen. However, she had actively looked for him for help and he liked to meddle with other people\u2019s businesses as well. If he didn\u2019t go, he wouldn\u2019t be able to face himself.</p><br/><p>Hilton Hotel.</p><br/><p>Chen Yun Yi and Luo Dan were locked up in a hotel room. At that moment, both of them had timidness and fear on their faces.</p><br/><p>\u201cYun Yi, what should we do?\u201d asked Luo Dan fearfully.</p><br/><p>Chen Yun Yi was out of her wits as well. \u201cI just called Master Lin. He\u2019ll help us.\u201d</p><br/><p>Luo Dan said unbelievingly, \u201cWe aren\u2019t even close to Master Lin. What reason does he have to help us? Furthermore, it seems like the people who are coming have very high status. The boss told us to obey, otherwise, we would have to face the consequences.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Yun Yi shook her head, \u201cNo, no matter who it is, I won\u2019t agree to it. We have to leave this place.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut outside\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t finish her sentence.</p><br/><p>The room door was opened.</p><br/><p>The two of them were startled. They looked at the entrance watchfully.</p><br/><p>Chen Yun Yi saw their boss and pleaded, \u201cBoss, I beg you to let us go. I don\u2019t want to accompany them.\u201d</p><br/><p>They had joined the Cloudy Sky Entertainment Company. The boss, He Ming Hui, looked at the two of them and said sternly, \u201cDon\u2019t talk about this anymore. You have to accompany them. They\u2019re all important people. Don\u2019t say that I didn\u2019t warn you. You can\u2019t afford to offend them. Even I can\u2019t afford it.\u201d Then, he said gently, \u201cYun Yi, Luo Dan, you\u2019ve both entered this industry so you should know that in this industry, you either have to have the money or some form of backing. But you two don\u2019t have either of those. Listen to me, just treat it as being possessed. When you became famous in future, who would care about such a thing?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Yun Yi shook her head, \u201cBoss, can we not do this?\u201d</p><br/><p>He Hui Ming said, \u201cNot do this? Do you treat this as a vegetable market? Do you think you can do as you like? Let me tell you that you\u2019ve signed your consent. Everything the company arranges, you have to follow unconditionally. If you break the contract, you\u2019ll have to pay a huge sum. Where will you two little girls get that money?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou go talk to them. I have to go and receive the guests,\u201d said He Hui Ming.</p><br/><p>The crowd left.</p><br/><p>Only the manager remained.</p><br/><p>\u201cSister Liu, please help us out,\u201d said Chen Yun Yi tearfully.</p><br/><p>\u201cSigh.\u201d Sister Liu shook her head. \u201cIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want to help but I am powerless. You have to know that neither of you can get out of this rut. To charge into this entertainment industry without any power or authority, you should\u2019ve made these kinds of choices. Moreover, you have to know the purpose of entering this industry. It\u2019s to become famous. If you want to become famous, you need to let go. Look at all those famous superstars nowadays. Which one of them hasn\u2019t experienced such things? But where are they now? They\u2019ve changed completely and managed to climb the social ladder.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Yun Yi and Luo Dan both looked down quietly. They would usually joke around about such a thing but they never expected it to happen to themselves. They were really helpless.</p><br/><p>Sister Liu comforted them, \u201cAlright, don\u2019t be like that. Sometimes, getting someone that can back you is not a bad thing. We\u2019re all women and this will eventually happen to us, it\u2019s just a matter of who it is. Isn\u2019t that right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Yun Yi and Luo Dan looked up at Sister Liu. They never thought that Sister Liu would have such thoughts.</p><br/><p>Terrifying. It was really terrifying.</p></div>\n</div>"}

Zhao Zhong Yang had nothing to do every day and so, he had been waking up late.</p><br/><p>*Ding ding!*</p><br/><p>\"Who is it? Who's calling me at such an early hour?\" Zhao Zong Yang said. But when he picked up the phone, Lin Fan was extremely excited.</p><br/><p>\"Quick, come over to my house. I want to have a new programme,\" Lin Fan said excitedly. Yesterday's incident had allowed him to think of a good way to complete the seventh knowledge page.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan had been contemplating if he should really go to Macau to gamble so that others would be in awe of him. But he realized that it was a little stupid. If he went there and won other people's money, who would even worship him? That would be so stupid.</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang replied, \"Master Lin, it's so early. What plans do you have?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled, \"Broadcasting! I would like to use your broadcasting channel.\"</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang was stunned. He hadn't expected Master Lin to initiate a broadcast. Then, he looked at the time and it was only 8 am. \"Boss, it's too early for a broadcast. It's only 8 am now. Everyone's still sleeping. Nobody would watch it. Why not start it in the afternoon? That's when there will be the most people.\"</p><br/><p>Soon, his excitement died down.</p><br/><p>\"Alright\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang was helpless. He felt that it was bad to dismiss Master Lin's request as he had sounded so excited over the phone. Then, he said, \"I will be there soon. There should be some people at 8 am.\"</p><br/><p>Then, Lin Fan sounded excited again. \"Alright! I'll wait for you at my house. Please come here soon!\"</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang didn't even know what Master Lin wanted to broadcast but he was a little curious. Then, he went to wash up and left for Master Lin's house.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>In the house.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was looking for clothes. This time, the broadcast had to be serious and he had to dress up for it. He adjusted the house's air-conditioner to make it colder and wore a tuxedo. He also used wax to style his hair backward and wore a pair of sunglasses. He looked at himself in the mirror and thought he looked as good as the God of Gambling.</p><br/><p>Then, he found two decks of cards from his drawer.</p><br/><p>\"Today, I shall showcase my true skills.\"</p><br/><p>Ever since he had attained the knowledge of gambling, he tried to shuffle the cards for the first time.</p><br/><p>When he touched the cards, his hands didn't even feel like his own hands.</p><br/><p>*shuffle*</p><br/><p>The sound of the poker cards rustling filled the house. The two decks of cards surrounded Lin Fan. If it was seen by anybody, they'd definitely be shocked. They would probably go on to say 'What the f*ck!' His house would've been thought to be haunted. How could anyone shuffle cards in a special way like this?</p><br/><p>His fingers were as smooth as flowing water. It was like a work of art. His hands moved around and held onto the two decks of cards. Then, he spread the cards on the table. The two decks that had previously been mixed together were now separated.</p><br/><p>\"How awesome,\" Lin Fan said as he smiled. This type of skill was law-defying. If not for the power of the Encyclopedia, it'd only have been a dream to possess such skills.</p><br/><p>He placed a card in between two fingers and he gently waved his hand. The card flew up and back into his hand after making a 180-degree turn.</p><br/><p>\"How awesome!\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan got even more excited as he continued to play with the cards. The visual effects were astounding.</p><br/><p>However, nobody else was looking at him.</p><br/><p>Even so, he was extremely happy to be playing with the cards.</p><br/><p>*Dong dong!*</p><br/><p>It looked like Zhao Zhong Yang was here.</p><br/><p>When he opened the door, Zhao Zhong Yang still looked a little dazed. He was stunned when he saw Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>\"Master Lin, what are you doing?\" Zhao Zhong Yang asked. Master Lin was in a tuxedo and his hair was shiny from the wax. Furthermore, his sunglasses made him look like he was from a secret society.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed, \"How is it? Do I look good?\"</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang sighed helplessly. If not for his near death experience with cancer, he'd probably be shocked to death by Master Lin. \"Do you want to know the truth?\"</p><br/><p>\"Of course,\" Lin Fan said. He had tried so hard to doll himself up. He obviously wanted to know if he looked good.</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang looked at him. \"Master Lin, I think you should revert back to your old ways. I think your current outfit is horrific. You will definitely regret being on the broadcast dressed like this.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan sighed as he looked at Zhao Zhong Yang. He looked serious about what he had just said. Then, he went to the toilet and changed out of his tuxedo. He also reverted to his usual hairstyle.</p><br/><p>His effort had gone to waste.</p><br/><p>In the shop.</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang asked curiously, \"Master Lin, what do you want to perform? You're so excited.\"</p><br/><p>He was extremely curious. Usually, Master Lin wasn't particularly interested in broadcasting but this time, he had initiated a broadcast early in the morning. It looked as if he was going to announce something joyous.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. \"You'll find out later.\"</p><br/><p>\"You're so mysterious,\" Zhao Zhong Yang said. Then, he looked at the two decks of cards on the table and was stunned. \"Did you ask me here to broadcast a game of 'Fight the Landlord' early in the morning?\"</p><br/><p>\"Am I that crazy? I could be sleeping at this time, why would I ask you to broadcast a game? I will post a notice on Weibo. What's your broadcasting room number? Let me try to get more people to watch,\" Lin Fan said happily.</p><br/><p>Weibo:</p><br/><p>\"Master Lin will be showcasing some divine skills to get you to stop gambling. He will be revealing a mysterious secret. Please observe 'xx' broadcasting room with the number 'xxxx'. It will be brought to you by the best gambler on earth, Master Lin.\"</p><br/><p>This title was indeed perfect.</p><br/><p>Recently, he hadn't really been in the mood to update his Weibo. Furthermore, there had been nothing special that happened recently. On the Internet, something special must happen in order to attract people.</p><br/><p>If not, why would so many celebrities try so hard to be at the center of attraction? They had to try to make it to the headlines. If they managed to do so, they would then be able to attract more fans.</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang almost vomited blood when he saw the Weibo title. Then, he looked at Lin Fan shockingly. \"Master Lin, are you crazy? Best gambler on earth? When did you learn how to gamble?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled as he thought of what had happened. \"There are a lot of things that you do not know\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang was attracted to the mysterious look in Lin Fan's eyes. He had only one thing on his mind. Master Lin must have had a story to share, if not, he wouldn't have acted so mysteriously.</p><br/><p>\"Alright, let's cut the cr*p. Start the broadcast immediately,\" Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang asked, \"What should I put as the title for the broadcast room?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan thought for a moment and said, \"The undisputed best gambler on the planet, turned into the number one anti-gambling activist.\"</p><br/><p>D*mn!</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang was stunned, \"This title is a little scary, should we change it?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan immediately waved his hand. \"It's okay, just use it.\"</p><br/><p>\"It seems a little too eye-catching,\" Zhao Zhong Yang said.</p><br/><p>\"Haha, it's not eye-catching. I'm just speaking the truth. You can't be too modest when it comes to broadcasting. You have to speak the truth about your own capabilities and use the most eye-catching titles. In the past, wasn't Han Lu a self-proclaimed best MMA fighter? My title is considered normal,\" Lin Fan said calmly.</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang was speechless. He could only continue as instructed by Master Lin.</p><br/><p>The title was set up.</p><br/><p>He immediately started the broadcast.</p><br/><p>There were only a few people that were watching the broadcast at 8 am in the morning.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan neatened his outfit until he felt that it was okay to be seen.</p><br/><p>\"Hey, there are already a thousand people online but why is none of them talking?\" Lin Fan asked curiously.</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang awkwardly replied, \"Don't be impatient. There will be some later. Right now, these are just fake viewers to boost the viewer count.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan curled his lips. \"What the heck\u2026?\"</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang looked stupefied. He wished for a bolt of lightning to strike Master Lin. He was being too straightforward with his words.</p><br/><p>There were very few people online and nobody was saying anything. Lin Fan just sat there and looked at the screen. He wanted to perform only when someone said something.</p><br/><p>After a while, the first person entered the broadcast room.</p><br/><p>\"Hey, Brother Yang, you're broadcasting at such an early hour today.\"</p><br/><p>\"No, it's Master Lin. Brother Yang went home yesterday, why would he appear beside Master Lin? Could it\u2026 Could it be\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"Master Lin, we're here. I saw your Weibo. What do you want to do this time?\"</p><br/><p>\"The title was written by Master Lin. What exactly does he want to perform? I've been baited here.\"</p><br/><p>\"D*mn! The title is 666\u2026 It's something I've never seen before.\"</p><br/><p>\"The undisputed best gambler on the planet, Master Lin! He must have run out of people to gamble with.\"</p><br/><p>\"It's my luck to see Master Lin so early in the morning. I will donate a present immediately.\"</p><br/><p>\"D*mn! I spent the whole night gambling and when I just opened up the broadcasting app, Master Lin is talking about quitting gambling. How law-defying!\"</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The number of people in the broadcast continued to rise.</p><br/><p>Master Lin smirked. Then, he gently cleared his throat. \"Hi, everyone. I am Lin Fan, Master Lin. Today, I will be telling you guys the harmful effects of gambling. It's merciless, harmful and even life-threatening.\"</p><br/><p>Suddenly.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan slammed the table and the two decks of cards suddenly flew up. He caught them both with his hands. Then, he took out eight cards from the deck and showed them to the camera.</p><br/><p>\"Eight Aces!\"</p><br/><p>D*mn!</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang was stunned.</p><br/><p>Those netizens that were eating instant noodles immediately spat their noodles out.</p><br/><p>In an instant.</p><br/><p>On the broadcast.</p><br/><p>\"66666\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"How amazing\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"That's crazy\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"Was that magic\u2026?\"</p><br/><p>\"Master Lin is engaging in some dishonest work. He's starting to perform magic on a broadcast\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"F*ck! Am I watching the God of Gambling? Eight Aces?! Where did he buy this trick? I want to buy it too.\"</p><br/><p>The situation in the broadcast left Lin Fan helpless. Everyone didn't believe in him.</p><br/><p>It looked like he had to explain it for it to work.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, this was Lin Fan's first time broadcasting.</p><br/><p>This broadcast would determine whether he would be able to complete the seventh page of knowledge.</p><br/><p>...</p><br/>\n</div>"}

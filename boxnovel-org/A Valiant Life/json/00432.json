The main organizers of the event had already fled. They had been extremely frightened and ran away as quickly as they could.</p><br/><p>The manager was extremely anxious. She kept looking around and when she saw Jin Xuan Ming lying on the floor, she ran over. \u201cXuan Ming, Xuan Ming\u2026\u201d When she saw that his handsome and girly face was disfigured, she was dumbfounded. She quickly called the police.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s over\u2026 It\u2019s over\u2026\u201d After making the call, she collapsed onto the ground. Everything was over. Xuan Ming\u2019s face had become handsome after plastic surgery but his current state was extremely bad. Who knew how long he would need to recover fully? Furthermore, he\u2019d have become a forgotten celebrity after he recovered.</p><br/><p>She knew that there were a lot of brainless fans in China and they could treat you like their own parents when they were your fans. However, they were extremely pragmatic. They only cared about looks and if the celebrity wasn\u2019t good looking anymore, they would switch their attention to another one.</p><br/><p>The manager sat on the floor motionlessly and was in a daze.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>It was a team of five burglars and four of them had already gathered together.</p><br/><p>They were in a certain isolated place.</p><br/><p>The woman that had disguised as a pregnant lady took out something from her abdomen and smiled. \u201cHow was that? My acting skills are superb, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>The man that had disguised as a doctor smiled. \u201cYeah, it was awesome. However, your action shocked all of us. Why didn\u2019t you take Yue Qiu Ju Shi\u2019s artwork instead of this one?\u201d</p><br/><p>The \u2018pregnant lady\u2019 said, \u201cInitially, our target was the \u2018Hundred flowers\u2019 artwork but I heard people say that this artwork could be considered the best of the century. Hence, I went to have a look and this artwork is indeed beautiful. Furthermore, the inscription is unknown but the quality is so much better than the other artwork. You guys can have a look.\u201d</p><br/><p>The other three members nodded and opened up the package. Then, they smiled after looking at it. \u201cIt\u2019s indeed a magnificent drawing.\u201d</p><br/><p>They were all burglars. They had done sufficient research on artworks. This artwork was way better than Yue Qiu Ju Shi\u2019s \u2018Hundred flowers\u2019 artwork.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, why isn\u2019t Lil\u2019 Zhang here yet?\u201d The burglar that had kicked Jin Xuan Ming furrowed his brows. \u201cWhen I left, he was still hiding in the crowd. He should be here by now. Could something have happened to him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot possible. Lil\u2019 Zhang is extremely cautious and he hid in the crowds. He couldn\u2019t have been found out. Hey, look, he\u2019s here,\u201d the man who disguised as the doctor said.</p><br/><p>In the distance.</p><br/><p>A man quickly ran over. When he saw his group of friends, he heaved a sigh of relief. After all, it was normal to find comfort in them.</p><br/><p>\u201cLil\u2019 Zhang, what took you so long?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lil\u2019 Zhang replied, \u201cI didn\u2019t want to be this slow. When I was hiding in the crowd, I realized that the young man who was standing beside Master Yue Qiu was smiling at me. He looked as if he knew what I was up to. I was extremely nervous and so I walked around for a bit longer.\u201d</p><br/><p>They all shook their heads. \u201cThat can\u2019t be, you were probably just hallucinating. How could he have found out about you? Anyway, we did well this time. Let\u2019s contact our old customer and find out the price of this. I think it\u2019s worth a lot more than the other one.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lil\u2019 Zhang nodded. \u201cYeah, I think I was just too nervous. How could anyone have found out about me?\u201d</p><br/><p>The burglars laughed. They thought that they could rest for some time after this heist.</p><br/><p>There were a lot of good things in the world but they couldn\u2019t steal some of them as the risk involved was too high. This type of art exhibitions was the easiest to steal from. The security measures weren\u2019t good and they could do it just by planning ahead.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, a voice came and they were all stunned.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t nervous for nothing. I really knew that it was you.\u201d</p><br/><p>The crowd was stunned when they heard it. They looked around and saw a man walking towards them. It was someone that they didn\u2019t recognize. However, Lil\u2019 zhang realized who he was and he gasped, \u201cIt\u2019s him! He\u2019s the one who smiled at me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan walked over slowly. He had seen through everything. When he met Jin Xuan Ming for the first time, he knew that he would face such a trial but he didn\u2019t want to say it. He wanted things to happen on their own.</p><br/><p>He knew all about these burglars.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan wasn\u2019t panicky at all towards these burglars. He was calm and he said to Lil\u2019 Zhang, \u201cWhy did you run to so many places? It was so troublesome for me to chase after you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lil\u2019 Zhang was stunned. \u201cHow do you know me?\u201d</p><br/><p>It was a difficult question to answer and Lin Fan couldn\u2019t be bothered. He just patted the shoulder of one of the burglars. \u201cBro, not bad. That was how you should treat a f*cking Korean. I am impressed by your actions. Although you guys are burglars, I\u2019ve never looked down on any profession. I am extremely happy with your case.\u201d</p><br/><p>The burglar that kicked Jin Xuan Ming looked at him in shock. He didn\u2019t understand what was going on. What was this man talking about?</p><br/><p>Even the other burglars were rooted to the ground.</p><br/><p>They were burglars and the thing they feared most was being exposed.</p><br/><p>Today, someone had found them but what could they even do about it? Kill him? They were just burglars, they only wanted to steal things and didn\u2019t want to hurt anyone.</p><br/><p>Stealing and killing someone were two different extremes. They wanted to still have a good life and didn\u2019t want to spend the rest of their lives in prison.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan came to the lady that pretended to be pregnant and nodded. \u201cGirl, you look decent and have good acting skills. In the future, you might want to join the acting industry and perhaps you can make a living there. However, I have to take this \u2018Hundred birds\u2019 drawing away. Of course, you guys did a great job and I can\u2019t let you guys leave empty-handed. Why should you return something that you stole with your own skills? I won\u2019t bully you guys. Here are two drawings by Yue Qiu Ju Shi and Tao Shi Gang, they\u2019re worth four to five million dollars.\u201d</p><br/><p>The \u2018Hundred birds\u2019 drawing was taken away from the \u2018pregnant lady\u2019 by Lin Fan but she was handed two more drawings.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan realized that these people were dumbfounded. They just stood rooted to the ground in silence. Then, he just helplessly left.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, we shall meet again if we\u2019re fated to,\u201d Lin Fan said and waved.</p><br/><p>After Lin Fan left.</p><br/><p>The burglars recovered from their daze.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho is he?\u201d</p><br/><p>All of them stared at each other.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t we speak?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI was afraid that there would be policemen who would point their guns at us. If we were to move, we\u2019d be shot dead.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s the police then?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>In the end, the burglars discussed a little longer and opened the two drawings. They smiled and their eyes lit up.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was happy after taking the artwork back. Initially, he hadn\u2019t been bothered by the fact that his artwork had gotten stolen. However, Yue Qiu Ju Shi was extremely upset after losing the artwork and he was afraid that Yue Qiu Ju Shi would get depressed. Therefore, he came over to trade two artworks for one.</p><br/><p>He looked at it the same way.</p><br/><p>They stole it based on their abilities. There was no need to bully them.</p><br/><p>It was a fair trade after all.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, one of the burglars had also done a \u2018good deed\u2019 for him.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

What was going on? Was his brother upset about something? And what did he mean by the songs? Wang Ming Yang just couldn't figure it out.</p><br/><p>Then, he turned on his computer and looked at the music website.</p><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue's album had been released through two channels. One of them was a website and the other was directly selling physical albums. In the current age, physical albums were not popular anymore but as a person in the music industry, if you didn't release physical albums, you would surely be ridiculed. Although the sales on that side weren't much, the website was doing pretty well.</p><br/><p>After some publicizing and buying a 'Recommended' spot on the website, the songs were quite well-received. Within the album, there was a song that had been previously written by Lin Fan, 'Sky'. The number of downloads on the music website was quite high. It managed to reach the third place on the website. However, the other songs didn't perform as well, placing over the tenth or even twentieth position.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang was already very content to be able to achieve such results. Wu Huan Yue had just made her debut, so naturally, it wasn't possible to achieve top spots right from the start. Everything had to be steadily developed.</p><br/><p>The works that placed above Wu Huan Yue's all belonged to veteran musicians. There were many works by good singers. Although Wu Huan Yue didn't lose out to them in terms of voice, she still lacked the technique and popularity to compete with them.</p><br/><p>Judging by the current pace, Wang Ming Yang predicted that within half a year, Wu Huan Yue could be boosted up. The amount of money that had to be invested wasn't small and they had to rely on connections to get some awards and things like that. All of these added up together would cost quite a big sum.</p><br/><p>*Ding Dong*</p><br/><p>\"Chief Wang, Master Lin is here.\" Xiao Chen opened up a path and Lin Fan swaggered into the place.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang was stunned. \"F*ck me, what on earth happened? Why are you in such a rush?\"</p><br/><p>\"Something big. Something very big. Something super big,\" said Lin Fan in a very serious tone. Then, he sat his butt down on the office table.</p><br/><p>Xiao Chen looked at the scene. He knew that Master Lin's relationship with Chief Wang was exceptional. Who else would dare to sit on Chief Wang's office table? Perhaps only Master Lin would dare to do so.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang said, \"Could it be that this is about what you said on the phone?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. \"That's right. That's exactly what this is about. You have to help. I'm devoting my all to composing to release an album.\"</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang was flustered. He had to put his life on the line here. He had incomparable trust in Lin Fan's composing skills but this situation wasn't quite right.</p><br/><p>Then, Wang Ming Yang went up to Lin Fan's side and said, \"Brother, I have to say that you shouldn't play around like this. Huan Yue's album was just released. We're still in the midst of announcing it. If another one were to be released, our loss would be greater than our gain. Why don't we wait for a little?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was taken aback. \"How many days?\"</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang felt like crying. How could it just be a matter of days? It would at least have to be a few months. But looking at Lin Fan's anticipatory expression, it was hard for him to say it. \"This...this...how about three or four months?\"</p><br/><p>\"Three or four months?\" Lin Fan considered it for a moment, then shook his head. \"That's very long.\"</p><br/><p>He wasn't anxious about the task at all but because it was such a simple task without any form of challenge, he had to complete it early so he could unlock the next task. Then, he would be able to hope for something good.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang asked curiously, \"Brother, tell me, what happened exactly?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at Wang Ming Yang with a serious face, then he said, \"You wouldn't understand. Recently, my brain has been filled with so many songs that it's going to explode. The number of songs stored in my brain is simply too much. I need to release them into the world.\"</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang just stared blankly. What kind of reason was that? Was something like that even possible? Then, he said, \"Brother, what kind of reason is that?\"</p><br/><p>\"What kind of reason could it be? That's enough talk. Is one month alright?\" said Lin Fan.\"</p><br/><p>\"Alright.\" Wang Ming Yang nodded and said, \"My brother has already said this much, even if it's not alright, I have to say that it's alright. If I had known earlier, I wouldn't have announced Wu Huan Yue's album release so early. I would've waited for your songs.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan patted Wang Ming Yang on the shoulder and said, \"Very good. You really are a brother. I'm going to leave first.\"</p><br/><p>Arriving in a rush. Leaving in a rush.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang shouted at him from behind, \"That was all you came to say to me?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan's voice rang out from outside the door, \"Of course. What else would I say to you?\"</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang was helpless. When he was about to continue observing the data charts, Lin Fan came back. Wang Ming Yang asked, \"Why are you back again?\"</p><br/><p>\"I forgot something. Let me ask you, if I want to start a children's welfare institute, do you think I have the capabilities to do so right now?\" asked Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang asked, \"Is this for real?\"</p><br/><p>\"What rubbish are you spouting? If I'm asking you, of course it's for real,\" said Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang shook his head. \"You don't quite have the capabilities required. Establishing a children's welfare institute requires a certain amount of money and a steady source of income. Also, you need to have a certain standing in society. Without any one of these three conditions, it's not possible. The government will also do some investigations on you, your character, personality, and family background, etc. It's just very complicated. Why do you suddenly ask?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled and said, \"I have nothing much to do each day. Doing something meaningful would be pretty nice.\"</p><br/><p>\"Alright, alright. You can do whatever you want. If you really want to do this, I can help you to apply. Of course, you have to think it through carefully. It's not such a simple matter. Once it is established, you have to take responsibility for it,\" said Wang Ming Yang.</p><br/><p>There were many entrepreneurs that involved themselves in charitable work but not many people were willing to establish children's welfare institutes. After all, it was something that would take a lifetime. The money involved was one thing but you would also have a responsibility that you would not be able to shy away from for the rest of your life. Hence, most entrepreneurs only donated money. Donating large sums of money would boost their reputations and also produce results quickly.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded and said, \"Oh yeah, if it's a government-established children's welfare institute, can I take over it?\"</p><br/><p>\"Which one?\" Wang Ming Yang was taken aback. Then, he asked, \"You're talking about that Nanshan Children's Welfare Institute that we went to before?</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded. \"Right. That's the one.\"</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang thought for a moment, then said, \"I'll help you ask about this. It shouldn't be much of a problem.\"</p><br/><p>\"Alright, then I'll have to trouble you. If there's a need, then contact me,\" said Lin Fan. He had to rely on Wang Ming Yang's help in this matter.</p><br/><p>This children's welfare institute thing was something he really wanted to do. He knew that his knowledge would keep increasing and increasing. If he were to raise those children, he wouldn't only be able to gain Encyclopedic Points, he would also be able to teach those children some things at the same time. It was a win-win situation.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan also fantasized a little. If he could raise them up to become all-rounded talents, that would be terrifying. Of course, these were just thoughts. After all, it would require time.</p><br/><p>However, with the knowledge that he possessed, even though the children wouldn't be able to learn it to its peak, if they could just learn ten percent of the knowledge, it would be enough to reach the top of the industries.</p><br/><p>Although it was a difficult path, a person has to have dreams.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

The two of them were extremely grateful towards Master Lin. If it hadn\u2019t been for his help, they really wouldn\u2019t have known what to do.</p><br/><p>But now, everything had been resolved. The contract had been terminated and they had regained their freedom.</p><br/><p>Young Chang and Young Shen exchanged looks at each other. They weren\u2019t people who didn\u2019t know what was good for them. Right now, perhaps Lin Fan was their enemy but he had a pretty good relationship with the Young Master. They had indeed angered Lin Fan. Although they had taken a beating, they had to admit defeat.</p><br/><p>In Beijing, they were very arrogant people. However, they could only be arrogant to average people.</p><br/><p>At that moment, the two of them stood up while holding their wine glasses. \u201cMaster Lin, we were wrong just now. We hope you don\u2019t hold a grudge. Let us drink to you as a sign of respect.\u201d</p><br/><p>*Gulp gulp*</p><br/><p>When Zou Tian Fu saw this, he nodded. At least it showed that these two guys weren\u2019t morons.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the two of them and smiled, \u201cAlright, let\u2019s leave that in the past. Since you have admitted your mistake, I shan\u2019t bother about it anymore. It would be petty of me to do so.\u201d</p><br/><p>Young Chang and Young Shen heaved sighs of relief. As long as Master Lin didn\u2019t hold a grudge against them, it was good. After all, they still wanted to be friends with the Young Master. If they offended someone who was close to the Young Master, the Young Master might think badly of them.</p><br/><p>He Ming Hui sat at the banquet, not saying a single word. He had become a service personnel, pouring wine for the rest of them.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said with a smile, \u201cYoung Master, judging by your physiognomy, things in Beijing must have been very successful.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zou Tian Fu chuckled and said delightedly, \u201cLet\u2019s not talk about that. The matter hasn\u2019t ended yet.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed and didn\u2019t say much else. The lunch gathering went on normally.</p><br/><p>But what made Young Chang puzzled was that Master Lin kept staring at him and it made him feel a little awkward. Could it be that there was a problem with this Master Lin\u2019s sexual orientation?</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, is there something on my body?\u201d asked Young Chang.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled and shook his head, \u201cNo, it\u2019s just that something feels wrong.\u201d</p><br/><p>Young Chang was taken aback. He didn\u2019t quite understand what Lin Fan meant by that. What was it that felt wrong?</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan had nothing to do, he read everyone\u2019s fortunes. Other than Young Chang, none of them would face any problems.</p><br/><p>The reason he hadn\u2019t pointed it out the whole time was that he was unsure if he wanted to give advice.</p><br/><p>Or rather, whether it was worth it to give advice.</p><br/><p>But Lin Fan decided to just tell Young Chang since he had already admitted his mistake. As for whether he would heed Lin Fan\u2019s advice or not, that was his own problem.</p><br/><p>Zou Tian Fu looked at Lin Fan curiously as well. \u201cWhat\u2019s up with him? What is it that feels wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cLet me advise you. When you go back to Beijing, it\u2019s best not to participate in any dangerous activities for seven days. Otherwise, something bad will happen.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Young Chang was stunned. \u201cMaster Lin, what do you mean by that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan didn\u2019t want to say too much. \u201cJust remember this. When you go back, don\u2019t participate in any dangerous activities for the first seven days and you\u2019ll be fine. Enough talk, let\u2019s eat, everyone.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zou Tian Fu smiled, \u201cRight, right, enough talk. Just remember Master Lin\u2019s words.\u201d</p><br/><p>Young Chang had been put in a restless state by Lin Fan. He kept having a strange feeling.</p><br/><p>After the lunch gathering, Lin Fan didn\u2019t stay with Zou Tian Fu and the rest. Instead, he left the place.</p><br/><p>He wasn\u2019t that close to Zou Tian Fu yet. Right now, they were just acquaintances who knew each other.</p><br/><p>Below the building!</p><br/><p>Chen Yun Yi\u2019s nimble eyes were fixed on Lin Fan. \u201cThank you so much, Master Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved his hand and smiled, \u201cNo need to thank me, it\u2019s just a small matter. What plans do you two have from now on?\u201d</p><br/><p>The two of them looked at each other. They really had no idea what they would do from then on. Their dreams were to become celebrities. Now that they had terminated their contract with Chief He, they were free but they were filled with a sense of crisis regarding this profession.</p><br/><p>After all, this incident had impacted them greatly. If it hadn\u2019t been for Master Lin, it probably would have ended horribly.</p><br/><p>We haven\u2019t thought about it yet. We\u2019ll see how it goes,\u201d said Chen Yun Yi.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan hesitated for a moment, then said, \u201cHow about this? You two leave with me. I coincidentally know someone and you can join his company. I can\u2019t promise you much but at least things like this won\u2019t happen again. Are you interested?\u201d</p><br/><p>The two of them were filled with hope. Then, with beaming smiles, they replied, \u201cYes, we\u2019re interested.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGet on the car then. I\u2019ll introduce you two to him.\u201d Lin Fan was going to introduce them to Wang Ming Yang. In Wang Ming Yang\u2019s hands, at least things like this wouldn\u2019t happen. Moreover, good stuff should be kept among family and friends. These two people had great potential. If they were to be nurtured, they could become pillars of support for the company.</p><br/><p>This was considered a very good trade.</p><br/><p>Eastern Han Group.</p><br/><p>Chen Yun Yi looked at the building in front of her and she said with astonishment, \u201cMaster Lin, why are we here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled, \u201cOf course, we\u2019re here to introduce you to your new boss. The boss here is a good brother of mine. He\u2019s very reliable and he won\u2019t sell you guys off.\u201d</p><br/><p>Luo Dan said in surprise, \u201cThis is the Eastern Han Group! I know about it. The entertainment company under it is pretty good. In particular, that Wu Huan Yue was promoted by them and she received an explosion of popularity. For a new singer to rise up so quickly, it\u2019s a first.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin fan said, \u201cLet\u2019s go in then.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everybody here knew about his relationship with Wang Ming Yang. Naturally, nobody stopped him from entering and the front desk staff looked at him with respect.</p><br/><p>The office.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang was looking at the news but when he saw his brother come to his company, a joyous smile appeared on his face. \u201cWhy are you looking for me today?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan sat on the office table. \u201cWhat? Is it out of the ordinary? I\u2019m introducing you to two pretty good young talents.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang sized the two girls up. Then, he nodded, \u201cNot bad, not bad.\u201d He smiled mischievously, \u201cCould it be that you\u2019ve been out womanizing and now you want to place them here for me to take care of them?\u201d</p><br/><p>He made such a blunt joke in front of the two girls, causing them to lower them heads shyly. It seemed that they were very embarrassed.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled and scolded him, \u201cWhat nonsense is that? I\u2019m serious.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m just joking. Don\u2019t mind it,\u201d said Wang Ming Yang cheerily, \u201cAlright, since you introduced them, I trust you, so I\u2019ll definitely treat them like my own people and nurture them properly.\u201d</p><br/><p>After chatting for over ten minutes, they had finished discussing.</p><br/><p>Chen Yun Yi and Luo Dan followed the staff to go sign the contract.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan took out his car keys from his pocket and threw them on the table. \u201cI\u2019m giving you the car back.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming couldn\u2019t quite understand this. \u201cWhy? Don\u2019t you like the car? Do you want to get another one?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I do like it but the car has been ruined by me,\u201d said Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang was startled, \u201cWhat? Ruined? How is it ruined? It hasn\u2019t even been two days, has it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shrugged and said helplessly, \u201cWho can be blamed for this? I\u2019ve been addicted to concocting pills recently and I\u2019ve been making a lot of pots explode. I accidentally got this car damaged by the explosions. Sigh, it can\u2019t be helped.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, you\u2019re a car destroying demon! Not even two days and you\u2019ve destroyed a million dollar car. But it\u2019s fine, I\u2019m rich and overbearing. Enough said, there are many more cars. I\u2019ll get someone to send you a car later on.\u201d Wang Ming Yang patted himself on the chest. He had this situation covered.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan felt touched as he patted Wang Ming Yang on the shoulder. \u201cOn my path of pill concoction, you\u2019ve given me the most support. Enough said, if I don\u2019t give you something beneficial today, you would think that I\u2019m wasting my time. This is my painstakingly crafted pill. It isn\u2019t a perfect product but it\u2019s still a priceless treasure. It\u2019s something that money cannot buy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang looked at Lin Fan, then at the white pill. A look of disdain was on his face as he said, \u201cD*mn, this looks disgusting. It looks like chicken sh*t.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

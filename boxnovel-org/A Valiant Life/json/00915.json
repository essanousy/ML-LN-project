That was why he had nothing to say when faced with the reporters.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-1\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Some celebrities in the entertainment industry were discussing it within their small personal groups as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis Master Lin has really fallen.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe news on the Internet is way too hot. Everyone is talking about this matter. It seems that no matter what, as long as it is related to Master Lin, it will get in the headlines.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you think about this incident? This Master Lin can\u2019t really be this kind of person, can he?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho knows? But everyone makes mistakes. For this Master Lin to do something wrong is normal too. But because he\u2019s a public figure, people won\u2019t let it go so easily. That\u2019s why things have turned out this way.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI took a look at this matter. Those who got chosen aren\u2019t that good-looking either. How could there be corruption involved?\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-2\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cWho knows? Maybe he prefers women like that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly!</p><br/><p>Within the chat group, a celebrity spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck, I\u2019m shocked. Hurry up and look at Master Lin\u2019s Weibo.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe tide has turned, it really has.\u201d</p><br/><p>When they saw this, the other celebrities hurriedly went to take a look. Although it didn\u2019t have anything to do with them, they were very nosy. Especially because it was related to Master Lin, it made them very interested.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-3\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Master Lin\u2019s dedicated fans were overwrought. Regarding the situation on the Internet, they were extremely anxious. They had no idea why their idol wouldn\u2019t explain himself. But they couldn\u2019t just sit idly by. Hence, they were engaged in a flame war with those haters.</p><br/><p>It could be said that they were fighting a dark and gloomy battle.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou bunch of idiots. You\u2019re still trying to clear his name? Let\u2019s see you try!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe more you try, the worse it gets. You\u2019re saying that he read their fortunes? I think your idol has lost it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck off! Everyone knows that Master Lin can read fortunes. He must have predicted something.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou scum. Master Lin has done so many good deeds. He even developed a prescription for leukemia and publicized it freely. Yet, you still have the audacity to flame him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDeveloping the prescription doesn\u2019t have sh*t to do with me. I don\u2019t have leukemia anyway. I don\u2019t need that prescription.\u201d</p><br/><p>Facing such haters, they really couldn\u2019t overcome them with words. No matter what they said, the haters wouldn\u2019t believe them.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, Master Lin has explained things. He has slapped you all in the face beautifully. Go and take a look! Then, tell me whether you still want to flame him.\u201d</p><br/><p>In the middle of the intense argument, this comment suddenly appeared.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-4\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, Master Lin has explained himself? I have to go and take a look.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, everyone rushed to Master Lin\u2019s Weibo page.</p><br/><p>When they saw the post, they were all stunned.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan: \u201cInitially, I didn\u2019t want to say much on this matter because there was no need at all, nor did I want to cause trouble for anyone. However, the way things have developed has already gone beyond my expectations. As for those who failed to be hired, I am deeply disappointed. Since it has come to this, I can only reveal the conditions with which I picked my teachers.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAs everyone knows, I was choosing teachers for my welfare institute. And what children in welfare institutes lack in comparison to other children is a warm family. Therefore, when I was choosing teachers, I didn\u2019t place emphasis on the applicants\u2019 academic qualifications. Instead, I was looking at whether they were kind-hearted. To me, kindness is much more important than any academic qualification.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe videos below are of the test that I had prepared for the applicants at the entrance of the welfare institute. I am very satisfied. Out of a hundred applicants, there were thirty who met my requirements.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSeeing a child in need and stepping forward to help without minding the interview time. When I saw that, I already decided to hire them.\u201d</p><br/><p>There were several videos that had been posted. And under each video, there was a description.</p><br/><p>Most people opened the first video and played it.</p><br/><p>In the video, a plump child was standing there and crying, about twenty meters away from the welfare institute. At the entrance, the applicants had gathered there. When the gates to the welfare institute were opened, some applicants chose to go and help that child while others completely ignored him and just went in for the interview.</p><br/><p>Another video showed the evil tyrant played by Zhao Tian Shan. This scene appeared on everyone\u2019s screens.</p><br/><p>They watched each video very seriously. Although they were quiet, they understood what was happening on the display completely.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-5\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>After watching all the videos, everyone was silent.</p><br/><p>The fans who had kept their faith in Lin Fan the whole time started smiling happily. They were incomparably delighted because Master Lin turned out to still be the same Master Lin they knew. Nothing had changed.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, those haters\u2019 faces had turned pale. They felt that they had made a fool of themselves. This was completely different from what they had expected.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, I told you so. Master Lin definitely would not do such an unfair thing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell played. This test was strict but I support it. This is a children\u2019s welfare institute. Academic qualifications are not important at all. A child standing there by himself would surely make you feel unsettled but out of all these applicants, some of them actually acted like they didn\u2019t see him. Between the interview and helping the child in need, they chose the interview. That\u2019s why they failed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMotherf*ckers. I feel like I\u2019ve been played by those people who failed to get chosen. This is f*cking outrageous. I can\u2019t take it, I have to go and flame them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cForget it. Look at Master Lin\u2019s post. He has already said the final word. This matter has concluded. There\u2019s no need to cause trouble for anyone.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI just can\u2019t swallow this. I have to apologize to that Jiang Hui. I scolded her so harshly just now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHurry up and go. Don\u2019t be too rash next time. I knew that things would turn around, so I just waited all this while.\u201d</p><br/><p>Those people who had not been hired were all stunned when they saw Master Lin\u2019s Weibo. They had not expected things to turn out like this at all.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-6\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>At the entrance of the welfare institute, that child that they had seen had actually been the test itself. And because they had been in such a rush to go for the interview, they had chosen to neglect him.</p><br/><p>At that moment, they understood why they hadn\u2019t been chosen.</p><br/><p>Some of them felt extremely guilty. When they looked at the posts that they had made on Weibo before, they felt as if they had been slapped in the face now.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m willing to pass down what I\u2019ve learned to the little flowers of our country\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Now that they looked at it, these words were simply too disgusting.</p><br/><p>Then, some of them started to post apologies.</p><br/><p>Looking at this situation, Lin Fan shook his head. This matter really made him feel a little helpless.</p><br/><p>It had been a small matter but such a big deal had been made out of it. It was hard to imagine that this would happen.</p><br/><p>It seemed that he would have to be a little more careful in future.</p><br/><p>He had to reveal to the public what had to be revealed after all. The power of the Internet was not to be underestimated.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-7\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div></div>\n</div>"}

They held this matter in high regard. If it was successful, they would have one less worry.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was in for some trouble. He didn't even have a good night's rest. Now, he had to wear his clothes and dress up. However, he wasn't interested in matchmaking at all. He wanted to depend on his fate to find the girl of his dreams. But as he saw how excited his parents were, he had to cooperate with them.</p><br/><p>Father Lin held onto his waist and said, \"Stand up straight so you won't look sloppy.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan helplessly sighed, \"Wow, I look so energetic now.\"</p><br/><p>Then, Mother Lin's voice could be heard from outside his house, \"Are the both of you done? If you're done, let's go. We need to make arrangements with the restaurant.\"</p><br/><p>\"Mum, it's only 10 am. Isn't it a little too early?\" Lin Fan looked at the clock and said.</p><br/><p>Mother Lin chided, \"What do you mean it's early? It's okay, we'd be late if we leave our house any later. We have to leave a good impression. Let's go, quick!\"</p><br/><p>In the end, he had to leave with his parents.</p><br/><p>They had no car and it was mainly because none of them knew how to drive. Hence, they hailed a cab at a small junction.</p><br/><p>The restaurant was a pretty luxurious one. It was located in Guangzhou. Picking a more luxurious restaurant was a form of respect for the other party. Anyway, it was still affordable and his mum was preparing everything.</p><br/><p>When the cab left, an average looking car followed behind.</p><br/><p>In the car.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang laughed when he saw the cab left. He borrowed the car from his wife's drama team. Then, he spoke to Lin Fan through the phone and pretended to be in Shanghai. He managed to find out Lin Fan's matchmaking timing and he had been waiting for him to leave his house.</p><br/><p>Matchmaking was such a major event and he didn't want to miss it. He had to follow behind closely.</p><br/><p>After a while, Wang Ming Yang followed the cab to a luxurious restaurant. Then, he stopped the car at the roadside and walked towards the restaurant.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan wanted to follow his parents up but he was stunned when he saw Wang Ming Yang. He blinked several times and thought he had made a mistake. After confirming that it was him, he was dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>Why did this fella follow along?</p><br/><p>\"Dad, mum, both of you can go up first. I'll be there for a while,\" Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>Mother Lin said, \"Come up soon. Don't disappear on me. Room 806, remember that.\"</p><br/><p>\"Okay, I know that,\" Lin Fan said and nodded. He waited for his parents to go up and then he walked quickly towards Wang Ming Yang, \"Why are you here?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan couldn't think of a good reason why he appeared. This fella was so sneaky. He was almost shocked to death when he saw him.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang chuckled, \"Shocking, right? Was my surprise a success?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan rolled his eyes, \"Not pleasantly surprised at all. I'm just shocked. Why are you here? You must be very free to follow me here.\"</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang replied, \"Don't be so full of yourself. I told you that my wife is filming in Guangzhou and so I'm here to take a look. It just so happened that you're here too. So, I decided to come and take a look.\"</p><br/><p>If he had believed his words, he'd be the stupidest man alive. When they just spoke over the phone, he mentioned that he was still in Shanghai. But now he suddenly appeared here in Guangzhou. Was it all part of a plan?</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked around him as he was afraid that Wang Ming Yang would've brought the others along. Wang Ming Yang said, \"Don't worry, I came here alone.\"</p><br/><p>He heaved a sigh of relief upon hearing Wang Ming Yang's words. If they had all followed along, it would've been a mess.</p><br/><p>\"How's your matchmaking partner? Are you happy with her? Is she suitable for you?\" Wang Ming Yang asked curiously.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan rolled his eyes, \"I haven't even gotten a chance to see her. Who am I supposed to ask to answer your question? Let's cut the crap. Tell me, what do you want?\"</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang said softly, \"Actually, I'm just here to have a look. If you don't mind, bring me along too. I just want to have a look. Furthermore, I can say hi to your parents too.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan wanted to reject Wang Ming Yang but as he thought of how witty he was, he smiled, \"I can bring you along to have a look but you have to think of something for me. If the girl doesn't like me, you don't have to do anything. But if she likes me, you have to think of a way to help me get rid of her.\"</p><br/><p>\"Haha, sure. I can think of many ways to do so,\" Wang Ming Yang chuckled.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan immediately waved his hand, \"Wait, don't think of some stupid way. My parents can't take the shock.\"</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang laughed, \"Don't worry. You can rest assured. I will never scare your parents!\"</p><br/><p>Then, Lin Fan nodded, \"Alright, I feel more assured after hearing that.\"</p><br/><p>They entered the room.</p><br/><p>His parents were a little stunned when they saw Wang Ming Yang. They wondered who he was.</p><br/><p>\"This is\u2026?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled, \"This is my friend from Shanghai. We're very close. He came over immediately to look out for me when he heard that I'm going to go for matchmaking.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang was extremely passionate when he saw his parents. He said sweetly, \"Hi, uncle and auntie. I am Wang Ming Yang, a good friend of Lin Fan. I rushed here when I heard he wanted to go for matchmaking. I had to come personally to keep a look out for him. You don't know how popular he is with the girls. The problem is he doesn't like any of them.\"</p><br/><p>\"D*mn it!\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was stunned when he heard his words. This guy was spouting nonsense. It was all a lie.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan's parents were stunned too. They didn't even know how to react. They felt that this fella was a little too passionate but since he was Lin Fan's friend, they were friendly towards him.</p><br/><p>\"Uncle, auntie, I'm sorry to not bring any gifts this time as I left in a rush. I bought each of you a gift card from the supermarket opposite. You can buy anything you like,\" Wang Ming Yang took out two gold gift cards from his pocket. They were powerful family gift cards. Wang Ming Yang couldn't think of anything suitable to give them as gifts. So, he bought these gift cards for them when he saw the large supermarket opposite.</p><br/><p>When his parents saw these two cards, they were stunned. They immediately waved their hands, \"Son, tell your friend it's okay. It's good enough for him to be here. There's no need for a gift.\"</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang waved his hand, \"It's just a small gift.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan didn't expect this man to be so good at bribing people. He noticed that his parents didn't seem willing to accept the cards. So, he said, \"Mum, dad, just accept it. This guy is filthy rich. You don't have to feel bad.\"</p><br/><p>Mother Lin scolded, \"What do you mean by filthy rich? How could you say such a thing?\"</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang said anxiously, \"Uncle, auntie, your son has helped me a lot. Furthermore, these two cards didn't cost me much money. Please accept it as a small token.\"</p><br/><p>After being reluctant for a short while, Mother Lin accepted the gift. \"Lil' Wang, please help to look out for our Lil' Fan back in Shanghai. You're more sensible than him. Then, Uncle and I would be less worried about him.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan just sat there and didn't know what to say. He had become a scapegoat again.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang touched his chest and said, \"Don't worry, as long as I'm here, nobody can bully him in Shanghai.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan couldn't take how Wang Ming Yang boasting in front of his parents any longer, \"Don't listen to his bullsh*t, I don't cause any trouble in Shanghai. There's nothing for him to help me with. Alright, just sit here and stop talking. Nobody would think you're a mute if you'd just keep your mouth shut.\"</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang smiled. Then, he turned towards his parents and said, \"Uncle, auntie, we can talk more when we get back\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"Alright, alright\u2026 Lil' Wang is so sensible. Lil' Fan, you gotta learn from him,\" Mother Lin said.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was speechless, \"...\"</p><br/><p>Then, the door was pushed open. His matchmaking partner was finally here.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

He took a deep breath and felt revitalized. He finally could breathe in the same familiar air again.</p><br/><p>He hailed a cab.</p><br/><p>\"To Cloud Street.\"</p><br/><p>The driver replied, \"Alright.\"</p><br/><p>At that moment, there was a car behind the cab. Qiao Fei pointed at the cab in front of his and said, \"Follow him, I'll pay you double the cab fare.\"</p><br/><p>The taxi drivers in Shanghai were experienced and skilled and it was rare for them to be involved in accidents. There was even a saying that if you could drive smoothly in Shanghai, you would be unstoppable anywhere else in the world.</p><br/><p>The driver looked excited. \"Sit tight, I assure you we'll be on their heels.\"</p><br/><p>Qiao Fei tightened his seatbelt and sneered. This fella had actually messed with him at the airport. If he hadn't been rushing for his flight, he wouldn't have let him off so easily.</p><br/><p>He had taken the first class cabin and after coming out of the plane, he had been waiting there for Lin Fan. He refused to let him off until he settled the score with him.</p><br/><p>In the cab.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was talking to Wang Ming Yang over the phone.</p><br/><p>\"I'm in the cab now. I'm on the way to the shop first. Why did you call me?\"</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang replied, \"It's all thanks to you. I'll tell you a piece of good news later.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled, \"What is it? You sound so happy.\"</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang replied, \"Wu Huan Yue's album is out. Obviously, I had to upload it online first. The number of downloads is crazy! There were 150,000 downloads in just the first twenty-four hours. Do you know what this means?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed, \"Why did you tell me this information? I don't belong in the music industry. But you sound like you're thinking of a huge celebration, aren't you?\"</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang was ecstatic even though he wasn't earning money. In fact, he had to pay for advertisements. But now that the results were so stellar, he was extremely happy. After all, it showed that he had made the right decision to invest in the music industry. It had really succeeded.</p><br/><p>He thought through everything. He was going to be involved in the music industry for just a while so that his reputation would increase. After that, he would join the film industry as that was where the money was at. Furthermore, it would make him famous in the shortest period of time.</p><br/><p>But it was taxing for Wu Huan Yue. She had to practice her singing and acting at the same time.</p><br/><p>Teen male idols were the most popular in the current film industry, even if they had zero acting skills. However, they couldn't be famous for a long time. What he wanted to do was to create a true star performer. One that was capable of lasting through the years and wouldn't become irrelevant over time. He wanted someone that would be remembered by people.</p><br/><p>What made Wang Ming Yang relieved was that even though Wu Huan Yue was working so hard everyday, she wasn't afraid of these practices and challenges at all.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, she was extremely pretty. She was the type of woman that people would find her prettier the more they looked at her. There were many pretty ladies around but they all looked average after several looks.</p><br/><p>\"Of course, we have to celebrate. But let's wait for now and see how the final results are,\" Wang Ming Yang said happily. If he could single-handedly help Wu Huan Yue rise to fame, he would have a great sense of achievement.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded. \"Alright then, let's leave it at that for now. I'll be back at my shop to take a break. Just contact me if anything happens.\"</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang replied, \"No problem, my brother.\"</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Soon, he reached Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan paid the fare and alighted. When the shop owners saw Lin Fan, they were extremely passionate towards him.</p><br/><p>\"Master Lin is back! How did it feel to return home?\" The boss of the shoe shop asked as he was smoking outside.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled, \"It was okay. It felt pretty good.\"</p><br/><p>As he walked past a jewelry shop, the lady boss, Sister Wen, asked, \"Little Boss, you're back. I haven't seen you in a long time and I kinda missed you.\"</p><br/><p>\"Sister Wen, you missed me? If your husband finds out about this, he would definitely come looking for me.\"</p><br/><p>Sister Wen replied, \"This fella's mouth is beginning to get worse after returning from home.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved at everyone. He had a good relationship with all the shop owners nearby. He greeted everyone as he walked past each shop.</p><br/><p>Elder Dog Nicholas, who was lying at the door, suddenly stood up and looked at Lin Fan. He charged towards him and barked. Then, he stayed around him with his tail raised up high.</p><br/><p>\"After being gone for a few days, Elder Dog looks bigger now,\" Lin Fan said. Elder Dog Nicholas' snow-white body looked slightly bigger. He was about one centimeter taller. As to how Lin Fan had noticed it, it was all based on instinct.</p><br/><p>Elder Dog Nicholas ran around happily and barked.</p><br/><p>In the shop.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian hugged Lin Fan when he saw him. \"Wow, I haven't seen you in just a few days and I missed you so much. Did you bring anything nice?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan pretended that he missed him too. He smiled. \"I didn't bring anything back though.\"</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang was broadcasting in his shop and he pointed the camera of his phone at Lin Fan. \"Our Master Lin is finally back. Everyone, please clap for him.\"</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan looked at Lin Fan curiously. She asked, \"How did the matchmaking go?'</p><br/><p>She asked her question in a straightforward manner.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shrugged. \"It didn't succeed. She didn't like me because she thought I was too old.\"</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan smiled. \"That person must have had good taste.\"</p><br/><p>\"Haha\u2026\" Lin Fan laughed. The matchmaking session had been his most feared thing when he had gone back. Since everything was settled beautifully, he wasn't afraid anymore.</p><br/><p>Wu Tian He chuckled, \"We were so busy during your absence for the past few days. Besides us, the townsfolk missed you too.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. \"They must be so impatient after not eating any scallion pancakes for the past few days.\"</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian glanced at Lin Fan. \"You don't know what happened. These townsfolk came every single day to see if you were back. They wished you'd returned sooner.\"</p><br/><p>\"Let's not talk about these. I brought some local specialties back for all of you,\" Lin Fan said. Then, he opened the bag and took out the things.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>At a short distance from the shop, Qiao Fei sneered when he saw Lin Fan enter his shop. So this is his shop\u2026</p><br/><p>Then, Qiao Fei walked towards the shop without any hesitation. He wanted to let Lin Fan know the consequences of his actions against him.</p><br/><p>Initially, he had thought Lin Fan was some powerful individual but now, it seemed like he was just an average person.</p><br/><p>In the shop, Fraud Tian was talking but then he saw someone standing at the entrance. He went forward and asked, \"May I know what you're looking for?\"</p><br/><p>Qiao Fei pushed Fraud Tian aside and looked at Lin Fan. \"Dude, you must be shocked to see me, right?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was stunned. He hadn't expected him to be there. Perhaps he had followed him back to his shop?</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian looked at the man and then at Lin Fan. \"You know him?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled, \"I don't know him. I only met him once at the airport. I didn't know his sense of smell was so good. He actually managed to find me here.\"</p><br/><p>Everyone in the shop was shocked. They didn't know what was happening.</p><br/><p>What was his relationship with this man? Things didn't seem too good.</p><br/><p>...</p><br/>\n</div>"}

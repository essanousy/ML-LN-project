I\u2019m changing a channel. This is just absurd!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t Master Lin around? Master Lin, hurry up and challenge that b*stard!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s there to challenge? You\u2019re thinking too much. This guy is a table tennis player, and Master Lin isn\u2019t even a sportsman. What\u2019s he going to use to challenge him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExactly. Even if Master Lin is able to beat this guy, what\u2019s that going to prove? It\u2019ll only show that us Chinese aren\u2019t able to accept defeat and allow anger to get the better of us. It\u2019ll put our nation to shame!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHoly sh*t! What the f*ck can we do?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDoes that mean we can only sit back and watch this b*stard show-off?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>To the audience, they really wished that Master Lin would be able to exact revenge. But when they thought about it, it was something that was simply impossible.</p><br/><p>Master Lin didn\u2019t know how to play table tennis, so how was he going to violently crush others?</p><br/><p>They got rather frustrated just thinking about it.</p><br/><p>At the backstage.</p><br/><p>Director Liu had a head full of perspiration, yet he didn\u2019t know why.</p><br/><p>At the same time, he was extremely regretful. Just what was he thinking at that time? Why did he want to invite this Japanese over? There were so many top athletes in his own country, yet he just had to invite that b*stard over.</p><br/><p>Right now something has happened and there were people that just stood up and left, leaving behind a terrible mess that was entirely his responsibility.</p><br/><p>The employee made sure to tread lightly on a thread, \u201cDirector, why don\u2019t we just turn off the live stream?\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Liu replied, \u201cHow are we going to turn it off? If we turn it off, we\u2019ll become a laughing stock, don\u2019t you understand?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat shall we do then? The more we let this run, the more the unexpected could happen. If we continue to let this b*stard to talk, I\u2019m afraid we\u2019re going to get scolded to death by the citizens tomorrow,\u201d The employee said urgently. At the same time, he also had a question he hadn\u2019t asked. If the higher-ups were to feel uncomfortable about this, he was afraid that after the criticism and reorganization, it would be all over for them.</p><br/><p>Director Liu thought about for awhile, \u201cWe don\u2019t have a choice. We can only hope that the host quickly ends the show.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan sat in the guest seats. He watched on with a very calm expression.</p><br/><p>In the beginning, he was furious, but right now, he looked at it calmly.</p><br/><p>He wanted to see how long this b*stard could dance around.</p><br/><p>At this moment, the host started talking.</p><br/><p>\u201cRight now, we\u2019ve entered the next segment of our show, which is a live broadcast of a high-level athletics competition. After this, we will have Zhang Zi Wen from our nation\u2019s second team to play a friendly match with Zhenping Yiming.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDuring the Korean Championships, Zhang Zi Wen defeated an American who was one of the top ten players in the world then, to clinch the gold medal. Let us welcome Zhang Zi Wen on stage!\u201d</p><br/><p>There was a thunderous applause.</p><br/><p>At this moment, they urgently needed a savior to teach this b*stard a lesson.</p><br/><p>At the broadcasting station.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs this Zhang Zi Wen capable?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Nation\u2019s second team. Why isn\u2019t it the first team? D*mn! If the Nation\u2019s first team is here, they would definitely demolish this b*stard.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cZhang Zi Wen is very strong. Even though he hasn\u2019t debuted for a long time, but he is very capable. He clinched the first place in the Korean Championships and got a good result of the third placing in the Asian Championships. Even though he\u2019s in the second team, his abilities shouldn\u2019t be overlooked. He would definitely be able to teach Zhenping Yiming a lesson.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI actually don\u2019t think he\u2019s capable of doing so. Zhenping Yiming might be aggressive but he\u2019s actually very strong. He\u2019s much better than any Japanese player from the previous years. Moreover, Zhenping Yiming\u2019s coach is Su Jing. She was once the coach of the National women\u2019s team.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck! Are you talking about that the b*tch who married a Japanese and changed her nationality?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf that is the case, then this is very worrying. Su Jing was very strong in the past. She\u2019s often the champion in the World Championships. So the reason why Zhenping Yiming is so good is because he was taught by her. Oh my God, this is f*cking terrible.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Zi Wen went up on stage and nodded at the host. After which, he stared daggers at Zhenping Yiming.</p><br/><p>He heard everything from backstage and his blood was boiling. He never thought that a Japanese would be so arrogant despite just winning one championship. He didn\u2019t even put anyone in his eyes.</p><br/><p>He wanted to viciously teach this b*stard a lesson.</p><br/><p>Even though the pressure on him was very high, but he wasn\u2019t scared. He was constantly tuning his mental state when he was backstage.</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t underestimate him just because he was in the second team. Even if he were to be compared to the first team, his abilities wouldn\u2019t be any worse than other challengers.</p><br/><p>Zhenping Yiming looked at Zhang Zi Wen and smiled.</p><br/><p>However, this smile was one of contempt. He didn\u2019t even put Zhang Zi Wen in his eyes.</p><br/><p>The reason why Director Liu invited Zhang Zi Wen over to have a match during the show was actually to waver this b*stard\u2019s pride.</p><br/><p>However, he was carrying a heavy load of pressure. If he were to lose, then it would be disastrous.</p><br/><p>Also, the host didn\u2019t want Zhenping Yiming to go on with his nonsense, and thus immediately started the match.</p><br/><p>Right now, they needed a win to appease the hearts of the audience.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t dare to imagine him losing.</p><br/><p>\u201cAll the best!\u201d The host whispered to Zhang Zi Wen as he walked past him.</p><br/><p>Zhang Zi Wen nodded his head. He took a deep breath and warmed himself up. After which, he tossed the ball over to Zhenping Yiming, \u201cYou are the guest. You can serve first.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhenping Yiming laughed. Regarding the Chinese national team\u2019s tactics, he had already learned them all.</p><br/><p>His coach had already passed down all her past experience long before this. She had even told him some of the bad habits of the national team.</p><br/><p>This was in the spirit of knowing oneself, as well as the opponent, and he would emerge victorious in every battle.</p><br/><p>Zhang Zi Wen was very good, but he had the confidence that he could win the other party.</p><br/><p>Only Xu Song was able to put pressure on him, but of course, he wasn\u2019t going to admit all these, because a win is a win.</p><br/><p>Who cares whether it his old injury was aggravated.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Zhenping Yiming was done with his preparations. He dropped the ball slightly, and with a very subtle movement, he delivered a counter-rotation ball. This was very common in a regular match, but it also showed the strengths of the server.</p><br/><p>Moreover, it was very easy to gain points from such a serve. At times, it would even be an ace.</p><br/><p>Zhang Zi Wen was very nervy when the ball was served. But he had already seen the serve and he ferociously returned it.</p><br/><p>*Ping pong!\u201d</p><br/><p>A clear and crisp sound came from the stage.</p><br/><p>Everyone watching held their breaths, hoping for a victory.</p><br/><p>The atmosphere was very tense. It could be said that Zhang Zi Wen was displaying all his abilities.</p><br/><p>With one vicious return, Zhenping Yiming was unable to hit it in time and it just went behind him.</p><br/><p>There was a huge uproar.</p><br/><p>Everyone stood up in excitement.</p><br/><p>Zhang Zi Wen clenched his fist tightly, cheering himself on.</p><br/><p>In the broadcasting room.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha! Teach him a lesson!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cZhang Zi Wen is awesome! That ball was well-played!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell-played! Let this Japanese know who\u2019s boss! How dare he show off? It\u2019s practically seeking death.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhenping Yiming looked at the host and asked, \u201cHow many sets are we playing?\u201d</p><br/><p>Initially, the host wanted to say three wins in five sets. However, he realized that the crowd was rather unsettled. He then said, \u201cOne match to determine the winner.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Zhenping Yiming smiled. Then, he served.</p><br/><p>Just when everyone was hoping for the best, something about the situation became not quite right.</p><br/><p>Zhang Zi Wen was dignified. He realized that Zhenping Yiming\u2019s serving posture had a huge change. It was completely different from before.</p><br/><p>They rallied for a while.</p><br/><p>Zhang Zi Wen couldn\u2019t react in time and lost a ball.</p><br/><p>The audience was completely silent.</p><br/><p>That ball was really fast.</p></div>\n</div>"}

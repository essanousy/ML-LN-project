One apartment for each teacher. How luxurious.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Master Lin gives up his hard-earned money for the welfare institute. An apartment building in the middle of Shanghai, who knows how much it will cost?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018The teachers of Nanshan Children\u2019s Welfare Institute have found a great job.\u2019</p><br/><p>This matter was related to Master Lin as well as Nanshan Children\u2019s Welfare Institute. Naturally, it had a huge impact.</p><br/><p>When the netizens saw this piece of news, they were all shocked.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn! That\u2019s too luxurious. Master Lin is actually giving each teacher an apartment. Even I want to go and be a teacher now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMotherf*cker. This Nanshan Children\u2019s Welfare Institute is located in an expensive region. How much will it cost to build this apartment building?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it going to be up for sale? Perhaps Master Lin wants to earn some money using the welfare institute\u2019s land.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat does make a bit of sense. If he sells the apartments to outsiders, he would really profit from it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if he gives the teachers one apartment each, he can sell the rest to outsiders and he would really be rich.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, so that\u2019s it. I thought that this Master Lin was a great person to take over Nanshan Children\u2019s Welfare Institute. But now I\u2019m afraid he just took a liking to that piece of land. Now, he\u2019s finally making his move.\u201d</p><br/><p>Initially, this had been a very normal piece of news, but suddenly, for some reason, some people started spreading rumors that Master Lin seemed to have taken a liking for this piece of land and he wanted to develop property on it to sell to outsiders.</p><br/><p>Additionally, they said that Master Lin had never taken over the welfare institute based on goodwill. Instead, it had been because he wanted that piece of land.</p><br/><p>Cloud Street!</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was in his shop. The previous day, he had brought Wang Ming Yang there to survey the place. The technical staff had already begun preparing the blueprints.</p><br/><p>Regarding this matter, Lin Fan didn\u2019t want to drag it out. Because the building was going to be quite high, he wanted to be able to finish it in one to two years.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Wu You Lan was looking at Weibo when she cried out in shock, \u201cBrother Lin, people are scolding you on the Internet.\u201d</p><br/><p>Regarding matters on the Internet, if there were people scolding him, Wu You Lan would definitely be the one to tell him. After all, Wu You Lan would always look at the news when she had nothing else to do. If there was any news related to Lin Fan, she would definitely pay attention.</p><br/><p>Sometimes, Lin Fan\u2019s image would even be used by immoral businesses in their advertisements.</p><br/><p>When Wu You Lan saw such incidents, she would immediately call to report it and request for it to be taken down. Otherwise, she would sue them.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was sometimes too lazy to be bothered by such things but he couldn\u2019t just ignore them because these advertisements would sometimes be used to scam others. If other people really believed that those advertisements were endorsed by him, the outcome would be undesirable.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou Lan, what news is there now?\u201d Lin Fan felt helpless. He had only come back to Shanghai for a while and he was being talked about on the Internet again. Then, he unlocked his phone to see what kind of news it was.</p><br/><p>But when he saw the news, he didn\u2019t think much of it.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou Lan, what\u2019s wrong? It seems fine.\u201d Lin Fan laughed in his heart. He hadn\u2019t expected someone to leak that information out. However, it was good too. At least it showed that their Nanshan Children\u2019s Welfare Institute was quite generous.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Lin, look at the comments below,\u201d said Wu You Lan.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up with the comments? Let me see.\u201d Lin Fan was curious. Then, he looked down. With one look, he realized that things weren\u2019t right.</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang and Fraud Tian crowded around. They were very curious as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn. Brother Lin, isn\u2019t this slander?\u201d Zhao Zhong Yang cried out after taking a few glances. \u201cThese people really like to make things up. They\u2019re saying you took over the welfare institute not out of goodwill but because of that piece of land.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian shook his head. \u201cSigh. Jealousy makes people lose their morals. Other people have worked hard their whole lives and are still unable to buy a home while you just build an apartment building for the teachers like that. It would definitely attract idle gossip.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan glanced over. He was completely calm. \u201cNo need to care about this. If you care too much about comments on the Internet, you might even smash a few phones to pieces. Alright, no need to think about this. I\u2019m going to continue resting.\u201d</p><br/><p>On the Internet, this piece of news was spreading like a wave.</p><br/><p>Somehow, it seemed as if there was some kind of organization that just specialized in tainting Lin Fan\u2019s reputation. Whenever they had the chance, they would shame him mercilessly.</p><br/><p>Post after post appeared and they spread on Weibo and WeChat.</p><br/><p>Although these didn\u2019t go on official news websites, they were posted on various official accounts.</p><br/><p>\u2018Master Lin\u2019s true reason for taking over the welfare institute has finally been revealed.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Using the welfare institute\u2019s land for personal gain.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018The most despicable person has appeared. And he\u2019s the one you all know as Master Lin.\u2019</p><br/><p>These posts contained photographs as well as other content. These photographs were of the welfare institute\u2019s uncultivated land.</p><br/><p>Also, they talked about how big the area of land was and how much money could be earned if it was developed. They also said that Lin Fan was trying to win over the hearts of the people by promising each teacher an apartment.</p><br/><p>Anyone with a brain would have been able to see that these posts were full of mistaken information. However, after it was hyped up, some people who liked to see such controversial issues chose to believe it rather than not.</p><br/><p>The next day!</p><br/><p>Something that Lin Fan hadn\u2019t expected happened.</p><br/><p>This topic of conversation that had been spreading on the Internet really made it on the news. Moreover, the news agencies talked about it as if it was true. This made Lin Fan, who was making scallion pancakes in the shop, a little dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>He felt that these people were really unbelievable.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck, it can\u2019t be. I feel like Master Lin isn\u2019t this kind of person.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI choose to believe in Master Lin as well. This is definitely slander.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy doesn\u2019t Master Lin come out to explain himself? After all, this situation is getting messier and messier. In the end, we won\u2019t know who\u2019s telling the truth.</p><br/><p>\u201cI believe in Master Lin\u2019s character. I feel like someone is purposely trying to taint Master Lin\u2019s reputation.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re all a bunch of idiots. People are self-centered creatures. Master Lin\u2019s inherent nature has finally been revealed. Although he\u2019s very talented and he\u2019s done many big deeds, when it comes to money, no one can resist it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust wait and see. Master Lin will definitely say that this apartment building is a reward for the teachers to encourage them to keep teaching the children well. And the money from selling the apartments will all be used to keep the welfare institute running.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan saw these news articles, he was helpless. He immediately posted on Weibo.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have to say, friends, could you all not be so senseless? And news agencies, you guys even publish such news articles. Have you run out of news to write about? I don\u2019t want to have to explain too much. I\u2019m too lazy to explain to you all.\u201d</p><br/><p>If this was in the past, he would definitely have explained himself. But thinking about it now, he decided to forget about it and just let them talk. If he were to explain himself every time something happened, who knows how long he would have to keep explaining?</p></div>\n</div>"}

When they found that medicine, this pair of young parents were elated. But when they saw the price, they instantly choked.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-1\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>A box of medicine that was supposed to cost just over 70 had inflated to 3800 dollars.</p><br/><p>To them, this was too expensive. With their combined salary of about 6000 a month, how could they afford it? But for their child, they could only bite the bullet and buy it.</p><br/><p>However, the more they thought about it, the more they felt that something wasn\u2019t right. This medicine was clearly available on the website, so why did the big hospital not have any of it? What was the hidden reason behind this?</p><br/><p>When met with such a situation, they could only look for reporters and hope to shine a light on the matter.</p><br/><p>The next day!</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was lying on the chair in the shop, muttering in his heart. <em>Why isn\u2019t my student here yet? Could it be that he has sensed something?</em></p><div class=\"code-block code-block-2\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>But just as he thought of that, a figure appeared.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSigh!\u201d Lin Fan sighed. It seemed that he would have to keep delaying it. Otherwise, he wouldn\u2019t be able to take it.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, when will we start developing the prescription?\u201d asked Zhao Ming Qing excitedly. Clearly, he hadn\u2019t sensed that something was wrong with the situation.</p><br/><p>\u201cAbout that\u2026\u201d Lin Fan was in a tough spot. This disciple of his was really unyielding. However, he couldn\u2019t say it too bluntly. He had to protect his own image.</p><br/><p>Just as Lin Fan was about to make up an excuse, Wu You Lan shouted, \u201cBrother Lin, where do you think this medicine should be bought?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Lin Fan was startled. He didn\u2019t understand the question.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan brought her phone over. \u201cBrother Lin, look at this Weibo post. Someone is requesting help. They want to buy ACTH for injection purposes. And the news even says that this medicine that\u2019s worth over 70 dollars is being sold for thousands of dollars. That\u2019s really expensive!\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-3\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Lin Fan took the phone and looked closely. There were no problems stated in the Weibo post.</p><br/><p>But those reporters had reported quite a lot about the matter and the news had even appeared on the Internet.</p><br/><p>There was one thing that made him suspicious.</p><br/><p>And that was the conversation between the buyer and the black market website\u2019s merchant.</p><br/><p>\u2018How much do you want to buy? And which hospital told you to come here?\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018We don\u2019t have much stock here either. You have to produce your medical records and doctor\u2019s prescription.\u2019</p><br/><p>This was rather interesting.</p><br/><p>After contemplation, Lin Fan felt that there were quite a lot of problems with this. It was quite interesting.</p><br/><p>As Zhao Ming Qing looked from the side, his expression turned grave. \u201cTeacher, look. This kind of situation is too common.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan didn\u2019t say much. He then continued reading the news. The reporters had contacted the manufacturer to ask for a reason. The manufacturer denied that they had increased the price to 3800 dollars, saying that it wasn\u2019t possible.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-4\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>However, the website was clearly selling it for 3800 dollars. Hence, this situation was really peculiar.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey\u2019re stockpiling!\u201d Lin Fan exclaimed.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing nodded. \u201cThis is a very common situation. Some types of medicine aren\u2019t produced in large quantities and the amount on the market is rather small. But for some illnesses, these medications have to be used. Hence, people can stockpile the medicine and create a scarcity of that medicine, then sell it for a high price.\u201d</p><br/><p>*Ding ding!*</p><br/><p>Just as Lin Fan was reading the news, he realized that someone had tagged him in a post. Taking a closer look, it was the person who wanted to buy the medicine. The person had found Lin Fan and wanted to ask him for help.</p><br/><p>As for this cry for help, Lin Fan definitely wouldn\u2019t reject it. After all, he was someone who loved to get involved in other people\u2019s business.</p><br/><p>Then, he did a search for this medicine on the Internet. He searched for its effects as well as the composition of the medicine.</p><br/><p>He reckoned that developing this medicine wouldn\u2019t be too difficult.</p><br/><p>He brainstormed for a moment and thought of a good idea.</p><br/><p>\u201cMing Qing, do you have any thoughts about this issue?\u201d Lin Fan asked calmly.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s despicable.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan prompted, \u201cAnd?\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-5\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing was a little stunned. Besides it being despicable, he hadn\u2019t thought of anything else. What else was there? Then, he asked, \u201cTeacher, what do you think then?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan cleared his throat. \u201cSee here, Ming Qing. When we develop new prescriptions, we can\u2019t do it blindly. Look at this situation. Isn\u2019t it a very good example? We can develop a prescription for this. This is what is needed the most right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough developing it will be very tiring, someone needs our help now. We have to step forward and help.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Zhao Ming Qing heard his teacher\u2019s words, his eyes lit up as if he had discovered a new piece of land. \u201cTeacher, what you said makes a lot of sense.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen shall we develop this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded. \u201cMmm, that\u2019s what I\u2019m thinking. What do you think?\u201d</p><br/><p>To Zhao Ming Qing, it didn\u2019t matter what they were developing. As long as it was related to medicine, he was very interested.</p><br/><p>This prescription was not difficult at all. With Lin Fan\u2019s abilities, all he had to do was brainstorm a little and he would already have a solution. It was very simple.</p><br/><p>But in front of Zhao Ming Qing, he couldn\u2019t show that it was too simple. He had to make him feel that this was a very difficult task.</p><br/><p>Because only in this way could he satisfy Zhao Ming Qing for a period of time.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-6\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cAlright, Teacher, I agree with you. Let\u2019s develop this prescription and put an end to the monopoly of the market. This is an evil price. For a medicine that is worth 70 dollars to be sold for close to 4000, it is the same as robbery,\u201d said Zhao Ming Qing resentfully.</p><br/><p>Looking at Zhao Ming Qing, Lin Fan let out a breath of relief. The problem had finally been resolved.</p><br/><p><em>We can research and develop new prescriptions but we can\u2019t just keep developing prescriptions for major diseases. Wouldn\u2019t that make me die of fatigue?</em></p><br/><p><em>This kind of situation is perfect. I just have to do a bit of work and it\u2019ll be resolved. This is great!</em></p><br/><p><em>But this matter isn\u2019t over yet. Before we start researching, I have to make a Weibo post.</em></p><br/><p>People\u2019s Hospital.</p><br/><p>That young couple was looking at their child who was sound asleep. They couldn\u2019t help but sigh.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, their phone vibrated. They took a look curiously and their expressions instantly changed.</p><br/><p>Because they saw that Master Lin had tagged them and given them a reply.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan: @IamLittleFattyHuang, I\u2019ve seen the news about you. I\u2019ve decided to develop a prescription for you that will be even more effective against infantile spasms. Wait for me patiently. Also, I\u2019d like to advise the stockpilers to quickly lower their prices. Don\u2019t wait until the end when you won\u2019t be able to sell your goods anymore. When that happens, don\u2019t look for me for help.\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-7\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>When this Weibo was posted, everyone on Weibo went crazy.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn! Is Master Lin personally making a move?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Medicine King who has been dormant for a long time is finally emerging again. Let the countless immoral pharmacies feel the wrath of Master Lin!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s start a bet. How long will it take to develop the medicine? Within three days, 100 to 1. Within ten days, 10 to 1.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c^Give me the money first.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, this is great news. I love it when Master Lin does big things. I wonder what the stockpilers will think when they see this news.\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

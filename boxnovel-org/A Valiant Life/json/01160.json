Her plan had not succeeded yet. She had to keep working hard.</p><br/><p>In the room.</p><br/><p>Everyone was gathered together.</p><br/><p>As the host, Yun Xue Yao definitely had to take the lead. \u201cBrother Lin, why don\u2019t I bring you guys out to have some fun and take a look around. This is the first time that You Lan, Sister Liu, and the rest have come here. If we don\u2019t go and take a look around, it would be a shame.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d Lin Fan nodded. Since they were already here, they definitely had to enjoy themselves.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian and Zhao Zhong Yang were very excited as well. However, they were not interested in checking out the scenery at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t be going. We\u2019ll be going downstairs to play a few games later. You guys can go ahead and see the scenery,\u201d said Fraud Tian.</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang nodded as well. \u201cMy Internet buddies aren\u2019t interested in looking at the scenery. They want me to broadcast the scene at the casino, so I have to do it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan glanced at him. \u201cYou\u2019re not allowed to broadcast here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yun Xue Yao said, \u201cBrother Lin, it\u2019s fine. I will take care of it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSigh. You guys\u2026 We\u2019re out here for a vacation but you don\u2019t even want to see the local scenery. What a waste.\u201d Lin Fan shook his head. He hadn\u2019t expected that these two guys actually wanted to go to the casino to play. It really made him helpless.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy would an old man like me follow you guys? I\u2019m not going,\u201d said Fraud Tian.</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang nodded. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be a third wheel either. I\u2019m going to accompany Fraud.\u201d</p><br/><p>In the end, Lin Fan was the only guy bringing the group of ladies to see the scenery.</p><br/><p>Initially, he hadn\u2019t wanted to go either. But looking at the situation, if he were to say that he didn\u2019t want to go, things would probably turn out badly.</p><br/><p>Hence, on this afternoon, Lin Fan accompanied the ladies as they roamed around Haojiang, taking a look around the area.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Fraud Tian and Zhao Zhong Yang mixed in with the gamblers. Using the free gambling chips from Yun Xue Yao, they carefully placed their bets.</p><br/><p>Initially, Yun Xue Yao had wanted to give them more chips but Lin Fan stopped her. $20,000 per person was enough.</p><br/><p>If they managed to win, they could keep it. If they lost, then that was that.</p><br/><p>They wouldn\u2019t get any more money.</p><br/><p>Therefore, Fraud Tian only placed a very small bet each time.</p><br/><p>At the same time, he was hogging one of the seats. When those people who didn\u2019t have seats saw this flashy old man, who bet so little each time, hogging the seat, they were very displeased.</p><br/><p>However, the people sent by Yun Xue Yao took care of all of this.</p><br/><p>Hence, before long, the people in the casino all knew that these two people could not be messed with.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, in the scenic area.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan was very joyful. Jin Meng stayed by their side, helping all of them to take photos with her phone.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Lin, come here quickly! Let\u2019s take a group photo!\u201d Wu You Lan called.</p><br/><p>Lin smiled. \u201cIsn\u2019t it fine if you guys just take the photo yourselves? Why would you want a man like me in the photo?\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Xu had become less tense. \u201cJust come here already. How can a man be so slow-going?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m coming, I\u2019m coming.\u201d Lin Fan sighed helplessly.</p><br/><p>Jin Meng smiled as she said, \u201cI\u2019m going to take the photo. Make a pose!\u201d</p><br/><p>As Lin Fan stood in the middle of the group, he had no idea what kind of pose to make.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Wu You Lan clung onto Lin Fan\u2019s arm. An abundant smile spread across her face. Then, Liu Xu silently grabbed the other arm.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere am I supposed to grab?\u201d Yun Xue Yao was taken aback. Both of Lin Fan\u2019s arms had been taken. She didn\u2019t know what to do.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. \u201cJust stand normally. This is just a casual photo.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan suddenly called out, \u201cXue Yao, you can embrace Brother Lin\u2019s neck from the back. Then, we would have a nice group photo!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right!\u201d Yun Xue Yao giggled. Then, she embraced Lin Fan\u2019s neck. Her arms were placed around his neck, causing Lin Fan to almost be unable to breathe. If it hadn\u2019t been for his Wu Xia major class of knowledge, he might really get strangled to death.</p><br/><p>\u201cSay cheese!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jin Meng shouted. Everyone was in position. When Lin Fan heard that, he immediately smiled. But he was a little slow to react, so his smile turned out rather awkward.</p><br/><p>But it was still fine. The photo had been taken.</p><br/><p>Yun Xue Yao\u2019s face was slightly red. After all, she had made a rather daring move.</p><br/><p>At that moment, everyone gathered around Jin Meng to look at the photo.</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha. Brother Lin, look at your expression. That\u2019s really funny!\u201d Wu You Lan burst out laughing.</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan took a look, he felt helpless. The photo made him look bad.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, when the surrounding tourists saw this scene, they were filled with jealousy.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn. That guy is way too awesome. He actually managed to seize so many beautiful ladies.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSigh. We can\u2019t be compared to him at all. Look at the three of us. We\u2019re pitiful.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m helpless. Let\u2019s stop looking. The more I look, the sadder I feel. Those ladies are really gorgeous. What a shame that they\u2019ve already been taken by him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Since Lin Fan saw that everyone was having so much fun, he played along as well. During this holiday, he decided to just accompany them in enjoying themselves.</p><br/><p>At night, the group of them finally returned. However, when they went to look for Fraud Tian and Zhao Zhong Yang, they were rather shocked by what they saw.</p><br/><p>\u201cSpirits and deities, bless me\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The saw Fraud Tian muttering some kind of incantation. Then, he threw the gambling chips on the table and waited for the outcome.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s pretty incredible. He\u2019s been playing all this time but he\u2019s still not done. Did he increase his gambling chips?\u201d Lin Fan couldn\u2019t quite understand.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan smiled. \u201cPerhaps he won some money.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go and take a look.\u201d</p><br/><p>When they went over, they saw Fraud Tian playing happily. Moreover, his gambling chips had even increased a little. It looked like he had forty or fifty thousand dollars worth.</p><br/><p>\u201cFraud, you managed to win money?\u201d asked Lin Fan with a smile.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian turned around. \u201cYou\u2019re back?\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, as if he thought of something, he suddenly smiled proudly. \u201cLook. I\u2019ve won some money.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang, who was at the side, seemed thrilled as well. \u201cBrother Lin, I have to say that Fraud\u2019s luck is really great today. I\u2019ve already lost all my money. He ended up throwing in his money recklessly but he actually managed to win.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan felt that it was not possible. With Fraud Tian\u2019s skills, how could he win? Then, he looked at Yun Xue Yao and seemed to understand. <em>You did something, didn\u2019t you?</em></p><br/><p>Yun Xue Yao shook her head, expressing that she had no part in this. This place was regulated and it wasn\u2019t controlled by any machine.</p><br/><p>If one could win, it meant that he or she was lucky.</p><br/><p>Then, Lin Fan looked at Fraud. With one look, he saw that there was really something peculiar. Fraud Tian\u2019s luck was pretty good today. He could make some easy money today.</p><br/><p>Then, at that moment, Fraud Tian stopped placing bets. Instead, he picked up all his chips and said, \u201cLet\u2019s go. Let\u2019s go back.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cYou\u2019re not playing anymore?\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian waved his hand. \u201cI\u2019m not playing anymore. It\u2019s too intense, my heart can\u2019t take it. Since you\u2019ve all come back, there\u2019s no point in playing anymore. Let\u2019s go and eat. I\u2019m hungry.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled and nodded. \u201cToday, you\u2019ve deservedly gotten rich.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe.\u201d Fraud Tian chuckled. This easily earned money was really pretty good.</p></div>\n</div>"}

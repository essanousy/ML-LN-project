He felt that this bunch of guys was really unbridled. Lin Fan had just said something casually on the Internet but so many people were attacking him now.</p><br/><p>Moreover, the Chief of Internet trolls that Lin Fan had hired was getting a little weak. He no longer possessed the same type of ingeniousness that he had had before.</p><br/><p>The words he used were feeble and powerless and it made Lin Fan a little disappointed.</p><br/><p>Could it be that the Chief of Internet trolls had fallen in power from level nine to level one?</p><br/><p>But looking at the comments on his own Weibo, Lin Fan felt pretty good. At the very least, after so long, his fans still loved him very much.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, we support you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on exactly, I have unconditional faith in Master Lin. Even if Master Lin says that the sky is falling, I\u2019d believe it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c^This fan has already become a blind fan.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan opened his Weibo and sent a comment.</p><br/><p>\u201cDear specialists, stop explaining it to me. I really don\u2019t understand what you\u2019re all explaining. The things you\u2019re talking about produce low-quality prosthetic limbs. I\u2019m making high-end prosthetic limbs, understand?\u201d</p><br/><p>When that post was sent, it drew the rage of all those specialists. They felt that Master Lin was humiliating them.</p><br/><p>At that moment, the Internet entered an unstable situation again as a huge storm was brewing.</p><br/><p>In an instant, the war on the Internet had broken out. A group of people was in the midst of it, flaming each other.</p><br/><p>But after Lin Fan took a look, he stopped bothering about it. He decided to let the netizens flame each other for now. He didn\u2019t actually care about it at the moment.</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang stared blankly at Lin Fan. \u201cBrother Lin, you just started a war but you immediately retreated?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan felt very helpless. \u201cI didn\u2019t start a war, I just said the truth. They\u2019re the ones with fragile hearts. Just because I said something they don\u2019t like, they start flaming me. Let them battle then.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*cking awesome.\u201d Zhao Zhong Yang\u2019s eyes and mouth were gaping. He had to admire Brother Lin. Brother Lin was simply an earth-shattering supernatural being.</p><br/><p>However, Zhao Zhong Yang was very curious as to what those perfect prosthetic limbs were.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was wondering when Wang Ming Yang would finish setting up the research lab. It was really slow.</p><br/><p>The next day!</p><br/><p>The reporters were charging over indeed. Regarding the words Lin Fan had posted on the Internet, they felt that it could appear on the headlines. However, the reporters now felt very powerless.</p><br/><p>Although it could go on the headlines, there were now many people who couldn\u2019t stand Master Lin. And those words had created a big war.</p><br/><p>Many specialists were expressing their discontent on Weibo. They felt that, after working hard for so many years, they had been humiliated by those words. How could they possibly stand it?</p><br/><p>Right now, the headlines had appeared on the Internet.</p><br/><p>\u2018Master Lin wants to develop perfect prosthetic limbs.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Master Lin has become a prosthetic limb specialist and is going to release products to bring fortune to 80 million handicapped people.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018The masses of specialists express their dissatisfaction with Master Lin.\u2019</p><br/><p>Cloud Street welcomed the reporters here again. The shop owners had already become used to this scene.</p><br/><p>But when they found out that Master Lin wanted to develop prosthetic limbs, they were completely dumbfounded as well. <em>This is too awesome, isn\u2019t it? I\u2019ve never heard anything like this before.</em></p><br/><p>Lin Fan had already become skillful at handling these reporters.</p><br/><p>A reporter asked, \u201cMaster Lin, what exactly is the situation regarding those perfect prosthetic limbs you mentioned on Weibo? Are you going to develop that kind of thing?\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporters were confused. They really didn\u2019t know how that Master Lin had that kind of ability, to develop something like that. That really gave them a scare.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cYep, that\u2019s right. It\u2019s exactly as I said on Weibo. I\u2019m going to develop perfect prosthetic limbs.\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporters were stunned. \u201cMaster Lin, do you have an understanding of the knowledge in that field?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen how are you going to develop it? If you don\u2019t understand it, it\u2019s not possible, is it?\u201d a reporter asked curiously. They were very friendly to Master Lin, who was a well-known person in Shanghai.</p><br/><p>After so many incidents had happened, they couldn\u2019t help but develop a certain thought, which was that there was nothing Master Lin couldn\u2019t do.</p><br/><p>Of course, they knew that that was a blind belief. But besides that, what else could they say?</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said calmly, \u201cIt\u2019s not impossible. I have an idea. The blueprints for the perfect prosthetic limbs are already in my mind.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, the prosthetic limb specialists say that this is impossible,\u201d said a reporter.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shook his head. \u201cWhy would it be impossible? This is a very normal thing. You can\u2019t trust the words of those specialists.\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporters were startled. They hadn\u2019t expected that at all. \u201cMaster Lin, when will the final product be released?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat will have a wait. The research lab hasn\u2019t been set up yet. But once it\u2019s set up, I will be able to develop it. Alright, let\u2019s not talk about this anymore. Initially, I didn\u2019t want to reveal this so soon because I knew that people would definitely say it\u2019s impossible. Answering these questions is a complete waste of time.\u201d Lin Fan waved his hand as he didn\u2019t want to say more.</p><br/><p>To the reporters, it was simply impossible to accept this.</p><br/><p>After the reporters left, Lin Fan sighed helplessly. He had seen the situation on the Internet and it was intense.</p><br/><p>Those specialists were tirelessly saying a whole bunch of stuff on Weibo.</p><br/><p>*Ding ding!*</p><br/><p>A call from Wang Ming Yang came.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother, you\u2019re being too overbearing, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang didn\u2019t know what to say anymore. He hadn\u2019t expected his brother to talk about it on the Internet directly.</p><br/><p>It would\u2019ve been good not to talk about it. If they don\u2019t manage to develop it, they could pretend that nothing had happened. Now that it had been said, if they don\u2019t manage to develop it, they would be humiliated big time.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan: \u201cWhat\u2019s so overbearing about this? This is just a very normal thing. But I have to tell you to hurry up with your progress.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang: \u201cI got it. Even if I hurry up, it will still take some time.\u201d</p><br/><p>After hanging up, Lin Fan just waited helplessly.</p><br/><p>It seemed that he would have to be sneered at for a period of time. But fortunately, he had Internet trolls, so he was fearless.</p><br/><p>The next day!</p><br/><p>The reporters had released news about the previous day\u2019s incident.</p><br/><p>Countless netizens were completely dumbfounded when they saw Master Lin\u2019s replies.</p><br/><p><em>He can\u2019t understand it at all but he can develop it? How the heck does that make sense?</em></p><br/><p>Meanwhile, when the specialists saw the news, they started posting all sorts of criticism on Weibo.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re saying that it\u2019s a waste of time? If you ask me, you\u2019re the one wasting our time. It was really stupid of us to waste our time on someone who doesn\u2019t understand anything.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can say this confidently: He will never develop it. If he does, I\u2019ll streak in front of the reporters. I\u2019m a man of my word. I\u2019ll leave this comment here. Let\u2019s wait and see.\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

You look the same as before, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian and the others were stunned after hearing the name and seeing her face.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is Jin Shan Ping? The girl that got burned?\u201d</p><br/><p>They thought that her looks would only be improved slightly. However, they were stunned by what they saw.</p><br/><p>Were she even the same person as before?</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang was in disbelief, \u201cYou\u2019re Jin Shan Ping?\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-2\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Jin Shan Ping round it difficult to contain her emotions, \u201cYeah, I am Jin Shan Ping. I have to thank Master Lin for everything.\u201d</p><br/><p>After hearing that, Zhao Zhong Yang didn\u2019t know what to say.</p><br/><p>Unbelievable!</p><br/><p>It was really unbelievable!</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, thank you so much,\u201d Jin Shan Ping said with utmost gratitude. She immediately kneeled in front of Lin Fan without any hesitation. She said sincerely, \u201cMaster Lin, if not for you, my future would have been affected. Thank you for giving me a new life.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, the reporters quickly recorded what was happening.</p><br/><p>They were really happy for her. She recovered really quickly and she wouldn\u2019t be laughed at anymore.</p><br/><p>She could do everything like a normal human being.</p><br/><p>Jin Shan Ping kneeled to thank Master Lin and it was an understandable action. It was as if she had been given a new life. If not for Master Lin\u2019s help, Jin Shan Ping\u2019s life would probably be in shambles.</p><br/><p>Even if her results in school were really good, it would have been useless.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-3\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>That was because no company would want to hire a girl that looked like her. Even if they were to hire her, it would be out of pity. They wouldn\u2019t let her be at the forefront of the company\u2019s operations.</p><br/><p>\u201cQuick, get up. You don\u2019t have to do this. It was a simple task.\u201d Lin Fan felt a little embarrassed. Not many people had kneeled before him and it was even more embarrassing to have a lady do that.</p><br/><p>Jin Shan Ping was really grateful for Lin Fan. It couldn\u2019t be described with words.</p><br/><p>The excitement was like winning the lottery.</p><br/><p>Then, the reporters surrounded Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, may I know how you did that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCan you please tell us? We really want to know.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, that\u2019s really unbelievable. If We didn\u2019t see it with our own eyes, we wouldn\u2019t have believed it.\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporters were in horrified and shocked. They had encountered a lot of weird occurrences as reporters but they had never seen anything like this.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan thought about it for a moment but he didn\u2019t know what to say to the reporters.</p><br/><p>\u201cActually, it\u2019s not really impossible. I told you that I used the medicinal pill that I crafted to treat Jin Shan Ping.\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporters were even more curious when they heard about the medicinal pill.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-4\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, what medicinal pill is it? It is so powerful.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said calmly, \u201cI named it as The Beautifying Pill. Of course, it is very effective by it still depends on my medical skills.\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporter added, \u201cMaster Lin, does that mean that it can treat burn marks on a person\u2019s face of any severity?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTheoretically, yes. However, I need to be attending to the person. If not, it would be impossible.\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporters were stunned. They didn\u2019t expect such a medicinal pill to exist.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, may I know how you crafted the medicinal pills?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan didn\u2019t really know how to answer that question. However, since he was given the opportunity to act like he was an awesome man, he didn\u2019t want to miss it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy reporter friend, I don\u2019t really know how to answer this question of yours. Since you asked it, I\u2019ll try to answer it. Everyone knows that my medical skills are second to none. The medicinal pills require knowledge about Chinese medicine. Of course, this is entirely different from the ancient crafting of medicinal pills. It isn\u2019t what you\u2019re thinking about,\u201d Lin Fan answered.</p><br/><p>If someone dared to say that they had the best medical skills, the person would probably be flamed to death.</p><br/><p>However, as Master Lin was the one who said it, they couldn\u2019t argue about it because it was the truth.</p><br/><p>They had to accept it.</p><br/><p>Then, another reporter asked, \u201cMaster Lin, may I know if the medicinal pills will be available in the market?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shook his head, \u201cNope. It is really difficult to craft these pills and it involves a lot of steps. Furthermore, only I can do it.\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporters felt that it was a pity. However, they didn\u2019t bother too much about it. They continued to ask more questions.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-5\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin? Can you tell us why your medical skills are so good?\u201d</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan heard that, he smiled, \u201cBecause I\u2019m already an awesome individual.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian was helplessly looking at them. These reporters were actually creating the perfect environment for this fella to pretend to be awesome.</p><br/><p>He was envious and jealous.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was being pestered by the reporters until about 6 pm.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan didn\u2019t say much about it. Sometimes, it felt like a sin to be so popular.</p><br/><p>He felt that it was a really normal occurrence but the reporters felt that it was an impossible dream come true.</p><br/><p>It was an unrealistic event.</p><br/><p>He sent the reporters off.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. He felt that the day was really great.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian looked at Lin Fan, \u201cDo you feel really good?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled, \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wasn\u2019t that a stupid question? He acted like he was an awesome individual for the entire time in front of the reporters. How could he be feeling upset?</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian looked at Lin Fan grudgingly. He was really envious and jealous of him. He wondered why he didn\u2019t receive such treatment. He really wanted to be like this fella and act like he was an awesome man in front of reporters.</p><br/><p>If he could experience that once, it would have been good enough.</p><br/><p>The next day!</p><br/><p>The Internet was peaceful and quiet.</p><br/><p>The reporters hadn\u2019t posted the news online yet. It was as if they had a mutual agreement with each other about it.</p><br/><p>The poll on Weibo.</p><br/><p>There were a few million people that voted that it was impossible.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, where\u2019s the news? Why isn\u2019t there any news about it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t she dreaming? How can she recover from that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin is going to be shamed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHer injuries are so serious. If she could recover from it, it\u2019d be crazy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Those professional plastic surgeons also expressed their thoughts.</p><br/><p>Shanghai Angel Beauty Services: Considering the severity of the burns, the current technology will not be able to let her recover 100%. Our company will use other parts of her body to do a transplant for her recovery. With Jin Shan Ping\u2019s condition, we are confident of helping her recover by 50% or so.</p><br/><p>\u201c666\u2026 They\u2019re indeed a big company that has undergone professional training in Korea.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, it\u2019s a joke. Master Lin should\u2019ve done research before bragging about it. Ask, I can\u2019t believe a few hundred thousand people voted that they believe she\u2019d recover fully. I have to say that these hardcore fans are too scary.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. I\u2019ve never had a good impression of Master Lin. He\u2019s too arrogant. He thinks that nothing is impossible for him. Look at the situation now. It\u2019s impossible for him to brag about it anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>Those that always supported Master Lin hadn\u2019t come out to speak about it yet. They were curious as to why there was no follow up to the matter.</p><br/><p>A new headline also appeared on Weibo.</p><br/><p>\u2018Master Lin, you should stop with your bragging.\u2019</p><br/><p>Although it didn\u2019t manage to enter the trending list, it was still one of the top five most popular news.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p></div>\n</div>"}

This time, the teaching materials were distributed just in time. Perhaps he would be able to complete the task soon.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Lil\u2019 Fatty became the first person in the Children\u2019s Welfare Institute to use the little intelligence pill. Who knew what kind of changes would happen?</p><br/><p>There were numerous good things in the Encyclopedia\u2019s Department Store. Just looking at them made Lin Fan want to get them. However, in order to complete the task, he had to resist the urge. Just 3000 more Encyclopedic Points and he would be done.</p><br/><p>Cloud Street!</p><br/><p>Lin Fan would pay attention to the trend of his Encyclopedic Points every day. It kept increasing bit by bit and to him, every bit was very exciting to observe.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid something happen lately, Brother Lin? Why are you so happy?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan had realized that something had been off about Brother Lin lately. It seemed as if some kind of great and joyous event had happened. He had been smiling cheerfully all the time as if he had come across something that made him happy.</p><br/><p>Why was he so happy? Of course, he couldn\u2019t tell them. Even if he told them, no one would believe him.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t you heard before that being happy frequently makes you live a little longer? That\u2019s why I have to smile a little every day.\u201d Lin Fan felt that he sounded a little stupid. Who would believe such a reason?</p><br/><p>Elder Dog Nicholas had been laying there the whole time. Then, he raised his head and laughed with his teeth baring. However, a dog laughing looked as comical as anything could be.</p><br/><p>Elder Dog had become smart. It was the effect of the little intelligence pill.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan gazed at him. \u201cElder Dog, don\u2019t laugh. Once you laugh, your saliva starts splattering all around. Quickly go and find your dog wife, don\u2019t let her be snatched away.\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Dog glared at Lin Fan and barked a few times to express his displeasure. However, he still lay there like a good dog and gazed afar.</p><br/><p>*Da da*</p><br/><p>The sound of high heels rapidly hitting the ground could be heard. A beautiful scene appeared before everyone.</p><br/><p>When Wu You Lan saw who had come, a smile appeared on her face as she went forward. \u201cLiu Xu, why are you here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Xu glanced at Lin Fan before fixing her gaze on Wu You Lan. \u201cI came to issue you an invitation. I bought a hotel in Shanghai and I want to invite you to attend our opening ceremony.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWow!\u201d Wu You Lan was astonished. She had a pretty good family background, especially because Wu Tian He\u2019s fortune-telling was so godly. Over in Lianzhou, they had been distinguished guests of countless influential officials. Naturally, she wouldn\u2019t be shocked in the face of a little wealth and power. However, Liu Xu had just bought a hotel as she liked. This made Wu You Lan a little shocked.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou really bought it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Xu nodded. When her smile burst forth, it was emotionally moving. \u201cOf course. Didn\u2019t I say that I would establish myself in Shanghai? It\u2019s more because a certain someone isn\u2019t true to his word, so I can\u2019t leave Shanghai.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was a little speechless. This Brother Qiang Qiang was biting him and not letting go. She was really establishing herself in Shanghai.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan smiled awkwardly. Naturally, she knew about the situation between Liu Xu and Brother Lin. But she never thought that Liu Xu would do that.</p><br/><p>Initially, she had been a little afraid about whether Liu Xu would make her girlfriend but later on, she stopped worrying. As long as she stayed true to her original intention, she would be fine.</p><br/><p>Her goal was to be together with Brother Lin.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, right. I even invited someone to perform at the event.\u201d Liu Xu smiled mysteriously. Her eyes were fixed on Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan felt a little helpless. What did inviting someone have anything to do with him? But when Liu Xu said that person\u2019s name, he lost his cool.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe popular celebrity singer, Wu Huan Yue,\u201d said Liu Xu, \u201cThe opening ceremony has to be grand. And Wu Huan Yue is a celebrity singer from Shanghai too. Inviting her to perform is a pretty good choice.\u201d</p><br/><p>F*ck!,</p><br/><p>Lin Fan felt that this Liu Xu was trying to eliminate all of the people close to him in one fell swoop. She didn\u2019t give him a chance to retaliate at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s her\u2026\u201d When Wu You Lan heard that name, she felt a little unpleasant. That was her strongest competitor for Brother Lin.</p><br/><p>Especially because Wu Huan Yue was now a celebrity, it was as if she had a certain splendor to her. Perhaps Wu You Lan wasn\u2019t even a worthy competitor.</p><br/><p>However, Wu You Lan was always by Lin Fan\u2019s side. That should have given her an edge.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Wu You Lan started thinking ridiculous thoughts.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan sighed. His expression was strange. \u201cLiu Xu, is there a need for that? You should try to understand this situation.</p><br/><p>Liu Xu smiled, \u201cGodly Doctor Lin, what do you mean by that? There are no hard feelings between us. I just want to establish myself in Shanghai. Is that not okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cOf course that\u2019s fine. You are very welcome to do that.\u201d</p><br/><p>However, he was cursing in his heart. Welcome my a*s. This lady had bad intentions and something was definitely going to happen.</p><br/><p>But really, this Liu Xu, after regaining her female style, was really beautiful. It was something that Wu You Lan, a young little flower, couldn\u2019t compare to. Her demeanor and her mannerism were releasing an aura of maturity. It was very attractive.</p><br/><p>Her wavy, long hair, her fiery red lips and especially her leather clothing, were really something else.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan asked, \u201cWill Brother Lin be going as well?\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Xu said, \u201cI only gave you an invitation. If the Godly Doctor wants to go, he can go on his own. Although I can\u2019t give him an invitation, he is still very welcome.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCheh,\u201d Lin Fan grumbled in his heart. Why would he want to go? Even if she invited him, he wouldn\u2019t go. He would rather save himself the trouble.</p><br/><p>After Liu Xu left, Wu You Lan went to Lin Fan\u2019s side and smiled cheerily, \u201cBrother Lin, when will the misunderstanding between you and Sister Liu Xu be resolved?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cWhat misunderstanding is there between us? She just keeps wanting to trouble me. Think about it. For a male to turn into a female is simple. But for a female to turn to a male, where would you find something like that? Don\u2019t you think so?? And look how good she is now. She\u2019s not just not thanking me but she even wants to deliberately cause trouble for me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan pouted. \u201cSister Liu Xu isn\u2019t causing trouble for you. But Brother Lin, what you just said is really bad. If Sister Liu Xu had heard that, she would probably start quarreling with you again.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut are you really not going?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved his hand and said, \u201cI\u2019ll see when the time comes. If I\u2019m in a good mood, I\u2019ll go take a look. If not, then I won\u2019t go.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan smiled, \u201cBrother Lin, if you don\u2019t go, I\u2019d be very bored.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, Fraud Tian sneakily leaned over with a look of eagerness on his face. \u201cCan I go?\u201d</p><br/><p>Before Lin Fan could open his mouth, Wu You Lan shook her head and said, \u201cYou can\u2019t go.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian sighed, \u201cSigh, you\u2019re too cold. Back then, I\u2019ve fought everyone in the cities and in the countrysides and I was unmatched. There were countless people who would invite me to ceremonies. But now, sigh\u2026I shan\u2019t say it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone couldn\u2019t help but start laughing. But Lin Fan knew that this Fraud Tian was thinking about his past once again.</p><br/><p>Afterward.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan gave Wang Ming Yang a call.</p><br/><p>\u201cMing Yang, how could you agree to Liu Xu and allow Wu Huan Yue to do a commercial performance at her opening?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang, \u201cHuh? What is it? Are you on bad terms with her? She offered a pretty high price. I thought it would be a waste not to earn this money, so I agreed. Is there a problem? If there is, I will back out now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need. Since you\u2019ve already agreed, then just stick to it.\u201d</p><br/><p>After hanging up, Lin Fan shook his head. This Liu Xu\u2019s ability to gather information was quite amazing. She actually found out that Lin Fan knew Wu Huan Yue.</p><br/><p>And she had come to his shop today, seemingly to tell him to watch out. Otherwise, everyone close to him would be eliminated in one fell swoop.</p><br/><p>This kind of opponent couldn\u2019t be ignored.</p><br/><p>Although she was a little lady, she was very dangerous.</p></div>\n</div>"}

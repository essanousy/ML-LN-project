She looked left and right while all the guests directed their gazes at her.</p><br/><p>After all, such a beautiful lady with such an imposing and cold demeanor had appeared. Naturally, she would draw attention.</p><br/><p>To them, she looked like something out of a television show.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou Lan.\u201d Liu Xu slowly strode over in her high heels.</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan heard that voice, his brows raised as he felt that something wasn\u2019t right. When he saw who it was, he was startled. \u201cWhy are you here?\u201d</p><br/><p>This time, he had really just said it directly. He didn\u2019t even think twice because it really didn\u2019t make sense.</p><br/><p>Why would Liu Xu come here? Lin Fan didn\u2019t have much of a relationship with Liu Xu. Whenever they met, they would just make some cutting remarks at each other. Now that she had come, Lin Fan felt that something wasn\u2019t right.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t I come? I\u2019m here to celebrate Uncle\u2019s birthday. Is something wrong with that?\u201d Liu Xu looked at Lin Fan and replied calmly.</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan\u2019s mom saw this, she was a little dazed as well. She had been very happy when only Wu You Lan had come.</p><br/><p>But now that another lady had arrived, she felt that it wasn\u2019t quite right.</p><br/><p><em>Could it be that my son is a two-timer? </em>Now that the two ladies had met, if they were to start fighting, this birthday party would be ruined.</p><br/><p>But looking at the situation, it seemed that this second lady knew You Lan.</p><br/><p>Liu Xu went in front of Lin Fan\u2019s dad and took out a present. Although no one knew what was inside the gift box, it did not look like something cheap at all. \u201cUncle, happy birthday to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan\u2019s dad immediately looked at Lin Fan\u2019s mom as if asking for her opinion. She nodded at him. Since this lady had brought a gift, how could he reject it?</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, thank you. Thank you.\u201d Lin Fan\u2019s dad nodded stiffly. He was about to place the present to the side but Liu Xu saw the watch on his wrist and couldn\u2019t help but say, \u201cUncle, that watch that you\u2019re wearing doesn\u2019t quite suit you. Why don\u2019t you try mine?\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Xu skillfully opened the gift and took out a luxurious-looking watch. With one look, you could tell that it wasn\u2019t cheap.</p><br/><p>Huang Ting, who had been sitting at the side all along, looked a little awkward.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan\u2019s dad quickly waved his hand. \u201cGirl, I can\u2019t change my watch now. This was given to me by my classmate.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Liu Xu heard that, of course she knew what was going on. Then, she chuckled. \u201cAlright. Then I hope you may swap your watch once in a while in the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, okay\u2026\u201d Lin Fan\u2019s dad nodded, not knowing what else to say.</p><br/><p>Huang Yun Ge was already dazed. <em>What is up with that kid? Why are these ladies so beautiful?</em></p><br/><p><em>One of them is pure and innocent while the other is cold and elegant. He really knows how to play around.</em></p><br/><p><em>A real ladies man. I have to give in to him in this aspect.</em></p><br/><p>Huang Yun Ge admitted himself that he had been with many beautiful ladies but those ladies he had been with could never match up to these two. To be with these two ladies was basically winning at life.</p><br/><p>\u201cDad, your classmate\u2019s son is really not simple. These two ladies have both come and they can even get along peacefully. This is something that most people wouldn\u2019t be able to do,\u201d said Huang Yun Ge. Then, he sighed. \u201cI\u2019ve misjudged him. I really have. Although your classmate\u2019s son may not have much money, his capability is something that I cannot match up to.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Huang Ting heard his son\u2019s words, he gradually became more embarrassed. He felt as if his old classmate had changed.</p><br/><p>Both the current situation and what had happened previously had left him confused. He couldn\u2019t link his current impression of his old classmate with the impression that he had had in the past.</p><br/><p>He even felt an urge to leave the place.</p><br/><p>However, if he left now, it would probably be hard for his old classmate to accept. <em>Forget it. I\u2019ll wait for a bit.</em></p><br/><p>Lin Fan couldn\u2019t understand the situation anymore. He could understand why Wu You Lan would come but, as for Liu Xu, he couldn\u2019t understand at all.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Liu Xu\u2019s red lips drew close to Lin Fan\u2019s ear. \u201cMaster Lin, I\u2019m returning you a favor this time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was silent. <em>What kind of favor is this?</em></p><br/><p>In the guests\u2019 eyes, this beautiful lady\u2019s relationship with the Lin Family son was not average at all. She was biting his ear in front of everyone. They were way too intimate.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan\u2019s mom was a little embarrassed. She looked over at Wu You Lan. <em>What is my son doing? There\u2019s another lady just beside. Is it really alright for you to act so intimately in front of everyone?</em></p><br/><p>But what she couldn\u2019t understand was that You Lan wasn\u2019t angry at all. Instead, she smiled cheerily. This left Lin Fan\u2019s mom completely dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>Suddenly!</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>Another voice came from behind. This voice was filled with cheer and joy.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan\u2019s fingers trembled. This voice was a little foreign but also quite familiar. When he saw who it was, he was startled once again.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yun Xue Yao, the lady of Hao Jiang\u2019s Yun Family.</p><br/><p>It was as if he had seen a f*cking ghost today. <em>Why are they all coming here one by one?</em></p><br/><p>Yun Xue Yao saw Lin Fan and immediately walked over with a bright smile. Then, she patted her chest. \u201cI was supposed to reach here much earlier but because I\u2019m not familiar with Zhongzhou, I took a long time to find this place.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then she looked to the side. She immediately greeted respectfully, \u201cHello Auntie. Hello Uncle.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan\u2019s mom was stunned. But since the opposite party was greeting her, she nodded back. \u201cHello, hello\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yun Xue Yao went in front of Lin Fan\u2019s dad and took out a present. \u201cUncle, happy birthday. This is a gift that I picked for you. I hope you like it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Her voice was very sweet and the smile on her face was very lush.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan\u2019s dad looked at this beautiful girl in front of him, then at Lin Fan\u2019s mom as if asking for her opinion once again. <em>Should I accept it or not?</em></p><br/><p>Lin Fan\u2019s mom nodded, indicating for him to accept it. Then, she looked at Lin Fan as she appeared to be at a loss. She didn\u2019t know what was going on at all.</p><br/><p><em>There are three now!</em></p><br/><p><em>What is your mom supposed to do?</em></p><br/><p>Huang Yun Gang\u2019s mouth gaped as he saw this. His whole body felt stiff as if he couldn\u2019t react to the situation at all.</p><br/><p>To him, this guy was like a god. He was probably a god of picking up girls and Huang Yun Gang had to admit defeat.</p><br/><p>Three gorgeous ladies had come and they actually weren\u2019t quarreling at all. How the heck had he managed to do this?</p><br/><p>Huang Yun Ge even felt an urge to kneel down to Lin Fan and become his disciple in order to study his skills of charming girls.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan felt that this couldn\u2019t go on. Otherwise, it would cause unnecessary misunderstanding.</p><br/><p>\u201cMom, Dad, actually\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>Before he could finish, a crisp voice echoed from the banquet hall entrance.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, the guests\u2019 jaws had all dropped as they started murmuring amongst themselves.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn. Elder Lin\u2019s son is crazy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. He has attracted too many young ladies, hasn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan took a deep breath before turning his gaze towards the entrance.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuan Yue, why are you here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p></div>\n</div>"}

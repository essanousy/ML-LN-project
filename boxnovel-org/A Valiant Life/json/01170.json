Then, she gave her chips back to Yun Xue Yao before standing at the side and watching Fraud Tian and the rest play.</p><br/><p>Liu Xu stopped playing as well. She had been winning and then losing again and again so she felt that it was quite pointless.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Zhao Zhong Yang and Fraud Tian still hadn\u2019t gotten tired. In the end, Fraud Tian gave a long and helpless sigh.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve lost everything.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian was depressed. He had been winning at first but then he suddenly lost a few gambles consecutively.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve lost it all already?\u201d Lin Fan grinned. \u201cDon\u2019t think about it. If it\u2019s meant to be, it will be. If it\u2019s not, then it\u2019s not. It\u2019s useless even if you think about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian felt helpless. \u201cIf I knew, I wouldn\u2019t have played. I didn\u2019t think that I would lose it all in one go. That\u2019s really painful.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang said, \u201cI told you. If you shared some of your money with me, you might have won. But you didn\u2019t believe me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCheh. Even if I gave it to you, you would have lost. It\u2019s better if I lose myself,\u201d Fraud Tian retorted.</p><br/><p>Then, they headed back to the hotel.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Fraud Tian and Zhao Zhong Yang kept on quarrelling on the way back.</p><br/><p>Several days later.</p><br/><p>The vacation was coming to an end.</p><br/><p>At the airport.</p><br/><p>Yun Xue Yao couldn\u2019t bear to see them leave. She hadn\u2019t made any concrete progress in these few days, but she had been very happy. It was an indescribable sense of joy.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, beautiful Haojiang, I\u2019m leaving! You\u2019ve taken away my money,\u201d Fraud Tian sighed at the entrance of the airport. He felt an indescribable pain in his heart.</p><br/><p>These days had been like a roller coaster ride for him. He really couldn\u2019t take it anymore.</p><br/><p>Although those gambling chips had all been from Yun Xue Yao, those he had won had been his own.</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang looked into the distance. \u201cIt\u2019s exciting and fun but my heart can\u2019t take it. The next time I come, I\u2019ll only bring a few thousand dollars. I can\u2019t take it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cXue Yao, we\u2019ve troubled you these few days. You haven\u2019t even had time to work.\u201d</p><br/><p>For these few days, Yun Xue Yao had been accompanying them and she hadn\u2019t even been able to work. She didn\u2019t just pay for their meals but also for their fun.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian hadn\u2019t paid a single cent for his gambling chips. Instead, Yun Xue Yao had paid for all of it.</p><br/><p>Those two guys had used used up all of those chips.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot at all. I\u2019m really glad that you\u2019ve come to visit. You should all come back to play again next time,\u201d said Yun Xue Yao.</p><br/><p>She was about to send them off at the airport. She couldn\u2019t quite bear it. It felt as if something important to her was about to be taken away.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan placed a hand on Yun Xue Yao\u2019s shoulder. \u201cXue Yao, when will you come to Shanghai? I\u2019ll definitely host you well when you come to Shanghai.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yun Xue Yao smiled. \u201cWhen I have the time, I\u2019ll come and look for you guys in Shanghai.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Xu said, \u201cXue Yao, thank you so much for hosting us.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis time, we\u2019ve really visited many places in Haojiang. We\u2019ve pretty much gone everywhere. If it weren\u2019t for you bringing us around, it would only have been a dream,\u201d said Lin Fan with a smile. This trip had been pretty good. They had managed to see many places.</p><br/><p>Everyone nodded. They were all very satisfied. They felt that this vacation had been a lot of fun.</p><br/><p>But Lin Fan was depressed to leave as well. It was a complicated feeling and he couldn\u2019t quite take it.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, it\u2019s about time. We\u2019ll be going in now. You guys can go back now, Xue Yao.\u201d Lin Fan looked at the time. It was almost time to board.</p><br/><p>\u201cGoodbye.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan and the rest waved at Xue Yao as they walked into the departure area.</p><br/><p>Yun Xue Yao stood there, waving her hand. Her eyes started to well up.</p><br/><p>Jin Meng stood at the side. Seeing her best friend start to tear up, she was taken aback. \u201cXue Yao, what\u2019s up with you? Are you really crying?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSigh. I don\u2019t know when we\u2019ll see each other again. I can\u2019t bear it,\u201d said Yun Xue Yao sadly.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think too much. It\u2019s not like we\u2019re living in the past when it took forever to travel to another place. Travelling is so simple now. If you want to see them, it would only take a few hours,\u201d Jin Meng said with a smile.</p><br/><p>However, she knew that her best friend had fallen in love this time. And she had fallen very deep.</p><br/><p>At the same time, the difficulty level was on hell mode. It was extremely difficult for something to happen out of this.</p><br/><p>Yun Xue Yao nodded as she stood there staring. Then, she sighed and said, \u201cLet\u2019s go. When I have the time, I\u2019ll go to Shanghai.\u201d</p><br/><p>In the airport.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan, Fraud Tian, and the rest were carrying several luggage bags. They were quite heavy since they were all filled with local products that had been prepared by Yun Xue Yao. As they had been leaving, she had given these to them.</p><br/><p>\u201cXue Yao is too courteous. She not only brought us around to play, but she even bought so many things for us to bring back.\u201d Fraud Tian was delighted. He felt that this vacation had been pretty good.</p><br/><p>It had been a terrific experience.</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang was carrying several bags. \u201cYeah. Let\u2019s hurry up and check these in. I can\u2019t hold these much longer.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cWhat kind of man are you? You can\u2019t even hold a few bags? Sigh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Lin, you and Fraud Tian are both Kung Fu practitioners. How can I compare to you?\u201d said Zhao Zhong Yang helplessly. He was the weakest man among the three.</p><br/><p>Even an old man was stronger than him. He didn\u2019t even know what to say.</p><br/><p>When the luggage had been checked in, Zhao Zhong Yang let out a deep breath. It had finally been taken care of.</p><br/><p>The next day!</p><br/><p>Cloud Street!</p><br/><p>The had returned to Shanghai the previous day and gone back to their own homes to rest. After all, they were all quite tired.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn. Who is this? Is that you, Fraud?\u201d Elder Liang was eating his breakfast and drinking his soy milk when he saw Fraud Tian dressed in his flashy clothing. He almost spat out his soy milk.</p><br/><p>He was dumbfounded. Was he seeing a ghost?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, Elder Liang? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d Fraud Tian said in a slightly displeased tone. <em>This guy almost spat out his soy milk when he saw me. Does he have a problem with me?</em></p><br/><p>Elder Liang quickly wiped his mouth. He was stunned. \u201cNo, no. Fraud, what are you doing, dressing like that? Are you acting in a play?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you know? This is fashion. Haven\u2019t you seen the news recently? That person on the news is me,\u201d said Fraud Tian. He felt that these guys really didn\u2019t understand fashion. They were worlds apart from him.</p><br/><p>Walking on the forefront of the fashion trend, he realized that he had great potential.</p><br/><p>Thinking about how he used to dress, he felt that it was really ugly.</p><br/><p>If he had discovered this earlier, perhaps he would have been an international fashion star. He wouldn\u2019t have had to read fortunes on the bridge.</p><br/><p>Elder Liang was completely dumbfounded. He wondered what on earth Fraud Tian had gone through to have changed so drastically.</p><br/><p>He had changed so much that he was barely recognizable.</p></div>\n</div>"}

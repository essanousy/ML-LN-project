Do you know who made this mess? Since our Chinese Arts Association\u2019s establishment, no one has ever said that our competitions are corrupted. That guy is really arrogant, to even scold the judges,\u201d said one of the employees angrily.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d When Director Chen heard this, he said, \u201cThat guy even dares to scold the judges? D*mn it, I have to see what this guy is up to.\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Chen, filled with rage, went on Weibo. When he saw the discussion, he was completely dumbfounded. This guy was really too despicable.</p><br/><p>\u201cDirector Chen, what do we do now?\u201d asked the employee.</p><br/><p>Director Chen said, \u201cWhat do you mean \u2018what do we do\u2019? Of course, we have to clarify ourselves on the website. What do they know? These drawings have been judged by several teachers. How could those people who don\u2019t even understand Chinese arts know better than our masters?\u201d</p><br/><p>The employee nodded. That indeed made sense. No matter what, the important thing now was to quickly clarify themselves. They couldn\u2019t let things continue in the current direction. If things were to continue this way, the outcome of the association would probably be terrible.</p><br/><p>The Internet was now already in a ruckus.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy hasn\u2019t the Chinese Arts Association come out to speak yet? There\u2019s clearly a problem with these two drawings. The awards should be reversed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCheh. I feel like Master Lin is the one who\u2019s corrupted. Everyone in his Nanshan Children\u2019s Welfare Institute received awards. If you think about it, it\u2019s definitely not possible.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat the person above said makes a bit of sense. Anyway, I\u2019m just a spectator. I\u2019ll sit here and see how things turn out.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>At that moment, the Chinese Arts Association came out to clarify themselves on the Internet.</p><br/><p>Chinese Arts Association: \u201cRegarding the corruption accusation on the Internet, we guarantee that there is absolutely no such thing. The teachers who judged the Youth Chinese Arts Cup are all cornerstones of the Chinese arts world. People who don\u2019t understand Chinese arts can only see the outer appearance of the drawings. As for masters, they look at the meaning and inner qualities\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>This explanation made everyone a little stunned. They didn\u2019t know who to believe.</p><br/><p>Many netizens quickly went to comment on Lin Fan\u2019s Weibo page, \u201cMaster Lin, what should we say now? The association has come out to clear themselves, saying that we don\u2019t understand. We really don\u2019t understand but what do you think of this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy do I keep feeling as if something isn\u2019t right? But I can\u2019t really figure out what it is.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI still believe Master Lin. I\u2019ve been humiliated before in the past. I now trust Master Lin unconditionally.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Can\u2019t you guys have your own opinions? I think that the association is right about this. Even the experts have spoken, what problems could there be?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCheh. Master Lin is an expert too, okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Lin Fan: \u201cChinese Arts Association, could you guys be a little less shameless? Alright, you were talking about inner qualities, right? Then let me slowly tell you. This drawing of mountain water\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan immediately explained the difference between the two drawings in detail. If the opposition still decided to be shameless, Lin Fan would really be furious.</p><br/><p>This matter had caused a very heated debate.</p><br/><p>The Youth Chinese Arts Cup had originally been just a small competition. It wouldn\u2019t have drawn much attention.</p><br/><p>However, after the two sides, Master Lin and the Chinese Arts Association, started arguing, the Internet had erupted as well.</p><br/><p>Even some people who didn\u2019t know anything joined in.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho is this Master Lin? Is he an expert? The masters from the Chinese Arts Association have already spoken, what is he still arguing about?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. One mustn\u2019t be too greedy. You\u2019ve already taken all of the second prizes but you still want the first prize. That\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck. Qingzhou citizen here. Who dares to bully our Master Lin? Do you want to die?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m a Qingzhou citizen too. Corruption is corruption. Don\u2019t try to defend it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cQingzhou dogs are here. They\u2019re protecting their owner.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan saw these comments on the Internet, he couldn\u2019t help but shake his head. He had never thought that\u2026sigh\u2026</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan cried out angrily, \u201cHow can they be so shameless?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cInitially, I thought that the Chinese Arts Association was a good place. Because of Elder Zheng, I joined this association. Now, it seems like things are not as I thought. I quit.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Fraud Tian was taken aback. \u201cDon\u2019t be too rash, kid. Why don\u2019t you give the Chinese Arts Association President a call?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved his hand. \u201cNo need. Now that I think about it, this Chinese Arts Association is even worse than the Chinese Martial Arts Association.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Chen looked at the situation online and laughed coldly. This wasn\u2019t something that the opposition could win by saying a few words. Chinese Arts Association would always have their way. Even if those Chinese arts masters on the Internet saw that something was wrong, they wouldn\u2019t dare to say it unless they wanted to go against the Chinese Arts Association.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Xiao Chen started typing on the keyboard. He felt that he had to do something, otherwise, he wouldn\u2019t be able to face himself.</p><br/><p>Chinese Arts Association Official: \u201cAccording to our investigations, there has been a dispute about the second prize winner, Lil\u2019 Fatty\u2019s artwork. Hence, his second prize will be temporarily revoked. After the various Chinese arts masters analyze things, the name list will be decided once again. Everyone, please trust us. The Chinese Arts Association does things fairly. There is definitely no corruption\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck! This move is too savage, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><br/><p>When the netizens who supported Master Lin saw this, they instantly exploded in rage. Lil\u2019 Fatty had been removed from the second prize winners list. That was too harsh. It was completely a show of their authority.</p><br/><p>Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey\u2019re absolutely ridiculous!\u201d Wu You Lan was red with anger from seeing this Weibo post.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian said, \u201cF*ck, I can\u2019t take this anymore. I want to go there and kill them. I\u2019ll let them know how powerful Ba Gua Zhang is.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, everyone looked at Lin Fan. They were wondering what Lin Fan would do. The opposite party was being completely unreasonable.</p><br/><p>Even if they said they were letting masters analyze it, it was needless to say that Lil\u2019 Fatty would lose his prize.</p><br/><p>*clatter*</p><br/><p>Lin Fan opened his drawer. He took out his Chinese Arts Association Senior Member ID and furiously tore it in half before slamming it onto the table.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian and the rest knew that Lin Fan was angry. And he wasn\u2019t just a little angry.</p><br/><p>Weibo.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan: \u201cAs a Chinese Arts Association Member, I\u2019ve seen today the under-the-table manipulations that happen in the association. The winners of the competition aren\u2019t decided based on the artworks but decided based on various underhanded means. From this day onwards, I quit the association and I will no longer be part of the Chinese Arts Association.\u201d</p><br/><p>When this post and the photo were uploaded, everyone cried out in shock.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck, Master Lin was a member of the Chinese Arts Association?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat can\u2019t be. I know that Master Lin knows how to draw Chinese art but I never thought that he was a member. This situation isn\u2019t quite right.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCould it be that the association didn\u2019t know that Master Lin was their own member?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Chinese Arts Association.</p><br/><p>When Director Chen saw this Weibo post, his expression slowly changed. He felt that something was wrong.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, in another conference room.</p><br/><p>Zheng Zhong Shan looked at the crowd below him. \u201cEveryone, a month from now, it will be time for Chinese arts to step out into the world. Right now, we need thirty artworks to be used as exhibition artworks. This time, it\u2019s not just about our Chinese Arts Association. This is about fighting for our nation\u2019s glory. We must all work hard.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yue Qiu Ju Shi said, \u201cElder Zheng, I think that we should invite Elder Lin over to produce an artwork. Just one artwork from Elder Lin would definitely shock the world.\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Zheng said, \u201cThat\u2019s for sure. After this conference ends, I\u2019ll give him a call.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yue Qiu Ju Shi said, \u201cThere\u2019s no need to wait until the conference ends, I\u2019ll call him right now. He\u2019s a member of our association. Besides him, no one else is competent enough for this task.\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

This time, you guys pretended to ask me to return to the association. I think you came for something else.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zheng Zhong Shan couldn\u2019t tolerate it after hearing that. Wasn\u2019t he trying to malign him? He immediately stood up, \u201cElder Lin, you can scold or hit me but you can\u2019t humiliate me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t humiliate you.\u201d Lin Fan was a little confused. However, he was laughing in his heart as he saw Elder Zheng\u2019s anxious face.</p><br/><p>Usually, people who knew Elder Zheng wouldn\u2019t dare to treat him with so much disrespect.</p><br/><p>Elder Zheng wouldn\u2019t act this way to an average person too. This form of interaction was only possible between close friends.</p><br/><p>If it was seen by others, they would probably be stunned.</p><br/><p>Zheng Zhong Shan said seriously, \u201cThe three of us came to mainly ask you to return to the association. It wasn\u2019t because of any stupid reason. You\u2019re definitely more important than that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, yeah!\u201d Yue Qiu Ju Shi and Tao Shi Gang nodded in agreement with Elder Zheng\u2019s explanation.</p><br/><p>*giggle*</p><br/><p>Lin Fan couldn\u2019t take it and he started laughing, \u201cAlright, alright. Those that don\u2019t understand you would probably think all of you are insincere. I won\u2019t say anything more about this matter. Tell me about the Chinese Arts incident then.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, I knew our Elder Lin isn\u2019t a narrow-minded person. If anyone said that Elder Lin was a narrow-minded person, he would be destroyed in front of me. Wouldn\u2019t he be humiliating our Elder Lin?\u201d Zheng Zhong Shan was smiling from ear to ear.</p><br/><p>Yue Qiu Ju Shi and Tao Shi Gang looked at Elder Zheng in disbelief. Wasn\u2019t he the one that said Elder Lin was narrow-minded?</p><br/><p>However, at least things were okay now. That \u2018incident\u2019 wasn\u2019t considered to be one anymore.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, alright. Don\u2019t play dumb anymore. Do you think I can\u2019t see through your tricks? I think the only person that would say that I\u2019m narrow-minded is Elder Zheng,\u201d Lin Fan chuckled.</p><br/><p>Zheng Zhong Shan felt like he was being maligned, \u201cForget it. I\u2019ll just take one for the team then. Actually, this international exhibition doesn\u2019t involve us. After all, the most popular form of artwork overseas is oil painting. However, I didn\u2019t expect the fella from the Japanese arts industry to say that Chinese Arts isn\u2019t qualified to be on stage. He said that it\u2019s all trash and even if we were to join the international exhibition, we\u2019d be at the bottom. Look, do you think I can tolerate that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFurthermore, that isn\u2019t it. Those fellas from the Korean arts industry are really arrogant. They said that our Chinese Arts came from them. They said they\u2019ll show us the true Chinese Arts. Do you think I can tolerate those words? Of course I can\u2019t tolerate it. In the past, I carried guns\u2026 Forget it, I\u2019ll not talk about it anymore. It\u2019s peacetime now. I won\u2019t say these words to ruin the atmosphere here.\u201d Elder Zheng was furious but he finally calmed himself down.</p><br/><p>Yue Qiu Ju Shi and Tao Shi Gang sat aside and looked like they wouldn\u2019t give up unless they prove themselves.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at them in doubt, \u201cCan you guys be honest? Why do I feel like it\u2019s fake?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zheng Zhong Shan coughed gently, \u201cI just exaggerated it a bit but I swear that the meaning is there. We can lose to anyone on the international scene but the Japanese and Koreans. The older generation of artists didn\u2019t just draw to pass time. We draw to prove ourselves during important moments like this. We have to prove the might of our country so that the citizens would be proud of the country\u2019s national treasures. Therefore, I really hope that Brother Lin can represent us and crush them with your artwork.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you done?\u201d Lin Fan looked at Zheng Zhong Shan and asked. Elder Zheng kept talking about doing the nation proud and it was hard to resist.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m done,\u201d Zheng Zhong Shan nodded and felt that he said it with gusto. If someone else were to hear his words, he would definitely promise to do the nation proud of him. However, why was Brother Lin so calm about it? That seemed a little weird.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded, \u201cAlright, since Elder Zheng is here personally, if I were to reject you, I wouldn\u2019t be giving you any face. I don\u2019t want to wake up to an army of troops. Isn\u2019t that scary?\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Zheng was a little embarrassed, \u201cElder Lin, how can you think of it that way? My power is to be used to protect my good friends, not to destroy them. However, I really just want you to draw a good artwork to show them. But I think you look really energetic, how many are you prepared to draw?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled and asked, \u201cHow many do you want me to draw?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zheng Zhong Shan and the others looked at each other. It was as if they were asking each other, \u201cShould we get one for ourselves too?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan realized what they were hinting at and he was furious. He immediately started shouting at them.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe three of you, don\u2019t be too greedy. One for each of you? Do you want me to die from anger? I\u2019ll probably give nine or ten pieces,\u201d Lin Fan said after thinking about it. He felt that the number of artworks wasn\u2019t that bad. Furthermore, in order to boost his reputation, he had to choose the best artworks. The average ones couldn\u2019t match up to the others.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d The three of them were stunned when they heard his reply. They asked in disbelief, \u201cElder Lin, how many did you say? 10?\u201d</p><br/><p>The three of them looked pretty unhappy. Lin Fan glared at them, \u201cDon\u2019t be too greedy. Ten pieces of artwork is good enough. If I were to draw anymore, it\u2019d be too many.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zheng Zhong Shan waved his hand anxiously and hugged Lin Fan involuntarily, \u201cElder Lin, I, Elder Zheng, has never been impressed by anyone before. But today, I am extremely impressed by you. You are a God in my eyes. Ten pieces of artwork\u2026 I think all of them would be blown away by your skills.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, they looked like they were about to cry. They just wanted an artwork initially but they didn\u2019t expect Elder Lin to be so generous. He immediately said that he would draw ten artworks. They were ecstatic and couldn\u2019t wait for it.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan pushed Elder Zheng aside, \u201cWhen do you need it by?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn a month\u2019s time. But we have to get them fifteen days earlier from you to send them to the gallery. Do you have enough time?\u201d Elder Zheng asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cFifteen days?\u201d Lin Fan hesitated for a moment. Then, he nodded, \u201cYeah, there\u2019s enough time. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSlow and steady.\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

The screen showed it just now, really! You have to believe me!\u201d</p><br/><p>The bank worker heaved a huge sigh. \u201cMadam, can you not kid with us? We are very busy right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat I\u2019m saying is the truth! If you don\u2019t believe me, just take a look.\u201d The middle-aged lady tried to send the money over to the same bank account again, pointing at the screen.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust you wait, it\u2019ll appear in a while.\u201d</p><br/><p>The bank worker shook his head, ready to call the mental institution to get the lady checked up. It was maybe also possible that this lady had escaped from the mental asylum.</p><br/><p>The machine was processing.</p><br/><p>\u201cLady, if you keep on\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck!\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, the bank worker looked at the words on the ATM screen, stunned and speechless.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis bank account belongs to scammers, please don\u2019t make the mentally handicapped look like geniuses.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLook, look, I didn\u2019t lie at all. The machine is calling me mentally handicapped!\u201d the middle-aged lady exclaimed, pointing excitedly at the screen.</p><br/><p>The bank worker\u2019s face was in a daze, not knowing what was going on. He immediately contacted his superior.</p><br/><p>\u201cDirector, it\u2019s not good. The ATM machine is not working properly. It\u2019s calling us mentally handicapped.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Director was speechless.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was cursing under his breath. How stupid could this person be? He had reminded her three times and she still continued to send money. Maybe it wasn\u2019t because the scammers used such devious tactics, but because the people they scammed were just plain stupid.</p><br/><p>He had covered every angle, and the main entry point was the bank system. At the same time, he blocked every single bank account which belonged to any scammer and froze their accounts. If anyone wired money to them, the transaction would be rejected.</p><br/><p>Of course, that wasn\u2019t the main goal. Lin Fan was out to look for the scammer who had scammed the seventy-year-old lady.</p><br/><p>\u201c62170013\u20264584.\u201d</p><br/><p>That was the bank account of the scammers, and Lin Fan had retrieved it from the bank system. Although the bank system had sophisticated defenses against hackers, it was as good as a paper tiger. It couldn\u2019t resist him at all.</p><br/><p>It was troublesome looking for a single person amongst so many numbers, but for Lin Fan, was it really a problem?</p><br/><p>Manically searching.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFound it.\u201d Lin Fan rejoiced as he remotely accessed a recording which showed a man who was standing in front of an ATM suspiciously.</p><br/><p>\u201cShit, he\u2019s wearing a face mask. But do you think that\u2019s the end?\u201d Lin Fan talked to himself. Normal people would only reach the competency of using the computer for daily use, but for Lin Fan, his level was that of a god.</p><br/><p>A certain bank in Shanyuan.</p><br/><p>The bank alarm rang.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot good, there\u2019s a hacker who has accessed our system and is currently looking at our internal data.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Quickly make a report to the Director! Where is the specialist? Quickly, get him to secure our system.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat specialist? Don\u2019t you know that all our specialists are just rookies?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHave you ever seen anyone hack our system before? We don\u2019t need hacking specialists around.\u201d</p><br/><p>The director of the bank rushed over hurriedly, his face full of shock. How did anyone manage to hack into their system?</p><br/><p>\u201cHow is that possible? Where are the guys who are supposed to intercept him?\u201d the Director asked.</p><br/><p>The worker looked like he was about to cry. \u201cDirector, there is no use trying to intercept him. All the defense mechanisms didn\u2019t trigger when the hacker accessed our system. We only knew about it when our guys accessed the system and found out that everything in the system had been decrypted.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, why are you still standing here? Quick, make a police report and get the Internet specialists to come. If anything happens, we are all screwed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, sir!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang looked at the screen in awe. \u201cBrother Lin, what are you doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan continued typing on the keyboard rapidly, \u201cNothing much, just hacking into the bank system looking for something.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang stood there, stunned. \u201cBrother Lin! Are you trying to defy the natural order? You\u2019ll be screw hard if you get caught. Please tell me you covered your tracks. If you hack into the bank system, you must make sure you clean up your tracks to prevent people from discovering who you are. Anyway, you better finish this fast. If you get found out, it\u2019ll be the end of you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy should I finish this soon? And why would I need to cover my tracks? I\u2019m just going straight at them. By the time they respond, I\u2019ll be done.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is really bad, you could go to jail for this,\u201d Zhao Zhong Yang said, concerned.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian immediately sprang up from his couch after hearing the word \u2018jail\u2019.</p><br/><p>\u201cKid, you better not play around,\u201d Fraud Tian said, his face full of worry.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan also chimed in, \u201cBrother Lin, why are you doing this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I won\u2019t descend to hell to do it, who else will? Although that seventy-year-old lady has no relation to me whatsoever, as the righteous Master, I cannot back down in the face of evil. I must bravely go forward. Anyway, I won\u2019t say anymore. I\u2019m going to hack into the police department system. You guys just do your own things.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone around was shocked. As if hacking into the bank system wasn\u2019t enough, he was now going to mess with the police. Did he have a death wish?</p><br/><p>Everyone looked at Lin Fan, their faces full of worry. They couldn\u2019t believe it. They had known Lin Fan for so long. Since when did he become a genius at computers?</p><br/><p>The Shanyuan Police Station received a police report.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot good. One of the banks in Shanyuan had their system hacked. We have to send a professional over to deal with their situation.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is huge.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHave you contacted the Internet specialist?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. He\u2019s on his way.\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot good, something just happened. All the banks in the country had their systems hacked.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere is our Internet specialist group?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey are all on their way to the banks.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGet them to come back here to make sure everything here is good.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, the Shanyuan Police Station was in chaos.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve finally found you,\u201d Lin Fan laughed to himself. After much effort, he had managed to find the scammer he had been looking for.</p><br/><p>He retrieved the person\u2019s data from the police system and noted it down.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s see if you have anywhere else to run.\u201d Lin Fans mood was rather good. At this moment, the people in Shanyuan still hadn\u2019t realized that they had been hacked. Their reaction time was just too slow!</p><br/><p>After looking at the scammer\u2019s profile, Lin Fan was stunned. The scammer was from Shanghai.</p><br/><p>He opened his Weibo and posted a picture.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have found the person responsible for cheating the old lady. If you, the scammer, see this post, please surrender yourself to the authorities immediately.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan picked up his phone and called Liu Xiao Tian.</p><br/><p>\u201cChief Liu, I\u2019ve found the scammer. It\u2019s also a coincidence that he\u2019s from Shanghai. Why don\u2019t you bring some men over to take a look?\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian couldn\u2019t believe what he was hearing. He had found the person that fast?</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, how did you find him?\u201d Liu Xiao Tian asked hastily.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t easy. I hacked into the bank system and looked for the latest bank transfer to that account. After that, I hacked the traffic police database to find him. That brat was really sneaky, going to a different location to collect his money, even wearing a mask. After that, I entered the police database and did a facial recognition until I got a match. After that, I did a search over the national bank database and found all the transactions to his account. Anyway, I still have a few more things to do and few more systems to hack into, so I\u2019m going to hang up first\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian was speechless. He wasn\u2019t exceptionally happy, instead, he was filled with terror.</p><br/><p>What did Master Lin just say?</p><br/><p>He had hacked into the bank system!</p><br/><p>He had hacked into the police database!</p><br/><p>He had hacked into the traffic police database!</p><br/><p>He had just turned the whole world upside down.</p><br/><p>He was the Inspector, but at this moment, his heart was pounding rapidly. He had been frightened by Master Lin.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello\u2026\u201d Liu Xiao Tian spoke into the phone. However, Master Lin had already hung up.</p><br/><p>This was big trouble.</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian felt like crying. Master Lin! Even the Bureau Chief won\u2019t be able to get you out of this!</p></div>\n</div>"}

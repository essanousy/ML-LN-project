Hence, they didn\u2019t encounter any problems when borrowing the hospital\u2019s surgical theatre.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, the hospital\u2019s doctors wanted to see the godly doctor\u2019s capability.</p><br/><p>This matter was a little difficult to handle for some normal doctors. However, to Lin Fan, it wasn\u2019t a problem at all.</p><br/><p>After the surgery was completed, the hospital\u2019s doctors were in disbelief. If they were to operate on him, the success rate would virtually be 0%.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing wasn\u2019t shocked at all. If he were to operate on him, he could save the patient with his Chinese medical skills. He didn\u2019t need his mentor to do it.</p><br/><p>He could tell that his mentor used a fusion of Chinese and Western medicine in the surgical theatre and the effects were astounding.</p><br/><p>After the surgery, Lin Fan and Zhao Ming Qing didn\u2019t stay in the hospital. They immediately left.</p><br/><p>This incident was considered to be done. The mute uncle\u2019s daughter had finally realized her mistakes.</p><br/><p>Outside.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing said ecstatically, \u201cTeacher, it\u2019s a happy ending.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cIt\u2019s okay. Thankfully we made it in time.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was really based on coincidence. If they didn\u2019t see him, the final outcome probably wouldn\u2019t be like that.</p><br/><p>In the ward.</p><br/><p>He Xiao Li kept kneeling beside the bed and held onto the mute uncle\u2019s hand. The nurses felt like something was wrong. Although they were curious, they heaved a sigh of relief as the matter was finally resolved.</p><br/><p>\u201cDoctor, is my father safe now?\u201d</p><br/><p>The doctor smiled, \u201cYes, he is safe. With Master Lin\u2019s help, he is finally out of the critical stage. Don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>He Xiao Li didn\u2019t say anything else. She didn\u2019t expect her dad to really know Teacher Lin. When she thought of the song, she felt that it was written by Teacher Lin.</p><br/><p>After thinking about that, she really wanted to thank Teacher Lin. At the same time, she was thankful that her dad met Teacher Lin. If not, she wouldn\u2019t know what the outcome would be like.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Lin Fan didn\u2019t really think too much about his new song. However, what he didn\u2019t know was that his song had a great impact on her.</p><br/><p>Many people were anticipating the new song.</p><br/><p>However, they were overwhelmed by their emotions and they started crying regardless of where they were.</p><br/><p>At Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, that\u2019s weird. I\u2019ve completed my task. Why isn\u2019t there a notification to show that I\u2019ve completed the task? The difficulty is a little scary.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan felt like something was wrong. He didn\u2019t understand where he went wrong. The seventeenth page of knowledge was a little weird.</p><br/><p>After that, he didn\u2019t think too much about it. He had already done his best.</p><br/><p>On the Internet.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis song is so touching.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is very touching. Filial piety is the most important virtue of all. After listening to this song, I started to think of my father too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow did Master Lin compose this song? Maybe Master Lin had experienced something like this before.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI still think \u2018Kiss Goodbye\u2019 is nicer.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI feel like \u2018Any Beer Bottles for Sale\u2019 is nicer. It resonates with me and each time I listen to it, I experience something different.\u201d</p><br/><p>The next day!</p><br/><p>A news article was published.</p><br/><p>\u2018The background story to Master Lin\u2019s new composition \u2018Any Beer Bottles For Sale\u2019.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, there\u2019s even a background story.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis song was actually created based on a host in Shanghai TV.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShanghai TV\u2019s host, He Xiao Li, speaks about her own experiences.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, after watching it, I felt like killing He Xiao Li. Thankfully, the ending was a perfect one. It was all because she met Master Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is really touching. The sacrifices of a mute father. If I could, I would want to be his daughter too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin is really a kind man. He encountered this on the streets and actually wrote a song about this to let the host realize her mistakes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone, don\u2019t flame the host. You should be able to understand her situation. As long as the outcome is perfect, it\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><br/><p>After He Xiao Li returned to Shanghai TV, she told everyone her story. At the same time, it was being broadcasted. She used herself as an example. Regardless of how bad you are, you should never despise your parents.</p><br/><p>When the story was being published, the song\u2019s status got even better.</p><br/><p>Initially, when people heard the song, they only felt sadness but they didn\u2019t know the meaning behind it.</p><br/><p>When they read the background story and listened to it again, they experienced it differently.</p><br/><p>On Weibo.</p><br/><p>The most powerful music critic in the nation, Teacher Zhou expressed his feelings about it.</p><br/><p>\u201cRecently, the \u2018Kiss Goodbye\u2019 song left a lot of people in tears after they listened to it. The song could be said to be the best love song. His singing ability can be said to be the best in the music industry. This can\u2019t be argued at all.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, when the second song, \u2018Any Beer Bottles for Sale\u2019 got published, I was initially a little disappointed. Although it causes you to feel it deeply, it isn\u2019t as good as \u2018Kiss Goodbye\u2019. However, after you finish reading the background story, you would feel extremely affected by it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher Lin\u2019s recent singing is really something that the Chinese music industry has never seen before. It\u2019s a form of \u2018power\u2019.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis form of \u2018power\u2019 is not the power of his voice. It is because of his undying strength and will. I would like to tell all the composers to compose better songs and not come up with lifeless and meaningless songs.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ordinary citizens wouldn\u2019t know who Teacher Zhou was but all the celebrities in the music industry knew who he was.</p><br/><p>He was a famous composer.</p><br/><p>He was the best critic in the nation as well. Hence, when he said something like this, it had already pushed the song to a higher level.</p><br/><p>It was something that nobody could belittle.</p><br/><p>In other parts of the nation.</p><br/><p>\u201cHave you heard Teacher Lin\u2019s new song?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat song?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the \u2018Any Beers Bottles for Sale\u2019 song. I suggest you listen to it again. Read the background story first. You will experience it differently.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally? I\u2019ll search it now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, go listen to it quickly. The most powerful critic, Teacher Zhou, is also recommending it. It\u2019s really good.\u201d</p><br/><p>At Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Lin, what are you thinking about? Do you have something on your mind?\u201d Wu You Lan asked.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said helplessly, \u201cNothing much, I\u2019m just thinking why I haven\u2019t become famous yet even though I sing so well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Wu You Lan was stunned. It was as if she hadn\u2019t recovered from her shock. She felt that what Brother Lin said was a joke. Then, she smiled, \u201cBrother Lin, you\u2019re already famous, okay? Look at the comments on Weibo. They\u2019re so much better than the other celebrities.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian sighed, \u201cYou don\u2019t know how to be satisfied. You have to be satisfied with what you have.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGet lost.\u201d Lin Fan glared at him. He was still waiting for the notification from the Encyclopedia.</p><br/><p>He felt like something isn\u2019t quite right as even though he was so powerful, nothing was being completed.</p></div>\n</div>"}

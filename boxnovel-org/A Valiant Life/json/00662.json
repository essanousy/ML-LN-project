In the face of such injustice, they didn\u2019t know what to do.</p><br/><p>The Chinese Arts Association was big. Whatever they said was taken as right. The public didn\u2019t have any say in this at all.</p><br/><p>But at that moment, Wu You Lan started getting excited.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Lin, take a look at Weibo, quick. The Chinese Arts Association has apologised.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? The Chinese Arts Association has apologised? Is that true?\u201d Fraud Tian was astonished and in disbelief. Then, he started roaring with laughter, \u201cHaha! I knew that they would apologise for sure. What do you think now, kid? They\u2019ve already apologised, what are you going to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan sat there and placed his phone on the table. \u201cAlright, no need to care about this matter then. Let\u2019s leave it at this. I\u2019ve already severed all ties with the Chinese Arts Association. Whoever they apologize to, it has nothing to do with me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian said, \u201cYou can\u2019t be serious. Are you really not going to have any contact with the association at all?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan didn\u2019t say anything as he just continued sitting down. Meanwhile, Wu You Lan nudged Fraud Tian. \u201cLet\u2019s not talk about this anymore. It has already passed. Brother Lin doesn\u2019t want to talk about it so we shouldn\u2019t either.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian understood what Wu You Lan meant and didn\u2019t say much else. \u201cThe prizes looked so attractive but we\u2019re just giving up like this. It\u2019s a shame.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Chinese Arts Association.</p><br/><p>Zheng Zhong Shan had been waiting for Lin Fan to make a post on Weibo the whole time. But after a long time, there was no post uploaded. At that instant, he said helplessly, \u201cIt looks like Elder Lin is really angry.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yue Qiu Ju Shi replied, \u201cThat can\u2019t be, can it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know. I judge people very accurately. Elder Lin, his character is\u2026sigh, I shan\u2019t say.\u201d Zheng Zhong Shan sighed. Then, his expression became stern as he glared at Director Chen.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Director Chen was drenched in sweat and trembling. He felt a sense of danger and even a sense of terror. He realized the situation had gotten grave. In particular, the President looked at him as if he wanted to kill him. It sent a chill down his spine.</p><br/><p>\u2018President, I\u2026\u201d He wanted to say something but before he could finish, Zheng Zhong Shan interrupted, \u201cFrom now on, you are relieved of all your duties. As for the bribery money you accepted, I\u2019ll slowly settle that with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Director Chen heard that, he was dumbfounded. His legs started to soften and become unstable.</p><br/><p>If he was to be relieved of all his duties, he would be done for.</p><br/><p>On the Internet.</p><br/><p>Chinese Arts Association Official Weibo: \u201cI am the President of the Chinese Arts Association. For such an incident to happen, it is heartbreaking to me. The goal of the Youth Chinese Arts Cup was to dig out younger generations of talents, but I never expected such a thing to happen. As President, I bear full responsibility. On this platform, I\u2019d like to apologize to everyone who has been observing this incident. Also, Master Lin, our association\u2019s only treasure, said that he wants to leave us. Our association cannot take this\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>It was a very long post. This Weibo post shocked everyone.</p><br/><p>Those netizens who had been clamouring were all shut up. They felt as if they had been slapped in the face.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, where are all those people who were clamouring just now. Come out now. Look at what the association has to say.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin is a treasure, understand?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis President didn\u2019t expect corruption? But at least the corruption didn\u2019t last for long until it got abolished.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy isn\u2019t Master Lin saying anything? The association has apologised. He should come out and say a few words.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy do I feel like Master Lin is angry? He tore his association ID, could it be that he really wants to quit?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>At that moment, over at Cloud Street, Lin Fan pulled Elder Liang and Elder Zhang with him as he went out.</p><br/><p>Elder Liang asked, \u201cLittle Boss, what are you doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cBuying prizes for the children. I don\u2019t want the prizes given by the association. I\u2019ll buy prizes for the children myself to give them some encouragement.*</p><br/><p>Elder Liang and Elder Zhang looked at each other. Then, they understood. Little Boss was angry. Even if the association had admitted their mistake and changed the winners list back, Little Boss wouldn\u2019t forgive them.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood, that\u2019s the way it should be. They thought they could say whatever they want but they can\u2019t. The children\u2019s drawings are very good, we should buy prizes for them,\u201d said Elder Liang.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The next day!</p><br/><p>This incident had initially been just a small matter but after the ruckus on the previous day, it went on the headlines. But even if it was a big deal on the Internet, Lin Fan had already stopped caring about it.</p><br/><p>Nanshan Children\u2019s Welfare Institute.</p><br/><p>A small truck came.</p><br/><p>Although Lin Fan wasn\u2019t some wealthy man, his savings weren\u2019t small.</p><br/><p>When the vehicle arrived, Director Huang was already waiting at the entrance.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, yesterday\u2019s incident\u2026\u201d She already knew about it. She had not expected to see that scene of the Chinese Arts Association being bribed. Lil\u2019 Fatty was supposed to get the first prize but in the end, he only got the second prize.</p><br/><p>But the good thing was that the situation had turned over very quickly. The association had admitted their mistake.</p><br/><p>However, judging by Master Lin\u2019s expression, it seemed that the matter was still in his heart.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved his hand. \u201cDon\u2019t talk about that. The children are all brilliant and after some thinking, I realized that the placing isn\u2019t important at all. Moreover, it\u2019s not good for the children to chase after placings at such young ages. To me, they\u2019re all number one.\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Huang nodded. She felt that what Master Lin said was very true. Then, she smiled, \u201cThat\u2019s true. The children are all the best.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan gestured for the workers to bring down the goods. \u201cThese are awards that I\u2019m giving to the children. Don\u2019t talk about that matter later on.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d Director Huang nodded.</p><br/><p>Han Lu joined in to help with the moving of the goods. Of course, he knew about the incident with the Chinese Arts Association. When he had found out, he had been extremely angry but now, he had thought things through. There was no point in caring so much about these things.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan\u2019s arrival naturally drew the attention of the children.</p><br/><p>Lil\u2019 Fatty rushed over. \u201cUncle Lin, how did I do?\u2019</p><br/><p>Lin Fan patted Lil\u2019 Fatty\u2019s head. \u201cMmm, you did very well. You\u2019re all the best. You\u2019ve all been super brilliant in the competition. Look, I\u2019ve brought many prizes for you all\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally?\u201d When Lil\u2019 Fatty heard that, his big, round eyes started to glimmer.</p><br/><p>Getting praised was better than anything else. He didn\u2019t even ask about the placing.</p><br/><p>The gifts were given out and the children were exceptionally happy.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Lin.\u201d At that moment, a familiar voice rang from the entrance.</p><br/><p>When he saw who it was, Lin Fan was a little startled. He hadn\u2019t expected Elder Zheng and the rest to come all the way here.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t just Elder Zheng. Even Yue Qiu Ju Shi and Tao Shi Gang were there.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan had initially wanted to greet them with a smile but then, he thought about the previous day\u2019s incident and asked wilfully, \u201cWhy are you all here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Zheng smiled, \u201cYou\u2019re good, Elder Lin. We personally came all the way here and you\u2019re still angry. Your Brothers here are ashamed to face you but we\u2019ve already investigated and punished the instigator.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yue Qiu Ju Shi and Tao Shi Gang both nodded. \u201cYeah. Yeah.\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

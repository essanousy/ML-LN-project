There will always be another opportunity,\" her agent tried to console her.</p><br/><p>The accident was just down to bad luck. Rolling down from the stairs was already bad enough and to have fractured a leg made it even worse. With the huge cast on her right leg, it made it extremely difficult for her to move around, destroying any hopes of making it to the fashion show.</p><br/><p>Zhou Li Yun just lied there with tears streaming down her straight face.</p><br/><p>She had been preparing for the fashion show for quite some time and it had all gone to waste in a moment of folly.</p><br/><p>\"Sister Yun\u2026\" her agent hurriedly passed her paper towels, without knowing how to console her.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Zhou Li Yun said, \"Pass my phone to me.\" The agent did not know what was going on but just handed her phone over. All that was in Zhou Li Yun's mind was that Weibo text. When she had opened the app, the first thing she saw was, \"You can't make it there\u2026 You can't make it there.\"</p><br/><p>Zhou Li Yun knew about this Weibo text long ago. When she had first seen it, she did not think much of it. Naturally, she was unhappy about it and went to archive it. But when the accident really happened, Zhou Li Yun cried. The agent saw the message on Weibo and tried to console her by saying, \"Sister Yun, it must be blind luck, you can't believe in it.\"</p><br/><p>Zhou Li Yun shook her head in response. You gotta believe in these things sometimes. She had known that this Master Lin had left a message on many superstars' Weibo, but the first person to experience something negative was actually her. She was afraid other unlucky occurrences.</p><br/><p>\"It must have been Bei Li's foul mouth.\"</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>Meanwhile at a random house\u2026</p><br/><p>Luo Dan was shocked and said, \"Xin Yi, look at this article. Master Lin had predicted Zhou Li Yun's absence at the upcoming fashion show.\"</p><br/><p>Chen Xin Yi was actually looking at her script but when she had heard the news about Master Lin, she immediately put down her treasured script and snatched her phone over to read the article.</p><br/><p>As she scrolled further, her mouth widened bigger. \"He really predicted it\u2026 Master Lin is so scary.\" Chen Xin Yi said in disbelief.</p><br/><p>\"It's not scary, it's god-like.\" Luo Dan said in disbelief as well.</p><br/><p>Ever since that incident, they were both labeled as 'actress 1' and 'actress 2'. Also, Teacher Tao's straightforward and direct working style made it such that when everything was fully prepared, they would immediately start filming.</p><br/><p>\"Go take a look at Master Lin's Weibo, those netizens that were scolding Master Lin must all be speechless now.\" Chen Xin Yi said.</p><br/><p>\"I already went to have a look. Master Lin is really a pro. He just lets them scold him and then goes on to prove people wrong with his actions.\"</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Night time...</p><br/><p>Lin Fan came home from the stall and lied down on his bed while playing with his phone. \"Haha, now you know the power of Master Lin.\" Lin Fan said as he looked at his Weibo and smiled as if he had known this was going to happen.</p><br/><p>Zhou Li Yun's incident was the first of many to come. It would become more exciting as the others come true as well.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile in the Weibo app\u2026</p><br/><p>\"Master Lin, you're indeed god-like. I believe you now.\"</p><br/><p>\"Master Lin, please help me out as well!\"</p><br/><p>\"Where did the haters go?

The internet didn\u2019t really report about it anymore. However, Elder Dog\u2019s fans were still really crazy but they were much more normal than they were in the past.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, most people came to visit Elder Dog and take pictures with him.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t really reject these requests.</p><br/><p>In the morning.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was lying on his chair. He looked really bored. These days were too boring.</p><br/><p>Then, someone called him from home.</p><br/><p>\u201cDad, what is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Father Lin said, \u201cWhen are you prepared to come back? It\u2019s almost February. Are you really planning to stay in Shanghai forever?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was a little helpless after hearing that. He only went back home once a year and his family was waiting for him to spend the New Year together.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, these days past really quickly. In the blink of an eye, it was already almost February.</p><br/><p>He would definitely return if things were the same as the past. However, he had taken over the Children\u2019s Welfare Institute and he wanted to spend the New Year in Shanghai. However, if he were to stay in Shanghai, his parents would probably be unhappy.</p><br/><p>\u201cDad, how about you and mom come over to Shanghai for the New Year?\u201d Lin Fan tried to see the reaction of his dad to the question.</p><br/><p>Father Lin replied, \u201cWhat for? Aren\u2019t you coming back home to visit the relatives?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cDad, it\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want to. I just took over a Children\u2019s Welfare Institute in Shanghai. I felt that it would be better for you and mum to come over to spend the New Year with the orphans here. They are really lonely and they deserve to spend these occasions happily.\u201d</p><br/><p>Father Lin interrupted Lin Fan with a sense of relief, \u201cLooks like this lad has changed a lot. You\u2019ve grown up. Alright, your mum and I would feel the same with spending New Year anywhere. I just hope our family can come together. I\u2019ll tell your mom about this now. We\u2019ll come to Shanghai for New Year this year. However, we have to visit relatives here on the second day of the Lunar New Year. If not, people would gossip about us.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled, \u201cAlright, dad, you can call the shots.\u201d</p><br/><p>After chatting for a while longer, they hung up.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was quite happy with his dad\u2019s leniency towards him.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan asked, \u201cBrother Lin, aren\u2019t you going back to Zhong Zhou this year?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cWe\u2019ll be in Shanghai. However, we\u2019ll return back on the second day of the Lunar New Year. What about you and your dad?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan smiled, \u201cI\u2019m his only daughter and we don\u2019t really have relatives. It\u2019s the same for us to spend the New Year anywhere.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian said, \u201cMe too, I don\u2019t have anywhere to go.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang replied, \u201cI have to go back home. If not, my mom will break my legs.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cAlright, let\u2019s not talk about it. There are still ten more days. No hurry.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin.\u201d Then, Liu Xiao Tian appeared at the shop.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled, \u201cInspector Liu, what brought you here today?\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian immediately entered the shop and sat down. Wu You Lan served him some tea. \u201cWhat else? It must be something good. But Master Lin, your dog is really awesome. I am here today to visit him and also say something to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan asked, \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>To Liu Xiao Tian, Master Lin was definitely the person that helped him the most.</p><br/><p>His career progressed so quickly and it was all because of Master Lin. He was already in the deputy office but he still allowed Master Lin to address him as \u2018Inspector Lin\u2019.</p><br/><p>He felt that it sounded less foreign.</p><br/><p>\u201cI just have to inform you that the police force has decided to give Elder Dog a Heroism Award and some cash,\u201d Liu Xiao Tian smiled.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was stunned in disbelief. \u201cWhat did you say? Give him a Heroism Award? Are you kidding?\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian replied, \u201cNope. The documents are in preparation. But really, it\u2019s the first time I encountered such a thing. It\u2019s something new that we\u2019re doing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan gave him a thumbs up, \u201cThe government is handling this thing with such a unique way.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, my colleague asked me to ask you why Elder Dog is so smart. How did you train him? You should know that the person in the narcotics bureau is really close to me. The people there would like to have a dog like him. Therefore, I\u2019d like to ask if you could help to train them,\u201d Liu Xiao Tian turned around and asked.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan immediately shook his head, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t even know how to train dogs. How can I train them for you? Hence, they have to depend on themselves.\u201d</p><br/><p>He was actually really good at training dogs but he didn\u2019t want to expose himself. If not, things might become really troublesome.</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian looked at Lin Fan and smiled, \u201cMaster Lin, you\u2019re not being honest here\u2026 But I understand. How can I not know what you\u2019re thinking about? I\u2019ll help you relay the message.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled, \u201cIt\u2019s good that you understand me. Right, I haven\u2019t seen you in a long time. Are you really busy recently? Or did something happen?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA lot of things happened. It\u2019s almost near the end of the year. We have to focus on security. A lot of thieves are going to be on the loose. We\u2019re really busy. We can\u2019t afford to be so relaxed like you,\u201d Liu Xiao Tian said.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, I\u2019m not that relaxed. I have a lot of things to do too.\u201d Lin Fan was never going to admit that he was really relaxed.</p><br/><p>However, for someone like Liu Xiao Tian, the chances of him going back to his family were really low. He might even have to work on the eve of the Lunar New Year.</p><br/><p>If not, the security of the country would be at stake if they were to take leave.</p><br/><p>It was getting late and Liu Xiao Tian didn\u2019t want to stay any longer. \u201cI\u2019ll be making a move first. When the documents are ready, I\u2019ll get someone to send them to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, have a safe trip back,\u201d Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>When Liu Xiao Tian left, Lin Fan looked at Elder Dog, \u201cAre you happy? A Heroism Award just for you. You\u2019re the first non-human to have it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Dog smiled weirdly. It looked a little bit more like a yawn.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cThe Lunar New Year is almost here. Who would like to follow me to buy some things?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang replied, \u201cMe.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian replied, \u201cMe too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright. Then, You Lan and Elder Wu can stay in the shop. Let\u2019s go,\u201d Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>With greater responsibilities, one would become busier at important times.</p><br/><p>There were hundreds of people waiting for him in the Children\u2019s Welfare Institute. He had to ensure that the celebrations weren\u2019t too bad.</p><br/><p>Everyone had to have a new set of clothes, shoes, sweets, etc.</p><br/><p>Most importantly, they had to have red packets.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan drove his Hummer and fetched Fraud Tian and Zhao Zhong Yang to the supermarket.</p><br/><p>Of course, the clothes and shoes were to be bought at Cloud Street. The goodies had to be kept within the \u2018family\u2019. That way, he wouldn\u2019t have to be afraid of being scammed.</p><br/><p>As for the sweets and snacks, he had to buy them outside.</p><br/><p>Cloud Street mostly sold shoes and clothes.</p><br/><p>At the candy shop.</p><br/><p>The boss said, \u201cHey, aren\u2019t you Master Lin?\u201d</p><br/><p>The boss was a young man and he recognized Lin Fan with just one look. He passionately offered him a seat and some tea.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was a little embarrassed.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, are you here for something?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cNothing much. It\u2019s almost the Lunar New Year. I\u2019m prepared to buy some snacks and candies.\u201d</p><br/><p>The boss patted his chest, \u201cMaster Lin, don\u2019t worry. Leave this to me. I\u2019m really in awe of you. I can sell you the sweets at cost price. I wouldn\u2019t earn any money from you. If I were to do that, I would be an inhumane beast.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cNo, no. You\u2019re running a business. How could you not earn any money? Just give me a fair price.\u201d</p><br/><p>The boss replied, \u201cMaster Lin, since you put it that way, I\u2019ll just earn a bit. But it\u2019ll definitely be cheaper than the market prices.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cThat will do.\u201d</p><br/><p>He was a little embarrassed. He wanted to look at several shops but he didn\u2019t expect this boss to be so passionate. It made him a little embarrassed. However, he didn\u2019t think too much about it since he couldn\u2019t do anything about it.</p></div>\n</div>"}

They were ashamed. They felt as if they had been slapped in the face. One by one, they quickly left for the hospital.</p><br/><p>They wanted to do a body check-up, just in case there really was something wrong.</p><br/><p>There were also a few residents who had bought the scallion pancakes for their children. They had to rush down to their schools to bring them to the hospitals. From the teacher's feedback, they learned that their children were frequently daydreaming about the scallion pancakes and did not pay any attention in class.</p><br/><p>After learning about the entire situation, some residents regretted deeply and demanded an explanation from Chief Zhang.</p><br/><p>One of the reporters asked, \"Master Lin! There's been a very drastic change of events! May I ask how you knew of Chief Zhang's impending imprisonment?\"</p><br/><p>Another reporter begged, \"Master Lin, please say a few words.\"</p><br/><p>The reporters were all dying to know the truth. Their minds were in a mess. The changes in the day's events were indeed extremely drastic.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan just sat there drinking his tea. He was too lazy to say anything. He glanced back at Fraud Tian and Fraud Tian instinctively knew what to do. He proceeded to stand outside the door.</p><br/><p>\"Can't you guys see the signboard? Don't you guys understand now? It's Master Lin! If you can't even understand this, do you still think you have the rights to address Master Lin?\" Fraud Tian said complacently.</p><br/><p>When they looked at the board, the reporters were lost for words. They wanted to ask a few more questions. However, seeing that Master Lin didn't even bother speaking to them, they eventually just left.</p><br/><p>They wanted to head to the police station to see what the current situation was like. If there was any news to report, that would be great. However, there was already enough news for today. It was an earth-shattering change of events.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian was in a good mood. \"Did you know that Chief Zhang would be taken away by the police?\" he asked.</p><br/><p>\"I only knew when I saw it today.\" Lin Fan did not take this matter to heart. So what if Chief Zhang's scallion pancakes were manufactured like this? It didn't even have half a dimes worth to do with him.</p><br/><p>Up until that day, he had acquired many different skills and abilities, so much so that he was very busy. How could he have the time to fight over scallion pancakes?</p><br/><p>Wu Tian He chuckled, \"Master Lin's superior abilities are still number one.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed along. He then took out his phone to check Weibo.</p><br/><p>Autumn Sword Fish Killer had been very agitated recently, it was as if he was excited about something. After an outburst with his Phantom Butterfly Hands, there was a lot of mockery in the comments section. It was hard to find such a dedicated Internet troll. If someone were to pay him and each post earned him fifty cents, Autumn Sword Fish Killer would have had several tens of thousands accounted into his bank account in just those few days.</p><br/><p>It was such a pity that no one hired Autumn Sword Fish Killer.</p><br/><p>Even so, Autumn Sword Fish Killer never got bored of being an Internet troll. He still carried on flaming Lin Fan on Weibo every day.</p><br/><p>With a tap of his finger, a private message was sent.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan: \"Stop spouting nonsense and start preparing for the emotional ride of your life. Remember, don't drink alcohol!\"</p><br/><p>Inside the rented house.</p><br/><p>Autumn Sword Fish Killer read the private message. When he first saw it, he thought the Lin Fan was actually scared of him, however, after reading the message, he got furious instead.</p><br/><p>\"F*ck off!\"</p><br/><p>Not long after, his phone rang.</p><br/><p>Autumn Sword Fish Killer looked at the display on his screen and didn't answer the call for a long time.</p><br/><p>Liu Jia Hui!</p><br/><p>It was his first love back in junior high.</p><br/><p>This love had always been kept in his heart. Up until then, Autumn Sword Fish Killer couldn't forget it.</p><br/><p>He answered the call.</p><br/><p>\"Bai Qi, it's me. I'm getting married in a months time. Are you interested in coming?\" The voice through the call was low and steady. It had a sweet ring to it.</p><br/><p>Autumn Sword Fish Killer's real name is Ou Bai Qi. However, he didn't like his name and preferred to be called Autumn Sword.</p><br/><p>When he saw the call from Liu Jia Hui, he was very excited. However, after hearing what she said, Autumn Sword was stunned.</p><br/><p>\"Bai Qi, are you there?\"</p><br/><p>Autumn Sword Fish Killer had a bitter expression on his face, \"Yes, I am. Congratulations! May I know who you're getting married to?\"</p><br/><p>She hesitated for a while, \"Wu Hao Yun.\"</p><br/><p>\"Will you be coming?\"</p><br/><p>Hearing that name, it was as if Autumn Sword Fish Killer was struck by lightning. He couldn't believe it.</p><br/><p>Back in the school days.</p><br/><p>There was a couple in school uniform, smiling and laughing while eating spicy snacks. They were watching a lone boy eating alone.</p><br/><p>\"The person I hate the most is Wu Hao Yun. All he knows is to bully others.\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes, yes. Jia Wen you can be at ease. I, Ou Bai Qi, will never become like him. All he has is only a bit of money.\"</p><br/><p>\"Yeah.\"</p><br/><p>\u2026...</p><br/><p>The Autumn Sword at that time was very lean. However, time was like a blade, cutting away Autumn Sword's youthful looks.</p><br/><p>\"I will.\" Although it was just two words, it took all his strength.</p><br/><p>He switched off his phone.</p><br/><p>Autumn Sword Fish Killer stared at his screen. His fingers were on his keyboard, yet he couldn't bring himself to type anything. Tears started flowing uncontrollably.</p><br/><p>He cried like a little boy.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>At the police station.</p><br/><p>\"My dear officers, this matter has nothing to do with me! I didn't even know that such ingredients were added to the scallion pancakes!\" Chief Zhang's face was red. How could this be? This was forced upon him. If he knew about this earlier, he wouldn't even have dared to do it, even if he were to be beaten to death.</p><br/><p>He was someone with a reputation and social status. There wasn't a need for him to put himself in such a dangerous position.</p><br/><p>He was too caught up in happiness at the moment that he never imagined that such a thing would happen. When his chefs told him that they had successfully crafted the scallion pancakes, he was so excited that he couldn't even sleep.</p><br/><p>This was because it meant that he could have his own exclusive brand that he could expand internationally, just like the Lao Gan Ma Sauce brand, which was widely sought after worldwide.</p><br/><p>The scallion pancakes from Lin Fan were impossible for others to imitate because it was beyond their knowledge. Without the help of the Encyclopedia, the result was near impossible.</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian stared at Chief Zhang, \"This matter isn't as simple as you saying that you had nothing to do with it. We are currently doing our investigations. Your chefs also said that it was you that instructed them to do so. This contract also fully proves that you were completely supportive of the manufacturing of the scallion pancakes.\"</p><br/><p>Chief Zhang was anxious. He was so furious that he could chop up all the chefs. How could such devious people exist? At the same time, he was deeply regretful that he got himself into such a situation.</p><br/><p>\"Chief Liu, think about it, why would I dig my own grave? I have my hotel business there. I have my morals. After I obtained Master Lin's scallion pancake recipe, I gave it to them to craft the scallion pancakes, which they did in the end. These chefs have been working with me for years and I had the utmost trust in them. If I knew what they were doing, why would I have eaten my own scallion pancakes?\"</p><br/><p>\"Moreover, I know how serious of an issue adding such prohibited ingredients is. How could I do such a thing? In addition, I wouldn't have eaten my own scallion pancakes.\"</p><br/><p>Chief Zhang was really at a loss. The chefs were obviously trying to sabotage him. However, he still regretted his actions. At that time, he signed the contract without even reading it through. It was practically digging his own grave.</p><br/><p>Chief Liu nodded his head. He knew that there were a few suspicious points.</p><br/><p>\"Please relax. We will do a thorough investigation. If you really were sabotaged, we will give you justice.\"</p><br/><p>\"Thank you... thank you.\" Chief Zhang was grateful. All he could do now was to pin his hopes on the police officers.</p><br/><p>The reporters arrived at the police station. They waited outside for quite some time but finally left after learning that Chief Zhang would be detained.</p><br/><p>It had been a day with many turns of events. They had to carefully and properly write it down.</p><br/><p>This was it - the big news.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Then, he didn\u2019t say much more.</p><br/><p>It seemed that Fraud Tian still couldn\u2019t bear to leave this place. This Fraud really made him quite touched.</p><br/><p>Actually, it really wasn\u2019t a problem at all. If Fraud were to really go into another business, Lin Fan would be very happy for him. Every person had his own individual goals.</p><br/><p>However, Fraud Tian didn\u2019t want to go. He couldn\u2019t bear to leave Cloud Street. That was his own choice, and it was a pretty good choice. It was quite great to stay here happily.</p><br/><p>Moreover, the people here couldn\u2019t bear to see Fraud Tian leave either.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian sat at the entrance, continuing to smoke his cigarette. Last night, he had spent some time thinking, but he still decided not to leave in the end.</p><br/><p>Because he had already gotten used to this place, he didn\u2019t want to go anywhere else.</p><br/><p>In the past, he used to spend his days running his stall on the bridge. But now, he had so many friends on Cloud Street. Although there were times that bad things would happen, these always ended happily.</p><br/><p>Moreover, he was needed here as well. If he were to leave, who would give out number tags for the kid?</p><br/><p>A few days later.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was driving his car towards a factory. That was the office for Wang Ming Yang\u2019s collaboration with the government as well as the headquarters for the artificial limbs.</p><br/><p>There were many high-tech facilities over there. ( .c om )</p><br/><p>After Secretary Chen reported this matter to the higher-ups, the higher-ups took it quite seriously. After all, these artificial limbs could solve the problems of many disabled people.</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan arrived, the place was already filled with countless reporters.</p><br/><p>The reporters had arrived much earlier. They all cared very much about these perfect artificial limbs.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin is here!\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, the reporters saw the car driving over. When they took a closer look, they realized that it was Master Lin\u2019s car.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan came out from the car and nodded at the reporters. \u201cGood morning, everyone! You\u2019re all early. How professional!\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporters laughed. \u201cMaster Lin, you\u2019re early too! We\u2019re not as professional as you. You\u2019re busy with the scallion pancakes and the artificial limbs at the same time. It must really be tiring.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHahahaha,\u201d Lin Fan laughed. Looking at the time, it was still early. \u201cWhat time are you guys going in?\u201d</p><br/><p>A reporter took out a cigarette and shared it with Master Lin. Then, they stood there smoking. \u201cWe have to wait until 9. Master Lin, you came so early too. Is it because there\u2019s something you have to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. \u201cAre you trying to get news out of me?\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporter said, \u201cAh, Master Lin, what do you mean by that? I\u2019m just chatting with you normally!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cActually, there\u2019s nothing much. I just came early to see how the facilities are and whether the artificial limbs produced are up to standard. If they aren\u2019t, we can\u2019t distribute them. We\u2019d have to re-make them, wouldn\u2019t we?\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporters nodded. \u201cMmm. Master Lin is right. Once these perfect artificial limbs are released, they will bring fortune to those people. However, I heard that the matter regarding those other artificial limb companies hasn\u2019t been resolved yet. It wouldn\u2019t be a big problem, would it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved his hand. \u201cI don\u2019t know about that, nor do I care. In any case, I believe that the government will take care of it.\u201d</p><br/><p>A reporter said, \u201cMaster Lin, we all really respect you. You gave away this technology so willingly and unselfishly. That\u2019s really admirable.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re too courteous.\u201d Lin Fan smiled. \u201cAlright, I\u2019m going in now. See you later. But when you ask questions later, don\u2019t ask questions that are too complicated. I may not be able to answer them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha.\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporters burst into laughter. Then, they watched as Master Lin went in.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang had been waiting for a long time. When he saw Lin Fan enter, he immediately approached him. \u201cAh, my brother, you\u2019re finally here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cWhat\u2019s the hurry? It\u2019s only 8. Is Secretary Chen here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot yet. Secretary Chen is very busy, and we\u2019ve set the meeting time at 9. He\u2019ll be on time for the press conference. This time, things are really troublesome. Sigh, I shan\u2019t say more. In any case, this is up to us.\u201d When Wang Ming Yang thought about those other artificial limb companies, he was so anxious that he had a headache. However, the good thing was that it was already mostly resolved.</p><br/><p>There were only a few old foxes that refused to give in. They really made him feel helpless.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. \u201cThey must be giving you a real headache. Anyway, this has nothing to do with me. Let\u2019s go. Let\u2019s take a look at the manufacturing process. The quality is up to standard, right? There are no problems with the components, are there?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang patted his own chest as he said confidently, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. There are definitely no problems.\u201d</p><br/><p>In the factory. ( .c om )</p><br/><p>The workers were busy working. The machines were operating as well.</p><br/><p>Each machine had been programmed with the data written by Lin Fan previously.</p><br/><p>The final assembly of the components was still dependent on the specialists\u2019 knowledge.</p><br/><p>\u201cTake a look. These have all met the standards. Once the press conference is over, they can be they can be placed on the market,\u201d said Wang Ming Yang.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. \u201cWho assesses the quality of all these parts?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang replied, \u201cThose people from the government. As for the core, it\u2019s still taken care of by my people.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded and continued looking around. When he saw an artificial limb come out, he picked it up and looked closely. Then, his brows furrowed. \u201cMing Yang, there\u2019s a problem, isn\u2019t there?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang was taken aback. \u201cWhat\u2019s the problem?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cWhy do I feel as if there\u2019s something wrong with its rotation? And there\u2019s a problem with its flexibility as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt can\u2019t be. These components were all produced according to your blueprints. Moreover, there are people checking the quality as well. How could there be a problem?\u201d Wang Ming Yang\u2019s expression changed drastically. If there really was a problem, it would be a disaster. However, it didn\u2019t seem possible.</p><br/><p>\u201cGive me some tools. Let me take a look.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, Lin Fan took the tools and dismantled the artificial limb.</p><br/><p>When the surrounding workers saw this, they were all stunned as they had no idea what was going on. They were all specialists, and they had been posted here specially to produce these perfect artificial limbs.</p><br/><p>Suddenly!</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone, stop what you\u2019re doing. Stop producing!\u201d Lin Fan shouted.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang had no idea what had happened but he shouted as well, \u201cEverybody, stop. Stop the machines.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan held a very small component in his hand. \u201cWho produced this? Look. The f*cking corner is blunt. How can it be used?\u201d</p><br/><p>It was a very small component. But with a closer look, one could see that there was a problem with it.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang instantly looked a little stifled.</p><br/><p>\u201cDirector Li, come here,\u201d Wang Ming Yang shouted.</p><br/><p>At that moment, a middle-aged man walked over. \u201cChief Wang, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, he saw Master Lin and was stunned. \u201cMaster Lin, you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang placed the component on the table. \u201cLook. What\u2019s up with this part? Why is the corner blunt?\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Li picked it up and took a look. Then, he said calmly, \u201cIt\u2019s nothing much. This is very normal. It can still be used. It\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p></div>\n</div>"}

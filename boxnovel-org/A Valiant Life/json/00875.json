The little kid looked pretty trustworthy.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang asked, \u201cWhere are you now? Why did you go past that place? I asked you to go into hiding, but you didn\u2019t have to hide so far away.\u201d</p><br/><p>He was satisfied. He didn\u2019t expect that his brother would be so awesome, to actually hide somewhere so far away.</p><br/><p>He also went to hide as instructed and didn\u2019t cause any trouble along the way. This made him satisfied as well.</p><br/><p>In any case, he wasn\u2019t satisfied with anyone except his brother.</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t have a choice. If I\u2019m going to hide, of course, I\u2019d hide somewhere far away. However, right now, I\u2019m busy with something.\u201d Lin Fan said.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-2\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang was stunned, \u201cBusy with what?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m currently at a Taoist temple trying to befriend a priest. This priest truly has some ability. He can also be considered a person of extraordinary talent.\u201d Lin Fan felt that the Silent Priest was an amazing person.</p><br/><p>He was good at playing chess, diagnosing and curing illnesses, and even taking care of himself. He was healthy and it was evident he had a method of taking care of himself.</p><br/><p>In the eyes of ordinary people, he was a god.</p><br/><p>But in Lin Fan\u2019s eyes, he was just lacking in a bit.</p><br/><p>\u201cPriest?\u201d Wang Ming Yang couldn\u2019t quite understand. He didn\u2019t know what his brother was up to. His actions were a little mysterious. However, he just let it go. It was his brother\u2019s own doing, so he couldn\u2019t say much.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cYep. Wuxiang Taoist Temple. Do you know about it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang was stunned when he heard it, \u201cF*ck! You\u2019re too awesome! Why did you run off to such a far place?\u201d</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t think that his brother would actually run to such a far place. This was too frightening.</p><br/><p>What he knew about Wuxiang Taoist Temple was that the priests there were extraordinary, but he didn\u2019t take those words seriously. In this modern society, it was very common for someone to brag, hence he didn\u2019t take the words seriously.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-3\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>However, he didn\u2019t think that his own brother would actually go there. This made some people rather confused.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cOkay that\u2019s enough. I won\u2019t talk anymore with you. I\u2019m hanging up. I still have things to attend to.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>After hanging up, Lin Fan started to stroll around the temple.</p><br/><p>There were many people that came here daily. Most of them were from nearby places, but some of them came from much further, all just to see the Silent Priest.</p><br/><p>The \u2018Silent Priest\u2019 really had some true talent. He was able to attract so many people to come down here personally. This was common for him.</p><br/><p>This was similar to Wu Tian He. He was very accurate with his fortune-telling, hence also attracting many officials and experts.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The next day.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan\u2019s mission was to become good friends with the priest. Although the priest was rather advanced in age and also didn\u2019t speak, he was confident that with his ability, he would be able to be intimate friends with the priest.</p><br/><p>When the time comes that he would unlock another page of knowledge, he would be more confident that he would be able to unlock the xianxia page of knowledge.</p><br/><p>Although it wasn\u2019t definite that he would unlock that page, at least there would still be that hope.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-4\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>After washing up, he came back to the same place as the day before.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh? Where\u2019s he?\u201d Lin Fan looked around but he didn\u2019t see the Silent Priest. He began to get suspicious.</p><br/><p>At this moment, he saw a priest walk by and he immediately walked up to ask, \u201cMay I ask you, where is the Silent Priest?\u201d</p><br/><p>The priest answered him, \u201cThe Master is currently leading the other disciplines to practice their swordsmanship.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, thank you.\u201d Lin Fan nodded his head. He asked about the whereabouts and walked towards his destination.</p><br/><p>The priest suspiciously talked to himself, \u201cThat\u2019s strange, doesn\u2019t Master always play chess alone every morning? Why did he change to practice his swordsmanship?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Silent Priest kept this habit up for many years and his disciplines all knew about it.</p><br/><p>However, there was a sudden change today and they weren\u2019t used to it.</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan reached the back of the mountain, he saw the Silent Priest holding a long sword in the distance. He was currently teaching his disciplines the way to practice swordsmanship.</p><br/><p>This swordsmanship isn\u2019t like the kind in the wuxia stories. It was the kind of swordsmanship that cultivated oneself. Of course, they could still use it to defend oneself.</p><br/><p>The Silent Priest, who was currently wielding a sword, sighed. He never thought that he would ever change his habit of playing chess in the morning.</p><br/><p>This wasn\u2019t because he disliked it, but because he was afraid of it.</p><br/><p>That young man\u2019s chess skills were too good. He felt that there was a huge disparity between their skills. It wasn\u2019t a gap that he could bridge in a short span of time.</p><br/><p>In order not to lose another game of chess, he decided to entirely abandon playing chess.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-5\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>All of a sudden, he heard a noise.</p><br/><p>\u201cPriest friend, you\u2019re so refined. Your swordsmanship is amazing.\u201d Lin Fan smiled while walking over.</p><br/><p>The priest by his side looked at Lin Fan and felt his heart being gripped. Everything that he witnessed the day before was etched in his mind.</p><br/><p>It was this benefactor that caused his Master to be afraid of playing chess and switched to practicing his swordsmanship instead.</p><br/><p>The Silent Priest smiled and nodded at Lin Fan. Then, he continued to practice his sword dance. Compared to before, he looked a lot more imposing.</p><br/><p>Each stab and each slash was of the highest standard.</p><br/><p>As for the disciplines who were following the Silent Priest, they couldn\u2019t keep up with his tempo. Hence, one by one, they stopped and just watched him.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster is amazing!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIndeed! Master\u2019s swordsmanship belongs to Taoism. Moreover, from what I heard, this skill was used to kill many bandits in the past.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan didn\u2019t think that the Silent Priest would be an expert in so many domains. He was momentarily excited.</p><br/><p>Adapting to one\u2019s taste to become their good friend would eventually succeed.</p><br/><p>Just at this moment, there was a change in the scene.</p><br/><p>The Silent Priest changed his stance. It became one of aggression. There was sort of a hidden emotion behind each stroke.</p><br/><p>The disciplines who were surrounding him all gasped in awe. In their eyes, their Master\u2019s swordsmanship was the best.</p><br/><p>\u201cNice! Beautiful! Priest friend, your swordsmanship is extraordinary. It is rarely seen these days.\u201d Lin Fan complimented.</p><br/><p>The word \u2018beautiful\u2019 pierced the Silent Priest\u2019s ears. He couldn\u2019t take it.</p><br/><p>But the Silent Priest remained calm. He didn\u2019t believe the other party would have any sword skills.</p><br/><p>After all, what generation was this? Who would still learn this these days?</p><br/><p>Just at this moment, he heard an inharmonious sound.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust as well! I, too, know a thing or two about swordsmanship. Please advise me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan took a long sword from one of the disciplines standing beside him. After which, he walked beside the Silent Priest.</p><br/><p>\u201cPriest friend, I call this move the Tai Chi Swordsmanship. Please critique me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ever since he had obtained the wuxia major classification of knowledge, his mind had been filled with martial arts. It was just too much, so much so that he was afraid of it.</p><br/><p>Of course, he had to exercise restraint when demonstrating his skill this time around.</p><br/><p>If he did not, he would be drawing the Tai Chi Yin and Yang Symbol. It would be a disaster.</p><br/><p>The Silent Priest was convinced. He was thoroughly convinced. He never expected that such a young man would have this swordsmanship in him.</p><br/><p>However, he didn\u2019t believe that this young man would be better than him.</p><br/><p>Except, he was instantaneously stunned when he saw his skills.</p><br/><p>His heart was like a boulder, but at this moment, he just felt like screaming.</p><br/><p><em>Am I even alive?</em></p><br/><p><em>Just where did this fella come from?</em></p><br/><p><em>What are you trying to do?</em></p><br/><p><em>How did an old Priest like me offend you?</em></p></div>\n</div>"}

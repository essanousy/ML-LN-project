Brother Lin achieved something so easily that others would never be able to achieve in their lifetime.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh!\u201d Lin Fan didn\u2019t really care about it.</p><br/><p>Ding ding!</p><br/><p>Then, Lin Fan\u2019s phone rang. It was an e-mail notification.</p><br/><p>He was puzzled. He opened up the e-mail and it was actually an invitation by the Michelin company. They wanted to present him with a certificate and gave him a specific time and location of the event.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was puzzled. Why would he go? He was so busy with his life every day and he wouldn\u2019t be free to attend a stupid prize ceremony.</p><br/><p>He wanted to immediately close the e-mail but he felt that it was a little disrespectful. Then, he replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have no time.\u201d</p><br/><p>He immediately sent it.</p><br/><p>After tasting the scallion pancake, Henry rushed back to France. On the way there, he talked to other Michelin food critics about Master Lin\u2019s three Michelin stars rating.</p><br/><p>A normal person would probably not care a lot about it.</p><br/><p>However, in the Chinese world of gourmets, it had created a huge impact.</p><br/><p>Those that knew how to make gourmet food would know that the Michelin company didn\u2019t really explore China. Today, Shanghai only had one restaurant that was awarded three Michelin stars, which was T\u2019ang Court.</p><br/><p>After T\u2019ang Court received three Michelin stars, those that wanted to dine there had to book at least two months in advance.</p><br/><p>It was the only three Michelin starred restaurant in the country.</p><br/><p>However, this time, this scallion pancake shop was also awarded three Michelin stars and that shocked everyone.</p><br/><p>A lot of media platforms were reporting about it online.</p><br/><p>In a short time, Master Lin\u2019s scallion pancakes became the most searched item online. Everyone knew that the nation only had one restaurant that was awarded three Michelin stars.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, what was more shocking was that the new restaurant that was awarded three stars only sold scallion pancakes.</p><br/><p>Everyone felt that it was literally impossible.</p><br/><p>The Michelin guidebook would have a list of restaurants that were ranked in each country and city. However, Master Lin\u2019s scallion pancakes actually entered the international guidebook.</p><br/><p>That meant that each country\u2019s guidebook included Master Lin\u2019s scallion pancakes.</p><br/><p>If Lin Fan were to know about it, he would probably be extremely frustrated.</p><br/><p>When he first started selling scallion pancakes, his only dream was to sell scallion pancakes all around the world. Wasn\u2019t it?</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t expect to have accomplished it so easily. It left him feeling helpless.</p><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue asked curiously, Brother Lin, did you reject the prize?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded, \u201cYeah, I rejected it. It\u2019s just a prize ceremony. I\u2019m not interested.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang was in awe. He almost kneeled down in front of Lin Fan. \u201cBrother Lin, other people would die to go for it and you actually ignored it. If people were to know about this, they\u2019d probably kill themselves.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled, \u201cI gotta stay low-key. It\u2019s nothing much anyway. Don\u2019t you guys already know about my scallion pancakes? I don\u2019t need a prize to prove its worth.\u201d</p><br/><p>That was true.</p><br/><p>On the Internet.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh my, I don\u2019t know what to say anymore. How can scallion pancakes be awarded three stars?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, the shop owners here at my neighborhood are really keeping up with the latest news. They actually pasted the newspaper headlines about the scallion pancakes with three Michelin stars.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s scary!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin is amazing.\u201d</p><br/><p>These netizens were just looking at the online news for fun.</p><br/><p>However, it was different this time. Master Lin was gaining pride for the country.</p><br/><p>He actually used scallion pancakes and made the Michelin food critics kneel down after eating it. Who else could be as powerful as him?</p><br/><p>Then, Lin Fan received a call from Wang Ming Yang.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, bro, you\u2019re amazing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot really. Why are you so emotional?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, I can\u2019t take it anymore. Stop acting like you\u2019re not a pro. How can your scallion pancakes get three Michelin stars? I\u2019m in awe.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you so emotional? Isn\u2019t it just an international organization? What\u2019s the big deal?\u201d</p><br/><p>The two of them chatted for a moment and Wang Ming Yang couldn\u2019t take it anymore.</p><br/><p>It was sick.</p><br/><p>Then, he received more calls that congratulated him.</p><br/><p>However, Lin Fan didn\u2019t really care about that. He felt that even if he got the Michelin stars, it wasn\u2019t something to be proud of.</p><br/><p>He was also capable of cooking Jiangsu cuisine very well. However, he wanted to stay low-key about it.</p><br/><p>The other shop owners also came forward to congratulate him. They felt that Little Boss was law-defying. They were really proud that the second restaurant that got three Michelin stars in the country was just beside their shops.</p><br/><p>The next day!</p><br/><p>The shop owners came early in the morning and they started doing business as usual.</p><br/><p>However, they realized that something was wrong.</p><br/><p>At 8 am.</p><br/><p>It was really noisy. When they reached their shops, they were dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>What was going on?</p><br/><p>A large group of townsfolk had arrived at Cloud Street. They were walking around.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s here. The scallion pancakes with three Michelin stars. It\u2019s here!\u201d</p><br/><p>,,.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is the second restaurant with three Michelin stars. I wonder how it\u2019s like legit</p><br/><p>\u201cBeing able to dine in a restaurant with three Michelin stars is a symbol of status.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian had opened the shop early in the morning. However, when he saw the large group of people outside, he felt that the world had changed.</p><br/><p>The entire street was filled with people. It was crazy. There were a lot more people than before.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s happening today?\u201d Fraud Tian mumbled to himself.</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang said, \u201cI think it\u2019s because of the Michelin stars. They\u2019re probably here to buy scallion pancakes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat can\u2019t be. There\u2019s so many of them. We only sell 10 pieces a day. How are they going to buy it?\u201d Fraud Tian said helplessly.</p><br/><p>Those usual customers that queued for scallion pancakes were dumbfounded when they saw the crowd on Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>They cried.</p><br/><p>\u201cI knew it. Once Master Lin got the three Michelin stars, there would be a lot more people fighting for the scallion pancakes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck, that\u2019s scary. How are we going to continue buying scallion pancakes in the future?\u201d</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan reaches his shop, he was stunned by the large crowd. There were so many people. It was unbelievable.</p><br/><p>He only sold ten pieces every day.</p><br/><p>The rules were going to stay the same.</p><br/><p>There were a lot of people today and many of them were there for the first time.</p><br/><p>When a lady came to buy the scallion pancakes, she took a picture of the crowd and sent it to her friends.</p><br/><p>Soon, a re-seller ran to her, \u201cBabe, can you sell the scallion pancake to me? $3000.\u201d</p><br/><p>The lady was stunned after hearing the price.</p><br/><p>$3000?</p><br/><p>She only spent $50 on it.</p><br/><p>She sold it without any hesitation. She didn\u2019t expect that there would be someone so stupid to offer so much money for a $50 scallion pancake.</p><br/><p>The re-seller left happily.</p><br/><p>The girl smiled happily and walked away. Then, another re-seller came. \u201cBabe, are you selling your scallion pancake?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI sold it to someone else for $3000. Do you think he\u2019s stupid?\u201d The girl laughed. It was her first time queueing and she didn\u2019t expect that to happen. Who would believe it?</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh? $3000? You actually sold it for $3000? D*mn, I should\u2019ve come here earlier.\u201d The re-seller felt like killing himself after hearing that she sold it for $3000.</p><br/><p>The market was changing rapidly.</p><br/><p>After Master Lin\u2019s scallion pancakes got three Michelin stars.</p><br/><p>The competition among all the rich people became more intense. The lowest price started from $30,000. Furthermore, there were a lot of wealthy men waiting for his scallion pancake. The reported prices were almost $60,000.</p><br/><p>The lady actually sold it for $3000. That re-seller must have earned a fortune.</p><br/><p>The lady looked at the man in despair and quickly walked away. She felt that this man was crazy.</p><br/><p>However, she felt happy again after she thought of her $3000.</p></div>\n</div>"}

Since it is the eleventh page of knowledge, a specialty of someone close to the host will be chosen.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sh*t, here we go again.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Lin Fan was very nervous. He had no idea what the eleventh page of knowledge would be but he was hoping to god that it was not some dishonest craft.</p><br/><p>However, based on the knowledge he had gotten in the past, none would be too bad. Therefore, his anxiousness was to a small extent.</p><br/><p>\u201cZhao Ming Qing has great admiration towards the host. However, besides traditional Chinese medicine, he does not have any specialties, so another person will be chosen.\u201d</p><br/><p>When he heard that it was going to be chosen from Zhao Ming Qing, he was very relieved. However, his relief was short lived.</p><br/><p>Motherf*cker. What was this situation? What did it mean by Zhao Ming Qing having no other specialties and having to choose again?</p><br/><p>At this moment, Lin Fan was very worried. He had no idea what kind of surprise the encyclopedia would throw up.</p><br/><p>\u201cTian Han Ming has a strong affection towards the host. Autumn Sword Fish Killer has a deep hatred for the host. One of them will be randomly chosen.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTian Han Ming has many specialties.

Thousands of thoughts were flowing through his head.</p><br/><p>Godly back-scrubbing technique</p><br/><p>Why do you have to mess with me like that?</p><br/><p>I\u2019m f*cked.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, what happened?\u201d Zhao Ming Qing saw his Master just blankly standing there so he couldn\u2019t help feeling worried.</p><br/><p>Could it be because he was too tired and it had brought about mental problems?</p><br/><p>Lin Fan awoke from his daze and very dispiritedly raised his hands and let out a sigh. He said, \u201cNothing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSigh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He wanted to kill himself. Why did it have to be like that? Then he looked at Zhao Ming Qing. Zhao Ming Qing was stunned. He realized that his teacher\u2019s gaze was very strong and he felt a little scared and softly said, \u201cTeacher, what\u2019s up?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan very sternly said, \u201cMing Qing, when you go back, I don\u2019t care what you do but, besides Chinese medicine, you better pick up other specialties. If you don\u2019t, you\u2019re not fit to be my disciple.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing was stunned and said, \u201cTeacher, I don\u2019t have the energy to learn other specialties.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shook his head and said, \u201cI don\u2019t care. Once you go back, you better pick up a hobby.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing felt helpless and said, \u201cOkay, Teacher, whatever you say. When I go back, I\u2019ll work hard at it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><br/><p>He felt like crying but the tears would not come. What in the world was this? Godly back-scrubbing technique? Scrub your f*cking head.</p><br/><p>Going to the bathhouse and else to scrubbing someone\u2019s back, that was basically asking for his life. He was such a powerful person but he had to scrub someone else\u2019s back. Sigh. F*ck. Just thinking about it was a pain in the a*s.</p><br/><p>However, if he did not do it, then the encyclopedia would be stuck on page 11 forever.</p><br/><p>\u201cForget it, I will think about it at home, no point thinking about it now,\u201d he thought.</p><br/><p>The next day.</p><br/><p>The news erupted online.</p><br/><p>\u2018The godly doctor has disappeared, no one knows where he is.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018These 20 days, the godly doctor gave us an indescribable amount of hope\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018The whole nation\u2019s medical treatment organizations are all trying to learn the godly doctor\u2019s methods. They are doing intensive research and vow to learn from the godly doctor.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Many major hospitals are trying to hire the godly doctor to be a professor or maybe even a lifelong specialist\u2019</p><br/><p>The netizens were all in deep discussion about this.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre these editors stupid? No one knows where the godly doctor is? Isn\u2019t he at Shanghai\u2019s Cloud Street?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThese useless editors. They don\u2019t even get their facts right before writing articles and only know how to sensationalize things.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI am really grateful to the godly doctor for turning me into a new person.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you, godly doctor, for saving my mother. From this day on, I owe him my life.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter this whole fiasco, my impression of traditional Chinese medicine has changed. Who knew that our ancestor\u2019s teachings are still so valid right now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTrue. All these Chinese doctors should be like the godly doctor. All those tactless Chinese doctors have all smeared the good name of Chinese medicine and made us lose trust in our ancestors.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m ready to personally head down to Cloud Street and give the godly doctor a banner.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGuys, take a look quickly. The godly doctor has posted on Weibo.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is big news.\u201d</p><br/><p>On Weibo.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cWith this volunteer medical work, I\u2019ve used up a lot of my inner strength. I need at least 10 years to recover it. If you have anyone who sick, please do not come and find me. I want to help but I don\u2019t have the in strength to do so. I will die if I try.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPfff. This is such a sour message to read, the godly doctor was here for such a short period of time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI told you all. How could this godly doctor have such amazing power? Turns out he had some inner power. But what in the world is that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet me explain this to everyone. What the godly doctor is trying to say is that he doesn\u2019t wish to see any more patients, so don\u2019t go looking for him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do this, godly doctor. You are a god to us.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe can empathize with this. After twenty days of volunteer medical work, seeing so many sick people. It must have been at least a thousand of them. It definitely must have sapped a lot of his energy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSapped my a*s. If there\u2019s a picture, it\u2019s the truth. See for yourselves.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>It was just a few pictures of Lin Fan holding some steamed buns and nibbling on them happily.</p><br/><p>Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>The shop owners were all gathered together.</p><br/><p>\u201cOur Little Boss is back. Let us give him a warm welcome back.\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Zhang said, \u201cWe definitely will. We need to make a giant banner for him. Little Boss is a godly doctor, who went to do volunteer medical work for 20 days. He is definitely a hero.\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Liang nodded and said, \u201cThat\u2019s right. Look at the townsfolk. They haven\u2019t been complaining about the lack of scallion pancakes as they have been touched by the Little Boss\u2019s actions.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sister Hong laughed and said, \u201cElder Chen must be filled with regret now. He was suffering in the hospital so much. Especially when he found out that Little Boss was a godly doctor, his intestines must have been filled with regret.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha. He didn\u2019t believe Little Boss and got what he deserved. Sigh, you\u2019ll have to beat me to death to get me to leave Cloud Street. It is so great being with Little Boss that I want to be neighbors with him forever.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI feel like Little Boss is our mascot here at Cloud Street.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, let\u2019s get to work. Little Boss is on the way back already.\u201d</p><br/><p>In the afternoon, Lin Fan could not help smiling when he stepped into familiar territory. He was finally back.</p><br/><p>The only thing was that he did not know if the residents would beat him to death or not. He felt that they probably would not since they loved him so much.</p><br/><p>His regular customers saw Lin Fan and immediately cried out in surprise, \u201cLittle Boss is back.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Boss is back.\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, the sound of firecrackers rang out.</p><br/><p>The shop owners all came out with a giant banner in their hands that said \u2018Welcome back Little Boss\u2019.</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan saw this, he was almost moved to tears. He was really emotional and realized how much he meant to them.</p><br/><p>In the crowd, a series disharmonious voices rang out.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Boss, you were gone for so long so you should sell twenty scallion pancakes a day now.\u201d</p><br/><p>His original feeling of being emotional disappeared. It turned out that they did not miss him but rather, missed his scallion pancakes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWoof woof\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Dog Nicholas rushed to Lin Fan. Lin Fan had not seen him for twenty days and it looked like he had grown in size. Also, it looked like he was running on his two legs a lot better now.</p><br/><p>Elder Dog Nicholas was sticking out his tongue and was full of joy. He was running circles around Lin Fan, looking really happy.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan had not seen Lin Fan in a long time so she was all smiles when she finally saw him.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian gave him the thumbs up, showing his approval.</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang started a live broadcast and shouted, \u201cLittle Boss is back!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p></div>\n</div>"}

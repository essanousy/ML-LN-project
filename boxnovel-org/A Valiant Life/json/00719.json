He flipped open the last card. \u201cSorry, Lady Yun. I\u2019ve won this round once again.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yun Xue Yao\u2019s expression was calm. She didn\u2019t look sad, nor did she look happy. \u201cYour cards are really big, Mr. Zhang.\u201d</p><br/><p>Her chips had all been lost. Meanwhile, on Zhang Yuan\u2019s side, the chips were piled up plentifully.</p><br/><p>As Ou Xing Yun stood at the side, he was sweating with anxiety. He had been watching closely the whole time but he couldn\u2019t find a single problem. Also, the room was filled with surveillance cameras and people were analyzing it from the monitoring room. However, the situation was the same. They couldn\u2019t find a single problem.</p><br/><p>Yun Xue Yao looked at Ou Xing Yun but what she got back was a shake of his head.</p><br/><p>At the same time, she received news from the monitoring room as well via her earphones, saying that they did not find any issues either.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow is it, Lady Yun? You\u2019ve already lost all your chips. Are you going to continue or not?\u201d said Zhang Yuan with a grin. His thumb was rubbing against his index finger as if he already had her cornered.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll carry on,\u201d said Yun Xue Yao coldly. Her unyielding heart was bursting forth.</p><br/><p>Ou Yun Xing, who was standing at the side, wanted to warn her against it. But before he could say anything, Lady Yun said, \u201cGet the chips.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Yuan smiled, \u201cLady Yun, how about this? This $100,000,000 that I have was won from this place of yours. Your Wynn Casino is pretty good and it\u2019s the only place that has allowed me to win until now. You guys can afford to lose so much. If I add in another $100,000,000, I wonder if Lady Yun would still dare to gamble with me.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, the atmosphere in the room suddenly quietened down.</p><br/><p>Yun Xue Yao\u2019s heart was starting to surrender. She had never expected the opposition to play so big.</p><br/><p>Ou Xing Yun\u2019s expression changed. \u201cYou can\u2019t do it, Lady Yun.\u201d</p><br/><p>She really couldn\u2019t. Anyone would have been able to tell that the opposition\u2019s skills were much better than hers. If she carried on, she would lose for sure.</p><br/><p>Moreover, $200,000,000 was no small sum. If she lost it, she would be in trouble.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yuan raised an eyebrow. \u201cIf Lady Yun doesn\u2019t dare, then say so. If you can\u2019t afford to place so many chips at the moment, we can set different conditions.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat conditions?\u201d asked Yun Xue Hao as she raised her head. Although she maintained her cool as she said it, a few droplets of sweat had already formed on her forehead.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bet a hand of mine on top of these $200,000,000 for Lady Yun\u2019s body,\u201d said Zhang Yuan.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not possible,\u201d before Yun Xue Yao said anything, Ou Xing Yun swiftly replied, \u201cDon\u2019t be absurd. Do you know who you\u2019re talking to? Even if you win, do you think you would be able to leave Haojiang?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Yuan smiled, \u201cAlright, since you can\u2019t afford it, then let\u2019s end this here. I guess this is all there is to the Yun family. Thinking back to when Lady Yun\u2019s grandfather was young, he would have an imposing manner as he gambled with others. I never thought that the successor of the Yun family wouldn\u2019t have a single shred of grandeur.\u201d After saying this, he stood up to leave.</p><br/><p>Ou Xing Yun\u2019s teeth were trembling with rage. He hadn\u2019t expected the opposition to be so impudent. Zhang Yuan was clearly using his immense strength to oppress a young person.</p><br/><p>Now, he was even using words to infuriate them.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait.\u201d After staying silent for a while, Yun Xue Yao stood up furiously. \u201cI\u2019ll add $200,000,000 and my hand as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright,\u201d Zhang Yuan agreed without a shred of hesitation.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll show our cards immediately and compare them.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Ou Xing Yun saw this, he was at a loss. Then, he quickly moved aside and instructed the people at the side quietly, \u201cQuick, notify Mr. Yun. Tell him that a problem has occurred here.\u201d</p><br/><p>He was also very anxious. Why was Master Lin not there yet?</p><br/><p>If Master Lin came, nothing could go wrong.</p><br/><p>The cards were dealt!</p><br/><p>One by one, the cards appeared.</p><br/><p>Yun Xue Yao: A, 9, 5, 6</p><br/><p>Zhang Yuan: A, K, 10, 9</p><br/><p>Just with these four cards, Yun Xue Yao had already lost. Even there was a pair, there would only be one.</p><br/><p>As for Zhang Yuan, his single cards were already bigger than Yun Xue Yao\u2019s. The chances of her winning were very very low.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Zhang Yuan smiled, \u201cLady Yun, your cards don\u2019t look too good.\u201d Then, he flipped over a card. \u201cAnother 10. I have a pair. Lady Yun, you can look at your card.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ou Xing Yun\u2019s brows furrowed. There was only one chance of winning and that chance was way too small.</p><br/><p>Even now, they couldn\u2019t tell how the opposition was cheating. Hence, the cards were unknown to them.</p><br/><p>Although Yun Xue Yao appeared to be calm, her heart was beating extremely quickly. She flipped over the card with her fingers. Suddenly, her eyes gaped wide open.</p><br/><p>It was a 9.</p><br/><p>It was over. It was all over.</p><br/><p>Although she was expressionless, her pupils showed fear.</p><br/><p>Zhang Yuan smiled confidently, \u201cLady Yun, your skills aren\u2019t too good. I\u2019m guessing that your card is a 9. You\u2019re going to lose for sure. However, for someone as beautiful as Lady Yun to lose a hand, that would really affect your attractiveness. Why don\u2019t I let you pick again? Your body or your hand?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ou Xing Yun said angrily, \u201cIs there a need to be so absolute?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Yuan shrugged. \u201cLady Yun is Mr. Yun\u2019s precious granddaughter. If she decides to act like she didn\u2019t lose, an insignificant person like me wouldn\u2019t be able to do anything.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need, I can take the loss,\u201d said Yun Xue Yao through gritted teeth. Then, she picked up the card and wanted to open it.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t\u2026\u201d Ou Xing Yun panicked. He wanted to stop her from opening the card. If she opened it, then everything would be concluded.</p><br/><p>And he knew that the opposition didn\u2019t want Lady Yun\u2019s hand to be broken at all because if Mr. Yun came, they would definitely negotiate.</p><br/><p>Perhaps Zhang Yuan knew that, since young, Mr. Yun had always been true to his word and would be willing to pay when he lost.</p><br/><p>Even if it was Lady Yun who lost a gamble, she had to admit her loss. To settle this matter, she would probably have to pay a considerable price.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Yun Xue Yao realized that her hand had been seized by someone.</p><br/><p>Initially, she had wanted to yank her hand away. However, when she looked up, she was startled. Her originally anxious face turned slightly red.</p><br/><p>The two of them traded looks. She realized that this unknown man was smiling at her. Then, a voice rang in her ear.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet me open it.\u201d</p><br/><p>*patter*</p><br/><p>The card\u2019s face appeared.</p><br/><p>To Yun Xue Yao\u2019s shock, that card which had originally been a 9 had turned into an A.</p><br/><p>This\u2026this\u2026</p><br/><p>Yun Xue Yao looked up in shock at that man. She was clearly in disbelief as she didn\u2019t know how that was possible.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, you\u2019re here.\u201d Ou Xing Yun\u2019s originally worried expression had turned into one of delight.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled, \u201cI\u2019ve been here for a few minutes and I\u2019ve been watching from the side.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye Zhen Ming heaved a sigh of relief. He was finally here. Otherwise, things would have been terrible.</p><br/><p>Yun Xue Yao\u2019s beautiful gaze fell on Lin Fan\u2019s body. She couldn\u2019t understand how that card had been changed. How was that possible?</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not possible.\u201d At that moment, Zhang Yuan stood up. With a look of shock, he snarled, \u201cYou cheated. Her card couldn\u2019t have been an A.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled, \u201cIt has always been an A. How have I cheated?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not possible. It\u2019s not possible. You must have changed it. There must be another another of the same card in the deck.\u201d Zhang Yuan couldn\u2019t keep his cool. He immediately opened the poker box and looked for the same A card.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Ou Xing Yun had wanted to stop him. After all, he knew that Master Lin must have cheated because Lady Yun\u2019s card had indeed been a 9 at first. If Zhang Yuan searched the poker box, he would definitely find the same A card.</p><br/><p>However, Master Lin stopped Ou Xing Yun. He let Zhang Yuan continue searching.</p><br/><p>After emptying the poker box, the look of shock was on Zhang Yuan\u2019s face was amplified. And he wasn\u2019t the only one shocked, even Ou Xing Yun and Yun Xue Yao were dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>That card could not be found. Moreover, the 9 from before had appeared in the poker box. How was this possible? When had it been placed inside the box?</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is not possible,\u201d Zhang Yuan snarled, \u201cI\u2019ll play a round with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Initially, Lin Fan had just wanted to come and see how Zhang Yuan cheated. However, there was no such need now. Zhang Yuan had already lost everything, what more could he gamble with? Even if he cheated, there was nothing he could do.</p><br/><p>This was already unimportant. What was important was that Zhang Yuan had actually gambled his hand. That was unexpected.</p><br/><p>Now that things had concluded, if he wanted to go another round, he would have to chop off his hand first.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan extended his index finger and waved his hand. \u201cYou\u2019re too weak. You\u2019ve already lost. Just think about which hand you want to get chopped off first.\u201d</p><br/><p>After hearing those words, Zhang Yuan\u2019s face turned white.</p><br/><p>Yun Xue Yao recovered from her daze. Her expression was calm. \u201cI\u2019ll give you two choices now. The first is to get your hand chopped off. The second is to admit that you have been cheating and scram off from Haojiang. You wouldn\u2019t be allowed to come near here again. Choose for yourself.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, Zhang Yuan was frustrated. His heart was still unyielding but he was helpless. \u201cI choose the second option.\u201d</p><br/><p>This was not what he wanted at all. He had been just about to have his wishes fulfilled. How did this happen?</p><br/><p>Yun Xue Yao\u2019s cold gaze fell on him. Her lips opened slightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cScram!\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

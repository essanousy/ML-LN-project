Quick! Assemble! Director Huang is waiting for us below.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Did a problem occur?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard that Shanghai\u2019s Master Lin has come and he has already broken the main door. He\u2019s coming towards us now. We have to go and stop him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, it can\u2019t be. Will we be able to stop him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHeh. You really overestimate that Lin. We have so many people. How could we not be able to bring him down? Remember this: Two hands can\u2019t fend off four fists. Even the hungry tiger is afraid of a pack of wolves.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. We\u2019re not a bunch of wimps. I didn\u2019t think a famous person would actually come. If I can get two punches in, that would feel amazing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha, let\u2019s go. Hurry up and assemble. Let\u2019s see if he\u2019ll be able to crush us or not.\u201d</p><br/><p>Huang Hao looked at this group of people contently. Then, he said with a stern tone, \u201cEveryone, listen up. Today, someone very impudent has come and he says that he\u2019s going to crush our Beijing association. Are you going to take that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><br/><p>Their voices were resounding and imposing.</p><br/><p>Huang Hao nodded. \u201cAlright. Since you won\u2019t take that, let\u2019s show him our power. Follow me! Since he doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s good for him, we\u2019ll let him have a taste of our strength.\u201d</p><br/><p>The group set off confidently. They were all elite members of the association and their kung fu was powerful. Although they didn\u2019t have much real battle experience, they could easily break wooden planks with their hands and legs.</p><br/><p>In the distance, Lin Fan had stopped in his tracks. He was holding his phone and speaking to Wang Ming Yang on the phone.</p><br/><p>\u201cMmm. I\u2019m already in Beijing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang was dazed. His brother had gone all the way to Beijing in the blink of an eye. Was there a need to be so quick? However, he wasn\u2019t worried about that. Instead, he was worried about something else. \u201cWill you be able to make it for dinner? Or will we have to wait for you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan: \u201cI will. Since I said that I\u2019ll come, I\u2019ll definitely come. Unless I end up in jail.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang sighed. \u201cAlright. Just do your thing. If you really get arrested, I\u2019ll come to Beijing to bail you out.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed. \u201cThere\u2019s no need. I know quite a lot of people in Beijing. Moreover, I\u2019m just making friends through martial arts. This is the Beijing association, isn\u2019t it very normal for someone to come and challenge them? It\u2019s not like I\u2019ll beat them up very badly.\u201d</p><br/><p>In front, a group of people had come and appeared in Lin Fan\u2019s line of sight.</p><br/><p>Huang Hao led the big group of them. But when he saw that Master Lin was still in the mood to be talking on the phone, the fury in his heart burned up.</p><br/><p><em>Despicable. Simply despicable. Even at such a time, he\u2019s still talking on the phone. Does he even think anything of us at all?</em></p><br/><p><em>I have to teach this guy a lesson. Otherwise, he won\u2019t know our power.</em></p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cAlright, I\u2019m hanging up. Get your wife to cook something delicious. I\u2019m a picky eater.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang: \u201cGot it. Don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan kept his phone.</p><br/><p>Huang Hao immediately went forward. With a furious look on his face, he said, \u201cMaster Lin, what\u2019s the meaning of this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at all these people. \u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Huang Hao snarled, \u201cI\u2019m the Security Director here. What exactly are you trying to do, coming all the way from Shanghai?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved his hand. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to do much. I just want to ask who exactly gave the order. Hurry up and call your president out. I want an explanation.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re being absurd. Has our association door offended you? You just broke it like that. Don\u2019t you know that you\u2019re damaging our property? I\u2019ll give you two choices now. One, compensate, apologize, and leave. Two, we\u2019ll send you out.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, Huang Hao was really enraged. He hadn\u2019t expected this Master Lin to really be so unbridled. He had bought a same-day airplane ticket to come over here. He was giving no respect to their association at all.</p><br/><p>Moreover, the Beijing association was the headquarters of the Shanghai association. He was offending his superiors.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Lin Fan entered his fighting stance and gestured for them to come at him.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Huang Hao couldn\u2019t understand it. <em>What the f*ck are you trying to do? Must you be so lawless?</em></p><br/><p>Huang Hao had held this appointment for a long time but he had never come across someone so ferocious. This Master Lin wasn\u2019t giving them face at all. Could it be that he really wanted to defy nature?</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said calmly, \u201cI\u2019m crushing you all. You can come at me now. Don\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t injure you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Huang Hao was enraged. They had several tens of people while the opposition was just one man. Did this man really think he was some kind of hero who could defeat a whole group of experts?</p><br/><p>\u201cDirector, I can\u2019t take this anymore. This Master Lin is too impudent. This is our Beijing association!\u201d</p><br/><p>Some people couldn\u2019t take it any longer. This man was outrightly challenging them.</p><br/><p>\u201cGet him out of here!\u201d Huang Hao bellowed.</p><br/><p>At that moment, everyone charged towards Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan, on the other hand, had a calm look on his face. He definitely wouldn\u2019t injure these members. He would just make them lose their ability to move temporarily.</p><br/><p>When some of the surrounding people saw this, they were completely dumbfounded. Things had really erupted.</p><br/><p>Some of them took out their phones and started recording videos.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, some of them were swallowing their saliva as they watched unblinkingly. They had no idea how this would end up.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, it hurts!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t hit my face!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLin, this isn\u2019t somewhere you can be unbridled. Argh, f*ck, it hurts!\u201d</p><br/><p>At that instant, miserable cries were heard. Every one of the members was hugging their legs. Their legs felt numb and sore. And it hurt very much.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan had hit their acupuncture points to numb their legs temporarily. After all, this was a lawful society where peace was important. He definitely couldn\u2019t injure others.</p><br/><p>In half an hour, these people would be able to stand up and start moving about again. As for now, they could just lie on the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cEat my fist!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cArgh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>In an instant, the place was in a mess.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan calmly stepped forward. No matter how many people there were, they had a hard time getting close to him.</p><br/><p>Those spectating members saw this and were astounded.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s too strong.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cScary. This isn\u2019t human. Even with so many people, they can\u2019t even touch his sleeves. This\u2026this\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Huang Hao was dumbfounded. His jaw had dropped as he stood rooted to the ground. He hadn\u2019t expected that all these people he had brought would be beaten down in an instant.</p><br/><p>Looking at those members lying on the ground and unable to stand, he had no idea what to do.</p><br/><p>Suddenly!</p><br/><p>Lin Fan came in front Huang Hao and placed his palm on Huang Hao\u2019s shoulder. Then, he pinched lightly and Huang Hao instantly felt as if all his energy had been drained. He fell to the ground with a thud as he screamed in pain.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt hurts!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan glanced at him and shook his head helplessly. \u201cI already said that I was going to crush you. Now, just lie down on the ground. Everything will be fine soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, he didn\u2019t care about these people any longer. He left straightaway.</p></div>\n</div>"}

After the Nobel Prize incident, the prescription went viral.</p><br/><p>Foreign citizens all found out about the existence of the prescription.</p><br/><p>Diseases are not divided by countries. There were similar incurable diseases everywhere. But suddenly, someone actually said that such an illness could be cured and it had even been said on such a grand stage by a morally upright scientist.</p><br/><p>At that moment, who would not believe it?</p><br/><p>However, the foreigners were a little helpless and also a little confused because they had no idea how to brew Chinese medicine.</p><br/><p>Hence, shop owners who ran Chinese medicine shops overseas were all laughing. They felt that a drastic change had occurred in their businesses. They had never experienced something being so popular.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-2\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan had already stopped caring about the Nobel Prize incident. This was just something that happened on the side to him. How could he think so much about it?</p><br/><p>As for his life right now, he was very content.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian looked at Lin Fan. \u201cHow can you still sit still? Don\u2019t you feel even a little bit excited?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExcited?\u201d Lin Fan was surprised. \u201cExcited my a*s. I don\u2019t feel anything at all.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian shook his head helplessly. \u201cIt takes too much to excite you. It\u2019s like we aren\u2019t even on the same wavelength.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan felt very helpless too. He had never wanted to be this famous. He just wanted to pass his days normally and in a relaxed manner. As for fame and what not, other people could raise his fame for him. He would just watch them quietly as they sang his praises. He wouldn\u2019t stop them.</p><br/><p>*Ding ding!*</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-3\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>At that moment, a call from Zhao Ming Qing came.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, I just found out that Chinese medicine shops overseas have become very popular. Lots of people are buying medicine from Chinese medicine shops.\u201d Zhao Ming Qing was exhilarated. This was what he had always wanted to see but up until now, he had never been able to make it happen.</p><br/><p>Now, all thanks to his teacher, the change had gradually happened. This made him very excited.</p><br/><p>He believed that if he continued working hard, he would definitely realize his dream.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis\u2026\u201d Lin Fan found it hard to reply to that. <em>What does that even have to do with me? </em>However, he felt that it was pretty good that Chinese medicine had become popular. And it was a good thing that his disciple was so happy too.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, I\u2019ve been preparing a Chinese medicine-related article recently and I\u2019m going to take advantage of the current situation and publish it so that it will raise Chinese medicine\u2019s reputation on the international stage even further. Also, I\u2019ve picked a few global diseases and looked at the causes and treatment possibilities from a Chinese medicine point of view. Teacher, could you help to check and correct my work afterward?\u201d Zhao Ming Qing had high morale. He had already decided what he was going to do from then on.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled. \u201cSure. Finish writing it, then let me take a look. This is your project, of course, I will support you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although he was afraid of trouble, he was still willing to help out as he saw his disciple being so excited.</p><br/><p>They hung up.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan saw that Brother Lin was sitting there, looking very bored, so she came over and started massaging his shoulders.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-4\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cElder Wang, where are you going?\u201d Lin Fan saw that Elder Wang was carrying big and small bags and walking past the shop entrance in a hurry, so he couldn\u2019t help but ask.</p><br/><p>Elder Wang stopped in his tracks and replied with a smile, \u201cI\u2019m going to attend a conference to enrich myself.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, you have the heart to learn. Not bad. Not bad at all.\u201d Lin Fan smiled and didn\u2019t say much about it.</p><br/><p>Elder Wang said, \u201cLittle Boss, I\u2019m going to go first. I\u2019m going to be late.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved at him. \u201cGo on, go on.\u201d</p><br/><p>The next day!</p><br/><p>The news agencies revealed the situation overseas.</p><br/><p>This kind of thing couldn\u2019t be hidden from the people. Besides China, citizens of other countries had started taking action as well.</p><br/><p>There was a huge number of leukemia sufferers across the globe. Initially, when they had been undergoing treatment, they hadn\u2019t had much hope left in their hearts. However, when this glimmer of hope appeared, they became excited.</p><br/><p>To them, Chinese medicine was a distant and unfamiliar thing. It could even be said to be unreal to them.</p><br/><p>However, when Hall said what he had said during the Nobel Prize Award Ceremony, it shocked the entire world.</p><br/><p>When Chinese medicine shops erupted in popularity overseas, the reporters naturally knew about it.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-5\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Some large news organizations had departments overseas. Naturally, they conducted interviews at once to bring back the latest updates.</p><br/><p>\u2018Chinese medicine shops have become exceptionally popular overseas. They are packed to the brim.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018The Nobel Prize Award Ceremony has shone a light on the leukemia prescription. In overseas Chinatowns, Chinese medicine shops have become popular as countless people are purchasing the medicine.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Patients have said that China\u2019s Chinese medicine is really too mystical. It has given them new hope.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Overseas Chinese medicine shop owners are thanking Master Lin.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Master Lin, the man who pushed Chinese medicine into progress.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>When some netizens saw these news articles, they were shocked.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn. It has broken into the international market just like that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI suddenly feel very proud, especially when I saw those foreigners queuing up. I took a photo of the Chinese medicine shop below my home where I can buy whatever I want with ease.\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-6\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cI feel like our country should give him a lifelong honorary award. Master Lin conquered leukemia. In the future, if anyone contracts the disease, he or she can just act as if it is a common flu.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI hope that Master Lin will develop even more prescriptions. That would really be fantastic.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re dreaming. If Master Lin develops even more prescriptions, the hospitals will kill him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. That makes sense indeed.\u201d</p><br/><p>The netizens were feeling proud and emotional. <em>Our culture has finally spread to the world. </em>Just thinking about that made them emotional.</p><br/><p>However, they wouldn\u2019t forget the greatest contributor, Master Lin. If it hadn\u2019t been for Master Lin, this would not have been possible at all.</p><br/><p>Also, when the reporters interviewed people overseas who were purchasing Chinese medicine, their answers made the netizens feel great as well.</p><br/><p>They had all kinds of praise for China, as well as for Master Lin.</p><br/><p>This made the netizens feel exceptionally good.</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan saw these news articles, he had a helpless look on his face. He had not expected to become so popular. However, being able to help some sick people regain their health was the happiest thing.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-7\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>These illnesses were not things that could be avoided just because one wanted to avoid them. They were considered unpredictable misfortunes.</p><br/><p>Soon after.</p><br/><p>Another news article appeared.</p><br/><p>The Nobel Foundation had immediately started their investigations after the ceremony had ended. When they confirmed this incident, they were astounded.</p><br/><p>They did not expect it to really be true.</p><br/><p>If Hall had taken the award instead of talking about this incident, they wouldn\u2019t have had the chance to change the decision. If that had happened and the truth was to be exposed later on, it would probably be reported as a case of corruption and shady business.</p><br/><p>Hence, they were grateful to Hall for this.</p><br/><p>At the same time, they quickly made the statement that the Nobel Prize in Medicine would be presented to China\u2019s Chinese medicine master, Lin Fan, along with the bountiful award money.\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

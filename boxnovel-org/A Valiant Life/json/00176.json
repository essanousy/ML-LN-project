What was Master Lin trying to do? Had he gone crazy?</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang looked at WeChat and was stunned. \"Master Lin, you're too awesome. That was insane.\"</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan laughed hysterically after reading what he wrote. She realized that at times, there was a humorous side to Master Lin too.</p><br/><p>On Weibo.</p><br/><p>Twilight Sad Melody: \"666\u2026, Master Lin has nature-defying abilities.\"</p><br/><p>Zhou Shi Yan: \"Master Lin, you're hilarious. Do you want to take my credit card?\"</p><br/><p>Purple Wind Maniac: \"I'm impressed by Master Lin.\"</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>Lin Fan had not thought of a good way to destroy them. Furthermore, he didn't have any evidence either, but he knew that these two people were inhumane beasts. Despite others backing down, he didn't want to give up.</p><br/><p>Initially, he wanted to ask people to do their part and repost the content. Now, things were different. If I don't fight to the death with you, my surname isn't Lin!=</p><br/><p>Jiang Li and Chen Juan weren't worried at all. The incident should have ended there. But when they saw the Weibo post, they were infuriated. Was this guy crazy? Things were getting out of hand. Now, he even scolded them on social media. This Master Lin seemed too arrogant.</p><br/><p>Jiang Li: \"Could this Master Lin please remove his post from Weibo? Otherwise, Chen Juan and I will deal with you accordingly by law.\"</p><br/><p>He didn't want to have a quarrel with someone like that. Only the two of them knew what had happened. Also, due to special reasons, this incident had already been suppressed and covered up. At the same time, there wasn't any evidence even after a few days. Still, Master Lin kept insisting that something was wrong and didn't want to let them off. But they weren't afraid at all. Lin Fan just felt that these people needed to be taught a lesson.</p><br/><p>When Jiang Li sent out the message on Weibo, Lin Fan immediately replied.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan: \"@Jiang Li @Chen Juan, recently, I had two people that tried to threaten me. But now they're dead to me. If you want to sue me, go ahead. I'll be waiting. If not, you're just losers.\"</p><br/><p>\"Master Lin is humiliating the two of them.\"</p><br/><p>\"I admire you, Master Lin. But besides admiration, there's really nothing else.\"</p><br/><p>\"Yeah. This incident has already been concluded. It's useless for Master Lin to do this.\"</p><br/><p>\"Hey\u2026 Although it doesn't have much impact, it still helps.\"</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was flaming the two of them on Weibo and he knew that this wouldn't even harm them. But he still did it because he was extremely furious.</p><br/><p>At Starlight!</p><br/><p>Jiang Li was extremely angry. He didn't even know where this Master Lin came from. But he was like a mad dog biting onto them, not wanting to let them off. Then, he made a call.</p><br/><p>\"Master Lin's Weibo is flaming Chen Juan and me. I hope you can ban it.\"</p><br/><p>\"Professor Jiang, I'm sorry. We advocate freedom of speech on Weibo. It was posted on his personal page. Qi Yi Weibo can't ban his Weibo account just based on this. If you'd like to, you could sue him.\"</p><br/><p>Jiang Li was speechless.</p><br/><p>Chen Juan said, \"You don't have to bother about this Weibo frenzy. This incident has already been concluded. The discussions online were also removed. It won't cause much of a problem.\"</p><br/><p>Jiang Li said unhappily, \"Aren't we going to sue him then?\"</p><br/><p>Chen Juan just smiled, \"Yeah, but now's not the time. He's taking joy in flaming us, isn't he? I'm going to employ the internet trolls to repost his posts. As long as it can create a certain impact, we can sue him for slander.</p><br/><p>Jiang Li slapped his thigh and smiled widely. Then, he said, \"Good idea. Let him continue flaming then.\"</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>At night!</p><br/><p>The shop was closed. Everyone was feeling a little bored and helpless. The main reason was that the way the opposing parties had handled the situation was extremely ruthless. They just wanted to shut everyone down and not let anyone have a chance to speak.</p><br/><p>When they were closing the shop, Elder Dog Nicholas came over and entered the shop slowly.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian said, \"Don't be angry, you already did your best.\"</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan nodded as well. She felt that Master Lin was indeed a good person to not be fearful of opposing such people.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled, \"I'm not angry. There will be a conclusion to this. Sometimes justice gets lazy and falls asleep. Let's just wait.\"</p><br/><p>\"Haha.\"</p><br/><p>Everyone laughed and agreed with what Master Lin said.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved his hands and said, \"Alright, I'm leaving now.\"</p><br/><p>Of course, Lin Fan knew that sometimes justice wouldn't prevail on its own. Someone had to give it a push.</p><br/><p>But now, even he didn't know what to do. This incident was a tough nut to crack.</p><br/><p>In the car.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang called. When he picked up, Wang Ming Yang just laughed on the phone.</p><br/><p>\"I spent my entire day looking at Weibo. You're too d*mn awesome.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled, \"That's not awesome. I just scolded them. I can't do anything else to them.\"</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang replied, \"Don't be too pessimistic. You already did your best for this. That's how society works. Some things can't be resolved by brute force. Furthermore, Starlight isn't so simple. There are a few departments that are handling this.\"</p><br/><p>\"Oh, right. Don't be manipulated by them. There isn't any evidence online now. It's difficult to say how the final outcome will be like. People nowadays are extremely cunning. They act like they're the victim but they're the ones benefiting from it. It's complicated, extremely complicated.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled, \"Don't worry, I understand that. I read their fortunes. These two people are not any good.\"</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang was shocked. \"You could still read their fortunes?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \"What do you think? Alright, let's not talk anymore. I'm driving now. It's difficult to talk.\"</p><br/><p>\"Alright.\"</p><br/><p>He hung up and focused on driving.</p><br/><p>When he reached home, he switched on the television. He felt extremely gloomy. He took a shower and lay down on the sofa while watching the television.</p><br/><p>The news channel.</p><br/><p>\"Today, a hacker named 'Heavenly Wolf Dog' got arrested for hacking into tablets to steal the information of others. The following are today's news\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan had just closed his eyes. He was about to take a nap but he was stunned by this news. D*mn, a hacker could be that awesome? That's sick.=</p><br/><p>Then, he watched the news carefully. It only explained the incident briefly without much background information. However, he did a search online and the results were astounding.</p><br/><p>This 'Heavenly Wolf Dog' hacker was indeed awesome. He hadn't just stolen the information of others. He also controlled the tablet and used the camera function to capture the actions of the victims. That was way too sick.</p><br/><p>But this 'Heavenly Wolf Dog' was quite pathetic. Based on what was described online, this hacker had hacked into the computer of a female idol that he loved. When the camera was activated, the female idol had been changing her clothes. He was instantly captivated. He didn't know that the Internet police were tracking him and they immediately arrested him when they found his ID.</p><br/><p>This showed that 'Heavenly Wolf Dog' was a pro hacker but he couldn't protect himself.</p><br/><p>Of course, nobody knew the actual situation.</p><br/><p>*smack*</p><br/><p>Lin Fan slapped his thigh. He realized that he had the Encyclopedia and it definitely contained hacking skills. Then, he opened up the Encyclopedia and started searching. But when he found the page for hacking, he was shocked.</p><br/><p>The Encyclopedic Points required were a little too much. He couldn't afford it at all.</p><br/><p>Also, this page for hacking skills didn't contain any sub-classification. It was just a major class on its own. It actually required a thousand Encyclopedic Points.</p><br/><p>Helplessness...</p><br/><p>But then, Lin Fan realized that things weren't what he had thought.</p><br/><p>The Encyclopedia still had some humaneness to it.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

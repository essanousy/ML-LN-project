They\u2019ve scored. It was simply too beautiful.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis goalkeeper is too incredible. If Golden Flowers had him in the past, they wouldn\u2019t have lost at all. They would\u2019ve overturned the entire football world long ago.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. In fact, the worst that could happen is a draw. That would be nothing much at all.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is simply too scary. My decision to watch this match has been so worth it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha. Those idiots. I told them to come and watch the match but they didn\u2019t want to. Now, they\u2019ve missed this amazing moment. I think they will regret it for life.\u201d</p><br/><p>The audience was in an uproar. They had finally scored. However, the audience knew that the credit for this goal belonged to the goalkeeper.</p><br/><p>If it hadn\u2019t been for that goalkeeper, scoring would have only been a dream.</p><br/><p>A single man had overcome everyone else. He was simply too powerful.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Wu Ze was so excited that he was trembling. His blood was boiling.</p><br/><p>This match was definitely explosive. Master Lin was really too powerful.</p><br/><p>In the audience stands, Huang Jun\u2019s hand which was holding his phone had started trembling. He suddenly realized that this match was f*cking unreal. If he wasn\u2019t seeing it for himself, he wouldn\u2019t have dared to believe it at all.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan, on the other hand, was a little bored. When the blocked several shots a while ago, it had felt pretty good. But after a few times, he had started to lose interest.</p><br/><p>Instead, he realized that he wasn\u2019t suitable for football because he would ruin this excellent sport.</p><br/><p>The fun part of any kind of competition is that there is a chance of winning and losing. That makes for an intense competition.</p><br/><p>If there is no suspense involved, then it would really be too boring.</p><br/><p>The Yokohama F. Marino coach saw the situation and was completely dumbfounded. He immediately called for a timeout to re-strategize.</p><br/><p>But then, after his players attacked a few more times and completely failed, the coach was dazed. He just sat down without saying a single word as if he had given up all hope.</p><br/><p>At this moment, the Yokohama F. Marinos players had understood that, as long as the Golden Flowers had their Godly goalkeeper on the field, they wouldn\u2019t be able to score no matter what they tried.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan had caught the ball countless times. Whenever the opposition tried to score, he would toss the ball back to them to give them a few more tries.</p><br/><p>But unfortunately, not a single one succeeded.</p><br/><p>The match ended. 5-0.</p><br/><p>The Yokohama F. Marinos players couldn\u2019t accept such a result. This time, they had come here with the plan of completely crushing the Golden Flowers.</p><br/><p>But now, they had been beaten to such a state.</p><br/><p>At the moment that the match ended, the spectators celebrated once more.</p><br/><p>Wang Fei and his teammates charged over and raised Lin Fan up into the air. \u201cMaster Lin, you\u2019re way too powerful!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have never seen such a valiant goalkeeper!\u201d</p><br/><p>They all knew that, if it hadn\u2019t been for Master Lin, their chances of winning this match would\u2019ve been very low.</p><br/><p>But after Master Lin joined, this win simply came too easily.</p><br/><p>In the end, they didn\u2019t even have to defend. They just stood on the opposition\u2019s side of the field. Every time, Master Lin wouldn\u2019t disappoint. He would catch the ball and throw it over to them.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed. \u201cAlright, put me down. I was just defending the goal post. The scoring was still done by you guys.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Fei said, \u201cMaster Lin, you\u2019re way too humble. If it wasn\u2019t for you, it would\u2019ve been really difficult for us to score.\u201d</p><br/><p>At the coaches\u2019 stands.</p><br/><p>Wu Ze rushed forward to Lin Fan with a look of gratitude on his face. \u201cMaster Lin, I\u2019m really so grateful for you. But where did you learn to be a goalkeeper? You\u2019re way too good!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled helplessly. <em>Why would I even have to learn? All I did was rely on my reflexes.</em></p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, why don\u2019t you stop selling scallion pancakes and become our goalkeeper instead. I believe that, with you, we won\u2019t lose any matches at all,\u201d said Wu Ze enthusiastically.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cCoach Wu, I think it\u2019s better not to do that. I don\u2019t have any wishes to become a football star.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan came to Lin Fan side. Her heart was overflowing with pride. She had wanted to bring Brother Lin to watch the match but she hadn\u2019t expected Brother Lin to go on the field himself.</p><br/><p>Moreover, he had given her an unmatches and unsurpassable display of goalkeeping.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, let\u2019s go back. I\u2019ve had my fun.\u201d He had had his fun and it was time to go back.</p><br/><p>Wu Ze and the rest couldn\u2019t bear to see him leave. They still wanted to have a good chat with him. The players, in particular, really wanted him to stay. After all, that match that they had just had was probably the most comfortable and easy match that they had ever played in their lives.</p><br/><p>Because they hadn\u2019t had to think about defending at all and they had been able to focus entirely on attacking.</p><br/><p>This kind of feeling was probably something that they would only be able to experience once.</p><br/><p>After Master Lin and Wu You Lan left, Wang Fei sighed. \u201cIf only Master Lin would really join our team.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Ze hadn\u2019t really thought through this before because he had been too excited. Later on, he had thought about it more and understood. Then, he patted Wang Fei on the back.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, don\u2019t think about it. Actually, it\u2019s a good thing for our industry that Master Lin won\u2019t join us. You all saw what happened just now. With Master Lin\u2019s ability, I\u2019m afraid even the best player in the world wouldn\u2019t be able to score a single goal.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Fei nodded. \u201cMmm. That\u2019s no exaggeration. Against his ability, even the world\u2019s best would be powerless. I\u2019m afraid no one in the world would be able to score a goal if Master Lin is the goalkeeper.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, the reporters flocked over.</p><br/><p>Right now, the reporters wanted to interview Master Lin.</p><br/><p>\u201cCoach Wu, where\u2019s Master Lin?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Ze replied, \u201cHe has left already. Master Lin has left a long time ago.\u201d</p><br/><p>One of the reporters said helplessly, \u201cDang it. We\u2019re too late. I really wanted to interview Master Lin. I didn\u2019t think he would leave so soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCoach Wu, what do you think about Master Lin playing as the goalkeeper just now? What do you think of Master Lin\u2019s abilities?\u201d asked the reporters.</p><br/><p>Wu Ze answered with no hesitation, \u201cHe\u2019s strong. He\u2019s very strong.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow does he compare to a top world-class goalkeeper?\u201d asked one of the reporters.</p><br/><p>If they had been talking about someone else, Wu Ze might have said that he didn\u2019t know or that they couldn\u2019t be compared. But now, he only wanted to answer truthfully.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin is at the world\u2019s top. He\u2019s the number one in the world. According to my knowledge of the current goalkeepers, not a single one can match up to Master Lin,\u201d said Wu Ze.</p><br/><p>Then, the surrounding players all gave their coach strange looks with their eyes as if to say \u2018Be low-key. You have to be low-key!\u2019</p><br/><p>Wu Ze naturally knew what was going on but he still answered truthfully because Master Lin\u2019s abilities were really too great.</p><br/><p>Judging by what they had seen today, perhaps even calling him the God of Goalkeeping wouldn\u2019t be an exaggeration.</p><br/><p>The reporters recorded this whole scene. But in their hearts, they also acknowledged that Coach Wu had not been talking big, nor had he been exaggerating.</p><br/><p>They were all sports reporters and they had seen many competitions before.</p><br/><p>However, this was the first time in their lives that they had seen a scene like the one today.</p><br/><p>Even in the next few decades, it would be unlikely that they would be able to forget this day.</p></div>\n</div>"}

The first chapter was the preface but Lin Fan added slightly more, an overview of the origin of Chinese medicine and its developments in the past thousands of years. Anyone who studied Chinese medicine needed to know its history. If one didn\u2019t know the history, how would that person learn Chinese medicine?</p><br/><p>Hence, before the first chapter, Lin Fan added in the history of Chinese medicine.</p><br/><p>He buried his head in it and wrote furiously, occasionally stopping not because he didn\u2019t know what to write next but because he felt that his writing was too good, so he needed to stop for a moment and admire his own masterpiece.</p><br/><p>The first segment, second segment\u2026Second chapter, first segment: The Theory of Yin and Yang.</p><br/><p>The Encyclopedia only included a word description and didn\u2019t have any images. If he added an image, it could add some vividness to the book.</p><br/><p>The Earth consists of Yin, Yang, and the five elements and the human body was the same. Hence, using the human body to explain the five elements was not a bad choice.</p><br/><p>*writing sounds*</p><br/><p>The sound of pen against paper emanated inside the shop.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian and the rest were a little startled, wondering what Lin Fan was doing.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan seemed to be very different that day and Wu You Lan was a little worried. \u201cBrother Lin, what are you doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan didn\u2019t even look up. He smiled and replied, \u201cMing Qing asked me to write new basic teaching materials for the students.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEr!\u201d</p><br/><p>At that point, everyone in the shop knew that Lin Fan\u2019s medical abilities were extraordinary, so they didn\u2019t doubt him. However, they had never thought that he would be writing teaching materials. That was rather shocking.</p><br/><p>Chinese medicine was a large field of knowledge. Those who were able to write teaching materials were basically all expert professors aged seventy or even eighty-plus. As of now, Lin Fan was only twenty-something. For him to be writing Chinese medicine teaching materials, it really was shocking.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Shanghai\u2019s First Chinese Medical Academy.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing was also working on this matter. He had already given the word that the First Chinese Medical Academy\u2019s foundational teaching materials will all be replaced with new teaching materials in future.</p><br/><p>This news spread like a tornado within the academy. Everyone was in disbelief.</p><br/><p>The current teaching materials were written by several old Chinese doctors decades ago and had been used until now. Now that he said they would be replaced, the students felt that it was inconceivable. After all, there were basically no teaching materials on the market right now that could compare to those they were using.</p><br/><p>Some of the meddlesome students started to protest.</p><br/><p>Of course, they didn\u2019t protest openly but they posted complaints on the Internet, expressing their unhappiness.</p><br/><p>A student from a certain dormitory was furious and he immediately wrote a post and posted it on the Internet.</p><br/><p>\u201cEver since Shanghai\u2019s First Chinese Medical Academy\u2019s Director Zhao Ming Qing discovered the medicine for anorexia, he has started to go crazy. Now, he wants to completely replace the teaching materials that we have been using for decades\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The post was very long. The first part was normal. It just expressed his discontentment and puzzlement at the decision. But the later part consisted of his personal thoughts about the downfall of Chinese medicine and blamed it all on these old Chinese doctors.</p><br/><p>They were unprofessional, constantly changing and thus, causing unceasing unrest in Chinese medicine, causing it to be unable to steadily develop like Western medicine.</p><br/><p>This matter didn\u2019t attract much attention in the beginning. But after some people added fuel to the fire, this post was brought to Weibo and even became trending.</p><br/><p>The next day!</p><br/><p>When Zhao Ming Qing saw the post on the Internet, his heart shifted. He was a little angry. After reading the post, he could only say that this was abandoning oneself and not forging ahead for Chinese medicine.</p><br/><p>Reporters gathered around the entrance of Shanghai\u2019s First Chinese Medical Academy.</p><br/><p>When Zhao Ming Qing appeared, the reporters surrounded him.</p><br/><p>The reporters didn\u2019t understand this kind of situation but they just felt that it was a big piece of news. When there are people protesting, that means there is definitely an issue. Hence, they wanted to find out more.</p><br/><p>\u201cDirector Zhao, do you have any comments regarding that post on the Internet?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs the Chinese Medical Academy going to abolish the current teaching materials and introduce new ones? According to our knowledge, the Chinese medicine teaching materials that still remain now are not many and the ones that are used now are the best there are.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe various Chinese Medical Academies around the country have all expressed unhappiness towards your decision to abolish the old teaching materials. They feel that it is against the regulations.\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporters kept asking questions, one after another.</p><br/><p>The surrounding students spectated the scene. They knew that this was an eventful period for the academy and they also knew about the replacement of the old teaching materials.</p><br/><p>To outsiders, this may not have been a significant thing but to them, this was incomparably significant.</p><br/><p>Nowadays, the Chinese Medical Universities\u2019 teaching materials were all chosen by the Education Department and they weren\u2019t allowed to be changed without instructions being given.</p><br/><p>Otherwise, it would be difficult to manage. If all the schools were in disarray in terms of teaching material, that would not be a good thing.</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone, please quieten down,\u201d said Zhao Ming Qing calmly, \u201cI understand that this matter will have repercussions but even so, this must be done because the reason why Chinese Medicine is declining right now has nothing to do with what illnesses it can treat. It is due to do with a lack of resources and manpower. The old edition of teaching materials are very good but times have changed and Chinese medicine must change as well. It has to stay with the times. That\u2019s why I\u2019m going to replace the foundational teaching materials.</p><br/><p>A reporter said, \u201cDirector Zhao, Chinese medicine is a crystallization of knowledge. It doesn\u2019t decline like scientific and technological products but it should get better with time. Don\u2019t you think this move is a mistake, Director Zhao?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDirector Zhao, which books are you selecting as your new teaching materials?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDirector Zhao\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporters were questioning him excitedly. They made Zhao Ming Qing at a loss for words for a moment.</p><br/><p>Then, Zhao Ming Qing waved his hand. \u201cThis interview shall end here. But I will declare that as the Chinese Medical Academy\u2019s Director, I put my students first. That\u2019s why I feel that changing the teaching materials is necessary. As for which books I have chosen, I can say this: They\u2019re much better than any other books that have been used as teaching materials in history.</p><br/><p>Uproar!</p><br/><p>The reporters were stunned. They didn\u2019t expect Director Zhao to answer with so much swagger and so much self-confidence.</p><br/><p>Better than any other teaching material in history. Those were some really big words.</p><br/><p>In the office.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing made a call. \u201cTeacher, there\u2019s an issue with the reforming of teaching materials.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cWhat do you think of it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing said, \u201cI trust Teacher. That\u2019s why we must replace the current teaching materials.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen it\u2019ll be fine. What\u2019s the point of thinking so much? I\u2019m very busy right now. Your teacher has been writing so much every day that my hand is sore. Teaching materials are teaching materials after all. The rigorousness of the content is exceptional. My brain is about to explode,\u201d whined Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing was a little embarrassed. \u201cThank you for your trouble, Teacher.\u201d</p><br/><p>The next day!</p><br/><p>The Education Department held a large conference.</p><br/><p>Shanghai\u2019s First Chinese Medical Academy was under their management. The whole nation\u2019s Chinese medical academies had the same teaching materials. It was all regulated. Now that Shanghai\u2019s First Chinese Medical Academy wanted to change its teaching materials, that was against the regulations and they had to stop it.</p><br/><p>These teaching materials were crystals of knowledge left behind by predecessors. They were written by famous Chinese medical masters decades ago.</p><br/><p>Why would they want to change them?</p><br/><p>This Zhao Ming Qing was really ridiculous.</p></div>\n</div>"}

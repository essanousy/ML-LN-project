Then, he left.</p><br/><p>But when he reached the ground floor, he saw a gorgeous figure waiting for him. He was surprised. \u201cWhy are you up so early?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue had dressed up meticulously. Then, she replied sweetly, \u201cI\u2019m sending you off.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. \u201cAlright then. I didn\u2019t think you would come so early to send me off. It seems I haven\u2019t been nice to you for nothing. Alright. You\u2019re tired from all the filming. Go up earlier to rest.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d Wu Huan Yue nodded.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-2\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>The two of them chatted for a while more before Lin Fan went to get his car. He waved to Wu Huan Yue. \u201cGo back and rest. I\u2019m leaving.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue waved back. She couldn\u2019t bear to see him leave. When the car finally disappeared from her sigh, she sighed and returned to her room.</p><br/><p>Her heart was filled with reluctance. When they parted, she had wanted to rush forward and go back with him to Shanghai.</p><br/><p>In the past, she hadn\u2019t felt it but this time that Lin Fan came, she realized that Brother Lin held such an important place in her heart.</p><br/><p><em>Do my best. I have to do my best. </em>Wu Huan Yue cheered herself on in her heart. She decided that she would never give up.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>In two hours, the car had reached Shanghai.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-3\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Fraud Tian was at the entrance of the shop, looking at the queuing townsfolk. He had wanted to tell them that Master Lin was out to do something, so they wouldn\u2019t be able to buy scallion pancakes that day. But unexpectedly, that kid suddenly returned. He was very surprised. Had the sun risen from the West? How could Lin Fan be back so soon?</p><br/><p>Lin Fan realized that Fraud Tian was looking at him strangely. Then, he asked, \u201cWhat are you looking at?\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian replied, \u201cNo, I just realized that this doesn\u2019t seem right. It\u2019s different from last time. You actually came back so early.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. \u201cWhat? I\u2019m such a professional person, what\u2019s wrong with me hurrying back? I remember that all these townsfolk are waiting for my scallion pancakes. I definitely won\u2019t let them return disappointed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian rolled his eyes. <em>I\u2019d only believe you if I was possessed.</em></p><br/><p>Lin Fan finished selling the scallion pancakes and he laid down to rest.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan was curious. She wondered what had happened the previous night. But since Brother Lin didn\u2019t say anything, it wasn\u2019t right for her to ask.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian giggled slyly. \u201cKid, how was it yesterday? Did something happen at night?\u201d</p><br/><p>When Wu You Lan heard this, she couldn\u2019t help but glare at Fraud Tian.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan scolded him jokingly, \u201cNothing happened at all. Don\u2019t joke about other people\u2019s innocence, otherwise, I\u2019ll have to do some sparring with you.\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-4\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t, don\u2019t. You\u2019re much stronger than me now, kid. If I spar with you, I\u2019d be asking for death.\u201d Fraud Tian didn\u2019t dare to act presumptuously with Lin Fan. To him, this kid wasn\u2019t human. He didn\u2019t know how Lin Fan had trained to make his strength so fearsome.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan covered her mouth as she laughed. She believed what Brother Lin had said.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed. \u201cAlright then. My iron fists haven\u2019t been put to use in a while.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAwesome, Boss.\u201d Fraud Tian trembled as he didn\u2019t dare to act impudently.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was feeling bored, so he gave Zhao Ming Qing a call.</p><br/><p>\u201cMing Qing, what have you been doing lately?\u201d asked Lin Fan through the phone.</p><br/><p>\u201cCough cough cough\u2026Teacher, I\u2019m recuperating at home.\u201d Zhao Ming Qing sounded weak.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was startled. \u201cWhat happened to you, Ming Qing? Weren\u2019t you fine just a few days ago?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust a minor flu. I\u2019ll be fine if I just rest a while,\u201d said Zhao Ming Qing.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan furrowed his brows as he rubbed his fingers together and read the future. His expression was a little unpleasant. \u201cWait for me, I\u2019ll come and take a look at you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d asked Fraud Tian curiously.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cThere\u2019s something up. I have to go out for a bit.\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-5\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Soon, at Zhao Ming Qing\u2019s home.</p><br/><p>Zhao Shi opened the door for Lin Fan. Upon entering, Lin Fan asked impatiently. \u201cHow\u2019s Ming Qing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, he seems to be having a slight flu. His body is a little weak.\u201d Zhao Shi was worried but she wasn\u2019t too worried. She felt that it was just a small illness.</p><br/><p>But to Lin Fan, something wasn\u2019t right.</p><br/><p>In the room.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing saw that his teacher had come and he wanted to get up from his bed but Lin Fan stopped him. \u201cDon\u2019t move. Let me take a look.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, it\u2019s just a small illness. My body is becoming weak, so I fall sick easily.\u201d Zhao Ming Qing coughed a few times. It sounded like his throat was congested with phlegm.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan didn\u2019t say anything as he just quietly observed. He felt that something wasn\u2019t right.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing was already old and his lifeforce was depleting rapidly. It could be said that his body\u2019s functions were stopping. In other words, he was dying of old age.</p><br/><p>Although he was only seventy-something-years-old, the problem was that Zhao Ming Qing had studied Chinese medicine his whole life. At times where he had tried taking some Chinese medicine, toxins had been accumulated in his body as well. Although it didn\u2019t cause much trouble to him usually, his bodily functions were deteriorating.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-6\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Even if your medical skills are great, when someone\u2019s lifespan is up, you won\u2019t be able to save him.</p><br/><p>Hence, this was not an illness.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Zhao Ming Qing saw his teacher\u2019s expression and a rough idea of the situation formed in his mind. Then, he waved to his wife. \u201cGo out first. I want to speak to my teacher.\u201d</p><br/><p>His voice was weak.</p><br/><p>Zhao Shi nodded, then left. She knew that this old man respected Master Lin greatly. He had always treated him as his teacher.</p><br/><p>The door was closed.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing spoke, \u201cTeacher, am I going to be done soon?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking about? There\u2019s no such thing,\u201d replied Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing shook his head. \u201cTeacher, I can see it from your expression. I already have an idea of what\u2019s going on in my body. I\u2019m old and my bodily functions are deteriorating rapidly. Sometimes, when I take my own pulse, I can feel that it\u2019s slow.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. With your teacher around, what could happen?\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-7\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing chuckled. \u201cRight, right. With Teacher around, I can relax. But my greatest regret is not having known Teacher earlier. We\u2019ve had too little time together.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed. \u201cIf you met me earlier, I would still be a little kid.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha,\u201d Zhao Ming Qing laughed but his expression was very weak. \u201cTeacher, don\u2019t tell them yet. I\u2019ll leave it up to fate but I just want to keep going for a while more.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t speak yet. I\u2019ll fix your little flu,\u201d said Lin Fan. Then, he took out a box of silver needles from Zhao Ming Qing\u2019s Chinese medical supplies drawer and personally treated him.</p><br/><p>His bodily functions were failing and his strength kept falling. It all came rapidly and his body was deteriorating drastically day by day.</p><br/><p>This was the usual situation that came with old age. Perhaps one would be full of energy and have a great appetite one day but the next day, he or she could suddenly be motionless on the bed.</p><br/><p>This kind of situation was too common.</p><br/><p>To Lin Fan, this was really f*cked up. How could it happen so quick? He hadn\u2019t even been prepared.</p><br/><p>He inserted the needles, using the Encyclopedia\u2019s mystical boost.</p><br/><p>He killed all the toxins in Zhao Ming Qing\u2019s body. Meanwhile, Zhao Ming Qing was astonished as he realized that his body was gradually recovering. It was way too mystical.</p><br/><p>He knew that his teacher\u2019s medical skills were great but the rate of effectiveness was terrifying.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-8\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div></div>\n</div>"}

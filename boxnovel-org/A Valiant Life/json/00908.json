He could finally return to the school that he was so familiar with.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-1\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>However, he suddenly thought of something. His mentor had spoken in a weird tone yesterday when he called him. Could it be that his mentor didn\u2019t want him to go back?</p><br/><p>He felt a little anxious and decided to call his mentor. If his mentor really didn\u2019t agree to it, he would still listen to him.</p><br/><p>Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan wasn\u2019t thinking about this incident anymore; it was finally resolved. The best outcome was to let the opposing party realize their mistakes.</p><br/><p>*Ding ding!*</p><br/><p>He picked up the phone.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-2\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cMing Qing, what is it?\u201d Lin Fan asked.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing spoke cautiously, \u201cTeacher, I\u2019m really returning to the academy?\u201d</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t seem very confident. It seemed like he was asking a question.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan just smiled. Obviously, he knew what Zhao Ming Qing was thinking about. However, he was just going to let things be. Furthermore, he was very open about this matter. He didn\u2019t want to force his opinion on anyone.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat else are you going to do besides go back? Since they asked for it and you want to go back, just do it. I can\u2019t say anything about it, can I?\u201d Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing heaved a sigh of relief. \u201cTeacher, I was just afraid that you were angry about it. Don\u2019t worry. If something like this happens in the future, I will definitely not go back.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, alright. There won\u2019t be a next time.\u201d Lin Fan laughed. Then, he thought of something. \u201cOh, right. I will be passing your number to a friend of mine. If he contacts you, help him to look at a patient. Just do it casually. It\u2019s okay if you can\u2019t treat his illness.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing nodded. \u201cOkay, teacher.\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-3\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>The two of them chatted for a while longer and hung up.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shook his head. Now that this incident had been resolved, he could focus on the welfare institute and also on angling. The angling knowledge was pretty powerful. The things that he could obtain were really magical. It was the most shocking knowledge classification besides the major wuxia knowledge classification.</p><br/><p>As he was thinking about that, Zheng Zhong Shan\u2019s phone call came.</p><br/><p>When he saw the call, he didn\u2019t want to pick it up but he still did it anyway.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Lin, how\u2019s the situation? Are you satisfied with it? When are you coming to Beijing? Let\u2019s have a gathering,\u201d Zheng Zhong Shan said. He had read the news and, although it wasn\u2019t much of a big deal, it was considered to be some form of repentance. With regards to getting the director of the department to admit his mistake, it would reflect really badly on the department.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t really have anything to do in Beijing. I will get my disciple to contact you. You can speak to him about it,\u201d Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>Zheng Zhong Shan was stunned. \u201cElder Lin, why aren\u2019t you coming over? This illness can only be treated by you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cDon\u2019t underestimate my disciple. If I\u2019m the best in the world, he\u2019s the second.\u201d</p><br/><p>He felt that Elder Lin\u2019s confident personality hadn\u2019t changed. However, Lin Fan was clearly the best in the world. It was just that he wasn\u2019t confident in Lin Fan\u2019s disciple.</p><br/><p>However, he could feel that Elder Lin was still a little angry.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-4\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll accept that your student is the second best in the world. I won\u2019t comment on it. If you were to reject my request, I wouldn\u2019t say anything about it,\u201d Zheng Zhong Shan said.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. \u201cAlright, I know what you mean. Since Elder Zheng requested it personally, I will definitely give you some face but I am really very busy with the welfare institute matters.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zheng Zhong Shan knew that Elder Lin was indeed pretty busy with the welfare institute. He wanted to extend his help to Lin Fan. \u201cWhy not let me do it? I can find graduates from top schools for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. It\u2019s a small place and I can\u2019t afford their wages. I will do it myself. Alright, I\u2019ll hang up now. I will send his number to you later.\u201d He knew how powerful Elder Zheng was but he didn\u2019t need it. All the kids had consumed the Little Intelligence Pill and they were really intelligent. Their learning speed was rapid and they could even learn things on their own.</p><br/><p>However, what he really wanted was to unlock a knowledge classification to pass down to them.</p><br/><p>Of course, some of the knowledge classifications couldn\u2019t be taught. However, he wanted to teach them those that could be. Since he was the new director of the welfare organization, he couldn\u2019t let the kids lead ordinary lives anymore.</p><br/><p>Since they did not have their families, he wanted them to grow to become precious treasures in the eyes of others.</p><br/><p>After hanging up, he immediately sent Zhao Ming Qing\u2019s number to Zheng Zhong Shan.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be heading to the welfare institute,\u201d Lin Fan stood up and told Fraud Tian and the others. Then, he drove off.</p><br/><p>At the welfare institute.</p><br/><p>The teaching block\u2019s roof had just been capped. Moreover, they had been building it level by level, renovating each level while building up the block. They had used the best materials and minimized any form of inferior materials.</p><br/><p>When he reached the welfare institute, the kids were drawing.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-5\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>The kids had been learning how to draw for quite a long time and they had made a tremendous improvement. The most talented one could complete an exceptional piece of Chinese artwork independently.</p><br/><p>Their hard work was equivalent to several years of hard work put in by others.</p><br/><p>Director Huang was really satisfied with the progress of the welfare institute. Ever since Master Lin had taken over it, everything had become better.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, we have some contacts for the employment of teachers.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cAlright, can you please contact them? However, I want them to have integrity and good morals. Their wages can be discussed. As long as they are patient and capable, we will give them their desired wages.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan wasn\u2019t fearful of paying them good money. After all, the dead can\u2019t bring any money with them when they\u2019re gone from the world.</p><br/><p>\u201cUncle Lin, you haven\u2019t been here in so long,\u201d Lil\u2019 Fatty said upon seeing Lin Fan. He was in the midst of drawing something. He ran over and stared at Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan felt a little embarrassed. He had had a lot of matters to attend to and he hadn\u2019t paid much attention to the welfare institute. It looked like he only had himself to blame.</p><br/><p>He touched Lil\u2019 Fatty\u2019s head and said, \u201cUncle Lin had things to do. I won\u2019t go anymore. Let\u2019s go. Let\u2019s see how\u2019s your drawing progress.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lil\u2019 Fatty was really happy when Lin Fan mentioned the artwork. Then, he held Lin Fan\u2019s hand. \u201cUncle Lin, look! My artwork is really good. Auntie Huang said my artistic talent is the best.\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-6\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Lin Fan stood in front of the artwork and was proud of what he had drawn. It was indeed an excellent piece of artwork. He had such a great talent at such a young age. It could be said that he had already exceeded the ability of a lot of people. Even those that had learned how to draw for a few years might not even be able to catch up to him.</p><br/><p>If he was properly developed, he could potentially become a world-class artist in the future.</p><br/><p>Han Lu was really shocked by the intelligent minds of these kids. He was really happy and he felt that the Heavens had given them intelligent minds in place of their families.</p><br/><p>He served as the \u2018bodyguard\u2019 of the kids and he also taught them how to keep themselves fit.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan felt that the development of the welfare institute was pretty good.</p></div>\n</div>"}

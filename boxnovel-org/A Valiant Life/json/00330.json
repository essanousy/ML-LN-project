What Lin Fan said did have a point. But they didn't care about it. Conflicts were good since they would make the show more interesting.</p><br/><p>A lot of reality shows nowadays also used this method for the sake of competition in order to get more viewers.</p><br/><p>But the situation now between Lin Fan and Li Mu Ze was unnaturally tense and it was completely not scripted.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Lin Fan looked at Li Mu Ze and Li Mu Ze stared back at him before letting out an unnerving laugh. \"Haha, I know the actual reason why you won't read my fortune.\"</p><br/><p>Li Mu Ze was searching desperately for a way out of this embarrassing situation.</p><br/><p>Huang Yue looked at him, tilting her head in curiosity. \"Brother Ze, what do you mean?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan also wanted to know what Li Mu Ze wanted to say. After Zhao Zhong Yang had told him that Li Mu Ze was part of the backstabbing club, he had done his own research to see what happened to the guys he had backstabbed in order to get girls and the results that he found weren't pretty at all.</p><br/><p>Li Mu Ze laughed. \"It's because I'm too handsome, and it's probably too much for Master Lin to read.\"</p><br/><p>\"Haha...\"</p><br/><p>Almost immediately, all the other celebrities also laughed out loud.</p><br/><p>\"Brother Ze, are you so sure? \" Huang Yue asked.</p><br/><p>\"Well, he isn't too far from the truth. Out of all of us here, he's the most attractive,\" Yang Tao said.</p><br/><p>Li Mu Ze laughed before turning to look at Lin Fan. \"Master Lin, we can explain whatever you just said with this explanation. How about you hand over the precious clue to me? As the most attractive person over here, I should be the one getting it.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan wanted to say that he was just embarrassing himself, but they were filming and he didn't want to give Director Hu any trouble. A little drama wouldn't hurt, would it?</p><br/><p>Lin Fan pointed at Yang Tao as he spoke to Li Mu Ze, \"He is probably the most attractive one here but he's still humble, unlike you, who is narcissistic. If I had to give the clue to any male here, it'd be Yang Tao.\"</p><br/><p>Li Mu Ze's face turned black as he awkwardly laughed it off. \"Master Lin, I don't agree with you on that.\"</p><br/><p>Yang Tao stood at the side, laughing to himself and quietly approving of what Master Lin said. It was rare for people to speak the truth nowadays. Yang Tao had to admit that he himself was the most handsome of all the people there. However, one should be humble when it came to interacting with people. Especially because his reputation could not compare to Li Mu Ze's, he decided to be more low-key in fear of upsetting Li Mu Ze.</p><br/><p>Yang Tao looked at Master Lin, saying humbly, \"Master Lin, I'm far from Brother Ze's standard.\"</p><br/><p> \"Don't be humble. Your fortune looks really good. You're still young. When you reach thirty years old, your life will take a turn for the better and your future looks really bright.\"</p><br/><p>Yang Tao looked at him, surprised. \"Master Lin, you shouldn't flatter me so much. I might end up becoming too proud for my own good.\"</p><br/><p>\"You're born in the sixth month in the year of the goat and your birthday is the same as that of the goddess Guan Ying. You are kind, gullible and emotional. That being said, when you reach thirty years old, wonderful things will happen to you. Just remember my words, and remember me when that day comes. Then, send me a gift.\"</p><br/><p>Yang Tao couldn't tell if Master Lin was telling the truth or if he was pulling his leg, but he felt good hearing those words. This was being recorded on the program and this one compliment made him feel like he was on cloud nine.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan found it ridiculous. Out of all the celebrities in the room, the only person who was not too bad was Yang Tao.</p><br/><p>If there were more people in the room, Lin Fan would have said more. But he felt that whatever he had said was enough. And comparing Yang Tao with the other people around, he felt that Yang Tao was someone who was more reasonable, so he used his fortune as an example for the rest and at the same time used it to suppress Li Mu Ze's cockiness.</p><br/><p>Although Li Mu Ze hadn't provoked him, he didn't like seeing the scene in front of him, so he decided to flame the other party.</p><br/><p>Yang Tao said with a tinge of gratitude in his voice, \"Master Lin, I am at loss for words for the fortune that you read for me. However, I really think that Brother Ze is way better than me.\"</p><br/><p>Li Mu Ze stood at the side, his face smiling awkwardly. At the same time, his heart was starting to burn up. F*ck...who did I offend to deserve this? This kid just seems to want to flame me. He thought to himself. If not for the fact that they were filming, he would have gone up to hit Master Lin.</p><br/><p>The filming crew notified Director Hu of what was going on.</p><br/><p>Director Hu stood there frozen for a second before laughing. This kind of situation was for the best. The more drama there was on screen, the better ratings would be. And the revenue from the show would definitely be higher.</p><br/><p>After hearing the report from the filming crew, Director Hu understood. Whatever Master Lin had said was brilliant. Director Hu wore a huge smile thinking of all the ratings that this show was going to get.</p><br/><p>... </p><br/><p>\"Master Lin, if you put it like this, you would be embarrassing Brother Ze, \" Huang Yue said with a refined smile.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved her away. \"Since when will he ever be embarrassed? His skin is so thick and dark, he should be able to take it.\"</p><br/><p>Roars of laughter!</p><br/><p>The audience that was present all began to laugh.</p><br/><p>Li Mu Ze's face turned to an even darker shade of black even though his skin was originally tanned. He breathed in heavily, maintaining his composure, before letting out an awkward smile. \"This joke isn't even funny at all.\"</p><br/><p> Lin Fan stared at Li Mu Ze blankly for a second, before responding, \"What I said isn't a joke, it is the truth.\"</p><br/><p>F*ck!</p><br/><p>All the celebrities at the scene gaped in surprise. This guy really doesn't care about giving other people any face at all. Brilliant, absolutely brilliant.</p><br/><p>Lu Dao Ren and Li Mu Ze were managed by the same entertainment company and they were rather good friends. Lu Dao Ren said, \"Master Lin, why don't you read my fortune as well?\" </p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at him, before waving him away. \"Didn't I already say just now? You're exactly the same as him. I won't read your fortune.\"</p><br/><p>F*ck your mum... </p><br/><p>Lu Dao Ren seethed in anger, but he had to maintain his composure. He absolutely had to maintain it. If he exploded right now, it would be caught on camera and he would end up as a laughing stock.</p><br/><p>\"Haha...\" he stood at the side, laughing it off, his eyes looking at Lin Fan in disdain.</p><br/><p>The other male celebrities maintained their smiles, not wanting to butt in. They were afraid that Master Lin would say something bad about them.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Lin Fan turned his gaze back to Tang Ying. \"You are much better to look at. You are gorgeous and cute and people can't help but like you.\"</p><br/><p>Huang Yue commented from the corner. \"Master Lin, what about me?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed. \"Not too bad as well.\"</p><br/><p>Huang Yue heaved a sigh of relief now that Master Lin didn't dislike her. However, she felt helpless for Li Mu Ze and Lu Dao Ren since Master Lin seemed to hate them but for some reason, she felt excited and joyful.</p><br/><p>All the filming crew who were standing at the side were wiping their sweat. They felt that the atmosphere was too tense. Everyone felt that Master Lin was just roasting Li Mu Ze and Lu Dao Ren, and if one analyzed it more closely, they would have realized that Master Lin was concealing his murderous intents in his words.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

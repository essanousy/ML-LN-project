Don\u2019t eat spicy food and always keep yourself warm.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, I got it, godly doctor.\u201d Initially, the patient was extremely lifeless but now, a significant change had happened. Although he couldn\u2019t be said to be very lively, he was much better than he used to be. Unless you were a blind man, you\u2019d have noticed it.</p><br/><p>\u201cGodly doctor, you\u2019re a godly doctor indeed!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe just saw his condition earlier. He looked extremely awful. Now, he looks totally different!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI wish I had met this godly doctor earlier. Then, we wouldn\u2019t have had to suffer so much.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, it isn\u2019t too late now. At least we have hope for our illnesses.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Lin Fan hadn\u2019t seen a cancer patient yet. However, if he were to meet one, what would he do?</p><br/><p>If he really cured it, people would go crazy.</p><br/><p>However, they were on a voluntary medical work mission. As long as there was an illness to cure, they\u2019d definitely cure it. They were going to cure all the illnesses. He didn\u2019t want to care about the comments after that.</p><br/><p><em>slam</em></p><br/><p>The leader of the city enforcement team came and slammed the table angrily. \u201cWho allowed you guys to set up a booth here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan raised his head and gestured towards Zhao Ming Qing. \u201cPass me four needles.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing was confused but he still passed the needles to him.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan casually moved his hand and pierced the needles into an acupoint of each of the four city enforcement officers. Suddenly, they all froze and didn\u2019t move.</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry, I have to trouble a few of you to move these city enforcement officers away,\u201d Lin Fan said calmly.</p><br/><p>The family members were a little afraid of the city enforcement officers. However, they realized that they weren\u2019t moving. Then, they went forward and moved them aside.</p><br/><p>\u201cGodly doctor, that was awesome!\u201d The family members exclaimed.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled and didn\u2019t say anything.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing was stunned. \u201cTeacher, what did you just do?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI used the acupuncture needles to pierce an acupoint. Do you want to learn that?\u201d Lin Fan smiled.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing nodded. That was awesome. He knew that there were acupoints that allowed people to be numbed for a little while. However, it was unbelievable to freeze someone totally. That could only be found in the fables.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s useless even if you want to learn it. You can\u2019t do it with your current ability. You have to learn as much as you can now and perhaps you might master it in the future,\u201d Lin Fan chuckled.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing felt a little sad. He didn\u2019t expect to not be able to learn this. However, his mentor said that he might be able to master it if he continued learning. It was like a glimmer of hope to him.</p><br/><p>Qiu Jie and Zhang Tong Tong were stunned when they saw this. They didn\u2019t expect Teacher Lin to be so powerful. They wanted to ask if they could learn it too but even Director Zhao couldn\u2019t and that meant that they didn\u2019t have any hope.</p><br/><p>At that moment, the four city enforcement officers were frightened.</p><br/><p>They realized that they couldn\u2019t move at all even if they wanted to. That was horrifying.</p><br/><p>Then, they thought of those wuxia novels which involved the hitting of acupoints. Could it be that their acupoints were hit?</p><br/><p>D*mn it.</p><br/><p>When they recovered, they had to teach this fella a lesson.</p><br/><p>Although the four of them couldn\u2019t move, their faces looked extremely angry.</p><br/><p>At the hospital.</p><br/><p>\u201cDirector, the city enforcement officers are here but they\u2019re just standing there. They didn\u2019t chase them away,\u201d a doctor that had been observing the situation reported.</p><br/><p>The Director wasn\u2019t in a good mood. This matter had infuriated him. When he heard what the doctor said, he was stunned. \u201cWhat? The city enforcement officers didn\u2019t chase them away and are just standing there now? What are they doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. They\u2019re just standing there. It looks as if they\u2019re just looking.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Director was furious. What was the city enforcement team doing?</p><br/><p>The nurse hurried over, \u201cDirector, something bad happened. All the hospitalized patients who can move have gone to the entrance of the hospital. Those patients that returned from the booth publicised it to everyone. Therefore, they quickly went there after hearing about it. As of now, there are already twenty patients who have processed their discharge.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow could that be?\u201d The Director was stunned. What was happening? If this were to continue, what use would the hospital be?</p><br/><p>They couldn\u2019t let it continue like this. If the media were to know, they\u2019d laugh their a*ses off.</p><br/><p>The patients of Jiangning Citizens\u2019 Hospital are all cured by a voluntary medical work team. The uproar that this news would cause was unimaginable.</p><br/><p>However, the situation seemed abnormal. The city enforcement officers didn\u2019t do anything even though they were there. What could they do?</p><br/><p>They had to think of something.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The four city enforcement officers stood at the side and they couldn\u2019t feel anything. If one were to stand still for so long, their legs would definitely be numb. They\u2019d been standing there for a rather long time already.</p><br/><p>Their angry faces were gone. They just looked dumbfounded</p><br/><p>Because they couldn\u2019t move at all, they could only stand there and watch. They realized that those patients who looked awful started to look better after treatment. It was an unbelievable improvement.</p><br/><p>Shocking!</p><br/><p>There were more and more townsfolk that gathered around.</p><br/><p>They weren\u2019t blind and they knew that it was a different situation now. Initially, they thought that they were scammers. However, these people treated the patients completely and there were drastic improvements. Anyone could\u2019ve seen the differences.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat time is it now?\u201d Lin Fan asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, it\u2019s already 5 pm,\u201d Zhao Ming Qing said.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at those patients and stopped. \u201cIt\u2019s so late now. I guess we should go soon. Lil\u2019 Jie, which hospital are we going to tomorrow?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qiu Jie said, \u201cMaster Lin, we are going to Jiangning Hospital tomorrow.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright,\u201d Lin Fan nodded. Then, he said, \u201cEveryone, the clinic is closed. Come to Jiangning Hospital tomorrow at 7 am. Alright, we\u2019re tired from treating illnesses for the whole day. Let\u2019s go now.\u201d</p><br/><p>The patients couldn\u2019t bear for them to go but since the godly doctor had spoken, they couldn\u2019t do anything about it.</p><br/><p>\u201cGodly doctor, we\u2019ll be waiting for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have to come.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan packed up and smiled, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll definitely be there tomorrow.\u201d</p><br/><p>He was really satisfied with everything. He even forgot how many patients he had seen.</p><br/><p>Sometimes, he would be really satisfied with the sense of achievement that he felt after treating patients.</p><br/><p>Then, he looked at the four city enforcement officers and took out the acupuncture needles from their bodies. He turned around and left with Zhao Ming Qing and the others.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait\u2026\u201d then, a city enforcement officer spoke. He looked a little hesitant.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it? You want to arrest me?\u201d</p><br/><p>The city enforcement officer shook his head and said, \u201cNo, I just wanted to ask something. My mum can\u2019t move both her legs and is bedridden. Can you cure her?\u201d</p><br/><p>His eyes were filled with anticipation but he was also fearful. He was afraid that the godly doctor would say it was hopeless or he was still bearing a grudge about what had happened earlier.</p><br/><p>\u201cShould be fine. Come to the entrance of Jiangning Hospital tomorrow. I\u2019m tired today. Sorry about making all of you stand still for the entire afternoon too,\u201d Lin Fan said. Then, he waved his hand and didn\u2019t look back. He yawned and massaged his own neck a little before leaving.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

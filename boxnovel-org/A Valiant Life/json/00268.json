After he leaves, where would they go to eat scallion pancakes? Moreover, they were all used to queuing up every day. If they suddenly didn't have to queue anymore, it would feel like they lost something important to them.</p><br/><p>\"Little Boss\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Some of the townsfolk felt like crying but there were no tears. They started to say something but then stopped halfway. They didn't know what to say. Even if they urged him to stay, it was too late, it would all be in vain.</p><br/><p>At that moment, the townsfolk turned their gaze to Liu Guo Qiang and his people. These people were too much. If they didn't have such black hearts, things would never have turned out this way.</p><br/><p>They increased the rent as they liked. Even if no one disputed, they shouldn't have increased it so ridiculously. It was simply absurd.</p><br/><p>Zhu Xiu Qin stood by the side. The matter had finally ended. The Cloud Street business owners were all going to leave.</p><br/><p>She still couldn't understand what exactly Liu Guo Qiang was trying to do. Could it be that he really believed that the increase in visitor flow had to do with this kid?</p><br/><p>If he used his brain a little, he would know that it wasn't possible.</p><br/><p>It was clear to anyone with eyes how great the visitor flow in Cloud Street was. Even if all these business owners moved away, it wouldn't have the slightest impact. Of course, these were all just her thoughts.</p><br/><p>And she naturally didn't understand why Liu Guo Qiang would believe that the visitor flow in Cloud Street had been brought about by Master Lin.</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang had been broadcasting the whole time. \"Everyone, we're going to move to the Tiang Hong Commercial Street in the Hong Tian District. My fellow friends who stay there, you'll be in luck from now on.\"</p><br/><p>\"6666\u2026 I stay just at Hong Tian District. I'll have the opportunity to see Brother Yang from now on.\"</p><br/><p>\"As a resident of Hong Tian District, I have no resentment towards this Xin Yu company at all. In fact, I'm a little grateful. If it wasn't for them, Master Lin wouldn't be coming to Hong Tian District.\"</p><br/><p>\"How I wish Tian Hong Commercial Street would chase Master Lin away as well. If that happens, I'd be able to send a request to Master Lin to invite him over to Anhui.\"</p><br/><p>\"D*mn, why couldn't it be Dongshan?\"</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang was angry over this matter too but he knew that it hadn't initially had much to do with Master Lin. But Master Lin was not someone to just disregard something if it didn't concern himself. Naturally, he would stand with the other shop owners. After this period of being together, everyone had such good relations with each other.</p><br/><p>And Zhao Zhong Yang could tell that Master Lin, at times, believed in the person rather than the circumstance. If you were to get along well with him, even if you were facing a dark road ahead, he would follow you through it.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian was smoking a cigarette as he said, \"You'll regret this.\"</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian had kept silent about this matter, not because he didn't want to say anything but because the situation had been completely taken over by Lin Fan, leaving him with nothing to say. Now that he finally had the chance, he had to put in a few words to express his displeasure.</p><br/><p>He had been the first to follow Lin Fan. He had a fair understanding of this kid's capabilities. He could say with full confidence that no matter where this kid went, he would cause waves.</p><br/><p>The surrounding business owners were all signing the contract to withdraw their rentals and move elsewhere.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan stood there putting his hands together as a sign of respect towards all the surrounding townsfolk. \"My apologies, everybody. Thank you for your care during this period. If you have the opportunity in future, do come to Tian Hong Commercial Street for a visit.\"</p><br/><p>His loyal customers couldn't bear to see him leave.</p><br/><p>\"Little Boss...sigh...forget it. We don't know what to to do either regarding this situation. Don't worry, if we have time in future, we will visit you. But don't you make us queue!\"</p><br/><p>\"Yeah! If we were to make the long trip all the way there and still have to queue, that would be screwed up.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. \"So all you're going to miss are my scallion pancakes. I thought you were going to miss me!\"</p><br/><p>One of the townsfolk replied, \"Little Boss, we will miss you. Those scallion pancakes are just a bonus. In future, if we have any issues, we still have to find you for fortune-telling.\"</p><br/><p>\"Right, right. There'll be many opportunities in future.\"</p><br/><p>As Liu Guo Qiang saw how well Master Lin got along with the surrounding townsfolk, he started to get more worried. Perhaps he had made a bad decision.</p><br/><p>At the same time, he also felt a deep regret. He should have taken a step back at that time. Then it wouldn't have come to this.</p><br/><p>But no matter what he said now, it was too late.</p><br/><p>This Zhu Xiu Qin really couldn't do anything right but she could do everything wrong. But Liu Guo Qiang had no choice. She had connections, so her word was law in the department.</p><br/><p>In the company, everyone had to give in to her.</p><br/><p>As for this matter, it had already reached a conclusion. It wouldn't help to talk anymore. They could only leave it at that.</p><br/><p>The shop owners were signing the contract but they didn't show a hint of sadness on their faces. Some of them were not even angry. Instead, they each felt a sense of rebirth.</p><br/><p>\"We're going to a new place. I'm a little nervous.\"</p><br/><p>\"Hehe, Little Boss will be with us. I can worry much less because of that.\"</p><br/><p>\"Me too. But we have to have a fair competition to decide who becomes Little Boss's neighbor.\"</p><br/><p>Elder Zhang said, \"Don't even think about it. I'm Little Boss's neighbor and that's for life. Don't even think about taking that from me.\"</p><br/><p>\"Elder Zhang, that's unreasonable of you. You were already Little Boss' neighbor here, can't you give us a chance when we go to the new place?\"</p><br/><p>\"I won't. You all don't understand the feeling of being neighbors with Little Boss.\"</p><br/><p>\"Don't be like that, we're all friends. I'll treat you to a meal.\"</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Lin Fan stood there smiling as well. He hadn't thought that everyone would be so cheery, to start a debate over who becomes neighbors with him.</p><br/><p>Was he really so handsome?</p><br/><p>So likable?</p><br/><p>At that point, he couldn't help but sigh. It was not easy being so popular.</p><br/><p>\"Make way\u2026\"</p><br/><p>At that moment, noises came from afar.</p><br/><p>\"Chief Li.\"</p><br/><p>\"Chief Li, why are you here?\"</p><br/><p>\"Director Liu, Director Zhu, Chief Li is here.\"</p><br/><p>Liu Guo Qiang and Zhu Xiu Qin were surrounded by the crowd and when they heard that Chief Li had come, they turned their heads instantly, then rushed forward, \"Chief Li\u2026\"</p><br/><p>But at that moment, Chief Li had a black face. He even had a man by his side.</p><br/><p>Liu Guo Qiang and Zhu Xiu Qin looked at the man by Chief Li's side. They didn't know who this man was but judging by Chief Li's eyes, he was probably a powerful man.</p><br/><p>Chief Li started to talk, \"This is Skyworth Organization's Chairman of the board of directors, Chief Lu, Lu Li. How have you two handled the situation at Cloud Street?\"</p><br/><p>Lu Li scanned the two of them, then turned his gaze to Lin Fan. A smile appeared on his face. He came to Lin Fan and said, \"Little Bro, we meet again.\"</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan saw that someone had come, he was startled for a moment, then he smiled thinly and said, \"Chief Lu, indeed, we meet again.\"</p><br/><p>Lu Li said, \"I've heard about the situation in Cloud Street. It was due to bad management on my part that resulted in this situation. If possible, I would wish to discuss with you properly about this.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan had taken Lu Li's name card before and he knew how powerful this man was. Even if he didn't have the name card, he could sense the noble aura from Lu Li's appearance. He was a wealthy and respectable man, not a typical person.</p><br/><p>\"You're too courteous, Chief Lu. You're an important person. You shouldn't worry about these small matters. It's already been settled, it's been settled perfectly.\"</p><br/><p>Lu Li shook his head. \"It's not perfect, not perfect at all. Skyworth Organization's objective is to ensure customer satisfaction. We take pride in working together with our clients. Even within our organization, we treat our employees the same way. We would never allow our employees to leave with any unhappiness, instead, we make sure they're happy and content. As for outside our organization, whenever people talk about us, they always give us a thumbs up as they praise us.\"</p><br/><p>\"Cloud Street is a property of our organization and you all are its owners. If you were all to leave, it wouldn't be a small matter. I hope that we can settle this properly. If there are issues on our side, I'm willing to apologize to everyone here.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded. \"Not bad. That sounds more like something a person should say.\"</p><br/><p>Lu Li: \"...\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

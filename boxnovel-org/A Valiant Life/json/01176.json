I\u2019m sorry for that. We will take full responsibility for this. How should we resolve this production problem?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved his hand. \u201cDo a thorough check and only take the best parts. Destroy those inferior ones. Tell the reporters the truth about the components and hide nothing from them. Let everyone know the situation.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf we were to use these inferior parts, they would be good enough in the short term, but there would definitely be huge problems in the future. Then things would really get out of hand.\u201d</p><br/><p>Secretary Chen nodded and understood the severity of the problem. \u201cAlright. I did not expect people would have dared to do this. It\u2019s too much. If not for Master Lin\u2019s discovery, the consequences would have been unimaginable.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang added, \u201cIt\u2019s f*cking bullsh*t. How could they do such incorrigible things? Aren\u2019t they afraid that their children wouldn\u2019t\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan patted Wang MIng Yang\u2019s shoulder, \u201cDon\u2019t take this to heart. Just be more vigilant in the future. You should send someone from your side to inspect the parts too.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang nodded. \u201cYeah, understood.\u201d</p><br/><p>Secretary Chen smiled awkwardly. This was certainly their fault. Now that Master Lin said such a thing, it showed that Master Lin did not trust them anymore. Hence, he was furious at people like Director Li that resulted in their reputation being tarnished.</p><br/><p>\u201cSecretary Chen, it\u2019s not that we do not trust you. We just want you to know the importance of this matter and that nothing can go wrong. Everyone has their own responsibilities,\u201d Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>Secretary Chen said, \u201cI understand. There will be no more problems from now on. As long as it is beneficial to the production of these artificial limbs, nothing will be a problem.\u201d</p><br/><p>At the news conference.</p><br/><p>The reporters sat in their respective areas and waited.</p><br/><p>They were really excited about the perfect artificial limbs, and they wondered how they would turn out. Furthermore, they heard that children from the Welfare Institute would be there too.</p><br/><p>Soon, Lin Fan and the others arrived.</p><br/><p>The reporters started to take pictures.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan signalled towards Secretary Chen.</p><br/><p>Secretary Chen nodded and stood up. Then, he took a bow. That scene shocked the reporters and they wondered what was that for.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, they even felt humbled after seeing their superior bow at them. They wondered what made him do that.</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone, I have an announcement to make. Because of a management problem in the government, some people have caused the production of the perfect artificial limbs to go wrong. Thankfully, Master Lin spotted it. Hence, the project will be delayed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporters were stunned after hearing that.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan cleared his throat, \u201cSecretary Chen, there is no other meaning behind that. There\u2019s probably only a small impact on the project. Since so many reporters are here to witness the perfect artificial limbs, let\u2019s invite our children to demonstrate the usefulness of them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Soon, a group of children ran happily towards the stage.</p><br/><p>The reporters turned their cameras towards them. They knew that these children were physically handicapped and that they were so active because of the help of the perfect artificial limbs.</p><br/><p>They started to jump, run, and do all sorts of difficult movements.</p><br/><p>That was sufficient in making the reporters forget about what had happened earlier. They just kept their cameras rolling as they were overwhelmed by shock.</p><br/><p>It was unbelievable.</p><br/><p>Then, the children stopped moving.</p><br/><p>The reporters clapped enthusiastically. It was simply too amazing. If they did not witness it themselves, they would not have believed it.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, these are really perfect artificial limbs. They\u2019re too good.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, if I didn\u2019t see this with my own eyes, I wouldn\u2019t have believed it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough something went wrong, we can\u2019t say that there\u2019s something wrong with these perfect artificial limbs. It must have been something personal, and the fact that Master Lin and the others apologised about it shows how much they care about this matter.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, that is very true. We can write that in the news articles. I believe the netizens will understand it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan tried to get the attention of the reporters. \u201cEveryone, we have demonstrated the power of the perfect artificial limbs. If you weren\u2019t informed about it, would you have believed it?\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporters shook their heads. \u201cOf course not.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, if we didn\u2019t know about them, we definitely wouldn\u2019t believe that it was all made possible by artificial limbs.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, a foreign reporter asked, \u201cMaster Lin, will they be available internationally?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded. \u201cYes. We will never hide anything from the world as long as it helps to solve problems.\u201d</p><br/><p>*clap*</p><br/><p>The reporters clapped enthusiastically again. The foreign reporter also nodded. He felt that what Master Lin said was awesome. As a firm believer of equality, he felt that what Master Lin said was perfect for improving the world.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, would you be looking for representatives internationally?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cIt\u2019s not appropriate for me to answer that as I am not in charge of that. Let me hand it over to Director Wang.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, Wang Ming Yang stood up and smiled. \u201cEveryone just witnessed the power of the perfect artificial limbs. Although a personal issue delayed the production, they will be made available to the market soon. We didn\u2019t produce these to make money since they are for the handicapped to use. It would help them regain confidence. We never intended to make money out of it. Hence, the price will be fixed, and the international pricing will also be reasonable.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut for now, it will only be available in China. We welcome people from all over the world to purchase it here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang did not actually think too much about the matter yet, but he answered it to the best of his ability.</p><br/><p>The reporters continued to ask questions about the perfect artificial limbs.</p><br/><p>Secretary Chen smiled. He was determined to investigate the matter thoroughly. He did not want anything to go wrong again.</p><br/><p>After the news conference.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shook Secretary Chen\u2019s hand. \u201cSecretary Chen, we will have to count on you for what is to follow.\u201d</p><br/><p>Secretary Chen smiled, \u201cMaster Lin, you are too polite. Don\u2019t worry, I will investigate it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d Lin Fan nodded. Then, he looked at Wang Ming Yang. \u201cYou gotta work hard too. I\u2019ll be heading off first. Let\u2019s just see what happens in the news tomorrow. Anyway, we did our best.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, sure.\u201d Wang Ming Yang nodded.</p></div>\n</div>"}

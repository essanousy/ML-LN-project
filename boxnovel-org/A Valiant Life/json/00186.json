Elder Dog Nicholas is unbelievable.\"</p><br/><p>\"Can someone people answer me if it's possible that these dogs have turned into some evil spirit?\"</p><br/><p>\"My mother asked me why am I kneeling and watching the live broadcast. I told her that I've been completely shocked by it.\"</p><br/><p>\"This has to be sent to the Guinness World Records.\"</p><br/><p>\"This cannot be, no it cannot. I need to go and lie down. I must be a little malnourished and now I'm just having hallucinations.\"</p><br/><p>Back at Cloud Street, it was just complete silence. All the residents could not believe what was happening in front of their eyes and they were all just stunned.</p><br/><p>A resident asked, \"Master Lin, what in the world is going on? What's up with these dogs?\"</p><br/><p>The residents all looked like they had seen a ghost. One by one they all started to stare at Master Lin as they all knew that this was all the doing of Master Lin. Although they all knew that Master Lin was amazing, however, this was really a truly amazing feat.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed and replied calmly, \"Don't worry, this will definitely work.\"</p><br/><p>The policeman looked at Master Lin in complete shock, wondering if he was even human. When he saw that Master Lin was capable of talking to a dog and that these dogs were also capable of understanding him, in all his years of being a policeman he had never seen anything like this before.</p><br/><p>Sister Hong was feeling very emotional. She grabbed Lin Fan's arm and asked, \"Master Lin, will you be able to find my little girl?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded his head and said, \"Don't worry, the chances of finding her are very high.\"</p><br/><p>Sister Hong's husband walked up to him and said with guilt in his voice, \"Master Lin I'm very sorry. Just now I thought that...\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved him off and said, \"I understand. I think anyone in this situation would have felt the same way.\"</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang looked at the live broadcast and said, \"Everyone, the Elder Dog has sent out his army to search for the little girl. I will be here on site to keep everyone updated on the latest situation. If the Elder Dog is able to find her, from today onwards, the Elder Dog will be my idol.\"</p><br/><p>\"+1.\"</p><br/><p>\"+2.\"</p><br/><p>\"The Elder Dog will definitely be successful.\"</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>On the road, a whole pack of dogs was frantically roaming around, leaving all the residents stunned.</p><br/><p>Elder Dog Nicholas came to a halt, turned around and barked a few words to the pack, \"The smell appears to be coming from 3 different directions. One group will go over there, another will follow me. If you guys don't find anything, then come back to this spot.\"</p><br/><p>Woof woof!</p><br/><p>\"Yes, Elder Dog,\" the pack of dogs replied.</p><br/><p>Some of the residents who had stopped to watch them had a shocked expression on their faces. They felt like the small little dog in front of them was talking to all these other dogs around. But they thought that it was not possible since they did not think dogs could communicate with each other.</p><br/><p>After this, Elder Dog Nicholas took one group with him and headed to the north side while the remaining dogs split into 2 groups and headed to the other 2 directions.</p><br/><p>Although Elder Dog Nicholas had very short legs, he could run pretty fast. With his four legs all working together in sync, he did not lose to the other much larger dogs.</p><br/><p>Some of the residents took out their phones and started to record what was unfolding in front of their eyes on video. They felt that this pack of dogs was extremely scary and they had no idea where they came from.</p><br/><p>One of the dogs following Elder Dog Nicholas was a fat and big-sized husky. He was sticking out his tongue and panting as he said, \"Elder Dog, I'm too tired, I can't go on.\"</p><br/><p>Elder Dog Nicholas immediately turned his head around and glared at the dog, saying, \"With the way you are, how are you fit to be one of my four leaders? I'm not going to call upon you next time.\"</p><br/><p>The husky grieved and then his four legs started to work like a motor, running even faster.</p><br/><p>Elder Dog Nicholas barked loudly, \"You're just a little brother, you should be following behind, why are you running so quickly?\"</p><br/><p>When they reached an alley, Elder Dog Nicholas came to a halt, he turned his head and said, \"One of my companions is in danger. Come, follow me.\"</p><br/><p>In the alley, there was a man in a sleeveless shirt holding onto a rope that was wrapped around a dog's neck and the dog was letting out a blood-curdling screech.</p><br/><p>There was a smile on the man's face as he said, \"Pure black Formosan mountain dogs are good for health!\"</p><br/><p>But at this moment, a stream of constant barking came from a distance and the man became very puzzled, wondering what had happened and where this barking was coming from.</p><br/><p>Woof woof~</p><br/><p>All of a sudden, a pack of dogs came into the alley and had the man surrounded.</p><br/><p>The black dog who was being tied up also started to shout at him.</p><br/><p>The man started laughing and said, \"Look at all these dogs, some of them are even of an expensive breed. If I can catch all of them I'll be able to earn a small fortune.\"</p><br/><p>Elder Dog Nicholas hissed, showing his teeth and took up a vicious stance. He started to slowly creep towards the man like he was getting ready to attack.</p><br/><p>The dogs behind him all followed suit, taking a ferocious pose.</p><br/><p>The man who had initially planned to catch all of the dogs suddenly felt a little shocked and felt the situation was a little grim.</p><br/><p>Woof woof~</p><br/><p>Elder Dog Nicholas' black eyes had a very fierce look in them as he held an unwavering stare at the man, almost like he was trying to warn him.</p><br/><p>The man was starting to feel very scared. There were a lot of dogs and some of them were pretty big in size. If any of them came up and bit him, the consequences would be pretty bad. In response to this, the black dog started to struggle while the rope was around his neck.</p><br/><p>The man seemed to understand what was going on as he let the rope go, freeing the dog and then he started to back into the corner.</p><br/><p>The black dog let out a bark to Elder Dog Nicholas saying, \"Thank you for saving me.\"</p><br/><p>Elder Dog Nicholas thought for a moment and let out a bark before turning around. He said, \"My name is Elder Dog Nicholas. If you want to roll with me then come and follow me.\"</p><br/><p>Woof woof~</p><br/><p>Elder Dog Nicholas moved out again, continuing to follow the smell and trying to find the origin of the smell. The black dog, with no hesitation, followed along with them.</p><br/><p>The man who was standing in the corner swallowed his saliva and said, \"It's like I've seen a ghost today.\"</p><br/><p>Back on Cloud Street, the residents were still there quietly waiting. They were eagerly waiting for the outcome of the search and there were more and more residents gathering there.</p><br/><p>At the start, they had no idea what was going on but they heard about it from other people. They heard that Master Lin had talked to the pack of dogs and sent them to go search for Sister Hong's little girl.</p><br/><p>To these residents, the whole thing was simply unimaginable and impossible. How could a dog listen to what a human says, let alone go and find a person?</p><br/><p>A resident said, \"Master Lin, it's already been 20 minutes. Why has there not been any news at all?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was extremely calm and composed. He knew that if the Elder Dog could not find her he would have come back already. If he had not come back yet, it meant that he was still searching or that the destination was very far away. However, what Lin Fan did not know was that Elder Dog Nicholas was about to get a huge breakthrough.</p><br/><p>On the first floor of a building, Elder Dog Nicholas instructed another dog, saying, \"You can go back, we have already found what we are looking for.\"</p><br/><p>The Chihuahua barked. The Elder Dog knew that she was a young girl and her fighting strength was not very great so he did not want to drag her into this affair.</p><br/><p>The two packs of dogs that split up initially had gathered to where Elder Dog Nicholas was.</p><br/><p>Woof woof~</p><br/><p>Woof woof~</p><br/><p>Many different breeds of dogs were all barking in unison.</p><br/><p>\"Elder Dog, what are we doing right now?\" one of the dogs inquired.</p><br/><p>\"The smell is coming from upstairs,\" he replied.</p><br/><p>\"Are we done with our job?\" the dog asked again.</p><br/><p>Elder Dog Nicholas let out a bark and said, \"Follow me, we're going to rush in.\"</p><br/><p>This building was very old, altogether having 5 stories and no lift. Also, the people living in this building were all elderly. Those taking a stroll were very curious after seeing so many dogs together.</p><br/><p>Elder Dog Nicholas' small legs made climbing the stairs very hard. He would jump with his rear legs and then climb up with his front legs, continuously climbing up the stairs. The husky thought the Elder Dog was climbing very slowly so he grabbed him by the neck and rushed up the stairs, dragging him along.</p><br/><p>At the fourth floor, the husky put Elder Dog down and then looked at Elder Dog, like he was expecting him to reward him. He was thinking that he was very awesome to be able to lift him up the stairs.</p><br/><p>Elder Dog Nicholas thought for a moment before looking at the husky and then using his two front legs to kick the husky in the face, trying to stop him from being so arrogant.</p><br/><p>Woof woof!</p><br/><p>\"Husky, go and charge into the door and then rush into the room,\" Elder Dog Nicholas instructed him.</p><br/><p>Elder Dog Nicholas started to formulate his plan. He knew that with his small body he would not be able to break the door.</p><br/><p>Bam!</p><br/><p>Bam!</p><br/><p>Inside the room, the two women and the man heard the sound from the door and felt a bit anxious.</p><br/><p>The man said, \"Don't make any noise, I'm going to go check it out.\"</p><br/><p>The two women nodded.</p><br/><p>The man looked through the peephole on the door and looked outside. He realized there was no one there but there was still the sound of banging on the door and there was also the sound of dogs calling.</p><br/><p>The man turned around and laughed, \"There's no one there, looks like it's just a dog.\"</p><br/><p>The black-skinned lady laughed and said, \"Let the dog in. We're already in contact with the dog trafficker and we can just sell him off as well.\"</p><br/><p>The man nodded and let the door open. But right as he opened the door, a husky came charging into the room.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

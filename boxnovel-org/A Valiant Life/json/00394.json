Zhao Ming Qing's outfit was grand and formal. Then, he smiled as he looked at the hotel behind. \"They made it extremely grand.\"</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing waved his hand. \"Teacher, tonight's the discipleship ceremony, it has to be even grander. I've invited my old friends in the same line of work to witness this event.\"</p><br/><p>The venue was in Shanghai and it was held in a top hotel. It could be said that Zhao Ming Qing had used the best for everything.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded. It was the first time having a disciple and it was the first time Zhao Ming Qing had a mentor. He obviously wanted it to be a grand ceremony.</p><br/><p>It was the first time Zhao Shi had seen the conman that she had heard about. She looked at him and realized that he was young and he looked decent. How could a young man like him be a con artist? She didn't know what methods this conman had used to cheat her husband.</p><br/><p>Although she didn't know much about Chinese medicine, she knew that experienced Chinese medical doctors were extremely old. How could a young man like him be so capable? However, she didn't say much as she didn't want her husband to be unhappy. Hence, she looked happy and amicable.</p><br/><p>\"Teacher, this is my wife,\" Zhao Ming Qing introduced.</p><br/><p>\"Master Lin,\" Zhao Shi greeted politely. She had to be courteous in everything that she was doing.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. It was awkward facing an old couple and even having a disciple as old as him. Normal people would definitely not tolerate such a thing.</p><br/><p>Zhao Qing Ming dragged Lin Fan, \"Master, I\u2026 I\u2026 Hey, where did Li Xing go?\"</p><br/><p>\"Dad, big brother, second brother and third brother all went to settle something. They'll be back soon,\" Zhao Qun Fang said. She looked a little mysterious. She knew what her three brothers had gone to do and she was analyzing Lin Fan but she couldn't figure out what was wrong. However, she knew that he was a conman.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. \"Elder Mu, you're so healthy.\"</p><br/><p>Elder Mu smiled upon hearing that, \"Master Lin, you're saying I'm healthy?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded. \"Yeah, no illness at all.\"</p><br/><p>Elder Mu was relieved to hear something like that from the godly doctor. It was even better than doing the mini-tests in the hospitals. He trusted Master Lin's medical skills and had no doubts about them. He had asked the three of them, including Li Xing, to start calling the guests. He didn't know what they were doing and thought that they wanted to infuriate Elder Zhao.</p><br/><p>Then, Zhao Ming Qing smiled. \"Teacher, let's go in first.\"</p><br/><p>\"Alright.\" Lin Fan nodded. It was his first time attending a grand ceremony. He hadn't even told Fraud Tian and the rest about having a disciple. He also didn't bring them along to prevent them from being shocked. Their shocked expressions would definitely ruin the atmosphere.</p><br/><p>Also, Lin Fan wanted to show off. Besides, it was better to not tell them everything.</p><br/><p>In the hospital. In the grand lounge.</p><br/><p>It was specially decorated and it looked extremely grand. The tables had been moved away and a chair had been placed in the middle. The two sides were lined with chairs.</p><br/><p>Although Lin Fan had never gone through a discipleship ceremony before, he knew that this one was especially grand.</p><br/><p>\"Master, wait for a while. My friends will be here later. 7:18 would be the best time.\" Zhao Ming Qing had done a lot of preparations for the ceremony. It ranged from the hotel decorations to the minute details like the time. Although it was a little superstitious, it showed how much he cared about this.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing had been interested in Chinese medicine since young. It was mainly because his parents always fell ill and they often visited the physician back in their village. Over time, he had been unknowingly influenced by the physician. When he had been studying in school, it also sparked an interest in Chinese medicine.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing had never had a mentor and Lin Fan was his first. He wanted to make it as grand as possible.</p><br/><p>Zhao Qun Fang looked at the situation and got worried. Then, she quickly went to look for her three brothers. When she found them, they were already on the phone.</p><br/><p>\"Uncle Li, sorry. Please come and save us. Our dad is serious about having a mentor. If you don't come over, it'll be over for us.\"</p><br/><p>\"What are you guys trying to do? I'm so close to your dad and obviously, I have to be there for his mentorship ceremony. Then, you said he's a conman. I\u2026 Ugh, I'll be there soon.\"</p><br/><p>They called more and more people and Zhao Li Xing was simply frightened, especially after he heard Uncle Xian's words.</p><br/><p>He wasn't afraid of anyone at work. The only person he feared was his dad.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing held his children's education in high regard. He had been strict with them since young. However, he had never hit them with force. The only thing he wanted them to remember was to respect people.</p><br/><p>\"Bro, how's the situation now?\" Zhao Qun Fang asked.</p><br/><p>\"Sister, how're things over there?\" Zhao Li Xing asked.</p><br/><p>\"Doesn't look good. The ceremony will start at 7:18. Look at the time. I think we can't make it in time. Think about how we're going to answer to dad,\" Zhao Qun Fang said.</p><br/><p>Zhao Li Xing was dumbfounded. He had been afraid of his father being conned but the situation had been totally unexpected.</p><br/><p>Zhao Bing said, \"Bro, let's go back after this call. It's okay for dad to rage at us. We have to fight for him, or else it'd be too late.\"</p><br/><p>\"What did this fella feed our dad? He is literally\u2026 Ugh.\" Zhao Li Xing didn't want to continue speaking. \"Let's go back after this call.\"</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Time passed quickly.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing felt a little puzzled as his friends weren't there at all. Then, he stood beside his mentor and remained silent. He didn't even make a call and he started to tremble. It wasn't fear. It was rage.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan realized that the situation was a little weird but he didn't bother about it. Then, he looked at the time and it was already seven o'clock.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing stood up and said, \"Teacher, have a seat.\"</p><br/><p>Then, Lin Fan sat in the middle seat while Zhao Ming Qing sat beside him. According to the plan, the two sides lined with chairs should have been totally packed with invited guests. They were supposed to be there to witness the ceremony. However, there was only one person and it was Elder Mu.</p><br/><p>Zhao Shi stood a distance away and got worried when she saw his expressions. If she had known about this, she wouldn't have gotten her children to interfere with things.</p><br/><p>Then, Zhao Li Xing and his brothers and sister came in. When they saw what was happening, their hearts started beating extremely quickly. They looked at each other when they realized that their dad looked extremely furious. Then, they realized that they hadn't considered their dad's love for Chinese medicine when they tried to ruin the ceremony.</p><br/><p>*clatter*</p><br/><p>The four of them kneeled on the ground.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing just ignored them. He looked at the time and it was already 7:18. It was time for the ceremony to start.</p><br/><p>He didn't wait any longer and went to Lin Fan. He said with a hoarse trembling voice, \"Master, I, Zhao Ming Qing, a Chinese Qingshui citizen, have been learning Chinese medicine since I was six years old. Now, I'm seventy-two and I'm the director of Shanghai's First Chinese Medicine Academy. Today, I would like to be your disciple. Please accept me.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan stood up sternly. \"I, Lin Fan, am a Chinese Zhongzhou man.\"</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing greeted Lin Fan with three bows. Then, he took a cup of tea from Zhao Shi.</p><br/><p>\"Teacher, please have some tea.\" Zhao Ming Qing bowed and handed the cup of tea.</p><br/><p>\"I promise to teach you everything I know and help you to the best of my ability. I hope you can give your best too. In the future, you have to stay on the right path. You cannot be tempted by wealth and power. You have to view everyone as equals,\" Lin Fan said sternly as he took the cup of tea.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing nodded. \"I will remember your wise advice.\"</p><br/><p>Then, Lin Fan passed a packaged book to him. \"This is 'Various Types of Typhoid'. Study it carefully and you can ask me anything you don't know.\"</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing carefully took the book over. \"Thank you, teacher.\"</p><br/><p>Then, Elder Mu stood up and took out a card. He had to read it out for the people to hear and understand what the ceremony was about. Even though there was nobody there, he had to make it formal.</p><br/><p>Elder Mu coughed gently and spoke clearly, \"Zhao Ming Qing is knowledgeable in Chinese medicine but he felt the need to learn more. He had always wanted a mentor to guide him but he never had the chance to meet a virtuous man. Today, he has finally met someone capable who's willing to share his knowledge. Today, I, Mr. Mu, invite Mr. Lin Fan to take Zhao Ming Qing as your disciple and to teach him wholeheartedly so that he can get through difficult times with your guidance. Today, you agree to not give up on him so that he can learn new knowledge and remember it till the day he dies.\"</p><br/><p>\"The ceremony is complete. I, Mu Xian, am the witness.\"</p><br/><p>Elder Mu smiled to appease the situation. \"Congratulations, Elder Zhao. Come, I'll take a picture of the both of you.\"</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing smiled as the ceremony ended. Then, he stood beside Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>*snap*</p><br/><p>It had been a success.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing's sons and daughter were still kneeling on the floor. They were being ignored but their hearts were beating extremely quickly.</p><br/><p>They finally understood the outcome which Uncle Mu had said to them. Their dad was a calm man but his rage was extremely horrifying.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

It was leaving him helpless.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t expect this fella to make use of broadcasts and actually broadcasted their conversation. Furthermore, a few million people had watched it. He didn\u2019t dare to think of the consequences anymore.</p><br/><p>Something was probably going to blow up tomorrow.</p><br/><p>It might even start tonight.</p><br/><p>Then, there were sounds of feet shuffling outside.</p><br/><p>*slam*</p><br/><p>The door was pushed open and a group of subordinates was standing outside. One of the bald subordinates was really anxious, \u201cGodfather Liu, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGet out!\u201d Godfather Qin shouted. His face was as black as thunder.</p><br/><p>He wasn\u2019t going to have a higher chance of winning even if there were back up.</p><br/><p>Those subordinates didn\u2019t know what to do after seeing Godfather Qin. Then, they turned to look at Godfather Liu. They were Godfather Liu\u2019s subordinates and only he could command them.</p><br/><p>Godfather Liu tried to calm down and he looked at Lin Fan seriously. When he saw Godfather Qin\u2019s expressions, he waved his hands and mumbled, \u201cGet out.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Lin Fan heaved a sigh of relief. He didn\u2019t want to start a fight. He didn\u2019t want to resort to violence.</p><br/><p>There was a moment of silence in the room.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan felt that the atmosphere was a little weird. He felt that his presence was useless.</p><br/><p>\u201cGodfather Liu and Godfather Qin, I\u2019ll be leaving first. This matter has to be resolved by the two of you. I am only providing a platform for you. I don\u2019t really care about other things.\u201d Lin Fan wanted to leave quickly.</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t have done anything else about it. After all, he couldn\u2019t take back the words he said.</p><br/><p>After all, spilled water was difficult to retrieve.</p><br/><p>In the broadcasting room.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat was scary. I thought sh*t was about to go down.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, there were so many people just now. If all of them were to charge at him, Master Lin would probably have to kneel and beg for mercy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKneel my a*s. Master Lin is incredible. These losers aren\u2019t good enough.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin just exposed a heinous operation. Things are bound to happen.\u201d</p><br/><p>At a random leader\u2019s house in the northeastern region.</p><br/><p>Zhu Ting Jian furrowed his brows. Recently, the northeastern region wasn\u2019t really peaceful. He had found out about Godfather Liu\u2019s situation with the logistics. Furthermore, there was a large amount of drugs. It had attracted the attention of many people.</p><br/><p>However, what he didn\u2019t expect was that these illegal people actually treated everyone like fools. They immediately found a scapegoat and suppressed all the media platforms so that nobody would dare to report about it.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, there were several reports online that got mysteriously removed. They just didn\u2019t want to have any news of it online.</p><br/><p>It was a normal procedure. Many powerful individuals were capable of doing that.</p><br/><p>Parasites were difficult to manage.</p><br/><p>Even if he had authority, the situation was complicated and he couldn\u2019t remove this bunch of parasites without any evidence. It was literally impossible.</p><br/><p>\u201cDad\u2026\u201d Then, a fashionable youngster rushed into the room with his phone.</p><br/><p>Zhu Ting Jian looked at his son and furrowed his brows. He was also really worried about his son.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it? Why are you so anxious? What happened?\u201d Zhu Ting Jian said.</p><br/><p>\u201cDad, something\u2019s wrong! I was looking through the broadcasts and I saw this broadcast that showed Master Lin meeting Godfather Liu and Godfather Qin. In the broadcast, Godfather Liu said everything about the drugs clearly. Look\u2026\u201d He immediately placed the phone in front of his dad and played that specific part of the broadcast.</p><br/><p>In the broadcast, the people said unbelievable things.</p><br/><p>Zhu Ting Jian didn\u2019t really care about it. However, he was stunned. He smiled, \u201cIs this real?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, dad. Look at the broadcast.\u201d His son switched the channel back to the live scene. The people in the room weren\u2019t talking. Godfather Liu and Godfather Qin\u2019s faces were as black as thunder.</p><br/><p>Zhu Ting Jian looked at the two of them closely. He confirmed that the two of them were the people that he hated the most.</p><br/><p>Now that he had evidence of their evil doings and them admitting to it, he wanted to destroy the both of them.</p><br/><p>Then, Zhu Ting Jian called someone without any hesitation.</p><br/><p>\u201cSend the men to Golden City Hotel. I will be there shortly,\u201d Zhu Ting Jian immediately gave the orders.</p><br/><p>Those that picked up the phone were stunned when they saw that the leader had called. They didn\u2019t know what had happened but they could only listen to the orders.</p><br/><p>In the private room.</p><br/><p>Godfather Qin looked at Lin Fan, \u201cGood, well done.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved his hand, \u201cDon\u2019t praise me. I\u2019m not really good. You guys are too cooperative. Godfather Liu is too courageous. It almost scared the f*ck out of me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Godfather Qin was thinking about what had happened. Although he didn\u2019t participate in it, he couldn\u2019t say that he wasn\u2019t involved in it. He knew that a group of people and Lil\u2019 Liu were going to face the music.</p><br/><p>Something had happened. Something really happened.</p><br/><p>Even though he was crafty, he said the truth in front of millions of people. Even the Heavens couldn\u2019t possibly save him.</p><br/><p>Unless they ignored everything.</p><br/><p>However, that was impossible. How could he cover up everything?</p><br/><p>Lin Fan just stood there as he couldn\u2019t leave anymore.</p><br/><p>Suddenly!</p><br/><p>A subordinate rushed into the room, \u201cGodfather Liu, there are a lot of police outside!\u201d</p><br/><p>Godfather Liu was stunned. His face was as white as paper. With everyone looking at them, he couldn\u2019t think about taking Lin Fan\u2019s life anymore. He had to think about himself.</p><br/><p>Then, he tried to seek Godfather Qin\u2019s help but Godfather Qin couldn\u2019t even save himself. Obviously, he didn\u2019t care about him. However, he couldn\u2019t leave Godfather Liu behind. After all, Lil\u2019 Liu knew too much. Then, he looked at him and asked them to calm down.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t move. Everyone, don\u2019t move.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, the police rushed in. Zhu Ting Jian emerged from the crowd.</p><br/><p>When Godfather Qin saw him, his face changed. He didn\u2019t expect him to come here.</p><br/><p>However, he thought about it for a moment and understood it. Who else besides him dared to rush into this hotel?</p><br/><p>Ever since he had been appointed to his position, he had been trying to counter the mafia. However, Godfather Qin was deeply rooted in the underworld and it wasn\u2019t that easy to get rid of him.</p><br/><p>Zhu Ting Jian nodded at Lin Fan as a form of praise. Then, he waved his hand, \u201cBring them out.\u201d</p><br/><p>Godfather Qin just sat there, \u201cI am just an old man. It has nothing to do with me. I am just here for a meal.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Ting Jian smiled, \u201cGodfather Qin, you have to see where you\u2019re dining at.\u201d Then, he said sternly, \u201cBring him out too.\u201d</p><br/><p>The surrounding policemen didn\u2019t know what had happened but they just handcuffed the people without any hesitation.</p><br/><p>When the policemen were going to arrest Lin Fan, Zhu Ting Jian said, \u201cDon\u2019t have to handcuff him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cUm, can I leave now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhu Ting Jian smiled, \u201cMaster Lin, let\u2019s have a talk.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p></div>\n</div>"}

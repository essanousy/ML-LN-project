Wu You Lan was back and Wu Huan Yue had gone back.</p><br/><p>He made a call to Wu Huan Yue. On the phone, she sounded pretty happy. Although there was an injury on her forehead, she didn't complain. Even though there was someone extra today, she was still happy with everything.</p><br/><p>After hanging up, Lin Fan just sat there as Wu You Lan poured a cup of tea.</p><br/><p>\"What happened afterward? Did something happen?\" Wu You Lan asked curiously.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shook his head, \"Nothing much, just minor stuff.\"</p><br/><p>He didn't want to tell anyone about the incident before it was concluded. This was to prevent any accidents from happening.</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang was telling everyone in the broadcast about what Master Lin had encountered. Everyone in the broadcast was furious after hearing about it.</p><br/><p>Woof woof!</p><br/><p>Elder Dog Nicholas came over. Elder Dog was living a carefree and easy life. He could just go anywhere, anytime he liked, including Sister Hong's shop opposite. He had no obstructions at all. Occasionally, he would go over to f*ck the poodle. Although it wasn't much, at least he had something to look forward to, going there to f*ck everyday.</p><br/><p>A few days later.</p><br/><p>The days passed peacefully but he knew that Liu Xiao Tian and his team had already started working. In accordance with Wang Shen's small notebook, they had practically locked onto all the targets. If only they could take action immediately without having to consider that the culprits might get alarmed and harm the children, they would have immediately charged towards them.</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian would make a call sometimes to report on the work progress. Lin Fan actually told him that there wasn't a need for him to report anything to him. But from Liu Xiao Tian's perspective, Master Lin had been of such great help and he wanted him to know whenever there was any progress.</p><br/><p>At the shop entrance.</p><br/><p>The townsfolk said, \"Master Lin, we've gotten our number tags. It's time to call out the numbers.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan recovered from his daze and smiled. \"Alright\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Elder Dog Nicholas didn't let any of his friends to Lin Fan's shop as he wanted to have the scallion pancake all to himself. But his friends were living such good lives. The fans had donated so much dog food to Elder Dog and it was getting a little scary. After sharing the food with his friends, these dogs had more than enough food. They were well-fed everyday and had forgotten about the scallion pancakes.</p><br/><p>There was an increasing number of people who knew about the scallion pancakes. The number of people queueing up had been increasing daily but they all felt that the daily limit of ten pancakes was just bullsh*t. But they couldn't do anything about it. Nobody forced them to purchase any pancakes and they could leave anytime they wanted. Furthermore, whenever someone left, the other townsfolk would have smiles on their face as they felt like the competition for the scallion pancakes had decreased.</p><br/><p>Piece by piece, the scallion pancakes were prepared and ready to be consumed. Those townsfolk that were chosen were elated while those that came for the first time just stood at the door and read the poster.</p><br/><p>They heard that if they could understand the poster, they'd be able to get a piece of scallion pancake. In the past few days, there was quite a number of people that came over to try it out and there were many who passed.</p><br/><p>\"Encyclopedic Points +1.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was elated when he heard it, he had gained another Encyclopedic Point. After spending 100 Encyclopedic Points, he only had 18 points left. After this period of hard work, he finally accumulated 30 Encyclopedic Points. Although it wasn't a lot, it was still an improvement.</p><br/><p>As he looked at the townsfolk eating the scallion pancakes, he felt a sense of pride and achievement.</p><br/><p>After finishing the sales, Lin Fan just lay down in his shop.</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang was playing with his phone when suddenly, he exclaimed, \"Master Lin, look at this piece of news!\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan didn't know what was going on. He opened up WeChat and Zhao Zhong Yang sent a link.</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang: \"That's impressive. I didn't expect these human traffickers to have an organization, the network is simply too big.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was elated. It had only been five days and it was already completed?</p><br/><p>He switched on the news.</p><br/><p>\"The following is a piece of breaking news. The Shanghai police force collaborated with the police force of Northeastern China to crack a human trafficking case. They arrested over 1,300 people and saved over 1,200 people. This is the biggest human trafficking case in the nation's history\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the piece of news and was relieved. He didn't expect them to take action so swiftly. It's only been five days and the case was closed.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian pointed at the news and laughed, \"That was awesome. These human traffickers are the worst. If I were to meet them, I'd definitely beat them up.\"</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang chuckled, \"This is definitely something worth celebrating. This human trafficking organization is pretty d*mn large-scale. There are already 1,300 members arrested, how many more do you think there are?\"</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan shook her head, \"It's a blessing to have found 1,200 children. It probably shook the confidence of these human traffickers.\"</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang sighed, \"These human traffickers are so arrogant. Sometimes they just snatch the kids over by force. They would pretend to be family members and snatch the child away after 'quarreling' with each other. They have many ways. Sometimes when the child is lucky, there would be help from the passers-by. Most of them would just look at the situation and do nothing about it. This is mainly the reason why these human traffickers became arrogant.\"</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian looked at Lin Fan, \"The news mentioned that this case was cracked because of a townsfolk and they wouldn't have been able to resolve it without his help. Who do you think it is? He's incredible. I'm in awe.\"</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan heard Fraud Tian's words, he got a little scared. He quickly waved his hands and said, \"Don't be. He'd be frightened if you were in awe.\"</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian was stunned, \"What are you saying? What do you mean he'd be frightened by me being in awe?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan took a sip of tea and chuckled, \"Actually, remember that time when you asked me why I went to the police station? I can tell you about it now. That good townsfolk that was mentioned in the news is actually me.\"</p><br/><p>\"Huh?\"</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian shook his head, \"Stop bullsh*ting, please. The sun hasn't even set yet.\"</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang chuckled, \"Master Lin, I can't give you full marks for this bullsh*t.\"</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan and Wu Tian He also looked at Lin Fan in disbelief.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan saw their expressions and shook his head helplessly. Sometimes, even when he spoke the truth, nobody believed him.</p><br/><p>Then, a police car stopped outside.</p><br/><p>Everyone looked over curiously. They didn't know why the police came to their shop.</p><br/><p>A spirited Liu Xiao Tian came down from the car and shouted, \"Master Lin\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled and stood up, \"Chief Liu, now that the case has been cracked, shouldn't you be celebrating? Why did you come here?\"</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian smiled, \"It's all thanks to you. Without you, how could we have cracked this case? I came over to let you know that there will be an honors ceremony tomorrow. The abducted children will also be reunited with their real parents. You did such a good job. You can't possibly be absent for it.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed. Then, he looked behind at the others in the shop. It was clear that he wasn't bullsh*ting.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian was stunned and he just stared blankly at Lin Fan. He didn't expect it to be true.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan exclaimed in shock, \"Master Lin, could it be that the person that was speeding that day was a human trafficker?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled, \"That's about right. What a good guess.\"</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian smiled, \"Master Lin is too d*mn good. He could see through them with just one look. He's so accurate. The policemen from the other police force asked me how I found out about it but I didn't even know how to reply. Anyway, I'm going to tell everyone about you tomorrow. There will be a Q&amp;A for you at the ceremony.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan just smiled as he didn't know what to say.</p><br/><p>If he told the other police officers that it was all based on a fortune teller's predictions, they might really vomit blood.</p><br/><p>...</p><br/>\n</div>"}

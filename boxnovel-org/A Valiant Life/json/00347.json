In the past, when our Inspector Liu was the enforcement officer, he was so friendly. He was simply a flower among the other enforcement officers.\"</p><br/><p>\"That's one of the main reasons why Inspector Liu was able to go from an enforcement officer to become a police officer. Not everyone can be like Inspector Liu.\"</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan heard this, he couldn't help but laugh. He wondered if Inspector Liu would have broken into joy if he had heard that.</p><br/><p>Thinking about it, it really was true. Back when Liu Xiao Tian had been Chief enforcement officer, he had really been very friendly. Even when Lin Fan had been caught, he wouldn't do anything physically to Lin Fan nor would he speak in an uncivilized manner. Indeed, it was best not to compare people.</p><br/><p>The surrounding townsfolk had recorded the whole incident. Nowadays, in this Internet society, no news could be hidden. Anything that happened in public would appear instantly on the Internet.</p><br/><p>At that moment, outside Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>Those seven guys hadn't left yet and each of them was cursing, \"These people must have eaten an ambitious leopard's guts.\"</p><br/><p>\"This matter isn't over. If we don't show them something, they won't know the immensity of heaven and earth.\"</p><br/><p>Then, several cars arrived.</p><br/><p>One of the men said, \"They're here.\"</p><br/><p>The cars stopped. A young guy got off from a car and asked, \"Qiu Zhong Dui, what happened here?\"</p><br/><p>That middle-aged man was Qiu Zhong Dui. He said, \"Don't ask so much. Put on your helmets, guys. The people in here have obstructed law enforcement. They even made a move on us and hurt us. When we go in, beat them up.\"</p><br/><p>The young man was shocked. \"Qiu Zhong Dui, don't be rash. These are townsfolk. We can't do that.\"</p><br/><p>Qiu Zhong Dui pointed at the young man. With a rude glare, he said, \"What are you saying? Are you going to follow me or not?\"</p><br/><p>The young man shook his head. \"I'm not going. This is against the law. As law enforcers, we can't do what we know is wrong. No matter what the situation is, we need to investigate first. We can't just go and hit them.\"</p><br/><p>The man standing next to Qiu Zhong Dui went forward and shoved that young man. \"You're such a f*cking coward. We got beaten by them and yet, you don't want to f*cking help us. And you're even standing at the side, saying all these remarks. When this matter is over, I'll have you take a good look.\" Then, he looked at the people behind and said, \"Are you all following us?\"</p><br/><p>The young man wasn't frightened at all. He looked at the colleagues behind him and said, \"You guys, don't be rash too. We have to do this according to standard procedure. We can't resolve violence with violence.\"</p><br/><p>In the end, some of the enforcement officers hesitated but some others didn't. They said, \"Zhong Dui, we'll follow you. That Shao Jie has the guts of a rat. He studied in university but I think he studied so much that he became stupid.\"</p><br/><p>Shao Jie was getting anxious. \"Don't be rash. This is breaking the law. We live in a peaceful society. If you do this, you'd be bringing shame to the uniforms we're wearing.\"</p><br/><p>\"F*ck your mom.\" A man standing next to Qiu Zhong Dui shoved Shao Jie to the car, then he gestured with his hand. \"We're going in. If those sly townsfolk fight back, we won't hold back. We'll fight to the death.\"</p><br/><p>\"You guys\u2026\" As he looked at the situation, Shao Jie was stunned. Those enforcement officers that didn't go rushed over to him. \"Shao Jie, what are we going to do now? They're going to cause a ruckus.\"</p><br/><p>Shao Jie said, \"Hurry up and give the Head Chief a call! Something bad is about to happen.\"</p><br/><p>Another man from the side cursed, \"F*cking hell! I really don't know how they got this job. This way of doing things will tarnish our reputation. Even when I go patrolling with them, I feel ashamed. People look at us like we're bandits entering the town.\"</p><br/><p>The local police station.</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian was sitting down with a middle-aged man, drinking tea.</p><br/><p>\"Brother Liu, you're amazing. I haven't seen you in a while and you've already become a head of department, an inspector,\" said Head Chief Wang with a smile.</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian laughed. \"Stop flattering me. We used to be comrades in the past. I was only lucky. It's been a while since we've last met.\"</p><br/><p>Head Chief Wang chuckled. \"Yeah. you're busy nowadays and I'm busy too. We don't even have time to meet. I think this is what we should do; let's find a day to meet at my place. Just the two of us drinking some wine and having a chat. How's that?\"</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian said, \"Alright. It's been so long since I've eaten your wife's cooking.</p><br/><p>Head Chief Wang roared with laughter. \"I was just afraid that you'd be looking down on me now!\"</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian laughed. \"Cheh! What kind of person do you take me as?\"</p><br/><p>*Ring ring*</p><br/><p>The phone rang.</p><br/><p>Head Chief Wang said with a smile, \"Look. When I'm not around, those guys under me call me. This Shao Jie is not bad. He graduated from a renown university and because of god knows what, he decided to become an enforcement officer. Don't you think that's a waste of talent?\"</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian smiled and said, \"That's fine. How is it a waste of talent? As long as he safeguards the stability of our society, it doesn't matter what occupation he goes to, they're all noble. Hurry up and answer the call. It might really be something important.\"</p><br/><p>Head Chief Wang answered the call. Before he spoke, a voice came from the phone. When he heard what was going on, Head Chief Wang's face changed. It became an ugly expression.</p><br/><p>\"Go and stop them! If they dare to cause any trouble, I'll skin them alive!\" growled Head Chief Wang. Then, he hung up and said, \"Brother Liu, I can't chat anymore today. Something has happened on my side.\"</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian inquired, \"What happened?\"</p><br/><p>Head Chief Wang said angrily, \"Have a guess what those guys are doing. They're gathering the enforcement officers to beat people up at Cloud Street! What's going to happen if this gets out of hand? What else could happen? I, as the Head Chief, will have to bear all the consequences!\"</p><br/><p>\"What?\" When Liu Xiao Tian heard the words 'Cloud Street', he was instantly shocked. Then, he pulled on Head Chief Wang and said, \"Go, go. I'll follow you.\"</p><br/><p>Outside.</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian said, \"Gather the men. You'll all follow me to Hong Tian District's Cloud Street.\"</p><br/><p>The police officer said, \"Inspector, that place isn't under our jurisdiction.\"</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian said, \"What's this rubbish? If I tell you to gather, then gather. Quick!\"</p><br/><p>Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>Two policemen passed by.</p><br/><p>One of them was a rather old policeman and the one beside him was a young man. The young man was just a second year student at the Shanghai Police Officer Vocational College doing his field work.</p><br/><p>\"Master, if I become a police officer in future, will I come here to patrol as well?\" Zhou Jia Cai asked curiously.</p><br/><p>Ren Jun smiled and replied, \"Next time, there will be further arrangements. Shanghai is a large city. It's the safest city in our country. Therefore, at every place, there are colleagues of ours.\"</p><br/><p>Zhou Jia Cai nodded. Then, he looked afar. \"Master, look at what's going on there.\"</p><br/><p>Ren Jun raised his head and looked. Then, he was stunned. \"Hurry up and see what the heck is going on.\"</p><br/><p>At that moment, Qiu Zhong Tian was in a raging fury. The aggressive ten over colleagues following behind him were all wearing stab-proof vests and helmets. They were all carrying tools.</p><br/><p>The townsfolk who were strolling along Cloud Street saw these people. The shop owners who were near the front of the street saw them as well. They were all shocked. They immediately went to Little Boss to report the situation.</p><br/><p>Ren Jun said, \"What are you all doing here?\"</p><br/><p>Qiu Zhong Dui was filled with rage. \"We're enforcing the law.\"</p><br/><p>Ren Jun furrowed his eyebrows. He realized that something was wrong with these guys' expressions. Moreover, they were carrying tools. It looked like something bad was going to happen. \"Don't move.\" Then, he said to his student, \"Jia Cai, call our people over.\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes, Master.\" Zhou Jia Cai nodded. But just as he was about to call for backup, a walkie-talkie came out of nowhere and smashed into Zhou Jia Cai's face.</p><br/><p>Qiu Zhong Dui shoved Ren Jun aside. \"Don't be so f*cking nosy. Hurry up and scram.\"</p><br/><p>\"What are you all doing? You dare to assault\u2026\" Before he finished his sentence, a helmet came swinging from nowhere and suddenly smashed into Ren Jun's face.</p><br/><p>At the same time, someone snatched the law enforcement recording device from his chest.</p><br/><p>As Ren Jun backed off, there were people using helmets and walkie-talkies to smash his head.</p><br/><p>The surrounding townsfolk were astonished. How can this be...?</p><br/><p>\"Little Boss, it's bad. They're back again\u2026\" Lin Fan didn't know what was going on initially. When he heard this, he was shocked. Then, he hurried outside.</p><br/><p>But when he saw them, he was completely dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>These people had too much guts.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

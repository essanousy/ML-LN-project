He was a recognized figure in Shanghai, how could he not know anyone who could get a stuntman for him?</p><br/><p>After thinking of that, Wang Ke Hao heaved a sigh of relief. It looked like the matter was about to be resolved.</p><br/><p>However, he still vowed to never employ this particular stuntman ever again.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked around. \u201cWhat car are we going to use for the stunt later?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ke Hao didn\u2019t really think too much about the question, he just walked towards a car and replied, \u201cMaster Lin, we\u2019re using this one.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded as the car was pretty decent. Then, he asked, \u201cWhat do you require the stunt to be like?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ke Hao didn\u2019t know why Master Lin was asking those questions. He thought about it and felt that perhaps it was because Master Lin was great friends with the stuntman and knew about his capabilities. Hence, he needed to find out more about the stunt so that he could confirm if the stuntman could perform it.</p><br/><p>Wang Ke Hao sighed after thinking about how responsible Master Lin was for asking about the intricate details of the stunt. He probably didn\u2019t want the stuntman to make a wasted trip.</p><br/><p>However, Wang Ke Hao didn\u2019t know how to convey the message to him. Hence, he got the stunt coordinator to come over.</p><br/><p>The stunt instructor was a middle-aged man and he treated Lin Fan with respect. After all, everyone knew about Lin Fan. Then, he started to explain the stunt to him.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, you mean that the rear wheels of the car should be raised and the car will be moving off the ground? Then, it\u2019ll make a 360-degree turn. Is that correct?\u201d Lin Fan asked.</p><br/><p>The stunt instructor nodded. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s about it. The rest would depend on the creativity of the stuntman. The main thing is that the car has to flip around at the end.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, I understand now. It\u2019s not that difficult,\u201d Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>The stunt instructor looked at him helplessly. The stunt was actually pretty difficult to do. The individual components weren\u2019t difficult to execute but it was difficult to execute everything smoothly. There weren\u2019t many people who could execute it perfectly.</p><br/><p>The camera angle would be fixed and the stuntman had to execute everything in one take. Nobody would be confident enough to guarantee success.</p><br/><p>Wang Ke Hao said, \u201cMaster Lin, is that okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded. \u201cYes, it\u2019s simple.\u201d</p><br/><p>If it were someone else who said that, he would definitely think that this person was bragging. However, since Master Lin was the one who said it, he had to believe that it was a simple stunt. After all, Master Lin had said it so confidently.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, don\u2019t worry. The price will definitely be satisfactory.\u201d Although he thought that Master Lin was going to look for someone through his connections, he still had to be paid.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan immediately opened the car door and sat inside. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. Director Wang actually came to the Welfare Institute to film. I\u2019ll do it for free.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, Wang Ke Hao was stunned when he saw Master Lin sitting in the car. He didn\u2019t understand what he meant.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, you are\u2026?\u201d He decided to ask him.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. \u201cI\u2019ll execute the stunt for you. Didn\u2019t I say it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Wang Ke Hao hesitated for a moment. The stunt coordinator at the side was also stunned. <em>What did Master Lin just say?</em></p><br/><p><em>He must be kidding. </em>Even the stunt instructor didn\u2019t believe it. Anyone who hadn\u2019t gone through long years of training wouldn\u2019t be able to execute such a complex stunt.</p><br/><p>Now that Master Lin said that he could do it, how was the stunt coordinator going to believe it?</p><br/><p>Wang Ke Hao sighed. If another person were to do that, he would have scolded that person. However, the person before him was Lin Fan. He said, \u201cMaster Lin, don\u2019t joke with me. Come out now, if something happens to you, I can\u2019t take the blame.\u201d</p><br/><p>That was indeed true. If something were to happen to Master Lin, he wouldn\u2019t even be able to leave Shanghai.</p><br/><p>Master Lin was like a treasure of Shanghai.</p><br/><p>He still remembered how difficult things had been when he had applied for permission to use the road junction of the Welfare Institute.</p><br/><p>It was really close to the Welfare Institute and the film production team had been pretty inexperienced, if something were to happen there, Master Lin would definitely be furious.</p><br/><p>One should not underestimate Master Lin\u2019s relationship with government officials. All the government officials wouldn\u2019t dare to offend Master Lin, given his power and status.</p><br/><p>After all, Master Lin\u2019s influence was boundless and everyone wanted to have a piece of his influence.</p><br/><p>They had heard that a government official had passed an instruction to get rid of dogs and it had eventually spread to Cloud Street. It had almost affected Master Lin\u2019s pet. Although nobody knew who had published it online, the official who passed the law had almost gotten fired for doing that.</p><br/><p>If something were to happen to the Welfare Institute, this would definitely get a lot of people into trouble.</p><br/><p>Therefore, Wang Ke Hao knew the importance of Master Lin in the eyes of many people.</p><br/><p>Perhaps even the richest man in Hong Kong wouldn\u2019t be able to compare to Master Lin. In the end, Shanghai\u2019s leaders would still choose Master Lin without a shadow of a doubt.</p><br/><p>Because their decisions would affect a lot of things in the nation.</p><br/><p>Even if he was the richest man, money could not resolve everything.</p><br/><p>Master Lin\u2019s medical skills were shockingly powerful and he came up with a lot of new medications. Furthermore, he had even won the Nobel Prize. These accolades would crush anyone out there who wanted to challenge him.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at Wang Ke Hao\u2019s expression of disbelief. He said helplessly, \u201cDirector Wang, you look like you\u2019re in disbelief. Do you think I\u2019m kidding?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ke Hao smiled bittersweetly. \u201cMaster Lin, forgive me. If something happens to you, I can\u2019t handle the consequences.\u201d</p><br/><p>*whiz*</p><br/><p>Lin Fan immediately drove off. He wanted to prove himself.</p><br/><p>Wang Ke Hao shouted, \u201cMaster Lin, stop messing around!\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone was shocked when they saw what was happening.</p><br/><p>They were actually witnessing Master Lin executing stunts.</p><br/><p>He started to do complicated car stunts and everyone was dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>Wang Ke Hao looked at the stunt instructor. \u201cWill this suffice?\u201d</p><br/><p>The stunt instructor was stunned. If he hadn\u2019t witnessed it with his own eyes, he wouldn\u2019t have believed Master Lin was the one behind the wheels.</p><br/><p>\u201cDirector Wang, Master Lin is performing extremely difficult moves. Although a lot of people can do it, literally nobody can do it as well as him,\u201d the stunt instructor said.</p><br/><p>Then, Lin Fan reversed his car back to where he had started. He smiled. \u201cDirector Wang, do you think that\u2019s good enough?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ke Hao looked at Master Lin in shock. Then, he recovered from his daze and nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, yes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. \u201cI told you that I\u2019m an experienced driver. You didn\u2019t believe me.\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

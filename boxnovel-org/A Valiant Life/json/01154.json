They were all saying that being able to run their businesses on the same street as Little Boss and being able to have such a good relationship with Little Boss was really a fortunate thing. Moreover, they felt very proud of it.</p><br/><p>In the shop.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan poured two cups of tea for them. She placed the tea there and didn\u2019t stay any longer. She left Brother Lin and that research department person to talk.</p><br/><p>During the entire duration, Lin Fan was talking while Zhou Hai listened attentively. Once in a while, he would ask some questions.</p><br/><p>These questions were all related to the technologies used in the artificial limbs. Even though they studied these things, they couldn\u2019t quite understand all of it sometimes.</p><br/><p>Moreover, they were flabbergasted by the amount of knowledge encompassed in each small set of an artificial limb. They really wanted to know the theory behind those artificial limbs.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo that\u2019s it! I understand it now,\u201d Zhou Hai exclaimed in awe.</p><br/><p>He had not expected Master Lin to have such a deep understanding of artificial limbs.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan had been imbued with the knowledge from the Encyclopedia. Everything was inside his mind. Naturally, there was no difficulty in answering Zhou Hai\u2019s questions.</p><br/><p>He was also very glad to explain some of the topics brought up by Zhou Hai.</p><br/><p>The two of them carried on conversing. The tea that was placed in front of Zhou Hai wasn\u2019t even touched. He remained focused the whole time as if he was afraid that he might miss any detail.</p><br/><p>At the same time, he was nodding non-stop. It was as if he was astonished by Master Lin\u2019s knowledge and he was expressing his respect.</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang listened from the side for a while but he couldn\u2019t really understand, so he went to Fraud Tian\u2019s side. \u201cWhat is Brother Lin talking about? I listened for a while but I couldn\u2019t understand at all.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHigh-end stuff,\u201d Fraud Tian just mumbled these two words.</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang was taken aback. \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian looked at him. \u201cSince you can\u2019t understand, it means that this is high-end stuff. Otherwise, why wouldn\u2019t you understand it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang nodded. \u201cThat makes sense. Brother Lin is really scary. I can\u2019t even understand the things he\u2019s saying. But it makes sense. If I could understand these things, I wouldn\u2019t just be a mere broadcaster.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan sat there with her hands under her chin as she gazed at Lin Fan with an expression of admiration. She knew that Brother Lin was really amazing. This was something that she had always known from the start.</p><br/><p>Sometimes, a blinded woman can be very terrifying.</p><br/><p>If one were to ask who Lin Fan\u2019s biggest fan was, the answer would undoubtedly be Wu You Lan.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Zhou Hai had a look of shock on his face as he clapped. \u201cMaster Lin, your explanations are great! So many things that I couldn\u2019t understand in the past have all been made clear through your explanations. It\u2019s like a sudden flash of light and now, everything is clear!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing. Knowledge should be shared and exchanged.\u201d</p><br/><p>Encyclopedic Points +1</p><br/><p>It was clear that Zhou Hai had already understood. But regarding the Encyclopedic points, Lin Fan didn\u2019t care much right now. Still, it was good that he could increase his Encyclopedic Points.</p><br/><p>Those foundational Chinese medicine teaching materials could still bring him a non-stop flow of Encyclopedic Points. It was very rewarding.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Zhou Hai pondered for a while before he said, \u201cMaster Lin, our leader\u2019s intention is to ask if you could become a professor at our Artificial Limb Research Department.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was taken aback. He hadn\u2019t expected Zhou Hai to suddenly throw him such a question. However, he was not quite interested in these things.</p><br/><p>The perfect artificial limbs had already been a success. He had no intentions to carry on researching.</p><br/><p>If he were to become their professor, he would have to spend some effort and time.</p><br/><p>However, just as he was about to reject, Zhou Hai stated a condition that made it impossible for Lin Fan to reject.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, don\u2019t worry. We won\u2019t ask you to come to our place. We just wish to borrow your reputation. After all, the perfect artificial limbs came from your hands. They are sufficient to prove that you are the top specialist in the nation. Even overseas, there is no one better than you. Our research department just wants a share of the spotlight,\u201d said Zhou Hai with a smile. He felt that there was nothing wrong with saying that.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cIf that\u2019s the case, it\u2019s fine. I shan\u2019t reject. Go ahead and use my reputation then. But you have to be mentally prepared. I really don\u2019t have time to go to the research department.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Hai nodded. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about that. We are very understanding. Those perfect artificial limbs that you developed are already sufficient for us to study.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two of them continued chatting and they ended up chatting close to two hours.</p><br/><p>The tea that was placed on the table had already gone cold.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan came over and was about to replace the tea.</p><br/><p>Zhou Hai stood up and waved his hand. \u201cThank you but there\u2019s no need to replace it. I shan\u2019t disturb Master Lin any further. I have to go back to report the outcome of our discussion.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan stood up and shook Zhou Hai\u2019s hand. \u201cThen I shan\u2019t make you stay any longer either.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d Zhou Hai nodded. Then, he said goodbye to the rest of the people in the shop before leaving like the wind.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled as he shook his head. He hadn\u2019t expected to receive yet another title. Right now, he really held a lot of titles.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre we leaving tomorrow?\u201d</p><br/><p>Thinking about going to Haojiang tomorrow, he felt that it wasn\u2019t very meaningful. However, since the rest hadn\u2019t gone there before, bringing them there for a vacation was pretty good.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan nodded. \u201cYup, we\u2019re leaving tomorrow. I\u2019ve already contacted Xue Yao. She will be fetching us tomorrow.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian gasped in shock, \u201cAh! I haven\u2019t packed my luggage!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan glared at him. \u201cWhat were you doing last night?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSigh. What else could I have been doing? I was just chatting.\u201d Fraud Tian held his phone fondly. He had already become a slave to his phone.</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang said in surprise, \u201cFraud, are you still talking to her? Tell me the truth. How many red packets did you send last night?\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian giggled. \u201cI sent a hundred! It\u2019s just a little money. I can afford it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026\u201d Zhao Zhong Yang had no words. The last time he had given Fraud Tian some advice, the two of them had nearly gotten into a fight. He decided to forget about it. <em>This Fraud doesn\u2019t have much savings. If he can bear to spend money on this girl, so be it.</em></p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cFraud, I took a look at your physiognomy. You are very likely to go broke soon. You should be careful.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian said, \u201cThat\u2019s not possible. I read my own fortune. I\u2019m not going broke. I\u2019m going to have lots of luck with the ladies. Alright, alright, I won\u2019t say more to you guys. You won\u2019t understand anyway.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled. <em>If this Fraud doesn\u2019t want to believe me, I have no choice. Since it\u2019s like this, he\u2019ll have to learn it the hard way.</em></p><br/><p><em>When his savings all get taken away, he\u2019ll have no one to blame.</em></p><br/><p>But at that moment, an earth-shattering situation was happening on the Internet.</p><br/><p>News of the perfect artificial limbs had spread outside of the country.</p><br/><p>The Japanese netizens.</p><br/><p>\u201cChina actually developed perfect artificial limbs. This video looks too fake, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, I can\u2019t quite believe it. Can such artificial limbs still be considered as artificial limbs?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI just went to do a search on the Internet. These perfect artificial limbs were developed by that Master Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin? That Master Lin who crushed our nation\u2019s pride in table tennis?\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

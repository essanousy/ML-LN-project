The things in the house were smashed around the place. It was terribly messy. Liang Hong Tian was fuming.</p><br/><p>\u201cAbominable! Absolutely abominable! I\u2019ll never forgive that b*stard!\u201d</p><br/><p>He felt a little ashamed thinking of the events from the night before. As the direct descendant of the Liang family, he was actually beaten by some rubbish!</p><br/><p>Even though he didn\u2019t know how he came back yesterday and whether or not he stumbled home in a daze by himself, but he could clearly see the events of yesterday when he closed his eyes.</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t stand it.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Lin Fan pinched his fingers together and calculated. Wu Ya Ting\u2019s issue hadn\u2019t ended for the time being. It wasn\u2019t to say that it would definitely happen again, but there was still a possibility. To prevent it from happening again, they had to kill the problem at its stem, and in order to do so, they had to draw out all the hatred.</p><br/><p>The big classification of wuxia knowledge had a form of martial arts which was in the aspect of wisdom.</p><br/><p>However, who was Master Lin? He was the existence who upheld justice and punished all evil. Did he have to rely on dishonest practices to counter the other party?</p><br/><p>It was definitely not necessary.</p><br/><p>Regarding the Ma Mu Feng incident, they didn\u2019t have a choice. That person had infuriated too many people and that method was the only way. As for Liang Hong Tian, he felt that it was not worth his effort to handle it in the same way.</p><br/><p>After all, everything was too simple, so much so that it made everything boring.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck! I forgot about something important.\u201d At this moment, Lin Fan slapped his forehead fiercely. When he was talking to Chang Hai Ge yesterday, he had forgotten to tell him that he was going to take part in the Qingtian Bay Race as well.</p><br/><p>He gave him a call.</p><br/><p>\u201cHai Ge, help me register for the Qingtian Bay Race. Oh, and help me prepare a vehicle. I\u2019ll be taking part as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Chang Hai Ge was stunned the moment he heard that Master Lin wanted to join the race as well. This competition was dangerous! However, he didn\u2019t dare to rebut, so he simply agreed.</p><br/><p>The two of them chatted for a while before hanging up.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan organized his thoughts before heading out. Right now, he needed to let out a wave of hatred.</p><br/><p>He had to thoroughly dig out all the hatred.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>At the Liang house.</p><br/><p>Liang Hong Tian was under a lot of stress living in this big household. After all, he wasn\u2019t the only precious son.</p><br/><p>His oldest uncle had two sons and one daughter. It was already pressuring enough.</p><br/><p>His second uncle had three sons and two daughters. It was even more pressuring, so much so that he couldn\u2019t raise his head.</p><br/><p>As for his own father, he only had himself as the only son. His influence was meager. His existence was regarded as the most useless. He only knew how to eat and drink and wait for death to come. Compared to the sons and daughters of his uncles, he was completely useless.</p><br/><p>However, the good thing was that the Liang family was influential and powerful. In Beijing, even though he was personally not of much use, many still wouldn\u2019t dare to mess with them.</p><br/><p>The only thing was, the day before, someone had thoroughly pissed him off.</p><br/><p>When Liang Hong Tian was leaving his home, a man blocked his way. He had an expression of mockery on his face. \u201cHey, Hong Tian! What happened to your face? Why do I feel like you got beaten up by someone?\u201d</p><br/><p>Liang Hong Tian saw that someone had come, hence he momentarily smiled. However, the smile was just a cover-up. \u201cBrother, it\u2019s nothing much. I knocked into something myself.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, how careless. I thought that you were beaten up by someone. Forget it, let\u2019s not talk about it anymore. I still have to go to the corporation. I have to sign a large bill today. You have to work harder! It isn\u2019t a good thing to be lazing and playing around all day.\u201d Liang Jun Fei laughed. There was a hint of disdain in his words.</p><br/><p>\u201cIndeed. You are correct, Brother. I will work harder.\u201d Liang Hong Tian nodded his head. However, when he saw him leave, his initial expression of smiles had an immediate change to one of fury and rage.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow hateful. Boasting in front of my face. The day will come when I\u2019ll be stepping on you.\u201d Liang Hong Tian was unhappy but he currently had no plans in mind. The opposite party was the child of his oldest uncle. He held a high position in his family corporation. He was nothing compared to it.</p><br/><p>However, even though he couldn\u2019t compare to any of his cousins, his father was more impressive as compared to his cousins\u2019 fathers.</p><br/><p>On the car journey.</p><br/><p>The whereabouts of Liang Hong Tian immediately attracted the attention of many.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Liang, you have to come here. Take a look at this vehicle. I am almost done customizing it.\u201d A young man came forward to him, trying to curry his favor.</p><br/><p>Liang Hong Tian nodded his head, \u201cYes, not bad, not bad.\u201d</p><br/><p>At home, he was frequently looked down upon. But when he was outside, he would often be flattered by many. What a great feeling this was.</p><br/><p>\u201cLooking at Brother Liang\u2019s current vehicle, he would definitely come in first place during the Qingtian Bay Race.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liang Hong Tian waved his hand, \u201cWho in the right mind would join the race? They would lose their lives if they aren\u2019t careful. Help me modify it a little better. On that day, I\u2019ll just drive a lap and that\u2019ll be enough.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even though he liked cars, he didn\u2019t like racing cars. Who didn\u2019t know that it was dangerous? A moment of carelessness could cost you your life. He would just let that bunch of crazy people go and play.</p><br/><p>\u201cHi, Young Liang, do you remember me?\u201d At this moment, Lin Fan appeared from the door of the garage.</p><br/><p>Liang Hong Tian saw him and his expression changed immediately, \u201cYou\u2026you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan went in front of him and grabbed his wrist, \u201cStop pointing. Last night, I told you my name. Do you still remember it?\u201d</p><br/><p>How could Liang Hong Tian forget his name? However, he had already been seized by the anger in his heart. Never had he expected that the b*stard from last night to appear in front of him.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, he did it so bravely and openly. He arrived so arrogantly. This was completely looking down on him.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan couldn\u2019t help but shake his head. He sighed, \u201cIt seems like you have forgotten. I can only make you remember.\u201d</p><br/><p>*Slap*</p><br/><p>It was coming again.</p><br/><p>Liang Hong Tian\u2019s head was slapped to the side. His pupil contracted, before getting hit again. He actually dared to hit him again.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>*Slap!*</p><br/><p>A clear and crisp sound came from the garage. The car mechanics were all shocked speechless.</p><br/><p>They never thought that someone would dare to slap Young Liang\u2019s face under the broad daylight. This was as good as digging his own grave!</p><br/><p>\u201cRemember it! My name is Lin Fan. I own a store in Shanghai. Others call me Master Lin. You must develop a hatred for me, a hatred so deep that you want to kill me. Even in your sleep, you would be thinking of ways to kill me.\u201d Lin Fan felt that getting people to hate him wasn\u2019t a simple task. As the saying goes, no matter how good-natured a person is, hitting him multiple times would eventually cause them to lose their patience. He didn\u2019t think that Liang Hong Tian would actually still have the mood to modify his car. How big of a heart must he have?</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Liang Hong Tian shouted, \u201cWhat are you trying to do? I\u2019ll f*cking kill you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking at how furious Liang Hong Tian was, Lin Fan nodded his head in satisfaction, \u201cThat\u2019s right! This is the sort of anger I want to see! Hate me! Despise me! This is what you should be doing!\u201d</p><br/><p>*Slap!*</p><br/><p>*Slap!*</p><br/><p>Another round of attacks from the left and right. Liang Hong Tian was stunned. Even though he wasn\u2019t hitting with much strength, it was still a form of embarrassment.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan stopped. He let go of the other party\u2019s wrist. Liang Hong Tian collapsed on to his car, paralyzed. His eyes were flickering.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll end this for now.\u201d Lin Fan saw that it was about time. He could hold back for now. He\u2019d get another wave of hatred from him when he sees him again. But till then, it should be enough.</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan left, Liang Hong Tian slowly recovered.</p><br/><p>However, his listening was sharp and he heard the surrounding people whispering.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck! Young Liang got slapped by that guy so many times, then he just took his leave as if nothing happened.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho would believe it if they didn\u2019t see it for themselves. This is just too terrifying.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019d never have thought that Young Liang would get slapped. It\u2019s an uncommon sight.\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, Liang Hong Tian\u2019s face turned both green and white. It was an ugly scene to behold. He stared at the crowd before walking away.</p><br/><p>On the other hand, the crowd was so scared that they didn\u2019t dare to say one more word. Only after Liang Hong Tian left, did they heave a sigh of relief.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Is something good going to happen?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang asked curiously after seeing the smile on Brother Lin\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled and shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t know yet, but Secretary Chen just told me that it\u2019s something good without telling me any details.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang tried to guess, but he could not think of anything. \u201cBrother Lin, could it be something out of this world?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cHmm, maybe? I\u2019m not sure yet.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan was curious too, but she did not ask him about it. However, she felt that something crazy was going to happen.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian also thought about it, but he could not think of anything either.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan did not want to think about this matter anymore, so he unlocked his phone and read the news. Then, he realised that some of the headlines seemed weird. It seemed that someone had been posting about the news of other countries.</p><br/><p>This time, the fact that he eradicated AIDS shook the nation, but the impact on the rest of the world was not small either.</p><br/><p>Some foreigners even thought that Lin Fan was a god. After all, he saved them from AIDS.</p><br/><p>Some celebrities tried so hard just to go viral, but Lin Fan just kept it simple. He eradicated anorexia, leukemia, and now AIDS, which instantly made him well-known by everyone.</p><br/><p>Perhaps terminal illnesses these days would not be of any problem now. Meanwhile, minor illnesses could be treated easily with the help of some medication.</p><br/><p>At the same time, Chinese medicine was being widely explored by foreigners.</p><br/><p>According to the information provided by Zhao Ming Qing, some foreign medical schools started to contact the Chinese Medical Academy to collaborate with them. They wanted to learn more about Chinese medicine.</p><br/><p>It was initially an impossible task since people did not really treat Chinese medical academies seriously. However, ever since Master Lin conquered so many diseases, many foreign medical schools wanted to find out more about it.</p><br/><p>The Chinese Medical Academy instantly became popular.</p><br/><p>Previously, some of the students of the Chinese Medical Academy were ashamed of themselves when they were asked about it. However, now they would proudly state the name of their school.</p><br/><p>At Shanghai Chinese Medical Academy.</p><br/><p>Director: Zhao Ming Qing.</p><br/><p>They had conquered many illnesses in the research labs of their school.</p><br/><p>Those students who had dropped out of Chinese medical academies were regretful of their decisions as they could not enroll themselves again.</p><br/><p>After a few days.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was sitting in his shop when a loud scream could be heard.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Lin, quick, look at the news! It\u2019s crazy!\u201d Zhao Zhong Yang shouted.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>He felt that something was wrong. He wondered why Zhao Zhong Yang had screamed. However, he looked really excited and he felt that something great must have happened.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian looked over and he was dumbfounded after reading the content on the screen.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh my, it\u2019s crazy!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan stood up and walked towards Zhao Zhong Yang. \u201cWhat is it? Why is everyone screaming? Let me see.\u201d</p><br/><p>When he looked at the screen, he was stunned too.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey\u2019re giving me a prize?\u201d Lin Fan asked after reading the content on the screen.</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang replied, \u201cYeah! It\u2019s the country giving you the prize. Although we don\u2019t know the situation yet, I believe the entire Internet already knows about this since it\u2019s been reported.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian added, \u201cImpressive, you\u2019re too good. You\u2019re going to be powerful! I think Cloud Street is going to blow up even more.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha,\u201d Lin Fan chuckled. \u201cNice, it\u2019s really nice. I love getting prizes. I guess this wall will be filled with prizes in the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>The crowd did not want to say anything after hearing what he said. They did not expect Master Lin to say that at all. It was as if he was collecting prizes for fun.</p><br/><p>When the news was published online, all the netizens went wild.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh my, is Master Lin really going to receive an award?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s going to be awarded by the nation at the most grand place. It\u2019s going to be crazy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLooks like what Master Lin did is finally being recognised. I told you, Master Lin is so powerful. He deserves these awards. They\u2019re finally here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph, I don\u2019t even know what this man did. Why should we give him this? There are a lot of people out there who sacrificed a lot and they didn\u2019t even get recognised. I think it\u2019s corruption.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c^ Bro, I think you must be stupid.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, everyone knows what Master Lin did. He deserves this prize. At the same time, he even promoted one of our national treasures. Chinese Medicine is very popular in other countries now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, I own a Chinese medical hall in another country. In the past, nobody bought anything. However, a lot of people are buying it now and the queues are crazy. I don\u2019t even have enough medicine to sell.\u201d</p><br/><p>Some celebrities and internet stars also came forward to congratulate Master Lin.</p><br/><p>They felt that Master Lin was really powerful, and he finally received recognition from everyone. It was something that they could never achieve in their lives.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was thinking about the prize as he was curious about what it was.</p><br/><p>Just as he was thinking about it, a call came.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang said, \u201cBro, congrats! I just saw the news. It\u2019s going to be mad this time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cHaha, I gotta stay low-key. It\u2019s nothing much, just a normal prize.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang replied, \u201cNormal? It\u2019s going to be crazy. You should see where they\u2019re having the event at and the person that\u2019s awarding it to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t see it. Who is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang added, \u201cBro, it\u2019s literally held there. Who do you think it is?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWoah, are you implying that it\u2019s him\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd?\u201d Lin Fan was stunned. He was ecstatic. It was a feeling that he never experienced before.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang did not realise that Lin Fan was just pretending. He said enviously, \u201cOf course. It\u2019s something that everyone dreams about. I didn\u2019t expect you to achieve it. You\u2019re going to be famous!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHAHAHA.\u201d</p><br/><p>They chatted for a while longer before hanging up.</p><br/><p>He understood why Wang Ming Yang was so happy about it.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

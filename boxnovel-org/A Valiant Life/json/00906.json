He felt that it was only right for them to not interfere in his affairs. After all, they should just pretend to not know each other.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-1\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Then, he opened up Weibo and typed a few words with an emoji to express his thoughts.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow frustrating.\u201d</p><br/><p>The netizens immediately commented on it.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was really popular, so much so that even the problems of some celebrities weren\u2019t as highly regarded as his. Even if he didn\u2019t do anything special, he was just so incomparably popular.</p><br/><p>\u201c666\u2026 It must be a big problem to make Master Lin feel frustrated.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, please stop playing.

Quick, find a cure for heart diseases.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Lin Fan felt really helpless after reading the comments. His fans were starting to become mischievous. Initially, he had been pretty angry at them but his anger slowly turned into amusement.</p><br/><p>It seemed that the netizens wanted him to conquer a lot of diseases ever since he had found a cure for leukemia.</p><br/><p>He quickly opened up Weibo to reply to the comments.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you think I\u2019m a God\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>Although Lin Fan was joking, he really felt that it was possible. He felt that if he were to work harder, it was something that was possible to achieve.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-3\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>However, he wanted to take it slow.</p><br/><p>He felt that it wasn\u2019t good to rush things and go overboard.</p><br/><p>In the afternoon.</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan was resting, an elderly man appeared at the shop.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>His tone sounded as if he was there to ask for a favor.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian and the others stared at him with disdain. They felt that he looked really despicable.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan raised his head. \u201cYou are\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>He Jun smiled. \u201cMaster Lin, I\u2019m the one that spoke to you on the phone just now. I am He Jun from the Health Department. Listen to me. Regarding that matter, are you really going to ignore our\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWait, stop talking. I don\u2019t want to listen to you. Let me ask you this, what exactly do you want?\u201d Lin Fan asked.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-4\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Lin Fan hadn\u2019t expected this fella to really appear at his doorstep. He obviously wasn\u2019t afraid of being struck to death by Master Lin.</p><br/><p>He Jun continued, \u201cMaster Lin, I am here to show my sincerity. We have thought about our actions. With regards to Zhao Ming Qing, we will withdraw the actions against him. We hope that he will continue to be the Director of Shanghai First Chinese Medical Academy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan raised his hand. \u201cWait, you\u2019re wrong. It wasn\u2019t because of you. My student resigned.\u201d</p><br/><p>He Jun was furious. He felt that he had lost all his face by coming down to look for Master Lin. However, he had to resolve this issue. If not, it would definitely affect him.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, yes. Zhao Ming Qing resigned. It wasn\u2019t because of us\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at him. \u201cI think you must have something against me.\u201d</p><br/><p>He Jun was stunned and he quickly waved his hand. \u201cHow could it be? Master Lin, you\u2019ve done a great deed. Why would I have something against you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan raised his hand. \u201cLet me ask you, what\u2019s the name of my shop?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin\u2019.\u201d He Jun was confused. He wondered what Master Lin was thinking. \u201cSince you know that, you should know what I can do. Do you think I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re thinking? I\u2019ll give you some time to change your attitude before coming to talk to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>He wasn\u2019t going to be fooled that easily. Initially, he didn\u2019t want to speak to He Jun at all. However, now that he had looked for him at his shop, Lin Fan wanted to mess with him.</p><br/><p>Since he had appeared at his shop, his bosses must have asked him to do so. Only he could become the scapegoat for this problem. However, Lin Fan had to try to minimize the risks of the problem first. If not, He Jun would probably think that Lin Fan was a pushover.</p><br/><p>He Jun was furious. This Master Lin was going overboard. He Jun was a member with authority and he had actually come to look for him to discuss matters. Lin Fan didn\u2019t even respect him and even reprimanded him as if he was his boss.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-5\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>How could he deal with such a disrespectful act?</p><br/><p>Furthermore, he was even old enough to be Lin Fan\u2019s dad.</p><br/><p>Of course, He Jun was just thinking about that. After all, he wasn\u2019t as powerful as Lin Fan and he couldn\u2019t do anything about it.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan drank his tea and looked at He Jun.</p><br/><p>Initially, he had wanted to visit the welfare institute in the afternoon. Now that this fella was here, he could use him to kill some time.</p><br/><p>He Jun looked at the motionless Lin Fan who looked as if he was trying to waste his time. However, he didn\u2019t believe that Lin Fan could tell what he was thinking about.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow is it? Have you decided to change your attitude?\u201d Lin Fan asked.</p><br/><p>He Jun immediately nodded. \u201cMaster Lin, I have decided to change.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shook his head. \u201cI think it\u2019s not done yet. You can stand for half an hour first. Of course, you can choose to leave immediately. I won\u2019t stop you.\u201d</p><br/><p>After hearing that, He Jun was infuriated. <em>Who the f*ck do you think you are? </em></p><div class=\"code-block code-block-6\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Of course, he didn\u2019t dare to say that.</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang looked at Brother Lin in awe. He had just searched up He Jun\u2019s identity and found out that he was a Director.</p><br/><p>Now that he was being silenced by Master Lin, it was simply amazing.</p><br/><p>Elder Liang, one of the shop owners, came to the shop with some melon seeds.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Boss, I\u2019m here to disturb you for a moment,\u201d Elder Liang said as he gave the packet of melon seeds to Lin Fan. Then, he looked at He Jun. \u201cHey, who is this fella?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan held onto them and said, \u201cA powerful figure\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He Jun felt as if his face just got slapped a few times after he heard him say that.</p><br/><p>He was indeed a powerful figure but since when did powerful figures like him get treated like this?</p><br/><p>Elder Liang was stunned. \u201cLittle Boss, why is he standing at the door? Haven\u2019t you asked him in?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan spat a melon seed into the dustbin and glared at He Jun. \u201cLet him stand for half an hour to change his attitude.\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-7\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cOh!\u201d Elder Liang said excitedly. He rested arm on the cabinet and ate his melon seeds while looking at them as if He Jun was a monkey performing.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy does it feel like me punishing my son by making him stand at the door?\u201d</p><br/><p>Although that was pretty apt, it was really blunt.</p><br/><p>He Jun became even more infuriated.</p><br/><p>Elder Liang added, \u201cWhy is he standing at the entrance?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. \u201cPeople who want to survive in the society should recognize their mistakes and take the punishment they deserve. Isn\u2019t he just realizing his mistake?\u201d</p><br/><p>He Jun started breathing heavily in anger. In the end, he decided to tolerate it for the sake of his career.</p><br/><p>Elder Liang smiled and felt that Master Lin\u2019s shop was really lively. Although weird things always happened there, the people that lived around that area always found their lives to be interesting.</p></div>\n</div>"}

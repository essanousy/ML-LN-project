This kind of thing had never happened before. And there had never been a recipient who had felt that he shouldn\u2019t receive the award.</p><br/><p>However, this incident had really happened and it shocked everyone. They didn\u2019t dare to believe it.</p><br/><p>The Nobel Foundation Chairman was stupefied as well. He didn\u2019t even know what to say. Since the establishment of the award until then, there had never been an incident like this.</p><br/><p>Hall felt that he had done what he was supposed to do.</p><br/><p>Perhaps God had known that he would receive the award and that was why he had encountered that mystical Chinese medicine prescription. From that encounter, he had found out that, amongst his fellow Nobel Prize nominees, there was a Chinese medicine master from China.</p><br/><p>Perhaps this had all been arranged by the heavens.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-2\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Hence, Hall had felt that he had a need to explain everything.</p><br/><p>Hall slowly walked down the stage. Everyone\u2019s gazes were fixed on Hall.</p><br/><p>Uproar!</p><br/><p>After the momentary silence, a series of shocked gasps erupted.</p><br/><p>There were people who didn\u2019t dare to believe it as well as people who felt that Hall had gone mad.</p><br/><p>Conquering leukemia?</p><br/><p>How could they not have known if something like that had happened?</p><br/><p>Then, some people started searching the stage to identify that Chinese medicine master from China. However, regretfully, there was no Chinese medicine master to be seen.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-3\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cHall, you\u2019ve gone mad,\u201d when Hall returned to his seat, the scientist next to him cried out in disbelief.</p><br/><p>\u201cBuddy, I haven\u2019t gone mad. I was only saying the truth. When compared to the cure for leukemia, my research findings are not even worth mentioning. This is a breakthrough that has brought fortune to everyone. If someone is to get the award, it should only be him,\u201d said Hall.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The scientist didn\u2019t know what to say. This had really happened too suddenly. He wasn\u2019t even able to respond in time.</p><br/><p>China.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn. I respect this old man for being a real man.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think that this scientist\u2019s attitude would be so good. He was clearly the award recipient but he decided to say the truth in the end.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPerhaps he did this in order to gain Master Lin\u2019s favor.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no way not to respect that guy who brought the prescription overseas. He has indirectly helped Master Lin greatly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha. Chinese medicine has finally reached the international stage. Of course, I\u2019m only talking about Master Lin. We can forget about the rest.\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-4\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cBut there\u2019s still Master Lin\u2019s disciple, Director Zhao Ming Qing. He\u2019s also an old Chinese doctor with high moral standing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen how will this situation be resolved now? Will they really change the decision and present the award again?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho knows?\u201d</p><br/><p>Japan!</p><br/><p>The netizens were stunned as they watched the broadcast.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Leukemia can be cured?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s unbelievable. If it wasn\u2019t a scientist that said it, I wouldn\u2019t believe it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen a news article about this from China but I didn\u2019t pay much attention to it before. I thought that it was a made-up story. But I didn\u2019t think that it would actually be true.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe this. Chinese medicine can cure leukemia? That must be today\u2019s biggest joke.\u201d</p><br/><p>America!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is Hall doing? The prize has already been presented to him but he gave it to a Chinese man?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cConquered leukemia? My God, I really don\u2019t believe it.\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-5\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cIf what Hall said is true, I support him. He\u2019s doing the right thing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is going on with the Nobel Prize Judging Committee? If it\u2019s really as Hall said, then that Chinese medicine master from China should have received the award.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe conquered leukemia? Is that for real? I have a friend who\u2019s suffering from leukemia. Where should I buy the medicine for him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGo to Chinatown and find a Chinese medicine shop. They should know.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was a little dazed. He hadn\u2019t expected that things would end up like this. That old man had actually brought him up.</p><br/><p>Elder Liang said excitedly, \u201cLook! Even the recipient said it. The award should be given to Master Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang said, \u201cBut what are they going to do now? Can they change the award winner after presenting it halfway like this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Chen said, \u201cThey should just change it. What\u2019s there to it? They were the ones who made a mistake. If they just change it, it\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-6\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>When Lin Fan heard what they said, he was momentarily lost for words. Then, he continued watching the broadcast, wondering what would happen.</p><br/><p>On-site!</p><br/><p>The Nobel Foundation seemed to not have expected this situation as well.</p><br/><p>The King of Sweden sat there, discussing softly with the people beside him.</p><br/><p>The Foundation Chairman had a blank look on his face. Then, he hurried on stage and said, \u201cEveryone, please quieten down.\u201d Afterward, he glared angrily at Hall as is to say \u2018Brother, you\u2019re really awesome. Now that you\u2019ve opened up this can of worms, how are we going to clean it up?\u201d</p><br/><p>But Hall wasn\u2019t bothered at all. He had only said what he was supposed to say.</p><br/><p>Right now, this was being broadcasted live. If they didn\u2019t handle it well, it would affect the Nobel Foundation greatly.</p><br/><p>\u201cRight now, let us, the Nobel Foundation, explain the situation. We have seriously discussed the research findings of Lin Fan from China. However, as we analyzed the theory behind his research, we were completely unable to find any legitimate theories. Therefore\u2026\u201d the Foundation Chairman started to explain.</p><br/><p>However, he was saying the truth. Back then, when he had found out that leukemia had been cured, he hadn\u2019t believed it. Later on, after research, he realized that they weren\u2019t able to analyze the theory behind the cure. Also, they didn\u2019t have a deep understanding of the medicine\u2019s effect.</p><br/><p>However, the anorexia cure had been verified and it was indeed effective.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-7\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>In the end, after considering many factors, they only put Lin Fan into the nominee list but didn\u2019t give him the award.</p><br/><p>Now that the award recipient, Hall, had spoken, saying that he felt that he shouldn\u2019t receive the award, it had put them in an awkward situation.</p><br/><p>This was a live broadcast. Such an impromptu explanation was very awkward. But not explaining it wasn\u2019t possible either.</p><br/><p>The other scientists still couldn\u2019t understand the situation at the moment but they had etched this into their memories.</p><br/><p>The Chinese medicine master who had developed a prescription for leukemia. When they went back, they had to look him up.</p><br/><p>The Foundation Chairman said, \u201cChinese medicine master, Lin Fan, should be here right now. Could I please invite you on stage to give an explanation of the theory behind your findings? If it can be explained, then it is indeed a mistake on the Nobel Foundation\u2019s part. We are willing to bear the blame and reflect on our mistake.\u201d</p><br/><p>When he said this, everyone there started looking around, searching for that Chinese medicine master from China.</p><br/><p>\u201cCould I please invite Lin Fan on stage?\u201d the Foundation Chairman repeated. No one answered.</p><br/><p>The place entered an awkward silence.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, when the Chinese netizens saw this scene, they burst out laughing.</p><br/><p>\u201cGo on stage my a*s! He\u2019s not even there, how will he go on stage?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin is still at Cloud Street! He\u2019s f*cking thousands of miles away. Even if he flies there, he won\u2019t make it.\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-8\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cThis is awkward and painful to watch. This event isn\u2019t very well organized.\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

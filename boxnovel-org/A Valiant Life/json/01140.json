This makes me a little excited.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the equipment all around as well as the materials and was a little moved. He really didn\u2019t understand all these but the knowledge in his mind was no joke.</p><br/><p>Developing those things was not a problem at all. And they would even be much more impressive than those artificial limbs that currently existed.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, let\u2019s get to work. High-tech goods will soon be produced by my hands.\u201d</p><br/><p>Outside!</p><br/><p>The secretary was a little doubtful. \u201cChief Wang, do you think that Master Lin will really be able to develop them?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang smiled. \u201cWho knows? Of course, it\u2019d be good if he does but if he isn\u2019t able to, it wouldn\u2019t be a problem either. In the future, I would have something to ridicule him about.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d The secretary\u2019s mouth gaped. She really couldn\u2019t understand rich people. <em>So much has been spent. Isn\u2019t he worried about the outcome of the production?</em></p><br/><p>Sometimes, the employees would gossip amongst themselves. <em>What kind of relationship does Chief Wang and Master Lin share exactly? Could it be \u2018that\u2019 kind of relationship?</em></p><br/><p>But they would stop their gossiping there because it simply wasn\u2019t possible. It was the kind of situation that would only happen in legends.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang took a last glance before shutting the door. Then, he left with a smile.</p><br/><p>He was no longer responsible for what was left. It was his brother\u2019s responsibility now. He wouldn\u2019t be able to help anyway.</p><br/><p>On the Internet.</p><br/><p>Many netizens were discussing. After so many days, Master Lin had posted on Weibo again. He had even said that the research lab had been prepared and he was going to start developing the perfect artificial limbs.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t even know what to say anymore. It looks like Master Lin won\u2019t rest until he dies.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThings had already quietened down but Master Lin has stirred things up again.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cActually, I still believe in Master Lin. The research lab has already been prepared anyway, so let\u2019s just wait and see. He might really be able to succeed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you really still believe that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI do. I\u2019ve been following Master Lin\u2019s Weibo from the start until now. There have been many things that people thought were not possible but still happened because of Master Lin\u2019s mysticality. That\u2019s why I believe him.\u201d</p><br/><p>The netizens who had been following Lin Fan all along chose to believe him and some of them were even in eager anticipation, wondering what exactly Master Lin would produce.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, some artificial limb specialists looked at him with tremendous disdain. <em>What a show-off. He has no idea what he\u2019s doing.</em></p><br/><p>They didn\u2019t even want to scold Lin Fan anymore. They felt that it was simply a waste of time.</p><br/><p>At a certain artificial limb company.</p><br/><p>This company specialized in producing artificial limbs. Some of the workers in the production department were discussing amongst themselves.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you see the news on Weibo?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat news?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m talking about that news on Weibo. Master Lin wants to develop perfect artificial limbs.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCheh. Do you believe that nonsense?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShhh. Our team leader is coming.\u201d</p><br/><p>This matter had gained a lot of attention on the Internet. Countless people were discussing it.</p><br/><p>To them, Master Lin had really gone mad. It made everyone dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, after Master Lin posted this, he disappeared. Why isn\u2019t he giving any updates? The best thing he could do is to do a broadcast.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you stupid? Master Lin is already immersed in the development. How could he have time to care about all this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf he broadcasts it, wouldn\u2019t it affect the development? Just wait and see.\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment. Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan was filled with anxiety. \u201cDo you think Brother Lin will succeed?\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian was sitting at the entrance, smoking a cigarette as he said calmly, \u201cHe will.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zha Zhong Yang was taken aback. \u201cFraud, how are you so sure?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe,\u201d Fraud Tian chuckled. \u201cTell me then. Have you ever seen him fail at anything?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have a point.\u201d Zhao Zhong Yang thought about it and felt that it was true. It seemed that there really wasn\u2019t anything that Brother Lin couldn\u2019t do.</p><br/><p>In the research lab.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was busy working. If there was anyone else there, they would be completely astounded because the way he was working made it seem way too easy.</p><br/><p>He trusted the knowledge in the Encyclopedia. What he was making was different from the products made outside. And the price wouldn\u2019t be high either, just a few thousand dollars for a perfect artificial limb.</p><br/><p>The next day!</p><br/><p>A full day and night passed.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang came to the company and pulled the secretary over. \u201cHas Master Lin come out yet?\u201d</p><br/><p>The secretary shook her head. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t. Master Lin hasn\u2019t come out since he entered.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about food?\u201d Wang Ming Yang asked. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me you didn\u2019t even give him any food.\u201d</p><br/><p>The secretary said, \u201cI brought some food up but when I knocked on the door, there was no response, so I left it outside.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, my brother is defying nature. Go on with your work. I\u2019ll go up to take a look at the situation.\u201d Wang Ming Yang couldn\u2019t quite understand what his brother was doing. Even if he was addicted to working, he had to come out for a meal and some fresh air.</p><br/><p>But when Wang Ming Yang reached the top floor, he saw the food outside the door.</p><br/><p>\u201cSigh, is he trying to become immortal?\u201d Wang Ming Yang felt helpless. Then, he entered the passcode.</p><br/><p>But when he entered, he noticed a figure that was busy typing nonstop on the keyboard.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you\u2026\u201d Wang Ming Yang had just opened his mouth when he noticed those artificial limbs placed in front and he was completely stunned. It was as if he had seen a ghost.</p><br/><p>*Creak!*</p><br/><p>*Creak!*</p><br/><p>Those artificial limbs were moving automatically without anything manipulating them.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did you come in for? Hurry up and get out. I\u2019m not done yet.\u201d Lin Fan became annoyed when he saw Wang Ming Yang. Then, he waved his hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026I\u2026\u201d Wang Ming Yang was about to say something but then he was pushed out by Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck. At least eat the food!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang yelled as he stood there. But in front of him was a door.</p><br/><p>Then, his mind was filled with what he had just seen and his face was covered with excitement.</p><br/><p>\u201cCould it really be? Has it really been developed?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut that was too quick, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><br/><p>What he didn\u2019t know was that Lin Fan hadn\u2019t been developing it at all. It had already been developed in his mind. He had simply manufactured it.</p><br/><p>Another day passed.</p><br/><p>The netizens realized that Master Lin still hadn\u2019t appeared.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, the people who queued for scallion pancakes had found out that Little Boss had gone to develop artificial limbs as well and he wouldn\u2019t be around temporarily. They were dumbfounded by that news.</p><br/><p>\u201cLatest update. Little Boss still isn\u2019t at Cloud Street. It looks like he has really gone to develop artificial limbs. If you ask me, I\u2019m afraid this is going to take quite some time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Some people took photographs of the shop and posted them on Weibo.</p><br/><p>Eastern Han Organization.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang led a few big men and they were carrying a crippled little girl from Nanshan Children\u2019s Welfare Institute. At the same time, they had brought along a wheelchair.</p><br/><p>This was what Lin Fan had requested through a call the previous day. It seemed that he wanted to initiate an experiment. If it succeeds, it would mean that the development had succeeded.</p><br/><p>However, what Wang Ming Yang couldn\u2019t figure out was\u2026</p><br/><p>How was it so f*cking fast?</p></div>\n</div>"}

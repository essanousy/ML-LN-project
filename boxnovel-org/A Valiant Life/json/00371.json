Dealing with this kind of people really did not require that much trouble. All they had to do was to just chase them away and that was it.</p><br/><p>He Cheng Han said, \"Master Lin, let me handle this. If she wishes to touch you, I won't allow it.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shrugged his shoulders, feeling a little helpless.</p><br/><p>Zhang Hui looked at He Cheng Han and said, \"Aren't you just a toy maker? What kind of ability do you even have? I definitely won't back down from today's issue so if you dare to slap me, I'll definitely cause a lot of trouble for you.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan glanced at Zhang Hui and replied, \"I really have no interest in dealing with you and right now, I also don't have the time to entertain you, so tell me what you want.\"</p><br/><p>Jin Yang smirked and said, \"Are you scared now? Where has the bravado that you had earlier gone? Didn't you want to keep on arguing? I wanted to see how able you were.\"</p><br/><p>Zhang Hui looked at Lin Fan. She had never seen anyone like this, to have the nerve to hit her. But if she did not teach him a lesson, she was afraid he would not know truly know who she, Zhang Hui, was.</p><br/><p>\"It's very simple. Just kneel down and apologize and then slap yourself ten times,\" Zhang Hui calmly said.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan heard it and was momentarily stunned, then he laughed and said, \"Are you retarded? I can't believe you can even say this kind of request. Alright, you can just stand here and wait, we don't have time to stay here and waste with you.\"</p><br/><p>\"Chief He, you guys should go in first,\" Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>He Cheng Han nodded and said, \"We should not take this issue to heart.\"</p><br/><p>Jin Yang saw the two of them leaving and said, \"Sister Zhang, are you just going to let them leave like that?\"</p><br/><p>Zhang Hui sneered, \"Leave? Do you think that's it? Just wait until my people come. I want to see if they can still be as calm as just now.\"</p><br/><p>\"Who is that Chief He? Seems like he recognizes you,\" Jin Yang said.</p><br/><p>Zhang Hui did not really care about He Cheng Han. \"He's just a toy maker. Sure he has a little bit of money but in Shanghai, that's not the most important thing, connections are. But I won't make things easy for him. He likes to be in the limelight, so I'll let him see the consequences of being in the limelight. I'm sure there are some people who will be able to restore my image.\"</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, inside the building, Lin Fan gave He Cheng Han a pat on the back and said, \"Don't tell them about what happened. There isn't a need to.\"</p><br/><p>He Cheng Han nodded and replied, \"Got it.\"</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang shouted, \"What were you two doing? Staying out there for so long.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled and said, \"We went out for a smoke and then something happened.\"</p><br/><p>\"What happened?\" Wang Ming Yang curiously asked.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed and said, \"You'll find out soon.\"</p><br/><p>Li Hao was standing at the side, laughing. \"Today's activities were not bad and also, it goes without saying that Lin Fan's cooking is amazing. No contest, best in the world.\"</p><br/><p>This time's activity had a lot more people involved than the previous one and they had brought a lot of toys for the children. The activity as a whole definitely increased the happiness of the children.</p><br/><p>\"Uncle\u2026 thanks for frequently coming to visit us,\" a young boy who was as sitting in a wheelchair said as he moved towards Lin Fan with a smile on his face.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan patted the boy on the head and smiled. \"No need to thank me.\" Afterward, he looked at the boy's legs. They were still there but had been badly injured and he was unable to walk. Lin Fan felt that those legs were not unhealable but it would definitely need some time.</p><br/><p>\"Ming Yang, follow me to find Director Huang. I need to tell her something,\" Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang nodded and said, \"Sure, not a problem.\"</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Director Huang was on the other side of the room. She looked on as all the children were so full of joy and she also started to smile. This was something pretty rarely seen, so she was very grateful to Lin Fan and his gang.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \"Director Huang, do you have a moment? I need to discuss something with you.\"</p><br/><p>Director Huang nodded her head and then followed Lin Fan and the rest to the nearby office.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang took out a folder and said, \"Director Huang, this Nanshan Children's Welfare Institute has been handed over to us already. From now on, Master Lin will be in charge.\"</p><br/><p>Director Huang nodded and said, \"I've received the notice already. I hope that you all still have a role for me. I've been here for decades already and I can't bear to leave this place.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled and said, \"You can rest assured, Director Huang. I've seen everything that you've done for these children and I have a lot of faith in you. From now on, I'll ensure, to the best of my abilities, that every child here lives a happy life.\"</p><br/><p>Director Huang nodded and replied, \"Master Lin, I feel very relieved to hear you say that. These children are very pitiful and since I've never had any children of my own, they are like family to me.\"</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>Outside Nanshan Children's Welfare Institute, a black sports car arrived in a hurry. From the car, a plump-sized middle-aged man wearing a Buddhist necklace came out. The man had a very sharp and focused look in his eyes as he scanned the surroundings. Then, with a call from his little brother, walked towards the institute.</p><br/><p>Zhang Hui saw the man coming and instantly smiled. \"Brother Si\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Zhao Si was one of the people living in Shanghai and he had had some property dealings with Zhang Hui and her group. Whenever Zhang Hui and her group ran into some problems and situations she couldn't deal with, she would call Zhao Si.</p><br/><p>Also, Zhao Si had opened a debt company here in Shanghai. They were more commonly known as loan sharks.</p><br/><p>\"Chief Zhang, what's going on? Did something happen?\" Zhao Si went up to Zhang Hui to ask.</p><br/><p>Jin Yang was also part of their circle, so he definitely recognized Zhao Si. He greeted him, \"Uncle Si.\"</p><br/><p>Zhao Si nodded. He did not really respect Jin Yang as much as, in his eyes, he was just a small kid.</p><br/><p>Zhang Hui told Zhao Si about everything that had happened and he was very shocked when he heard it. Then, he laughed. \"Chief Zhang, this issue is really just a small one. I thought that it was something major. Isn't it just a young man? You should have been more clear on the phone, then I would have just asked some of my subordinates to go and we would have gotten him to kneel and apologize. You gave me the wrong impression and I came here from far away. Isn't that a little pointless?\"</p><br/><p>Zhang Hui smiled and said, \"Brother Si, this situation really requires you to be here. Recently, I've found a few decent younglings to recruit, how about we go see and them later?\"</p><br/><p>Zhao Si laughed and raised up his hand. \"I understand, I understand. I will handle this situation, I guarantee I'll handle it well. Now, where is the guy?\"</p><br/><p>Zhang Hui pointed in front and said, \"Inside there.\"</p><br/><p>Zhao Si nodded and replied, \"Okay, let's go see what kind of divine force he possesses to have the balls to offend Chief Zhang. This is definitely a situation only I can handle. If it were a business issue, I'd be powerless.\"</p><br/><p>Zhao Si fully understood the situation. He had a beneficial relationship with Zhang Hui as he had helped her deal with many situations that looked bleak especially since the entertainment industry had some dark moments. When it came to these dark moments, only he could handle it.</p><br/><p>*Bam!*</p><br/><p>Zhao Si had yet to do anything when one of his underlings kicked the door open.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, all the people inside came to a silence.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan cluelessly looked at the door with no idea what was going on.</p><br/><p>One of the gang members shouted, \"The person who offended Chief Zhang just now, step out now.\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

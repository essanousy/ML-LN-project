Nothing good ever happens at this hour.</p><br/><p>Could it be that he came off as too elegant and dashing after beating the forty-five thugs just now, which caused Yun Xue Yao to fall for him and wanted to give herself to him?</p><br/><p>Although it was just his imagination, it seemed like a very viable possibility at that moment.</p><br/><p>Dammit, if I knew it was going down like this, I would have left earlier.</p><br/><p>Knock knock!</p><br/><p>There came another knock on the door.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Lin, are you awake?\u201d Yun Xue Yao\u2019s voice started becoming a little more rushed, as if she couldn\u2019t wait for something.</p><br/><p>Inside the room.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan didn\u2019t know what to do as he looked left and right for something.</p><br/><p>Dammit, there aren\u2019t any condoms around. If anything were to happen and if she were to get pregnant, it would be a disaster.</p><br/><p>Saying \u2018no\u2019 was also another way out of this situation.</p><br/><p>However, this would cause me to appear like a weakling. If she were too direct, I also won\u2019t be able to reject her advances. Forget it, I\u2019ll just open the door.</p><br/><p>Taking a deep breath, he steadied himself.</p><br/><p>Click!</p><br/><p>Yun Xue Yao opened the door.</p><br/><p>Yun Xue Yao was wearing her pajamas as she stood outside the door. \u201cBrother Lin, have you slept yet?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot yet. I was just about to. What\u2019s up?\u201d Lin Fan replied.</p><br/><p>Following the standard rules of engagement, the girl would reply, \u201cBrother Lin, do you mind if I come in for a while?\u201d Otherwise, the other tactic would be for the girl to just rush up without a second word and kiss him, and the rest would follow.</p><br/><p>Instead, Yun Xue Yao hesitated for a while before speaking, \u201cBrother Lin, do you know how to play mahjong?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was completely taken aback, but he managed to nod his head. \u201cYea, what about it?\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, Yun Xue Yao giggled, as she grabbed Lin Fan\u2019s hands. For Lin Fan, even that was a little too direct.</p><br/><p>At least have a little conversation first. You shouldn\u2019t be that direct to just open the door like that.</p><br/><p>He wasn\u2019t that kind of person.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, that is great. My younger brother and sister want to play mahjong tonight but we are short of one player. Do you want to join us?\u201d Yun Xue Yao said, her face lighting up. Yun Xue Yao knew that with Lin Fan\u2019s gambling skills, he definitely knew how to play mahjong. She just asked him to break the subject.</p><br/><p>But they would definitely lose badly to him</p><br/><p>\u201cAh?\u201d Lin Fan looked a little dazed, thereafter muttering, \u201cJust mahjong?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYea, otherwise what else?\u201d After saying that, Yun Xue Yao blushed, realizing what it could mean. \u2018Brother Lin is really direct, but we\u2019ve only just met. We shouldn\u2019t be doing it just like that. If he really wanted and I refused him, it wouldn\u2019t be very good,\u2019 she thought to herself.</p><br/><p>At home, Yun Xue Yao wasn\u2019t as firm and unyielding as she acted outside.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, no, I thought that there was something urgent,\u201d Lin Fan couldn\u2019t let her have any misconceptions. He was the famed Master Lin of Cloud Street. He had fans numbering in the hundreds of thousands. How could he behave like that?</p><br/><p>What made Lin Fan even more confounded was what he was thinking after he had gotten to Hao Jiang. How did his thoughts go so awry after meeting Yun Xue Yao?</p><br/><p>How despicable.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s hurry, they are all waiting,\u201d Yun Xue Yao said, not waiting for Lin Fan to react as she immediately pulled him off the bed.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at Yun Xue Yao\u2019s silhouette as he followed her. He had to get back to Shanghai first thing tomorrow. Hao Jiang was too dangerous and there were too many temptations. Shanghai was better.</p><br/><p>All the way to four o\u2019clock in the morning.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan originally thought that they were going to play for a short while. He never thought that their game was never-ending. If he hadn\u2019t voluntarily suggested for himself to get some rest, he would have played till the sun rose.</p><br/><p>Returning to his room, he crashed on his bed. Lin Fan ran his hands across his blushed cheeks. What on earth was he thinking the whole day?</p><br/><p>In the other room.</p><br/><p>Yun Xue Yao\u2019s sister was from the same father but different mother. However, she was a feral child and was brought back home after some time. Despite coming from a different mother, Yun Xue Yao still treated her well, as if she was really her own sister.</p><br/><p>\u201cSis, do you like Master Lin?\u201d Yun Xiang Da asked excitedly.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat kind of question was that? Go and sleep,\u201d Yun Xue Yao said, rolling her eyes. She pulled up her blanket, preparing to go to sleep. However, as she closed her eyes, the events of the day replayed in her mind, and she couldn\u2019t help but smile at it. Finally, she drifted off to dreamland.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The next day.</p><br/><p>At the airport.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved at the group of people who were sending him off. \u201cTell me when you come to Shanghai. I\u2019ll definitely bring you guys around.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yun Xue Yao waved back, her eyes looking reluctantly at Lin Fan, \u201cGoodbye, Brother Lin.\u201d She didn\u2019t know when was the next time she was going to see Lin Fan Brother Lin again.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher Lin, I really can\u2019t thank you enough this time,\u201d Ye Zhen Ming said gratefully.</p><br/><p>Although he had only been in Hao Jiang for a few days, he had gotten quite a huge loot. He felt for the card which was in his pocket, chuckling to himself.</p><br/><p>It was just too easy to earn money.</p><br/><p>Ten million dollars for flipping on mahjong tile.</p><br/><p>Before he had gotten the Encyclopedia, Lin Fan\u2019s only goal was to work hard to earn money. After getting the Encyclopedia, he suddenly realized that money was just too easy to come by.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t stressful at all, and so he didn\u2019t pay too much attention to making money.</p><br/><p>For Lin Fan, the most meaningful thing that he could do was to help out at the Nanshan Children\u2019s Welfare Home.</p><br/><p>Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian sat at the door, smoking a cigarette, \u201cI don\u2019t know what on earth that brat is doing in Hao Jiang. I can\u2019t believe that he didn\u2019t bring me along.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan giggled, \u201cBrother Lin goes out to do business. He doesn\u2019t have time for holidays.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian shook his head helplessly, \u201cElder Wu, you really wasted your time bringing up this child. She hasn\u2019t even married yet. I think we have to support each other next time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang chuckled, \u201cFraud Tian, what kind of support are you talking about?\u201d His expression deserved a spanking, the way he emphasized heavily on the word \u2018support\u2019.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian nagged, \u201cYou are also another one. No wonder you\u2019re still single.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, hey. You shouldn\u2019t scold me like that. Also, did you know that I have many girls on the live broadcast who have confessed to me? The only thing is that they aren\u2019t mature enough, otherwise, I would already have a girlfriend.\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly, a familiar sound came from afar.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh? Are you cheating young underage girls now? That isn\u2019t good.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing that voice, the group of them froze, turning to look.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian exclaimed in surprise, \u201cWhoa damn, you\u2019re back from Hao Jiang fast. Could it be that you came back immediately after reaching there?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI came back immediately after finishing what I had to do over there,\u201d Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan rejoiced after seeing that Brother Lin had returned. She immediately got Lin Fan a chair as she started massaging him, \u201cBrother Lin, how was Hao Jiang? Was it fun?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan thought for a while before replying, \u201cThis trip was rather delightful and fun.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was definitely a fun trip. He had a blast beating up bad guys- how was it not fun?</p></div>\n</div>"}

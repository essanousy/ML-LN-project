Their looks were like those of people begging, however, Lin Fan turned a blind eye which broke their hearts. The scallion pancakes were really too delicious and one was not enough to satisfy their cravings. Although the food on the table also had a very nice smell, once they had tried the scallion pancakes, they did not want anything else.</p><br/><p>Chen Xiang was still reflecting. The look in his eyes towards Lin Fan was slowly changing.</p><br/><p>To the classmates, they knew that one scallion pancake was not enough to leave this place with, so they were hoping to use their friendship with Lin Fan to get some more.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan asked with astonishment, \u201cTeacher Xia has been gone for quite awhile hasn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes she has, I\u2019ll go check on her,\u201d Wang Zhen got up and said. Then he smiled and said, \u201cCome on guys, whether we can eat the scallion pancakes again will depend on you guys now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone nodded, they were willing to work together just to get to eat the scallion pancakes again.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Lin, I respect you. Anything that you want me to do, I\u2019ll do it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, do you remember the time when we were in the same dorm and you had no money to eat? I helped you buy some food.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen you didn\u2019t want to attend class back then, I helped you take attendance, surely you can\u2019t forget that act of kindness.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan helplessly said, \u201cYou guys can\u2019t possibly be so shameless.\u201d</p><br/><p>When he saw how his classmates had been hypnotized by the scallion pancakes, he felt pretty good inside. However, for him to make another batch of these pancakes was definitely not something that was possible. He was the head of Cloud Street, the famous scallion pancake master and to make these scallion pancakes just like that to satisfy their hunger was not fair to the others who could not eat it.</p><br/><p>However, since they had already been hypnotized by his scallion pancakes, he was afraid of how the future class gatherings would be like.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Wang Zhen shouted from the outside, \u201cGuys, come quick\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone was shocked and Lin Fan was very suspicious. They had no idea what was going on but Wang Zhen\u2019s cry sounded very urgent like something big had happened outside.</p><br/><p>\u201cSomething happened?\u201d Chen Xiang stood up and said, his eyes filled with suspicion.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go out and see.\u201d Lin Fan, without a second thought, got up and headed outside. There was something very off about Wang Zhen\u2019s voice so it could be possible that something had happened.</p><br/><p>He opened the door, only to see Wang Zhen rushing over and saying, \u201cQuick, Teacher Xia is in trouble.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSh*t, what happened?\u201d Everyone was in shock and suddenly became very fired up.</p><br/><p>Quickly, they heard a ruckus from the private room next door and also heard sounds of arguing and scolding. All the words that were being shouted were pretty mean.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Lin Fan asked.</p><br/><p>Wang Zhen shook his head and said, \u201cI have no idea, but it seems like someone is causing trouble inside Teacher Xia\u2019s room. The moment I realized, I came back to call you guys.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan, without a second thought, rushed towards Teacher Xia\u2019s private room.</p><br/><p>Inside the private room, Teacher Xia had already been scolded until she was in tears and her husband, Shen Hong, was also extremely flustered. He did not think that this b*stard was such a hoodlum.</p><br/><p>He had already admitted to the debt he had picked up at the gambling den and had already returned a portion of it. However, this man was not willing to move an inch and if he did not get his money today, was not willing to leave.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t you guys gone too far?\u201d Shen Hong furiously said. Today was his wife\u2019s birthday and he had planned to give her a happy celebration. He had never thought that something like this would happen.</p><br/><p>If he had known something like this would happen, he would never have entered the gambling den, even if it killed him. However, it was too late to change that.</p><br/><p>The school leaders were also furious. They felt that this man had gone way too far.</p><br/><p>Regarding the situation of Teacher Shen being lured into a gambling den, they were not too satisfied with it. However, they did not say much about it as in today\u2019s society, there was not anyone who was perfect so as long as they were willing to change, it was okay.</p><br/><p>Therefore, they did not have any objections against Teacher Shen.</p><br/><p>The men sneered and said, \u201cToo far? If you owe money, you have to pay, that is a universal principle. Even if you call the police, the money will still have to be returned.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although the man was drunk, it was not because of the drunken state that he went crazy looking for the money. It was because he knew that if he chased Shen Hong for the money now, in front of such a big crowded, he would be embarrassed if he did not pay up.</p><br/><p>This guy was a teacher and they valued their reputations a lot. If more people knew he gambled, it would kill his reputation even more.</p><br/><p>At this point, Shen Hong was lost for words. He had already been pissed off by this b*stard, so he angrily said, \u201cBack then we already told you that we did not have enough money and we had already agreed to slowly pay you back. So even if you chase us for the money now, we have no way of getting it.\u201d</p><br/><p>The man sneered, \u201cI don\u2019t care. You better get me the money tonight,\u201d then he stared at Teacher Xia and said, \u201cIf you can\u2019t find the money, then let me give you an idea. Your wife is pretty decent, just sell her off.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Shen Hong furiously said.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bam!</p><br/><p>Suddenly, the private room\u2019s door was pushed open.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d Lin Fan had heard everything from outside and was furious when he heard it. He burst into anger. This b*stard was really too much, to have the nerve to say that about Teacher Xia.</p><br/><p>Er!</p><br/><p>The man turned around and saw the group of people standing outside, all in anger and then saw Lin Fan rush in and say, \u201cTeacher Xia, are you guys okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>When he saw Teacher Xia\u2019s eyes completely red, Lin Fan was pissed off. Then, he looked at the man and said, \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p><br/><p>The rest of his classmates followed suit. They had all heard the humiliating things that man said and so when they all entered the room, they went to protect Teacher Xia. The females all gathered by her side to comfort her.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, you\u2019ve got some backup,\u201d the man saw this whole scene and laughed. Then, the look in his eyes became serious as he said, \u201cI don\u2019t care how many people are here, but you all better remember this, your teacher\u2019s husband owes a huge amount of money and I want the money today.\u201d</p><br/><p>Teacher Xia looked at Lin Fan and said, \u201cGo back to your room, let me handle this myself.\u201d</p><br/><p>When the students came, Teacher Xia felt a little bit more confident. However, she did not wish to involve them especially since it was her own family issue and it had no relation to them.</p><br/><p>\u201cRelax, Teacher Xia. As long as I am here, nothing bad will happen to you. Just let me handle this,\u201d Lin Fan took the initiative and said.</p><br/><p>Although this situation did not involve them, Teacher Xia was their teacher and during their schooling days, they were on very good terms with her. Now that they had grown up and had more power, they could not just sit back and watch.</p><br/><p>Wang Zhen also said, \u201cTeacher Xia, leave this to us.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Xiang nodded and said, \u201cTeacher Xia, you should sit aside and rest.\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, Wang Zhen stepped up and said, \u201cBig brothers, how about we put aside our teacher\u2019s debt for today? It is her birthday so just give her some face and we can discuss this later.</p><br/><p>Wang Zhen was a well-traveled man who spoke very politely. He did not want to cause any trouble especially since these men did not look like very good people. They themselves did not have much power in Jiang Ning either, so if things took a turn for the worse, it would not really benefit anyone.</p><br/><p>They were just ordinary people. Against these bullies, there was not really much they could do.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan pulled Wang Zhen back and said, \u201cWhy are you speaking to them so nicely? This situation isn\u2019t that simple. Disregarding the money that Teacher Xia owes, they also humiliated her.\u201d</p><br/><p>He had never been afraid of anyone, especially not these people. He had an idea.</p><br/><p>Wang Zhen looked at Lin Fan and for that moment, felt powerless. He knew that these people were bullies and not to be trifled with, which is why he did not want to blow things up.</p><br/><p>However, they had no idea that when Lin Fan was met with such a situation, he would never try to reconcile. He would press forward and go for direct conflict.</p></div>\n</div>"}

He saw that there would be no calamity in his fate. Hence, he didn\u2019t bother about that matter anymore.</p><br/><p>Being a quiet back-scrubber in Elder Zeng\u2019s bathhouse seemed to gradually be taking a turn for the better. Since the previous day, the number of customers had increased significantly and the people who personally requested for Lin Fan to scrub their bodies were getting more and more. It seemed that Lin Fan was gradually becoming well-known.</p><br/><p>Once his reputation reached a certain peak, the task would be completed!</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan walked over quietly and asked, \u201cWho was it who called just now? Why did that voice sound like a young lady? Her voice was really pleasant.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled. \u201cHow was that pleasant? Remember this, that person will very like come to Shanghai to cut me down. So if someday, a stranger asks where I am, just pretend you don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t know how Brother Qiang Qiang\u2019s temper was like but it seemed that this matter wouldn\u2019t be over so easily. She would definitely try to settle things with Lin Fan. Hence, Lin Fan decided to just take it slow for now and when the time comes, he would think of a solution to the problem.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan covered her mouth in astonishment. Her eyes gleamed with shock. \u201cShe wants to cut you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPfft!\u201d Fraud Tian couldn\u2019t resist laughing, \u201cWhich idiot has lost his mind now? She wants to cut you down? You\u2019ll send her flying with one hit!\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian had a lot of respect for Lin Fan. Lin Fan was simply inhuman. At such a young age, he was already exceptional in martial arts. Even Fraud Tian\u2019s masters wouldn\u2019t be able to compete with this kid. When Fraud Tian thought about it, even he was a little pissed.</p><br/><p>Who wouldn\u2019t be pissed?</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang came over, holding his phone. \u201cBrother Lin, you just have to cry for help in the broadcast and many people will definitely come to your rescue.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled, then said hello to the broadcast viewers. He hadn\u2019t been on the broadcast for some time now. When the netizens saw Lin Fan, they kept crying out in surprise. Lin Fan was getting more and more titles.</p><br/><p>One of the most shocking titles was the title of \u2018Godly Doctor\u2019.</p><br/><p>This title was one that was worthy of respect. It was one that nobody was willing to offend.</p><br/><p>*ring ring*</p><br/><p>Another phone call came.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s not talk for now. I need to receive another call.\u201d Lin Fan looked at the notification. It was his disciple, Zhao Ming Qing.</p><br/><p>Since they had returned from the volunteer medical work, Zhao Ming Qing had been busy with Chinese medicine things. As the Chinese Medical Academy\u2019s Director, he had a huge responsibility to bear. At the same time, he wanted to carry forward Chinese medicine but a single person\u2019s abilities would always be minute.</p><br/><p>\u201cMing Qing, what\u2019s up?\u201d Lin Fan was content with this disciple. Lin Fan didn\u2019t want to keep Chinese medical knowledge to himself. It was life-saving knowledge and it wasn\u2019t easy to meet an old Chinese doctor willing to put aside his pride and devote himself to learning from him. Of course, Lin Fan wouldn\u2019t have rejected him.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing had been very busy lately. Reporters came in large waves. But as the Chinese Medical Academy\u2019s Director, he couldn\u2019t reject these interviews. If he did, who would promote Chinese medicine?</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, I\u2019ve already discussed the anorexia medicine with the National Medical Treatment Organization. In terms of money, it will be split up. Although you discovered it, it cannot be monopolized. But don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ve already communicated with the Medical Treatment Organization\u2026\u201d Zhao Ming Qing kept explaining. He was afraid that his teacher would be unhappy. After all, this anorexia medicine was the result of his teacher\u2019s blood and sweat. Zhao Ming Qing was doing this because a true life-saving medicine should not be kept to oneself but he didn\u2019t want his teacher to lose out either. Hence, he kept trying to explain himself, hoping that his teacher would understand.</p><br/><p>The nation would not allow a medicine for a disease like anorexia to be controlled by a single person. The proper solution was to work together and share the medicine.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan wasn\u2019t bothered about all this. If he really cared about wealth, he wouldn\u2019t have worked so much until now and still be this way. Money didn\u2019t need to be painstakingly earned. When he needed it, he would get it. When he didn\u2019t need it, he didn\u2019t think about all this.</p><br/><p>When things get big and one doesn\u2019t have the capability, it\u2019s easy to spout nonsense.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was someone who knew himself. He wasn\u2019t a qualified businessman.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need to tell me all this. Didn\u2019t I already tell you? You have full rights to handle this kind of things. Even if you give it to them for free, I won\u2019t say anything. You have to remember that when finding the medicine, I only guided you. You were the one who researched and found it in the end,\u201d said Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing was so touched that he was about to cry. It was so hard to come across such a reasonable and fair teacher. If it were average people, fighting over this anorexia medicine could cause brothers to become enemies and fathers to dispute with sons.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re cooperating with the Medical Treatment Organization. The distribution of benefits should be pretty good, right?\u201d asked Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing nodded, \u201cYes, I\u2019ve worked hard to gain better benefit distribution with the Medical Treatment Organization. They\u2019ve categorized our contribution to the medicine as equity participation. The sum of money is impressive.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded, \u201cMmm, alright then. With the money you get from this, make a Chinese medicine contribution award and support some of the students who are interested in Chinese medicine but don\u2019t have the funds to study it. Nurture them properly. As for how you make these arrangements, you can decide for yourself. No need to trouble me about this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Zhao Ming Qing was stunned, \u201cTeacher, are you serious?\u201d</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t that he didn\u2019t dare to believe it but he had never thought that his teacher would want to use this sum of money to support the development of Chinese medicine.</p><br/><p>Currently, the country was supporting Chinese medicine as well but the strength of their support wasn\u2019t great and the results were insignificant.</p><br/><p>However, if he used the profits from the anorexia medicine to support Chinese medicine, they would have an unending flow of funds and would never have to worry about not having enough money again.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed, \u201cWhen have I ever joked with you? Is there anything else? If not, I\u2019m hanging up. I\u2019ve been very troubled lately.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing was taken aback. \u201cTeacher, why are you troubled? Is there anything I can help with?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t help me. There\u2019s been someone who wants to cut me down lately,\u201d said Lin Fan jokingly.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing took it seriously. \u201cWhat? Who would be so daring? Teacher, I\u2019ll call the police immediately. I won\u2019t let you be harmed!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan sighed. Having such an old student wasn\u2019t too good. He couldn\u2019t understand that it was a joke. \u201cAlright, alright. I was just joking. Is there anything else?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing wanted to speak but hesitated. It was as if he was embarrassed to speak.</p><br/><p>\u201cSpeak.\u201d Without even seeing Zhao Ming Qing\u2019s expression, Lin Fan knew that something was up with his disciple.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s like this, actually. Recently, I did some research and seriously considered it. I realized that there is a huge loophole in the Academy\u2019s Chinese Medicine Foundational Knowledge teaching module. Some of the content is extracted from ancient books. We don\u2019t have a rational study plan. To beginners, the difficulty is too great and they can\u2019t grasp the main aspects of it. That\u2019s why I want to invite Teacher to help our academy write new teaching materials to help with our students\u2019 studies,\u201d said Zhao Ming Qing in an embarrassed tone. He felt that he was always troubling his teacher.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled, \u201cMing Qing, why didn\u2019t you realize this in the past?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing said embarrassedly, \u201cTeacher, in the past, I hadn\u2019t grasped the essence of my studies and I was narrow-minded. Now that I\u2019ve been through teacher\u2019s teachings, I\u2019ve gained a deeper understanding of Chinese medicine and I\u2019ve discovered the huge loophole in our students\u2019 foundational Chinese medicine teaching materials. The progress of study is unreasonable. With Teacher\u2019s understanding of Chinese medicine, if you could write Chinese medicine teaching materials, they would definitely be better than the ones we have. After all, for a Chinese medical master like Teacher to personally undertake this task, the impact will naturally be extraordinary.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, enough boot-licking. I accept this task. However, I need some time. Writing teaching materials is no small task. I need to put some effort into it,\u201d said Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>When Zhao Ming Qing heard that his teacher agreed, he was wild with joy. \u201cThank you, teacher! Teacher, please rest well. I shall not disturb you further.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d</p><br/><p>Writing Chinese medicine teaching materials. This was a very simple task but it was exceptional.</p><br/><p>If he wrote well, his name would be passed down for even over a hundred years.</p><br/><p>Amazing.</p><br/><p>Just thinking about it made him a little emotional.</p></div>\n</div>"}

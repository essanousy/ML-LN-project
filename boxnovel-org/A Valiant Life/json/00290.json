He was there to scare Lin Fan but Lin Fan has taken advantage of him even before he could do anything to him. He had been beaten to the ground and before he could retaliate, the police officers were there. Furthermore, they were immediately captured and placed in the police car.</p><br/><p>If he had known that things were going to turn out like this, he wouldn't have come to look for Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>In the car.</p><br/><p>Brother Long cried, \"Police officers, all of you caught the wrong people. We're just here for sightseeing. You should've arrested him instead. Look at my face, it's been beaten up to this state.</p><br/><p>The subordinates were all trembling in the car. For the first time ever, they were having doubts about Brother Long whom they thought was an extremely wise man.</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian looked at them. \"Just be honest. Tell me more when we reach the police station.\"</p><br/><p>Brother Long looked at the van that had been taken over by the police and he was extremely helpless. It had been bought with his hard earned money and it was brand new.</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, below the house.</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang sighed, \"These people really surrendered themselves, how pathetic!\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled and shook his head. \"I wasted my slippers. I shouldn't have thrown them away since I probably can still use them in the future.\"</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian complimented, \"Your skills were impressive. You combined Ba Gua Palm with the usage of slippers. It's such a valiant new skill. I've got to say, that was genius.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan accepted Fraud Tian's praise. Sometimes, you don't have to be modest about being talented. He was extremely satisfied with what he had done just now.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan continued broadcasting for the next few days and there were more viewers than before. The average number was 1.35million people and it could hit 2.5million people at its peak. Of course, the figures weren't really accurate but to Lin Fan, he was satisfied with spreading the word since it was for a good cause.</p><br/><p>However, there wasn't any notification that the task had been completed. It seemed like more had to be done in order to meet the criteria.</p><br/><p>However, it was getting absurd. There were so many viewers but he still hadn't completed it. He was starting to feel helpless.</p><br/><p>Then, Lin Fan looked at Weibo and realized that he had many private messages in his inbox. Most of them were from the viewers to thank him for what he did.</p><br/><p>\"Thank you, Master Lin. I am so lucky to have watched your broadcast during the lowest point of my life. It's a pity that my friends didn't listen to me and went to the casino. They lost a few hundred thousand dollars but they've reported it to the police. They should be able to get a good outcome.\"</p><br/><p>\"Ever since I started watching your broadcasts, I've decided to quit gambling. Although sometimes I feel the urge to go back to it, I would play your broadcasts and watch it again to remind myself.\"</p><br/><p>\"You're the light of my path.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan usually would reply to these private messages but there were some that made him extremely helpless. They just wanted to ask him to be their mentor so that they could retrieve their losses.</p><br/><p>\"Master Lin, please take me as your disciple. I've already lost everything. I promise that as long as I win back the money that I've lost, I won't gamble anymore\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"Master Lin, are you there?\"</p><br/><p>\"Bloody Master Lin\u2026 I just wanted to win back the money that I lost and you don't even want to help me\u2026\"</p><br/><p>As for these messages, Lin Fan was helpless. It was obvious that some people were hopeless to be saved.</p><br/><p>He had already done his best and it wasn't like he was the reincarnation of the Buddha. He just ignored these messages.</p><br/><p>*Ding ding!*</p><br/><p>Then, the phone rang.</p><br/><p>It was an unknown number.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan picked it up. \"Hi, you are?\"</p><br/><p>\"Hi, Master Lin, I am Li Guang Rong from Shanghai TV productions. We have an anti-gambling programme tomorrow and we saw your anti-gambling broadcasts online. We would like to invite you as a guest. Will you be free to come?\" Li Guang Rong asked politely.</p><br/><p>His TV programmes were usually night shows. The viewership was low and therefore he had been trying to create more meaningful shows to boost the viewership rate. He had thought about it for a long time before deciding to invite the Northeastern God of Gambling as a guest.</p><br/><p>Now, he decided to invite Lin Fan upon hearing the suggestion given by another colleague. They wanted to invite an anti-gambling guest to create a different effect.</p><br/><p>It was the second episode and the first one was already over. They had invited the Southern God of Gambling, Ye Zhen Ming as the guest of the first episode. This time, they invited the Northern God of Gambling along with Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed when he received the call. The idea of being on TV was a decent one. It was better than broadcasting online.</p><br/><p>\"Alright, no problem. I'll be there on time tomorrow,\" Lin Fan agreed.</p><br/><p>Li Guang Rong replied, \"That's great. I'll get someone to wait for you at the entrance. It's a night show so the meeting time will be 7 pm.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \"Okay, thanks a lot.\"</p><br/><p>After hanging up, Lin Fan laughed. This was an important opportunity and he had to depend on it to succeed. If not, he would have to take it slow to complete his task.</p><br/><p>He packed up.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan prepared to leave his house. He didn't know what was the situation like at Tian Hong Commercial Street but he thought it should be completed soon. According to his sources through the phone, it was already at the last stage of renovation.</p><br/><p>He wanted to go there and have a look at the progress. He wasn't like the other shop owners who had a lot of things to shift from the old place. He had bought almost everything again. Therefore, he just had to shift them in and that was easier.</p><br/><p>He left the house and drove off.</p><br/><p>He hummed as he drove. He was feeling extremely carefree. These days were awesome. He could do whatever he wanted without worrying about anything.</p><br/><p>Then, he saw someone familiar in the distance.</p><br/><p>\"D*mn, it's this fella.\"</p><br/><p>It was Autumn Sword Fish Killer! The Flame War Emperor that always caused trouble for him.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan knew this fella had always been in Shanghai but he hadn't expected to bump into him. Autumn Sword Fish Killer was carrying bags of things and he hailed for a cab. When he boarded the cab, it suddenly sank and the suspension was fully compressed.</p><br/><p>He had initially wanted to go to Tian Hong Commercial Street but now that he saw him, he wanted to see what Autumn Sword Fish Killer was up to.</p><br/><p>He was the Flame War Emperor that always sought trouble. Could Lin Fan infuriate him again?</p><br/><p>He knew that Autumn Sword Fish Killer's turning point in life was about to happen. Of course, it wasn't a good one. It was a matter of life and death.</p><br/><p>He had always remembered it since they were pretty 'close'. Although their relationship wasn't on a good note, he still had to warn him about it.</p><br/><p>About fifteen minutes later.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan followed Autumn Sword Fish Killer into a gym.</p><br/><p>When he entered the lift, the weight limit was exceeded and everyone else had to leave the lift one by one. Autumn Sword Fish Killer was expressionless as if he didn't care if it was caused by him.</p><br/><p>At the gym.</p><br/><p>\"Sir, you can't enter without a card,\" the receptionist said.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled, \"The fat man that just entered is my friend. I'm here to watch what he's doing.\"</p><br/><p>The female receptionist was stunned. Then, she exclaimed, \"Your friend is so determined.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled and then went to the gym. When he went inside, he was stunned.</p><br/><p>It was such an ugly sight...</p><br/><p>His black silk pants were stuck to his a*s and he was bouncing up and down. It was such a horrifying sight.</p><br/><p>But Autumn Sword Fish Killer wasn't bothered by what the others thought of him.</p><br/><p>He was determined to work hard.</p><br/><p>One shouldn't bully a fat teenager.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

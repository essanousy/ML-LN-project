She had not expected this b*stard to be so shameless.</p><br/><p>Five hundred dollars?</p><br/><p>I\u2019ll cut off your legs.</p><br/><p>But it was a shame. No matter how furious Ying Jin was, it was useless. Even if she died of anger, she wouldn\u2019t be able to affect Lin Fan one bit. Not even a little bit.</p><br/><p>Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang patted his chest. \u201cBrother Lin, you\u2019re going to piss Ying Jin off to death.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe!\u201d Lin Fan laughed, \u201cIt\u2019d be good if she gets pissed to death. Then, the debt wouldn\u2019t have to be repaid. However, this woman\u2019s attitude is really great. From now on, I\u2019ll scare her every time I see her.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian burst out laughing, \u201cYou\u2019re really vicious, kid. Anyone who becomes your enemy is sure to suffer a tragic fate. If this was in the olden days, you could go directly to her doorstep and kill her with one strike. It would be to everyone\u2019s satisfaction. But now, murder has become illegal.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFraud, I feel that your thinking is dangerous. It\u2019s not good to hurt and kill others. As long as one is alive, there must be excitement in one\u2019s life. Without that, life would be meaningless.\u201d How could a kind-hearted man like Lin Fan kill somebody? If he didn\u2019t drive her mad, his life would be boring.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Lin Fan set a goal for his own life. That was to make that b*tch incomparably fearful of him, such that she would retreat in fear every time she saw him.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan came to Lin Fan\u2019s side and said sulkily, \u201cI\u2019m so jealous of Huan Yue.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing Wu You Lan\u2019s expression, Lin Fan pinched her cheeks. \u201cWhat are you jealous of? If you were being bullied, your Brother Lin would definitely go all out against them as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan giggled, \u201cI don\u2019t want Brother Lin to go against anyone. I just want to be like Huan Yue.\u201d After saying that, her mood was brilliant. She even wanted to give Brother Lin a kiss.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, alright, then we\u2019ll hate on them,\u201d said Lin Fan with a smile.</p><br/><p>Such was life. It was so splendid. However, there was something that Lin Fan had to think about at that moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you guys think I could go and become a mentor? Would anyone choose me as a mentor?\u201d asked Lin Fan. He was a little excited. He had never been on any high-end shows and Shanghai TV\u2019s shows all had high viewership ratings.</p><br/><p>If he accidentally became too famous, would people start asking him for autographs in public?</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan\u2019s eyes gleamed. \u201cBrother Lin, you have to participate. If you become a mentor, you would definitely be amazing. Those students would definitely want to become Brother Lin\u2019s students.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian nudged Lin Fan gently with a crude expression on his face. He smiled and said, \u201cBro, join the show. If there are any beautiful female students, you could hook me up. No matter what, we\u2019ve known each other for so long and you should think about me a little, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at him disdainfully. \u201cForget it. Even if there are suitable ones, I would introduce them to Lil\u2019 Zhao.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Zhao Zhong Yang heard that, he instantly smiled. He stood up confidently and said proudly, \u201cFraud, Brother Lin is right. You should forget about it. This kind of thing is best left to young people.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCheh.\u201d Fraud Tian gave a disdainful look before silently sitting down at the entrance and smoking his cigarette with hurt clearly written in his eyes.</p><br/><p>He was getting more attractive with age, how could nobody like him? It was inconceivable. It was impossible.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled, \u201cAlright then, I\u2019ll give them a reply now. Becoming a mentor isn\u2019t a bad choice.\u201d</p><br/><p>On Weibo: \u201cThank you, Shanghai TV. I feel that I would be very suitable as a mentor. No one would be more suitable than me @ShanghaiTV.\u201d</p><br/><p>*pop*</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone, run away! Master Lin is being narcissistic again.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI support Master Lin becoming a mentor. If he becomes a mentor, I would definitely watch every episode of this show.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMe too. I wonder what would happen if Master Lin becomes a mentor.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Internet was very supportive of this. Also, Shanghai TV quickly replied. They were, of course, incomparably welcoming of this decision. They hadn\u2019t discussed the money yet but there was still a month before the broadcast of the show, hence, there was no rush. They could discuss it later.</p><br/><p>In a certain county.</p><br/><p>Chen Rui An saw the news on Weibo and was filled with energy once more. He opened the room door.</p><br/><p>\u201cMom, I want to sign up for Shanghai TV\u2019s singing competition. I want to prove myself.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Mama Chen, who had been enduring for two years, heard her son say that, tears started falling from her eyes. As long as her son could recover, it didn\u2019t matter what it was, she would support it.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>In the blink of an eye, a few days passed.</p><br/><p>Ying Jin did not retaliate on Weibo. It was as if she had disappeared. However, it didn\u2019t concern Lin Fan at all. It was just a small matter.</p><br/><p>At a certain news agency.</p><br/><p>A middle-aged couple appeared at the entrance. They were Lil\u2019 Fatty\u2019s Uncle and Aunt.</p><br/><p>In these few days, they had been to numerous news agencies but not a single one welcomed them. It seemed that they were all busy with something.</p><br/><p>The matter involving Ying Jin and Master Lin had made the various news agencies very busy. They didn\u2019t have time to welcome a couple that they had no idea what they were there for. Hence, the news agencies just gave them name cards and told them to come again a few days later.</p><br/><p>And on this day, Wang Cheng Shan and Qiu Yan Lan had appeared at the entrance of a news agency in Shanghai to report the situation and stir up the public so that the Nanshan Children\u2019s Welfare Institute would let Lil\u2019 Fatty go.</p><br/><p>Wang Cheng Shan didn\u2019t want to wait any longer. As time dragged on, his thoughts started to become messy. He felt as if his body was worsening and perhaps his illness had already developed from early-stage to mid-stage.</p><br/><p>Inside the news agency.</p><br/><p>A reporter welcomed them. Facing the two of them, he let out a professional smile, \u201cMay I know what you have that needs to be reported?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Cheng Shan was a little anxious. He hurriedly said, \u201cThis is the situation. I have a brother who died from a car accident a few years back, leaving a child. And a few years earlier, that child was unfortunately kidnapped by human traffickers. Because of this, the child\u2019s mother remarried another man. Now, we\u2019ve found the child. As the child\u2019s Uncle and Aunt, we want to bring him back to live at our old home but that Welfare Institute doesn\u2019t want to let him go and they\u2019re not allowing us to take him. That\u2019s why we\u2019re here to request help. He\u2019s my little brother\u2019s only son. How could I just watch my little brother\u2019s son idle away in a Welfare Institute\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qiu Yan Lan lamented tearfully, \u201cYeah. That poor child has never felt the love of parents. Now, we want to bring him back but that despicable Welfare Institute won\u2019t let us. I think that Welfare Institute must be involved in some sort of shady business.\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporter was taken aback. He didn\u2019t quite dare to believe it. \u201cSomething like that happened? Did you report this to the police?\u201d</p><br/><p>If the reporter hadn\u2019t brought this up, it would\u2019ve been fine. But once he brought this up, they became pissed off.</p><br/><p>Wang Cheng Shan said furiously, \u201cI think that the police must have made a deal with the Welfare Institute. When he reached the place, he didn\u2019t say a single word. The person-in-charge at the Welfare Institute wouldn\u2019t let the child go but the police didn\u2019t say anything at all. We\u2019ve gone through the proper procedures and we\u2019re even the child\u2019s Uncle and Aunt. What rights do they have to not let him go?\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporter was a little confused. How could something like this happen?</p><br/><p>There were many Welfare Institutes in Shanghai and there were many children in them as well. Some Welfare Institutes were under large amounts of pressure and they would be more than happy if the children had relatives willing to take them. The reporter had not thought that there would be such a Welfare Institute that would refuse to let a child go. That was a little strange. Could it be that there was some sort of unspeakable secret involved?</p><br/><p>Qiu Yan Lan said with a hurt expression, \u201cMy dear reporter brother, you may not know this but there are many cases of children being mistreated in Welfare Institutes. How happy were we when we found out that the child was still alive? We rushed there immediately but who would have thought that things would turn out like this\u2026? Moreover, the person-in-charge of that Welfare Institute even said arrogantly that even if the child\u2019s own parents came, they wouldn\u2019t let him go.\u201d</p><br/><p>This reporter had seen many news incidents happen before and naturally, he wouldn\u2019t just listen to one side of the story. He controlled his emotions very well.</p><br/><p>However, beside this reporter, a female reporter had become red with anger. She stood up and said furiously, \u201cHow can there be a Welfare Institute like that? You\u2019re both relatives of the child and you want to bring him home. What rights do they have to refuse? This matter must be exposed and properly investigated.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Jiang, we have to get to the bottom of this,\u201d said the female reporter.</p><br/><p>Brother Jiang said, \u201cXiao Jiang, don\u2019t be too agitated. We have to clarify things first.\u201d Then, he looked at the couple and asked, \u201cWhat is the name of this Welfare Institute?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Cheng Shang said angrily, \u201cNanshan Children\u2019s Welfare Institute.\u201d</p><br/><p>Brother Jiang: \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Wasn\u2019t Master Lin in charge of that Welfare Institute?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

In the office.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-1\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>At that moment, there was a ruckus inside.</p><br/><p>Zhou Qing Quan and Wang Tian Feng looked at the people around. Some were sitting down with gloomy looks on their faces while others were standing around or pacing back and forth.</p><br/><p>\u201cVice-Chairman Zhou, you have to tell Chairman Lin that he can\u2019t do something like this. It will cause the association which has been painstakingly built up to collapse again,\u201d an old member said painfully as if what Chairman Lin had done was a big mistake.</p><br/><p>The others agreed with him.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah! Our association has progressed to where it is now through steady progress. We have never taken big strides. Now that Chairman Lin has taken up his appointment, he\u2019s cutting all of us off. Even if we haven\u2019t contributed, we have suffered to get here. This is heartbreaking to everyone!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. It can\u2019t go on like this. The other associations are all watching us. If we do such a thing, we\u2019ll become a joke for the rest of our lives.\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-2\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cSigh, I really regret it. I\u2019ve been in the association for eleven years, cautiously and conscientiously working but now, our memberships are going to be frozen all of a sudden. Didn\u2019t he consider our feelings at all?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Qing Quan and Wang Tian Feng listened to everyone\u2019s complaints.</p><br/><p>They felt a great deal of stress. It was as if they were walking on a tightrope.</p><br/><p>If they were not careful even for a moment, they would be in trouble.</p><br/><p>However, Master Lin had already talked to them about this beforehand. He had told them to push any problems towards him.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Zhou Qing Quan started to speak, \u201cEveryone, quieten down and calm your hearts. This is indeed a rather rash action but Chairman Lin\u2019s intentions are good. I believe that everyone knows that, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cVice-Chairman Zhou, how could this be good? Do you know how many phone calls I received this morning from people saying that they wanted to leave the association? They\u2019re saying that the association has hurt their feelings and they don\u2019t ever want to join anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSame here. Elder Yang and Elder Chen are so pi*sed that they\u2019re just lying at home.\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-3\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t agree with this reform. It\u2019s really too ridiculous. I suggest that we remove Master Lin from his appointment and choose a new Chairman.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, I agree as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Qing Quan and Wang Tian Feng looked at each other. They hadn\u2019t expected that these people wanted to overthrow Master Lin. But it was a shame. That was already not possible.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe documents for Master Lin\u2019s appointment as Chairman have already been submitted. We cannot remove him from his post. When we selected him as Chairman, you all voted in agreement. If you want to remove him from his post, the association will become a real joke,\u201d said Zhou Qing Quan.</p><br/><p>Wang Tian Feng added, \u201cSince things are like this, we\u2019ll have a talk with Chairman Lin. Hopefully, we\u2019ll be able to mediate things. Is that alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>The crowd looked at each other. In the end, they nodded and said, \u201cAlright. We\u2019re only so agitated because we want what\u2019s best for the association.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Tian Feng smiled. \u201cOf course. Everyone here is a senior member of the association. Who doesn\u2019t want to see the association to well?\u201d</p><br/><p>The didn\u2019t say much else. They had already stated their thoughts and they would just have to see how Zhou Qing Quan and Wang Tian Feng handled the rest.</p><br/><p>Right now, they were filled with regret. If they had known, they would never have agreed to let Lin Fan become the Chairman even if they died.</p><br/><p>How long had it been since he had become the Chairman?</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-4\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Not even two days. And he was already making such a harsh move.</p><br/><p>After everyone left, Zhou Qing Quan and Wang Tian Feng looked at each other.</p><br/><p>\u201cLook. When it has to do with benefits, all the greedy people come out.\u201d Zhou Qing Quan sighed. He had already known about this but in the past, he hadn\u2019t dared to take action. Now that Master Lin was in charge, he immediately cut them off and those members had started to panic.</p><br/><p>\u201cI think that there\u2019s someone behind this that\u2019s adding fuel to the fire. If no one said anything, they wouldn\u2019t have all come at the same time,\u201d said Wang Tian Feng.</p><br/><p>Zhou Qing Quan nodded. \u201cBut the good thing is that the higher departments haven\u2019t stopped us. Otherwise, it would be hard to continue.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think they will. Master Lin is the Chairman now. To put it bluntly, they are afraid of Master Lin too. They don\u2019t want to find trouble for themselves.\u201d This was what Wang Tian Feng believed. But what he said was indeed true.</p><br/><p>There were departments that managed the association. However, those departments didn\u2019t dare to manage it anymore.</p><br/><p>Master Lin was way too ferocious. He wouldn\u2019t give anybody any respect. If they tried to managed him, they would end up in trouble, so they just decided to sit back and watch the show.</p><br/><p>Cloud Street!</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was making a call. He was contacting people that he hadn\u2019t contacted in a long time, the people of the National Internet Safety Bureau.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, help me out. The behind-the-scenes management of the Chinese Medical Association has to be changed. If I wasn\u2019t banned from the Internet, I would have done it myself long ago. I wouldn\u2019t have trouble you guys.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, don\u2019t say that. You aren\u2019t troubling us. Since you\u2019ve instructed us, we\u2019ll work overtime today and we\u2019ll definitely get it done.\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-5\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cAlright then. Go into the system and make a backup of the member name list. This name list has to be able to be found with a search. It must also\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan started to instruct them. If he had done it himself, it definitely wouldn\u2019t have been a problem. But thinking about how he wasn\u2019t allowed to touch a computer, he definitely had to abide to the rule.</p><br/><p>Moreover, he was close to the people in the National Internet Safety Bureau, so he could get them to help him.</p><br/><p>As for those who were hooting on the Internet, he wasn\u2019t bothered by them at all.</p><br/><p><em>Let\u2019s look at this guy.</em></p><br/><p>A senior member of the Chinese Medical Association, Senior Professor wang, had been ranting on Weibo. His words were ferocious and filled with disdain.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m firmly against this reform. It will harm our association and harm Chinese medicine. If it is implemented, I would rather leave the association and never come back.\u201d</p><br/><p><em>There\u2019s also this one, another senior member.</em></p><br/><p>\u201cAll is lost. The association is unlucky to have chosen the wrong Chairman\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p><em>All is lost? Why isn\u2019t your life lost then?</em></p><div class=\"code-block code-block-6\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing had come to Cloud Street because the situation was getting complicated.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, I just found out that the former Vice-Chairman of the Chinese Medical Association is very displeased about this matter. Right now, majority of the association members have received instructions from him to protest,\u201d said Zhao Ming Qing worriedly.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Lin Fan nodded but wasn\u2019t bothered at all. \u201cOh yeah, Ming Qing, look at the exam script that I wrote last night. How is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing looked at his teacher in astonishment. \u201cTeacher, you really aren\u2019t bothered at all?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cWhat\u2019s there to bother about? If me bothering about it will stop him from being so cocky, I would definitely bother about it. Since it\u2019s useless, what\u2019s the point? Don\u2019t you agree?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing had no argument to that. He felt that his teacher really made sense.</p><br/><p>But if it hadn\u2019t come from his teacher, he felt that whoever said it had to be really stupid.</p><br/><p>Because this matter wasn\u2019t something so easily handled.</p><br/><p>Now, things were becoming controversial. Everyone was divided. Some of the association members had already spoken out in protest.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-7\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Most people wouldn\u2019t have been able to withstand the pressure.</p><br/><p>For his teacher to still be so calm now, Zhao Ming Qing was really in awe.</p></div>\n</div>"}

It seemed that he was really incredible. Those perfect-grade little intelligence pills had created a big bunch of geniuses.</p><br/><p>These children were still young. If they were to keep absorbing knowledge, they would become amazing.</p><br/><p>This was what Lin Fan wanted to see the most. For those children to become the most amazing people in the world.</p><br/><p>Teacher Zhou thought for a moment before saying, \u201cMaster Lin, actually, there\u2019s something that I want to say.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMmm, say it then,\u201d Lin Fan replied curiously after seeing that Teacher Zhou\u2019s expression was a little strange.</p><br/><p>\u201cActually, these children are all very smart. We\u2019ve thought about it. Perhaps within a year, all the things that we know will be learned by these children. When that happens, if you have to hire more knowledgeable teachers, we definitely won\u2019t be against it,\u201d said Teacher Zhou.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve all discussed this?\u201d Lin Fan was surprised. He asked with a smile.</p><br/><p>Teacher Zhou nodded. \u201cMmm. We talk about it sometimes. Everyone is thinking about it. These children are really too smart. If we teach them, we would be holding their talent back.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although they all wanted the apartment building very much, they couldn\u2019t only think about that.</p><br/><p>In this short period of time, they had realized that these children were all very pitiful. However, the children had met Master Lin, who took them in, giving them the best environment, the best education, and care.</p><br/><p>As teachers, they couldn\u2019t stubbornly insist to stay just for their own benefit and just for the apartments.</p><br/><p>Just as Teacher Zhou was thinking about all this, she realized that Master Lin had placed his hand on her shoulder.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher Zhou, I can tell you clearly and very surely that that won\u2019t happen. No matter how fast the children learn and how talented they are, I won\u2019t be bothered. Because it doesn\u2019t matter to me how incredible the children are.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are all people that I\u2019ve chosen. I have faith in all of your morals and the children like you all very much too. The biggest reason I hired you all was not to help the children reach a great academic level. It was because I wanted you all to put your hearts into caring for the children. To let them become understanding and to help them develop a good view on life.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I won\u2019t dismiss you because of this. Instead, I hope that you all can rest assured as you work in the welfare institute. Don\u2019t change jobs. The children have already recognized you all. If you change jobs, the children would be very saddened.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan had chosen these people from a large group of applicants back then. He really hadn\u2019t been particular about knowledgeability.</p><br/><p>After all, there had been numerous applicants back then who had high academic qualifications and were very knowledgeable. There had been many applicants who were more impressive than those he had chosen.</p><br/><p>However, in the end, he had still passed on them.</p><br/><p>Director Huang smiled as she stood by the side. \u201cMaster Lin is right. Back then, there were so many academically qualified applicants but Master Lin didn\u2019t pick them. That\u2019s why knowledgeability is not the most important. What\u2019s important is character, morals, and way of thinking.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. \u201cDirector Huang understand me after all.\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Huang was delighted. \u201cI\u2019ve worked in the welfare institute my whole life. How could I not know what Master Lin is thinking? In the past, the children of the welfare institute have grown up and committed crimes outside. Some of them have gone out to become hooligans and gangsters. This was all because of problems that we had in our education back then.\u201d</p><br/><p>Teacher Zhou looked at Master Lin as if she hadn\u2019t expected Master Lin to say those things. She had not thought of that at all.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cTeacher Zhou, after the class, relay what I said to the group. Get them to teach the children well. If your knowledge is insufficient, it\u2019s fine. Since the children are so smart, the teachers and the children can merge together and discuss new topics. In the future, you will learn together and improve together. Wouldn\u2019t that be great?\u201d</p><br/><p>Teacher Zhou nodded. \u201cMaster Lin, I understand.\u201d</p><br/><p>She had really not expected Master Lin to say such things. It was probably something that she would never hear from those education leaders in her entire life.</p><br/><p>Right now, although schools often talked about their attention to moral education, what really happened? Every teacher valued academic results the most.</p><br/><p>Teachers would keep saying that this student had good results or that student had good results and they would praise them for it.</p><br/><p>However, they would never say that this student has great morals.</p><br/><p>Students with poor results were bad students.</p><br/><p>Students with good results were good students.</p><br/><p>If there was a dispute, it was definitely the student with poor results who was at fault.</p><br/><p>This kind of logic was commonly seen. Moreover, it was gradually becoming more common.</p><br/><p>\u201cMmm. It\u2019s good that you understand. Don\u2019t feel too burdened. It\u2019s not a problem at all. But I\u2019d like it if you all can place more emphasis on moral and ideological education. I don\u2019t want the children to go out into the world in the future and become problematic people. I don\u2019t need them to become big contributors to society but I just don\u2019t want them to cause harm to society.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan spoke with a smile.</p><br/><p>Director Huang nodded silently by the side, expressing her agreement with Master Lin.</p><br/><p>After being the director for so many years, she had experienced many things.</p><br/><p>In the past, she had seen outstanding children in the welfare institute as well. The welfare institute had spent a lot of effort so that these children could receive the best education as well.</p><br/><p>These children had grown up receiving praise.</p><br/><p>Later on, those children had gone out and indeed became very accomplished. However, they had never seen those children again. And they had never come back to the welfare institute.</p><br/><p>Instead, those children who had always been naughty and playful would come back for a visit every year even after leaving the institute. Although they couldn\u2019t provide much help to the welfare institute, at least it was a sort of gratitude towards the welfare institute.</p><br/><p>Teacher Zhou nodded. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Master Lin. We will definitely take note of that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright. I\u2019ll be going in front to take a look,\u201d said Lin Fan softly. He had only seen the first two classes and there were many more classes he hadn\u2019t visited.</p><br/><p>As for these children, if the outside world were to discover about them, it would probably attract a large wave of reporters.</p><br/><p>If that were to happen, those talent development centers or talent groups would start appearing.</p><br/><p>However, Lin Fan didn\u2019t want such things to happen. Although he quite liked appearing in the headlines, he wished for the welfare institute to continue peacefully and quietly.</p><br/><p>He went to the classrooms one after another.</p><br/><p>The children were all studying seriously inside. Lin Fan even saw a student recite a two-thousand-word essay fluently without stopping for a moment. The student had completely memorized it.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Lin Fan understood.</p><br/><p>The perfect-grade little intelligence pill was really incredible. And the children\u2019s brains were in development.</p><br/><p>With the little intelligence pills\u2019 effects, their brains had probably reached the limits of intelligence.</p></div>\n</div>"}

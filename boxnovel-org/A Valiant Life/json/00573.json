However, when they looked out the window and saw the silhouette opposite, they gasped.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, someone is going to jump down the building.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat the h*ll, who is that? What happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>The teacher looked at the window and when he saw the person on the rooftop, he quickly placed his books down and asked the class chairman to take care of the class. Then, he hurriedly went out to have a look.</p><br/><p>On the rooftop.</p><br/><p>Chen Liang wiped his tears and looked forward. He looked calm but he was really contemplating to jump.</p><br/><p>He suddenly felt that he didn\u2019t belong here and everyone was bullying him.</p><br/><p>Especially when he thought of what had happened in the day which humiliated him. He felt the urge to jump and he couldn\u2019t get rid of that thought.</p><br/><p>The teachers and students were discussing it below.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhich class is the student from?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, isn\u2019t that Chen Liang from the sixth class? He is a good student, why does he want to commit suicide?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher Zhang, what happened to your student?\u201d</p><br/><p>The teacher in charge of Chen Liang\u2019s class, Zhang Hui, looked at Chen Liang who was on the rooftop. His face was as white as paper and he ignored what the teacher had asked him. He immediately shouted, \u201cChen Liang, quickly come down. You can tell me what happened. Don\u2019t do anything silly.</p><br/><p>Chen Liang didn\u2019t say anything. He just looked forward.</p><br/><p>Teacher Zhang was extremely anxious. He didn\u2019t know what to do. \u201cQuick, call the police, call the police!\u201d</p><br/><p>The surrounding teachers were all anxious. They quickly took out their phones.</p><br/><p>This was a major incident. If it were to happen, the consequences would be unimaginable.</p><br/><p>In a distance away.</p><br/><p>Li Yang looked at the rooftop and sneered.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Yang, this fella actually dares to commit suicide?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Yang laughed disdainfully. \u201cHim? I swear he wouldn\u2019t dare to do it. He\u2019s just scaring everyone. When he comes down, you\u2019ll see what I\u2019m going to do to him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Yang, it\u2019s going to be blown up. Why do I feel like it\u2019s because of us?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Yang glared at him, \u201cWhat do you mean by that? It has nothing to do with us. Stop guessing blindly. Let\u2019s see what this fella wants.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, the principal of the school came.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher Zhang, what\u2019s happening? Why is your student thinking of committing suicide?\u201d The principal was frantic when he went there. It was an educational institution, why did something like this happen?</p><br/><p>If it really happened, he was going to be doomed.</p><br/><p>Teacher Zhang shook his head, \u201cPrincipal, I don\u2019t know. I only realized Chen Liang was missing from the class but I didn\u2019t expect him\u2026 him\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking about? Quickly get him down,\u201d the principal said anxiously.</p><br/><p>Teacher Zhang didn\u2019t think about anything else. He immediately shouted, \u201cChen Liang, don\u2019t be rash. I\u2019ll come up to talk to you.\u201d Then, he quickly ran up.</p><br/><p>At the walkway of the sixth level, there was a metal staircase. It was leading to the rooftop. The metal staircase wasn\u2019t locked at all. Who knew this would happen?</p><br/><p>He climbed to the roof.</p><br/><p>Teacher Zhang stood at a distance away, \u201cChen Liang, listen to me. Come over here.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Teacher Zhang was inching forward slowly, Chen Liang started to get emotional, \u201cDon\u2019t come over\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, alright. I won\u2019t come over. Listen to me, don\u2019t be rash. You\u2019re the best student in my eyes and nothing must happen to you. If not, I\u2019ll be heartbroken,\u201d Teacher Zhang tried to console him.</p><br/><p>Chen Liang wiped his tears, \u201cTeacher Zhang, I know you are good to me but don\u2019t come over. If not, I\u2019ll really jump down.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cChen Liang, don\u2019t be rash. Think about your dad who worked so hard to bring you up. He brought you to Shanghai from the villages and hoped that you would grow up to become a capable man. If you were to jump down now, what\u2019s going to happen to your dad?\u201d Teacher Zhang explained. He knew that Chen Liang was from a single-parent family. His dad was a shop owner at Cloud Street and life was tough.</p><br/><p>Chen Liang was a sensible boy. He hadn\u2019t caused trouble before. He didn\u2019t want his dad to be worried. The others didn\u2019t want to stay in school but he volunteered to stay in school because he wanted to reduce the burden on his dad. At the same time, he wanted to concentrate on his studies and do his dad proud.</p><br/><p>Chen Liang lowered his head and cried. \u201cTeacher, I\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, Chen Liang looked downwards and saw Li Yang.</p><br/><p>Li Yang stood there and pointed his middle finger. At the same time, his finger slid across his neck. It was as if he was saying that he was as going to be doomed.</p><br/><p>Then, Chen Liang became more emotional.</p><br/><p>Teacher Zhang looked downwards and shouted, \u201cLi Yang, what are you doing?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Yang put down his hand and pretended that nothing happened. \u201cTeacher, nothing much. A mosquito bit me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026 you\u2026\u201d Teacher Zhang was furious. He didn\u2019t expect Li Yang to still trigger Chen Liang at such a crucial moment. He wanted to go down and slap his face.</p><br/><p>Then, something terrible happened.</p><br/><p>Chen Liang became emotional and he shouted, \u201cLi Yang, I won\u2019t let you off even if I become a ghost!\u201d Then, he jumped down from the sixth floor.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><br/><p>A series of heartbreaking screams could be heard.</p><br/><p>When Elder Chen saw his own son jump down from the rooftop, he shouted like a madman. Then, he collapsed to the ground.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan charged forward as quickly as he could when he saw that.</p><br/><p>The power that he had gotten from athletics was activated.</p><br/><p>He ran extremely quickly and everyone was stunned. He was like a rocket flying forward.</p><br/><p>The crowd was stunned and felt that everything was blurry. They wondered how could anyone run that quickly.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan stretches out his arm and wanted to stop Chen Liang from falling.</p><br/><p>However, when Chen Liang\u2019s waist landed on his arms, there was a loud crack. Lin Fan\u2019s arms immediately bent under the immense force of Chen Liang\u2019s weight.</p><br/><p>*bang*</p><br/><p>There was a loud thud.</p><br/><p>\u201cAH!!\u201d</p><br/><p>A series of frightening screams could be heard.</p><br/><p>Everyone was stunned by the scene and started screaming.</p><br/><p>The female students were screaming non-stop while some teachers collapsed to the ground after witnessing what had happened.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck!\u201d I just touched him but it was useless.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan stood before Chen Liang. He didn\u2019t expect it to be unsuccessful.</p><br/><p>His arms were completely broken and they were twisted. He gradually felt the pain but Lin Fan didn\u2019t react to it.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s still time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan grabbed onto his arms and twisted them back to normal. There was a loud click.</p><br/><p>It was a violent way of recovering the use of his arms. The pain was definitely excruciating but Lin Fan didn\u2019t care at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy son\u2026\u201d Elder Chen rushed over and saw his bloodied son on the ground. Then, he collapsed to the ground.</p><br/><p>Elder Liang\u2019s eyes widened as he couldn\u2019t believe what he just saw.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Boss\u2026\u201d Elder Chen\u2019s face was filled with tears as he looked at Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan kneeled down and did some visual checks. Thankfully, he managed to help reduce the impact of the fall. At the same time, he didn\u2019t let his head touch the floor. The main area of impact was at his waist. Due to his arms redirecting his fall, the condition was pretty serious. There were a lot of broken bones and organs.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Chen, do not touch your son, quick, call the ambulance. Let me handle this,\u201d Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>Elder Chen looked at his son, who was bleeding everywhere. He was already extremely frightened. When he heard what Little Boss said, he nodded forcefully. His hands trembled as he tried to make a call.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Boss, please, you have to save my son.\u201d Elder Chen was shocked and he could only pin his hopes on Lin Fan.</p></div>\n</div>"}

There's a sofa, a TV, and a personal bathroom.</p><br/><p>What the hell did I live in before? Just a few square meters and it didn't even have a toilet. It's space only sufficed for a few steps. I didn't even have enough space to do his own things.</p><br/><p>He was finally able to turn his life around and he was slowly feeling the power of a petit bourgeois. On the TV, the host was reading a piece of news.</p><br/><p>\"China's top MMA artist, Han Lu, had a tough fight with the master of the Ba Gua Zhang, Master Lei Lei\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Lin Fan was studying the encyclopedia.</p><br/><p>Host: Lin Fan</p><br/><p>Occupation: Scallion pancake master, Fortune-teller, Master of Ba Gua Zhang</p><br/><p>Mission: To become a renown Master Lin (Incomplete)</p><br/><p>Reward: Encyclopedic Points +20</p><br/><p>Current Encyclopedic Points: 67</p><br/><p>He was shocked at what was written on the third page of the encyclopedia. How could he explain such knowledge to others? Furthermore, even if he did try to explain, only a handful of people would understand him.</p><br/><p>Weibo.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan realized that there was something wrong with Weibo. The number of people that were discussing the Han Lu &amp; Lei Lei fight was increasing at a rapid rate.</p><br/><p>Orange Crop: \"This Han Lu is too amazing, he KO-ed Lei Lei in just 11 seconds.\"</p><br/><p>The Poor with no Privilege: \"This guy is too d*mn arrogant. Lei Lei has already said on his Weibo that he had no intention of harming the other party's life. Hence, he didn't use his inner power. If he had used it, he would definitely have thrashed Han Lu.\"</p><br/><p>Cabbage CC: \"Stop with your blind talk, Han Lu is an awesome fighter who's beaten so many people. These people are no match for him.\"</p><br/><p>His Weibo suddenly became a discussion page for these people. Lin Fan was curious as to what was happening. Then, he did a search and saw a video. After which, he could only think of one thing. It was too cruel and violent. Han Lu KO-ed Lei Lei so quickly and easily. If he was the one who was fighting Han Lu, he would definitely be slaughtered too.</p><br/><p>At first, when he had read the article, he had still been full of confidence. The third page of Encyclopedic knowledge was Ba Gua Zhang. He thought that he could probably beat Han Lu with ease. However, after watching the video, he didn't even think of fighting Han Lu anymore. The punches would land directly onto his body and it would be extremely painful. It would probably be better to not do anything about it.</p><br/><p>Then, Lin Fan sent out a Weibo message to update his followers. He said, \"Actually, I'm also a master of Ba Gua Zhang.\"</p><br/><p>In just a short moment, there was a reply.</p><br/><p>Ximen Novice: \"Master, you should stick to fortune-telling. We shouldn't be involved with such barbaric people.\"</p><br/><p>Uncertain Fate: \"Stop bragging. I admire you so much, Master Lin. Master, I recently went to my friend's salon to perm my hair and he colored my hair green. Is he telling me something by doing that?\"</p><br/><p>\"666\u2026 Your friend must be a true friend that's expressing his love for you.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan felt really helpless from looking at these comments. The third task was to become a renown Master Lin. How would he go about doing that?</p><br/><p>Forget it. he thought that he shouldn't be worrying about things like this. Everything will be alright in the end. He wanted to just forget about fighting with others as he was afraid of pain.</p><br/><p>Just when Lin Fan wanted to switch off his phone to sleep, Autumn Sword Fish Killer made a sudden appearance.</p><br/><p>Autumn Sword Fish Killer: \"You're a master of Ba Gua Zhang? How shameless.\"</p><br/><p>Autumn Sword Fish Killer: \"Just one punch from Han Lu is sufficient to break your face.\"</p><br/><p>\"Everyone, prepare your melon seeds and water to watch the fight started by the reappearance of the Flame War Emperor.\"</p><br/><p>\"The Flame War Emperor with limitless saliva, who could destroy him? This fight will surely excite the ignorant commoners.\"</p><br/><p>Autumn Sword Fish Killer, \"Sigh, forget it. Let life be as beautiful as summer flowers and death like autumn leaves. I did not lose to you, I just lost to harsh reality.\"</p><br/><p>\"666\u2026 The Chief of Internet Trolls loves to write idioms when an argument breaks out. Not everyone can have such a stinky attitude.\"</p><br/><p>\"The Flame War Emperor has an undeserved reputation. We should all clap to compliment him instead.\"</p><br/><p>Autumn Sword Fish Killer had become well-known on Lin Fan's Weibo. He had already been arguing with Lin Fan since the time when he only had less than 100 followers. Each battle was ruthless and unforgiving.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan felt that the comments made by the Chief of Internet Trolls were weird and it looked as if he couldn't care any less. Lin Fan was hesitant but in the end, he sighed and just sent out a private message to him. \"Autumn Sword, you're a good guy. Let me read your fortune for you. The nurse that's always been taking care of you is fated to be your wife. Please confess your love for her tonight at 9 pm sharp. Believe me, your life will be changed instantly.\"</p><br/><p>Autumn Sword Fish Killer was still lying on his bed in the ward as he stared blankly at the ceiling, thinking about the Meng Meng incident which left him heartbroken. When he saw the message, his eyes lit up. He knew that Master Lin really had powers but after all, he was Chief Autumn Sword. He had never done something that made him regret in his life. He would never back down to things like that. If he decided to roast someone forever, he wouldn't change his mind just because the person does something for him.</p><br/><p>Autumn Sword just replied, \"Get lost!\"</p><br/><p>Just these two words were enough to show Autumn Sword Fish Killer's attitude towards Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>He looked at the time on his phone and it was 8:30. Autumn Sword Fish Killer didn't bother about Weibo anymore. He opened up his Baidu search engine and looked for love confessions. After reading tons of such confessions, he was truly moved.</p><br/><p>\"Fraud, if my confession is a success today, I will flame you less in future.\"</p><br/><p>Autumn Sword Fish Killer had been well taken care of by a nurse in the hospital for the past few days. She was young, pretty and gentle. Her soft voice melted his heart whenever she spoke to him.</p><br/><p>At 9 pm sharp.</p><br/><p>The nurse helped Autumn Sword with his drip and smiled sweetly before leaving the room. When she left, Autumn Sword Fish Killer removed the needle.</p><br/><p>Although he was unhappy with Master Lin, based on past observations, he really was a capable fortune-teller. From the looks of it, it looked like Master Lin really wanted to talk things over with him. Since he said that his life would be changed at 9 pm, he wanted to take the opportunity and not miss it.</p><br/><p>As he thought of bedding with her in future, Autumn Sword was a little excited. He opened the door and walked to the aisle of the wards. The bulky hospital attire did not stop him from what he had wanted to do.</p><br/><p>\"Jing Jing, stay there!\" Autumn Sword Fish Killer shouted at the door.</p><br/><p>Then, the quiet walkway became even quieter. Some of the nurses looked at him curiously.</p><br/><p>Jing Jing turned and looked at Autumn Sword Fish Killer.</p><br/><p>*clattering sounds*</p><br/><p>Autumn Sword Fish Killer went down on one knee and said, \"Jing Jing, if you were the sky, I'd be the wind. The weather may change but my love for you will never change. I love you, Jing Jing. Will you be my girlfriend?\"</p><br/><p>*sounds of people vomiting and screaming for help*</p><br/><p>Upon hearing that, Jing Jing's face turned pale and she ran away without even looking back. Autumn Sword Fish Killer just stood there speechless, with his eyes and mouth opened wide. Then, he angrily went into his room and texted Lin Fan privately.</p><br/><p>\"F*ck your mum, Fraud. I, Autumn Sword Fish Killer will do nothing else but make life hell for you.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was preparing to sleep and when he received the message, he replied instantly, \"If you can regain the powers of being the unbeatable Flame War Emperor, I will be gladly waiting.\"</p><br/><p>Autumn Sword Fish Killer replied. \"You're a f*cking dog, just you wait. I will lead my army and crumble your Weibo.\"</p><br/><p>Autumn Sword Fish Killer was filled with determination and rage. He simply couldn't tolerate it anymore.</p><br/><p>But Lin Fan just laughed it off and thought that if he could help an aimless sheep like Autumn Sword to find his determination again, it would be worth it. If he didn't end up in hell, who else would? Regardless of whether he would end up in hell, he still had to sleep. Then, he switched off his phone and went to bed.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

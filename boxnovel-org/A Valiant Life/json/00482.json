Then, he shouted, \u201cWang Zhen.\u201d</p><br/><p>From the doorway, a young man came out and started looking around. After hearing his name being called, he could not help going out to look. He let out a smile and then walked to Lin Fan\u2019s side and looked at him from top to bottom before saying, \u201cYou\u2019ve become f*cking awesome. Who would have thought this scallion pancake business would make you famous?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, who was the one who said that selling those scallion pancakes wasn\u2019t good back then?\u201d Lin Fan teased.</p><br/><p>Wang Zhen shook his head and said, \u201cThat wasn\u2019t my intention. I just thought that it wasn\u2019t good enough, I never thought that you would really become famous from that. Come, let\u2019s go up, you\u2019re the last one.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan asked, \u201cChen Xiang has reached already?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe reached at least 10 minutes earlier than you. I\u2019m the only one still here waiting for you to arrive. Looking at this, you have to make me a scallion pancake later for me to try and to see if it really is that good,\u201d Wang Zhen laughed and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo problem,\u201d Lin Fan replied. It was just a small request, definitely not a problem.</p><br/><p>However, the thing that made Lin Fan a little suspicious was that he did not mention him being a godly doctor. Could it be that they were not aware of it yet?</p><br/><p>That was indeed the case. They really had no idea of it.</p><br/><p>After all, the internet had only been mentioning Godly Doctor. If you did not pay enough attention, you would not know his name.</p><br/><p>They reached the private room in an instant. The moment Lin Fan stepped in, a countless number of eyes just locked straight onto him, he had the attention of every single person.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved with humility and said, \u201cHello, my fellow classmates.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWow, the famous man is here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe king of scallion pancakes has arrived, everyone, welcome him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBullsh*t.\u201d Chen Xiang glanced at Lin Fan and did not want to acknowledge him at all. However, on the inside, he was pretty curious, wondering what was so special about those scallion pancakes that could make Lin Fan become so popular.</p><br/><p>They had not really paid much attention to Lin Fan but the classmates had seen many links online saying that Lin Fan was very popular on Weibo. From the links they saw, they knew that this youngster was not only a fortune-teller but he was also selling scallion pancakes and had massively boosted his reputation. Many of them simply could not comprehend this and thought it was outrageous.</p><br/><p>\u201cHappy birthday, Teacher Xia. This is the gift I\u2019ve prepared for you,\u201d Lin Fan smiled and said.</p><br/><p>Teacher Xia accepted the gift and her face was full of smiles when she said, \u201cLil\u2019 Fan, it\u2019s good enough that you\u2019re here but you\u2019re even giving me a present. What is it? A painting?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded and said, \u201cYeah, I drew it myself to show my appreciation. I hope that you take good care of it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although he was not famous in the Chinese Art industry, this piece of art was highly valuable but there was no demand for it. If he were to make another, it might be in demand in future, but it would become priceless as well.</p><br/><p>Chen Xiang glanced at it and said, \u201cIt\u2019s just a painting by you, not even comparable to one done by a three-year-old.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan stared at Chen Xiang and said, \u201cDon\u2019t look down on me. Who was the one who said he wanted to buy two day\u2019s worth of scallion pancakes from me? My scallion pancakes are priceless and if you want to buy them you\u2019d go bankrupt.\u201d</p><br/><p>Teacher Xia laughed and said, \u201cOkay, okay, don\u2019t argue. I\u2019ll take care of this painting and I\u2019ll hang it in my study room.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed and said, \u201cTo have my painting hung on Teacher Xia\u2019s wall is definitely a huge honor.\u201d</p><br/><p>The dinner party began. Everyone had not seen each other in a long time so naturally, there was a lot of talk going on.</p><br/><p>After graduating, they had all gone down many different paths. Some of them had gone back to work for their parents, some had gone to do office work. Their topic of conversations went from what games they had been playing recently to what they were doing at work.</p><br/><p>Teacher Xia stood up and said, \u201cStudents, you guys carry on talking without me. There\u2019s another table next door that I have to attend to.\u201d</p><br/><p>The group of them replied, \u201cTeacher, we can chat by ourselves, go do what you have to do.\u201d</p><br/><p>Teacher Xia left the room and then Wang Zhen said, \u201cLooks like Teacher Xia is eating with her husband next door.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cLet\u2019s talk among ourselves. Wang Zhen, you left work early tonight. If your boss finds out, will he make life difficult for you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Zhen had had a few drinks so he could not help retorting, \u201cDoes he dare to? If he dares to make life difficult for me, then I\u2019ll tell his wife about him going to the red light district.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha,\u201d everyone could not help laughing.</p><br/><p>\u201cLin Fan, how\u2019s your scallion pancake business in Shanghai?\u201d Wang Zhen asked.</p><br/><p>The rest of the students were also all looking at Lin Fan. They were all very curious. Especially when they had found out that Lin Fan had blown up on Weibo, they had all been extremely shocked. It was as if they had seen a ghost. It was way too drastic of a change.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled and said, \u201cNow that you mention it, I brought some of my products for you all to sample. Today I\u2019ll let you all see what good food is and what you all have been missing out on.\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, everyone could not help getting excited.</p><br/><p>Chen Xiang glared at him and said, \u201cMissing out? I won\u2019t try it even if it kills me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Back when they were schooling, the two of them nearly had a huge fight. Now that they had all graduated and experienced life outside, they were all very reminiscent of the times back when they were schooling and when they met up, there was nothing they were too embarrassed to talk about.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou guys just wait here, I\u2019ll go get it now and I\u2019ll be back quickly. There\u2019s a total of thirteen people here and once I\u2019ve let you guys try it, you\u2019ll remember it forever,\u201d after saying this, Lin Fan ran off.</p><br/><p>Inside the private room, everyone was all in laughter and conversation.</p><br/><p>\u201cChen Xiang, I think that you should just forget about your past disputes with Lin Fan.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Xiang downed half his glass of white wine and said, \u201cDo you guys really think it\u2019s possible? There was a time back then that we beat each other till we almost had to go to the hospital. Making up is not a possibility.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI guess it isn\u2019t but those are all things in the past so you shouldn\u2019t take it to heart. It\u2019s only on occasions like this, Teacher Xia\u2019s birthday, that we meet up and look at how few people there are. A lot of them said they don\u2019t have time to meet up and judging by what I see, it\u2019ll be hard for us to meet up again. After today, we\u2019ll all be scattered around the country and I have no idea when we\u2019ll see each other again,\u201d one of the students said.</p><br/><p>Everyone was deep in silence. What he said was right. Although they could not see eye to eye back then in school, now that they had seen each other after so long, they should just let go of the things in the past.</p><br/><p>After a while, Lin Fan came back holding a plate. He was pretty surprised that he was able to make the scallion pancakes here in this hotel.</p><br/><p>Anyway, it did not really matter where he was. As long as he had the ingredients, he could make his delicious scallion pancakes.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled and said, \u201cLook, I\u2019ve made my scallion pancakes for you all. However, you have been warned, once you\u2019ve eaten them, it\u2019s not that easy to get your hands on another.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCheh, is that for real? Are they gonna make us addicted to it or something?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Xiang said with disdain, \u201cIsn\u2019t it just a scallion pancake? What could be so special about it? Where I\u2019m from, it\u2019s eight dollars a piece.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan put down the scallion pancakes and laughed, \u201cEight dollars is okay, in fact, any amount of money is okay. But do you dare to try one bite?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Xiang looked at Lin Fan and said, \u201cI\u2019ll never eat it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan calmly said, \u201cIf you\u2019re so good then take one bite and put it down afterward. If you can do that then I\u2019ll call you Big Brother.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone started to get riled up.</p><br/><p>\u201cChen Xiang, all you have to do is eat one mouth and put it down and Lin Fan will call you Big Brother.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, if it were me, I\u2019d definitely eat a bite.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMan up, don\u2019t be scared. It\u2019s just one bite, what\u2019s the big deal.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Xiang looked at the crowd and said, \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll eat a bite. After this, you\u2019ll call me Big Brother.\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, Chen Xiang took a scallion pancake from the plate and said, \u201cLook carefully. Regardless of the taste, I\u2019m just going to take one bite and put it down.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan confidently said, \u201cGo.\u201d</p><br/><p>If he was able to put it down after one bite, Lin Fan would respect his willpower.</p></div>\n</div>"}

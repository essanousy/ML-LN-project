He didn\u2019t tell me about this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGrandpa Zhao\u2026\u201d The children immediately ran over excitedly when they saw Zhao Ming Qing. Usually, Grandpa Zhao would come here to check on their bodies. He would even teach them some knowledge about Chinese Medicine. The children really liked him very much.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing smiled with his eyes squinted. He quickly took out a bag. It seemed that he had come prepared.</p><br/><p>He gave the children one red packet each.</p><br/><p>People who dared to come to the Children\u2019s Welfare Institute for a New Year visit were all wealthy people and courageous people. Without giving at least ten thousand dollars, they wouldn\u2019t be able to leave.</p><br/><p>\u201cLil\u2019 Fan, what\u2019s going on?\u201d asked Mama Lin worriedly. Had her son cheated this old man? This man was so old but he was her son\u2019s disciple. If other people knew about this, wouldn\u2019t he be scolded?</p><br/><p>Lin Fan knew why his Mom was asking this. He smiled, \u201cMom, it\u2019s not a problem. Ming Qing is the Director of the Chinese Medical Academy. He studies Chinese Medicine and my Chinese Medical achievements are greater, so I took him as my disciple so we can discuss Chinese Medicine together.\u201d</p><br/><p>In the past, Zhao Ming Qing might not have been the best in the country at Chinese Medicine but after this period of learning, he had basically obtained that title of the best. Of course, that\u2019s if you don\u2019t take Lin Fan into consideration.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen did you learn Chinese Medicine?\u201d Mama Lin looked at Lin Fan in surprise. She felt that this son of her\u2019s was too mysterious. Why hadn\u2019t she known about all this in the past?</p><br/><p>However, all parents hope for their children to be amazing. Hence, she was very pleased.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing looked at his teacher\u2019s parents and went forward to warmly greet them. This greeting made Papa Lin and Mama Lin a little embarrassed but to Zhao Ming Qing, it was only right.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing\u2019s children sighed. They had become used to their father being the disciple of a young man and they had accepted it. They understood Lin Fan\u2019s abilities. He was really a talented and knowledgeable person.</p><br/><p>However, he was just too young. When they weren\u2019t with their father, they didn\u2019t feel much but under their father\u2019s gaze, they could only force themselves to go forward and deliver their New Year wishes.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, we\u2019re here to pay you a New Year visit.\u201d At that moment, cars arrived outside.</p><br/><p>He Cheng Han had come with his son.</p><br/><p>He was now very pleased with his son. His son had started working from the very bottom of his company and become more mature. This was all thanks to Master Lin.</p><br/><p>If Master Lin hadn\u2019t given him counsel, he would probably never have seen his son turn over a new leaf.</p><br/><p>\u201cHappy New Year, Chief He,\u201d said Lin Fan with a smile.</p><br/><p>Soon after, the entrepreneurial bosses arrived. This made the Welfare Institute become even more lively and each of them had brought red packets for the children.</p><br/><p>As for how much there was in each red packet, who knew? But each person had probably tens of thousands in total into those red packets.</p><br/><p>This put Lin Fan at a loss for words.</p><br/><p>At night.</p><br/><p>Mama Lin had not recovered from the shock of what happened in the day. She had not thought that her son actually knew so many people.</p><br/><p>\u201cLil\u2019 Fan, who were those people that came today?\u201d asked Mama Lin.</p><br/><p>Looking at those people\u2019s vehicles and clothing, they were clearly not average people. Moreover, they gave so generously and were so friendly with Lin Fan as if they had known him for a long time.</p><br/><p>Papa Lin nodded, \u201cYeah, yeah. Although we don\u2019t know them, your Dad knows that all those cars were not cheap.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said helplessly, \u201cThey\u2019re all friends of mine and they\u2019re pretty good people. They knew that I didn\u2019t go back to our old home for the New Year so they came to pay a visit. No need to think too much. There\u2019s not much to it.\u201d</p><br/><p>These words managed to calm his parents down as they didn\u2019t know about the situation. But if outsiders were to find out about it, they would be shocked.</p><br/><p>If one was to kidnap any of those people, one would become rich.</p><br/><p>In fact, one would become very rich.</p><br/><p>\u201cMake sure you don\u2019t make friends with bad people,\u201d said Mama Lin worriedly.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry. How could you not trust your own son? These aren\u2019t bad people. They\u2019re all friends. And the fact that the Welfare Institute has been able to run so smoothly is thanks in part to their help as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good, that\u2019s good.\u201d After getting reassurance, his parents could relax for now.</p><br/><p>They were really afraid of their son meeting bad people or getting bad influence.</p><br/><p>The second day of the New Year.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan woke up early in the morning and prepared to drive back to Zhongzhou with his parents.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Wu You Lan and the rest were at the Welfare Institute, helping Director Huang to take care of the children.</p><br/><p>In Lin Fan\u2019s view, it seemed at after the New Year celebrations, it seemed that this New Year was going to be even better.</p><br/><p>He had to put in the extra effort and work hard as well.</p><br/><p>In the afternoon.</p><br/><p>They finally arrived in Zhongzhou.</p><br/><p>When they reached the apartment block, the air was filled with the flavor of Chinese New Year.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go. We\u2019re going to pay your Uncle Li a New Year visit.\u201d When they reached home, Papa Lin was in a pretty good mood. It seemed that he was very happy that he was going to see Elder Li.</p><br/><p>He had many things he wanted to say. He had experienced many things in Shanghai and he had to brag about them to Elder Li.</p><br/><p>Mama Lin scolded him, \u201cWe\u2019ve just got home and you can\u2019t wait to go to Elder Li\u2019s place already. Let me tell you, don\u2019t show off in front of him. There\u2019s nothing wrong if it\u2019s just you and Elder Li but his son and wife will be around as well. Don\u2019t let them have any bad opinions about us.\u201d</p><br/><p>Papa Lin said, \u201cI know. No need for you to tell me. I know it myself.\u201d</p><br/><p>Upstairs, they rang the doorbell.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Li, open up!\u201d Papa Lin shouted as he stood outside the entrance. Soon after, a voice came from inside, \u201cComing, coming.\u201d</p><br/><p>The door opened.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled, \u201cHappy New Year, Uncle Li.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, Lil\u2019 Fan is back. Come, come, come in.\u201d Uncle Li pushed the door open. Then, he shouted to his wife who was in the kitchen, \u201cLil\u2019 Fan and the rest are here. Hurry up and prepare some tea.\u201d</p><br/><p>A delighted voice came from the kitchen, \u201cLil\u2019 Fan and the rest are here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Li, let me tell you, this time that I went to Shanghai\u2026\u201d As Papa Lin was taking off his shoes, he couldn\u2019t help but want to talk about his experiences. But before he finished, he was interrupted by Mama Lin.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou talk too much. Shut up.\u201d</p><br/><p>Papa Lin laughed embarrassedly. Then, he sneakily glared at his wife. \u201cElder Li, let\u2019s talk later on.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was a little embarrassed as he stood at the side. \u201cUncle Li, please don\u2019t mind my Dad. That\u2019s just how he is.\u201d</p><br/><p>Uncle Li was in a pretty good mood. \u201cNo problem, no problem. That\u2019s how your Dad is. I\u2019ve known him for so many years. How could I now know?\u201d</p><br/><p>Papa Lin was pleased. \u201cHeard that? Elder Li doesn\u2019t mind it at all. It\u2019s just you two who care about all this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled and didn\u2019t say more. However, he was in a pretty good mood as well. His Mom was really right about his Dad. His Dad didn\u2019t have many friends and Uncle Li was indeed the most reliable.</p><br/><p>When a person reaches his middle years, he has to have a few friends to brag to and maintain a carefree heart. That way, he would be free of diseases.</p><br/><p>After entering the house.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked around and asked in a puzzled tone, \u201d Uncle Li, where are Brother Li and his wife?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey went out to do something. They should be back soon,\u201d said Uncle Li.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh\u2026\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

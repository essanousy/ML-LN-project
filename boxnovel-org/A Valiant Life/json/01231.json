He just left with the others.</div><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang went forward and patted Lin Fan\u2019s shoulders. \u201cBro, that was cool. That\u2019s how you should treat people like him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want to talk. I just have a toothache,\u201d Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>\u201cI know, I know,\u201d Wang Ming Yang replied. He did not want to expose him further.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuan Yue, all the best! Don\u2019t let your efforts go to waste.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue nodded. \u201cI will do my best.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s time. We have to board the plane,\u201d her agent, Yang Qian, said.</p><br/><p>In a distance away.</p><br/><p>Director Zhang was initially smiling, but he seemed gloomy now. \u201cWhat Master Lin? He\u2019s just a lousy crowd favourite. Jin Can, you don\u2019t have to win the prize. You just have to beat Wu Huan Yue to avenge us.\u201d</p><br/><p>He was really unhappy. He had not expected Master Lin to be so cocky. He had wanted to greet him, but Lin Fan had spoken to him rudely.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2019s lucky to have Master Lin who is a capable man that can write Chinese songs for her to become famous. If not for him, she wouldn\u2019t even have achieved whatever she has today. This time, it\u2019s English songs. How can his songs compare to what Teacher Zheng wrote for me?\u201d Jin Can said with confidence.</p><br/><p>As for the songs written by Master Lin, she did not really care about them. What was there to worry about? She felt that the songs would definitely not be as good as what Zheng Ya wrote even if she were to hire another writer.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, it was impossible for Zheng Ya to know nothing about the writers of the songs since Zheng Ya was a prominent figure in the industry.</p><br/><p>Zheng Ya smiled confidently. He was really confident of the songs that he wrote. He did not dare to claim that Jin Can would definitely win an award in the competition, but he felt that she would definitely have no problem suppressing Wu Huan Yue.</p><br/><p>On the airplane.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan and the others met Director Zhang and his group of friends again. However, they did not talk to each other at all.</p><br/><p>In the United States.</p><br/><p>When they arrived, Lin Fan felt a little uncomfortable. He did not understand what the people around them were talking about.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Lin, do you really not understand?\u201d Zhao Zhong Yang asked sneakily.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cDo you understand?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang made some hand gestures and said, \u201cI only understand a little bit.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yang Qian said, \u201cLet\u2019s head to the hotel.\u201d</p><br/><p>Most of them were there for the first time. Fraud Tian looked around. \u201cWhat\u2019s so special about this place? It looks like Shanghai.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you regret coming now?\u201d Lin Fan asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cA little. I\u2019m here to support Wu Huan Yue, so I\u2019m not regretting anything at all,\u201d Fraud Tian replied. Then, he continued looking around curiously.</p><br/><p>When he arrived at the hotel.</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang immediately went online to broadcast to the netizens.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh d*mn, where is Brother Yang at?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Yang, the hotel room looks amazing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut something\u2019s wrong. Why does it seem like it\u2019s night time over there?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang smiled. \u201cBrothers, I\u2019m in the United States. Look who is with me.\u201d</p><br/><p>When the camera was turned, the netizens saw Master Lin and were stunned.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, Master Lin and Brother Yang are sharing a room. Is Brother Yang going to sell his body?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a big piece of news. Let\u2019s just start by donating some presents first.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang looked at the screen helplessly. \u201cBros, what are you thinking? I\u2019m not selling my body. I\u2019m here with Master Lin and the rest to support Wu Huan Yue. You have to remember this. I will be broadcasting it live on the actual day of the competition.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c6666\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, I\u2019ll definitely be watching.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWait, that\u2019s weird. When Brother Yang is broadcasting it, won\u2019t it be past midnight here? F*ck, are we all going to lose sleep to watch the broadcast?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. What\u2019s so good about sleep? The broadcast is so much more interesting.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang took his phone and said, \u201cBrothers, I\u2019ll let you know the latest news. If it\u2019s really past midnight in China, just watch it in the morning. This time, I really brought professional equipment here to stream at the highest quality possible. Look at what I brought\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The camera shifted to the large bags beside him.</p><br/><p>\u201c666\u2026 Brother Yang is going to show his might.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha, I\u2019m definitely going to watch the broadcast. Is anyone going to join me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at Zhao Zhong Yang broadcasting so happily, so he did not want to bother him. Then, he walked to the other room.</p><br/><p>Outside of China, Wu Huan Yue was not like her usual self. She covered herself well, and not many people could recognise her here.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuan Yue, are you nervous?\u201d Lin Fan asked Wu Huan Yue as he saw her sitting anxiously in a corner.</p><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue nodded. \u201cYeah, a little.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan patted Wu Huan Yue on her head. \u201cDon\u2019t be too nervous. Just treat it like any other competition when you\u2019re on stage.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Wu Huan Yue heaved a sigh. \u201cI will condition myself.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yang Qian smiled after hearing that. Who said that celebrities would not be nervous? Huan Yue had conducted a few concerts overseas, but she was still a little nervous for this competition. It was amusing.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, Huan Yue, take a deep breath. It will be okay,\u201d Yang Qian said as she sniggered.</p><br/><p>\u201cSister Yang, are you laughing at me?\u201d Wu Huan Yue asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cNope, definitely not.\u201d Yang Qian immediately waved her hand. However, she could not hide the smile on her face. Then, she burst out laughing. \u201cActually, you\u2019ve had so many concerts before. How could you still be nervous? If your fans were to find out about it, they would definitely laugh at you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Soon, it was the day of the competition.</p><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue was the best singer in China, and she would definitely attract a lot of attention in this competition. However, as it was hosted in another country, she did not have many fans here.</p><br/><p>The other foreign celebrities entered the venue hurriedly with the help of the security guards.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He heard familiar voices.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan turned around and realised that it was a group of reporters.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat brings you here today?\u201d He asked in disbelief. They were all familiar reporters from Shanghai.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe have to be here since you\u2019re here. We literally spent the entire day to rush here for the news. Thank God we made it.\u201d A reporter chuckled.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re here to broadcast it?\u201d Lin Fan asked.</p><br/><p>The reporters shook their heads. \u201cNope, we\u2019re here to interview you. We can\u2019t enter the venue since we did not receive an invitation for it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled. \u201cAlright, let\u2019s have an interview then. We will answer some questions since all of you travelled such a long way.\u201d</p><br/><p>In a distance away.</p><br/><p>Jin Can looked at Wu Huan Yue who was being interviewed, and she was pretty unhappy about it.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid these reporters not notice me?\u201d Director Zhang said unhappily.</p><br/><p>Zheng Ya looked at them and replied, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. Those are small reporters. Perhaps they even bought them for publicity. Just do your best in the competition later.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Jin Can nodded confidently.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

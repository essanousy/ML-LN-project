Initially, it had only been a dispute among the Chinese Medical Academies but now, the public had joined in.</p><br/><p>However, the Chinese Medical Association, Zhou Qing Quan and the rest, were fervently supporting Zhao Ming Qing. They had a rather good relationship and Zhou Qing Quan could roughly guess what was going on.</p><br/><p>The teaching materials were probably being written by Master Lin.</p><br/><p>But Zhao Ming Qing didn\u2019t say this openly and it seemed like he was worried about something. If it was to be written by Master Lin, Zhou Qing Quan and the rest would be in great anticipation, wondering what kind of masterpiece would be produced.</p><br/><p>Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>Whenever there was nothing to do, Lin Fan would sit there, writing the teaching materials. Regarding the understanding of Chinese medicine, there was probably no one who was more familiar than Lin Fan. After all, the Encyclopedia was so perverse. If there were still people who could still match him, that would be as shocking as seeing a ghost.</p><br/><p>Huh!</p><br/><p>While taking a break, since Lin Fan had a computer now he naturally had to be using Weibo on his computer. However, when he saw the trending news, he couldn\u2019t help but be surprised.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy is Ming Qing disputing with other Chinese doctors?\u201d Lin Fan\u2019s heart started thumping as he wondered what the heck was going on.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian looked over, \u201cIsn\u2019t that your student, the Chinese Medical Academy\u2019s Director? Why is he trending? It looks like he\u2019s even disputing with Chinese doctors. That\u2019s strange.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d Lin Fan didn\u2019t say anything as he went through the web pages.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan and the rest gathered by Lin Fan\u2019s side, looking at the news on the screen.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis matter is quite huge, replacing the old teaching materials. No wonder it\u2019s drawing conflict from so many people.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTeaching materials are all decided by the Education Department. This disciple of yours is replacing the academy\u2019s teaching materials on his own accord, of course he\u2019d be flamed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian said analytically, \u201cThese old teaching materials have been used for a long time and they\u2019ve pretty much been regarded as godly books. Trying to change them without consent is simply asking for trouble.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said in a strange tone, \u201cThe way you said that, it sounds like you understand this a lot.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian said confidently, \u201cWell, of course. I, Tian, have seen every aspect of society.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan knew that Lin Fan would not just leave this be. \u201cYou\u2019re still writing the teaching materials now. What do you plan to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t even need to think about that. Ming Qing is my disciple. Since my disciple is being flamed, I, as the teacher, will not stand this. I have to do something. Aren\u2019t they saying on Weibo that the new teaching materials will be rubbish? I\u2019ll shut all of them up.\u201d Lin Fan was pissed.</p><br/><p>Weren\u2019t these people just not giving him any face? After that voluntary medical practice incident, anyone who had noticed would know that Zhao Ming Qing was one of Lin Fan\u2019s people. By flaming Zhao Ming Qing like that, they were simply not giving Lin Fan face.</p><br/><p>And what happens to people who don\u2019t give Lin Fan face?</p><br/><p>It was needless to say that they would suffer a tragic fate.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan sent out a Weibo post.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello, everyone. Excuse me, I\u2019m the writer of the new Chinese Medicine foundational teaching materials. Those who said that what I\u2019m writing is rubbish, we can interact a little. Even if you all are Western doctors, it\u2019s fine. I\u2019m very proficient in both. But don\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t embarrass you all too much. This is all I have to say. I\u2019m going to continue writing the teaching materials. If you\u2019re unhappy, then come to me. Also, as for those descendants of the old Chinese doctors, do whatever you should be doing. The reformation of Chinese Medicine foundational teaching materials is necessary. Your grandfathers and ancestors have made a huge contribution to Chinese medicine, so I don\u2019t want to say too much.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Done and dusted.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian said dully, \u201cWill there be any problems if you say it like that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shrugged. \u201cWhat problems could there be? I didn\u2019t even boast. If there really are people that come and challenge me, I\u2019d be happy to entertain them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang sighed, \u201cBrother Lin, you really are awesome.\u201d</p><br/><p>They all knew how great Brother Lin\u2019s medical abilities were. There was probably no one that could match him.</p><br/><p>If they were unhappy, then they would get screwed. There was no need to speak any nonsense.</p><br/><p>He had said it so bluntly, without any respect for them. He wasn\u2019t afraid of being attacked or being challenged.</p><br/><p>After this Weibo post was sent out, waves were instantly made on the Internet.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, the main plot is out. The writer of the new teaching materials is Master Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a little scary.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin is pissed and he\u2019s flaming people. Those guys actually said that Master Lin\u2019s writing is rubbish. Isn\u2019t that just a slap to the face?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnyone with eyes would know that Master Lin\u2019s medical skills are great. If Master Lin is writing, then I feel that it\u2019s going to be very reliable.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, I paid attention to Master Lin\u2019s voluntary medical practice. He was really amazing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI told you so. Director Zhao, as an old Chinese doctor, would not replace the teaching materials for no reason. There must be a reason. Master Lin\u2019s medical skills are so great. Teaching materials written by him would definitely be earth-shaking.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat makes sense.\u201d</p><br/><p>Education Department.</p><br/><p>\u201cThose teaching materials are written by him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen it\u2019s hard to say. This man\u2019s medical abilities defy nature. You all know about the voluntary medical practice incident. That was insane.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s not involve ourselves in this for now. Wait till the teaching materials are out, then we\u2019ll talk.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally, Zhao Ming Qing. If it was being written by the godly doctor, why didn\u2019t he say so earlier?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho knows?\u201d</p><br/><p>Fellow Chinese doctors of the same profession.</p><br/><p>Most of them had been shut up. Although they had never met Lin Fan before, they knew of his \u2018Godly Doctor\u2019 title.</p><br/><p>To them, this young man was quite terrifying. His medical skills were too strong and they simply couldn\u2019t compare to him.</p><br/><p>Those Chinese doctors in the Chinese Medical Association, in particular, knew just how amazing this godly doctor was. The \u2018Various Types of Typhoid\u2019 that they were currently studying had come from this man. Its contents were very detailed while also easy to understand. The book opened many new doors on their path of Chinese medicine.</p><br/><p>If faced with such a master-level Chinese doctor, they would all be powerless.</p><br/><p>Moreover, he had even said that anyone who was unhappy could go to him. Challenging a godly doctor in medical skills was simply asking for pain.</p><br/><p>There was complete silence.</p><br/><p>No one was grumbling anymore. They all pretended to not know about this incident.</p><br/><p>When Zhao Ming Qing saw his teacher\u2019s Weibo, he was stunned. Then, he felt touched.</p><br/><p>To him, his teacher must not have been able to stand to see him get flamed, so his teacher stood up and backed him up. This\u2026this\u2026</p><br/><p>It\u2019s so touching!</p><br/><p>However, if Zhao Ming Qing knew that his most-respected teacher was only furious because people said that what he was writing was rubbish, who knew what kind of thoughts Zhao Ming Qing would have?</p><br/><p>Lin Fan\u2019s number of followers on Weibo was over five million. It was still much lower than some big superstars but he could already be considered a famous person.</p><br/><p>Even netizens who were clueless as to what was going on would become involved.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho do you think you are? They\u2019re talking about Chinese medicine. Do you even know anything?\u201d</p><br/><p>Just after this comment was sent, a large number of people immediately replied.</p><br/><p>\u201c^ did your family just get an Internet connection? Go and do a Baidu search on Master Lin before talking nonsense.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are idiots every year but there seem to be especially many this year. You don\u2019t even know who\u2019s the Godly Doctor and you come to his Weibo to flame him. Your home should be blown up.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. The Godly Doctor definitely doesn\u2019t know about Chinese medicine.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMmm, that\u2019s very reasonable. I give you full marks.\u201d</p><br/><p>That netizen had initially just wanted to express his own opinion but he never thought that he would get flamed so much in just an instant.</p><br/><p>This didn\u2019t f*cking make sense.</p><br/><p>Didn\u2019t everyone on the Internet hate people who thought they were amazing?</p><br/><p>This didn\u2019t seem right at all.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

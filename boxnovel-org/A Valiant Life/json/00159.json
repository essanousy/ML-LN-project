Little Boss is ill and needs to rest for a week.\"</p><br/><p>\"Ahhh, how sad.\"</p><br/><p>\"I'm a little upset. How could the Little Boss do that? Could it be that the recent happenings have made Little Boss arrogant? Now he's only selling when he feels like it!\"</p><br/><p>\"I feel that Little Boss has gotten arrogant too. He was just fine yesterday, how could he have become ill in just a day?\"</p><br/><p>\"That's enough! You guys can rest when you want, so why can't Little Boss rest too?\"</p><br/><p>\"It's just ten servings of scallion pancakes a day. It's so simple! Why would he need rest?\"</p><br/><p>Some of the townsfolk were confused and some of them were becoming unhappy. They felt that those guys were going overboard. The Little Boss could rest whenever he wanted. He even pasted a notice on the wall. Surely, something had happened, otherwise, he wouldn't have done that. It was surely not as bad as they were saying.</p><br/><p>One of the townsfolk questioned Fraud Tian, \"Did something happen to the Little Boss?\"</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian replied, \"It's nothing much. His hands are just injured and need some time to recover.\"</p><br/><p>\"Little Boss is a master. Why would he get injured?\"</p><br/><p>Another man said, \"Yeah! Are you lying to us?\"</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian frowned. He felt that these townsfolk were being unreasonable. Lin Fan's hands really were injured. Even if they weren't, couldn't he just take a break?</p><br/><p>One of the townsfolk said, \"Don't care about them. They're all crazy. If Little Boss is injured, then he should let his wound heal properly. It's just a week. We can wait.\"</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian laughed. Fortunately, there were some rational people among them. If they were all like those unreasonable townsfolk, it would have been depressing.</p><br/><p>\"Hey!\"</p><br/><p>\"Look, isn't this guy in the news the Little Boss?\"</p><br/><p>\"Huh? It really is him! This child rescuing case happened nearby, I think.\"</p><br/><p>\"Damn, that's crazy! Look, the door has been knocked down!\"</p><br/><p>The townsfolk started discussing among themselves. Then, they paused the video at a certain scene. It was the Little Boss's face. It had to be him.</p><br/><p>The eyes of the townsfolk all fell upon Fraud Tian as if to ask him if it was real.</p><br/><p>With a cigarette in his mouth, Fraud Tian raised his head and said calmly, \"That's your Little Boss. That door was too difficult to unlock and time was short, so he used his bare hands to knock the door down. In the process, his hands got injured and swelled up like radishes. He didn't want to be embarrassed, so he's not coming to the shop temporarily.\"</p><br/><p>\"You guys don't know this but even the hospital doctor said that he was lucky, otherwise, those hands would have been completely ruined. Sigh\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian's expression was very well done. He really looked heartbroken. However, his last sentence was entirely fabricated.</p><br/><p>All of their jaws dropped. They were astonished.</p><br/><p>Everyone knew about this matter, but the number of spectators there at the time was too many. They had no idea that the Little Boss was there too, much less that the Little Boss was the one who knocked down the door.</p><br/><p>\"Look, in order to rescue the child, Little Boss got his hands injured and even almost became crippled. You guys were even saying that the Little Boss is arrogant. I don't know how your hearts are so dark, to think so badly of him.\"</p><br/><p>\"I was there when it happened yesterday. The situation was dire. The child's head was stuck in the window grills. If he had come a little later, the child might have suffocated. I never thought that the one who saved the child was Little Boss. I heard that the family is looking for the savior. They want to thank the Little Boss.\"</p><br/><p>Those townsfolk who were doubtful of Lin Fan at first now had embarrassed looks on their faces.</p><br/><p>\"So that's what happened. We've misunderstood Little Boss.\"</p><br/><p>Some of the townsfolk had their heads down. They regretted what they had said earlier. It was too embarrassing. The Little Boss hurt himself while doing a good deed but they dared to say that the Little Boss was untruthful. They felt extremely remorseful.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>At the shopping center.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the clothes in front of him and nodded contentedly, \"These are pretty good. I'll definitely look a few years younger if I wore them.\"</p><br/><p>The saleswoman at the side giggled, \"Handsome, if you were any younger, you would be taking the college entrance exams.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed, \"Give me these.\"</p><br/><p>The saleswoman swiftly wrapped up the clothes. During payment, it was hard for Lin Fan to grab his money with his gloves on, so he removed them. Then, those fat, swollen hands were revealed. The salesperson was startled.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan noticed the sympathetic expression on the saleswoman's face and hurriedly tried to explain himself, \"Don't think of stupid things, pretty lady. There's a reason why my hands are like this.\"</p><br/><p>\"Okay, okay.\" The saleswoman nodded as if she understood.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan sighed. \"Forget it. I won't explain it. It'll only get more complicated. At least it's better than yesterday. It's less swollen already,\" he thought.</p><br/><p>On the internet.</p><br/><p>\"Someone, please tell me, are these special effects?\"</p><br/><p>\"Special effects my ass. Didn't you see the news?\"</p><br/><p>\"He unlocked that doorway too quickly. And that last part when he knocked down the door was simply terrifying.\"</p><br/><p>\"Yeah! How strong must he be to do that?\"</p><br/><p>\"Fortunately, the child was saved. This youngster has my praise.\"</p><br/><p>\"Respect. He's gained all my respect.\"</p><br/><p>\"Wait, don't you guys realize what this means?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yue Ma Locks!\"</p><br/><p>\"Supreme Tiger Electronic Fingerprint Doors!\"</p><br/><p>\"That A-list celebrity said that even a hundred master locksmiths couldn't open it. The reward money is $2,000,000.\"</p><br/><p>\"Yue Ma Lock, five hundred minutes\u2026\"</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>At the celebratory gathering for the employees of Supreme Tiger Electronic Fingerprint Doors.</p><br/><p>Countless employees had big smiles on their faces.

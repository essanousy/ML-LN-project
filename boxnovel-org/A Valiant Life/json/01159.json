This place had luxurious rooms and was also very well designed, so Brother Lin, Fraud Tian, and the rest could come down to play when they were bored.</p><br/><p>Moreover, everything was already arranged for them. There were people stationed outside the entrance. When Fraud Tian and the rest came, they were immediately welcomed by these people.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Lin, let\u2019s go in,\u201d said Yun Xue Yao with a smile.</p><br/><p>She was very happy and very excited. It really felt great to see Brother Lin again.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Jin Meng had caught up with them as well and she stayed by Yun Xue Yao\u2019s side. How could she not know who this man that her best friend liked was?</p><br/><p>On Weibo, this Master Lin had done countless things. Any one of those things was enough to shock people.</p><br/><p>Hence, even though he had no money or authority, he wasn\u2019t someone that should be messed with.</p><br/><p>The government would never let anyone bully Master Lin.</p><br/><p>He had already become a treasure of Shanghai. Those government leaders really wanted Master Lin to stay in Shanghai. It was best if he didn\u2019t go anywhere else.</p><br/><p>( Boxno vel. co m ) This was what she had found out after calling her Shanghainese friend.</p><br/><p>After all, Master Lin was a talent. And he wasn\u2019t just any talent. He was the kind of talent that only appeared once in a thousand years.</p><br/><p>No matter how much money one had, he or she could never be compared to Master Lin. Hence, Master Lin was exceptionally scary.</p><br/><p>Although there were frequently people who quarreled with Master Lin on the Internet, things always ended up badly for those people if they went overboard.</p><br/><p>Moreover, what terrified Jin Meng even more was how out-of-this-world Master Lin\u2019s gambling skills were. In Haojiang, anyone with a brain would know what that meant.</p><br/><p>Of course, this was what she had found out from Yun Xue Yao. She had heard from Xue Yao that, if it hadn\u2019t been for Master Lin\u2019s help, that incident from before would have ended terribly.</p><br/><p>The more she found out about this Master Lin, the more shocked Jin Meng became. She realized that this man simply was not human.</p><br/><p>If he was human, how could he know how to do so many things?</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is my first time here!\u201d At the entrance, Fraud Tian was thrilled. This was the first time he had left Shanghai and come to such a luxurious place.</p><br/><p>\u201cFraud, if you feel bored, I can get someone to bring you to the casino to play. I\u2019ve got you covered,\u201d said Yun Xue Yao with a smile.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian was taken aback. \u201cAlright, alright!\u201d</p><br/><p>If he had to use his own money to play, he would never do it. But since a wealthy lady was paying, he was glad to play.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cFraud, don\u2019t go overboard just because of what she said. If you lose too much money, you\u2019ll have to sell your a*s.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Fraud Tian was stunned. Then, he said, \u201cHow could that happen? I\u2019d only play with one thousand dollars at most. If I lose one thousand dollars, I guarantee that I\u2019ll stop.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing that, Lin Fan burst out laughing. <em>One thousand dollars? What the heck can you do with a thousand dollars?</em></p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Lin, let\u2019s go in,\u201d said Yun Xue Yao.</p><br/><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d</p><br/><p>The group of them walked inside.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, the people stationed there saw that Chief Yun was personally accompanying this group of people and they were very curious.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho was that person? Chief Yun is actually welcoming him personally.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t recognize him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Master Lin. You actually don\u2019t recognize him?\u201d at that moment, a middle-aged man came over and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh? Master Lin? Isn\u2019t he in Shanghai? And why does he know our Chief Yun?\u201d someone asked doubtfully. He couldn\u2019t quite understand what was going on.</p><br/><p>The middle-aged man smiled. \u201cYou must not know about this but Master Lin came to Haojiang once before. And he even helped us to resolve a big issue. Alright, enough talk. Just do your work properly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis Master Lin is my idol!\u201d</p><br/><p>The group of them walked towards the inside of the hotel. Meanwhile, Yun Xue Yao was busy ensuring that everyone\u2019s rooms were properly arranged. At the same time, she ordered her staff to be stationed outside their rooms, so that, whenever one of them came out, the staff would immediately receive them.</p><br/><p>In the toilet.</p><br/><p>Jin Meng asked, \u201cXue Yao, have you really fallen for him?\u201d</p><br/><p>As her confidant, she had to be clear about this. She was very concerned about this matter. After all, this situation was not a typical one. This Master Lin had many other women by his side and things didn\u2019t look very positive.</p><br/><p>Moreover, it seemed that one other person wasn\u2019t here yet.</p><br/><p>She had done a search on the Internet and found that there was a female celebrity who had an exceptional relationship with Master Lin. It was an intense competition.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you asking about that? It\u2019s not what you think,\u201d said Yun Xue Yao.</p><br/><p>Jin Meng said, \u201cStop pretending. How could I not know what you\u2019re thinking? But I have to say that it\u2019s very hard for you to win this kind of man.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy is that?\u201d Yun Xue Yao was taken aback. She was both curious and anxious.</p><br/><p>Jin Meng said, \u201cLook. Before you even knew him, he already knew a few other ladies. Moreover, in terms of looks, they\u2019re not inferior to you. Have they succeeded yet?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, they haven\u2019t. Although they look very close to him, I can tell that there is still a barrier between them that hasn\u2019t been broken down yet. They haven\u2019t slept together yet. This kind of situation is really scary. There can only be two possibilities.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, Jin Meng seemed to have turned into an expert as she meticulously analyzed the situation.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are the two possibilities?\u201d Yun Xue Yao had been drawn in by Jin Meng\u2019s words. She wondered what exactly Jin Meng was talking about.</p><br/><p>Jin Meng said, \u201cThe first possibility is that this Master Lin is gay. But we can eliminate this possibility because I\u2019ve already researched it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe second possibility is that this Master Lin is single-minded. And I can see from his eyes that he\u2019s at a loss. I can tell that he has feelings for not just one lady. Hence, he\u2019s now perplexed and he doesn\u2019t know how to choose. You may think that this Master Lin seems incredible but with regards to love, he is a beginner. He\u2019s a beginner who doesn\u2019t want to hurt anyone.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yun Xue Yao\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cJin Meng, how do you know all this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jin Meng said, \u201cWhat? Did you think that I learned nothing from studying abroad for those few years? Let me tell you. During those few years, I followed a professor and specialized in studying people\u2019s psychology and actions.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI also studied, with another professor, the probabilities of such situations. That\u2019s why I can see through your thoughts with one look.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd do you know why I still haven\u2019t gotten a boyfriend after coming back for so long? That\u2019s because I can see that those guys just want to have sex with me. Do they think I\u2019m stupid?\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, in Yun Xue Yao\u2019s mind, her impression of Jin Meng suddenly became greater.</p><br/><p>Initially, she had thought that Jin Meng had just gone overseas to play around for a few years. She hadn\u2019t thought that Jin Meng had actually learned such a skill. That was really amazing.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what should I do?\u201d asked Yun Xue Yao.</p><br/><p>Jin Meng shook her head. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to say. We have to look at the situation. In any case, if you ask me, people like him are hard to deal with. They have very strong willpower, so they won\u2019t act rashly even if they\u2019re drunk. After all, each of you has already presented yourself to him. If he had a weak will, he would have f*cked each of you long ago.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why you can only wait and see what he\u2019ll do. I can\u2019t help you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Yun Xue Yao really wanted to ask her something. <em>Who on Earth did you learn all this from? This is incredible!</em></p></div>\n</div>"}

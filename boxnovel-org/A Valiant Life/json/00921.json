Even though the interval between each item fished up was quite long, no one disturbed Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>The medicinal ingredients that he fished up made him very pleased.</p><br/><p>100-year-old ginseng, ling hua grass, and thousand-petaled flower.</p><br/><p>Apart from the 100-year-old ginseng, the rest of them didn\u2019t exist in this world.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was assessing the situation. Although the number of items he obtained wasn\u2019t high, he was lucky that most of them were medicinal herbs. He was now one step closer to the path of pill-crafting.</p><br/><p>He kept his things and prepared to leave.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-2\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>At that moment, by the river, a young lady was holding a selfie stick and pointing the lens at herself.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you, brothers, for your gifts. I love you very very much.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you, boss, for sending me a plane.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fang Qian was a Shanghai local. She was a very popular broadcaster on the Internet. Her broadcasting style was very cheery, so she was well-received by the fans.</p><br/><p>This time, she was doing an outdoor broadcast. She had come to the riverbank to let the fans see the sceneries of Shanghai.</p><br/><p>\u201cQian Qian, I heard that there are people who jump into this river every year.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fang Qian tidied up her hair a little before replying with a smile, \u201cBrothers, that\u2019s not true. Don\u2019t trust all these rumors on the Internet.\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-3\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m here to show you all the scenery. If any of you are interested, you can come to Shanghai to play in the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, Fang Qian pointed the lens at the riverbank to show her fans the riverbank view.</p><br/><p>Suddenly!</p><br/><p>The netizens in the broadcast room who had been chatting idly saw a figure in the distance and instantly cried out in shock.</p><br/><p>\u201cQian Qian, don\u2019t move. Don\u2019t move the camera. Is that person in front Master Lin?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhich Master Lin?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck. Are you really stupid or are you just pretending? You don\u2019t even know who Master Lin is? Besides that Master Lin in Shanghai, which other one is there?\u201d</p><br/><p>Fang Qian hadn\u2019t noticed at first but when she saw the comments, she was stunned.</p><br/><p>She was a Shanghai local. Of course, she knew who Master Lin was.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-4\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>In her heart, Master Lin was an extremely mystical person. Anyone who occasionally went on the Internet would see news related to Master Lin.</p><br/><p>Earlier on, that incident regarding Nanshan Children\u2019s Welfare Institute had caught her attention in particular.</p><br/><p>Initially, she had thought that Master Lin had been corrupted but she couldn\u2019t quite believe it. Eventually, when the truth came out, she heaved a sigh of relief.</p><br/><p>She had thought all along that Master Lin wasn\u2019t that kind of person.</p><br/><p>At this moment, she gazed forward as if she was trying hard to distinguish if it was him.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you think that person is really Master Lin?\u201d Fang Qian asked her fans in the broadcast room.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, hurry up and go take a look. If it really is him, this would be awesome!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough I always see Master Lin on the Internet, I\u2019ve never seen him in real life.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cQian Qian, hurry up and go take a look. It looks like Master Lin is about to leave. The opportunity is right in front of you. Don\u2019t let it slip away.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOnward goes the gifts. Onward goes Qian Qian.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Although she wasn\u2019t a crazy fan of Master Lin\u2019s, she was exceptionally curious about this person. Hence, without hesitation, she started running forward.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-5\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Lin Fan held his fishing rod as he walked towards the car park.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, he heard someone calling his name. He couldn\u2019t help but turn around to see who it was.</p><br/><p>When he saw the figure in front of him, he was stunned.</p><br/><p>The young lady was very young and she looked pretty good. She held a selfie stick in her hand, so he assumed that she was a broadcaster.</p><br/><p>In the broadcast room.</p><br/><p>The netizens were looking at that person in the broadcast. After confirming that it was Master Lin, they started becoming excited.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, it really is Master Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think that Master Lin would come fishing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-6\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>When Fang Qian saw that it was Master Lin, she was exhilarated. She ran over with a flushed face. Her excitement was written all over her face. \u201cIt really is Master Lin\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled. \u201cYou are\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHello, Master Lin. My name is Fang Qian. I\u2019m doing an outdoor broadcast now. When my Internet buddies said that it was you, I didn\u2019t believe it at first, so I came over to take a look. I didn\u2019t think that it actually was you. I\u2019m so lucky!\u201d Fang Qian exclaimed.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan hadn\u2019t expected to run into a broadcaster while coming out to fish. He felt that this was quite interesting. Then, he went in front of the camera and said, \u201cHello, everyone\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The netizens in the broadcast room were very excited.</p><br/><p>To them, Master Lin was like a mystical being who seemed to know everything.</p><br/><p>When they had seen those news articles on the Internet in the past, they sometimes felt as if they were dreaming. After all, how could there be such a powerful person in this world?</p><br/><p>\u201cQian Qian, it\u2019s not every time you get to come across Master Lin. Hurry up and interact with him more.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. I know that Master Lin\u2019s fortune-telling skills are great. Although I\u2019ve never seen it in person, there\u2019s proof of it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen in the news that Master Lin once gave a secondary school teacher some advice and that teacher ended up winning the lottery.\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-7\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Fang Qian was looking at the comments. She was so excited that she didn\u2019t know what to say.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, are you here to fish?\u201d asked Fang Qian.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s right. I came here to fish and now I\u2019m about to head back.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fang Qian looked left and right. \u201cMaster Lin, it looks like you didn\u2019t catch any fish.\u201d</p><br/><p>These words made him feel a little embarrassed.</p><br/><p>He had indeed not caught any fish. Then, he chuckled. \u201cI just started learning and my skills are horrible, so I didn\u2019t manage to catch anything.\u201d</p><br/><p>When the fans in the broadcast room heard this, the comments were filled with \u2018666\u2019.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, that\u2019s more human-like.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI finally know what Master Lin isn\u2019t good at. If he\u2019s great at everything, how is everyone else supposed to keep living?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cQian Qian, you\u2019re still single now, aren\u2019t you? You can ask Master Lin to read your fortune to find out where your other half is right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fang Qian looked at the comments and felt helpless. These Internet friends of hers were too immoral.</p><br/><p>But she was a little curious. She had heard about Master Lin\u2019s fortune-telling in the past but hadn\u2019t heard anything since.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-8\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, could you do me a favor?\u201d asked Fang Qian.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was in no rush to go back. \u201cAlright, what is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, it\u2019s said on the Internet that your fortune-telling is amazing. Is that true?\u201d Fang Qian asked a question that everyone wanted to know.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled. \u201cIt\u2019s not nice for me to say, is it? It\u2019s just average, I guess. It has just been exaggerated by the rumors.:</p><br/><p>In the broadcast room.</p><br/><p>I feel that what Master Lin said is right. I feel like this kind of thing can\u2019t be that accurate.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. If you can find out about everything with fortune-telling, that would really be scary.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fang Qian was all smiles. \u201cMaster Lin, I want to ask if you could help me read my fortune. I\u2019m twenty-seven now and I don\u2019t even know where my boyfriend is. Could you help me to see when I\u2019ll leave my single life?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled as he said, \u201cThis question is really too easy. You have so many Internet friends, do you even still need to look?\u201d</p><br/><p>When the fans heard this, they started spamming \u2018666\u2019 in a frenzy\u2026</p><br/><p>To them, this Mater Lin was way too smooth.</p></div>\n</div>"}

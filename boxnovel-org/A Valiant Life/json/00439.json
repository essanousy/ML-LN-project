What happened? Why did he drink so much?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Yun Gang replied, \u201cMing Yang and I wanted to invest in some projects in Beijing. We would definitely encounter some problems and people. Therefore, I wanted to bring him here to meet some of the more influential people in Beijing but those people forced him to drink. It seemed as if we wouldn\u2019t be giving them face if we didn\u2019t drink. Initially, I couldn\u2019t do anything about it. I thought we\u2019d only be drinking a bit but he kept asking us to drink and it was never-ending.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho the f*ck are you?\u201d Then, they rushed out of the private room. The first person that rushed out was Young Master Zhao. The corner of his mouth was still bleeding after he had been slapped by Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d Lin Fan asked those people.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you guys don\u2019t make yourselves clear, don\u2019t even think about leaving this place,\u201d Young Master Zhao said. Sister Yan also asked the security officers to come over and they surrounded Lin Fan and the others.</p><br/><p>Lil\u2019 Wang stood beside Lin Fan and he wanted to reveal his identity. However, he was stopped by Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, I wanted to just bring him away but I guess it can\u2019t be resolved so easily now. Who was the one who asked him to drink?\u201d Lin Fan asked.</p><br/><p>Young Master Jiang looked at Lin Fan and smiled. \u201cNobody asked him to drink. I forced him to drink. Furthermore, he didn\u2019t dare to drink. Not drinking wine offered by me means that he\u2019s not giving me face.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sister Yan said, \u201cYoung Master Jiang, should we beat them up before throwing them out?\u201d</p><br/><p>Young Master Jiang shook his head. \u201cThere\u2019s no need for that. They\u2019re just reckless idiots. It\u2019s too simple to just beat them up. Didn\u2019t you see Lil\u2019 Zhao get beaten up? We can\u2019t take this and we definitely have to teach them a good lesson.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lil\u2019 Zhao nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s right. I won\u2019t let this matter go so easily. I want this man to pay a price.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan walked towards Young Master Jiang and looked at him, face to face. Young Master Jiang stared at Lin Fan. \u201cInteresting, you dare to hit my friend? Nobody has ever dared to reject wine from me.\u201d</p><br/><p>There was about a thirty to forty centimeter gap between the two of them. Suddenly, Lin Fan\u2019s hand grabbed Young Master Jiang\u2019s head. Young Master Jiang had a combover and his hair was immediately grabbed by Lin Fan. Then, Lin Fan dragged him into the private room.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou like to drink, don\u2019t you? Fine, I\u2019ll make sure you drink to your heart\u2019s content.\u201d Lin Fan immediately threw Young Master Jiang on the table and pointed at the wine on the table. \u201cHere, drink this. Nobody has ever dared to reject wine from Lin Fan.\u201d</p><br/><p>The crowd was dumbfounded when they saw this.</p><br/><p>They hadn\u2019t expected this man to dare to treat Young Master Jiang like this. Did he really want to lose his life in Beijing?</p><br/><p>Young Master Ma and Young Master Huang were too stunned to react.</p><br/><p>Sister Yan\u2019s face looked extremely awful. Then, she shouted at the security, \u201cWhat are you guys looking at? Can\u2019t you see that Young Master Jiang is being attacked? Quickly get in.\u201d</p><br/><p>The security officers were stunned too. Young Master Jiang was an old customer there and he was always the one that had more power. No matter who it was, they had to respect Young Master Jiang and be courteous to him. They didn\u2019t dare to offend him at all.</p><br/><p>However, this situation today was extremely different.</p><br/><p>Lil\u2019 Wang who was standing there immediately went to block the door. Then, he kicked the security officers aside.</p><br/><p>Wu Yun Gang was ecstatic when he saw this. However, he was a little worried. He knew that they\u2019d be in trouble for offending Young Master Jiang.</p><br/><p>But when he thought of Wang Ming Yang getting bullied, he was extremely furious.</p><br/><p>What are you afraid of?</p><br/><p>Why don\u2019t you just drink it?</p><br/><p>Lil Wang said, \u201cMaster Lin, just do what you want. I\u2019ll handle the door.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded. Then, he looked at Young Master Jiang. \u201cDrink it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Young Master Jiang wanted to stand up. \u201cDo you know who I am?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan kicked Young Master Jiang\u2019s knee, causing him to immediately kneel onto the ground. \u201cI don\u2019t care who you are, even if you\u2019re the king today, you have to finish the wine.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck your mom\u2026\u201d Young Master Jiang scolded. He had never felt so angry before. He couldn\u2019t tolerate it at all.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan immediately slapped Young Master Jiang\u2019s face and he used a lot of force. A red mark appeared on Young Master Jiang\u2019s face. \u201cDrink it now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot possible.\u201d Young Master Jiang was extremely furious. He wanted to kill him.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, since you don\u2019t want to drink it, I\u2019ll feed you.\u201d Lin Fan grabbed Young Master Jiang\u2019s hair and pulled his head backward. He pressed two fingers on the sides of Young Master Jiang\u2019s mouth so that it would open. Then, he took a bottle of wine and stuffed it inside. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna drink it. Who do you think you are to mess with my friends?\u201d</p><br/><p><em>Gulp</em></p><br/><p>The wine immediately went into Young Master Jiang\u2019s mouth and some of it flowed out from his mouth. The burning sensation was trapped in his mouth. He was struggling but Lin Fan was too strong for him.</p><br/><p>After finishing half a bottle.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan let go of his hand.</p><br/><p>Young Master Jiang\u2019s face was red and he placed his hands on the floor. He started to vomit uncontrollably.</p><br/><p>Outside the door.</p><br/><p>Lil\u2019 Wang\u2019s phone rang.</p><br/><p>He looked at the people in front of him and picked up the phone. \u201cElder Zhao.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zheng Zhong Shan said, \u201cHow\u2019s the situation there? Is there any trouble?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lil\u2019 Wang said, \u201cNothing much. It\u2019s just that a bunch of wealthy Young Masters bullied Master Lin\u2019s friends. Master Lin is teaching them a lesson.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, can I know the name of that guy?\u201d Zheng Zhong Shan asked.</p><br/><p>Lil\u2019 Wang looked at them and asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s the name of Young Master Jiang\u2019s father?\u201d</p><br/><p>The person outside was stunned by what was happening inside and Lil\u2019 Wang was like a god standing outside the door. Nobody could enter it.</p><br/><p>Sister Yan was the person in charge there and she couldn\u2019t let things continue. She immediately said, \u201cThat is Young Master Jiang. His dad is Jiang Hai. Please let him go. The consequences aren\u2019t something that you can bear.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lil\u2019 Wang ignored her and reported it, \u201cThe person\u2019s surname is Jiang, his dad\u2019s name is Jiang Hai.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zheng Zhong Shan replied, \u201cJiang Hai? I don\u2019t know who that is. He\u2019s probably some small fry. Tell Master Lin to teach him a good lesson. I\u2019ll take responsibility for this. However, don\u2019t kill anyone.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lil\u2019 Wang shouted inside, \u201cMaster Lin, Elder Zheng said that you can teach him a good lesson. He can bear the consequences if anything happens. But do not kill him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, thanks, Elder Zheng. I owe him a favor now. In the future, I\u2019ll make it up to him,\u201d Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>Lil\u2019 Wang told Elder Zheng what Master Lin had told him. Elder Zheng was ecstatic. \u201cAlright, please protect Master Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>In the private room.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan knew that this Young Master Jiang wasn\u2019t easy to handle. This Young Master Jiang had some authority in Beijing. Lin Fan felt good after what he had done. However, it was difficult to ensure that Wang Ming Yang would be safe in Beijing. Now, Zheng Zhong Shan said that he would bear the consequences and perhaps everything would be okay.</p><br/><p>However, he now owed Zheng Zhong Shan a great favor and it wasn\u2019t a good thing but he couldn\u2019t have done anything about it. He would just have to waste more time drawing for Zheng Zhong Shan. It wasn\u2019t much of a problem.</p><br/><p>He finally understood the value of a contract. He now had the support of the association.</p><br/><p>With Elder Zheng\u2019s status, he would be infuriated if one were bullying some average citizens. However, he was extremely supportive of teaching these stupid wealthy youngsters.</p><br/><p>Sister Yan quickly asked her brother-in-law to come over since she knew that it was out of her control.</p><br/><p>If something were to happen to Young Master Jiang there, Tian Yun Villa would be doomed.</p><br/><p>In the private room, Young Master Jiang was extremely weak and helpless. However, his eyes looked extremely fearsome. He couldn\u2019t stop vomiting but he said angrily, \u201cI will remember this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan took another bottle of wine. \u201cThat\u2019s your problem. Now, just drink this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Yun Gang was extremely shocked. He realized that Master Lin was a ruthless man and it was the first time he had seen this violent side of Master Lin.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

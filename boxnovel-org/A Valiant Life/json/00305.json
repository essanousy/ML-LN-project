He stood there with a look of shock on his face. He was in disbelief.</p><br/><p>One of the leaders smiled. \"I told you. When we just opened this place, we were worried that it wouldn't be lively enough. But look, what's all this? They're all people!\"</p><br/><p>One of the other leaders cried out in surprise, \"It's only 9 am and there are already so many people? Maybe the rental fee that we decided on last time was a little too low.\"</p><br/><p>Huang Bin was still in shock but when he heard this, he instantly trembled. He said, \"Don't even think about it. Let me tell you, this current situation is a hundred percent because of that shop.\"</p><br/><p>\"Which shop?\"</p><br/><p>\"Didn't I already tell you that time? We didn't accept any except any external people renting our shops and just rented them all to the shop owners from Cloud Street. That shop is Master Lin. From what I see, that Xin Yu Corporation was just asking for a disaster by chasing away such a phenomenal shop.\" Huang Bin was already fully convinced about how powerful the Master Lin shop was.</p><br/><p>Its ability to attract people was right before his eyes and he had to believe it even if he didn't want to.</p><br/><p>So many people queuing in front of a shop. If it wasn't proof that it attracted people, what else could it be?</p><br/><p>\"It can't be. It's only the second day and they already have so many customers. That's a little scary.</p><br/><p>Huang Bin shook his head. \"Don't ever compare typical shops to a phenomenal shop like this. Don't think absurdly about raising the rent of the shops. We have to raise it regularly and not jump the price. We mustn't commit the same mistake as Xin Yu Corporation, only seeing the immediate gains and trading even bigger future gains for it.\"</p><br/><p>Everyone nodded. Seeing the scene before them, they all submitted to believing him.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>That granny's scallion pancake eventually went to a reseller for nine hundred.</p><br/><p>If the granny had held on just a little longer, going over a thousand was a very possible thing. But these nine hundred dollars were enough to make the granny excited for the rest of the day. The reseller would also be able to earn some good money. He took out his phone immediately and contacted his clients. Although they were just resellers, their procedures were quite professional. They would send a photo over to the customer as proof of the scallion pancake's authenticity and once the customer approves, they would place it in a specialized packaging and deliver it to the customer immediately.</p><br/><p>In a certain luxurious villa.</p><br/><p>A middle-aged man with an extraordinary temperament was cautiously and solemnly standing in front of a young man. He said, \"Young Master Zou, I've ordered a delicacy for you that you have never tasted before. I can guarantee you that after you eat it, you will definitely cry out that this is the world's most delicious delicacy.\"</p><br/><p>The man who was called Young Master Zou wasn't very old. He was below thirty but every single movement he made was calm and steady. He gave off a feeling as if he was in control of everything.</p><br/><p>\"Oh, is that so?\"</p><br/><p>With this Young Master Zou, the middle-aged man didn't dare to be negligent. Young Master Zou's status wasn't something he could compare to. This Young Master Zou was both the son of a rich family and a second-generation 'Red'. He was more pampered than anyone else and had a higher status than anyone else.</p><br/><p>The middle-aged man used to be a soldier under Young Master Zou's father. After he retired, he came over to Shanghai. And each time Young Master Zou came to Shanghai, he would receive him as a guest. He would never dare to neglect Young Master Zou.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Lin Fan had just finished selling ten scallion pancakes. He raised his head and looked at the townsfolk who were still waiting. He couldn't help but smile as he said, \"Don't be impatient everybody. I'll be stationed here every day from now on. If you didn't manage to buy today, then there's still tomorrow. Eventually, you'll be able to buy it.\"</p><br/><p>\"Little Boss, you could sell a little more each day!\"</p><br/><p>\"Yeah! Why don't you sell twenty per day from now on?\"</p><br/><p>\"If twenty isn't okay, then fifty! If you sell just ten a day, with all these people fighting over them, you'd be killing us!\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. \"Please be understanding, everyone. If you're interested, you can look at this sheet on the wall. If you can understand it, then you don't need to queue. Besides scallion pancakes, our shop also does fortune-telling. If you're interested, come and try it.\"</p><br/><p>The local townsfolk were still not used to this. Ten servings of scallion pancakes were not enough at all. It was even a little pathetic.</p><br/><p>As of today, Lin Fan wasn't planning to change the rule. What was the point of tiring himself so much? Making ten servings a day was tiring enough. If he made twenty a day, his body would probably spoil from fatigue.</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>At the villa.</p><br/><p>Young Master Zou looked at the little thing in front of him, then at the man. \"Are you teasing me?\"</p><br/><p>\"Young Master, I wouldn't dare to tease you. Once you take a bite of this scallion pancake, you'll understand,\" said the man hurriedly. At the same time, his face was filled with enthusiastic confidence. Through luck or fate, he had gotten the chance to eat these scallion pancakes once before. Thereafter, he had given his contact details to a reseller so he could get more. But even resellers did not always have stock. It all depended on luck.</p><br/><p>This time that Young Master Zou came over from Beijing, the reseller contacted him just in time. He didn't even bargain with the reseller and just bought the scallion pancake for ten thousand. With regards to spending, he didn't bother about the actual price. What he cared about was whether what he was buying was worth. To him, this scallion pancake was definitely worth it.</p><br/><p>Young Master Zou looked at the scallion pancake in front of him without an ounce of interest. He must be teasing me!</p><br/><p>Who does he think I am? He thinks I'll eat this? Does he think I'm an idiot? It's clearly just a scallion pancake! How good could it be?</p><br/><p>Suddenly.</p><br/><p>A fragrance gently floated up into his nostrils.</p><br/><p>He took a whiff.</p><br/><p>The fragrance rushed into his nostrils and filled his heart.</p><br/><p>He picked up the scallion pancake and took a little bite. That cold and indifferent expression of his instantly changed.</p><br/><p>\"This\u2026\"</p><br/><p>The man said, \"Young Master, if it was fresh out of the oven, it would taste even more beautiful. But even though it's only slightly warm now, it's taste is still very addictive.\"</p><br/><p>As the man said all these, Young Master Zou didn't say a word.</p><br/><p>This mysterious scallion pancake had left him flabbergasted. Compared to all the delicacies from land and sea that he had tasted before, this was a hundred, maybe even a thousand times more delicious.</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>In the afternoon.</p><br/><p>After sending off the fortune-telling customers, the shop was empty for the moment.</p><br/><p>Currently, the scallion pancakes were better received than fortune-telling. This fortune-telling was still very accurate but because Lin Fan didn't do it personally, many customers were doubtful. They only recognized Master Lin's skill and not anyone else's.</p><br/><p>If Lin Fan announced that he would do the fortune-telling, the number of people coming in might reach a whole new level.</p><br/><p>But for Lin Fan to personally do fortune-telling was very very hard. It didn't just depend on his mood but also on whether he felt like it and if he had the time.</p><br/><p>Then, Fraud Tian nudged Lin Fan. \"Look\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was playing with his phone when he raised his head and looked over. That kid, He Xiao Ming, was standing at the entrance and silently looking at him.</p><br/><p>\"You, come out now! I have something to ask you,\" yelled He Xiao Ming.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at him, then lowered his head and continued to play with his phone. He completely ignored He Xiao Ming.</p><br/><p>When He Xiao Ming saw that he had been ignored, he lowered his head and thought for a moment, then said, \"Master Lin, I'm looking for you.\"</p><br/><p>His greeting had changed. From 'You' to 'Master Lin'.</p><br/><p>But Lin Fan still didn't reply him. He turned his body slightly so that his back faced He Xiao Ming. Then, he continued playing with his phone.</p><br/><p>He Xiao Ming was getting a little impatient. He was back from the temple and the first thing he had to do was ask what the heck was going on.</p><br/><p>He knew about the Buddha incident. He heard it had been because of an earthquake.</p><br/><p>But he didn't believe it. How could such a coincidental thing happen? There were over a hundred Buddhas on the wall, how could only one fall down?</p><br/><p>When he recalled what he heard, his heart started to get a little fearful.</p><br/><p>At that moment, He Xiao Ming took a deep breath, then bent his body forward slightly. With a respectful tone, he said, \"Uncle Lin, I'd like to have a few words with you. Would that be possible?\"</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Lin Fan put down his phone and cried out in a surprised tone, \"Ah, my nephew is here! Look, your uncle was so busy playing games that he didn't even notice you. I should quit all these games in the future. I'm playing Arena of Valor now. I'll be done soon. Come in and chat.\"</p><br/><p>He Xiao Ming looked at Lin Fan with an annoyed look. He definitely did this on purpose.</p><br/><p>But at that moment, He Xiao Ming didn't have any qualms.</p><br/><p>He had given in to Lin Fan.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

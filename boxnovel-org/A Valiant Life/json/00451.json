Initially, he wanted to return the next day but the incident in the morning made him feel that leaving in the afternoon would save him the trouble.</p><br/><p>Indeed.</p><br/><p>Elder Zheng and the others really found out about it. He didn\u2019t expect them to make such an accurate guess.</p><br/><p>It felt great doing a kind deed.</p><br/><p>The knowledge of the Encyclopedia was insane. However, there were limitations and he couldn\u2019t have treated anyone he wanted.</p><br/><p>Ding ding!</p><br/><p>His phone rang.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan picked up after seeing it was Wang Ming Yang.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang said, \u201cD*mn, why are you leaving today?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cWhat is it? Why can\u2019t I leave? I have nothing to do in Beijing anymore. I\u2019ll just leave earlier. The shop is still waiting for me. The earlier I go back, the faster I can settle things there.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang replied, \u201cAlright, I didn\u2019t expect you to abandon me so heartlessly. But really, don\u2019t spread the video. I\u2019ll die from it\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, alright. Come back to Shanghai when you\u2019re done. I\u2019ll hang up here,\u201d Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>Then, they talked for a while longer before hanging up.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>8 pm at night.</p><br/><p>At Shanghai.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan came out of the airport and took a deep breath. It was a familiar place with familiar air.</p><br/><p>The next day!</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan appeared at Cloud Street, the shop owners were stunned.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, Little Boss is back.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh my, Little Boss is back from Beijing. It\u2019s a joyous occasion.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWithout Little Boss at Cloud Street, could it even be called Cloud Street?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan stood there and when he heard what the shop owners said, he was stunned. D*mn, did they have to exaggerate it? It was just him coming back to Shanghai.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Zhang, what are you guys doing? Your reactions are so exaggerated,\u201d Lin Fan smiled and smiled.</p><br/><p>Elder Zhang laughed, \u201cIt\u2019s normal. Little Boss, you were gone for a few days. We really missed you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled, \u201cI\u2019m back! Alright, let\u2019s not talk. I\u2019ll go see how\u2019s my shop doing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, alright. Go ahead, Little Boss. The townsfolk have been asking us when you\u2019d come back and they had been waiting for a long time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. Could he not have known what the townsfolk were waiting for? It was definitely the scallion pancakes.</p><br/><p>Perhaps he could never give up on the scallion pancakes since the townsfolk were addicted to it.</p><br/><p>At Master Lin\u2019s shop.</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan appeared, Fraud Tian and the others were stunned. \u201cD*mn, you\u2019re finally back! When did you come back? Why didn\u2019t you tell us about it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled, \u201cI just returned yesterday night. Did you miss me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian just touched his beard.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201d Lin Fan smiled and asked.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian rolled his eyes at Lin Fan, \u201cDon\u2019t you understand what that means? You went away for so long. You should at least have bought us something, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a pity that I didn\u2019t,\u201d Lin Fan said helplessly.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, I\u2019ve no choice. I don\u2019t miss you but I think he misses you,\u201d Fraud Tian said as he pointed at Elder Dog Nicholas who was taking a nap.</p><br/><p>Elder Dog Nicholas raised his head and barked for a while. Then, he went back to sleep.</p><br/><p>He had become an old and lazy dog. In the past, when Lin Fan returned, Elder Dog Nicholas would run towards him happily but now, he just lied down there and slept.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan said, \u201cBrother Lin, we all missed you so much.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha,\u201d Lin Fan laughed. Then, he looked at Fraud Tian, \u201cLook, you\u2019re the only heartless one here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian smiled, \u201cI\u2019m not heartless. Look, when you were gone, we were having such a hard time. The townsfolk kept asking us when you\u2019d return. Let me see\u2026 I think they\u2019ll be here soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>Indeed, a while later\u2026</p><br/><p>There were more and more townsfolk outside and they were discussing about it.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian said helplessly, \u201cLook, it\u2019s been like that every day. It\u2019s good that you\u2019re back. We have an easier job now. I shall go and give you the number tags.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled and went in front of the cart. \u201cSorry, everyone. I had something to attend to. Today, there will be twenty pieces of scallion pancakes as I have to make it up to all of you.\u201d</p><br/><p>The townsfolk were elated when they heard that, \u201cAlright, that\u2019s awesome! Little Boss is so generous.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTwenty pieces! I wish it could stay this way in the future too.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. These townsfolk were so cute. They were easily satisfied.</p><br/><p>Soon, twenty pieces of scallion pancakes were sold out.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan lied down in his shop leisurely. Although he returned to Shanghai late last night, he had to do what he needed to do. He had to go to Nanshan Children\u2019s Welfare Organisation to teach the children.</p><br/><p>However, what bothered Lin Fan was his Encyclopedic task. He had to complete it. However, it would mean that he needed to leave Shanghai again. It wasn\u2019t going to affect his task. He wanted to make the first place of gathering his first stop.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan called Zhao Ming Qing, \u201cMing Qing, I\u2019m back. Did anything happen recently?\u201d</p><br/><p>During Lin Fan\u2019s absence, Zhao Ming Qing had been extremely busy. The main thing was that the prescription for anorexia was out and it attracted the attention of a lot of people.</p><br/><p>Many big hospitals sent people over to find out more while some companies sent people to buy the prescription. Of course, Zhao Ming Qing wasn\u2019t foolish. Furthermore, it was a prescription that he formulated with his mentor\u2019s help. It could even be said that the mentor came up with it with his help.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, recently, a lot of people came to look for me. They want to buy the prescription for anorexia but I didn\u2019t sell it to them. I registered this prescription with your identity\u2026\u201d Zhao Ming Qing reported everything to Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan wasn\u2019t really bothered by it, \u201cContinue to handle this, I won\u2019t interfere with it. Would you have any free time in the coming days?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing was puzzled. He didn\u2019t know what his mentor meant. However, since his mentor had asked him for his time, he couldn\u2019t have rejected him. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was just a single word and he answered it without any hesitation.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright then, I\u2019m preparing to go to a few cities during this period of time to practice Chinese medicine. If you can handle it, you can follow me to witness the unusual diseases. It would probably benefit you a lot.\u201d Lin Fan wanted to complete the Encyclopedic task. Although he could\u2019ve completed it alone, he wanted to teach his disciple since he already got one. In short, it was too boring to do it alone.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing was ecstatic when he heard it, \u201cTeacher, alright. When?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled when he heard the excitement in Zhao Ming Qing\u2019s voice. \u201cWait for my notice.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

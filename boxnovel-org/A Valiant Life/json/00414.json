He used a youngster as a test subject and he still dared to come here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDespicable. Truly despicable. I didn\u2019t expect Chinese medicine to have stooped to this level. This old fella doesn\u2019t even look like a decent man.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSomeone please smash him with something.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, I don\u2019t have anything to smash him with.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen beat him up.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBeat him up my a*s. If I\u2019m arrested for hitting an old man, I would definitely have nowhere to go regardless of my status.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen scold him. This old and shameless fool dared to come here. If he was younger, I swear I\u2019d have beaten him up.\u201d</p><br/><p>The people were extremely furious. They had been scrolling through Weibo and WeChat and when they saw those videos, they had been extremely agitated. They began to curse him even though they didn\u2019t know the truth.</p><br/><p>They could be considered kind yet stupid. Sometimes, you don\u2019t need to see blood for someone to be killed. The power of the Internet could destroy anyone.</p><br/><p>However, Zhao Ming Qing was a good-natured man and he firmly believed that whatever his mentor was doing was righteous no matter what the Internet said.</p><br/><p>He wasn\u2019t affected by the people making a ruckus outside the hospital as he believed in himself and his mentor.</p><br/><p>The reporters surrounded Zhao Ming Qing and wanted to interview him.</p><br/><p>\u201cDirector Zhao, do you have anything to say about the Internet? The video online shows that you used a young man as a test subject. Is it true?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing turned around. \u201cDo you think it is true?\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporter was stunned. Then, he looked at Zhao Ming Qing and nodded. \u201cI believe my own eyes. I think it\u2019s true. The video showed that the young man was taking some medicine.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable. Your thinking has already been corrupted.\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporter was unhappy when he heard it. Then, he scolded Zhao Ming Qing, \u201cI\u2019m corrupted? What did you do yourself? It\u2019s the 21st century and it is peacetime. It\u2019s shameful to have a Chinese medical doctor like you.\u201d</p><br/><p>This matter had caused a lot of people to be upset and the people were there to settle scores with Zhao Ming Qing. Some of the reporters were a little calmer and they just held onto the video cameras for their interviews. Some of the more capable media platforms began to broadcast it live.</p><br/><p>At a short distance, a reporter was holding a microphone.</p><br/><p>\u201cTo everyone watching the broadcast, we\u2019re broadcasting the veteran Chinese medical doctor, Zhao Ming Qing, who is also an academy director. He used a human as a test subject for his medicine and there\u2019s no conclusion to this matter as of yet. Today, he appeared outside the hospital early in the morning and said that he has already come up with a prescription to cure anorexia. Please stay tuned to what\u2019s to come.\u201d</p><br/><p>This matter had already blown up on the Internet.</p><br/><p>In the broadcast room.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, I\u2019m so infuriated. If it wasn\u2019t so far away, I\u2019d have gone to Shanghai to slap this old fella.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, this old hag harmed someone and still has the guts to be here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen you\u2019re scolding this old fella, there\u2019s still an idiot that\u2019s supportive of him. That\u2019s Master Lin, the f*cking idiot of Weibo. You guys can go and have a look. It\u2019s so shameless.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t take it any longer. As long as you have some decency, you wouldn\u2019t be on this old fella\u2019s side. It\u2019s obvious that this Master Lin isn\u2019t a good man.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin used to be awesome in the past. He was a righteous man but recently, he\u2019s been on this old man\u2019s side.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019d never know what he is thinking. I just saw that he got famous within a few months. This is a top scammer. Now that he\u2019s famous and he\u2019s earned so much money, he is revealing his true colors. It\u2019s normal.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Lin Fan just stood there and nobody realized who he was. He didn\u2019t want to speak up about this matter and wanted to let Zhao Ming Qing settle it. Zhao Ming Qing was a veteran Chinese medical doctor and he was the director of Shanghai\u2019s First Chinese Medical Academy. It could be said that he was the representative of Chinese medicine. If he were to settle this, it would definitely be beneficial to the development of Chinese medicine.</p><br/><p>Especially since people don\u2019t hold Chinese medicine in high regard nowadays. It was probably the main reason for the downfall of Chinese medicine. It was disappointing in the battles with Western medicine and in the end, it declined. If people were to invest their time, effort and resources in Chinese medicine research, it wouldn\u2019t have ended up like this today.</p><br/><p>These elderly Chinese medical doctors had superior Chinese medical skills but not many people believed in it. Furthermore, there weren\u2019t many youngsters who were willing to learn about it. Ultimately, it resulted in the downfall of Chinese medicine and it was inevitable.</p><br/><p>However, Lin Fan had to be near Zhao Ming Qing to prevent anything bad from happening. If something wrong were to happen, he would beat those people who tried to interfere with things. He wouldn\u2019t show any mercy at all.</p><br/><p>The current situation looked pretty safe and there wasn\u2019t any conflict.</p><br/><p>At a certain company.</p><br/><p>Zhao Li Xing was in his office watching the broadcast. He was extremely heavy hearted and it was an indescribable feeling. He could picture those people scolding his dad. As his father\u2019s son, he wanted to beat those people up till their mouths swelled. However, he could only sigh and hope that his father would realize what he had done wrong after this incident.</p><br/><p>And that he wouldn\u2019t continue sinking even deeper.</p><br/><p>Soon, Director Zhang came out to welcome them. However, he looked a little doubtful. He nodded at Zhao Ming Qing. \u201cDirector Zhao.\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Zhao nodded. \u201cDirector Zhang, sorry to have troubled you. I\u2019m here today to give the medicine to the patient.\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Zhang didn\u2019t say much. Regardless of what was happening online, this was still the director of Shanghai\u2019s First Chinese Medical Academy and he held him in high regard.</p><br/><p>On the way to the ward.</p><br/><p>Director Zhang said, \u201cDirector Zhao, have you come up with the prescription?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Zhao Ming Qing nodded confidently. He was extremely confident in the prescription developed under the guidance of his mentor. At the same time, he felt that it was the turning point for Chinese medicine.</p><br/><p>Those that were in the Chinese medicine profession were watching the broadcast. Despite what everyone was saying, the matter had already happened and he was at the hospital. They wanted to see what was going to happen.</p><br/><p>A success would call for celebration while failure would ensure that he wouldn\u2019t be able to recover from it.</p><br/><p>At the ward.</p><br/><p>The team of professionals was looking at Wang Li Li\u2019s physical condition. The report showed that her condition was worsening. Then, Zhao Ming Qing came in. Specialist Chang frowned. \u201cWhat are you guys doing? This patient\u2019s condition isn\u2019t stable and she needs a quiet environment.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing raised his head. \u201cI\u2019ve already come up with the prescription and I have to let the patient consume it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBased on Chinese medicine?\u201d Specialist Chang was stunned. It looked as if he was upset. Then, he looked at Director Zhang.</p><br/><p>However, Director Zhang didn\u2019t say anything. Perhaps it was a silent approval.</p><br/><p>Wang Li Li\u2019s mother was worried. \u201cWhat are you guys trying to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing looked at Wang Li Li\u2019s mum, \u201cMadam Wang, I am Zhao Ming Qing, a Chinese medical doctor. We have come up with a prescription to cure anorexia. I would like to let your daughter consume it and I hope you can approve it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Specialist Chang said, \u201cPlease be careful. The medicine is 30% poisonous. If things get worse, you\u2019d kill an innocent patient.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Li Li\u2019s mother was horrified by what he said. Her face turned as white as paper and she didn\u2019t know what to do.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing looked at Specialist Chang. \u201cYou guys are the experts in the research of anorexia, do you have any solution? If you have one, are you confident of it being effective?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen you have a Chinese medicine solution?\u201d Specialist Chang said condescendingly.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing nodded confidently. \u201cThat\u2019s right. I am extremely confident and I will bear all the consequences.\u201d</p><br/><p>The matter depended on Wang Li Li\u2019s mother as she had to approve it. However, the current situation wasn\u2019t favorable. Madam Wang didn\u2019t know what to do as she was afraid.</p><br/><p>\u201cMadam Wang, actually, you can give it a go. This is the hospital. If something were to happen, we can save her. Furthermore, I am willing to provide scallion pancakes every single day. We should believe in Chinese medicine. Chinese medicine is something left behind for us by our ancestors and Director Zhao is brilliant in Chinese medicine. Why not give it a try? Perhaps it could save your daughter from this turmoil. What if it succeeds?\u201d</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan stepped forward, the broadcast room went crazy.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

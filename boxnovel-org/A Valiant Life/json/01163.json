He said curiously, \u201cHey, where did that kid go?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. \u201cHe told you to wait. He\u2019s going to bring reinforcements to take care of you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian was taken aback when he heard that. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t even my fault! He\u2019s the one who tried to throw a sneaky attack at me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang said, \u201cBut he has already remembered you. There\u2019s nothing you can do.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn. That kid is really unreasonable. If he really comes, I have to have a good word with him. He\u2019s the one who tried to hit me. It\u2019s not my fault. But that kid is really very weak. He\u2019s so young too. It\u2019s clear that he\u2019s a wimp,\u201d said Fraud Tian regretfully.</p><br/><p>Yun Xue Yao wasn\u2019t worried at all. What could Ma Shao Hao possibly do to Brother Lin and the rest? This wasn\u2019t just Ma Shao Hao\u2019s territory. It was her territory as well.</p><br/><p>She would never let anything happen to Brother Lin.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, should we go to a different, quieter place?\u201d asked Jin Meng.</p><br/><p>Although she knew that nothing would happen to Master Lin and the rest, it still wouldn\u2019t be good for a conflict to happen.</p><br/><p>The Ma Family and the Yun Family had a decent relationship. There was no need for a conflict to break out just because of this matter.</p><br/><p>Moreover, that Ma Shao Hao was a complete idiot. He didn\u2019t use his brain at all.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved his hand. \u201cThere\u2019s no need. This place is pretty good.\u201d</p><br/><p>He hadn\u2019t expected that kid to find trouble for himself. Lin Fan could forgive him for saying those thoughtless words in the beginning, but when he tried to humiliate Lin Fan, Lin Fan could not take it.</p><br/><p>That kid had really gotten out of hand.</p><br/><p>Since Master Lin said that they would stay here, Jin Meng didn\u2019t say more.</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang kept broadcasting with his phone. \u201cBrothers, did you see that just now? How cool is Master Lin? How cool is Fraud?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c6666\u2026 I know that Master Lin is incredible but I didn\u2019t think that the old man, Fraud, was so f*cking awesome as well. I\u2019m convinced now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEnough words. I\u2019m sending my gifts now. Let\u2019s see how Master Lin and the rest educate that idiotic youngster.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, you guys have to take care. This is Haojiang, it\u2019s not our Shanghai. If something bad happens, we won\u2019t be able to cover you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha. ^You\u2019re overthinking things. Master Lin\u2019s Kung Fu is incredible. No matter how many people that kid brings, Master Lin can defeat all of them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know that Master Lin is powerful but I\u2019m still afraid of that guy\u2019s influence in Haojiang.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re really overthinking things. Don\u2019t you know who that lady next to Master Lin is? Let me tell you. That\u2019s a big shot. Sigh\u2026 Forget about it. Even if I tell you, you wouldn\u2019t understand. Only people who have been to Haojiang would know.\u201d</p><br/><p>In the broadcast room, the netizens commented maniacally as they discussed this situation.</p><br/><p>After Ma Shao Hao left, a look of contempt appeared on his face. He kept making phone calls, getting people to come and back him up.</p><br/><p>Initially, when he made the call, the other side would immediately want to come and help. But when they heard that Yun Family\u2019s Yun Xue Yao was around, they immediately pretended that they were busy or they said that their phones were running out of battery.</p><br/><p>Anyone in Haojiang with a brain knew that this was a battle among gods. If they were to get involved, they would get obliterated.</p><br/><p>Even money wasn\u2019t more important than their lives.</p><br/><p>Also, they understood this Ma Shao Hao very well. He had no sense of loyalty at all. If a problem were to occur, he would definitely betray them.</p><br/><p>In Haojiang, the old man of the Yun Family was no joke. Nobody dared to cross him.</p><br/><p>The only people who dared to make fun of him were idiots from other parts of the country who didn\u2019t know what was good for them.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck. You gutless b*stards. I didn\u2019t think that these bunch of arrogant and boastful guys would be so cowardly. Once I mentioned Yun Xue Yao, they all ran away.\u201d</p><br/><p>In the end, he learned his lesson and stopped mentioning Yun Xue Yao\u2019s presence. However, those people seemed to already have spread the news among themselves and everyone already knew what was going on.</p><br/><p>One of them, a big shot, said:</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung Master Ma, is this for real? We basically live at the mercy of the Yun Family. Now that you\u2019re telling us to find trouble with the Lady of the Yun Family, aren\u2019t you just telling us to kill ourselves?\u201d</p><br/><p>After saying that, he hung up. To them, this Ma Shao Hao was an idiot for trying to send them straight into a fire pit.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck!\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, Ma Shao Hao didn\u2019t know what to do anymore. The people in his family would never come and help him. After all, with the Lady of the Yun Family around, they would never dare to come. Moreover, if he were to call them, his old man would definitely find out.</p><br/><p>If that were to happen, things would really get complicated.</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung Master Ma, aren\u2019t we supposed to meet inside? Why are you waiting for me here?\u201d At that moment, a man came out of a luxurious car. When he saw that Ma Shao Hao was standing at the entrance of the restaurant and making calls, he was curious.</p><br/><p>When Ma Shao Hao saw him, he felt helpless. \u201cYoung Master Zhao, I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m having a headache because of a certain troubling matter.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Xuan was curious. \u201cWhat kind of troubling matter, Young Master Ma?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ma Shao Hao waved his hand. \u201cLet\u2019s not talk about it. My head hurts. You aren\u2019t from Haojiang anyway. You wouldn\u2019t be able to help.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Xuan laughed, then patted Ma Shao Hao\u2019s shoulder. \u201cTell me. From now on, we\u2019re going to be partners. Your problems are my problems as well. Just because I\u2019m from Hong Kong doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t have influence in Haojiang.</p><br/><p>Ma Shao Hao didn\u2019t really care about what Zhao Xuan said. After all, Mao Shao Hao had been in Haojiang for so long but even he couldn\u2019t do anything about the situation. An outsider wouldn\u2019t be able to do anything.</p><br/><p>Then, Ma Shao Hao explained everything to Zhao Xuan.</p><br/><p>When Zhao Xuan heard it, he laughed. \u201cYoung Master Ma, I didn\u2019t think that all this was for a lady. But since the olden days, heroes have had a weak spot for beautiful women. Naturally, Young Master Ma is no exception. Since that person is so powerful, why don\u2019t we find some mafias to take care of him? With Young Master Ma\u2019s influence, I\u2019m sure that many would respond to your call.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. But that woman is the Lady of the Yun Family. No one dares to come at all. They don\u2019t want to get in trouble,\u201d said Ma Shao Hao.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Yun Family.\u201d Zhao Xun\u2019s eyes gleamed as some thoughts passed through his mind. Naturally, he knew what the Yun Family represented here. In the future, when he works with Ma Shao Hao, he would definitely have to cross paths with the Yun Family. However, the most important thing now was to gain Ma Shao Hao\u2019s trust.</p><br/><p>As for the Yun Family, that was one of his prey as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung Master Ma, this matter can easily be settled.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, Zhao Xuan started speaking.</p></div>\n</div>"}

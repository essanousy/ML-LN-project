Vice-Chairman Zhou and the rest will talk to Lin Fan. I don\u2019t believe that he will be able to defy everyone else and carry out what he said.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow despicable. Does he really think he owns the association?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. With all of us protesting, let\u2019s see how he will handle it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve worked so hard to establish ourselves in the association and he wants to throw all that into the gutter just by saying the word. Who would be able to stand something like that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWithout us, his \u2018association\u2019 is just an empty shell. No one will recognize him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-2\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Weibo.</p><br/><p>The netizens completely approved of what Master Lin was doing. As for those who were criticizing Master Lin\u2019s behavior, the netizens immediately flamed them.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrothers, I absolutely agree with what Master Lin is doing. I\u2019ve been tricked before by one of these bullsh*t association professionals in the past. After I bought something from them, I was filled with regret.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight now, Master Lin is taking action against them. The best case is that he kicks all of them out.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. Enough talk. The boss is making his move. Those who want to battle with him, hurry up and follow the boss. If we miss this, we won\u2019t have another opportunity.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReporting, reporting. My keyboard can\u2019t take it any longer.\u201d</p><br/><p>Those associations who had come out to rant immediately suffered harsh scoldings on Weibo. They didn\u2019t even know where to vent their anger anymore. But it couldn\u2019t be helped. They really couldn\u2019t win these netizens in a flame battle. They could only watch helplessly as they got flamed.</p><br/><p>However, it didn\u2019t matter. As long as they managed to suppress that Lin Fan, it would be a victory.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-3\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>At that moment.</p><br/><p>Zhang Guo Shou took out his phone and dialed a number.</p><br/><p>Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan saw this unknown number, he was suspicious. He wondered who it was but he still answered in the end.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello, who is this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Guo Fei answered with a smile, \u201cHello, Chairman Lin. I\u2019m Zhang Guo Fei, former Vice-Chairman of the association.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan heard that, he was stunned. He hadn\u2019t expected this guy to call him. It was really unexpected. If not for what Zhao Ming Qing had just told him, Lin Fan might have had a nice chat with the opposite party.</p><br/><p>But now, Lin Fan decided to let Zhang Guo Fei continue his act.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, what is it?\u201d A Chairman had to have the aura of a Chairman. Although the opposition was a former Vice-Chairman, there was still that \u2018Vice\u2019 in his title. Lin Fan was a Chairman himself.</p><br/><p>Zhang Guo Shou heard Lin Fan\u2019s indifferent tone which did not show any sense of respect for his elder and couldn\u2019t help but become a little displeased.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-4\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>His impression of Lin Fan worsened dramatically.</p><br/><p>\u201cChairman Lin, I\u2019m calling you because, as someone who has been around for some time, I want to advise you to take things slowly. The Chinese Medical Association has gotten to where it is through slow and steady progress. You can\u2019t be so reckless. It will draw backlash. The association\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Using his position as a senior, Zhang Guo Shou started to give an account of the Chinese Medical Association\u2019s history of development, the events that the association had gone through in the past, etc.</p><br/><p>He ended up saying a whole bunch in one go.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Lin Fan had placed the phone on the table and started discussing with Zhao Ming Qing about the exam matter.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, I feel that this question is pretty good but it\u2019s a little bit too difficult.\u201d Zhao Ming Qing had been taking a close look at the exam questions. His gaze then shifted to the phone for a split second.</p><br/><p><em>This is a call from Zhang Guo Shou. Is it really alright for Teacher to just put the phone there?</em></p><br/><p>Lin Fan took a look and nodded. \u201cMmm, that makes sense. This is indeed a bit difficult. But I feel that putting this question inside is suitable. This is the Chinese Medical Association. It\u2019s not a school. People who are able to enter the association should be capable. If they\u2019re not capable enough, how can we let them join the association?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey can\u2019t enter based on interest. They have to have genuine ability and knowledge.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing thought for a moment before saying, \u201cTeacher, what you\u2019re saying is that the Chinese Medical Association is different from other associations. For example, in the case of the Chinese Art Association, someone who has interest in Chinese art and has some connections would be able to join. But for the Chinese Medical Association, even if one has broad connections, one cannot join so casually.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two of them continued to chat about this.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Wu You Lan and the rest glanced at them occasionally. They had nothing to say in this matter. They felt that this situation was a little complicated.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-5\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Soon after, Zhang Guo Shou shouted into the phone.</p><br/><p>\u201cChairman Lin\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan picked up the phone. \u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Guo Shou: \u201cThat\u2019s all I have to say. Does Chairman Lin have any questions?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s very good. If there\u2019s nothing else, I\u2019m hanging up,\u201d said Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>After hanging up, Zhang Guo Shou was very pleased. He felt that he still had his dignity as he had managed to make Lin Fan agree with him on this matter.</p><br/><p>Being too reckless wouldn\u2019t be good after all.</p><br/><p>But looking at the situation, it seemed that Lin Fan had listened to what he had said and could still be saved. At least it seemed Lin Fan had understood that he couldn\u2019t do whatever he wanted.</p><br/><p>Nighttime.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan went back home and turned on the television. With one look, he was astonished.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-6\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>On the television.</p><br/><p>Zhang Guo Shou was a guest on a certain television programme. In the programme, the host asked several unimportant questions.</p><br/><p>But towards the end, the host started to ask about the incident that was happening.</p><br/><p>The host said, \u201cElder Zhang, recently, Master Lin was appointed as Chairman of the Chinese Medical Association and he is executing a member reform. The members have to be re-evaluated. What do you think of this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Guo show sat there with a powerful demeanor. \u201cAbout this, I don\u2019t think it is very good. Master Lin is young and he already has such achievements. It can be said that he has surpassed all before him. Although his knowledge and talent are great, he doesn\u2019t have enough experience dealing with people. He is too extreme with his methods.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cToday, I spoke to Chairman Lin on the phone and told him about the repercussions of his actions. He accepted my words humbly and that is something worth admiring. I hope that he will learn and grow from this incident.\u201d</p><br/><p>The host said, \u201cOh, Elder Zhang, does that mean that Master Lin will not be carrying on with the reform?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Guo Shou nodded, full of confidence. \u201cMmm. That\u2019s right.\u201d</p><br/><p>The association members who were watching the programme all started smiling.</p><br/><p>Indeed, when Elder Zhang made his move, nothing could stand in his way.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-7\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>The programme continued.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan wasn\u2019t bothered by it as he continued typing a Weibo post. Then, he looked through it again and felt that it was pretty good before he posted it.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe evaluation for the Chinese Medical Association has been confirmed. It will be on the first of the next month. The evaluation will be held Beijing Assembly Hall. For those who do not attend the evaluation, it will be regarded that you voluntarily withdraw from the association. Your past appointments within the association will be terminated. Also, we welcome Chinese doctors from everywhere to come and take the exam to join the Chinese Medical Association\u2026 The registration time will be 12 PM tomorrow. Please visit the Chinese Medical Association official website for more information.\u201d</p><br/><p>He typed quite a long paragraph, mainly describing the benefits and welfare that would be received after joining the Chinese Medical Association.</p><br/><p>As for those people protesting and hooting about, he completely ignored them.</p><br/><p>They could do as they liked. It didn\u2019t concern him one bit.</p><br/><p>As for this Zhang Guo Shou, it was useless even if he was the former Vice-Chairman. He had already retired anyway. He should have just spent his time taking care of his old body. What was he thinking so much for?</p></div>\n</div>"}

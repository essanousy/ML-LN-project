This is too tiring. I\u2019ve already made my point.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen He was curled up in pain but the rage in his eyes hadn\u2019t been dispelled. He wanted to kill these b*stards.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan stood up. \u201cThis isn\u2019t enough. I\u2019ll heal this guy up and then it\u2019ll be my turn.\u201d</p><br/><p>When they heard these two people\u2019s words, the production crew was frightened. This was f*cking cruel.</p><br/><p>Some of the people who knew about Master Lin were crying. The Internet was indeed full of lies.</p><br/><p>The kind-hearted Master Lin!</p><br/><p>The gentle Master Lin!</p><br/><p>Take a good look at this. Is this still the kind-hearted and gentle Master Lin? This is the violent Master Lin. Although that Chief Chen had been very unbridled before and deserved a beating, this beating was a little too scary.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang\u2019s kicks and punches weren\u2019t very heavy. When he hit Chen He, it only hurt a little. It was far from the kind of damage that Lin Fan dealt.</p><br/><p>Chen He took a deep breath and snarled, \u201cI will not forgive you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan didn\u2019t say much. He came to Chen He\u2019s side and pressed on Chen He\u2019s fingers a few times, realigning the bones in his left hand.</p><br/><p>*crack!*</p><br/><p>*crack!*</p><br/><p>Chen He suddenly realized that his left hand was fixed. Moreover, the injuries on his body were much better now. Then, he laughed hysterically, \u201cYou\u2019re scared. You\u2019re scared, aren\u2019t you? Let me tell you that even this won\u2019t help you. I\u2019ve already remembered what you\u2019ve done.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking about?\u201d Lin Fan said with a glance at him, \u201cDon\u2019t think too much. You\u2019ll know what\u2019s going on later.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen He was taken aback. He didn\u2019t know what Lin Fan meant. But very soon, he understood.</p><br/><p>*crack!*</p><br/><p>Ah!</p><br/><p>The screams rang out once more. His arm got dislocated again and it was more painful than being hit by Wang Ming Yang. It was completely unbearable.</p><br/><p>\u201cStop! Stop right now!\u201d Chen He yelled with fear in his eyes.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang, who was standing at the side, shuddered when he saw this. When did his Brother become so playful?</p><br/><p>Those sounds were enough to make one\u2019s hair stand in fear.</p><br/><p>It was f*cking terrifying.</p><br/><p>Time passed. Second by second, minute by minute.</p><br/><p>Everyone at the scene was dripping with sweat. They had gotten accustomed to Chief Chen\u2019s screams. Dislocated. Fixed. Dislocated. Fixed again. This process kept repeating and it seemed to be never-ending.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang was sweating in fear. \u201cZi Le, even I\u2019m a little afraid.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xu Zi Le nodded, \u201cI\u2019m scared too, Ming Yang. Brother Lin is vicious.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen He kept on screaming unceasingly. He was close to fainting. His whole body was soaked with sweat. He had been tortured so much that he was about to fall apart.</p><br/><p>\u201cBig Bro, stop. Please, stop. I was wrong. I know that I was wrong now\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh!\u201d</p><br/><p>His screams rang out.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at Chen He. \u201cYou know your mistake now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen He immediately nodded, \u201cI really know my mistake now. Please don\u2019t keep going. I can\u2019t take it anymore. I\u2019ll go crazy.\u201d</p><br/><p>He already lost count of how many times he had endured that pain. He just felt that his heart was going to crumble soon.</p><br/><p>A deep sense of fear had seeped into Chen He\u2019s heart. Previously, he wouldn\u2019t give in and he had wanted to take revenge but now, that thought had gone to the back of his mind. All he wanted to do was quickly leave Shanghai and be as far away as possible from this frightening place.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded and patted him on the shoulder. \u201cI\u2019m not an unreasonable man and I don\u2019t like using violence but you were a little unbridled. Zi Le is my Little Sister. You were wrong to hit her, don\u2019t you think so?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen He immediately nodded, \u201cI was wrong. It was my mistake.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard that you are very powerful in the North. Are you going to take revenge when you go back there?\u201d asked Lin Fan calmly.</p><br/><p>Chen He shook his head, \u201cI won\u2019t, I really won\u2019t. Today, I made a mistake. I shouldn\u2019t have told her to drink. I shouldn\u2019t have tried to take advantage of her.\u201d</p><br/><p>When fear reaches a certain level, it turns into a darkness in one\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>If this Chen He really wanted to take revenge, Wang Ming Yang would be fine but Xu Zi Le might not be, unless she doesn\u2019t go to the North anymore. But was that possible?</p><br/><p>Definitely not.</p><br/><p>\u201cLook at me,\u201d said Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Chen He looked up at Lin Fan. Lin Fan was seeing through Chen He\u2019s heart. Then, he turned to Xu Zi Le to see if anything would happen to her. His heart relaxed and he patted Chen He on the head. \u201cIt\u2019s good that you are tactful. I believe that after this lesson, you\u2019ll remember it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, yes.\u201d Chen He nodded.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled and stretch his arm out. \u201cI\u2019m getting a little hungry. Let\u2019s eat, Chief Chen. Today is a good day, it\u2019s the finalization of the show. We can\u2019t just leave halfway, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWaiter, bring us two more sets of cutlery.\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Jin and the rest were dumbfounded. They had not expected Chief Chen to really be terrified. He wasn\u2019t just a little frightened. He was so frightened that it had probably left an emotional scar on him.</p><br/><p>\u201cChief Wang, Master Lin, please sit.\u201d Director Chen and another member of the production crew offered their seats.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled and waved his hand. \u201cNo need. We just need to squeeze a little bit. Today is the day of the finalization, we can\u2019t let anything affect our mood.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, Lin Fan said with a smile, \u201cEveryone, don\u2019t be anxious. I, Lin Fan, am a loving person. I hope that you all will not be frightened. Let us eat.\u201d</p><br/><p>Those workers were cursing in their hearts. This was called loving? That was simply inconceivable.</p><br/><p>Director Jin said, \u201cRight, right. Master Lin is right. We\u2019ve always noticed you on Weibo. You are so loving and so kind. We all admire you very much. For Master Lin to be able to attend our finalization banquet, it is a great honor. Let me propose a toast to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled, \u201cDirector Jin, you\u2019re too courteous. Let\u2019s drink together. I wish for you all to increase your viewership ratings.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, Lin Fan and Director Jin\u2019s conversation left everyone else at a loss for words. This turn of events was too quick, wasn\u2019t it?</p><br/><p>Just a while ago, things had erupted in a ruckus and it had been very terrifying. Now, the atmosphere was peaceful and friendly. Even a f*cking movie wouldn\u2019t be like this.</p><br/><p>And Chief Chen was now obediently sitting there emotionlessly. Even when he looked at Lin Fan, he didn\u2019t have a shred of anger on his face, instead, there was reverence and fear.</p><br/><p>At that moment, they understood that Chief Chen had had fear instilled in him.</p><br/><p>In the office.</p><br/><p>\u201cChief Liu, it has ended,\u201d reported one of the service staff.</p><br/><p>Liu Xu asked, \u201cHow\u2019s Chief He? Has he left?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, Master Lin and the rest are all eating now and that Chief Chen has returned to his seat to eat too.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Xu was startled. She looked doubtfully at her employees. \u201cAre you teasing me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, they\u2019re really eating. It looks like nothing has happened at all. The atmosphere is pretty good.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Xu was dumbfounded. What the f*ck was going on? Just a while ago, someone was about to get killed but now, everything was peaceful and well. They were even sitting down and eating together? That didn\u2019t make any sense!</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>At the banquet.</p><br/><p>The situation was very awkward. No one could figure out how this current atmosphere had developed.</p><br/><p>Besides Lin Fan and Chen He, everyone else was very suspicious. Something was wrong. According to the previous situation, there shouldn\u2019t be this kind of atmosphere at all.</p></div>\n</div>"}

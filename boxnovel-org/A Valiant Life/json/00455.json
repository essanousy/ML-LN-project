That Lil\u2019 Fatty was the child with outstanding memory. Although he was chubby, he was very well-liked.</p><br/><p>Lil\u2019 Fatty ran over swiftly. In the past, he used to be in a wheelchair and he had already been very lively then. Now that he could run, he was even livelier.</p><br/><p>\u201cGrandpa\u2026\u201d Lil\u2019 Fatty stood in front of Zhao Ming Qing and smiled as his mucus flowed down from his nostrils.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome, extend your leg for Grandpa to see,\u201d said Zhao Ming Qing.</p><br/><p>Lil\u2019 Fatty extended his leg, then said, \u201cGrandpa, you\u2019ve already touched it many times. If you touch it any more, I\u2019ll be frightened.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCheeky boy,\u201d said Zhao Ming Qing as he rubbed Lil\u2019 Fatty\u2019s head. Then, he pressed down, \u201cIs there anywhere uncomfortable?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lil\u2019 Fatty shook his head, \u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing nodded. He was someone who had witnessed miracles. He had immense respect and admiration for his teacher\u2019s medical abilities. If he were able to learn a tenth of his teacher\u2019s abilities in his lifetime, he would be satisfied.</p><br/><p>Zhou Qing Quan and Wang Tian Feng looked at the children around them and sighed, \u201cWho would be so cruel to throw all these healthy children out?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing looked afar at those children who were in wheelchairs and helplessly shook his head. Those children had limbs missing and could no longer be treated using any medical methods.</p><br/><p>They had been irreparably damaged.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Zhao Ming Qing wanted to tell them that those healthy children that they were seeing were all previously in wheelchairs. But after thinking, he decided to forget it. It was best not to talk about this.</p><br/><p>*beep beep*</p><br/><p>At that moment, the sound of horns came from afar.</p><br/><p>Lil Fatty was being checked by Zhao Ming Qing but when he heard these sounds, he immediately ran. \u201cUncles and Aunties are here\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing laughed, \u201cLet\u2019s go as well. My teacher is here.</p><br/><p>Zhou Qing Quan and Wang Tian Feng were instantly energized. In just a moment, they would be able to see Elder Zhao\u2019s teacher. They were even feeling a little nervous.</p><br/><p>It was like looking at a very high mountain and feeling the pressure from it, accompanied by a feeling of exhilaration.</p><br/><p>Outside.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan stopped his car. He looked at the dignified and strong-looking children who were gathered at the railing, staring unblinkingly at him and he waved his hand.</p><br/><p>When the children saw the snacks in these Uncles and Aunties\u2019 hands, they started crying out in joy.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan turned around and said to the shop owners, \u201cWhen we go in, don\u2019t be too shocked.\u201d</p><br/><p>The shop owners were taken aback and had no idea what Little Boss meant.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan patted Zhao Zhong Yang and said, \u201cDon\u2019t broadcast yet. Let the situation stabilize a little first.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang understood what Brother Lin meant. He was the only person in the shop who knew of the changes. When he came to Nanshan Children\u2019s Welfare Institute the previous time, he had seen the children recover back to health.</p><br/><p>If he hadn\u2019t seen it with his own eyes, he wouldn\u2019t have believed it.</p><br/><p>Then, he directed his gaze at the surrounding shop owners and started laughing to himself. He wondered how they would react when they saw it for themselves later on.</p><br/><p>He really had complete admiration for Brother Lin\u2019s abilities.</p><br/><p>Director Huang and Han Lu came, both with smiles on their faces. The surrounding shop owners held packets of snacks in their hands as they greeted the children, \u201cWe\u2019re here\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you miss your Uncles and Aunties?\u201d</p><br/><p>The children replied with one voice, \u201cYes!\u201d Then, they abandoned the railings and ran to the main entrance to get their snacks.</p><br/><p>Just as the shop owners were about to say something, they saw the children running and jumping around full of energy and were completely dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>*clatter*</p><br/><p>The bags of snacks in their hands fell onto the ground.</p><br/><p>Each of them stared with wide eyes and gaping mouths at this scene as if they had seen a ghost.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis can\u2019t be. Did we come to the wrong place?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGod d*mn, what\u2019s going on? How come they\u2019re all okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is the right place. This is Nanshan Children\u2019s Welfare Institute.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLil\u2019 Fatty, you\u2026how can you walk?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lil\u2019 Fatty wiped his mucus and said, \u201cOf course I can walk.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn. Is anyone going to tell us what the heck happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, everyone looked towards Director Huang. \u201cDirector Huang, what exactly is going on?\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Huang was helpless as she turned her gaze to Lin Fan, \u201cYou have to ask Master Lin about that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Uproar!</p><br/><p>The crowd all fixed their gazes on Little Boss, waiting for his explanation. This was too astonishing. The previous two times they had come, these children had been sitting in wheelchairs but now, they were energetically running and jumping about like normal children.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled and said, \u201cDidn\u2019t I already tell you all? My medical abilities are great. But none of you believed me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Zhang said, \u201cD*mn, this\u2026this\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Liang, \u201cAm I seeing things? How is that possible?\u201d</p><br/><p>The shop owners were suddenly speechless as they looked at Lin Fan as if they had seen ghosts. They had never thought that this would happen and they didn\u2019t even dare to think about it. But now that it was right in front of their eyes, they had to believe it.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian had a dumbfounded look on his face. He looked at Lin Fan and asked, \u201cYou made them well?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled, \u201cWhat is it? Do you think it\u2019s not possible?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn. You\u2026you\u2026\u201d Fraud Tian placed one hand on his chest as if he was about to be shocked to death by Lin Fan\u2019s f*cking awesomeness. He had never thought that this kid would have such an ability.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen those medical qualifications that you showed us last time were real?\u201d Fraud Tian asked.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded, \u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, that means that you have medical skills?\u201d Fraud Tian couldn\u2019t feel at peace without clarifying things.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded once more, \u201cThat\u2019s right. Everything you\u2019ve said is right.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan stared at Lin Fan. Huge waves started pulsing within her heart and she couldn\u2019t recover from her daze. Although she knew that Brother Lin was brilliant, she didn\u2019t know he was this brilliant.</p><br/><p>They all knew about the situation in the Children\u2019s Welfare Institute but such a drastic change had occurred since the last time they had come. How could they not be astonished?</p><br/><p>Zhou Qing Quan was standing nearby and he asked, \u201cElder Zhao, is that your teacher?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing nodded, \u201cMmm.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on now?\u201d Zhou Qing Quan had no idea what was going on but he felt as if everyone was in shock. What were they shocked about?</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing looked at Zhou Qing Quan and revealed a mysterious smile.</p><br/><p>But when Zhou Qing Quan saw his smile, he felt like hitting him. This Elder Zhao was going to f*cking keep him in suspense once again.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the crowd and said, \u201cWhat are you all doing? These expressions aren\u2019t quite right.\u201d</p><br/><p>Someone in the crowd said, \u201cLittle Boss, please don\u2019t speak for now. Let us recuperate.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shook his head helplessly. Then, he looked at the children who were standing in their original positions and clapped his hands. \u201cHurry up and grab your snacks. Just leave them standing there. It\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWaa\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The children cried out in joy and charged towards the snacks.</p></div>\n</div>"}

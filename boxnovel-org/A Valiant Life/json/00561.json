He didn\u2019t expect Elder Dog to not care about him anymore after having a son. He wanted to give him some good stuff but he just ignored him. It was pretty heartbreaking.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be leaving now, look after the shop.\u201d Lin Fan wanted to continue experimenting.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan asked, \u201cBrother Lin, you just came to the shop. Why are you in a hurry to leave?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled, \u201cI\u2019ve something on.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan left, Fraud Tian asked, \u201cWhat happened this time? He\u2019s acting so secretive.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan said helplessly, \u201cWho knows? Brother Lin never tells us anything. We wouldn\u2019t know anything.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhongyang touched his chin, \u201cHey, I\u2019ve been feeling lost lately and I wanna get a girlfriend.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian looked at Zhao Zhongyang, \u201cWhat girlfriend? Isn\u2019t it nice to be with me? You can eat and drink every day and you can return home to sleep after that. How comfortable.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang looked at Fraud Tian and chuckled, \u201cOld man.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Lin Fan drove to the electronics store and bought an induction cooker, as well as some boards. After which, he went to an isolated area. There was temporarily no electricity there. However, there was a single-story house nearby. He connected power strips from the house to where he was.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha! I\u2019ve prepared everything. Netizens, I believed in nobody but you. Don\u2019t disappoint me.\u201d Lin Fan placed a serving of ingredients into it and added water. However, he didn\u2019t understand it. How was he going to form a round pill?</p><br/><p>Could it be that he needed to mound it into a ball?</p><br/><p>That was perhaps the case.</p><br/><p>He switched on the electricity.</p><br/><p><em>buzz</em></p><br/><p>Everything was duly prepared and Lin Fan was squatting there in excitement. He looked at the changes in the pot and smiled. The herbal medicine started to change in the pot. They started to flare up and water vapor started to rise from the pot.</p><br/><p>An hour later!</p><br/><p>The changes in the pot were still the same, there weren\u2019t any shocking changes.</p><br/><p>Then, Lin Fan went to his car and lied down to rest. He had to succeed in creating the pill.</p><br/><p>However, Lin Fan thought of something. Should he go to the Taoist temple to speak to the Taoist priests? Perhaps he could become good friends with them.</p><br/><p>Anyway, he soon forgot about the idea.</p><br/><p>The Encyclopedia\u2019s knowledge classification was determined by the knowledge of those that were close to the host or those that admired the host.</p><br/><p>To befriend Taoist priests at the temple in order to achieve something good was just unacceptable.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, the Encyclopedia was cunning. It might even make things difficult for him. If it doesn\u2019t choose a person close to the host, then he\u2019d be dead.</p><br/><p>Soon, he fell asleep.</p><br/><p>2 hours passed.</p><br/><p>3 hours passed.</p><br/><p>8 hours passed.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the time when he woke up. Then, he smiled, \u201cIt\u2019s been so long. It should be time now. I\u2019m really quite excited to see if the pill has been formed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, Lin Fan walked towards the induction cooker with anticipation. When he looked into it, his face changed.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis\u2026?\u201d Lin Fan didn\u2019t understand what happened. Then, he gasped, \u201cWhat the hell is this dark and swarthy thing?\u201d</p><br/><p>He only saw a lump of black goo and he didn\u2019t know that was. He opened the pot and he could only smell a strong and pungent smell. The black goo, which looked like mud, even had bubbles on it.</p><br/><p>It was extremely disgusting.</p><br/><p>D*mn it!</p><br/><p>He f*cked up.</p><br/><p>He trusted in the wrong people.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was furious with the netizens that offered him the solution. He wanted to kill them.</p><br/><p>He got pranked again for believing in them.</p><br/><p>Ding ding!</p><br/><p>Then, the phone rang.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was frustrated, \u201cMing Qing, what\u2019s up?\u201d</p><br/><p>Through the phone, Zhao Ming Qing felt that his mentor didn\u2019t sound too happy. He asked, \u201cTeacher, what\u2019s wrong? Did something happen?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan sighed. \u201cNothing much. My pill creation failed again. The pressure cooker exploded and the induction cooker ended up with goo. I\u2019m not really in a good mood.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Zhao Ming Qing was stunned. \u201cTeacher, why would you use such equipment for pill creation? The people of the past deserve to be praised for their intelligence. Even so, you\u2019d need an alchemy furnace to create pills now. Without it, how could you create any pills?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled, \u201cYou know how to create pills?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing replies, \u201cI don\u2019t really understand it too. According to my research, I know the key points to take note when making pills.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was elated when he heard that, \u201cMing Qing, wait for me at the medical academy. I\u2019ll come over now.\u201d</p><br/><p>He immediately hung up and took another look at the induction cooker. Then, he got into his car and sped to Shanghai\u2019s First Chinese Medical Academy.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing was a little stunned. What was his mentor doing? However, when he thought that his mentor used an induction cooker to create pills, he laughed. It was a joke.</p><br/><p>At Shanghai\u2019s First Chinese Medical Academy.</p><br/><p>In the office.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing replied, \u201cTeacher, why did you start creating pills?\u201d</p><br/><p>Before the product was out, he wasn\u2019t going to tell them anything. He wanted to create the Little Intelligence pill first. Then, he grabbed onto Zhao Ming Qing\u2019s hand. \u201cLet\u2019s not talk too much. Where can I buy the alchemy furnace?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing was only a beginner in the creation of pills. He read some old books but he didn\u2019t know much about it. \u201cThe antique market should have it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go to the antique market to take a look,\u201d Lin Fan immediately replied. He wanted to go there and buy an alchemy furnace regardless of the cost.</p><br/><p>His pill creation mustn\u2019t be interfered by anyone.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing was stunned. He didn\u2019t know what his mentor was doing. However, since his mentor wanted to create pills, he had to follow him to do it.</p><br/><p>At the antique market.</p><br/><p>There were quite a lot of people. Most of them were there to buy treasures that they felt a connection with.</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan and Zhao Ming Wing appeared, nobody really noticed them. After all, there were only two types of people that went there.</p><br/><p>They walked around.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see it,\u201d Lin Fan was a little disappointed.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing replied, \u201cTeacher, are you really into pill creation? The alchemy furnace can be found in antique markets but they\u2019re just for decoration. Those ancient alchemy furnaces are extremely rare.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan didn\u2019t want to give up, \u201cLet\u2019s walk around a little longer.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright,\u201d Zhao Ming Qing nodded. Since his mentor wanted to walk around, he had to follow suit.</p><br/><p>As they walked, he was still curious about it.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, do you really want the alchemy furnace to craft pills?\u201d Zhao Ming Qing couldn\u2019t imagine it at all. He didn\u2019t know his mentor knew how to craft pills.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded, \u201cYeah, that\u2019s what I want to do.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing couldn\u2019t understand what his mentor was thinking. Creation of pills was famous in the ancient times but most of them were scams. It was like a form of purification and the final products were usually poisonous.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

The townsfolk are getting impatient. Huh? Where did this son of a b*tch come from? We're eating dog meat tonight?\"</p><br/><p>Elder Dog Nicholas was unafraid of the new environment and had a blank look on his face. However, when he heard Fraud Tian's words, he instantly bared his teeth and started barking.</p><br/><p>\"Hey, this is meaningful,\" Fraud Tian stepped forward, grabbing the soft meat on Nicholas' neck. He said, \"It's a male. Let me be the chef tonight. We'll buy some wine. It'll nourish our bodies.\"</p><br/><p>Woof woof!</p><br/><p>Elder Dog Nicholas was pissed. However, with his four short limbs, he was no match for Fraud Tian. Then, with a twist of his body, he sprayed a stream of urine straight at Fraud Tian's face.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian put the little white dog down immediately. He picked up a tissue and started wiping himself, \"This son of a bitch! He dares to pee on my face?\"</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan hugged and picked up the dog, \"What a cute doggy! It has such white fur, it's so cute! Where did it come from, Master Lin?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was still angry with the encyclopedia, but it had been done and he had to accept it. He said, \"I picked him up on the road. From now on, he'll be raised in the shop.\"</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang, who was just doing a live broadcast, burst into laughter. He pointed the lens at Fraud Tian, \"Elder Tian just got sprayed in the face by a dog\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"666...the nobleman has been shot!\"</p><br/><p>\"This dog is really arrogant, to dare to make a fool even of a nobleman. It'll be difficult for it to escape death tonight.</p><br/><p>\"Please tell us the name of this dog bro.\"</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang asked, \"Master Lin, what's this little white dog's name? If it hasn't been named yet, we can give it a name.\"</p><br/><p>The broadcast room was astir.</p><br/><p>\"I suggest we call him dog face.\"</p><br/><p>\"Dog face my a*s! Why not call him the top dog?\"</p><br/><p>\"Dog bro sounds better.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \"He already has a name. He's Elder Dog Nicholas.\"</p><br/><p>*snorts*</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang couldn't help but laugh, \"Brothers, did you hear that? Dog bro is called Elder Dog Nicholas. What a powerful name!\"</p><br/><p>\"Master Lin 666\u2026as expected of Master Lin, to come up with such a powerful name.\"</p><br/><p>As the people were discussing the little white dog's name, Lin Fan was thinking about how he would complete the task, but after a long while, he couldn't think of anything. He decided to let it go and not think about it. It was better to take it slow. There was no rush.</p><br/><p>However, this animal speech encyclopedic knowledge was really not good for earning encyclopedic points.</p><br/><p>In the end, Lin Fan's final conclusion was that this task and class of knowledge was pretty f*cked up.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Elder Dog Nicholas was lying on Wu You Lan's thighs. He squinted his eyes as if savoring that temporary moment of peace.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian was still unhappy about the dog pissing on his face. He walked back and forth by the side, yelling at the little white dog.</p><br/><p>Woof woof!</p><br/><p>The little white dog leaped off Wu You Lan's thighs. Eyes gleaming with an ominous glint, it bared its teeth and barked.</p><br/><p>Of course, to the rest of them, they had no idea what his barks meant.</p><br/><p>However, Lin Fan understood. He was introducing himself.</p><br/><p>\"My name is Elder Dog Nicholas\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the time. It was already past nine.</p><br/><p>He was a little late. Some of the townsfolk had left because they had to go to work. Still, the queue was snaking.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan opened his mouth and said, \"Leave him alone and give out the number tags quickly.\"</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian gave the little white dog a few provoking looks, then proceeded to give out the number tags. Zhao Zhong Yang was doing a broadcast on his phone. All the netizens in the broadcast room were gasping in awe.</p><br/><p>\"Is that the rumored scallion pancake?\"</p><br/><p>\"It used to be all the talk on the internet. Those scallion pancakes are said to be nearly impossible to get no matter how rich you are. However, I'm too far from Shanghai, so I don't really know just what kind of magic powers it possesses.</p><br/><p>\"We're in luck. I never thought that I would be able to see the rumored scallion pancakes. Brother Yang, you have to film it clearly.\"</p><br/><p>\"There's no need for words. Just looking at the crowd, I'm amazed.\"</p><br/><p>Zhang Zhong Yang had never eaten the scallion pancakes before. His heart was full of curiosity, wondering just how delicious those rumored scallion pancakes were.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan stood in front of the stall as both of his hands moved non-stop.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Elder Dog Nicholas lay at the entrance of the shop, quietly observing the scene before him.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, a fragrant smell gently entered Elder Dog Nicholas's nostrils. He stood on all fours instantly, fixing his dog eyes on the stall.</p><br/><p>A dog's nose is very sensitive. What people could smell, dogs would smell it amplified over a hundred times, maybe even a thousand times.</p><br/><p>Humans typically only have about five million receptors in their nose, while a dog has around two hundred and twenty of them. This difference has a huge impact on their sense of smell.</p><br/><p>The fragrance produced by the freshly-fried scallion pancakes was almost enough to make the townsfolk lose all restraint. To a dog, which was so much more sensitive than humans, it was irresistible.</p><br/><p>Woof woof!</p><br/><p>Elder Dog Nicholas: \"I want to eat\u2026I want to eat\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Elder Dog Nicholas started pacing back and forth around Lin Fan's feet impatiently.</p><br/><p>One of the townsfolk said, \"Little Boss, you're raising a dog now?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled, \"I picked him up on the road. He's pretty cute.\"</p><br/><p>The townsfolk laughed, \"This looks like a Formosan Mountain dog. Little Boss should raise a better breed.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed a little but didn't reply. In the past, there was a wolfdog at his grandmother's place. It was obedient and very loyal to its owner, but in the end, it got poisoned and died.</p><br/><p>Some of the townsfolk noticed the little dog's movement and laughed, \"Looks like even the dog knows how delicious Little Boss' scallion pancakes are. It keeps barking.\"</p><br/><p>The servings of scallion pancakes were prepared, one by one.</p><br/><p>The netizens in the broadcast room were dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>\"D*mn. Is there a need to be so exaggerated? That expression is way too devilish.\"</p><br/><p>\"If I didn't have so much trust in Master Lin, I would think that this is all an act.\"</p><br/><p>\"Ahh god d*mn, that expression and those emotions. It's as if\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"Even I want to eat it after seeing this. Just how do those scallion pancakes taste? Have you eaten them before, Brother Yang?\"</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang stared blankly at the scene. \"I haven't eaten them before either,\" he said in a sad tone.</p><br/><p>After the ten servings of scallion pancakes had been prepared, Lin Fan made a few more servings, one each for Zhao Zhong Yang and the rest. As for Elder Dog Nicholas, he only gave him half a serving.</p><br/><p>When Zhao Zhong Yang received the scallion pancake, he took a bite impatiently. He had braced himself, but upon take that bite, his expression changed instantly.</p><br/><p>The netizens watching the broadcast were astounded.</p><br/><p>\"Brother Yang, don't be like that. Just how does it taste\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"Brother Yang, don't put on an act. You're making it hard for us.\"</p><br/><p>Zhang Zhong Yang's initially calm expression instantly turned into an outrageous expression. His eyes widened as he felt his taste buds explode. A taste which he had not experienced before filled his entire mouth. His spirit was lifted up. It was an indescribable feeling.</p><br/><p>Zhang Zhong Yang slowly came to his senses, then he faced the camera lens and exclaimed,\"Delicious. It's really too delicious! I've never eaten such a delicious scallion pancake in my life. I felt such a rush that I wanted to start crying.\"</p><br/><p>Netizens: \"...\"</p><br/><p>Elder Dog Nicholas finished that half a serving of scallion pancake. His dog face was full of satisfaction. He licked around his mouth, then laid down at the entrance again with all four limbs spread open. He exposed his round belly, stuck out his tongue and let out a deep breath of air. That happy and carefree expression made the townsfolk very envious.</p><br/><p>\"I wish I was that dog\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"...\" Lin Fan was speechless.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

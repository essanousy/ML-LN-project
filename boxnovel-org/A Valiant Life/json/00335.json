We're just missing you.\"</p><br/><p>Autumn Sword Fish Killer's face was still a little red but it wasn't too obvious. Zhang Meng Jun asked curiously, \"Why is your face so red? You got tired from taking the elevator up? I think you really should lose some weight.\"</p><br/><p>Once losing weight was brought up, Autumn Sword Fish Killer felt a little heartache. Then, he laughed embarrassedly, \"I've been trying to lose weight recently and it has already produced significant results.\"</p><br/><p>Zhang Meng Jun didn't say much and just pulled Ou Bai Qi over to that side.</p><br/><p>Autumn Sword Fish Killer's heart was not at peace at all at that moment. He felt as if he was going to be exposed and he didn't know what he should do when he sees Liu Jia Hui.</p><br/><p>Zhang Meng Jun said to the crowd, \"Bai Qi is here. He's here\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Autumn Sword Fish Killer resisted the embarrassment and walked out. When his gigantic body was revealed, the crowd couldn't stop from bursting into laughter with a 'pfft' sound.</p><br/><p>Wu Hao Yun gasped in shock, \"He's way too fat, isn't he? Things really change very quickly. Although it's been several years, this change is really too tragic.\"</p><br/><p>Liu Jia Hui nudged Wu Hao Yun, indicating for him to not say things like that.</p><br/><p>The surrounding classmates, after laughing, also felt that that was a little out of hand. They then regained their composure and said, \"Bai Qi, out of all of us classmates, you've gone through the biggest change.\"</p><br/><p>\"Yeah! I almost didn't recognize you.\"</p><br/><p>Autumn Sword Fish Killer laughed embarrassedly but in his heart, he was hurting. F*ck\u2026 Maybe I shouldn't have come. Now that he was here, he could only bear the shame and pretend that nothing was wrong. Getting laughed at was something he was already very used to. Especially when he had been in the gym, he had been laughed at countless times.</p><br/><p>He took out a large red packet from his pocket and said, \"I wish for you two to be together for a hundred years.\"</p><br/><p>Liu Jia Hui received the red pack and replied, \"Thank you.\" Then, she realized that the red packet was quite thick. \"Bai Qi, just being here is good enough. You didn't have to give so much.\"</p><br/><p>Autumn Sword Fish Killer smiled and said, \"It's not a problem.\"</p><br/><p>The surrounding people looked at that red pack and then looked at each other. Wu Hao Yun laughed, \"Back then, you were famous in school for being thrifty. I never thought that after entering society for these few years, you'd have changed so much, giving so generously.\"</p><br/><p>Autumn Sword Fish Killer looked at Wu Hao Yun and smiled, \"I hope that you'll take good care of Jia Hui.\"</p><br/><p>Wu Hao Yun glanced at Autumn Sword Fish Killer, then grabbed Jia Hui and gave her a kiss. \"Aren't you just talking nonsense? She's my wife! If I don't treat her well, who would I treat well? Moreover, she already has my child in her belly. I have to take even better care of her.\"</p><br/><p>Autumn Sword Fish Killer laughed awkwardly. Seeing his first love being pulled into another man's embrace and even having another man's child was painful. \"Alright, I've already made an appearance here. I still have other things to do. I'm going to leave now.\"</p><br/><p>He couldn't stay any longer. It would only be more embarrassing for him. Since he had already come to take a look, it was about time to leave.</p><br/><p>Zhang Meng Jun stopped him and said, \"Don't leave yet. Since you're here already, let's spend some time together.\"</p><br/><p>Liu Jia Hui nodded in agreement. \"Yeah, since you're already here, let's all go in and have a look together.\"</p><br/><p>Wu Hao Yun looked at Autumn Sword Fish Killer with a little disdain in his eyes. But it was a joyous occasion, so he didn't do anything overboard. He no longer thought much of this ex-competitor of his.</p><br/><p>They all took a group photo together.</p><br/><p>Zhang Meng Jun walked with Autumn Sword Fish Killer, then said softly, \"If I knew that you were this fat now, I think I would've told you not to come.\"</p><br/><p>Autumn Sword Fish Killer stopped. \"Why?\"</p><br/><p>Zhang Meng Jun shook his head. \"Isn't it embarrassing? You know too that Wu Hao Yun has always disliked you. Do you really think that Jia Hui invited you over to share this joyous occasion with you? She wants you to see how good she's doing now. She frequently asks our classmates about you as well and she knows that you aren't doing too good. She wanted you to come so you would know that she's living a fortunate and worry-free life. Liu Jia Hui has gone through significant changes these few years and she's no longer the same Liu Jia Hui from before. Don't think so well of her.\"</p><br/><p>Autumn Sword Fish Killer was dumbfounded. His heart suddenly started aching as he said in disbelief, \"That can't be true.\"</p><br/><p>Zhang Meng Jun laughed, \"You really are stupid. I told you even though you would be upset to save you from being kept in the dark. Why do you think Jia Hui broke up with you back then? That's because of Wu Hao Yun. As for the reason behind that, I don't need to say it. You should know. You were the only one who was kept in the dark back then, thinking that she broke up with you because you two went to different schools. \"</p><br/><p>\"How could that be?\" Autumn Sword Fish Killer felt that the purest part deep in his heart had suddenly been tainted black.</p><br/><p>\"Alright. It's alright now that you know. After all, so many years have passed and things aren't the same as back then when we were kids. Don't think so highly of Liu Jia Hui. Let's sit over there and have a nice chat,\" said Zhang Meng Jun with a pat on Autumn Sword Fish Killer's shoulder. Then, he couldn't help but say once more, \"How did you get so fat in these few years? If I had known earlier, I really would've told you not to come.\"</p><br/><p>Autumn Sword Fish Killer suddenly lost his spirit. He felt as if he had descended into icy water and his heart was cold and chilly.</p><br/><p>He was already at the banquet and he didn't know what to do.</p><br/><p>Behind him.</p><br/><p>Wu Hao Yun roared with laughter, \"Haha, I'm dying of laughter. Ou Bai Qi has fallen into this sad state. He's barely surviving and he has no money. When compared to me, it's like comparing heaven and earth.\"</p><br/><p>Liu Jia Hui opened the red packet. \"2888\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Wu Hao Yun glanced at it, then said, \"Hah, that's generous. But it can't even buy half a bag for you. Now you know that picking me back then was a wise decision. Otherwise, you would have to face someone like him.\"</p><br/><p>Liu Jia Hui shot a glare at Wu Hao Yun and said, \"What are you talking about? He made the effort to come here so stop mocking him. Also, back then, I didn't know things. You always bullied me, that's why I had to find someone who didn't bully me.\"</p><br/><p>Wu Hao Yun laughed a little, \"Back then I bullied you every day and you even said that it felt good\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"No good words come out of your mouth. I'm ignoring you,\" said Liu Jia Hui flirtatiously.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The banquet commenced.</p><br/><p>The chief witness of the wedding was the boss of a certain enterprise, Huang Zhi Qiang. In a wedding, a chief witness could serve as a display of one's family's social standing and interpersonal connections.</p><br/><p>When the witnessing ceremony was over, Huang Zhi Qiang went in front of a middle-aged man and said, \"Brother Wu, I have a table next door. I'm going over there now.\"</p><br/><p>Wu Heng Liang asked, \"Chief Huang, who're all those people next door?\"</p><br/><p>Huang Zhi Qiang smiled. \"They're all old friends of mine. I have to go over for a bit.\"</p><br/><p>Wu Heng Liang nodded. \"You're the chief witness. I'll get the kids to go over to your side for a toast later on.\"</p><br/><p>Huang Zhi Qiang replied, \"Sure, that's not a problem but tell the kids to be mindful and not to speak any nonsense. Some of the people there are people that not even I can handle. They're all big figures in Shanghai. And honestly, I wasn't able to come here at first but luckily, the location of our meeting changed and it became the same as the wedding. Isn't that really coincidental?\"</p><br/><p>Wu Heng Liang said, \"Yeah, yeah. I definitely have to bring the kids over there later on.\"</p><br/><p>Huang Zhi Qiang was already a big figure to Wu Heng Liang. When he heard that there were even more significant individuals next door, it was simply too thrilling for Wu Heng Liang. It was a must for him to bring the kids over to have a toast as a courtesy.</p><br/><p>...</p><br/>\n</div>"}

They just stared at Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Wu Tian He was astonished. His expression was one of worry. \u201cAre you really going to Qingzhou?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Lin Fan nodded. \u201cIn the beginning, I didn\u2019t think of this. But since I have already thought of it, Qingzhou is somewhere I have to go.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Wu Tian He couldn\u2019t understand why. Everything is well so why did he suddenly have the idea to go over to Qingzhou?</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed, \u201cThere\u2019s no particular reason. I just want to get an explanation from Wang Ming Yang and at the same time, get rid of that scoundrel.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat has this got to do with Wang Ming Yang?\u201d Wu Tian He couldn\u2019t comprehend the situation. Even Fraud Tian couldn\u2019t understand what was going on. This was absolutely not thinking it through. Everything was fine so why did he have to go to Qingzhou? Moreover, under this circumstances, going to Qingzhou is as good as digging your own grave.</p><br/><p>Even though his life wouldn\u2019t be in danger, but he would definitely be tortured over there.</p><br/><p>It would be like a sheep entering a tiger\u2019s mouth. He wouldn\u2019t be able to escape even if he wanted.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was all smiles. He had complete self-confidence. Even if he did not have the big classification knowledge of wuxia, he would still dare to confront Qingzhou. What more can be said now that he does have the big classification knowledge of wuxia? What would happen if he does go to Qingzhou?</p><br/><p>Where on this Earth did he need to avoid?</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan knew that it wouldn\u2019t be safe in Qingzhou. \u201cBrother Lin, can you not go? Don\u2019t let all of us worry.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRelax. Nothing will happen. Nobody can harm me,\u201d Lin Fan said with complete confidence in himself.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian said, \u201cDon\u2019t get too over-confident! The Ba Gua Zhang might be awesome but it isn\u2019t invincible. Your personal safety can\u2019t be guaranteed. Why not I follow you? At least there would be someone there to help you out.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shook his head, \u201cThere\u2019s no need. With your current abilities, I\u2019m afraid you\u2019ll just be a burden if you go. If anything were to happen to you, I\u2019d still have to take care of you. How troublesome would that be?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck!\u201d Fraud Tian wasn\u2019t happy. \u201cWhy do you make everything sound so horrible? What burden. I admit that I\u2019m no match for you, but I once defeated many enemies in both rural and urban areas!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEnough! With your stature, you should just forget it! It seems that if I don\u2019t put on a show for you guys, you all wouldn\u2019t understand just what my capabilities are. Do you know what this is?\u201d Lin Fan took it out and placed it on the table. It was a metal ball used in ornamental decoration. It was about the size of an apple.</p><br/><p>\u201cA metal ball,\u201d Fraud Tian answered.</p><br/><p>\u201cLook closely.\u201d Lin Fan raised his palm, and with a slight amount of force, something shocking happened. Five fingers were imprinted on the ball.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat the f*ck!\u201d Fraud Tian was flabbergasted. His gaze was one of shock and amazement. He looked as if he had just seen a ghost. He couldn\u2019t believe what had just happened.</p><br/><p>Thereafter, he quickly rushed over and took the ball into his hands. He forcefully pinched the ball. \u201cF*ck! How did you do that? How is this humanly possible?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked extremely proud. \u201cHow\u2019s that? Can you do it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian looked at Lin Fan. He grumbled, \u201cD*mn you! How can you bully others like this? You\u2019re not a human.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan burst out laughing, \u201cWhat kind of bullsh*t are you talking about? Of course, I\u2019m a human. I just can\u2019t stop myself. Let me tell you, I\u2019m a superman, don\u2019t you know? So you all can just relax. With this skill, nobody will be able to hurt me. You all can put your mind to ease.\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, not only was Fraud Tian lost for words, so were Wu You Lan and the others.</p><br/><p>They had not seen such a thing before. He used his hands to mold a metal ball. If they didn\u2019t see this with their own eyes, they wouldn\u2019t believe it for sure.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u201d Fraud Tian held up the metal ball. He looked at it left and right but didn\u2019t find any tricks. How could someone\u2019s hand be able to do such a thing? This wasn\u2019t some kind of a magic trick, is it?</p><br/><p>He had been practicing the Ba Gua Zhang for so long, so it wouldn\u2019t be a problem to break a few bricks. However, it was about molding a metal ball here. He could try molding it for a lifetime but he still wouldn\u2019t even be able to make a dent.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan clapped his hands. He decided to just give the metal ball to Fraud Tian for him to check it out. He had already thought it through. He had to go to Qingzhou, and he had to make it a high-profile visit.</p><br/><p>It was to let Ma Qingzhou know that he was going and to see what he was going to do about it.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, let\u2019s continue. I have to refresh my Weibo. This Ma Qingzhou is really a bad person. I have to know more about him first.\u201d Lin Fan began working hard.</p><br/><p>Everyone shook their heads. They didn\u2019t know what this was all for or why he had such drive to do so. They just didn\u2019t understand.</p><br/><p>At Nanshan Children\u2019s Welfare Institute.</p><br/><p>Even though he had to go Qingzhou, his everyday activities shouldn\u2019t change. The Welfare Institute was still of top priority in his mind.</p><br/><p>When he arrived at the Children\u2019s Welfare Institute, Zhao Mingqing had already arrived. He had brought several books along. They were all children\u2019s books, but they were all related to Chinese medicine. The basis of each story talked about how a small medical doctor helped to treat the illnesses of the poor but was met with problems. However, each time they would not give up and they worked hard to solve the problem. Finally, they would be rewarded with the praise of the patients.</p><br/><p>If they were to read adult story books, it would be too dry and dull for them. It doesn\u2019t have the attraction of a kid\u2019s storybook.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, the children love to read such books!\u201d Zhao Mingqing smiled.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded his head. \u201cGood! Not bad! Such interest should be cultivated from young. Let them read more of such stories. It would help them gain more knowledge.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, I saw the things you posted on Weibo. Is everything alright?\u201d Zhao Mingqing asked worriedly.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat can happen? Let\u2019s not talk about such things. Let\u2019s go see the children\u2019s drawings. I don\u2019t know how much these kids have been practicing,\u201d Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>Not after long, the Chinese art class began.</p><br/><p>This was currently the children\u2019s only interest.</p><br/><p>Lil fatty consumed the little intelligence pill before the others, and so he was smarter than the rest.</p><br/><p>Even though Chinese art was hard work, some skills still required learning.</p><br/><p>After consuming the little intelligence pill, these kids were able to pick up the necessary skills more easily. They even had the correct form of holding the brush. If only their hands weren\u2019t too small, holding the brush would be more convenient, and it would really be amazing.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan walked around the room. He didn\u2019t stop nodding his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cNice! Not bad, your drawing isn\u2019t too bad!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you for your praise, Uncle Lin!\u201d</p><br/><p>The children were very enthusiastic. There was a really big change as compared to before.</p><br/><p>However, the only that gave Lin Fan a headache was that he had to find a way for the crippled to recover fully.</p><br/><p>But with the current circumstances, it would be too challenging.</p><br/><p>Prosthetics? There wasn\u2019t a great deal of use for it.</p><br/><p>Artificial robotic limbs? It was impossible with the current scientific means.</p><br/><p>Forget it. Let\u2019s not that about that for now.</p><br/><p>Lil Fatty brought his painting over, \u201cUncle Lin, look at my drawing! Is it nice?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at it for awhile. He was momentarily stunned. \u201cWow! Lil Fatty! This is amazing! You actually know how to draw scenic mountains and water!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lil Fatty was proud of himself, \u201cI saw this in a book and have remembered it since! Then I painted it myself!\u201d</p><br/><p>If there were someone here, he would definitely be amazed. This was impossible. How could such a young kid be so smart?</p><br/><p>However, Lin Fan knew. This was the magic of the little intelligence pill. His memory was improved. This can be seen from Lil Fatty. It was most likely because of the photographic memory that had improved his memory.</p><br/><p>Sometimes, Lin Fan would wonder why couldn\u2019t he just breed a herd of genius beasts.</p><br/><p>It gave him a slight amount of excitement just thinking about it.</p><br/><p>He had already earned the Encyclopaedic points from the children. The Chinese art already didn\u2019t give him any more Encyclopaedic points. However, the true motive of the Encyclopedia was to cultivate and bring up these children.</p></div>\n</div>"}

What are you all doing? Police comrades, how can you do this? This is private property. You can\u2019t trespass.\u201d</p><br/><p>The security guards had received instruction that no matter what, they had to keep these people out. But in the face of so many people, they were a little weak.</p><br/><p>\u201cMove aside now.\u201d Lin Fan shoved the security guards aside. How could he let them block his way? Then, he waved his hand and yelled, \u201cThe things are inside, don\u2019t let them move the things away.\u201d</p><br/><p>When the reporters heard this, they looked at each other. They felt that this was a little unreasonable but since Master Lin had taken the lead to charge in, they had to charge in as well. Moreover, if it\u2019s really big news, if they are slow and don\u2019t manage to capture the main topic, it would be a great loss.</p><br/><p>The logistics manager rushed out. When he saw that so many reporters had charged in, he panicked. But if he didn\u2019t take responsibility and just ignored them, something really bad would happen.</p><br/><p>He knew in his heart what was in this place. If it is really discovered, then they would be done for.</p><br/><p>\u201cStop right there. What are you all doing?\u201d The manager blocked the path, glaring at Lin Fan and the rest. Then, he looked at the policemen behind and said, \u201cAs policemen, how can you permit such trespassing without any prior investigation? Do you know what we do here? If we lose anything, are you going to take responsibility?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take responsibility,\u201d shouted Lin Fan</p><br/><p>What was there to be afraid of? It was just taking responsibility. Even if he threw away some things, Lin Fan wasn\u2019t afraid.</p><br/><p>The manager was already anxious. \u201cWho are you? What right do you have to take responsibility? I want to call the police.\u201d</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, a number of movers had already gathered. They had received instructions to move the food products away in a short period of time. But to them, the person who gave those instructions was just dreaming.</p><br/><p>There were so many things. Without a full day\u2019s time, how would they be able to move it all?</p><br/><p>The old policeman could not carry on watching. He felt that the way this Master Lin did things was lawless. He stepped forward and said, \u201cWait a moment. I want to ask you, what exactly have you discovered. Without the proper procedures, you don\u2019t have the right to search any company.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan felt that he could not be delayed any longer. Then, he sent a telepathic message to Elder Dog, who was not far away.</p><br/><p>Elder Dog, who had been standing by for orders, had already become impatient long ago. He gave a bark before charging maniacally and knocking the manager onto the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell done.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was delighted when he saw this. Elder Dog was awesome.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy reporter comrades, follow me quickly,\u201d yelled Lin Fan. Without caring about anything else, he started dashing towards the warehouse.</p><br/><p>Of course, the reporters didn\u2019t wait around and say any nonsense. No matter what, today\u2019s incident was going to be something big.</p><br/><p>When they reached the warehouse, a group of workers were working hard to move the things away. Lin Fan bellowed, \u201cStop right now!\u201d</p><br/><p>When the workers saw that so many people had come, they were so frightened that they dropped what they were holding onto the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt stinks!\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporters covered their noses. They could already smell the piercing stench.</p><br/><p>Some of the reporters went forward and looked at the things. Then, their expressions changed. \u201cThese chicken feet and meat\u2026why are their colors so strange?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? What\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporters were puzzled. At the same time, they were enduring that piercing stench.</p><br/><p>When the people from the Food Safety Department saw these things, their expressions changed drastically. They frequently handled food products, how could they not know what these were?</p><br/><p>But this was the first time that they had seen this kind of food products.</p><br/><p>As everyone was in incomparably shock, Lin Fan said something that made everyone\u2019s jaws drop.</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard the people here say that these meat products have already been chilled for tens of years.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d A reporter looked at Lin Fan in disbelief. He felt as if he had misheard him.</p><br/><p><em>Chilled for tens of years?</em></p><br/><p><em>Was it still f*cking edible?</em></p><br/><p>And looking at this warehouse piled with those things, they didn\u2019t dare to imagine how many there were.</p><br/><p><em>If these were to be distributed to the public, how many people would consume them?</em></p><br/><p>*kacha*</p><br/><p>The reporters quickly pressed their camera shutters, recording everything at the scene.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the policemen, \u201cMy police comrades, this is the situation. How do you think this should be resolved?\u201d</p><br/><p>That old policeman was in a daze. He clearly had not expected something like this to happen.</p><br/><p>*ring ring*</p><br/><p>His phone rang.</p><br/><p>The old policeman saw that it was a call from his leader and he immediately answered. On the other end of the call, the leader was displeased it was as if he was blaming them for being dispatched to Godfather Liu\u2019s place.</p><br/><p>However, this situation, to the old policeman, had already surpassed all his expectations.</p><br/><p>\u201cLeader, we\u2019ve discovered something. There\u2019s a problem with this company. Now, the reporters are all here. We need to assist them.\u201d</p><br/><p>When the leader heard this, he was angry and wanted to curse. But suddenly, he stopped.</p><br/><p><em>Did something bad happen?</em></p><br/><p><em>And there were even reporters there?</em></p><br/><p>At the scene.</p><br/><p>The reporters grabbed onto a worker. \u201cHello. May I ask you whether you know where these food products are from?\u201d</p><br/><p>The worker wanted to avoid it. He didn\u2019t want to answer the question.</p><br/><p>They knew that there were problems with these things but they couldn\u2019t say it. Otherwise, things would be bad.</p><br/><p>Hence, they all just shook their heads, pretending not to know.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan took out his phone and opened Weibo. He took a few close-up shots of these things and uploaded the photos.</p><br/><p>\u201cThese disgusting things have finally been pulled out. Everyone, look at these food products. If they weren\u2019t discovered in time, they might have circulated into the market. Everyone might not know what these are but let me explain. These are known as zombie meat or zombie chicken feet. Most of them have been chilled for tens of years. They\u2019re even older than some of you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlso, I\u2019ll conveniently add this. Northeast\u2019s Godfather Liu, you\u2019re way too crooked, to do such a thing.\u201d</p><br/><p>When this Weibo post was uploaded, it instantly caused huge waves on the Internet. Countless netizens were in disbelief when they saw it.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck! Is that true? Tens of years? How can it still be f*cking edible?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cActually, it\u2019s still edible theoretically but I definitely won\u2019t eat it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck your mom. That\u2019s way too disgusting.</p><br/><p>\u201cNortheast\u2019s Godfather Liu? D*mn, Master Lin is finally making a move to save us. As Master Lin\u2019s fan, I feel so lucky.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cZombie meat and zombie chicken feet. That\u2019s really suitable. Looks like it\u2019s GG for whoever eats them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow did these things appear in our country? Don\u2019t the customs do proper checks?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if you don\u2019t want to, you have to submit to Master Lin. Master Lin is just incredible. He has just reached the Northeast and he\u2019s already helping us righteous fans. He has done such a huge good deed. I have to bump this post.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p></div>\n</div>"}

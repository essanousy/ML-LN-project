Whatever information he had, he traded with the police in hopes of a lighter sentence.</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian didn\u2019t pay too much attention to him, his mind was occupied with Master Lin. He had never thought that Master Lin would actually be able to find him, let alone use such aggressive tactics.</p><br/><p>He believed that Master Lin hadn\u2019t done anything bad when he had hacked into the bank and the police service. However, this wasn\u2019t a small case. Although he was the Inspector, even the Bureau Chief who was his boss wouldn\u2019t be able to cover for Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>He was done for.</p><br/><p>He buried his head in his hands, not knowing what to do.</p><br/><p>Ding Ding!</p><br/><p>Chief Qin was calling.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow\u2019s everything? Did you manage to find the person that we\u2019re looking for?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe found him, but Chief, I want to make the report that it was Master Lin who found the culprit for us.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? So it really was Master Lin who helped us find the culprit?\u201d Chief Qin said, his voice shaking. He could not believe what he was hearing.</p><br/><p>\u201cMmm, except the method he used to find the suspect is not right. He hacked into the bank and police servers, and now I can suspect that something big might happen. Do you still stand by what you told me just now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chief Qin remained silent on the other end of the phone. He was completely shaken. How was this possible? How did Master Lin manage to pull this off?</p><br/><p>Whatever the case was, what Master Lin had done was illegal.</p><br/><p>Even as the Bureau Chief, he couldn\u2019t shield Master Lin from the repercussions of what he had done.</p><br/><p>\u201cChief, are you still on the phone?\u201d Liu Xiao Tian said, worried.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m still listening. Quickly, report back here. We need to discuss our next move.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan\u2019s fingers were flying across the keyboard. He continued to do what he had been doing.</p><br/><p>Jiangning. In a certain the bank.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot good. Our bank server has been hacked.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Hacked? Are you dreaming? Who has the balls to do that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTake a look for yourself. The database is currently being decrypted by somebody.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a professional. Quick, do something about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t stop him. The hacker is too good. I\u2019ve been kicked from the server.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>In the police station.</p><br/><p>It was the center of justice, and everyone was scrambling around, trying to get things done.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is going on? The database cannot be destroyed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Beads of cold sweat were forming on the head of the Internet professional. \u201cI\u2019m trying to stop him, but the other party didn\u2019t destroy our database, he\u2019s just searching around the database for something.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSearching isn\u2019t allowed either. Find the location of the hacker.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve already found it. The hacker left quite a huge trail and didn\u2019t even bother hiding it. He is at Cloud Street.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn Shanghai?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, but there\u2019s a problem. With this kind of hacker, he definitely wouldn\u2019t expose his actual location. If he did, he would be as good as dead.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think too much. Just make a report and make sure someone goes down to Cloud Street to investigate the case.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>On Weibo.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan continued posting the information of all the scammers he had found.</p><br/><p>\u201cAll these people are scammers. I advise you guys to be wary. Doing bad things isn\u2019t as scary as refusing to admit your mistake. Once I\u2019m done with this, I\u2019ll give myself up to the authorities.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang and the rest all stared at Lin Fan as they read his Weibo post.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Lin, are you trying to defy heaven? What has gotten into you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian was perspiring heavily. \u201cYeah, although you\u2019re not that special, we are still friends. If you go to jail, what would we do without you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Tian He looked at Lin Fan. She couldn\u2019t understand what was going through his mind.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan looked like she was about to cry. \u201cBrother Lin, please don\u2019t be too hard on yourself. What on earth are you writing on your Weibo?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved her away. \u201cLow-profile\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The Weibo sphere was exploding with madness.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck, is this legit? Where did Master Lin get all this information?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre these all personal information of the scammers?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere did he get them from?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, tell the truth. Did you really hack into the bank and police servers? Otherwise, how did you manage to find all this information?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, Master Lin did well by posting all this information of the scammers. But by hacking into the police and bank servers, it may be an even more serious crime.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, isn\u2019t that saying that Master Lin is screwed?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt can\u2019t be.\u201d</p><br/><p>While the netizens were discussing all that on Weibo, Lin Fan was almost done. He had already hacked into the servers of thirty banks.</p><br/><p>The Internet Safety Department started focusing on the situation after receiving a few reports.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is an exceptional hacker on the web right now and he\u2019s aggressively hacking into the bank systems. Our primary job now is to find him and stop him.\u201d</p><br/><p>All the people in the department were computer enthusiasts. They had absolute confidence in their skills. Some of them had even used their skills for illegal means in the past, but after being offered a job at the Internet Safety Department, they had found their true calling and a love for the computer that they never had in the past.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat an aggressive person. With us around, he will never be able to run.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, I actually want to meet that hacker.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCome, let\u2019s get started.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is the trail that the hacker has left behind. Your job is to stop him,\u201d the Head of the Internet Safety Department commanded.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, a group of highly skilled computer wizards got into action.</p><br/><p>\u201cFound him. He\u2019s currently active in one of the banks in Zhongzhou. Let\u2019s stop him immediately.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m coming.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlready at it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFind his whereabouts and stop him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>At Cloud Street, in a shop without any doors, a brand new computer was whirring and processing, due to the huge processing power required.</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang and the rest stood where they were, their eyes fixated on the screen as Lin Fan typed vigorously.</p><br/><p>They were in a daze.</p><br/><p>Shocked!</p><br/><p>Shaken!</p><br/><p>How much was Lin Fan going to do before he stopped?</p><br/><p>\u201cHey!\u201d Lin Fan exclaimed. \u201cD*mn it, these people are too arrogant, all attacking me at once. You guys are unlucky to have met Righteous Fan!\u201d</p><br/><p>With justice as his motivation, Righteous Fan\u2019s abilities didn\u2019t have any limit. It was almost terrifying.</p><br/><p>It was a god killing other gods.</p><br/><p>It doesn\u2019t matter who you are. You will all be overthrown.</p><br/><p>The group of professionals from the Internet Safety Department realized that they were getting screwed by the hacker.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot good, I just got kicked from the server.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMe too. I just saw that guy and got kicked immediately.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho exactly is that brat? How is he that good?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLeader, this b*stard is just too good. We are no match for him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot good. He just entered into our computers and is currently retrieving our information.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Stop him!\u201d the Head of the Cyber Security Department said, his face looking shocked.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t stop him. This guy isn\u2019t human. He just disabled my keyboard.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat kind of ghostly technique is this? Who exactly is this guy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m going crazy! He just opened the \u2018Snake\u2019 game on my computer.\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, the people from the Internet Safety Department were all crying. This was the first time they had met this kind of situation and it was too much to take in.</p><br/><p>\u201cI found where the hacker is from. He is currently at Cloud Street, Shanghai.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood job, Xiao Chen. How did you manage to find him? Looks like your skills have improved tremendously,\u201d the Head of the Cyber Security Department exclaimed. Finally, there was some light at the end of the tunnel.</p><br/><p>Xiao Chen\u2019s face looked like it was about to cry. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t my doing. He provoked me and wrote some things on my screen.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone gathered around his screen, their faces looking on in shock.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou guys are a bunch of unethical hackers! Your skills are rubbish. I\u2019ve already put your personal information on Weibo. Remember, the person who screwed you guys over is Righteous Fan and you can call me Master. I\u2019ll see you guys in prison.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you guys in prison.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck\u2026who is the one illegally hacking all the bank systems\u2026\u201d everyone started going in an uproar.</p><br/><p>The Head of the Department was speechless\u2026</p></div>\n</div>"}

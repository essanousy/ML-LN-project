What a loser Master Lin. What does our school incident have anything to do with you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. Do you think you can do this because you\u2019re a little famous? You\u2019re nothing but child\u2019s play in our eyes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, how righteous. If you\u2019re so righteous, ask the girl to be your wife. Idiot.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSomeone like him actually has a group of hardcore fans. That\u2019s so hilarious. He even said that people from our school are idiots. I think you\u2019re the real idiot.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jin He University had quite a lot of students that were involved in this. They knew who Master Lin was but they were all youngsters. They were fearless and they somehow hated those that were famous.</p><br/><p>The more famous you were, the more you would be flamed when you do something controversial.</p><br/><p>However, they didn\u2019t think about something.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan\u2019s righteous fans didn\u2019t just remain silent. They immediately retaliated.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, these losers came to our territory to cause trouble. Brothers, let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck your moms. These bunch of losers should look at where they are. They must be tired of living.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s destroy them.\u201d</p><br/><p>In an instant, Lin Fan\u2019s Weibo became really chaotic. Of course, those that came to flame got drowned in the comments of his fans.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shook his head, \u201cSigh, why do people have such bad character? When I was in University, I was so different.\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporters were observing the situation online. When they saw Master Lin speaking up about this, they were ecstatic.</p><br/><p>The things that Master Lin was involved in would definitely be nice to watch.</p><br/><p>However, Jin He University didn\u2019t care about that. They had already sent their notice and they had to keep to it. They couldn\u2019t withdraw the expulsion letter because people objected it.</p><br/><p>This matter had too many students\u2019 objection. A lot of University students also said that if she didn\u2019t leave the school, they would leave instead.</p><br/><p>At Jin He University.</p><br/><p>At a random female hostel. A group of fashionable and pretty female students was gathered together and all of them were smiling.</p><br/><p>One of the students looked really happy and she felt great.</p><br/><p>\u201cLook, this matter had been blown up. I don\u2019t believe the fella wouldn\u2019t get out of here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t expect the thing we started for fun had become like this. It has such a great impact.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, she\u2019s so dishonest. We already asked her to join us as a form of respect but she rejected us.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re our big sister indeed. This method is so good. Spreading rumors in our school and sending pictures to scare all the guys. Now that the school can\u2019t take it anymore, they have to expel her.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, Master Lin came out to speak about it on Weibo. He said that what the school did was discriminatory. What do you think?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, he\u2019s an outsider. Whatever comments would be useless. He\u2019s just being a busybody. He probably doesn\u2019t even have a girlfriend.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you think Master Lin is gay?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, that\u2019s possible.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, in another hostel nearby.</p><br/><p>A disfigured lady was sitting there with her head lowered. She was the student that was about to be expelled.</p><br/><p>Jin Shan Ping didn\u2019t know what to do. She knew what was happening in school. She lived alone in the hostel and nobody was willing to stay with her. Even her classmates stayed away from her.</p><br/><p>In class, she sat alone and people ignored her. Even the teachers ignored her. Everyone despised him.</p><br/><p>She was already used to the situation. She had been facing this situation since high school. However, it was a little different then as she had a caring teacher. It made her feel that at least someone in school cared about her.</p><br/><p>However, things were different after coming to University.</p><br/><p>Everyone hid from her.</p><br/><p>Suddenly!</p><br/><p>She heard some noises from outside and she began to tremble in fear.</p><br/><p>\u201cGet out of the school.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJin Shan Ping, please leave and return us our good school.\u201d</p><br/><p>Those that stayed in the hostel opened their windows and looked at what was happening outside.</p><br/><p>A group of people was holding sign boards and shouting towards the female hostel.</p><br/><p>The content on the signboard was \u2018Jin Shan Ping, please leave our school. You\u2019ve scared us.\u2019</p><br/><p>The content was really hurtful.</p><br/><p>Those students that weren\u2019t involved in this felt that these people were too much. However, they couldn\u2019t do anything about it. Besides standing up for her online, they were helpless.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow could they do that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. Although I don\u2019t really want to know her, I don\u2019t feel that she\u2019s repulsive. I think Jin Shan Ping has great character. She often helps to throw away the rubbish at the entrance of our hostel.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSigh, what can we do? I heard she ran into a fire three years ago to save her neighbor\u2019s kid. That\u2019s how she got burnt.\u201d</p><br/><p>The people were chanting non-stop outside.</p><br/><p>\u201cJin Shan Ping, please leave. Return us our beautiful school.\u201d</p><br/><p>Those chants were really loud and a lot of students gathered to watch. Some even started recording it while others also joined in. After all, the spectators didn\u2019t understand the gravity of the situation. When things didn\u2019t happen to them directly, they wouldn\u2019t know how much it hurt.</p><br/><p>A random northeastern girl couldn\u2019t take it anymore. She opened her window and shouted, \u201cYou guys are too much. How could you be so disgusting? I think all of you are polluting the school environment.\u201d</p><br/><p>A girl that stayed with her immediately dragged her back. \u201cDon\u2019t scold them. It\u2019ll get you into trouble.\u201d</p><br/><p>Below the hostel.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you shouting about? If you\u2019re brave, come down and talk to us.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know which hostel you belong to. Girls, let\u2019s go and teach her a lesson,\u201d shouted a girl below the hostel.</p><br/><p>The northeastern girl immediately took out a large sword from her wardrobe that she used for arts performances. She said angrily, \u201cF*cking losers. If you have guts, get up here now. If I don\u2019t slice you open, I would jump down from here.\u201d</p><br/><p>After she said that, a lot of people got cared.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s ignore her and continue shouting.\u201d Some girls were frightened and they didn\u2019t want to mess with her anymore. Their main aim was to drive Jin Shan Ping out.</p><br/><p>The school management had found out about this situation.</p><br/><p>They immediately sent people over.</p><br/><p>They didn\u2019t expect the students to have dared to do such a thing in school. If this were to be reported, people would definitely laugh at them.</p><br/><p>They had already sent her an official request for her to leave the school. After all, they couldn\u2019t have done anything else besides that.</p><br/><p>These students were causing so much trouble. Did they really want to blow this matter up even more?</p></div>\n</div>"}

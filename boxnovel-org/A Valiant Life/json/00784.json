He felt that this person was a busybody.</p><br/><p>So what if he was Master Lin? He couldn\u2019t just interfere with everything and think that everyone had to give him face.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t care about people like him who thought that they could do anything they wanted just because they had some authority.</p><br/><p>He immediately called the customer service department.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf there are such calls in the future, reject them immediately. Do not transfer it to me,\u201d he scolded the person on the phone furiously.</p><br/><p>He had to pick up every single call. He was just doing his job.</p><br/><p>At the construction site.</p><br/><p>Young Zhao had always been confident of his idol. However, he had just heard the call earlier. He didn\u2019t want to make things difficult for his idol. He was already happy that his idol agreed to help him.</p><br/><p>He felt that his idol was someone that was willing to help his fans and not belittle them.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, forget it. We\u2019ll think of something. They might just give us our pay after the New Year.\u201d Young Zhao tried to hint to Lin Fan to stop caring about this matter. Anyway, he was just trying his luck and he wasn\u2019t confident about it.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. It\u2019s just the beginning.\u201d Lin Fan waved his hands. He was furious at how cocky that fella was. He insisted that he was right for not giving the workers their salaries. If he were to leave this matter alone, he wouldn\u2019t have had any reason to remain in the society.</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhou Yang thought about it for a moment, \u201cBrother Lin, what should we do now? This situation is common. Everyone just pushes the blame around. I think this is a little complicated. Perhaps the manufacturing company really transferred the funds. They probably took some of the money. When it came to the construction company, the probably took some of it too. The money keeps decreasing with each transfer. Therefore\u2026 you should understand what I\u2019m saying.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough that might be the case, they have to pay these workers. They earn so much money and the workers are paid with a fixed rate. It\u2019s their hard-earned money. Even if they wanted to take some money, they can\u2019t just take it from these workers.\u201d Lin Fan had his own way of thinking. Although what Zhao Zhong Yang said was reasonable, he couldn\u2019t ignore the other possibilities.</p><br/><p>Then, Lin Fan turned to look at the workers, \u201cLet me ask you this: do you want to take money home for the New Year?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Their biggest dream was to get the money. They were really disappointed in the construction company. If they could, they wanted to just leave and not work there anymore.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright. Let\u2019s go to the Ministry of Manpower,\u201d Lin Fan waved his hands and brought them out.</p><br/><p>At the same time, he took out his phone. Some things had to be utilized when needed.</p><br/><p>On Weibo.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan: \u201cMother Earth Real Estate Pte Ltd is a reputable company. The workers at Chao Hai Road\u2019s construction site told me that they haven\u2019t been paid for the New Year. It is too much. After calling them, the head of the department had such a bad attitude. I can\u2019t tolerate this, especially since one of my fans is involved in this. I have to help them get their money back.\u201d</p><br/><p>After posting that on Weibo, a lot of people started commenting on it.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, this happens every year. I didn\u2019t expect Master Lin to encounter it. I\u2019ll support you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe best way to handle this is to wreck havoc or commit suicide.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, you have to understand their pains too. Sometimes, the real estate companies are really broke.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c^ Are you kidding? So what if they\u2019re broke? They can\u2019t just not pay these workers. That would mean that these workers have worked for nothing. Why didn\u2019t they pay them extra money when they earned big bucks?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. So what if they\u2019re \u2018broke\u2019? If they dare to say that these workers shouldn\u2019t ask for money this year and even ask them to sell their houses for a doubled pay, I\u2019ll admit defeat.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat kind of f*cking houses can they build with \u2018no money\u2019?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s illogical. Mother Earth Real Estate is considered to be a large real estate developer. They are involved in a lot of famous houses. How can they be broke?\u201d</p><br/><p>On Weibo, Lin Fan was considered to be a famous Internet celebrity. A lot of Internet celebrities wanted to befriend Lin Fan and they started to re-post his post.</p><br/><p>Some of the celebrities just did it because of another favor. Initially, this didn\u2019t involve them at all. However, Master Lin wrecked Ying Jin and they were really grateful for that. Hence, they naturally re-posted the post to blow it up.</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang had been observing Weibo and the post had reached 130,000 re-posts in a short period of time. Furthermore, a lot of famous Internet celebrities re-posted it. That was pretty scary.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Lin, are you trying to blow this matter up?\u201d Zhao Zhong Yang asked.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replies, \u201cI just want to blow things up. Although it may not be Mother Earth Real Estate\u2019s fault, they\u2019re the real estate developers. If they don\u2019t manage it properly, they have to be responsible for it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ding ding!</p><br/><p>Then, Lin Fan\u2019s phone rang.</p><br/><p>The reporter said, \u201cMaster Lin, where are you guys heading to?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replies, \u201cWe\u2019re heading to the Ministry of Manpower.\u201d</p><br/><p>After hanging up, another phone call came.</p><br/><p>All the calls were from reporters. When they saw the content posted on Weibo, they immediately contacted Master Lin as they knew that it was going to blow up.</p><br/><p>Initially, they felt that this matter was just a minor one. However, Master Lin was involved in it. He was the creator of a lot of breaking news and they felt that this was going to be something epic.</p><br/><p>At that moment, all the reporters from the major companies in Beijing rushed towards the Ministry of Manpower. They wanted to get the latest news as soon as possible.</p><br/><p>At a certain newly constructed commercial property of Mother Earth Real Estate Corporation.</p><br/><p>Several people were looking at houses.</p><br/><p>The salesmen were really busy. Their commercial properties were extremely popular. When they started selling the houses, they had to serve a lot of customers every day.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have this then,\u201d said one of the townsfolk who picked a house. Then, he looked at his son, \u201cI bought this for your wedding. You have to get married in six months.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDad, don\u2019t worry. Since there\u2019s a house, I\u2019ll definitely get married.\u201d</p><br/><p>The salesman felt really good. It looked like he was going to clinch another deal.</p><br/><p>However, something shocking could be heard.</p><br/><p>\u201cLook at Weibo. Master Lin posted something about Mother Earth Real Estate Corporation refusing to pay their workers. Now, he\u2019s brought the workers to demand for their salaries.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat can\u2019t be. How can Mother Earth Real Estate be so incorrigible? The New Year is almost here and they\u2019re refusing to pay at this moment?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey have such bad character.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not buying any more. What is this? Master Lin is my idol. If I were to buy a house here, wouldn\u2019t I be smacking Master Lin\u2019s face?\u201d</p><br/><p>The salesman was stunned. Then, he tried to salvage the situation, \u201cEveryone, our houses here are the best. They\u2019ve almost sold out. If you don\u2019t buy it today, you might not be able to get it in the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo what if they\u2019re the best? I can get a house anywhere with money. I\u2019m not going to trust your company with such poor attitude.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not buying any more. I didn\u2019t expect something like this to happen. In the past, I have always seen news about companies refusing to pay their workers. I didn\u2019t expect Mother Earth Real Estate to do such a thing. How disappointing.\u201d</p><br/><p>The manager of the sales team rushed over to try to salvage the situation after hearing about it.</p><br/><p>Initially, those townsfolk that were interested in buying houses. Now, they were beginning to lose their interest.</p><br/><p>They felt that the company couldn\u2019t have been that good for refusing to pay their workers. If they were to buy a house and something were to happen to their district management, they might not be able to resolve it in time.</p><br/><p>The manager started to become anxious after seeing numerous townsfolk leaving.</p><br/><p>Even until now, he didn\u2019t know what had happened.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

It had a great difference from last year\u2019s artworks.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, look at this artwork here,\u201d one of the judges waved. \u201cThis artwork is really meaningful. For a kid that is below fourteen years old to draw this, that is unbelievable. Three years ago, the top prize isn\u2019t even as good as this.\u201d</p><br/><p>The other judges walked over and said, \u201cElder Zhang, you must be exaggerating. Which drawing could be that good?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Qian Shan said, \u201cCome and have a look.\u201d</p><br/><p>The others walked over and when they saw the artwork, they were stunned. To them, the artwork was average. However, it was drawn by a kid that was below fourteen years old. Those kids couldn\u2019t have matched up to them, who were professionally trained.</p><br/><p>A bespectacled and plump middle-aged man looked at it and said, \u201cThe strokes are a little soft and the details aren\u2019t too precise. However, the overall shape is good and there is a good feel to it. Look at the mountains and the rivers. They\u2019ve been handled well. I feel an aura from this drawing and it is exceptional.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Qian Shan said, \u201cYou can tell too, right? I dare to confirm that this will be the best artwork for this competition. The other artworks are nothing compared to this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? The kid that drew this is only six years old. How could that be?\u201d the judge asked after looking at the age of the artists. He was dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>The crowd was stunned when they heard that and they quickly rushed over.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid they make a mistake? How could a six-year-old child draw this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA genius, he is definitely a genius.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Qian Shan was stunned. \u201cIf he was a 14-year-old teenager, I wouldn\u2019t have been as stunned. However, this six-year-old boy actually drew this. How could that be? Right, look at the weak strokes again. If he is able to improve on that and have firmer strokes, it would definitely be much better.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s impressive. This year\u2019s Youth Chinese Arts Cup has a lot of hidden talents. It is really different from the past few years of competition.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, this is the last one to be shortlisted. How many managed to make it?</p><br/><p>The worker was carrying a huge pile of artworks and his forehead was filled with sweat. He replied, \u201cThere are a total of 380 pieces.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Qian Shan was stunned, \u201cWhat? So many of them?\u201d</p><br/><p>He was really stunned. He didn\u2019t really notice how many pieces he chose earlier. After all, these artworks were really impressive. If they were to be in the past competitions, they would have won second or third place.</p><br/><p>After hearing what the worker said, 380 pieces of artwork seemed too many.</p><br/><p>The judges looked at each other, \u201cShall we look at them again? There\u2019s too many. We planned to only have about 20 shortlisted ones.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Qian Shan nodded, \u201cAlright, let\u2019s see again. Perhaps we were a little too lenient just now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, the workers placed the artworks one by one again. Those that weren\u2019t shortlisted were removed from the tables.</p><br/><p>Judging was a dry and dreary work but the judges were professional about it. They were invigorated when they saw how impressive the artworks were and that they were drawn by the younger generation.</p><br/><p>They looked at the artworks and they were really decent. It was a headache for them.</p><br/><p>\u201cThese artworks are at least worthy of a consolation prize. How should we shortlist them further?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s choose the worst pieces among these ones. We have to decrease the numbers.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI guess that\u2019s the only way.\u201d</p><br/><p>An hour later.</p><br/><p>Zhang Qian Shan looked at them and asked, \u201cHow was it? Did you guys choose any?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI chose 10 pieces to be eliminated.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo few? That\u2019s not enough.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t choose anymore. These kids really drew very well. Besides this artwork here, the others have reached a pretty uniform standard. If you were to eliminate this, what about the others? It is unfair to them. Furthermore, I noticed that the youngest artist here is five years old and the oldest one is fourteen years old. How should we pick? If we were to develop them, they\u2019d be gifted artists next time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat can\u2019t be.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean? Look at them. They\u2019re all here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone was stunned. They were vexing over which artworks to eliminate but they didn\u2019t notice how young the artists were. When they heard that the youngest artist was five years old and that the oldest was fourteen years old, they were stunned speechless.</p><br/><p>They believed that they didn\u2019t even know what Chinese Arts was about when they were five. They were probably still playing with mud.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, they dared to guarantee that even if they learned Chinese Arts for two or three years, they wouldn\u2019t have reached this standard.</p><br/><p>However, the good thing was that five of the 370 artists were 14 years old. That was a relief for them.</p><br/><p>\u201cForget it. Leave it this way then. Send these 370 artworks back. Let them vex over which ones to choose. We have done our best.\u201d</p><br/><p>Some of them shook their heads, \u201cSigh, it\u2019s the first time we\u2019ve encountered this.\u201d</p><br/><p>The next day!</p><br/><p>Lin Fan went to Cloud Street early in the morning.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian asked, \u201cWhen will the competition results come out?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cI think they\u2019ll need some time. The website said that they need six days. Hey, why do you care so much about this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian smiled, \u201cI\u2019m just asking.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan didn\u2019t know how difficult it was for the judges yesterday. Their two-hour job stretched all the way till nighttime.</p><br/><p>This time, the \u2018Youth Chinese Arts Cup\u2019 was a nationwide event and it was only held in large cities. The typical county towns wouldn\u2019t have it.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, although Chinese Arts was a national treasure, it was in an awkward position. Parents these days sent their kids to learn different things, they\u2019d usually learn dance, piano, guzheng, etc. Although there were people that learned Chinese Arts, it was pretty dry for them to learn it. Only a handful of them persevered in learning it.</p><br/><p>Then, Wu You Lan came to Lin Fan, \u201cBrother Lin, did you forget about what you promised me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was stunned, \u201cWhat was it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan pouted to express her sadness, \u201cI knew you forgot about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha,\u201d Lin Fan smiled. \u201cAlright, alright. I\u2019ll forget anything but my agreement with you. Tell me where you want to go then.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan smiled, \u201cI knew that Brother Lin wouldn\u2019t forget about it. I booked the tickets online. Tuan Tuan, the giant panda, has arrived at the zoo. Let\u2019s go and have a look, shall we?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cZoo? Okay, let\u2019s go to the zoo then. When shall we go?\u201d Lin Fan asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cTomorrow. I booked tickets for tomorrow,\u201d Wu You Lan said.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, let\u2019s be punctual for it then.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p></div>\n</div>"}

The accommodations for all his relatives had been settled so he could finally afford to relax.</p><br/><p>\u201cDear, can you see if this set of clothes is suitable or not?\u201d</p><br/><p>While Lin Fan was still lying down on the sofa, his father had put on a new set of clothes for his mother to critique.</p><br/><p>His mother was in the kitchen preparing some things so she was a little impatient as she replied, \u201cYou changed your clothes again? You\u2019ve changed your clothes so many times, are you getting ready for a pageant or something?\u201d</p><br/><p>His father laughed and replied, \u201cI said that I invited all of my classmates, didn\u2019t I? Initially, when I sent the message to the group, I did not think that any of them would come. However, unexpectedly, Elder Ting was the first to say that he was coming and then, right after that, all my other classmates rushed to join in as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Ting? Is that that super-rich classmate of yours? To me, your classmates are only coming because of Elder Ting. I mean, how long have you guys not spoke to each other? I don\u2019t even know how you were added into that group. In a whole year, the group of you only say a few sentences to each other and now, all of a sudden, they want to come to your birthday party?\u201d Lin Fan\u2019s mother said. She was awfully blunt and honest about how she felt about his father\u2019s classmates, not giving him any face at all.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan continued to lie there and keenly listened to what they were saying. His mother was truly not giving his father any face at all. However, regardless, he really enjoyed these sort of days.</p><br/><p>As for his future, he also did not want to live such a troublesome life. He wanted to just be comfortable and relax at home and, every once in a while, just go out and enjoy the sceneries. He was simply uninterested in all these fame and fortunes and felt that living such a tiring life was meaningless.</p><br/><p>To just wake up every day, have a bowl of porridge and then be with his family. That sort of lifestyle was already perfect. It was a greater blessing than any other sort of luxuries.</p><br/><p>His father retorted, \u201cYou are truly clueless. This is just a case of people growing to an old age and wanting to come together to reminisce about their glory days. With my birthday this time around, I want to bring everyone to gather together. It\u2019s nothing like what you said.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo what if he has money? He\u2019s still a normal person. It doesn\u2019t make him a god. Also, I haven\u2019t even told them about how famous my son is, right, son?\u201d his father glanced at Lin Fan as he asked.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled, grabbed the apple on the coffee table and took a bite out of it. Then, he said, \u201cThat\u2019s right. Dad\u2019s logic is right. Even though he may be rich, he\u2019s still human. He will still fall sick and he will still die of old age, so what makes him so special? In my eyes, it is because dad is so charming and charismatic that his classmates all want to come.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMum, where did you buy this apple from? It\u2019s so crunchy,\u201d Lin Fan asked.</p><br/><p>His mother laughed and said, \u201cIt was that Ming Yang kid who sent someone over to deliver them to us.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh yes, why is that Ming Yang kid not coming?\u201d</p><br/><p>His father replied, \u201cWhy do you want him to come? If you tell him about this, then even if he\u2019s busy, he would feel bad rejecting us and will still come. Wouldn\u2019t that be interfering with his matters?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan also felt a little uneasy inside. The fact that he had not invited Wang Ming Yang was wrong. However, he was afraid that if this guy really were to come, that he would cause some trouble. After all, Lin Fan knew about how playful Wang Ming Yang could be.</p><br/><p>\u201cMum, let\u2019s just have a dinner together as one entire family. The main point of the meal will be to receive dad\u2019s classmates and our relatives so that it won\u2019t be so troublesome during the party,\u201d Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>His mum thought about it for a moment and replied, \u201cThat sounds good. I\u2019m just afraid that if that Ming Yang kid finds out that we did not invite him, he would be extremely disappointed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed and said, \u201cYou\u2019re still as thoughtful as ever. However, you can relax. He definitely won\u2019t be angry. He has a very good attitude.\u201d</p><br/><p>*Ding Ding*</p><br/><p>At that moment, his father\u2019s phone rang.</p><br/><p>\u201cHello? Elder Chen, you and Elder Zhang have reached already?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, okay. I\u2019m coming over now to pick you guys up. Wait for me.\u201d</p><br/><p>After hanging up the phone, his father\u2019s mood was pretty good as he said, \u201cI\u2019m going out first. Two of my classmates have arrived so I have to go and receive them. Son, where\u2019s the room key?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan pointed at the coffee table and said, \u201cIt\u2019s over there, take all of them. I\u2019m going to leave all your classmates for you to handle now. I\u2019m too tired to move now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay. Seems like I\u2019ve tired you out already,\u201d his father said as he grabbed all the room keys and headed out. Judging by the look on his face, he was in a really jolly mood.</p><br/><p>\u201cMum, I\u2019m going to take a nap,\u201d Lin Fan uttered as he looked towards the kitchen. Then, he returned to his room. He fell asleep quickly after lying down, knowing that tomorrow was going to be a very busy day.</p><br/><p>A certain production team.</p><br/><p>A big show was currently in the midst of being shot.</p><br/><p>After Wu Huan Yue had finished shooting a scene, she walked towards the director and then apologetically said, \u201cDirector, I\u2019m sorry to disturb but I wish to take leave tomorrow.\u201d</p><br/><p>The director was looking through the camera lens when he suddenly heard someone requesting a leave. Upon hearing that, his brows furrowed. However, when he saw who the person who was requesting the leave was, his brows furrowed even more.</p><br/><p>Then, without even asking for the reason\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cHuan Yue, when you\u2019re working, you have to have the correct attitude, right? Right now, our show has a huge amount of investments and is not easy to shoot. You are one of the lead actors so if you were to take a leave, the entire shoot would have to pause and wait for you. You see, if there is nothing important, you can just persevere a little longer and wait for the shoot to finish. Then, you\u2019ll have a lot of time to rest,\u201d the director said.</p><br/><p>He was very satisfied with Wu Huan Yue\u2019s work but taking a leave was something that was not possible and something that he objected against.</p><br/><p>However, after thinking about it, Wu Huan Yue right now was a prosperous and famous star. Her acting and singing career had developed without a hitch. Thus, she did have that privilege to request a leave once in a while.</p><br/><p>The only thing was that it was really not possible this time. They were on a very tight schedule and could not possibly let her take a leave.</p><br/><p>Some of the surrounding stars envied her and looked at Wu Huan Yue with hatred. They knew that Wu Huan Yue had had a smooth path of development for her career and had not encountered any difficulties at all.</p><br/><p>They were nothing like her. From the moment they started on this journey, there had been all sorts of obstacles. At times, when they were working with a huge star, they had to make all sorts of accommodations for the star.</p><br/><p>Even with this show, for them to assist the director and the movie makers was not easy.</p><br/><p>In the end, they found out that it was Master Lin who stuck out a leg for her.</p><br/><p>This sort of thing was not a secret within their circle. They knew that Wu Huan Yue had a very good relationship with Master Lin. However, there was nothing that they could do about it. She was just that lucky to be able to be close to Master Lin.</p><br/><p>Right now, there were very few people in the entire entertainment industry who dared to pi*s off Master Lin. And as for those who did dare to piss him off, it would not end well for them.</p><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue said, \u201cDirector, I really need to take a leave this time. It\u2019s Master Lin\u2019s father\u2019s 50th birthday. I need to be there.\u201d</p><br/><p>The director initially had not wanted to say anything, however, he was suddenly stunned and said, \u201cMaster Lin\u2019s father\u2019s 50th birthday?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue nodded and said, \u201cYeah, it is.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, the director slapped his leg and said, \u201cOh my, Huan Yue, why didn\u2019t you say earlier? If you told me that, then how could I possibly reject your request? This is such a huge thing. Master Lin\u2019s father\u2019s 50th birthday? You have to go. Okay, I\u2019ll approve your leave. You don\u2019t have to worry about anything else, you just have to come back to work the following day. Tomorrow, I\u2019ll just shoot a different scene. Nothing will be affected.\u201d</p><br/><p>The surrounding actors heard this and they were stunned. It had really been such a quick change of heart.</p><br/><p>Initially, he had been so set on rejecting it but then he suddenly agreed.</p><br/><p>Wu Huan Yue replied, \u201cThank you, Director. I\u2019ll make a move first then.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGo, go. I\u2019ll get the chauffeur to send you there,\u201d the director said. Then, he rushed to call the chauffeur over and asked him to send Wu Huan Yue off the set.</p><br/><p>Then, after Wu Huan Yue left, one of the actors was very unhappy and said, \u201cDirector, this Wu Huan Yue is really unprofessional.\u201d</p><br/><p>The director glared at him and said, \u201cWho are you to say that? Master Lin\u2019s father\u2019s 50th birthday is a huge thing and she has to go. If Master Lin invited me, I would go as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone was left speechless and had nothing to say.</p></div>\n</div>"}

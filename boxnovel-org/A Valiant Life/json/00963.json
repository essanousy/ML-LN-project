Some of the surrounding shop owners didn\u2019t even open their shops. They had prepared some melon seeds to nibble on as they watched the broadcast.</p><br/><p>Elder Liang said, \u201cLittle Boss, will you cause a problem by doing this? If you really are awarded the prize but you\u2019re not there, what would you do?\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Chen was nibbling on the melon seeds as he agreed with Elder Liang, \u201cYeah, Elder Liang makes sense. If Little Boss is awarded the prize but Little Boss is not there, people will definitely scold you for being disrespectful.\u201d</p><br/><p>The other shop owners nodded as well as they felt that it was true. It indeed made sense.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the shop owners sitting in the shop and was getting a bit of a headache. At the same time, he started to doubt himself. <em>Could it really be as they say and I\u2019ll really get the award?</em></p><br/><p><em>But that shouldn\u2019t happen. I have to trust myself. My prediction definitely won\u2019t be wrong.</em></p><div class=\"code-block code-block-2\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p><em>Right, it must be right.</em></p><br/><p><em>I have to have faith. I definitely won\u2019t get the award.</em></p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I won\u2019t get the award,\u201d said Lin Fan calmly. This time, he had even saved on the airplane fees. He definitely had to be calm.</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang said, \u201cBrother Lin, if you really get it, what would you do?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved his hand. \u201cThat\u2019s not possible.\u201d</p><br/><p>The shop owners laughed. \u201cEveryone, let\u2019s stop debating. The broadcast has started. We\u2019ll find out whether Little Boss will get the award soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, the shop owners weren\u2019t the only ones waiting in anticipation. All the netizens in the country were eagerly waiting as well.</p><br/><p>Everyone knew that this award was very prestigious. However, it usually didn\u2019t draw much attention because there wasn\u2019t much entertainment value.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-3\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>But this time was different because Master Lin had been nominated. Hence, many netizens had their attention drawn to it.</p><br/><p>Numerous celebrities had expressed their thoughts on Weibo about this incident. Lin Fan felt that any celebrity with a brain wouldn\u2019t dare to flame him.</p><br/><p>Since being nominated for this Nobel Prize, he had received many words of congratulations. But they didn\u2019t know what the end result would be.</p><br/><p>The Nobel Prize Award Ceremony.</p><br/><p>Sitting on the stage were the current generation\u2019s top scientists from all over the world. Every one of them revered the Nobel Prize greatly.</p><br/><p>Because this was a sort of recognition towards themselves and, more importantly, towards the results of their research.</p><br/><p>A few of the nominees for this award were very famous. However, no one would know the final result until the last moment.</p><br/><p>As for whether there were any shady deals involved, there were not.</p><br/><p>Because the votes weren\u2019t decided by a single country.</p><br/><p>Moreover, this was an award given to the best scientists in the world. If there was a shady deal involved, that would be a disgrace to itself.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-4\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>On-site. The music started to play.</p><br/><p>The King of Sweden Carl XVI Gustaf, the Queen, and the Princess entered the place. And with their entrance, a passionate applause sounded out.</p><br/><p>Then, everyone waited in silence.</p><br/><p>To them, the most important moment was about to come.</p><br/><p>Some scientists were discussing quietly. They weren\u2019t discussing who would receive the award but they were discussing some of the problems they had encountered in their research.</p><br/><p>It was not easy for them to be able to meet. After all, they were all top scientists in the world. To others, their words might have been too complicated to understand but to them, the problems they raised might eventually have a great impact on the world.</p><br/><p>The Nobel Foundation Chairman went on stage to make a speech. He was already used to such a setting. He even felt that this was a most glorious moment.</p><br/><p>After the speech ended, the representative for the judging committee of each award went on stage.</p><br/><p>The first was an elderly white man who was dressed in a suit. He was in high spirits as he opened his mouth and said, \u201cThe Nobel Prize in Physics goes to\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRainer Weiss, Kip, Barish. Let us give a warm round of applause and invite them on stage to take their seats.\u201d</p><br/><p>The three scientists who were sitting below were all emotional and excited as they heard this. To them, this was simply inconceivable. They knew that the things that they had discovered were amazing but they had never thought that they would attain something as prestigious as the Nobel Prize.</p><br/><p>For them to have received it, they were exhilarated.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-5\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>The other nominated scientists who didn\u2019t receive it felt that it was a shame. However, they didn\u2019t show much of a reaction.</p><br/><p>The member of the judging committee went on to introduce each recipient\u2019s background and research findings.</p><br/><p>The netizens had no idea what the heck he was saying. They couldn\u2019t understand at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck. When will the medicine award be presented?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been waiting so long that I can\u2019t take it anymore. I just want to see Master Lin get the award.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStop dreaming. Master Lin didn\u2019t even go. And he even took a selfie.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn. Does Master Lin really think he won\u2019t get the award?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care. I\u2019m waiting for the medicine award to be presented. If Master Lin really doesn\u2019t receive it, I\u2019ll have to see what kind of discoveries the recipients have made to be able to suppress our Master Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>The physics award presentation ended!</p><br/><p>The chemistry award presentation ended!</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-6\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>The literature award presentation ended!</p><br/><p>At the last moment, the netizens all held their breaths.</p><br/><p>The Japanese netizens were watching as well. A scientist from their country had been nominated as well but they didn\u2019t know if he would receive the award.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, in China, even more netizens were waiting in anticipation.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s time for the medicine award. I\u2019m feeling nervous as f*ck. It feels as if I\u2019m waiting to see if I\u2019ll receive the award.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGods, I\u2019m willing to sacrifice the lives of those idiots above me to ensure that Master Lin receives the award.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe has to receive the award and become the first person in our country to do so.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cloud Street!</p><br/><p>The shop owners were gasping in shock, \u201cLittle Boss, it\u2019s coming. It\u2019s coming.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the excited crowd and sighed. <em>Is there a need to be so excited?</em></p><div class=\"code-block code-block-7\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>He really felt that there was no hope of getting the award.</p><br/><p>Because his fortune-telling was very valiant. If he predicted that he wouldn\u2019t get it, then he wouldn\u2019t get it.</p><br/><p>At the same time, the reporters were awaiting the results.</p><br/><p>Once the results were out, they would immediately write a news article. For this kind of news, they had to be the first to report it.</p><br/><p>This was for the glory of the country.</p><br/><p>But they felt that Master Lin would be able to get the award. After all, the development of the leukemia prescription was a truly outstanding feat.</p><br/><p>But Master Lin had said that he wouldn\u2019t get it. They understood the reason behind that as well.</p><br/><p>Because the treatment method was using Chinese medicine.</p><br/><p>If the decision had been made by votes, it would really be very difficult for the effectiveness of this treatment to be recognized.</p><br/><p>Also, according to their speculation, Master Lin\u2019s leukemia prescription had only been developed for a short period of time. There hadn\u2019t been enough time to validate it and understand it.</p><br/><p>Hence, they were feeling pessimistic about the final result.</p><br/><p>If the award was given out a few months later, perhaps there might be a higher chance.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-8\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>As for now\u2026</p><br/><p>They were very unsure about it.</p><br/><p>But Master Lin was still Master Lin after all. They still believed that a miracle might happen.</p></div>\n</div>"}

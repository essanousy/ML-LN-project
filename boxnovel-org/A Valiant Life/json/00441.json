Wu Yun Gang held a rather high status in Beijing. After all, he was a famous entrepreneur. However, he really couldn\u2019t go up against people like Jin Sheng Wen who were influential among triads too.</p><br/><p>Wu Yun Gang was an entrepreneur that did legitimate businesses and everything was done according to rules and procedures. However, he couldn\u2019t afford to offend someone like Jin Sheng Wen because it would bring a lot of trouble to him.</p><br/><p>Jin Sheng Wen had a lot of tricks up his sleeve and Wu Yun Gang couldn\u2019t match up to him.</p><br/><p>Jin Sheng Wen looked the person in front of him and found him to be vaguely familiar but he couldn\u2019t think of who he was. \u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI am Wu Yun Gang, we\u2019ve met before.\u201d Wu Yun Gang introduced himself and he hoped that it would be useful in influencing his thoughts.</p><br/><p>Jin Sheng Wen just said \u2018Oh\u2019 and wasn\u2019t even bothered by Wu Yun Gang. He asked, \u201cWhy are you here?\u201d</p><br/><p>He wasn\u2019t blind and he knew that this matter had something to do with this person. Then, he turned his head and frowned. \u201cDid you cause this problem?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Yun Gang remained silent and then he said, \u201cBrother Wen, it is a misunderstanding. Young Master Jiang and the others made my friend drink a lot of alcohol and there was some conflict. I hope Brother Wen can give us some face and I will settle this matter.\u201d</p><br/><p>If Jin Sheng Wen were to resolve this issue, things might become more complicated. It wouldn\u2019t be that easy to resolve anymore and something major would definitely happen.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha,\u201d Jin Sheng Wen sneered. Then, he pointed forward. \u201cListen to that. You\u2019re telling me it\u2019s a misunderstanding? You must think that I\u2019m deaf.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Yun Gang was a little embarrassed. Master Lin was reprimanding Young Master Jiang and the commotion was extremely loud. Everyone outside could hear what was happening inside.</p><br/><p>Young Master Jiang was crying really loudly and it sounded miserable.</p><br/><p>Sister Yan said, \u201cBrother-in-law, they\u2019re the same group of people. Quick, get Young Master Jiang out of there. If something happens, it\u2019d be difficult for us to answer.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jin Sheng Wen nodded and agreed with what she said. If something were to happen, it\u2019d be difficult for them to answer to Young Master Jiang\u2019s father who had helped him a lot. If something were to happen to his son in Jin Sheng Wen\u2019s territory, it wouldn\u2019t make a difference even if the matter didn\u2019t have anything to do with him.</p><br/><p>\u201cStand there and don\u2019t move.\u201d Jin Sheng Wen pushed Wu Yun Gang aside and went straight into the private room.</p><br/><p>Wu Yun Gang was caught off guard and he nearly fell to the ground.</p><br/><p>He was only a businessman and he knew what kind of person Jin Sheng Wen was. He played a lot of dirty tricks but managed to build an empire from a hair salon. Now, he was capable of managing different clubhouses and hotels. His net worth could be matched up to that of Wang Ming Yang.</p><br/><p>He had connections with people around the world and he was considered to be someone influential in Beijing. At the same time, Jin Sheng Wen held Tian Yun Villa in high regard. He usually used this place to discuss extremely expensive business deals. Furthermore, a typical person couldn\u2019t possibly enter this place. Only those who were truly influential could become a guest here.</p><br/><p>Young Master Zhao and the others were infuriated. \u201cBrother Wen, you have to help us. We were bullied by this rough man in your villa. If this spreads to the public, people would laugh at us and even you would become a joke.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jin Sheng Wen couldn\u2019t be bothered by them but he nodded and replied, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. If something happens here at my Tian Yun Villa, it will be my problem. I will give you guys a satisfactory outcome.\u201d</p><br/><p>Young Master Zhao and the others heaved a sigh of relief. As long as Jin Sheng Wen handled it, everything could be resolved. The person at the door couldn\u2019t possibly match up to Jin Sheng Wen.</p><br/><p>Jin Sheng Wen could call anyone with a simple call and he could crush this man easily.</p><br/><p>At the entrance.</p><br/><p>\u201cMove aside,\u201d Jin Sheng Wen said sternly. He didn\u2019t even respect Lil\u2019 Wang at all. To him, this matter had to be resolved perfectly. At the same time, he wondered who had the guts to cause trouble in his territory.</p><br/><p>Lil\u2019 Wang stood there firmly and looked at Jin Sheng Wen without any expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cJin Sheng Wen, save me!\u201d Young Master Jiang shouted from the private room.</p><br/><p>Young Master Jiang was about to die. He felt that this fella was a maniac for treating him like that.</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung Master Jiang, wait for me,\u201d Jin Sheng Wen said. Then, he looked at Lil\u2019 Wang. \u201cI\u2019ll only give you three seconds to consider. You should seize the opportunity while you can.\u201d</p><br/><p>In the private room.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan started pouring even more alcohol into Young Master Jiang\u2019s mouth when he saw that Young Master Jiang was calling for help. He wasn\u2019t bothered by what was happening outside. If Young Master Jiang could still stand firmly at the end of the day, he\u2019d concede.</p><br/><p><em>Gag</em></p><br/><p>Young Master Jiang was like a dying dog. His abdomen was contracting intensely and he was vomiting everything that he had eaten that day.</p><br/><p>The private room was in a mess and there was alcohol everywhere.</p><br/><p>Young Master Jiang was about to go mad. \u201cJin Sheng Wen, what are you doing? Get in here now! Do you want me to die?\u201d</p><br/><p>Outside the entrance.</p><br/><p>Jin Sheng Wen frowned and he was enraged. Then, he looked at Lil\u2019 Wang who was standing at the entrance. \u201cAlright, since you don\u2019t want to seize the opportunity, don\u2019t regret this.\u201d</p><br/><p>He made a gesture with his fingers and those tall and muscular men started to move towards Lil\u2019 Wang.</p><br/><p>Lil\u2019 Wang wasn\u2019t nervous at all. Elder Zheng had instructed that he could reveal his identity if needed.</p><br/><p>Jin Sheng Wen\u2019s fighters weren\u2019t simple. Although Lil\u2019 Wang could probably defeat all of them, it was difficult to say if he would be okay at the end of the day. He felt that there was a need to reveal his identity.</p><br/><p>\u201cLook at this carefully.\u201d Then, Lil\u2019 Wang took out a small red book from his pocket and flashed it in front of Jin Sheng Wen.</p><br/><p>Initially, Jin Sheng Wen wasn\u2019t bothered by it but when he looked at it closely, his heart trembled in fear. He was flabbergasted by what he saw.</p><br/><p>Others might not have recognized what it was but it was impossible for him not to recognize it.</p><br/><p>He remained silent for a moment and the situation slowly quietened down.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you see it?\u201d Lil\u2019 Wang said proudly.</p><br/><p>Jin Sheng Wen trembled. \u201cThis\u2026 This\u2026\u201d He was in disbelief. Then, he raised his head and looked at Lil\u2019 Wang. It was as if he was trying to tell if Lil\u2019 Wang was lying. He didn\u2019t know if it was real but he already believed it in his heart. It was indeed real.</p><br/><p>\u201cI asked if you understood what it means. Have you become a mute?\u201d Lil\u2019 Wang shouted sternly. He knew that Elder Zheng could back him up. He had been through a lot of challenges before he qualified to become Elder Zheng\u2019s personal bodyguard.</p><br/><p>Jin Sheng Wen\u2019s throat seemed a little dry. He stood there in shock. \u201cI understand now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSince you\u2019ve understood it, what are you trying to do? Stand aside. Do you want to be a part of this? Aren\u2019t you afraid of Tian Yun Villa closing down tonight and vanishing from Beijing?\u201d Lil\u2019 Wang said confidently.</p><br/><p>Even if Jin Sheng Wen was extraordinary, he was stunned.</p><br/><p>If everything was true, then the other party must be a powerful individual.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

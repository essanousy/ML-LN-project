That happened too quickly</h1>\n<div class=\"chr-c\" id=\"chr-content\" style=\"font-family: Minion, serif, serif; font-size: 18px; line-height: 160%;\">\n<div class=\"cha-words\"><br/><p>\u201cThe wavy waves\u2026\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-1\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>He drove and sang happily.</p><br/><p>The matter had been settled really beautifully.</p><br/><p>He really admired himself. The joy of helping others and saving them from the verge of hopelessness felt really great.</p><br/><p>Ding ding!</p><br/><p>Then, his phone rang.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was happy with the notification. \u201cKe, why did you think of calling me?\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-2\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>He obviously knew what his classmate called him for.</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung Fan, do you know something that I don\u2019t?\u201d Bai Ke asked weirdly.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan wanted to tease him and pretended that he didn\u2019t know. \u201cKnow what? Is your wife pregnant? Congratulations!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, can you stop acting? Did you help me resolve my shop\u2019s problems?\u201d Bai Ke was a little stunned. Xu Fei Yuan belittled him right from the start but he suddenly changed his attitude. It was as if he had eaten something wrong. He returned the patent rights for the dishes to Bai Ke and paid him a sum of money. Also, he published an official apology note on the newspapers in Zhong Zhou.\u201d</p><br/><p>He felt that the fella was crazy. However, he thought that it was wrong because even if he was sick, he wouldn\u2019t be that crazy.</p><br/><p>Therefore, he only thought of one possibility. He knew that Young Fan was the one who helped him.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan chuckled, \u201cKe, why did you hide it from me? You were in trouble and you didn\u2019t tell me. What is it? Are you really afraid of me finding out?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Ke finally understood what happened. In embarrassment, he said, \u201cI couldn\u2019t have said it. You taught me how to make those dishes. I was so stupid that I didn\u2019t know that I got scammed. If I were to tell you that, it would cause trouble for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, if you encounter something like this again, you have to tell me. We\u2019re from the same village and we were classmates. If you were to act like that again I would ignore you next time,\u201d Lin Fan chuckled. He knew Bai Ke\u2019s character. He was someone that didn\u2019t like to cause trouble for others.</p><br/><p>Although he didn\u2019t really care about the two dishes, it wasn\u2019t something that the others could take ownership of. Furthermore, he still scammed his friend. If people were to find out that Master Lin\u2019s friend got scammed and he didn\u2019t do anything about it, he wouldn\u2019t be able to hide his face.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-3\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Bai Ke replied, \u201cAlright. If I were to encounter this, I will tell you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled, \u201cThat\u2019s more like it. Look at how awesome I am. I can resolve anything. If you don\u2019t look for me, who else would you look for? Am I right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Ke felt like hanging up. He didn\u2019t want to talk to this idiot who pretended to be awesome.</p><br/><p>However, he was really touched. The difference in status between Lin Fan and him was huge. However, Lin Fan still after the same as before. He didn\u2019t change at all.</p><br/><p>After knowing his identity, he felt a little inferior. However, that feeling vanished.</p><br/><p>It was because he was an old friend that he had known for a long time.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t talk to you anymore. I really can\u2019t. Also, can you please send me your bank account details? That fella paid me $5 million. I don\u2019t want his money. I can send it to you,\u201d Bai Ke said.</p><br/><p>$5 million was a lot of money to him and he was frightened by the amount.</p><br/><p>\u201c$5 million? D*mn, he only compensated you $5 million. Does he think that you\u2019re a pushover?\u201d Lin Fan was a little angry. He tried to resolve the case with just $5 million. Did he think that he was a beggar? It wasn\u2019t even enough to compensate for his trauma.</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung Fan, I\u2019m begging you. Don\u2019t be like that. Do you want to send me flowers early? Don\u2019t scare me anymore. My heart can\u2019t take it anymore.\u201d Bai Ke was scared speechless. Why was it so difficult to communicate with him?</p><br/><p>The $5 million has already stunned him and this fella still thought that it wasn\u2019t enough.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, that\u2019s enough. I don\u2019t want the $5 million. Take the money and open a big shop. You have to help my two dishes become famous.\u201d Lin Fan didn\u2019t really want to say much. \u201cDon\u2019t push it around. If I were to become broke in the future and I can\u2019t afford food, your shop will become my canteen. How does that sound?\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-4\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Bai Ke knew Young Fan\u2019s character. He just accepted it. \u201cAlright, you can eat it every day and I\u2019ll cook it for you. You can bring as many people as you want and I\u2019ll cook for everyone.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, great. That\u2019s all then. I still have things to do. When I return to Zhong Zhou next time, we can meet up again.\u201d</p><br/><p>He felt that the situation was a little weird. He had done such a good deed and if something were to happen, it would be illogical.</p><br/><p>After chatting for a while longer, they hung up.</p><br/><p>At Cloud Street!</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan reached his shop, everyone gathered around him.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian asked, \u201cHow\u2019s the girl?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied with a question, \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian was helpless, \u201cHow would I know if you don\u2019t tell me about it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang looked at a Fraud Tian, \u201cFraud, I think you\u2019re really dumb sometimes. Brother Lin handled the matter. Do you think it\u2019ll still be unresolved? I finally understood why you\u2019re still single. It\u2019s no wonder that you\u2019re single.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGet lost. If not for your curse, I would be attached now. You\u2019re a liar. A f*cking liar.\u201d Fraud Tian was really furious at Zhao Zhong Yang. He didn\u2019t know what happened that night that made Fraud Tian remember it so vividly.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan heaved a sigh of relief. She smiled, \u201cIt\u2019s good that she\u2019s recovered. In the future, she wouldn\u2019t be humiliated by the others.\u201d</p><br/><p>As a woman, she could feel her helplessness. Now that Brother Lin had helped to treat her, it was a happy occasion.</p><br/><p>Wu Tian He sat there and looked at Lin Fan curiously. He was really convinced by Lin Fan. It was impossible for him to not be in awe of him.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-5\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>It was difficult to think that the matter could\u2019ve been resolved so easily.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll not talk about this anymore. I gotta go first. If not, I won\u2019t be able to leave later.\u201d He was frightened at the thought of reporters charging at him.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d The others were curious. They wondered why he was in such a hurry.</p><br/><p>\u201cI just did that. If I were to stay in the shop, what do you think will happen?\u201d Lin Fan answered.</p><br/><p>At that moment.</p><br/><p>The unwanted situation had happened.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin is in the shop! We\u2019re not late!\u201d The reporters shouted. They rushed towards him after exiting from their cars.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, that\u2019s too fast.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was dumbfounded. Were these people professional racers? Their speed was insane.</p><br/><p>The other shop owners were used to seeing so many reporters. After Little Boss had opened his shop, they probably saw more reporters than customers.</p><br/><p>However, they were really curious about it this time. They didn\u2019t know what shocking thing Little Boss did this time. Then, they rushed over as spectators to see what had happened.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t leave now,\u201d Lin Fan gasped. Then, he tried to calm himself down. He had to cheer himself up to face those crazy reporters.</p></div>\n</div>"}

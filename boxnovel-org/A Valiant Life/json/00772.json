He frowned and said in an unhappy tone, \u201cWhat are you doing? We\u2019re in my company. Can you pay attention to your surroundings?\u201d</p><br/><p>This woman was Huang Guo Hui\u2019s wife. She had been with Huang Guo Hui since she was eighteen. Back then, Huang Guo Hui had still been very poor but in a few years, he became rich. As he became richer and richer, her days became worse and worse.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re asking me what I\u2019m doing? I should be asking you what you are doing. Tell me, did you have illegitimate children outside? And did you bring those illegitimate children into your company?\u201d The woman was dressed gorgeously but the way she bellowed at him completely changed her appearance.</p><br/><p>Huang Guo Hui was startled. He started to panic. How did she know?</p><br/><p>He had covered this matter up very well. There should have been no way for her to find out.</p><br/><p>Stay calm. He had to stay calm and not expose himself. Otherwise, who knew what would happen?</p><br/><p>A long time ago, he had had several mistresses. Moreover, these three mistresses had determined wombs. Each of them gave him a son. Hence, whenever he had the time, he would go and visit them one by one.</p><br/><p>He had covered up this matter very tightly and no one knew about it.</p><br/><p>Although on the surface, Huang Hao appeared to be his only son, he was very disappointed in this son. This son had no capabilities at all and not even any ambitions. He would only waste his time on the Internet every day. If Huang Guo Hui was to hand such a big company over to him, Huang Guo Hui wouldn\u2019t feel at ease at all.</p><br/><p>However, the good thing was that his other sons were pretty good. They were all very hardworking. Under his selective promotion, they all became backbones of the company and they were all high-ranking individuals.</p><br/><p>But at this moment, he had to calm his wife down.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat rubbish are you spouting? Please don\u2019t let your imagination run wild,\u201d said Huang Guo Hui with an unusual expression on his face.</p><br/><p>Although he was trying his best to hide it, his little secret had been discovered, so of course, he was feeling guilty and his eyes showed it.</p><br/><p>Indeed, his wife could tell that something was wrong. She had been with Huang Guo Hui for such a long time. She could see through every small action that he made. \u201cDon\u2019t lie to me, Huang Guo Hui. I\u2019ve lived with you for so long. I can see your guilty expression from a mile away. Tell me, did you bring those illegitimate children into the company?\u201d</p><br/><p>Huang Guo Hui\u2019s mind was in a mess. \u201cWhat exactly are you thinking of doing? This is an office, not somewhere to make a scene. Go back, now.\u201d</p><br/><p>His initially nice and kind tone had turned into stern rebuke.</p><br/><p>If this matter was allowed to spread in the company, who knew what would happen?</p><br/><p>*knock knock*</p><br/><p>At that moment, they heard the sound of the door being knocked.</p><br/><p>A young man walked in. \u201cChief Huang, I\u2019ve finished writing the report.\u201d</p><br/><p>When the young man walked in, the woman gave him a death stare and immediately went up to him. She grabbed onto the young man. \u201cHuang Guo Hui, open up your eyes and look. Does he look like you? I can\u2019t take it anymore. The two of you, follow me to the hospital right now. I have to get you checked.</p><br/><p>That young man was in charge of an important department in the company. When he got grabbed onto by that woman, he panicked. Of course, he knew that Huang Guo Hui was his father. However, this could not be known by anyone else, hence, he had hidden this secret very well.</p><br/><p>Huang Guo Hui was enraged. \u201cHow long are you going to keep acting crazy? Have you been possessed? Leave him alone now!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, does your heart ache? Let me tell you, Huang Guo Hui, I don\u2019t care what kind of scum you have outside but you can\u2019t bully others so intolerably and bring your illegitimate children into the company.\u201d The woman\u2019s tone started to become malicious.</p><br/><p>That young man\u2019s expression slowly changed. There was a rage in his heart but he could not let it out. He could only stand there with his head lowered.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat nonsense are you spouting?\u201d growled Huang Guo Hui.</p><br/><p>\u201cNonsense? Look at Weibo for yourself. That Master Lin has already said it. You have three or even four mistresses and you even brought your illegitimate children into important departments in the company. You don\u2019t even want to leave anything for Hao Hao, do you? Back when you were poor, who was the one who always followed you? Now that you\u2019re rich, you\u2019re only looking for beautiful people and you don\u2019t care about me anymore. You can\u2019t be so heartless,\u201d the woman bellowed. This made Huang Guo Hui feel an incomparable sense of guilt.</p><br/><p>But at this moment, he couldn\u2019t think too much. He had just caught onto an important problem.</p><br/><p>Master Lin?</p><br/><p>How could he have known?</p><br/><p>Then, without wasting a second, he unlocked his phone. When he saw the situation on Weibo, he almost couldn\u2019t breathe.</p><br/><p>He saw Master Lin\u2019s Weibo post, explaining everything in detail.</p><br/><p>Calculating using his fingertips?</p><br/><p>F*ck your sister! Huang Guo Hui had told Lin Fan to read his fortune but he had refused. Now, Huang Guo Hui\u2019s private matter had been exposed.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou, with the surname Lin, I\u2019ll f*ck your mom,\u201d after resisting for a long while, Huang Guo Hui finally burst out cursing.</p><br/><p>The woman looked coldly at Huang Guo Hui. \u201cIf you don\u2019t explain yourself today, don\u2019t even think of leaving. Even if everyone has to find out about this, I\u2019ll make you realize that Hao Hao and I are not people you can bully.\u201d</p><br/><p>Huang Guo Hui looked at his wife in front of him. His tone became gentler as he said, \u201cDon\u2019t be rash. Let\u2019s talk slowly.\u201d</p><br/><p>At this point, he could only try to calm the situation. What else could he do?</p><br/><p>But he had never expected that this Master Lin would be so vicious, completely forcing him into a corner.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan didn\u2019t know that Huang Guo Hui was already in the midst of a helpless situation. However, even if he knew, it didn\u2019t have a rat\u2019s a*s to do with him. After all, he wasn\u2019t going to take this blame. If Huang Guo Hui wanted to blame someone, he should blame himself for being too impudent and causing trouble for Lin Fan. Wasn\u2019t that just asking for death?</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian said in a shocked tone, \u201cDo you think that Chief Huang is using this method to get back at us?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded, \u201cThat\u2019s very possible. But he never expected our Shanghai government to be so righteous. It can\u2019t be controlled by him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian didn\u2019t think that was the case. \u201cI think it\u2019s because you\u2019re so powerful that no one dares to touch you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCheh. I\u2019m powerful? I\u2019m just a good citizen. I wouldn\u2019t frame anyone,\u201d Lin Fan rebutted. Of course, he silently agreed that what Fraud Tian said was right. It was all because he was too amazing. It couldn\u2019t be helped. He was just too amazing. What more could be said?</p><br/><p>That Huang Guo Hui was done for at this point. Lin Fan had exposed him and that was enough to overwhelm him. Family problems have a great impact on things.</p><br/><p>He was going to suffer.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, where\u2019s Elder Dog?\u201d At this moment, Lin fan realized that Elder Dog was missing. Just in this short period of time, Elder Dog had disappeared from under their eyes.</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang said, \u201cHe was just here. How did he disappear in the blink of an eye?\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian chuckled, \u201cI think that Elder Dog must have been feeling lonely, so he went out to look for some fun.\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, on the road.</p><br/><p>The righteous Elder Dog looked around with his dog eyes. \u201cI am the righteous Elder Dog. I have to do righteous things.\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Elder Dog saw that an elderly lady was about to jaywalk across the road. He immediately dashed forward viciously.</p><br/><p>There were so many cars. It was very dangerous.</p><br/><p>He knew this well. He had had many little buddies who had gotten mercilessly crushed by vehicles because they had jaywalked.</p><br/><p>He had to stop this elderly lady.</p><br/><p>*woof woof*</p><br/><p>Elder Dog barked in a lively manner. His four dog legs were like a motor. He was moving at an insane speed. It was simply frightening.</p><br/><p>If Lin Fan was there, his jaw would have dropped for sure.</p><br/><p>This dog was f*cking great at running.</p></div>\n</div>"}

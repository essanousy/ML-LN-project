Stop disturbing me. Film directors like you just call because of a stupid event.\u201d</p><br/><p>He felt really helpless. He had received a lot of calls and he regretted publishing his phone number on Weibo. The number of calls was insane.</p><br/><p>The phone remained silent for a few seconds before another call came.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, it\u2019s me. I am Wang Ke Hao.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ke Hao was a little embarrassed after he had heard those words since he was a film director too.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was stunned. When he saw the display on his phone, he said, \u201cOh, it\u2019s Director Wang. Sorry, I wasn\u2019t trying to shame you. It\u2019s just that I have received a lot of calls from film directors after Elder Dog won the prize and I\u2019m really upset.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI understand.\u201d Wang Ke Hao had watched the award ceremony and he was really impressed that Master Lin\u2019s dog had won a prize.</p><br/><p>It was awesome, really awesome.</p><br/><p>He hadn\u2019t left Shanghai during this period of time as he had been busy preparing the ideas, funds, and logistics for the movie.</p><br/><p>\u201cDirector Wang, what is it?\u201d Lin Fan hadn\u2019t really read the news recently. Wang Ke Hao\u2019s film production had already started.</p><br/><p>He had already come up with the movie name.</p><br/><p>\u2018The Racer Dad\u2019.</p><br/><p>It was considered a heartwarming film. At the same time, it was an action film. After all, it included the popular trends of the modern society.</p><br/><p>Wang Ke Hao said, \u201cMaster Lin, the film production has begun. We are at the Nanshan Children\u2019s Welfare Institute. Do you have time to visit us?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan thought about his promise to them and he was pretty free now. Since his knowledge task required him to roam around, he felt that going for that was a good choice.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll be there,\u201d Lin Fan replied.</p><br/><p>Nanshan Children\u2019s Welfare Institute.</p><br/><p>\u201cDirector Wang, will Master Lin be back later?\u201d Zheng Long went forward and asked him. He was the main cast of the show. Meanwhile, Li Meng Hua was acting as a policeman.</p><br/><p>The film would start with Zheng Long driving the car and traveling at a ridiculously high speed. Because he was drunk, the car flipped and the bag of diamonds on him scattered around. When he was unconscious, some children appeared and took them. Then, the welfare institute got involved and the rightful owners of the diamonds were also looking for Zheng Long. Meanwhile, Li Meng Hua was a policeman and got dragged into this incident.</p><br/><p>That was the main outline of the plot.</p><br/><p>Wang Ke Hao said, \u201cYeah, he will be here. I just made a call and got scolded by Master Lin. Looks like after Master Lin\u2019s dog became famous, a lot of investors are looking at the film industry.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zheng Long smiled. He knew about this incident and he had been shocked when he had found out about it.</p><br/><p>The children at the Nanshan Children\u2019s Welfare Institute were looking at what was happening outside.</p><br/><p>Just then, the person in charge of the actors rushed over.</p><br/><p>\u201cDirector Wang, something\u2019s wrong. Xiao Li, the stuntman for the car scene, can\u2019t make it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ke Hao was anxious after hearing that. \u201cWhy can\u2019t he make it? This is the start of the film. We have to wait for him.\u201d</p><br/><p>He said helplessly. \u201cDirector Wang, he said he went to another production instead and he can\u2019t make it in time. Should we just do it tomorrow?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ke Hao was furious. He raised his hand. \u201cTell him to get here right now. The whole team is waiting for him. Does he know how much money we are losing? Is he going to pay?\u201d</p><br/><p>The director was furious. And this made the person in charge frightened and at a loss for words.</p><br/><p>However, he couldn\u2019t blame the director for being angry. The entire production expenses were pretty steep.</p><br/><p>It included the venue\u2019s rental fee, the workers\u2019 wages, and the props. Those were high costs.</p><br/><p>Zheng Long furrowed his brows. He was really unhappy with these people that didn\u2019t turn up. Furthermore, film productions would be greatly affected by situations like these.</p><br/><p>Now that the stuntman couldn\u2019t make it, where could they find another one?</p><br/><p>\u201cDirector Wang, what should we do?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ke Hao said, \u201cWhat else can we do? We just wasted today. Besides, we spent so much effort deciding on this place. They only gave us one day. Where can we find someone like him?\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, Li Meng Hua looked into the distance. \u201cDirector Wang, Master Lin is here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ke Hao\u2019s anger slowly vanished after hearing that. However, he was still really unhappy. Now that he had to welcome Master Lin, he couldn\u2019t greet him with a foul attitude.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan parked his car and walked towards the Children\u2019s Welfare Institute. He looked around and realized that there were a lot of workers. Director Wang was indeed a renown director. Everything looked prepared.</p><br/><p>\u201cDirector Wang.\u201d Lin Fan went up to Wang Ke Hao and greeted him.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, you are here.\u201d Wang Ke Hao smiled. He looked totally opposite from a few moments ago as if nothing had happened.</p><br/><p>\u201cUncle Lin\u2026\u201d the children shouted after seeing Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved towards them and said, \u201cBe good, I\u2019ll hang out with all of you later.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Meng Hua and Zheng Long saw how popular Master Lin was with the kids. If Master Lin were to get involved in another piece of scandalous news, they wouldn\u2019t believe it.</p><br/><p>Right now, they only believed what they saw. After all, it was difficult to find a person that was so good with children.</p><br/><p>It was difficult for children to hide their true feelings.</p><br/><p>Children only liked or disliked a person. Their smiles were genuine and it showed how much they loved Master Lin.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at Wang Ke Hao and asked, \u201cDirector Wang, did something bad happen? You look off.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Ke Hao sighed. \u201cThe stuntman decided not to come. The starting scene starts with a difficult car stunt. An ordinary stuntman wouldn\u2019t be able to do it. We already signed the contract with him about a month ago. He suddenly said he isn\u2019t coming today. He said that without even thinking about how much money we\u2019re going to lose.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDirector Wang, it is because of me. I should have followed up with it closely. If I did, this wouldn\u2019t have happened,\u201d the person in charge of the actors said.</p><br/><p>He was a loyal worker for Director Wang and he felt really bad that this had happened.</p><br/><p>The stunt coordinator said, \u201cLet\u2019s find another local stuntman. We can simplify the actions.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, it has to be exquisite,\u201d Wang Ke Hao said.</p><br/><p><em>Special stunts?</em></p><br/><p>Lin Fan stroked his chin. He felt that he would be able to do the car stunt. After all, he was Qingtian Bay\u2019s Racing God. He should be able to take that stuntman\u2019s place.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow about I try?\u201d Lin Fan asked.</p><br/><p>Wang Ke Hao was stunned. He slapped his thigh. \u201cRight! Master Lin should be able to help.\u201d</p><br/><p>However, he thought that Master Lin was going to find a stuntman to take his place. He didn\u2019t know that Master Lin was going to do it personally.</p></div>\n</div>"}

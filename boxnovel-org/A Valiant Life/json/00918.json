She hadn\u2019t thought that such a noble cause would be mistaken for multi-level marketing.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-1\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>To her, this was a kind of humiliation.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, please mind your words,\u201d the young lady warned angrily. It was as if she would go to war with Lin Fan if he said another wrong word.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, alright, I\u2019ll mind my words. But I\u2019m really not interested. Your goal is too ambitious. Really, I won\u2019t be able to help. Why don\u2019t you find someone else?\u201d said Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>He felt that these people had to either be crazy or mentally ill.</p><br/><p><em>Immortality? Dream on.</em></p><br/><p>Of course, it wasn\u2019t impossible. Because he had the Encyclopedia, there might be a Xianxia class of knowledge that allowed one to gain immortality.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-2\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>As for what these people in front of him were saying, he didn\u2019t believe it one bit. Even if they were to beat him to death, he wouldn\u2019t believe it.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The old-timer hurriedly stopped Lin Fan from leaving. \u201cMaster Lin, please listen to me. It might be an impossible thing to you but to me, it isn\u2019t completely impossible. I just wish for you to cooperate with us.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved his hand. He wasn\u2019t one bit interested. \u201cI\u2019m very sorry but I\u2019m not interested at all. Please excuse me.\u201d</p><br/><p>The old-timer shook his head. He wouldn\u2019t give up yet. He had been noticing all the rising talents of the world. Whenever a top-class biologist and geneticist appeared, he would offer great benefits to hire them and get them to join his research.</p><br/><p>Of course, many people would believe it was impossible at first. They would feel that he had to be dreaming.</p><br/><p>But after being hired, those people wouldn\u2019t have to immerse in their work for long before they stopped doubting him. Thereafter, they would completely immerse themselves in their work because they realized that immortality was possible.</p><br/><p>Even if the old-timer tried to fire them, they would lament and be unwilling to leave. They were unwilling to lose the chance for a contribution towards such a great cause. Even if they weren\u2019t paid, they would still carry on the research using their own funds. All of this was for the fruition of immortality.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-3\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Right now, he understood that Master Lin\u2019s rejection was completely normal but he believed that as long as Master Lin would just dabble in the research, he would understand the marvel of their project.</p><br/><p>The lady next to him said, \u201cTeacher, I think he doesn\u2019t understand at all just how mystical what we\u2019re researching is.\u201d</p><br/><p>The old-timer looked over at her. \u201cDon\u2019t say that. That\u2019s because Master Lin has never personally seen our research. It\u2019s normal to have suspicions.\u201d Then, he turned his gaze to Lin Fan again. \u201cMaster Lin, if possible, please come with us to America. Once you\u2019re there, you\u2019ll understand just how mystical our research is.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan frowned. <em>F*ck, this guy is really crazy. </em>Then, he didn\u2019t want to stay any longer. He felt that he had just encountered a really strange occurrence.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot interested.\u201d</p><br/><p>The old-timer looking at Lin Fan as he walked away and couldn\u2019t help but sigh.<em>Looks like this Master Lin really can\u2019t understand how mystical our research is after all.</em></p><br/><p>\u201cSigh, there\u2019s no hurry. Master Lin hasn\u2019t understood our idea yet. But I believe that when he does, he will definitely become a part of our team. This is research that will change the human race,\u201d said the old-timer.</p><br/><p>The lady next to him nodded. Her expression suddenly brightened up. \u201cI believe that this research will definitely be successful.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was cursing maniacally in his heart. <em>Where do these people come from? Why does it feel like they\u2019re crazy? Especially that old-timer, he\u2019s frighteningly crazy.</em></p><br/><p><em>I won\u2019t be able to continue my fishing today.</em></p><div class=\"code-block code-block-4\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p><em>But it doesn\u2019t matter. There\u2019s no hurry. As long as I fish a few times a day, I will eventually get something good.</em></p><br/><p>The next day!</p><br/><p>Lin Fan arrived at Cloud Street. He was planning to have a good rest, so he didn\u2019t rush at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, that old-timer from yesterday appeared again.</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan saw him. He was stunned. His expression turned strange. \u201cI\u2019m really not interested. Please do not come looking for me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian looked at that old man, wondering what he wanted. But judging by his appearance, he wasn\u2019t an average person. He looked like a tycoon.</p><br/><p>The old man walked into the shop and sat in front of Lin Fan. \u201cMaster Lin, please believe me. I\u2019ve seen news about you on the Internet and discovered your medical ability. It\u2019s truly stunning. You\u2019re the kind of talent that we\u2019re lacking, so I came all this way just to invite you to join us.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBelieve me, you definitely won\u2019t regret it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian was curious. He still didn\u2019t know what the heck was going on. \u201cWhat\u2019s this about? Join what?\u201d</p><br/><p>Before Lin Fan could speak, the old man started speaking confidently, \u201cWe\u2019re inviting Master Lin to join us in researching the key to immortality for humans. This is a sacred topic of research. If it succeeds, it will completely change the world. And our names will be remembered by the human race forever.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d When Fraud Tian heard that, he was stupefied.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-5\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p><em>Immortality? Is this old man crazy?</em></p><br/><p>Then, he looked at Lin Fan strangely, as if to ask what they should do. He started to draw numbers with his finger to suggest to Lin Fan if they should call 110 or whether they should call the mental hospital to tell them to take this patient back.</p><br/><p>After all, the gates of mental hospitals were often not locked. Many patients would escape and start causing harm to the public.</p><br/><p>The old man looked at Fraud Tian. \u201cThat\u2019s right. I came back from overseas this time because I sincerely want to invite Master Lin to join us.\u201d Then, he looked back at Lin Fan. \u201cMaster Lin, your talent shouldn\u2019t be wasted. You should use it on something purposeful. Believe me, we won\u2019t disappoint you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan sighed. He was really helpless. He didn\u2019t even know what to say anymore.</p><br/><p>He had been doing perfectly fine, why did this person have to start targeting him?</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, please seriously consider this. I\u2019ll be back tomorrow.\u201d The old man smiled calmly before getting up to leave.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was stunned. You\u2019re <em>still coming tomorrow? You\u2019re crazy!</em></p><br/><p>Wu You Lan came to Lin Fan\u2019s side as she looked at the old man in the distance. \u201cBrother Lin, why do I feel as if this is multi-level marketing?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shrugged. \u201cHow should I know? All I know is that it isn\u2019t anything good.\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-6\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang said, \u201cIf this old man comes again tomorrow, does it mean that he\u2019ll keep bothering us?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was frustrated. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t even know who I offended to have to get involved in this. What the heck is this?\u201d</p><br/><p>He really didn\u2019t understand. He had been fishing happily. Why did this matter have to pop up? Moreover, it was clear that this old man had done his research about him and his patience was a little scary. If Lin Fan were to reject him, he might not let Lin Fan go so easily.</p><br/><p><em>It seems that I\u2019ll have to do something in order to save myself some suffering.</em></p><br/><p><em>Otherwise, if he comes every day, I\u2019ll be tormented to death.</em></p></div>\n</div>"}

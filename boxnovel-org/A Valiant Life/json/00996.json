The dog barks had come from here. In the cars were cages and in each cage was a dog.</p><br/><p>At that moment, a person in protective clothing was holding a specialized equipment in his hand, which gripped onto the head of a dog while another man opened a cage for him to put the dog in.</p><br/><p>Although countless shop owners were around telling them to stop, they did not stop.</p><br/><p>Elder Dog was glaring angrily at this scene and barking fiercely. Sister Hong was a the side, consoling him, telling him not to be rash. Then, she glared at them as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cStop right there. What are you doing? These are Cloud Street\u2019s dogs. What rights do you have to capture them?\u201d Sister Hong yelled furiously.</p><br/><p>One of the workers replied in a very calm tone as if he wasn\u2019t affected at all. As he replied, he used his equipment to grab hold of the dog simultaneously. However, that dog dodged quickly enough to escape.</p><br/><p>\u201cThese are orders given from above. There are too many stray dogs and they\u2019ve caused a huge impact. They\u2019ve even hurt people. So, we need to clean them up. Hurry up and move aside now. These dogs aren\u2019t your pets, so there\u2019s no need to care about them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sister Hong stood in front of him to block him. \u201cNo, they\u2019re from Cloud Street, so they\u2019re our pets. Hurry up and open the cages to let the dogs out.\u201d</p><br/><p>Those workers ignored Sister Hong along with the spectating shop owners as they continued their work. They held sticks in their hands and started hitting them against the cages.</p><br/><p>Elder Dog bared his fangs as he growled in a deep tone.</p><br/><p>Those dogs in the cage were shouting, \u201cBoss, save us!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBoss, please save our lives!\u201d</p><br/><p>When Elder Dog heard his little brothers asking for help, he couldn\u2019t ignore them as their boss. If his wife\u2019s owner hadn\u2019t stopped him, he would have charged forward to go to battle with these guys long ago.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, this dog is quite fierce. Come, I need more people here to help me capture him.\u201d A fat worker ignored that ferocious gaze and continued working calmly.</p><br/><p>He was already used to such situations. What could these people possibly do? Beat them up?</p><br/><p>This was Shanghai. People would go to jail for hitting other people. Even causing a minor injury would put one in jail for several months. Hence, they weren\u2019t afraid at all.</p><br/><p><em>If you have the balls, come and hit us. If not, then move aside. </em>This is what they were thinking.</p><br/><p>Then, a dog-catching pole came swinging towards Elder Dog. But suddenly, someone grabbed it.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan had arrived at the scene. Taking a close look, it seemed rather serious. Elder Dog\u2019s little brothers had all been captured. They were trying to catch them all in one go.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you all doing? Why are you catching our Cloud Street\u2019s dogs?\u201d Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>The shop owners heaved a sigh of relief when they saw that Little Boss had come. It was as if they saw Little Boss as their pillar of support.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Boss, I don\u2019t know who made a report. We\u2019ve been targeted by higher-ups. They want to capture all the stray dogs of Cloud Street,\u201d Elder Liang exclaimed angrily. He really wanted to beat up the person who had made the report.</p><br/><p>Hearing that, Lin Fan didn\u2019t have to think anymore. He immediately knew who had made that report.</p><br/><p>Who else could it be besides Zhou Shi Ming?</p><br/><p>Thinking about Zhou Shi Ming\u2019s capabilities, this could really be done by him. Lin Fan knew many people in Shanghai and most leaders also knew the situation here in Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>However, Zhou Shi Ming was quite smart. He hadn\u2019t caused trouble for Lin Fan directly but he targeted Lin Fan\u2019s dog instead. Even those people who were concerned about Lin Fan didn\u2019t really pay attention to the dogs of Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>After all, dogs were very normal. They were just stray dogs and they could be captured easily. What problem could there be?</p><br/><p>\u201cGuys, please let the dogs go. These are Cloud Street\u2019s dogs.\u201d Lin Fan used a very polite tone. They were only doing their jobs and he didn\u2019t want to make things hard for them.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t, Master Lin. We\u2019ve received orders to clean up the stray dogs in Cloud Street. This is for your own good. These stray dogs urinate and poop wherever they want. It isn\u2019t hygenic, is it?\u201d The worker\u2019s tone became warmer. It seemed that he knew Master Lin.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to worry about that. To take care of our hygiene, we pay additional money to the cleaners for them to help us clear the dogs\u2019 waste. Moreover, these dogs don\u2019t urinate and poop wherever they want either. They all abide by the rules.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRules?\u201d When the worker heard that, he instantly started laughing. \u201cMaster Lin, don\u2019t make things hard for us. This is an order from above. And you\u2019re saying that these dogs have rules. How is that possible?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan waved his hand. \u201cI\u2019m really not lying to you. Our Cloud Street\u2019s dogs have rules and they\u2019re even more well-behaved than people. They don\u2019t ever urinate or poop anywhere they want. They all have designated areas. And they\u2019re not stray dogs. They\u2019re pets raised by the people of Cloud Street.\u201d</p><br/><p>The worker said, \u201cMaster Lin, I know that your Cloud Street is very united. These dogs live here and are fed by you guys as well. But when tourists come, it\u2019ll leave bad impression.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan felt that he was unable to get through to these workers.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen just tell me one thing. Are you going to release them?\u201d Lin Fan asked.</p><br/><p>The worker replied, \u201cMaster Lin, we won\u2019t catch any more. As for those we\u2019ve caught, it\u2019s fine if we just bring these to report back, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. You have to release all of them,\u201d said Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>The workers couldn\u2019t accept Master Lin\u2019s request. At the same time, they felt that this Master Lin was rather nosy. He hadn\u2019t been bitten by a dog before and he didn\u2019t know the danger of dogs. Moreover, having someone who wasn\u2019t their superior commanding them like this, they felt deep in their hearts that they couldn\u2019t accept it.</p><br/><p>It felt as if they could only express their individuality through rejecting him. Hence, they directly rejected him.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, we cannot release them. If you have any problems, you can report them to our leader,\u201d said one of the workers.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was lost for words. <em>Do they have to do this? Looks like I have no choice now.</em></p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re drawing the anger of the masses, do you know that? Do you know who these dogs are?\u201d asked Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>The workers instantly burst out laughing. <em>Who </em>these dogs are <em>? This is the first time I\u2019ve heard something like that. Aren\u2019t they just mutts? What\u2019s so special about them?</em></p><br/><p>At that moment, Lin Fan didn\u2019t say anymore nonsense. \u201cI\u2019d warn you to release them. Don\u2019t make a big deal out of this. These dogs that you\u2019ve captured are all heroes, do you know that? Do you know about the raid on the human traffickers last year? That was the work of these dogs. And as for this dog, do you know his identity?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet me tell you. He\u2019s the only dog chosen as one of Touching China\u2019s Top Ten People. This is an invitation letter that was just delivered. Do you recognize it?\u201d</p><br/><p>The workers were dumbfounded. Each line that Master Lin said had made them stunned.</p><br/><p>And the shop owners were dumbfounded as well. They felt that what Little Boss had said was a little unreal.</p><br/><p>The only dog chosen as one of the Touching China\u2019s Top Ten People. How had that happened?</p><br/><p>Even if Little Boss was bragging, he couldn\u2019t brag like that.</p><br/><p>But when they saw the invitation letter in Master Lin\u2019s hand, everyone was stupefied.</p><br/><p>And it wasn\u2019t even over yet. The next words left them even more astonished. There\u2019s a saying that a dog relies on its master\u2019s power. But they felt that sometimes, dogs rely on their own power.</p></div>\n</div>"}

Perhaps the elderly really know best. He was the ultimate pretender. When everyone didn't know what to do, Wu Tian He suddenly said that he might be able to help.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, he sounded extremely conservative. He didn't seem like he was certain of it. However, his tone sounded rather assuring. That made everyone a little curious as to what he was going to say next. </p><br/><p>The broadcast instantly went wild.</p><br/><p>\"666\u2026, an expert was actually hidden in Master Lin's shop.\"</p><br/><p>\"Besides 6, I can't even say anything else.\"</p><br/><p>\"Judging from his expression, I think he's extremely sure.\"</p><br/><p>\"Ever since Brother Yang had been given a new life, the quality of the broadcasts has increased. It's brought us to a new world.\"</p><br/><p>\"We don't have to say anything else. Just based on this, we have to send a wave of presents before we can settle down.\"</p><br/><p>... </p><br/><p>Wu You Lan was stunned. She felt like it was unimaginable for him to know how to help. \"Dad, what do you have in mind? Don't tell me you know the Internet celebrities on Weibo\u2026\"</p><br/><p>She knew that her dad had a lot of connections but most of them were political leaders. Those wealthy men that he knew were locals from Lian Zhou. Even if they were extremely capable, it was useless. She understood that this matter couldn't be helped by the leaders even if he called them up.</p><br/><p>Wu Tian He laughed, \"I'll try making a call. I can't just watch Master Lin suffer.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan just stared at him. He didn't know what Wu Tian He was up to. Then, Wu Tian He's call managed to get through. Lin Fan listened intently.</p><br/><p>Wu Tian He laughed, \"Chief Zhao, do you remember me, the old man?\" </p><br/><p>Chief Zhao sounded modest over the phone but at the same time, he sounded respectful. \"Elder Wu, I'm not worthy of that salutation. Just calling me Mr. Zhao will do.\"</p><br/><p>Wu Tian He nodded, \"Mr. Zhao, I actually have a favor to ask of you.\" </p><br/><p>Chief Zhao replied, \"Elder Wu, you must think too highly of me. Go ahead and speak about it. If you hadn't advised me that year, I wouldn't have had such a successful life. I am eternally grateful for what you've done for me.\"</p><br/><p>Wu Tian He laughed, \"Thank you for remembering that. Weibo has banned my teacher's account. I was wondering if you could help him out with this.\" </p><br/><p>\"Huh? Elder Wu, your teacher's Weibo account got banned by my company? I will send someone to unban it immediately. At the same time, I will investigate it thoroughly and let you know as soon as possible.\" </p><br/><p>Lin Fan was stunned. How did Wu Tian He know the boss of Weibo? Furthermore, the boss sounded as if he was speaking to a superior. The problem was complicated and although Wu Tian He was extremely capable, the things just didn't gel together. As a fortune-teller, Wu Tian He should be dealing with wealthy men and political leaders, instead of the boss of a giant tech company. How was that possible? Everyone was puzzled.</p><br/><p>... </p><br/><p>After that, Wu Tian He didn't speak much about the matter. Out of concern as an elder, he asked about some other things.</p><br/><p>Wu Tian He raised his cup of tea and took a sip. \"Mr. Zhao, I remember the time when I gave your company the name, 'Qi Yi'. Do you know the meaning now?\" </p><br/><p>Chief Zhao replied, \"Of course. Elder Wu, don't worry, I will handle this matter properly.\"</p><br/><p>Wu Tian He laughed, \"Thank you, Mr. Zhao. Just carry on with your work, please. The Heavens are looking at what you're doing. Do not follow my path in the future.\"</p><br/><p>Chief Zhao was shocked. He didn't know what Elder Wu was referring to but he still replied respectfully.</p><br/><p>After hanging up.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan asked in shock, \"Dad, did you just call the boss of Qi Yi Weibo?\"</p><br/><p>Wu Tian He smiled and nodded.</p><br/><p>\"Twenty years ago, when I hadn't ruined my fate yet, I only read the fortunes of the wealthy and powerful. Only those that were fated were able to get their fortunes read. There was once when I drove past a bridge and I saw this Mr. Zhao trying to end his life. He was in his twenties and he had just graduated from college. I went up to speak to him and gave him advice\u2026\"</p><br/><p>After hearing what Wu Tian He said, Lin Fan sensed that he didn't just give him advice. If it was solely a piece of advice, Chief Zhao wouldn't have been so respectful towards him. There must have been something more to this.</p><br/><p>At the headquarters of Qi Yi Weibo. </p><br/><p>Zhao Ming didn't want to be responsible for this but now that Elder Wu had called, he was anxious.</p><br/><p>Others may not have known about the impact that Elder Wu had on his life but he knew of it. </p><br/><p>It could be said that without Elder Wu, Zhao Ming wouldn't have achieved anything to date.</p><br/><p>After a phone call.</p><br/><p>The person in charge of Weibo's e-operations had to explain the impact of unbanning Lin Fan's Weibo account. </p><br/><p>However, to Zhao Ming, Elder Wu had called him for the first time in twenty years. How could he not help him out?</p><br/><p>He didn't change his mobile number in twenty years. He had been looking forward to a call from him. What's more surprising was that Elder Wu didn't even forget his number. He was extremely touched.</p><br/><p>He didn't bother about what the person in charge said. He immediately scolded him. If the matter wasn't resolved promptly, he would've fired him.</p><br/><p>In the end, the person in charge could sense that Chief Zhao was extremely angry and he didn't dare to continue rebutting. He immediately gave instructions to his subordinates to not bother about this particular matter on Weibo.</p><br/><p>... </p><br/><p>At Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled, \"My Weibo got banned. I initially didn't plan to do much to these two inhumane beasts. But now, I have to do do something about it.\"</p><br/><p>Repost, repost every single thing. </p><br/><p>Then, he called Wang Ming Yang and asked him to repost it too. They didn't want to flame anyone. They just wanted to increase the number of reposts. If they could resolve the problem with the click of a button, what could possibly stop them from settling this matter?</p><br/><p>Starlight Film School. </p><br/><p>Xia Yi Mo and Huang Miao Miao were walking around in school. The surrounding students pointed towards the two of them and gossiped among themselves. The students here were more realistic than other average students.</p><br/><p>They knew that if they became close to these two people, they would definitely be affected as well. Hence, they avoided them like a plague.</p><br/><p>There were still some students who didn't know what had happened. They went around asking people and people naturally told them the details.</p><br/><p>These two people damaged the reputation of the professors, etc.</p><br/><p>Just then, Xia Yi Mo looked at her phone and was extremely shocked. </p><br/><p>Huang Miao Miao asked, \"What's wrong?\"</p><br/><p>Xia Mo Yi immediately passed the phone to Huang Miao Miao, \"Look, quick, have a look\u2026\"</p><br/><p>The two of them were dumbfounded when they looked at Weibo. </p><br/><p>Twilight Sad Melody: \"Help Master Lin repost\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Dreaming of a Thousand Downloads: \"Help Master Lin repost\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Dreamy Brother; \"Help Master Lin repost\u2026\"</p><br/><p>... </p><br/><p>Countless netizens started to repost frantically. Although there was just one Internet celebrity, being Master Lin, they still asked for reposts. That was because the fans of this Internet celebrity had power. These Internet celebrities had such tremendous influence on average netizens. </p><br/><p>They didn't need Internet celebrities for this issue anyway because everyone started to repost intensely and this naturally swayed the situation. It immediately covered the hottest topic on Weibo.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan immediately posted on Weibo and mentioned Jiang Li and Chen Juan.</p><br/><p>\"Two inhumane beasts, even my Elder Dog Nicholas doesn't want to associate with you.\"</p><br/><p>Then, Lin Fan took a picture of Elder Dog Nicholas.</p><br/><p>In the picture, Elder Dog Nicholas had his head raised and his eyes were glaring with disdain.</p><br/><p>...</p><br/>\n</div>"}

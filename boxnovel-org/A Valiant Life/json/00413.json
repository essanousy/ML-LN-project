When Zhao Ming Qing returned, the eldest child, Zhao Li Xing, immediately went forward.</p><br/><p>The other siblings looked at their oldest brother as this matter required him to take action. The younger siblings sat aside to act as a backup.</p><br/><p>Their eldest brother was more capable than them and held a higher status as well in the corporate world. His brother was extremely renown. Besides their dad, their eldest brother had the biggest say in the family.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing was exhausted after working for the entire day but he felt that it had been worth it. After following his mentor, he felt that he had been totally changed. He had learned so much knowledge that he had never known before.</p><br/><p>When he returned home, he only took a glance at his children. He was still a little angry. These children had ruined his mentorship ceremony and he still remembered it. It wasn\u2019t because he was petty, it was because this was a major problem and if they weren\u2019t his children, he\u2019d definitely have beaten them to death.</p><br/><p>Zhao Li Xing remained silent for a while and when he saw his dad go into the study room without saying anything, he stood up. \u201cDad\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing frowned. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Why are you guys so free to be here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe know about what\u2019s happening online. This matter has blown up. A few leaders contacted me. Dad, I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re up to but you have to be cautious about some things,\u201d Zhao Li Xing said.</p><br/><p>Zhao Shi frowned. \u201cLi Xing\u2026\u201d It was as if she was blaming her son for not speaking to his dad respectfully.</p><br/><p>However, Zhao Li Xing was extremely affected by it. He was worried that his dad had done something illegal. It wasn\u2019t that he didn\u2019t believe in his dad. It was because his dad had totally changed after getting that young fella as a mentor. He would lock himself in his study room every day and nobody knew what he was doing.</p><br/><p>Zhao Li Xing\u2019s status allowed him to check on Master Lin and he found out everything about him. He felt that it was unbelievable.</p><br/><p>Scallion pancakes, martial arts, fortune-telling, athletics, locksmithing, etc. These made him feel that it was extremely unbelievable.</p><br/><p>When someone seemed extremely powerful, it didn\u2019t necessarily mean that he was really capable. Zhao Li Xing felt that something was wrong.</p><br/><p>Zhao Li Xing looked at his son. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to bother about my things. Just take good care of yourself.\u201d Then, he went up immediately and didn\u2019t say anything else. He was exhilarated. The prescription was finally complete and it was because of his mentor\u2019s guidance. This was a happy occasion for him and he really wanted to tell everyone about it.</p><br/><p>However, his mentor had told him to take it slow and not be impatient. He had to take it one step at a time and only tell everyone about it the next day.</p><br/><p>Zhao Li Xing continued, \u201cDad, this matter doesn\u2019t just concern you. It concerns all of us. Do you even know how we\u2019re being humiliated outside?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha,\u201d Zhao Ming Qing sneered. \u201cYou care about what others say? Alright, then you guys can disown me as a father. I will not blame you at all.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Shi snapped when she heard that, \u201cWhat are you saying?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Li Xing said, \u201cDad, what happened to you? Did that young fella feed you some unusual medicine? I\u2019ll get someone to bring him away and see what\u2019s wrong with him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou dare?!\u201d Suddenly, Zhao Ming Qing\u2019s face turned red and he started to breathe heavily. \u201cLet me tell you, if you dare to do that, I\u2019ll break your legs.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Li Xing was infuriated. \u201cDad, why are you so stubborn? This matter is literally impossible. If you don\u2019t settle the matter about that video, your reputation will be tarnished for life.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk to you about anything. You guys don\u2019t understand at all. The youngsters these days only care about what others think. You\u2019ll never be successful,\u201d Zhao Ming Qing said.</p><br/><p>Zhao Li Xing rebutted, \u201cDad if I cared about what others think, I wouldn\u2019t have attained my status today.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStatus? Did you achieve it by yourself? If I didn\u2019t let down my ego and ask a friend to help you, do you think you can be who you are today with your own capabilities?\u201d Zhao Ming Qing was furious. He had initially been happy but now he had been agitated by his own son.</p><br/><p>Zhao Bin and the others were stunned. They hadn\u2019t expected things to turn out like this. It was hopeless.</p><br/><p>\u201cI got it based on my own abilities,\u201d Zhao Li Xing rebutted. He didn\u2019t want anyone to belittle his achievement.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing waved his hand. \u201cI don\u2019t want to argue with you anymore. You think you\u2019ve grown up and you have your own opinion. Let me tell you this, your dad isn\u2019t old and stupid. I know what I\u2019m doing. I taught all of you since young. Don\u2019t even think about teaching me what to do. You\u2019re not that capable.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Shi was anxious. \u201cDon\u2019t be angry, talk nicely to him. The children are worried about you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph,\u201d Zhao Ming Qing sneered. He didn\u2019t say anything and went up. He slammed the door shut and didn\u2019t want to talk to anyone.</p><br/><p>Zhao Shi looked at her son. \u201cLi Xing, don\u2019t argue with your dad. Your dad will always be your father.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Li Xing replied, \u201cIt\u2019s because he\u2019s my dad that I don\u2019t want him to sink even deeper. Mum, you saw what happened recently. None of them were good things. The whole nation knows about what happened after they read the articles online.\u201d</p><br/><p>In the study room.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing sat on the wooden chair and took deep breaths to calm himself down. Then, he shook his head in despair. He thought about when his children had still been young and they all looked up to him and listened to whatever he said. He had always seemed to be right in his children\u2019s eyes. However, his children had grown up and they didn\u2019t trust him anymore.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing was tired after thinking about it.</p><br/><p>However, it concerned the love of his life \u2013 Chinese medicine. Then, his heart burned with determination again. Chinese medicine wasn\u2019t so inferior. It had thousands of years of history. How could Chinese medicine only be used to maintain good health?</p><br/><p>When he thought of the hard work that he had put in for the past few days and that the results were finally out, he felt extremely happy.</p><br/><p>He thought of what his mentor had said.</p><br/><p>\u2018Tomorrow will be the day Chinese medicine sees its glory.\u2019</p><br/><p>Perhaps it could be said to be the day that he would save his reputation.</p><br/><p>The next day!</p><br/><p>In the morning.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing stood outside the hospital. There were a lot of reporters and people around him.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan had prepared the scallion pancakes. It was already 9:30 am and it was the timing that he had chosen specifically.</p><br/><p>No matter what, he had to sell the scallion pancakes every day.</p><br/><p>When Zhao Ming Qing appeared outside the hospital, someone was so furious that he smashed a bottle of beverage at Zhao Ming Qing\u2019s feet.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s him! The inhumane and unethical elderly Chinese doctor.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

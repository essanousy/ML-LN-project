He would just go to Cloud Street each day to sell some pancakes and show off to everyone a little.</p><br/><p>\u201cSigh. These days are way too repetitive. It\u2019s really too boring sometimes! I envy Elder Dog. He gets to go out to play every day,\u201d said Zhao Zhong Yang as he played with his phone.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked outside. Elder Dog was surrounded by a group of puppies. His face had a look of sadness on it.</p><br/><p>However, because Zhao Zhong Yang couldn\u2019t understand dog speech, he had no idea that Elder Dog was complaining.</p><br/><p>\u201cGet out of my way, you puppies!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cArgh, don\u2019t bite that area!\u201d</p><br/><p>Now that he had puppies, Elder Dog couldn\u2019t be free anymore. He had to take care of these puppies before going out. It was really exhausting.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Lin Fan looked at his phone. There was a headline on Weibo.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe World English Singing Competition has officially begun. International superstars are waiting for you!\u201d</p><br/><p>When he saw this headline, he was a little curious, so he clicked on it.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is only one Chinese applicant as of now, and her name is Jin Can!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was curious about what this World English Singing Competition was about. But after taking a closer look, he understood. It was a global singing competition.</p><br/><p>But who was this Jin Can?</p><br/><p>She sounded unfamiliar. But thinking hard about it, he remembered she was a pretty good singer.</p><br/><p>However, he suddenly realized that something wasn\u2019t right. I haven\u2019t done anything at all! How did I get dragged into this?</p><br/><p>\u201cSigh, do we have no one else? Is Jin Can the only one who dares to sign up?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on with that Wu Huan Yue? Hasn\u2019t she received lots of awards recently? Then why isn\u2019t she joining a big competition like this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is an international competition. What would a Chinese singer do there? Sing acapella?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t she have Master Lin as her composer?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCheh, Master Lin can\u2019t do anything either. This isn\u2019t Chinese. Master Lin\u2019s English is terrible.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow would you know?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGo and take a look at the Weibo of this Internet celebrity. He has talked about it before.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was a little stunned when he saw this. What that person said was true, but saying it so bluntly wasn\u2019t very good, was it?</p><br/><p>Moreover, he had not done anything at all. They couldn\u2019t just talk about him like that. However, he still went to take a look at that Internet celebrity\u2019s account.</p><br/><p>That Internet celebrity\u2019s name was really complex. After looking at it for a long while, he still didn\u2019t understand what it meant. But there was a single post from that Internet celebrity that received many replies.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet me tell you guys about Master Lin\u2019s background. He graduated from a rubbish university. During his school days, he was taking basic English. Even after taking the exam twice, he didn\u2019t pass. And both times, his score was only twenty-something. On his last try, the teacher took pity on him and let him pass. If you ask him to write an English song, he would never be able to do it. It\u2019s just impossible.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan saw this post, he was dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s way too harsh, isn\u2019t it? How can he talk about my past like that as if he knows me?</p><br/><p>Isn\u2019t it normal to be bad at English? It\u2019s already difficult to be good at one language. And Chinese is really broad! It\u2019s not so easy to learn two languages at once!</p><br/><p>When he saw the comments below, Lin Fan couldn\u2019t take it anymore.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha. I\u2019m dying of laughter. This is the first time I\u2019ve heard of someone failing so many times. How bad must his English be?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, I never thought that the all-knowing Master Lin would fail his English exam. I have to go and ask about this on Master Lin\u2019s Weibo to see if it\u2019s really true!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBrothers, do you feel very proud just because you know English and Master Lin doesn\u2019t? Aren\u2019t you ashamed of digging up Master Lin\u2019s past?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, it seems like we can give up on Master Lin for this international singing competition. Without Master Lin, we\u2019re basically hopeless.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. Wu Huan Yue was able to become famous all because of Master Lin. Initially, I was waiting for Wu Huan Yue to get rid of Master Lin. I hated and envied Wu Huan Yue. But I didn\u2019t think that the two of them were so close. I am really talented, but I can\u2019t put my talents to good use because I don\u2019t have someone like Master Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan quickly went back to his own Weibo. Indeed, things had gotten out of hand. Many people were asking about that post on his Weibo. It really left him helpless.</p><br/><p>How the f*ck was he supposed to reply?</p><br/><p>He had never thought that someone would criticize him for this. Then, he thought about it and came up with an idea. It seemed that this was the only way.</p><br/><p>Very soon, he finished typing the reply and posted it.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere were too many courses. English is boring, so I neglected it. There\u2019s nothing wrong with that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although that reason was quite far-fetched, at least he had expressed his thoughts.</p><br/><p>In an instant, fans started commenting.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, I\u2019m dying of laughter. Maser Lin has been humiliated and is angry now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have to give in. I wouldn\u2019t give in to anyone else, but I give in to Master Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI feel like what Master Lin said makes sense. If he spent too much time learning English, he wouldn\u2019t have been able to cure so many diseases.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat Master Lin said is the truth. There are so many things to learn. Why would he learn English? It\u2019s better to learn something that would be of use to society.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI understand and support him, but it\u2019s a shame. With Master Lin\u2019s talents, if he knew English, he would be able to write amazing English songs. If he did that, Wu Huan Yue would definitely become the champion.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the comments and calmly accepted them. It seemed that there were still many people that could understand him.</p><br/><p>On Weibo.</p><br/><p>Jin Can posted a comment.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have the best composer who specializes in English songs. I believe I will really become famous. A truly great singer should not be limited to her country because that would prevent her from showing her true abilities.\u201d</p><br/><p>When this comment was posted, it instantly drew a large number of replies.</p><br/><p>\u201cI support you. I support you, Jin Can!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. You didn\u2019t get the prize last time, but you shouldn\u2019t be saddened. That Wu Huan Yue only relies on Master Lin\u2019s songs. I heard that Master Lin\u2019s English is terrible. Wu Huan Yue is hopeless this time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. I trust that Can Can will definitely win the competition.\u201d</p><br/><p>When some celebrities saw Jin Can\u2019s post, they wanted to \u2018like\u2019 it as well. But then, they decided not to.</p><br/><p>Although it hadn\u2019t been stated explicitly, it seemed like Jin Can was challenging Master Lin and Wu Huan Yue.</p><br/><p>Hence, for their own safety, they decided not to get involved. It was best to stay a spectator.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

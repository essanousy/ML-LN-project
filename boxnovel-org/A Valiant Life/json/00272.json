The renovation companies recommended by Chief Huang were very reliable and they were efficient too. They took one day to measure the rooms and by the second day, they produced a sketch of the plan. Once the owner was satisfied, they started the renovation, which was very fast as well.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan had chosen a shop of around thirty square meters. It wasn't small and was definitely enough for him to sell his scallion pancakes and do his fortune-telling.</p><br/><p>He wanted each day to be happy and to pass comfortably. Selling scallion pancakes and fortune-telling was secondary. Those were just so he could mix in with everyone else and enjoy some liveliness. At the same time, he could immerse the people in his scallion pancakes and leave them with no means of escape.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian and Zhao Zhong Yang didn't have much going on either. They just went to the shop each day to see the renovation and whenever something popped up, they would go and help to solve it.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan could see that everyone had high hopes for the new shop.</p><br/><p>Since they had moved to a new place, he also made a Weibo post to inform everyone that they had moved from Cloud Street to Tian Hong Commercial Street. On top of that, the Children's Welfare Institute was also closer to Tian Hong Commercial Street, which was another cause for joy.</p><br/><p>*Ring ring*</p><br/><p>A call from Wang Ming Yang came.</p><br/><p>Once he answered, Wang Ming Yang started chattering away, \"I'm hosting a salon tonight. Come here to support me.\"</p><br/><p>\"Salon?\" Lin Fan was startled, then he laughed, \"Sounds very high class.\"</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang laughed, \"High class my ass. It's just a gathering for f*cking awesome kings to shoot off their mouths together. I host one every month.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan didn't want to join. \"I think I'll pass. It's a gathering for you high-class people, why would I go?\"</p><br/><p>\"Cheh! What's so high class about it? It's just a private meeting. Everyone is friendly and familiar. Your shop is renovating anyway, so you have nothing much to do. If you don't come out for some fresh air, how boring would that be? Let me tell you this, there'll be lots of rich young ladies there,\" said Wang Ming Yang with a chuckle.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed as well, \"Alright, you're trying to tempt me, aren't you? But you've got the wrong person. Do you think I'm the type to fool around with someone?</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang laughed cheerily, \"Alright, alright. You're not that type of person, okay? Tonight, at six-thirty. I'll be waiting for you.\"</p><br/><p>\"Wait, I haven't agreed yet. What if I go there dressed too casually and make you lose face?\" said Lin Fan casually. He wasn't really bothered by these things at all.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang made a strange face. \"Have you been watching too much television? Everyone coming tonight is a friend and you're my closest brother. They wouldn't dare to look down on you. And if they really do dare, I'll turn hostile on them. Do this for my sake. I always brag in public about how I know this f*cking awesome guy. If you don't come, I'll be laughed at.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed. He didn't have much to do anyway, so he decided to just agree, \"Alright, alright, I'll come. It's just apt that I have to research something too. I'll use you all as my lab rats.\"</p><br/><p>\"As long as you come, we'll all be your lab rats,\" said Wang Ming Yang happily.</p><br/><p>\"Alright, remember what you said.\"</p><br/><p>After hanging up, Lin Fan looked at his current clothes. They were a little inappropriate. Although Wang Ming Yang said that it didn't matter, he had to change to some better clothes, otherwise, he would make Wang Ming Yang lose face.</p><br/><p>Evening time, six-thirty.</p><br/><p>Right on time. Not a second late or early.</p><br/><p>A Mercedes-Benz slowly entered Wang Ming Yang's villa. Compared to this car, all the other surrounding cars were not impressive.</p><br/><p>\"This way\u2026\"</p><br/><p>After Lin Fan got off the car, Wang Ming Yang stood there, beckoning him.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang smiled as he said, \"I've been here waiting for you for almost twenty minutes.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the time. \"Didn't you say six-thirty? I'm right on time, not even late one bit.\"</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang couldn't help it. He pulled Lin Fan along and said, \"Let's go in. I'll introduce you to my friends. They're really curious right now about just how f*cking awesome this guy I know is.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan had never thought that Wang Ming Yang liked bragging so much. How am I f*cking awesome? But since he said it, then let's just act as if I am.</p><br/><p>In the house.</p><br/><p>There was already quite a number of people. The crowd was gathered in groups of three or four, chatting with each other. They talked about everything from the North to the South, from the sky to the earth. They were talking enthusiastically, from business to daily gossip. Whatever there was to talk about, they talked about.</p><br/><p>*Clap clap*</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang clapped his hands twice and all the people in the house turned to face him. Wang Ming Yang placed a hand on Lin Fan's shoulder and said, \"Everybody, listen up. This is my best brother, Lin Fan, commonly addressed as Master Lin. Let me tell you all, this brother of mine is no average joe. Although he doesn't have huge wealth and money, his abilities are something you wouldn't even dare to imagine. Of course, I won't tell you what abilities he has. You can guess for yourselves. All I can say is that if you're lucky enough to get a few words of advice from this brother of mine, then you would be extremely blessed.\"</p><br/><p>The crowd was stunned. Then, someone laughed and said, \"Ming Yang, are you trying to play tricks on us? Any friend of yours is a friend of ours. If you talk about your friend like he's some god, won't he feel embarrassed?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yeah, I still remember when I first met Ming Yang. This guy exaggerated my abilities very highly too. In the end, I almost embarrassed myself because of that. That was something that I'll remember for life.\"</p><br/><p>Some of the daughters from wealthy families, on the other hand, were looking at Lin Fan with interest. This young man looked pretty good. He seemed clean and pure and even a little bit shy. Of course, these were just the thoughts of the young ladies.</p><br/><p>To some of the males, they had never thought that Wang Ming Yang would say in front of everyone that that was his best brother. This, of course, made them all surprised, because Wang Ming Yang had never said something like that about anyone before.</p><br/><p>At that moment, in the crowd, a young lady, who was dressed up nobly, smiled and said, \"Brother Ming Yang, your friend here looks so clean and pure. I like him. Would you mind doing a little introduction\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang chuckled, \"Sister Zhu Zhu, you shouldn't take my brother so lightly. He's an assassin in the field of love. He's very charming and if you fall into his hands, I won't be able to save you.\"</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan heard this, he instantly got pissed. Why did this guy have so much to say? Then, he slapped Wang Ming Yang's stomach lightly and said, \"You talk too much. No one will think you're mute if you don't talk, you know?\"</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang's body curled slightly, then he burst out laughing, \"Alright, alright. Enough with the jokes. But really, what I said before was 99% true. Alright, our monthly Salon Night officially begins! Let's have some applause to welcome my brother!\"</p><br/><p>The crowd started laughing and clapping. This applause was just as a sign of respect for Wang Ming Yang. As for Lin Fan, they didn't bear any ill feelings towards him, but nor did they feel particularly interested in him.</p><br/><p>But just because he was Wang Ming Yang's best friend, they had to clap to give Wang Ming Yang some face.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang said, \"Come and play with me?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the surrounding individuals and his eyes gleamed. He waved his hand and said, \"You go where you need to. I have to research my thing.\"</p><br/><p>\"Alright, then I'll be going. I haven't played cards in a long time. Now that all my friends are here, I'm going to have some fun,\" Wang Ming Yang laughed.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was startled for a moment, then he came back to his senses. God d*mn! Seeing Wang Ming Yang's excited expression, he finally realized that the Encyclopedia wasn't kidding when it said that Wang Ming Yang like to gamble.</p><br/><p>After Wang Ming Yang left, Lin Fan found a place to sit down. Then, he gazed at people one by one, carefully studying them.</p><br/><p>What he was researching was the metaphysical analysis of a person's facial structure. In layman's terms, judging one by his or her facial features.</p><br/><p>Ever since he had gotten the fortune-telling class of knowledge, he had judged many people's facial features but he had never had many cases of rich and wealthy people. Now that all these wealthy people were before him, he could do a proper research on them.</p><br/><p>A pair of judgemental eyes swept the whole guest room. Some people felt their a*sholes tighten as if someone was spying on them.</p><br/><p>...</p><br/>\n</div>"}

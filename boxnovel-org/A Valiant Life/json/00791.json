She looked at Lin Fan and teased him.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at Liu Xu, \u201cThe northwestern wind has blown me here. Will that do?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSure. Regardless of whether it\u2019s the northwestern or northeastern wind, you\u2019re considered to be a guest after you enter the hotel. What services do you require?\u201d Liu Xu didn\u2019t really have anything against Lin Fan. She was just a little unhappy. She felt as if she was the pretty boy that got trolled by a charlatan.</p><br/><p>However, she felt that being a lady was great. She was already used to being a beautiful lady. At the same time, she wasn\u2019t really interested in other girls anymore. Her attitude had changed.</p><br/><p>\u201cSister Liu,\u201d Wu You Lan smiled and went forward. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you come to Cloud Street to look for me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Xu replied, \u201cI\u2019ve been busy and the Lunar New Year is almost here. It\u2019s a busy period.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cI\u2019m here for a meal. Please prepare a room for us.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan and Liu Xu chatted for a moment. Then, she looked at Lin Fan, \u201cWill you be paying for the meal?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled, \u201cYou sound as if I don\u2019t usually pay for my meals.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Xu was really feminine and sexy. She asked a waiter to come over and said, \u201cBring the guests to a ballroom.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Chief Liu,\u201d the waiter nodded. They were really impressed by Chief Liu. They felt that she was a woman with a successful career. Furthermore, she was really pretty. They wondered which man would have the luck to marry someone like Chief Liu.</p><br/><p>They were just thinking about it randomly and they didn\u2019t dare to fantasize about it coming true.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Outside.</p><br/><p>The shop owners were discussing.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Liang, how much should we give in the red packet?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I prepared $2000. What about you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDoes anyone have any objection?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNope. None at all. Usually, Little Boss would treat us to meals and help us with our daily things. It\u2019s almost the Lunar New Year and we really have to thank Little Boss.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, let\u2019s give $2000 each then. We can say that it\u2019s a celebratory gift for Elder Dog\u2019s new puppies too.\u201d</p><br/><p>The shop owners had already planned that in private.</p><br/><p>They wanted to give Little Boss red packets before the Lunar New Year.</p><br/><p>Although $2000 wasn\u2019t a lot, it was the thought that counted.</p><br/><p>Of course, if they were to compare the favor that they owed Little Boss, $2000 definitely wasn\u2019t enough. However, they just wanted to show that they cared.</p><br/><p>In the ballroom.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan asked, \u201cWhy aren\u2019t they here yet?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang replied, \u201cThey should be on the way. Just wait for a while.\u201d</p><br/><p>The speak of the devil.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Boss, we\u2019re here!\u201d The shop owners had arrived.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled, \u201cWhat took all of you so long? We\u2019ve been waiting for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha.\u201d Elder Liang went forward and took out a red packet from his pocket. \u201cLittle Boss, I\u2019m wishing you a happy Lunar New Year in advance.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan immediately pushed the red packet back to him. \u201cWait, what do you mean by that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing much. The Lunar New Year is almost here and Elder Dog just had new puppies. We\u2019re really happy.\u201d Elder Liang wanted to stuff the red packet into Lin Fan\u2019s hands but Lin Fan didn\u2019t want to accept it.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s pointless. This red packet is pretty thick. I think it contains at least $2000, right? If all of you were to give me red packets, then we should forget about this dinner. Let\u2019s just go back to our own homes for dinner, alright?\u201d Lin Fan knew what they were thinking but he wasn\u2019t going to accept it.</p><br/><p>Obviously, he wouldn\u2019t accept it.</p><br/><p>After interacting with them for about six months, they had fostered good relationships and there was no need for formalities.</p><br/><p>Elder Chen went forward, \u201cLittle Boss. Please accept it. We\u2019ve discussed it in advance. Look, you saved my son and you\u2019re the reason why our business is so good. If you don\u2019t accept it, we\u2019ll feel bad.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, what Elder Chen said is true.\u201d</p><br/><p>After hearing what they said, Lin Fan waved his hand, \u201cIf I were to accept your money, I would feel bad. Fine, I can accept the money and we can go back home. If not, please keep the money and we can eat a nice meal. Then, we can have another nice dinner next year. You can make a decision.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2026\u201d They were in a dilemma. \u201cLittle Boss, you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>All of them were willing to give him money. They had received a lot of blessing for the past six months. Master Lin was the main reason for Cloud Street\u2019s prosperity. They just wanted to show their appreciation.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cKeep the money. There\u2019s no need for formalities. It\u2019s fate that we\u2019ve met. Now that we have good relationships, we should treasure it. I\u2019m not the only reason why Cloud Street is doing so well now. All of you had a part to play.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang added, \u201cWhat Brother Lin said is right. Everyone, keep your money. We\u2019re really hungry.\u201d</p><br/><p>The crowd looked at them helplessly.</p><br/><p>\u201cFine, we won\u2019t give money then.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan smiled, \u201cThat\u2019s right. We\u2019re all neighbors. We should help one another when we face difficulties. If money is involved, things would be different. If you were to think about giving me money again, I will be moving out of Cloud Street.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo! Everyone, please keep the money now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Boss, you can\u2019t leave. If you were to leave, where do we go?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, yeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Lin Fan chuckled. Then, he asked the waiter to start serving the dishes. \u201cCome, let\u2019s have a toast. I wish everyone a prosperous business and achieve their goals.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCheers!\u201d</p><br/><p>The shop owners raised the cups and toasted each other. Then, they finished it in one gulp.</p><br/><p>Of course, they were drinking non-alcoholic beverages. After all, they still had to drive home.</p><br/><p>However, those that didn\u2019t drive naturally drank wine.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>They were really full from the alcohol and food and everyone started to brag.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan needed to go to the toilet badly and he left the room.</p><br/><p>At that moment, he saw Liu Xu smoking in a corner.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said, \u201cChief Liu, you\u2019re smoking? Smoking will cause you to have bad breath.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Xu glanced at Lin Fan, \u201cIt\u2019s an e-cigarette. Do you know what that is?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s still a cigarette. It\u2019s the same,\u201d Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>Liu Xu just looked away. She didn\u2019t really care about what he said. Then, it was as if she thought of something. She immediately said, \u201cWait.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah? What is it, Chief Liu?\u201d Lin Fan asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cI would like your help. My family found me a matchmaking partner. I would like you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Even before Liu Xu finished her sentence, Lin Fan looked at Liu Xu weirdly, \u201cDid you fall for me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Xu was stunned, \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat else? Are you asking me to pretend to be your boyfriend and follow you home? Then, you\u2019re going to do something dirty to me and tie me down, right? That\u2019s impossible. I\u2019m not that stupid,\u201d Lin Fan acted as if he knew what she was trying to do.</p><br/><p>She lowered the hand that was holding the e-cigarette. She was stunned. Then, she blushed.</p><br/><p>\u201cGet lost. Pretend I\u2019ve never seen you before.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan shook his head and left. \u201cStop smoking. Look at your teeth. They\u2019ve turned yellow.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour sister is yellow.\u201d Liu Xu puffed up her chest and was fuming. There was a mirror decoration in front of her and she looked at it. Her teeth were snowy white. They weren\u2019t yellow at all.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p></div>\n</div>"}

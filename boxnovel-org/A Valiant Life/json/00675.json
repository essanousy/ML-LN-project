He has gone a long time without rest, can he endure this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tao Shi Gang was also worried about this, replying, \u201cI don\u2019t know. Even so, what can we do about it? If we were to go in, the consequences\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Zheng Zhong Shan replied, \u201cI\u2019m aware of that. Elder Lin has been painting for so long which probably means that the painting is extremely difficult. It is definitely not going to be like the previous ones. However, if something happens to Elder Lin because of that, I would not be able to take it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tao Shi Gang was silent for a brief moment and said, \u201cHow about we wait awhile more? If he is still not done, we tell him to stop painting. The painting is secondary, health comes first.\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Zheng nodded, \u201cYeah, that sounds good.\u201d</p><br/><p>3 pm in the afternoon.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan still had not stopped. Also, in this long period of time, he did not take a single sip of water. How could he possibly endure this?</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m going in,\u201d Elder Zheng did not give it a second thought. He could not let Elder Lin keep painting. Otherwise, something might happen to him in the end.</p><br/><p>This was something that had happened before. Pouring in their blood, sweat, and tears into their art and when their art is done, in an instant they just suddenly die. According to a theory, it is because they poured their entire spirit into their artwork and the moment they finish their artwork, they relax their body and as a result, it just falls apart.</p><br/><p>Creak!</p><br/><p>The door was gently pushed open. Elder Zheng was very light with his movements so as to not disturb Elder Lin.</p><br/><p>However, the moment he took his first steps inside, he stopped.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Zheng, don\u2019t disturb me, I\u2019m fine,\u201d Lin Fan finished his sentence and then did not say another word. His entire focus was locked onto the canvas.</p><br/><p>Zheng Zhong Shan stood there and hesitated for a long moment. Then, he started to retrace his steps and closed the door. He shook his head and looked at everyone saying, \u201cElder Lin does not want to be disturbed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis\u2026\u201d Tao Shi Gang was perplexed.</p><br/><p>\u201cGo, call an ambulance. When Elder Lin is done with the painting, we must guarantee that nothing happens to him,\u201d Zheng Zhong Shan instructed.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Tao Shi Gang nodded and said. Then, he got into action.</p><br/><p>The association members looked like they had seen a ghost. They had never thought that there would actually be someone like this in this world.</p><br/><p>If they had been filled with anticipation before, it was now replaced with fear.</p><br/><p>Painting for such a long time, how could he endure this?</p><br/><p>At this moment, one of the members whispered into Zheng Zhong Shan\u2019s ear.</p><br/><p>\u201cPresident, some of the leaders are coming over to the association to visit today. What should we do?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zheng Zhong Shan did not have time to care about this. He waved him off and said, \u201cAsk them to quickly go back. Until Elder Lin is done, the association will not be entertaining any visits.\u201d</p><br/><p>If anyone else said this type of words, it would not be acceptable. However, he knew what kind of person the president was so he did not say a thing. He then went to tell them to leave.</p><br/><p>The entrance to the association.</p><br/><p>A few black-colored government vehicles were parked there.</p><br/><p>A leader was seated inside a car. When he saw the entrance to the association, he was very curious. He had no idea what had happened. Why was the Chinese Art Association entrance sealed off? It had not been like this before.</p><br/><p>One of the leaders laughed and said, \u201cChinese Art is our nation\u2019s heritage. The art exhibition this time around may not be an important thing but we will be able to see that old leader.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true. To be able to invite that old leader to bring his painting and hang it in our house for our collection, it is something amazing.\u201d</p><br/><p>However, these few men did not talk for long before an association member came by.</p><br/><p>\u201cEsteemed leaders, I\u2019m really sorry. Our president has some things to handle and the association will not be hosting any visits. Also, he sent me to inform you that you cannot visit today.\u201d</p><br/><p>When these leaders heard these words, they were momentarily dazed. It was like they had no reaction at all. If anyone else had said this to them, they would be angry. But since it was the words of Elder Zheng, they dare not go against it.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up with Elder Zheng? Did something happen to him?\u201d This leader was still unwilling to give up. He wanted to ask what was going on. If there were any issues, he would be very willing to help out.</p><br/><p>\u201cOur association\u2019s number one master is painting now. Elder Zheng has no time to receive you guys as well as he does not want any distractions,\u201d the member replied.</p><br/><p>The leader heard this and was momentarily delighted, \u201cComrade, if it is like that, then why don\u2019t you just let us in? We also have a love for Chinese Art so you can let us take a look as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>If it were any other artist, it would not be a problem. But this was Master Lin who was painting so the situation was vastly different. If he let these people in and the president blamed him, it would be very unlucky for him. So he decided to just reject them.</p><br/><p>\u201cDear leaders, I\u2019m very sorry. The president has given his orders. We are not to accept any outsiders into the association today,\u201d the association member said with a serious tone.</p><br/><p>The leaders were dumbfounded. What was this? Even going and taking a look was not allowed?</p><br/><p>However, they were powerless to do anything.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Inside the art studio.</p><br/><p>Zheng Zhong Shan swallowed his saliva. Everyone was waiting. This was the first time that they had felt such a heavy atmosphere.</p><br/><p>The ambulance had arrived.</p><br/><p>The doctors and nurses were all waiting. This was the Chinese Art Association, so although they had no idea what the situation was, they just patiently waited.</p><br/><p>Inside the studio.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was still absorbed in his painting. He did not dare to make any mistakes at all.</p><br/><p>According to the encyclopedia, the \u2018Pure Brightness on the River Painting\u2019 would take a year to finish. Right now, he was trying to do it in a very short amount of time and also do it better than the encyclopedia. The amount of energy and focus required was immense.</p><br/><p>It was nighttime once again.</p><br/><p>Everyone could not take it anymore.</p><br/><p>They were already at their limits. One day and one night were easy. But two days and two nights were causing some people to collapse already.</p><br/><p>The morning of day 3.</p><br/><p>Creak!</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was slightly exhausted. When he saw that everyone outside was all sleeping on the floor, he could not help laughing. He realized that he was very hungry and needed something to eat.</p><br/><p>Without waking them up, he left the area.</p><br/><p>When he saw the ambulance, he laughed. What was going on? Were they scared that he would die?</p><br/><p>After an unknown amount of time.</p><br/><p>Some of them faintly woke up. They started to think that Master Lin could not possibly still be painting.</p><br/><p>However, when they saw that the room was devoid of life, they were flabbergasted.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin is gone.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPresident, President, Master Lin is gone.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zheng Zhong Shan and the rest of them woke up. When they realized that Lin Fan was gone, they were also shocked for a moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. Elder Lin must have finished already and left. Why are you guys all sleeping?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe were too tired. We could not endure further.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Lin must have gone to rest so we should just contact him later. Let\u2019s go in and take a look.\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, everyone held their breath. They took heavy steps as they walked into the studio.</p><br/><p>The painting was just quietly lying there. But to all of them, it drew them in with so much power.</p><br/><p>Everyone wanted to know what the painting was like. What kind of earth-shattering work would it be?</p><br/><p>Zheng Zhong Shan could not wait anymore. When his eyes glanced onto the canvas, his pupils suddenly shrunk and he started to hyperventilate.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis\u2026 this\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Zheng Zhong Shan put a hand on his heart and felt that his heartbeat was really very quick.</p><br/><p>As he looked at it, he only had one feeling.</p><br/><p>Shock!</p><br/><p>When he carefully looked at it, he realized that this painting\u2019s content was extremely abundant and would be hard for anyone to comprehend.</p><br/><p>This was an earth-shattering piece of work!</p><br/><p>A national treasure!</p><br/><p>Priceless!</p><br/><p>This was a painting that would never appear ever again.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, a cry of alarm came.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot good. Elder Wang was too excited and his heart disease was triggered. Where is the doctor?\u201d</p><br/><p>Initially, their tolerance had been raised by quite a lot already. However, after seeing this painting, in a split second, they realized that they had been wrong.</p><br/><p>This earth-shattering artwork completely destroyed all of that.</p><br/><p>It could be called:</p><br/><p>A godly piece of art!</p><br/><p>The greatest in history!</p><br/><p>The ambulance had initially been called for Master Lin, but it turned out that they were the ones who needed it.</p><br/><p>Also, the doctors and nurses were in complete disbelief that someone could get a heart attack from seeing a painting.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

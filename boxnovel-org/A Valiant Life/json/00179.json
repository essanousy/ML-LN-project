The air was fresh.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan had enraged the beast. The ten over angry celebrities had reported Lin Fan's doing.</p><br/><p>\"666\u2026 Who is this Master Lin? How can he do this? Where does his bravery come from?\"</p><br/><p>\"He really is a madman. I would never have imagined that such a matter would be reported on media.\"</p><br/><p>\"Who are these two b*stards that Master Lin mentioned?\"</p><br/><p>\"The person above, you just need to search the Internet for their names, then you'll understand. Some news websites still have information on them.\"</p><br/><p>\"I can't believe it! I just searched it up. Since when did such a thing happen? How could I not have known anything about it?\"</p><br/><p>\"These motherf*ckers really are b*stards. However, what does this have to do with those celebrities?\"</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>This topic had burst open again. It had not mentioned anything about Starlight Film School. However, all these discussions made the observant netizens curious. They didn't know who these two b*stards represented.</p><br/><p>Once they searched the matter up, they were in for a huge shock. How could such a thing happen? By following the different news channels, they gathered various news regarding this. Some of them were trusting, yet skeptical, not knowing the truth behind the issue. However, there were still some that stood by Starlight Film School.</p><br/><p>After all, Starlight Film School already had enough evidence to prove that Xia Yi Mo indeed had a problem.</p><br/><p>Jiang Li had also released a video involving Xia Yi Mo's father to provide proof of the situation, hence many netizens still believed Starlight Film School and thought that Master Lin was crazy.</p><br/><p>These ten over celebrities could practically hold up half the sky. Yet, there was still someone that dared scold them for no rhyme or reason. This naturally upset lots of fans.</p><br/><p>On the web forums.</p><br/><p>\"Do you guys know what happened yesterday? Lin Fan is practically seeking death.\"</p><br/><p>\"Hehe, this guy is someone who goes crazy whenever he wants. He even wants to put his foot into this matter concerning Starlight Film School. He didn't want to believe the truth even after it had been revealed, but he still started flaming these celebrities. Won't you say he's gone mad?\"</p><br/><p>\"I see so many people like this these days. When they want to get famous, there's nothing they won't dare to do.\"</p><br/><p>\"These ten over celebrities are already preparing to sue Master Lin. It'd be best if they sue him till he dies so that he would stay away from the Internet. Save the Internet another vermin.\"</p><br/><p>\"Supported. Agreed.\"</p><br/><p>Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>A lady owner, who was holding hands with a little girl, arrived. \"Little Boss, regarding the incident on the Internet, you mustn't provoke it anymore.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed, \"Thank you for your concern. I am well aware of the situation.\"</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian laughed, \"Little Sister Hong, your daughter is very cute.\"</p><br/><p>The little girl, who was standing behind the lady boss, was looking at the people inside the shop. After which, she went to hide behind her mother's back.</p><br/><p>The lady boss twitched her lips. \"I'm older than you, so you have to address me as Big Sister Hong.\"</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian laughed. He looked for the little girl. \"Come here, sweet girl.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan jokingly said, \"You're too scary. Being a little kid, she wouldn't dare to go near you.\"</p><br/><p>Sister Hong clapped her hands. \"I have to go first. I need to send my child to school.\"</p><br/><p>After Sister Hong left, Fraud Tian laughed out loud. \"Little Sister Hong is rather capable. She's already so old, yet she's still able to have a second pregnancy.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed along with him. He decided to check Weibo. His own Weibo had been taken over by spammers. Scrolling downwards, all the posts were filled with curses. It was simply frightening.</p><br/><p>His act of flaming the celebrities the day before was on the trending page. Although most of the discussion was just netizens scolding him, none of it mattered now. He had already achieved his goal of catching the attention of more netizens.</p><br/><p>All he needed to do was wait for the right moment to strike.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Jiang Li released a statement.</p><br/><p>Jiang Li: \"In view of matters regarding Master Lin, because he is unable to prove his words, he has heavily damaged the reputation of Professor Chen Juan. Therefore, we have already lodged a report to the court of law with the relevant evidence\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"Good! I support Professor Jiang.\"</p><br/><p>\"Such people should pay for their acts. Because of people like this, the Internet is so toxic.\"</p><br/><p>\"Support +1.\"</p><br/><p>\"Professor Jiang and Professor Chen are both people with good morals and are highly respectable. People of such lowly caliber aren't worthy of slandering them.\"</p><br/><p>\"There are too many people that want to get famous. However, it's really a first seeing such a shameless person.\"</p><br/><p>The popular celebrity Yang Yue Chen also released a statement which stated that she would unconditionally support Professor Jiang and Professor Chen.</p><br/><p>At the same time, there were many celebrities who re-posted Professor Jiang's Weibo, showing their stand.</p><br/><p>This topic was getting hotter and hotter, gaining the attention of many more people.</p><br/><p>Most of the netizens were in support of Professor Jiang.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Lin Fan's side wasn't looking too good.</p><br/><p>\"I've stopped following him. I used to be pretty fond of Master Lin. However, now he's just a clown who likes to cause trouble without rhyme or reason.\"</p><br/><p>\"+1, stop following! Let him spam by himself. Let's see how long more he will continue to spam if no one cares about him.\"</p><br/><p>\"Hehe, that's really funny. So he wanted to get famous.\"</p><br/><p>\"Thinking about all his past doings, he probably collaborated with others just to gain our attention.\"</p><br/><p>\"Guys, don't be like that. Master Lin isn't that kind of person.\"</p><br/><p>\"If he isn't this kind of a person, then what kind of person is he?\"</p><br/><p>\"I'm utterly disappointed. Who knew that Master Lin would turn out like that?\"</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>Lin Fan had been pushed into the heart of the storm, getting scolded by all sides, with everyone hating on him.</p><br/><p>However, none of this even bothered Lin Fan a single bit. What he had wanted to come had come. As for now, he wanted to let the storm rage on for a little while longer.</p><br/><p>Qi Yi Weibo.</p><br/><p>\"Master Lin has pissed off many people on Weibo. Should his Weibo account be blocked?\"</p><br/><p>The person-in-charge replied, \"There is no need to block his account. We can't touch his account.\"</p><br/><p>The employees at Weibo were all stunned. They had never thought that someone could ever cause such a huge fuss. It was like a once in a lifetime situation.</p><br/><p>It wasn't like such an event had not happened on Weibo before, but rather, it hadn't been to such a huge extent. This time, Master Lin had enraged a bunch of celebrities as well. It was as good as seeking death.</p><br/><p>Noontime.</p><br/><p>Master Lin hadn't replied a single post. Everyone thought that he had already backed out of Weibo, or that he was so scared that he went into hiding.</p><br/><p>After all, the celebrities were getting ready to file a lawsuit. With so many celebrities suing him, there wouldn't just be a typical outcome.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan's number of followers on Weibo was beginning to look miserable. In a short span of a few hours, he had lost almost two hundred thousand followers.</p><br/><p>For others, if they were to kick up a fuss, the more they did it, the hotter they would become. This was because, in order to join in the discussion, people had to follow the user first.</p><br/><p>However, for Lin Fan, he didn't turn on this setting. As a result, the discussion count was much higher than his followers count.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan worriedly asked, \"Master Lin, are you really not anxious at all?\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan looked at the time. \"What's there to be anxious about. It has just started. But it is about time for me to make my move.\"</p><br/><p>At this moment, after a span of 10 over hours, his first Weibo post appeared.</p><br/><p>\"Last night, I downloaded two movies. They were supposed to be sexy, but I didn't expect that it would be\u2026\"</p><br/><p>The Weibo was posted together with the two videos.</p><br/><p>The moment the Weibo was posted, discussions started flying about.</p><br/><p>\"Fools, what a bunch of fools.\"</p><br/><p>\"Master Lin, we have all wronged you\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"Master Lin, how f*cking disgusting can you be?\"</p><br/><p>The discussions rose very quickly.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, at this moment, all the comments stopped. It was as if they had pre-planned this.</p><br/><p>It was like everyone had disappeared.</p><br/><p>As for Lin Fan, he knew that he had already done what was needed to be done. Whatever happened after this was no business of his.</p><br/><p>Inside the shop.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan played the videos. Her initial curious expression suddenly changed...</p><br/>\n</div>"}

These Leukemia sufferers, upon seeing the news, all rushed to find a hospital, hoping that they would get chosen by Master Lin.</p><br/><p>A few of the hospitals felt like this was a major headache. This situation had very little to do with them so they were very angry at Master Lin\u2019s actions in shifting the responsibility to them.</p><br/><p>There were only ten pills available. How in the world were they supposed to choose the ten most severe cases?</p><br/><p>However, right now, this was none of Master Lin\u2019s business. It was all on the hospitals now.</p><br/><p>Shanghai Chinese Medical Academy.</p><br/><p>Upon seeing the small mountain of ingredients that was building up in front of them, Lin Fan and Zhao Zhong Yang started tidying it up. However, when they started their research, these ingredients would be consumed at a very fast pace anyway.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-2\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, what is our preliminary direction going to be?\u201d Zhao Zhong Yang asked. When developing a prescription, the most difficult part was to determine which direction to go by.</p><br/><p>Also, there was a lot of Chinese medicine over there. Thus, coming up with an appropriate mixture in order to develop the prescription was definitely not going to be easy.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan pondered over it for a moment and replied, \u201cLet me think. This type of prescription is very different from the normal kind. I\u2019m afraid we\u2019ll have to go down a very different path.\u201d</p><br/><p>The pill he had created had only had such a great effect because of the Encyclopedia\u2019s mythical boost. After all, in this world without any spiritual energy, it would not be possible to make a pill with such a drastic effect.</p><br/><p>However, right now, developing a prescription was not going to be that easy.</p><br/><p>He was not relying on any spiritual energy or the Encyclopedia\u2019s mythical boost but was genuinely relying on the mutual interaction of the ingredients to develop the cure for Leukemia.</p><br/><p>The process was definitely going to be very complicated.</p><br/><p>\u201cMing Qing, you should also think about it. If it were up to you, how would you mix the ingredients?\u201d Lin Fan said.</p><br/><p>Zhao Ming Qing nodded. \u201cOkay, got it, Teacher.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan himself was extremely familiar with all the ingredients. His knowledge of how the ingredients interacted with each other was incomparable. However, Zhao Ming Qing did not have his level of understanding. Thus, if he were to think about it as well, he would be able to better follow Lin Fan\u2019s train of thought.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-3\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Even if he were to fail, when Lin Fan found the prescription, Zhao Ming Qing would be able to understand what he was lacking as well as what he overlooked.</p><br/><p>Through this method of learning, he would improve the fastest.</p><br/><p>Into the night.</p><br/><p>No one knew what was going on in the research room. However, from the moment Master Lin and Zhao Ming Qing had entered the room, they had not come out at all. Every single student was filled with curiosity, all wanting to know how far they had gone in their development.</p><br/><p>The reporters were also camping at the Chinese Medical Academy, all wanting to get first-hand information. However, they were not able to get an interview with them. Even so, they did not give up.</p><br/><p>A certain TV station\u2019s late night show.</p><br/><p>\u2018Society\u2019s Trends\u2019</p><br/><p>Even TV stations were taking this opportunity to give live commentaries of the situation.</p><br/><p>Also, this TV show had drawn in quite a number of viewers. As long as it was related to Lin Fan\u2019s current situation, the netizens would all pay attention to it. They all wanted to know what these experts had to say about this situation.</p><br/><p>The host: \u201cLet us welcome Professor Zhang and Professor Li. These two professors are big shots in the world of medicine. Now, let me ask, what do you guys understand about what happened yesterday?\u201d</p><br/><p>Professor Zhang: \u201cYou\u2019re referring to Master Lin developing a cure for Leukemia, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>The host: \u201cYes.\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-4\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>Professor Zhang: \u201cWith regards to this, I feel that it is complete and utter nonsense. I\u2019m afraid that this Master Lin has no idea about how Leukemia takes shape. The probability of him being able to cure it with Chinese medicine is 0.\u201d</p><br/><p>The host: \u201cProfessor Li, what do you think?\u201d</p><br/><p>Professor Li: \u201cBefore I comment on this, I want to ask something. Where in the world did this Master Lin come out from? I\u2019ve never heard of someone so young claiming to be so proficient at medicine. Could it be that he has never heard of the phrase \u2018There is no limit to what one can learn\u2019?</p><br/><p>The host had initially been very calm. However, after hearing that, his facial expression turned dark.</p><br/><p>He was actually one of Master Lin\u2019s fanboys. Initially, he had hoped to hear words of flattery for his idol from the mouths of these top professors. He had never thought that he would actually be hearing all of this.</p><br/><p>However, he was still in the middle of a show so he had to control the anger that was burning inside him.</p><br/><p>The host: Professor Li, I see that you\u2019ve never read about Master Lin before. However, if you do a search of him online, you will see all sorts of things that Master Lin has done. One of the things he has done is develop a pill to cure anorexia. Also, he has done a lot of volunteer healthcare work, seeing and curing many patients. Thus, with regards to your question, I\u2019ll have to disagree, Master Lin is a very capable person.\u201d</p><br/><p>Many of the viewers, upon seeing this, cried out in praise.</p><br/><p>\u201c666\u2026 what era is this Professor Li from? To not even know about Master Lin. Why was he even invited to be on such a TV show? He\u2019s a blind person trying to stir trouble.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, definitely seems like this host is a Master Lin fanboy. The moment this man with the surname Li said something bad about Master Lin, his whole face turned black.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, however, do you guys think that he will be successful in his development? Why do I have a bad feeling about this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCutting out the bullsh*t, I think he has at best a 50-50 chance.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere was literally no point in you stating that. However, I still believe in him. Master Lin is so crafty. At times, you can\u2019t use normal logic to evaluate him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAccording to the latest news reports, Master Lin and his student have already been researching for one whole day. As for how much progress he has made, we still have no idea.\u201d</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-5\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\"></div><br/><p>\u201cOkay, this is just bullsh*t. I\u2019m just saying, if he can really develop a prescription, I\u2019ll kneel in front of him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The next day.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan and Zhao Ming Qing were still conducting their research.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, look at the prescription I\u2019ve come up with. Do you think it will work?\u201d Zhao Ming Qing had been racking his brain, thinking of how the ingredients would work together and finally coming up with a recipe he was happy with. However, whether it would work or not, he really did not know.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan grabbed the prescription and carefully looked at it. Then, he shook his head. \u201cIt won\u2019t work. You\u2019ve only considered the characteristics of each ingredient. However, when the ingredients come together, they will go through a huge change. You have to take note of the characteristics of all the ingredients as well their characteristics after they are mixed together.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGot it, Teacher.\u201d Zhao Ming Qing nodded. After using the perfect-grade little intelligence pill, his brain was very active and understood everything Lin Fan said instantly.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan already had a rough idea of what he wanted to do. However, he did not have a concrete prescription. He still had to see how the ingredients would do after they were boiled together.</p><br/><p>However, with regards to curing Leukemia, he already felt like he had a good chance of developing a prescription. All he needed was time. He had to slowly conduct his tests but overall, there weren\u2019t too many problems.</p><br/><p>After doing some work, he unlocked his phone to see the situation online.</p><br/><p>However, when he looked online and saw quite a few medical experts coming out and saying that it was not possible, he felt a little upset in his little heart.</p><br/><p>Then, he opened his Weibo and made a post.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan: \u201cTo all you medical experts, please watch what you say. You don\u2019t want to end up with a red face when this is all over.\u201d</p><br/><p>When this post was made, all the netizens replied in an instant.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, go and develop your prescription.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, go and develop your prescription.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>When he saw that the whole comments section was flooded with this comment, he felt a little helpless.</p></div>\n</div>"}

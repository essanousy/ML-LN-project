It was as if he had been resurrected. He was back to his bubbly self.</p><br/><p>Especially when Yue Qiu Ju Shi went to hug Lin Fan like a little child just when he saw him, it was a little off-putting.</p><br/><p>Tao Shi Gang didn\u2019t know why Master Lin had taken those two artworks out but since the \u2018Hundred birds\u2019 artwork was back, Brother Yue Qiu was back to his happy self. He didn\u2019t mind it anymore.</p><br/><p>As for the art exhibition, he didn\u2019t want to display it anymore. If he wanted to do so, he would have to strengthen the security measures and protect it.</p><br/><p>Since something had happened, the art exhibition couldn\u2019t continue anymore. However, to Yue Qiu Ju Shi, the luckiest thing to happen was to be reunited with that artwork.</p><br/><p>The policemen came to investigate the crime scene and realized that it was a team of professional burglars. They traced it back to their recent few burglaries and they were exactly the same. They felt that they had probably been done by the same people.</p><br/><p>However, Lin Fan wasn\u2019t bothered by it. He believed in karma. If he had exposed them earlier, then this case wouldn\u2019t have happened. However, that would also mean that Jin Xuan Ming wouldn\u2019t have been kicked by the burglar.</p><br/><p>Therefore, he decided to just wait it out and see how things went.</p><br/><p>Then, Lin Fan took out his phone and posted on Weibo.</p><br/><p>\u201cAwesome, I feel so awesome. It\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve felt this way.\u201d</p><br/><p>The netizens were puzzled by the comment. Meanwhile, Jin Xuan Ming\u2019s stupid fans were still scolding him on Weibo. Lin Fan immediately closed the Weibo app. The bunch of idiots would probably be crying over their idol tomorrow.</p><br/><p>As for Yue Qiu Ju Shi, he didn\u2019t want to pursue this matter any further since the artwork was back. He didn\u2019t want to ask any more about it. As for the two artworks that Master Lin had taken, he didn\u2019t ask anything, neither did he want to talk to the policemen.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, the building opposite seemed to have another incident. The Korean celebrity had been kicked by a burglar and was in a coma. The police were also there to help.</p><br/><p>This matter was a huge one but the news hadn\u2019t spread to the public yet.</p><br/><p>The reporters rushed there but the area had already been cordoned off. Jin Xuan Ming was sent to the hospital and the reporters didn\u2019t manage to get any juicy news. Then, they just headed to the hospital to get the latest news.</p><br/><p>To them, Jin Xuan Ming going into a coma was a big piece of news. If it were reported, it would definitely blow up.</p><br/><p>All the way through the night.</p><br/><p>The reporters camped there but they didn\u2019t know what was going on.</p><br/><p>Then, a doctor came out.</p><br/><p>The reporters immediately rushed towards him.</p><br/><p>\u201cHi, doctor, may I know Jin Xuan Ming\u2019s condition?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs his life in danger?\u201d</p><br/><p>The doctor had been about to go for his meal but was stunned after being surrounded by reporters. He was a little taken aback but he loved to entertain questions like these. Hence, he neatened his attire and looked at them.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you asking me?\u201d the doctor asked.</p><br/><p>The reporter nodded. \u201cDoctor, Jin Xuan Ming is a Korean celebrity. Today, he was attacked at the performance hall. According to the live witnesses, Jin Xuan Ming was carried out on a stretcher. May I know his condition?\u201d</p><br/><p>The doctor looked at the reporters and shook his head. Then, he sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s extremely serious.\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporter asked, \u201cHow serious is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>The doctor said, \u201cHis face is badly disfigured.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe has a lot of injuries on his body.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI think his private part is probably useless now\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The doctor was revealing all the details but he suddenly saw the director. Then, his face changed and he moved away from the reporters.</p><br/><p>Then, the reporters were still standing there, trying to digest what the doctor had just said.</p><br/><p>Didn\u2019t \u2018disfigured face\u2019 mean that his good looks were finished?</p><br/><p>\u2018A lot of injuries sustained to his body\u2019 would also mean that it was serious. Perhaps he could even be paralyzed from the bottom down.</p><br/><p>And the last sentence was even worse. That probably meant that he had become a eunuch.</p><br/><p>D*mn!</p><br/><p>It was the biggest news of the day.</p><br/><p>Jackpot! If this was reported, it would definitely shake the entire nation.</p><br/><p>Then, the reporters dispersed and went back to write their scripts. At the same time, they arranged for people to camp there so that the latest information can be reported as soon as possible.</p><br/><p>The next day!</p><br/><p>In the morning.</p><br/><p>The weather was brilliant.</p><br/><p>However, something huge had happened on the Internet. When everyone saw it, they were all stunned.</p><br/><p>On a certain web forum.</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, Jin Xuan Ming got badly beaten up by a burglar.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe news said that Jin Xuan Ming performed at a building opposite an art exhibition center and the burglars went there to steal an artwork. One of the burglars slid to the other building from the 19th level to the 18th level, which happened to be Jin Xuan Ming\u2019s performance location. He kicked the glass window and appeared behind Jin Xuan Ming. Then, he kicked him. Wait, why does this sound like a movie?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn! Awesome, that\u2019s nice to hear.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, that\u2019s hilarious. I think this Jin Xuan Ming isn\u2019t fated to be in China this year. He got beaten up twice in these few days.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLook at the news. The doctor said that Jin Xuan Ming\u2019s private part has become useless. Does that mean he\u2019s a eunuch?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s highly possible.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough he was a burglar, his actions deserve to be praised.\u201d</p><br/><p>On Lin Fan\u2019s Weibo.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, it\u2019s hilarious. When Master Lin posted that yesterday, I still didn\u2019t know what it meant. Today, I finally understood it. I guess Master Lin knew about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s weird. How did Master Lin find out about this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you stupid? Master Lin\u2019s fortune telling skills are so good. How could he not tell?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true. If he could find out about it like that, why didn\u2019t Master Lin tell everyone? After all, an innocent person got badly beaten up and it isn\u2019t a good thing. Master Lin has such capable powers but still chose to watch it happen. That\u2019s awful.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you stupid? Master Lin didn\u2019t want to tell him because that would prevent this from happening.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck your mom. If you say I\u2019m stupid again, I\u2019ll get angry.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re indeed stupid. Come hit me then\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c^ You\u2019re despicable. I\u2019ll remember you for this.\u201d</p><br/><p>At a random place.</p><br/><p>The five burglars looked at the news and were stunned. Then, four of them looked at Li Long.</p><br/><p>\u201cLi Long, did you kick him?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Long nodded. \u201cYeah, I did.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, why did you hit a celebrity? We\u2019re going to be wanted criminals,\u201d everyone cried.</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to kick him. You guys said that it would be an empty place. I jumped in accurately but I realized that there was a huge crowd. It frightened me. I wanted to apologize but when I heard that he was a Korean, I couldn\u2019t take it so I kicked him a few times,\u201d Li Long said.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, let\u2019s not talk about this anymore. We\u2019ll sell the two artworks to the collector for five million dollars. As usual, we\u2019ll donate one million and the rest of us will get eight hundred thousand dollars each. Let\u2019s split up first. I\u2019ll be returning to my hometown to plant trees. What about you guys?\u201d The man that had disguised as a doctor was the leader.</p><br/><p>The \u2018pregnant lady\u2019 said, \u201cI\u2019ll go back to Zhejiang to act in a drama show.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn, you really believe that guy?\u201d</p><br/><p>The woman nodded. \u201cYeah, the Internet said that he\u2019s a Master in fortune-telling. If I really become a celebrity, you guys can become my assistants and we don\u2019t have to do this anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll go to the mountainous villages to teach. If you guys have another project, please contact me.\u201d</p><br/><p>The five of them stood up and stretched out their arms and gave each other a fist bump. \u201cAlright, we\u2019re all brothers and if one of us gets caught, we swear to never betray each other. Let\u2019s split up\u2026\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

She posted a video on Weibo. Upon playing the video, one would see Wang Mei Tian\u2019s life at night.</p><br/><p>\u201cTianshu Milk is trustworthy. Drinking a bottle every night will bring great benefits to your body and your sleep. As for what Master Lin said about Tianshu Milk, I believe that it is a false rumor. I hope that everyone will trust Tianshu and I hope that the false rumors will be dealt with legally.\u201d</p><br/><p>In the video, Wang Mei Tian took a big gulp of Tianshu Milk. Moreover, she drank it very seductively as the white milk dripped down her lips. This made countless netizens have their eyes glued to the screen. <em>You\u2019re f*cking seducing us!</em></p><br/><p>The netizens couldn\u2019t sit still.</p><br/><p>\u201cI support Mei Tian. How could there be a problem? I\u2019ve been drinking Tianshu for almost ten years and I\u2019ve never gotten any symptoms. Although this Master Lin is worthy of respect, he can\u2019t just slander other people\u2019s business.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. I really want to become that bottle of milk in Mei Tian\u2019s hands.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI support Mei Tian unconditionally. The only thing I do every day is look through Mei Tian\u2019s Weibo to see if she has any updates.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo one else has dared to step out to stop Master Lin\u2019s baseless accusation. My Mei Tian is the only one who has done it. We have to support this attitude of hers.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are way too many idiots nowadays. They listen to whatever other people say. Do they think Master Lin is a god? The Quality Inspection Office doesn\u2019t even know about it but he knows? Doesn\u2019t he understand how big of an impact his words have caused? My family is an agent for Tianshu Milk. Because of this incident, we\u2019ve lost a countless amount of money. I feel that Master Lin has to bear responsibility for this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c^I can\u2019t stand it when people falsely accuse others. Although this Tianshu is a Japanese company, we\u2019re already past the age of national discrimination. This Tianshu has provided many jobs for people in China. If a problem arises and these people lose their jobs, Master Lin is the one to blame.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c^What if what Master Lin said is true?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not possible. Don\u2019t even think about it. How can that Lin be so powerful and how can the Quality Inspection Office be so stupid? If you ask me, he has messed up this time. Just wait. That Lin will regret this very soon. When that time comes, he will surely look for all kinds of excuses to push the blame away.\u201d</p><br/><p>Many netizens had rushed to Wang Mei Tian\u2019s Weibo to discuss this matter regarding Tianshu Milk.</p><br/><p>Wang Mei Tian saw the situation on Weibo and let out a sly grin. Then, she got off her bed and sat on the balcony, holding her phone in her hands. She started typing again. She felt that this time, she was on the side of justice.</p><br/><p>Tianshu Milk was a listed company. It was huge. It basically owned 45% of the country\u2019s market share for milk. Besides Mengniu Milk and some other large corporations, no one else dared to compete with them.</p><br/><p>Moreover, it was a foreign corporation which had already been in China for a while. It had deep roots in the industry. It wasn\u2019t something that could be suppressed so easily by someone with the surname Lin.</p><br/><p>Anyone with eyes could tell that this man with the surname Lin was done for.</p><br/><p>He would have to face a lawsuit, pay the compensation, and even spend some time in prison.</p><br/><p>Thinking about it, he had asked for death himself.</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian was busy working when his phone rang. When he answered the call, his expression changed to one of disbelief.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt can\u2019t be. Master Lin wouldn\u2019t falsely accuse Tianshu for no reason. I can\u2019t just arrest someone for no reason.\u201d It was a call from his superiors, telling him to bring Master Lin in for investigation. To Liu Xiao Tian, that was not possible.</p><br/><p>He would not believe that Master Lin would falsely accuse others for no reason.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. Although Master Lin has no evidence, Tianshu Milk has no proof that their milk has no problems either. If the Quality Inspection Office can produce the test reports to prove that Master Lin\u2019s accusations are false, I will take action immediately. Before that, I can\u2019t do anything.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not taking anyone\u2019s side. I\u2019m working based on facts. They have to speak with evidence.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian immediately suppressed the situation. This call wasn\u2019t from Shanghai. It was from Beijing.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is troublesome.\u201d After hanging up, Liu Xiao Tian felt a bit of a headache. Then, he pondered for a moment before giving Master Lin a call.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, do you have evidence regarding the incident?\u201d What he wanted to know most right now was whether or not there was evidence. If there wasn\u2019t, he might really have to bring Master Lin in eventually, which he didn\u2019t want to do.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou do? Then where is it? The impact of this matter is quite big. The higher-ups are starting to get involved.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? You tasted it? That\u2019s not experimental evidence. Sigh. Master Lin, how big of a problem are you trying to cause?\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Xiao Tian was really dazed. He hadn\u2019t expected Master Lin to say that he had tasted the carcinogens. <em>How is that f*cking possible? Is he playing around?</em></p><br/><p>In his heart, Master Lin was a very reliable person. How was it possible that he would do something like this?</p><br/><p><em>No, I have to do something. No matter what, I can\u2019t just let Master Lin do whatever he wants. Without any evidence, he can\u2019t just fool around like this.</em></p><br/><p>At that moment, Tianshu Milk Company was having a meeting.</p><br/><p>*Clatter!*</p><br/><p>After a middle-aged man entered, he tossed a file onto the table. His expression was so dark that it was scary. \u201cSomebody tell me. Why did nobody say anything about yesterday\u2019s incident until today? Do you know how big of an impact this has on us?\u201d</p><br/><p>The people below were at a loss.</p><br/><p>\u201cChief, we didn\u2019t expect this either. We didn\u2019t expect it to develop so much overnight.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah. What is that Master Lin thinking? We\u2019ve never offended him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone started speaking one by one as they appeared to be very angry. It was as if they had been misunderstood. They hadn\u2019t expected this Master Lin to be so bold to spread a false rumor like that. As for whether or not there was actually a problem with their milk, they had no idea. That was the manufacturing side\u2019s problem.</p><br/><p>All they had to do was to sell the manufactured products and also manage some company matters.</p><br/><p>However, they had passed all the checks but this Lin was still accusing them. They had to handle this matter strictly.</p><br/><p>The middle-aged man barked, \u201cWhat are you all still sitting here for? Do you need me to teach you what to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>When the rest heard this, they immediately nodded and didn\u2019t say more. Of course, they knew what to do about this.</p><br/><p>They had to quickly settle this issue. Otherwise, if it were to develop to an irreversible state, it would really be troublesome.</p></div>\n</div>"}

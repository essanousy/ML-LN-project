Everyone was feeling great after their shops had reopened. They were full of confidence for the future, especially because the number of customers yesterday had been insane. Little Boss' scallion pancakes had brought in countless people.</p><br/><p>Little Boss's scallion pancakes were so powerful. If it could be described with words, it would have been likened to a no-nonsense force. As long as one dared to eat them, the scallion pancakes would definitely captivate their souls.</p><br/><p>He Cheng Han's situation with his son had nothing to do with an outsider like him. But He Cheng Han had sighed after what had happened in the afternoon yesterday. Wang Ming Yang and the rest of them couldn't do anything to help even though they were extremely wealthy.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Lin Fan had caused the drama yesterday by meddling with their situation. Now that he thought of it, it seemed to be a blessing in disguise.</p><br/><p>\"How does the new shop feel?\" Lin Fan asked as he walked in. The shop was at least three times bigger than the old one. It even had a resting area inside. The new environment was so much better than the old one.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian chuckled, \"It's great! This signifies the development of our careers. We will definitely move to an even bigger place in the future.\"</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang was broadcasting. \"Although I'm an employee without salary, I have started to give my entire life to this place. From now on, I will be the online ambassador of Master Lin's shop.\"</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan smiled. \"I am the waitress of Master Lin's shop.\"</p><br/><p>Wu Tian He laughed too, \"I am a fortune-teller.\"</p><br/><p>\"Recently, my fortune-telling skills have improved. Am I right, Brother Wu?\" Fraud Tian asked joyfully.</p><br/><p>Wu Tian He shook his head. \"There's a slight improvement but you're still far from good enough.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was sitting on the table chatting with everyone. Meanwhile, Zhao Zhong Yang was standing at the entrance. When he saw what was happening in the distance, he immediately shouted, \"Let's get to work. Let's get to work. The people are finally here.\"</p><br/><p>\"New place, new stepping stone. Let's get to work together!\" Lin Fan chuckled.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan and Fraud Tian went to the entrance and saw the number of new townsfolk that were headed to their shop. They were quite shocked as the numbers could match up to that of Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Within the crowd of townsfolk a distance away.</p><br/><p>\"The shop just opened yesterday. I came to try the scallion pancakes and the taste was simply indescribable. It's too crazy,\" a middle-aged lady said.</p><br/><p>\"I heard from my husband that this shop's scallion pancakes are incredible. I didn't believe it at first. How delicious could a scallion pancake be? Even if it is delicious, there's gotta be a limit, right? My husband said there isn't a scallion pancake like this and I had to come and try them today.\"</p><br/><p>\"Haha, your husband is right. You'll only understand after you eat it.\"</p><br/><p>The surrounding shop owners were discussing amongst themselves too.</p><br/><p>\"I told you. As long as Master Lin is here, there will be customers.\"</p><br/><p>\"Yesterday, I went to look around here. Logically speaking, the number of residents that live here can't be matched to that of Cloud Street. But the number of people here today is incredible.\"</p><br/><p>\"Hey, look. Aren't those the townsfolk from Cloud Street? Why are they here today?\"</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>\"Don't you live along Cloud Street? Did you really come here just for the scallion pancakes?\" a shop owner asked.</p><br/><p>The man laughed, \"Haha, when you guys were renovating, I moved my house. Anyway, it isn't far from where I work.\"</p><br/><p>The shop owners were impressed. Only someone capable could do something like that.</p><br/><p>They were really impressed.</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian stood at the entrance. \"Everyone, our rules for selling scallion pancakes are: there's a limit of ten pieces every day. Each piece costs $50 and can only be bought if your number tag is picked. At the same time, you can read the poster on the wall. If you understand it, you are entitled to a scallion pancake too. These are our rules.\"</p><br/><p>When Fraud Tian said that, everyone gasped in shock.</p><br/><p>\"That can't be. Which shop would have such weird rules?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yeah, it's not like we aren't willing to pay. Why do they limit it to ten pieces only?\"</p><br/><p>\"I won't buy it then. I've never seen such a shop with so much entitlement.\"</p><br/><p>Those townsfolk that said they weren't going to buy were all talk. They just stood there as per what they had been doing. How could they not know about Master Lin's scallion pancakes? They just wanted to bait people into leaving. After all, it would boost their chances of getting the scallion pancakes.</p><br/><p>Indeed, some townsfolk started to argue.</p><br/><p>\"You must think that we're fools. How could we not know about Master Lin's scallion pancakes?\"</p><br/><p>\"That's right. The Internet is so advanced now. We've heard news about Master Lin's scallion pancakes.\"</p><br/><p>\"I wake up at 6 am every morning just for these scallion pancakes. I would run over from home. If anyone wishes to leave, please leave. I'd stand a greater chance.\"</p><br/><p>The other townsfolk weren't bothered by what they said in disharmony. Some of them had already had their fill yesterday. But was it really that delicious?</p><br/><p>There is no free meal in the world. The scallion pancakes had been free and unlimited yesterday. It was too good to be true for the first day of business. They definitely had a motive for doing that.</p><br/><p>Look!</p><br/><p>Those townsfolk that had eaten the scallion pancakes yesterday were here.</p><br/><p>They were all completely convinced of how delicious the scallion pancakes were. The taste was really indescribable. Furthermore, it had been their first time trying it. Even those that had eaten it several times at Cloud Street couldn't resist the temptation of these scallion pancakes. These townsfolk didn't stand a chance at all.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, buyers started to shout in the crowd.</p><br/><p>\"I'll buy the pancake for $888 from whoever manages to get it.\"</p><br/><p>\"I offer $1000.\"</p><br/><p>Master Lin's pancakes were extremely popular with the resellers. There were a lot of wealthy men who wanted to eat Master Lin's scallion pancakes.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, the prices weren't cheap.</p><br/><p>One of the re-sellers had managed to fetch a crazy price for a scallion pancake.</p><br/><p>He had managed to sell it for $10,000. He wouldn't any negotiations. In the end, it had been bought by a wealthy man.</p><br/><p>Of course, it was a rare case. On average, one could purchase a scallion pancake for about $3,000. Some even managed to sell them at higher prices.</p><br/><p>Therefore, Master Lin's scallion pancakes were one of those cheap foods that could be sold for a crazy price within the reselling business.</p><br/><p>The prices were reasonable and they even believed that the prices could be even higher.</p><br/><p>It was almost impossible to purchase a scallion pancake from Master Lin. There were too many people and there were only ten pieces a day. If they wanted to buy one, they had to depend on luck.</p><br/><p>Some of the townsfolk weren't used to it but Lin Fan believed that they would be used to it soon.</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan and Fraud Tian were busy while Lin Fan just sat there leisurely and drank his tea.</p><br/><p>Some townsfolk went to the wall to read the poster.</p><br/><p>\"Encyclopedic Points +1.\"</p><br/><p>Lin Fan pointed \"She understood it and she's entitled to one.\"</p><br/><p>Fraud Tian smiled. \"Ma'am, you don't have to queue anymore.\"</p><br/><p>The granny waved her hand at Fraud Tian. \"I don't want it, it's too expensive. $50 is too much.\"</p><br/><p>The surrounding townsfolk gasped in horror.</p><br/><p>\"D*mn, if you don't want it, give it to me.\"</p><br/><p>\"How did you even qualify for a scallion pancake from reading this? I read it several times but I didn't even get chosen.\"</p><br/><p>A re-seller charged forward. \"Ma'am, I'll buy yours for $300.\"</p><br/><p>The granny was stunned, \"Huh? $300?\"</p><br/><p>Another re-seller said, \"$400.\"</p><br/><p>\"$400?!\" The granny was stunned. She didn't know a scallion pancake could fetch such a high price. Were these people crazy?</p><br/><p>Lin Fan wasn't bothered by these things at all as long as he could increase his Encyclopedic Points. He was even thinking about how his Encyclopedic Points would increase by a lot, judging by the number of people that came.</p><br/><p>...</p><br/>\n</div>"}

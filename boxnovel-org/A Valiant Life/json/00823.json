They were all beaten till they were afraid by Lin Fan.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster Lin, you said you would give us chance. You won\u2019t make a lot of friends like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI feel like I\u2019m going to collapse already. How can my technique be so lousy?\u201d</p><br/><p>The team members all complained one by one. However, the look on their faces did not show any trace of disappointment but rather they were a little excited.</p><br/><p>After playing against Master Lin, they finally knew how powerful Master Lin was. It was simply not possible to describe it with words.</p><br/><p>It was exactly the same as what Master Lin said on Weibo. If he were to enter the international competitions, ping pong would become meaningless already.</p><br/><p>Also, it would be easy to give their opposition an enormous psychological barrier.</p><br/><p>Cui Guo Bin laughed and said, \u201cMaster Lin, from what I see, why don\u2019t you come over and become out national team coach? As long as you agree to come, I\u2019ll give my position to you. I will have no complaints at all.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied, \u201cThat\u2019s enough, don\u2019t tease me. I\u2019m very happy to be selling scallion pancakes every day. Why would I want to become a coach?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu You Lan was standing at the side and quietly listening on and did not interrupt at all. She felt like Brother Lin was becoming more and more awesome. Even the national team was not a match for him. This made her feel very proud.</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang was very excitedly broadcasting. The chatroom in the broadcast was in chaos.</p><br/><p>Master Lin was challenging the national team\u2019s players. How could they not be in a frenzy?</p><br/><p>Also, the result was very surprising. Master Lin had only depended on himself and completely destroyed the national team.</p><br/><p>Of course, to the netizens, there was nothing wrong with this and they felt that this was normal. They had known Master Lin for a long time already and they felt that he was extremely mysterious. He knew everything and no matter what he played he would be extremely good.</p><br/><p>*Thud Thud!*</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan, Cui Guo Bin and the rest of them were very happily chatting, there was a knock on the door.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome in.\u201d</p><br/><p>A middle-aged man walked. His face was filled with excitement as he said, \u201cGreetings, I am the boss of this arena. Hello Master Lin, hello Coach Cui\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The boss was so excited after seeing Master Lin as well as the members of the national team that he was at a loss for words.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan gave a bitter laugh. However, this boss was also very lively and enthusiastic. A picture, autographs, he would definitely not be able to run away from this.</p><br/><p>Especially when they were taking a photo together. The boss even went to specially change into better-looking clothes. Then, he let out the bright smile that he could and looked in the mirror.</p><br/><p>To the boss, this was going to be a huge profit. He was going to print the picture out and then make a huge copy of it and hang it in the shop. That idea made him feel very elated.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan and the rest of them saw that the time was getting late and it was almost time to leave.</p><br/><p>Also, the enthusiastic boss got his staff to quickly print some lifelong VIP cards which gave them free access to the place also. He gave one to each of them. To the boss, he did not care whether they used it or not but it was still a good gesture.</p><br/><p>Nothing was certain and maybe one day they would actually come back.</p><br/><p>At Cloud Street.</p><br/><p>Cui Guo Bin shook hands with Lin Fan and said, \u201cMaster Lin, we are going to leave now. I\u2019m really grateful. They next time you come to Beijing, you definitely must let me know.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan asked in astonishment, \u201cYou\u2019re going to go back today?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. We\u2019re flying off today and not going to stay any longer. I still have to bring them back to practice. We\u2019re having a competition soon and we need to up our practice,\u201d Cui Guo Bin said.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan nodded and said, \u201cThat\u2019s alright. Then I shan\u2019t hold you guys back already. Come back to Shanghai if you guys have the chance.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xu Song waved and said, \u201cGoodbye Master Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGoodbye.\u201d</p><br/><p>At the French Michelin Headquarters.</p><br/><p>When the staff member saw Master Lin\u2019s reply, he was completely dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>One of the staff members who was in charge of examining their mail waved his hand and said, \u201cLi, come over here for a moment. Help me look at these Chinese words. Why do I feel like I\u2019ve read this wrongly?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Li\u2019 was someone of Chinese descent and he helplessly said, \u201cAren\u2019t you supposed to know how to read Chinese?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI do, but I\u2019m afraid that I might have misread this. Help me take a look. What do these few words meaning?\u201d</p><br/><p>The young man of Chinese descent came to the computer and looked at the email and said, \u201cThis says that there is no time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it really saying there is no time? You\u2019re sure that you haven\u2019t seen it wrongly?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCan you don\u2019t doubt the standards of my Chinese? Although I live in France, my Chinese is still pretty good.\u201d</p><br/><p>When the young man of Chinese descent left, this foreign staff member was thoroughly flabbergasted.</p><br/><p>This was the first time that he had gotten a direct refusal for an invitation to receive their certificate. In his mind, he had sent countless number of this type of email and every single time, when they replied, they would send long paragraphs expressing their gratitude.</p><br/><p>In was like they were thanking God and thanking any other gods. However, when he got this email from China, it was actually those few words in reply.</p><br/><p>This was too frightening.</p><br/><p>Then, he quickly went to find a supervisor and report this situation.</p><br/><p>The next day.</p><br/><p>The news that Cui Guo Bin had brought his players to Shanghai to find Master Lin was spread around. It was even causing a stir on Weibo.</p><br/><p>Some of the netizens that did not know Master Lin were a little stunned and did not dare to believe this.</p><br/><p>However, to some of the more well-informed people, it was pleasant news.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan did not pay attention to this news. To him, it was just a small thing and he did not take it to his heart.</p><br/><p>Right now, the only thing Lin Fan was having a headache about was that the number of people queuing up at his store today was especially great.</p><br/><p>His scallion pancakes were really delicious and could even make people enjoy it till they forgot to go home. But after he was awarded 3 Michelin stars, his normally ordinary and relaxed life had been ruined.</p><br/><p>However, to the surrounding shop owners, they wished that days like this would never go away.</p><br/><p>They felt that their business had improved recently. There was an endless stream of customers coming to buy things now. This was the complete opposite of what they experienced in the past.</p><br/><p>This was all the work of Little Boss. If not for Little Boss, there definitely would not have such a large influx of people.</p><br/><p>Even when compared to those big shopping centers, there was still a huge gap between them.</p><br/><p>At this moment, at the entrance to the store, Lin Fan had finished selling his scallion pancakes and was preparing to rest. Then he realized the Elder Dog that had left him a long time ago had returned.</p><br/><p>However, the situation seemed a little fishy.</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang said, \u201cBrother Lin, you should check and see if Elder Dog is sick. He looks very wobbly while walking.\u201d</p><br/><p>LIn Fan had some suspicions inside. How could he be sick? This was definitely not possible.</p><br/><p>He had fed the \u2018Righteous Pet Food\u2019 to the Elder Dog every day. He had spent 100 Encyclopedic Points to exchange for them and they had a huge impact on the Elder Dog.</p><br/><p>How could it fall sick?</p><br/><p>Lin Fan immediately rushed in front and hugged the Elder Dog. He realized that the Elder Dog\u2019s eyelids had been flipped. Also, when he made contact with him, he realized that his body actually some sort of force flaring up.</p><br/><p>\u201cF*ck, could he be evolving?\u201d Lin Fan said inside.</p><br/><p>Then he rushed to hug the Elder Dog and left the store, saying, \u201cTake care of the shop guys.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang wanted to say something but Lin Fan had left already.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Lin Fan was a little excited.</p><br/><p>In his eyes, the Elder Dog was going to evolve into a godly Elder Dog. Thus, his mission would have been accomplished.</p></div>\n</div>"}

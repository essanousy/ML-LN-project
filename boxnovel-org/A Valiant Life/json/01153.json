Although he had the fortune-telling knowledge and he understood that every action would have consequences, it didn\u2019t matter. He still had to do his best in each situation.</p><br/><p>The other option was just to watch that woman get burned to death.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan had already changed so many fates but nothing bad had happened to him yet.</p><br/><p>It didn\u2019t matter if he changed one more fate.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang was feeling light-headed as if his body was floating. The alcohol had gotten to him and he had turned into a chatterbox. He kept rambling to Lin Fan non-stop, leaving Lin Fan completely helpless.</p><br/><p>In the end, Lin Fan managed to send Wang Ming Yang back to Xu Zi Le.</p><br/><p>When Xu Zi Le saw Ming Yang\u2019s state, she was a little confused. She couldn\u2019t figure out how Brother Lin wasn\u2019t drunk. This kind of situation had happened a few times already. Meanwhile, her partner seemed as if he was about to collapse to the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Lin, aren\u2019t you drunk?\u201d asked Xu Zi Le in a surprised tone.</p><br/><p>Lin Fan said with a smile, \u201cWhy would I be drunk? He tried to get me drunk even though he has such low alcohol tolerance. That\u2019s not possible. Actually, I haven\u2019t even warmed up when he got drunk. However, I have some good news to tell you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xu Zi Le was supporting Wang Ming Yang. When she heard that, she was curious. \u201cBrother Lin, what good news is there?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan wanted to speak but unexpectedly, Wang Ming Yang started mumbling, \u201cGood news? The good news is that we\u2019ll get a marriage certificate tomorrow. Then, we\u2019ll get married a few days later and you\u2019ll give birth to my child.\u201d</p><br/><p>When she heard this, Xu Zi Le was stunned. She hadn\u2019t expected this at all. She had been with Wang Ming Yang for so long but she had always been afraid of being dumped all of a sudden.</p><br/><p>But now, after hearing Ming Yang\u2019s words, her heart was overwhelmed with joy. Her eyes even glistened a little.</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan saw this, he felt that he couldn\u2019t stay here any longer. He waved his hand and said, \u201cTake care of yourselves tonight. Since you\u2019re going to get married, it\u2019s alright to have sex unrestrainedly. I\u2019m leaving now. I shan\u2019t disturb the two of you any longer.\u201d</p><br/><p>Upon saying that, he left the place.</p><br/><p>He really couldn\u2019t take it. He hadn\u2019t expected that, in the blink of an eye, Wang Ming Yang was going to get married.</p><br/><p>Wang Ming Yang said in a slur, \u201cMy Brother said that, if we get married this year, next year we\u2019ll raise a dog\u2026No, I mean\u2026we\u2019ll raise a child born in the year of the dog. It\u2019s good. Very good.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xu Zi Le raised her hand to slap Ming Yang but she gently put it down. Then, a smile appeared on her face as she looked at that figure that was walking away.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you, Brother Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>She knew the reason for all this now. Ming Yang was still very young and he had had no plans to get married. Now that they were going to get married, it was probably because Brother Lin had said something that made Ming Yang agree.</p><br/><p>The next day!</p><br/><p>When Lin Fan came to Cloud Street, he realized that a group of people were in a discussion.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you all doing?\u201d Lin Fan asked curiously. <em>Doesn\u2019t this group of guys have to run their businesses today? Why are they all gathered here talking about something?</em></p><br/><p>Elder Liang said, \u201cLittle Boss, did you see the news? A supernatural occurrence has taken place.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan replied curiously, \u201cWhat supernatural occurrence? Do you really believe in those things? We\u2019re living in a scientific society now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Zhong Yang said in a surprised tone, \u201cBrother Lin, you have to believe this. There are even videos on the Internet. It was completely exposed on the news. Hurry up and take a look.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan was very curious. He really wanted to see what kind of supernatural occurrence it was that made them so restless.</p><br/><p>With one look at the news, Lin Fan was completely stunned. This was really incredible.</p><br/><p>\u2018Past midnight this morning, an apartment on the tenth floor of Garden Apartment Building caught fire. The fire was spreading ferociously but then, a mystical thing happened.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u2018Breaking! The woman who was trapped by the fire actually did this to the fire\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>If he had to choose between these two titles, he would definitely pick the second one. It really made him want to click on it.</p><br/><p>But when he clicked on it, he saw that the article was full of made-up things. It made him lose respect for the reporter who wrote it.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Lin Fan was also stunned. Wasn\u2019t this the fire that he had casually extinguished last night? He hadn\u2019t expected that even something like this would go on the news. It was really strange.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Boss, have you seen it now? This is really miraculous. I feel that this can\u2019t be explained by science at all,\u201d said Elder Liang.</p><br/><p>Sister Hong nodded. \u201cMmm. I think so too. Do you think it was really the Buddha\u2019s protection?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Fan laughed awkwardly. He couldn\u2019t possibly tell them that it was actually him who passed by and casually blew the air to extinguish the flame.</p><br/><p>If he really said that, they would think he was retarded.</p><br/><p>\u201cMay I know if Master Lin is here?\u201d At that moment, a stranger came to the shop.</p><br/><p>This person was dressed tidily and he wore a pair of spectacles. With one look, one could tell that he was a researcher.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am Master Lin. And you are\u2026?\u201d Lin Fan asked curiously.</p><br/><p>The middle-aged man immediately went forward with a face full of smiles. \u201cHello, Master Lin. I\u2019m from the Artificial Limb Research Department of the Ministry of Civil Affairs. I\u2019m here today on orders from my leader to invite Master Lin to have a chat about matters related to the perfect artificial limbs.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh. My surname is Zhou and my first name is Hai,\u201d said Zhou Hai with a polite smile. At the same time, he scanned Lin Fan closely. When his research department found out about the perfect artificial limbs, they had been astounded.</p><br/><p>At first, they hadn\u2019t believed it. But after watching the video and after interacting with the Shanghai government, they realized that the perfect artificial limbs were actually real.</p><br/><p>They were very curious about the technological insights that were hidden within the perfect artificial limbs. After all, their research department was specialized in researching artificial limbs. However, even though they had been constantly making progress, they had never thought that such perfect artificial limbs would be created.</p><br/><p>Hence, he wanted to interact with Master Lin in order to learn about the technologies used.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh. Hello, hello. I\u2019m not managing that matter anymore. I\u2019ve already handed it over to the Shanghai government and Eastern Han Organization. If you\u2019re interested, you can go there to take a look,\u201d said Lin Fan with a smile.</p><br/><p>He had not expected a specialized organization to approach him. However, he did know about this Artificial Limb Research Department of the Ministry of Civil Affairs. It was the only department in the country that specialized in this field of research.</p><br/><p>It was a national department and it was sanctioned by the National Science Council.</p><br/><p>Zhou Hai smiled. \u201cMaster Lin, I\u2019ve already gone there. I\u2019ve seen the product as well. I have to say that it\u2019s really amazing. It\u2019s a great help to our studies.\u201d</p><br/><p>With Lin Fan\u2019s current influence on society, there weren\u2019t many people who didn\u2019t know him. He held all kinds of titles but these titles had nothing to do at all with his research of artificial limbs.</p><br/><p>But now, an outsider like him had actually developed the perfect artificial limbs. This, to those people who specialized in researching this field, was scary.</p><br/><p>They were confused. What else did Master Lin know?</p><br/><p>Lin Fan thought for a moment before saying, \u201cCome in for a seat then. I guess we could have a casual chat.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you, Master Lin.\u201d Zhou Hai let out a breath of relief. He could finally talk to Master Lin. If he had been rejected, it would have been embarrassing.</p><br/><p>The surrounding shop owners started whispering amongst themselves.</p><br/><p>\u201cLook. Little Boss is so awesome. The things that he does can\u2019t be done by anyone else.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s for sure. Just look at where Little Boss is from. He\u2019s Cloud Street\u2019s most awesome person.</p></div>\n</div>"}
